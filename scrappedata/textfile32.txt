He told her that as she hadn't signed the papers, her and Jake were still married. Melanie asked if anyone had a pen on them. When she was handed the pen, she struggled with putting the pen to paper but in the end, she didn't do it as she still loved Jake and so she cannot marry Andrew Jake was at home all by himself and he looked at the time on the clock. He sadly thought to himself, \"Melanie's probably married by now,\" then he felt a sinking feeling in his heart. Jake then headed to a bar where he met a brunette woman who introduced herself as Andrea After Melanie told Andrew she couldn't marry him, Jake's mother reacted angrily and told her to \"go deep fry something\". Melanie responded by punching Andrew's mom in the face and said, \"No one talks about my momma like that!\" She then ran away and went to find Jake Melanie went over to Jake's place but she saw he wasn't there. She decided to try that beach from their childhood. It had started to rain so she made a run for it. When she was looking for him, she thought about how much she loved him and how she was going to tell him how she felt about him. When she got there however, she had seen something. Jake was at the beach and he was kissing another woman. Heartbroken, Melanie walked away Jake and Andrea were at the beach. He remembered the beach being the first place him and Melanie had their first kiss but he decided that he would create some new memories there. He thought to himself, \"I waited seven years for Melanie but she has made it perfectly clear she no longer wants me. If she's moved on, why can't I?\" Melanie went back home and looked through her handbag. She saw that the divorce papers were in her handbag. She got changed, packed her bags then she added her signature to the divorce papers. She then drove to Jake's place where she left the papers at his door then drove back to New York It had been three years since Melanie had last been in Alabama. She hadn't heard from Jake since that day she went to see him and she wasn't expecting to either. She had continued to work in her fashion design business which had stayed her main focus in the last three years. One afternoon, a pretty brunette came in to see Melanie asking Melanie to design a dress for her. The woman introduced herself as Lacey and told her her and her fiancé had been together for two and a half years and were soon to be married. She then took out her wallet and showed Melanie a picture of herself and her fiancé. Melanie looked at the picture and as she was looking at it, something or rather someone had come to her attention.

One-shot unless its popular ;) Disclamer: I do not own Sweet Home Alabama, but if I did, Mel and Jake wouldn't have even thought about getting a divorce and Bobby Ray would have been straight... It was the song. The song that played when I walked down the aisle on our wedding night. I regretted that night more than anything. Why did I marry that drunk hillbilly? I guess I shouldn't call Jake that. We grew up together, but I left this crap pile and moved to New York with my fiancee. I only came back to get Jake to sign the divorce papers. \"Mel... Wanna dance?\" \"Jake. I came to get you to sign the damn papers, not for you to relive old memories!\" \"Mel. Just once please just let everything go and enjoy it here! You grew up here don't even act like you didn't! Your not to good for us now because your married to some rich guy from New York!\" \"Fine!\" She grabbed his hand and they danced...

They walked to the old stock farm now closed due to the bad economy. \"Remember when we came here cow tipping?\" \"Jake... Did I make the wrong choice leaving?\" \"I think so\" he replied a new softness on his voice. \"I still love you Jake. I need you in my life still. I can't marry Andrew!\" \"I already knew that.\" He leaned in and kissed her. Her head spinning, Mel kissed him back wishing they could stay there forever. The end!

But anyway I thought that was hilarious so we had to rewatch it and in rewatching it I had to point out all the times they hint at or state he's gay just so she could catch it and in doing that I started thinking and this little fic thingy was born. Disclaimer: Don't own the movie, if I did I wouldn't live at home still. Summary: So how exactly did that conversation between Jake and Bobby Ray go when Jake found him in the parking lot? Jake pulled in the parking lot just after dark, he turned off his truck mid song and stepped out into the warm night air. God, he loved it here, the sound of the country music floating around him, as if it were coming from everywhere. He could smell the fried food and almost taste the beer. Despite all the things happening with Melanie he was real glad she was back, it was almost like things were the way they used to be. Tonight he would see her, she would be beautiful and he could spend just a little more time with her before she went back to New York to live happily ever after with her finance. Not twenty feet away from his truck he saw a figure sitting on a tailgate, head bowed low with hands covering it. He knew that truck, it was Bobby Ray's; he knew that white pick up anywhere. He hadn't seen him since that night at the bar when Melanie… well, when she had a slight slip of the tongue. He purposely closed his car door a little louder than usual hoping it would startle the boy and he would look up. It didn't, it was like he didn't even hear it. Sighing to himself he walked over to the back of the truck where Bobby Ray sat with his head down. When he reached him he saw that the man was so wound up in his own thoughts he didn't even notice Jake yet. So, without warning he hopped up on the tailgate right beside him much to Bobby Ray's surprise, this made him jump. For the first time he looked up from his hands and with the light from the street lamps and the light fluttering over from the festival Jake saw how distressed his friend was. Heck, he could have sworn his eyes were even a little red, was he crying? \"Bobby Ray what're you doin' out here?\" Jake asked folding his hands and placing his elbows on his knees. Bobby Ray looked down and bumbled out a few words Jake couldn't quite understand. \"Sorry, didn't catch that.\" He prompted. \"I don't… I don't know what to do.\" He mumbled just loud enough for Jake to hear. \"Well you jump down off this here tailgate and strut your way over to that entrance over there and have a few beers with everyone that's what you do.\" He glanced over at Jake before looking back down at the ground again. \"Not that,\" he said wringing his hands together. \"Then what's got you all anti-social out here?\" \"You know,\" he said quietly. \"I haven't really talked to anyone since… well, the bar.\" Jake nodded, he knew what this was about but he didn't quite know how to go about addressing it. He's never had to have this conversation with one of his friends before. \"Okay,\" Jake said. \"So what are you worried about?\" Bobby Ray looked up at him incredulously. \"I don't know what to say or do… what if… what if they don't like me?\" Jake sighed and shook his head, he understood his friends fears but they grew up together did he really think something like this would tear them all apart? \"Now Bobby Ray, these people… I have been friends with you since we could crawl and that ain't never gonna change. No matter what, you know that right?\" \"Really?\" He asked in that timid voice he got sometimes. \"I mean, it don't change anything about us?\" \"Not a thing, I don't care and you should know that.\" \"But that's you, what about you're mom or Lurlynn or Dorothea or Clinton or –\" \"You can list every damn person in this town and my answer to each isn't gonna change. No one cares, we're just a little shocked you didn't tell us sooner. I mean Mel knew and you haven't talked to her for years have you?\" \"No…\" \"Then why the big secret?\" \"Well Mel was always… she always had big dreams, she was open minded and all, not that ya'll aren't… you know what I mean…\" \"Yeah I do.\" \"Besides, one night when we were hangin' out at my house I thought she went home but she came back cause she forgot somethin' and she caught me flippin' the channels and… I sort of hovered at one… I could've played it off but it was like she already knew. She slept over that night, she was real good about it all.\" \"You haven't told anyone since?\" Bobby Ray looked down and shook his head. \"No… I mean, no one I knew or had any connection whatsoever to this town.\" \"That's a long time to keep quiet.\" Jake said quietly. \"A long time not to trust us enough.\" \"I just didn't think… I thought you wouldn't like me.\" Jake paused. \"You know what I do think?\" \"What?\" He asked. \"I think you should say it.\" Jake said. \"Tell me so I can hear it out of your mouth.\" \"I don't think…\" \"Oh come on, what are you scared of? You know I don't care.\" Jake said awkwardly putting an arm around his shoulders for support. \"I… Jake?\" \"It'll help, trust me.\" Bobby Ray could certainly trust Jake but he had no idea why he said 'trust me', he had no idea if it would help. \"I… I mean…\" Bobby Ray stumbled and Jake allowed it. This couldn't be easy for him. \"Jake,\" he said finally looking up at his friend. \"I'm gay.\" Jake grinned and gripped his friends shoulder. \"There, now was that so hard?\" \"Yes.\" Bobby Ray answered. \"Oh no it was not, now come on, let's get in there before it's all over. You can see for yourself then how much everyone doesn't care.\" Jake jumped down off the tailgate with Bobby Ray close behind him. They walked a few paces before Jake got the feeling that Bobby Ray wanted to say something. \"What's on your mind, buddy?\" \"Hey, uh, you know them tongue posts?\" \"Yeah?\" \"What if I got one?\" \"I think you'd have a hell of a time finding someone to do it in this town.\" \"But what if I did?\" Jake grinned. \"I'd like to see that.\" He said patting Bobby Ray on the back as they walked through the entrance. AN: Just a side note in case some of you didn't notice, in the pictures they show during the credits they show that Bobby Ray did indeed get a post in his tongue. He's so cute.

DISCLAIMER: The characters/situations do not belong to me. I'm just playing withrnthem. Forgiveness It isn't until BobbyrnRay gets the tongue piercing that Jake realizes he's actuallyrnreally gay. The time Bobby Ray hit on Melanie's fiancée wasrnkind of a big hint, and the looks he exchanged with Melanie's gayrndesigner friend were kind of a dead giveaway, but somewhere deep downrnJake has kept on thinking that maybe Bobby Ray is just confused, andrnsooner or later he'll meet a nice girl and marry her and they'llrnall pretend that the part where Bobby Ray is gay never happened. But then Bobby Rayrncomes to New York to see Melanie's designs, and Melanie's gayrndesigner friend takes him shopping, and when Bobby Ray comes back hernhas a bolt through his tongue. Melanie squeals andrnmakes him stick his tongue out for pictures and says, \"Oh, BobbyrnRay\" in that way of her that makes i Ray /i have two syllables, i Ray-ay /i , high-pitchedrnand upturned at the end. And Jake smiles and says it looks good, andrnit does, in the same way that those sideburns he's grown sorncarefully down towards his chin look good, which is to say, actuallyrnreally gay. It isn't that Jakernhas a problem with Bobby Ray being gay. He'd made that clear realrnearly on. Bobby Ray is Bobby Ray and him being gay doesn't changernanything. Except now that he's actually really gay, anyone canrnlook at him and know it right off the bat, where before when he'drnworn his plaid shirts and baseball cap like always you couldn'trnhave told Bobby Ray was gay except by knowing it. And none of themrnhad. But ever since Melanie outed him Bobby Ray's been losing thernhat and spiffing up the shirt and wearing his jeans just a littlerntighter, and now it's like he's got a great big \"I'm Gay\"rnsign over his head, like now that his friends know, he wants everyonernto know it. Next thing, he's gonna ditch the 'Bama accent forrnthe gay one and start telling people to call him Robert.

He tells Jake thisrnlater, after they can actually not feel awkward slapping each otherrnon the back or throwing an arm around each other's shoulders again.rn (The day after Melanie outed Bobby Ray and Jake had slung an armrnaround his shoulders, it was to show everyone how not-awkward thingsrnwere when, in fact, they were actually really awkward.) Jake hates Melanie forrnhaving outed Bobby Ray because it means he's lost a friend. It'srnnot that he isn't still friends with Bobby Ray, but this new BobbyrnRay likes shopping and fashion magazines and men, and okay, none ofrnthat's changed from before, except that Jake didn't know about itrnthen. (Well, he did, about the fashion magazines, but he'd hadrnhimself convinced that Bobby Ray's mother was the one with thernsubscription to Women's Wear Daily and Bobby Ray just read itrnbecause it happened to be, you know, lying around.)

Shenfelt his steady heartbeat underneath her head and upper body. Ornperhaps it was a sweet dream but if it was she never wanted to awakenfrom it. Liftingnher head she drank in his beautiful features. Unfortunately hisnstriking blue eyes were closed at this moment. She felt a rush ofnlove for this man, the feeling was mixed with pride, pride that henhad chosen her, pride that he loved her. Hernhusband! Shenliked the sound of it. Very much. And whispered it out into the airn\"my husband Jake Perry.\" Thenwords made her heart skip a beat and a huge smile filled hernbeautiful face. Shenwas so sure she had made the right choice this time, it had been anneasy choice as Tabby had pointed out it should be. It had been thenonly choice. Thisnman was her past, her present and her future. How could she ever havendoubted that? Shenhad lost her way for a long period of her short life but she hadnluckily found it again. To think she had dreaded to come home, whennall she had really wanted was to be home. A longing she had deniednfor the longest time. Shenhad just forgotten that home was in the arms that were holding hernright now. Silently she promised herself she would never forget thatnagain, she had already wasted too much time running from him…andnherself. Suddenlynscared to awake and find it was just a dream Melanie lifted her bodynand placed her lips on Jake's, herngesture reminded her of the childhood habit of pinching her arm tonknow if she was indeed sleeping or awake. GentlynMelanie tasted his lips with her own, they were soft now he wasnsleeping, they were inviting her to kiss them and feel theirnsoftness, and the combination of sleep and toothpaste wasnirresistible. Growingnbolder she placed small soft kisses in the corners of his mouth. Shenhad misses this. Missed the tastes and smells that were Jake. Thatnwas why it had taken her so long to kiss another man. No! Shenwouldn't think of that now. Besides thatnshe wasn't able to think of other mennwhen she was near Jake. Justnone small kiss and she would stop, she didn'tnwant to wake him and it couldn't be thatnlong since they had fallen asleep. Beforenshe could pull away, two strong arms pulled her tighter and deepenednthe kiss, without thinking she opened her mouth and invited hernhusband into the warm depths. Jakenreleased her mouth and locked his sparkling, blue eyes withnMelanie's, he had one of his mostncharming smiles on his face. \"Honeyndo you realise we have only been sleeping for an hour? Look at thensun, it not a full day yet\" \"JakenI love you. I want you to be the last boy I ever kiss\"nThere was pleading in her eyes and voice. \"Inknow you do Mel and I love you\" \"Younalways have, haven't you Jake?\" Hesitatingnfor only a brief moment he answered \"younknow I have\" Melanienhated the short glint of pain she saw in his eyes before he coverednit. \"I'mnso sorry Jake, I was just so confused and pained that I couldn'tnstay. I needed to get as fast away from myself that I could. I neededna new life.\" \"Inknow we did mess things up Mel. It wasn'tneasy. And I behaved like a boy, a boy who thought I knew how tonprovide for a wife and a child\" \"SorrynJake, I got so confused and stupid for I while. I must have hurt younbadly with Andrew\" \"Forna while! Mel, you can't hardly call sevennyears for a while\" Jake chuckled, it wasntheir second wedding night and he wanted to enlighten his wife'snmood. Hisnwife! How awful good that sounded. She was his wife now. The wows hadnbeen said seven and a half years ago, when they had only beennchildren. Last night the wows had been spoken by their hearts andnacknowledged, it had been meaningless to speak them out aloud, thenlong owed dance had sealed the pact when danced. Itnwas their second wedding night but in many ways their first, on thenfirst they had slept in separate rooms, he had been too sick fromnhangovers and she too disappointed to feel any warm feeling for hernmarital status, A status she hadn'tnreally wanted. Playfullynshe slapped his arm and rolled her eyes \"Thatnwas not what I meant honey\" \"Thennwhat did you mean Mel?\" he battered back. \"Inwas stupid for a while with Andrew. Before him I never as much asnlooked at another man. But I never could figure out why\" \"Toonbusy?\" he searched her eyes, now thenplaying had left his eyes. \"No!nMy heart was already taken dumb head. Had been since I was ten\"nshe assured him. \"AhnI see, a childhood crush then\" \"Yeah,never had one of your own Jake Perry?\" \"SurenI did Mrs. Perry, she was a wild and pretty little thing.\" \"Whatnhappened to her?\" Henbrought her closer to him, his lips only inches away, \"Shenmarried her childhood friend twice\" Lipsnmeet lips in pent up hunger , kisses and caresses told better thannwords about the love between two soul mates finally together again. Thennext time Melanie opened her eyes a pair of amazingly blue eyesncaptured hers. \"Wakenup snoring head. We need to pack a few things before we leave\" Betrayingnhis words Jake leaned in and sensually kissed her on her mildly sorenlips, he didn't seem to be in a hurry.nHad Jake always been this good a kisser? Anfact was that her lips were unused to passionate kissing. Shencouldn't remember another time when shenhad been kissed in this fashion, even not in the back of Jake'sntruck. \"Wherendid you learn to kiss this way Jake?\" \"Whatnway honey?\" he winked at her. \"Younknow perfectly well what way. Was it her…thatnStarr girl?\" SurprisinglynMelanie felt jealous, Starr had been one of the reasons why Mel hadngotten so drunk that night. It had been the way Jake had called hernhoney, his arm that was around her and Starr leaning into his body.nWhen he should have held her, Melanie, in his arm and called hernhoney. \"Starr\"nhe laughed and kissed her one more time. \"Maybenit's thinking of you that made me a goodnkisser\" he attempted to kiss her again. \"Ohnno Jake! How close were you and Starr\" Sighingnhe gave her a half smile \"We went out anfew times honey, it was nothing serious. She didn'tnask for much of me.\" Contentnwith his answer Melanie kissed him back and she would soon havenbecome lost, if it wasn't for the carsndriving up to the house. Who could come over on a day like this, anday that belonged to a husband and a wife. All she wanted was to kissnJake, not that it would be very likely with the sound of more thannone care door being closed just outside the window. Itndidn't appear like Jake had heardnanything he was still kissing her, perhaps she could ignore thenvisitors and they would go back to wherever they came from. Hernthoughts were followed by heavy knocking on the door, even Jakencouldn't ignore the noise. Bynnow Bryant had decided to join in, eager to show he was capable ofnprotecting his family, there was no way to pretend to be still asleepnor not at home, plane and cars were parked outside. \"Seemsnwe have company\" Jake smiled \"I'llnanswer the door while you put on some clothes\" Henjumped out of the bed and pulled some jeans on, Melanie held hernbreath when he reached for his white T-shirt, he was gorgeous andnthis time she was allowed to look all she wanted. Unlike the otherntime she had seen his naked upper body, not that their marital statusnhad really changed, she had been as much married to him as she wasnnow, but now she didn't have a huge ringnon her finger to fool her. \"Younlike what you see Mrs. Perry?\" Jakenstarred at her. \"Umm…!\"nMelanie blushed embarrassedly. \"Younmight want to close your mouth honey or you'llncatch some flues. You better get up\" \"Getnout of here so I can get into my clothes\"nMelanie started to get out of the bed, it was the same old bed theynhad shared when she had lived in the house.

At first nonone saw her and she could watch all of them in peace. Stellanhad always been a second mother to her, in many ways she had been anbetter guide and supporter than her own mother had, she loved Stellandearly. In the past few days she had gotten a better understanding ofnher mother, now she understood that her mother had always had had thenbest intentions in dealing with her daughter. The opinion of what wasnbest had just never been shared by Melanie, they were two oppositenpersonalities, but her mother had wanted a better life for her thannshe had gotten herself. Sad that her mother felt she had wasted hernown life with man and daughter in a small town, but at least shenloved her dad. Herndad had never mingled in the relationship between mother andndaughter, in fact he didn't mingle muchnin other people's affair at all, but shenknew he loved her, he just wasn't veryngood at showing it. \"Therenyou are honey, I was beginning to thing my son had scared you awaynalready\" Stella'snvoice cut through the air.

I need to breathe!\" With a chuckle, Jake backed away and took a long breath- which made Melanie's face crunch up in disgust. When he leaned in for another of those long kiss, she pushed him away. \"Mel, whatcha doing?\" His eyes were locked with hers, a glint of mischief in them. \"You're my wife now. I get to kiss you whenever I want.\" \"Oh, you managed to catch that part?\" Melanie's voice dripped with sarcasm as she fixed her husband with mock innocence. \"After all, you were drunk. So it's really a wonder you heard my vows.\" Jake rolled his eyes, rolling on his back. For a moment, the mere view of the stars rendered him speechless- but only because he forgot whatever he was on the verge of uttering. His spouse misinterpreted his silence. \"You didn't listen to them.\" The pained tone caused the boy to wince. Slowly, he sat and faced Melanie, a smile tucking at the corner of his lips. \"I did. They were awesome.\" \"Liar.\" She glared at him and crossed her arms. \"I called you a stubborn ass.\" To her surprise, it made him laugh. His laughter made her heartbeat race and she discovered, with a pang of indignation, that she truly loved the guy, no matter what kind of jackass he might be. \"I know,\" Jake said at last. \"You also mentioned I was a terrible kisser.\" The fake angry look he shot her had her smirking. \"What if I did?\" \"Have to prove that wrong.\" Once again, he got closer, and once again, he got pushed away. \"Darn!\" He growled, letting his frustration have the better of him. \"That bad?\" Melanie broke into a fit of giggles. \"But, honey, you smell of beer! It's horrible!\" \"C'mon, beer isn't that bad,\" he sighed, trying to get closer… though this time, she didn't even need to touch him. By the only power of her glare, she had him frozen on the spot. \"You crashed in late at our wedding. You laughed while saying your vows. You missed our own wedding dance because you fell asleep. Your mother had to lift you in her car and into your bed… and when you woke up, in the middle of the night, you came to get me here. And I can still smell alcohol all over you!\" The moment her speech was over, she burst in tears. Jake gaped and awkwardly rubbed her back, whispering apologies but not making anything better. \"I dreamt of that day, Jake! You ruined it…\" \"I'm sorry…\" Truly, he was. There was the girl he loved, the girl he married and the girl he wanted to be happy the most… she was crying, all because of him. \"You ruined it on purpose! And the worst is…\" Swallowing nervously, he braced himself for the worst. Surprisingly, she laughed while saying it. \"Worst is I love you.\" Had it been any other time, Jake would have complained about women's mood swings. But it was now and there. He was no longer the same. From this day on, he was married to the most beautiful girl on Earth. Jake and Melanie stood on the beach of their first kiss. Jake contemplated the journey they had been doing together since that day, and the path that laid before them. On a beach, there was no predefine road, but the result was always the same. You got to the sea. \"I love you too,\" Jake whispered, a smile curving his lips and causing adorable dimples. She giggled and closed the short gap between them, catching him in a kiss. When she pulled away, she stayed close. Jake could feel her breath and rested his forehead on hers. \"You just kissed me,\" he stated, grinning boyishly. She gazed into his eyes with much care before replying, \"What if I did?\" A feeling of security flooded over him. They were on familiar turf, playing those all too familiar games of mischief. Maybe the unpredictable factor was the thing he cherished the most in Melanie's personality. Upon knowing that his life would be nothing but predictable, he looked forward to a tomorrow in his wife's soft arm… he was feeling pretty sober, though lightheaded. It was a strange sensation, really. \"I'd be tempted to kiss you again.\" Time seemed to release its grasp on them. A second of comfortable silence stretched to become an eternity. Previous problems were shrugged away. Nothing existed anymore. Nothing but them. She looked at him, her eyes holding the same spark Jake's held, heartbeat following his heart's racing pace. \"Honey, that's the deal,\" Mel reminded him, snaking her arms around his neck. Jake didn't need anymore encouragement. He bent down and pressed his mouth gently on Mel's soft lips. As the kiss deepened, Jake mused about silly and important things. \"I could reach the sky for you,\" the boy declared, earning himself an exasperated look. \"You suck. That's downright cheesy, Jake.\" Jake brushed it off, laughing instead. \"Eh, now that we're married, does that mean we're going to stay together all or life?\" His question caused Mel to untangle herself from Jake in order to fold her arms under her chest. \"Right. You were drunk through it.\" She took a solemn voice and reminded him, \"until death do us part.\" Another chuckle and her husband pulled her into his arms tenderly. \"That means you'll have to endure me forever.\" Melanie giggled and muttered something along the lines of \"shouldn't have signed that contract\", though she recovered her amusement fast. Sighing softly, she relaxed in his embrace and whispered her next words. The words were spoken low, but very sincerely. \"Yeah.

This Chapter is Dedicated to: Maroon 5 whose song title I stole for this fanfic! Jake sat in his plane seat, flicking the stub of his boarding pass with his forefinger, seriously wondering whether he was doing the right thing. True, he had left it six years so hopefully he would be able to have at least a civilised conversation with her. If it had not been for his Mum, Stella, he seriously wondered if he would be sitting here right now speeding towards the Big Apple and the girl he loved. Melanie Smooter. He had thought about her every moment of everyday since he was ten and these past six years had been agony for him - looking at photos of her just was not the same somehow. Jake never blamed anyone except himself: it had been all downhill since he had got her pregnant – the wedding had been a disaster and it had been him who had laid all that stress on her, causing her to miscarry their baby. She had fled then. She had only really been staying for the sake of the baby so when she no longer had that to worry about it was like she had been given a new lease of life. A life with no Jake Perry. How would she feel with Jake intruding on that new life? Jake had played the scene over and over in his head – the scene in which she was surprised to see him, then the awkward silence, then the apology, then the talk, then the kiss ....... It was what Stella, Bobby Ray, Lurlynn, Wade, Dorothea, Clinton and everyone had told him was going to happen, but Jake was not so sure. He knew Melanie; he knew it was not going to be that easy. \"All you can do is try, love.\" Stella had said to him at the airport. Jake ran a hand through his hair. The next few days were going to be interesting. \"And this is my apartment.\" announced Melanie Carmichael swinging open the door of her flat and looking at her boyfriend Andrew Hennings expectantly. \"Wow.\" Andrew said looking around. \"You've really made it home.\" he smiled, his eyes darting over the many photo frames she had on the walls. \"Yeah,\" she smiled. Andrew examined a couple of the pictures in the frames. \"For someone who hates her home so much, you sure like being reminded of Alabama.\" \"Yeah,\" sighed Melanie. She did not really want to get onto the topic of home, Alabama and all that meant. \"Who's this?\" Andrew frowned, pointing a t a figure in a photo. \"Oh, that's Jake.\" Melanie said, her insides shrinking. \"He's my friend.\" \"You sure have a lot of photos of him.\" Andrew said, struggling to keep the jealousy from his voice. He really liked Melanie but the only thing he did not understand was her reluctance to talk about her past. Melanie gave a nervous laugh. \"Come on Andrew, he's no one to be jealous of.\" she said, grabbing his hand and dragging him to the sofa. \"Hey! I'm not jea-\" Andrew started to argue but trailed off as Melanie drew him into a kiss. \"You know, we could take this into the bedroom....\" Andrew said looking deep into Melanie's eyes and holding her hands. Melanie looked away. She had only been with one guy and that had been the guy she had been in love with for ten years so with Andrew there was no way she felt ready. \"Andrew, we've only been going out for two weeks and-\" she said quietly. \"Hey yeah, I understand.\" Andrew said quickly before standing up. \"I think I better go.\" he said, leaning over and giving Melanie a quick peck on the cheek. \"Oh, you don't need to go.\" Melanie said hurriedly, cursing the ensuing awkwardness. \"No, no I should.\" Andrew said, picking up his jacket. \"Mum wants me up at the Plaza early to open an exhibition.\" he said rolling his eyes. Melanie smiled. \"I'll see you tomorrow.\" \"Yeah, I'll come and pick you up from work.\" Andrew said, drawing Melanie into a final kiss before leaving.\" Melanie closed the door with a smile. She had not been this happy in such a long time. She was finally doing what she wanted – she had a job that she loved and a boyfriend who loved her. She could hardly believe that a few years ago she was satisfied with a small hut and a simple guy who worked in a tyre factory when now she was going out with the son of the Mayor of New York! Melanie headed into the bathroom and settled on having a nice long hot shower. Half an hour later, she had used up all the hot water and dried herself on a fluffy white towel before putting on a black spaghetti top and some tracksuit bottoms. Drying her hair she headed towards the lounge to maybe watch a film............... \"JAKE!\" Melanie screamed in shock at the sight of her husband sitting on the sofa, smiling at her. \"Surprise!\" Jake said feebly and grinning lopsidedly. Melanie just stared at him speechless. After six years of not seeing each other she had definitely not imagined their first meeting to be like this. She looked at him. As much as she hated to admit it, Jake looked really good. He had undone the top few buttons of his Calvin Klein shirt and wore some expensive aftershave. He had obviously worked out and kept fit since she had last him, and his looks were chiselled and he still had that cute smile and beautiful eyes which had always made Melanie weak at the knees. In his hands Jake held a beautiful bunch of flowers; suddenly a tinsy bit of guilt rose in Melanie's stomach as she thought of Andrew. Jake watched as Melanie looked at him in shock and slowly take him in. She had changed a lot since he had last seen her. Most noticeable was her accent and then her hair. She had cut it and it now hung just under her ears. She obviously took care of herself now, not going out without makeup on and her nails neatly polished........ \"How did you get in?\" Melanie asked, still in shock. \"Oh, well when you didn't reply to the buzzer, Mrs Hubbard from next door let me in.\" Jake explained. \"Who did you tell her you were?\" Melanie asked urgently. Jake's heart twitched. \"I said I was an old friend.\" Melanie relaxed. \"You know, I was quite surprised to see 'Melanie Carmichael' on the entry phone.\" Jake said, raising his eyebrows. Melanie turned away and started to tidy away some magazines from the coffee table. \"I've made a new life for me here Jake and with that came a new name. I'm a fashion designer now and I'm working on my own fashion show at the moment.\" she explained. \"Oh, it's easy as that is it? You just walk away from your old life and start a new one whenever it suits you.\" Jake said airily. Melanie turned on him. \"And who made me leave Jake?! Who's fault was that?\" she said angrily. \"What are you doing here anyway?\" she asked, glaring at him. Jake looked away. He did not feel like telling her about his new business and his new life. Somehow it realised that it would not make much difference – she was obviously happy here. \"So I can't even visit my wife now?\" \"I'm not your wife Jake. At least I wouldn't be if you just signed the papers.\" Melanie said, irritated. \"I'm surprised. You're young and handsome, surely there's some girls down there who would want you free and single.\" she added, trying to calm down. Jake shrugged. \"I don't sign anything I don't want to sign Mel.\" he said. \"Why not? PLEASE sign them. It's hanging over my life like a black cloud and every time I see Andrew I have to feel like I'm hiding something-\" \"Who's Andrew?\" Jake asked quietly. Silence. Melanie met his gaze shiftily. Now it came to it she realised how much it would hurt Jake saying this. He had obviously made an effort tonight, still in love with her and she was going about all selfish talking about her life – and her new boyfriend. \"He's the guy I'm seeing.\" she said. \"Oh.\" Jake said heavily, standing up and throwing the flowers onto the table. \"I'm sorry Jake. I thought you got the message when I kept on sending you the divorce papers. I've moved on – a new life, a new start, and Andrew's really great. He's the Mayor's son and he can give me so many things.....\" \"Yeah, so many things that some idiotic loafer who works in a tyre factory back home couldn't.\" Jake said, finishing her sentence. \"That's not what I meant.\" Melanie said. Jake shrugged. \"Sure it was. I never was good enough for you Mel. I never could give you what you wanted. I was just the first guy you kissed – nothing more.\" Jake said, looking at Melanie sadly. Melanie looked at him and shook her head. \"No Jake, you were more than that. Back then, you were this wonderful guy who I was in love with. But now things have changed and-\" \"Yeah, I get the picture.\" Jake said. \"Give me the pen then.\" he said resignedly. \"What?\" Melanie asked distractedly as he dragged her out of her childhood memories. \"I'll sign the papers.\" he said simply. Melanie looked at him closely. \"You will?\" \"Yeah, give them here.\" Jake said, sitting down again and flicking through the wad of papers Melanie held out to him. As he took up the pen, Melanie noticed that he wore his wedding ring –something which he had hated to do when she was still back home. He was always complaining that it got in the way and made him feel like he was an old man etc. \"Wow, you've still got it.\" she said quietly, reaching over and running her hand over it. \"Yeah, of course.\" \"You never liked wearing it before.\" \"I've never taken it off since the day you left.\" Jake said, looking at it. \"Guess I will do now.\" he said, smiling grimly, nodding at the papers. Awkward silence. \"How's the tyre factory?\" Melanie asked. Jake shrugged. \"Dunno. I left a long time ago.\" \"What?\" Melanie asked, surprised. \"Yeah, I've started my own business and it's doing quite well.\" Jake smiled. \"What in?\" Melanie asked curiously. Jake looked at her deeply, debating whether to tell her, whether it would make any difference now he had signed the papers. He looked away and got ready to leave. \"It doesn't matter. It's all in your past now.\" he said handing her back the papers. \"See you Mel.\" he said, before walking out the door. Melanie looked down at the papers then at the closed door. Now she had got what she wanted, she felt strangely empty. A/N:- So what do you think? Please review!

He thought he'd be able to get his business sufficiently off the ground before she found someone new. He kept up with her, whether she knew it or not, and he'd thought he was safe. He'd almost succeeded and now it was too late. She'd come back and turned his entire world upside down, and now he had to stand by while she married another man. He wanted to pretend that it no longer mattered; that he didn't care, but that was a tall order. All he'd ever done was care about Melanie. It was all he could ever remember doing. Jake laid his poor, confused wife down on the bed, and glanced around her room. Her parents had never changed a thing. He saw her purse at the end of the bed, on the floor, and picking it up, he pulled her precious divorce papers from it. He sighed. This was it. It looked like he'd finally have to give her what she wanted. That's what killed him. Everything he'd worked so hard for would mean nothing, cause it had all been for her. He just wanted Mel to be happy, but he wanted her to be happy with him. But there were just some dreams that would never come true, and he had to accept that. Jake pulled her little-girl desk chair over beside the bed, sat down, and pulled her fancy pen out of his shirt pocket. He quickly scrawled his name on all three copies, took one, and laid the others beside Melanie's stubborn, sleeping head. He had no idea what he'd do now. He'd spent the last seven years plotting and planning to win her back, and he'd have to get used to life without that goal. A life where he'd lost her forever. Jake brushed the hair out of Melanie's face, because he knew how it always tickled her nose. Used to, anyway. Unexpectedly, she opened her eyes and smiled slightly at him. Her face was buried halfway in the pillow, and she made no move to get up. \"I loved you, you know,\" she said so softly he barely heard her. But he heard enough to tell it was slurred. She'd just begun to sleep this off. \"I know, darlin',\" he said, drawing his hand away from her face, and placing it over her hand. \"I've always loved you - my whole life,\" she said, a catch in her now small voice as she started to cry. He clasped her hand tighter. He couldn't do this, and especially not while she was drunk. \"Shhh, honey, go back to sleep.\" He wiped the tears from her face as she closed her eyes again. \"I've never stopped loving you,\" she mumbled as she drifted back to sleep. Jake just shook his head. \"You were always stubborn, Mel,\" he whispered. He knew she wouldn't remember telling him any of that in the morning, and that she'd never admit it sober. She'd take her divorce papers back to New York City, marry her fancy schmancy boyfriend, and go on with her life. Because that was the path she had chosen and was determined to stay on, and Melanie almost always got what she wanted. Almost.

Just give me a lap.\" \"C'mon, Des.\" I smiled, starting to jog around the field. \"Remind me why none of the other groups run with their people!\" Wendy called, catching up to me. \"Because we're a team-well part of one-and so we'll do things as a team.\" I replied. \"Oh, is that why we all seem to have our periods at the same time?!\" Maeyella called, running in the back next to Destiny. \"Mae!\" \"Well, it could be true, Adrien.\" Wendy, Ashlee and Destiny laughed. \"You girls need to hurry it up!\" Coach yelled. \"Let's add four laps! Sit ups and push-ups in between!\" \"Yes, Coach!\" We yelled back. We all began to jog a little faster. When we got back around to where Coach was, we got in push-up position. \"Five each, except for Destiny, she gets ten.\" Anyone who didn't know the team would think Coach gave Des ten push-ups because she hit him with the ball, but he actually gave her ten because she's the back-up goalie. \"Fifteen each, girls?\" I asked, looking at them. \"Sure.\" \"Count 'em out.\" \"1...2...3...4...5...6...7...8...9...10...11...12...13...14...15!\" We counted together. \"Twenty sit-ups.\" Coach added before going to check on another group. \"C'mon girls, let's get 'em over with.\" Wendy groaned, flipping over onto her back. \"1...2...3...4...5...6...7...8...9...10...11...12...13...14...15...16...17...18...19...20!\" We got to our feet and continued with our laps. In between each lap, we did fifteen push-ups and twenty sit-ups. When we were finished, Coach gave us our soccer ball back. \"Try not to hit me at least until next week. Okay, Destiny?\" \"Yes Coach.\" Destiny replied sheepishly, taking the soccer ball from Coach. Wendy patted her back. \"All right ladies, you have half an hour 'til you're free to leave!\" \"Coach Tracker, can I have a word?\" Principle Mason called from the other side of the field. Coach jogged over. \"Hey, goal's free.\" Maeyella pointed out. \"Should we practice our goals?\" \"Definitely.\" I said. \"Hey, Des, pass me the ball.\" Ashlee laughed, jogging towards the goal. Destiny passed Ashlee the ball before running to the goal. \"Aim for her head, Ash!\" Maeyella joked. Ashlee, Mae, Wendy and I each attempted five goals before switching. Wendy played goalie next, then Ashlee, then Mae and I went last. I knew they were gonna go hard on me; I played hard on each of them. \"Destiny, you go first.\" Ashlee pushed Destiny forward. Destiny is known for having unpredictable kicks. They don't always go the way she plans. Destiny kicked the ball. She was aiming left but it came straight towards me. I caught it and threw it back. \"Ugh.\" Destiny aimed right, and it went right. She aimed left, went right. Aimed center, went center. Aimed center, hit me in the head. \"Sorry, Ien.\" Destiny smiled apologetically as she ran up to me. Maeyella, Wendy and Ashlee were sitting on the ground, breathless from laughter. \"Perry, what's wrong with your face?\" Rebecca called from her group. \"Destiny kicked!\" Wendy laughed. \"Oh.\" \"I'm so sorry, Adrien. I guess I kicked it harder than I meant. I was a little fed up.\" Destiny shook her head. \"I am fed up. I can hardly ever get a goal to go the way I want. I've been playing soccer for a long time too.\" \"Don't worry, Des. You just have to focus.\" I laughed. Destiny's face softened into a smile. \"I guess you're right.\" \"Thank you. Now, are you three going to try?\" \"No, we're fine.\" Mae was lying on the ground, holding her sides. \"Get up, Mae.\" We just played around with the ball until Coach blew his whistle. \"Bring it in!\" Each group kicked their balls to Coach before running over to him. \"All right. Nice practice. See you tomorrow afternoon.\" All the girls look at each other, looks of slight confusion on their faces. I thought someone was going to say something, but no one did. So I guess it's up to me. \"Coach, tomorrow's Saturday.\" \"Wha-oh. Oh, yes. See you girls Monday.\" \"Bye Coach!\" All the girls were gone within ten minutes, except for me and Mae. \"Hey girlies.\" \"Hi, Jacob.\" We smiled as our friend, Jacob Hensin, walked up to us, just having finished his soccer practice too. \"Waiting long have you?\" \"Twenty minutes. You?\" \"Same.\" \"I told Caryn that practice ended at 3:30 today.\" \"She never listens, Ien. I'll walk you two girls home.\" \"You live right around us; it's not exactly out of your way.\" Mae scoffed. \"Just shut up and grab your crap.\" Jacob smiled at us. \"Such a gentleman.\" I laughed. \"As long as that's what your Pop thinks.\" \"As long as you're nicer than those creeps, he'll have no problem with you.\" I laughed. \"My dad doesn't care.\" Mae smiled. \"He has this delusional fantasy that I'll marry Jacob.\" \"Oh, Buttercup, you told him!\" Jacob pouted. \"Oh shush.\" \"I wish my car worked.\" Jacob sighed. \"Us too.\" I sighed, resting my hands on the top of my head. \"I wouldn't have to rely on the cheerleader .\" \"Ah, just wait, she'll be out of here soon enough!\" Mae said, not bothering to hide her excitement. \"Hold on a sec'...I think that's my Uncle Bobby Ray.\" I squinted as to get a better look at the back of the guy in front of us. Sure enough, he turned around when I said this. \"Bobby Ray!\" \"How's my favorite Goddaughter?\" Bobby Ray asked, waiting for us to catch up. \"Pretty good, seeing as how I'm your only Goddaughter.\" I replied, smiling. \"Details. Wasn't Caryn supposed to pick you up?\" \"Like she listens, Bobby Ray.\" Mae answered. \"That would be a good reason.\" Bobby Ray sighed. \"Well, I got to get to the bank, so I'll let you go. As rude as that may be.\" \"See you later, Bobby Ray.\" I waved, as he ran across the street and into the bank. \"I still think he's an odd man.\" Jacob laughed, shaking his head. \"Adrien?\" Mae called as I stared up at the darkening sky. \"Let's go. I wanna swim in the lake while it rains.\" \"You got it.\" Jacob said, giving me a small push forward. We didn't run, knowing that the clouds were just rolling in. The rain wouldn't be to the lake until we got home. But that didn't stop us from walking quickly. We didn't speak until we were sure we were only minutes away from home. \"Ouch!\" \"Jacob, how many times do you forget that branch?\" Mae asked, hands on her hips. \"Just about every time I walk.\" Jacob replied, rubbing his eye. \"Guys, let's go! The rains almost here!\" I called, pointing to the sky as lightning lit the sky. \"Jacob go change and meet us on the dock.\" \"Sure thing, ladies.\" Jacob ran to his house, down a ways from my house, while Mae and I ran to mine. \"Hi Momma. Hi Daddy.\" I called running into the house, I quickly gave both parents a kiss on the cheek before running to my room. Mae followed quickly after hugging my parents and saying, \"Hey Uncle Jake, Aunt Melanie.\" \"Hey, Where's your sister?\" my dad asked, knocking on the door. \"I don't know, Daddy. She didn't pick me up.\" I replied, quickly changing into my swim suit. Mae found one of the many pairs she left in my room and changed in my bathroom. \"What do you mean she didn't pick you up?\" Momma asked as Mae and I left my room. \"Put some shorts on over that!\" Daddy called. \"And answer your momma.\" \"Exactly what I said, Momma, she didn't pick me up. Me and Mae were waiting for twenty minutes before Jacob offered to walk us home.\" I said, ignoring what Daddy had said. \"Adrien, shorts, now.\" Daddy called again, turning me to face my room. \"Yes, Daddy.\" I grabbed a pair of my soccer shorts before walking out of my room. \"I would probably just be leaving now if I had decided to wait for her. I would've just noticed the clouds now.\" \"Please put your shorts on. And Mae, I would feel better if you put some on too.\" I gave Mae my shorts and went to get another pair. \"Did you call your sister?\" Momma asked. \"No, I didn't, Momma.\" I sighed pulling my shorts over my swimsuit bottoms. It had started raining already. The whole town would be wet in a few seconds. \"She doesn't answer when I call her.\" Momma was about to say something when the door banged open. Bryan, who had been snoozing quietly on my bed until this point, came bounding out of my room, howling at my sister, who stood in the doorway, drenched. \"Shut up, Bryan!\" Mae and I snapped. \"YOU!\" Caryn yelled, pointing at me. \"Me.\" \"You owe me new clothes, a new purse and you're going to get the inside of my car fixed!\" Caryn screamed, slamming the door behind her. \"What happen to your car?\" Daddy yelled. \"I couldn't get the top up and it got wet in the rain!\" \"None of this would have happened if you had picked me up on time!\" I yelled at Caryn. \"But you got what you deserved. C'mon, Mae.\" Mae walked of the house before me. My hand was still on the door when Caryn spoke again. \"Do something! Ground her!\" \"Ground me?!\" I roared, wheeling around to look at her. \" Ground me ?! You are the one who didn't pick me up on time!\" \"You're practice ends at 4, same as mine.\" \"You didn't have practice today, Caryn.\" Momma said. \"You knew my practice ended early today.\" \"I did not.\" Caryn growled. \"This is all your fault.\" \"Momma, you heard me tell her yesterday! You said that she had to pick me up at 3:30.\" \"Don't put your Momma in the middle of this.\" Daddy snapped. \"I'm not!\" I screamed. \"You know what?! Just ground me, take away my allowance! Whatever will make princess happy! Just like you always do!\" I slammed the door behind me and walked down to the dock by Mae's house. Jacob and Mae, were sitting on the dock, waiting for me. \"Sorry guys.\" \"Just get in the water before it stops raining!\" Jacob smiled, pushing me into the lake. Mae laughed until Jacob picked her up and jumped in. \"Jacob Quinten Hensin!\" Mae yelled, breaching the surface. Jacob smiled and dunked her. \"Oh quit trying to drown her, Jacob.\" \"Sorry, babycakes.\"[Chapter 2] \"It's like we're getting a massage!\" \"Almost. It feels like soft acupuncture.\" \"And how do you know what acupuncture feels like, Ien?\" Jacob asked. \"My mom's friend up in New York took me and the cheerleader to get it once. We were feudin', as usual, and she said it would calm us down.\" \"Did it?\" Mae laughed. \"Kinda. We were lil' then. I was 'knee-high to a grasshopper', even though I was six.\" \"You're still short.\" \"Shut up, Jacob.\" \"How'd it go?\" \"The cheerleader was too scared to get it. I didn't let it go. I still haven't.\" I chuckled. \"Ain't cha never seen me chase it around with a needle before?!\" \"I never knew why'da do it. Mind if I join ya?\" \"Not at all. You can too Jacob.\" I didn't mind being mean to my sister, or letting my friends be mean to her. \"When do you think the rain's going to stop?\" Jacob asked. \"I reckon it's been going for an hour. Probably soon.\" \"Coming to my house afterward?\" Mae asked, floating by. \"No.\" \"And why not?\" \"You have an essay to write.\" \"Oh.\" \"You can hang with me, Ien. Mom bought popcorn.\" \"And what about your essay, Jacob?\" \"Finished it yesterday, thank you.\" \"Your house it is. Think your Ma will mind?\" \"'Course not, she loves you girls.\" Jacob said as the last rain drops hit the lake water. \"Time to go ladies.\" \"Bye bye, Mae. Work hard!\" I called to her as she left us at Jacob's house. \"Shut up!\" Mae called back, holding her fists in fighting position. After about an hour of beating Jacob at Chess and Checkers, I heard Daddy calling for me. \"Adrien Perry! Time to come on home! Dinner's ready!\" \"Well, looks like I have to go home, Jacob.\" I laughed as he packed his Chess set away. \"Hurry, now, before he uses your middle name.\" Jacob smiled. \"Wouldn't that be embarrassing.\" I joked as I walked off his porch. \"Bye Jacob, I'll see you later.\" \"What's for dinner?\" Mae asked, meeting me and Daddy on our porch. Daddy laughed. \"I thought I was only calling Adrien.\" \"Oh, but you forgot the law of calling out, Uncle Jake.\" Mae smiled, opening the door. \"Oh? What's that?\" \"If you call it out and Mae and Jacob hear you, they're welcome to free dinner.\" I answered. \"Ain't that right, Momma?\" \"As long as you and your sister don't fight.\" Momma sighed, setting an extra place for Mae. \"Deal, Aunt Melanie.\" Mae answers right away. \"What are we having? I can smell the desert already.\" \"You and your nose, Mae.\" Momma chuckled. \"We're having roast beef, mashed potatoes and corn. You already know what's for desert. Just don't tell your Uncle Jake.\" \"Apple pie.\" Mae whispers out of the corner of her mouth, leaning over to my ear as Daddy pouted at Momma. \"One of his favorites.\" I smiled back, watching Daddy sit down facing the kitchen. \"Wonderful dinner, Momma!\" I exclaimed, setting my fork down as I finished the last of my potatoes. \"You should cook dinner at my house.\" Mae commented, getting one last spoonful of corn. \"So much better than my mom's.\" \"Thank you, Mae. But don't let me hear you tellin' your momma that.\" Momma smiled, going into the kitchen, dirty plates in her arms. She closed the panel door behind her when she saw Daddy trying to see the desert. \"There's no point, Mae, you eat over here more than you eat at home.\" Daddy laughed. \"This is how we get rid of her, Daddy.\" I said seriously, earning a push from Mae. \"Never in your life.\" \"Oh, yeah. Once I sell you to Jacob and he makes you his wife, lawfully wedded or not, and he moves you to Guam. I'll never have to see you again.\" \"Oh you'll see me all the time, because he's buying you too and-\" \"You two are so annoying.\" Caryn interrupted, a look that made me want to slap her, crossed her face. \"Thank you! I never knew you cared!\" I exclaimed, clapping my hands together over my heart and batting my eyelashes. \"Oh shut up.\" She snapped. \"You might as well go count out the money you owe me for my car, purse and clothes.\" \"Oh, I don't-\" I was cut off by Daddy. \"She's not paying.\" Daddy said calmly, taking a drink of his water. Caryn looked pissed. \"What do you mean 'she's not paying'?!\" \"Your Momma and I discussed it; Adrien's not paying. If you had picked her up on time, you would be fine.\" Daddy replied. I highly doubt that she would be 'fine'. \"Go help your Momma in the kitchen.\" \"But Dad-\" \"Go help your Momma in the kitchen.\" Daddy repeated firmly. Mae and I fist bumped under the table. \"That's why I wasn't in trouble when I came home.\" I laughed. \"Here you go, honey.\" Momma smiled, setting a plate with a slice of apple pie in front of Daddy, who grinned. \"Maebell, my dear!\" Jacob sang, bounding into Mae's bedroom. \"Jacob, it's nine in the morning. On a Saturday.\" Mae groaned, throwing her pillow at his face. I just groaned, curled up into a little ball and pulled the covers over my head. Mae and I hadn't gone to bed until 5 or so. \"That's why I'm here!\" \"Jacob... either shut up and lay down, or go home!\" I yawned. \"Then scoot over, ladies, I'm laying down.\" Jacob replied, crawling over Mae and laying between her and I. Mae has a huge bed, so this is completely normal for us. \"Take your shoes off, odd-ball.\" Mae yawned, turning on her tv with her remote. \"Only if we can watch 'I Love Lucy'.\" \"No problem.\" I said, taking the remote from Mae. \"Shoes. Off.\" Mae ordered Jacob, leaning out of bed to grab her pillow. \"You know, three people in a room without shoes is considered an orgy.\" Jacob smirked. \"That's barefooted, Jacob. You're wearing socks, therefore no orgy.\" I laughed. \"Ooh, someone sounds like they know what they're talking about.\" Jacob teased, poking my stomach. \"Do we have to have... the talk , Adrien?\" Mae asked, quite seriously. I shook my head. \"No, sir.\" I replied. Soon, 'I Love Lucy' started and the bed was shaking from our tremendous laughter. \"What's this?\" Jacob asked, picking something that he apparently just kicked up. \"It's our school year book from fourth grade.\" Mae smiled, turning it over. \"Adrien found it last night and we were going through it. Stirs up the ol' memories, don't it?\" \"Sure does.\" Jacob muttered, flipping through it. \"Oh gosh, look at all these ridiculous haircuts.\" \"I know, in hindsight, it seems that everybody had a mullet in elementary school but us.\" I smiled, Mae and I looking at the yearbook on both sides of Jacob. \"Or their heads were shaved. Man, what will those nosey yanks think of us when they get their hands on this?\" \"That we have great fashion sense.\" Jacob grinned. \"Oh Lord, look at Henry Fallow's coveralls!\" Mae squealed, pointing at the kid's third grade picture. \"He dresses like that every picture day.\" Jacob commented. \"Such a dorky freshman.\" \"Look! Benjamin Dell! I love that boy!\" I gasped, seeing the familiar picture at the beginning of the fourth grade pictures. \"I almost forgot about him.\" Mae whispered. \"It seems like forever ago that he moved away.\" \"He was our fourth Musketeer...\" Jacob added. \"I wonder what's happened to him.\" \"I'm sure he's fine. You know how stubborn Ben was.\" I giggled. \"Almost as bad as us.\" \"Almost.\" Mae and Jacob agreed, smiling deviously. \"Okay, I take that back, he wasn't nearly that bad.\" I sighed, rolling my eyes playfully. \"Afternoon, Daddy.\" I smiled, giving him a kiss on the cheek. \"Afternoon, Ien.\" Daddy looked up from the tv. \"Bobby Ray's on his way over.\" \"I hope he takes me out, I don't want to be cooped up for too long.\" I yawned, sitting on the couch next to Daddy. \"You just spent almost an entire day inside Mae's house.\" \"That's different, Daddy, I adjust to her house and it's not quite so bad. I'm used to this house, it hardly is interesting.\" \"Don't tell your momma that.\" Bobby Ray laughed, letting himself in. He shook hands with my Daddy and sat next to me on the couch. \"Where's the wife and oldest child?\" \"Shopping.\" Daddy and I answered. \"Caryn's under the impression that she needs a new dress for homecoming.\" Daddy sighed, taking a drink of his beer. \"Of course she is.\" I commented off-handedly. Daddy didn't say anything to me, probably because Momma wasn't around. \"How's Caryn going to pay for the inside of her car if she's spending her money on clothes?\" \"The bank of 'Please Daddy?' is how.\" I answered. \"Her account is closed.\" Daddy said. \"Broke, tapt out, out of business, whatever.\" \"But mine's not, is it?\" \"No, your's is collecting interest. Ask about your account at the bank of 'Pretty Please Bobby Ray?', sweetheart.\" \"Oh, that bank went out of business today. Sorry, darlin'.\" Bobby Ray laughed as I pouted.

An hour later, \"Holly?\" Melanie asked walking into her daughter's bedroom to find boxes still unopened and her daughter staring out of her bedroom window listening to her IPod. \"Holly,\" Melanie repeated tapping her daughter on the shoulder. Holly spun around and grudgingly took her ea-phones out of her ears. \"Yeah?\" she asked. \"Honey, I know you don't want to be here.

Well, yore gonna get some now. \" \"I won't go!\" I said. \"Don't you talk back to mom like that.\" Jake said comin' in. \"I ain't in yore house yet, so I don't have'ta listen to ya.\" I said tossin' my short brown hair. Mama sighed. \"Jake, I just cain't do nothin' with her! She won't listen to me, she runs off all the time and don't come back 'til late, or early. She's been skippin' school, and with me workin' more hours, I just can't handle it. \" \"Don't worry Mom.\" Jake said. \"I'll take care of her.\" He said in a tone that left no doubt that he would. Well, I didn't care, first, my dad ran out on me, when i was ten, and Jake up 'n married Melanie when they was eighteen. The men in my family had done nothin' but desert me. My dad showed his love for me alright, a card every birthday, and child support. While Jake, well... lets say Jake kinda drew up into himself when Mel left him coupla years back. Now here we are, me sixteen, and him twenty five, with nothin' but the family name , and some childhood memories to remind us we was brother and sister. \"c'mon Becky lets go.\" Jake said hoistin' my duffel back up over his shoulder. \"I'll come when I'm good an' ready!\" I said. \"You'll come right now or you'll have my belt to deal with that smart mouth of yours.\" He said. I knew he meant it, so I followed him out to his pickup. \"Bye honey.\" Mom said huggin' me. \"If ya forgot anything just come an' get it. I ain't kickin' ya out, I just want you to have some stable influence for awhile. Ok?\" \"Whatever.\" I said gettin' in the truck and slammin' the door.\"Now listen to your brother alright?\" she called as we drove off. I slid down in the seat so I could barely see over the steerin' wheel. \"Put yer seatbelt on.\" Jake ordered. I glanced over. \"You ain't got yours on.\" I said. \"I don't care, just do it!\" \"No!\" I said, sittin' up straight to prepare for battle. Jake slammed on the brakes. \"Now, I don't know what you gotta away with with mama, but you ain't gonna get away with smartin' off at me. You'll do as your told, or you'll be eatin' standin' up for a day or two. Got it?\" \"Yeah whatever.\" I said, jerkin' the seat belt on. \"Don't ya ' Yeah Whatever' me. \"He said angrily, drivin' up the driveway to his house. \"You'll say yes sir.\" I snorted. \"Jake, I ain't sayin' yes sir ta you anymore than I'm gonna stay in yore house.\" I said defiently. \"As soon as you go ta bed, I'm leavin'!\" I said. He pulled up into the driveway , jerked his key out, and came around my side of the truck. He pulled the door open, and me out. Then he headed for the house, pullin' me along behind him. \"I see I'm gonna have to start out by showin' you I mean business. \" he said. He dragged me onto the porch and in the front door into the livin' room. Then he pushed me down on the couch. I sat back angrily, pretty sure I knew what was about to happen. But I wasn't goin' to cry, I was gonna grit my teeth and take it. Jake unbuckled his belt and pulled it through the loops in his jeans. \"Stand up.\" He ordered. I didn't move. I could see him grittin' his teeth in anger. \"Rebecca Lynn if ya don't get up now I'll-\" \"You'll what?\" I inquired sweetly. Jake grabbed my arm and hauled me up, then he pulled me around to the back of the couch. I remembered this routine from when dad used ta still live with us. \"Drop yore jeans!\" Jake said. I unbuttoned and unzipped, and I pushed'em down past my knees. \"Now bend over the couch.\" I leaned over the back of the couch, and braced my hands on the seat. Jake put his hand on the small of my back, and pulled the belt back. \"D'ya realize what a pain ya've been to mama?\" THWACK. \"Skippin' school.\" THWACK. \"Sneakin' out at night. \"THWACK.\" Ignorin'her.\" THWACK. \"D'ya know what that woman has gone through ta raise ya? \" THWACK THWACK THWACK. I was squeezin' my eyes shut to hold back the tears, and grittin' my teeth ta keep from yellin'. \"If Daddy was here would ya be actin' like this?\" THWACK. \"No ya wouldn't, cause ya knew\" THWACK. \"He'd take a belt to ya anytime ya needed it.\" THWACK. \"And my guess is.\" THWACK. \" That ya miss that.\" He finally stopped. I reached down and pulled up my pants, and turned around . I wouldn't look Jake in the eye 'cause then he'd know how right he was. I did miss havin' a man around the house, to make me do what I knew was right. Someone that cared enough not to let me do everything I wanted. Dad had left me, and I thought Jake had left me, but maybe...just maybe he hadn't. Jake lifted my chin up with his finger. I looked straight into his cool blue eyes. \"Now Becky,\" He said softly. \"I love ya gal! And ya know, maybe I hadn't been there for ya like I shoulda been, but I aim ta be there now. Kay?\" I nodded. He pulled me into a hug. \"Now lets get ya settled a'right?\" He ran outside to get my bag. I made myself breathe. I was havin' a hard time with these emotions. Could Jake really care about me like he said? One whippin' don't prove nothin'! Dad had said the same exact things ta me that Jake said, you know all the' I love you and I'm doin' this for yore own good' kinda stuff, in fact, he said those same exact things ta me while punishin' me the day before he ran out on us. I sighed. \"C'mon.\" Jake said. \" I'll show ya your room.\" He said. He took me into his room, and up the stairs that sat against the far wall, into the attic, which he'd fixed up as a room. It had a pretty li'l white bed, and a dresser and vanity ta match. There where yellow curtains over the window, that matched the bedspread and carpet. \"Look here.\" Jake said pullin' the little yellow rug away. There was a trapdoor underneath it. \"This is another way out, in case of fire or whatever, it leads right into my room, so don't get any bright ideas about sneakin' out or nothin' \" \"Fine whatever!\" I said , then I caught Jake's eye. \"I mean yessir. \" Jake sat down on the bed while I was unpackin'. \"Now's as good'a time as any ta tell ya your new schedule.\"He said. \"Alright, you'll be up by six thirty- \" \"What?\" I interuppted. \"You're kiddin' right? Six thirty? \" \"No I ain't kiddin' yore gonna have chores, then we leave at seven thirty and I'll drop ya off at school on my way ta work. And you'll stay in school all day, I don't wanna hear 'bout ya skippin' again. Ya hear me?\" \"Yea- Yessir.\" I said , not meanin' it. \"You'll come home after school, do your homework, eat supper, maybe watch a little tv, then go ta bed. \" \"ohhh no ya don't!\" I said. \" I have friends ya know! We have plans! Ever heard of 'em? \" \"Don't sass me girl!\" Jake said. \"This is only for the first week, consider yourself grounded, 'til I can trust ya. \" \"Damn you!\" I hissed. \"An' no cussin' either!\" \"What is this? Military school?\" I demanded. \"You might wish it was if ya don't straighten up.\" He headed down the stairs.[Chapter 2] Jakes point of view I went downstairs listening to Becky slam stuff around her room. I don't know how she could have gotten this bad! I mean, Dad always kept us in line, and mom did her share to, or used to. She looked awfully tired when I picked Becky up. Maybe Dad leavin' hit her harder then I realized, I know she would have never let me get away with what Becky's been doin'. She'd'a taken a switch to me! I sighed. This wasn't going to be easy. I could see Becky didn't trust me, though I wasn't exactly sure why. I guess I prolly should've been there for her more after dad left, she needed a man in her life. But with Mel leavin' me, I guess I just sorta ignored her. Well, I was gonna have to make up for it now. I ran my fingers through my hair. There would probably be alot more whippin's before she realized I meant business, but that also meant I have ta show her I ain't just doin' it in anger, but outa love. It sure wasn't gonna be easy. I heard her comin' down the stairs. \"If I have to be up at the ungodly hour ya said, I guess I'd better go ta bed now.\" She said. \"That's a good idea.\" I said. \"Well G'night.\" She said, then she started up the stairs. \"Becky? \" \"Yeah?\" she stopped and turned to look at me. \"Love ya girl.\" She just looked at me, kinda sad, then she turned and ran upstairs. I went into the kitchen an' got a drink, then I went into my bedroom stripped down into my boxers, pulled on a pair of pajama pants, and climbed in bed. I turned off the lamp and settled down ta go to sleep. The house was quiet except for the occasional owl hootin'. Suddenly I heard somethin'. It was a muffled sobbin' sound, and it was comin' from Becky's room. I climbed out of bed and went quietly up the stairs. \"Becky?\" I whispered. No answer except a sniffle. \"Becky are ya alright?\" \"Jist g'way Jake.\" came the reply. \" I don't need ya.\" I walked in and sat on the edge of her bed. \"Well, like it or not, I'm here. Now when ya do decided ya need me, I'll be here baby.\" And with that I went back downstairs to my room. The next mornin' I woke up with my alarm it was six fifteen. \"Becky!\" I hollered up the stairs. \" S'bout time ta get up!\" No response. oh well, she still had fifteen minutes anyway. So I went and started cookin' some scrambled eggs and bacon. At six twenty-five I went to the edge of the stairs. \"Rebecca Perry, ya got five minutes ta get yore butt down here! Ya hear?\" \"Yah I'm comin'\" I heard. I headed satisfied into the kitchen. Becky came stumblin' in lookin' like she hadn't slept in a year. \"Here, eat somethin' \"I said dishin' her out some eggs. \"I don't eat breakfast.\" She shuddered. \"Well yore gonna today so eat. \" I said. \"Jake I ain't gonna eat this!\" She said pushin' her plate back. \"Food makes me sick in the mornin'! \" \"You'll be sick later if'n ya don't eat, 'sides yore brain don't wake up proper 'til ya eat. So get with it!\" \"God you're stubborn!\" She muttered. \"It runs in the family.\" I smiled. \"Now.\" I said. \"After breakfast, you'll do the dishes and straighten up your room, then I'll drop ya off at school. \" She put up no arguement, and by seven thirty, she was ready to go. She climbed into the pick-up with her backpack and buckled up. The trip to the school was a silent one. Neither of us said a word 'til we got to the school. \"D'ya want me ta pick ya up, or d'ya wanna ride the bus?\" I asked her. \"I'll ride the bus.\" She said quickly. \"A'right, see ya tonight then.\" I watched her go into the schoolbuildin' before I left. 2:30 in the afternoon, the same day. \"Jake!\" I looked up. I was in the workshop beside the house, but even from there I could see the flashin' blue lights. \"Wade, how many times have I told ya not ta drive up here with yore lights on.\" I said to my friend Wade, the sheriff. \"Well, this ain't jist a social call this time Jake.\" He said nervously. \"I wish it was but- \" \"What is it Wade? Spit it out!\" \"Well, I caught Becky'n' Mason Crawley down at th'beach, they was skippin' school. \" \"I'm gonna-\" \"That ain't all.\" Wade interuppted me. \"They was jist talkin', but they had some beer out there with'em. \" I was boilin' mad by this time. \"Where's she at?\" I asked angrily. Wade nodded to the patrol car. I stalked over there and opened the door'n' the back. Becky was sittin' there arms crossed, starin' straight ahead. \"Becky get out.\" I ordered, barely controllin' my anger. \"What for?\" she demanded. \"So ya can beat me again?\" \"Rebecca, ya know I didn't beat ya, I've never beat ya, but if'n you don't get outa there within the next ten seconds, I'm gonna do some serious considerin' on it!\" I guess she knew I was serious, so she climbed out. \"Get in the house an' wait fer me in the livin'room!\" I said. \"Fine!\" She said, i could smell the beer on her breath. She stormed up to the house and slammed the door. \"Wade, were they drunk?\" \"Naw, jist a little tipsy's all. \" \"Dang girl!\" I slammed my hand down on the hood of Wade's car. \"Ya know I think that girls hurtin' still from yore pa leavin' ya. \"So what? I'm still hurt from him and Mel leavin' me, do I just go off an' get drunk? \" I exclaimed. Wade looked down at his fee and scratched the back of his neck t. \"Alright!\" I exloded,\"So I did it once or twice. I'm twenty five, and she's sixteen!\" \"Yah, I know.\" Wade said. \"I ain't sayin' she shouldn't get her butt beat, just lettin' ya know what I think's wrong s'all. \" \"Well, thanks Wade.\" I said. \"Do me a favor, and don't tell mama 'bout this, she don't need nothin' else worryin' her. \"Not a word.\" Wade said gettin' in his car. \" Catch ya later.\" Then he left. I stood there for a minute, tryin' to get rid of some of my anger before I went in to deal with Becky. I knew if I went in as angry as I was, I might end up hurtin' her, and that was the last thing I wanted. I counted to ten and breathed in slowly. \"Wa'll Bear,\" I said pattin' my big old hound. \"No use puttin' off what has ta be done.\" I walked into the house. Becky was sittin' on the couch, arms folded 'cross her chest, and her feet up on the table. \" Git yore feet down!\" I said. She didn't move. \"Rebecca. Do. It. Now. \" I said. She didn't do nothin'. My anger rushed back. \"Rebecca Lynn, I swear if it takes me beatin' you to kingdom come, yore gonna learn to obey!\" I said through clenched teeth. I walked back behind the couch. \"C'mon.\" I ordered. \"Listen Jake Perry! \" she said turning so she could see me. \"If you think I'm gonna come like a good little girl, ya got another thing comin' !\" I thought about going over there and draggin' her, but I decided against it. \"Alright.\" I said, more calmly then I felt. \" You either come over here and take your medicine, or we'll skip this and go out to my shed and use Daddy's old strap. I saw her start at this. When I was 'bout sixteen, me'n' Melanie skipped school and went out an' did some things that my daddy wasn't happy 'bout. He'd jerked my britches down, grabbed that strap, and laid into me like it was his mission in life. That was one of the worst whuppin's I ever got, and even though Becky was only seven, she remembered. She'd always been afraid of that strap ever since then. I had run over and picked it up from Mama's after droppin' Becky off at school, cause I figured it might help me out a little. And I was right. She got up slowly an' walked 'round the couch, dropped her jeans, and bent over. I placed me hand on her back, and laid into her good. This time she broke down. \"Jake, please stop.\" she sobbed. \"I ...I won't do it again.\" I gave her two more whacks, then stopped. I pulled her pants up and picked her up. I walked over the the couch and set down, with her in my lap. She sat there cryin' \"It's alright baby girl.\" I said pullin' her into a hug. \"it's alright.\" I stroked her hair. She finally started to relax in my arms. She snuggled up to my chest still cryin' softly. \"I..I'm sorry I disobeyed ya Jake.\" She gulped. \" I just...\" \"Ya just what?\" I asked. \"Nothin'\" she said pullin' away. \"I\"m sorry's all.\" She stood up. \"Becky ya know I might understand.\" I said. \"No you wouldn't .' she said bitterly. \"No one does.\" She took off up the stairs and into her room. I sighed. Right back where I'd started. At least she'd opened up a little. Maybe Bobby Ray could help, he'd always been Becky's favorite of my friends. I just might try him.

Unbeta'd. Enjoy. :) As he pushed the teacher into the store cupboard, Dakin suddenly became aware of the close proximity between them. He had to keep the door open then, just a touch, not only because of the musty smell of old sports equipment, but also because of the charge in the atmosphere between them. He could easily have turned around, taken the teacher's face in his hands and kissed him right there. But that was what scared Dakin most. He wasn't like that! He'd never been interested before and it wasn't through lack of interest in him. Hell, Posner had been infatuated with him for months. But standing, watching the headmaster walk past, with Irwin practically leaning on his shoulder, Dakin felt his knees go uncharacteristically weak. He shut the door properly, hiding them from the headmaster, and leant against the solid wood. Irwin beside him was trying not to giggle, obviously oblivious to the inner struggle Dakin was going through. ~X~ Dakin tried the handle again. No luck. The door was stuck! He rolled his eyes. He'd actually locked himself in an outdoor store cupboard with Mr Irwin. Shit. \"Sir?\" \"Dakin.\" \"Sir, I may be mistaken, but I think the door is stuck.\" The merriment was immediately lost from the teacher's eyes. \"What?\" \"You're not very bright, are you sir?\" Dakin teased, \"I said the door is stuck.\" Irwin tried the door then. \"This is not good.\" He muttered, more to himself than to Dakin. \"Being stuck in here with me, do you mean?\" \"Yes. No. You wouldn't understand!\" Irwin sighed, running his hands through his hair, before pushing his glasses further up his nose. Dakin resigned himself to not getting much more of an answer to that and sat on a box. The silence that followed was interminable. \"Do you think we'll be happy… say we get in?\" Dakin suddenly asked, putting a halt to Irwin's pacing. \"Hmm?\" \"Oxford.\" \"You'll be happy anyway.\" Dakin frowned. \"I'm not sure I like that. Why?\" Irwin shrugged and resumed his pacing. \"Uncomplicated, is that what you mean? Outgoing? Straight?\" \"None of them bad things to be.\" \"Depends. Nice to be a bit more complicated.\" \"Or thought to be so.\" Dakin watched the contemplative expression on the teacher's face. Eventually Irwin seemed to shake himself out of whatever thoughts had consumed him and sat on a box opposite Dakin, setting his briefcase down beside him. Irwin's gaze settled on the dusty floor, obviously avoiding Dakin, giving the boy a better opportunity to study the man in front of him - the sharp angles of his face, down to Irwin's hands which were fidgeting nervously in his lap. Dakin was transfixed. The patter of feet of boys going home continued outside and Irwin shifted uncomfortably, causing Dakin to suppress a groan. \"How do you think history happens?\" He quickly asked to cover his embarrassment. \"What?\" Irwin responded, now looking straight at Dakin. \"How does stuff happen, do you think?\" How did I fall for you? \"People decide to do stuff.\" Was he really deciding to do this? Accepting this? \"Make moves, alter things.\" Irwin frowned. \"I'm not sure what you're talking about.\" \"No?\" This was it. Dakin got up and sat next to Irwin, their thighs almost touching in the cramped space. \"Think about it.\" Irwin looked uncomfortable, but there was something else in his eyes now as well. Longing? \"Some do... make moves, I suppose. Other people react to events. In 1939 Hitler made a move on Poland and Poland...\" In that moment Dakin had leaned in and pressed his lips to Irwin's. A few seconds passed before the teacher pushed him away and stood up, his back to Dakin. \"We can't.\" His voice sounded strangled. \"Why? Because you're a teacher and I'm... a boy?\" \"Obviously that.\" \"Who cares? I don't!\" Dakin retorted. \"I didn't know you were that way inclined.\" Dakin got up to stand behind him. \"Was Poland taken by surprise?\" Irwin breathed a laugh as Dakin placed his hands on his arms, turning the teacher around and moving to caress his cheek, before kissing him again languidly. Dakin flicked his tongue out, wanting more and Irwin responded, opening his mouth wider and meeting Dakin's tongue with his own. Dakin groaned again, properly this time, giving in to the sensation that is Irwin. \"Dakin?!\" He jumped as his name was called from outside, breaking apart from Irwin and re-establishing a socially acceptable amount of space between them. \"Are you in there shagging Mr Irwin?\" He turned away and closed his eyes as their laughter rang out. \"Just open the bloody door!\" He called back, glad that the darkness at least was hiding the blush on his cheeks. He could only imagine the expression on Irwin's face. The man was probably scared shitless. \"I'll handle it.\" He muttered. \"Is that a promise?\" Irwin challenged as the lock clicked. He clapped Dakin on the shoulder and walked out passed the other boys, with a rather sly grin on his face. He could practically feel Dakin staring after him. They'd both broken boundaries that afternoon. He'd broken his resolve not to do anything with Dakin, but at the same time he'd seen behind the cocky, outgoing exterior the boy put up. Irwin smiled to himself as he continued walking, without looking back. Dakin was still watching him as he disappeared round the corner of the building. He'd flirted back. He'd actually flirted back! And walked off, all casual and controlled as if nothing had happened! \"So, how's the war going? Full thrust Blitzkrieg? Annihilation?\" Scripps teased. \"Nothing happened.\" Dakin replied defensively. \"He rejected you! Fuck!\" That was Jimmy. \"Not exactly. I just... I don't get it!\" Dakin threw his hands up, despairing of the whole situation. \"He's so bold and then switches to being so fucking careful!\" \"You're actually in love with him.\" It was the first thing Posner had added to the awkward conversation. Dakin scoffed. \"No I'm not.\" He looked back in the direction Irwin had walked off in, before walking purposefully in the other direction. \"Denial!\" Jimmy sing-songed. Scripps laughed and Posner just continued to gaze after Dakin, until someone pushed his shoulder on their way to catch up with Stuart. Posner watched them go. \"The stars are not wanted now: put out every one; Pack up the moon and dismantle the sun; Pour away the ocean and sweep up the wood. For nothing now can ever come to any good.\" He quoted, knowing now that Dakin was lost to him. It never seemed to matter when it was a girl - always just another conquest, but a man... Irwin. Auden was right. No good can ever come of it. He sighed, switched his bag from his left hand to his right and followed after his friends. ","Summary":" First attempt at History Boys fanfic! Unbeta'd.

Forsythe likes to hear himself talk, dragging on and on about personal matters and little anecdotes that are as inconsequential as they're boring. Tom takes a measured sip of his drink and lets his eyes roam around the restaurant, briefly lingering, two tables over, on the actress from a soap his mother likes to watch and whose name he can't remember, and the economist he recently bickered with on a TV panel who's now sharing a bottle of wine with a young blonde Tom knows for a fact is not his wife. He doesn't pay attention to the couple who just stepped through the door, exchanging pleasantries with the hostess – not until Forsythe stops in his tracks and waves. Tom follows his line of sight and freezes. There are hints of grey at the man's temples and the neatly trimmed beard is new, as is the fitted designer suit, but even though it's been twenty-two years since Tom last saw him at Hector's funeral, it takes him less than a minute to recognize Dakin. Their eyes meet across the room, and for a split-second Dakin's assured smile falters as a flurry of emotions crosses his face. Surprise. Recognition. Something that might, possibly, be regret. Then the mask of confidence is back in place, so fast that Tom wonders if he only imagined that he saw it slip to begin with. He barely has time to gather his wits before Dakin and his companion have made their way over to his table and Forsythe gets up to greet them. \"Stuart, what a wonderful surprise to see you here! And your lovely fiancée!\" He effusively kisses the woman's hand before turning to Tom. \"Irwin, this is Stuart Dakin, the best tax lawyer in Westminster.\" Dakin's smile turns mischievous and his eyes flicker to Tom. \"Oh, we're acquainted.\" He holds out his hand for Tom to shake, and lets his grip linger for a moment longer than is proper. Long, infuriatingly soft-skinned fingers give Tom's a firm squeeze, like the conspiratorial acknowledgment of a shared secret. \"Hello, sir. Fancy meeting you here.\" Forsythe makes no attempt to hide his curiosity. \"You've done business together, then?\" Tom can't turn his eyes away from Dakin and the way his lips curl in amusement. Dakin doesn't contradict Forsythe's assumption, and Tom gets the impression that he's being dared to delve into their history together. He raises an eyebrow at Dakin – challenge accepted – and turns to Forsythe. \"I used to be his teacher, actually. Just before he went off to Oxford to lay the foundation of becoming London's finest tax lawyer, and I got myself into this chair.\" Dakin laughs quietly. \"Now, don't sell yourself short, sir. I know for a fact that you've accomplished plenty since the good old days at Cutler's.\" Heat rises to Tom's cheeks at the implication that Dakin's been following his career. He hasn't done the same thing. It's not that he's never been tempted to look Dakin up, see what he's been up to since his Oxford days, but he's always resisted the urge. It doesn't surprise him that Dakin had no such reservations; out of the two of them he's always been the braver one. Dakin turns to the redhead at his side. \"Where are my manners? This is Sarah, my girlfriend.\" He's still looking at Tom when he introduces them. The qualifier feels pointed, especially after Forsythe called her his fiancée, and Tom wonders if Dakin felt the need to correct the assumption for his sake. He chides himself for the silliness of the thought, but he can't quite shake it off. Sarah, for her part, appears to take about thirty seconds to decide that she dislikes Tom. She doesn't object when Forsythe suggests they share dinner and celebrate this long-overdue reunion, and her manners remain immaculate during the remainder of the night, but on the rare occasion that she speaks to Tom, her tone grows frosty and her eyes appear to be measuring him in a cool, almost disdainful way. For some reason, the idea pleases him, even though he tells himself that it's no accomplishment of any kind to be hated by Dakin's girlfriend. When Dakin excuses himself to go to the men's room, leaving Tom alone with Sarah and Forsythe, she unexpectedly addresses him. \"You know, Stuart never talks about you,\" she says. It's an odd statement, and the casual way she tells him sounds artificial and strained. He doesn't quite know what to make of it, so he merely shrugs and awkwardly explains, \"It's only school. Nothing exciting. A long time ago.\" She smiles, amused and derisive. \"Oh no, that's not what I mean. He talks about school all the time. He just never talks about you . When you were on that history programme and God forbid I accidentally switch it on, he'd change the channel immediately.\" There's no time for Tom to properly digest that bit of information, because she presses on, her eyes never leaving his face. \"I used to think there was some sort of bad blood between the two of you.\" He mistakes the statement for a question and hastens to deny it. \"No. No, nothing of that sort. We actually got on quite well.\" \"Yes, I realize that,\" she says, and her smile turns a fraction colder. She reaches for her glass and takes a sip from her wine, but over the rim, her eyes hold Tom's, unwavering. \"I saw Irwin last night,\" Stuart tells Scripps on the phone the next day, like an afterthought, like it's not the reason he called in the first place. When no further information is forthcoming, Scripps asks, \"And?\" Dakin huffs. \"And nothing. I just ran into him while having dinner with a client.\" He neglects to mention that he actually ended up having dinner with Irwin, just as he neglects to mention Sarah's presence or the temper tantrum she threw on the way home. \"I told him to call me if he needed a tax lawyer.\" On the other end of the line, Scripps snorts. \"I assume that was a euphemism?\" \"No,\" Stuart says, too quickly. Even he, who'd always been the master of denial and self-deception, knows that it's a lie. \"Yes. Maybe. Fuck, I don't know. I just want him to call.\" His voice is strumming with the same kind of frustrated impatience that used to be there all those years ago, like he expects the world to resolve around him and bend to his will, and he doesn't understand why it won't always work like that. Scripps sighs. \"Of course you do,\" he says. Some things, he supposes, never change. Stuart's out for dinner with Sarah, trying to smooth over whatever cracks have been showing in their relationship since the other night. Fifteen years ago, he wouldn't have bothered. Hell, even five years ago he'd probably have shrugged it off and called it quits, telling himself he didn't need that kind of unnecessary drama in his life. But he's been with Sarah for almost three years now, and he figures he maybe owes it to their relationship – and to his mother, who's been dropping hints about grandchildren for longer than he cares to acknowledge – to try and work things out. He's just being an adult, that's all. (There's a scathing voice in the back of his head that offers scornful laughter at the thought and tells him there's a difference between being an adult and being a coward , and it sounds a bit like Pos. Not the old Posner from Cutler's, a bit shy and passionate and utterly besotted with him, but the jaded, ruthlessly honest version of himself he's become over the years. Stuart ignores the voice, in the same way he's made a habit of ignoring Posner whenever he's been inconvenient.) Stuart's phone rings just as dessert arrives. It's an unfamiliar number, and he almost doesn't take the call, almost thumbs the red button and slides his phone back into his jacket. But his fingers are faster than his mind, and he hits 'accept' before he makes a conscious choice. Silence greets him at the other end of the line. \"Hello?\" A sharp intake of breath. Then, \"Dakin. Hello.\" The corners of his mouth twitch and the rush of satisfaction he feels makes him more light-headed than the two glasses of wine he's had. \"Hello, sir. Just a moment.\" \"I'm sorry, is this a bad time?\" Irwin asks, and Stuart smiles. It figures that even when Irwin's the one who made contact, he's still all too eager for a way out. Well, too bad, because Stuart doesn't intend to give him one. \"No, not at all. I just need to find a less noisy spot.\" If he hadn't looked at Sarah to offer her an apologetic smile, he might have missed the way her jaw tightens and her fists are clenching in the napkin. Her glare follows him when he gets up and heads outside, where the persistent hum of conversation and clinking of cutlery doesn't reach and no one will overhear the conversation. It's a cool, rainy night; he huddles close to the door so he won't get soaked within seconds. \"I didn't think you'd call.\" He shakes a fag out of the box and holds it between his lips, his left hand fumbling with the lighter while trying not to drop the phone into the puddles of rain water at his feet. It takes him several attempts, and when he finally succeeds, he draws a long, deep drag, relieved at the familiar way the smoke hits the back of his throat. The pause has stretched for so long that Stuart wonders if the connection cut off, but then, finally, Irwin concedes, \"I wasn't going to.\" \"I'm glad you did,\" Stuart says, and it feels less like an admission and more like an attack. It's like he said that day, years and years ago, when he handed in his essay: Some people make a move, others react to events. Stuart's always been more comfortable with action than reaction, preferring to steer events and conversations rather than be forced to follow someone's lead. Irwin seems to be at a loss at how to react. \"You do? Oh. I – I don't actually need a tax lawyer. I'm with Royce and Caplan. I'm quite happy with their services.\" \"Well, I guess I could tell you to ditch them because they're not half as good as I am so you're probably losing money, and also because Royce is a massive wanker. But to be fair, I'm not actually looking to take you on as a client.\" He doesn't socialize with his clients, not outside of what's strictly necessary, and the idea of having his interaction with Irwin limited to polite, professional small talk makes his stomach churn in distaste. Irwin breathes an amused huff. He doesn't appear to be surprised by Stuart's admission, and he doesn't hesitate to zero in on the false pretence under which Stuart got him to make contact. \"What exactly are you looking for, then?\" Stuart doesn't know what he expected. Not for Irwin to be quite this blunt, probably, not after all the time they spent talking in euphemisms and metaphors. He runs a hand through his rain-wet hair, and his laughter is a little shaky. \"Hell if I know,\" he mutters, more honest than he intends to be. It only takes him a moment to gather his wits again. Louder, with some of his usual confidence returned, he says, \"How about a chance to catch up?\" Tom almost doesn't go, just like he almost didn't call. This isn't him anymore: unsure, fumbling through social interaction, second-guessing himself. It's almost like the run-in with Dakin made him regress to the man he used to be when he was teaching at Cutler's, opening up old insecurities and half-forgotten longing like wounds that have never quite healed. He arrives at the pub half an hour early because he prefers having some time to familiarize himself with the location, being able to take his time navigating the wheelchair through the place. It shouldn't have surprised him to find Dakin already seated in a corner booth with a glass of whiskey in front of him, blowing smoke up in the air and watching the door with an intensity that would look pathetic and awkward on most men drinking alone. Not Dakin, of course. Tom would bet Dakin has never had any first-hand experience with pathetic and awkward in all of his life. A flash of satisfaction crosses Dakin's face when he spots Tom, and he feels trapped by the gaze, sweat prickling under his collar and a flush on his cheeks that will hopefully remain hidden under the pub's dim lighting. The table turns out to be easily accessible, and Tom wonders if it's consideration or coincidence that made Dakin pick it. \"You're here early.\" It's supposed to put Dakin on the defensive, but he just offers a shrug and blatantly lies through his teeth, \"I finished work early. Figured I might as well wait here than waste time at the office.\" \"Convenient,\" Tom comments, making sure his tone conveys that he knows Dakin's full of shit. The grin he receives in response is shameless, and startlingly familiar, and he finds himself thrown back twenty-odd years. He sharply draws in air, breathing in the smoke Dakin blows in his direction. \"You like it, then? Being a tax lawyer?\" \"Sure. What's not to like? It's easy enough, and it pays well.\" There's challenge in the raised eyebrow and the wry half-smile he levels at Tom. \"You told me I'd be happy anywhere, didn't you?\" \"That's not quite what I said.\" \"It's what you meant,\" Dakin fires back, and Tom can't exactly deny it. Doesn't mean he can't push back. \"Are you, then? Happy?\" Dakin takes a drag from his cigarette and averts his eyes as he flicks off the ash. He takes his time responding, but Tom's been a journalist for long enough that he can wait him out. Or thinks he can, anyway. \"Remember my essay about turning points in history?\" Dakin asks at last, and Tom realizes that he's not going to get an answer to his question. He hums in non-committal affirmation. It's easy to see where this is going, and he wishes he had the strength of will to stop it. But he never had, with Dakin. He's not sure anyone ever did, if the only person who's ever denied Dakin anything wasn't Dakin himself. \"Funny how Hector's accident turned out to be one of those, isn't it?\" \"Funny is not the word I'd use,\" Tom says wryly, pointedly looking down at his wheelchair. If he hoped to make Dakin stumble, he was miscalculating. All Dakin does is roll his eyes. \"Come on, sir. You know I didn't mean it like that. But if the accident had never happened, things would have gone differently, wouldn't they? We'd have gone for that drink, for one. I do wonder, sometimes, where we'd be now.\" \"Not here,\" Tom says, but what he means is: not anywhere together. They'd have had that drink and perhaps a quick, graceless fumble in the bathroom or even at Tom's old place at Bowman Drive, before Dakin would have hurried home without meeting Tom's eyes. And if they had ever run into one another, years later, they would have politely greeted each other and went their different ways, embarrassed by their shared history. Tom can picture it – has pictured it all unfolding, and he knows it's better the way things went. Despite the accident, despite the chair, despite the bittersweet almost that he can't shake off. Dakin raises a curious eyebrow at the finality in his tone, and Tom shrugs. \"That's the thing about subjunctive history, isn't it? It's all very theoretical. A fancy way of getting lost in 'what if's. Interesting, certainly, but ultimately pointless and escapist.\" His tone is scathing, so he's not sure why Dakin is smiling, sharp and pleased. \"Thought about it a lot, have you, sir?\" For the first time in years, Tom genuinely regrets the wheelchair. If his legs worked the way they were supposed to, he'd get up and walk out rather than be trapped under the weight of Dakin's knowing stare for one more second. But they don't. So he stays. Monday night, when Stuart comes home, he almost stumbles over Sarah's suitcases. As he watches her gather her things, he chooses not to examine where exactly the sense of relief that grips him is coming from. His attempts at stopping her from leaving are half-hearted at best, perfunctory and designed to fail. \"I don't get where this is suddenly coming from,\" he says, perfectly aware of how obnoxious he sounds. \"I've seen the way you look at him, Stu.\" She doesn't bother to specify who she's talking about. \"You haven't looked at me like that in two years.\" Stuart tries to laugh it off. Of course he does. \"You want me to look at you like I look at my old teacher?\" The expression on Sarah's face tells him that she doesn't appreciate the humor. \"I want you to look at me like you want me . Like I'm the most important thing in the room. I don't know what's going on with you and that guy, if he's... I don't know, the one who got away or if you're going through some mid-life crisis and suddenly want to be eighteen again, and I don't really care. This thing here –\" she motions between herself and Stuart. \"It's not going anywhere. And let's not kid ourselves, it wasn't really going anywhere before your Mr. Horrible Histories showed up.\" For a moment, she looks at him like she's waiting for him to deny it. He doesn't. It's the middle of the night when Tom's phone goes off. In the darkness of his bedroom, hands sluggish with sleep, he fumbles for his glasses. Dakin's number lights up the screen. It's almost two in the morning. \"Sarah broke up with me. This is your fault,\" is the first thing Dakin says. No 'hello', no 'sorry I woke you up', as if social conventions are for lesser people. He doesn't sound drunk, but not quite sober either, the mellow in-between where inhibitions are lowered and it's altogether too easy to say things one might be better off not speaking out loud. In vino veritas is only good advice if you believe that speaking the truth is generally something to aim for. Tom presses his fingers to the bridge of his nose, trying to convince himself that it would serve them both better if he told Dakin to go to sleep and ended the call before either of them says something they'll regret in the morning. But the response is already on his tongue. \"While I got the impression that she wasn't overly fond of me, I am reasonably sure that it's your fault your girlfriend ended the relationship. It's been a long time, but I know for a fact that you were taught the difference between a cause and a trigger.\" He can't quite resist adding, \"You can't put the entire blame of World War II on the invasion of Poland\" because it's such a poetic irony to bring them full circle like that, bring out the tired old metaphor one last time. On the other end of the line, Dakin chuckles. \"Still trying to teach me lessons about how history unfolds, sir?\" \"Dakin –\" Dakin cuts him off before he can even start to object. \"Stuart. We're not at Cutler's and you're not my teacher anymore. It's two in the morning, and my girlfriend walked out on me because of the way I look at you. You can bloody well call me by my first name.\" \"You're the one who keeps calling me 'sir',\" Irwin points out. \"Come one, you like it.\" A pause. Then, like a cheeky afterthought, \"Sir.\" Tom takes in a sharp breath that he's sure Dakin – Stuart isn't going to miss. He closes his eyes and wills himself to be less affected by the way Stuart's voice curls around the word, smug and a bit breathy and full of dark promise. \"Have a drink with me.\" The easy confidence in Stuart's voice is as infuriating as it is reassuring, and Tom is tempted – so very tempted – to agree. But not even Poland simply gave in when they were invaded. \"We already did have a drink together,\" Tom points out, because he's contrary and prickly and tired of euphemisms. Perhaps he's just imagining it, but he thinks he hears fond exasperation in the way Stuart huffs at the objection. \"Fine, not a drink, then.\" An odd softness creeps into Stuart's voice, not quite uncertain, not quite imploring, but close enough. It sounds so foreign rolling off Stuart's tongue that Tom takes notice, and he decides that he likes it. \"Let's have dinner. Just you and me. See where it goes.\" It's vague enough that it doesn't promise anything Stuart won't keep, and honest enough that Tom can't keep his defences up. \"Alright,\" he quietly agrees. \"Let's see where it goes.\" End.

And everything got real slow like a gunshot in the movies .,oO8Oo,. He receives the invitation on a Tuesday. He retrieves it unwittingly with the rest of the morning mail that has been stuffed through his letter box, and carelessly sets the lot down on his kitchen table next to books about Nicholas II, his latest idea for the television program. It sits buried under the bills, in between pages of the post, waiting patiently through a phone call and two rounds of coffee before Irwin notices it. He places the bills in his napkin holder so as not to forget them, and then picks up the paper. The heavy, cream-colored envelope falls out from where it had been inserted between the classifieds and the comics. It glances off the saucer of his coffee cup before slapping itself down on the floor. He curses, and leans irritably over the side of his wheelchair, long fingers brushing at the floor until he manages to snag a corner. He straightens and brings the envelope up to his face, adjusting his glasses from whence they slid askew. There are a few moments that he takes to frown at the name scrawled on the back. It's addressed to him all right— Mr. Tom Irwin , no mistake there— but it appears to be in his own handwriting. Curious, he turns the envelope over, slits it open, and removes the pale blue card. The mere sight of the gold gilded Oxford crest is enough to make his stomach drop. By the time the morning car comes to give him a lift to the studio, the invitation has made its way into the rubbish bin, unopened. .,oO8Oo,. He writes up a sensational segment on Rasputin and the fall of the Russian Tzar and presents the draft to his supervisors. They love it immediately, and so too will his viewers. It's good. And if he can keep this up at a steady enough pace, he thinks he might be looking at a comfortable retirement. It seems silly, but it has put him in a chipper mood, and so he's caught off guard when Don rings him around lunchtime. \"Sir.\" And, yes, he's surprised, because there's only one person who bothers to call and addresses him only as \"sir\" in those pouty public-school tones. \"Hello, Don. What can I do for you?\" Of all the boys from Culter's, Donald Scripps was the only one who kept in touch after . . . well, after . It was primarily a utilitarian, business-based communication: originally, Don had been writing a piece for the student-run paper, and Tom was willing to give some insight on the local political climate. After that, it was still fairly professional: Don wanted writing advice, Don needed this, needed that, had exhausted all other resources and maybe, possibly would Irwin have something useful? And of course he did, he always did; at least, he tried. And perhaps because Irwin was so obliging, or perhaps because Scripps was the only one who had managed to see through the bullshit from day one, the business talk was eventually interspersed with casually related things: how Scripps was doing, how the others were doing. In their lively, but infrequent conversations, Scripps usually took care not to mention Dakin, and Irwin never brought him up either; he was the proverbial elephant in the room. Irwin had always wonder about that, this tacit consideration on Scripps' part; did he refrain from mentioning Dakin because they were no longer mates? (Or did he know something, somehow?) \"Are you going, then?\" \"Where?\" Irwin asks around a mouthful of egg salad. \"To the big bloody graduation bonanza. I assume you got your invitation.\" \"I thought you weren't due till this December?\" Irwin says, confused (but more confused that Don would invite him anywhere publically; they were most comfortable, after all, over the phone or email). \"I'm not.\" A pause. \"You didn't get it?\" \"Don, what are you on about?\" \"I saw him write your name on one,\" Don was saying, and it wasn't like him to sound chagrined, but the tone was there. \"Don't you check your post?\" Irwin goes quiet for a moment, mind ticking through his options until he comes up with the only thing that makes sense. He thinks of the blue card, now buried under three days-worth junk mail and a scrapped draft. Ah . \"Dakin,\" he says at last. \"Stu,\" Don says, and it's not really a correction but more a reminder that the one they are both talking about has a more familiar address, one that Irwin has never permitted himself to use, even in his own head. Dakin (purposefully the surname) was the one subject they'd both studiously avoided; now, it seemed he was coming out of the woodwork. \"I did—get an invite,\" Irwin says after another awkward pause. He sets down his egg-salad sandwich, appetite suddenly absent. \"I tossed it.\" On the other side of the line, there is a huff that sounds suspiciously like a laugh. \"What the bloody hell for?\" And suddenly, sitting there in his cozy office surrounded by stacks of papers and books and references, Irwin knows. Don was in on it. He'd been in on it the whole time. What a fool. \"It's not like you to be meddlesome, Don.\" Irwin decides that adopting his chiding teacher tone might be useful, if not appropriate, considering the situation. \"But it is like you to be a pansy about it,\" Don shoots back, and Irwin is transported immediately back to Hector's classroom, to their discussion of the Holocaust, the way Don's expression had settled into that wry, slightly disappointed look. It was a look of cleverness, but not self-important cleverness that the others (especially Dakin) toted about; Don's expression made no bones about how clever it was, but was simply consternated at the fact that it was forced to come out of its shell. It was this self-possession that had nothing to do with pompousness that caused Irwin to let the personal injury slide and keep his ear pressed against the phone instead of hanging up right then and there. \"It's just an invitation,\" Don says softly when Irwin fails to reply . \"And it's not just for Stu; party's for Posner, as well—which I guess you'd know if you had read the invite. They've got quite chummy over the years; decided to throw their celebration together, as a farewell type thing.\" The word chummy echoed in his skull, and he shook his head as if to dislodge it. Who knew? Dakin and Posner being chummy. \"Why are you trying to convince me to go?\" Irwin asks suddenly, shrewdly. There is a sigh, long-suffering . \"Because Stu invited you, and he asked me about it—whether or not he should—and I said 'yeah, sure, why not?' because it's just a sodding party and he'd like it if you had the decency to pop in.\" Irwin looked down at himself, his button-down blue shirt, the stray crumb or two on his tie, his legs in their stirrups of the wheelchair. \"I very much doubt that,\" he muttered. \"It's next Saturday. I'm going. Hell, I can give you a lift if you need. My flat-mate's got a station-wagon; boot's big enough for your chair, I reckon. Think about it.\" Irwin doesn't get a chance to say anything else before he rung off. .,oO8Oo,. It isn't as if he doesn't think about it. Actually, to be completely honest, he thinks about it more than he should. It sort of sneaks up on him—when he is pouring coffee, visiting the library, rolling through the street. The memory pops up at odd and inopportune moments, crowding around his head, making him pause in mid-movement: 'Anybody else, I'd say we could have a drink.' It was a cliché, such a cliché. He hated it. Days like that, he was secretly glad for the motorcycle accident. The wheelchair had been a pain and a half to get used to—and four years later, he couldn't really say that he'd grown attached to it. But he made due. The wheelchair came in handy for tellie anyway—gave him more authority, more sincerity, his supervisors said. He didn't need full use of his legs to be clever. And he could still stand, just not for very long, and with putting as little weight as possible on his bad leg. He wasn't derelict. He had done well for himself. He had retrained his body to get along fine without using his legs, and he retrained his mind to push out Dakin and most of his memories of Culter's. But there are times. Oh, yes: there are times. He isn't depressed, per se. He knows what depression feels like, and this definitely isn't it. He derives a great deal of joy from life, from his work. He is, on the whole, very content; what pierces this contentedness is not melancholia, but a fleeting ache— sharp, but quick to fade. A rapid needle jab, as in a doctor's surgery. It doesn't keep him up nights; but it sometimes makes his showers longer than they ought to be. .,oO8Oo,. The rubbish-collector comes on Thursdays. He doesn't have to roll his bin out to the curb—there is an older widow next door that's happy to do it for him—but he empties all the smaller bins in his house. He does so, methodically. That Thursday morning, Irwin sips his coffee and listens to the rumble of the truck outside, staring intently at the (now slightly bent) blue card tucked into his napkin-holder. He stares and thinks about his life, his thirty-something-odd years. He thinks about his accomplishments and accolades, how they boosted his self-esteem, but were somehow never really enough. He thinks about his past lovers, few and far between. He thinks about his weekly physical therapy sessions, and the dull ache in his bad leg. He thinks about Dakin; the way Dakin had looked at him that day, before the accident; the way Dakin hadn't looked at him during Hector's funeral. It feels stupid—it feels really stupid. But he goes out and purchases a bottle of champagne anyway, has one of his suits dry-cleaned, and calls Don to ask if the offer for a ride is still up. \"Of course,\" laughs Don over the phone. \"Of course.\" .,oO8Oo,. The days until that Saturday march towards him relentlessly, dully, torturously. He can feel the edges of his reality going in and out of focus with the rising and falling tide of his nerves. Sometimes he is sharp and with it, usually in the early morning while he drank more coffee than was really healthy. In the afternoons, however, everything feels sticky and laggard. It's like waiting for a sentencing. He'd felt the same thing whilst awaiting his letter from Oxford. What a disappointment that had been. It is Friday—fucking Friday —when Posner rings. \"BBC, Tom Irwin speaking.\" \"Don't come.\" He's stunned, for a brief second, both by the direct and harsh delivery and by the timbre of the voice, familiar but changed. \"Pardon?\" \"Don't come to the party.\" The speaker he recognizes, still has that same sing-song voice, but it has grown deeper, matured . \"I know that Stuart sent you an invitation, and I'm inviting you not to come.\" Irwin fiddles with a pen on his desk. His palms have grown sweaty. \"May I ask why?\" \"Do you know what I studied?\" Presumptuous, to think he would recognize the voice without an introduction, but pointless, because he does. \"Literature,\" he replies automatically; then, \"Scripps told me you were reading literature.\" \"Yes,\" came the prim reply, and he remembered that too. \"Did he tell you that I've met someone?\" \"No, he didn't.\" \"Stuart met someone, too. Not me, and not a girl, but someone. Don't come and spoil it for him.\" There is a beat of silence wherein Irwin drinks this information in and lets it penetrate the gyri of his brain. Dakin had met someone. Of course he had. He was an impossible flirt when Irwin knew him; that, if anything, he had never expected to change. But the confirmation that Dakin was actively seeing someone, that he was someone's . . . it left a sourness in Irwin's mouth. Bitter and cold, like day-old coffee. \"Posner, I—\" \"He's good, sir. He's very good. He's done stupendously, in fact—and now we're both graduating, and we're both looking forward to our futures, and we don't need reminders of the past—neither of us.\" \"I'm not sure I understand.\" The response was quick. \"But you do.\" \"Posner, I only wanted to wish you both well. I'm not going to try anything.\" There is an aggravated, slightly prissy huff. \"You don't have to try anything, sir, because anything will happen all on its own. I'm asking you to not give anything a chance.\" He should back down now, he knows. He should leave it at that, bid Posner good day and hang up; but something in him rebels. He feels, for the first time in a very long time, somewhat angry. \"Why should it be any of your business?\" \"Because, after these four years and a lot of work, Stuart and I are actually friends now, and I'd like it to stay that way.\" There is a knock at Irwin's door, and he looks up to see one of the show's producers with a file in hand. Irwin tries not to look like a deer caught in the headlights and turns his attention back to the phone. \"I see.\" \"I hope so.\" \"Good bye, then, Posner. Best of luck to you.\" \"Good bye, sir.\" He listens to Posner ring off before setting the phone down on its receiver and looking up, plastering on his best patient smile. .,oO8Oo,. When Don comes by to pick him up on Saturday, Irwin greets him at the door and informs him that he's not going. Don's expression doesn't change. He asks why, but Irwin can do little else but shake his head and push the bottle of champagne into Don's hands. Irwin watches Don drive away, and pretends that he doesn't feel the drop in his stomach. He closes the door, wheels around, and heads back into his study where he was working on another segment for the program. He immerses himself again in his books, his motes of dust, in arbitration and ambivalence. He contemplates the history that has been written down before him, only so he doesn't have to contemplate his own. He buries the pale blue card at the bottom of a desk drawer and forgets about it. .,oO8Oo,. And then he sat back down another two times in the row.

The prick at the front was taking way too long on the telephone, and Don knew that was a bad idea. Well, he knew what had happened to the last person to try it anyway. Don didn't look up when he heard the scream. He just kept repeating over and over in his head what to say when the wardens came round – no, I didn't see anything, I didn't see anything - and kept his eyes fixed on the shoulders of the man in front of him. Which were…. shaking? The shoulders in front of him were quaking up and down like the scrawny man in front of him was about to cry. Don looked down to where he could see a rivulet of blood slowly gliding its way across the floor. Heavy footsteps arrived in his ears from behind; under the warden's blunt voice he heard a quiet but unmistakable sniffle. Don gently tapped one trembling shoulder; immediately, the scrawny back tensed up. \"Psst, stop sniffling and when they ask you what you saw, you saw nothing, ok?\" The man nodded without turning around and drew in a deep breath. When the wardens reached them, neither of them had seen anything. 'Fuck,' Scripps thought, as they were dismissed back to their cells. 'Mum'll be proper sad that I missed her birthday.' When Donald Scripps woke up the next morning, he was pretty happy for someone waking up in cell. He'd managed to persuade one of the kinder wardens to let him use a phone for a couple of minutes just to wish his Mum happy birthday, so that was alright. When he arrived at work (sewing was a bit boring but it beat cleaning the wings) he saw the scrawny guy again. He had a young looking face to match his slight build. Don sat down next to him after collecting his t-shirt pieces to sew together. \"Like sewing, then?\" he asked. The other man paused, then answered without looking up from his stitching. \"I don't need the qualifications and this sounded better than kitchen duty.\" \"So what you in for?\" The man paused again, for much longer this time. Don took the hint. \"Lawyer tell you not to say, huh? Fair enough. But to be honest, as long as you're not in for child molesting then you should be pretty safe.\" The other man shuddered visibly at the mention of child molesting, and Scripps thought he could see more fear than disgust in the involuntary movement. \"So not a child molester then.\" \"No.\" Both men turned back to their sewing and a heavy silence settled between them. \"Drugs.\" Don pricked himself with the needle as the other man broke the silence and he cursed under his breath before replying. \"Could be worse. Do you know how long you're here for?\" \"I got given three months.\" \"Again, could be worse. I've got four left out of six now. Assault. Got into a bar fight with some creep.\" With a quiet affirmative 'mm' from the smaller man, they once again fell into working silence until lunchtime. \"I'm Don, Donald Scripps, by the way.\" Don offered as they lined up to hand the warden their t-shirts. \"David,\" the other man replied with the beginnings of a smile. \"And thanks for yesterday.\" Months on the inside were slow to pass, but the minutes flew by when Posner had good company. Don Scripps was friendly and compassionate, two things he had certainly not expected to find in prison. Over t-shirt sewing they talked about the lives they had lived outside the bars and high walls like they were a film on pause, ready to resume exactly as before. Scripps, he had been surprised to find out, kept a diary and actually attended church every Sunday. On the other hand, Scripps had not seemed surprised to find that what Posner missed most was a decent cup of tea in the evening. \"I never saw a man who looked with such a wistful eye, upon that little tent of blue which prisoners call the sky-\" \"And at every drifting cloud that went with sails of silver by. Hello, David. Nice to see you out in the fresh air for once.\" \"Oi!\" Posner said, responding to Scripps' remark with a bony elbow to the ribs. \"Well, I always just assume you'll be reading in the library or in your cell. Although I reckon you've probably run out of books to read in the library now – if you've been going through the books at a rate of one or more each day for two months now.\" \"Well I found a battered anthology of Hilaire Belloc yesterday.\" Scripps shuddered. \"My parents used to frighten me into being good with his poems about string and lion and all that shit. Didn't work though, did it? Might not have got eaten by a lion, but just look at me now.\" \"Belloc wrote some really nice poems when he wasn't terrorising fictional children.\" Scripps raised an eyebrow, so Posner continued. \"He wrote a really nice series of sonnets for each month of the year, for example, and some really quotable short poems. February's goes something like this: \"The winter moon has such a quiet car That all the winter nights are dumb with rest. She drives the gradual dark with drooping crest, And dreams go wandering from her drowsy star. Because the nights are silent, do not wake: But there shall tremble through the general earth, And over you, a quickening and a birth. The sun is near the hill-tops for your sake. The latest born of all the days shall creep To kiss the tender eyelids of the year; And you shall wake – oh damn, I've forgotten the rest.\" Don gaped, wide-eyed and slack-jawed, at Posner. \"I liked learning poetry at school. I really liked Hardy, Housman, the war poets. Oh, and bits of Larkin. I got quite good at memorising it quickly.\" Don stood still dumbfounded, but managed to shut his mouth. \"Don pinched, Don starved, Don miserable; Don stuttering, Don with roving eyes, Don nervous, Don of crudities;\" Posner recited quietly. \"More Belloc.\" \"Don't suppose he wrote one about a Dave then?\" Scripps countered, finally regaining his composure. \"No, but he did call his Don middle-class.\" And at the look on Scripps' face, Posner laughed for the first time since he left university, light filling his eyes and his face brightening like an arctic sunrise. \"Last day stuck in here then, Pos?\" \"Yep, and my family are just going to be so happy to have their now criminally-convicted dropout of a son back…\" \"I'm sorry. Haven't you got any friends you could stay with?\" \"Dropped out of uni, had no friends before then anyway.\" \"Got me now though, haven't you.\" Scripps said, elbowing Posner playfully. \"Remember to keep in touch when you get back out there, alright?\" \"I promise,\" Posner replied, and Scripps received the warmest, most genuine smile. Three days before he was due to leave, Donald Scripps received a brown paper parcel so innocuous it had passed through the wardens and actually reached him. Inside it was an A5 exercise book, an A6 reporter's notebook and a diary for the year. In the front of the diary, in unmistakeable shallow slant was written 'David Posner' and a landline number. On Donald Scripps' penultimate day in prison, he got a phone call, as he did once a week, from Posner. When he said goodbye to Pos this time, he didn't know when he'd actually speak to him again. When Donald Scripps walked out of the prison gates, he breathed in the fresh air of freedom as he hadn't in so many months. When he reached his new flat three hours later, he phoned Posner. He left a mournful silence and his new address on the answering machine. That Sunday morning, Donald Scripps spied a familiar silhouette ringing the bell for his apartment as he returned from Pentecost Communion. There was no Larkin-esque Whitsun Wedding, not even a calling of Banns. \"Hello,\" the man said as he turned around to the sound of Scripps' footsteps. \"Come up for a cuppa?\" Scripps replied. \"Of course,\" Posner replied, and when Scripps entwined their fingers together and led him up the stairs, he didn't protest. And from the sermon, one sentence lodged in Scripps' brain: 'Thou who art fire of love evermore enkindle us.' Of everything to happen on this of all mornings, this had to be the best.

We're both in university now; separated. I'm not a big fan of university myself though I must say it is rather similar to a stately home; one thing my parents are particularly fond of. University can be quite social, I however feel the opposite. I feel lonely, lost. I am alone in my room in the evenings, when out of lectures and not at work. I was invited out with a group one night but that turned out to be a prank. It's almost as if I am the social outcast of university at this point. It may be that I haven't quite settled in yet, being mid – way through the year I feel that it is a bit late for settling in, that should have happened at the beginning of the year. The people, they're all different, it just seems as though I don't quite fit in and there's no one like you. I have yet to meet someone who I developed such an endearing love for at first sight, like you. I was thinking back the other day, back to the days of sixth form. When I thought this may be just a phase, that's what the literature said anyway. I have learnt now, that this is not a phase, it is true. I can't help but still have feelings for you but I have acknowledged that I must move on. You were never interested anyway. The course itself, exhausting. However one of the more positive things about university. I find joy in my course, it interests me, we're learning new things, new perspectives. Things we we're never taught at sixth form and I have to say despite always being one of Hector's boys, Irwin's approach has become quite useful. Hector's too, thinking about it, being able to remember the quotes, sometimes I will use them in my work. Those quotes, all the literature has helped me reflect on the learning, write in a way I never have before. It seems the combination of the teaching styles is what works best I hope that you're enjoying university, meeting plenty of girls. I hope that the course is what you thought, what you wanted. I hope you're happy with where you are right now. I hope for you to be happy and successful in the future. I also hope that one day we will see each other again. I have now learnt that if you love someone you want the best for them. Dakin, I want the best for you.

The layout's a bit more squashed then I'd like but I can't find a way to fix it. Enjoy :) Compound Adjectives Posner/Scripps Un-kissed \"It is true for you, isn't it, this overwhelming feeling we have for each other? It's as true for you as it is for me, isn't it?\" Posner asked quietly, eyes darting from Scripps's right eye to his left, biting his lip absent-mindedly. \"Yes, it's true,\" the other boy answered, shifting so he was sitting on his hands. Mustn't touch, mustn't grab, mustn't push him down and- Posner sighed and dropped his head. \"I think we mixed up the first bit. It's 'no, not really,' not 'no, I'm not,'.\" \"We can leave it. Hector won't mind.\" Posner tutted, shaking his head. \"No. Hector said exactly as it was. Can't change lines around, Scripps.\" You can't miss bits out either, Scripps thought as he glanced down at the page in his hand. They kiss as the music grows louder. Un-rejoicing There was a teacher at the school that reminded him a bit of Hector. He taught what he wanted and sometimes Posner could hear singing coming from the room at the end of the corridor. A bit stranger than Hector ever was, though. Paranoid, probably. Insane, maybe. Lonely, certainly. About six months after, he left for personal reasons; at least, that's what they told the students. In the staff room, it was common knowledge he'd had a nervous breakdown, brought on by the death of his cat Beth, and Jon Taylor in 10F. The teachers held a small party in the English office. No more speeches on a Monday morning detailing how they've sentenced themselves to an eternity in hell four times before breakfast was apparently a thing to celebrate. Posner didn't stay though. He went home early that night and spent the night talking about their old English teacher while Scripps scribbled away on the notepad in his hand. Un-confessed He sees Dakin, sometimes. Not often, but once or twice a year. And when he does, his stomach still dips. It's embarrassing really. Years out of school and still slightly lusting after the boy (because he always will be a boy to Posner, all of them trapped at seventeen and eighteen years forever) that he'll never get. He won't admit to it. No matter how drunk they get him, no matter who asks him, no matter what they do to him, he won't confess. No one will ever find out. (He's sure Scripps knows. Sure that he's made the connection between seeing their old friend and the way Posner clings to him for the next few days. He won't ask if he does know. He's lucky to have what he does, he won't risk it.) Un-embraced Standing by his front door, Posner looks so very small and so very young, with his head bowed and his hand nervously twisting the strap of his bag. Scripps doesn't know if he pities him or feels sorry for him. Doesn't know if they're the same or not; it sounds like they should be the same, but he's sure there something that much worse about pitying someone. \"Anyway,\" Posner says, quietly. \"Ignore me. I'm talking rubbish. Again.\" He starts fidgeting, moving one foot backwards and forwards on the pavement. \"I'll see you tomorrow.\" Scripps nods, smiles, and lifts one arm to rest on Poser's shoulder. The other boy looks down at it and then back up at Scripps, frowning slightly. He looks down, slightly embarrassed. He didn't know why he'd done that. And now they were left standing there, half way to a hug, avoiding each others eyes. God knows what they looks like to anyone who saw them. He drops his arm, lets it fall down from Posner's shoulder to down by his side again. \"See you.\" Un-spent \"We're out of milk.\" He feels the pillow dip on either side of his head, and the paper of a five pound note tickling his cheek. \"Mhm,\" he mumbles in reply, lifting one of his hands to wrap his fingers around the other man's wrist. \"Get off. I have to go.\" Warm breath heats up his forehead, and Posner tips his head back slightly. \"You don't.\" \"I do if we want tea.\" \"Later,\" he says, half pleading, half insisting, as he opens one eye and blinks against the morning sun. He smiles up at Scripps and reaches his other hand up to cup the back of his head, pulling him down to press his lips against his. Posner takes the money out of the other man's hand, and tangles their fingers together as the note lies on the on bedside table, resting on top of a pile of books, forgotten. Un-fingermarked The bruises left there by the other man's hand have faded to nothing. Not that they were proper bruises, not really. Just marks on the skin where someone had grabbed his waist and held him there, held him down and left a permanent remind of their night together. He'd looked every available moment, as much as he hates to admit it (it seems a rather pathetic thing to do, really), to see if they'd gone. And then this morning he'd looked and they had. Clear white, pale uninterrupted skin. Lying on the bed, he rests his hand on his hip and presses down hard. When he lifts it up, the skin's white before going back to normal, blending in with the rest of his body. There are faint red lines where he dug his nails in. It's not the same. No where near the same.

Or well, she thinks if she'd only paid better attention, she would have noticed. Not so much about the girls perhaps, but at least about the lack of boys. Brian over at Cutler's, whose mum was friends with Scripps' mum, (and so Scripps had sort of a forced friendship with him) had asked two summers ago, \"Who's your friend? The one with the bike who meets you after church?\" \"Daisy?\" \"Sure, if that's her name.\" \"That's Daisy.\" \"Pretty, isn't she?\" \"Yes, she is.\" Scripps had informed Posner, of course, one afternoon in the park. \"I think Brian sort of fancies you,\" she had said. \"Brian?\" Posner asked, half absorbed in the clouds. \"Yeah, from church. The one who lives across the street from me.\" \"Oh.\" Now Posner had stared at Scripps, baffled. \"Why?\" \"I don't know,\" Scripps had laughed. \"He thinks you're pretty is all.\" Posner had her brow furrowed so Scripps had said, \"Don't worry, I'll tell him you're not interested. You're too young for that kind of thing anyway.\" \"Oh, well. Thanks.\" Then the summer after A-levels, before the start of it all, there had been John the book shop boy (in a manner of speaking, as he was done with quickly). Pos worked summers, like the rest of them, but she had a rather more decent job than most of the rest. It was quiet and Posner knew her books. A month in and she could alphabetize like a professional, she claimed. John was the other hired summer help, though the shop didn't really need it. Scripps came to suspect it was a family thing, because John was even less of a salesperson than Posner, and couldn't reel off titles and locations at nearly the same speed. One day, Posner had come over after they'd both gotten off work (and really, bakeries were far less appealing once one had worked inside one, Scripps decided). \"You're rather dour looking today,\" Scripps noted. \"Not dour. Contemplative, maybe,\" Posner replied. \"About what? Life, the universe? That's a very weighty face.\" \"Boys.\" \"Oh, are you?\" Posner frowned at her. \"Not like that. Or, I mean. Like that, but.\" \"Yes?\" Scripps prompted. \"John, he asked me to the cinema.\" \"Like on a date?\" \"Yeah.\" \"Darling, you know you don't have to go if you don't want to?\" \"But I do though!\" exclaimed Posner. \"I've said yes. I thought, well I just thought everyone else has, and why not me?\" Scripps could think of many reasons 'why not' (Posner was so terrifyingly young, and frighteningly clever, and she didn't even seem to realize she occasionally resembled a young Virginia Woolf, if somewhat happier, as Posner's family was far less fucked up, despite their massive tragedies). But she was here to be encouraging, she knew. \"I'm not a child,\" Posner said. She was pouting and therefor not very convincing. \"Of course not.\" Scripps humored her. It didn't work out. (Of course it didn't bloody well work out.) Posner had looked miserable the next day, shades of guilt clinging to her. \"It . . . just didn't feel right. It's nothing like in the films, is it?\" she asked morosely, touching her lips and reliving (her first kiss and) her disappointment. Scripps hadn't know what to say. School: \"And there she goes, the face that launched a thousand whispered rumors!\" crows Lockwood, as Dakin drives by. Dakin waves, coy in the passenger seat of the car. She is wearing lipstick and sunglasses. It's Felix's office boy driving. \"Not quite Helen of Troy, yet,\" Scripps says. \"She's beautiful enough,\" Posner murmurs. \"Maybe,\" Scripps says, \"but Helen of Sheffield really doesn't have the same ring, does it?\" Posner doesn't appear to be listening. \"I understand, you know,\" Posner says. \"What Irwin means by original bloody turning points? Come over here and help me then.\" \"No, not that,\" Posner says dismissively. \"Dakin. Why she likes Irwin.\" Scripps looks over now. \"It's only because she's finally met someone she has to work to impress, Daisy.\" \"Oh, it's that, but it's more than that. Irwin, she's sort of beautiful - and don't, Donna, I'm perfectly fine being referred to as the \"nymph\" if everyone's going to keep calling me that - but it's more than that. She's confident, isn't she?\" \"Daisy -\" \"I could be confident.\" \"I'm sure you could. Now, come on, help me with this. I can't believe you're done already.\" \"I'm going to do it,\" Posner declares. \"Help me? Thanks very much, I've only been asking for the last several minutes.\" \"Go to Oxford. I'm going to do it.\" Posner looks marble hard. \"All right.\" Scripps believes her. \" It's in the reach of my arms/ the span of my hips, \" Akthar says, throwing her arms out. She looks like she could start dancing any moment. \" The stride of my step,/ the curl of my lips, \" Posner chimes. She has good rhythm, for all her hesitance. Headmistress Felix looks rather uncomfortable, but she doesn't attempt to stop them. They are imminent Oxford girls now, and this is possibly their first taste of champagne. \" I'm a woman./Phenomenally./ Phenomenal woman,/ That's me, \" Akthar and Posner croon together. \"Well done, well done, girls. And who is that?\" Hettie asks. She is not entirely herself today. \"Maya Angelou?\" offers Irwin after a moment's hesitance. \"Oooh, well done, miss!\" \"Oh, Miss Irwin !\" \"My god, look how far she's come!\" \"We're so proud, miss!\" \"She's American,\" Posner explains. She is still giddy. \"My mum thinks she might be a good role model,\" Crowther says. - Summer: It isn't like summer, really. None of the girls quite know what to do with themselves. \"I'm not sure I believe it, some days,\" Posner says, and she could be talking of a great number of things. They wait and they wonder. \"Oxford had better be brilliant,\" Dakin says. Oxford, Year 1: \"So, why Daisy?\" a boy asks Posner. They're both first years at Magdalen, in their first days (of the rest of their lives) though he doesn't seem nearly as petrified. Or perhaps he's better at hiding. Certainly his suits are of better quality than her own blazers. \"Dunno,\" she murmurs, \"didn't really want to be called Davinia all the time, did I? And I read some story. The girl was called Daisy. Seemed more, English, I suppose. I was five,\" she defended herself. \"Well, Davinia's nice. Sort of . . . exotic,\" he decides. \"More exciting than Jacob, anyway.\" Posner had forgotten his name again until now, and hadn't wanted to ask again. They'd already spoken several times. \"I think I'll call you that,\" the boy who is apparently Jacob says. \"Sorry, what?\" \"Davinia, silly. You could be a poet with a name like that.\" Posner seriously doubts that. It's sort of a nice thought though. \"D'you like Queen?\" \"Erm, the band? Yeah, I suppose.\" \"We're going to get on,\" Jacob declares with a certainty Posner envies. She listens to The Smiths more, but Bohemian Rhapsody's interesting. Really fucking strange, of course. She could reliably get a glare from Mrs. Barnes across the way if she blasted it on Saturday afternoons back home. So perhaps Jacob's right. Scripps isn't sure what she thinks of Posner's new friend. She thinks she would have liked him if she'd met him herself. But as it is, he's charming and well read and insufferably posh. He has the kind of posture that has to be drilled into you and she imagines that he smells like class. (Really, he just wears cologne, something deeper and muskier than vicar's back home.) \"Davinia,\" he says, whenever he addresses Posner, which is often. \"Davey!\" his blonde friend calls out, \"Davey, you've got to see this, darling.\" No one but Pos's family calls her Davinia. The new teachers would, (\"Oh, miss, you're just looking for Daisy, over there, see? Cuz she's such a flower.\") but never for long. \"Davinia?\" Dakin laughs, when she first hears. \"How proper we are getting.\" Posner flushes and mutters, \"He thinks it's more elegant, yeah? And it's my name.\" Scripps thinks Daisy is perfectly elegant, a Fitzgerald name, though Posner has all the missing kindness that Gatsby's Daisy wanted for. She might be more of a Nicole Diver, but Scripps chooses not to think on that. Still, she can't help but worry. Posner is too lightly built. Getting swept off her feet might be a permanent situation. And so she has to ask. \"Daisy,\" Scripps murmurs later as they sit cross legged. \"Daisy, are you -\" \"Oh, Don,\" Posner smiles, resting her chin on Scripps' shoulder, \"always my knight. It's not like that. I thought maybe at first, like you did. But you know, I rather think he likes Oscar Wilde a bit too much for that.\" \"Oh,\" laughs Scripps, \"does he then?\" Posner giggles. \"He's absolutely mooning over some third year. The man rows apparently. My god, it's like a fucking novel. He pines.\" Scripps smiles back and says nothing of the last year, the serenades. Posner does look happier here. She's often worried, nearly always weighted down by books and papers and constantly in a rush when Scripps sees her but for all that she seems more solid. There's a girl in Posner's 9 o'clock lecture that she likes to look at. She's got the loveliest bright hair, all curls, and she always looks impeccably tailored. Posner decides she must come from money. It's an expression she's picked up recently. It's a very funny innuendo, as if a child could spring from so many pounds and shillings. (Posner is always at a bit of a loss when she encounters old coins. Decimals are so much tidier.) Jacob always looks a bit icy when people say it, as if people couldn't read his family fortune off his clothes and the way that he walks. Posner doesn't learn the girl's name, and she presumes the other girl doesn't care to learn hers. It doesn't bother her. She knows now that it's passing in the specific, but lasting in general. The knowledge, at least, is strengthening. She'll never marry. She knows her mother still hopes to see her under a canopy one day. Oxford must count as a something of a consolation prize though, or so she hopes. Summer: \"Home, sweet home,\" Dakin mutters darkly, as their train pulls into the station. Akthar throws a crumpled napkin at her head. Posner giggles. Scripps smiles but pretends like she hasn't noticed. Rudge really hasn't. Scripps isn't happy to be home, exactly. It's like coming back to a mosaic, one you'd passed and seen and memorized, only to find the pieces rearranged. It's not Sheffield that's different really, though of course, time leaves its mark on everyone and everything, even on her mum's smiling face. She's changed as well. She has a fringe, to start with, a business-like bob. She rather likes it. When she'd had it done, Posner had smiled, kissed her cheek softly and said there was no one she'd rather see on a book jacket, and that she looked a kind of National Geographic dashing. Dakin had said she looked like a flapper. Akthar, had, of course, contested this. Her mum likes it though. \"Oh, you look like a lady. My Donna, all ready for the City.\" It grows out, over the course of the summer. Still, at least she did it to begin with. Oxford, Year 2: \"Come into London with us, Davey,\" Lola wheedles. (Her name is not actually Lola but Laura. She likes to try names on for size though, and this is her current one of choice. Posner's still not sure she entirely likes her, though she'd like to kiss her, has even.) \"Look I can't, not this weekend. I've got to work.\" \"You always have work,\" Jacob says. He's sulking and it makes Posner feel ever more like she's Charles in Brideshead Revisited . \"You can go and do whatever the fuck it is you'd like, Jacob, but I'm staying here.\" Posner thinks she has better learned to defend herself, even if it is only to her friends. \"Fine, do what you want,\" Lola says. \"Let's go, Jacob.\" She sashays out. She's trying too hard to be a femme fatale. Jacob lingers though. \"You're sure you're not going to come, then?\" \"Yes.\" \"Lot of pretty girls, though.\" \"Oh, for fuck's sake, some of us are going to have be employed when we get out of here, Harrington!\" \"And acing your next exam is really going to make the difference?\" Jacob asks. It gets to the heart of the matter. But Posner has spent so much time wanting Oxford that she can't stop now. So she grabs her things, starts to brush past him. \"Where're you going?\" \"Scripps's,\" she says shortly. \"I can't concentrate with you lot hanging around.\" \"Oh,\" Jacob says, and he is again the easily delighted figure she was befriended by, \"is that how it is?\" He apologizes later, but sometimes Posner thinks he's a bit too perceptive for his own good. Or that they share a similar cruel streak. In any case, Posner tells him, desperately, she only wants to get through uni. He doesn't know what it means, for her to be here. But she's not sure that's the truth. It's not an unhappy time. For all that Oxford's not the answer, Posner does hold out hope that it's the beginning to one. Primary research, possibly. Or it could not be. She's heard Irwin's just got a job at the BBC, and she'd never actually been to Oxford, or not like she'd said anyway. Posner doesn't want to write programmes for television though. She thinks she might rather teach. She doesn't tell her mum or dad. They have such lofty ambitions for her. She cuts her hair on a Thursday evening. Posner shows up at Scripps' door one early winter morning, rosy-cheeked and wind swept. Her hair is gone. Or most of it is, anyway. \"Do you like it?\" she beams. She tosses her head like a horse. Scripps is tempted to point out she hasn't got a mane anymore. \"Jacob did it. Or well, he started to, and then Adi made me go to the hair dresser's. I just thought -\". She looks like a page boy, or like Puck. She is impish. \"Of course I do, dear,\" Scripps says at last. \"You look lovely.\" And she does. She has bangs floating across her forehead and a cut like a pixie. She could be Peter Pan and Tinkerbell all in one. \"I'm glad,\" Posner replies seriously. \"I wanted you to like it.\" \"Shall I call you Rosalind now?\" Scripps asks later, when she is sitting on her bed, and Posner has commandeered the one chair the room boasts. \"Call me whatever you'd like!\" Posner laughs. \"I feel so light, Donna, it's wonderful.\" She clambers onto the bed alongside Scripps. \"Would you be my Celia then?\" \"Well,\" Scripps asks, \"who would be Oliver?\" \"Anyone you want, dear,\" Posner says seriously and presses a kiss to Scripps' cheek. (She's often given to bouts of affection but it's mostly her young cousins and Akthar and Scripps who are the recipients.) \"God, if you'd like,\" she smiles wickedly. It's an expression that's eerily Dakin-esque and yet it looks comfortable, fitting, on Posner's face. The comment doesn't really make as much sense any more (uni will change a girl's mind, though now Scripps isn't sure what exactly it was worth changing it for) but Posner has always been good at remembering things. \"You little fucking blasphemer!\" Scripps laughs. She pushes Posner away, onto her side. But she hugs back when Posner springs up again and throws her arms out. Yes, Oxford is doing all right by both of them. \"The short hair, the new name, those trousers. Are you going through a George Sand phase, Daisy?\" Lockwood asks. The Cambridge girls are up for a rare visit, and so they are all crushed into a pub stall for the occasion. \"Oh, shut up, Jamie,\" Akthar says. Lockwood laughs. \"I'm only asking because if you were, that'd be alright by me.\" \"Generous of you,\" Scripps says. \"No, I'm not going through a George Sand phase,\" Posner says. She looks as if she's barely resisting the urge to roll her eyes. \"But I'll be sure to tell you if I develop a sudden passion for Chopin.\" \"Or Marie Dorval,\" Dakin mutters. She's staring beyond the booth to the television. Scripps highly suspects it's Irwin on there, with her shiny hair and serious expression and dramatic claims, but certain things are best overlooked. \"Also, Davinia's my actual name and my trousers are perfectly stylish, thanks,\" Posner adds rather belatedly. She looks disgruntled and Scripps laughs. Posner's face softens a bit. Summer: It's warm enough to be dozy, and Scripps has followed Dakin to the park. Dakin's telling some story about her boss and her boss's secretary and why she's sure they're having it on, but Scripps is only half listening. She wants to wrap herself in the summer wind. (And that's a good line, maybe, she thinks. She'll have to write that down, but right now she's too sunshine drowsy to rummage around in her purse for her notebook and pen.) It's that kind of day. And then suddenly there is Posner. She's on her bike, cruising through, and she doesn't seem to have noticed Scripps and Dakin. Scripps thinks to call out for a moment, but doesn't. Daisy looks like she's skimming across the ground, and she's (finally) wearing her glasses. In her blue sundress, the one her father got her for her last birthday (it has small white daisies printed on it and Posner had looked a bit like she wanted to cry) and ballet flats, she looks just like a picture. \"Donna? Are you even listening?\" Dakin asks. She sits up and - sees. \"Oh.\" \"What? Yes, I was. Nancy from the office - \" Dakin tilts her head a bit and stares straight at Scripps. \"Really? You? I wouldn't have thought.\" Posner's mostly out of view now, the green bag she'd bought at that thrift shop in London and the rear wheel of her bicycle disappearing behind some bushes. \"You wouldn't have thought what?\" Scripps is so very fucked. Dakin smiles, toothy and sharp, and merely says, \"Huh. Explains a bit, I suppose. So how long has it been like that for you?\" \"How long're you going to stay stuck on Irwin?\" It's unnecessarily harsh, saying that, and Scripps knows it. Dakin leaves. Scripps isn't sure this whole moment of realization could have gone any worse. No duels or suicides at least. Life is rarely the kind of dramatic Scripps was prepared for. \"Donna?\" Posner asks. It's a familiar scene, the two of them stretched out on Posner's lawn, their legs bare beneath their summer clothes. It seems so impossible that this may be their last summer soaking in the ever elusive Sheffield sun together. \"Yes?\" \"Are you and Dakin fighting?\" \"Not anymore.\" \"Oh.\" \"Why?\" Posner twists the tail of her hair ribbon headband around her finger. \"I was just worried, I suppose. You don't fight very often, and Lockwood, she came by the bookshop the other day, and she said Dakin'd been fuming.\" \"I didn't realize Dakin's moods were such an issue to you,\" Scripps says. \"Don,\" Posner says reproachfully, \"they're really not. Not anymore. Not for ages, even.\" That's just a bit of an exaggeration, but Scripps appreciates the sentiment anyway. \"I know. Well, you needn't worry. We're all fine now.\" \"Good. I'm glad,\" Posner says, still looking down. Then she glances up and gives just a bit of a smile. She lies back down on the grass, and murmurs, \"It's almost Oxford time again, can you imagine?\" Scripps hums, acquiescent and warm through. She could fall asleep here, embracing the ground. \" The last of Summer is Delight, \" Posner whispers. Oxford, Year 3: Perhaps it's silly, waiting longer, after that summer. There can only be so much assurance when it comes to love, surely, Scripps thinks. She waits anyway. At Oxford, it's hard to ignore the haunting feeling of the future. It follows them everywhere, like a shadow with no concept of the sun's cycle. It's only fall, but their time is already sliding away. Adulthood doesn't so much beckon as whisper around corners and pop in for tea uninvited. Posner has started wearing her glasses regularly now. \"One does have to start somewhere,\" she says. Adi's been Daisy's best friend for ages. Neither remembers how they first met, but they've been told the story by their mums enough times that they've created memories, almost. The park, the swings, and the instant camaraderie of young children. Daisy had been terribly put out to learn they were in different years, later. It seemed desperately unfair that Adila got to go have adventures before her. It was half the reason she'd worked so hard, to be bumped up. It had only made sense for them to do Oxford together, to keep each other within grasp, even as they cut their anchors. And now London's calling (Gregory down the hall is constantly playing that song and Posner can never get it out of her head) and like the droves of expectant third years, their minds turn ever southward. \"Are you sure, about this teaching thing?\" Akthar asks. They are surrounded by a terrifying amount of paper. Posner thinks if there was ever a fire, her room would go up in flames immediately. \"Are you?\" she asks. Akthar shrugs. \"Dunno. Lots of people change careers though. Not the end of the world, is it?\" Adi's always been better at this whole modern flexibility thing. \"Yeah, I suppose. Still wish you would say you'd split a flat with me.\" Akthar looks at her shrewdly. \"I'm sure in a few months you won't be wanting me around during the nights.\" \"Don't be crass.\" Akthar laughs. \"It's like watching a living Edith Wharton story, except without the enormous fortunes and any of the interesting bits, the two of you. Amazingly dull, actually.\" \"You are a horrid human being.\" \"I'm sure you'll be able to find some other nice, responsible girl your mum approves of to live with, Daisy.\" \"Oh, fuck off.\" It's going on winter soon, and the wind has picked up a shivery quality. Posner's half asleep in Scripps' bed and Scripps hasn't the heart to throw her out now, so late at night. (As if she could.) The tape of Billie Holiday her dad had found and posted her, along with a jumper from her mum, is playing. \"Oh, this song,\" Posner says, her eyelashes sweeping slowly up and down. She smiles slowly. \"I like this song. 'Specially when she sings it.\" \"Could be us, in a few months,\" Scripps says, as Billie begins to sing about foggy London town. \"In London, anyway.\" Posner hums her agreement. She looks . . . embraceable. So Scripps leans over and kisses her. The music begins to pick up. And so that was all that was needed. Nothing special at all. An unengaging narrative, perhaps, but Scripps finally feels poetry personified. Posner, Scripps decides, looks really wonderful, like warmth and wildness and flowing words trapped in amber, with her hair all mussed and her lips parted. \"Stay the night?\" Scripps asks. Posner raises her eyebrows, wicked and delighted. \"Why, Scripps! I am a lady, you know.\" Scripps rolls her eyes, and replies, \"Oh, don't be an arse.\" \"'Course I'll stay,\" Posner says, and she bites her lip. Scripps decides the correct course of action is to continue kissing her. In the morning, Posner wakes slowly, and doesn't move from their tangle of warmth, though she's got a tutorial in a few hours. She pets Scripps' hair and whisper-sings, \" And the age of miracles hadn't past, \" though the tape's long been silenced. Scripps uses up more notebooks than ever, writing nonsense and joy and the word bliss. \"You're a bit disgusting,\" Dakin says. Her stare is heavy and judging, as are her curtains of dark and solemn hair. Scripps beams and doesn't say one day Dakin will understand. \"Well, you're a bit sad.\" \"Am I, then?\" \"Are you what?\" Posner asks. She hooks her chin over Scripps' shoulder. \"Sad,\" Scripps explains. \"I was saying Sara's a bit sad.\" Posner nods seriously. \"The thought of the split ends you must have does bring me to verge of tears sometimes. You should really cut your hair, dear. You haven't done that in ages.\" \"I do not fucking well have split ends!\" \"I'm sure you don't.\" \"Oh, of course not.\" They were always a bit much when they banded together. \"Oh, fuck both of you, really,\" Dakin mutters, swilling her wine. \"Sorry,\" Scripps says, with her best contrite expression. \"Yeah, dreadfully. We're going to have to decline that offer,\" Posner adds. \"We're trying monogamy.\" \"But maybe in the future,\" Scripps says. \"Or you know, not then either,\" Posner concludes. Dakin glares. The winter snow falls, and they go home to Sheffield, catching each other's eyes across streets and while shopping, and it's like sharing an open secret. Scripps thinks surely everyone must be able to read it off her body. \"You're very happy,\" her father says. \"I am,\" she replies. He stares for a moment and nods. \"That's good.\" \"It is.\" Posner's smiles taste like peppermint and promises. Spring and suddenly everything's a rush. Spring and exams and suddenly-. \"I don't think I quite believe it,\" Posner says, sitting on her bed. Her face is blankly terrified. \"Yes, well,\" Scripps says, \"nevertheless.\" \"Doesn't it seem strange? The rooms, the books, the learning, the lovers on Addison's Walk. It'll all go on without us. As if we were never here.\" \"That's a rather disheartening way to look at it.\" Scripps sits down too, navigating her way around some precarious piles of books. She suspects Posner has been compulsively stacking and re-stacking them for days now. \"That dresser's never going to be same, at least,\" she says, nodding at it. There had been an incident with copious amounts of red wine and a scented candle. The burn marks are rather more dramatic than the whole thing warranted. \"That is true,\" Posner says, smiling wanly. \"It's not the end, you know,\" Scripps says, and kisses Posner's bare shoulder. It isn't warm enough for her to be in a sleeveless dress and no sweater but then Posner's always been too hopeful about spring. \"I know,\" Posner replies. And then with more conviction, \"I know.\" Summer: Posner thinks half their things must be strewn throughout the country, dumped in Sheffield, forgotten at mates' places, swallowed by Oxford's grandeur and thorough cleaning staff. In any case, when Posner arrives in London at the beginning of August, she comes with many books and no furniture. Scripps had come down a few weeks earlier. Posner's mum had wanted some last stolen moments, had whispered Hebrew prayers into her short, soft hair (don't forget, please, don't forget) and her father had kissed her forehead. She took a morning train, after breakfast, and watched England roll by. Scripps was there at the station to meet her and for a moment it had been just like a film. It was not an ending though, but yet another beginning. Their flat is tiny, and only not cramped because it's still empty. The windows look out onto a grimy street and a parking lot and the next door neighbors are entirely too fond of hard rock and each other, and at the worst hours. The girls don't even have a proper bed, but a mattress on the floor (it will take months, and another flat, before that changes). Still, it's theirs and Posner decides Virginia Woolf was certainly on to something with that. Then again, she's always rather been of the opinion Virginia Woolf was on to something with everything really. They're busy, and moreover, quite bloody poor. Posner's still a student (\"I'm attempting to stay in school for as long as possible.\" \"You sound like you're trying to avoid a draft.\" \"That's a rather inaccurate metaphor. You should really be more precise. But you may have a point.\") for all that she's learning to teach now, and Scripps is running about at all hours of the day (and night), doing exactly what she expected not to do. (But still, it would be a shame for the public to be denied the structure of her sentences in whatever form possible, Posner believes.) The pursuit of truth and justice and a brighter future for the next generation is not nearly as lucrative as tax law is apparently going to be. (\"Tax law? Dakin? She doesn't even like maths,\" Posner had said, baffled, and Scripps thought surely her sudden surge of affection was ridiculous and unwarranted.) It is happiness, though, of a certain fashion. They cannot live like this forever, sweaty and exhausted and afraid of their own toaster, and hopefully they won't, but it's right now it's just a bit romantic . Later: It's been a long day and Scripps is tired and remarkably annoyed when she gets home. Posner's in the kitchen, making tea, and her hair's tumbling out of a haphazard bun held up by one of those red pens she uses for marking. Framed against the darkening sky outside the window, she could be a Hopper painting. She turns around and smiles, comes up to Scripps and kisses her. And it's routine and expected and still ordinary-perfect. \"Alright, love?\" Posner asks. She tucks a few stray hairs behind Scripps' ear. \"Yes,\" Scripps says, and it's true. \"There is one friend in the life of each of us who seems not a separate person, however dear and beloved, but an expansion, an interpretation, of one's self, the very meaning of one's soul.\" - Edith Wharton References, in order are: Phenomenal Woman - Maya Angelou, The last of summer is Delight - Emily Dickinson, and A Foggy Day.

He is 28…. The blank page was beckoning for me to write something, anything. No words came to my mind, no ideas. The only thing that filled my mind was thoughts of him. There was nothing romantic between me and James, nothing at all. There was nothing romantic between me and any other boy, just ask Elizabeth. But James was different from all of us. He was more… rebellious, for lack of better words. When he told me he was going into the army, I didn't think much of it. Plenty of people went into the army and came home safe and sound, why should he be any different? I guess life doesn't always agree with that analogy. I remember the night vividly . It was late, maybe 2am. Elizabeth was tired, so she decided to stay the night. We were both asleep when the phone rang. Elizabeth grumbled and kicked me, so I answered the bloody thing. \" Hello?\" \" Hey, Scripps.\" It was Dakin. \" What is it? It better be fucking important to wake me up-\" \" It's Lockwood. He's gone…\" That woke me up. I became speechless and frozen. I couldn't say anything, or even move. \" Scripps? Donald? Hello?\" Dakin's voice sounded distant. The phone slipped out of my hand and landed on the floor with a loud clatter. Elizabeth had woken up and crawled over to me. \" Are you ok, sweetie? Look at me, love.\" She said and shook my arm. But I still couldn't move. Elizabeth took the phone and I heard her talking to Dakin. I slipped off the bed and slumped on the floor, my head in my hands. I hadn't spoken to James in a while. Now I will never be able to tell him that I was planning to propose to Elizabeth, I will never be able to hear him joke and hear his laugh, his loud laugh that could make even that saddest person smile and laugh themselves. Elizabeth had hung up the phone and was now sitting next to me on the floor. I looked at her, she didn't say anything, only put her arm around me and I rested my head on her chest. Her long hair and slipped off her shoulders and was now draping across my neck and face. It smelled good, like green apples. Actually, when James met Elizabeth, he fell in love with her. Not in a romantic way but like a love between a big brother and little sister. He was so much taller than her, I was too, and he would always be teasing her and she would return it. She often told me about how she loved him like a brother. I felt a drop of wet on my cheek and looked up to see Elizabeth crying. Soon I was too. We both loved James Lockwood. But he and I had a bond no one could break. We were brothers. We always will be. All of us are; Dakin, Posner, Akthar, Crowther, Rudge, Timms, and of course, Lockwood and Scripps. We faced puberty, growing up and all the weird things you can think of together. The bond we have is unbreakable. They wanted me to write a more personal article. They said I didn't include enough of myself in my other articles. They said it seemed uncaring. What if I didn't want people to know about me? What if I didn't want people to know the pain I am going through? Then I decide what to do. I grab another sheet of paper, this one is completely blank, no lines to be seen. I am not writing an article, I don't know what I am writing. But I just need to write. I grab my pen, and begin writing down the words that finally come to my head. Pain is hard to deal with.

It takes Irwin a moment to realize he is cold. The warm body beside his is gone, leaving him half uncovered. \"Oh, Dakin,\" he sighs, rubbing his brow. He'd thought they were past this, this dance of sneaking out and pretending not to care. He grabs his cane and hobbles to the chair. Better check and make sure he's locked the front door . A light coming from under the door in his study gives him pause. He almost never closes doors. He's alone, except for when Dakin's around, and they're inconvenient from the chair. Resisting the urge to press his ear to the keyhole like a schoolboy, he slowly opens the oak portal. Dakin is sprawled in the window seat, an army of surrounding end tables supporting massive stacks of papers. His shirt is half open; his hair is wild. He looks exactly like Irwin used to imagine he did the night before an assignment, disgruntled yet brilliant. He's tempted not to break the tableau. \"You're up early,\" he comments softly. Dakin startles, then blushes lightly. Irwin can't remember the last time he saw the younger man color with embarrassment. \"Did I wake you?\" He moves to get up, but Irwin dismisses the motion with a wave of his hand. \"No, I just… You know it's three in the morning?\" He can't find the words to say what he is thinking. It is something between most people only mess up their study at home and please never leave . \"Big client?\" he manages.

I like the night-mornings.\" \"Night-mornings?\" Dakin smiles fondly, the sort of kind smile that convinced Irwin that the boy could be more than a prat so many years ago. \"Part of a sonnet Pos wrote for Hector one year. 'On Exams' he called it. All about the night and morning before; there was an entire stanza on the peace and calm of night-mornings that we all experience in solitary.

Gave me several long mornings back at Cutler's yourself.\" He reaches out and brushes his fingertips against the other man's cheek. \"Good. They suit you.\" They make you even more beautiful , he thinks, raising his own hand to knit their fingers together. Immediately embarrassed by his sentimentality, he moves to push the chair back. \"I… should let you work in peace.\" \"Don't leave on my account,\" says Dakin, suddenly slightly tense. Irwin smiles, recognizing the schoolboy anxiety. \"Would it disturb you if I read a bit in here?\" The former pupil relaxes instantly. \"Not at all.\" Irwin grabs a book from the unread stack on his desk and wheels back toward his lover. He sets up shop beside one of the conscripted end tables. He resists the urge to grin when Dakin reaches over to lace their fingers once more.

Classes ended five minutes ago, but Irwin had asked to meet at the end of the day. Posner regrettably did not have a good feeling about this proposition. Recently had he confronted Irwin about his arising homosexual feelings, seeking advice. Also coincidentally did their accidental eye contact continue, and increasingly so. Posner quickly listed any accidental signals he may have sent in the past few weeks, cursing his carelessness, until he began to shoot said thoughts down. Irwin was a teacher, a professional one. Posner loved Dakin, and Irwin seemed to respect that enough. But surprisingly, as he approached Irwin's classroom, the unexpected sound of a piano began; the sound of a soft, lower chord, accompanied by a higher, familiar melody being plucked out toward the top of the keyboard. Upon recognizing the tune, Posner immediately knew the person on the other side of the door. He was absolutely positive no one in the entire school, save Hector, knew obscure musicals as Posner and Scripps did. He stopped at the door, listening as Scripps began the lyrics: \" Not a day goes by, Not a single day, But you're somewhere a part of my life, And it looks like you'll stay. As the days go by, I keep thinking, \"When does it end?\" That it can't get much better much longer. But it only gets better and stronger And deeper and nearer And simpler and freer And richer and clearer \" He reached to the door handle for a better listen, opening it quietly and stepping inside without Scripps noticing. Sure, Posner had heard his friend sing before: with the music they did together, it was as common as talking. This time, though, Scripps found himself (as he thought) completely alone. He was not performing, nor practicing. He was simply singing. \" And no, Not a day goes by, Not a blessed day But you somewhere come into my life And you don't go away. And I have to say If you do, I'll die. I want day after day After day after day After day after day After day after day After day Till the days go by, Till the days go by, Till the days go by. \" \"If you wanted to duet so badly you could have told me.\" Scripps concealed his shock, instead remaining still, hunched toward the piano opposite Posner, who stood at the door. \"My poor moment of solitude, Pos.\" \"I think it'll be alright.\" Posner replied nonchalantly while Scripps remained still. \"Honestly, since when could you sing like that?\" \"I really was just practicing Pos, it's nothing.\" \"Nothing, really? As if you've ever sung like that around me. I sometimes wonder if you even care about me.\" He made his way to the piano, sitting to the the right of his friend, forcing his attention. \"Play something else, I know you know more.\" Scripps looked away, rubbed his head, and sighed. \"I, I don't think so, my hands are a bit tired, you know.\" \"Bullshit, you've played one song!\" After a brief silence, Scripps turned to Posner. \"Oh, okay, then!\" \"Why are you laughing?\" \"No reason.\" he smiled jokingly, beginning a new tune with a series of upbeat minor chords. \" I wonder what he'll think of me? I'll guess he'll call me 'the old man- '\" \"No, no, no, stop that.\" Posner interrupted, shooing his hands from the piano, \"Something more sad, like the song before.\" \"More sad than Carousel? Have a heart, Pos! Billy Bigelow, he commits suicide.\" Scripps had a secret Rodgers and Hammerstein soft spot. Knowing this, Posner sighed snobbishly, \"Well,\" He clapped. \"Come on. Get at it. Try something nostalgic, a love song, maybe?\" Scripps' expression faded as he switched his gaze toward the keys, away from his friend. \"Let me think a bit...\" He began a monotoned, jazzy accompaniment: \" You're always sorry You're always grateful You're always wondering what might have been Then she walks in. \" \"No, no, not quite,\" Posner frowned. \"Relax, like you did it before. You're wonderful.\" \"Honestly, I'm fine on self-esteem. Is this any better?\" Scripps grinned while beginning a series of soft, lower chords. Posner failed to recognize the tune until the unmistakeable melody began: \" I've never been in love before... \" \"What? No! No!\" Posner yelled as Scripps snickered. \"If you'd let me finish something, maybe you'd like it!\" \"Fine, fine. I won't interrupt this time, I promise.\" \"Famous last words, Pos.\" Scripps took a moment to think of a new tune before switching to something more melodic. \" It started out like a song. We started quiet and slow, With no surprise. And then one morning I woke To realize We had a good thing going. It's not that nothing went wrong: Some angry moments, of course, But just a few, And only moments, no more, Because we knew We had this good thing going. And if I wanted too much, Was that such A mistake- \" The playing ceased, causing a silence until Posner spoke up. \"Why did you stop, it's not nearly finished?\" \"There's something wrong. You're pouting your lips, don't think I don't see it. It's quite rude, you know.\" He paused. \"Okay, fine, this song is much too sad. Way too sad... could I, maybe...\" \"Could you, what?\" \"Demonstrate what I had in mind, Scrippsy?\" He rested his hands and chin upon Scripps' right shoulder, while Scripps, for a moment unsure what sort of demonstrations were in store for him, remained still. \"Go ahead, I'll match.\" \"Well, what if you don't know this one?\" \"Honestly, we know all the same songs.\" \"That's really true, isn't it? Umm...\" He closed his eyes. \"B-flat.\" Posner got into character and began, Scripps smirking at the song choice and accompanying shortly after: \" With so little to be sure of, If there's anything at all. If there's anything at all. I'm sure of here and now and us together. All I'll ever be I owe you, If there's anything to be. Being sure enough of you Makes me sure enough of me. Thanks for everything we did, Everything that's past, Everything's that's over too fast. None of it was wasted, All of it will last: Everything that's here and now and us together! It was marvelous to know you And it isn't really through. Crazy business this, this life we live in- Can't complain about the time we're given- \" Scripps glanced toward Posner and watched him sing. \" With so little to be sure of in this world, We had a moment A marvelous moment. \" With the ending notes, Scripps retained eye contact with Posner, purposefully making the ending note an octave higher to move closer. Pathetic, he thought, nonetheless effective. Posner smiled quietly back, upon the last note. \"That was, uh, that was very good.\" Scripps looked away. \"You've improved since last semester.\" \"Thanks.\" Posner wrung his hands together, feeling ashamed. He loved being around Scripps, he enjoyed his company, and now that Dakin spent more time with Irwin, the two got closer every day. He then noticed how close they had been sitting; shoulder to shoulder, leg to leg. Posner thought of reaching to him, putting his hand soflty to his face, bringing him closer. \"Well.\" Posner stood ubruptly and made his way to the door. \"I'd better find Irwin. We've been in here for a while now, haven't we?\" \"Irwin?\" Scripps turned around. \"He said he was out of classes early, let me practice in his classroom. You supposed to meet him?\" Quickly Posner recalled how tricky Irwin actually was. How he always wanted to show off his own cunning, yet was still, refreshingly yet secretly, generous to his students. Posner smiled. \"No, I had questions on the essay topic.\" \"If you need help, I've it written already.\" \"That's fine, I think that's cheating, anyhow.\" \"Yeah, I suppose.\" Posner swallowed hard and looked at Scripps, who was caught between resuming piano playing or contributing to the conversation. He hated it when Scripps acted like this: it made Posner do all the work. \"Well, I should get going then.\" \"Yeah.\" Posner started for the door, but paused and turned around once more as he reached for the knob. \"Have you ever spoken to Irwin, for advice or anything?\" \"Once or twice. I know you can probably go to Hector, Pos; not the best idea for me.\" \"No, that wasn't it.\" he hesitated,\"You normally pray, though?\" Scripps scratched his head, choosing his words carefully, \"You know, sometimes I think there's business where God just isn't very knowledgeable. I don't think he'd be interested, anyhow.\" Posner smiled. \"See you.\" He let the door close behind him.

The title and two lines are lovingly borrowed from W.B. Yeats' \"When You are Old.\" I. They're in different colleges, but they still see each other often enough – more than Scripps sees Akthar, and more than any of them ever see Rudge. On the first Sunday of the term Scripps leaves the chapel and finds Posner waiting outside, headphones on, Gracie Fields blaring, same as always. They meet for lunch and sometimes for tea but more often to study in each other's rooms, or at the library or even outdoors until the weather grows too cold. Sometimes Dakin joins them, and Scripps watches Posner sneak painful yearning glances, and watches Dakin ignore him, same as always. II. Posner disappears for two weeks in November. He misses study sessions with Scripps and Dakin, skips supper with Akthar. Scripps sees him once at the library, but Posner vanishes behind the shelves, looking skittish. On the last Sunday of the month he reappears, waiting outside the chapel, a scarf knotted loosely around his neck. \"Ah, the pilgrim has returned,\" Scripps says, burrowing his hands in his pockets against the cold. \"What have you been doing, then?\" \"Thinking,\" is all Posner will say. But somehow he seems relieved of a great weight, and in his mind Scripps labels Posner's smile 'enigmatic.' III. On Sunday mornings they wander around Oxford. They're still charmed by it, the spires, the cobblestones. One day Scripps photographs Posner in the cloisters, a photo he considers sending Lockwood with \"Posner the Monk\" scrawled on the back. \"Do you ever wonder where you'll end up?\" Posner asks. Scripps arches a brow. \"I mean, will you stay in Sheffield? After?\" \"It depends,\" Scripps says after a moment. \"On?\" \"If there's someone else. If I ever-\" Scripps shrugs awkwardly. Dakin would've told him to write it down. \"So the celibacy isn't forever?\" Posner asks, looking amused. \"A temporary vow,\" admits Scripps. IV. They're all back in Sheffield for Christmas. They meet at the pub; it's the first time the eight of them are in the same room since Hector's funeral. There's talk of visiting Mrs. Lintott. No one mentions Irwin. Across from Scripps is Posner, wedged between Dakin and Timms. With a smirk, Dakin slings his arm around Posner's slim shoulders, weighing them down as he whispers something in his ear. They all watch, some surprised, some amused, as Posner gently shrugs Dakin off and shifts imperceptibly away. For some reason he doesn't fully understand, Scripps finds himself grinning into his beer. V. One night they're in Scripps' room, taking a break from revising. Posner recounts a story he heard from Akthar, about Dakin visiting the lads at Cambridge and spending a drunken night outdoors wearing just his pants. Dakin's already told him, but Scripps laughs now to hear Posner repeat it. Posner smiles at him. \" How many loved your moments of glad grace, / And loved your beauty with love false or true- \" \"Oh, Poz,\" Scripps says. \"It will pass.\" Posner's face falls. \"It hasn't been about Dakin for some time,\" he says tartly, looking unaccountably hurt. Scripps suspects that he's blundered, badly. VI. Posner's breakdown surprises Scripps. He'd known that Posner was struggling but he didn't think it was all that bad – he'd put it down to anxiety over exams, exhaustion, Dakin. Beneath the long-suffering looks and wry self-deprecation Posner had always seemed so strong . But now, seeing Posner looking so pale and lost in the stark room, his bright eyes shadowed and shuttered – well, it shocks him. Akthar visits, but he's always been uncomfortable with Posner's attention-seeking – the classroom serenades never did sit well with him – and a breakdown seems the most attention-seeking of all. Scripps wonders when he became everyone's confessor. VII. Posner's parents bring him home, and Scripps doesn't see him until he's back in Sheffield for the summer. He puts off visiting for a week, still haunted by memories of harsh silences and dull eyes, but when Scripps finally goes he's relieved at how well Posner looks. He's seeing a counsellor and volunteering at the library twice a week, \"to give me structure,\" Posner says, with a bit of good-natured eye-rolling. \"And I'm singing again,\" he adds happily. \"I never felt much like singing last term.\" That's Scripps' cue. He spends the next hour at the piano, playing for Posner. VIII. Posner watches Scripps scribble in his notebook. \"My counsellor thinks I should write,\" he says. \"It's supposed to help.\" Scripps doesn't look up, but when he sees Posner next he hands him a clumsily wrapped parcel. \"To get you started.\" Inside is a brown leather journal, embossed and with a crimson ribbon to mark the pages. Posner's obviously pleased by it. His fingers trace patterns on the blank pages, imagining future words. \"I don't know if I'll be as prolific as you, Scrippsy.\" Scripps grins and ducks his head, and remembers how much he's missed hearing Posner call him that. IX. \"I won't break, you know,\" Posner says, looking up from his journal and catching Scripps staring again. He's been writing in it more often lately; the corners of the pages are crinkled and the cover is pliable under his hands. \"Or do anything too mad,\" he says, raising his hands and wiggling his fingers absurdly. \"Piss off,\" Scripps says, laughing, and flings a crumpled paper at him. Posner smiles and bats it aside, turning back to his writing, and Scripps watches his fair head bending over the pages, the fluttering of his eyelashes against pale cheekbones, and feels strangely moved. X. They're at the piano, Scripps playing scraps of melodies as Posner sits beside him on the bench. Scripps pauses, fingers hovering over the keys, when Posner speaks. \"It hasn't been about Dakin for a long time,\" he says quietly. \"I told you once. I don't know if you remember.\" Scripps smiles. \"I remember.\" His fingers fall into a rhythm again. Ode to Joy . \"Ha, ha,\" Posner says, but he's grinning too. Scripps glances over at him. The music stops with an uncharacteristic clunk. \" Oh .\" \"Yes,\" Posner says, turning away, but Scripps reaches out and brings him back for a kiss.

He was never the most emotionally or physically fit of men but the residual aches and pains, not to mention the guilt from the crash had caused him to feel off. Not ill enough to call off the two week long study group that Crowther, Posner, Ahktar, Dakin and Scripps had insisted he lead before they started at Oxford in the fall, but unwell enough that during his waking hours he had been vacillating between dizziness and a vague feeling of being underwater. Then there was the topic of that drink. Euphemistically speaking of course, because both he and Dakin had both known that that drink meant something else entirely. And if he hadn't have been clever enough at the time to catch on to that then Dakin had made his intentions plenty clear. How about you suck me off, Dakin had said at the time. Yeah, Irwin definitely had wanted to do that . Still, why Dakin had decided to take part in the group and why he had decided to lead it was a mystery. It was not as if anything were going to happen now , was it? The accident on the back of Hector's bike had pretty firmly cemented that drink as being part of the distant past, a bit of history that unlike most events, would not and could not repeat itself. At least that is what Irwin liked to tell himself. As the boys bounded into the makeshift classroom Irwin had put together in his study, he threw his left arm back, pointing towards the assignment on the portable blackboard he nicked off the A/V department at Cutler's before he quit, no make that 'resigned due to illness and accident.' He feels like it is an easy enough assignment that he shouldn't be pestered until mid-morning at the earliest, but at the same time not so easy the lads will get restless. Compare and Contrast Wallis Simpson and Anne Boleyn and their effect on the monarchy in at least 4000 words. NO GERUNDS AND NO EUPHEMISMS! \"Are you drunk sir?\" Akhtar asks. It is a reasonable question, Irwin concludes. Except for the 'no gerunds and no euphemisms,' the assignment has nothing of the twisty-turny spin history on its head and give it your own interpertation that his old teachings were based on. \"No. I'm not drunk. Headache.\" Which isn't a lie, Irwin thinks as he starts fumbling with papers on his desk-reports that he never actually got to finish grading from the end of term as well as some bills that he realises are past due. Finally he gives up on appearing productive, looks back up and notices that Akhtar is still staring. \"Is there a problem, Akhtar?\" \"No. Sir.\" \"Fine, get to work then.\" Irwin even threw in a glare for good measure. It seemed to work because Akhtar finally took his eyes off him and started working on the assignment. \"Sir, sir!\" \"Huh? Yes, Dakin.\" Irwin was waiting for it. What it was he wasn't entirely sure but the way Dakin was looking at him was making him nervous. Nothing new on that front though. Dakin had always made him nervous. Just being around Dakin had even at one time, made him really, truly believe that they had already had that drink. How Irwin had managed to come out of his delusion fast enough to keep his sanity was something that he could only thank god for. \"Were they worth it? Wallis and Anne, I mean. Edward abdicated the throne and we know the sorry mess that Henry made. Why not just have a good shagging and be done with it? It seems odd.\" A small smile almost formed on Irwin's lips. Of course Dakin would turn this into a discourse on sex. \"Wallis and Edward were in love.\" \"Love is an illusion, there is only lust, sir .\" \"Ah, sod off Dakin,\" Crowther said as he started scribbling some notes down. \"Love is real. Your problem is that you think with your dick so much you can't see it.\" ","Summary":" Irwin hasn't been feeling well since the accident.

McLachlan","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4164586","Passage":"[Chapter 1] The air is clean, and yet heavy with the tease of a lighter atmosphere should one be inclined to venture up the cliff path walk. The small ache in his leg reminds him that he will not be appreciating the abbey grounds layout for a long time. He sighs, an appallingly soft gust of resignation, and seats himself upon a stone that had once been a part of a great wall. He has no idea why he'd even opened the letter, the one sent to BBC2, care of Tom Irwin, the envelope white and innocuous, his name tattooed into it by a black pen that appeared to have been running out of ink. He'd recognized the handwriting the moment the girl, some secretary to some manager, had handed it to him with a smile and said she loved his program and could he sign an autograph for her, for her mother, Bekka with two K's? Even after four years, his immunity is still weak. Hector's inoculation had done nothing, although the man had been right about the pain. I should have gone to Bristol. Roche Abbey, Sunday, 1:00pm. No euphemisms. He checks his watch, a gift from the station after the success of the program's premier, and studiously ignores how his hand is shaking. It is five past one. Hector was right. He really is a fool, sitting at Roche Abbey after four years and one eye-opening encounter in a classroom. What kind of teacher, what kind of man, would stand silent as a complacent little know-it-all spewed out eloquent, erotic filth, half-veiled by poetry while simultaneously taking wrecking balls to his carefully-crafted armor? Poland knew something was up, yes, but did not choose to act. Divide and conquer. He smiles, and hates himself for allowing himself to be so obviously seduced. \"There you are.\" The last four years have changed Stuart Dakin, and most assuredly for the better. He no longer sports that ridiculous hairstyle, the one Irwin used to find so amusingly attractive, with the way it would shine in the light from all the gel. Oxford has definitely left its mark. Dakin carries himself a little taller, a little less cheekily, a man that's long left the vestiges of boyhood behind, ready to take on and tackle the world. There is nothing in him of Sheffield, of Cutler's. Irwin barely recognizes him. \"I wasn't sure you'd come,\" Dakin continues, long legs carrying him across the impossibly green grass to where Irwin sits. \"Here I am,\" says Irwin softly. Dakin smiles, and there's nothing overtly mocking in it, but Irwin can't help but feel like he's being made fun of. \"And you, an Oxford graduate. You look well.\" The smile broadens to an amused grin. \"You look as if you're about to be sick. You're never this nervous, even when you've got thousands of people watching your program. I've seen you. You can be totally at ease when you want to be.\" His heart does not race at the thought of Dakin watching his program. It doesn't. \"I'm fine. Just surprised that you felt the need to come here when a simple phone call would have done.\" Dakin says nothing in response to Irwin's brushing off whatever they had as something a phone call would have satisfied, just moves to sit down on Irwin's stone, crowding him, stretching out all over Irwin's space. Close. Far too close and still far too much of a temptation. Long fingers take out a pack of cigarettes and tap two out. Dakin lights them both and holds one of them out. \"Consider it the Treaty of Trianon.\" Irwin chuckles, takes the offering, and draws deeply on it, hoping the nicotine will calm his nerves. \"Are you trying to dismantle a major European power?\" Dakin stares at him from the corner of his eye and Irwin shivers. \"I'm trying to dismantle something .\" They sit in wordless silence for a long moment, puffing at their cigarettes and gazing out at the land beyond the ruins. There is so much history here, between them, where the abbey once stood. Lives and events and love and death. \"I hated Oxford,\" Dakin says at long last, and Irwin looks at the white cylinder between his fingers, thinking of hiding in a storage shed from the Headmaster, pressed momentarily up against Dakin's uniform, the scent of cigarette smoke and cologne so strong that he could taste it on his tongue. So much history. \"Did you.\" Dakin exhales a plume of smoke that dances away from them, dispersing into nothing, quietly polluting the air. \"All of it. The pretension, the expectations, the snobbery. I hated it all so much that there were days when I was this close to just dropping everything and leaving. And I'd never once thought I'd hate it, not even in the subjunctive.\" Irwin nods without really understanding. It had been his dream to get into Oxford, to be able to tell his family, friends, and lovers that he was an Oxford graduate. To have that title, that extra honor. Instead, he had gone to Bristol and had been happy. He would have rather gone to Oxford and been miserable. \"The worst of it is that I worked so hard to get in,\" Dakin goes on, tilting his head back to catch the sun. Irwin's breath catches in his throat at the picture he makes. \"Weeks and weeks of endless words, only to have you tear them apart, compound sentence by elliptical clause by fucking gerund.\" \"It made you a better writer, a better historian.\" Dakin snorts. \"It didn't.\" \"I read your essays back at Cutler,\" Irwin protests. \"Toward the end, they were really good. Fascinating, even. Thought-provoking.\" \"All lies. Good lies, but lies. That wasn't me trying to be different than all the other Oxbridge candidates, that was me trying to get your attention. And it'd worked. Barring accidents, it would have more than worked.\" Irwin closes his eyes and tosses the cigarette away, the smell too acrid. \"Fuck you.\" \"No, fuck you. Sir . \" He can't do this. He can't be back in that room, trapped against the window, staring at the shadows the light had cast on Dakin's cheeks, white-washing him into a marble masterpiece that begged for his touch. Painfully, Irwin stands and puts some distance between them. A blockade. \"Enough. Enough.\" \"History with its flickering lamp stumbles along the trail of the past, trying to reconstruct its scenes, to revive its echoes, and kindle with pale gleams the passion of former days,\" Dakin sighs, looking around. \"I've seen pictures of Roche Abbey when it was whole. It was nice, but the ruins… I find the ruins much more beautiful.\" And there they are, among the ruins. Irwin looks out at the looming stones. \"The used to be.\" \"So what if they're the used to be? They're still here. Where everything else has left, or gone, or been redone, these are still here.\" Dakin stands and stretches. \"You do realize we've accomplished nothing.\" \"What did you think would happen?\" Irwin can't help but ask, inflecting polite diffidence into his tone. \"That we would trade declarations of love among the beautiful ruins of Roche Abbey? Romantic. Hopeless romantic. The lot of you were.\" Dakin looks at him, amusement clear in his eyes, the ever-present sneer from before missing from his face. Maybe it's underneath the calm veneer he's showing. \"Were we? Am I? Where does that leave you? Are you telling me you're not a romantic when it comes to history and its impact on the world?\" Dakin pauses. \"Is your leg getting tired?\" Irwin struggles to piece together the conversation, non-sequitur and all. He had been used to that, once, back at Cutler's when Dakin had been so determined to catch him off-guard, jumping from topic to topic in the blink of an eye. Going from 'I went to your school' to 'your sucking me off' in a matter of seconds. Dakin is like a synapse, a burst of electricity, the smallest thing that keeps it all going. Underneath the calm is the sneer, and underneath that is everything else. \"We could sit back down, if you want,\" Dakin offers, amusement plain in his voice. Irwin is so glad he's entertaining, at least. It takes away a bit from the fact that he's a right fool. \"Is that a euphemism, as well?\" Irwin asks, ignoring the growing ache in his calf, a pain very much like what his mother calls Sciatica. \"Sitting down, going for a drink -- just what is it that you want from me?\" Dakin stares at him for an endless moment, a small eternity that gives birth to a multitude of histories, the wills and will-bes, then sighs, narrowing his eyes in frustration. \"You hide behind your show, which turned out to be exactly as Totty'd said it would, you big sell-out, you hide behind a camera lens, and your half-truths, and your fucking propriety, and I want to see whatever's beneath them. And then I want to see underneath that. I want to see underneath the underneath.\" Stunned, Irwin opens his mouth, but the words aren't there. They haven't been written yet. \"And don't say it'll pass, it's a phase, the literature said so. That's a load of balls. I want to know. And I find that I'm one of those people who can't distance themselves from the things they want to know.\" Dakin's suddenly in front of him, so close they share the same breath. Inhale, exhale. Strong hands, fingers that have calluses on them from holding hundreds of pens too tightly, lift and cup Irwin's face, and Irwin thinks that this is what insanity must feel like. \"Dakin…\" \"I remember learning about the Americans and their war with the natives. There's a double-standard in that history,\" Dakin murmurs, but his voice rattles Irwin's insides around, as if he were holding thunder in his grasp. \"There always is,\" Irwin whispers, eyes sliding shut as his lips brush against warm flesh accidentally. Dakin is going to shake him apart, until there is nothing left but ruin among the ruins. \"Even before you showed up, we always took different sides. Used to root for the Indians, we did. Not to pass any exam, mind you, but we didn't think it was fair that when the cavalry won it was a great victory, and when the Indians won it was a massacre.\" Dakin smiles and Irwin can feel it. \"Why is it that a teacher is a paedophile if he wants a student, but a student asking a teacher out for a drink, or for a walk through Roche Abbey, is merely idol-worship gone awry, or a game? Why the double-standard, sir ?\" Inhale, exhale. Irwin draws a shuddering breath in, Dakin's own mingling with it. Irwin can taste mint toothpaste and something uniquely Dakin. \"I'm not your teacher anymore.\" A slow grin breaks over Dakin's face like the sun. \"Maybe we don't have such a long way to go, after all.\" Irwin shakes his head and steps back. Disappointment flashes across Dakin's face. \"No.\" \"Why not?\" Dakin asks in the next breath, barely allowing Irwin to finish speaking. He'd done that in the classroom that day, Irwin thinks. Trying to cut him off, so impatient to knock him down. \"We're not in class, you're not my teacher, and I'm not your student --\" \"You were,\" Irwin mutters, swallowing his pride and hunkering down to sit in the grass. Dakin slips down easily beside him. \"I was,\" is the agreement, and Dakin leans back until he falls against the ground, head pillowed on his hands, staring up at the sky. \"Imperfect tense. Why are you so focused on the past?\" Irwin smiles wryly and looks up, wondering what is so interesting. All he sees is endless blue. An old lover from college once said he had eyes that went on for days, if only he wouldn't hide behind his glasses. \"I'm a historian. It's what I do.\" Dakin laughs. \"Never look to the future, then? This is the time / this is the place / so we look to the future…\" \"I don't know that,\" Irwin says, frowning. Dakin shrugs and smiles, closing his eyes. \"Don't own a radio? It's Genesis. Playing everywhere these days.\" Silence descends, and Irwin feels the nervousness from before slipping away, the sun's warmth leeching it out of him. With a sigh, he carefully lowers himself to lie back next to Dakin. This is what was missing before. Even with the rules of the school, with Dakin a student and therefore untouchable, there had never been this quiet easiness between them. It's comfortable. It's lulling, and everything he's dreamed of. It's the September Campaign. A hand moves with the speed of a striking snake to clamp around his arm. Irwin starts in surprise, but Dakin just gives him a little shake and releases him. \"Stop being so fucking careful.\" \"What is this, Dakin?\" Irwin murmurs. \"It's the Potsdam Conference. It's the Warsaw Uprising. It's Hitler's suicide. It's whatever you want it to be.\" Dakin rolls onto his side and props his chin up with a hand. In the sun, he looks like the Greeks' Apollo, or Byron's Don Juan, every literary hero that touched history. Beautiful men have always done note-worthy things. Dakin will be more than some tax lawyer. He will be great. \"And my name's Stuart. Unless you call all your clamoring suitors by their last names.\" It startles a laugh out of Irwin, bubbling up from deep inside, leaving him sleepy and amused. \"Oh, yes. My many, many admirers.\" \"I thought that's how it must be.\" Deft fingers, calluses and all, are on his face, plucking his glasses from his nose and placing them gently on the grass. Stuart smiles, and Japan surrenders and the war ends. \"There you are.\" Slowly, Tom smiles back and reaches out of the past, forward. \"Here I am.\" ","Summary":" The air is clean, and yet heavy with the tease of a lighter atmosphere should one be inclined to ve"},{"Movie":"History Boys","Title":"Just Another Topic","Author":"Celandine Brandybuck","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4033492","Passage":"[Chapter 1] Written for jaebi-lit for Yuletide 2007.

Taking a breath, hernpatted his bag to reassure himself that he had everything he needed:rnnotebook and pens, minirecorder to pick up anything he might missrn(although not all of his subjects were willing to let him use it, hernalways brought the machine along), cameras. Scripps took his ownrnphotographs, most of the time; only rarely did he use one of thernstaff photographers. He preferred to work alone when he could.

Ringing therndoorbell, he glanced at his watch. Precisely on time, good. Whenrnthe door opened, he was ready, his head bent slightly forward so thatrnhe looked directly at the man's face. 'Good afternoon, MisterrnIrwin.' 'Mister Scripps. I'm so very pleased to see yournagain.' Irwin's handshake was firm. 'It's been, what, twenty-threernyears? Come in.' He wheeled himself into the next room, andrnScripps followed, closing the door behind him. 'This isn't forrnyour usual paper, am I right? Not that I've anything against it, mindrnyou; reputable as they go.' 'No, this one isrnfreelance.' Scripps named the magazine at which he hoped tornplace the article, and Irwin nodded, seeming pleased. 'I knowrnthe drill. Done scores of interviews myself, now, mostly withrnhistorians.' Irwin didn't say other historians, Scrippsrnnoticed, and wondered at that. 'What angle did you want torntake? History? Politics? Television?' 'Oh, I haven't reallyrndecided,' Scripps said. He glanced around the room, which wasrnfurnished in a rather cold, high-tech style, all black and white andrngrey. It didn't look like Irwin, somehow, although what did Scrippsrnknow of him to decide that? Nothing. There was a splendidrnblack baby grand piano in one corner, and Scripps's fingers itched tornplay it, though he hadn't touched the keys in years. On top of thernpiano he saw a cluster of photographs in silver frames, too far tornmake out the pictures clearly. 'Perhaps we could begin by having yourntalk about how you came to make the television series, and then yourrnmove into politics?' 'I'm not really in politics,'rnIrwin said. 'In an advisory capacity, I'd say you are. Irnexpect readers would be interested in that.' Irwinrnshrugged. Scripps chuckled then. He'd cultivated his laugh,rndesigned it to put people at ease. 'Would you rather we just talked,rnat least to start off? I can record instead of taking notes, and ofrncourse I'll check with you before going to print.' He pulled out thernrecorder, showed it to Irwin. 'That would be fine.' Irwin'srnexpression flickered, too quickly for Scripps to decide what itrnmeant. 'The last time I saw you was at Hector's memorial service. Yournwent up to Oxford then – which college was it?' 'Merton.'rnScripps adjusted the recorder's volume. 'Ah yes. You readrnhistory, like the others, but became a journalist—I've read yourrnpieces here and there.' 'Followed in your footsteps, in arnway.' Irwin gazed at him speculatively, his eyes hidden by thernlight reflecting from his wire-rimmed spectacles. 'I suppose that'srnso. When you're reporting on facts, and not people, you findrnmemorable angles.' 'Try to, anyhow. But what did you do, whenrnyou left Cutler's?' 'This and that for a few months. I endedrnup at the BBC fairly quickly though; an acquaintance who worked thererntold me that there was an opening for a historian on staff, and Irnapplied. It took a long time before I was in front of the cameras,rnthough.' 'Let's talk about that. You proposed thernseries \"Second Look\", right? It wasn't someone else's idearnthat you were hired on to do, but your own creation?' 'Completelyrnmine. I'd been tossing the idea about with a few friends who workedrnthere, and decided it was good enough to try to make it happen. Wernwere filming the first show when I had the accident.' 'Whatrnaccident?' Scripps asked. 'It was ridiculous. I'd had a fewrndrinks, it was January and there'd been some freezing drizzle, and Irnslipped on my own front steps.' Irwin snorted softly. 'Mind you, Irnmightn't have done if my leg hadn't been bad from Hector's motorbike,rnbut still.' 'So you've been in the wheelchair for... howrnlong?' 'Fifteen – no, nearly sixteen years, I suppose. Irndon't actually have to use it; I can walk with a cane if Irnneed to, but...' He shrugged. 'The chair lets me do much more than Irncould otherwise. Good for the cameras, too.' 'I suppose so,'rnsaid Scripps thoughtfully. He imagined that it was probably quiternpainful for Irwin to walk or stand for long, although that wasn'trnsomething the other man would admit in so many words. 'So then yournhad to convince the producers to re-film that episode, and keep onrnwith making the rest despite your handicap.' 'Yes, exactly.rnBut they'd put too much into it to pull out, luckily.

Irwinrnnodded. 'Several. But wait a minute; I'd rather like a cup of tea.rnYou?' 'Thanks, I would.' Scripps watched Irwin wheel himselfrnout of the room. He stopped the recorder and stood. It wouldrndoubtless be several minutes before Irwin returned; no harm inrnlooking about. One could tell a lot from the art that a subjectrnowned, for instance. On the glossy pale grey walls was arnseries of framed line drawings, clearly all by the same artist.rnScripps looked at one carefully; it took him a long moment to realisernthat it was meant to show two men entwined. He couldn't decipher thernartist's signature and didn't recognise the work, deciding that Irwinrnhad either known the creator or bought them all at once, perhaps fromrna gallery's show. He looked at the pictures on the piano next,rnand was shocked to see his own young face. Somehow Irwin had got holdrnof the photograph taken at Fountains Abbey. There they all were:rnCrowther and Akhtar, Lockwood and Rudge and Timms, Posner and Dakinrnand Scripps himself. Irwin. Totty. Hector. He could almost smell thernexhaust from the motorbike, feel the weight of Tudor EconomicrnDocuments, Volume Two against his thighs. Scripps shookrnhis head slowly and glanced at the other photographs. One showedrnIrwin with an older couple, presumably his parents, and another was arnformal portrait of parents and two children. The woman resembledrnIrwin – his sister, Scripps supposed. Odd to think of Irwin asrnhaving a family, but of course he must. The surface of thernpiano had a thin film of dust over it; several cleaner streaksrnsuggested that additional pictures had been removed – for therninterview? A noise in the hallway alerted him to Irwin's return, andrnhe quickly sat back down. Irwin had a tray balanced across thernarms of his chair, with tea things on it. 'Milk, no sugar,'rnScripps murmured, and Irwin poured and passed a cup to him, then setrnthe tray aside on a low table. 'So tell me about one of yourrnfavourites of the programmes you made, then,' said Scripps after he'drntaken a sip. Irwin leaned back in his chair, crossing one legrnover the other and balancing his cup on his knee. 'There have been sornmany...' he said reflectively. 'I suppose it would have to be one ofrnthe medieval ones. That was always my favourite field, yournunderstand, although I didn't teach it to you boys as yourrnexamination was only on modern history. Perhaps the programme on KingrnJohn.' Scripps thought he might have seen the one that Irwinrnmeant, but he asked anyway. 'What was it about? Why did yournparticularly enjoy making that one?' 'John is universallyrnacknowledged as a bad king, and he hasn't had a group diligentlyrnworking to rehabilitate his reputation as Richard III has had. YetrnJohn managed to keep his throne to the end of his life, unlike forrninstance Edward II or Richard II. So I decided to see if I could showrnhim in a more positive light.' 'How did you cope withrnRunnymede and Magna Carta? Surely it's difficult to explain away openrnrebellion and the imposition of a baronial council with executivernauthority greater than the king's.' 'Ah, but by 1215 John hadrnalready surrendered England to the pope, and received it back as arnpapal vassal. He wasn't the only monarch in Europe to have done so,rneither. But that meant that when the barons forced John to acceptrntheir charter, he could escape his oath not just by saying that itrnhad been made under duress, but also that it had been given withoutrnthe consent of his own overlord, and was therefore invalid. Not asrnweak and foolish a move as has generally been argued.' Scrippsrnnodded. It was the same approach that Irwin had used time and againrnas a teacher, and that he himself had found effective as arnjournalist: look at the usual interpretation of events, thernstraightforward one, and then twist it, see if there was some way tornstrike out along a new path. As a technique it certainly generatedrncontroversy, but for a programme on the BBC that was no bad thing. Itrnhad kept the ratings of Irwin's programmes high year after year. 'Dornyou think it was that episode of the programme that led to you goingrninto government?' he probed. Irwin frowned. 'I told you, I'vernnever \"gone into government\" in any formal sense. I'mrnmerely a consultant for various M.P.s. But no, I doubt that it wasrnany particular topic that brought me to Parliamentary attention. Irnimagine that I simply seemed a person who could explain historicalrnbackgrounds in a way that would be, shall we say, accessible.' 'Irnwondered. Trial by jury was established partly by Magna Carta, afterrnall, and it's known that you were advising the M.P.s on the bill lastrnyear that would have limited such trials, the \"Safe Streets\"rnone. I must say I'm glad it didn't pass. I'm curious if whether as arnprivate citizen, as opposed to a political consultant, you felt itrnwas a good idea?' With a shrug Irwin replied, 'Does it matter?rnAs you say, the bill failed to pass.' 'Mm.' Scripps had heardrnenough evasions to know that Irwin wouldn't say more. 'Well. Whatrnplans for the future? Will there be another series of historyrnprogrammes, or are you finished with those, do you think? Where dornyou see yourself in the next few years?' 'I've been offeredrnanother series, but I haven't decided if I will take it up. I dornrather enjoy making them, knowing that perhaps a few millions willrnsee each one, sooner or later, and learn something about their past –rnfor it is their past, our past, all of ours, no matterrnwhat our actual ancestry might be. The past of the nation isrnpertinent to all of its citizens. But filming episodes tends torninvolve a good deal of travel, and that's not easy with my leg as itrnis. I like to spend my nights at home, these days.' His mouth quirkedrnin a half-smile. 'My partner prefers it that way, too.' Scrippsrnfelt his eyebrows rise despite himself. He would never have expectedrnthe Irwin he'd known all those years ago to be so forthcoming aboutrnhis personal life, especially given his close-mouthedness about hisrnpolitical opinions... and the missing photographs on the piano.rn'That's understandable.' 'So I may instead stick with thernpolitical consulting, now that it seems that will be regular. I can'trnsay more. Was there anything else that you needed from me?' 'I'drnlike to take a few pictures, if that's all right. In your study? Irnthink it would go down well do show you at your desk, with books andrnso on.' 'All right; follow me.' Scripps picked up hisrncamera bag and walked after Irwin down a wide hallway. The study wasrnquite unlike the living room, looking much more well used andrnscholarly, with piles of books and papers leaning precariously fromrnevery available surface. Green-papered walls, almost invisible behindrnladen bookshelves, contrasted with white curtains. The desk was arnwarm scarred wood, and Irwin looked perfectly natural and at ease asrnhe wheeled himself behind it. 'Like this?' 'That shouldrndo nicely.' Scripps took several shots while standing, choosingrndifferent angles, then knelt to photograph Irwin from below. Fromrnhere the bones in his face came into sharper relief, giving anrnimpression not so much of age as wisdom, an image that Irwinrndoubtless cultivated. If the picture turned out well, it might evenrnlead the spread. 'Thank you very much,' Scripps said at last,rnstanding and holding out his hand to Irwin. 'I think this will makernan excellent piece, and I'll be in touch with you to double-check anyrnquotations if the recording isn't clear.' Irwin's hand wasrncool and dry. 'I look forward to it.' 'I can see myself out,'rnsaid Scripps as Irwin began to wheel himself out from behind therndesk. 'I've already interrupted your afternoon long enough.' Irwinrnnodded. 'A good day to you, then, Mister Scripps.' He moved back andrnpressed the power button on his computer, the blue glow reflectingrnfrom his spectacles as the screen lit up. Scripps walkedrnslowly down the hall, observing again the quality of the decor.rnWhatever Irwin's partner might do must be well-remunerated. He hadrnjust reached the front door and was about to turn the handle when hernheard the murmur of two voices behind him and half-turned to see thernoutline of a figure standing in the hall at the door to Irwin'srnstudy. 'Did the interview go well?' Scripps heard. Thatrnvoice – Scripps recognised it instantly, but he let himself quietlyrnout and heard the latch click shut behind him. Obviously Dakin hadrnbeen there all along; if he had wanted to say hello, he could haverndone. Scripps smiled wryly to himself. So all these years later, theyrneach got what they wanted, hadn't they?

The themes are from the \"Beta\" set. These are not in chronological order. (April 18, 2008) #15 - Breathing When Dakin approaches him at Lockwood's funeral, all Tom can think is \"oh, for crying out loud\"; it helps take his mind off the way his breath rattles in his throat, especially where the boy -- man -- in the casket will never draw one of his own again. #42 - Neutral \"Surprise, Poland,\" Dakin says with a smile when he calls Irwin at home (he'd gleaned the number and address off of an easily-manipulated secretary at the BBC, flashing a smile with a hint of sadness), even though he'd always considered Tom Irwin to be more Switzerland than anything else. #1 - Walking At the very least the accident was an inconvenience, as Tom wants nothing more than to be able to stroll through the vast grounds of Tintern Abbey at his leisure. #27 - Jester \"A speaker once told De Gaulle that he resembled Robespierre and De Gaulle responded, \"I always thought I was Jeanne d'Arc and Bonaparte -- how little one knows oneself!,\" Dakin says with a grin, and Irwin bursts into laughter over his account of the battle of Montcornet, unable to hold it in any longer. #17 - Belief Dakin hated Irwin after he'd left the Corpus administration building that day, not because that the man had lied but rather because he'd believed it. #22 - Quirks He notices one day as they argue over coffee if Appropriation art can even be considered art that Irwin's left incisor will sometimes poke out to grasp his bottom lip when Dakin has him on the ropes, and Dakin is appalled to find it incredibly charming. #9 - War \"The Treaty of Versailles is the reason that National Socialism rose in Germany and that the second World War came about, so fuck you very much, sir -- Oh, are we still on for dinner this Saturday?\" #50 - Defeat Dakin, stretched out on his couch and smoking a cigarette, watches Irwin interview another historian, Mr. Cooke -- it's all vaguely interesting until Irwin annihilates the other man with an off-hand remark about he was so sure that everyone knew that Ernst vom Rath's homosexuality was a mere rumor fabricated by the Gestapo and that his sexual orientation had nothing to do with the horrors that took place on Krystallnacht and was Mr. Cooke trying to imply something? #31 - Smirk (sequel to Defeat) Dakin says, \"You didn't have to murder the man, you know\", and Irwin looks up from his notes for the next documentary, proud, the corners of his lips quirking up evilly. #44 - Near The feeling he gets when Dakin uncaringly wraps his arm around his waist in public can't be categorized, or found anywhere else -- not in Irwin's books, or his studies, or in his past. #23 - Question The grass is green, the sky is blue, but when Dakin asks, \"Out of everyone else, why me\" Irwin can't find an answer that will fit in the order of life, or the messy pattern of history. #3 - Wishes \"I would've carried you, you know,\" Dakin mutters next to him, flicking his just-lit cigarette away; Irwin shrugs, tipping his chin back to catch the sun's rays, comfortable in the grass of Fountains, and says, \"Like fuck.\" #39 - Share They finally make good on that drink in a pub near Bradford, and it isn't awkward as Tom always imagined it would be, especially when Dakin reaches over and finishes off his lager without asking. #35 - Sarcasm \"That's a mighty long 'thank you',\" Scripps says on the other line in lieu of a 'hello, Stu, how have you been, it's been ages since I've last talked to you, how's law?' #28 - Jousting \" En garde, \" Dakin shouts, thrusting at an invisible assailant with a wooden spoon, and Irwin just stands in the doorway, surveying his ruined kitchen (not that it was anything special to begin with) and wondering how long it will take to get the tomato sauce out of the upholstery. #13 - Bias They are on holiday, walking among the grounds of Notre Dame de Paris, taking in the cathedral; Irwin complains that while it is the most famous of the Notre Dame churches it is hardly the most beautiful (with the Montreal basilica taking that title, hands-down), and Dakin tries not to snicker every time Irwin says 'flying buttress'. #18 - Balloon There is a little girl crying on the banks of the Seine, and Dakin buys her a large, floating Mickey Mouse just to shut her up -- Irwin takes three pictures. #36 - Sordid For the first eight months, it is kept secret, and Irwin wonders when it will come spilling out, his role of the great Stuart Dakin's mistress, and if it will end the whole thing. #5 - Worry The world is suddenly on a startlingly different axis and the sky is a hazy shade of white, but Irwin's always been partial to snowy skies; Dakin's heart is in his throat as he stumbles across the ice, \"'Let's go ice skating, Stuart, it's been ages since I've gone' -- There's a good fucking reason for that, you stupid cripple!\" #16 - Breaking Tom can feel his back arch off of the sheets as Stuart thrusts steadily, murmuring some kind of verse at him that he can't hear because something inside is stirring, fusing together, shell and stone and seawater, until it's Atlantis smashing against the cliffs of Dover. #21 - Quiet Sometimes they just read together, settled into each other, lost in times long since past and words long since spoken. #20 - Bane It's funny how Irwin can make 'Happy anniversary' sound like 'I've resisted the urge to pour arsenic into your coffee for the last 365 days'. #32 - Sorrow Every once in a great while, Irwin will stop and close his eyes, remembering the sound of a motorbike hitting the pavement; he likes to think that's what the end of all things sounds like. #45 - Natural It's easy, more than, to look at Tom and acknowledge that it was inevitable. #7 - Wasteland \"With a shower of rain, can we stop in the colonnade and go on in sunlight, into the Hofgarten, and drink coffee and talk for an hour--\"; Irwin rubs his temples, mutters, \"Shut up, Dakin\", and hangs up the phone. #38 - Sojourn \"I'm going away for a little bit, perhaps a month or two, in order to film a piece on the pyramids and -- Look, if you're going to be like that, then just come with me, you scheming wanker.\" #26 - Jump It would be so simple, so ridiculously effortless for Dakin to just pitch himself off of whatever plateau of superiority he's been living on and into Irwin's arms -- Irwin, skinny as he is, would have no trouble catching him. #4 - Wonder They are on Bear Lake, staring at the explosion of light and color whispering a scream above them; Stuart takes Tom's hand into his and doesn't let go. #49 - Victory \"Hah,\" Dakin smirks, and Irwin stares at his fallen army, blaming Hasbro for all of it. #25 - Quitting Left behind in the classroom, still leaning against the window as if Dakin were still crowding him, Irwin removes his glasses and thinks this teaching thing isn't quite working out while his \"diary\" burns a hole in his trouser pocket. #11 - Birthday Stuart bought him the complete works of Samuel Johnson -- there are no words to describe Tom's joy, none. #2 - Waltz It's a dance -- not an all that complex one, at that -- between them, and despite the pain in his leg Irwin doesn't wish for the music to end (even if Dakin has two left feet). #30 - Just Stuart kept all of his essays from that extra term, and there are times when he will slide the folder marked 'Oxbridge-Bound' out from the third left drawer of his desk and re-read the cramped handwriting marked in the margins, blood-spattered commentary that he's had memorized for years; he remembers his younger self complaining of how unfair it all was… he remembers a lot of things about his younger self. #40 - Solitary He thinks of Irwin more than he ought to: during class, during breakfast, during lunch, during dinner, during the night… but it's all right, he supposes, if he's the only one who knows. #14 - Burning There is smoke in his kitchen, but Tom hands Stuart the signed papers with a simple, \"Count your lucky stars that I can't sue you for property damage now.\" #19 - Balcony \" Time for you and time for me / And time yet for a hundred indecisions / And for a hundred visions and revisions / Before the taking of a toast and tea ,\" Tom says softly, bringing the morning air with him from the veranda, but Stuart takes the coffee that's offered to him anyway, letting the other man off the hook for waking him up at obscene o'clock in the morning without a complaint. #33 - Stupidity \"You never really wanted to suck me off back then,\" Irwin laughs, delicately sawing off a small sliver of cheese cake with his fork, and Dakin shrugs and thinks wrong again . #34 - Serenade Stuart stands in the doorway, silent as a wraith, as Tom putters around his office, singing loudly that wild horses couldn't drag him away. #8 - Whiskey and Rum \"I love you,\" Dakin says, swaying on Irwin's welcome mat, his glassy eyes a paint smudge in an otherwise perfect portrait of confidence -- Irwin lets him sleep it off on his couch with a promise that they'll talk if any of this is remembered in the morning. #12 - Blessing (sequel to Whiskey and Rum) Dakin wakes up on the sofa and smiles through his hangover. #43 - Nuance Dakin can tell when Irwin's talking about a topic that bores him; there is the slightest variation to the way he says his R's, and Dakin makes sure to not bring up George Boleyn the next time they go out for drinks and a bite. #29 - Jewel They've been meeting up a few times a week for the last three and a half months, and when Irwin sits down, sporting a shiny pin badge given to him 'by a lovely man after the Charles II special aired', Dakin has two drinks for every one that Irwin orders. #10 - Weddings \"What the hell could be so important that you and Pos felt the need to go all the way to fucking Massachusetts for it,\" Stuart asks Scripps, curious at the barely-contained joy in that Yorkshire drawl. #41 - Nowhere \"Where to this month,\" Stuart inquires, tired, blinking in confusion when Tom shakes his head and asks if the sheets are clean. #24 - Quarrel Stuart slams cabinet doors and drawers and books and papers and he thunders up the stairs and clears his throat far more often than necessary, but it's Tom's silence that speaks the loudest. #6 - Whimsy Dakin watches the Empress give a tiny grain of sand to a little boy and wonders what he would wish for if the choice was his (he knows, he knows, he knows, he knows). #47 - Valiant Irwin smiles at the steadying hand on his arm, saving him from what would have been a rather nasty tumble on a patch of ice, ignoring his hero's comment of \"if those glasses are doing shit, then maybe you should take them off.\" #48 - Virtuous What kind of man (the best kind) would have students lie about themselves, to lock away their true feelings and politics, in order to make it into a stupid school? #37 - Soliloquy \" Told by an idiot, signifying nothing ,\" Dakin mutters, all because Irwin called him 'Stuart' and his heart hasn't stopped pounding for two days. #46 - Horizon They sit up and talk, spent and new, as light breaks over the houses; And where mortal men would stare at the place where earth meets sky they only have eyes for each other.

He is quite sure, however, that Dakin is unpreparednto admit to anyone – even Irwin, even himself – that there mightnbe more between them than a long-ago infatuation and some present-daynsex, however good the latter might be. Dakin once accused himnof being intellectually amoral, yet emotionally craven. It had beenntrue, then.

Please. Don't make me go get Mom.nFine, Eleanor, I'm going to go across the street.\", and she did. Emily snuck to the backnof the house, and got her brother's attention. \"Ellie locked menout of my room.\" She whispered. \"Meet us out front.\"nJaisen replied, and he and Justin ran inside the house. The three met in frontnof the large plantation and ran across the street. \"Ellie, open thendoor.\" Jaisen demanded. \"Like I didn't trynthat.\" Em replied sarcastically. \"El, I'm going tonsmoke you out.\" Their brother tried again. \"Watch out.\" Justinnknelt in front of the door, and picked the lock. \"Thank you.\" Emilynreplied, and went into her room. \"Stay here.\" She closed the doornbehind her.

You'll be fine.\" Justin laughed. \"And if you aint,ntell them you know me, and you will be.\" \"Cool.\" Jaisennand Justin slapped hands and watched Ellie and Emmy walk out of thenhouse. \"Eleanor, I can'tnbelieve you wont go change.\" Em was whining. \"You go change,nEmily.\" El spat. It was their first day atnthe community college in Alabama, and they had decided to wear thensame outfit. \"Because I wasndressed first.\" Emmy shrieked. \"I don't care.\"nEllie sat next to Jaisen. Emmy screammed loudly asnshe walked back into the house, and stomped up the stairs.

I think it's fun to mess with her.\"nEllie explained. \"That's mean.\"nJustin said through his laughter. Emily screamed loudly formninside, and Justin offered to go check on her. After he walkedninside, El and Jaisen started talking. \"You think he and her arengoing to hook up?\" Jaisen asked his sister. \"She seems obliviousnto his crush.\" Ellie laughed. \"Yeah, I guess.\"nJaisen laid back on the ground. Justin tripped on the lastnstair, and as he stood up he saw Em standing in the hallway in a pairnof jeans and a pink tee-shirt. \"Why'd you scream?\" he askednher. \"Why'd you trip?\"nEmily giggled. \"I asked you first.\"nJustin follewed her into her bedroom. \"This shirt isnsupposed to be white.\" Em explained. \"Ellie washed it withnher red socks that she is wearing today.\" \"Oh.

Please review! Dakin loved his car. Like everything else good in this world, from art to pasta, it was Italian. The fact that it was sleek, red, shiny, and purred as he sped didn't hurt either. If clients would respond like his car did, his life would be so much easier. He shook his head, trying not to think about clients on this particular Friday night as he sped down the street. The fact he had nothing to go home to didn't mean he should think about work . Suddenly, tires squealed nearby. Dakin searched for the source, but didn't see the boxy grey van until it was nearly on top of him. The van slid sideways into the side of his car, pushing it to the shoulder before finally stopping. Dakin briefly checked himself for injuries before leaping out of his car. Theoretically, he needed insurance information. In reality, he was just furious. \"WHAT THE FUCK?\" he screamed as he rounded the car and headed toward the van, where a tall redheaded woman climbed out of the driver's seat. \"Do you think the road is your personal fucking bumper car park?\" The woman ran a hand through her short, cropped hair. \"Shut it, you overpaid prat,\" she snapped, surveying the van for damage. There was a small dent in the van and both vehicles would need new paint, but overall it didn't seem too bad. \"Prat?\" Dakin screamed, charging up to the woman. He heard the sound of metal hitting the pavement. He refused to look for the source, sure it was his bumper hitting the ground. \"Do you have amnesia as well as an utter inability to drive properly? As I recall, cars are supposed to go forward -\" \"You're just upset that your shiny toy got touched by someone else!\" yelled the woman, looking down at him. \"Not only is this piece of junk utterly destroyed-\" \"-You're lucky that deathbeast didn't kill-\" \"-Me? Why thanks for your concern-\" A soft voice interrupted their bickering match. \"I think that's quite enough noise, don't you?\" The verbal combatants turned to face the voice. It was a youngish man, about a half-decade Dakin's senior, with dark hair and glasses. He wheeled himself over to the pair using his wheelchair. \"Tom, this insolent child has been yelling and just look at the-\" began the redhead. \"It's alright,\" he interrupted. \"I'm fine. The equipment is alright.\" \"That doesn't mean that this boy can go about screaming at people who have been through a trauma -\" \" Julie ,\" he interrupted again, this time more firmly. \"I'm fine. It's alright.\" He turned the chair to face Dakin. \"Are you alright?\" \"Yes, sir,\" answered Dakin automatically. He gasped slightly as he fully realized who he was talking to. Evidently the man in the chair did too. \"Dakin?\" \"Unusual circumstances, huh?\" \"Aren't they always?\" Irwin smiled slightly. \"Glad to see you're alright. Julie, could you call the studio and order a car for us?\" \"Can you ride in a normal car, sir?\" Dakin covered his mouth. He couldn't believe his curiosity and brashness. He was a polished lawyer now, not a schoolboy. \"How dare you, you insolent little-\" began the redhead again. \"Julie, please. Mr. Dakin is an old friend. The studio will be worried if we're not back soon. Please?\" He gave her a small smile and she nodded, kissing him on the cheek before heading down the block. \"Yes, I can ride in a normal car. The van is just more convenient with all the equipment.\" Dakin nodded. \"For your program? I haven't had time to watch much, but I quite like it.\" \"Thank you,\" answered Irwin smoothly. \"That tends to be the reaction I've gotten from my former students.\" The younger man visibly flinched. \"Are you… in touch with many of them?\" It had been nearly a decade since he'd started at Oxford. He couldn't remember the last time he'd seen his old classmates. \"Scripps and I tend to run into each other at industry events. He brings Posner along sometimes. Dot and I correspond a bit as well, now that she's retired.\" He shrugged, as if to say I didn't expect you to . \"That's, um, nice. I'm glad. They quite liked you.\" Irwin gave a little laugh, but said nothing. Dakin put his hands in his pockets and shuffled about a bit. A half-block away, Julie was telling the tale of her near death experience to a colleague at a payphone. The hand motions were grower ever larger. \"Is she always like that?\" Dakin asked, staring slightly. The older man sighed. \"Only when it comes to me and deadlines. She likes to think she can make up for the lack of my legs and a staffing shortage all the time if she tries hard enough.\" \"Some people are always like that.\" He paused slightly, and then ventured the question that had been twisting in the base of his stomach since Irwin had entered the conversation. \"Are you two happy together?\" Irwin seemed puzzled by the question, wrinkling his brow and reaching up a hand to rub his temple. \"We work well together.\" Dakin snorted. \"Now that's a ringing endorsement.\" The former teacher raised a dark eyebrow. \"It's what I look for in an assistant.\" \"And a… companion?\" He flinched inwardly at the awkward term. \"No,\" said Irwin with surprising sternness. \"Just an assistant.\" Dakin blushed. \"Oh. I'm sorry. She just…\" He shrugged. \"She's affectionate. We've worked together since she started at the BBC. Sometimes it feels like we're the only ones they're working at all.\" The lawyer laughed. \"I know the feeling. I keep waiting to walk in on my secretary and the senior partner. The number of breaks they take suggests he has shocking stamina.\" The two laughed for a moment, suddenly completely at ease. Then Julie returned, shooting Dakin a loathing glare. \"Well, I can get a car here relatively soon, but it'll take forever to load the equipment into it and we have to do a triple equipment check to make sure nothing was broken before we check it in and then we'll have to file an incident report and I still haven't worked out a tow and it might be pretty crammed in the car-\" \"Do you both have to be there for the paperwork and checks?\" asked Dakin suddenly. \"That's none of your business,\" snapped Julie. \"Now, as I was saying, I don't know who they're going to send out and if it's Daryl in his tiny little car it might take a few trips and-\" \"I can take some of it,\" offered Dakin suddenly. He bit his lip but the words kept coming out. \"I can take Irwin and some of the equipment and he can get started on the paperwork and you can follow with the rest-\" \"Dr. Irwin does not do paperwork on a Friday night!\" screeched Julie. \"I am responsible-\" \"Julie,\" said Irwin in the same soft tone he had silenced her with earlier. \"It's a good idea.\" \"I don't care if it solves world hunger! You have plans and-\" \"They can wait til tomorrow,\" he said patiently. \"Dakin, are you sure you don't mind? I'm sure you have somewhere to be.\" Dakin shrugged. \"Nothing that can't wait til later.\" \"Still no sodding datebook?\" teased Irwin. \"Tom!\" Julie was plainly horrified, although Dakin couldn't discern if it was Irwin's language or his agreement to the plan that was the issue. \"I'll see you at the studio, Julie. With any luck, we'll both be done before midnight and can get a well deserved rest.\" Abashed, Julie nodded. She opened the back doors of the van and began loading camera equipment into Dakin's car. She then helped Irwin into the passenger's seat, folding his chair and stowing it in the back seat. Dakin couldn't help wanting to shove her when she left her hand on Irwin once he was safely in the car. He quickly went round to the driver's seat and started the car. It still made the same beautiful noise as always. \"Ready to go?\" he asked. Irwin nodded gratefully. \"Do you know the way to the BBC station?\" \"I've got something of an idea. You'll correct me if I get off track?\" Irwin smirked slightly. \"Always.\" Dakin laughed and nudged him slightly with his elbow. \"Tosser.\" \"Prat,\" shot back his former teacher with affection. The two sat in amicable silence. Halfway there, Irwin reached for the dash and turned on the radio. Normally, Dakin would have been furiously annoyed. No one manipulated his car . Somehow, Irwin touching it seemed like the most natural gesture in the world. \"Here we are,\" announced Dakin quietly when they reached the studio lot. A few scrawny boys who looked just out of university approached the car. Irwin waved at them. \"I didn't know you hired children,\" he teased. \"They give the place some life,\" replied Irwin. He rolled the window down and instructed them where the equipment should go. One of them reached for the back seat and Irwin's chair. \"I've got that!\" called Dakin, who got out of the car and brought it around to Irwin's door. \"How does this usually work?\" he whispered when Irwin opened the door. \"Just give me your arms. I can lift myself into it.\" Dakin nodded and complied. It felt strangely nice to help his teacher into the chair that had once so terrified him. \"Thank you. It was good to see you.\" Irwin sat there for a moment, and then wheeled himself towards the building entrance. He was nearly to the door when Dakin called out. \"What're you doing tonight?\" Irwin smirked. \"Well, I thought I might log some equipment and check it for damages.\" Dakin nearly smacked himself in the head. \"What about after that?\" He strode toward Irwin before he lost his nerve. \"What about a drink afterward?\" \"It's nearly eleven and I have to do a shoot tomorrow. I'm sorry.\" Irwin did look genuinely sorry. Dejected, even. He opened the door and wheeled himself inside. Dakin caught the door just in time. \"What about a drink while you work? There's a shop just around the corner. I can grab a case and help you.\" Irwin wheeled around and smiled. The full, grateful, brilliant, inspired smile Dakin remembered from school. \"I suppose I could use someone to carry things to inventory until Julie gets back.\" He grinned. \"I suppose I could do that.\" \"Then go get us some beer and get this out of the subjunctive,\" replied Irwin. \"Yes, sir,\" replied Dakin cockily. He jaunted the entire way to the store in a way he hadn't since that last day of school so many years ago. ","Summary":" Intended as a prequel to my \"Night Morning\" fic. Please review!

She was holding Charlie as she tried to give Bryant his breakfast. He leaned to kiss her, and instead Charlie pleaded to change hands.

She smiled and he looked at Jake \"Hey, I almost forgot, Laura called\" Melanie said. Jake's body tightened. His children looked at his confused, but he concentrated on helping Charlie eat \"Who's that?\" JJ asked. He was sure; he had never heard that name before. He knew everyone in town \"It's an old friend of me and daddy\" Melanie said cheerfully, but JJ noticed his father was still tense \"it's just that daddy, didn't like her that much\" \"Why not?\"Henry asked interested \"Oh, it's a long story\" Melanie told him.

She had always been kind of a tomboy which had ended up being a great dissapoment for her mother \"This is not a little girl's job\" JJ said from the truck \"it's a man's job\" \"Shut up!\" Molly said angrily \"I can do it better than you!\" \"I don't think you can Mol, sorry\" \"I can!\" Jake climbed down the truck and kneeled on his daughter's level \"I'm sure, you can baby girl, but I need you to stay here and help mummy cook something for her annoying friend Laura\" Melanie wasn't happy, but the comment made Molly smile \"can you do that?\" she nodded and returned where her mother and little brother stood \"I'll be back soon\" Jake kissed Melanie sweetly and started the truck Back at the house.

But I just watched the movie again today and decided to give it a try. Let's see then… Chapter4: JJ still thought there was something a bit odd about the way Jake had behaved regarding this Laura person \"Boys!\" \"Hey mama\" JJ said hurrying to the side of the truck \"Hello\" he said politely at the woman and their children. \"Hey baby where's your dad?\" Melanie knew that if JJ was anything like Jake he was probably overthinking the whole situation. \"Well Laura this is JJ, and that one over there is Henry\" The 5 year old joined at the sight of his name. \"I thought you said you had three boys?\" Laura said glancing at the boys. She examined them closely as if she was trying to figure something out. Jake stood in the kitchen holding little Charlie. If this woman had known better she would have never come back, this was nuts. Like Yankee nuts. He raised his face when he saw Melanie and the others enter. \"Well, I have now seen it all\" Lauren said jokingly \"Jake Perry, Mr. Mom?\" only you could get a hold on a southern boy like that Melanie, I give you that much\" Melanie smiled and walked over to Jake, she grabbed his hand and touched the back of his head \"I'll go put the baby down\" He said smiling sarcastically at Laura. \"Come on JJ\" The boy followed his father up the stairs, followed by Molly. Only Melanie and Henry remained with Laura and her kids \"don't mind him\" Melanie told them as she saw they were taken aback \"We all had a very long day\" Jake had secretly called Bobby Ray so he would take Laura and the kids to the inn. \"I am sorry if we caused any trouble Laura apologized a moment later. \"I didn't mean to upset Jake\" \"Don't worry, you didn't he's just got a lot on his mind\" Melanie said as she walked them out to Bobby Ray's truck. Jake approached Laura. \"I am sorry, just don't see the point of you being here\" He glanced at the children \"Nice kids you got there, looks like you really finally made something of yourself, I mean you did want to fly being seeing this town was too little for you\" \"Thank you, but I think that was a long time ago Jake, and I get why you and I aren't the best of friends, but I thought your mama had raised you best\" \"She raised me fine\" Molly glanced nervously. This was getting somewhere Melanie didn't want it to go, not in front of the kids. \"Jake?\" Melanie found him in their room later that night once the kids were sleeping \"Mind explaining what was all that about?\" \"Nothing\" He said without looking at her \"I am sorry, I just don't like her\" \"Well\" She sat next to him on the bed \"That is obvious and I know you don't like her but it's been a long time baby\" \"Not enough\" Jake said dryly.

In particular… her. Chapter 1 - Target Scripps had never envied the sex. Only Dakin's being up for it. That, to him, was a much bigger deal. Posner's defence had been to want exclusively, excruciatingly the unattainable. Aktar had had his huge and traditional family between him and any such possibilities. Timms wouldn't have been many girls' choice, and Scripps himself had had the rule books of religion on his side but Crowther, Lockwood, Rudge and Dakin – they'd all been up for it. Well up for it. If Scripps were honest with himself, their sexual activities were the last thing he would have judged his classmates for. His religious beliefs had nothing particular to say about sex. It was him that had the problem with it. It wasn't wrong for anyone, it just wasn't right for him. Not then. But now… maybe. His college had been one of the first to admit women. They nearly outnumbered the men, actually. And there was this pretty physicist. Except that it wasn't that she was pretty - it was that she sang better than Pos, she joked better than Dakin, she argued better than Irwin, she knew, and more to the point loved, all Hector's stuff… And above all that there was something more to her, something that was just her, which he wanted. He wanted to hold it, he wanted to know what it was, he wanted to be able to name that something about her – something about the way she walked, the way she thought, the way she played with her hair, the way she spoke. Through school it had all been about getting the grades, for the sake of the future, and then, for that last extra term, about getting to Oxford, for the sake of the future. Now it was all about getting her, for the sake of the future. Perhaps, if he got her, he might be able to live in the present…[Chapter 2] Chapter 2 – Align His lectures were always in the morning. He had tutes at the weirdest of times. And in the weirdest of places. He'd met Professor Huntley at the Balfour Library last week. They'd had to walk from Pitt Rivers back to college, so most of the conversation was done in motion, which had been rather awkward to say the least, although the majority of his time during the day was spent in libraries when he was out of rehearsals anyway, so it was sort of convenient. Her lectures were at a range of times. Her tutes and classes and lab sessions were in the afternoons. But she came to the theatre. She'd seen a lot of his productions. He hoped that might mean more than similar tastes in plays. The issue was he only ever spoke to her at dinner or in people's rooms. There were always other people around, always several conversations at once. He was a little worried that nothing would ever happen between them if he just let things develop naturally. But he couldn't see how he could force their spending more time together. He wondered why he always used gerunds when he thought about the two of them. Hector would have approved. Hector would have said there was something of sharing in it, something of wanting them to both have ownership of the same thing, and so be involved in it together. Well that was true. But he still couldn't see how to bring about any such ownership of time. They had different subjects, different routines, and different friends. They even lived in different buildings.

This is complete and rampant speculation about Dakin's family and lifestyle. I don't know what is/isn't covered in the play; I have only seen the film version. I also made up Scripps name although on this site it is listed as a D. If anyone knows it, I will correct it. Thanks! Dakin was bored. He loathed to admit it; after all only boring people are bored and Stuart Dakin was certainly not boring. It was day three of the Christmas holidays, and so far the holidays had been dismal. Day one's highlights had included taking a hot bath and his parents grilling him about school; everything from his marks to which clubs he had joined. On day two, he had been bored enough to open his books, leading his mother to gush over what a productive and obviously so intelligent boy she had raised. Obviously she hadn't caught his mental memos that he couldn't stand her and his father any longer, and was seeking solitude in his schoolbooks. As he had always done. Desperate times called for desperate measures. He was going insane in this house. He stared at the phone intently for a moment before dialing the number of someone he knew was home, probably also going mad. \"David? What's going on, mate?\" He grimaced as he realized he had called Scripps by his first name \"Well Stuart , I am just enjoying the end of term. Yourself?\" \"What are your plans for this evening?\" He said, deciding to get right to the point. \"Parents driving you mad?\" Scripps said, surprisingly sympathetic. Before Dakin could respond an enthusiastic affirmative, Scripps continued. \"I wasn't doing anything, we can go to the pub, grab a bite. Seven work for you?\" \"Absolutely mate.\" \"Right, see you then.\" Dakin made to say something but the words would not come out and Scripps had hung up anyway. He glanced at his watch, groaning. Two-thirty. It was going to be a long afternoon.[Chapter 2] A/N: I actively dislike the end of this film, and suspect I would find the play's end revolting. Dakin/Irwin. Ch 2: Scripps Dakin didn't want to admit it; but he knew he had changed in his three months at Oxford. The ever present smirk had faded along with the sheen from excessive hair gel use. Of course, other things had changed as well. Less obvious changes but just as important ones. Not being the smartest person in his classes had turned him into less of an arrogant smart-arse. He seemed more content somehow, as if he wasn't always trying to prove something to someone, or maybe it was to himself. As he walked into the pub that evening, Scripps took a minute to survey him before calling him over to where he was sitting. He had seen Dakin about six weeks ago, and yet somehow he was still surprised at how much he had changed. After all, he had known the smart mouthed, oversexed adolescent Stuart used to be for over six years. It was difficult to get that image out of his mind sometimes. Dakin gave him a genuine smile; yet another shocking sign of growth. His real smile had freaked Scripps out a bit at first but he had gotten used to it for the most part. He smiled back as he and Dakin exchanged a friendly handshake and pat on the back. Dakin's keen eyes noticed his empty glass. \"You need a refill, mate?\" Dakin was back within moments with not only two beers, but also with a double order of bangers and mash. Scripps expressed his gratitude and handed over some money. Dakin thanked him and pocketed the money. He talked with Scripps for a while; everything from their schooling, new friends, interesting classes to their fond (and not so fond) memories of Cutler's until a pause fell between them. So far there was only one thing they had avoided talking about and Scripps simply couldn't put it off any longer. Scripps looked at him seriously for a moment. \"Have you seen him?\" \"Who?\" Dakin played for time, looking at the table. Scripps stared at him levelly until Dakin finally sighed out a negative response. He shook his head before continuing. \"I last saw him at Hector's service.\" \"You should, you know. See him. You know where he is.\" \"Yeah. I'll see you-I've got to-home you know.\" He made to leave, gathering his coat quickly. \"Right. It was good to talk to you.\" They shook hands before Dakin left. Scripps watched him go, wondering if he had pushed him too far. No, he thought, Dakin needs a fire lit under him. He's always done better under pressure, after all. Outside, Dakin leaned against the pub for a moment to catch his breath. He was embarrassed to admit how affected he still was by the mention-or lack thereof-of Irwin. It wasn't as if he had thought of him every day but he had found himself wondering how Irwin would have taught this or how he would feel about an essay or even a topic. Of course, Scripps was right. He should see him. But that would mean facing his fears; his fears of being forgotten…or remembered. What if he was remembered, missed even? Of course, there was the physical and the psychological injuries Irwin had sustained. He didn't know how to, didn't want to deal with all that. It was too much to deal with right now. His head spinning, he quickly went home and went to bed where his thoughts kept him awake much longer than he was willing to admit. Damn Scripps. ","Summary":" Maybe a little Two shot regarding Dakin and Irwin… Plot: Dakin is home for the holidays, and reconn"},{"Movie":"Sweet Home Alabama","Title":"The Perry Life","Author":"Never Ending Read","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12440809","Passage":"[Chapter 1] Chapter 1: The Bar The bar remained alive with laughter, dance, and drink. For most of its inhabitants the initial excitement had worn off, but not for Melanie. She sat on a chair in the room that she and her husband , Jake Perry, had officially moved together for their first dance as husband and wife. The smile that adorned her face since melding her lips to Jake's in the storm on the beach after her almost wedding would not leave her face. Truthfully, she didn't want it to. Jake had gone over to talk to his mother, Stella, who was standing by the jukebox. Melanie's cheeks began to ache from the strain of how big her smile continued to grow. She had started this day with many doubts and concerns and had walked down the aisle with acceptance, but had ended the day absolutely sure of her position in life and even though she still had doubts, they weren't about if this is where she was meant to be, but were about how she wouldn't be able to meld herself back into her life with Jake fast enough. \"I told you darlin, that everything would work out.\" Stella said in a matter of fact manner. \"I believe what you said was one way or another, mother. But I can't believe that it has worked out this way. After all this time. Mother, I don't know how to feel.\" Jake admitted. He also had many doubts about Melanie's decision. Personally, his heart swelled with the choice she had made for them. He loved her, had always loved her and had filed away the hope for the day in the depths of his heart waiting for the right sign that would tell him it was time to let it come forth once more. He knew that since she came back to Alabama she had been conflicted with what, or who she wanted most, but Jake knew nothing of what drove her to her final decision and change of heart. Would she regret not marrying that Andrew guy a few days, weeks, or even years from now when she would be reminded that life would him wouldn't be perfect as it had never been for the two of them? The kiss on the beach had awoken feelings and truths he had been long since trying to hide, especially that day when he knew that she would be saying her vows to another man. He had spent the whole day trying to ignore the bile that rose in him every time he thought about how it was his choice that they had been allowed to get married that day. He was the one that had signed the divorce papers, after seven years of ignoring them, he should have fought harder for her, made her see somehow that they were meant for each other. \"Feel loved, darlin. Anybody who saw her now would know that's the first thing she feels for you. She chose you today. I was at that wedding, Jake, you should have seen her. She seemed so scared, uncertain and only seemed to smile because her father kept saying something to her as he lead her down the isle. She loves you, now you need to show her that her choice will never be in vain.\" Stella rubbed her son's arm as she talked to him. She knew Jake is happy, happier than he has been since Melanie left all those years ago. It would do him on good to question the reasoning behind every detail of today. He and Melanie still has a long road ahead of them, but right now she also knows that they are both on the same battlefield, working together. \"Quite a day! But we'll have to be going soon. You know, with the kids and all.\" Lurlynn said plopping down in a seat next to Melanie. \"I never would have been able to dream up this day if I wanted to. It's beyond anything I deserve.\" Melanie said shrugging. \"Oh don't say that. You and Jake both have been through a lot. And who knows what would have happened if you had stayed. Personally, I think everything worked out the way it was meant to for both of you to become the people you needed in order to be together.\" \"Wow, Lurlynn that's actually the best confidence booster I've heard all day. I'm just afraid I'll wake up tomorrow back in New York with a show looming over my head.\" \"Do you know what you're going to do about that? I mean you've had to have thought about it since we all know you've been thinking of your life with Jake since coming home?\" \"No, but I do know it's not something that needs to be decided upon tonight, or tomorrow or at all this week, in fact.\" Melanie said slapping her hand lightly upon her soaked dress covered leg. \"You also might want to think about getting into some warmer clothes soon. You're going to catch a cold in that thing.\" \"Yea. I know. It's not my favorite dress in the world.\" \"You're two for two with that now I guess.\" Lurlynn joked. Melanie snorted with the memory of her first wedding dress that remained un-salvageable from Jake's evidence of his activities the night before their wedding. \"This one is also quite heavy.\" Melanie joked while moving the wet material as much as she could on her body trying to get comfortable. Luckily Jake took his spot at her side in that moment. \"Well, we'd better be getting home. I'm so happy for you two.\" Lurlynn smiled at them both before heading off into the crowd to find Clinton. Melanie shifted enough in the chair to where she was able to look up at Jake without twisting her neck. \"What were you ladies talking about?\" Melanie shrugged, not just yet wanting to discuss the more weighted topics that had surfaced while talking to Lurlynn, at least, not just yet. \"My dress mostly.\" and on cue she shivered from a sudden draft that permeated through the room. \"I'd give you my jacket but I think it's holding more water than your dress at the moment.\" Jake grinned his charming boy smile. Melanie took in the state of his clothes and noticed that his clothes indeed seemed to still be dripping healthy amounts of water. \"Maybe it's time we... leave?\" Melanie asked catching herself for some reason not wanting to say \"home\" just yet. For now, she'd call Jake her home and not step on any toes while throwing herself back into every aspect of his life. Jake swallowed thickly not missing what she didn't say. Melanie stood and Jake only moved back far enough to allow her room to get to her feet. The result left them with no space between them. Jake smiled his boyish smile again and leaned in to give Melanie a kiss, quick, but satisfying their tongues only brushing for a beat. Before Melanie could regain her composure Jake stood by his mother saying goodbye. They spoke for a few minutes, Jake nodding vigorously at something his mother was saying to him and then walked back over to Melanie holding out his hand in invitation. As they made their way towards the door the music suddenly lowered and the voices cut away wondering where the music had gone. Everybody looked about wildly and soon landed on Stella who stood in the middle of the floor. \"Everybody give one last round of applause to Mr. and Mrs . Jake Perry as they take their leave!\" The crowd in the bar went wild. Screams, hollers, cat calls, and congratulations were belted at the newly reformed couple as they waved heartily at everybody while making their escape out the door and into Jake's truck. Both slumped against the back of the seat sighing in happiness and relief. Melanie shivered again and Jake made quick work of starting the engine and cranking the heat. He carefully backed away from the small building and before driving home with his wife he reached over and grabbed her hand in his, lacing their cold fingers together.[Chapter 2] Chapter 2: The First Tribulation They walked to the door hand in hand, the storm still battling strong around them. Jake made quick work of getting the door open allowing Melanie to step through first. She moved over to the nearest couch and waited for Jake to make her feel welcome. The last time she had been here and not been the most pleasant experience. She had redone most of the interior trying to annoy him enough so he would sign divorce papers so she could go home to Andrew. Jake flicked on a few lamps and rested a few feet away from Melanie. She took in the room and noticed he hadn't changed anything back or made any effort to undo anything she had done to spite him. \"You kept the furniture?\" Melanie asked suddenly tense and unsure of how to act. \"Yea, well like I said. It makes the place look a little nicer. More of a lived-in feel.\" Jake responded. He knew how unpredictable Melanie could be and he stood wondering if she was going to flee faster than Old Fuzz the cat. He closed the distance between them and left no time before he held her close to him, his palms flat on her back and his face buried in her neck. Melanie wrapped her arms around his waist and pressed her cheek against his chest breathing his in wet scent. They stood there comforting each other, soaking in each other, happy in the fact that they could be like this again after so long. Jake's still dripping jacket began seeping into Melanie's dress and she began to shiver despite the warmth Jake's body offered her. Without a word Jake lead Melanie to his room trying to calm his racing heart. It's been too long since he had his wife in his room... as his. He searched through his dresser for a pair of old sweat pants and a t-shirt he had saved from his high school days. \"Here, this should do until you can get your clothes from your parents.\" Jake smiled. \"Thanks, can you get the buttons for me?\" Melanie turned around trusting Jake to handle the task. Jake laid the clothes on the bed and rested his hands on her shoulders caressing them just for a moment before slowly undoing the buttons. \"You know,\" Jake said as he released the first two button at the top of her dress, \"I hate,\" a few more buttons, the dress now exposing the top of her spine to the middle of her back. \"this dress.\" the next few buttons came undone. Jake hadn't been finished with all the fastenings but as soon as Melanie slipped off the shoulder straps the dirty, white dress slipped off her frame. Her modesty held only by her lingerie. She frowned at Jake while stepping out of the pool of fabric. Melanie continued to frown while carefully picking up the dress, gently trying to shake it all back into place. She proceeded to carefully lay it over the small recliner in the corner of the room. Jake watched her carefully as she pampered her dress. He knew women became attached to their wedding dresses, but why would she still be so attached to that one. She had run from the man with whom she had picked it for. He watched her every movement knowing that the atmosphere in the room had changed since he had uttered his opinion of the dress. \"Well, I'm sorry you feel that way.\" Melanie said almost too calmly. She snatched the clothes Jake had selected for her off of the bed and marched herself into the bathroom. How could he say he didn't like her dress? It is hers and the first thing he does is admits that he hates it. Melanie couldn't think about anything other than her own feelings and Jake's words. Jake sighed heavily and kicked the air when Melanie walked out of the room. He knew they would a have plenty of arguments and disagreements while they merged their lives back together, but he didn't think tonight would start the marathon. He didn't understand her reaction. She had to have guessed that he wouldn't like the dress and he is tired of holding in his feelings when it came to Melanie. He meant it more as a joke he thought she would understand. Jake proceeded in wrenching the wet clothes off his body. They stuck to his skin making him regret, and not for the first time, about wearing so many layers out in a storm. Jake repeated to himself that Melanie chose him. Him. Jake had finished just pulling on a pair of pajama pants when Melanie walked back into the room, her hurt hiding behind her solidified attitude. She waited in the doorway and leaned against it, a pout still on her lips but daggers in her eyes. Jake paused with his shirt still in hand and watched Melanie. Her eyes roamed over his form, from his toes to his eyes and then held with a light flush to her cheeks. Jake smiled a crooked smile eyeing her in his clothes as well. That's a sight he never thought he'd see again. \"I know it's late, but I'm hungry.\" Jake couldn't help the smile that had taken up residence ever since Melanie had claimed him on the beach. \"When did you last eat?\" \"I haven't eaten. I was supposed to at the reception... but I never made it the whole way down the aisle and well the bar didn't have much food prepared.\" Melanie shrugged. \"Well, we'll just have to fix that.\" Jake grabbed Melanie's hand ran to the kitchen practically dragging Melanie who laughed along the way. Their short run ended at the kitchen table where Jake backed Melanie up slowly with his body until she was sitting at one of the dining chairs. Jake opened cabinets after cabinets only to slam them shut after a brief inspection of their interiors. With every door he closed he glanced at Melanie and gave an outrageous \"wait\" look that had Melanie laughing, clutching the side of the table for support. \"I promise I'll get you... ah ha!\" Jake turned around with a box of pancake mix in his hand. Melanie clapped her hands. She stood and grabbed good sized bowl from the cabinet nearest the refrigerator. At first they bumped into each other while gathering the ingredients they needed, but soon they moved around smoothly as if they had never took hiatus. Jake stirred the contents of the bowl and a lazy Melanie admired his muscled arms, strong and capable. Without being able to resist any longer she placed her hand on his right arm pulling on it gently. Jake stopped his movements and looked down at Melanie. Melanie smiled slowly and stretched toward him on her tip toes, her hand never leaving his arm, using it for balance as her other hand came to wrap around his neck pulling his lips closer to hers. Her stomach flooded with excitement as the distance between them rapidly became smaller. This wouldn't be the first time they had kissed tonight, or even since Melanie had returned to Alabama, but she couldn't help the giddy feeling that overcame her. Jake smiled a charming half-smile in the time it took for his lips to reach hers. The kiss was soft and satisfying, both made sure to completely cover every inch of the other's lips before breaking apart. No words were needed and Jake returned to his task of mixing the batter. They made quick work of making their meal. Melanie flipped the pancakes and Jake poured more batter onto the griddle. As the newly reformed couple ate, little conversation passed between them. Both had many questions they wanted answered and stories they wanted to share, but tonight didn't seem like the night for talking. They ate quickly, cleaned up just the same, and headed to bed. Melanie let Jake use the bathroom first before going in after him. He is her husband and this is their home, but at times like this she still couldn't help but feel like a guest, a stranger, not sure of exactly where to move and when. When she exited the bathroom Jake already lay in bed waiting for her. When she had moved to New York she made the choice to change everything about herself, even which side of the bed she slept on. So, she stood momentarily confused when Jake took up the right side, the one closest to the bedroom door. Melanie proceed a few hesitant steps toward the bed trying to place why this felt right but looked wrong to her. \"Mel, are you alright?\" Jake asked concerned. Maybe the reality of sleeping with him again had her rethinking today? Jake internally rolled his eyes at that thought. Maybe he was being inconsiderate in some way? She seemed to be waiting for something. \"Is there something you forgot?\" Melanie looked at him a long few minutes before quickly shaking her head and soundly placing herself on the left side of the bed, on her side of the bed. Again, without the need for words they turned on their sides facing each other. Jake still couldn't believe his luck. Not only had Melanie not gotten married today, had not divorced him, but chose to be with him again and it seemed this time she would stay for the rest of their lives. She chose him. After everything they had gone through together, everything she had to do by herself to pick up the pieces, the person she changed into, the life she created, she came back... and was his. Jake smiled not caring for the distance between them, even if it was only six inches. He moved himself closer to her while at the same time gently grasping her hip and pulling her to him. She smiled so freely at his action that he knew this moment forever sealed itself into his heart. He wrapped his arm around her pulling her into him as much as possible, stroking her hair while his lips rested at her temple. She snuggled into him, her right hand folding around the curve of his neck, her thumb stroking his jaw line. Oh, how she missed this. She had never realized how much until this moment. Both exhausted from the events of the day soon started to drift to sleep. Before he fell completely under Jake, breaking the silence, said, \"I'm glad you're home, Mel. I've missed you.\" Melanie in response snuggled further into his chest, her mind deciding to stop torturing her with past conversations and actions replaying over and over and allowed her to sleep in the arms of the only man who has truly known her.[Chapter 3] Chapter 3: Some Hard Truths The sound of the front door closing wasn't what woke Melanie. From the deep confines of the bed, she could hear her phone's constant chiming from another part of the house. She slowly roused herself from the plush comforter and sat up. Melanie felt almost dizzy. Physically, she was fine, but sitting up in an unfamiliar room she found disorienting. Her phone continued screaming at her, but she ignored the calls until she had given herself a chance to wake up and be ready for the day. On her way to the bathroom, Melanie laughed softly at herself. If she been in New York, she would have been awake long before now and wouldn't have dared ignored her phone. As Melanie stepped into the shower, she knew that she was trying to prolong having to pick up her phone. The list of responsibilities waiting for her there was driving up her anxiety, and she knew for every one of those, two more had was created by default from her new situation with Jake. Moving into the living room and taking a quick glance around the rest of the house Melanie found that Jake had completely left the property. There was nothing else for her to do, but see what damage was being caused by her not answering her people when they needed her. More than 20 missed calls, 50 emails, and more texts than she could comprehend before her first cup of coffee waited for her. As Melanie made her way to the coffee maker, she did a quick scan through many of the emails. Many of the messages were the general everyday inquiries, and she could make short work of talking through shipments with investors and the like. However, others were more severe, and many of the texts were implicating the same. Melanie had hoped to spend the week not worrying about anything. This week should have been the time she and Andrew spent on their honeymoon and Melanie knew that Andrew would have understood if work had gotten in the way, but Jake was different. As Melanie sat there sipping her coffee and read through the countless message, taking notes on a napkin, the complications grew and she wouldn't be able to ignore them for a few days, much less the week she wanted to spend quality time with Jake. As Melanie finished reading through the emails more popped in. Tired of that menu she switched to her text messages and began reading through those threads. Apparently, nobody at her studio could handle anything without her, and even some of the simplest decisions had been second-guessed by everyone there. Finding the easiest problems first, Melanie quickly sent her solutions. Less than half of the messages remained, but Melanie switched her focus to her voicemails and abandoned her note-taking on napkins as more issued poured in. She rummaged around the house for a moment before finding a notepad to write on. Melanie, sighed in relief when many of the voicemails were relaying many of the same messages she had received in either email or text form. For that reason, none of the voicemails remained, but there were still many other things to attend to, and it was still before 10 AM. Her task list couldn't all be handled by her phone alone. She needed food and her laptop, neither of which she had in the house. She made a mental checklist to add groceries on her list of things to do for that day but didn't know if she would have the time at all to grab food for the place or find out where Jake went. Rinsing out her coffee cup and setting in the sink, Melanie grabbed all of her notes, retrieved her still damp wedding dress from the bedroom, changed into a clean shirt of Jake's and stepped outside her phone pressed to her ear. Lurlynn answered just as Melanie spotted her car sitting just beyond the porch steps. \"Melanie, what's wrong?\" \"Oh, um. I called to ask for a ride, but I see that my car is here.\" \"Yea, we drove it down for you right after you and Jake left. I hope that's alright?\" \"No, of course, thank you.\" \"How are you and Jake doin?\" \"I haven't seen him this morning. I think he must have left the house pretty early.\" \"But ya'll are alright?\" Lurlynn drawled as some of her kids squealed in the background. \"Stop runnin! Go outside. Go.\" Melanie stopped herself from laughing and answered Lurlynn. \"We're fine. Last night was surreal.\" \"I bet. But listen. I have to go. These kids are wild. Catch me up later?\" \"Of course. Thanks again Lurlynn. And if you see Jake tell him I was looking for him.\" \"Will do.\" Melanie pocketed her phone and made her way over to her car. The sleek, chrome body of the car looked out of place here at Jake's, but she couldn't worry about the aesthetics of her car right now. Away from the house, her phone rang again. This time she answered. \"Mel, you have to get back here quick. Three investors want to pull out, the fall show has been moved up, an entire order has been butchered and the fabrics for the month have still not arrived. It's a mess.\" \"Tabs, slow down. You're back in New York already?\" \"Of course. After your reception, I hopped a plane back. There was no reason for me to stay in Pigeon Creek and good thing I did. Mel, I understand you want your honeymoon, but it's a mess here.\" \"I know. I've been catching up all morning. I still haven't had a chance to go through everything. I'll be back as soon as I can there's just so much to wrap up here first.\" Melanie passed the diner and wanted to stop in and see if Jake was there or if anybody had seen him, but after talking to Tabitha, she didn't feel like she could afford the luxury. She would always have time to catch up with Jake later. Melanie passed through town not stopping anywhere, waving back to those who waved to her first and continued to her parent's house. Another five minutes she pulled up in front of her parent's trailer and stepped out. By the looks of things, her mother was home, but her dad was not. She needed to grab her laptop and some food and get to work, but Melanie knew that once she stepped inside she was probably going to be held hostage for a few more hours than she was comfortable wasting. When she moved inside Melanie found her mom standing in the kitchen huffing over a puff of dough. Her father was not sitting in his usual spot in the recliner, and initially, she couldn't hear any indication that Earl was in another part of the house. \"Hey, Momma.\" Melanie called in greeting moving into the kitchen where her mom could see her. \"Mel-ney,\" Her mom exclaimed in her habit of never pronouncing Melanie's name fully. \"What are you doing here? Is everything alright?\" \"Of course, why wouldn't it be?\" \"This is your first day back with Jake. I'd figured we wouldn't see you for a couple of days.\" Her mother shrugged and continued making what Melanie could now see was a pie. \"This isn't our honeymoon, Momma.\" \"I know. I just thought, is all. So, why'd you stop by?\" \"I came for my laptop and Jake doesn't have any food at his place.\" \"Well,\" Pearl began, drying her hands on the kitchen towel hanging half in the sink. \"I packed up all your thangs, knowing you'd want to get it over to your place. Your computer is on your bed where you left it.\" Melanie moved to go to her bedroom, but her mother stopped her before she made it to the mouth of the hallway. \"Wait, sit down and I'll heat you up some leftover meatloaf I made last night.\" Melanie wanted to tell her mom that she didn't have time to sit and eat a whole meal. But she sat down at the table without trying to explain. A part of her wanted to tell her mom about the many complications she was facing, but the other part of her didn't want to get into it with her mother just now. Within minutes her mother had a plate of food sitting before her, and without further talk, Melanie dug into her meal. After just the pancakes last night after not eating at all yesterday, she was starving. As she ate, her mother chatted to her about the pie she was making, meetings her dad was attending for his many reenactments, what everybody did at the reception after Melanie and Jake had left for the night. \"How is Jake by the way. You two getting along alright?\" \"We're doing fine.\" They hadn't even begun to touch any of the topics that needed to be addressed to merge their lives back together, but Melanie wouldn't dare say that out loud to her mother. \"I haven't had a chance to see Jake this morning.\" \"Oh, you'll probably find him out at the beach. You know, day after a storm. You should go out there and see if he needs any help.\" \"I can't today. I've been busy all morning with work. The reason I needed my laptop.\" Melanie stood up and put her empty plate in the sink as her mother popped her pie into the oven. \"Don't worry about cleaning that honey. I can get it when I clean all these.\" She indicated to the bakeware she had used to make the pie. \"Thanks, Momma. And for gathering all my things. I'm sure Jake and I will be by later to grab it all.\" Before her mother could say anything more, Melanie's phone began ringing. \"Tabs, what is it?\" \"Mel, more investors are trying to pull out.\" Tabitha paused, Melanie knew she was struggling to relay the next bit of information. \"Not just investors, but clients, and companies as well.\" \"What. Did they say why?\" \"Many hopped aboard because of your affiliation with Andrew. They aren't sure they want to stay on with you alone.\" \"Alright, Okay.\" Melanie paused, taking the phone away from her ear, allowing her head to fall into her hands for a moment, taking a deep breath before returning to her conversation. Her mother kept glancing at her knowing she was in distress. \"Tabs, set up a meeting with everybody who's trying to pull out. Back to back meetings if we must. We'll get this fixed no matter how long it takes to fix. I'll be there in a few days. I'll text you the details. In the meantime keep me updated.\" Melanie hung up the phone and saw that in the time it took her to drive out there and eat more and more messages had arrived for her on top of the ones she hadn't been able to get to earlier. \"You're leavin?\" Her mom asked in a tone that told Melanie she had plenty to say on that subject. \"Momma.\" Melanie drawled already tired from the conversation she knew her mother wanted to have. \"Not now.\" \"Mel-ney, you can't leave.\" \"I have a job to do, Momma.\" Melanie rushed back to her room to retrieve her laptop. She needed to get back out to Jake's and handle the situation without further delay. Stuffing her laptop and all the necessary accessories into her laptop bag, Melanie rushed back out to the living room. Her mother was waiting in the living room with her hand on her hips. \"Does Jake know you're leavin?\" \"No. I told you I haven't seen him yet today.\" \"So, you're just going to leave again? I thought you had finally made a decision.\" Melanie was set to walk out the front door. \"I did, but that doesn't mean that I still don't have a company to run.\" \"Melanie, I just really think this time is sensitive,\" \"I know, Momma. I do. But all of this isn't going to get figured out in one night. I have to go. I'll call you before I leave.\" Melanie rushed back to her car and back to Jake's as her phone continued to ring over and over. The suppliers that were threatening to walk away were easy to deal with once Melanie had the invoices in front of her. The investors were another matter altogether and like she told Tabitha, meetings had to be set up and she would need to get down there tomorrow night at the latest. \"You have the calendar updates, yes?\" Melanie asked Tabitha as she paced around the living room. \"Yes, our calendars have been updated as well as the books. Everything is going to work out fine, Mel. Once they see you are still once hundred percent on top of everything, they won't have any other reason to back out.\" Melanie chewed on her nail. The day was nearing late evening, and she still hadn't seen or spoken to Jake once. She didn't have any more time to wait for him. She had to purchase flight tickets tonight if she was going to make an afternoon flight tomorrow. By the way the meetings were set up, Melanie would be gone a few weeks sorting everything out and then making sure everything would run smoothly without her present for a while. Melanie sat down on the couch in front of her computer. There were already several tabs open showing the different pricing for airline tickets. Melanie punched a number into her phone and waited for an answer. \"Hi, yes, um I'm needing to fly out tomorrow afternoon, but I have a return ticket that's past date, and I was wondering if I could apply that to the new one?\" Melanie was listening to the person walking her through what it would take to switch her ticket over and she never heard the door open behind her. \"For that price I could just buy a new ticket. Is there nothing you can do?\" Melanie listened for another moment as the person who entered slowly moved up behind her. \"Alright, well, then I'll go ahead and set up a flight for 2 PM tomorrow. Yes, just one way.\" Melanie continued to give the rest of her information and then threw her phone onto the coffee table with a heavy sigh. \"Mel?\" Melanie shot off the couch and spun around to find Jake standing on the other side. She stood breathing hard and staring at him not knowing what to say. \"Jake, hi.\" Melanie said bluntly, still terribly out of breath. Jake looked from her to her computer screen and then back to her. With a shell-shocked look he muttered, \"I brought dinner,\" He raised his fist that gripped around a large brown paper bag. \"Just some burgers from the diner. Have you eaten?\" \"Yea I ate at Mommas... which was earlier this morning. Actually, I'm starved. Thank you.\" Melanie moved around the couch to stand in front of Jake offering to take the bag off his hands. His eyes were still on her computer screen. Slowly, never acknowledging she was willing to take the bag, he looked at her and breathed, \"You're leavin?\"[Chapter 4] Melanie didn't know what to say at first. Jake was sporting such a look of hurt. \"I can take the bag.\" Jake handed her the bag as Melanie pulled it from his grasp. She walked the food into the kitchen and sat the bag down on the table, with Jake following right behind her. Still trying to control her nerves, Melanie set out napkins and then placed the food in front of each of them. When she was done fiddling around, she looked up at Jake and saw that he was still staring her down waiting for her answer. \"Jake, I have to.\" Jake hung his head while nodding vigorously. I lifted his head to look up at Melanie, his expression unreadable. There were many things Jake wanted to say and that much more he wanted to yell, but he held back from doing either and instead asked, \"For how long?\" \"I.. I'm not sure. Maybe two or three weeks at the most.\" \"Weeks!\" Jake cried sitting in the dining chair in front of him but ignoring the food completely. Melanie could feel his confusion and she wasn't sure how to console him. She wouldn't leave her passion no matter what she felt for him. Right now, she didn't know how to give one hundred percent to both at the same time. \"Yes, just a few weeks. Enough time to get everything settled and running smoothly again. Once the chaos has settled, I'll be able to do the rest from here.\" \"Chaos?\" \"Investors are trying to pull out, suppliers are getting scared, and shipments are becoming disorganized. The models haven't rebelled yet, but if I don't' get down there soon who knows what will happen.\" \"Melanie,\" Jake breathed leaning back in his chair staring up at the ceiling. He drummed his fingers on the table top letting out a slow breath. Melanie sat down across from him waiting to hear what he thought about the whole situation. The fact that he hadn't completely closed up and run out for most of the night said a lot about how much he had matured since Melanie had left for New York the first time. \"I know it seemed like we would finally get a chance to gain some momentum. I hadn't planned on going back so soon, but this can't wait. The company is on the verge of absolute disaster.\" \"So you were alway going to leave again?\" \"Well, yea. I couldn't have just abandoned everything in New York without at least wrapping up a few things.\" Jake didn't say anything to that nor did he look at her. \"You can't leave again, Mel.\" \"Jake I have to. This isn't going to be like last time, I promise. I'll take care of everything, take care of my apartment and my belongings and then I'll be back. I promise I'm coming back to you.\" \"I can't stop you from going, that's obvious, but I don't' have a good feeling about this at all. We've only had a day. And not even really that seeing as I was out on the sand all day.\" \"I was wondering where you had disappeared to, but I am going. I'll call you every day I'm there. Fill you in on what's happing every step of the way, and as soon as I know when I'm coming home, you'll be the first one to know.\" \"The very minute you know. You call me.\" \"Of course.\" The silence between them then was still awkward, but Jake was agreeing to what she was saying for now and Melanie didn't want to push anything too far too fast. The food was slightly too cold to be good, but Melanie ate it anyway because she was starving and she needed something to do with her hands at that moment. She knew Jake was still mulling things over in his head and she wanted to give him the time he needed to process what she had said and everything she promised. Melanie munched slowly and watched Jake carefully. \"What happens when a few weeks turns into months?\" Melanie's chewing speed slowed, swallowing hard she shook her head. Melanie wiped her hands on a napkin and stood up. She held out a hand to Jake. He hesitated a moment, but took her hand into his and easily followed where she lead. Melanie walked them over and sat Jake down on the sofa in front of her computer. Melanie pulled up her calendar and showed Jake what the next few weeks would look like for her. \"No, Jake. I know how these things work and I know how to work under a deadline. I promise it will only take two or three weeks. Tabitha and I have already set up all the meetings.\" Melanie indicated to the screen that was blocked in fully for the next few weeks. \"They should all be done within the first week, but if for any reason they spill over we've given ourself cushion room for the next week and a half for meetings. After that, it's only the matter of Skype and phone calls to sort out suppliers and shipments that have gone haywire. If everything goes as it should, we're looking at two weeks. Three if we need the cushion room for any reason and also that last week, whether it's at the end of the second or third week, I will take to take care of all my personal items.\" \"Mel,\" Jake sighed sitting back into the cushions. He rubbed a hand over his face not looking at her, but not at the computer screen anymore either. When he continued this time, he focused his gaze on Melanie. \"If you leave now, I won't now how to believe that any of this is real. You can't leave. Not again.\" Melanie scooted closer to him on the sofa and gently took his hand in hers, pulling their conjoined hands onto her lap. And leaning on his left shoulder, laying her head against him. Jake shifted his weight so he was in a more slouched position and she was leaning against him more comfortably. Melanie sighed and tried to dig into him deeper. \"I know that everything happened so quickly and we haven't had a chance to talk about everything; dig into the details.\" Melanie pulled herself away from her comfortable position against Jake enough to fully look at him. With their hands still combined she continued, \"But I promise. It will never be like last time. I'm going to go and take care of everything that's broken, I'm going to get my stuff packed and ready to sell or ship, I'm going to call you every day, and then I'm going to come home, here, to you.\" Melanie, though they hadn't yet established where they were with their boundaries decided to throw herself across his lap, straddling his hips, placing both of her hands on his shoulders and staring at him hard. Jake was surprised, but quickly adjusted his weight again and laid his hands on Melanie's hips, a fluffy smile settling upon his lips. \"I found what I needed in New York to make me happy, truly happy. And it may have taken me longer to figure out that, you are the one person I needed to share my happiness with to make it all feel worth it. Jake, I am coming back. Last time I left without much of any warning or trying to talk through what I was feeling or thinking. But this is not that.\" Jake continued their gaze for a long moment after Melanie was done speaking. And instead of answering with words Jake used another method. Jake squeezed Melanie's hips with a light pressure, enough to make her scoot closer to his chest. Then he ran his palms over her hips, up her side, over the back of her shoulders, and then pulled her to him fully. Without words or any \"come here\" gestures, Jake had Melanie against his lips. Melanie was right there with him never hesitating for a second. The one thing they had always promised one another was the right to kiss anytime they wanted and Melanie was not going to protest in the slightest. Melanie leaned into Jake, into the kiss, practically laying him into the back cushion as far as possible, pinning his body to hers. If they had not before been positive in their situation, this moment between them solidified their belief that much more. Melanie clung to Jake. For the first time since before leaving Alabama, for the reasons she did, Melanie felt completely stress-free as she sat there loving Jake and having him love her in return. Jake's chest swelled with happiness the harder Melanie pushed herself into his kiss. Ever since their moment in the graveyard, Jake craved Melanie more than he knew was possible. To still have her be so near and snot be able to have her was more torture than Jake ever wanted to endure ever again. Their passion began to slow and their kissing, although loving, began to calm. Melanie's forearms were holding her weight on Jake's shoulders, and as their makeout session came to an end, she rested her forehead against his. \"I don't know where that came from.\" Melanie breathed unevenly. \"I'm not complaining.\" Jake chuckled, grinning even wider as Melanie's cheeks begin to widen. \"Besides, I believe you were just sitting on my lap. The rest was my fault.\" \"After everything we've been through, I can't believe you can still make me blush.\" Melanie placed one of her cool palms to her cheek trying to reduce the heat that had risen there. They lapsed into silence both periodically staring at the other and then looking into another part of the room. Melanie smiled sadly. There was so much she wanted to ask Jake, so much she wanted to tell him, and so much she wanted to know. But on the eve of her leaving for New York for the second time was not the time to bring up any of that. Melanie could feel herself wanting Jake on a deeper level of connection. Even that was off limits at that moment. If Melanie was completely honest with herself, a part of her feared that once she set foot back in New York, she wouldn't want to leave it after that. She had told Jake once that both places fit her and she didn't know how to take that back now or if she could ever bring herself to try. Slowly, she pulled herself from around his lap and took up the open cushion once again. \"You didn't eat much.\" Melanie said suddenly to fill the silence that had come from nowhere. \"Do you want me to heat up your food for you?\" Melanie stood up ready to take on the task if Jake wanted her to. \"No, Mel.\" Jake stood up and stood in front of her. Everything about him screaming serious. \"Did you mean it?\" Melanie didn't say anything right away, fidgeting awkwardly with the hem of her shirt. She meant it and she knew that solidly without preamble, but all the other details floating in space, waiting for a place to land in this new life of theirs had her not sure how she could be allowed to keep any of it. In her silence Jake turned around putting both of his hands on his head, letting out a deep breath. \"What is this, Mel?\" Jake blurted turning around sharply to confront Melanie once again. \"Jake, of course I meant it. I meant it when I chose you over Andrew, when I sought you out on the beach and convinced you to to be mine, when I came home with you.\" Melanie walked closer to him, closing the little bit of distance that was between them, but still allowing enough room that the situation demanded. \"But, Jake in my promise to you, I never agreed to give up my job and everything I've worked so hard for.\" \"I never asked that of you. I would never ask that of you, Mel. We've only been back together a day. It's just hard knowing you're going to go back to the place that kept you away for over seven years. I have a right to be a little intimidated by that.\" Melanie sat back down on the couch, slouching over her knees. From the sofa Mel cleared her throat and tried to start this conversation over again. \"I know how long it's been since I ran back to you. And I understand that there is still so much that we need to work through. Things that can only be accomplished if I'm here, but you're just going to have to trust me from the beginning. Trust that you are who I want and that I've committed to us completely. And know, that this won't have to be my only trip back to New York.\" \"Wait, what?\" \"Mostly, I can run things from here, but if a situation or situations like this every pop up again trying to handle the situation from here isn't going to work. Investors, suppliers, clients, all of them will eventually need some one on one meetings.\" Jake nodded. Some of what she described he understood as his new business had only begun to flourish. His commute was only a short plane ride away and he still found himself spending more time there than anywhere else. It was then that Jake realized he had planned to sell their house. He had wanted to move up to Tuskaluska to be closer to his shop and now he didn't know if that was something he still wanted or something Mel would be willing to do. Now, more than ever, he better understood some of the pressures Mel was under. Everything would only get harder when she came back and their businesses began to take up all of their free time. Mel, sitting there on the couch, looking around the room at everything but him, so confused caused Jake to curse himself. Jake stood over her upset and confused himself, but hating the fact that he made her feel like he was asking her to choose. \"I'll be here if you need me. To help in any way I can.\" Slowly, Mel looked up at him. A smile breaking across her face. \"I can't lose you gain, Melanie. Not again.\" \"You won't,\" There was a hesitation to the end of her sentence, but Melanie quickly covered it up with a smile. She didn't know why she didn't want to call this her home or tell Jake that she loves him because both were true. All she knew is that she wanted Jake and she wanted her job in New York and she felt that if she pulled too hard at either end of the string one end would break.[Chapter 5] \"Mr. Carlson, as I've said, you have nothing to fear. You're investment has not been lost. I can assure you that the company is not going anywhere.\" \"As you are aware Ms. Carmichael,\" Melanie did not interrupt him to correct him on her last name status. \"We not only invested in your company, but in you. Without you there is no company, at least, not one that we will continue to do business with.\" Everything within Melanie stilled. She knew her investors were a hard, loyal bunch, but she never would have guessed that for many of them, such as Mr. Carlson, they were loyal to her and not just to the name brand. After getting to New York everything from her models to her investors and her personal staff were in a state of disarray that she was unprepared for. When walking through it with Tabitha before leaving Alabama everything had seemed so simple. All she needed to do was meet and assure everybody that she nor the company was going anywhere. Since attending the meeting questions she had never thought of began popping up. Mr. Carlson brought up one that almost everyone had not failed to mention. \"We have to think about the future, Ms. Carmichael. Do you plan on staying based in New York, living here with your company? Moving the base of operations out of Alabama? What happens when you decide you no longer wish to own your company and sell it to someone who has the time to run it? You can't guarantee anything at this point.\" \"Just as I cannot guarantee the future, Mr. Carlson, you cannot dismiss the present. I have no intention of selling my company. My newly cemented ties to my home town has caused many issues, but trust me when I say my team and I are working on them tirelessly. The company stands and I stand with my company. You have nothing to fear.\" \"As well as that sounds we have to protect ourselves. We know your line doesn't usually enter into the semi-fall shows. I think our situation calls for more don't you think? We are prepared to see what you can run for the semi-fall show. If that goes smoothly we will invest for another year in your company. But if you fail the show then that will tell us everything we need to know for how your company will survive the upcoming year.\" \"Mr. Carlson, the semi-fall show is in two months. You couldn't possibly expect us to be prepared for that.\" \"You want to keep me Ms. Carmichael, this is what I require.\" Mr. Carlson and his team stood up, he nodded politely to Melanie, then quit the room in a sweep. Melanie continued to sit there her brain unwilling to comprehend what just happened. Nothing was going according to plan.. Melanie looked down at her phone. That meeting had run longer than she would have liked. She had missed her usual time to call Jake and check in...again. Before she could dial his number her phone rang, but it wasn't Jake. \"Tabs,\" Melanie began, but Tabitha cut her off before she could relay the information from the meeting to the tall brunette.

This is that story. Rating: T Disclaimer: I don't own any of the poor little Cast Away characters. Wilson bobbed in the blue waves, feeling sicker by the minute. He saw the raft, with Chuck on it, drifting farther and farther away. Or was he the one drifting farther away? \"Chuck!\" Wilson screamed. \"Chuck!\" Chuck didn't stir. Damn him for being such a heavy sleeper! \"Chuck! Please! Oh god, Chuck!\" Finally, Chuck stirred. He slowly sat up, looking around. \"Behind you, Chuck!\" Wilson called, panicking diminishing slightly. \"Come on!\" \"Wilson?\" Chuck was instantly awake, head twisting as he searched for his friend. \"I'm here!\" At last, Chuck turned and spotted him. \"Wilson!\" He plunged into the ocean, and never was Wilson more glad that his friend had limbs. Chuck continued calling his name and giving him reassurances. He went back a bit, but Wilson relaxed again when he realized he'd grabbed the raft. \"Come on, Chuck!\" Wilson cheered. \"Come on!\" Chuck was obviously losing strength. His head went under several times, but he kept coming, and Wilson kept cheering him on. \"Wilson!\" Chuck wailed, voice full of despair. \"I'm sorry!\" Wilson's heart sank into his stomach. \"Chuck?\" \"I'm sorry, Wilson!\" He turned and swam back to the raft. By then there were several meters between them, impossible to traverse. \"Chuck!\" Wilson sobbed. In the distance he could hear Chuck screaming apologies, voice so wracked with pain that it almost made Wilson forget his own. \"Chuck!\" he cried. \"Chuck!\" They called for each other until they could hear the other no longer. Wilson was lost at sea. Wilson didn't know how long he floated in that vast blue nothingness. Time seemed to bleed together. After a while he tried to time the bobbing of the waves, but it was impossible. He followed the sun in its course across the sky. He slept fitfully. He woke when he felt something move beneath him. \"Oh god,\" he uttered, voice breaking. Was now his moment of death? Whatever was under him moved closer, the displaced water shifting him across the surface. He began to sob in earnest, fearful of his fate. He wanted nothing more than to just be back on the island with Chuck. They'd had it good there. Why did Chuck have to leave?! Wilson dared a glance down. He shrieked at the sight of a large eye blinking at him. The humongous creature turned and dived downward, its massive tail breaking the surface and creating white froth. It appeared a ways away, its hulking mass cresting the water. There was a sound like a tree crashing to the ground, and a sprout of water arched into the sky before raining down. Wilson stared in awe. The creature approached again. This time Wilson was much less afraid. He was sure if it wanted to hurt him it would have. It nudged him gently, but it sent him spinning around anyway, making him dizzy. When he finally slowed, he could get a good look at the creature's eye. The eye held an old wisdom, and shone with kindness and amusement. Wilson wasn't sure whether it was trying to entertain him or itself. But as long as it didn't eat him... The whale stayed with him for the longest time, occasionally nudging him as though it were a game. It might have been quite annoying had Wilson not been so scared of being alone. Since Chuck had abandoned him, Wilson couldn't bear the silence. Not that the whale spoke, but Wilson decided to give it a voice in his head. Did that make him crazy? No, Chuck was crazy. Wilson was perfectly sane, thank you very much. It wasn't until the whale nudged him and spun him did he see it. \"The island!\" he cried. \"How did you know?\" \"Well, it's the only land around for miles.\" \"Oh, thank you, thank you!\" Wilson said. He wished he had arms so that he could the whale a great big hug. He'd never been more ecstatic. Chuck was gone, and they'd never see one another again, but at least he was alive. He could live out the rest of his days in peace. \"I must leave now.\" Wilson saw the whale moving back the way they'd come. \"Wait!\" \"I must move to deeper water. Good-bye, friend.\" \"Good-bye!\" Wilson said, feeling an ache deep inside him. \"Good-bye!\" He hoped he would see the whale again. As the current carried him closer and closer to the island, Wilson found himself thinking of ways to keep himself occupied. He didn't have arms or legs, so he couldn't do the things Chuck did, but he was sure he would survive. He drifted a bit, the current turning him so that he faced away from his destination. He didn't see the looming rocks behind him. There was a loud pop! as he made contact. His breath hitched and then whistled out in surprise as his lifeair poured out of him. Wilson sank into the sea. Later, his deflated body washed up on the sand. END. A/N: Well, uh, thanks for reading. It was a bit morbid, but it was sort of crack, eh?

It's roughly noon on the island. \"Damn, I've overslept again. Wilson! Why didn't you wake me?!\" He chalks in a tally mark on the wall of the cave. There are too many marks to count. Chuck stretches his arms and legs, and prepares breakfast: a cooked bird's egg from atop the tree adjacent to his cave. As he eats his breakfast, Chuck ponders his life, everything he's done, everywhere he's been. His mind drifts away as he recalls cheerful memories of him and his wife. This goes on for a few minutes, until Chuck snaps back to reality, where he knows there are no cheerful moments, only him and Wilson alone on this God forsaken island. \"Wilson, there's no point. Why do I torture myself? Help will never come….\" Right at that moment, Chuck hears the buzzing sound of a biplane flying overhead! Astonished and completely unprepared, he grabs his now dead flashlight and races to the beach. Using the flashlight's glass as a reflector, he flashes light upon the craft several times, for he can spot the glare off the red wings. \"Come on, come on. You know you saw me, just turn around!!!!!!\" He yells. The biplane suddenly changes directions, veering sharply back the way it came! \"He saw me! Help is coming! Yes!\" Through the cloudless skies, Chuck watches as the plane heads back west, disappearing into the horizon. Angry, Chuck picks up an unopened FedEx box and throws it against a tree. He then storms off and grabs a fishing pole so that he can calm down by catching some dinner. \"I hope that plane comes back before I have to eat another fish.\" He mumbles. Unbeknown to Chuck, the biplane was actually out of fuel and had to turn around. However, because of his frustration, his unopened box started making static noise. It was a radio! As Chuck fishes away, the plane radios in to say that it is out of fuel and returning home, but that the pilot thought he saw a glare from the ground on an abandoned island. Night falls. The radio's static continues to stream through the air. Chuck, now heading back towards the camp, stops to hear a noise. \"Wilson! What is that noise? Do you hear that?! It almost sounds like……it's a radio! Come on!\" He grabs the radio, ripping the box open in the process. The radio falls to the ground, luckily not breaking! \"It's a miracle!\" As Chuck changes the channels, he picks up a transmission from a U.S. Naval Cruiser. \"This is the U.S.S. Cleopatra, come in.\" \"Hello?! This is Chuck, I'm marooned on an island and have little supplies. Please help me!\" \"Chuck, this is Captain Lawrence of the U.S.S. Cleopatra, hold on while we dial in your location.\" \"Thank you!\" As the Cleopatra's satellites pinpoint Chuck's location, he drops to his knees. \"Finally. I've been on this island too long Wilson. It's going to be good to go home. I want to, no, I need to see my wife, my family. Wilson. This is the end of our struggles. We are once again citizens of the civilized world. This is all I could've asked for.\" \"Chuck, this is Captain Lawrence. We have a SEAL team in the area, they'll be coming by shortly to pick you up. Do you copy?\" \"Yes, yes sir! How long will it be?\" \"ETA is 3 minutes. They are on the island and actively looking for you. We're bringing you home.\" \"They're here! I see them! Thank you!\" Chuck is rushed back to the U.S.S. Cleopatra, where he is given a bed and new clothes. Although it is the butt of every joke on the ship, Captain Lawrence agreed to allow Wilson aboard also. Days pass. \"Chuck, we're making port in San Diego. Time for you to get off this ship and back to your family,\" says one of the Seamen. \"Thank you so much. I'll be ready.\" Chuck gets out of bed, puts on his clothes, and heads towards the door, anxiously awaiting his departure. The doors open and the bridges connect to the dock. Chuck is the first one off the ship, for he sees his wife waiting for him. She is in tears. He rushes towards her, throwing his arms around her and picking her up off her feet. He's missed her dearly. They head off to the taxi, where she tells him how long she's awaited his return and how much she cares for him. It is truly a happy ending. ….However, the story doesn't end. You see, Chuck was in such a hurry to get off the ship, he left Wilson behind. Wilson, still sitting on Chuck's bed on the Cleopatra, is found by one of the privates cleaning out the rooms. There, he decides to take Wilson to Captain Lawrence. After all, the good captain did help rescue Chuck. Captain Lawrence then and there has the following words to say: \"A survivor, a loner, a shipwrecked man shall always carry a companion in his heart. They do not teach this in the schools, they do not encourage it after childhood, but every man that has ever felt alone has had a friend to carry him through the hard times. Men, let this be a lesson to you all. The situation may change, the circumstances be altered, or the peril be greater, all men have their companions deep inside them. Every man has a friend. It's what keeps us sane, what keeps us going.\" The captain stares towards the bow of the ship. \"Private, take Wilson to the bow of the ship, bound him to the railing, and let it be known that Wilson is a companion, a fellow sailor upon this vessel, and a friend to which all men can relate.\" ","Summary":" This is an alternate storyline from the point right before Chuck decides to build a raft: Chuck awa"},{"Movie":"Cast Away","Title":"Reel it in","Author":"hindsight567","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11584053","Passage":"[Chapter 1] Nathaniel Hinds English 101 Professor Baer October 30th 2015 Reel It In There was a blaring in my ears drowning out everything. I opened my eyes and saw darkness. All there I knew was the constant sound pounding in my ears. Finally the sound faded and light blinded me as I opened my eyes to see Wilson floating further and further away. I called out, but my voice couldn't make a sound. Another blare of sound came out of nowhere as I turned around there was a boat speeding toward me…. Thunck … . I woke up laying on the floor once again with the sound of the train going by in the distance sounding it's horn as always. Amidst the mass of covers I untangled my legs and arms as I rose to look outside. I looked out the window at a still unmoving city. Judging by the sun it was only around 4am. I looked around at the barren room with just a bed and a dresser with a volleyball and my pocket watch on it and a small closet in the corner. It has been a few weeks since Wilson and I came back home to my apartment, and I still hadn't replaced any of the extra furniture or decorations. I didn't really feel the need to either, they felt like such a luxury that I didn't deserve after living on so little. I put on some clothes and slipped on my shoes, then slipped them off not like the way they confined my feet. \"I'm leaving Wilson I'll be back in a bit!\" I called as I walked out the door. Wilson stayed motionless on the dresser giving me a look of contempt as if I woke him up as I walked out the door. When I got outside the air was a little brisk but it was nice. The started walking with no destination really in mind. It was good to keep walking, to keep moving forward. As I walked my thoughts drifted here and there, and I keep walking. Hoooooooooonnnnnnnnkkkkk \"Hey buddy get out of the road!\" yelled a person in the car. \"S-Sorry,\" I said stumbling over my words as I tried to snap back into reality. I looked around to see where I was. And I wasn't sure where I was until I set my eyes on that house. A house that I'd see only once in the pouring rain, but that time was enough for it to stick in my memory. Across the street was Kelly's house. I looked up at the sun at by now it was probably around six. She would be waking up soon to get ready for work. I sat down on the curb as I looked over at the house. \"I really did love her,\" I said \"I've heard a lot about her from you Chuck, I wish I could have met he her,\" Wilson replied. \"Huh,\" I said turning around. Then I realized it was only Wilson, \"You scared me there Wilson. If you wanted to come with me this morning all you had to do was ask.\" \"I didn't want to come, but then I changed my mind,\" he stated sarcastically There was an awkward silence as I stared at the house across the street, not knowing what to think let alone what to say. \"Speaking of which,\" started Wilson, \"don't you have a plans tonight to meet Jessica tonight?\" \"What was that Wilson?\" I said not really paying attention, but just sitting there in the moment, content to just look at the house. \"You know, Jessica, the women who you gave that package to a few weeks ago….\" \"Yeah yeah I remember,\" I said absently mindedly. I jumped up. That's right I was going to have dinner tonight with Jessica after work today. I totally forgot. In addition to that I also forgot that I had work today, and I wasn't anywhere near my apartment. I started to jog back home soon settling into a steady rhythm as my bare feet slapped against the pavement. It wasn't long before my apartment building was in sight. As I slowed down, I noticed someone standing at the intercom where you can get buzzed into the building. The man turned as he heard me walk up behind him. It was Tom. \"Where have you been Chuck? I have been standing here buzzing your floor for twenty minutes, we are going to be late!\" Tom did this every morning we had work. Honestly it was annoying, but I know he does it because he cares about me. \"How about you go grab some coffee, come back, and then I'll be ready by then,\" I told him as I started to go inside. I took the elevator to my floor and as I opened the door to my apartment I heard Wilson complaining. \"Uggghhhh, Chuck why does Tom have to buzz the room over and over. Unlike you I am here trying to sleep a little more, I don't wake up at 4am every morning at first light. Tom needs to just lay off a little and enjoy the moment.\" \"I know Tom can be a little over the top since we've gotten back, but he just cares about me. He's helped us a lot and has stuck by us the entire time,\" I explained as I put on some clothes for work. I walked into the kitchen and grabbed an orange, a small task that will never cease to amaze me since I returned, to just walk into a room and grab food at the ready. \"Chuck! Earth to Chuck! Buddy if you stand there day dreaming Tom is going to buzz the room again and bother me again. Get going,\" called Wilson from the living room. I snapped back into reality once again. \"Alright, I'm off,\" I said as I walked once again out the door. When I came outside tom was sitting on a bench impatiently with two coffees in hand. \"Here ya go Chuck. One for you,\" he said as he handed me a hot cup of coffee, \"and one for me, sniiiifffff , ahhhhhhhh. That's more like it.\" I started sipping on my coffee as Tom hailed a cab to take us to work. A cab came screeching to a halt on the side of the road and we both got in. Soon we were pulling up to the FedEx headquarters. I handed some money to Tom who proceeded to pay the cab driver as I got out of the car. Once tom paid the cab driver he joined me as we walked inside of the building. As I opened the door a wave of heat and sound hit me like a ton of bricks. We had to go through central processing where I used to work, which was alive with people and machinery moving packages left, right, up, and down, in order to get to my new position in the office portion of the building since I returned. We finally reached the elevator near the back of central processing. Tom and I and other employees piled in in order to get to our floors. \"This is my stop Chuck,\" Tom said as he was about to leave the elevator, \"You,\" he pointed at me, \"me lunch?\" \"Yeah sure thing,\" I said automatically. \"Alright see you then my friend.\" The elevator closed and the ride began once again. A few floors later I got off at my department, tracking and record keeping. Unlike my other job, as a system engineer, where I was in charge of the delivery lines and shipments, I now was in charge of recording whether or not that our packages are take the fastest routes possible to their destination. If they are not they are make a report and we change the route for locations if necessary. It was quite different then what I used to do before. Now I was in an office away from the noise and stress of the delivery room. I made my way through the different cubicles, nodding hellos to some of the employees that turned their attention to me, and went to my office. \"Goooooood morning Helen!\" I said with a smile to my secretary. \"Good morning Mr. Noland,\" she replied calmly. \"Now didn't I tell you to call me Chuck, Helen?\" I asked jokingly with a smile. \"And didn't I tell you that you have some new paper work on your desk,\" she said with a grin. \"Well fine if that's how you want it,\" I said as I walked into my office. I could never seem to faze Helen. No matter how I went about she was also reserved, collected, and formal. \"I'll never get used to you secretary you know that? She always has a way to just throw you off just the tiniest bit,\" said Wilson. I almost jumped out of my shoes. \"Wilson, you really need to stop doing that to me. I about jumped out of my shoes.\" I said startled. \"You don't like wearing your shoes anyway, so I didn't think it would be a problem. It's also one of my favorite pastimes making you jump every once and awhile. I have to keep practicing otherwise I'll get rusty,\" he said sarcastically. Well he was right about one thing that I didn't like wearing my shoes. I went behind my desk and pulled back the large rolling chair back. I sat down, slipped off my shoes, and tried to get comfortable in the oversized chair. \"Wilson you are a volleyball you can't rust,\" I said trying to adjust myself which resulted in me lounging low in the chair with my feet resting on my desk. \"I find that term offensive,\" he joked, \"the politically corre-\" The door opened and I attempted to sit up in the giant chair which resulted in me just spinning around with one leg on the desk and one leg in the air. Helen popped her head around the edge of the door. \"Now don't forget Mr. Noland you have a meeting at 10 o'clock,\" she stated as she looked at me with a look of surprise trying to figure out how I ended up in that position. \"Thank you Helen, I'll make sure to be there,\" I said trying to make myself look as natural as possible as if it was all planned. She closed the door probably still confused on what exactly was happening. I finally was able to get out of the chair and sit in it properly. I looked around my desk and found all the paperwork that I needed to do. For most people this would be a lot for them, but the paperwork seemed like nothing compared to having to work to survive. After some time I opened the door on the way to the meeting. \"Helen,\" I said as I handed her the mountain of paperwork, \"make sure you get this to processing for me would you?\" I could tell she wanted to say yes, but she just looked at me astonished. A day's worth of paperwork I had finished in about an hour and a half. \"Thank you Helen, I appreciate your help,\" I teased as I walked away. The meeting left a lot to be desired. Every meeting it seems like nothing is actually accomplished. During most days I feel that we have a meeting to discuss what we are going to talk about at the meeting. There is a pre-meeting to the meeting, and then on top of that there is a post-meeting to further discuss what we just discussed, no wonder no one ever has their work done since they are in meetings all day talking about the work they need to do. Luckily Wilson kept making fun of my boss and mimicking him, but I had to stifle any laughter so I didn't give him away. Fortunately there was a break for lunch. I went to the break room and dug out the lunch I had brought with me. That day the break room was empty since most everyone either went out to eat or had a lunch meeting where they have food brought to them and have a meeting at the same time. That would be too much for me, so I contently sat and munched on my turkey sandwich. I sat there wondering when Tom was going to show up when I heard Wilson trying to open the fridge. \"Hey now unless you brought something that food is not for you,\" I said as I glanced towards the fridge behind me. \"Fine fine, it's not like I could have actually opened up the fridge anyway,\" he said looking at is spherical form, \"it's a little hard when I don't have any edges on me let alone any hands.\" I chuckled to myself as I imagined Wilson with arms and hands rolling around. \"If you had any hands you would get in all sorts of trouble,\" I said through my smile. At that moment Tom walked into the break room. \"Who doesn't have any hands?\" he asked me looking around for someone else in the room, \"Well anyway, sorry I was late my meeting ran a little late.\" \"I understand that,\" I said still munching my sandwich. \"So, what is this I hear about you having a date tonight,\" Tom said as he glanced at me while he was digging through the fridge looking for his lunch. \"I wouldn't call it a date. It's more like a friendly meeting to get to know Jessica to talk about the package I saved all those years.\" \"Getting to know someone better by going out to dinner at the new restaurant downtown? That my friend is what a date is,\" he joked. \"Well fine then it's a date, but that doesn't mean anything is happening between us,\" I retorted. \"Whatever you say Chuck…. buzzzz …. Uh oh that's my pager,\" he said taking his pager from off of his belt, \"Oh it looks like there is a backup in processing, I better get going and help figure out what went wrong. Sorry Chuck, good luck tonight you'll have to fill me in tomorrow.\" Tom hurried out of the room starting to page different people to figure out what went wrong. I stayed behind and finished my lunch. The rest of the day I didn't have that much to do since I finished my paperwork. I did have to suffer through another meeting, but it was much shorter this time which was nice. After the meeting I walked back to my office. \"Mr. Noland there was a package delivered to you, it's in your office,\" Helen said, pointing at the door to my office. I said, \"Thank you Helen,\" as I walked into the office wondering what it could be. As soon as I saw it I knew what it was. Inside my office there was a long, thin, and tall package leaning against my desk. I opened it up and I was right. It was the picture that I had taken of the island that I was stuck on. It was a picture taken from an airplane as it passed which some of my coworkers had flown by and taken. It was blown up on the canvas to fit a frame that could fill the huge open space on my wall. The time it took to hang it up took up the rest of my day, but it left me feeling good to have such a nice picture of such a crucial aspect of my life. \"Have a good evening Helen,\" I said as I was locking up my office. \"Rather you have a good evening,\" she said with a wink and a smile, obviously knowing that I had plans tonight. Since it was such a nice night I decided to walk home and enjoy the fresh air. As I was walking I realized that I still hadn't made reservation tonight. So I dialed up the restaurant. \"Hello this is Capitol Grille how can I help you,\" the voice asked on the phone. \"Uh yes I was wondering if you had any reservations available tonight around 7?\" I asked. \"Why yes we do. We have a table available at 7:15 Does that work, and how many would be dining with us?\" \"There would be three, and that time is perfect.\" \"We can do that sir, and a name for the reservation? \"Yes, Chuck Noland.\" \"Alright sir, we are all set for a reservation at 7:15.\" \"Thank you,\" I said as I hung up the phone. When I made the reservation it got me a little excited for tonight, I couldn't wait to tell Wilson that he was coming too. I knew he would be surprised when I told him. It took me a little longer to get home then I expected, but looking at the sky it was around 6:30 which was plenty of time to shower and get ready. I took a quick shower and then tried to find something to where. \"Wilson, I'm trying to decide on what to where,\" I called from my room, \"Actually here I have a couple options.\" I walked out of my room with two shirts and ties and stood in front of the mirror. \"Alright so is the white and purple tie good, or rather the blue and black tie?\" I asked while alternating which one I held in front of myself in the mirror. \"Blue and black,\" he said with an odd tone in his voice. I soon was dressed in the blue and black with some nice khaki's. I looked at the time and it was about time to leave. \"Alright, let's go Wilson,\" I said as we left the room. When we got outside I hailed a cap and gave him the address of Capitol Grille. It was not too far away, but there was some traffic so it took a little longer than expected. Wilson was unusually quiet in the cab and didn't seem to want to talk. The cap came up about a block away from the restaurant, but the traffic was at a dead standstill so I just payed the man and Wilson and I got out. I looked down towards the restaurant and I caught a glimpse of a women with red hair. I wasn't sure it was her, but then the women turned around and it was Jessica. Seeing her stand there in her beautiful navy dress I suddenly was very nervous. \"There she is Wilson. Man I'm getting nervous now. I was fine, but now…\" I anxiously. \"Oh you'll be fine, just be yourself and it'll turn out great,\" he said as we walked towards the restaurant. \"Oh hi Chuck over here,\" Jessica called once she saw me walking up to her. \"Well hello there,\" I said as I made my way towards her, \"I'm glad you could make it. You look very good tonight.\" \"Why thank you. I'm famished though so hopefully we don't have to wait long.\" \"Don't worry I actually remembered to made reservations. I'll be right back,\" I said as I approached the host stand, \"Reservations for Chuck Norris.\" \"Ah yes Mr. Norris, let me check on that. Just give me one moment,\" the host said and disappeared and then came back, \"unfortunately we are not able to accommodate a table for three at this time since the rest is full. You are welcome to wait though and we will seat you as soon as possible.\" \"Just give me one moment and I'll check with my party,\" I said taking a step back letting other people put their names in for the host. \"Hey Chuck,\" Wilson said, \"Look don't worry about me. This is your night. You and Jessica go I'll be alright.\" \"Are you sure buddy, I would hate to leave you out. I know Jessica would love to meet you.\" \"Really, it's okay she'll get to know me soon enough.\" I walked back to the host and explained that the party is now just a party of two and that he could seat us now. The host went to prepare the table and came back to Jessica and I as we walked into the restaurant. As we walked in I threw a thumbs up towards Wilson who smiled at me and then we were inside and I couldn't see him anymore. \"Don't worry Chuck, you are in good hands now. Jessica will get to know me very well, because Chuck you and me… we are… one and the same, but no it's time for you to let go of me and move on. I'll miss you buddy, but it's time for me to leave,\" Wilson said as he looked through the window of the restaurant. I didn't notice it right away, but once Jessica and I sat down I thought I saw Wilson in the window. But when I looked back he wasn't there. It must have been just my imagination.

Her eyes stung and every inch of her body ached. She shifted and opened her eyes to find she was on a beach...alone. She came to the conclusion she was alone after 2 days' travel around the island,only to come back to where she started towards noon of the second day,by the risings and settings of the sun. By then she was half starving, and bloody. Her hands, legs and feet were caked with dried blood, and every step made her wounds re-open. She knew she woul not last much longer if she was to go on this way,without food or water. She remembered some where -a long time ago,now -she had read the first thing to do in this situation is to find shelter, water, food,and fire ...then take account of what you have and don't have. Emily snorted at the latter - the 'don't have'-. \"I don't have a lot right now. I don't have ...food.I don't have...a cell phone .I don't have...a radio.\" She stepped on a shell, cutting her foot open. She swore loudly and dropped to the sand . \"I don't have shoes!\" Emily flopped on her back and stared at the sky. The sky was,it had to be said, beautiful, baby blue and not a cloud in sight. And She had to say it WAS a beautiful island...lush ferns, white sand beach, and the sound of the waves was very soothing,almost hypnotic. Emily closed her eyes,lifting her face to bask in the warm sunshine and thought to herself : \"Maybe this won't be so bad after all\" CRACK Emily shot straight up. It was dark out, but something was wrong. The dark was wrong. It felt wrong. The air felt thick and heavy and breathing in hurt Emily's lungs.

But I don't accept it. I am a HOPELESS romantic and every love story should end with warmth flooding through our bodies. So for those who liked the story ending without Chuck and Kelly, I advise that you don't read on. But to those who are just like me, and I hope I'm not alone in this, read on… because every love story should have a happy ending. \"Jerry?\" Kelly whispered in the dark. Jerry rolled over and flicked on the light. His face was streaked with pain but his eyes were soft. \"Don't say it,\" he begged. Kelly sighed. \"You haven't been the same since he came home,\" he observed. Kelly let a tear fall from her face. Jerry was wonderful. He had treated her like a goddess and she would always be grateful to him, but she couldn't pretend anymore. \"I know you've been meeting him,\" he said. \"I understood that you needed something from him that I couldn't give you. I was patient. I just didn't think it would end here.\" Over the last few months, Kelly had been meeting Chuck in secret. At first she just wanted to talk. In her head, she was sure that they could find a way to be friends, because losing him all over again would break her to pieces. He was the love of her life. Chuck was content with seeing her face once a week or so, it was her that pushed for more. The nightmares kept her awake most nights and she figured that if things changed somehow, if seeing him would prove his existence was not in her head, then the nightmares would stop. And they did. But with the absence of dreams came the presence of emotion. Kelly began to fall in love with him all over again. She listened to the stories he told of his four years on that Island. He talked about Wilson and the way he felt when the ball drifted further away from him at sea. He told her about the dreams he had, of seeing Wilson again. It had honestly felt like he had lost a dear friend, someone who had gotten him through those years on the Island, alone and scared. But he kept telling her that she was the reason he fought to stay alive. She was the reason he breathed life, against all odds that he would ever see her again. And even though he had lost her – twice, he was grateful to her for giving him a reason to survive. Kelly shared her own stories. She told him about the weeks that she couldn't get out of bed, when they finally stopped looking for him, when everyone around her told her to give up, said he was gone. She shared the pain of letting go only to discover that she was right, and how guilty she felt about her decision to marry. It wasn't that she didn't love her husband because she did, it was that he was her fallback and not the man she had envisioned growing old with. Chuck began to see the feelings come flooding back to her, and Kelly came to realize that his feelings had never left. \"I was standing at a crossroad, wondering where on earth I was going and then you called my cell phone,\" he told her. \"It was a sign.\" And that was why Kelly was awake tonight, and why she had come to the decision she had. Life was short and unpredictable and she would always love Jerry, after all he was the father of her child. But her heart belonged to Chuck, and though she had tried endlessly to change that, she couldn't. It wasn't fair on Jerry to expect anything less than a whole heart, and she couldn't offer him that. Not now. Not ever. Because tomorrow the sun would rise and it would bring them a second chance. \"I'm sorry, Jerry.\" \"I know,\" he nodded. \"So what happens now?\" she asked. \"I'll let you decide that. Just one favour?\" \"Anything.\" \"I want more than weekend visits with my kid,\" he said. \"I would never take her away from you. There's no limit on visiting. I promise,\" she stressed. The two of them hugged. Kelly knew that she was being unfair to him, but how much more unfair would it be to spend her life with him, wanting someone else? Her decision was made and it was the right one. And when she called Chuck the next day, it felt like a burden had been lifted. \"I love you,\" she said freely, as they met in the same café. \"Kelly, I…\" he was stunned. She touched his face, remembering the way they had kissed the night he came to her house. The passion that spread through her life wildfire. She wanted that again. She wanted him . \"Jerry knows how I feel about you,\" she explained. \"He knows I've never stopped loving you.\" \"Are you sure about this?\" he asked. \"I've never been surer.\" He pulled her to him, folding her into his arms and this time he knew, he was never going to let her go.

Summoning strength I push myself upwards, kicking and clawing. At least I think it's upwards, everything feels wrong. When I surface all I can see is water, vast expanses of it in every direction. A small raft that is nearly sunk drifts beside me, and something white is floating away in the other direction. Wilson! I struggle to propel myself forward, as the current threatens to bury me in its watery depths. Wilson bobs in and out of my vision, but I keep going. I need to get him back. I need him! And then my lungs are filling with water as I sink into despair. I`m done fighting. I open my eyes to darkness, with soft blankets tangled around my legs and sweat-soaked hair that almost feels like I really was drowning. A soft breeze blows through the open window, cooling my cheeks and bare chest. Charlotte stirs beside me and gives a soft snort. Her brown hair is in a terrible tangle, covering her soft face and delicate smile. After rubbing her arms, she rolls over and continues her slightly loud slumber. I always loved that, her way of sleeping that always let me know she`s there, so that I never feel the loneliness I once knew. I remember when we first met, how she was rushing out of that hole in the wall coffee shop in Denver, on her way to work. And she was so caught up in being on time that she ran right into me. She was frazzled and frantic, but took a moment to apologize. Then I met her desperate tears with a smile and a reminder that time is not what`s most important. Standing, I enter the hallway and pass the other two bedrooms in our small house. The living room is a mess, with toys and books scattered across the floor, but the walls are full of beautiful paintings and photos that bring a chaotic yet beautiful feeling. I stop in the centre of our perfect home, and look back to when I first stood here with my new wife and our beautiful twins. When it was finally time to settle down and let time pass around me. In a place so different than the island yet similar, with its rocks and summits, yet different in so many ways I can feel its memories fading into almost blissful vagueness. Outside is our large yard full of coniferous trees, with the Colorado Rocky Mountains close enough to touch. The Jones`s dog barks next door and I can hear an owl hooting in the distance. And when I close my eyes, the wind in the trees flows like waves of the sea, and the grass almost feels like sand on my bare feet. I know I'm not there, but I find it is okay to think of it sometimes. It was horrible, but I survived. And by surviving I can now think of that time with a bittersweet pain. \"Daddy, Why aren't you wearing shoes?\" a little voice call from behind. Rosy cheeks and thoughtful eyes, topped by a mop of blonde curls are staring at me from the doorway. They belong to my dearest Airest who is only three, but already seems to understand so much. \"I'm just looking at the stars; there are a lot of them tonight.\" \"No daddy, you came out here to sleep. And I think you just don't like wearing shoes.\" \"You know cutie; you are a very bright young lady.\" \"I know.\" She tots down the stairs and joins me as I spread out on the grass. \"What time is it daddy?\" \"It's close to sunrise.\" \"No I mean what hour?\" \"It doesn't matter.\" \"Daddy!\" She and her mother always become exasperated with me about my ideas of time. I just cannot help it, I spent so much time worrying about the hours and minutes and seconds, and it got me nowhere. I can feel her relax, and soon she is falling asleep on my chest. \"My teacher says you named Wilson after a volley ball.\" Her random statement brings a bittersweet smile to my face. \"No,\" I say \"I named him after a dear friend, my only friend in fact for a long time. \"Then what did you name me after?\" she yawns, and before I can answer she takes up her mother's snore. \"I named you after an island, very far away.\" \"Yes and I will never understand why I let you pick the names.\" Charlotte stands above me, with a sweater wrapped tightly around her and a sleeping Will in her arms. \"A stroke of pity.\" For a moment we stay there, staring at the sparkling stars above in the lightening sky. \"I finished the book last night.\" \"Before the deadline? Miracles really do happen.\" \"I just can't think of the right ending. How can I possibly summarize any of it? Everything that I went through?\" My wife simply smiles knowingly and nods toward the horizon. \"I think it will come to you soon enough.\" Suddenly the world is bathed in light as the sun rises above the mountain range. I soak in the warmth and look at my family, my small home, and the beautiful world outside it. And the perfect statement floods my mind. Always keep breathing… because tomorrow the sun will rise, and who knows what the tide will bring.

Wilson had stopped being an It a long time ago. Chuck didn't know when and he didn't know how but the volleyball had become more than an object. It was his friend, his companion, and now he was gone. And the thought was too much for him to bear. And so Chuck grieved. For the first time in years he allowed himself to cry, real tears, the kind one would cry as if someone had died. And in a way someone had. Gone was the comrade who had been there for him through thick and thin. Gone was the one who had been there for one of his greatest accomplishments on the island- creating fire. Gone was his sole source of of companionship in a mad enviroment. He didn't know what he would do now, other than grieve. Gone was the source of entertainment he had on the island. Chuck knew that he wasn't crazy, though sometimes he wondered if he wasn't. After all how many people could pass there time talking to a volleyball and retain their sanity? But ironically it was doing that that helped him stay same, though he knew no one would understand. It was something he didn't understand himself, but he didn't question it. Wilson became his friend, his only friend on the island, and he knew Chuck better than he knew himself. He listened to him, laughed with him, cried with him, advised him. When Chuck created the noose Wilson \"told\" him it wouldn't work but Chuck wouldn't listen. He had to test it out with the tree trunk and of course it didn't work out the way he had planned. Wilson was right; he was always right. And now he was gone. Wilson had given Chuck hope when he needed it the most. Most importantly he was there for the birth of his idea to get off the awful island. He'd been sacrificed for the cause. He would never be forgotten. Wiison would always be just between himself and the seas. Maybe it was better that way. ","Summary":" Just like that he was gone.

He had been lonely for days.rnrnSure, you could easily say that he had been lonely since the day that the plane crashed and he realized that he was alone on the island. But this was a new kind of lonely. The kind of lonliness that only a man can feel when he hasn't seen another woman in... how long was it? Too long. So long he had nearly forgotten the way another warm, writhing body felt beside his. So long he had nearly forgotten the feeling of hot, hot woman-flesh and it's hot, hot way of feeling so womanlike, so fleshy, during love-making.rnrnHe looked at his ball. His sad, lonely ball. And then he looked at Wilson.rnrn\"Wilson...\" Chuck said, the lonliness in his voice. rnrnWilson just stared at him. Watching his every move.rnrnThat was how it went. Chuck, staring. Wilson, staring. Both of them staring at each other. At the same time. Staring.rnrnFinally Chuck couldn't take it any more. He threw up his hands. \"I can't take this anymore, Wilson!\" He exclaimed. \"I'm so desperate for love! I'm so desperate for the feeling of...\" and then he trailed off. What was the feeling he was so desperate for? Not even Chuck knew anymore. He had forgotten.rnrnHis mind told him that it was something warm. Something... squishy.

After all they had been through together, he couldn't be sexual with someone else, it would break Wilson's heart.rnrnChuck fell asleep that night, alone, and uncertain of what to do. Wilson slept on the other side of the fire, as if somehow, the little volleyball knew what was going through Chuck's mind. The infidelity. The shame.

Powoli zapadanzmrok. Scena I Nimfa Aurora siedzi nandrzewie, niepostrzeżenie obserwując stojące przed domem Elżbietęni jej trzy córki. Aurora: w zamyśleniu, do siebie Gdzie bór niedostępny przeżedza się z deczka, Polanka urocza, a na niej chateczka. Tam skarby swe największe las przed ludźmi chowa. W tymże domeczku z córkami mieszka wdowa. Jest ona coraz starsza i bardziej niedołężna. Postanowiła, że córki znaleźć muszą męża. Wszystkie one piękne i warte uwagi, Lecz zapuszczać się w te odmęty, młodzieńcy nie mają odwagi. Że noc świętojańska magiczna, powiadają. Tak więc się siostry do lasu wybierają. Elżbieta: Daje każdej z córeknpo zapalonym kaganku. Weźcie z sobą światło, co mroki nocy rozprasza, A od swej matki - Słońca, uśmiechów się doprasza. Gdy ciemno, jasne Słońce ludziom swe dzieci zsyła, By nawet noc najstraszniejsza dobra się stała i miła. Idźcie śmiało do lasu, co jest przyjazny każdemu. Woła on wszystkich do siebie, by przyszli pokłonić się jemu. Dzisiaj, w Noc Świętojańską nad wszystkimi pannami, Czuwa odwieczny Duch Lasu, on idzie między wami. Tylko w tę jedną noc w roku w knieji skarb jest prawdziwy. Ten co go znajdzie szczęścia, bogactwa będzie godziwy. Aurora do siebie Pierwsza Wanda kroczy - ruda i czarnooka, Dumnie unosi swą głowę, na wszystko patrzy z wysoka. Do złota jej twarz się śmieje - suknie, klejnoty, komnaty... Mąż jej nie musi być piękny. Wystarczy, że będzie bogaty. Potem z oczami jasnymi co w nich ogień tańczy radosny, Idzie Laura najmłodsza, z włosami jak drewno sosny. Czeka ona na tego, co ją prawdziwie pokocha, A gdy jej przy nim nie będzie nieraz z tęsknoty zaszlocha. Na końcu, jak zawsze uważna, dwa razy nad wszystkim myśląca, Stąpa Zofia z włosami jak heban, na niebie wypatrując miesiąca. W jej głowie nauki i księgi, nie myśli o mężu wcale. Miłości jeszcze nie szuka. Nie interesują ją bale. Ciekawa jestem niezmiernie, co się im dzisiaj przydarzy. By zdobyć kwiat paproci, tak wielu niezmiennie marzy... Scena II Trzy siostry w lesie nanbagnach Wanda zdenerwowana i przestraszona Wiedziałam, że tak się stanie! Wiedziałam! Po prostu wiedziałam! I wcale do tego lasu po zmroku iść nie chciałam! Wszystko mi jedno co znajdę: paprocie, czy inne kwiaty! Natychmiast chcę wracać do domu! Chcę wracać do naszej chaty! Zofia spokojnie i cierpliwie Po pierwsze, droga siostro, chciałabym ci przypomnieć, Żeś pierwsza biegła do lasu. Chyba raczyłaś zapomnieć? Kolejną ważną jest rzeczą, że jeśli wracać mamy, Musimy najpierw wiedzieć jak iść do naszej polany. Laura ocierając zapłakane oczy Ja nie wiem, a bardzo bym chciała. Okropnie się tutaj boję. Te bagna są niebezpieczne. Ciągle zerkam, gdzie stoję. Zofia O wielki Duchu Lasu, co kroczysz między nami! Posłuchaj naszych głosów, do ciebie dziś wołamy! Pokaż nam drogę do domu, bo wiemy, że wielka twa moc! Ty jeden możesz nam pomóc i uratować nasz los! Scena III Pojawia się przyzwany przeznZofię Duch Lasu Duch Lasu Co słyszę? Ktoś mnie wzywa? Czegóż chcecie ludzie? Czy ja was każdej nocy ze snu ciężkiego budzę? Nie mogę chwili odpocząć, bo zaraz człowiek jakiś Mojego wzywa imienia. Do domu nie może trafić! Siostry wpatrują się wnzjawę z niedowierzaniem i przestrachem. Po krótkim czasienZofia odważa się przemówić. Zofia Wybacz nam, o duchu, że spokój twój zakłócamy. Powód jest tylko jeden - chcemy wrócić do mamy. Wysłała nas do lasu, by szukać szczęścia naszego. Chciała by z nas każda znalazła ukochanego. Duch Lasu ironicznie W lesie? Ciekawy to sposób szukania! Mężem ma być mchu kępa? A może wysoka kania? Zofia Proszę, nie dworuj z nas duchu. Ty wiesz, co tutaj robimy. Bądź tak wspaniałomyślny: pomóż dojść do doliny. Duch Lasu Chcesz wracać do domu bez kwiatu? Co matka powie na to? A gdyby był jeszcze wśród żywych, co powiedziałby tato? Skoro się już zjawiłem, może żal w szczęście przemienię, Jeśli każdej z was spełnię jedno najskrytsze marzenie? Wanda i Laura razem O tak! Wanda Może choć jedna rzecz, dnia tego feralnego Okaże się całkiem dobra i niepodobna do złego. Laura Prosimy, Duchu Lasu! Duch Lasu przyzwalająco kiwangłową Laura Spełnij wpierw moje życzenie! Zaręczam, że to o co proszę, to moje najskrytsze marzenie. Od dawna zauważyłam, że sama jestem na świecie Co prawda, mam matkę i siostry, ale... patrzy znacząco na Wandę inZofię No... same wiecie. Bardzo cię proszę duchu, daj mi chłopca takiego, Co do śmierci kochał mnie będzie i zawsze bronił od złego. Co będzie mi kwiaty przynosił i zawsze o mnie rozmyślał. Co będzie za mną tęsknił i o mnie wiersze wymyślał. Duch Lasu Taka jest twoja wola i wola twoja się spełni. Czemu Zofio uważnie przypatrujesz się pełni? Co dni dwadzieści siedem na niebie ją możesz oglądać, A spełnienia swego marzenia tylko raz jeden żądać. Wiem dobrze, a wiem wiele, że z mądrości słyniesz. Z jakim więc dzisiaj życzeniem z głębi umysłu wychyniesz? Zgaduję, że to czego pragniesz, czego chciałabyś dziecię, To nic innego niż tylko: być najmądrzejszą na świecie? Zofia Co chciałabym to jedno. O co proszę - drugie. Masz rację - mądrością swoją od zawsze się chlubię. Tak więc i tym razem, zdam się na jej podpowiedzi I nie poproszę o to, co w mojej głowie siedzi. Życzenie moje niewielkie i może śmieszne zda się Chcę tylko bym o poranku znalazła się w naszej chacie. Wanda chichocze cicho Duch Lasu Nie drwij z siostry Wando. Każda z was ma życzenie. Moim obowiązkiem jest tylko ich spełnienie. Możesz być pewna Zofio, że jutrzejszym rankiem Matka wdowa powita cię w chacie bardzo smacznym śniadankiem. Ostatnie już życzenie do ciebie Wando należy, Niech mi je więc twój piękny, cienki głosik powierzy. Wanda Chcę być bardzo bogata! Mieć zamki z mnóstwem sali! Chcę, aby mi się wszyscy z daleka już kłaniali. Chcę mieć piękne stroje, chcę piękne ogrody... Chcę także, żeby rycerze o mnie toczyli zawody! Duch Lasu I twemu życzeniu Wando, uczynię szybko za dość. Cieszy mnie to spotkanie, bo lubię odczuwać radość. A teraz drogie dziewczęta ruszajcie prosto przed siebie. Kierując się w tę stronę, gdzie jasna gwiazda na niebie. Laura Dziękujemy ci duchu! Wanda Że spełnisz nasze życzenia! Zofia Jeszcze raz dziękujemy i... może do zobaczenia! odchodzą Duch Lasu z udanym zakłopotaniem Och, kiedy spełniam życzenia, to często tak się dzieje, Że krótko ludzie się cieszą, ja za to długo się śmieję! Istotnie mądra jest Zofia, a siostry jej takie naiwne... Czasami marzeń spełnienie szczęściu być może przeciwne. Akt II Scena I dziewczęta wędrują dalejnprzez las, Laura idzie podskakując i nucąc jakąś piosenknę Wanda zaniepokojona Nie wiem jak wy moje drogie, czujecie się w tej dziczy, Ale jedno wam mogę powiedzieć: ja jakoś nie czuję różnicy. Nie czuję się wcale bogatsza, ani nawet sławniejsza... Zofia ironicznie Ja tylko zauważyłam, że Laura jest nieco dziwniejsza Wanda Że dziwna żadna nowina. Podobna do babci Marty Coś mi się tylko wydaje, że duch sobie zrobił żarty! Zofia Bądź bardziej cierpliwa. Nie marzysz Wando chyba, Że nagle deszcz złota spada i rycerz po ciebie przybywa? Laura przystaje Spójrzcie! Ja nie wiem... Siostry, czy też to widzicie? Tam chyba ktoś leży pod dębem? Tam, gdzie leśne poszycie. Zofia Istotnie. Chłopak jakiś... Wanda prycha Phi! \"Chłopak\" wędrowiec biedny. Zofia Skąd on się wziął w środku lasu? Wanda A skąd biorą się takie przybłędy? Złodziej albo wygnaniec... Laura Jest ranny! Dobry Boże...

Dobrze,że w leśnej głuszy spotkały go trzy dziewczęta. Laura z pomocą śpieszy, o prośbie swojej pamięta. A skoro wielki Duch Lasu spełnić ma czyjeś marzenie, Ten ktoś może być pewny, że sprawi przyrzecznie. Olaf oczy otwiera. Pierwszą Laurę widzi. Blondynka oczy spuszcza, rumieni się i wstydzi. Co on tam do niej mówi, że ona tak się uśmiecha? Acha! Teraz już słyszę! No to będzie uciecha! Scena III Zofia na stronie do Wandy Być może mi się zdaje i sprawia to księżyca pełnia, Lecz wszystko wskazuje na to, że życzenie Laury się spełnia. Wanda zadowolona Nareszcie dobre nowiny! Wnioskuję z tego wszakże, Że skoro jej się spełnia i moje spełni się także! Zofia do Olafa Olafie, czy zdołasz się podnieść? Musimy ruszać w drogę. Laura Jeśli masz jakieś problemy ja ci chętnie pomogę. Olaf Dziękuję, śliczna Lauro, kiedy patrzę na ciebie, To mimo bólu czuję jakbym się znajdował w niebie.

Książe Cyprian A ty wiesz, drogi ojcze, bo ciągle ci to mówię, Że nie znalzałem kobiety, którą z chęcią poślubię. Wiem co mi teraz powiesz: że urządzałeś bale, Księżniczki zapraszałeś, a ja ich nie chciałem wcale. Proponowałeś mi mieszczki, a potem i cieśliczkę, A ja zupełnie nie wiem jak mam wybrać księzniczkę.

Ta wdzięczy się, prostuje... Zabawni są bardzo ludzie. Ech... wracam na moje odludzie. Na trzy piękne córki, wdowa w domu czeka. I że ich tak długo nie ma, okropnie przy tym narzeka.

Zofia Pewnie nie bardziej niż ja... Spróbuj go zniechęcić. Każ mu wodę nosić, albo ryby wędzić... Laura Wodę?!

A jeśli będzie musiał to i przepłynie morze, Żeby mnie ujrzeć. Mówi: \"wszystko zrobię\" Elżbieta wychodzi zza domu Już ja tego gagatka prędko stąd wyskrobię! Skąd żeście znalazły takiego człowieka!? Jeśli on tu zostanie, mnie choroba czeka! Chciałam żeby z was każda męża sobie znalazła, Ale nie przewidziałam, że przywiedziecie błazna! Słuchać go nie mogę! Laura I nie ty jedyna!

Och, jaka szkoda! Mówią, że go na łowach zła spotkała przygoda. Ja zaś muszę przyznać, że jestem bardzo rada, Bo bycie władczynią kraju niezmiernie mi odpowiada. Jest jednak pewien problem, który musze rozwiązać, Król Edgar okropnie się uparł i chce się ze mną związać! Chce znowu żądzić królestwem, by tak jak on chce sięndziało, A prawdą jest, że mi również, by to odpowiadało. Plan zbrodni mam już gotowy: oto trucizny burtelka, Aby kogoś uśmiercić wystarczy jedna kropelka. Nie ma smaku, zapachu i król się nie pozna. Niedługo zaczyna obiad, więc wyruszać można. Wlewa truciznę do kielichankróla i wino do obu naczyń, odstawia buteleczkę na stolik inwychodzi z komnaty. Akt VI Następnego dnia.

Bardzo go kochałem, Chociaż nigdy tego okazać nie umiałem. Cóż za ogromne nieszczęście. Cóż za przypadeknsmutny. Fortuna bywa kapryśna, a Cypran zawsze był butny... Marszałek Dworu podejrzliwie Jeśli by mnie ktoś pytał, to byłbym skłonny powiedzieć, Że książe był świetny w łowach, na koniu też umiał siedzieć. Nie chcę być źle zrozumiany, lecz coś mi się nie podoba: Ta wieśniaczka - Wanda, ta niby \"wielka królowa\". Książe oburzony Ależ drogi marszałku! Nie sugerujesz chyba, Że brata mogłaby zabić żona nielitościwa. Cóż by jej przyszło z tego? Na pewno nie władza, Bo ojciec mój przecież żyje, a służba wciąż mu dogadza. Bardzo dobrze się czuje, a skoro zabrakło brata, To pewnie na tronie zasiądzie, znowu mój drogi tata. Scena II Drzwi do sali tronowejnotwierają się, wkracza posłaniec. Posłaniec Panie, wielki książe, przybywam ze smutną nowiną: Twój ojciec wczoraj wieczorem po obiedzie zginął. Nikt nie wie co się stało. Król w dzień czuł się dobrze. Całe nasze królestwo opłakuje go szczodrze. Książe zrywając się z tronu Mój ojciec?! O drogi Boże! Umarł?! Tak Nagle?! Dlaczego?! Marszałek Prawdę mówiąc, mój książe, to nie ma w tym nicndziwnego. Wspomnij na moje słowa. do posłańca Mam pewne pytanie: Czy mógłbyś nam powiedzieć w jakim królowa jestnstanie? Posłaniec zaskoczony pytaniem Królowa... Ma się dobrze. Marszałek Czy w żałobie chodzi? Posłaniec A jakże! I wachlarzem też czarnym się chłodzi. Marszałek Czy wesoła? Posłaniec Trudno mi wnioskować. Dopiero co męża zdążyła pochować... nagle coś sobie przypomina Dzisiaj z samego rana bal zapowiedziała! A potem zaproszenia wszędzie rozesłała... Książe Tyś rację miał marszałku! A ja nie wierzyłem... Na ludzi o dobrych sercach za bardzo się napatrzyłem. podstępnie Królowa chce zgiełku? Chce balu, chce zabawy? Przecież w ich urządzaniu, zupełnie nie ma wprawy. Zaraz zbiorę wojsko i taką wyprawię zabawę, Że do końca dni swoich zapamięta tę wrzawę! Akt VII Przed domem trzech dziewcząt. Scena I z lasu wybiega Olaf Olaf Lauro!!! Laura O nie! On znowu tu! Olaf Lauro! Nie uwierzysz! zatrzymuje się przed nią Aż brak mi tchu! Elżbieta sarkastycznie Co się znowu stało? Odkryłeś, że deszcz jest piękny, bo w wiadro napadało? Olaf Ależ nie! Tym razem ważne wieści przynoszę! Dlatego o chwilkę ciszy i wysłuchanie proszę! Powiem o co chodzi, pożegnam się, odejdę. Zajmie to tylko chwilę, zaraz z oczu wam zejdę. Zofia wychodzi z chaty Czy ja dobrze słyszę? A może słuch mnie myli? \"Odejdę\"? Czyś to powiedział? \"Odejdę po chwili\"? Olaf smutny Niestety, niestety... Mnie też trudno uwierzyć, Lecz ciągnie tu książe Eryk, by z naszym wojskiem się zmierzyć. Zofia Wojna?! Olaf To wszystko przez królową. Zabiła księcia i króla, chciała władczynią być nową. Pewnie nie myślała, a może nie wiedziała, Że z bratem swego męża problem będzie miała. Och, to straszne Lauro! Laura Raz jeden się z tobą zgadzam. Olaf Czy wyobrażasz sobie, że iść do wojska muszę?! Jakie ja tam bez ciebie cierpiał będę katusze! Laura ożywia się To znaczy... Olaf To znaczy, że jeśli zginę, zginę daleko od ciebie. A jeśli Bóg pozwoli spotkamy się kiedyś w Niebie. Laura wyraźnie się cieszy Bedę za tobą tęsknił! I będę myślał o tobie! Proszę, jeżeli umrę, choć dzień chodź po mnie w żałobie. Laura wzdycha No dobrze... Olaf pokrzepiony Zgadzasz się! Laura Cóż zrobić mogę. Chodź, dam ci ubrania i jakieś jedzenie na drogę. Olaf i Laura wychodzą Scena II Elżbieta i Zofia Elzbieta z bólem Nie mogę wprost uwierzyć... Wanda ich zabiła? Przecież z nami mieszkała, nigdy taka nie była... Zofia smutno Niestety, droga mamo, bogactwo ludzi zmienia. Niech diabli wezmą ducha i te jego życzenia! Nie dały nic dobrego, a ile zła przyniosły! Elżbieta Zofio, bardzo proszę... Wybierz się do siostry. Spróbuj z nią porozmawiać, jakoś jej doradzić. Ty masz tyle pomysłów... może jej jakieś zdradzisz? Zofia Dobrze mówisz mamo! Ruszam tam bez zwłoki. spogląda w niebo Słońce jeszcze wysoko i białe dziś obłoki. Nic Olafowi nie mów. Wolę wędrować sama, Niż przez kilka dni z rzędu słuchać tego \"pana\". Akt VIII Zofia wędruje przez las. Scena I Nagle widzi przed sobąnpowiększającą się poświatę. Zofia zdziwiona Cóż to? przypatruje się O! Poznaję! Duch Lasu! Duch Lasu We własnej osobie! zadowolony z siebie Ależ narobiłem ambarasu! Zofia odważnie Nie ma się z czego cieszyć. Lepiej zejdź z mojej drogi. Śpieszę właśnie do Wandy. Duch nie rusza się znmiejsca, wciąż zastępując Zofii drogę. Nie wzbudzasz we mnie trwogi. Raczej pogardę... Jak możesz nikczemniku, Na duszy ludzkiej uczuciach, grywać jak na fleciku!? Spełniłeś nasze życzenia, mocą swoją zdradliwą, Czyniąc z nas tym samym, każdą nieszczęśliwą. Duch Lasu niewinnie Każda miała życzenie, żadna nie powiedziała, Że życzenie jest takie, by szcześliwą się stała. Zofia Po raz wtóry proszę, byś zszedł z mojej drogi. Wędruję już dzień cały i bardzo bolą mnie nogi. Nie chcę tracić czasu na głupie z tobą rozmowy, Muszę się dostać do zamku i wbić coś Wandzie do głowy. Duch Lasu Pójdziesz tam, owszem. Lecz zanim to się stanie, Mam ja do ciebie Zofio jeszcze jedno pytanie: Jakie jest twe marzenie? Nie powiedziałaś tamtej nocy. Wiem i potrafię wiele, jednak nie wszystko w mej mocy. Zżera mnie wprost ciekawość, błagam, odpowiedz mi, Bo męczy mnie to strasznie już od wielu dni. Zofia Mam zdradzić ci moje marzenie? Cóż będę miała z tego? Czy z jakieś z twoich obietnic wynika coś dobrego? Duch Lasu Już dawno nie pamiętam, by mnie tak ktoś bawił, Kiedym jego życzenie moją mocą sprawił. Twoje siostry, Zofio, tak mnie rozśmieszyły, Że postanowiłem okazać się dla was w miarę miły. Zdradź mi swe życzenie, a spełni się od razu. Jeżeli zechcesz z królem, staniesz przy ołtarzu. Chcesz złota, miłości, mądrości...? Przyrzekam na Boga, Że żadna już twojej rodziny nie spotka więcej trwoga, Że wszystko się ułoży, będziecie szczęśliwi, A wszyscy dookoła będą wam życzliwi. Powiesz? Zofia Skoro już przyrzekłeś, to wypełnić musisz, A bym powiedziała życzenie, sam mnie usilnie kusisz. Jest następujące: nie skrzywdzisz już nikogo, Za sprawianie nieszczęść zapłacisz bardzo drogo. Słychać huk. Duch Lasunrozpływa się. Akt IX Obóz wojsk księcianEryka. W tle zgliszcza spalonego zamku. Scena I Zofia idzie drogą znprzerażeniem przypatrując się splądrowanej krainie i temu conzostało z zamku. Zofia z przestrachem Co tu się stało? Ludzi szukam próżno... Wszystko wskazuje na to, że przybyłam za późno. Dostrzega zamyślonegonmłodzieńca opartego o drzewo. Bardzo przepraszam, czy mógłbyś mi wyjaśnić Co się tutaj działo i w głowie mi rozjaśnić. Dawno tu nie byłam, mieszkam w ciemnym lesie... Że przybył książe Eryk wieść najnowsza niesie. Młodzieniec Przybył książe, przybył. Tak żałuje brata... A co jest nagorsze zmarł i jego tata. Zła królowa spisek podstępny uknuła I... według mnie przynajmniej, zbyt pewnie się czuła. Zofia przestraszona Co z nią?! Czy żyje?! Młodzieniec Żywa ta poczwara. Za wszystko co zrobiła wielka spotka ją kara. Spostrzega dziwny niepokójni rozpacz Zofii. Co ci jest panienko? Czy dobrze się czujesz? Zdaje mi się? A może złej Wandy żałujesz? Zofia Nie zdaje ci się chłopcze. Wanda to moja siostra. Wiem że wiele smutku wszystkim tu przyniosła. Nie chwalę wcale jej czynów - okropne mi się zdają, A jednak bardzo cierpię, gdy o niej źle powiadają. Przybyłam tutaj aby jakoś jej poradzić, Przemówić do rozumu, oleju do głowy wsadzić. Spóźniłam się, niestety. Tak wiele bym dała, Żebym tylko mogła, okazję taką miała... Z siostrą porozmawiać. Potrzebna jej otucha. do siebie I pomyśleć, że wszystko przez tego złego ducha! Młodzieniec Chodź ze mną, Zofio. Porozmawiasz z siostrą. Ostatnio traktowana była bardzo ostro. Nie przyzwyczajona jest do więzienia... Zofia podejrzliwie Przepraszam, nie zdradzałm ci mego imienia? Skąd więc... Młodzieniec Królowa wspominała, Że siostra jej mądra i taka wspaniała. Zofia zakłopotana Wybacz gwałtowność. Ostatnio wiele się zdarzyło I raczej negatywnie do życia mnie nastawiło. Staram się uważać z kim wymieniam słowa... Młodzieniec do siebie A to by dopiero była mi królowa! do Zofii Nie szkodzi Zofio. Dobrze to rozumiem. Chodźmy teraz do Wandy, trafić do niej umiem. Odchodzą w stronę namiotów. Scena II Nimfa Aurora przygląda sięnscenie ukryta na czubku wysokiego drzewa. Aurora śmiejąc się cicho No proszę! Zofia do obozu wrogiego wtargnęła I na wyjątkowego chłopca się natknęła. Ciekawa jestem bardzo, kiedy zauważy? Bardzo chcę zobaczyć jej śmieszny wyraz twarzy! Scena III Namiot w którymnprzetrzymywana jest królowa. Wanda, ubrana w wystawną, czarnąnsuknię, siedzi na środku wygodnego łoża. Usługuje jej ośmioronsłużacych. Zofia przypada do siotry Wanda! Wanda radośnie Zofia! Co u ciebie? A co słychać w domu? Zofia zaskoczona I kto te pytania powinien zadać komu?! Zabiłaś męża, króla! Coś ty narobiła!? Wanda ironicznie Gdybym była młodsza, to pewnie byś mnie zbiła? Żałuje moich czynów. Książe Eryk sądzi, Że kiedy umrę, w Niebie Pan Bóg mnie osądzi. Nie chce mnie zabijać, więzić nie chce w lochu... Wpierw straszył mnie, to prawda. Nasłuchał mego szlochu... Lecz to miły chłopiec. Uśmiecha się do młodzieńca,nktóry wszedł razem z Zofią Służący z naganą Więcej szacunku! Wanda z rozmarzeniem, do siebie Każda dziewczyna marzy o jego pocałunku... Zofia wskazując na młodzieńca To książe?! Wanda Bez obaw. On zaraz wszystkie nasze problemy rozwiąże! Akt X Kilka dni później.nPolana przed domem trzech dziewcząt. Scena I Laura siedzi przy balii inpierze. Laura Jakoś mi tak dziwnie... Nie mogę wprost uwierzyć, Że dzień się jakoś dłuży, jakby go nie mierzyć. Tak jakoś cicho i tak trochę nudno... A w domu ciągle czysto i nigdy nie jest brudno. Elżbieta wychyla się przez okno Coś mi się zdaje, czy tęsknisz za Olafem? Tym leniem, nudziarzem, okropnym chłopakiem? Laura Zofia i Wanda do domu wróciły... A Olaf... Prawda - głupi, ale przy tym miły. Najdroższy, co ja zrobię, jeśli ty nie żyjesz? Wanda wzrusza ramionami Mam mnóstwo czarnych sukni, jakąś się okryjesz. Elżbieta do Laury Nie martw się! Niebawem ujrzysz go w oddali. Takiego diabli nie wezmą, bo by nie wytrzymali. Akt XI Źródełko w lesie. Scena I Nimfa Aurora siedzi nankamieniu. Aurora Jak powiedziała Elżbieta, tak się potem stało. Olaf szybko powrócił. Uciechy było niemało. Książe Eryk Zofię o rękę poprosił, I do końca życia niemal na rękach nosił. Wanda dnia pewnego mniszki w lesie spotkała, A w krótki czas po tym do nich się zapisała. Pokuty wielkie czyniła, by grzechy swe odkupić I trochę zarabiała, by złoty pierścień kupić. Elżbieta dnia pewnego w lesie się zgubiła, Ale o pomoc ducha bez skutku prosiła. Nikt już go więcej nie widział, ani o nim nie słyszał, Bo duch w piekielnym kociołku z gorąca ledwo dyszał. To koniec tej historii panie i drodzy panowie. Pozwólcie, że mała nimfa na koniec morał wypowie. Rób to, co robisz, ale rób to dobrze. Za to cię fortuna wynagrodzi szczodrze.

At least let me offer you a snack or something to wet your whistle!\" Bettina insisted. \"I don't want to. ..\" Chuck hesitated. \"No trouble at all! In fact, I'd like a witness when I open this package. I could use someone to share Dick's last laugh!\" Bettina giggled. Chuck got out of the car and started to carry the volleyball he dubbed Wilson #2. .but he hesitated. \"Bring that ball inside! I haven't played volleyball in years and we could play a round! Great way to stretch the legs before you have to start drivin' again!\" Bettina laughed. \"I've never actually played. .\"Chuck gulped. \"I'll teach ya!

Come inside! We've got a package to open!\" Bettina exclaimed as she took Chuck's hand. South Pacific, Summer, 2004 Jerry Lovett , his wife Kelly Frears Lovett and their 7-year-old daughter were in a helicopter flying high above the endless expanse of blue. \"Is that it, Daddy?\" Becca asked. \" Yeah, honey!\" Jerry replied (somewhat uncomfortable in his Hawaiian shirt, cargo shorts and scuffs). \"It's a wonder Chuck ever wanted to leave that island,\" Kelly sighed (in her pink halter top, shorts and flip flops). \"I can see why he was inspired,\"Jerry sighed. \"Here we are! I'll pick you up same time in two days!\" the pilot exclaimed as he dropped them off on the beach then took back off. \"Hey! Glad you guys made it!\" exclaimed the tanned and robust Chuck Noland as he speared a fish in the water in a pair of cargo shorts then ran barefoot across the coral and lava rocks without the slightest discomfort or hesitation. \"I don't get you, Noland. How could you spend four years on this island, barely survive coming back to civilization and then return to this island?\" Jerry asked. \"Howdy!\" Bettina exclaimed as she walked out in flip flops and a flowered carrying a bundle in her arms. \"Does that answer. ..?\" Chuck laughed. \"This must be. .\"Kelly beamed. \"Meet our son Charles Wilson Noland!\" Chuck boomed as he walked over to the others and cuddled his tiny redheaded son and tenderly kissed Bettina on the lips. \"He turned six months old yesterday!\" Bettina beamed. \"But what do you do for food?

I was glad to be seeing all of my friends again, and they were glad to spend time with me. That is what people tend to do when they find out that someone that they thought was dead is really quite alive. I was never lonely. Still, I couldn't help remembering a friend that I had lost. I was walking along the beach one Saturday morning, about three weeks after I had been rescued. It's funny. You would think that after all of that time on the island, I would stay clear from the ocean. I wouldn't want to be near the sand, the waves, the palm trees. The thing is, though, it gives me a strange sense of belonging. I guess that you can't live in a place so long, and then totally forget about it, no matter how much you didn't want to be there. I was just going for my morning walk on the beach, when suddenly I saw something bobbing in the water. Was that a little kid out there drowning? \"Hey!\" I yelled, \"Are you okay out there?\" When there was no reply, I ran to the shoreline and jumped in, swimming out toward the bobbing head. I couldn't let someone drown. After all, that would be even worse of a fate than being stranded on an island after a plane crash. Once I got closer to the person, I realized that it wasn't a person after all. It was volleyball. Oh my gosh , I thought to myself, it couldn't be ! But it was. I could see from the markings that the volleyball was Wilson. My beloved friend from the island had made it back to me. I knew that I could always count on him. I took him home, and put him on my shelf, right next to my bed. Wilson is the only happy memory from the island, and I am so glad to have him back. He will be forever mine.

Parte 1: O Pacote e a Mulher Estava um limpo dia de Sol,num campo aberto,onde numa encruzinhada deserta,Chuck Noland se encontrava.Ao fundo uma caminhonete dos anos 50,da marca Ford,e de cor encarnada que sumia pela estrada,carregando na traseira um cão de pelagem abundante e dourada e branca. Chuck ficou observando por uns minutos o veículo até sumir no horizonte,em direção ao lugar que ele tinha anteriormente rumado. Ele percebeu que o logotipo que estava na caminhonete era idêntico ao que ele havia encontrado no portal daquela fazenda.E que a mulher que parou para lhe dar informações poderia ser a destinatária daquela encomenda... E então ele se sentiu mais tranqüilo,com uma sensação de dever cumprido.E entrando em seu carro,foi com ele,dirigindo até a companhia. Enquanto isso,na fazenda,uma linda mulher de cabelos ruivos e compridos de franja na testa,que usava uma blusa de manga curta verde com listras liláses e uma calça jeans;assim que estaciona a caminhonete,chega até a porta de sua casa,acompanhada de seu animal. Ela repara e pega do chão,ao lado da porta,um estranho e desbotado pacote,onde se lê em letras quase borradas:\"FEDEX\";e a data,1995.Aquela caixa retangular de papelão de entrega de correio,tem escrito o destinatário,que é:Bettina.Infelizmente o remetente,ela não conseguiu identificar adequadamente,devido ao estado e as condições decorridos de uma entrega efetuada em tempo tão longínquo... Bettina achou muito estranho uma correspondência ser datada de quatro anos chegar somente agora em sua casa.Mais estranho ainda,foi encontrar um bilhete destinado a ela dizendo: \"Este pacote salvou minha vida! Obrigado!! Chuck Noland.\" Ela achou muito curiosa as palavras contidas naquele bilhete... -Olha só,Lucky...-Disse para o cachorro enquanto o afagava na cabeça.-Mas quem será esse tal de Chuck Noland...? E depois entrou em casa com o pacote,juntamente com seu cão. Deixou o pacote em cima da mesa da sala e foi até a cozinha que era em estilo rústico com móveis de madeira envernizada com os eletrodómesticos arumados de forma ajustada entre os armários embutidos. Abriu a porta da geladeira da marca Frigidaire que era branca e estava lotada de imãs e com papéizinhos presos neles.Pegou uma garrafinha pequena de cerveja,tirou a tampinha e deu um pequeno gole. -Você está com fome,Luck?-Disse Bettina olhando carinhosamente para o cachorro. O cão se sentou no chão e deu dois latidos rápidos e então abanou a sua cauda longa e abundante de pêlos macios como um espanador.A língua do animal pendia para fora da boca e os olhos dele brilhavam. -Ah...então você quer comer,Lucky? Pois muito bem...A sua mamãe aqui vai te dar algo!!-Ela descansou a garrafa de cerveja na mesa da cozinha e foi até uma pequena despensa,onde tirou dela uma lata de comida canina.-Meu grande garoto está faminto,não é? Lucky ficou tão ansioso na espera pela refeição que ficou abanando sua cauda com muita rapidez. Ela pegou um abridor de lata e após abri-la,com uma colher retirou o conteúdo e pôs na vasilha de comida dele. O animal estava extremamente eufórico e ficou muito feliz,quando sua dona deixou a vasilha no chão,no lugar onde habitualmente costuma comer. -Isso mesmo...Bom garoto!!Coma tudinho,ok?-Disse,enquanto afagava a cabeça do cachorro. Em seguida,pegou sua cerveja na mesa,deu mais dois goles e foi até a sala pegar o pacote. Levando-o até a cozinha,pegou uma das facas que estavam dentro do faqueiro e pôs a caixa na mesa da cozinha e a garrafinha de cerveja também. Bettina abriu cuidadosamente a caixa com a ajuda daquela faca.Depois que percebeu que poderia abri-la sem ajuda dela,deixou a faca em cima da mesa e se sentou numa das cadeiras que fazem conjunto com a mesa da cozinha. Abriu o pacote lentamente... ...Por uns instantes,ela arregalou os olhos e depois exclamou com desdém: -Ah...é isso...!!-Em seguida empurrou a caixa pra outra extremidade da mesa e bebe a cerveja toda. Enquanto isso,no escritório da FEDEX,em Memphis... Chuck se encontra com seu amigo e colega de serviço,Stan. -E aí,Chuck?Conseguiu fazer aquela entrega que esperou tanto tempo pra fazer? -Sim...Stan...Finalmente consegui...-Disse Chuck com uma expressão cansada. Os dois foram caminhando até a sala onde fica o escritório de Chuck. Chuck senta-se em sua poltrona habitual e Stan na cadeira em frente da escrivaninha de seu amigo. A sala era bem simples,com paredes pintadas de branco e muitos murais de cortiça com papéizinhos pregados nelas.Haviam também alguns quadros e diplomas. Um relógio de parede redondo e de metal se destacava na parede em cima da escrivaninha onde Chuck estava sentado. Muitas estantes estavam em vários cantos e elas abarrotadas de pastas e livros.Um fichário ficava perto da porta ao lado do bebedouro. Um sofá de couro marrom estava na outra extremidade da sala,onde Chuck costuma tirar um cochilo depois do almoço.E algumas cadeiras espalhadas. O chão é de madeira corrida e nele um tapete verde muito sem graça. Na mesa conjugada de Chuck,um computador,telefone,fax,uma pequena TV portátil e alguns papéis,canetas um fichário e algumas cartas,etc. O escritório estava um pouquinho desorganizado,o que de fato seria algo impensável na vida de Chuck há uns anos atrás... -Aquele Stan,foi o único pacote que não tive coragem de abrir naquela ilha. -E por que?-Indagou curiosamente Stan sem entender os motivos de seu amigo. -Tive uma espécie de intuição que me dizia que aquele ali era especial e que não poderia abrir...Sei lá...Só achei que não deveria... -Entendo...-Stan se levantou e pegou um café na máquina para eles em dois copinhos de plástico.-Vamos tomar um café!!-E serviu a ele e seu amigo,e em seguida sentou-se. -Obrigado,Stan!!-Ele pegou o copinho e sorveu um pouco do café.-Sabe...minha vida realmente mudou...mudou mesmo!!Antes eu era um louco obcecado por tempo,horários e prazos...E não dava a devida atenção à minha família,saúde,amigos...e sobretudo à minha ex-noiva Kelly... -Você vivia muito estressado,eu me lembro!! -Aqueles anos que passei naquela ilha,me ensinaram a ser uma pesoa melhor e mais tolerante com os outros...a ser menos arrogante com os funcionários...e a dar valor as pequenas coisas da vida que mal prestamos atenção no nosso dia à dia...-Chuck tomou um grande gole de café e pegou mais.-Mas tem horas que me sinto culpado,pelas coisas que disse para os outros;pelas coisas que não disse para as pessoas que mais amei...e que acabei perdendo... -Olha,Chuck,Se quer realmente um conselho de seu amigo aqui,eu acho que você precisa tocar sua vida pra frente!!Pegue as lições que aprendeu na ilha e construa uma nova vida pra você!!Ainda pode fazer coisas maravilhosas...curtir tudo que não pôde e melhorar ainda mais!!Aproveite que agora seus documentos estão em dia e tem seu emprego aqui de volta!! -É...você tem razão,Stan...perdi muitas coisas quando estive isolado do mundo e de todos...Queria ter estado com todos vocês...Mas agora eu vou seguir o que disse!!-Ele suspirou um pouco e bebeu mais um pouco do café. -Te contei que mudaram agora também os meus papéis referentes à Kelly?O casamento que faríamos e todas as outras coisas? -É...você recebeu as novas mudanças feitas pelo advogado. -Sim,mudou tudo...Como não estou morto oficialmente e Kelly está casada com o meu dentista,e não pretende anular seu casamento pra ficar comigo;agora não adianta mais retornar ao nosso antigo relacionamento.São águas passadas...Ela poderá ficar em definitivo com ele,que não vou me importar...É um caminho sem volta,compreendo!!É como se fosse um divórcio...e não pretendo estragar a felicidade dela,ainda mais que tem uma filhinha com ele.Kelly escolheu continuar casada com aquele sujeito!!-Disse um Chuck conformado. -Vai ser melhor assim...Quem sabe agora não encontra uma pessoa nova na sua vida...? Antes que Chuck possa dar uma resposta,a secretária de Chuck bate na porta. -Entre,por favor,Claire!!-Disse Chuck olhando para a porta de vidro transparente. A jovem mulher entra na sala.Tinha cabelos castanhos presos numa fivela prateada e soltos atrás por entre os ombros.Seus olhos são azuis e aparentava ter uns 26 anos.Vestia uma blusa azul-marinho e branca,e usava um colar de pérolas de imitação que combinava com os brincos perolados que igualmente usava.Vestia também uma saia cinza clara justa e na altura dos joelhos e calçava sapatos escarpim pretos de saltos moderadamente altos.Carregava nas mãos uma agenda preta de couro e uma caneta dourada e azul. Chuck e Stan olham pra ela com curiosidade,querendo saber o que irá dizer de tão importante.Pois a secretária só poderia os interromper se algo fosse relevante. -Uma mulher acabou de ligar para o escritório há uns poucos minutos querendo saber quem é Chuck Noland.-Disse a secretária apressadamente. Chuck ficou de olhos arregalados e com expressão de surpresa... Será que é a tal mulher que ele mandou aquele pacote da FEDEX? O que o destino irá reservar para Chuck Noland...? CONTINUA NO PRÓXIMO CAPÍTULO...[Chapter 2] Parte 2: A Presença de Bettina na FEDEX Chuck e Stan olharam para a secretária bastante surpresos.Pois não esperavam que ela passasse um recado tão inesperado. E o curioso,é o fato daquela misteriosa mulher conhecer Chuck...mas de onde?Quem será ela? -Claire,diga-me quem é essa mulher?E se ela deixou algum telefone ou endereço de contato.-Perguntou com interesse Chuck. -Ela disse que se chama Bettina e deixou esse número de telefone. -Claire entregou para Chuck um papel arrancado da folha da agenda. Chuck arregalou os olhos quando a secretária disse o nome Bettina,pois se lembrou de ter ido naquele rancho,onde entregou a caixa.Ele pegou o papel e ficou olhando aqueles números... -Hum...interessante...quero saber quem é esta tal de Bettina...-Disse Chuck bastante intrigado. -Claire,ligue imediatamente para essa mulher,e depois transfira a ligação para o meu telefone! -Perfeitamente,senhor!-Disse a secretária ao receber de volta o papel e sair da sala em seguida. Stan olha para Chuck com um sorriso,ao perceber a reação de motivação de seu amigo em conhecer aquela mulher.Pois,há uns dias atrás ele lhe confidenciou que estava um pouco desapontado ao se reeencontrar com sua ex-noiva e descobri-la casada com outro homem,ainda mais sendo seu dentista. E agora,deseja que seu amigo Chuck,consiga esquecer Kelly e que possa continuar com sua vida normal,e se possível,encontre alguém bem especial...Quem sabe,um novo amor? -Chuck,quem é essa Bettina?Hein,amigo...de onde a conhece? -É a mulher daquela última caixa que eu não abri na ilha.Em outras palavras,ela é a verdadeira dona da encomenda.E eu fui lá no rancho dela devolver a caixa,com um bilhete de agradecimento. -Ah...então está explicado!!-Stan ficou contente com a sorte de seu amigo.-E você a viu pessoalmente? -Não...ainda não...Ela não estava lá quando eu deixei o pacote.Por isso deixei o bilhete e fui embora... -Entendo...Mas agora,amigo,você terá a oportunidade de conhecê-la!!E quem sabe...-Stan olhou para Chuck com um sorriso de otimismo.-Boa sorte!! -Obrigado,Stan...-Chuck,com o rosto corado com as palavras de Stan,sorriu discretamente,um pouco encabulado. De imediato,um som de campainha toca de dentro do escritório.Era o som da chamada do telefone da secretária,retornando com a ligação no viva voz. -Senhor,a sua ligação!!-Disse a secretária. -Claire,pode abrir.E...obrigado.-Disse Chuck um pouco ansioso. -Ah...Boa tarde,meu nome é Bettina;é sobre a encomenda da FEDEX.Estou falando mesmo com o senhor Chuck Noland? -Sim...sou eu mesmo.Pode falar... -Eu queria agradecer,se possível pessoalmente pela entrega da encomenda após todos esses anos.Pois eu nem esperava que algo tão antigo assim fosse entregue...Vocês são muito bons mesmo!!-Disse a moça com animação. -Bem...gostaria de conhecer pessoalmente as nossas instalações?Poderíamos marcar uma hora para isso... -Sim,sim...claro!!Eu gostaria muito... -Ok,vamos marcar uma hora com nossa secretária.Amanhã está bom para você? -Sim...Sem problemas...senhor Noland!! -Está certo!Claire,está me ouvindo?-Ele ligou um botão pra deixar a secretária na linha junto com eles. -Sim senhor,perfeitamente!!-Afirmou a secretária. -Marque uma hora na agenda amanhã,para que a senhora Bettina possa vir aqui conhecer as nossas instalações. -Vou fazer isso,senhor...-A secretária foi consultar no computador os compromissos daquele dia na agenda.-Hum...tem um espaço vago na sua agenda às 15 horas,senhor.Está bom para a senhora?Senhor Chuck...? -Está ótimo pra mim,Claire...Não tenho nada programado nessa hora...-Disse Chuck. -Tudo bem!Está perfeito!!É muito tranqüila a hora...-Disse Bettina com uma voz suave. -Muito bem,senhor!Vou anotar o compromisso na agenda...-Disse a secretária. -Obrigado,Claire!!-Chuck desligou o botão que ligava a secretária com ele e Bettina. -Então...senhora Bettina,está marcado para às 15 horas de amanhã,ok?-Disse Chuck confiante. -Sim...nos veremos amanhã,senhor Noland...E muito obrigada por tudo!-Disse Bettina antes de desligar. Stan olhou para seu amigo com um sorriso de esperança,pois pressente que algo muito bom possa vir desse encontro na FEDEX...Em seguida deu um tapinha amistoso nas costas de Chuck,com o intuito de levantar o moral dele,e assim o incentivar a ter mais ânimo para as coisas da sua vida,de agora em diante.Chuck simplesmente retribuiu com um sorriso simpático,cheio de otimismo... -Nossa,Chuck!!Você deve ser mesmo um cara de sorte!!Você vai conhecer a moça!!Ela tem uma voz muito bonita...Hehe... -Calma aí,Stan!!Isso não é um encontro!!Ela vem aqui para me agradecer pelo pacote e também para conhecer a nossa FEDEX daqui!!-Disse Chuck com o rosto vermelho de vergonha e um pouco aflito com as insinuações de seu amigo. -Mas ela vem para te conhecer...e agradecer amigo!!Quem sabe ela não é bonita também?E pode pintar algo para você...Ela parece estar muito interessada em te conhecer!! -Mas ainda nem sequer sabemos se ela é casada ou não,Stan!!Não quero alimentar falsas esperanças... -Espere amanhã e verá por você mesmo,amigo!!Hehehe...Nunca se sabe o que o destino nos reserva!!-Disse Stan com muita confiança enquanto dava tapinhas amistosos no ombro de Chuck. No dia seguinte,no escritório da FEDEX,em Memphis...Eram quase 15 horas... Chuck e Stan estavam no escritório,calmamente sentados tomando um café da máquina,conversando animadamente sobre o último jogo de beisebol,que passou na TV,enquanto esperavam que Bettina chegassse;quando a secretária se aproximou deles... Ela veio acompanhada de uma linda mulher de cabelos ruivos,presos num rabo-de-cavalo,com um óculos de Sol;que usava um casaquinho cor de caramelo,blusinha branca com bordados de flores douradas,calça jeans e um tênis da moda.Carregava uma bolsa marrom de couro sintético. -Senhor,esta é a senhora Bettina que veio te conhecer pessoalmente e a nossa FEDEX.-Disse Claire. Os olhos de Chuck se arregalaram quando viu o rosto da mulher,e ainda mais,quando ela tirou os óculos do rosto e os pendurou na blusa.Ele a reconheceu...!! Era a tal mulher que há uns dias atrás ele havia encontrado naquela encruzilhada...que vinha dirigindo aquela caminhonete vermelha dos anos 50,em cuja caçamba tinha um cão grande de pelagem dourada e abundante. A simpática e bonita moça que lhe ajudou com algumas informações sobre qual caminho deveria seguir para retornar ao seu destino... \"Então esta é a Bettina?\"-Pensou Chuck. Por outro lado,a moça reconheceu Chuck Noland,como sendo aquele homem que parecia meio perdido naquela encruzilhada,com um mapa bem grande extendido sobre a capota do carro,tentando se localizar naquela região... \"Este homem me é familiar...O seu nome...de onde que eu ouvi...?\"-Pensou Bettina,enquanto fazia uma breve associação do nome Chuck Noland,com o rosto daquele homem que conheceu antes,naquele dia. -Muito prazer,eu sou a Bettina!!-Disse a mulher enquanto extendia a mão para o cumprimento. -Igualmente!!Eu sou o Chuck Noland e este é meu colega e amigo Stan.-Disse,enquanto a cumprimentava com a mão e apresentava seu amigo para a moça que o cumprimentou também. Naquele momento,Stan percebeu o quanto que era bonita a moça.E pressentiu que seu amigo Chuck poderia ter alguma chance com ela.E assim,decidiu ajudar,apoiar e incentivá-lo a sair com ela também. -Gostaria de tomar um café,chá,refrigerante...alguma coisa?-Perguntou Chuck para Bettina. -Hum...aceito sim um café.Obrigada!-Disse Bettina com muita simpatia. -Então venha sentar-se aqui!!-Disse Chuck enquanto oferecia uma cadeira para a moça.-Claire,por favor,pode trazer para nós um café bem caprichado? -Sim,senhor!Perfeitamente!-Disse a secretária enquanto se retirava da sala. Chuck ficou sentado atrás da escrivanhinha,Bettina na frente e Stan,no sofá ao lado. Assim que todos ficaram bem acomodados em seus assentos naquela sala,um pequeno e momentâneo silêncio tomou conta do lugar...o único som que se ouvia era o do relógio de parede que marcava as horas na parede atrás da escrivaninha de o a porta estava fechada,o burburinho do som das vozes dos outros funcionários e o barulho de caixas e objetos sendo levados,ficaram bastante abafados dentro do escritório. O silêncio era mortal...Pois eles ficaram se encarando um com o outro,tentando encontrar palavras para iniciar uma conversa... Chuck segurando uma caneta na mão,brincando com ela freneticamente,enquanto que Bettina pegou os seus óculos e os pôs em cima da mesa,esperando que ele dissesse algo;pois como é educada,esperava que o anfitrião tivesse a primeira palavra. Até que Stan,ao perceber como seu amigo é muito tímido,principalmente na presença de pessoas estranhas...ainda mais sendo mulheres;resolveu quebrar o gelo de maneira mais amistosa e com um sorriso confortador... -Seja bemvinda a nossa FEDEX de Memphis!!Esta é uma das nossas filiais. -Obrigada...-Disse Bettina com um sorriso enquanto pendurava o óculos na blusa. -O meu amigo Chuck foi quem te entregou o pacote.Não foi,Chuck?-Disse Stan olhando para o seu amigo de modo que este percebesse que deveria começar logo a conversa com ela. -Ah...sim...Fui eu mesmo...-Disse Chuck um pouco encabulado.-Veio tudo direitinho?Não sofreu danos? -Sim,sim...Veio perfeitamente em ordem,estava tudo intacto.Obrigada!-Ela sorriu amistosamente para Chuck,no que Stan gostou muito. -Eu só admiro o fato de que tenha chegado assim inteiro e depois de tanto tempo...O seu nome não me é estranho,senhor Noland...acho que já ouvi falar dele...em algum lugar...-Disse a moça intrigada. -Provalemente já deve ter ouvido o meu nome nos noticiários da TV.Sou o cara da FEDEX que estava desaparecido e que foi resgatado em alto-mar. -Isso mesmo!!É isso,sim!!Agora que me lembrei!!-Disse Bettina estalando os dedos com um sorriso. Nesse mesmo instante,a conversa foi interrompida,com a chegada da secretária que bateu na porta,dizendo: -Trouxe o café,senhor! -Pode entrar,Claire!-Disse Chuck,enquanto a secretária entrava.-Obrigado! Claire chegou com uma bandeja,trazendo café,açúcar,adoçante e alguns muffins de chocolate. Ela primeiro serviu à Bettina,depois ao Chuck...e por último ao Stan.E depois ela se retirou da sala. O café estava deliciosamente saboroso...o aroma inebriante daquela bebida forte e consistentemente marcante invadia o ambiente por completo,tornando mais animadora ainda a conversa. os bolinhos de chocolate,os tais muffins,estavam macios e quentinhos,pois foram comprados numa padaria bem próxima da FEDEX. -Hum...muito bom...Eu gostei,senhor Noland!!-Disse Bettina enquanto saboreava um dos muffins. -Ah...sim eles são ótimos!!-Disse Chuck depois de dar um gole do café.-Assim que terminarmos,poderemos conhecer as instalações,o que acha? -Está certo!!Obrigada!!-Disse Bettina se servindo de mais café. -Nós aqui na FEDEX somos como uma grande famíla,e creio que irá gostar muito do ambiente de trabalho.Somos todos felizes aqui!!-Disse Stan enquanto pegava um muffin. Passados alguns minutos após o café,os três se dirigiram para fora do escritório,onde estavam os demais funcionários da firma que trabalhavam incessantemente. -Bem...creio que agora tenho muitas coisas para fazer,e portanto não poderei ficar com vocês agora...Deixo esse trabalho para o meu amigo Chuck aqui!!-Disse Stan enquanto piscava e dava um ligeiro tapinha no ombro de seu amigo.-Cuide bem da moça!E aproveite a visita guiada,senhora,foi um prazer em conhecê-la!!-Disse Stan enquanto estendia a mão para cumprimentar a Bettina. Stan saiu de lá com um sorriso de satisfação,e foi para uma outra sala,onde ele costuma usar em seu trabalho.Ele deixou Chuck sozinho com a mulher,porque queria que seu amigo fizesse amizade com ela,ou algo mais... Esta é definitivamente a sua intenção,pois sempre se preocupou com o bem estar de seu amigo,que nas últimas semanas andava um pouco deprimido por causa de seu encontro com a ex-noiva,Kelly,que agora está casada com aquele dentista e com uma filhinha. Chuck levou Bettina para conhecer várias partes da empresa,tais como:A seção de triagem,chegada,envio,empacotamento,inspeção,carimbo e os vários meios utilizados para o despacho das encomendas,etc.Tudo muito organizado e feito de maneira rápida e eficiente. Os funcionários já demonstram agora possuírem mais motivação e boa vontade em seus trabalhos,graças as novas mudanças estabelecidas nas filiais de todas as FEDEX que existem nos Estados Unidos e no exterior;pois o conceito mudou,tornando a labuta mais humanizada,como se a empresa fosse como uma grande família,e não apenas o frio relacionamento de patrões e empregados. Tudo isso foi conseguido após Chuck voltar daquela ilha tropical deserta e isolada num canto nas lonjuras do Pacífico... Chuck mudou radicalmente seu modo de pensar e agir com as pessoas agora.Sendo mais amigo,humano,afetuoso... Ele,que outrora fora bastante inflexível,rígido e arrogante com os empregados;e com a sua família e amigos fora mais negligente...Mas isso mudou,porque a ilha foi o seu maior mestre!! Um mestre que lhe ensinou a valorizar as pequenas coisas na vida...a ser mais humilde e paciente... Aprendeu a amar a vida,e ao mesmo tempo a ter desapego as inúteis fulilidades mundanas do mundo. -E assim...as nossas caixas contendo as correspondências de nossos clientes são despachadas para todas as partes da América,e também de várias partes do mundo!!-Disse Chuck com grande entusiasmo. -É tudo muito interessante mesmo!!Gostei!!-Disse Bettina bastante impressionada com a empresa.-Agora tenho que ir...Preciso voltar para casa.Pois deixei meu cão e minha fazenda... -Entendo...Venha comigo até o escritório. Eles foram até a sala,no que foram ao longe sendo observados por Stan que ficou contente em ver que seu amigo está indo bem na conversa com a moça. -Quando você quiser nos visitar novamente,esteja sempre benvinda!!-Disse Chuck. -Ah...sim,obrigada!-Ela abriu a sua bolsa e tirou dela um cartão,e o entregou para Chuck.-Eu gostaria de conversar mais contigo,pois gostei muito de conhecer a FEDEX,por isso te darei meu telefone,para marcarmos um almoço ou jantar para que possamos conversar melhor. -Ok!!Combinado!!Por favor,me acompanhe até a porta que eu te chamarei um táxi. Chuck acompanhou Bettina até lá fora,onde achou um táxi para que ela voltasse para sua casa. Quando Stan viu que Chuck se despediu da moça,este se aproximou dele,dando-lhe um tapinha amigável nas costas,e fez com o polegar um sinal de positivo com um sorriso de otimismo.E depois pousou seu braço sobre os ombros de seu amigo. -Ela é bem simpática,não,Chuck? -Sim...Mas ela desejou marcarmos um outro encontro para conversarmos melhor... -Desconfio que esteja livre,ou seja:Não é aparentemente casada ou algo parecido... -STAN?!-Chuck ficou um pouco corado e ficou amolado com as insinuações de seu amigo.-Pára com isso!! -Então vamos tomar uma cerveja depois que terminarmos o expediente daqui?Eu pago!!Vai querer? -É uma boa idéia,Stan...Estou querendo mesmo relaxar...Meu dia foi cheio de muitas surpresas... -Sim...e muito boas!!Hehehe!!-Disse Stan animado. E logo após o fim do dia,Stan levou seu amigo Chuck para beber umas cervejas num barzinho bem próximo ao escritório da FEDEX,onde puderam confabular sobre as novas alegrias,as mudanças de vida e todas as coisas boas que desejavam viver;futebol,beisebol,viagens,festas,carros;...planos para o futuro,e sonhos repletos de renovadas esperanças...

Melanie wasn't listening, she was looking at a smoky hole innthe sand, reaching her hand out to touch it. Jake stopped her. \"Don't touchnit Mel, it's hot,\" he said, grabbing her hand and holding them. \"We'll bensafe here,\" he said. \"How do you know?\" she asked, a little timidly.n\"Cause, lightning never strikes the same place twice,\" he said. LittlenMelanie looked at him, reassured. \"So will you marry me?\" he asked. Shendidn't say anything for a minute. \"Why do you want to marry me?\" she askedncuriously. \"So I can kiss you anytime I want to,\" he said, smiling. Shenstood up and they faced each other. Jake leaned in a little, slowly atnfirst. Melanie leaned in towards him, and they kissed softly. Melanie, Jake, Wade, and Bobby Ray were sitting in a large red booth insidenthe diner sharing milkshakes. They turned and looked as they saw Eldonncoming in, carrying a cat named Fuzz. \"What's wrong with him?\" askednMelanie as Wade came over and sat with them. \"He's got cancer,\" said Wade.n\"They're going to kill him since no one wants him,\" he said. Melanie's eyesnopened real wide. \"No, they can't do that,\" she whined. \"Being blown upnwon't be any better,\" said Bobby Ray. \"Yeah, but it will go faster,\" saidnJake. \"Well come on guys let's go,\" shouted Wade and Eldon, jumping up,ntaking the scruffy cat with them. Melanie and Jake followed them curiously.nThey were headed down to the old highway to get some explosives. \"Will this be enough?\" asked Melanie, watching the boys. \"Let's hope so,nthis is all we got,\" said Bobby Ray. Jake and Eldon taped the dynamite tonFuzz. Bobby Ray lit the fuse and they ran as fast as they could back to thendiner. \"Is he gonna be okay?\" asked Melanie. \"He'll be fine Mel, now hushnyour mouth before you get us caught,\" said Jake, taking her by the hand asnthey ran. Out of breath, they went into the diner and sat down together.n\"Five chocolate milkshakes please,\" said Bobby Ray. The waitress broughtnthem their milkshakes and they sipped the thick chocolate through stripednstraws without talking. Melanie looked up and stopped sipping her shake. Pointing outside thenwindow she said, \"Hey, isn't that Fuzz?\" The boys were startled at thensight of the cat. \"I thought you said that he would stay out of town, outnin the field,\" said Melanie. \"We thought he would,\" said Bobby Ray. \"Fuzznmust really like you Eldon, what'd you give him?\" \"Just some tuna,\" saidnEldon. Leaving their milkshakes on the table, they rushed outside to get Fuzz.nWhen they got outside and up close to him, they saw the flame near hisnblack tail. As Bobby Ray came closer to him, Fuzz shot away and ran into antiny hole near the alley behind the bank. \"Maybe he'll find his way home,\"nsaid Wade. But it was too late. They heard a loud boom come from behind thenalley. \"Poor Fuzz,\" whispered Melanie. \"Anything's better than cancer,\"nsaid Wade. Before anyone could say anything else, the only fire engine inntown came tearing after them. \"Let's step on it!\" they said, running asnfast as they could and hiding behind some trees. They stayed there until it got dark. \"I think the coast is clear now,\"nwhispered Wade. \"Come on, I've got an idea,\" said Eldon. \"Oh no what is itnthis time,\" mumbled Jake. \"Come on, just come on,\" said Eldon. The fournagreed and followed Eldon to the Winn-Dixie in town. \"I don't want to go,ncan't I get another?\" asked Melanie, whining a little. \"Come on now Mel,ndon't be a baby,\" said Wade. \"You gotta go, you've been dared,\" said Eldon.n\"We'll be waiting right here for you when you get back,\" said Jake. Melaniensighed. She tiptoed up the side of the store. She looked back at the fournboys. \"Go on,\" whispered Eldon, motioning for her to go. Melanie nodded.nJake began to giggle. \"She's gonna be busted.\" \"Nah, no one would believenshe would do something like that,\" said Eldon. Melanie came back fromnaround the corner, out of breath and her jacket a little bulkier thannbefore. She unzipped it and pulled out three rib-eye steaks. The boys werenwide-eyed. \"Holy cow Mel, I didn't think you'd do it,\" said Eldon. \"I don'tnbelieve it,\" said Wade. \"Believe it,\" said Melanie with a smile, glancingnat Jake. The next night, the five kids stood behind the fence staring at the sign innfront of them that read \"No Trespassing.\" But that wasn't going to stopnthem. \"But we can't go in there,\" said Bobby Ray. \"That doesn't matter,ncome on,\" said Eldon, climbing over the fence. Wade, Bobby Ray, Jake andnMelanie followed. They stood in the middle of the field, looking at cownchewing on the freshly dewed grass. \"Come on guys, help me. Get on thatnside,\" pointed Eldon. Wade and Eldon got on one side, then Melanie, Jake,nand Bobby Ray got on the other side. \"One, two, three.TIP!\" said Eldon.nAfter some effort, the cow lay on his side and mooed loudly. Eldon walkedncloser to the cow, and took out a can of Silly String from inside of hisnjacket pocket. He shook it up and took the cap off. \"What are you going tondo with that?\" asked Wade. \"You'll see,\" said Eldon. He wrote carefullynwith the Silly String, making sure that it didn't break. At the cows feet,nhe wrote, \"Thanks for the tip!\" They all began to laugh as they watchednEldon write in the Silly String. It began to get much darker. \"Let's getnout of here,\" said Bobby Ray, walking back and climbing over the fence.nJake, Melanie, Eldon, and Wade followed him. \"Night, see you tomorrow,\"nsaid Melanie, walking into the house. Melanie didn't want her mom to catch her, and crept quietly down the hallnand into her room. But it was too late. \"Melanie Smooter!\" Uh oh, busted.nMelanie hung her head as her mother scolded her. \"You need to stop spendingntime with those boys, you'll only get yourself in trouble,\" said Pearl.n\"Now go to bed,\" said her mother. \"Yes ma'am,\" said Melanie, hanging hernhead as she walked down the hall into her room and shut the light off,nclimbing into bed without even changing her clothes. Several days later, the five were sitting in their bare feet with theirnlegs hanging over the dock, splashing in the water. \"I'm bored,\" said Wade,nswinging his legs back and forth a little faster, splashing the water andnmaking it come up and getting them wet. \"So I am,\" said Melanie. \"Me too,\"nsaid Jake. \"Yeah,\" said Bobby Ray. \"I've got an idea,\" said Eldon. They allnsighed. \"Something that my brother and his friends used to do when theynwere bored, just like us,\" he said, taking a cigarette lighter out of hisnpocket. \"Come on Wade,\" coaxed Jake, catching on to Eldon's idea. Eldonnwent first. He struck the lighter and watched the flame surge. Jakenvolunteered to go next as soon as the methane smell left the air. Melanientried to say between all the laughter, \"I'll never get why you think thisnis so funny.\" But she was giggling so hard so could hardly stop herselfnfrom laughing. It was Wade's turn next. It was unfortunate for him that thengas was too much.the lighter was too close to his pants. But they were allnlaughing so hard they didn't notice. Melanie and Jake looked up at the samentime, roaring with laughter as they saw a stream of smoke slowly creepingndown Wade's pant leg. Wade screamed as tiny flames began to appear on hisnpants. He stopped swinging his legs and jumped into the water below.nMelanie, Jake, Eldon, and Bobby Ray watched, falling over with laughter.[Chapter 2] SEVEN YEARS LATER Jake came up to Melanie's porch and knocked on the screen door. \"I'mnleavin' Momma,\" said Melanie, going out the door to meet Jake. Melanie shutnthe door and took Jake's hand. They got in Jake's rickety red truck and henstarted up the engine. \"Where we going?\" asked Melanie. \"It's a surprise,\"nsaid Jake with a smile. He stopped the truck by the pier and shut it off.nHe didn't move, just sat there for a minute. Melanie stared at him. Jakenleaned in towards her. They were so close she could feel his warm breath onnher face. They kissed gently, and Jake took off Melanie's jean jacket. Theynstopped kissing for a minute, and looked deep into each other's eyes. Jakenclimbed into the back of the truck and motioned for Melanie to follow him.nThey held each other tight and began to kiss again. Melanie's hands ran upnJake's chest, and she unbuttoned his red shirt, taking it off.. Jake brought Melanie home and stopped the truck in front of her house. Hengave her a kiss on the mouth and she got out of the car, smiling at his asnshe shut the car door and went into the house. Jake watched her and madensure she got into the house, then drove away slowly. She didn't saynanything to her mom as she went down the hall to her room and shut thendoor. Climbing into bed, she lay awake in the dark all night, thinkingnabout what had happened. The next few days were a little awkward between Jake and Melanie. Jakendidn't come to Melanie's house every day to come and see her like henusually did. They didn't hang out with Bobby Ray and Eldon and Wade likenthey always did. No more pranks. They had grown up. No more cow tipping, nonmore stealing steaks, no more Silly String. Eldon, Bobby Ray, Wade, and Jake were sitting in the diner drinking sodasnwhen Melanie came in. \"Hey Mel,\" Eldon and Wade said casually. Jake smilednshyly at Melanie. \"Hey Mel,\" he said. She smiled back, sitting down betweennBobby Ray and Jake. \"Hi,\" she said. Bobby Ray could tell that something wasna little weird with Jake and Melanie, but he didn't say anything, justnshared a glance between Wade and Eldon. The next week, Jake came to pick up Melanie. He thought she was acting anlittle weird. They didn't really talk on the way down to the pier untilnthey got there. When they got there, they got out of the car and sat downnon the pier, dangling their feet and splashing in the water like they hadndone when they were younger. \"You okay Mel?\" he asked. She nodded, \"Yeah.\"n\"You sure?\" he asked, pressing a little. She shook her head. \"No.\" \"What isnit?\" he asked. She took a deep breath and looked at him. \"I'm pregnant,\"nshe said. Jake was silent, he didn't know what to say. \"So now what?\" henasked. Melanie shook her head and began to sob. \"I don't know,\" she said.n\"I'm going to leave Alabama. I'm going to New York,\" she said. \"Stay herenMel,\" he said, a little coaxing. \"I can't Jake,\" she said, starting to cryna little more. He stopped her from crying and took her in his arms. \"Don'tncry Mel. I'm sorry, it's going to be alright,\" said Jake, hugging andnrocking her in his arms. She nodded and tried to stop crying. He let go ofnher and she wiped her face, sniffling a little. She took her feet out ofnthe water and walked away from Jake, sitting on a nearby boulder. Her jeansnrolled up; she had grass all up and down her legs and on her feet. She wasnhiding her head in her hands. Jake came up and sat down beside her. He wasnsilent for a minute, unsure of how to approach her. \"I'm sorry Mel, Indidn't mean to make you upset,\" he said. She got up again and walked awaynfrom him, making her way down the road and past the car. \"Where are youngoing?\" he asked. She didn't answer. She walked down the road slowly,nheading for her house. Jake stood there and watched her walk away, untilnthe distance between their bodies was so great that he could no longer seenMelanie. Reality came back to him after she was gone. It occurred to him to follownMelanie, and he got in his truck and drove to her house.[Chapter 3] She walked up the steps to her house and slammed the screen door behindnher. Walking into her room, she put a duffel bag on her bed and stuffednclothes and important things she wanted to take with her into it. There was a knock at her door. \"Mel?\" asked the voice. It was her mom. \"YesnMomma?\" she asked. Her mom opened the door slightly and poked her head in.n\"Jake's here, he wants to see you,\" said Pearl. Melanie nodded. \"Tell himnto wait on the porch, I'll be right there,\" she said. Pearl shut the door,nleaving Melanie alone again. Melanie walked out the front door and onto thenporch to where Jake was waiting. He didn't notice that she was standing in the doorway looking at him. Shenstood in the way of the screen door, just watching Jake for a minute. Thendoor squeaked. He turned towards the door and realized that she was there.nShe opened the screen door and came out onto the porch. She slowly made hernway over to the porch swing and sat down beside Jake. They were both quiet for a few minutes, unsure of what to say about thensituation. \"When are you leaving?\" asked Jake, breaking the harrowingnsilence. \"Tomorrow,\" said Melanie. \"Do they know?\" asked Jake, referring tonWade, Bobby Ray, and Eldon. Melanie shook her head. \"They don't know thenreal reason, they just know I'm leaving,\" she said. \"I won't say anything,\"nsaid Jake. Melanie smiled a little. \"Can I call you in New York?\" he asked.nMelanie nodded. \"I'll call you when I get there,\" she said. \"I better go,\"nsaid Jake, starting to get up. Before he got up and left, he gave Melanie ankiss on the cheek. He looked at her for a minute after the kiss, and thennturned to leave. He walked slowly to his truck, as if he was going to turnnback. Melanie sat on the porch swing and watched Jake leave. Even after he wasngone, she sat there and daydreamed for a while. After a while, she couldn'tnremember why she was sitting there anymore, and got up to go back into thenhouse. She sat in her room, looking at her room and the things around her.nShe spent most of the night up, packing and putting things away. The next morning, she got up and ate breakfast, then made sure that she hadnall of her things together. She put the rest of her bags in the trunk ofnher car and closed it. Her parents were waiting by the car to say goodbye.nOver her mother's shoulders, she saw Bobby Ray's truck pull up in the dust.nBobby Ray, Wade, Eldon, and Jake got out of the car and came up to her. Shenlet go of her mother as the boys came up to her. \"Come have a milkshakenwith us,\" said Bobby Ray. Melanie shook her head. \"I can't, I have to go,\"nshe said. \"Please Mel,\" coaxed Jake. Pearl looked at her and nodded.nMelanie sighed and smiled a little. \"Just one,\" said Wade. \"Alright,\" saidnMelanie, giving in. They piled into Bobby Ray's truck and headed down tonthe diner. They sat down at a booth and waited for their milkshakes. While they satnand waited, the boys were silent though they thought they would havensomething to say to Melanie. But there were no words for them to say.nMelanie turned her head. She saw some of the girls from school sitting nearnthem were whispering and pointing at her. Their milkshakes came, and asnMelanie sipped hers she watched the girls as they pointed at her. Melaniensipped her milkshake quickly, then got up to leave. But before she couldnget up, Bobby Ray heard what the girls were saying about her. He was very upset and saw Melanie was about to cry but trying hard not to.nShe got up and walked out, waiting outside of the restaurant and cried.nBobby Ray got up after her and stood beside her. \"Please don't cry Mel,nthey're jerks,\" he said. She hid her face in her hands; she didn't want himnto see her crying. Jake, Wade, and Eldon came out of the restaurant just asnthe girls came out. As they began to talk again, Jake and Eldon stood up tonthem. Wade stood there, pretending to be involved though he wasn't reallynsure what to say for fear of making the situation worse. Melanie smiled at Jake. They got into Bobby Ray's truck and drove back tonher house. Melanie hugged everyone goodbye one last time before she got innthe car, driving away without looking back. She felt that if she lookednback she would want to go back so bad that she wouldn't be able to keepngoing. Hours passed, and the road just seemed to get longer and longer. The yellownlines seemed to never end. Melanie kept the radio on to keep her mind offnof Jake and Bobby Ray and memories of home, but it wasn't working verynwell. It had gotten dark by the time she reached New York, making it a littlenharder to get around since she had never been there. Since she had no placento live, she decided it best to stay in a hotel while she looked fornsomewhere decent. Since it was already late in the evening, she pulled intona nearby hotel and got a room. It was a small hotel, but nice. The woman atnthe reception desk was friendly to her. She handed Melanie her room key-ncard and she took her bags in the elevator with her. She fumbled around for the light in the dark room, then shut the doornbehind her. The room was nice, and she set her bags on the bed. As she putnher clothes in the armoire, she heard her cell phone ringing from inside ofnher purse. She walked back over to the bed and dug the phone out from thenbottom of her purse. \"Hello?\" she answered. \"Hey Mel,\" said the voice. Itnwas Bobby Ray.[Chapter 4] Melanie was afraid that Jake had spilled the beans about why she reallynwent to New York, and Bobby Ray was calling to ask her about it. \"How's NewnYork?\" he asked. \"Lonely,\" she said, lying down on the bed. \"I know why younleft Pigeon Creek,\" said Bobby Ray. Melanie sat up anxiously. \"Did Jakentell you?\" she screamed. Bobby Ray was silent for a moment. \"Yeah,\" henanswered. \"Damn it! He swore her wouldn't tell,\" she said. \"He was worriednabout you Mel,\" said Bobby Ray. Melanie began to cry. \"I'm so ashamed,\" shensaid. \"Don't worry, everything will work out,\" said Bobby Ray, though henhas a hard time making himself believe it was true. \"I don't know what I'mngonna do,\" said Melanie, trying to fight off tears. \"We'll help you Mel, wenpromise. Please come back to us, we miss you and we want to help,\" saidnBobby Ray coaxingly. \"I can't come back Bobby Ray, everyone will talk aboutnme. I will be the talk of the town,\" she said, tears cascading down herncheeks. \"Until.\" Bobby Ray stopped. \"I can't come back. I'm not comingnback,\" she said. Bobby Ray was quiet. \"I understand,\" he said, though hendesperately wanted to talk to her some more and try to get her to comenback. But he knew she wasn't going to listen, at least not now. \"I stillnneed to unpack and I'm really tired, so I'll talk to you later,\" saidnMelanie. \"Good night Bobby Ray,\" she said. Click. She set her phone on thennightstand next to the bed and pulled the covers down. She set her bags onnthe floor with the rest of her clothes in them and crawled into bed withoutneven changing her clothes. She shut the light off and pulled the coversnover her, crying herself to sleep and wondering what was going to happen. The next morning she woke up to the sound of her cell phone ringing on hernbedside table. \"Hello?\" she answered groggily. No one was there. \"Hello?\"nshe asked again. \"Ugh!\" she sighed and hung up. The pulled the covers downnand went to wash her face and change her clothes. She put her phone in hernpurse and went downstairs after she made sure she had her room key. She walked across the street and got a bagel instead of the hotel food, butnshe felt sick afterwards and ended up throwing up. She missed Jake andnBobby Ray and Eldon and Wade. She had no idea how she was going to make itnon her own. Melanie walked down the streets of New York city, looking for somewhere tonapply for a job. She saw a sign in the window of a clothing store callednNow, and went in to try and see if she could get a job there. When shenwalked in, there was a cute guy at the counter who caught her eye. \"Can Inhelp you?\" he asked, smiling at her. \"Hi, I.\" she stuttered and smilednshyly, embarrassed. \"I saw the sign in the window and I was wondering if Incould apply for a job,\" she said. He reached behind the counter and got anpiece of paper. \"What's your name?\" he asked, searching for a pen.n\"Melanie,\" she said. \"That's a pretty name,\" he said, smiling at her. \"Mynname's William,\" he said. \"Hi,\" she said, smiling back. \"Could I buy younlunch, and we could do the interview then?\" he asked hopefully. Melaniensmiled. \"That'd be great,\" she said. William came from around the counternand they waited outside for a cab. They stopped at a small deli near thenstore and sat down at a small table while they waited for the waitress.nAfter they gave their order, William began asking Melanie questions, thoughnshe got suspicious after a while when they didn't really have anything tondo with work, and they were more personal than job-related. \"Do you have nickname?\" he asked. She looked at him a little oddly. \"Well,nmy real name's Melanie but all my friends call me Mel,\" she answeredncasually. \"Okay Mel,\" he said. \"Yeah, my real name's William but I go bynWill,\" he said. After a brief silence he looked down at the papers again.n\"So.let's finish the interview,\" he said, and continued to ask hernquestions from the sheet, taking notes as he drank his Coke. They finishedntheir lunch and Will paid the bill. He followed Melanie out of thenrestaurant and they waited for a cab. \"Thank you for lunch,\" she said withna smile. \"We'll let you know about the job as soon as possible,\" he said.n\"Oh, I forgot to ask for your phone number so that I can reach you as soonnas I hear,\" he said. Melanie scribbled it on a piece of paper and handed itnto him as the cab pulled up to the curb. She got into it and Will watchednas it drove away. Six days later, Melanie was in her hotel room when she got a call on herncell phone. It was from Will. \"Hello?\" she answered; hopefully it was goodnnews. \"Hey Mel, it's Will,\" he said. \"Good news I hope?\" she asked. Willnlaughed. \"Yes, you got the job, you start Monday,\" he said. \"That's greatnthank you so much,\" she said. \"Listen,\" said Will, \"I had a really goodntime today with you. And I was wondering if you wanted to have dinnerntonight.\" \"That sounds great,\" said Melanie. \"Meet me at the Macaroni Grillnon Maple Blvd. at 7:15,\" he said. \"Okay I'll see you then,\" said Melanie.nClick. She was a little unsure about going out with Will, but he was nicenand she was lonely. Anything to take her mind off of Jake and Pigeon Creek. She waited inside the Macaroni Grill when she saw Will walk in. She stoodnup when he came to her. \"Hi,\" he said. \"Hi,\" she smiled. \"You looknbeautiful,\" he said. Melanie blushed slightly. \"Thank you,\" she said. Thenwaiter showed them to their seats and handed them the menus. The orderedntheir food and sat in silence for a few minutes after the waiter left thentable. Melanie sighed, she knew she had to tell him about the baby. But she didn'tnwant to just yet. While she was pondering, the waiter brought them theirnfood and refilled their glasses. \"Cheers,\" said Will, and they clinkednglasses. They finished their meal but didn't talk much. Will paid for thenmeal and they left. Standing outside of the restaurant, Will leaned innclose to her and put his arms around her. Then he whispered in her ear,n\"Can I kiss you?\" Melanie nodded, and Will leaned in to kiss her. It was annice soft kiss. He pulled away and looked at her. \"Want to go back to mynplace and watch a movie?\" he asked, though she knew he wasn't reallynthinking about watching a movie. Melanie nodded, and Will flagged a cabndown. Inside the cab, Will moved close to Melanie. Her hand was flat on the seatnnext to her leg. He put his hand over hers and then took it in his,nsqueezing it a little. They got to Will's apartment. Will paid the cabndriver and they got out. They walked up two flights of stairs and they werenat his door. Melanie stood at the door as he fished inside his pocket fornthe key. \"Found it!\" he laughed, and unlocked the door. He walked in andnflipped the lights on. It was a nice, roomy apartment. Will shut the doornand took Melanie's jacket off of her shoulders. She sat down on the couchnand he sat down next to her. She looked around the apartment, as Willnwatched her. He took her chin in his hand and turned it towards him,nplacing his lips to hers. He brought her body closer to hers and moved hisnhand down her body.[Chapter 5] Melanie felt his hand sliding down her side and pulled away from the kiss.n\"Stop!\" she said. Will backed away. \"I'm sorry,\" he said. She shook hernhead. \"There's something that I have to tell you. Something that I shouldnhave told you before,\" she said. \"I was going to tell you, I was, I justndidn't know how,\" she said. \"What is it?\" asked Will, looking at hernseriously. She took a deep breath. \"I'm pregnant with someone else's baby,\"nshe said. Will looked stunned. Melanie hid her face in her hands. Takingnanother deep breath, she looked at Will again. \"Thank you for dinner,\" shensaid. \"I think I'll just find another job,\" she said, standing up. Willndidn't say anything. She walked to the door and downstairs, shutting it asnshe left. ONE WEEK LATER Ring ring! Melanie reached for her phone on the bedside table. \"Hello?\" shenanswered. \"How's New York?\" asked the voice. \"Hi Bobby Ray,\" said Melanie.n\"How ya doing?\" he asked. Melanie sighed. \"Okay I guess,\" she said. \"Can'tnwait to see the.\" said Bobby Ray. \"There isn't one,\" Melanie interruptednhim. \"What?\" exclaimed Bobby Ray. \"There isn't one,\" Melanie repeated. \"I'mnsorry,\" said Bobby Ray. \"Don't be,\" said Melanie. \"So are you coming backnto Pigeon Creek?\" asked Bobby Ray. \"I don't know just yet,\" said Melanie.n\"I understand,\" said Bobby Ray. \"Please.please don't tell Jake,\" saidnMelanie. \"I won't,\" said Bobby Ray. \"Thanks,\" said Melanie. \"I'll call younagain soon,\" said Bobby Ray. \"Bye.\" \"Bye,\" said Melanie, hanging up thenphone. Melanie set the phone down on the table next to her and lay there in bed,nstaring up at the ceiling. She wasn't really sure what to do. If she wentnback to Pigeon Creek, she could see all of her friends and family again.nBut they would be asking what had happened to her, and she didn't reallynwant to talk about it. In all truth, she was relieved. She thought that ifnsomething happened, which she had never expected, she would be sad andnunhappy. Although she was sad, in a way, she felt relieved. She lay in bed,nthinking and wondering about what she should do until she fell asleep. The next morning, a knock at the door startled her awake. \"Just a second,\"nshe said, getting out of bed and walking to the door. It didn't occur tonher to see who it was through the peephole, she just unlocked and openednthe door. She was startled when she saw who was standing there. \"Jake!\" shenexclaimed, stunned at him standing there and how horrible she must looknfrom having just woken up. \"Jake.Jake.what are you doing here?\" shenstammered. \"Can I come in? Can we just sit down and talk?\" asked Jake.nMelanie nodded and Jake came into the room. Melanie shut and bolted thendoor behind her. Jake walked over to the bed and sat down, and she sat downnbeside him. \"Why are you here Jake?\" she asked. \"I couldn't let you leave,\" he said.n\"But I've been gone for weeks,\" she said. \"I know, but I was too afraid tonface you, I couldn't let you leave but couldn't go after you either,\" hensaid. \"But this will be an adventure,\" he said, putting his hand on hernstomach. Melanie pushed his hand away and turned away from him. \"MothernNature has other plans for us,\" she said. \"What?\" asked Jake. \"It's gone,\"nshe said, falling silent. \"At first I was sad,\" she said, beginning to cry,n\"and then I realized.I felt relieved.but I was too ashamed to admit it,\"nshe said. There was a knock at the door. Melanie, drying her eyes, got upnfrom the bed and went to answer it. She opened it slightly to see it who itnwas and she was taken by surprise again. It was Will.[Chapter 6] \"Hi,\" said Will, still standing outside of the door. Jake wasn't aware thatnWill was standing there. \"Hi,\" said Melanie, panicking a little. \"Can wentalk?\" asked Will. \"Uhh, right now's really not a.good time,\" she said. Butnit was too late. Jake and Will had already seen each other. \"Hi, I'm Will,\"nsaid Will, reaching out his hand and introducing himself to Jake. \"Jake,\"nsaid Jake, reaching out his hand to meet Will's. They shook hands and satndown. Melanie sat down next to Jake on the bed. Will sat across from them in anchair. The room was silent; the tension mounting. \"So.\" said Will, breakingnthe silence. \"I should.probably go,\" he said, getting up. Melanie got upnafter him to let him out. He walked to the door, but turned back to kissnher. He wrapped his arms around her and held her tightly. This was too muchnfor Jake. He stood up and took Melanie from Will's grip. Taking her in hisnarms, he wrapped her in his arms tightly and kissed her. \"I think you neednto go,\" said Melanie to Will, after kissing Jake. Will nodded and left thenroom without another word. Melanie locked the door behind him and lookednback at Jake. \"He's just this guy that I met that offered me a job. It's over,\" shensaid. Jake nodded, but Melanie knew he didn't believe her. She came overnand sat down next to him. She took his hand into hers and held it tightly.n\"I'm sorry Jake,\" she said. \"I never meant to hurt you, or anyone else fornthat matter,\" she said. Jake turned to look at her. Melanie stared back atnhim. \"Jake, I can't do this,\" she said, getting up. \"I know,\" he said.n\"Hey.\" He grabbed her hand and she turned back towards him. He stood up tonmeet her. Melanie placed her hand around his head and ran her fingersnthrough his hair. He leaned in and kissed her. She wrapped her other hand around his head and let herself give into hisnwarm touch. She let her lips part from his and got up on the bed, keepingnher eyes fixed on his.

As you might know, my stories can get a bit creepy. Considering this is a belated Halloween fic, this is no exception and may be worse. Sorry I couldn't get this done on Halloween, since I was taking my kids trick-or-treating. I'm sure you don't want to hear about that, so on with the story. I don't own the characters and their names are just their actors' names, sorry I was tired and not very creative.] Halloween. It is the only night a year when the portal is left open and the Lost Children are free from the curse. It is the only night they aren't cursed with a Killing Spell. Granted, they are still lost. They can be seen, but their faces remain distorted, like the skip of a photo reel. Their voices are garbled, too meshed for the living to hear. Still, it is 2013 and Ashley's first time at a Lost Halloween. The six children slowly step out of their gray comfort zone and through a portal of a toddler's closet. Mr. Boogie terrorizes the children young enough to be in bed by now. The six children easily leave the house and advance onto the neighborhood. They ask for candy through moaning, thrusting open stained pillowcases from massacres long ago. Ashley calls out trick-or-treat and is upset when someone chides them for not calling it. She has a lot to learn about being a Lost Child. They quietly retreat to the shadows after scoring a bit of candy from several houses. They lay the pillowcases down flat as they empty the candy between them. Ashley is about to open her candy bar when a teenage boy and his friend saunter to the group and snatches it out of her hand. The other five glare at him, turning their heads simultaneously. Stephanie pulls out a rope, while Cameron strikes a match and Blake pulls out a knife. The teenagers scream at the sight, but Danielle and Ethan , the other children, quickly hold them down. Though no longer governed by Bughuul for the night, the Lost Children have been torturing souls in the gray zone for nearly a year. Some mortals deserve to be punished before they die. These boys are no exception. The friend is eagerly thrown into an underground pool, with Ethan, the \"Pool Party Boy\" holding his head down. The other boy deserves something more personal. Stephanie \"Just Hanging Around\" offers a lynching, while Blake, the \"Sleepy Time Boy\" would rather simply slit his throat. Danielle, the \"Lawn Work Girl\" would be delighted to let a neighbor's lawnmower do the trick. Cameron, the \"BBQ Boy\" is more than willing to lock him in a car and set it on fire. Ashley pulls out an axe the others hadn't seen her grab, ordering Ethan to let up on the friend and asking the others to hold down the main teen. \"Think you can keep a secret?\" She garbles toward him. He screams more and she thrusts a partially melted candy bar into his mouth to shut him up. Ashley smiles bitterly, her face quickly becoming clear to the boy but dissolving just as fast. She raises the axe, noticing the other out of the corner of her eye, as she brings it down. The friend cannot help but scream. \"You killed my friend! You creepy kids! You, you freaks!\" Ashley's joking smile drops immediately. The first teen sits up, massaging his arm where the axe had come down. Ashley shows off the retractable blade. Then, in a flash, she is beside the nearly drowned boy. He sneers at her out of fear, spite and anger. \"Cruel joke, Kid. You're all nothing but a bunch of lousy freaks.\" \"Don't call me that!\" Though booming where her friends can hear, it emits like a soft squeak for the teen beside her. \"Why don't you cry home to your Mommy?\" The boy taunts. \"You're nothing but a loser. An empty-headed freak.\" She loses control, screeching at him. Everyone can hear her and she fishes out a different axe. This one has blood stains on it from her last torturing. She raises it with malice. \"Don't call me that! I! Am not! A freak!\" At each punctuation, she lowers the blade. She lops off his limbs one-by-one. He is struggling to cry as blood merges out. It gurgles in his throat and she scoffs, kicking him bacl into the pool to drown. At once, the real weapon is gone and Ashley is back at the main teen's side. With a nod from her, he is released, only for her to grab the collar of his shirt and bring him in very close. \"See you in your nightmares.\" She lets go and the teenager tears down the street. The Lost Children walk back to their pillowcases, slightly dismayed that more candy is missing. They shrugs and grab a miniature candy bar and a sucker each. They finish the bars in record time and pop the suckers into their mouths. They can feel the gray surrounding them and they know the portal is closing. The children find the original house with the portal hidden in the closet. One-by-one, their Halloween is done. Mr. Boogie's work is done for the night. Their Halloween fun ends and the six Lost Children are back under Bughul's control, wandering around searching for deserving souls to torture. ","Summary":" [Hello.

Yet here I was driving down the quaint little neighborhood headed right towards it. Why...because after all these years I had been left with so many unanswered questions. Why did my sister, Ashley murder my parents and almost kill happened to her was she still alive? This all started sixteen years ago, when my dad a true crime novelist moved us into a home where a murder had occurred. A entire family hung from a tree in the backyard, and a little girl missing. My dad was obsessed with the idea of writing this novel, solving the murder, in his words finding justice for the family. His days were spent locked up in his office watching old super 8 films, drinking whiskey and scribbling notes down on notepads. Being a small town word had spread fast of our family and where we had moved into. Didn't make it very easy for me I was constantly bullied by the other kids and always in trouble with the principle. My nights were spent plagued with nightmares were I myself would witness the murder of the family. A family of three being hung from the tree one by one till they were lifeless and the twitching stopped. Sometimes there was a little girl in it at times watching other times pulling the rope that would eventually kill them. I would wake up screaming hysterically, in unusual places. Once my dad found me in one of the moving boxes and another time I was standing alone in the backyard in the middle of the night. How I ended up there the two times I don't know. I wanted to leave but I was just a nine year old boy and didn't have a say in the matter. This obsession of writing this novel caused problems with my parents especially when my mom had found out we were living in the actually place where the murder had occurred. My dad had not been completely honest with her about that and in the same time she really didn't want to know We only stayed there for a short time, something freaked him out that he gathered us up and left in the middle of the night. We ended up moving to a small town in Pennsylvania into a two story brick house . We were starting the routine all over again, moving in making a new start except this time there was a slight difference. Dad had dropped the whole idea of writing the novel he was going to do something different. I thought at last we could be a family again...but I was wrong. That very first night we moved into the house was our last. I had been in my room listening to my mp3 when i heard a shrill scream. I pulled off the headphones and went to see what was going on. When I walked down the hallway I saw blood all over the walls. Fear hit me I was afraid to go forward but needed to see the scream was about. \"Mom...dad\" I called out\" are you ok?\" There was no answer and I knew something was definitely not right. I walked forward slowly and as I reached my parents room my whole body froze. My sister, just 6 at the time was standing over my mom's body bring the ax down on my mom over and over again. Blood splattering over her and everything else in the room. When she saw me, stopped and I didn't recognize my sister. Her eyes were vacant, she looked evil, her mouth was contoured in a evil snarl. \"Ashie\" My sister didn't answered and stormed towards me with a rage I never knew existed in her. I ran slipping on the blood as I did, somehow managed to get away. I ran down the stairway to my dad's study. He laid on the floor a bloodied mess hacked up into pieces and I fell to the floor. I felt like I was in a nightmare, like those that had plagued me when we moved into the first house. I heard a creak on the floor and turned around to see my sister standing there with a bat in her hand. I wondered what had happened to the ax. \"Ashie please...please don't do this?\" The same blank look on her face, she stepped forward raising the bat over her head. I raise my arms to protect myself but it did little use against the blows over and over again. I feel to the floor, something wet running down my face and neck something wet and sticky. I tasted it in my mouth a odd metallically that I recognized as my own blood. Everything went black and my body went still. I reached over to grab the paper with the directions on it, Cremlin Street was coming up and took a right turn going straight down the street. As soon as I saw the house a flood of memories came back and felt stick to my stomach.

Had he insisted more, had he pushed more, none of this would be happening. Progress had been slow but he'd been forgiven since it was still progress. Zach's attack on Dylan had changed everything for the worse. Dylan was following through on his refusals to watch the videos. This was making everyone, Milo included, uneasy. It never took this long for the ritual to happen. Hurry up , a hollow hiss rang out. Milo stiffened in terror. \"Of course, Bughuul,\" he choked out. It seemed like Zach was going to have to take Dylan's place, much to Milo's disgust. \"Get up,\" he snapped. When Zach didn't move, Milo sneered at the boy. He pushed the boy out of the bed. \"I said get up.\" Zach sat up and glared at his unwanted visitor. \"What do you want?\" He asked angrily. \"Here to push me down the stair for hurting your little toy?\" Milo clenched his teeth at the blatant insult. Whether it was at him or Dylan he didn't care. \"I will if you don't hurry to the cellar,\" he replied tersely. \"You have some videos to watch.\" Before Zach could say anything else, Milo disappeared. He let out an exasperated groan as he pulled himself back onto the bed. \"He will push you down the stairs you know,\" Catherine said. Zach to keep himself from jumping in surprise. \"What,\" he said dumbly. \"If you don't go, he'll force you down. He's really impatient you know,\" she continued. \"He also doesn't like you. You should be happy he was forced to make the switch.\" Zach rolled his eyes and got up. \"I hate you all,\" he grumbled walking past her. She idly laughed as she followed him down to the cellar. This was going to be fun. Dylan gave up on trying to sleep for the night. His body still ached from when Zach had hurt him. He rolled over to see Milo standing by his bed staring out the window. Dylan was surprised to see him there. He hadn't expected Milo to show up again. Not after the previous night's refusal to watch the videos. \"There's still time, you know,\" Milo finally said. Dylan merely watched him curiously. It wasn't often that Milo spoke to him without facing him. \"Your brother had three left, but if you go now, he'll be forced to step back and let you finish the one you have left.\" \"I already told you,\" Dylan replied sitting up. \"I don't want to watch those movies anymore.\" Milo expression became strained for a second before returning to normal. It was so quick that Dylan was sure he imagined it. \"Please,\" Milo whispered. Dylan was shocked at what he was seeing. The usual smugness that Milo wore was gone; replaced by regret and sadness. \"You can still reclaim your right even if Zach watches them all. Since you were my- our first choice, he'll be forced to step back. You can survive!\" Milo continued. \"Milo, what are you talking about?\" Dylan asked worried. He's never seen Milo so uncontrolled like that. If something was worrying Milo, that meant it was serious. \"Survive what?\" \"When he finished watching them, he'll do anything to make sure you all leave this house,\" Milo said. \"And when you do, he'll kill you.\" Dylan took a shuddered breath. Zach would never do that. Sure Zach was mean to him a lot, but he'd never go so far as to kill his brother. Right? \"A-and if I watch them?\" He whispered, voice laced with fear. \"Then you can be safe! You can get revenge for all the wrong that's been done to you,\" Milo insisted. \"You can get revenge on your brother for constantly treating you like dirt. You can get revenge on your mother for watching and doing nothing as your father constantly beat you. You can finally get revenge on your father for all the pain he's put you through!\" He grabbed on to Dylan's shoulders. \"You can finally be safe with us.\" Dylan never realized until then how truly cold Milo's hands were. He reached up and grabbed Milo's hands. \"I'm sorry,\" he said removing them from his shoulders. \"I'm not strong enough.\" Milo pulled his hands from Dylan's grasp with a look of hurt clear on his face. \"Just,\" he said trying to regain his composure. \"Don't leave. Don't change houses. If you don't leave, he'll be forced to take retribution on Zach.\" Dylan frowned at how strained Milo's voice was, how hurt he looked. \"Just don't leave,\" he repeated before disappearing.

Nothing but heavy breathing could be heard. Shivering from fear sat the little girl, pushing herself against the cold wall behind her. Hoping for her parents, her big brother or anyone else to come and rescue her. \"Bam…bam…bam…!\" loud footsteps could be heard, coming nearer and nearer up the stairs. She held her breath although her lungs have long been screaming for air. In her hurry she hadn'd been able to close the door entirely so a small shaft of light made its way in the minor storeroom. A giant shadow let the light disappear for a few seconds. She started wimpering again. Oh how often had she already done that that day? She hoped, prayed that he or better it wouldn't find her. Luckily it went on, the footsteps getting more quiet each second that passed. It's quite funny. Every person with at least a whiff of intelligence would have looked into something like a storeroom if he was searching for a little girl that hided herself. Well no one said that scary, big men are smart, right? Quietly, she debated with herself wether she should take the chance of the best being away and run or staying and keeping on waiting. When she made her choice she sneaked out of the room, creeped down the stairs and ran out of the house to the street. She laughed, her sweet petite lips curving up. She started jumping around like a drunken kangaroo. Every reasonable person would have run to the police and reported every oh so little detail about intruder but for a little girl she was just able to enjoy her victory and squeal in delight. After a while she got tired from her victory dance and sat on the green soft grass of her garden, savoring the cold breeze of the autumn night. She saw the car of her parents turn into their street. She happily waved at them. Lost in her thoughts she didn't realize the scrubby creature behind her, tickling her small ear with its harsh breath. Chills ran down her spine, she felt something cold touch her back, patting it slightly. And then she heard a voice, a loud, brutal voice. If someone would have asked the little girl how it sounded she would had answered the voice of the devil himself. \"Happy Halloween!\" Yay! My first story! So excited!

You know who are-quasi una fantasia. Sorry, I coughed. EDIT: So, here 's the predicted re-write of this. I knew it was coming, but I had a bit of free time and when I looked back at this story, I cringed. I was not proud of this. Now I am (sorta). Enjoy. The room was silent, as Ellison sat at his desk, head in his hands. This was fucked up; he couldn't do this. All the films, all the children; it was getting to him. He gave a bitter laugh, rubbing his eyes. Maybe his wife was right, maybe he was chasing a pipe dream at this point. The obnoxious Brinnng of the phone echoed through the quiet room, bouncing down the hall. Ellison raised his head slightly, bleary eyes peering at the device. He knew it was Deputy so-and-so; he had been ignoring the calls, too wrapped up in his own grief. This was the third time that the phone had rang. Ellison gave the guy props; he certainly was persistant. Maybe it was important. Looking down the hall, Ellison sighed. He had best answer it before he woke his family up to leave; after all he had put them through, he owed them that much. He picked up the phone, voice dull and choked. He was having a hard time breathing— panic attack, a little voice in his head murmured—as he held the mobile to his ear. \"Yeah?\" He just wanted it to be over; as soon as this phone call was over he would take his family and leave. This hell he had put his family through was going to end, and he would take them home. He would get a real job, a job his family could be proud of. It wasn't meant to be, though. \"Oh thank God you picked up! I found out something; something big-huge, even!\" Rustling from the other side of the phone, the deputy sifting through papers on his desk. Ellison stood from his desk, and walked down the hall. Standing in the doorway to his room, he leaned against the door frame, watching his sleeping wife. \"Yeah? Keep it; I'm done with the book. I'm just done. I'm taking my family and we are moving back. I can't do this anymore, deputy.\" Ellison's voice was muted, as he watched his wife sleep peacefully. He pulled the phone from his ear, ready to end the call. The faint response he heard from the phone stopped him. \"No, that's just it! Every family has lived in the house where the previous murder occurred! They died after they moved out of that house. You can't leave! That's the pattern! That's the MO! \" He couldn't breathe, his hand clutching the frame to keep him upright. No. \"What?\" Ellison's voice was quiet, disbelief filling his tone. His legs gave out, and he slid to the ground in the door way. The room was blurry. Ellison rubbed his eyes, forcing back the tears. This couldn't be happening; none of this could be happening. No. \"There were reports of stuff before the families moved, but that was just it. Stuff! As soon as they moved, they died. Uh, what this means is you can't leave. The house. Well, I mean, you can leave but you just can't… you know, LEAVE.\" Ellison was quiet, his throat sealed and his eyes blinded. This couldn't be happening, not now, not when he was finally going to try and set things right. He could faintly hear the deputy's voice from the phone, as he sat there on the floor. \"…Thanks, Deputy.\" Ellison hung up, ignoring the protests from the other side. He stumbled to his feet, staggering back into his study. Shutting the door, he slid down the wall. Ellison tried to stifle the sounds of his sobs, desperate not to wake his family. God, what a fool he had been. Blinded by his previous successes and failures, he put his family into death's hands. But what could he do? Could he even fight against Bughuul? No, Ellison realized, his sobs shaking his frame. He couldn't. . 8/11/13 Mr. Boogie isn't happy. The deputy that Daddy had been talking to made Daddy not move, which means Mr. Boogie won't be able to help me help Daddy! I wanted to help Daddy so much it hurt, but now I can't. Stupid deputy. . 8/16/13 Mr. Boogie calmed down finally. I know because the walls aren't rotting anymore in the attic. I wonder if that means Mr. Boogie will come see me again? I miss him; he was nice. . 8/18/13 Mr. Boogie told me that I could still help Daddy, but that it would take longer. He told me what I would have to do. I'll do it, for Daddy. I'll make Daddy famous again, just like he wanted. . 9/14/13 It's taking a little while to set up Mommy's death; I have to make her leave Daddy. It makes me sad, but this is better for both of them, or at least that's what Mr. Boogie says. Mommy was sitting in the living room, head in her hands. I knew she was crying, but I couldn't do anything about it until later. Then I would make her happy; Mr. Boogie promised me! . 9/16/13 Trevor went to bed early today. He was upset with us moving away from Daddy. He had screamed at Mommy when she had mentioned something called 'divorce papers'. I don't know what they were, but Mommy said it would make sure that her and Daddy weren't together anymore. As sad as that made me, I knew it had to be this way. Mr. Boogie told me so. . 10/29/13 Mommy took us back to the old house. Daddy and her got into a big fight, and he stayed back at Mr. Boogie's house. Now our house is Mr. Boogie's too! Mommy was sitting in the living room. She sat up when I came in. \"Hey honey. I'm going to go take a shower and then I can tuck you in, ok?\" I nodded, and Mommy gave me a trembly smile. I waited until I could hear water running, like Mr. Boogie told me to. I pulled out the camera Mr. Boogie gave me. I made sure it was working, and went to the kitchen. I pulled out one of the knives that Mommy had in there; Mr. Boogie said it would work the best with the film. Opening the door to the bathroom, I walked inside quietly. I didn't want to mess this up, not after all the work Mr. Boogie and I had done to get here. Pulling the camera level with my shoulder, I yanked the shower curtain back. Before Mommy could turn around, I shoved my knife into her neck. The arc of her blood just missed the camera, missing me by almost nothing. I was a bit sad I couldn't make it prettier, but Mr. Boogie said it would look great anyways. I hope so. . 11/1/13 The police who came thought someone had broken into the house, as Mr. Boogie broke the sliding glass door. He was smart like that. Mr. Boogie said I couldn't tell them it was me, as they wouldn't understand. Like how the deputy didn't understand. I don't think I like police. . 11/13/13 I got Trevor today; he was pretty easy. The men in suits put me and Trevor in a \"foster home\" with a bunch of other kids. Now that house is Mr. Boogie's too! He has so many houses now. He says that it will make it easier for him to help other kids like me and Stephanie and the others; I'm glad. At the new house some of the other boys were pretty mean to me and Trevor, picking on us. Mr. Boogie said they were bad. It was easy to make it look like one of them had done it. Trevor put up a bit of a fight, so I had to beat him to death with one of the boys' baseball bats; it made him really squishy. I took a little of him to paint with; it was a really pretty red! It didn't really show up that well on the camera, which made me a little bit sad. Mr. Boogie said it didn't matter though. . 12/20/13 After Trevor died, Daddy came and took me back. He said he had 'won custody of me', whatever that means. Mr. Boogie said it meant that he had to fight for me against the men in suits. Daddy was so sweet! I'll make sure his is he most spectacular of them all; he deserved it for being so nice. . 12/25/13 I drugged his drink, like me and Mr. Boogie had originally planned. I filmed his death with what Mr. Boogie told me were 'dramatic angles'. I cut off his head with an axe; it made a really pretty spray across the walls, like rainbows. I made sure to film how his head rippled in the fire for Mr. Boogie; he said it was really nice. I wasn't done though; Mr. Boogie was mad about what that deputy had done. He really was mad that he messed it all up. The deputy had a family now too; Mr. Boogie said it was alright because he messed it up first. Mr. Boogie told me to film it; that he would put it in the extended endings area. That made me happy. More happy than when I fed him and his kids to his dogs. His wife I stuck in the oven. . 12/30/13 Mr. Boogie told me I did great, and that he loved the picture I made of everyone I killed for him. I used Trevor for the red; it made it that much more special. ","Summary":" This AU story is inspired by a reviewer. You know who are-quasi una fantasia. Sorry, I coughed.

Devious Dizziness overcame him and things were starting to go black. He heard his daughter's voice, but couldn't really make out much of what she was saying. He knew she said something about the films and he knew that she had put something into his drink to make him fall asleep. He had pieced it all together. The kids were the ones who murdered their families. And now…it was happening to his family. The room spun, darkness took over, and he was out like a light. The last thing he saw before he completely went out was his daughter's cold and indifferent… sinister face. When his eyes opened again, he was met with the horrifying sight of his daughter walking towards him while dragging an axe and carrying a camera. She was filming this. She was going to film her work. The whole family was there in front of the fireplace, gagged and tied up. Wrists were tied and ankles were tied. There was nowhere they could go. They were trapped. They would be awake when it happened. His own daughter was going to chop them up into little pieces with her axe. They were going to suffer before they died. They were going to die very slowly . Ellison watched as his daughter situated the camera in front of his head, putting it on him first. He was first . She was going to kill him first. Why was this happening? Why? Why ? Ashley stared at him with that emotionless look on her face, raising the axe above her head. Oh God , she was going to chop off his head first. Ellison looked up at her with pleading eyes, begging her no to do it, desperately trying to communicate with her through eye contact. The only response she gave him was an even more devious look. She brought down the axe. Reacting, Ellison rolled out of the way just in time. The axe slammed into the floor, getting stuck in there. That didn't deter the girl, however, for she jerked the axe out of the wooden floor and advanced upon him again. The camera was still rolling. Ellison wanted to holler, he wanted to plead with his daughter. He couldn't speak though, he was still gagged. Ashley came at him again, swinging the axe at his head once more, that devious expression still present on her facial features. The male rolled out of the way again, but Ashley quickly came with another swing, learning from last time. Ellison rolled the other way and she repeated her actions. Finally, he managed to roll into her legs and knocked her off of her feet. The axe flew out of her hand and sprawled across the ground. Acting quickly, the parent rushed over to the fireplace and found a sharp part of it, hurriedly cutting his wrists free and then using his hands to remove the binds on his ankles. Through with that, he tugged the gag out of his mouth and threw it to the floor. Right when he did that, his daughter was upon him again. Silent and deadly, she swung the axe at his stomach this time. Ellison backed up further into the fireplace, almost collapsing into the fire that was burning in there. Luckily, he avoided the harsh swing from the female. \"Ashley!\" Ellison yelled, his voice hoarse and broken. \"Think about what you're doing! Think about what's going to happen if you do this!\" Ashley wasn't listening to him anymore. That same emotionless expression was still present on her face and she was determined to end his life as well as her mother's and her brother's. Ellison ducked as she went for his head. Once the girl had completed her action, Ellison wasted no time in tackling her to the ground. The child didn't even make a sound as her father crushed her against the floor. All she did was struggle to decapitate him with her axe. It was as if she was an automatic robot, she was like a terminator. \"Ashley, listen to me!\" Ellison begged, pulling the axe out of her small hand and throwing it far away. Next, he pinned her wrists to the ground above her head, keeping her there. The girl struggled violently with tremendous strength Ellison knew she did not possess before. Suddenly, the girl bit into his arm and he hissed in pain, releasing her. Ashley scrambled out from beneath him and jumped to her feet, rapidly going back for her axe. Still , the camera was rolling. Ellison let her go get the axe, knowing he couldn't stop her in time. He rushed to his wife and his son, getting them out of their binds and removing their gags. Tracy was sobbing uncontrollably and blubbering incoherent words while Trevor was staring straight ahead as if he had seen a ghost. \"Tracy! Tracy, listen to me,\" Ellison quickly spat out, grabbing his wife's face with his hands. \"You're going to call the police and you're going to take Trevor outside. Do you hear me? Do you understand me?\" Through her tears, Tracy numbly nodded. Ellison let go of her face and she grabbed Trevor's hand, pulling him out of the room. Ellison watched them go and turned around to see his daughter sauntering toward him while dragging the axe behind her, her expression remaining the same. There was something terrifyingly different though. She wasn't alone . Whole body becoming numb with fear, Ellison could see it standing behind her, staring at him. It was Bughuul…it was Mr. Boogie. Ellison stumbled back, bumping into furniture and releasing a strangled, unrecognizable noise of horror. Too paralyzed with fear, Ellison tripped over a piece of low furniture and tumbled to the ground, breathing heavily. Ashley was upon him, her axe at the ready. A horrible yell ripped through Ellison's throat and tore out of his mouth, wanting his daughter to listen to him, wishing his daughter would hear him. The axe came down. It pierced him. Ellison looked down at his thigh, seeing the axe embedded into it, blood squirting out immediately. The agony came and he hollered hysterically. Lifting his gaze as his howls of pain continued, he could see Mr. Boogie holding the camera and filming every second of it. \"ASHLEY, PLEASE!\" Ellison yowled crazily, trying to get away with his wounded leg and hoping to God that his wife called the police and that they were safe. Ashley said nothing as she yanked the axe out of his thigh. Still appearing very devious, the child swung the axe into his other thigh, blood splattering everywhere and onto her face and clothes. Ellison howled and cried in pure agony. Things were going black…he was losing too much blood. The last thing Ellison saw was Ashley going in for another swing with her axe and Mr. Boogie catching it all on film. [….] He opened his eyes. Where was he? He was in a room. It was white. He was lying on a mattress on his back, a blanket covering his body. He was in a hospital… \"Ellison?\" That was his wife's voice. \"Dad?\" That was his son's voice. But how? Didn't he die? Didn't his own daughter kill him while Mr. Boogie filmed it all? How was he still alive? Tracy grasped his hand tightly in her own, squeezing it as hard as she could. \"Ellison, you're awake. I thought…we thought…\" she broke down into tears. \"Dad…\" Trevor whispered, face pale and eyes wide. \"You're…dad…\" \"Son,\" Ellison whispered, his voice dry and hoarse. He felt weak. \"What happened? What's going on?\" Tracy frowned at him through her tears. \"You don't remember?\" she questioned him. \"No, I don't,\" Ellison responded quickly, sitting up slightly. \"Somebody tell me what's going on.\" Tracy slowly released his hand, placing a hand onto his chest and breathing out a shuddery breath. \"The police arrived right before Ashley could…could…\" \"The police arrived before Ashley could kill you, dad,\" Trevor finished for his mother, his voice emotionless. His face was still pale and his eyes were very wide. \"She almost did too. She almost did. Ashley went crazy, dad. She lost it.\" Ellison wanted to explain that it wasn't her fault. \"Trevor-\" \"No!\" Trevor shouted. \"No! She was going to kill us all!\" Ellison was silent for a moment before asking, \"Where is she?\" \"We don't know.\" \"What? What do you mean you don't know?\" Ellison demanded to know, panic evident on his facial features. \"Where could she possibly have gone?!\" Tracy swallowed hard. \"She disappeared , Ellison.\" \"It's true…\" Trevor mumbled from beside her, looking very uncomfortable. \"Well, where's Mr. Boogie, where's Bughuul?!\" \"What?\" Tracy and Trevor looked confused. Ellison swallowed thickly. \"The man…the man that was with Ashley.\" \"There was no man, Ellison.\" Ellison stared at them. ","Summary":" Author's Note: What if...

The family wasn't doing so well back in Gary, Indiana with Sam, the husband and father of the family, losing his job along with losing a daughter to suicide. But then he got a job offer that required him to relocated to a suburban town. \"So what do you think?\" Sam asks his wife. The red haired woman looks over to her husband. \"I seen the house before, Sam. Not like I'm seeing it for the first time.\" The married couple's oldest son, AJ, steps out of the SUV with a large box in his hand. \"Better than Gary, I'll say.\" he snorted. \"Not a piece of shit.\" Charlene slap her son on the head. \"Aiden James, watch your mouth.\" \"Mom, you're gonna make me drop the boxes.\" AJ complains trying to stop the boxes from dropping from his grip. \"But you know better. I don't care if you are 20 years old.\" She scowls, going to unlock the door to the new house. Sam shook his head. He looks back inside the van. In the back seat was the couple's other two children: 16 year old Cassidy and 11 year old Zoe. The youngest daughter was eager to see what the new house look like as she fumbles with her seat belt. \"Let me help.\" offers Sam. \"Daddy I can do it.\" she said to him, finally freeing herself. \"Ok,\" Sam chuckles. His smiles fades seeing his oldest daughter's expressionless face. Ever since her twin committed suicide, it was like a part of her died. Sam and Charlene took her to see a therapist but it wasn't much help. Cassidy rarely talks anymore, just only when spoken directly to. \"Cass?\" Cassidy looks up from her sketchbook to look at her father. \"Yeah?\" she said in a low voice. He clears his throat. \"What do you think of the new house?\" She turns to examine it from inside the car. \"It's…okay. I guess.\" She shrugs. Sam frowns. \"C'mon, kiddo. I'm sure you'll grow to like it.\" \"If you say so.\" \"I promise.\" said Sam. \"Come help your brother with those other boxes.\" Cassidy nods as she steps out of the car. As soon as everyone manage to get all of their stuff inside the house, they was amazed of how huge and cozy it was inside. It had three bathrooms, three bedrooms, an office space, decent size kitchen that was connected to the dining room, a basement and a attic. \"I guess Cass and Zoe will be rooming together.\" said AJ, as he settled into the one of the bedrooms. \"I hope you don't mind Cass,\" said Charlene. She only shook her head. \"It's fine really.\" The older woman signs at her daughter. \"Alright.\" She lets Cassidy and Zoe take their boxes into their room. Sam had wraps his arms around his wife's waist. \"Maybe she just needs a new start.\" \"Do you tell yourself that to feel better about Charlie?\" She questions. \"I'm worried about her. Sometimes it's like I lost her too.\" Sam buries his face into her hair. \"It's been hard. I'm gonna put some of the stuff in the attic.\" \"Why not the basement?\" \"Basements flood honey.\" Sam said simply, going to the car to get the rest of the stuff. When Sam went up into the attic, he noticed how it was strangely so clean of dust and spider webs. \"They really cleaned up this attic.\" he mumbles to himself. Sam was setting some boxes in the corner as he came across one labeled 'Baby photos'. He opens them up, smiling to himself. There were pictures of AJ, Cassidy, Charlie and Zoe when they were babies. He even found a couple ultra sound photos of when Charlene was pregnant with Cassidy and Charlie. He sadly places it back in the box and moves onto the next one. \"I thought I labeled all the boxes.\" Sam said to himself as he saw one that was blank of any writing. He opens it to see a Super 8 camera and some film canisters. Sam didn't know where the box came from or how it even got there. He looks over the film canisters and noticed they were labeled in chronological order. \"Pool Party (1966), BBQ (1979), Lawn Work (1986), Sleepy Time (1998),\" Sam reads in a low voice. He wonders if this from a previous family who live here and somehow forgotten about it. He found it strangle how this stuff just magically appears out of now where. He looks over the last two films: one was labeled 'Family Hangout' (2011) and the last was labeled 'House Painting' (2012). \"2012?\" he whispers. \"That's not even six months ago.\" This made him have a strangle uneasy filling. He was curious to know what was on this films. Once he managed to set up the super 8 camera he decides to play the one labeled 'Lawn Work'. The film was shot in the dark and it appears to be raining. Sam moves closer to get a better look. It looks like a lawn mower that was running on its on in a front lawn. He shook his head. It was just some useless film of someone mowing the lawn in the dark. \"Sam I need you!\" Charlene calls from downstairs. He turns away from the film, unaware that the useless film wasn't so useless as it showed a quick glimpse of a teenage girl, tied down on the ground as she was run down by the lawn mower. \"Coming!\" Sam calls, turning back to turn off the Super 8 camera. He leaves the attic, unaware of the evil presence that was once again lurking in the shadows. AN-In case you're wondering about the chant I found it online. It's going be used by Cassidy a lot as she knows something wrong about the house.

The never ending roller coaster of waves shake the loose pile of sticks and bamboo that is held together by rolls of ancient film from VHS tapes. Wilson clings to the side, sitting in a nest of leftover rope and hefty wood. Chuck whimpers, his sunken in eyes gaze upon the angry ocean. Slowly losing hope, he curls up and forces his eyes shut in an attempt to sleep. /p p class=\"MsoNormal\"Chuck is awakened by a small sprinkle. A splash too delicate to be made by any living thing. He stumbles awake and sees his companion drifting off in the distance. Chuck opens his parched mouth and somehow forces out a nearly inaudible call for his best friend. He then plummets into the violent waters. His weak bones protrude from his already skinny body. Water pulls at his flabby arms while he attempts to swim. Wilson drifts farther and farther, tears trickle down chuck's red cheeks. Chuck knows he must stop, soon his fragile body will give out. He returns to the depressed raft. He has failed. He has lost his best friend./p p class=\"MsoNormal\"\"Bruce, what the hell is that?!\" Shouted the fisherman wearing a wine red hat.

The other strap dangled at his side due to a missing button./p p class=\"MsoNormal\"The men collectively agreed to scoop up the haired volleyball./p p class=\"MsoNormal\"\"We must be careful, this thing looks like some sort of voodoo.\" Martin exclaimed. \"I'm pretty sure this was part of a sacrifice!

His unchanging face, mimicked a lawn gnome. Plastic and permanent. Chuck picked up one of the few remaining coconuts. The sweet freshwater tickled his parched mouth. He was able to bottle up enough coconuts to last him a month. However, the storm engulfed most of his resources. Chuck casts out his net. His stomach moaned and begged for sustenance. He had little water and no food. Perhaps he would be happier with taking his last breath and ending it all. Suddenly, there was a tug. Chuck raised up the net to find one small fish thrashing about in his net. He had done it! Finally, a meal. Chuck snagged the empty coconut and smashed in the head of the small fish. Blood splattered as the mangled heap of meat slowly lost life and relaxed into a silent, lifeless handful of slop. He bit into the flesh. /p p class=\"MsoNormal\" /p[Chapter 2] Martin was busy chucking fish across the deck. \"I think we've got ourselves a nice catch.\" Martin cheered. \"One more day and I think we can start heading for shore again.\" Said Bruce. \"I can't wait to get off this….Hey! What is that over there?\" Martin Shouted. The men raced to the bow and peered into the water. To their surprise, there was a man. A sickly, beardy, skinny old man just resting on a pile of woven sticks. \"Hey you over there!\" The Men shouted. Chuck's lifeless body began to move. He sat up. His pale face was frozen. Astonished. The men paddled up to Chuck's raft and threw him a life ring. Chuck then sat on the ring as if it were a pool toy from his childhood. The men pulled him aboard. Along with a strange UPS package the man insisted on bringing aboard. \"How the hell did you get out here?\" Martin sassed. Chuck's sunken face fell towards the ground. He dropped his package. Chuck stumbled forward, backward, forward and then finally collapsed on deck. The boat swayed from side to side. Martin brought water and a stack of saltines. Chuck dragged his body off the ground and took a sip of the crisp water. Never had anything tasted so pure to him in his life. He bit into the cracker, almost forgetting how to savor the salty taste. At last he was rescued. There was hope, for him at least. He has been without his best friend for what has seemed like years. Too bad Wilson wasn't around to celebrate. Chuck continued to nibble on his cracker like a tiny hamster. Martin and Bruce went back to work, pulling in nets of precious fish. Chuck stumbled over to the side and began to rest on top of what seemed to be a woven basket. He set the package down next to him. \"You never answered my question. Who are you and how did you get out in the middle of the fucking ocean?\" Martin demanded. Chuck's ears had gone so long without hearing another human's voice he didn't quite know how to respond. He opened his mouth only to have gibberish escape. The fishermen were startled. \"We need to travel back to shore\" Bruce nervously said. Martin nodded his head and the men set off to shore.[Chapter 3] When the men arrived at the dock, they immediately dialed for the paramedics. Chuck, who was still in a dazed state, stood up from the woven basket. He took one step and then tumbled down like a drunken old man. Fishing gear flew everywhere. Chuck felt terrible. These men had saved him, he was going to leave and had made a huge mess. \"Don't worry about it man, you're Ill. Take a rest.\" Bruce stated. \"I am not leaving you with a mess.\" Chuck choked out. Chuck's face lit up upon the realization that he just communicated with another human. He hadn't accomplished this in years. He thought that maybe there was hope for a normal life. Chuck began collecting the spilled fishing poles and lined them up against the wall. Bruce and Martin were getting annoyed, but grateful for the extra help. \"Hey, what's your name again?\" Martin questioned. \"My name is Chuck. I've been lost for a long time now.\" He replied. \"What do you mean lost?\" Bruce snapped. \"I have been stranded on an island with my friend Wilson for around eleven years.\" The color drained from Bruce and Martin's faces. Never had they expected this response. \"How did you get on an island?\" Martin questioned. \"I worked for Fedex for years, the plane crash landed in the ocean.\" I was the only survivor. \"That doesn't make sense. I thought you had a friend. Was the Island inhabited?\" Bruce stated. \"Yes, I did have a friend, Wilson. We were the only ones on the island.\" Chuck sighed. \"I'm sorry for your loss, I'm sure Wilson was a good man, he'd be proud of you for getting this far.\" Bruce said softly. Chuck and the men continued to pick up dropped supplies, still waiting on the paramedics. \"Where should I put these sinkers?\" Chuck questioned. \"Over there, in that thing.\" Martin pointed. \"Where?\" Chuck said in confusion. \"That container or something in the corner.\" Martin replied. Chuck walked over to a woven basket. Was this what Martin was referring to. Chuck hadn't been reintroduced to society a day and already was confused. He reached for the lid of the basket and calmly slid it off. There was some strange straw-like material emerging at the surface. Chuck must have had the wrong bin. There was no room for sinkers in here. He put the lid back down when he realized that the grassy bundle was the remains of his dear friend's hair. \"WILSON.\" Chuck screamed. Martin and Bruce nearly fell over in fear. Never had they heard a grown man yell so loud. He really was mad. Maybe they should have left him on the raft. Chuck's face welled up, red with hot tears of Joy. He held up his beloved friend. Wilson's bloody face was smeared but that didn't make him any less loved. Chuck was once again reunited with his companion. Suddenly the ship lit up with lights of red and blue. The loud sirens pierced Chuck's ears. He hadn't missed that sound. Chuck departed Martin and Bruce's ship. \"I really have no words to describe my gratitude. You saved me. Thank you.\" Chuck stated while hugging Wilson. He didn't even bother to question how the men found him. The only thing that mattered was that wherever Chuck would spend the night, Wilson would be by his side again.[Chapter 4] -two years later- Chuck's alarm clock buzzed on the freshly polished night stand. He reached over and slapped the clock silent. The sun shined through the big hotel window. Chicago really was beautiful in the morning. Chuck rolled out of his bed and dragged himself to the bathroom where he began his everyday routine: sleep, shower, get dressed, eat, and work. Wilson was perched in the corner. His face was permanently fixed with red paint. His body was still matted with dirt and use. Chuck went and got his daily coffee and began to read the newspaper. Everyday there seemed to be a shooting, worry in the economy, or some other depressing situation. Chuck often questioned if leaving the island was worth it. After all, his true love had moved on and has a family of her own. Chuck is plagued with rules, bills, and stress. His favorite part of life by far is his job. He has the privilege to travel the United States speaking to children and adults about his story. As a public speaker, Chuck has already earned many awards within his first year. If only he had someone to celebrate with. He didn't have a permanent home or many friends. Wilson was great but sometimes got on Chuck's nerves. The elevator arrived at the ground floor. A beautiful fountain greeted everyone who entered. How easy it was to get water. Here people just used water for fun. Does anyone take a moment to appreciate their privileged life? Chuck walked through the wide revolving door and flagged down a bus. \"Fifty cents sir.\" The bus driver yelled. She was rather large. Her hair hung from one side and covered her eyes. How could one drive a bus looking like that Chuck thought to himself? Chuck dropped the money in the collector and proceeded to find an empty seat. The only one surprisingly was next to a women, probably in her forties. She was beautiful. Her face was smooth and gentle. She had creamy brown eyes and brown hair. Her blazer suggested intelligence, her bright red shoes suggested fun. Chuck smiled as he took a seat next to this beautiful lady. She glanced up and smiled. \"Hello there.\" Chuck said smiling. \"Good Morning Sir.\" The women replied. \"How are you this fine morning?\" \"I'm mighty swell. Just off to work. You?\" \"I am going to go hear a public speaker, he has an incredible story.\" The women replied. \"Oh really, I am not a fan of public speakers, often their stories are pity parties, too hard to believe.\" Chuck lied. \"Well, this story is too incredible to be made up.\" \"How do you know that? He could just be like the rest of them.\" Chuck questioned. \"I recently got a hand delivered package by that man. He arrived out of nowhere. He had kept it safe on his island the entire time. Other packages he had opened but not this one, it was specially marked. I never got to thank him for delivering it to me. I'm sure he's curious what it was.\" The women explained. Chuck couldn't believe this was the same lady. It was true, all of what she had said. Chuck did question the package but decided to block it from his memory. \"I think I'll pass, enjoy the speech. Have a nice day.\" Chuck said rushing to get off of the bus. He had been startled, this wasn't even his stop. Chuck walked two more blocks until he reached the beautiful lyric opera house. The massive doors stared him down. Chuck inhaled and exhaled. His life has become so normal, or so he thought. Does he know what it means to be normal? There's so many normal standards. This world was so big, he was so small. Although after today, it appears the world is smaller than it seems. He thought about that women. The surprise and joy she must have felt when she found the package. The joy was just enough to raise his drooping lips to form a smile. He pulled the large handle and walked into the lobby. What a day. ","Summary":" p class=\"MsoNormal\"Rain pelted the green plastic roof.

Sitting in the car beside him was Kelly Frears, the love of his life. They were driving back to his hotel room, unsure of the future. One thing was certain- they loved each other and that no matter what happened that love would guide their path. It would be a rocky one, to be sure. Kelly was leaving behind a daughter and a husband who would not understand. She would fight for her daughter, but she would deal with that later. Right now they had each other, something that they had never really thought would happen again. Pulling up to the hotel, Chuck looked at Kelly nervously. What were they doing? Was this really happening? Could they really forget about everything and give in to each other's deepest desires? There was only one way to find out. He held the door open for her and took her hand, remembering all of the times he had done that previously. So many memories flooded his mind, not just of Kelly but of the island as well. You wouldn't happen to have a match by any chance? His first words to Wilson he would never forget. Wilson. How could he ever explain that to anyone? Wilson was his friend, his only friend when he needed one the most, and now he was gone and Kelly was here. Chuck knew what he would do- he would buy a new volleyball. Not that it would take Wilson's place of course, but it would serve as a reminder of what he had had, and that was good enough for him. Inside the hotel Chuck fumbled with the key and finally managed to open the door. The walk to the room was one of nervous silence and excitement, both knowing what was about to happen but neither of them willing to put into words for fear they jinx their night. Just for the night they wanted to forget all of their problems, all of their cares, all of their worries, and just be… \"Can I get you something? Some Coke? I can get some ice? Great stuff that ice,\" Chuck marveled. \"No thank you. I'm fine,\" Kelly smilled nervously. \"So…\" \"So…\" Suddenly Kelly wrapped her arms around Chuck's neck and kissed him passionately, throwing herself into the moment. At first he was taken aback but this was Kelly for goodness sake and this was a moment he'd dreamed of for years. He pulled her close to him, never wanting to let go and pressed her tightly against him. He ran his hand along her dress and allowed himself to trace every curve, remembering how soft she felt against his touch. It didn't take them long before he had entered her, pressing softly but firmly against her until she cried out in pleasure and he knew that he'd taken her where he wanted to. She cried out again before it was his turn and they both collapsed in exhaustion. They exchanged I love you's and settled into a deep sleep, which was a good thing because they needed all the rest they could get for the long road ahead.[Chapter 2] \"Good morning,\" Kelly smiled as she turned on the coffee. \"Good morning,\" Chuck rolled over, for a second forgetting where he was and that he had some company. But this was real, Kelly was here with him and he wasn't alone. Not anymore. He thought about asking her to marry him right then and there but then he remembered she was already spoken for. That was right. She was married. Last night was wonderful but today brought a whole new set of problems. First order of business was bringing him back to life. He had to get with Stan and meet with some lawyers and deal with some paperwork and bring himself back to life so to speak. Legal stuff. But he would gladly suffer through all of this if it meant never looking at that awful island again. \"What are you thinking about? You're looking so serious,\" Kelly commented as she gently ran her fingers through his hair. \"Nothing. Nothing important. Is the coffee ready?\" Kelly frowned. She knew that he might have a difficult time adjusting to life back in Memphis and she didn't want to pressure him but she wished he would open up. He always did keep things to himself, that was just his way. But for some reason she hoped that this time would be different. A person couldn't go through the experiences Chuck did and not be changed. She would give him time. That's all they had. They had no guarantee that things would work out. They made no promises to each other, no commitments. But they had time to get to know each other all over again and find out if that love was still there and to let it grow, maybe even deeper than before. \"Chuck?\" \"Yes?\" He asked as he sipped the coffee had brought him. He set it down then set about the process of getting dressed. Kelly tried not to stare but she couldn't help herself; she still couldn't believe she was here with him. She'd given up Jerry and Katie and her whole life and she couldn't think about that now. What was important was the love she found and she would never let go of again. Chuck loved her and she loved him and nothing would come between them- she would make sure of that. \"Is everything okay?\" He looked at her and finished pulling up his pants and stopped for a minute and looked for her thoughtfully. What would Wilson say? Would he tell him to reassure Kelly because that's what she needed or would he tell him to tell her the truth- that Chuck was just as scared as she was. He decided to go with the former. \"Everything's fine Kelly. I promise.\" He smiled and took her hand.\" Not really believing him but not wanting to not believe him, Kelly leaned in and gave him a kiss. \"I love you,\" she whispered. \"I love you, too.\" And they would need that love for what lay ahead.[Chapter 3] \"Chuck did you hear him? He's offering you fifteen million dollars-plus your job for life if you'd even want it,\" Stan whispered as the reality of the situation began to sink in. Fifteen milliion dollars- that was a lot of money. Never in his life had he even met someone with that much money, let alone let himself dream of possessing it. \"Chuck we appreciate what you've been through and we certainly cannot underestimate the conditions in what you've had to endure. Here at Fed-Ex we believe in taking care of our own and we want to make sure that you're going to have every thing that you will ever need for the rest of your life,\" George Cooper the cooperate attorney spoke up. \"Well that sounds great but I think that I need a little time to think about this. Certainly you guys can appreciate this don't you?\" Chuck asked. \"Unfortunately, policy allows us to make this a one time offer. So unfortunately..\" \"You need my decision now.\" \"May I consult with my client?\" Steven Worthington, Chuck's lawyer asked. \"You don't have to accept this you know. There are other options.\" \"Such as?\" \"Pursuing our legal options…\" \"Suing them?\" \"Ssh!\" \"Suing them?\" The thought had never crossed his mind although it did seem like a possibility. No, no. He wasn't like that. He couldn't do that to the company he'd devoted himself to. Even though he'd lost years of his life due to a plane crash that was not his fault he couldn't see suing his company. It just wasn't in his character. \"Think about it Chuck. You're quite sympathetic. Barring some awful skeleton in your closet that you're not telling me about there's no way a jury wouldn't award you twice what they're offering. I strongly suggest you take your chances and go for it.\" What his lawyer didn't know about- what no one knew about- was Kelly. Chuck was quite sure that Jerry Lovett would be more than happy to testify for Fed-Ex as to Chuck's character, or lack of it. And the last thing he wanted to do was to put Kelly through a public humiliation. He would never hurt her, not on purpose. She had already been through so much. Chuck approached the table. \"Where do I sign?\" And just like that Chuck Noland was a millionaire. And he knew the first thing he would buy.[Chapter 4] Millionaire. Chuck couldn't believe it. All of his problems were behind him, or so he thought. He had Kelly and he was financially set for life; he couldn't wait to tell her about this. But for some reason he found himself at a Wal-Mart at the sporting goods section. This was hard. Did he really want to go there? Nothing could ever replace Wilson. Did he really need that reminder of his time on the island? There they were in front of him: a row of Wilson volleyballs. Chuck laughed to himself as wondered which one called his name. That was more than just an expression, though no one would ever understand it. He smiled as he grabbed the one in the back, the one that might not get picked first but certainly was as good as the others. Finally, he could sleep well at nights again. He got back to his place and he saw Kelly's car so he left Wilson II in the car. He didn't feel like explaining it to her, not yet. Chuck knew that she would understand so he would tell her when the time was right. He went inside where he saw that Kelly had been crying. \"What's wrong honey? Did I do something wrong?\" Chuck asked, running over to her. She held out papers. \"No. It's not you. It's my ex. He's served me with divorce papers.\" \"Well that's not so bad. We can finally be together,\" he reassured her. Kelly looked up at him. \"You don't get it. He's asking for full custody of Katie.\" Just then he knew all of the money in the world wouldn't solve this problem. ","Summary":" Chuck Noland couldn't believe it.

Seven years ago, Melanie Carmichael took her five year old daughter andnwalked out on her childhood sweetheart to go to New York and follow ansuccessful career as a fashion designer. Now she wants to remarry but hernhusband Jake refuses to divorce her, so Mel and her twelve year oldndaughter Emma return to Alabama to settle things. However, Emma is nonlonger the sweet five year old that Jake remembers. CHAPTER 1 \"Hey Mel!\" Melanie half smiled as she opened the back door of thencar. Jake, her childhood sweetheart then husband for fifteen years wasnleaning over the side of the porch, watching her. \"Long time, no see\" hencontinued \"How long has it been, sweetheart?\" \"Seven years\" replied Melanie, ducking down to look in the back ofnthe car. Jake grinned and wolf whistled. \"Seven years and you still have the nicest ass in Alabama.\" \"Grow up Jake.\" Mel stood up and scowled. \"I didn't come here so wencould get back together. I came here to get you to sign these bloodynpapers, agree over custody of your daughter and let me get on with mynlife.\" \"You promised you'd bring her with you. Where is she?\" Emma decided now would be a good time to get out the car. She stoodnup and stared at the man she had once called daddy. Jake avoided the looknin her eyes and scanned the rest of her. Seven years could change a lot, henthought. She was taller now but still as slim. Her body had begun tonmature, giving her shape which she refused to show. The scruffy jeans andnwhite shirt with sleeves rolled up past her elbows disguised her figure.nYou would have thought that living in New York with a fashion designernwould have caused her to develop some style in the way she dressed, but no,nshe wore the same as she always had. Her blond hair was braided down hernback but a few rogue strands had escaped and curled round her face, blowingnin the breeze. \"Emma.\" Jake smiled and stood up, walking down the steps to meet her.nEmma tensed up, stood taller and glared. \"Jake.\" The icy tone of her voice made Jake feel uneasy. He stoodnstill, wondering what to do. It was Melanie who broke the uncomfortablensilence. \"Emma, go inside and get yourself something to drink. Nothingnalcoholic.\" She told her daughter. Emma walked up the steps, stepped pastnher father and went inside. Jake watched her go, paused and thought for ansecond then turned to Melanie. \"My twelve year old drinks?\" He asked. Melanie pulled the last bagnout of the boot of the car and turned to face him. \"Our twelve year old.\" She corrected \"And yes, she drinksnoccasionally.\" \"Just occasionally?\" \"Only when she's stressed.\" He nodded, as though that statement made all the difference. Melanienlooked at the luggage at her feet then up at him, her hands on her hips. \"Well are you going to help me with these or what?\"[Chapter 2] CHAPTER 2 Emma sat on the sofa, looking relatively at home with a glass of Pepsi in her hand. It had been the only drink in the house besides the beer and the occasional bottle of wine. She sat and watched her mother chase her husband round the house waving some papers and a pen at him, occasionally yelling at him. However, Jake Perry was not a man to give in easily and gave as good as he got. \"Sign it.\" Mel hissed, almost sticking the pen in his mouth. \"Can't you just leave me alone?\" \"If you'd just sign your name I'll go. Right now.\" \"I'm not signing anything. Emma get your feet off the seat.\" \"What do you mean you won't sign it?\" \"I mean I won't sign it. Get your shoes off my furniture!\" \"Emma please do what he tells you. Listen Jake, I am remarrying and I can't do it until you sign these.\" \"Not my problem.\" Emma took her muddy cat boots off the seat, drained the last of the Pepsi and stood up. She marched up to Jake and glared at him, her neck craned as he was at least a two and a half heads taller than she was. \"It is too your problem!\" she yelled indignantly \"Isn't it about time you took a little responsibility for the trouble you've caused?\" \"Emma.\" Melanie's voice was more of a whisper than an angry reprimand. Not unusually, Emma ignored her mother. \"He's such a jerk, mom. It's about time he did something decent for you.\" \"Listen honey, don't worry about this. Go and unpack or something. I'll handle your daddy.\" \"Right mess you've made of handling him.\" \"Mind your own business.\" Melanie snapped, beginning to loose her temper with her hot headed twelve year old. Emma glared and turned back to Jake, scowling. \"What happened to you?\" Jake asked. \"You were such a sweet kid when you lived here.\" Emma slapped him. He flinched, more from shock than pain. Melanie put her head in her hands. Everyone stood still, not knowing how to react or what to do next. They were saved by the doorbell ringing. Without bothering to wait for the door to be answered, the sheriff strode inside. \"Mel!\" He greeted. \"How are you? It's so good to see you again. You haven't changed a bit, have you? And, don't tell me, this must be Emma. You've grown kid.\" He stopped short as he noticed the look on their faces. Melanie looked furious. \"You called the sheriff?\" she snarled. Jake shrugged. \"So Jake, what can I do for you?\" Once again, Jake was at a loss for words. He didn't even know where to start. Melanie did, however, and angrily explained the situation as Emma strolled back into the kitchen and casually poured herself another glass of Pepsi. When she returned, she took a seat at one end of the sofa and listened to the adults bickering. \"So this is just a domestic disturbance then?\" The sheriff said. \"I'm afraid there's nothing I can do about that.\" He turned to Mel. \"He didn't hit you, did he? Or the kid? That's a big thing now.\" Melanie shook her head. \"She hit me though.\" Jake added, nodding in the direction of the girl curled up on his couch, again with her dirty shoes on his furniture. Melanie rolled her eyes, offered the sheriff an arm and took him through to the kitchen, closing the door behind them. Jake collapsed down at the other end of the couch and looked at his daughter. \"Traitor.\" she said, folding her arms moodily. \"Ratbag.\" he retorted as he too folded his arms and turned away.[Chapter 3] CHAPTER 3 It took Melanie a while to persuade the sheriff that everything was under control and to go home; there was nothing he could do. Both Jake and Emma spent the time hunched on the couch, sulking. When Melanie came back through and saw them sitting side by side, arms folded and scowling, she allowed a smile to escape her lips before composing herself again. They were very similar, both in looks and personality. Neither of them looked up when she entered but she knew they had heard her come in. \"So. Is one of you going to explain what that was all about?\" Melanie asked. Emma groaned. \"Are you blind momma? You know as well as anyone what's going on. Jake's a moron and he can't handle this himself so he roped in the sheriff to do it for him. He…..\" Melanie interrupted, a little hurt by her daughter's bluntness. \"Emma, please.\" \"Mom? Shut up.\" It was Jake's turn to interrupt. \"You don't go speaking to your momma like that, you here me?\" \"Stop trying to do the whole daddy thing with me. You can't just abandon me for seven years then come back and expect to start where we left off.\" \"I didn't abandon you! It was you who refused to respond to anything. I wrote to you every month. You never wrote back. I called at weekends. You were hardly ever around and if you were you didn't want to talk to me. I send you birthday and Christmas presents. Did I ever get even one word of thanks? No. Don't tell me I never tried.\" \"So why did you never come and visit me?\" Emma snapped. There was a tense pause, then Melanie spoke for him, her voice quivering slightly. \"That was my fault, Emma. I……I thought it would be best.\" \"Best for who momma? Me or you?\" \"Please don't do this honey\" Melanie whispered, her eyes filling with tears. Emma took a deep breath in an attempt to calm herself down. \"Why?\" \"It was too much. I didn't want to see him.\" \"You stopped me from seeing my daddy because you couldn't cope with it?\" Emma stood up furiously. A tear escaped and ran down Melanie's face and she bit her lip to stop more falling. \"I'm sorry.\" \"Like that makes it all right? Momma, you took my father away from me and you think sorry is gonna change anything? You……you bitch!\" Emma turned on her heel and stormed up the metal stairs to her old bedroom, slamming the door behind her. Melanie did nothing to stop the tears from flowing. Jake sat still, as though frozen, as a wave of negative emotions swept over him.[Chapter 4] CHAPTER 4 Jake finally found his feet and raced up the stairs after her. He opened the door and jumped off the small platform, ignoring the ladder he was supposed to use. Emma's bedroom was their old attic, the only room not on the ground floor. The top of the stairs was maybe about three feet above the rest of her room and there was an old wooden ladder to help Emma get up and down. A platform at the same level as the landing ran round half the room, creating as it were a stage where the old oak desk and chair sat, next to the dusty old bookcase, filled mainly with school books, picture books and fairy stories that she had left there. Below there was the bed, just a jump away from the platform. Like the rest of her furniture, the dusty old wardrobe was made of oak too and it sat over the far side of her room. A dresser with a sink at the end and a mirror sat opposite the bed, under the two small windows, to high to reach. In case of emergencies, there was a trapdoor under the rug and a ladder she could let down into her parent's bedroom. Well, Jake's bedroom now. Jake had designed it himself. It was ideal; it supplied an emergency exit for her if there was an accident but meant that she couldn't sneak out the house without him noticing. Emma was lying face down on her bed, wanting to cry but too angry to let the tears fall. Angry with Jake; with Melanie; with herself even. Jake coughed and Emma looked round, realising she wasn't the only person angry with her. \"Don't you dare speak to your momma like that.\" \"Go 'way.\" She replied, burying her head in her pillow. \"Look at me when I'm talking to you.\" Emma sat up, furious, but not as mad as her father. \"Leave me alone.\" She had meant it to sound threatening and angry but it came out as weak and frightened. \"None of your cheek. You're in enough trouble as it is. You understand me, girl?\" \"Oh get lost you stupid……\" She broke off as she saw him finger the thick leather belt he wore, contemplating what to do with it. He wouldn't hit her with it, surely? He had spanked her when she was little for misbehaving but never with a belt. Melanie disagreed with it; she had never lifted a finger to her daughter. \"And much good it did her\" Jake thought, sarcastically. Melanie had spoiled her and doted on her, never disciplining her and the years without a father around had let Emma slip; she was rude and wild and unruly and didn't seem to care. Jake was livid- he still loved Melanie and hated to see her cry. He stared at the girl on the bed; the girl who had hurt his wife and expected to hate her but he didn't. He loved her, and, angry as he was, he couldn't bring himself to take off the belt. He let go and clenched his fists. Feeling soft made him feel weak however and feeling weak made him all the more angrier, so he pulled the child up, sat on the bed and put her over his knee. She squirmed, embarrassed and angry but didn't speak, feeling relieved that he wasn't taking his belt to her. \"You understand why I have to do this, don't you?\" She nodded. Feeling like he was punishing a five year old again, Jake spanked her then sat her up. Tears were running down her cheeks and Jake suddenly felt very sorry for her. He put his arm round her and watched her snuggle into his shoulder. They sat quietly together for a moment, the silence only broken by Emma's sobs and the sniffles of Melanie from downstairs. In his fury, Jake had forgotten that Melanie was downstairs. He sighed then looked at his watch. \"I need to go down and see your momma, all right? It's getting late so go through your stuff and get ready for bed. I'll be back in a bit.\" Emma nodded, sniffed and slid off his lap. He stood up, pushed himself up onto the landing and turned to go. \"Oh, Emma?\" She looked round. \"You know I love you, yeah?\" She wiped her eyes and nodded again. He grinned and headed down stairs, closing the door behind him.[Chapter 5] CHAPTER 5 thanks to all my amazingly cool reviewers! Sorry if chapters are bit short but they always look bigger on paper! Keep reading and reviewing and I won't send Jake round to beat you up! Oh, for Any Bobby-Ray fans, he appears in the next chapter. Melanie was sitting on the couch surrounded by a fluffy white sea of tissues. She held a Kleenex in one hand and a bottle of beer in the other. Her eyes were red and puffy and her mascara made her resemble a panda but Jake didn't care; this was the Melanie that he loved, for better or for worse, and regardless of how she felt about him, he couldn't leave her alone like this. He sat down beside her and slipped an arm round her shaking shoulders. Like her daughter, Melanie snuggled close to him and buried her head in his chest. \"Did I do the right thing?\" she sobbed. Jake wasn't really sure. From his point of view, it was obviously a no, but he needed to look at what was best for Emma and Melanie, both at the time and in the long run. He shrugged and stroked her hair and for a moment it felt like old times, when it was him and Melanie and Emma together. Melanie must have realised this too because as he leaned closer she jumped away. This wasn't right, she loved someone else now. \"I……I think I just need a good nights sleep.\" She said quickly, wiping her face on her sleeve and standing up. He nodded, a little disappointed. \"I left your stuff in the spare room honey. Is that all right?\" Melanie nodded, smiled and headed for her room. Jake sighed and watched her leave, then headed back up the stairs to see his daughter. \"Can I come in?\" he whispered, knocking quietly. He took her silence for a yes, turned the handle and for once remembered to use the ladder. She was sitting up in bed, the blanket wrapped round her and didn't bother to look at him, not even when he sat beside her. \"You all right sweetheart?\" he asked, swinging his legs round until he was sitting entirely on the bed. Emma ignored him and stared at the wall opposite. He put his arm round her and followed her gaze. There was nothing on the wall but for one reason or another, they both looked intently at it until sleep overcame Emma and she sat back against her father, eyes closed. Jake grinned and lay back, closing his eyes as well. That was how Melanie found them about an hour later when she came up to say goodnight to Emma, both curled up asleep on the bed. Smiling, she turned off the light and tiptoed out, closing the door behind her.[Chapter 6] CHAPTER 6 Emma was the first of the two to wake. It was early, barely light, but she couldn't stay in bed any longer. Moving carefully so as not to wake Jake, she tip-toed to the sink, washed her face and hands then went through her suitcase, looking for a clean shirt. She dressed silently and went downstairs, treading lightly as the house was still quiet, then unlocked the door and headed for the beach, whistling, but not entirely sure why. She wasn't feeling particularly cheerful; in fact she was still raging from the night before, but the crashing of the white water on the rocks below her somehow soothed her slightly and gave her a chance to reflect. She was in a right mess now. Her outburst last night had made Melanie cry. Jake hated her and thought she hated him back. She didn't hate him, well, she didn't think she hated him. Maybe she was angry but given the circumstances surely she was allowed to be mad? And it wasn't just Jake she should be angry with. Melanie, her own Momma had betrayed her. Emma too had a lot to feel guilty about; her coldness towards her father over the past few years, what she had hollered at both her parents in a temper, slapping Jake - all the hatred that had built up inside her had erupted like a furious volcano last night and she'd hurt people. Like really hurt people. \"Emma? Is that you?\" She turned round, blinking back tears, and looked up into the smiling face of Bobby Ray. She grinned and he sat beside her. \"We heard you were back in town. Dammit girl, you've grown up fast. We've all missed you.\" Realising she had been crying, he put up a hand to her face and gently stroked her cheek. \"What's happening kid?\" he continued. It was easier to come back to Bobby Ray than it was seeing Jake again. Bobby Ray and her had been close; he was like an uncle to her and she'd regretted leaving him behind when she'd gone to New York. He was a childhood friend of both her momma and her daddy; they went way back together and Bobby Ray had always been around with a smile when they'd needed him. \"I had a fight with Jake.\" Bobby Ray smiled. Of course she had- Jake was stubborn and hot headed and Emma had inherited his temper. \"He's your daddy girl. He loves you, he wants to protect you. What happened?\" Trying not to cry again, she told him. His face remained calm and friendly, and although the smile had faded a little, Emma knew he wasn't angry at her. They sat on the rocks, occasionally getting showered with salty spray, and talking for ages, until Emma realised that her folks would be awake and wondering where she was. She said goodbye to Bobby Ray and he hugged her as she got up to go. He was a good friend to have and she was lucky to have him; he would listen and he wouldn't judge her when she lost her temper. He didn't always take her side; this time he had taken Jake's; but still he would always listen to her story and stick around for her. Quickly she ran along the beach and across the grass, hoping they had not missed her much and both had calmed down a bit. She took a deep breath before she went inside, resolving to keep her temper and sort out the mess she had made. It wouldn't be easy, but she had to do it.[Chapter 7] CHAPTER 7 \"Mom!\" Emma hollered as she came in. Jake looked up from his breakfast and shushed her. \"Your momma's still sleepin'. Where have you been, anyways?\" \"Down by the sea\" she replied, tugging her sandy boots off \"met Bobby Ray.\" tJake nodded, his mouth full of food. \"He's been missing you, you know. Always askin' after you.\" He swallowed and wiped his mouth on his sleeve. \"Not that I've ever had much to tell him.\" Emma opened her mouth to make some retort but shut it as she remembered her promise. He didn't seem to notice however. \"You had breakfast?\" Emma shook her head. He stood up, as though to go and get her something to eat, but she pulled him back down and sat on a stool beside him. \"Naw, don't bother. I'm all right.\" They sat silently for a while, then Emma spoke. t\"Jake?\" \"The name's dad. What?\" \"Do you still love my momma?\" Jake sighed and avoided her eyes. \"Well do you?\" \"Get me a beer, will you?\" \"Can I……?\" \"No.\" Emma could tell by the tone of his voice that he wasn't going to change his mind, so she swung off her chair and went to the fridge. Handing him the bottle, she sat back down and watched him drain half the liquid. \"Do you?\" \"It's too early in the morning to answer questions, honey.\" \"Jake.\" \"Dad.\" \"Whatever. Do you still love my mom?\" \"I still love her.\" \"But are you still in love with her? Do you fancy her?\" \"Your momma's marrying some rich Yankee. It doesn't matter any more.\" \"Have you got a girlfriend?\" \"I got a girl.\" \"So you don't love mom?\" \"People change sweetheart. Your momma's changed a lot. She's not the Felony Melanie that I married any more. She's just this snotty, Yankee bitch.\" \"Thanks Jake.\" Emma and Jake swung round. Melanie was standing in the doorway, arms folded, having heard most of the conversation. Emma took advantage of Jake's distraction to sneak a bit of toast from his plate, pick up his half finished beer bottle and go back upstairs, leaving Jake to worm his way out of another uncomfortable situation. \"Why do you always have to make out like I'm the villain? Last night you succeeded in making my own daughter hate me. Have you any idea how that makes me feel?\" \"You've spent the past seven years making my daughter hate me. Of course I know how it feels.\" \"Why won't you just sign the bloody papers and I can just get out of your life and on with my own?\" \"I'm not signing.\" \"Why not? Could you just give me one good reason as to why you have to make this so difficult? \"The only reason I ain't signing is coz you've turned into some hoity toity Yankee bitch and I'd like nothing more than to piss you off!\" \"JAKE!\" \"What?\" In despair and frustration, Melanie flung up her hands, grabbed her jacket and stormed out. Emma put on her music and turned it up as loud as it would go. \"Emma turn that down!\" Jake hollered from downstairs. She switched it off completely, but the silence was too much for Jake just then so he yelled at her to put it back on. Slightly confused, but happy she had got her own way, Emma did.[Chapter 8] CHAPTER 8 \"Is this another part in your plan to annoying me into signing?\" Jake asked, turning off the engine and jumping out the truck in front of the pub. Melanie stepped out the other side and nodded sweetly. Emma was at home on her own, claiming that pizza made the best babysitter; Jake had a date and Melanie was going to catch up with some old friends and annoy the hell outta Jake. \"Jake!\" They turned to see some small, dark haired girl run towards them. \"Hey babe.\" Jake said, holding out his arms for her to run into them. \"Who's that?\" she asked, noticing that Jake wasn't alone. Melanie smiled and held out her hand. \"Hey, you must Jake's hot date. I'm Melanie, Jake's snotty Yankee bitch wife that he refuses to divorce.\" They shook hands quickly and looked at Jake, who winced and blushed slightly. Ignoring Melanie and arm round his girlfriends shoulder, Jake made his way into the pub. Lurlynn was first to recognize Melanie. They both screamed and Melanie ran over to her. \"Melanie! You look, um, different. Really nice though.\" \"Thanks. And look at you. You have a baby……in a bar.\" Lurlynn smiled and the baby perched on her hip gurgled and sucked its finger. Melanie returned the smile, chatted for a while, then wandered round the bar, catching up with old friends and meeting a few new ones. And, as everyone she met insisted on buying her a drink, and she bought a few of her own, she was a little tipsy by the time they all gathered round the pool table to watch her challenge Jake. Three rounds and goodness knows how many beers later, Melanie was well out of things and it showed. Slurring her words and swaying about unnervingly, she fired insults and cutting remarks at her friends, who were mostly too shocked or upset to answer back. Bobby Ray was last. He didn't look too offended; but then again, Bobby Ray didn't easily get wound up. \"What'd I ever do to you?\" he asked. Everyone looked at Melanie waiting to hear her reply. In fact, the entire pub was silent but this didn't seem to affect her. \"Oh, you didn't do anything to me...or any other girl for that matter.\" she answered sweetly. Jake cringed and Bobby Ray blushed. The others stared from Melanie to Bobby Ray and back to Melanie again, not sure what to believe. It was Jake who moved first. Taking the half drunk glass from her hand and setting it on the edge of the pool table, he grabbed Melanie's arm and propelled her outside into the car park. \"What is it?\" she slurred. \"You can say what you like to me but I'm not having you come down here and speak to my friends like that.\" Melanie tried to tell him to get lost but her words tumbled over each other until she leaned over and threw up. Jake groaned. \"Go and get in the truck. I'm taking you home.\" Jake's 'hot date' chose that moment to appear. \"Jake honey, what's going on?\" \"Get in the truck.\" He repeated, sternly. \"Nothing sweetie\" he continued. \"I need to take Mel home. She's had maybe one drink too many. I'll call you tomorrow honey.\" His girl stalked off with a final look of disgust at Melanie who was leaning out the window being violently sick. Jake groaned and got in the truck. Maybe having Melanie back was more than he had bargained for.[Chapter 9] Thanks to all my reviewers, especially to Dari and Mary Kate who've reviewed almost constantly- thanks guys. Hope you like the chapter! Peace out, luv Kathryn CHAPTER 9 \"Hey girl!\" Emma turned round and saw Bobby Ray climbing up the rocks to sit beside her. \"Bobby Ray!\" He grinned. \"You been crying again?\" \"You're the one I would have thought would be crying.\" \"Huh?\" \"I was watching T.V. when they got home last night. Momma was drunk; she was out cold. Jake had to carry her in. He told me what happened. I'm sorry 'bout what she said.\" \"S'allright. So, why you crying?\" \"I'm not crying.\" Emma took a deep breath. \"They had a massive fight this morning. Momma woke up with a headache and started yelling at Jake for letting her get drunk, then he had a go at her for slagging you off. They just stormed round the house for ages, screaming at each other, and……\" She broke off shuddering and took a swig from a green bottle in her hand. \"Let me guess\" Bobby Ray said, taking it off her and pouring it into the sea \"you only drink when you're stressed.\" He handed back the empty bottle. \"That's what your momma always said.\" He paused and for the first time ever, he looked uncomfortable. t\"So, Emma. Does it bother you that……well, that I'm……um……\" \"That you're gay?\" Bobby Ray nodded slowly. \"No. I mean, I've known for ages.\" \"Who told you?\" \"D'ya remember that day, before I left for New York, when I ran in on you and Gerry wotsisface?\" \"You knew then? You were, like, five.\" \" Four. A few years later I told momma what I'd seen and she explained.\" \"But it doesn't bother you?\" \"Naw. Bobby Ray, does Jake love my mom?\" \"Course he does. Why d'ya think he won't sign those papers, huh?\" \"He has now. He was real mad at her last night. But he knows about Andrew, that's momma's boyfriend, well, her fiancée now. And he's got a girl too.\" \"Who, Jena? He doesn't love her girl, he just misses your momma and feels kinda lonely I guess.\" \"Well that's tough; momma's marrying Andrew next week. She says I've gotta be bridesmaid.\" \"That'll be cool.\" \"No it won't. I have to wear a dress. Not just any dress either. A stupid big frilly thing.\" Bobby Ray chuckled and Emma shoved him, attempting to push him off the rocks and into the sea below. It didn't work; he held on and just pushed Emma back again. Screaming and yelling and laughing like children, they fought until Emma lost her footing and slipped. It wasn't far to fall; she wasn't injured but the water was cold. Freezing. Furious, she screamed at him and stormed out, her clothes soaking and salty water dripping from her hair. \"Bobby Ray I am going to kill you for this!\" He laughed hysterically, scrambled down the rocks and stood a few feet away from her. \"Aw honey, did ya get a bit wet losing a fight to Bobby Ray?\" he taunted, not unkindly but all the same, it aggravated her. She stepped towards him, then, realising her boots were soaking and as heavy as lead, tugged them off and chased after him barefoot. He led her along the beach, up the path and across the fields until they ran into the driveway outside Jake's house. Bobby Ray stopped, seeing three expensive, flashy cars parked outside but Emma hadn't seen them and jumped on his back, knocking him over. Playfully, he wrestled back until he felt a sharp kick in his side. He looked up and froze as he saw a furious Melanie towering over him, arms folded and her face set in its best 'unimpressed' look. \"Bobby Ray, let her go\" she hissed. Emma sat up, having not noticed her mother until hearing her voice. \"Oh hey momma.\" She said, standing up and pulling her wet shirt straight. Melanie groaned and brushed her daughters' dripping hair off her face with her hand. \"What is it?\" she asked innocently, turning round to look at the people standing there. \"Oh hi Andrew\" she greeted cheerfully, spying her stepdad to be in amongst the small crowd. He smiled at her, somewhat embarrassed and turned to the older woman beside him. \"Mother, this is Emma, Melanie's daughter.\" The look on Mayor Kate Hennings face made Emma wish the ground would open beneath her and swallow her up. Or at the very least that someone would give her a dry shirt and a hairbrush.[Chapter 10] CHAPTER 10 As he was marrying in less than a week, Andrew Hennings had decided it would be a good idea for his mother to meet his step daughter to be. Unfortunately, her first appearance was not one that impressed. Emma was a nice girl but a little wild it would seem. However, it didn't matter what she thought of Emma; Kate Hennings was already set against the marriage. She didn't think it was right that her rich, upper class son would marry some redneck from Alabama. Jake didn't think much of the marriage either. Andrew was a nice enough bloke but Melanie was his; he was married to her; he had loved her since they were small and it hurt him to let her go; even more to some rich Yankee that would take her away from her friends and family. Even when she took Emma and left, he knew he still loved her and wanted her back, and now it would take more than an apology to keep her. And what about Emma? he thought, worried. It had been hard enough to be apart from her once but they were back together as father and daughter and he couldn't let her go again. Last time she left he didn't get her back for seven years and even then it was a fight. If she went to New York, maybe he would lose her altogether. She wouldn't want him any more; she was still angry at him for letting Melanie go and would never speak to him again if it happened a second time. She wouldn't need him any more. She would have Andrew.tGreat. He was losing his wife and his daughter. Again. He gritted his teeth and started loading up the truck. Out of the family, Emma was probably the most worried about her future. Not about leaving behind her home and father and friends to live with a new man whose mother despised her and had only met her once, but more about the fact that she had to appear in public in a dress. And not just any dress. A big lacy one that she tripped over every time she walked in it. She had a nice figure that was beginning to mature and the dress looked gorgeous on her but that was entirely beside the point. It was a dress! The closer the day of the wedding came, the more doubts Melanie began to have about it. There was no doubt; when Andrew had proposed to her in New York she had loved him and was thrilled to spend the rest of her life with him, but now she was home and, well, things were different. A lot had happened in a week, as she explained to Bobby Ray one afternoon. They were down by the sea, on the rocks where Emma usually was. Melanie, as though in a trance, stared out over the water. \"The truth is, Bobby Ray, I gave my heart away a long time ago, all of it, and I never really got it back.\" He grinned, understanding what she meant. Deep down inside, she still loved Jake and wanted to stay here, in Alabama, in the land she was brought up in, with her friends and family. \"You told anyone else?\" he asked. She shook her head. \"Though I think Emma's guessed.\" Bobby Ray agreed. Emma was a smart girl and something like this wouldn't stay hidden for long. \"You should tell Jake.\" Bobby Ray suggested \"He'd be over the moon. He never stopped loving you, you know. Never wanted to let you go.\" Melanie shook her head. It was the wedding tomorrow- she was marrying Andrew and that was that. All the papers were in place, the ceremony and reception organized, most of the guests were here already and there was nothing she could do.[Chapter 11] CHAPTERn11 We've all seen thenfilm- everyone knows what happened at the wedding. \"You'renthe first boy I kissed, Jake, and I want you to be the last.\" Ohnso cute. Emma was glad just to be inntrousers again. Understandably, Andrew was upset, but went home confident that hisnmother would find him a better girl. Everyone was overjoyed. It was a well known fact thatnJake and Mel were made for each other and things had turned out perfectly. Thingsnquickly settled down and Emma felt as though the seven years in New York had nevernhappened. People were busy playing happy families; friends and neighbours laughed,nchatted and sometimes cried together, but all was well in theirnlittle community. Emma was enrolled innthe local high school and quickly found a best mate in the Sheriff's niece,nCassie. She was a bright and hard-working kid, willing to givenanything a go; pleasant enough innclass and fairly popular with both teachers and pupils. Her easy going nature meant shensettled in fast, much to her mother's delight. Mel had been worried that the kidsnwould tease her because of the things that had happened- coming from New York for anstart. But Emma was very much her father's daughter and it was soon impossible to tellnthat she was born and brought up anywhere other than Alabama. Cassienand Emma became very close, although Emma was nearly two years older than hernfriend. Cassie looked up to Emma- she was cool. She was pretty, smartnand funny, shenwas popular because people respected the fact that she respectednthem, all thingsnthat Cassie had never been. She had been quite sheltered, an onlynchild, and Sheriff Wade hadnprobably been the biggest male influence in her life. Understandably,nshe was shy andnquiet, a littler timid and not particularly adventurous. She wasnwilling to do anythingnthat Emma asked her too, grateful that someone like Emma wanted to benfriends with her.nEmma was good with Cassie; she encouraged her and helped her out, she stoppednother kids laughing at her. Admittedly, she felt a little sorry fornthe younger girl andnoccasionally found her a little irritating, but was very patient andnwas a good friend to her. The twonwent everywhere together, much to the amusement of the adults.nSheriff Wade andnhis mouse-like sister were ecstatic that their timid little Cassienhad found someonenlike Emma to take care of her and spoilt Emma rotten every time shencame withinnhugging distance. Emma didn't mind; she was naturally protective ofnher friend- there wasnsomething about Cassie that made you want to take her home and mothernher. Also, itnfelt good to have someone that looks up to you instead of beingnbullied by some of thenkids in New York because she was a 'redneck'. Emma liked the girl asnwell; despite hernintrovert appearance, she was sweet and kind. Things atnhome were good as well. There was nothing Emma liked to see more than hernmomma resting in her daddy's arms, or the sly little kisses when theynthought she wasn'tnlooking. The past was quickly forgotten and, even during the rarenarguments, was neverndragged up. Emma felt safe and contented with her parents; the housenwas full of love andnlaughter. Sure, it sounded soft like that, but a child values ansecure home more thannanything and Emma was one of the lucky ones who had it. She was happynhere, surroundednby good friends and family, all of whom she loved and who loved hernback. ","Summary":" The Name Is Dad.

P.s.- I DO NOT own Sinister, just my characters. Bughuul knew there would always be more souls to take, he was very patient. Manipulating children was so easy, almost too easy. He thought about all the people in the world. Particularly the ones who didn't have children for him to take... Paige drove down the road in her car. It was s Scion Tc her dad had used for work years before he was forcefully retired. He had given it to her when she left home for college. She was very appreciative for the gesture, seeing as how she was very attached to it. It was a 2006 model with metal flake gray paint. It only had two doors; it was fitting seeing that she didn't have any kids yet. Going down the road driving the speed limit, Paige was looking at the directions to her new house. Her parents thought it would be too big for just one person living there, but as she had explained to them, what seemed like a billion times, some of her friends would room with her. In fact, they should already be there waiting for her to arrive. Her two friends Randy and Kevin. Randy was actually born a girl named Reina, but later in life discovered that she was a man in a girls body. Kevin of course knew all of this and ultimately decided that he didn't care, he didn't really have a preference. The funny thing to Paige was is that Kevin liked Randy even before he came out as transgender. She thought it was very sweet. Kevin and Paige had actually known each other since they were kids. They only stopped talking was when they got to middle school and met other people, but in high school they rekindled their friendship and haven't stopped being friends since. They met Randy in ninth grade, being introduced by some friends. Never once did the trio fight about anything. Only had discussions when other friends fought and end up hating each other. Nope, they were too good for that. Paige couldn't control her excitement to see her friends once more. It had only been a few weeks since she last saw them, but to her it felt like years. They didn't go to the same college as her though, but they also made time for each other. Paige looked at her directions once more and looked a little ways down the road to find the place she had been dying to be. Up close and far away it looked like a hug place to live. 'I 'm so glad I asked Randy and Kevin to stay with me , surely somebody would try to rob me if I were by myself'. ' Pulling up to the driveway, Paige didn't see Randy's 69' Chevy Impala. He was so lucky that it was given to him for free. The sad part was he inherited it from his mother who died from a horrendous car accident. Randy didn't like to talk about it at all. Sometimes you can hear him talk about it in his sleep though. I remember one afternoon talking with Kevin about how Randy had accidentally hurt himself in his sleep right after the incident. ' They must not be here yet' she though as she pulled up to the front door, parked, locked her car up and went to open the door... huh?..HHUUUUHHH? how was it? no flames.[Chapter 2] Chapter2 When Page's hand touch the doorknob, a chill ran down here spine. She paid to mind to it and opened the door. As she stepped inside, Paige looked around. It looked as big inside as it looked outside. After about a few minutes of looking around a creaking noise penetrated her ears. Paige stopped, trying to listen to where it would have came from. Going about half way up the stairs she heard it again. All the way up the stairs the creaking started to get louder. Paige could feel her heart in her throat, ' SOMEBODY'S HERE! I'M GOING TO BE KILLED!' , she thought to herself, but she didn't care. Paige was too driven to see what was making the noise, ' damn my curiosity.' The walk down the hall was slow. With every step the hall seemed to get darker and darker, it even got to the point to where there was a shadow in front of her, almost guiding her. There was a presence with her and not being able to see well made it more nerve wrecking . The smell of stale breathe caught in her nostrils. Out of nowhere a breeze blew over her conver- clad feet rising over her legs onto her arms, giving her goose bumps. Paige's hands even started to shake as she reached for the handle time seemed to slow down. Sweat started to slowly make itself known on her forehead and in the palm of her hands. The hair on her neck raised, it felt as though someone was ghosting a touch over her shoulder, egging her on. As soon as her hand got to the knob WHOOSH! The door flew open and \"RANDY I AM GOING TO KILL YOU!\" Randy stared wide-eyed at Paige for about two seconds before he rushed her. \"Paige! oh I missed you so much, when did you get here?!\" all while squeezing the life from her. Trying to slap his arm off her and failing, \"can't...breathe!\" The tall man set her down \"oh sorry about that!\" Randy rubbed the back of his neck. \"Schwester! (sister)\", yelled Kevin, as he ran up to hug his friend. \"Bruder1!\" After they said all of their hello's, the trio decided to go down to the backyard, where Paige now realized they had parked at. The backyard was a gorgeous scene. Lust green grass, flowers everywhere, and tall wise trees that have seen many years. \" Probably to make up for the fact people died horrendously here.\" The three knew all about the murders here. The loony crime writing dad, the missing daughter, all of it. That was the main reason why her parents didn't want her to move there, people died and the murder may come back for her. She decided it was all nonsense. After scouting out the amazing garden, Kevin, Randy and Paige decided that it would be time to move their stuff into their \"new\" home. Kevin had driven a large moving truck followed by Randy in his Chevy. After putting all the boxes into the house they closed up the truck and headed inside to make dinner. \"Ughhh I'm sooo hungryy! Foooood.\" Whined Randy, Kevin just standing there not really sure what to do. \" I am kinda' am to\" ,he said, while walking over to Paige. \"what do we gots lady!\"' Kevin playfully yelled at her. His eyes scanned the end of the room then back to the 23 year old in front of him. Thankfully, both Paige's and Kevin's parents gave then a little extra for moving-in groceries. They had the basics; fruits, bread, some lunch meats, chips and little treats. \" Well\", she started \" I could make some sandwiches and we could have chips too?\" The couple nodded in unison . After dinner they settled into their rooms. Kevin and Randy settled in the Master bedroom,(the room across from the one she found them in) seeing as how they were a couple and needed more space. Paige decided that she would rather take the first room at the other end of the hall. Paige wanted to be as far away from the other room as possible. Going to see the room should have been a piece of cake. ' Why was it so weird going down that way to that door?' She asked herself, 'Because those noises were creepy as hell and something TOUCHED ME!' Paige rolled her eyes at herself and thought that she was just being dramatic. The door to her bedroom opened, causing her to slightly jump. Randy asked her if she wanted to watch a late-night movie with him and Kevin, but she respectively declined. Paige just wanted to sleep. It was kind of a long day for them and tomorrow they had some real box stuff to take care of. 'Soooo many boxeees!', She complained in to herself. Faint creaking noises made way into her ear. ' Ew'. Paige was glad that she decided not to take a bedroom down their hall. \" I would never be able to sleep' . Soon after her friends' sex-capades had ended and she was soon able to fall into a \"peaceful\" slumber.[Chapter 3] Chapter 3 Randy and Kevin slept very peacefully that night,or at least Randy did. Kevin only pretended to be asleep just so that he wouldn't worry Randy. Kevin starred emptily at the darkest corner in their room. It was only that way because the blinds let in tendrils of light, causing the corner behind it to seem even darker than pitch black itself. He could feel the bunches of little eyes on him,but pretending to not even notice. This was something that happened all throughout his life; seeing things that nobody else could. It was a \"gift\" from his grandmother. Kevin recalled the day that she had sat him down and told him the secrets of his family's past. Eventually, growing to accept this fate seeing there was nothing he could do about besides gouge his own eyes out. Paige was in her blissful sleep when jolted awake by the same chill she had felt earlier in the day. Noticing the extreme cotton-mouth she had, was all the incentive she needed to go downstairs to get herself the cool glass of water her dry mouth craved. Stopping at the frame of her door, she felt the presence once more. Watching.. waiting for her to make her next move. So she indulged it and stepped outward into the hall. What ever she had felt the second before now dissipated, leaving her to continue on. When Paige reached the cupboard she grabbed the biggest glass she could find. When the glass was put against the water dispenser and light appeared so did a face in her peripheral vision. Jumping out of fear caused her to drop the glass, shattering on the floor. Paige bolted as fast as humanly possible up the stairs and abruptly stop at Kevin and Randy's room. She couldn't understand what made her stop and why. Somebody was in this house! After the moment of her hesitation Kevin swung the door open, knowing his friend was there in panic. Kevin eyed Paige, \"there was a man standing right next to you?\" \"yes!\", she hissed at her friend, still in panic mode. \"That you didn't even hear come in the house?\" \"... no I didn't bu\" he cut her off \" that all the sudden wasn't there anymore?\" Paige knew he had a point. Once she told Kevin everything that had happened in the moments past, Kevin had grabbed a nearby baseball bat and they went searching among the big house. They didn't find any trace of a human being with them in the house. \"Well,\" Kevin started, \"you can sleep in here with us. Randy is out like a light and my insomnia will keep me up, so I will be able to hear if any signs of that guy comes back.\" Paige sighed, she knew she was a scared-y cat, but she and Kevin convinced herself that it was all in her head. \" I am such a baby... it was all in my head. New house horrors, that's it!\" she proclaimed in her head. \"No, I'll just go back to my room down the hall. Thank you very much for the tempting offer though.\" Her friend offered her a sincere smile, and she returned it while exiting out of the room. Running to her room, she dove in and slammed the door as quickly as she could. \" real smooth Paige, real smooth.\" Looking around her room, not seeing any abnormalities, Paige crawled back into her loving bed. She inwardly moaned at the warmth of her covers, \" ugghhhh yes, warm! I need this.\" The shadow smiled to themselves, \" what a fun game this will turn out to be.\" Fading back into the welcoming walls of the house. Randy squirmed in his sleep unknowingly as he dreamed of seeing his mothers face. It was almost as if the accident never happened and her death was just a sick trick of the brain. He was running, running to hopefully reunite with her. The faster Randy ran, the further his mother seemed to be. \" Don't ! Wait, please come back mom!\" He shouted. His mother could only give him the same sweet and comforting smile she always gave him in his dreams. Kevin could only watch as his love trembled in his sleep, calling for his lost mother. He silently prayed that one of these days, he would finally catch up to her... - wiggly eyebrows- Am I getting better? Huuuh? -elbows- huuuhhhhhh?! Please review![Chapter 4] Chapter 4 Yay! I have four chapters going. I try to update every day. XD Unknowingly, another person was in Paige's room as she slept. He took it upon himself to be right at her side. Never to leave her again. Of course he was always there to watch over her; he was her silent guardian. One specifically in her dreams. Only to come to her on very special occasions, when she desperately needed to see him. Paige did in fact know this man. Someone very close to the past. The past only few wish to recall. The guardian knew how Paige felt when the events happened. He could hear her every thought, the feelings of loneliness, anger, and the hurt. Ever where she went, he went. Knowing that she was going to be in danger he followed her to this very spot. Knowing the evil in this house, how it wanted to harm her and her friends, he had to help in every way possible a spirit could. Until then, he would watch her sleep in bliss. Just like he did every night. The air was softer in the morning Paige had noticed. She didn't dare open her eyes yet, \" more sleep please!\", she pleaded with herself. During the conversation in her head, Paige had failed to notice her door ajar and two heads poking in. \"WAKE UP!\", Kevin and Randy jumped on her, knocking the air from her lungs. \" wakey wakey, eggs and bacey!\", the kept bouncing. \" AAAWWW you guys suck!\", Paige yelled at them, annoyed that she didn't get her chance to sleep in. Paige loved the comfort and warmth of her bed, and it certain loved her as well. As soon as the jumping stopped, she opened her eyes only to find Randy's face extremely close to hers. Wide eyed she stared at him, taking in his features. A round- ish face accompanied by large green hazel eyes and short and cute nose. Randy cropped his hair short. Paige remembered at time when he had kept it long and eventually cutting into a mohawk. They smiled at each other as the couple got off of her and stood near the doorway. Kevin was the first to speak,\" You promised us pancakes this morning\", Randy chimed in, \"WITH chocolate milk!\" Paige rolled her eyes, still not wanting to leave her bundled sanctuary. \"Fine, fine, fine! Let me get dressed.\" They nodded to her and walked out the door. Randy being the first to leave. Kevin hesitated out the door, looking directly at the corner closest to her bed. Paige was going to ask what Kevin was staring at, but was too late when he abruptly went out her door and down the stairs. Yawning as she got up, Paige stretched her way over to her clothes box and looked for a decent pair of pants, undergarments, and a shirt. She changed and trotted down the steps and into the kitchen. Her friends were so eager for breakfast that they got out all the ingredients waiting for her almost in a perfect line. \" So what I'm seeing here is, you got out ALL the stuff I needed\", she paused. \" But you couldn't get it started?\" They answered as one, \"Nope.\" They smiled at her. After eating their meals in silence, the trio decided it was time to un-pack their stuff and \"officially\" move into the house. They first started by taking every single box out of their cars and the moving truck and placing it the large entry way. The very first thing they put away was the boring stuff; kitchen utensils, paperwork into the office and the furniture in its proper place. Next came clothes and trinkets. Kevin had accidentally taken Paige's underwear box and pulled out one of her nice pairs of panties, shrieked, then proceeded to throw them to the ground. Randy and Paige laughed and shook their heads. After hours of going through and unpacking box after box, they were nowhere near done. Randy looked at all the boxes left to be unpacked, \" Let's put the rest of the boxes upstairs in the attic.\" Paige and Kevin gave each other weird looks, \"why the attic?\" Kevin stiffened, but said nothing. Randy shrugged, \"just a place to get all this out of the way\", his voiced echoed. Before anyone could answer, he picked up three boxes and headed for his destination. Paige could see Kevin's uneasiness, but didn't think to ask him about it until later.[Chapter 5] Getting the boxes was difficult to get up to the attic. There was no real staircase, just a pull-down ladder. Aside from the almost falls, their trips up and down went well. Once all three of them were situated into the attic, organizing and separating boxes, Kevin was the first to speak, \"Now that we have our crap up here we should go.\" His smile was faulty, trying to not give something away. He could feel the evil circling around them and he needed to get them out. Paige wanted to look around. She hadn't seen this part of the house yet and wanted to see if anything had been left behind since the previous owners. She walked up to a far left corner hidden in shadows. \"hey guys, there's a box here\". Before she could inspect it any further a loud thunk echoed in their ears. Randy was halfway down the ladder, \"Nope! I'm outta' here!\" The sudden noise took the breath out of Paige's lungs. She forgot all about the mysterious box and climbed down the creaky ladder. She never noticed the figures all watching her leave. Bughuul watched her go. He knew who his next target would be. This new stranger would bare his child. With this plan he could rule both worlds, have as many souls as he wanted. Paige had forgotten all about the box in the dingy attic and was sitting outside. Her gaze was set on the giant tree that stood proudly in the yard. There was something about it that captured her attention. It hit her. ' That's the tree one of the family members was hung from'. Everyone knew about the murders that had taken place here. By law the realtors had to tell them if death had occurred. It was a chilling thought to know so much had happened here. \"They should have cut the damn thing down\", Paige jumped nearly out of her skin as Randy spoke. His voice was empty and monotone. Her heart ached for him, knowing his mother had taken her own life this way. Randy was the one to find her like that. He was only 9 then. Back inside the house Kevin was trying with all his might to not entertain the spirits around him with his attention. They skirted around corners just seconds before his eyes could catch up. He prayed that they'd soon leave him alone. It was as if they knew he could see them. It was if they wanted his attention, for him to be too curious. He sighed to himself,\" We shouldn't have come here.\" Only a moment had passed until he heard Randy and Paige come inside. He needed to find a way to get them out for good. It was just too hard to find a place this cheap anywhere else. Hours had passed and it was finally dark out. The trio were in their beds asleep. Each tossing and turning in their own horrors. Kevin was running from the small shadows trying to grab him. They wanted him in the abyss with them. Randy was having his nightly terror, forever chasing his mother. Each dream it was always the same. Paige on the other hand dreamt of the box in the attic. Watching each terrible film that lay present inside. The gruesome images flooded her all at once. Each time she tried to look away a force thrusted her head closer to the screen. And then…it all just stopped. The blood filled pictures were replaced with a loving and familiar face. She couldn't quite make it out, but she knew she was safe now. The house was filled with a silent rage. Bughuul wanted his victim to be aware of her future. He wanted her to be afraid. The fear fuled him, made his powers strong. Only now was this other presence known to him. It didn't matter though, he would get what he wanted. This other being would not get in his way.

"},{"Movie":"Sinister","Title":"Broken Pieces II","Author":"AngelicaMyers95","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12060034","Passage":"[Chapter 1] Nathan woke up, covered in sweat. He looked around his room and sighed with relief. It was just a dream. He was about to close his eyes and go back to sleep but then he heard a noise coming from his closet. It wasn't a loud noise, but in the night's dead silence, he was able to hear it. It sounded like a screech. A few moments later, Nathan heard a loud thud from inside the closet and he turned to glance at his bedroom door. His father would yell at him if he came into the room and woke him up. If it turned out to be nothing, he'd only get yelled at, maybe even get a slap or two and his mother would be unable to defend him, as usual. He got up, took a few steps back and grabbed the umbrella that stood by his desk, gripped it with both hands and closed his eyes. You can do this , he thought to himself, how are you going to be a cop one day if you can't even open the closet doors? A few more moments had passed and there was no noise. He sighed in relief again and opened his eyes, but just as he was about to put his umbrella down the noise started again. This time, whoever was in the closet started tapping on the door with their fingers. Nathan grabbed the umbrella again and slowly approached the closet door. The tapping continued, but as he got closer, it got quieter and quieter until it finally stopped. Just as he was about to reach for the handles, the doors began opening slowly by themselves, making him take a step back, lose his balance and fall. -No, please!- he screamed. The doors swung open and someone Nathan couldn't see well jumped at him. -Gotcha, scaredy-cat! Nathan recognized his friend's voice and was now able to see his glowing red eyes. -What the hell are you doing here, Morgan?- Nathan asked nervously, still only inches away from his friend's face- I almost went to my parents' room to tell them about the noise. -Yeah, I know.- Morgan got up- I read your mind. -I wish you wouldn't do that. It's weird. -If it makes you feel better, I don't do it all the time. -Oh sure, that makes me feel much better…- Nathan got back on his feet- -How'd you manage to sneak out again? -I made Lora my special drink again. -Won't having too much of that hurt her? -Nah, it just gets her to sleep a little longer. Anyway, here.- Morgan handed Nathan a small rectangular black box, with a small bow on it- Happy birthday. Nathan reluctantly took the box and just as he was about to open it he looked up at Morgan. -It's not another dead rat, is it? Morgan smiled. -Let's find out, shall we? Open it. -I don't know… -Oh just open it! There's nothing dead or alive in there! - Morgan sighed- You're no fun at all… Nathan opened the box to find a pleasant surprise. His eyes lit up when he saw a police badge that had sheriff engraved on it. -I love it, thank you.- Nathan said with a warmth in his voice. -I knew you would.- Morgan said proudly. -Nathan looked at Morgan again. -You could've given it to me tomorrow at the party. -No I couldn't.- Morgan threw himself on Nathan's bed- Lora got you a pair of jeans and a shirt. -Where'd you get this from then? -It doesn't matter, just enjoy it. No one had to get hurt for you to get it, I promise.- Morgan sat up- Although, you might not want to let anyone see it. They might start asking questions and you can't tell them you got it from me. -I won't say anything… But if I find out that you hurt someone to get it, or worse – -You're gonna do what?- Morgan arched his brow and crossed his arms. Nathan looked down. -Oh boy… Look, I didn't mean to get you down. You'll get tougher in time, I know it. Nathan looked up at Morgan, with a look of confusion on his face. -You're really weird sometimes… -I know, I can't help it. Nathan smiled tiredly and glanced at the clock on his bedside table. He was surprised to see that it was nearly three in the morning. -I should go back to bed. Unlike you, I've got school tomorrow. -Okay, I'm leaving.- Morgan walked to the closet and as he got inside he turned back, looked at his friend and smiled- See you tomorrow at the party. With those words, Morgan closed the closet door behind. He went through a small portal that he'd created, finding himself back in his bedroom. He turned to see that Lora was firmly asleep on a bed across his and hid the picture that served as the portal under his bed's mattress. Morgan got into bed but he couldn't fall asleep, as his thoughts drifted off to his big sister Lilly. She'll be turning seven tomorrow, just like Nathan. Only he won't be able to be with her this year either, which saddened him. He had memories of her when she was three years old but had no idea what she'd look like now. He remembered how she played with him, the few times that they'd gotten the chance. Then he remembered how Lora had told him that it won't be long before his dad and Lilly come to the house to be with them. Even though that thought made him happy, Morgan knew that they'd have to leave the house soon after, possibly go miles away from Nathan whom he'd grown fond of. After all, it seemed like Nathan was the only real friend he had. He liked to tease Nathan as he liked to tease any kid his age or younger, but it was never in a way that would hurt him, especially since he knew what Nathan had to endure from his father on a daily basis. He felt sorry for Nathan and his mom, but Morgan knew he couldn't do anything to help him without getting in trouble. If he'd done anything even remotely suspicious, Lora would take him away someplace else and he hated moving. Just when they'd settle into a nice neighborhood something would happen that would get Lora upset and make her pack up and move. He knew that they were on the run from Lora's father, but Morgan hadn't been able to sense him since he was a baby which is why he found it strange that they'd move so often. Whenever he'd ask Lora about it she'd just say \"Because we have to.\", avoiding to explain anything to him. In all fairness, this was the house that they've stayed at the longest, having been there for nearly four months now. The house itself was pleasant as it hadn't had many previous residents and no one had had anything bad happen to them during their time of living there. To Morgan, it was possibly a perfect home. All he wanted now was for Lilly and his dad to come to live in the house as well and stay there, so they could live their lives like any normal family, although that seemed to be nothing but a fantasy because Morgan knew his father wouldn't stay in the same place for long.[Chapter 2] The following morning, the doorbell rang while Lora was preparing breakfast since Morgan still had quite an appetite for regular food despite needing human souls for survival. -Would you go get the door?- Lora asked. -Sure. Morgan got up from his chair and ran to open the front door. He was a little confused since the person standing before him was a man he'd never seen before. -Hi.- the man spoke- Does Lora live here? I need to see her. -Who's asking? -I'm Ray. -She's never mentioned anyone by that name… Lora ran up to the door. -Ray, what are you doing here? -I'm sorry for dropping by unannounced, but I have the information that you asked for. -And you couldn't have given me a call, because…? -I was in the neighborhood and I had to see you. Lora rolled her eyes. -Alright – Morgan, get back into the dining room, I need to have a talk with Ray here. Morgan didn't have to be told twice to leave, but as soon as he got the chance, he snuck out of the dining room to listen in on Lora's and Ray's conversation. -I can't believe you haven't told him about me.- Ray said, sounding slightly offended. -Why should I tell him about you? You're just a friend helping me out. -I didn't realize that I was 'helping you out' all those nights we'd spent together. -I knew I'd regret it. -I'm sorry. I don't mean to be a jerk, but you obviously like me and there could be something more serious between us if you just let it happen. Why are you being like this? -Because I can't have anything serious with you or with anyone else. My sole priority is protecting Morgan. -I could help you with him. -No, you couldn't. Now please tell me what you know about the dagger's location. Nearly an hour after Ray had left the house, Morgan was helping Lora clean up and he couldn't help it but think of what he'd heard from her conversation with Ray. He looked up at her. -I'm sorry for being a burden on you. Lora was surprised at what Morgan had said. She stopped cleaning the dish and turned to look at him. -Where did you get the idea that you were a burden on me in any way?- she asked. -I know that you like that Ray guy and if it weren't for me you could be with him. -That's not true.- Lora wiped her hands with a cloth- Come here…- she pulled Morgan closer as he came towards her and she smiled at him, placing her hand on his cheek- I love you and Lilly more than anything, okay?- she caressed Morgan's face- You two are my whole world. I wouldn't give you up for anything, not even a chance to have the so-called normal life. -Still, it's not fair. -Once we get our hands on that dagger, all of our troubles will be over.- she kissed him on the forehead- Everything will be alright soon… What are you going to wear to Nathan's birthday party? Morgan shrugged his shoulders. -I don't know… -Let me know so I can get it ready for you, okay? -But what about the dishes? -I'll take care of that, you can go and look for something to wear. A few more hours passed and it was time for Nathan's birthday party. Upon getting there Morgan seemed surprised that there were only two children at the party apart from him and Nathan. Most people present were adults, probably neighbors or relatives. The two kids that were at the party were a year younger than Nathan and they were children of one of the neighbors that lived down the block. Most of the interaction Nathan had had with them were awkward attempts of small-talk so when he saw Morgan, he was relieved since he thought that his presence would make interaction with the other two kids easier. Although, it didn't take long for them to isolate themselves from the guests and go up to Nathan's room so they could talk about their day. Morgan loved hearing about Nathan's days at school since he himself wished he could spend at least one day there. But as Nathan talked Morgan frowned as he noticed a bruise under his eye. -What's that?- he touched Nathan's bruise. Nathan backed away as it seemed that it still hurt him when touched. -He hit you again? -I overslept and I was late for school because of that. -That's no reason for him to hit you! -I can't do anything about it.- Nathan said quietly, almost like he was whispering. -I wish I could do something… -Please don't. It could get you in trouble. -He deserves to know what it's like to get hit. I swear, as soon as I get the chance – -Look, can we just talk about something else, please? -Sure… A few minutes later, Nathan's father opened the door to the bedroom, causing Nathan to stand up in panic. -What are you boys doing here?- he asked- You should be at the party with Ralph and Lindsay. -We'll be right down.- Nathan spoke nervously avoiding eye contact with his father and Morgan saw it. He looked at Nathan's father and nodded, while trying to contain the rage he'd felt towards the man as there had been several occasions when he'd witnessed from the distance Nathan getting hit by him out on the front yard. Morgan couldn't help but lift his gaze whenever Nathan's father would pass by them in the living room and seeing him head to the upstairs bathroom sometime later, Morgan saw the opportunity to get back at him for hurting Nathan. He was confident that he could make it look like an accident. -I need to use the bathroom, I'll be right back.- he said and got up. Morgan rushed out of the living room and ran up to the front of the door to the upstairs bathroom. Moments later, he locked the bathroom door and turned off the lights using his powers. Not wanting to waste any time Morgan teleported into the bathroom since he was still able to see well in the dark. He slammed Nathan's father into the wall in the matter of seconds, making him lose consciousness. A few minutes later Lora went over to the corner where the kids were seated to check on Morgan but she saw that he wasn't there. -Where's Morgan?- she asked Nathan. -He needed to use the bathroom. -How long has he been in there? -I don't know… A couple of minutes maybe. -I'm right here. Lora turned upon hearing Morgan speak and saw him wave at her. -You need to relax a little.- he sat down next to Nathan. About fifteen minutes later Nathan's mother told everyone to gather in the dining room since she was about to bring out the cake. Before lighting the candles she wanted to tell her husband to get the camera but she couldn't find him in any of the downstairs rooms so she headed upstairs. She checked to see if he was in the bathroom first thinking he'd most likely be there since the downstairs bathroom could've been occupied. She knocked on the door and called for him but there was no response. She reached for the door handle and was surprised to see that the door wasn't locked. A look of horror and dread formed on her face as she saw her husband bent over the bathtub with blood dripping from his head. After the shock had passed her, she screamed and ran to check his pulse. She sighed with relief upon seeing that her husband was still alive. A few moments later he'd even started to regain consciousness but all he could do was groan in pain. It wasn't long before Nathan's mother let out that scream that everyone joined her in the bathroom and helped her get Nathan's father to the bedroom as well as call the ambulance. After the ambulance was called, Lora went to tell the kids that Nathan's father had been hurt but that he should be well once the paramedics take care of him. While explaining the situation to them, she noticed Morgan's lips forming into a smile for a split second making her think instantly that he had something to do with what had happened.[Chapter 3] Lilly woke up upon hearing her name being whispered in unison. She opened her eyes to see three kids standing before her bed. The tallest one was a blonde girl in a blue dress that was up to her knees. Beside her stood a black-haired boy who looked to be about six and he was dressed in dirty rags. The third one was another girl with short black hair, who wore a long black dress that had the spider's web application sewn on all over it and she was holding a jack-o-lantern shaped bucket that had a super 8 film in it. -What are you guys doing here?- Lilly sat up in her bed. -Your dad's away with the new boy since he'd just finished filming so we thought we could come by and wish you a happy birthday.- the blonde girl said. -That's sweet of you guys, but I don't want you getting caught here with me, you know he doesn't like it when I spend time with you. -We know.- the black-haired girl said- We'll be out of here soon, we just wanted to give you this.- she took the film out of her bucket and handed it to Lilly. -I appreciate this, but you know that I don't like to watch those kind of films. -We know, but this may be something that you'll like after all.-the boy said. -Bye Lil.- the children spoke in unison again and vanished into thin air moments later. -Bye…- Lilly uttered quietly as she stared the unlabeled film in her hands. Knowing that her father would be away for hours since he'd have to show the new boy how to properly edit his film, Lilly set up the projector so she could watch the one she was given. The first image was a writing that read 'HAPPY BIRTHDAY LILLY'. It was written in capital letters on a pavement with chalk which summoned a smile on her face. The next frame made her eyes widen in surprise as she now saw her mom, looking slightly younger than she remembered her, holding hands with her dad. She was wearing a big white dress, with hints of black here and there. Even her dad was dressed in more formal clothing. It didn't take long for her to realize that this was their wedding ceremony. In the close-ups on her mom's face, Lilly was able to see just how happy she was in that moment. Having this footage made it possible for Lilly to witness it directly and it didn't take her long to jump into the frame which enabled her to hear what they were speaking as well. It was the moment her parents were bound to each other for all eternity and it was a sweet and touching moment for her. There was so much love in her mother's eyes as well as her father's voice as he spoke his vows and it summoned a warm smile on her face as well as a few tears. The next scene seemed to take place possibly hours after Lilly's birth. Her mom was sitting on the bed and singing softly to her. Looking around, Lilly couldn't recognize the bedroom so she figured they must've lived someplace else around that time. A few moments later, her dad came into the picture. -You should put her in the crib, I can see that she's asleep.- he said gently. -I can't. I've been waiting for her for so long, I don't want to part from her, ever. -You do realize you'll only be putting her in the crib next to our bed? Her mom looked up at her dad. -Don't tease me.- she said, sounding a bit tired. -I'm not teasing you.- her dad touched her mom's face- I can see that you're tired, which is understandable after the long hours you spent in labor. -You're just saying that because you want to hold her. -That's not the reason.- her dad didn't sound all that convincing- Although, I wouldn't mind it.- he admitted. -I knew it! -Just give her to me, you need to rest. She'll still be here when you wake up. Lilly saw her mom give in a few moments later and hand her over to her dad. She suddenly found herself in the living room of their old house, by the piano. In the scene she was observing, her younger self was already able to sit on her dad's lap and couldn't help it but tap on the piano. -Let's try this – I'll play something and you repeat it. -Okay daddy!- baby Lilly exclaimed and smiled. Lilly watched as her dad played a few notes and saw younger self clumsily try to repeat the melody and then giggle. -I did it!- baby Lilly turned to face her dad but since he wasn't responding her smile faded away quickly- I did it wrong… I'm stupid… -No sweetheart, you did it well.- he caressed baby Lilly's hair- I just… I love you so much. -I love you too daddy!- baby Lilly excitedly wrapped her arms around her dad's neck, gave him a peck on the cheek and then looked at him again- So, I was good? -You were great and I'll help you get even better. Play something on your own again sweetheart, I'd love to hear it. -Okay. Not long after baby Lilly finished playing her own song her mom soon entered the scene and clapped. -You must be very proud since she's got clearly got your musical talent. -Don't tell me that you're jealous...- her dad laughed. -I'm not, I think it's cute.- her mom placed her hands on her dad's shoulders- It won't be long before I'm treated to piano concerts from you two. Only moments later the happy image Lilly saw vanished and she left the frame, only to see that the projector was off. -Why are you out of bed? Lilly flinched upon hearing her dad's voice and turned to see him sitting on her bed. -I'm sorry…- Lilly nervously played with her nightgown. Bughuul took the film into his hand. -And what's this? -That's… -I'm not mad, I just want to know how you got this. -The other kids just wanted to give me a birthday present, please don't scold them. Bughuul sighed. -I told you that they'd get punished if I caught you with them again. -Please don't hurt them. As another birthday gift to me. -Alright, I won't. I actually have some good news, we're going to visit Lora and Morgan. Lilly's eyes lit up and she took a few steps towards the bed. -How long will we be staying with them?- she asked excitedly. -I don't know yet. We'll see what their living situation is like and we'll figure out what to do from there.- Bughuul gently pulled Lilly closer and placed her on his lap. -When will we be leaving?- she laid her head on his chest. -As soon as I'm done getting the film ready with the Lanchester boy. Lilly couldn't help it but think of the twelve year-old boy she'd only watched from the distance occasionally. Her mind filled with dread again as she thought what he could've possibly done to his family and what they were like in their final moments. Bughuul began to sense Lilly drifting away, regretting that he'd even mentioned the boy. -Don't worry about them sweetheart, they're not worth it. -They were good people. -They weren't, they just hid their problems better than most families. They had secrets that they tried very hard to conceal. Secrets that that boy knew about. -Only because you had the other kids tell him. -He would've found out soon enough anyway. Besides, he's not important…- Bughuul caressed Lilly's hair- Tell me, did you enjoy the gift the kids brought you? -It was nice. I'd never seen anything similar before except maybe some photos… -They used to visit until you grew a little older and I told them to stop since I didn't want any of them interacting with you. -Because of what they did? Bughuul nodded. -Were they the ones filming what I saw? -Yes. I allowed them to do it mostly because your mom didn't mind it, but even then I didn't let them do it for long. -Why didn't you take the footage with you? The films were well shot. -I know. I just didn't want you seeing the films and then getting lost in them. I was afraid you may want to spend too much time watching them and that I'd lose you eventually, that you wouldn't want to spend time with me anymore because you'd yearn for the times when your mother was alive. Lilly looked at Bughuul. -I love you daddy.- she touched his cheek and smiled- I'd never leave you for the chance to observe the past on a loop. I want to believe we can be happy again with Morgan and Lora and make new happy memories. Bughuul hugged Lilly. -Hopefully things will be better for us soon…- he said.[Chapter 4] Lora couldn't sleep. She felt responsible for what had happened to Nathan's father because she wasn't watching Morgan. A part of her knew that it wasn't her fault at all but there was another part of her that just wouldn't give her peace that kept shouting 'If you'd kept a better eye on Morgan this wouldn't have happened!'. Morgan lay on the other bed, still pleased with what he'd done to Nathan's father. Even after Lora confronted him about it he was unable to hide his happiness. The violent scene that took place in the bathroom played over and over in Morgan's head making him sleepless. -I know why I'm not sleeping.- Lora spoke and Morgan was surprised that she could tell that he was awake all the way from her bed- Why aren't you? Morgan shrugged. -I just can't sleep. -Is guilt starting to announce itself yet?- she sounded almost hopeful. -I don't know why you care if he becomes paralyzed or not, no one is going to suspect me and he couldn't see me. Even if he had seen me I don't think anyone would believe that a small child could do what I'd done to him. Lora sat up in her bed furiously. -I'm worried because you took pleasure in hurting the man!- she snapped. Morgan turned still laying in his bed, now facing Lora's bed. -He's a monster and he hurt the only friend I have who didn't deserve his cruelty. I'd torture him endlessly if I could just so he could see what it's like to be tortured for no reason. -It doesn't matter how bad he is, you should never want to stoop down to his level. -I am the son of a monster, why shouldn't I be the same way? It's my birthright. -There's always a choice. -I know, and I choose cruelty. Lora instantly began to feel sick. She looked at Morgan and this awful act had changed him, maybe even taken away his childlike innocence. The way he spoke now reminded her of Bughuul all too well. Now she felt like she'd fallen miserably at raising Morgan. -So are you going to murder me now?- there was no fear in his voice as he asked her that question- End me just so I don't do any more damage? -I'll never stop loving you, Morgan. I would never hurt you, I think you're very aware of that… I've tried so hard to make you good but I guess there's just some things you can't change. -I've been like this since birth. I've always taken pleasure in playing sinister games and hurting others for fun. Especially the ones who deserved it. -I'm just begging you to resist your urges until we settle this thing with Moloch, okay?- Lora's voice began to break. She couldn't believe what she was saying and just how calmly she'd said it. Lora got up from her bed and just as she walked over to the bedroom door and opened it she screamed as she came face to face with Bughuul- You scared the living shit out of me!- Lora tried to catch her breath. -I'm sorry but Lilly wanted us to use the door. I wanted to just teleport here. -I don't think that would've been much better.- Lora said. She lowered her gaze and saw Lilly standing next to Bughuul. It gave her strength to repress her tears. -I'm so glad to see you! You've grown so much since the last time I saw you! -she picked Lilly up- And you've gotten heavier too!- Lora kissed Lilly's cheeks repeatedly and embraced her- I've missed you so much! -I've missed you too, Lo!- Lilly noticed Morgan standing behind them- Morgan? -I thought you've forgotten about me. Lora put Lilly down so she could go over to Morgan. -Are you kidding me? I think about you all the time!- Lilly ran up to hug her brother- I have so much to tell you! -Me too! As they excitedly talked about the small adventures they'd had while being apart, Lora turned to Bughuul and hugged him taking him by surprise but he hugged her back moments later. -I'm so glad you're here.- she whispered with noticeable desperation in her voice. -I take it that Morgan was hard to handle? Lora pulled away. -He's becoming more twisted and it's only reached the surface recently. I've seen signs, but now it's – -What did you expect from him, exactly? Both you and I knew he was that way since birth. -I was hoping he'd be more like Lilly… -Have you forgotten who his parents are? -Look, I still love him and that's never going to change, but I'm worried what this reckless behavior might cost him later. -Again, he is my son… -You're pretty proud that he turned out like this, aren't you?- Lora crossed her arms. -I'd be lying if I said that I wasn't… What did he do exactly? -He hurt one of our neighbors pretty badly. The man may not be able to walk after what Morgan had done to him. -Why did he do it? -Because of a friend. The man he hurt is his friend's father. -So he was just protecting his friend, what's the harm? -I need some rest…- Lora rubbed her forehead. -You're right. Go into the other bedroom and rest, I'll be here with them tonight. -Thank you. Once Lora headed over to the spare bedroom, Bughuul joined his kids on Morgan's bed. -What are you talking about?- he asked- Hopefully Lilly isn't complaining about me too much. -Just a bit, but I think what you did was awesome!- Morgan exclaimed- I hope I can go with you the next time you get one of the kids to do it. I have some great ideas. -Maybe once this mess is over… Lora's pretty upset over what you did. -I don't know why she's so upset. Nathan gets beaten by his father every day for the stupidest reasons. He's a good kid, he'd never do anything I would do. Bughuul laughed. -And yet you two are friends? -He's fun to talk to. He wants to be a cop when he grows up so he can catch as many bad guys as he can. I think that's cool. -He sounds nice.- Lilly said. -He's great, I can't wait for you to meet him. -I don't think that's such a great idea…- Bughuul said. -Why not?- Morgan frowned. -We won't be staying here for long, there's no reason for her to interact with your friend. -I knew that we wouldn't be staying here for long after your return!- Morgan fussed- Why do we have to move away anyway? -You know why, Morgan.- Bughuul sounded strict. -I don't want to leave Nathan, I'm the only friend he's got. -I'm sorry about your friend, but you and your sister are my priority. -Can't Nathan come along with us? Maybe I can convince him to kill his dad and we can bring him along. -You just said that he's a good kid, why would he do something like that? -He wouldn't, but if I talked to him about it – -Has your sister told you what happens to the children that I capture? -I know what you do to them, but I was hoping that you would make an exception for me. -If I did that, there would be no need for him to make any form of offering. -Okay, but if you consume bits of his soul, he'd still be around, right? -Yes, he'd still be around. -Then why won't you take him along? I'll get him to kill his dad for you when his mom's out of the house and we can take him after that. -Why would you do that? -His mom's a good person. And I know he loves her a lot and would never want to hurt her, that's why. -Then he doesn't have what it takes, I'm sorry. He needs to murder them both. -Why won't you make an exception?- Lilly asked- We never ask you for much. -I can't drag this kid along just because you two want company. From now on you'll have each other. I may allow occasional, supervised interaction with the ghost kids, but that's it. After that, Morgan and Lilly saw no point in arguing with their father much. Lilly said that she was tired and Morgan agreed so everyone went to their separate beds. Both of them pretended to be asleep. Lilly was afraid for what the future might bring them now that they're together and Morgan was determined to get Nathan to come along with them, one way or another. Even though he knew there wasn't much time left for him to convince Nathan to make the sacrifice, Morgan was determined to get him to do it.[Chapter 5] The following morning, Bughuul was in the kitchen with the kids and since they all agreed that they should let Lora sleep longer both Lilly and Morgan agreed to have cereal for breakfast, although that didn't stop them from making a mess in the kitchen. Despite the plan to let Lora sleep longer she woke up during breakfast and once she got dressed she headed over to the kitchen. Upon entering, she was taken by surprise since Bughuul didn't look like he normally did. He looked human. His hair was still long and black, but he had lips and eyes that were bright blue but slightly sunken in. He was wearing a plain red shirt and a pair of jeans which summoned a smile on Lora's face. -What?- Bughuul frowned, having noticed that Lora was looking at him- Do I have something on my face? -No, you're fine. I've just never seen you like this before. -That's because this form of disguise takes a lot more energy. I only took it because I thought it would be necessary if I want to blend in while we're here. -And what's it like for you?- Lora asked. -It's not good. -I think you look good in human form. -It's still not worth it. Not to mention that what I'm wearing is the least distasteful combination I was able to find in the previous house that could fit me. It certainly wouldn't have been my first choice. -Well, I could take you shopping if you want. -I may be in human form but I'd like to keep my contact with people to a minimum. I'd rather you pick something out for me. -Alright, but you'll have to wear whatever I get you. -I trust you won't make me look like a fool. -Don't worry, you'll be in good hands.- Lora chuckled. -So we'll be going to the mall?- Lilly asked excitedly. Lora nodded. -I'd rather skip this trip to the mall and stay with dad.- Morgan said. -Okay. I guess it'll just be me and Lil then. Sometime in the afternoon, Lora left the house with Lilly to go to the mall, leaving Bughuul and Morgan alone. -Are you okay?- Bughuul asked- You look like something's troubling you. -I'm fine…- Morgan nervously tapped on his knees while staring at the clock- I just have to go to the bathroom. He rushed out of the living room and headed for the stairs. -Stop.- Bughuul said firmly and Morgan turned to him, having already climbed several steps. -I really have to go. -You're lying. I know you're going to your room so you could teleport to your friend's house. -I don't know what you're talking about… Bughuul took a few steps towards Morgan. -I found your secret portal last night. -That portal you found isn't mine.- Morgan lied- I don't even know how to create portals. -Morgan, I'm not angry with you.- Bughuul said calmly- I just need you to stay away from that boy. -Why? He's a good kid. -I don't trust humans, especially not ones like him. -That's not fair! You trusted mom, she was human when you met! -She gave me a good reason to trust her. Your friend will never be like us. -Nathan won't hurt any of you if I asked him not to. -That's what you think. He can't do much now but he will be capable of hurting you when he's older. -I hate you!- Morgan screamed and stormed off to his bedroom, locking the door behind. Bughuul sighed and headed upstairs wanting to keep an eye on Morgan but before he could even reach the upstairs hallway, the doorbell rang. Bughuul rolled his eyes. It was too soon for Lora and Lilly to return, it had to be some nosy neighbor. -MORGAN, SOMEONE'S AT THE DOOR!- he shouted. -I DON'T CARE! YOU OPEN IT!- Morgan screamed and turned up his music so much that Bughuul could hear it now. The doorbell rang again and Bughuul groaned. He wasn't even sure he'd be able to act human. The doorbell rang the third time and Bughuul thought it could be something important for Lora so he went to open the door. A man who looked to be about Lora's age stood before him. Bughuul couldn't help it but frown at what the man was wearing as well as at his general appearance. His hair was dark-blonde and went a little under his ears when it came to length. -Um, is Lora here?- he asked frowning in confusion at the sight of Bughuul. Bughuul didn't respond and just slammed the door shut. He wasn't entirely sure why that was since he knew that the man wasn't a threat, but he immediately regretted opening the door. There was a knock on the door again. -Um, hello?! If she's there I'd like to talk to her please! Bughuul reached for the doorknob and only opened the door halfway through. -Look, she's not here. Come by in another three hours… Bye!- he closed the door again and sighed- This was a bad idea…- he mumbled to himself. Bughuul waited for the man to leave but he just sat on the front porch. Not wanting to bother with him since he was definitely harmless, Bughuul headed to Morgan's bedroom. The music was still abnormally loud but Morgan wasn't in the room anymore. Bughuul figured he must've had another secret portal that he managed to hide well but he didn't doubt for a second that Morgan had gone to visit Nathan so he decided to go there himself. -We need to do something or my dad will keep us apart!- Morgan shook Nathan. -I get that, but I can't just leave my mom.- Nathan backed away. -She'll be fine now that your dad's in the hospital. Nathan turned to Morgan, looking a bit scared. He wanted to ask Morgan whether he'd been the one to hurt his dad but he was afraid how his friend might react. -We can show my dad that you can be trusted. –Morgan got a little closer to Nathan- You want to be a cop, right? Well, sometimes cops have to kill bad guys. -This isn't the same…- Nathan nervously rubbed his elbows, his eyes now fixated on the floor. Morgan sensed just how nervous Nathan was and decided to catch him off guard and drag him off to his newly created netherworld. -You're coming with me either way!- Morgan pulled Nathan towards his portal as close as he could since he was struggling. -Morgan, stop! I don't want to go with you! -You'll see that this is for the best! -No!- Nathan struggled to get out of Morgan's grasp- Let go of me! Moments later, Nathan felt a cold hand on his shoulder and froze in place. -Morgan…?- Nathan's voice trembled. Morgan saw his father clutch Nathan by the shoulder and firmed his grip on the hand he was pulling him by before. -Let him go!- he protested. -You were supposed to stay in your room. Nathan shivered again as Bughuul still had a grasp on his shoulder but hearing that voice his curiosity got the best of him and he looked up finding himself face to face with Bughuul. He wanted to scream but for some strange reason he couldn't let out a sound. The man standing before him didn't fit the description Morgan had given him, not even close. He looked human but there was still a sense of uneasiness and fear on Nathan's part as he stared at him. There was something about his eyes that made Nathan keep his eyes locked on him in horror. The longer he stared at Bughuul the weaker he felt. -Leave him alone!- he heard Morgan shout but only barely before everything turned to black for him. ","Summary":" Nathan woke up, covered in sweat.

I am going to try my hand at the new Sinister 2 movie. So here it is. The Protector *This story starts at almost the end* A girl stands in the center of the room and watches as her mother and brothers' have once again been dragged back into this cursed house. The girl, who looks to be about twelve with brown colored eyes and dark brown hair, narrows her eyes at the slap her 'father' just delivers to her mother's face. She, glides away from the scene, moving towards her younger brothers'; who from the look of it were also arguing about something. The girls' eyes widen as Zach punches Dylan in his chest, knocking him down and Dylan just looks up at him in shock. \"Weakling! That's what you are, a weakling; that's why you rejected their gift!\" As her brother says this, children began to appear behind him; making the girl stare at these new 'guests' in the house. 'What is going on here?' She wonders, watching as the oldest looking boy grabs Zach's shoulder and whispers something in his ear. Zach nods and then sneers at Dylan, who is still on the ground, \"Well weakling, see you later. Let's hope that Anna will be happy to see you.\" Dylan's eyes widen in fear, and Anna's eyes narrow to slits at the threat. 'Brother or not, Zach, I will get ahold of you and slap you seven ways from Sunday when I get the chance.' Her inner voice hisses. Zach walks away and Dylan cries once he is sure his brother is far enough away to not hear him. As he cries, he hears a voice call him, \"Dylan, come to me. Come to big sister, Dylan.\" Snapping him out of his misery and causing him to look around, not that he could see Anna standing there. \"Anna? Is that you?\" Dylan whispers, hoping that his older sister was really there and it wasn't just a figment of his imagination. \"Yes Dylan, now go to my body little one.\" Anna whispers in his ear, making him jump but nod and get up heading to the room his sisters body was. Going quietly into the room, the only thing that made any noise is the life support machine's beeps that told everyone that Anna was alive. \"Anna? Where are you?\" He whispers. \"I am right here, little one.\" Anna's voice calls from behind, causing Dylan to whirl around and see an image shift into view, this image being his older sister; the only one who had protected him from his 'father'. Dylan's eyes water, \"Anna…Anna, I've missed you so much!\" He whispers loudly, moving towards her. Anna's eyes show regret, \"I've missed you too, little one. I am so sorry for leaving you with those fools we call parents.\" \"It's not your fault, I should have been stronger! You took the hit that was meant for me! Plus, mom isn't so bad.\" Dylan starts at a loud whisper and ends with his voice almost completely gone. \"No, little one. I took that hit to protect you and I will never regret that. As for our 'mother', if she was such an amazing mother she would have protected us better.\" Anna states remembering all the times her mother could have took them away and ran, instead she stayed and kept repeating that it would better; until finally Anna had had to step in and look where she was now, in her death bed. Dylan just stares and wonders if she was right, after all Anna had never lied to him or Zach before; in fact, she was always blunt, usually getting her in fights with their mom. \"What do I do Anna, Zach is gearing up to kill us with the help of a Deity and his children?\" Dylan asks her, tears starting to weld back up in his eyes. Anna blinks and realizes that the kids she had seen before must be the Deity's children, \"Well what does this deity want?\" Dylan remembers what Milo and the other kids had said, about killing their parents and Bughuul taking them to his realm; and tells his sister all about this. Anna listens, before saying, \"Well…I think you need to watch him. Protect yourself Dylan, and don't worry about mom and dad. If what you said is right, then I wish you would have gone with their offer and just watched the video.\" She holds up her hand before he can argue, \"Let me explain. Like I stated before mom isn't as perfect as she seems and dad is a danger to us all, as proven by the fact that I am dying and the only thing keeping me alive is that life system. I want you to have someone to protect you and yes, Zach too.\" Dylan nods, \"But they plan to kill one of us, right? So doesn't that defeat your statement of having someone to protect us?\" Anna begins to reply, only to have her 'father' voice cut her off, \"Dylan, are you in Anna's room? What have I told you about bothering your sister?\" He calls harshly, making Dylan shake. \"Sorry Anna, I got to go.\" Dylan stammers, before running off down the stairs. Anna watches him go, and growls when she hears the faint 'smack' from downstairs, 'I am going to kill them, especially for the mistreatment of my brothers'.' She thinks before disappearing.[Chapter 2] Disclaimer: I, Luna loves u, do not own anything but my oc Anna. To my reviewers: Jessica: I am happy to see that the Sinister Fanfiction is growing as well, hopeful it will begin to grow even more. I plan on making this story somewhat short, but it'll be fast paced. Hope you keep enjoying it. St0rmyskies: I will be continuing soon. Thank you for the comment, after all I got some of my inspiration to write this story from reading your Sinister fanfictions; especially your New Chain one. So I hope you keep reading and enjoying this story! Now on with the story: Anna, who had been stewing over what to do the past two days, was watching as her family was sitting outside and having what looked to be a picnic. She was worried because she couldn't find Zach and she knew that he was ready, after all he had always been smart and now he had a way to channel that brain power. Dylan was with the parents and seemed to be looking for Zach as well. Anna, knowing that none could see her, floats over to Dylan side and leans over to his ear, \"Dylan…\" Dylan jerked, making the parents look at him with confusion only to be waved off, \"Anna is that you?\" He asks in a whisper tone. \"Yes little one. Have you seen Zach?\" She asks, only to get a shake of the head, \"That's not good. Dylan, I want you to not let you guard down.\" Dylan nods and asks, \"What do you think he is planning?\" Anna shakes her head and says, \"I don't know, but I know that you are in danger.\" She narrows her eyes, as she looks down; but something catches her eyes, a tint of green in the glass of her brother, \"Dylan, have you drank any of that?\" She points to his glass. Dylan looks down and shakes his head, \"No, I was about to but then you asked me about Zach. Why?\" Anna nods and says, \"Good, I think I just figured out how he plans to start his plans. Do NOT drink or eat anything, do you hear me Dylan?\" Dylan just blinks in confusion, but nods and leaves the drink where it is. At that moment, their 'father' looks back over and asks, \"Why haven't you touched your food or drink, Dylan? And where is your brother?\" Dylan nervously sweats and says, \"I just am not very thirsty, or hungry at the moment. I think that Zach is somewhere around here.\" The father's eyes narrow, \"Oh and when do you think you will be thirsty or hungry, later when there will be nothing for you to eat? I don't think so; you will eat now.\" Anna, who was still beside Dylan, growls, 'I think that that is enough out of you.' She then floats down beside Dylan and, as if by magic, she disappears. Dylan, who had stilled for a moment, snapped his eyes back open. However instead of the fearful look that he usually held in his eyes, there was a look of pure anger and hatred, \"Dear 'father', I would love if you would step back and away from my baby brother, NOW!\" Anna hisses, letting her 'father' know exactly who it was that was talking to him. Clint jerked back, along with Courtney who was behind him, and stared wide eyed at his son in front of him, 'How…What…' He couldn't comprehend the voice coming out of his son's mouth. \"Oh, whatever is the matter 'father'? Not happy to hear from your daughter? The same daughter that you put in a coma?!\" She hisses out. Clint just gaps for a few minutes, before realizing that this was his younger son and he was using his oldest twin sister's voice to try to scare him, \"How dare you YOU LITTLE BRAT!\" He then makes the move to slap him, only to stop when Anna gives him an icy, hot glare and replies, \"How dare I? HOW DARE YOU ATTEMPT TO INJURE ANOTHER ONE OF US, ISN'T IT ENOUGH THAT I LIE IN A BED, NEVER TO WAKE; NOW YOU WANT TO DO IT TO MY LITTLE ONE?! I don't think so!\" As Anna speaks, her tone increases to a slight loud tone before returning to her quiet hissing one. She then gets up and walks Dylan away from them, but not before turning and saying, \"I hope you two enjoyed our suffering, cause I sure am going to enjoy yours.\" And with those last words, she heads back to the house, ignoring the sound of the dropping bodies and running feet. \"DYLAN!\" Zach calls out from behind them. Anna turns and looks at her brother, who is glaring along with all the children around him, \"Yes Zach? What do you need?\" \"You know what I need. I needed you to drink that drink and go to sleep! Now do it, or would you rather I force you too?\" Zach asks smirking, thinking that Dylan will cower and willingly drink the drink. Anna laughs, making Zach narrow his eyes, \"And you think that I will just let him drink that?\" Zach's eyes widen, \"Let Him? Who are you?! And why are you protecting that weakling?!\" Anna just stares with more humor at her other twin, \"Maybe the question is why aren't you, baby brother, protecting the baby of us?\" Zach's eyes widen, \"Anna…is that you Anna?!\" Anna smirks at the children around her, \"Wouldn't you like to know. Oh well, see you in a bit baby brother and company.\" Before turning and running into the house and up the stairs to her room. Zach can only stand there in shock, watching as Anna uses Dylan's body to run away from them. \"Zach, who was that? And what did she mean the youngest of us?\" Milo asks, also watching the running boy; trying to comprehend the fact that it wasn't Dylan who was just talking to them. \"Anna was the oldest of us, she always protected us and one day our 'father' decided that he didn't like how Dylan responded to his question. He lifted his hand and balled it up into a fist, before bringing it down on Dylan. Only it didn't meet Dylan, as Anna got in the way and took the hit for Dylan. Except what our 'father' didn't know is that Anna and Dylan where standing in front of a sharp corner and Anna hit her head on it. We rushed her to the hospital, with 'father' giving some excuse about it being an accident with her getting caught by one of his blows in training and hitting a sharp corner. Of course, the nurse sucked that up and cooed over him, as a poor father. But the worst part is that when the doctor came out, he told us that Anna had suffered from brain trauma and was in a coma; one that she probably wouldn't come out of. I think our 'father' thought it would keep us in line, because he brought her home and keeps her on life support in the attic.\" Zach explains, making the kids around him glare at the man in question. \"So what you are telling us, is that that was your comatose sister? How is that even…\" Ted asks, one of the other children, only to be cut off by Emma. \"We need to follow her... him...them! We are close on time!\" She says. Milo nods in agreement, \"Lead the way to Anna's room.\" Zach nods and they go into the house and up the stairs, heading to Anna's room.[Chapter 3] Luna Loves U: Hey, I am sorry for the long wait for this chapter. I have been working hard to continue being a college student, after I let my grades slip to much and I am just now in a position to write the next chapter. Disclaimer: I own nothing, except for Anna. The children crept into the house and walked to the bottom of the stairs leading to the attic. \"Anna?\" Zach calls up the stairs, \"Anna!\" The children around him stare, and wonder why they aren't just going up the stairs. \"Zach? Why can't we just go up?\" Emma asks, walking behind him and looking up the stairs. \"Anna was always particular about who entered her room, in fact she once pushed our mother down the stairs.\" Zach explains, remembering the day and how upset his father had been. The children just looked at him in shock, \"She really pushed her down the stairs, just for entering without permission?\" Milo asks. \"Yeah, I've never seen my father as angry as that. But Anna just glared at him and laughed at his 'that's your mother' speech. She even threatened to push him down the stairs, if he didn't get out.\" Zach explains, \"She isn't answering, so we can only hope that she is giving us permission to enter.\" They walked up the stairs and opened the door, nervously peeking in to the room, hoping not to be greeted with a shove. But all they could see and hear was what looked like a body on the bed and the beeping of a machine. \"Anna? Are you here?\" Zach called, making the other kids look at him. Chuckling sounded through the room, \"I'm right here, little one.\" Anna says from the far corner of the room, that was shrouded by darkness. Zach whirled towards the direction that Anna's voice came from, \"Anna…\" Anna steps out of the shadows and smiles at her brother, \"Hey little one, nice to see you.\" Zach's eyes widen, as Anna materializes from thin area, \"What…How…How are you here?\" \"I've been here the entire time. I've was always here, watching, waiting for the perfect time to show myself to you and Dylan.\" She replies, before her eyes narrow and she hisses out, \"But, from what I've seen in the past few days, I don't know if I am happy to finally be able to talk to you or not.\" Zach flinches at her visible anger, her face twisting into an unpleasant sneer, \"Anna…please don't be mad at me.\" He says, trembling from the tears that are gathering in his eyes. Anna's face smooths out and she gains a soft look on her face, \"Don't worry little one, I am not so mad at you.\" Her face then gains a more serious look, \"However, I am not happy with how you have been treating Dylan.\" Zach's face scrunches up, \"Why do you always defend him?! Isn't he the reason you are in that bed?!\" He cries, pointing to the now visible body in the bed with a machine hooked to it to keep it alive. Anna just shook her head, \"It wasn't his fault Zach, it was that 'man's' fault. He is the one who always attacked us, all blame lays with him for my coma.\" Zach begins to open his mouth, only for Milo to cut him off, \"Enough Zach, don't forget why we're here.\" Zach snaps his mouth closed and nods. Milo then turns to Anna, \"Give us Dylan and we will leave you for last.\" Anna, who had watched the interaction between Zach and the oldest boy, looked at Milo and blinked, before throwing her head back and laughing. Milo and the other children looked unnerved at her laughing and turned to look at each other. Anna's laughter stopped suddenly and she snaps her head back towards them, \"I don't think so, but what you can do is summoning the boogieman for me. I want to speak with him.\" The children blink at her in shock, before looking at each other and back at her, \"Summon the boogieman? Are you serious, girl?\" Milo asks, looking at her like she is crazy. \"I am, now bring him here, as I have something to talk to him about.\" Anna orders. Milo looks at her for a couple more minutes, before nodding to Catherine, who runs off downstairs, \"She will bring him, I hope you understand what you just asked for girl.\" Anna just look at him, \"I'll be fine, boy.\" The room falls into silence, with the only noise being the beeping noise of the machine. After a few minutes however, the sound of heavy footstep can be heard coming up the stairs. The children all look towards that sound, before Milo smirks at Anna, \"I hope you are ready for what you asked for.\" Anna just glares, before gulping and watching the door, as the footsteps get closer. The footstep come to the top of the step before stopping and the door opens slowly, creaking as it opens. Anna gasps, as she is meet with a man that is tall, with shoulder length black hair and hollowed out features in his face. Anna stares, before thinking, 'I hope that I know what I asked for too.\"[Chapter 4] Luna Loves u: Hey, so good news I believe I have pulled my GPA and will be able to continue as a college student! _Chapter 4 *All conversation between Anna and Bughuul is telepathic* Anna continues to stare at the man that the girl brought with her, 'So this is the boogieman? I see why Dylan was scared of him, he looks…. creepy.' Suddenly, a male voice pierces through her thoughts, 'So you are the girl who is throwing a wrench in my plans? My child has told me that you wish to speak to me?' Anna flinched, 'What. How?!' She looks into the eyes, or what she thinks are eyes, of the boogieman. She thought that she could see a slight smirk on the boogieman's face. Seeing that smirk snaps her out of her shock, 'Your child is correct, I do wish to speak with you.' The Boogieman's head tilted at the change of tone, 'What do you wish to speak with me about?' 'I wish to speak with you about a chance for both my brothers to live.' Anna says, staring into the eyes of the man. Bughuul laughs at this, making it echo in Anna's mind, 'What could make me consider such a proposition? Why shouldn't I just kill you now, along with your brothers, and wait for the next family?' Anna smirks, 'Why do that when you can have two souls, instead of just one?' 'Two souls? What about you child, are you not going to beg me for your life?' Bughuul asks, head tilting again. 'Mercy? The only mercy I want is for the pain to stop.' She says, feeling a pulsing pain start inside her. 'Pain?' Bughuul wonders, 'What pain is worth your death girl?' Anna moves aside and Bughuul finally takes in the sight of the room, a body laying still in a bed and a machine hooked to the girl who he is talking to. 'You are a spirit?' He asks, staring at the body in the bed then to the girl in front of him. 'Yes I am; I am the sister of the boys you are pinning against each other. I am already fading and the only thing I want is for my brothers to live after I fade.' Anna states, staring into the eyes of Bughuul, 'I am also the sister that can make it very difficult for you to get the souls of either of the brothers you want.' Bughuul chuckles, amused by the spirit of the girl in front of him, 'I am listening.' Anna nods, realizing that this will decide her brother's fates, 'I will convince Dylan to help Zach kill our parents and you will have two souls, instead of just one.' 'What makes you believe that you could convince him, when not even my children could?' Bughuul asks. 'I have always been able to convince my brothers of everything and even in my weakened state, I will still be able to convince them.' Anna says. 'Prove it, if they both should agree to the killing then they both will live. However, they must do it before the end of tonight and they must think of a different way then what was the original plan.' Bughuul states. 'I will!' Anna growls, turning to Zach and gesturing him over. He hurried over to her and they whispered between each other. Bughuul and his children watch in silence as they argue amongst themselves. Zach finally sags and nods in defeat, before being pulled over to Dylan, who no one realized was sitting in the chair by the bed until now. Dylan appeared to be unconscious, but Anna called his name and shook him awake. \"Anna? Wha…\" Dylan mumbles, before bolting up and looking around the room, \"Anna, what is going on?\" Anna strokes his head to calm him down, \"I've made a deal. He will allow you two to live…\" \"What?! Two! What about you Anna?!\" The twins cried out in union. \"Hush, you two!\" She snaps, making the twins jump at her tone and look at her in shock. Anna looks at them, then over to the staring group, before turning back to the twins and sighing, \"I am already fading from this world.\" Anna lifts her hand to show them her hand which is flicking, \"I only want you two to be taken care of and that 'man' has promised to do so.\" \"No, Anna!\" Dylan cries, lunging and hugging her to him, \"You can't leave me!\" Zach nods in agreement and hugs her tightly. Anna just strokes their heads and begins to humming to try to calm them. After a few minutes of humming, she stops and says, \"Now the deal is our 'father' and 'mother' must die for him to take you both in and a different plan must be made for their demise.\" Dylan gasps, \"But…their our…I can't kill our parents!\" He shakes his head in denile, but Anna grabs him and makes him look at her, \"They have not been our parents for many years.\" She says, \"That man stopped being our 'father' when he put his hands on us and that women stopped being our 'mother' when she stood there, watched him beat us, then tried to rationalize it to us like it was all okay that he beat us.\" Dylan's eyes widen and he flinches as he remembers all the times that his father beat him and then his mother tried to tell him that his father didn't mean it. He looks into his sister's eyes and nods, \"What is the plan?\" Zach looks at Dylan with wide eyes, which widen even further when Dylan grabs his hand and looks at him with wide eyes. Zach's eyes soften and he squeezes back, before looking at their sister who is smiling softly at both of them.[Chapter 5] Okay, so I never actually planned to leave you guys hanging this long. So without further adieu, here's another chapter of 'The Protector'. \" The Protector\" Anna had been plotting her parents' death for a long time, and she had had months to think up some gruesome ideas, but she had never included her brothers' in any of her scenarios. Now, she had to think up ideas that would include all of them, and she had the perfect one in her head. Smirking, Anna looks directly into the twins' eyes, \" How would you two like to play a game?\" Dylan and Zach look at each other warily, after all Anna's definition of 'games' were not what everyone would call them. Zach, being the braver one at the moment, looked at Anna and asks, \"What do you have in mind?\" Anna laughs, \"Don't worry little brother, the game won't be for you two, it'll be for our 'parents'. It'll be a game of hide and seek, but for each wrong seek there will be a penalty.\" Zach, starting to understand the plan, nods and looks at Dylan, who has been quiet. Dylan looked like he was fighting with himself, but looks at them and nods, \"What do we need to do, Anna?\" Anna reaches forward and rustles both their hair, \" Let's make this house like a scene out of 'The Collector'.\" Dylan shutters, remembering when they had watched that movie and the sequel, it had given them all nightmares for weeks. Zach also shuttered, but nodded in understanding, knowing that they would have to do something special for the Deity to accept them now. Anna started listing off things that needed to be gathered;like lightbulbs, nails and kitchen knives. Dylan and Zach noted them down on a piece of paper, along with the rooms in the house. They decided that each hiding place would have a trap in each room; for the kitchen- the cabinets would be lined with broken glass from the lightbulbs and the cubby space in the cupboard lined with knives, for the bathrooms- underneath the sink lined with broken light bulbs and the tub curtain with tacks, for the bedrooms- underneath the bed broken glass and the closet with needles in the clothes/shoes. Plus each trap would have another to make sure that damage was done, like if they climbed underneath the bed, not only would the glass be on the ground but pierced through the bottom of the mattress. By the time their parents found them, they would have lost enough blood that it wouldn't be that hard to bring them down. To keep them on track, clues would be left in each hiding spot and egging them on, to their demise. Anna watched as her two brothers' set off to set up the rooms, and turned to face Buughul, \" Your word that you will take care of them afterwards?\" Buughul chuckled, 'You would trust the word of a demon?' \"Better demon than humans at this point.\" Anna states, looking at her body. Buughul nods, 'My word that I will take care of them.' Anna smiles at the deity and nods, thinking about how to lure their parents through the house and to their demise, before realizing the perfect way and grinning vindictively at the thought. *With the 'parents'* Courtney and Clint sit up and rub their heads, trying to shake the confusion from their minds. Clint looks up and sees that its growing dark and that they were still outside, with neither of the boys in sight. Turning to Courtney, he could tell that she hadn't been in on the obvious drugging and that left only two people as the possible criminals behind this. \"ZACH, DYLAN, YOUR ASSES BETTER GET OUT HERE AND TAKE YOUR BEATINGS LIKE MEN!\" Clint waited to see if that would send them cowering to him, like it usually would, but he heard not a peep from around them. ' So that's how it's going to be, fine lets see how strong you both will be once I get to you.' He thought getting up and pulling Courtney with him. Courtney just watched the anger flash across Clint's face and wondered if she should try to calm him, but decided to let it play out, as they had drugged her as well and she was tired of defending them and getting beat for their mistakes. 'It would serve them right for making him angry and drugging us both.' She thought, letting Clint drag her up and towards the house. Once they reached the door, the two saw a note and read it, 'Let's play a game, Hide and Seek! But be warned that each wrong guess comes with a punishment!' Clint growled and grabbed the note, crumbling it and throwing it to the ground. \"So they want to play do they, well let's play and once I get my hands on them...I do worse then I did to Anna!\" Clint growled, pushing open the door and heading inside. ","Summary":" Hey Luna loves u here! I am going to try my hand at the new Sinister 2 movie. So here it is. The Pr"},{"Movie":"Sinister","Title":"Sharaku","Author":"bbst","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12185303","Passage":"[Chapter 1] Bughuul was not sure why he brought the meddling human into his realm. He had gone to that cheap motel he knew the man was staying at with every intention to kill him. This human had been a thorn in his side for some time now. With every home this worm destroyed, that was one less meal for Bughuul. (And he was always so very hungry.) Bughuul hoped to scare the man off. Humans always ran when they laid eyes upon him, and Bughuul loved the delicious taste of their fear. The deputy had many pictures of Bughuul. It was easy to find him and show him what he was dealing with. The man was thinking off breaking Bughuul's many chains. It would have been funny if it wasn't so irritating. The deputy was not a child, nor had he watched Bughuul's marvelous film collection. He was not under his power as much as the children were. However, the fool was aware, and he provided Bughuul with many portals. He unknowingly gave Bughuul strength, and he was going to use it. The human was running with what should have been the latest sacrifice to him. Bughuul raged at the thought. He did so love the trouble his children went through to create art for him, and this man ruined what could have been a fabulous show. Not only that, but he broke that wonderful camera that had captured so much art. Bughuul had no qualms about taking his rage out on that boy. He was given plenty of time to complete his task. His soul was not as satisfying as it could have been, but it would keep Bughuul sated for some time. The man was surprised to see the ham radio Bughuul placed in his room. (That prying professor had already been dispatched by his daughter. Her soul tasted so sweet). It distracted him long enough for Bughuul to catch him by surprise. Humans always felt so fragile under his cold hands. The feeling always made his mouth water. What a shame he could no longer bite. Of course, the deputy screamed and kicked and tried to get away. Bughuul savored the sound. What a fitting end for this pest. He was reaching for the man's neck when he suddenly went limp. Bughuul paused. The human had actually fainted. Bughuul felt the sides of is face twitch in an attempt to smile. Where was this man's bravado now? He could overcome a group of his ghostly minions but he was nothing when faced with the god himself. It would be so easy to end the man now. One quick movemnt could lead to a broken neck. Afterwards, Bughuul could use his innards to decorate the room. His escaped prey would have to come in after the man if he took too long. Bughuul could record their reactions and then give them the same treatment. As he took another look at the man's face, Bughuul found himself hesitating. He was strangely content to stand there and hold the man up and simply...look at him. He often held his children to feed or keep them some escaping. Sometimes he would even offer a soft touch to offer them a false comfort. It was something that had to be done. Bughuul usually only enjoyed contact with a human if it was to cause harm, but having the deputy in his grasp was – was – he wasn't sure he had a word for it. Satisfying , was the best he could come up with. The urge to maim was gone. Bughuul wasn't sure what to do now. What he did know was that he couldn't just leave the man here to run away again. He still had to be punished somehow. Bughuul laughed quietly to himself as he looked around the room. There were a few pictures of him alongside well-worn maps. The deputy put his hard-learned skills into finding Bughuul. He was almost flattered. It was easier than Bughuul anticipated to pull the man into his realm. Bughuul didn't hold him elegantly. He clutched the limp man to his chest like his girl children had done in the past with their rag dolls. A few small, decaying faces poked around the corner. Bughuul knew they were all frightened of him, rightfully so, but they had never seen him bring an adult here before. He dismissed them with a wave of his hand. They scattered like roaches. The group that was with him at the farmhouse were staying out of his sight for the time being, lest they face his wrath like their would-be brother. Bughuul carried the man off to his preferred room. It was decorated to his tastes: large, dark and the walls were covered with his children's art. There were old paintings from Babylon, crude drawings from the Middle Ages, gramophone records from a few centuries ago, and gritty film constantly playing. All forever new and fresh here. Bughuul thought about dropping the man to the hard marble floor and watching him from a nearby high-back chair. Wouldn't that make a sight? The human waking in an unfamiliar place only to see a dark and capacious god watching him from what could be a throne? Instead, Bughuul walked over to a long couch and laid down on his side. The human was clutched to his chest tightly. The human squirmed, uncomfortable in his sleep. Bughuul's arm would leave a bruise. His face twitched at the thought. There was a mirror across from them. Bughuul had no desire to see his own reflection. He had looked the same for thousands of years. He now studied the image of the pair of them in the polished glass. The contrast between them was ridiculous. The human's skin was peachy and flush with red blood. His dark hair was nothing extraordinary. His mouth hung slightly open in a comical way. Bughuul's gray pallor and dark hair stood out against the man. Bughuul's human-like shape helped him catch his prey, but he was really nothing like them. The sight of the man's open mouth brought Bughuul's attention to his own sealed one. It was something he had gotten used to long ago, though the memory and the indignity still stung. Oh the things he could do with his mouth… He still didn't know what to do with the human. As long as he was in this realm, Bughuul could do whatever he wanted to him. He could drain him slowly like he did his children, or he could keep him in his current state forever. Perhaps Bughuul would keep him trapped here for a number of years. He could keep the man strapped to this very couch, watching every film he had in his collection over and over and over again. He could pull out every child drawing he had and explain the story behind it. The man would squirm, he would cry and complain, he would insult and spit. But he would remain here. He would be Bughuul's. Yes, the deputy could make a fun plaything. He would be out of Bughuul's way and he would make many more chains to replenish the one this man destroyed. Maybe he would make the man help. Maybe Bughuul would get bored and dispose of the human before then. Either way, Bughuul had much fun ahead of him. The deputy began to stir in his arms. Show time.[Chapter 2] It was easy to lose track of time in this dark world of Bughuul's. The ex-deputy could have been here hours, weeks, or months. He had never been an overly religious man, despite how often the search for Bughuul had driven him to seek spiritual counsel. However, he imagined being trapped here was akin to being in Hell. Sure, there was no fire or brimstone and all that jazz, but he did have his own personal demon to torment him all hours of the day. He could only suppose that this was Bughuul's idea of revenge. The man often wished he had just been killed in that seedy motel room. He would reprimand himself for that thought. He had to stay strong. He had to get through this and get back to Courtney and Dylan. True, he hadn't known them long, but he could see a future with them. They needed someone who would understand what they've been through. Maybe he shouldn't think so much of himself, but he was afraid his disappearance was taking a huge toll on them. They had just lost their son and brother. How was losing someone else right after that effecting them? He could only hope they were doing okay. The thing was, Bughuul didn't make it easy to stay strong. The former deputy had learned enough about the supposed deity to know he was evil. He killed families and ate kids. What else did the man need to know? This thing needed to be stopped and he was the one to do it. As it turned out, Bughuul was far worse than he could have ever imagined. He thought psychological torture was the thing's game, but Bughuul was proving perfectly able to get up close and personal. Bughuul had some terrible power to dig into his head. The former deputy recalled the first moment he woke up in this room. He knew at once that something wasn't right. At that moment he should have been with what was left of the Collins family, and instead he was in the grip of a monster. Bughuul didn't waste any time in making his captive's life miserable. While on the force, the man had encountered and dealt with all kinds of threats, but those could be dealt with. He didn't know how to cope with some unnameable force invading his mind, carelessly looking through his thoughts, his memories, his hopes and dreams. Bughuul learned everything about the deputy in those awful moments. The man could see his entire life swirling around in his mind. Bits and pieces would stand out: a puppy when he was small, an angry male voice yelling his name before a fist came swinging down, pretty girls and boys who caught his eye, drunken nights in college, his diploma and then joining the force. It slowed as it came to the point where he met Ellison Oswalt and learned about Bughuul. The demon wanted to comb through those carefully. Damn narcissist. When it was finally over, he felt so exposed. Every secret or ace he could ever want to hide from Bughuul was now revealed to him. What the hell was he going to do now? There's nothing you can do. The man jumped in surprise at the voice intruding in his head. (Well, as best he could with the restrictive arms still around him.) It wasn't what he expected Bughuul to sound like. The voice was an average, smooth tenor that came in a whisper. Perfect for soothing a frightened child or scaring them into submission. You have had an average life, Deputy. Greater men than you have tried and failed to find me. Although it is a shame that we could not meet during your childhood. I'm sure that you could have made me a beautiful sacrifice out of that father of yours. A spark of anger ran through him. \"Shut up, asshole!\" he barked. The arms around him constricted painfully, as if he were being crushed by a large snake. Oh great, now the thing was pissed. You will be more careful with your words, mortal. I do not tolerate such disrespect. \"You're one to talk. You won't even call me by my name!\" Low laughter echoed through his head. It was unsettling. I was under the impression your name was \"Deputy So and So\" from watching Ellison Oswalt. I do not see why you were so f o nd of the man. His personality was almost as weak as his writing ! The only real art he has ever been apart of is when his daughter made her film for me. The man struggled with renewed vigor. The Oswalt case had been a sore spot for him ever since the murders happened. Bughuul knew this and was trying to provoke him. He should do his best to stay cool, but the former deputy wasn't about to let this thing bully him. More creepy laughter. You think you can escape the grasp of a god? \"Yeah, some god you are!\" he snapped. \"You're just another leech that's been forgotten with time! You're an ugly freak- Ah!\" There was pain everywhere. His head felt like it was about to explode. He desperately rubbed it against the couch cushion in an attempt to relieve the pressure. You are either very brave or very foolish to test me like this, Deputy. I will not warn you again. He cried out again as he was flipped onto his back. His eyes were shut as a faux shield from the pain, and some force compelled him to open them and see Bughuul looming over him. Something like a demented grin was stretched across the demon's not-mouth. I wonder how long this spirit of yours will last. He couldn't hold back a frightened cry as a smooth, but clammy hand stroked his cheek. Let's have some fun, Deputy. X He used to wonder what it was that caused these children to kill their families. What could they have seen or heard to make them do such horrible things? He knew from professor Stomberg that Bughuul liked artistic sacrifices, and that recording of the little Norwegian girl playing her piano whilst slaughtering her family gave him an inclination. Having Zach Collins chase his family down with a camera helped him learn, too. But even with all that, the former deputy could not have predicted the horrors that Bughuul showed him on film. Now that the deity could really touch him, the man discovered that Bughuul was very strong. It was ridiculously easy to drag the human from the couch to a chair that looked fit for torture across the room. As soon as he was pushed to sit in it, straps came around his ankles and wrists, keeping him from getting up. Bughuul pushed his head against the back of the chair and strapped his head down. He pried the man's eye open and placed something sticky on the lid, preventing it from being closed. He repeated the action with the other eye. If he wasn't scared before, the man definitely was now. He was completely immobilized and had nowhere to look but forward. What did Bughuul have in mind for him now? Bughuul stood in front of him and held up an old film canister. Pool Party '66 was written across it. His feeling of dread grew. I want to show you the art my children make for me, Deputy. My hope is that you will learn an appreciation for it. The former deputy heard him put the film reel into a camera that must have been to the side. The projector came to life and showed the deputy its horrible contents. That poor family, drugged and drowned by their own child while a monster watched… Despite his bindings, he still tried to turn away and shut his eyes. Anything to block out this evil. He could feel Bughuul's gaze on him. The bastard was enjoying seeing him squirm. Thankfully, the film ended quickly. His relief was short lived. You did not seem to enjoy that one. Why don't we watch another? X His life became reduced to a never ending parade of macabre \"art\". Like a proud father, Bughuul had kept every depiction of every sacrifice made to him over the years. It was like a museum collection of murder. Now, the former deputy had done his fare share of case studies and crime research and what-if-scenarios. It was easy to view grisly photos and hear gruesome details with a cool detachment. He pitied the victims, but he wasn't losing any sleep over their misfortune. This was different. The videos alone were bad because he was forced to see the act happen, when he was used to dealing with the aftermath. It was so much more real . When he was still on the force, he hoped that he could prevent crimes before they happened, so that innocent people wouldn't have to suffer. He wished that he could jump into these films and save these unfortunate families form their poisoned offspring. Bughuul enjoyed his suffering. With every film or record or painting, Bughuul would say something about the child who made it. Before he knew it, the man had a long list of names to go with a brief description of looks and mannerisms. Bughuul threatened to introduce him to some of the children in the future. (Okay, it hadn't been a threat per se , but the man in no way wanted these murderous brats near him.) He thought he was safe from the Snuff-O-Rama when Bughuul pulled out the stuff predating modern technology. He was wrong. There was a library's worth of sculptures and papyrus and paintings and drawings. So much pain and suffering depicted in charcoal, paint, pen, and clay. They all looked fresh and new. It would have been neat to see if the older stuff if it wasn't for the circumstances. Bughuul started with stone slabs with a paint style that even the human could tell was ancient Babylonian. Okay, he could deal with that. He's spent his career looking at pictures. Of course, Bughuul had to ruin that. While one hand held the slab in front of the man's face, the other was placed on his head. As if another movie started to play in his head, he could see the events depicted on the slab as Bughuul had seen them. He was momentarily amazed to see an ancient culture like this. He took a moment to observe the ancient temples, the clothing, the people. Somehow it wasn't as bad as seeing the recent films. He could almost pretend he was watching a very graphic documentary. You do not seem as distraught now. Are you finally seeing the beauty in what me and my children accomplish? Did Bughuul honestly think he was giving in now? \"No, damnit,\" he bit out. He could sense the demon's displeasure. Was he actually offended by that? This has been one of my favorites for a very long time. How about another like it? Of course they were the thing's favorites. They were from the time when he was actually important. He winced as pain flooded his skull. Bughuul apparently didn't care for his opinion. Whatever. As Bughuul showed him more, he couldn't help but wonder how Bughuul managed to fall into obscurity. It seemed like he relieved plenty of sacrifices and worship and all that. Even if the old pagan gods faded out with Abrahamic religions, they were still well known from the many statues and stories about them. Bughuul managed to be erased by only some medieval Christians. Why was this demon lesser known when the others thrived? He tensed as a cool hand ran through his sweaty hair. There was annoyance coming from Bughuul, but it wasn't aimed towards him. In fact, the monster seemed almost...pleased? That is story for another day, Deputy. Perhaps I will tell it to you...if you behave. The hell was that supposed to mean? Bughuul didn't give him much time to think about it. He presented the human with a canvas filled with childish drawings in oil paint. Maybe this will excite you more. You humans came up with more creative killing methods during this time. X At some point, he began to feel tired. He wasn't sure if that was even possible in Bughuul's realm. It must have taken a lot of time to see as much of Bughuul's \"art\" as he did. He hadn't felt hungry or had to use the bathroom or anything. Which was good, because he wouldn't trust any food Bughuul brought him. He realized that he became completely relaxed in his chair, as if he were trying to unwind after work in his comfy armchair with a beer. It wasn't as though he didn't register the horror of what this demon showed him anymore, it was more like...he was becoming indifferent. There was only so much a person could see of anything before they stopped caring. No matter what age or media the sacrifice was depicted on, the man knew people were going to die. No point in being surprised about it. It if wasn't for whatever kept his eyes open, he would have nodded off some time ago. He barely registered his bonds being undone. The stuff on his eyelids was removed and they immediately shut with no intention on opening for some time. He only had the strength to make a small noise in protest as cold, strong arms lifted him up. It was like being carried by a statue. You are a surprisingly wonderful audience, Deputy. Although I do wish you were as enthusiastic as you were attentive. Yeah, because he totally volunteered to watch all of that. Bughuul was showing him what was going on through the deity's own eyes. The man saw his almost-sleeping form being practically cradled in this thing's arms. An eye twitched on his otherwise peaceful face. He felt the couch cushions as Bughuul placed him down on it. He was surprised when Bughuul placed a soft blanket over him. You must rest now. You will need your strength for later on. I have much more in mind for us. Everything went dark as he fell asleep in the first time in what felt like a long time. For now, he was free of Bughuul and his mind games. X When he woke, Ashley Oswalt was standing inches from the couch. The former deputy sat up quickly. The blanket pooled in his lap. Logically, he knew she had to be somewhere in this realm, but he never expected to see her again. He had not seen the red haired girl since the day her father called about a disturbance in their attic. Even then, it was a passing glance. He memorized her face not from then, but from the newspapers that detailed the murders of her family. He lost count of how many times he stared at that family photo, wondering how such a sweet looking girl could do such horrible things. Then again, that's what Bughuul's terrible, suffocating influence could do to people. He shuddered as he took in her appearance. Pajamas covered by a blood covered painting smock. This must be what she hacked her family to death in. What a get-up to be stuck in forever. Or...however long she lasted. He felt a small bit of pity. No matter what that monster convinced these children to do, they didn't deserve this fate. \"Deputy,\" she greeted in a small voice. Her expression was eerily blank, but her eyes held a child-like softness. \"Ashley,\" he choked out. It seemed like forever since he had used his voice. \"What are you doing here? Did...did he send you?\" The girl shook her her head. \"No, I don't think I'm supposed to be here. He never lets any of us in this room.\" \"Then why-?\" \"I just wanted to see you,\" Ashley explained. \"We never see grown-ups here. He can't eat them.\" The man nodded. Honestly, he was glad to have some company other than Bughuul. \"Does he talk to you about me? Does he say what he plans on doing with me?\" She fiddled with her smock. \"We asked after he brought you here. He said that you were his now, and we weren't to disturb him when he was with you.\" What did that mean? Did Bughuul regard him as property? As some little play toy to psychologically torture for eternity? He wouldn't doubt that for a minute. \"How long has it been since I came here?\" He winced at how desperate he sounded, but he needed answers so badly. The girl shrugged. \"I'm not sure exactly. Time passes kinda funny here. But...in the last house, it was snowing outside, if that helps.\" Snow? It had been late summer when he was last back in his own damn dimension. So it had at least been five months. It simultaneously felt like so much more time had passed, and yet not enough for that to be right. \"Did you like my film?\" she asked eagerly, catching him off guard. \"I know he's been showing them to you. I worked really hard on it!\" He felt bile rise. \"How could you do that?\" he demanded quietly. He didn't have the strength to shout. \"That was your family . Your own mom and dad and brother! How could you kill them like that? Because he told you to?\" Ashley frowned. \"I hated them. Dad was so mean to me! He kept moving us around. All the kids at school didn't like me. He was always either yelling at me or ignoring me. Mom wouldn't do anything about it. She let him hole himself up in his office. Trevor was so annoying. He would hide my paint and call me names. None of them even noticed what was going on until...\" \"Your father would have crawled through glass for you.\" The former deputy knew from his brief talks with Ellison Oswlat that the man could be difficult, but he also knew what it was like to try and figure out Bughuul. Despite his dickish tendencies, the man knew without a doubt that Ellison loved his family dearly. Ashley didn't look impressed. \"There's no point in that now.\" They both shuddered as the air grew even colder. He didn't have to look to know Bughuul was standing close by. He turned his head anyway. He could see the annoyance on the demonic face. Ashley looked appropriately frightened. He didn't know if Bughuul said anything to her, but when the monster raised his arm and pointed toward the door, Ashley sprinted toward it and let herself out. A chill ran up his spine when Bughuul turned towards him. Was he going to be punished for talking to the girl without permission? Bughhul silently walked closer and sat down on the end of the couch. He gripped the man's shoulder and pulled him down so he was laying with his head in Bughuul's lap. The blanket was pulled over him again. Go back to sleep. You need more rest. He instantly obeyed the command and drifted back into unconsciousness. X He wasn't sure when Bughuul started to be more casually physical with him. It must have been a gradual process. Small touches here and there so he wouldn't care when it evolved to more. Bughuul had years upon years worth of art in his collection. He would let the former deputy nap in between their viewing sessions. He think it began with him waking up to the feeling of Bughuul stroking his hair. He would stay still and enjoy the calming touch for a few moments before he fully registered what was going on and pulled away. Where did Bughuul get off stroking him like a house cat? He wasn't a goddamn pet. ( I disagree, Deputy. ) A cold hand would slip into his, or it would caress and cheek and hair while Bughuul continued to act like the art teacher from hell. It's not that the former deputy welcomed the contact, but he got used to it the same way he got used to the cold and the lack of human contact. ( Why do you need that when you have me? ) After some time, Bughuul began to give him breaks from the Murder Marathon. He brought books for the man to read and would leave him alone for some time to enjoy them in peace. ( I'm afraid my selection in English is limited. I know that you do not speak any other tongues, nor do you play any instruments, so I did not bother to bring those. Perhaps you should use your time here to develop some artistic talent. ) ...Dick...Ow! ( I do keep warning you, Deputy .) The man enjoyed all the privacy he could get. He could never completely relax. He was still in Bughuul's world and the deity could return to his side at any moment he chose. But the thing was usually gone long enough for him to get comfortable. He spent what had to be hours reclining on the couch and reading whole novels. Any sort of entertainment that wasn't produced by Bughuul's \"children\" would do for him. It was finally a distraction form his situation. He was surprised when he found a few of his favorite crime novels in the book stack. Did Bughuul already have those, or did he get them just for the deputy. His mood was tainted when he discovered a copy of Kentucky Blood . This was another way for Bughuul to taunt him. He placed the book out of sight and tried to quickly forget he saw it. When Bughuul did rejoin him, it always came as a shock. The man had no way of sensing his captor's presence. Bughuul didn't even greet him properly. He would instead run a cold hand over the back of his neck or cover his eyes, just to see the man's reaction. \"You're spending too much time with those kids,\" he complained once. He was trying to calm himself after almost jumping out of his skin. \"You're picking up their habits.\" This amused Bughuul. The human let out an embarrassing scream when Bughuul suddenly sat beside him and pulled him so he was laying against the thing's chest. Strong arms kept him from getting up. It was like a reenactment of when he first woke up here. Bughuul's touch felt more repulsive than ever. He squirmed as best he could. Why are you so eager to be away from me? I was beginning to think that you missed my presence. \"I was not ,\" he insisted. He hated how petulant he sounded. Bughuul chuckled. I am sorry I had to be away. I did have to feed, and the children were becoming restless with my long absences. \"Are you saying they actually miss you when you're gone? After all you've done to them?\" But of course! I am their god. They worship me, idolize me. Even with all he had seen, the man had a hard time believing that. Did the children not realize Bughuul was eating them alive? Did they not care? Just how much power did this demon have over them? The children are glad that their life force is being given to such a higher being. They were all unhappy in their mortal lives. I offered them a way out, as well as a greater purpose in their existence. They are better off as my servants than an average child with a mundane future ahead of them. \"You're a trickster,\" he protested. \"You lie and manipulate and make them think they're getting a prize when all you're really offering is death.\" Mmm. Perhaps. But it has worked for so long. I have thrived even when others sought to erase me. I have grown strong while others have weakened. He could sense hidden meaning behind that last part. He wasn't sure he wanted to know what it was about. He cried out as Bughuul's head settled in the crook of his neck and he was held even tighter. Was...was this thing actually cuddling with him? Is this not what human adults like to do? I have been watching your kind for millenia and some things always stay the same with you. Bughuul was only doing this to piss him off. He had to be. \"Yeah, but with people we actually enjoy being with!\" Oh? You do not enjoy being with me? The voice was teasing. I thought we were building a strong companionship! \"...I hate you so much.\" Why don't we change that attitude, hmm? X Bughuul was enjoying his human pet more than he could have imagined. The man's spirit did not break like a twig, as most humans did. Instead, it became malleable. It stayed strong, but Bughuul could twist and shape and rebuild the man as he saw fit. He was a solitary creature. His nature was to feed and seek out entertainment. He never understood the love or friendship or loyalty that humans always prattled on about. But he did know when he liked something, he had to have it. The deputy had become one of his prized possessions in the short time they had been together. Bughuul didn't forsee getting rid of the man in the near future. He was not yet bored, so that was a promising sign. His human was dozing soundly in his grip. Bughuul knew humans did this for comfort, but such an act was a demonstration of control and ownership for him. The deputy was slowly but surely learning who he belonged to. While he often did not think beyond where his next meal would come from, Bughuul found himself wondering what the future might hold for him and his pet. In was only a matter of time befor ethe man was completely his. It had been so long since a fully grown human ha dpaid tribute to him. The man could be his new priest, his advocate to spread Bughuul's image around the world and bring him the worship he deserved. Yes, a new golden age for him could be achieved through this man. He couldn't wait.[Chapter 3] Bughuul's realm extended beyond just the few rooms the former deputy had been allowed to see. It was a strange place. Not completely nightmarish, but not pleasant enough for the man to be comfortable. He likened it to a more fucked up version of Wonderland. He was a thirty-six year old heavily traumatized Alice and Bughuul was a frightening White Rabbit. God, he wished that he'd never gone down this rabbit hole. There was no source of light, and yet their surroundings looked as if they were illuminated by moonlight. They were walking on a stone bridge that was riddled with cracks and small holes, but the man somehow knew it wouldn't collapse. There was a cavern underneath the bridge. He didn't even want to know how deep it was. (Oh God, what if something was down there?) Across from them was a pale gray mountain, and in its center was a waterfall. It had no source that the man could see. The frothing water seemed to appear out of thin air before it cascaded down into a pool at the bottom. It was a beautiful sight, he had to admit. Hopefully it wouldn't suddenly turn into blood or whatever. Bughuul held his left hand tightly. The contact could be mistaken as romantic by an onlooker, but the man knew the grip was more of a leash than a comfort. Not that he had any intentions of running. Who knew what weird, omnivorous shit resided here? Besides, Bughuul could easily catch him. The demon's strong thumb pressed painfully against the empty space where his fingers should have been. He hadn't had much time to focus on his injury. After that homicidal kid Zach chopped them off, he and the rest of the Collins' had to hide from him, then flee their burning home, and then Bughuul snatched him up. He realized after some time that there wasn't much feeling in Bughuul's realm, unless the demon willed it. He often forgot about about his still unhealed wound unless Bughuul payed attention to it. I could fix it if you so desired. His head snapped back over to his captor. Bughuul's gaze was directed toward the waterfall, as if the suggestion was nothing to him. \"You can do that?\" he asked, incredulous. Bughuul having the power to heal seemed impossible. The deity could only destroy as far as the human was concerned. Bughuul turned to look at him. The inhuman face still unsettled him, but it had become familiar. Yes, I could do so easily. However… Of course there was a catch. \"What do you want?\" Hmm...not much, I believe. I do wish, though, that you would be more… Damn it, the creature was teasing him. He tried in vain to pull his hand free. It was only a half-hearted attempt. \"What is it?\" he demanded impatiently. He could tell Bughuul was amused by all this. We've been together for some time now. Would it be too much to ask that you stop being so resistant toward me and all I can show you? Give you? You should know by now that you are not going anywhere. Why are you still dreaming of the day you can return to your lonely, mundane life in the mortal realm? Your place is here, by my side. \"Y-You've gotta be kidding me,\" he stammered. He felt a mix of outrage and disbelief. Bughuul knew damn well that he wanted nothing the demon had to offer, and he never would. I assure you that I do not jest. Just give in to me, do as I say, and I could give you more than you have ever dreamed of! \"I'm not one of those little kids you can trick!\" he snapped. \"I'm not going to fall for your promises of candy and puppies! Anything that comes from you can't be any good.\" If Bughuul had normal eyes, he would probably be rolling them. He pulled on his pet's hand and they started to walk again. You will think on it. An order, not a request. \"Yeah, right,\" he muttered. It would be a dark day if he ever even considered giving in completely to this demon. The bridge lead to a meadow that was filled with frosty grass and small, pale flowers. They made no noise as they crunched under the pair's feet. Like the waterfall, it was a peaceful area. I let the children come here to play sometimes. Their games often include reenacting their sacrifice to me. Okay, that peace was now gone. It would do you good to spend time with them. You must overcome this aversion you have to them. They will not hurt you unless I order it. Furthermore, they are very curious about you. Oh, goody, the murder kids wanted to see him. And what the hell did Bughuul mean they wouldn't hurt him unless ordered? Was Bughuul planning on having them come after his already traumatized ass? \"Let's just keep walking,\" he grumbled. He didn't want to think about any of this right now. Or ever. Thankfully, Bughuul obliged. X \"What did you do to Zach Collins?\" He wasn't sure why he asked it. They were seated on the couch, with Bughuul's arm around the former deputy's shoulders. The contact wasn't welcomed, but it was tolerated. He had taken a few semesters of French in college, and he was flipping through an English to French dictionary in hopes of remembering some of it. Doing anything \"artsy\" seemed to please Bughuul, and the man was happy for any distraction. He had no idea why Courtney's dead son popped into his head within a sea of French verbs. Did you not see for yourself? The demon sounded annoyed, obviously still bitter at the memory of his lost meal. Indeed he did. He flinched at the memory of the poor kid disintegrating before the man's and his family's eyes. I like to devour souls slowly. They last longer and I stay fuller. But that boy was little more than a snack. He was not fit to keep around. He couldn't help but be angry at that. He knew Zach before Bughuul's influence overcame him. He was a typical, rascal of a little boy. He didn't deserve what happened to him. Why do you ask? There was something dangerous in Bughuul's tone. He fidgeted nervously, causing the deity's grip on him to tighten. \"I don't know, really, I just -\" I think you do know. Bughuul roughly grabbed his chin and turned the man's head toward the creature. Tell me. Now. He realized that he did know why he was thinking about Zach. It was not knowledge he wanted to share with Bughuul, but he knew from experience that the demon had many, often painful, ways of getting what he wanted. \"I...I was thinking about his mother,\" he confessed. \"And Dylan. I thought they would want to know what happened to him.\" I see. And perhaps they do wonder about that boy's fate. But tell me, why is it any of your concern? You are never going to be around to tell them. The man could tell that he'd crossed some sort of line. He wasn't completely sure why, but Bughuul was angry at him. You were close to that woman, yes? And the other boy? \"Well, yeah, I was helping them-\" We both know it was more than that. I watched you while you were with them - \"Wait, what? I figured you were around somewhere, but don't tell me it was constant surveillance from you.\" Human, you do recall that I see and move in images of myself, yes? I have been watching you for years . \"All that time? Like, as long as I've been investigating you?\" A heavy sigh. Yes. Now - \"Hold on. Did-did you see anything...weird? I mean I'm no different than any other guy-\" I saw nothing different than what I have seen your kind do for millenia. Even so, I only watched to see what your next move would be concerning my territory. \"Oh...alright then.\" It was silent for a few moments. The issue, my pet, is that you are still fantasizing about leaving me. Did we not discuss this mere days ago? Bughuul knew that he had no way of keeping track of time here, but that was beside the point. \"I didn't spend much time with them, but I love Dylan and Courtney like my own family. I'll never stop wanting to go back to them.\" He anticipated the onslaught of pain in his skull. He knew going against Bughuul's will would bring this on, but he didn't care. Holding onto hope was going to get him through this. He wanted to see Courtney's beautiful face and kiss her soft lips again. He wanted to make sure Dylan was safe and happy. He would, he had too, one day. It took a moment to notice that his head was resting against Bughuul's chest. The demon was trying to \"comfort\" him after giving him a killer migraine. The man had studied plenty of manipulation tactics while on the force. He wasn't going to fall for this false care, ever. Give it time. I'll win your devotion, yet. You will see that the attention of a god is better than what any woman can offer you. X He gulped nervously as he surveyed the children in front of him. Bughuul was making good on his promise of forcing the man spend time with these little ghouls. The demon's hand was a firm pressure on his back. He was oddly reminded of that time a blind date showed him pictures of her five kids. Was Bughuul going to pressure him into being their new step-daddy? You are ridiculous. He knew two of them already: Ashley Oswalt and Stephanie Stevenson. Ashley smiled shyly at him while Stephanie looked bored to tears. How strange to see the little girl here, after thinking she was dead and gone for so long, after seeing what became of her family. Did Bughuul select them to taunt him, or because he was familiar with the girls? He recognized the boy from the Pool Party video, and there was another small blond who he couldn't place. They looked at him curiously. How long had it been since they were able to interact with an adult human? Bughuul inclined his head toward the small group, having a silent conversation. The man wondered if they felt just as awkward as he did. \"Hello, Deputy,\" Ashley said after a moment. \"Ashley,\" he greeted. Okay, that was plenty of quality time, right? He could practically feel Bughuul's exasperation. Come now. You are not the type to cower before mere children, are you? Normal children, no. Creepy ghost kids who killed their families for the sake of a supposed deity that no one had ever heard of? That was pushing it. The children are not as they once were, as you might imagine. They are utterly devoted to me, and my feedings have drained them of energy and spirit. But they are not completely gone. You should be kind to them while they still last. ...Was Bughuul trying to guilt-trip him now? No. I am merely letting you know what to expect. Now enough of this stalling. He cried out when Bughuul suddenly disappeared. Was that asshole honestly heaving him alone here? Behave. He felt Bughuul's presence fade. Yup, he was all by himself with the murder kids. What was he supposed to do here? Give them advice on dating and how to get into college? He cried out when Stephanie reached out and grasped his sleeve. Her companions laughed. Sadistic little- \"I saw you at my house,\" she said, \"after I made my movie.\" \"Oh really?\" His voice came out a bit strangled. She finally grinned. \"Yeah, me and Mr. Boogie watched while you cut my family down and took pictures and all that. He said he was really proud of me.\" \"Yeah, I'll bet...\" His stomach churned as he recalled that day. The flurry of excitement at the station, driving up to the horrifying scene, clearing the area, the mad search for the lost little girl, the investigation that went nowhere. Life was so much simpler then. \"I wish that you had left them up longer. Mr. Boogie thought they made great decorations.\" Yup, time for a change of subject. He turned to the blond boy. \"So...what's your name?\" \"Stephan,\" he replied. Judging by his accent, he was from Eastern Europe. \"Mr. Boogie said that he showed you my film.\" The former deputy recognized the kid then. The images of a mother, father, and their two sons having a picnic in the woods played in his head. Everything was normal until the scene changed and the family, sans one son, were tied together on the ground. They screamed as a pack of thin wolves closed in on them. The man desperately wished he had been able to look away from what followed. \"Yeah, I-I've seen all your films,\" he admitted. \"What was your favorite part of mine?\" Ashley demanded, excited. He thought he had made his stance on how seeing Ellison Oswlat and his family being slaughtered made him feel the last time they met, but Ashley was conveniently forgetting that. \"Uh -\" Before he knew it, he had four dead children grasping onto his arms and demanding to know the man's thought on their familial sacrifice. And \"It was all good\" was evidently not a good answer. Somehow, he was going to get Bughuul for this. X Later, when Bughuul finally returned and shooed the kids away, the deputy was so relieved. \"What took you so long?\" he groaned. \"This may be the first time I'm actually happy to see you.\" That earned him a hard pinch on the cheek. I was preoccupied. New prey moved into one of the many homes that escaped your fire. I was planting the seeds for my next offering. He gritted his jaw. He should have gotten to whichever house that was sooner. He should be out there helping people instead of being stuck with this demon. Oh, calm yourself. I think you will like this girl. She is quite skilled with a bow and arrow and keeps prattling on about those Sherlock Holmes stories. \"Sounds like a great kid,\" he said. \"Too bad you're going to ruin that. How big is the family?\" Including her parents, an older and younger brother. The mother enjoys alcohol frequently and neglects her bickering children. This should not take very long. He nodded. He wished that he could warn the family somehow, but he couldn't. It killed him to admit it, but he knew he was powerless as long as he was trapped here. Those people were doomed. I am glad you are finally seeing it my way. Tell me, how was your time with the children? \"They're trying to turn me into a film critic,\" he sighed. \"They all wanted to hear me praise every minute of their films. They're taking too much after you.\" And did you? \"Oh yeah, it was all 'Nice work with the blood splatter' and 'Your sister looked like she pissed herself'!\" You will learn to appreciate it more with time. I think this was a good start. He frowned. \"I could never -\" I think you will. In fact, I know a perfect way to change your mind. \"What are you talking about?\" What did the demon have in mind now? You will see. For now, why don't we go for another walk outside, hmm? X \"Why did you bring me here?\" he asked nervously. Dread was filling every inch of him. Bughuul held his wrist tightly as they stood in the threshold of the mortal realm. Just behind them was Bughuul's strange abode, and no more than an inch in front of them was a little girl's bedroom. There was typical stuff: a color scheme of light blue, clothes and textbooks and games scattered everywhere, a few boy band posters. In one corner there was a large bookshelf packed full of novels and comics. A bow and arrow set hung proudly on the opposite wall. The top of the bookshelf was covered with trophies of varying sizes and color. We're here to watch. \"...That's really creepy.\" Hush. There was the sound of thudding footsteps before the bedroom door was flung open and the targeted girl entered. \"Leave me alone, Josh!\" she yelled before slamming it shut and running to her bed. She covered her head with a pillow and let out a frustrated scream. Her long brown hair fanned out behind her. She couldn't have been more than twelve years old. Someone knocked loudly on the door a few moments later. \"Amelia Prescott! What do you think you're doing?\" The woman's voice was as slurred as it was loud. The girl lifted her head long enough to tell her mother to go away before curling back up. The woman continued her racket only for a few more moments before giving up and leaving. It is always easier when the family is already fractured. When they are too attached to one another, it becomes a bit more difficult. It is not hard to bring out my chosen child's potential, though. He realized he was watching the last normal, sane minutes of this poor girl's existence. She was so full of life, and that life was going to be used to feed this demon. \"Please...\" He barley realized that he'd even said the word out loud. Bughuul laughed at him. You know that nothing will stop me, Deputy. With a snap of his fingers, they were back in the room that the man had, at some point, came to recognize as his. Bughuul pushed him down on the couch. Wait here. I will come back when I get everything in order. With that, the creature was gone again. He could do nothing but wait to see whatever horrors Bughuul was planning. X He must have dozed, off because the next thing he knew, Bughuul was shaking him awake. Come along. My plan is about to be set in motion. You were always curious as to how I went about this, yes? He gulped nervously as he stood and followed the deity. He wanted to know how Bughuul hunted so he could stop the monster, not take field notes. They returned to the doorway between the two worlds. There was a little girl with black braids and overall shorts waiting for them. The man could see Amelia sleeping in bed. Bughuul nodded, and his ghostly minion skipped into the bedroom and went to the bed. Luring them in is a delicate process. Some of my children are more talented at it than others. Amelia woke with a start. She let out a little cry when she spotted the other girl. \"W-Who are you?\" she demanded. The girl laughed. \"Hi there! My name is Jackie. What's yours?\" \"...Amelia. What are you doing in my room. Are you one of Josh's or Dean's friends?\" \"This used to be my house.\" \"Used to be? Then what are you doing here?\" \"Mr. Boogie wanted us to be friends!\" \"What? Who is that?\" \"You'll see. He really likes you! Here, I have a picture of him.\" The former deputy turned his head from the scene. \"She seems like a smart kid. Why isn't she more suspicious of a stranger in her room in the middle of the night?\" I can sense loneliness in her. All lonely children will latch onto the first companion they find. And I can have a rather calming effect on children, if I wish so. \"Is that why they don't run screaming at the first sight of you?\" Humans have such a limited perception of beauty. Some children do run, but I know how to make them stay. It is akin to how one soothes an animal before wringing its neck. \"Do you want to play Hide and Seek? I have some friends who would love to meet you!\" \"But what if my parents hear?\" \"They won't, don't worry.\" The children giggled and smiled and left the room to play their game. That...didn't seem like much. \"Is that it? The ghost kids just hang out with them for awhile and then it's familicide time?\" I told you, Jackie is acting as a lure. Soon enough they will show her their films. She will become malleable in my hands. She will love me when it comes time to reveal myself. She will do whatever I command. \"Wait, didn't I break your camera?\" That earned him a headache. I had another. He turned back to the empty room. He wished with his everything that he could stop this. He dedicated his life to stopping Bughuul after the Oswalts died, and now he was stuck watching on the sidelines. He felt more helpless than ever. Silly human.[Chapter 4] It was torture to watch Amelia Prescott fall into Bughuul's web. For three nights in a row, the demon made him tag along and watch the poor girl hang out with Bughuul's ghostly victims, hapless to the fact that she would soon be one of them. They went through what were, probably, the usual motions: the ghost kids would play around for awhile before sitting Amelia down and showing her their macabre movies. She was scared at first, shocked that such a thing could be done to one's own family. But Bughuul's influence was powerful, and the former deputy despaired as he saw the repulsion slowly leave her eyes. It went on to where the kids would talk to her during the day. They never had anything good to say. Their purpose was to push her toward Bughuul. Amelia's family made it easy. They weren't horrible people. The mother had a temper when she drank, which was often. The father worked long shifts to give his family an extravagant lifestyle. The older brother was a show off and loved to tease his younger siblings. The little brother craved the attention his parents denied him and turned to his sister instead. But Amelia was only a child, and would see her parents as neglectful, Josh a bully, and Dean a whiny nuisance. It wouldn't be long before she decided she was better off without them...or whatever the kids thought that made them commit the sacrifice Bughuul. (Sacrifice to Mr. Boogie. Sacrifice to the Boogie Man. Okay, that sounded kinda funny -) ...Human...I don't know what to do with you sometimes... The day Bughuul finally revealed himself, the human was off to the side. He would try and warn the girl away, and Bughuul couldn't have that. But the deputy would stay and watch. He wasn't sure if this was sadistic fun or more of Bughuul trying to \"teach\" him. Amelia approached Bughuul slowly. Her face shown the expected fear. It was natural, she was in the presence of a monster. His gut twisted when her expression changed to one of reverence. Still afraid, but respectful and willing to listen. They stood and looked at each other for a few long moments. Bughuul had to be saying something to the child. Was it threats? Sugar coated promises? Some weird, ancient hypnotism spell? Whatever it was, it must have worked. The girl's lips twitched into an eerie little grin and she walked right into the arms of the creature that would be her doom. The former deputy looked away. The whole scene was so wrong . Some of the ghost kids were off the side, also spectating. Jackie looked on with pride, obviously happy that she'd pleased her dark god. The others looked fairly neutral, as if this scene was a cartoon episode they'd already seen a hundred times. In the eyes of one little girl, however, the deputy could see conflict. There was enough humanity left in her to recognize the life that would soon be lost, and the damned child was mourning that. As he gazed upon them for a few more moments, the human felt pity swelling. The children often looked horrifying, and their actions made it easy to think of them as little mischievous goblins. It was horrifying to think of them as the innocent kids they once were. Pale, small bodies in various stages of decay, being eaten alive by a monster. Did they suffer, or did they stop caring after awhile? Did they despair over what had they become? Did any of them ever try and escape? He shuddered as he imagined Amelia with rotting skin and an eerie smile. How long would it be before she was like them? The girl turned her head to look at him with an unreadable expression. She raised her finger to her lips in a shushing gesture that had become way too familiar. X \"Please, don't do this.\" Bughuul looked up from the ancient stone tablet he was holding. The small whites of his pupils focused on his pet. The man was standing only a few feet away, the lute Bughuul had given him to play with laid abandoned on a chair. A thin eyebrow rose over the dark pits that were his eyes. He had heard that phrase countless times over the years. What are you talking about? \"You know what. Amelia and her family. Please...just leave them alone.\" Oh, now this was amusing. His human had never seen Bughuul capture prey like this before. He wondered if the man would have been like this for Zach and Dylan Collins if he had the chance. Probably, yes. A foolish need to help others was ingrained in the human. Bughuul knew that watching him and his children at work was torturing the man, and Bughuul loved it. Bughuul set down the slab and took a few steps toward his pet. And why would I do that? I'm always looking for new souls to add to my collection. The man gulped nervously. It was obvious he knew this wouldn't work, but he was still trying to save the girl. How brave and foolish. \"But don't you have enough souls to keep you full for a long time?\" He choked on the words. He didn't want to say them. \"You don't need Amelia. You don't need anyone else for a long time.\" Oh? Bughuul reached out and touched his pet's cheek. He laughed inwardly as the man flinched. And let us say me and my children did leave the girl be. What would come of it? The girl would still harbor feelings of resentment towards her family. She might snap and dispose of them anyway, and I would not even be able to reap the benefits. \"How do you know?\" the man challenged. \"She might go back to normal. She could grow up to be a great person. She could compete in the Olympics or cure cancer or – or save the rainforest. But you have to leave her alone!\" The desperation in his voice was adorable. And then what? You cannot possibly be asking me to starve myself. I will just move on to another child. Maybe I'll find one that is not so sweet and innocent looking. Would you be so adamant on saving a child who was already cruel and disrespectful and had no future ahead of them? \"Yes, I would!\" was the immediate answer. I look forward to putting that to the test one day. Bughuul moved his hand from the man's cheek to his jaw and gripped it firmly. The action was met with a weak sound of protest and narrowed eyes. I will not leave Amelia and her family alone, human. Bughuul's tone was both stern and mocking. I will never let any prey escape. I wonder how long it will take for you to accept that. Months? Years? I might keep you around for centuries just to find out. \"I'll never -\" Oh, I think you will. No human is immune to change in their minds and souls. Mark my words, one day you will cheerfully stand by my side and assist me in whatever I desire. The fear in the man's eyes made his sealed mouth water. X It was a cool and clear evening when the Prescott family died. Two adults and two young boys were strapped to large bullseye targets. The burlap sacks over their heads did little to muffle their cries of confusion and fear. The sun was setting over the park the family had gone to. That afternoon, the parents sat on a bench while their sons ran around with other kids. Amelia went off to practice her archery. When she knew no one was looking, she sneaked off to a think group of trees and filmed them. She joined them only when she brought them plastic cups full of poisoned lemonade. (He seriously didn't want to know what that green stuff was.) She waited until the last lingering families left before the ghost kids helped her drag her doomed relatives to the targets. He and Bughuul stood off to the side where they could have a good view without impeding the shot. Of course the high and mighty god couldn't be bothered to get his own hands dirty. This was work for the little ghouls. A cold and strong hand gripped his wrist firmly. There would be no leaving this spot for the former deputy. No way to break free and run to the family's rescue. He choked back tears. These people could have easily been the Collins'. But no one was going to come and hit Amelia with a truck and destroy her camera for them. He wanted to close his eyes and wait for this gruesome scene to end, but Bughuul wasn't having that. Watch closely, human. Take a moment to appreciate the set up. See how the red glow of the sun casts light on them all. How they've been arranged largest to smallest. Amelia is standing uphill from them not only to ensure she does not miss, but to provide a good camera angle. My children put much thought into their sacrifice to me. Come, look. Take it all in. Love it as I do. The man knew that wasn't a request. With a bit more prodding, as in a stabbing pain in his head, he did as Bughuul said. If he mentally removed himself from the situation and imagined this was a high definition movie, it wasn't so hard. He was far from calm as he watched Amelia raise her bow, a long brown braid flowing gently in the wind behind her. And yet, he wasn't panicking, either. Somehow he manged to just accept this situation. He could tell Bughuul was pleased. Amelia fired one arrow after another, all hitting her family. She drew it out, showing off for the being that twisted her mind. Shins and arms and hands and joints were all hit and penetrated before she got serious. Swift as bullets, the metal arrows then tore through heads and necks and hearts. No hesitation, no mercy. Four lives ended in a matter of minutes. All done by a girl who would never realize or care about how much they all loved her. They watched as Amelia stood in front of the camera and did a shushing gesture. He wondered why they bothered. Just in case any more potential Ellison Oswalts were watching? Bughuul tightened his grip some as he lead the former deputy over to her. She looked to Bughuul and smiled, but her eyes betrayed the fear she still felt. Her expression turned to confusion as she looked upon her new master's companion. \"Who's he?\" He couldn't hear Bughuul's answer, but Amelia looked pleased. She likes you. And so Bughuul took the girl's hand and took her back to his world. Amelia was still scared, as she should be, but she seemed to know where she belonged now. The man could almost share the feeling. I'm proud of you, my pet. The cold touch moved from his wrist and touched his hand affectionately. You have made great progress today. I am sure you will only continue to grow from this moment on. X Something about seeing Amelia be corrupted must have broken him. The deputy wasn't completely gone – he still knew himself, his past, his likes and his dislikes. He still knew being stuck with Bughuul was terrible and fucked up. He knew that there a bright and good world just out there waiting for him. But until now, he still held out hope that he would actually be able to escape and return to a normal life. Settle down with Courtney and raise Dylan like his own. He could get a new job at a small police station and they would all be happy. No more Boogie Man or bad memories to haunt them. With the collection of that little girl's soul, the man lost that dream. He realized that he was just a weak human against a god. He wasn't a coward, but he wasn't brave or strong or smart. He had only gotten this far on luck and Bughuul's mercy. He thought he had been one step ahead of the demon when he was tracking down his haunts across the country, but Bughuul could have killed him at any time. He couldn't save the Oswalts and he couldn't save anyone else. The Collins' were only part of that dumb luck. Maybe being an amusing little goof was all he was good for. He grew more sullen and desperate by the (supposed) day. He withdrew as much as he could. He threw himself into the books and instruments Bughuul left him so he would have an excuse to not leave his couch. He quickly lost his temper when he encounter those accursed children. Why did he ever pity them? They let themselves be manipulated by an ugly monster and ruined so many lives, including their own. Most of them just looked annoyed when he snapped at threw things at them as if they were rats. He got an idea of what they would be like as teenagers. Others, ones that haven't been trapped in this netherworld for very long, looked upset. He felt a small pang of regret when he saw the hurt in Ashley's eyes after he turned her away. But, he remembered, she was the reason a man he really admired was now dead. She would soon be as horrible and grotesque as the rest of them, and that's what she deserved. Ending up in Bughuul's stomach was all that lay ahead of her. (Or however Bughuul ate. Yet another thing he didn't want to know.) Bughuul, of course, was happy with his new attitude. His unwelcome touches were now more affectionate then intentionally unsettling. The man was shown visions of crowded music halls, sculptors and painters hard at work, and intricately designed buildings being constructed rather than more senseless death. Bughuul seemed more willing to teach him how to play instruments and draw and read foreign languages instead of just leaving the human to his own devices. Not that the former deputy wanted any of that, but it was a nice change. I told you that there was much I could teach you. Bughuul's voice somehow seemed softer, more gentle. The man's head was resting on the demon's shoulder. Bughuul held a thick novel in his hands, but the human was simply trying to relax. It was a comfort he wasn't often allowed. Even though he would prefer to be alone right now, it was better than nothing. \"What you mean?\" he murmured, never moving from his position. You know what I mean. Bughuul's hand came to rest on his head. You are finally adapting to me and my realm. Once you have given in willingly and completely, I can give you eons of knowledge. I can make you powerful in the ways of arts and magic. The former deputy snorted. \"Sounds great. Not interested.\" His current apathy made him bold. He could feel the smugness radiating off his captor. That is fine, my pet. I can wait a bit longer.[Chapter 5] The former deputy vaguely remembered the fairy tales of his youth. Not the Disney ones with Prince Charmings and fun songs and happy endings. No, he recalled once, when he was a pre-teen, he read an old anthology of the Fair Folk. The Sidhe courts, the Fae, who were beautiful and immortal and loved to trick humans. His younger self had been entertained by tales of mortals who entered the Fae realm for mere minutes and found that years had passed back home. Or sometimes the vice-versa happened, and they would spend years as a faerie's pet and return home to find everything the same. A terrible thing to happen to anybody, but there was no way it was real. God, he wished he still had that mindset. Those Faerie tales were the closest thing he had to compare to his time with Bughuul. Bughuul never tried to take his soul or strike a sketchy deal or dump him into a lake of fire, so he must not be an actual demon. At least not in the traditional sense. Maybe he was one of those in-between creatures that lived by their own rules and thought too highly of themselves. Of course, he wouldn't ask Bughuul about it. He would just get another \"I'm a god you stupid human blah blah blah\" speech. The human didn't want to give Bughuul the satisfaction of letting it know he was thinking about it. The dark being was already narcissistic enough. But how could he not wonder? Bughuul was the only company he had nowadays. What was Bughuul's past? Was his entire existence nothing but killing and art? Not that he was terribly curious, but it seemed odd to go this long without knowing Bughuul on a deeper level. It was like never learning the name of your boss. His memories of life before Bughuul were fading more and more everyday. At least, what he thought was a day. He never did learn about the passage of time in this realm. Was it the same as the human world, or was it controlled by Bughuul? He knew he had a life before all this. He had parents and friends and coworkers and a purpose. But with every moment with his captor, every memory pushed into his head, every child he failed to save, it faded more and more away. The man tried so, so hard to hold onto what was left of himself. Bughuul didn't make it easy. It seemed as time went on, the demon became more and more determined to own the man completely. Obviously, Bughuul could control him physically. It was the human's mind that he had to work for. It was like carving an ice sculpture with a butter knife. It would take time and focus, but eventually it would become what the demon desired. The former deputy noticed himself changing, sometimes. He would go for long periods of time without thinking about Courtney or Zach or his mom. He would not be tormented of the thought of dead children and families he failed to save. He would be glad to be in Bughuul's company. What else but the deity offered any real companionship or entertainment in this dark place? It wasn't like he could talk to the hollow shells of children that roamed around. At least Bughuul understood what he meant when he spoke of more adult issues and feelings. He was slowly but surely turning into Bughuul's little puppet. The thought of that would have once upset him. X Maybe he had finally lost his goddamn mind, but the man could swear that Bughuul was getting more friendly. Not the \"hey buddy let's get some beers and watch the big game\" kind of friendly, but more like Bughuul was treating him as more of an equal. The demon's presence was never not domineering and oppressive, but the man no longer felt suffocated by it. It was just a feeling in the air that reminded the human not to step out of line. Bughuul was now oddly...enthusiastic about being with his captive. How they spent time together hadn't changed, but Bughuul genuinely seemed to want to share his knowledge with the human, and to amuse and teach him. Or maybe it has always been that way and the human refused to admit it. Once, Bughuul brought him a guitar. Isn't this particular instrument all the rage amongst humans nowadays? The man idly plucked at the strings. \"Yeah, it sure is.\" He knew at least five guys back in high school who were determined to start a band. You should learn how to play me something, then. As long as it doesn't consist of that racket most \"musicians\" make. He couldn't help but laugh. \"Not a fan of rock, then?\" He attempted to play the opening chords to \"Back In Black\". Every genre has its virtues. Perhaps it is just a matter of taste. Bughuul took the guitar back and, to the man's amazement, played the entirety of \"Hotel California\". The long, grotesque fingers manipulated the strings expertly. Guitarists with thirty years of experience couldn't have played it better. With time comes experience. The demon's voice was playful. Who would have ever imagined Bughuul was capable of that? Would you like me to teach you? The man hesitated. The offer was tempting. But why was Bughuul asking? Did he have some ulterior motive, or was he just bored? Surely Bughuul would rather be teaching the human some old hymn about itself than an Eagles song! And yet… hey, what did he have to lose? Why not enjoy himself for once. \"Sure. I'd love to learn this.\" He could tell Bughuul was pleased. Arrange your hands like so… X There was nothing no god loved or coveted more than a willing servant. To have a being who had the utmost respect for it, who would obey and listen and pray and offer to it. To love and adore it and keep it's name alive. To devote their whole selves to their lord's will. That is what Bughuul had been lacking for thousands of years. Even in his prime in Babylon, he never had true worshipers. All the attention always went to Moloch. Bughuul never understood what his brother had that he did not. They were the same in almost every way. And yet, it was Moloch who had statues graven in his image. It was Moloch who had temples and priests and servants. It was Moloch who had fresh infants sacrificed to him on a regular basis. It was Moloch who was remembered . Bughuul still reeled over the shame his brother caused him. How could he not see that Bughuul had been starving? True, their kind was not merciful. Bughuul seldom had visitors to his sparse, run-down temples and they only came after paying homage to his brother. It was not his name that was whispered in fear amongst Nergal and Ereshkigal and Anu's. It was not him humans plead for clemency from or turned to help for their silly problems. There was no appreciation for Bughuul's fine knowledge of art and music. There were plenty of other gods to turn to for inspiration. To the mortals, Bughuul only existed to eat. So why sacrifice their young when they got nothing of value in return? It didn't help that their attitude soured his temper quote often. More people died than what was perhaps necessary when this happened. So surely Moloch, who possessed everything Bughuul did not, would not notice when his bother stole some of the young souls that were meant to be the elder god's. Bughuul hadn't even taken that many – just enough to ease the ache of hunger. But Moloch found out, and the temperamental bull had taken away Bughuul's mouth, along with his pride and reputation. He lost any respect that he had amongst the gods and went into exile. The wounds dealt to his mouth healed, but the mental scar never would. As with the rest of them, his name and visage faded with time. But they had plenty of things to remind the mortals of their existence. Bughuul only had his symbol and the art his children made for him. It was after Babylon fell and the world moved on that Bughuul required the children he captured to record their sacrifices and then pass on that knowledge to another. That way, Bughuul would never be forgotten. He would never starve again. And yet, the way humans continued disrespected him over time bothered him. Really, who would have the gall to destroy his images, his art, his passageways like those \"Christians\" did so long ago? So many less opportunities, so much less food. He was pushed even further into the shadows. But he made sure those few images were preserved. Those who came across them suffered at his hand. His blood lust only rose after each ritual. What he loved about this modern era was how easy it was to record and show images. He lured in children quickly and efficiently with the help of technological toys. He couldn't remember the last time he'd been this full. And while having so many ghostly servants at his disposal was grand, it wasn't the same as having true followers. Bughuul desired someone who was not under his possession, and yet still loved him and was loyal to him. He wanted a human who was devoted to him and him alone. There were not many volunteers, so Bughuul made his own. His pet human had come a long way from being a small town police officer. Good-natured and intelligent but never taken seriously. Potential squandered on trying to stop things that were far out of his control. Long hours at work keeping him from any craft or higher cause. Being in Bughuul's care had done wonders for him. The man became harder, but not unapproachable. His focus and want of control over other beings grew stronger. He would be a natural leader amongst other humans. The children showed more respect toward him now. They knew their master's right hand man when they saw him. It had taken some work, but the former deputy had let go of many of the ideals and creed of his former life. What good was protecting humans when they sinned so readily and caused so much harm to each other? What good were screaming brats than to be food for his god? What good was any life outside of Bughuul's realm? Bughuul knew the human sometimes wondered how time passed in his realm. Bughuul could indeed control it, to an extent. He often made it run slower in order to make his souls last longer. It only speed up when a new family moved into a bait trap. He used the extra time to train and mold his human to the perfect disciple, the most devoted prophet. It was just as he always wanted since he brought the man here. He learned from observing the religions of Western families that humans liked the idea of a god that loved them. They would give themselves over to a being that promised eternal love and protection. Bughuul did not think he was capable loving anything or anyone like that. But his fondness for the human was always growing. Bughuul knew even now he would never let the man go. Bughuul would keep him safe in his realm and untouched by time until the universe collapsed in on itself. And the man would be glad for this. There were many plans Bughuul had in store for them. But one small issue stood in the way. His pet still held on to the lingering remains of his old life. Those would have to be disposed of before he could become a full-fledged priest. It was time to put his training to the test. He found the man reclining on his couch with a book. A common sight. Come here. His human jumped up and rushed over to Bughuul's side, eager as a puppy. \"What is it?\" There was still something to be desired in the way of respect, but at least the disgust and apprehension was gone from his voice. He took the human's uninjured hand and squeezed. (It was beyond him why the man refused to let Bughuul heal that particular wound.) I need you to come with me. I have a task for you. X The past four years had not been easy for Courtney Collins. Of course, life had not been easy since she met Clint. But at least then she had hope. She had her boys and her health and for a brief moment, she found a man she could trust. The man who claimed to be a former deputy was one of the few good men she ever met. He wasn't doing his private investigation work for money or fame or attention. He was a good soul who had only wished to help people. For a night, Courtney thought she could keep this man. She thought the universe was finally cutting her a break. She could live with a kind man and her boys could have a positive role model. But he was snatched away right after she lost her baby Zach. (The way Clint died was horrible, but she had no reason to mourn him for long.) The events of that night would never cease haunting her. Dylan, God bless his little soul, had done his best to explain to her what had happened. Ghost children, snuff films, family sacrifice – it was all so bizarre. If she hadn't seen the monster herself, she would never have believed a word of it. Bughuul. Courney never did any research on the monster. It was hard enough that the thing killed her son and the man who tried to save them all. She was afraid that trying to find out more about Bughuul would only summon it to cause her more misery. Courtney did her best to move on, for Dylan's sake. Her baby still needed his mother. With the loss of Clint, Zach, and the deputy, they were all each other had. The one stroke of good fortune was that Clint left her everything in the will. They had plenty of money to pack up and move to a newly built house across the country. No one knew them or their story. They could start over and build a new life. How ironic that this was the first time in her life she felt truly free. Dylan struggled the way most kids would. He blamed himself and cried at night and clung to her. These were wounds that only time could feel. He was twelve years old now. Still a little timid, but he had friends and did his best to be happy. He rarely spoke of his brother or the events of the farmhouse. Courtney knew it was too painful for him right now. She had just returned home from work. It was a modest job at the local craft store. They received enough business for her to have a steady income along with the inheritance. Courtney could leave in time to meet Dylan as he got off the school bus. They would cook dinner together and talk about their days before going to do their own thing. It was a good routine for them. She just wished Zach was here to share it. This evening went the same way. After washing dishes while Dylan went to watch television, Courtney only wanted a warm bath and a nice book. But as she put the last plate on the drying rack, a terrible feeling came over her. It was a burst of cold coupled with a deep, foreboding dread. When she turned around, the deputy was standing right in front of her. Courtney gasped and staggered back against the sink. The caring man she once knew looked so different. His once tan skin was pale and gaunt. His eyes were dead and his mouth was set in a firm line. Her eyes strayed to his left hand. The same two fingers were still missing. \"It's...you,\" she gasped. \"You're alive! But-but how ?\" \"How do you think?\" he responded, voice monotone. \"Bughuul saved me.\" \"It saved you?\" Courtney echoed. She could hardly process those words. \"I thought that thing had killed you!\" Something flickered in the man's expression. \"Bughuul spared my life when he could have taken it. He took me into his world and showed me a better way.\" Courtney felt the sting of betrayal. What had happened in that motel room years ago?\"A better – How could anything that monster showed you be good? Do you even remember what he did to Zach? To the Oswalt family?\" There was a crack in the icy expression. His face scrunched up in confusion. God, had he forgotten them already? \"How long were you gone?\" His expression saddened. \"I-I don't know. It feels like it's been fifty years.\" The more they talked, the more alive the man seemed to become. She needed to keep him interested in the conversation. The dreadful feeling had not left her. And yet, despite that, she couldn't squash the small bit of hope that this man has returned to her for good. \"Mom?\" came her son's small voice from the doorway. \"What's going on?\" Dylan's shocked expression must match her own. He was looking at the deputy like he was seeing a ghost. To both adults' surprise, he rushed over and wrapped his arms around the man. \"I thought he took you, too.\" After a moment, the man hugged Dylan back. \"He did.\" \"Why are you here now?\" Courtney asked. \"Did it let you go?\" He stiffened and let go of Dylan. He shook his head as if to clear it. \"No. No, he didn't.\" Fear overcame her. She knew they could not fight the monster, so they needed to flee. She would not have it in her home. Courtney grabbed her friend's good hand. \"Let's go. Right now. We can run away like we were going to back then.\" The man didn't agree, but he returned her grip. \"No. Courtney, listen. You – you have to get out of here. Take Dylan and – Ah!\" He took back his hand and clutched at his head. \"What's wrong?\" Dylan whimpered. \"I can't fight him! Please -!\" They all noticed when the dark form appeared in the room. It was the monster that took her son and ruined her life. Bughuul. He was looking at the former deputy in silence. \"No, please! I changed my mind! I can't do this!\" He doubled over in pain. Courtney knew Bughuul must be the cause of it. Anger pushed its way through her fear. She grabbed a chef's knife from the rack and pointed it at him. That got his attention. \"You bastard! Leave him alone! Go away or I'll kill you!\" She got the feeling he was laughing at her. Bughuul sauntered over and gripped the man's dark hair. It must be communicating with him somehow. It took a few long moments of tense silence, but the struggles and the protests stopped. His expression became cold again. \"Yes, I know. I'm sorry, I just – I know.\" Bughuul stroked the man's head like he was a dog and stepped back. The man who used to be a deputy and her friend and protector stepped forward and took the knife from her hand. She knew how this would end. She clutched Dylan to her and covered his eyes. He mouthed \"sorry\" at her before the blade came down. X Bughhul observed the scene around him with glee and pride. The kitchen was painted with the blood of Dylan and Courtney Collins. Four years ago he hoped to see them burn, and now he was able to see them bleed. His pet had done a remarkable job. Through teary eyes, the man ended the lives of those he once loved. All because Bughuul requested it of him. True, he stabbed them through the hearts first and then drained them of blood, but the results were the same. The look of fear and betrayal in their eyes had been delicious. He should have brought one of the children to film it. The human knelt on the wet floor and stared at his crimson stained hands. He was forcing his mind to remain blank so he wouldn't cry over what he'd just done. Bughuul knelt before him and placed a hand on his shoulder. I know this was a large task. I am very pleased with you. The man made a choked little sound and kept his head down. Bughuul could not have that. He grasped the man's chin and lifted his gaze to meet his own. You have done as your god requested. You should be standing tall with pride. I will not have you mourn over those two. You know why they had to die. The momentary lapse of control over his future priest was troubling. He should not have hesitated. But there was still plenty of time for further training. \"I don't feel proud,\" the man admitted. It came out as a whisper. He knew it wasn't what Bughuul wanted to hear. Bughuul framed the man's face with his hands. You will someday. I will help you learn how to repress this wretched pity you feel. You know I am your only path to happiness. There is nothing for you in this world and tonight you have cemented that fact. Your place is by my side and nowhere else. The man didn't look completely convinced, but he smiled and nodded. Bughuul guided his pet to his feet. Come, let us go home. ","Summary":" Bughuul was not sure why he brought the meddling human into his realm. He had gone to that cheap mo"},{"Movie":"Sinister","Title":"Sweet Sacrifice","Author":"AngelicaMyers95","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12082490","Passage":"[Chapter 1] It was a cold Sunday afternoon on Piedmont Way. People gathered to pay their respects to Mr. and Mrs. Miller as well as their younger son since the three of them had been brutally massacred in their beds just days before, while their older son went missing. The tragedy took the whole neighborhood by storm. The Millers were beloved by their neighbors and according to most, they were the closest thing to a perfect family. The wake was organized by Mrs. Miller's younger sister Julia with the help of her husband Thomas and Mr. Miller's parents, Agatha and David. The first car that arrived was that of Merle Collins. He came to pay his respects along with his wife and his younger son Clint who'd brought along his girlfriend, Courtney Wheeler. Merle Collins knew William Miller from high school and they'd been best friends for nearly twenty-five years. Merle was simply heartbroken when he heard what had happened to a man he'd considered to be almost like a brother to him. Upon stepping out of the car, Merle walked over to William's parents and hugged them both as well as offered his condolences. His wife and son followed soon after. Courtney offered her condolences as well but she felt uncomfortable since she'd never met these people before. She didn't want to come to the funeral in the first place since she'd only seen the deceased on a few occasions at the Collins mansion, but since Clint seemed pretty beaten up over their deaths she decided to go anyway. Soon more people started showing up, making Courtney feel like she's suffocating in the crowd. I don't belong here , she thought to herself even as she firmly held Clint by the hand. She wanted to go outside and light a cigarette so badly, even though Clint had scolded her many times for smoking. After the funeral, Courtney managed to sneak off into the backyard since Clint seemed to be having a deep conversation with William's parents. She couldn't help it but carefully take out a cigarette from her purse and light it up. Upon inhaling that first smoke she felt her anxiety decrease slightly. Courtney began to feel chilly but she didn't care because she needed to finish that cigarette. She got lost in her thoughts and didn't even notice Clint coming towards her until he called her name, startling her a bit. -Cour, what did I tell you?- he said quietly but she was able to detect a hint of anger in his voice. -I know, I know.- she said still holding the cigarette- I'm sorry, but I need to finish this one. -Courtney – -Just one, okay? I didn't even want to come here… -So why did you?- his voice seemed calmer and gentler now- I didn't forcibly take you by the hand and drag you here, all I did was ask. -I wanted to be there for you, but this just too much for me. Clint sighed and hugged Courtney. -I'm sorry you feel like you're out of place here, but it means a lot to me that you're here to support me. Moments later, another car pulled up, catching everyone's attention. David recognized the man coming out of the car and angrily stepped out of the house. -Jesus Christ, don't you know of common courtesy?!- he said furiously- I'm burying my boy today along with my daughter-in-law and my grandson! -Mr. Miller, I'm here to pay my respects to the family I assure you – -I've heard about you, Ellison Oswalt!- David's voice began to break- I've heard the lengths you'd gone to so you could get the juicy details! -David go back into the house.- Merle stepped in- I'll deal with him. -Get him the hell out of here!- David yelled as Agatha led him back into the house- I don't want him anywhere near this property! Merle turned to Ellison and crossed his arms. -So are you going to leave or will I have to make you? Ellison didn't want to get into a fight with Merle since the man was much taller than him and definitely looked like someone who could do some damage, so he just put on a sour smile. -Fine, I'll leave…- Ellison turned around and was about to leave but he stopped after a few steps and turned back at Merle- But just you know, I'll find that Miller kid and you'll all owe me a big apology when that happens…- Ellison couldn't help it but smile a bit. -Get out!- Merle hissed through his teeth and Ellison picked up the pace to his car. Hours later the Collins family decided to go back home and they dropped Courtney off at her house before going back to theirs. Soon after arriving home, Courtney phoned her friend Gill to tell her about what had happened at the funeral. -Boy, that Ellison guy really doesn't know when to quit…- Gill laughed- I wonder what it must be like to be that hungry for fame… -You shouldn't wonder about it too much since you have a few demons of your own that need handling.- Courtney laughed. -Oh and what about you, little miss perfect?- Gill teased- No demons that need handling? -Maybe just the smoking... I seem to be doing that a lot lately. -Could it be because you're nervous about being future Mrs. Collins? Courtney sighed. -I'm not getting married until I finish college, I've told that to Clint a hundred times. -But he seems to be preparing you for the role. -The thing is, I don't want any of that inheritance he'll get when he comes of age. If we do get married at some point I want to be with him without his family hanging over our heads. I saw just how much they're controlling Richard even though he's twenty-three and doesn't live with them anymore. I don't want the same thing to happen to Clint. -Lucky he's got you to pry him away from his pestering parents. -I'm not saying that they're bad people, but they can get too controlling at times. -Yeah… I have to say, I'm glad you've decided to give me a call since it's been a while. -You know why that is. -I still think your prejudice towards Joss is silly. -He gets high on a weekly basis and he drinks a lot which causes him to be unbearable company! Honestly, how can you be with him? -I know what he's like when he's not high nor drunk. Those are just things he's gotten addicted to when he was younger to help him cope with the death of his parents. I know he wants to change his ways and I can help him. He doesn't even drink that much anymore, I'm helping him cut it down, possibly quit altogether. -It won't be easy getting him off of those things, Gill... -I care about him and I'm willing to go through it. -Suit yourself…- Courtney mumbled to herself. -You wanna hang out tomorrow after school? -I can't, I have to meet up with Stomberg to decide what we'll do for our project. -For film class? -Yeah. -I can't believe that you got paired up with Stromberg, he's such a nerd. Then again so are you when it comes to artsy stuff. You seem to be a match made in heaven! -Sure. Bye. -Wait! It was just a joke. -I know. I'm not offended, I'd just like to go to bed. -Right. Well, I hope you call me sometime soon again.- Gill sighed- I really miss you C. -I miss you too, but you make it seem like you and I can't hang out without Joss being there. -We can, I swear. Just tell me when you'd like to meet. There was a slight pause for a few moments. -I'll give you a call during the week or I'll just find you in school and we'll see. -Okay.- Gill said, sounding genuinely happy- Night, C. -Good night Gill…[Chapter 2] The following day, after she was done with her classes, Courtney rushed over to the coffee shop she agreed to meet with Stromberg in, so they could discuss the project. Once inside, she spotted him sitting in a secluded corner, looking at some papers and walked up to him. -Hey. He looked up at Courtney, seeming slightly nervous. -Hey.- he said quickly-Sit down. Courtney sat on a chair opposite from Stromberg's. -So, what are we going to be doing? -I thought we could do a documentary on various cults. I've got some good material to get us started. Courtney smiled. -Be honest, how long have you had the material? Stromberg blushed a bit and smiled awkwardly. -A while, it took a lot of time to gather it… But if you don't want to do it – -No, I want to. Although, since you have all this information, what am I supposed to be doing? -You can go over the info and write the script. We'll have to condense all this to be half an hour long. As you can see, it won't exactly be a piece of cake. -I'm up for the challenge. -Great!- Stromberg exclaimed with a rush of excitement- When you're done with it, we'll film it. I'll be the host, if that's alright. -That's fine… Are those all the things I'll be reading?- Courtney glanced at the pile of pages scattered across the table. -Yeah. Meanwhile, in a one bedroom apartment across town, Ellison was looking over the statements he'd gotten from Christopher Miller's classmates during lunch break that same day. Apparently, Christopher had only attended the school a little bit over a week before the murder took place. His family had moved due to financial problems and the reason they moved to St. Louis was because they had friends there who could help them out. One of the statements said that Christopher seemed normal most of the time and that he even made a good friend during that period, but there were moments when he seemed eerily disconnected as he'd just stare off into the distance looking at nothing in particular. Ellison flinched as he heard his living room door open forcibly and turned his gaze towards it only to see his friend Nathan standing there with nothing but his boxers on. -Sorry if I startled you, the door got stuck. Ellison sighed in relief. -Looks like you're still recovering from last night. I knew opening up that whisky bottle and consuming it in one night with you was a bad idea. -It wasn't. We were celebrating my freedom. -So, last night when we talked about your plans for the future, were you serious about dropping out of school? -Yep…- Nathan carelessly threw himself on the couch and turned the TV on. -What about that whole wanting to be a sheriff thing? -I can't pay the college tuition on my own... -That's not a reason to not graduate high school. You can do that at least, even if you don't plan on going to college. -I don't know anymore… Now that I've finally left my father's house I can do something meaningful, you know? -Like what?- Ellison crossed his arms- Freeload on my couch for the rest of the year? -No. I could… I could help you with that case you're working on. -Just how do you plan on helping me? -Have I ever told you that I'm really good at sneaking into places? -So what – you're going to steal the crime scene photos for me? -I can photograph them and copy the police reports. Ellison stared at Nathan, surprised by his response. -I never thought you'd be the one to turn to delinquency. I mean, you want to be a cop, for fuck's sake... -It's my father's fault that I'd resorted to that. He had days when he wouldn't let me get near the fridge and he didn't even want to hear of me getting a part-time job. -Jesus… I didn't know the situation with your father was that bad. -It doesn't matter what it was like, I'm never going back there. Later that day, Clint picked Courtney up from home so they could help clean up the Miller's place since Clint said to William's parents that he'd like to aid them in cleaning it up. -You should take it easy with that project of yours. -Clint said- It's not that important… -It's important to me. I wouldn't have taken on film class if I didn't want to fully commit myself to it. It's important that I do well, for my college application. Clint turned and placed his hands on the wheel, gripping it slightly. -Cour, we've talked about this. There's no need – -There is if I want to pursue a career in that field! Making it in any artistic department in the future would make me happier than simply being Mrs. Collins. -I see… -It's not like I don't want to marry you someday… I want to be with you but the thought of your parents constantly being over our heads scares me. Clint turned his gaze to Courtney. -To hell with my parents! They don't even think that you're right for me and I don't give a damn about it! I just thought there'd be no need for you to go to college because I would be willing to provide for you. For us, and for the kids that we could have in the near future. -I appreciate that, but I'd be happier if you'd support me in pursuing this dream. Soon they arrived at the Miller's house where they were greeted by David since his wife had gone home due to the stress of being in that house. -Both Agatha and I appreciate what your help, truly.- David said. -It's no trouble at all.- Clint said- In fact, Courtney and I should take care of this by ourselves and you can just take the boxes away afterwards. -Oh I couldn't ask – -Please, I insist. -Look, if you do fancy anything here feel free to take it. I'd already packed the things that Agatha and I would like to keep. I know you may want to take some of the boys' stuff to keep their memory alive. -I suggest keeping all of Christopher's things. After all, he could return to us. -I want to believe that he will, dear boy. I desperately want to believe it… David patted Clint on his shoulder and shook hands with Courtney. Clint escorted him out of the house, leaving Courtney alone, letting her mind fill with dread. She could've sworn that there was someone in the house, watching her. She turned, thinking she'd find someone standing behind her. She looked around the room and there seemed to be no one there. Courtney sighed and decided to head outside to see why Clint was taking so long but she stopped in her tracks when she heard what sounded like a man breathing. It was clear, but she couldn't tell where it was coming from nor did she want to find out. As she sprinted out of the hall, she bumped into Clint. -Hey, why the rush?- Clint held her lightly by the shoulders. -This is going to sound crazy, but there's someone else in the house! -That's impossible. You, David and I were the only ones in here. -I know, that's why I'm so freaked out! I heard a man breathing moments ago! -Calm down. Where was the sound coming from? -I don't know... I think it may have been coming from upstairs. -I'll go and check it out.- Clint moved past Courtney and picked up his pace to the kitchen, getting a hold of the largest butcher knife. -Clint wait!- Courtney ran after him. Clint headed upstairs and checked all of the rooms there. He couldn't find anyone in any of them so he decided to check the attic. Courtney joined him there soon after only to see that there was no one there either. -See? There's no one else in the house with us.- He put away the knife and kissed Courtney on the forehead- I'll go and get some boxes so we can start packing stuff up… When Clint left Courtney began to feel uneasy again. Still, she couldn't help it but go deeper into the attic which was pretty spacious. As she went further and further a box standing in a dusty corner caught her eye. She knelt down and opened it. Inside the box was a projector, an 8 mm camera and four super 8 films titled Pool Party '66 , Barbecue '79 , Lawn Work '86 and Sleepy Time '98 .[Chapter 3] Courtney was mortified after what she'd just witnessed. It took her a few minutes to regain herself after what she'd seen. Once she and Clint were done cleaning out the old Millers place, Courtney took along the box of films she'd previously found. Clint thought that it was strange she wanted to watch home movies of people she'd barely known but he didn't bother her about it for too long since it seemed to be just another one of the weird things Courtney did he couldn't understand and couldn't really care for. She loved old home movies especially super 8 or 16 mm ones since her grandfather gave her his old camera when she was ten years old and taught her how to use it because of her fascination with films and photography from early age. Old silent films were the most aesthetically pleasing to her eyes and would always give her a sense of nostalgia. She never even dreamt of the horror she would witness upon starting the first film. It was Sleepy Time '98. Courtney began to feel uneasy even before the gruesome imagery that was to follow because whomever was filming this was walking around the house at night. It just didn't look right to her and soon she saw why as she witnessed the Millers being butchered in their own beds. Even though she was disturbed, Courtney couldn't keep her eyes off the film nor could she stop her morbid curiosity and check out the other films as well. Courtney knew what she needed to do. She'd have to notify the police and she wasn't going to wait any longer to do it, but as she was about to reach into her pants pocket for her cell phone, she felt a presence again and heard the same heavy breathing she did earlier that day in the Miller house. -I wouldn't do that if I were you.- a deep, commanding voice spoke to Courtney, sending chills down her spine and making her move her hand away from the pocket instantly, with the phone still inside. She didn't even dare to turn around and face whomever was standing behind her, but she still felt the need to speak. -Who are you?- as she asked that question her voice trembled. -I am Bughuul, the one who's going to claim you now. Courtney picked up the courage to turn around and as she did, she let out a gasp and then covered her mouth. She recognized Bughuul from some of the films that she'd watched although he was only in them briefly. -You're wise not to scream. Courtney removed her hand from her mouth and reached behind her hoping that she could grab something sharp to defend herself with but Bughuul spoke to her again, distracting her before she could do anything. -It's useless to try to resist me. You did what I needed you to do, now you're mine to take. Courtney's eyes filled with tears. -I didn't do anything…- she whispered as she cried. -That's not entirely true. You did grant me passage into your world, into your life, your memories. Even your thoughts. I'd never been able to reach out to anyone in such a short period of time, but you let me in earlier, somehow. -It definitely wasn't because I wanted to.- she sounded almost confident. -The reason doesn't matter. What matters is that you're mine to control now. Courtney began to feel helpless again as she stared at Bughuul for a few moments. She knew that this would get her nowhere so she took a deep breath and gathered up the courage to try to leave the basement but he stopped her and grabbed her by both arms. She found herself only inches away from his face. He stared at her with his empty eyes for a few moments and then she collapsed in his arms. Bughuul picked Courtney up and conjured up a parallel image of the basement which reflected itself through the projector that he'd also started again with his mind. He glanced at Courtney one more time before carrying her into the frame and making it disappear, moments after his entrance. Sometime later, Ellison was looking over the statements he'd looked over countless times before. He didn't want to sleep, fueled by his desire to uncover the mystery of the Miller murders and Christopher's disappearance. All he could see was the fame and glory that would follow once he solved the case, believing that everyone will stop hating him once he solves it. -Well, I'm off to get you what you need.- Nathan startled him and he flinched. -Jesus!- Ellison nervously took another sip of coffee. -Sorry, but it's not like I tried sneaking up on you… You should try this thing called sleeping , it's really good for you, especially when you look like that. -I don't need to be patronized. Just go and try not to get caught. -They won't even know I was there. The following day, inside of the local coffee shop, Stomberg was anxiously staring at his watch. He'd agreed to meet with Courtney again and they were going to go to his house from there to work on the project more efficiently but she was late. Twenty minutes late at that point. He'd tried calling her cell several times but got no answer. Eventually he gave up and went home, but it didn't seem right to him that Courtney would just bail on him like that and he tried calling her again since he was worried something may have happened to her. After all, he didn't remember seeing her in the school halls and that was unusual because she would always be in the same spot during the lunch break, sitting on one of the benches, sometimes alone, sometimes with Gill or Clint, but she would always be there when she came to school. He didn't think she was sick either because she would've let him know if she wasn't coming to school. Surprisingly, this time someone picked up the phone, but it wasn't Courtney. -Sorry to disturb.- Stomberg said- I'd like to speak to Courtney Wheeler, if that's possible. -Oh, you're the boy she's doing her project with. I'm her mom, by the way, sorry if I startled you. -No you didn't.- Stomberg lied- Is Courtney there? -I'm afraid you can't disturb her. She came home sick. She said that she was with one of your friends. That Gill girl. Stomberg wanted to say that he only knew Gill in passing and that Courtney couldn't have just gone along with Gill when they had to work on the project but he figured that Courtney lied to her mother for a reason and decided to keep it quiet and ask Courtney about it once she gets better. -I understand. Tell her I wish her a speedy recovery. -What was the name again? -Stomberg, ma'am. -Stomberg. I'll make sure to tell her that you called. Courtney lay in her bed, left drained from the stressful night she'd had. She hoped that everything that had happened was just a nightmare, but Bughuul appeared to her again letting her know that it wasn't. He slowly approached her bed and took her hand into his, causing her to flinch slightly from his cold touch. -I expect you to do as we agreed or there will be consequences.- he said while looking at her hand. -I hate you….- she hissed through her teeth, seemingly unafraid. -I hope we'll be able to change that in time.- he was now looking at her rather than her hand- You have so much potential in you, it nearly fascinates me, and I'm not easily fascinated by anything…- he let go of her hand- I'll be going now, but don't take too long in making your decision, it won't work in your favor.[Chapter 4] By nightfall Courtney had managed to pull herself together and was ready to call Stomberg back. Or at least she's convinced herself that she could do so after nearly an hour of staring at her cell phone. -Hey, Courtney. How are you?- Stomberg asked- You got me really worried there… -Sorry, I just wasn't feeling well….- Courtney bit her nail nervously as she stared at her own reflection- Um, I wanted to call you… But I was just – -You were too busy hanging out with Gill? Courtney bit her lip not knowing how to respond. When she came home in the afternoon she was exhausted as well as slightly disoriented and had to come up with a lie quickly so her mother wouldn't ask too many questions. She immediately regretted calling Stomberg without coming up with a decent lie. -Why did you lie?- Stomberg asked but all he got was silence- Look Courtney, I don't know what's going on in your life right now, but if you can't do the assignment… Courtney cancelled out whatever Stomberg was saying and nearly dropped the phone as Bughuul appeared in the mirror, a few feet away from her. She turned to see that he was there in the flesh and didn't know whether she should hang up the phone or not. All she could do in that moment was stare at him. She decided to hang up after all after, rapidly uttering \"I'll call you later.\" to Stomberg. -I do apologize for interrupting your conversation.- Bughuul paced a few steps towards Courtney- But I can see that you're better. You have yet to give me your answer…- he touched her face and she turned away in disgust- I was looking forward to having you make the sacrifice, but I'm sensing that you've already decided to let someone else get hurt… -Why don't you just kill me instead? -You know that I wouldn't do that. I'd rather have you in my realm with me, but some sacrifices need to happen first. -And I'd rather die than be in your realm!- Courtney was surprised at the aggressiveness of her own voice. Bughuul took Courtney by the wrist and pulled her closer, causing her to lose the confidence she had in a blink. -You're forgetting yourself, Courtney. Don't let me remind you of what I can do as it could be harmful to your loved ones...- he let go of her wrist- I expect that you pay a visit to Ellison Oswalt tomorrow. I know he left you a way to contact him so don't try to make any excuses. Courtney frowned. -I thought you only took children… -Oswalt's researching the Miller case and he managed to get a hold of the crime scene photos which allowed me to take a peek at his miserable life. I saw that he has a friend residing with him. He's about your age. -Nathan? But who would he sacrifice? He doesn't even live with his father anymore. -I'm sure he'll be more than happy to move back in with him once he sees the films. You need to make sure that he does. -So if he does murder his father, then what? You take him along? -You shouldn't be jealous, he'll only be there so I can feed. -I'm not – Before Courtney could finish her sentence Bughuul vanished and she sighed, now annoyed that he didn't let her finish. She was bound to him now and didn't know how she could break that bond. For now she'd just have to do what he asked her to and pay Ellison Oswalt a visit the following day. Something strange happened to Nathan that night. He had a nightmare which hasn't happened since he'd left his father's home. He recognized Courtney there, a girl he only knew in passing. She was crying, holding an axe in her hand. \"Please, just do it…\", she said to him, \"Please…\". He wasn't sure what was it that Courtney wanted him to do exactly, but judging by the axe in her hand it seemed like she was asking him to end her life. \"What is it that you want me to do?\", he asked. There was no answer, only a scream. Nathan stepped back but bumped into someone. He turned to see a monstrous figure with empty eyes and no mouth. Courtney's screams became louder and the figure touched him causing him to start fading. That was when he woke up in cold sweat. He saw Ellison standing before him. -You look like hell…- Nathan said a few moments later, trying to get up- You'll die before you get to solve the case if you keep this up. -You shouldn't worry about me. What the hell just happened?- Ellison asked- You looked like you were having a pretty bad nightmare. -Yeah, well- Nathan got up- Sometimes people have nightmares, I'm sure even you've had your share of them. -Do you wanna, um… talk about it?- Ellison asked even though he was visibly uncomfortable. Nathan shook his head and grabbed the whisky bottle. -No. I'd rather catch up with another friend.- he gestured with to the whisky bottle in his hand and took a sip from it as Ellison watched. -Look, I don't like getting involved with people's problems, but - -Then don't.- Nathan interrupted Ellison- I know this is already making you pretty uncomfortable. -Regardless, I don't want to see you turn into an alcoholic. You don't take alcohol nearly as well as I do. -Don't worry about it. I won't let the booze kill me until I'm done helping you with this case…- Nathan took another sip and put away the bottle- Speaking of which, how much did I help so far? Ellison got up and took one of the photos. -I've examined everything you got for me and the only thing that was never mentioned in the records was this symbol… - Ellison handed the photo to Nathan- It's not clearly visible but once you've had a good look at the photo it can be spotted. It seems to be the only thing that the cops have overlooked so far. It took a bit but Nathan eventually spotted the symbol Ellison was referring to and it gave him a chill since that same symbol appeared in his nightmare. -Do you happen to know what it is? Nathan nodded away nervously and placed the photo back on the table. Ellison noticed that something was wrong. -Either you're lying to me or you're just freaked out by the symbol – I'd bet on my first assumption. -… You know, I could use some fresh air.- Nathan got up. -Now?- Ellison frowned- It's nearly three a.m. Nathan put his jacket on. -I'll be fine. I'll just take a quick walk around the block. Won't be long. - he said and left before Ellison could do anything to stop him. Ellison sighed and gazed at the picture on the coffee table. He took it into his hand and found himself staring at the symbol for quite a while until a shadowy figure with a single glowing red eye out of the corner of the photo caused him to drop it. -Nathan?- Ellison inquired trying to catch his breath. The room felt colder than before and he could've sworn that there was someone else in the room. He tried to shake it off as nothing more than paranoia but he felt like he was being watched. He glanced back at the picture and picked it up again, with his eyes locked on the symbol. He decided to take the magnifying glass from his desk and take a better look and that was when he saw a pair of empty eyes inside, with that glowing red dot, which caused him to drop the magnifying glass. -Jesus!- he screamed and backed away. Ellison ran to his bedroom and grabbed the baseball bat he had by his bed, then went to sit on the living room couch. He stared at the whisky bottle for a few moments and grabbed it, draining whatever was left in it, eventually letting himself drift off to sleep.[Chapter 5] Ellison awoke from his sleep sometime in the early morning since there was a knock on the door. Groaning, he checked his watch to see that it was nearly eight. He hoped that Nathan was already up and that he'd open the door, but as the knocks persisted he realized that wasn't going to happen, that he was possibly still home alone, so he forced himself to get up and open the door. -Surprise! Ellison's eyes widened, as he was indeed taken by surprise as his girlfriend Tracy jumped up to hug him. -Tracy, what are you doing here?- he asked, backing away with a slight frown. -I know that we agreed to spend this anniversary away from each other because of your work, but I wanted to see you.- Tracy said, still waiting for Ellison to invite her in or at least step aside so she could enter. -This early in the morning? -I thought you'd be happier to see me.- Tracy turned away and sighed. As she reached for the doorknob, on the edge of tears, Ellison took her by the hand and she turned to face him again. -I'm sorry, I didn't mean to be like this.- Ellison said, caressing Tracy's face- Last night was pretty rough and I barely got any sleep, that's why I'm upset. Tracy sighed. She wanted to tell Ellison to give up the idea of going after the person who murdered the Millers, that he'd get himself into trouble, but she knew that she'd just be wasting her words just like all the other times, even though she felt that this was something far worse than anything he'd ever tried to uncover. So, she just gave him a kiss and said \"Then you should get back to bed.\", then smiled weakly and added \"I'll make you some breakfast when you wake up.\" Nathan awoke on a cold bench, covered in his own vomit. He gagged from the smell, then hastily got up and ran to the nearest restroom he could find, trying his hardest to keep the balance. Luckily for him, there was a coffee shop just across the street and he ran in there. Once inside, he got some strange looks but not too many people were bothered to lift their gaze when he entered, even though he looked like a wreck. When he got to the restroom to wash off what he could with water and soap alone, Nathan tried to recall how the hell he even wound up on that bench in the first place. Then he remembered bits of the nightmare that had upset him previously. He needed to get out of the apartment and he needed some more booze to calm his nerves, so he went back to his father's house and observed him until the old man passed out drunk. Once inside the house, Nathan grabbed a whisky bottle that was half-full and two beer bottles, then got out of the house and headed to the park that was about two blocks down from it. Strangely, even late at night, that park seemed far more comforting than his own home. Nothing had changed since he was a child. Even though he was older now he was still afraid of his father and he hated himself for not being able to stand up to the bastard. Some cop you'll be! – he thought to himself that night, as he drained the second beer bottle. Looking at himself in the mirror now, as he let it all sink in, Nathan sighed. -Pull yourself together, man.- he said in a whisper and let out a small chuckle, then shook his head- I'm going nuts… Courtney nervously rubbed her arms as she walked towards Ellison's building. She knew the area quite well, all thanks to Gill. But knowing the area didn't stop her from feeling uneasy. Sure, she didn't want to murder her family for that monster, but she wasn't so sure she could lead someone else into his clutches to be sacrificed either. The monster wanted her and she was willing to go along to save others, but he demanded sacrifice first. She thought of seducing him, pretending that she'd fallen for him for whatever reason, but she was afraid that he'd see right through her. She did find something attractive about him, even though she wouldn't admit it to herself, but what she found so appealing was what anyone encountering him would. She thought that he had to have something naturally appealing about him if he wanted to tempt his victims and slowly lure them away from the physical world as he'd done to her. Courtney wanted to shake off the thoughts of the time spent in his netherworld, but it was useless, images of it wouldn't leave her mind. She liked the sound of his voice when they were there. He seemed kinder when she regained consciousness. It was enough to give her courage to ask him to let her go, but that upset him and she tried to flee. She tried desperately to find the exit, even though she knew that there was a small chance she could do that on her own. The more time she spent there, the more she resented the cold and the silence. It became terrifying after a while and Courtney found it hard to breathe. She found herself wishing that the monster was there with her, only because she was terrified of staying alone in that darkness any longer. The room she hid in grew colder with each passing moment. She couldn't even cry properly, struggling to shed tears which gave her a headache. She couldn't release them for some reason, not until he appeared in the room before her. Once he was there, she crawled to him without much thought and grabbed on to him, wrapping her arms around his legs, finally weeping and releasing the pain. She begged him to end her, but he picked her up and cradled her in his arms instead. She knew that he was enjoying her vulnerability, but she was too lost and afraid to resent him for it then. When they were there, she didn't want him to leave her. That changed when he brought her back to the physical world. Now his hands feel too cold and she finds him repulsive, sees him for the monster that he is. But, if her going back to his world would save everyone, she'd do it in a heartbeat. Not because she's selfless and kind, but because she hadn't felt alive for a while now, even though she didn't want to admit it to anyone. The monster had brought out the darkness she'd tried so hard to get rid of. Once she got to the front door of Ellison's apartment, Courtney found it hard to press the doorbell, standing there for nearly five minutes before finally deciding to ring it. -May I help you?- asked Tracy when she opened the door, leaving Courtney confused, but also hopeful that Ellison had moved. -Does Ellison Oswalt live here? -Who's asking?- Tracy inquired with a frown. -Courtney Wheeler. He was at my school asking around about the Millers and everyone he talked to got his card. Is he here? -He can't see you now.- Tracy said coldly, feeling a bit jealous- Try calling next time. As Tracy got ready to slam the door in Courtney's face, Ellison ran up to the door, having only heard bits of Tracy's exchange with Courtney. -What's going on?- Ellison asked, moving Tracy away from the door. -This girl says she's here to talk to you about the Miller case. Ellison checked Courtney out and noticed a box marked 'home movies' beside her. She must be a dedicated fan , Ellison thought to himself. -What did you say your name was?- he asked. -Courtney.- Courtney said unenthusiastically. There was something about Ellison's face that irritated her. -Courtney.- Ellison repeated, shaking hands with her, putting on what he'd call his 'TV smile'- Let's see what you've got for me.

Her mother ran in, holding her almost-hyperventilating daughter to her chest. \"Shhh, shhh. It's ok. You're ok.\" Her father walked in, a concerned expression drawn on his face. \"This is the third night-\" \"Not now, Isaac,\" Sasha sharply whispered. Isaac knelt beside the bed, resting a comforting hand on his daughter's back. \"Ensley, honey, what was it?\" Sasha asked, stroking the shaking child's hair. \"It's alright, mommy.\" Ensley felt some force not her own was willing her to hedge. She wouldn't say. She couldn't say. \"You can tell me, Pumpkin.\" Her mom saw in her eyes that something was bothering her. \"I'm alright.\" Ensley moved out of her mother's embrace, and back to the warmth of her covers. \"I'll be ok.\" \"I hope so, Sweetie,\" Isaac replied. Ensley smiled up at her dad. Her mom kissed her goodnight, flicked the light off, and left. Ensley turned into her pillow, noticing a tall, dark figure in the corner of her room. Moonlight slightly illuminated an eyeless, mouthless face framed with long, dark unkempt hair. He wore a suit with a long overcoat, giving him a clean, regal appearance. He didn't scare or intimidate her, for some reason. She immediately was drawn to him with a childlike fascination. Only eight years old, Ensley Harper proved to be more difficult than he'd expected. Innocence, yes, but fear...fear was a key player. Using fear or insecurities to lure his prey to do his bidding. But this one? She had neither. The child's eyes snapped open again. \"Don't you have anyone else to watch?\" she said suddenly. She knew who he was. Her brother Mason was obsessed with the string of murders spanning decades in the past. Another roadblock. He stepped towards her bed, her eyes glistened in the light. \"Not right now, young one,\" a deep, more soothing than chilling, voice said in her mind. \"But you also do not know my intentions.\" Ensley got out of bed and slowly walked towards the figure, who towered over her, more than a regular grown-up. \"You the boogeyman?\" \"That is what children - and uneducated adults - call me, yes.\" She stared at him in awe, as if she was in some type of trance. \"You gonna hurt me? Mason says you make kids kill people. And then you kill them. I don't wanna. I love my family.\" \"I know you do, child. I have no such plan in mind for you.\" he told her. That settled it, he thought. This one wouldn't be the food or sacrifice he would need. \"Then... why are you here?\" Ensley asked, rubbing her eyes sleepily. He picked her up gently, and laid her back into her bed, placing her blanket over her. She reached her hand out to touch his, for some reason. She looked up at him, a questioning gaze over her face. \"One day, you will understand.\" In a nanosecond, he was gone. Ensley sighed. If he was the same one haunting her dreams, why was he so nice? Maybe he wasn't \"haunting\" them, so much as simply appearing in them? Too late for \"big thoughts\", Ensley thought to herself. She yawned and nestled into her covers, slowly falling asleep.[Chapter 2] 11 years later/Present Day Who had filmed this? Ensley - Syl - thought. Even more so, why did the file suddenly appear on her computer? Mason had told her about several accounts of the boogeyman acting like a computer virus. ...Why did that thought suddenly pop into her mind? Syl remembered that night, talking to the boogeyman, not knowing, in fact, if he was real or not. Sure Mason was obsessed with the whole thing, but her parents were skeptical. No evil entity was responsible for the murders. Just the children. She grew up forgetting either side. Not caring. It is, or it isn't. But she was filled with a petrifying curiosity now. Had he done this? And why now? It seemed, though, every time in her life spanning from age five til now, when there was a rough patch, there were dreams. He was always in those dreams. Never failed. All night every night for months following her father's death. It was after the encounter, she presumed, that the dreams didn't scare her. They distracted her from the pain; they comforted her, even. But the precise memory of the encounter with the Boogeyman had faded, even though her dreams kept his image freshly imprinted in her mind. ** Ensley, then 16, woke up with tears streaming down her cheeks again. It had been a month since her father had died. She suddenly didn't feel so alone. She felt safe. She felt loved. He had taken up the role of guardian, for all intents and purposes. He knew why, too. But right now, the only thing he should be thinking of is protecting her. Comforting her. Helping her feel safe, and not alone. Her eyes, puffy glassy with tears, were not any different than when she was a toddler. The same look behind them would stay her whole life. The same spark of wonder would stay behind them forever. She took ragged breaths, trying to calm herself from crying again. He saw the brother come in and try to talk to her. The brother left after several minutes. How he wished he could manifest himself now to comfort this ailing soul. Ensley fell asleep, feeling as if someone had took her in their arms. She wouldn't realize until later that it was not her father after all. ** \"Whatcha watching, kid?\" Syl's roomate Natalie asked. \"Uh, old home movie...\" Syl replied, thankful the video was over. \"Can I see?\" Natalie replied. \"Or is that your fancy word for po-\" \"Nat. Please.\" Natalie laughed. \"Joking, joking. Hey, I'm going out tonight, need anything?\" \"From...?\" Syl asked. \"I dunno. Food? Drink?\" \"Surprise me.\" \"Okee dokes,\" Natalie said. \"See ya.\" Syl nodded slightly and turned her attention back to the video. After hearing the door slam shut behind her roommate, she replayed it. Silent, jittery film. Different rooms and hallways in her childhood home. Mason rocking out with his stereo, holding an invisible microphone. Her mother and father - \"Oh, daddy...\" she whimpered. They were sitting on the couch watching tv, giggling together. She swallowed the growing lump in her throat. The video darkened and panned to a dark room with a screaming child. Tear-stained cheeks buried into her mother. A silhouette in the corner of the room. Suddenly, a face appeared and the video ended. It hadn't been there the first time. But she wasn't watching closely then, thanks to Natalie, she told herself. \"I remember you...\" she whispered. \"You were just in my head. Just...in my head...\" Syl shuddered. The memory of his calm, soothing, honey-like voice was crystal clear. \"Just in my head. I need a drink,\" she added with a cuss under her breath.[Chapter 3] Syl poured herself a glass of wine and sat on the couch, flicking the tv on. She settled into the cushions and took a sip. Not three minutes into her show, she heard a thump upstairs. Neighbors, probably. Sip. Another, closer thump. Longer sip. Gulp. A loud crash. Jump. Pour some more. Silence. Gulp gulp. She stood up slowly and turned towards the stairs. Sighing, she turned back around, only to come face-to-face with her old friend, the Boogeyman. How cliche , she thought, rubbing her eyes. Surely it must be the drink. She wasn't scared. She stepped back, tilting her head. He studied her, just as he had when she was young. Not much changed, not accounting for her adult appearance. A chill ran down Syl's spine now. She stared at him. Never seen him in the light before. Scary, intimidating, ...alluring. She was going to say something along the lines of \"Are you going to say something, or just stand here?\" but nerves and alcohol had her nearly lose her lunch, instead of actually speaking. She breathed in deeply. \"You remember, do you not?\" his voice filled her mind with honey once more. Syl nodded, another chill, but not of fear. \"I do. Tell me, was I...not good enough...to be your demon-child minion?\" she asked. She tried to sound confident, but her voice was shaky, even bitter, if anything. \"I didn't want you to be one of my children. It's different now.\" \"But now, I'm not a child.\" Why was she talking to a hallucination? \"No...\" He swept the tangle of hair from her sweat-covered forehead in a quick movement. \"You aren't.\" Syl broke her stare. \"What do you want? You going to kill me, feast on my soul now ?\" \"I never planned on consuming your soul,\" his telepathic voice replied. \"I remember. What do you want?\" she whispered, looking back up at him. \"As a child, you were not afraid of me, or hardly anything. I needed the fear. You had the innocence I needed, but now it is different. You are still innocent, but you are afraid of me. You are afraid of more now, because of your pain. That combination is rare in humans your age.\" \"Listen, Boogeyman, I don't care if you've been haunting me my whole life, which it seems you were. But yet I really don't care what you do to me. I also really want to know what my purpose to you has been. 20 years is a long wait.\" \"Isn't it...\" he said quietly, almost melancholy. \"Don't you have anyone else to screw with?\" Syl wondered. \"Same brazen confidence, but now, you are literally radiating fear.\" Syl rolled her eyes. They were magnets suddenly drawn back to him, studying this ..thing. She recalled the same reaction when she was younger. Something about him attracted her, she could not stop it. Something about him, how he spoke so calmly. How he moved so regally. How he was somehow so attractive to her, in the oddest ways. She caught herself thinking too much about his appearance when images started burning into her mind. They were images from the dreams replaying. They were some of the \"stories\" Mason obsessed over made real in her mind. As if she had been there, recording it all. He was doing this. She blinked heavily. \"Ensley,\" he whispered. \"What I want from you is your death.\" \"Could have dealt that any time between my birth and now.\" He shook his head. \"Immortality.\" \"What?\" Syl exclaimed. \"I will take your mortality from you.\" Syl almost laughed. \"Very funny, but I'd rather die than spend eternity blindly roaming the universe or whatever immortal things do.\" \"I want you to have the opportunity to travel throughout all universes and realms with me.\" \"With you? You want me ... to live forever... with you.\" Syl asked. He nodded slowly. \"What if I don't agree to this?\" \"You already have.\" Of course she has. She knew she had. \"What about this life?\" \"It's done. You will not belong to the human realm any longer.\" \"Why do you want me ? Of every single human on this planet, you choose me.\" \"Simple,\" he said. \"As a child, I couldn't use you. But now, you are what I need. And you are alone. You know you are.\" \"With you, away from earth...\" Syl trailed off. \"And not alone.\" \"I'm still not a killer.\" \"Thus the innocence,\" he replied. \"I don't expect you to do anything you do not desire. You want this. I need this. Let me take your mortality. Let me keep you. Let me protect you.\" \"Can you protect me from yourself? You honestly want me to believe I can do whatever I want, even if that means not killing, not coaxing kids to do your bidding, and all sorts of other ...things?\" \"My servants do my bidding. They have no choice. You will not be my servant, Syl. You will be my equal.\" \"Equal...\" she repeated. \"Why? I have no reason to trust you. I don't trust you.\" She had no reason not to. She stood silently. Blankly staring at him. No thoughts. Mostly shock. She almost numbly felt his hand caress her face. She felt her hand rest itself on his chest. She felt his hand in her hair. She felt herself leaning her head into him. She numbly whispered, \"Take it.\" She snapped herself out of the robotic motions. Only to feel the weight of his head being laid on hers, his hair brushing the sides of her face. Only to hear a quiet, sincere, \"Thank you.\"[Chapter 4] Syl sat bolt-upright from her bed. She looked at her phone to see what time it was. Morning, with a dull headache. Cracking her neck to each side, she cleared her mind. Some dream... Yet, she could still vividly feel him. She thought she remembered being taken up to her room, gently laid in bed and tucked in, just like the first encounter. But it was just a dream. They both were just dreams. She grabbed her phone to check the time. Sighing, she dialed her brother. He picked up after two rings. \"Syl?\" \"Hey, Mase,\" she said groggily. \"You sound like death, you ok?\" She laughed hoarsely. \"Eh, hungover...and some disturbing dreams again.\" \"Oh, well then...\" Mason replied. \"Did you finally go out with Natty?\" \"No, I was by myself.\" Her tone changed, and Mason felt that. \"What's wrong, Syl?\" \"How's Taylor, and the baby?\" \"Two months out, both doing well,\" he replied. \"Hun, why did you call?\" \"Did you...did you give up... on those murders?\" she asked sleepily. \"Ensley. We were children, then. You know they had logical explanations, not involving the boogeyman.\" \"You didn't answer me, Mason.\" There was silence on the other end for several seconds. \"Yes. I did,\" Mason replied, not sounding extremely confident. Syl sighed. \"He feeds on children.\" \"Murderous kids, maybe some serial killer in makeup, the guy probably lived in those houses. Look, kiddo, I'm not going to talk my 25 year old sister out of believing in the boogeyman. He is not real.\" \"Then explain my dreams, Mase.\" \"You had a subconscious obsession, apparently. Used him as some sort of security blanket. Real weird, Syl. Most kids avoid thinking about monsters and boogeymen,\" Mason replied. \"What's this about?\" He came to me and he's taking me to his death world . \"Nothing. Sorry.\" She rubbed her head. \"Tell Taylor hi from me. Love you, Mason.\" \"Syl.\" \"Sometimes, we make up our own realities to shield ourselves from the truth,\" she replied. Like trying to convince herself she was only dreaming, when she knew this had happened in reality. Mason sighed. \"I know what you're implying...\" He himself knew he had forced himself to forget. Especially once he met Taylor. Especially when they were expecting. The thought petrified him. So of course he would forget about it. Of course it was all a hoax. \"I saw him, Mase. Once when I was five, and then yesterday.\" \"What do you mean?\" Mason exclaimed. \"He came to my room when I was younger. He didn't hurt me, and he told me he wasn't going to. Since then, I was the only kid not afraid of the boogeyman...\" \"And yesterday?\" he replied hesitantly. \"Yesterday, he...I...we...he...\" her tongue was locked. \"Remember when mom would ask about my night terrors? I couldn't tell her. Those dreams weren't scary after I met him, but yet he didn't want me to say anything. And right now... he doesn't.\" \"Why not?\" \"I can't tell you, Mason. Just know... I love you... and, I owe this to him. You're always my number one. But I owe this to my guardian, who never left me. Like you never did, but different, alright? This is different.\" \"What do you owe the Boogeyman? How do you owe that soul-devouring piece of-\" \"Mason! I can't tell you, alright? I want to explain everything, but he won't allow it,\" Syl replied. She hoped he would get sort of a hint. \"He's always been and always will be my protector and guardian, he told me that.\" \"And I haven't? You actually believe him? What's happening? Ensley, tell me!\" Mason yelled. \"Yes, yes of course you have. You've always been there for me. But it's different now. You're too far away. You have a family, Mase. I'm alone, alright? And I have no reason not to believe him. I can't tell you. Please, Mason. I love you, bro. I love you so much.\" \"Syl, whatever you're doing, don't.\" \"I love you, Mase.\" \"I love you, Syl?\" He replied shakily. \"Good bye.\" She hung up. Maybe she was insane. She climbed out of bed, rubbed her eyes, and groaned, stretching out her back. She slightly stumbled to the bathroom to brush her teeth. The pit of her stomach roiled, and it wasn't because she was hungover. Her fate was sealed, she knew. She was sane, it had happened, she was going to leave it all behind. A chill of adrenaline rushed through her body. Again, but why? Why her?[Chapter 5] A/N: thank you for the favs/follows/reviews! I didn't expect this to get any attention at all so I'm very happy! Last chapter, no epilogue. But it's long so... Over Christmas break I plan to another (aka a non-fluffy, canon-er) Sinister fic. Ya know, once Sinister 2 is on Bluray, so I get to watch it over, and over, and over ...and get inspiration! Thanks again! Syl went back to her room. She sighed deeply. What did Mason think? Would he get the hint? He probably would, once he realized he couldn't remember the last time he heard from his sister. She glanced at her phone and dropped it with a gasp. The lock screen... the lock screen was them , as if someone snapped a shot from yesterday. She set her phone screen side down and got dressed. So it wasn't a dream , she thought. Of course it wasn't . She went back to her phone and gazed at his side of the picture, studying it with her same childlike admiration. Syl felt both a deep uneasy feeling, and an extreme sense of comfort. Sighing again, she tossed her phone on her bed and exited her bedroom. \"Nat?\" she called out. Probably crashed at some guy's house. Syl walked downstairs, rubbing her head. She rounded the corner and went into the kitchen. She poured herself a bowl of cereal, and sat down, head in her hands. Rubbing her temples, she straightened up and began to eat. Syl glanced at the time on the microwave and saw him in the reflection of the glass. She shot up and whirled around, eyes wide. They regarded each other silently for a moment before he walked towards her. Slowly, smoothly. The bottom of his long coat swaying gently with his strides. He looked so regal, so majestic; every bit like the deity he is. Her pulse quickened slightly. This was it, she knew. He was going to take her away. Syl gazed up at him, closeted doubt suddenly flooding her. \"Listen-\" she shuddered slightly, immediately silenced by his cupping a hand on her cheek, feeling him brush her mouth with his thumb. \"You're coming with me.\" The warm, velvety-smooth sound of his voice in her head sounded unsure, almost questioning. Syl took it as a question. \"Of course.\" No matter what, she owed her guardian this. Didn't she? She laid a hand on his arm, feeling his fingers gently caress her face. \"It's time, then.\" Syl bubbled with both fear and excitement. No going back. Why did he want her ? When you think about him, you don't really picture him as someone even remotely humane. And yet, here he is. But what if this is all a ruse? He's obviously a master manipulator, seeing how he captures his children. The worst he could do is torture her (...for eternity...) Immortal, with him forever. How was this a good idea? Yet, part of her knew nothing would happen. Not everyone has ulterior motives, but he's pretty bad. Sinister. Her fate was that she would no longer be bound to this single realm. No longer bound by death. She would live as his supposed \"equal\". In the end, however, her life would belong to him. He would treat her as an equal, but she would be powerless against him. Her fate would belong to him. Would he abuse that power? \"What happens if you get tired of me? Or if I somehow dishonor or disobey you? Torture me throughout the rest of eternity?\" Where were these questions yesterday, before I agreed? \"Syl,\" his voice filled her mind, somehow immediately reassuring her. \"Nothing you will do will be worth any amount of torture. I have waited millenia for you.\" That sent a barrage of emotions swirling through her head. He held out his hand. She took it reluctantly, but he held her with almost a desperation, as if...if he'd lose her forever if he let go. \"Why me?\" she whispered, still in awe. \" Why do you want - need - me?\" \"For the same reason you want this. You don't want to be alone for the rest of your life.\" He gently stroked the end of her hair. \"But I can't have you unless you give me your mortality. You could not survive with me in any other realm as a mortal, and I have no desire to be bound to a single dimension, as you can imagine.\" Syl's eyes dropped. Bughuul, the obscure yet extremely powerful deity, the boogeyman, the childhood obsession of both her and Mason, wanted her. Needed her. How was this real? How did she get so ...lucky? \"You remember those dreams,\" his telepathic voice was lowered, more emotional. Syl nodded slowly. \"You've felt my presence before. I watched out for you, as best as I could. I felt your loneliness. It was like mine.\" \"Lonely ...with all those kids?\" Syl heard her muddled thoughts manifest into words. Really, Syl? He did find that slightly amusing. He tilted his head slightly. \"As you are even with your brother, roommate, or coworkers. You know it is not the same.\" \"I know,\" Syl replied. \"I know. But...\" her voice trailed off. He sensed her reluctance. He knew he had told her she would be his equal, therefore, she would have her own say. She could still change her mind. \"I know you've agreed already. But you... you still have a choice. I am not forcing you. I am simply asking. Please.\" He sounded almost desperate, yet so sincere. He in no way sounded like the wretched child-snatching, soul-devouring \"boogeyman\" that he is. \"I've made my choice already.\" Any doubt still left in her head had vanished. \"You've been with me my whole life. You've never left me. You've seen me at my worst and you still chose me. Maybe that's why I took Mason's obsession so deep to heart. I've always wanted this.\" She stepped closer to him. \"I've always wanted you,\" she added softly. Her fingers gently went to where his mouth would be, and traced the ash-gray markings up his cheek. She ran her fingers through a strand of his hair and swept it out of his face. Syl's eyes locked onto him again. \"I'm ready,\" she whispered. His hand left hers and went around her waist. As he picked her up, she looped her arms around him, nestling her head into his neck. To her guardian's realm. Forever protected. Away from Earth. Away from death. Gone. ","Summary":" A/N: So I basically just wanted some cute little something with Bughuul because he doesn't get a lo"},{"Movie":"Sinister","Title":"The Art Project","Author":"LadyEpic101","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9552022","Passage":"[Chapter 1] \"So, Cissy, what do you think?\" Amelia Brewster-Thorburn asked her step-daughter. \"It's a big ass house,\" The dark-skinned girl replied, looking up at the mansion. \"Well, yeah. Got it for a steal, though. They say a family was murdered in here, under strange circumstances. Maybe it's another mystery you could solve,\" The spunky twenty something woman picked up the lighter of her stepdaughter's bags. Cecilia sighed, hefting her duffel bag up by the handles. She could see her half-sister's faced pressed up against the window next to the door, watching her intently, trying to decide if she was really there or not. Cissy smiled and trudged up to the doorway, barely sliding through with her bag. \"THITHY!\" Brook lisped at the top of her three-year old lungs. \"Hey, Beebee,\" Cecilia greeted, heading towards the stairs, \"Which room's mine?\" \"The one right nextht to mine,\" The bubbling toddler shouted. Laughing, Cecilia turned the brass knob with her free hand and pushed open the door, walking into a spacious room furnished with two mattress stacked on each other and a dresser. A large window let light in, making a four-paneled pattern on the wooden floors. She set her bag down and walked down the stairs, listening to her sister chatter on and on about the cartoons she had watched that morning. Leave it to Dad to have the TV up three days after moving in. \"Your dad was thinking that you could turn the attic into a mini-ballet studio so you can practice whenever you want, the ladder's already down and everything. It's totally empty, 'cept for a cobweb or two. Anyway, it's time for little miss Brook to have a nap,\" Amelia finally finished. Cecilia knew exactly where Beebee got her mouth from. Sighing, she turned away from the mother and daughter and trekked back up the stairs, walking down the hallway to a rickety looking ladder leading to a dark attic. She pushed her bag ahead of her, listening to the rustling of its contents. She finally worked her way into the pitch black attic; she tugged on a chain she felt tap her head. A pitiful lone light bulb managed to illuminate the entire room. It must have been at least thirty by twenty. Amelia must have missed something, because there was a box filled with old film reels and a camera in front of a sheet that might have been white once. Curious, Cissy tiptoed over to the box, kneeling down to get a closer look. The reels were all labeled like home movies. Cissy pulled one out. It read 'Pool Party '66'. She turned the reel over in her hands. It seemed really old, but still in good condition. One weird thing about the reels was that the time frames were so far apart. Maybe it was some sort of tradition, each owner of the house left a video to show its history. Curiosity overcame Cecilia, and she pulled out the projector and aimed it at the screen. After a second of technical difficulties, she managed to get it to play. A video of a family happily playing and eating around a pool popped up on the sheet. Cissy smiled. They looked so happy, but they were definitely not at the mansion. Suddenly, the tape cut. It was night, and the bodies of what appeared to be the family from earlier were laying on pool chairs. The camera panned over a vase with neon green liquid. A rope tied to the chairs was pulled, and one by one, they all fell into the water. She watched as their feet kicked and they struggled, before the footage stopped on an image of a man standing under the water. Cecilia stood from her criss-cross position and walked toward the screen. On closer inspection, she noticed that he seemed to be unaffected by the physics of the water. His eyes were heavily shadowed, no, they were non-existant. A triangular patch of black were all that marked his orbitals, contrasting sharply with his pale gray skin. The only defined features he had were a nose and brow ridge; his mouth was marked by black splotches lighter than his 'eyes'. \"Cissy! Dinner!\" Amelia shouted from the hallway. Cecilia jumped. She turned her head to look back at the trap door. As she told her stepmother that she'd be right there, the figure on the screen looked at her, then looked away just as she turned her gaze back to him. \"Coulda sworn you moved,\" Cecilia mumbled more to herself than to the strange man. She walked back to the projector and turned it off, leaving it in the middle of the room. (Late Night) Cecilia laid in bed, staring up at the ceiling. A dark blue comforter was draped over her waist, leaving most of her torso bare. Restlessly, the teen grabbed her journal from under her pillow. She fished opened it and grabbed the pen that held her place. She began to write. July 2013 Just moved into a big ass house. Someone was murdered her. Amelia's a try hard. There was a box and projector in the attic. I watched one of the movies and it seemed like some sort of art film. Except I don't know what sort of crazy CGI they used to get the creepy guy's image to be affected by the surface of the water, but not his hair or coat. (I'd be lying if I said he wasn't creepy in a kind of sort of a little bit hot way. This is why I need a therapist) Anyway, here's a crappy little drawing of what he looked like DRAWING -Cecilia Cecilia left her journal open next to her, in case she might think of something else to write. She didn't, and fell asleep. Bughuul stared silently down at the girl in her bed. Her family posed a new challenge. The youngest child wasn't old enough to carry out his will. But the older girl, she still had a childlike soul. It would do, but he had to be careful. The last time he had crossed paths with someone like her, he ended up sealed away for a decade. On impulse he reached out to touch her light brown skin. It felt like hot coals against his icy skin, yet it did not bother him much. He cupped her cheek, wondering what her soul would taste like. Cecilia dreamt that she was watching herself sleep from the foot of her bed. Out of the shadows, the figure from the video stepped to her side and stared down at her, watching her sleep. He reached his hand out to touch her cheek. As it made contact, she felt a calmness spread over her, even as her cheek felt like it was frostbitten.[Chapter 2] [REAL CREEPYPASTA CHATROOM.

A wondrous time of getting ass-lost in the winding halls of a new building. At least it was her last year. Cecilia sighed and shuffled off to her first class of the day: PE. Thankfully when she got there, the teacher - a young man that could pass as a very ugly woman- told her that today was just taking roll and making sure everyone had shown up. Cissy thanked him and sat down on the bleachers, pulling a spiral bound notebook out of her backpack. A pencil was jammed into the metal spring, and it didn't come out without a fight. The seventeen year old started sketching. The strange man had filled her thoughts lately. Not a night passed where she didn't dream of him standing over her, watching her sleep. It was disconcerting the way he looked at her, or didn't, rather. It was like she was just a meal to him, like he couldn't wait to devour her very soul. \"Hey, cool drawing,\" The sudden interruption of her thoughts made her jump. Sitting next to her was a guy, about her age, with a half-shaved head of red hair. \"Name's Byron. How 'bout you?\" He stuck out his pale, freckled hand. \"Cecilia, or Cissy. Just make eye contact, say something, and I'll know you're talking to me,\" she shook his hand. \"Coolio. Whatcha drawin'?\" \"Oh, nothing just- hey is that Jeff the Killer on your shirt?\" \"You're a fan of Scary Spaghetties?\" \"And Terrifying Tortellini,\" The teens laughed at their own cleverness. They spent the rest of the period discussing their favorite creepypastas, and the worst and funniest ones they'd ever read. All the while, they did not pay attention to the shifting drawings on the paper. What was once stick figures and disproportionate sketches became lifelike drawings of a very sinister figure. The bell rang, causing both Cissy and Byron to jump up and knock their backpacks onto the floor, spilling out the contents. In their haste to gather the notebooks and pencils and folders, neither noticed that one left with one book too many, and one left with one book too little. A very ancient being watched the exchange between his prey and another mortal. He had a strong dislike for others meddling in his affairs. He watched the boy and girl interact very closely. It seemed that the boy was attracted to his meal. Bughuul didn't like sharing, and decided to make that known. It was an unforeseen but fortunate stroke of fate that the boy, Byron, took the notebook containing his image. Now all he had to do was wait. Cissy arrived home from school early. She wasn't feeling well, so they let her walk the ten minutes home. She supposed that was the beauty of small town America. She wouldn't dare walk alone in her old neighborhood. The door opened with a creak and the girl locked it behind her. Amelia and Dad were at work. Brook was at school. The house was empty, save for her. Time to dance. All she needed to do was change, grab the old boombox and head up to the attic. That was accomplished simply enough. The wooden floors would make dancing difficult, but not impossible. She pressed play, and let the music take her over. It was just a warm up track, started out slow, and built up in speed and intensity. It was entirely contemporary dancing; Cecilia liked to challenge herself. She absorbed herself in her dancing, so much that she did not notice that the projector turned itself on. Finally, the song ended, leaving her sweating and out of breath. A cold light from her left caught her attention. An image of the man from the Pool Party video was projected on the screen. \"What the hell?\" The man tilted his head. Cissy jumped, then laughed at herself. Must be a coincidence. She stepped over to the projector and was about to turn it off, until she realized that there was no film in it. So, she knocked the projector over. Grinning triumphantly, she looked at the faded yellow sheet hanging from the rafter. The image of the man was still on it, head still tilted curiously at her. This wasn't happening. Anger filled her for reasons she didn't understand. She marched up to the screen and reached for the top so she could tear it down. Freezing hands caught her forearms. Her eyes went wide as she looked at the man in the image. From the wrist down, his hands were outside of the image, in the real world. That was impossible. She was hallucinating. She had hit her head and she was dreaming. A gentle tug on her arms confirmed that this was reality. She looked up at where his eyes should have been. He 'stared' at her, 'gaze' unflinching. He tugged on her arms again, as if to say, 'Well? Aren't you coming? I don't have all day.' Cissy planned on ripping her arms away from him and tearing down the screen, but just as she started to put force behind that motion, he let go. She fell onto her back. After the initial pain subsided, she started scrambling away on her back, until she was pressed against the far wall. The man stepped out of the image. 'That ' s not possible.' He took a step toward her. He walked like a king. 'This can't be happening.' Paralyzed by fear as she was, Cecilia found herself standing, sliding up along the wall. He was only a few steps away. Cecilia gulped. He was directly in front of her, towering over the diminutive teen. She had always thought she would be ready for the day she confronted the supernatural. She thought that she would never be frozen in place by sheer terror, that she would run, that she would fight. But she couldn't move. She couldn't fight back as the icy hands cupped her jaw, sending cold shocks down her neck. She couldn't protest as his face neared hers. Couldn't find the strength to lift her arms when he paused, as if to prolong her torture. And she couldn't think when sandpaper-like skin pressed against her lips. She wanted to scream, to shove him and to run. But she was tired. She was limp. She was asleep. He let her slide to the floor at his feet. He had only tasted her soul, and what a wonderful taste it was. Not entirely pure and innocent as a child's, not corrupted and bland as an adult's. It was an entirely new sensation, a flavor unique only to her. And he wanted more. AN: After eating peanut butter all your life, sometimes you want a little jelly. That sounded wrong. And stupid.[Chapter 4] [REAL CREEPYPASTA CHATROOM. SHARE YOUR CREEPY EXPERIENCES AND SEE IF OTHERS HAVE SEEN THE SAME!] {Joining Chatroom: The Sleepless...

Someone was calling her name downstairs. Her back popped as she stretched, wiping the sleep from her eyes. What time was it? Four, four thirty? It was still dark outside. Her bare feet made light slapping noises against the hardwood floors. The stairs sent icy tendrils through her legs. Something was wrong. She stopped mid-yawn. Someone was calling her name from the attic now. A deep whisper, it sounded like it was coming from inside her mind. Her instincts told her to run back into her room, pull the covers over her head, and go back to sleep. But she couldn't do that. For the past three years of her life, she sought out every creepypasta, every urban legend, watched every scary movie so that she would be prepared for this day. The day she faced a being of the supernatural. She couldn't back down now. Her feet moved on their own, her hand pulled the ladder down of its own accord. Mechanically, she ascended the wooden rungs until her feet were on the next floor. A simple black box rested in the center of the attic. Cecilia picked it up. It felt as light as air. She put it back down. Something wasn't right. She had to get back to the safety of her room. The hallway to her room felt longer than before. A reluctance to return to her bed crept over her. A tugging sensation blossomed in her chest. She wanted to go back to the attic. With every step she took towards her room, she grew more feverish. Sweat dripped off of her nose. Her mind grew foggy. The walls distorted, growing and shrinking incessantly. Every sound was amplified. She could hear Brook breathing in her room; the shuffling of her blanket as the toddler twitched in her sleep sounded like booming thunder. This wasn't right. Why was she walking away from the attic? It was safe there. The walls were the right sizes. It was quiet, it was safe. Quiet. Safe. Quiet. Safe. It took hours to reach the ladder. But still, the sun was not up. It took days to climb. Everything ached when she reached the top floor of her home. All she could do was collapse and pant uselessly on the floor. The icy chill that swept through the room felt good on her skin. Footsteps. Cecilia knew she should panic. Knew she should scream for someone to help her. But she couldn't. Not when she felt so safe. Arms slipped under her knees and back. He picked her up effortlessly. But then, what else could you expect from a god? Her head rested between his neck and shoulder. What happened now? He was taking her somewhere. She tried to move, to escape his grasp, but her body would not respond. And why should she escape? His grip was so gentle. He would protect her. She was safe. She was on her bed. Why wasn't she still in the attic? A cold hand covered her eyes, and she was asleep. AN: So this chapter was originally longer, but I decided to split it into two parts. Double/triple update today maybe.[Chapter 6] Cecilia woke up with a splitting headache and a burning fever. She refused to get out of bed, despite the smell of bacon wafting through the air vents. Before he left for work, her father set a tylenol or something on her nightstand. The teenager was only vaguely aware of this, however, as she kept fading in and out of reality. At some point, Brook and Amelia walked by her door, heading out to whatever it was they were doing today. As the morning went on, she started to hallucinate dirty, gaunt children staring at her. At first, it was only a little boy at the foot of her bed. Then it was him and a little girl, increasing until she was surrounded by six or seven creepy little kids. Heavy footsteps began to travel down the hall. The children were suddenly frightened and hid under her bed, even though there shouldn't have been enough space for two of them let alone seven. Cecilia struggled to keep her eyes open so that she wouldn't be completely defenseless. The footsteps stopped just outside her door. Cecilia tensed herself for whatever was coming next. The door creaked open ever...so...slowly… The sudden sound of glass shattering downstairs made her jump. Unfamiliar voices floated up to her, distinctly male but unintelligible. The door slammed shut suddenly. In a bout of strength, Cecilia heaved herself out of bed and stumbled to the door, grabbing the knob for stability. No matter what direction she turned it or how hard she pulled, the door would not budge. The voices grew closer, accompanied by the sounds of things breaking and being moved around. Their tone changed suddenly; the men screamed and shouted things like \"stay away\" and \"don't come any closer\". Cecilia screamed and covered her ears as what sounded like gunshots reverberated throughout the house. Their shouts of fear became pained screams as god-knows-what happened to them. Cecilia scooted back until she was pressed against the frame of her bed. No matter how tightly she covered her ears, she could still hear the screaming. In an instant, everything was quiet. Cecilia cautiously uncovered her ears and stood, any traces of illness gone. She tiptoed to her door and placed her hand on the knob. It turned, and the door swung open without any protest. Everything was silent, almost as if all of the sound had been sucked into a vacuum. Timidly, she peaked out into the corridor. A long streak of some dark red liquid ran along the hallway, stopping at her door frame. She stepped into the hall and closed the door. A huge black symbol had been burned into the white wood, oozing something that the teen didn't want to think about. She shivered; it was freezing cold. Swallowing thickly, she padded down the hall. Fear welled up in her throat as she descended the stairs, not knowing what she would encounter. Downstairs was where the real chaos was. Doors were torn off their hinges, the couch was broken in two, garbage and glass were scattered all over the floor. The worst part was the blood. Splattered on the walls. Dragged across the floor. Cecilia covered her mouth as she walked forward. A man lay in a pool of blood, some bright green substance mixing with the red. Numbness settled over her. She moved past the corpse, into the living room. There was the second man- well, body really. It was disfigured beyond recognition, pinned to the wall as if he was crucified. His stomach had been torn open, allowing the contents to spill down his legs and onto the floor; the still-warm pile of organs steamed in the icy air. The symbol on her door was everywhere down here, burned into the floor, burned into the man's body, painted on the walls in blood. Cecilia looked down; she was standing in the middle of a giant reproduction of the symbol, drawn in blood and the same neon green liquid from earlier. Someone placed their hands on her shoulders. Cecilia shook, closing her eyes and fighting back the urge to scream and cry. She turned around slowly, finding herself face-to-face with a broad, black-clad chest. Slowly, she looked up until she was staring Bughuul, the Child Eater, directly in the non-eyes. He tilted his head to one side and she mimicked him; he repeated the motion to the other side and she did the same. Her eyelids drooped. She couldn't break out of this trance- she was like a puppet. His puppet. He grabbed her jaw with one hand and tangled the other in her hair. He tilted her head back and forced her mouth open. She closed her eyes. For a moment, he simply observed her. She was beautiful, totally under his control, and vulnerable. He was suddenly very, very hungry. He pressed his mouth against hers, for a moment simply enjoying her burning skin against his. Then, he opened his mouth. Her soul rose from her into him. He could feel himself growing stronger as she grew weaker. She whimpered weakly, grabbing his coat to stay standing. He didn't want to take all of her, no, not just yet. This was a meal he wanted to drag out and savor for as long as he possibly could. He pulled away from her, letting the last drops of her soul slip back into her. He let go of her jaw and wrapped the arm around her waist as she fell back limply. Slowly, tenderly, he lowered her to the floor. The sound of police sirens echoed in the distance. Bughuul turned and walked deliberately out of the room.

R&R.; Angel-Demon hybrid Sinister Chapter 1- A new beginning A car pulled up to a house that was painted light blue on the outside. Getting out was a family of five. There was a young woman, her husband, and three boys. This was the Anderson family. They had just moved from Los Angeles to a waterback town in California. Apparently they could no longer afford the old home. The husband was Drake Anderson. His wife was May. Their three children in the order of oldest to youngest were Josh, Kane, and James. Josh was 17 and in his last year of high school. Kane was 15 and in his second year of high school. Last was James who was 10 years old and was going into 4th grade. Drake said, \"Well everyone. Here we are. This is our new home.\" Josh snorted and said, \"It looks like a dump. I can't believe we moved here.\" James complained, \"Mom. I'm hungry. Can we go and get something to eat please?\" May said, \"Sure honey. After the movers get here we will go get something nice and sweet. Kane. What do you think of our new home?\" Kane looked up from his book on some random artist. He looked at the house. It was fairly large and probably had plenty of rooms. He wondered if there was a backyard. He said, \"It looks nice.\" Josh sneered at Kane and said, \"Of course you would say that you idiot.\" May scowled at Josh and said, \"Josh! Stop being mean to your brother. It's not his fault that we had to move.\" Josh grumbled, \"Of course not.\" Drake coughed and said, \"Okay. Let's go inside and see what it looks like.\" He took out a key and walked to the front door and opened it. Everyone walked single file inside. They all looked around amazed. The house was nice and roomy. The kitchen was nice and was connected to the dinning room. The living room was large enough to fit at least 25 people. They explored the house and discovered that there were three bathrooms, three bedrooms, a basement, a office room, and an attic. Josh said, \"Call dibs on the bedroom with the large closet.\" James said, \"I call dibs on the bedroom with the large windows.\" Drake said to May, \"Well. I guess we will take the last one.\" Kane asked, \"What about me? Where will I sleep?\" Josh said, \"You can go sleep in the attic. It's not like anyone will go up there anyway. You have all the space you need for your stupid art supplies.\" May said, \"Josh! Say sorry to your brother! That was very rude of you to say that.\" Josh said, \"I won't say sorry to the freak. And it's true. All he ever does is lock himself in his room and draw and paint. What a freak.\" With that Josh walked off to his new room, not listening to his mother who shouted to come back and say sorry. May gave up and turned to her middle child and said, \"Don't listen to him sweetheart. You are not a freak. Now why don't you go to the car and get your art supplies and bring them up to your new room.\" Kane walked out of the house and went to the car. He opened the trunk and picked up a box that was labeled \"ART SUPPLIES BELONGING TO KANE ANDERSON\" on the top. He then walked back into the house to where the attic was. He pulled down the ladder and walked up. Once he put his stuff down on the floor, he noticed something strange. In the middle of the attic was a super 8 camera and a box next to it. Kane, being the ever curious cat as his mom called him, walked over and looked into the box, surprised to see film canisters. Each one was labeled with a name and a year. There were \"Sleepy Time\" which was filmed in 1998, \"BBQ\" which was filmed in 1979, \"Pool Party\" which was filmed in 1966, \"Lawn Work\" which was filmed in 1986, one was called \"Family Hanging Out\" which was filmed almost a year ago in 2011, and the last one was called \"House Painting\" that was filmed only seven months ago in 2012. Kane picked up the one called \"Pool Party\" and connected it to the Super 8 camera. Once that was set up, he put the movie on play. Meaningless to say he was shocked. The so innocent movie was not innocent at all. It was a video of the family being murdered. That was when Kane noticed a dark mysterious figure in the movie. The person had turned their head towards the camera. Kane noticed that the person's face didn't even look human. Kane quickly turned the movie off, not knowing that he had just unleashed a very dangerous force. He got out his sketchbook and pencil, all intentions of drawing the figure he saw. He sat down and got to work. Had he actually took the time to look both around and up to the ceiling, then he just might have noticed the figure sitting on the beam, staring down at him in a curious way. 'This one is going to be interesting,' thought the figure. Had this person not have his mask at the time, you would have seen him smirk in a way that would send shivers up anyone's spine. He couldn't wait to see what he could do to mess with this kid before doing what he did best. This child would be his. The figure was snapped out of his thought when he heard the voice of a female calling. \"Kane! It's time to go out and go see your new school. The movers will set up everything, so let's go!\" The figure saw the kid, whose name was Kane, sigh and set down his sketchbook down on the floor. The kid got up and climbed down the ladder and left, slamming the front door behind him. The figure jumped down and landed on both feet, and walked over to where the kid sat drawing. He wanted to see what this child drew. He was surprised when he looked and saw himself, or at least what he looked like with his body turned to the side. Every detail about his mask was there as well as what his hair looked like and his clothing. This kid had talent. He wrote a note on the picture and set down the sketchbook and walked towards the shadows, disappearing and waiting until the kid came back. Hours later Kane was dead tired when he came back home. His mother dragged him everywhere, making sure he had plenty of new clothes to wear to school. She also got him many books on science and doctoring, hinting that she wanted him to become a doctor when he was older. Why couldn't she get the hint that he wanted to be an artist and go to a university for art. This was one of the reason why he really hated his mother. He walked up into the attic and saw his bed there and his other things. He noticed his sketchbook and went over to it. He saw that there was a note on it. Had one of the mover's wrote it? The note said, \" Dear Kane Anderson, This picture you drew is quite good. You have a lot of talent. I hope we can meet soon, face to face. I wish for you to keep this note a secret between the two of us. If you tell one of your family members, who knows what might happen to them. I hope I don't scare you with that comment. I just don't like too many people knowing about who I am. Hope to meet you, A Mysterious Person\" Kane stared at the note, a bit freaked out. Was someone stalking him or something? He put the sketchbook down and changed into his pajamas, hoping to get a good night sleep. He hoped that he would be able to fit in at school. He then fell asleep. The figure stepped out of the shadows and walked towards the bed. He stared down at Kane, taking in his features. The boy had short black hair that fell around his face in uneven, unruly locks. His face still had a bit of baby fat to it, making him look quite cute. His nose was small and he had long eyelashes. His skin was a bit pale. The figure leaned down and gently pressed his face into Kane's neck, inhaling his scent. It was a sweet scent, mixed with vanilla and the smell of the forest and the sea. The figure moved his mask away from his face and pressed a kiss to Kane's neck, right where his pulse was. He could feel the pulse accelerate. He leaned down and whispered into Kane's ear, \"Sweet dreams, Kane. Hope that dream turns into a nightmare. Watch where you go at night. You never know what lurks in the shadows.\" He gave the ear a lick and and sucked on it hard, causing Kane to moan in his sleep, before he pulled away completely. The figure turned and grabbed the sketchbook and wrote another note, before setting it down, pulling on his mask, and disappearing into the shadows. Now the real fun begins.[Chapter 2] Second chapter right here! Chapter 2 The next morning Kane woke up feeling like he ran over 100 miles. He hardly had any strength to get up. He knew it had to do with that nightmare he had last night. He dreamed about this strange figure who seemed to have the face of a demon. He saw this person watching a child running his family over with a lawn mower. It was scary. He had tried to scream but something covered his mouth and something wrapped around his waist, pinning his arms to the side. He realised that the demon looking person was not in front of him, but now behind him and was holding him. Kane had felt his head being pulled to the side to expose his neck. He felt the person lick it before biting down hard, breaking the skin and making it bleed. He had tried to scream, but couldn't. He had begun to cry in pain. It was like that was what this person wanted him to do because he released his neck and leaned in to lick the tears away, leaving a trail of saliva and blood on his cheek. That was when Kane had woke up. Kane sighed and got up, cracking his neck as he did. He then noticed that his sketchbook was open, which was strange because he had closed it before he went to bed. He walked over to it and saw that there was another note. It read, \" Hey there sleepy head, Wakey wakey. I hope you enjoyed that nightmare last night. It was fun. I imagine you are thinking right now, 'how does he know about the nightmare?' Well I can't tell you that until you figure out who I am. Here is a clue. Go back and watch all the videos you found. Then find what is one thing that can be found in each one of them. If you do that, you might be able to figure it out. You might want to check your neck though. You wouldn't want anyone thinking that you were attacked by a rapist now. I can't wait to see you face to face. From, Mysterious Person P.S. Don't tell anyone about this note or anything else, especially the videos. I would hate it if these people tried to take you away. It's been so long since I last had someone to play with.\" Kane was really scared. Whoever this person was, they were obviously dangerous. He ran to the bathroom and looked in the mirror. He gasped at what he saw. Right where the person had bit him in his nightmare was a wound that was bleeding. Kane grabbed a med kit and ran back to his room, not noticing that someone was watching him run around like a mouse being chased by the cat. A child appeared next to the person. The child asked, \"Mr. Bughuul, are you alright?\" The figure, now identified as Bughuul, looked down at the child and said, \"Yes. I was just thinking about how we would be having a new member around. Now how am I going to go through with this?\" The child asked, \"Is this the one who was unresponsive to your manipulation when he first saw you?\" Bughuul said,\"Yes. I have to admit I was surprised. That had never happened before. Then again. It makes this all the more interesting. I can't wait to see what makes this teen crack before I control him. Now Stephanie. Let's return home for now. When he gets back from school, I will have a job for you to do. I will explain later what it is.\" Bughuul picked the child up and held her like he was holding a baby. He walked towards the shadows and disappeared. After School Kane Anderson was dead tired after school. He made no friends at all and was already being bullied by his brother and his new friends. His ribs were killing him because he had been punched and jabbed so many times. His back was also killing him because he had three textbooks in his backpack. What was worse was that his older brother was staying and hanging out with his new friends after school, so he had to walk 15 blocks to get back home. It took about 20 minutes to get home by walking. By the time Kane got back, he was ready to drop down and pass out. He opened the front door using the key his mom made him and took off his socks and shoes. He then proceeded to to kitchen to get something to drink. With Mysterious Figure(aka: Bughuul) Bughuul had heard the front door open and knew that Kane was home. He smirked because his little plan to give poor Kane a good fright was about to start. He had left notes around the house. If Kane found the one in the kitchen, then he probably would try and find the others. That was when little Stephanie would come in. She would walk around the house, which would make Kane follow her. She would lead him to the other notes and when Kane found them all, would lead the poor frightened boy to him. This was going to be very entertaining. 'Now Kane. Let's see how long it will take you to start freaking out,' Bughuul thought. Back to Kane Kane was drinking a glass of ice cold water when he noticed a piece of paper pinned to the refrigerator. He walked over to it and yanked it off. His eyes widened as he read it. It said, \" Hello Kane. I decided that I wanted to meet you sooner that I wanted to. The urge was simply too strong for me. This is a scavenger hunt. Each note is a clue to where and who I am. If you are wondering how to find the other notes, just simply search.\" Kane grabbed his jacket and shoved his shoes on. He wanted to get out of here very badly. Just before he reached the front door, he heard a noise coming from the dining room. He slowly walked back just in time to see something or someone move from the room. His curiosity got the best of him and he began to follow. He was lead to the office room, where whoever was there suddenly was gone. He spotted another piece of paper on the keyboard to the computer. He walked over to it and picked it up. It read, \" Great job on finding the first clue. I am very proud of you. So here it is. I am not what you think I am.\" Kane read the note over again. What did this person mean that they were not what he thought they were? He was dragged out of his thoughts when he heard a noise again from the hallway. He quickly ran out and saw a glimpse of a small person. He ran after that person and soon found himself in his older brother's room. On the bed was another piece of paper. He grabbed it and read it, \" Good job. You are doing great. Next clue, I am where you would least expect me to be.\" Kane wanted to start crying right there and then. Someone was playing a mind game with him and he didn't like it. It was really scaring him. He turned and saw the same small person run past the door. He ran out and began to go after this person once more. This time he found himself in one of the bathrooms. A note was taped to the mirror. He yanked it and read it, \" Getting closer. Next clue, I love to mess with a person's head.\" Kane ripped the note up and threw it into the trash can. He saw in the mirror the person again. He followed this person until he found himself in the basement. He turned on the light and saw a note on top of a box of tools. He picked it up and read, \" You are doing wonderful. Next clue, people avoid this place in the house.\" Kane wanted to scream. These clues made no sense! He began to chew on his bottom lip in a nervous habit. He heard something again in the dining room. He went back upstairs and went to the dining room. He saw another note on the table. He walked over and picked it up. It said, \" So close now. Here is the next clue, I am called something that is not human and is found in hell. Only three more clues. Keep going.\" Kane was shivering now. Why was this happening to him? What did he mean only found in hell? He so desperately wanted to run and hide up in his... Wait a minute. A place that people avoid and where he would least expect the person to be. 'Don't tell me...,' Kane thought. Oh god. This person was in his room in the attic! Kane wanted to go up there and see if it was true, but it would be best to get the other clues first. He saw a shadow move quickly and realized it was the small person. He walked after the person and ended up in his younger brother's bedroom, which had a lot of toys. He spotted the note taped to one of the windows and went over to it to read it. It said, \" Almost done. Just a bit more to go. Next clue, it can get really dusty up here if you don't clean it.\" Kane began to feel butterflies in his stomach. He then figured that the second to last note would be in his parent's bedroom so he went there next. He was right because on his dad's nightstand was a note. It read, \" One more to go. You have done so well. Here is the second to last clue. Think back to your nightmare. Who did you see?\" Kane wanted to smack himself for not realizing it sooner. There was no other explanation. How else did this person know about the nightmare or the wound on his neck if he wasn't the one who caused them. Damn him for not figuring it out. He heard laughter and quickly turned just in time to see a figure of a little girl go past the room. He ran after her and saw that she disappeared into the attic. He then saw that on the ladder, there was the final note. It said, \" Congratulations! You have completed the scavenger hunt. Now all that's left is to climb up the ladder. Oh, but wait. There is still one clue left. The final clue is, if you watched the 'pool party' video, then you would know who I am.\" Kane gulped when he finished reading it. He now knew that the person he saw in the video, the person in his nightmare and the person who was writing these notes were all the same person. He thought about calling the police, but there was no telling what would happen. So Kane plucked up whatever courage he had inside of him and slowly climbed up the ladder. Kane entered the attic and looked around. There was no one there. He noticed that the camera was on and a film was playing. It was a family that was caught in their car which was on fire. He gulped at the scene. Kane walked over to his bed and found his sketchbook. He opened it to the picture he drew the night before. He ran his fingers over the drawing. He smiled gently. Poor Kane was so caught up with the picture, that he didn't notice a certain someone coming up behind him. Bughuul smirked when he saw Kane with his back towards him looking at the picture he drew. He quietly walked up until he was directly behind him. He leaned in until his head was almost leaning on Kane's shoulder. He turned his head so his mask was a hairs breadth away from Kane's ear then whispered, \"Boo.\" Kane jerked away and quickly turned around. He gasped when he saw the same figure that he drew right behind him. He took a few steps back and ended up falling back onto his bed. Bughuul let out a laugh. That was the best reaction he ever had. He walked over to where Kane was and stood there, looking down at him. Kane could only stare at the mask, not that he knew it was one. The person was much more terrifying up close then far away or in the film he saw. He gulped and began to tremble. He now knew that this person was not human, but a demon. He spoke in a scared voice, \"Were you the one writing all those notes to me?\" Bughuul spoke in an amused tone, \"Yes. It was quite fun seeing the way you reacted. You were just so... frightened.\" Kane suddenly grew angry when he heard what the person said to him. He replied in a angry tone, \"Is that why you did it? To see me scared out of my mind? What the hell is wrong with you!? Was it really that entertaining seeing someone freak out because they think someone is stalking them!? Is that a really good feeling...\" Kane didn't get to finish what he was saying because Bughuul had leaned down and place a finger on his lips, silencing him. Bughuul said, \"Yes. It was fun to see you like that. It has been a while since I ever got to scare someone. You cannot expect me not to do something like this. After all,\" he leaned in closer so that he could whisper into Kane's ear, \"I am a demon.\" Bughuul felt Kane flinch when he said that. Kane let out a whimper of fear. He didn't want to die yet. Bughuul pulled back and gently placed his hand on Kane's cheek, cupping it lightly. Bughuul could tell that the teen was frightened of him. He could smell the fear rolling off of him. He gently pulled Kane's head the the side, revealing the bandages he had put on the wound that Bughuul had given him in his nightmare. He smirked at the sight of it. Did the teen really think that covering the wound would make it better? He raised his other hand and placed it on the bandages. He could feel Kane trembling before he gripped the white stripes and ripped them off, causing Kane to let out a yelp of pain because Bughuul's nails had scratched his neck in the process. Kane was about to push the demon away when Bughuul leaned down, slid his mask off just enough so his mouth was uncovered, and bit the wound, causing it to reopen. Kane let out a cry of pain as he felt the demon's teeth tear apart the sensitive skin. Kane suddenly pushed back so he was lying down on the bed. Bughuul grabbed both his wrists and pinned them beside his head and then continued to bite and chew on the wound. Kane began to struggle, trying hard to get the demon off of him. He tried to kick Bughuul, but said person straddled Kane's waist, making sure he had no room to struggle. Bughuul pulled away after a minute or two. Kane's neck was a mess. The wound that was not as big or as bad from the nightmare was now worse than before. Blood poured from the wound like a small river. That was going to leave a big stain on the sheets. Kane himself was not in good shape. He had tears pouring from his eyes and his body was shaking so hard that you would think that an earthquake was happening inside of him. His eyes were closed as if he wanted to block out all the things that just happened. Bughuul thought it was cute. He leaned down once more and gently began to lick the wound clean. He could feel Kane's pulse speed up really fast. Once that was done, he pulled away for good and slid his mask back on completely. He didn't want the teen to see what he truly looked like right now. He slid off Kane and went downstairs to one of the bathrooms, picking up a first-aid kit and bringing it back upstairs. When he got there, Kane had moved so he was curled up in a ball. Bughuul sighed at that. He walked over to the bed and sat down. He felt Kane flinch at the sudden movement. He gently pulled Kane's arms apart and away from his head and pulled him to him. Kane immediately began to struggle to get away, but Bughuul had a strong grip on his arms and was soon sitting in the demon's lap. When he tried to get up, the demon wrapped his legs around Kane's to prevent him from getting up. Kane screamed out, \"Let me go! Get off me!\" Bughuul didn't reply as he opened the first-aid kit and took out some gauze and poured some rubbing alcohol on it. He wrapped his free arm around Kane's upper chest, pinning his arms to the side before he placed the gauze on his neck. Kane let out a scream when he felt the alcohol come in contact with the open began to struggle even more, wanting to get away from everything. Kane screamed out, \"Stop it! It burns! Please stop!\" He was in so much pain. Finally his body became numb from all the pain. He could see black spots appear in his vision. Kane could feel himself losing conscious fast. He welcomed the darkness with open arms. Bughuul felt Kane relax in his grip. He looked down and saw that Kane had passed out most likely due to the pain of the alcohol coming in contact with the bite wound. He simply continued to clean the wound until there was no more blood. He got out a clean gauze and gently placed it onto the wound before getting out a roll of bandages and wrapping it around Kane's neck. He casted a spell on the bed to get rid of the blood on the sheets before gently laying Kane down. He covered the passed out boy with the blanket and stroked his hair for a bit before walking over and into the film.[Chapter 3] For the record, I do not own Bughuul, though I wish I did. I only own the plot of the story, the Anderson family, and some of the kids that follow Bughuul around because I forgot most of their names so I made them up, except for Stephanie and Ashley. Enjoy! Also sorry if it is really long. I have a habit of when an idea enters my head for the next chapter, I just won't stop typing until I run out of ideas. Angel-Demon hybrid Chapter 3 When Kane woke up the next morning, his neck stung like a bitch and his throat was very sore. The last thing he remembered was passing out because of pain. His memory soon came back though at full force. His eyes widened as he remembered meeting the demon who was the cause of everything that was happening to him. He remembered in great detail what the demon's face looked like. Kane ran over to his sketchbook and opened it to a new page and grabbed his pencil to start drawing. It only took him about ten minutes to get every detail down. When he was finished, he put the notebook down and went downstairs to go take a shower and get ready for the day. It was Saturday, so he was going to go to the library and see if he could find any book on mythology that had a demon that looked like the one he had just drew. While Kane was in the shower, Bughuul had decided to appear in his bedroom. He saw the sketchbook open again and went to see what the teen drew this time. He saw that it was him again but this time it was his entire face and his body. Now what was Kane going to do with this? Bughuul was curious but before he could do anything, he heard someone walking up the steps to the attic. Bughuul quickly put down the sketchbook and jumped up, silently landing and sitting on the beam that he sat on when he first saw Kane. He then saw that the person who came up was not Kane, but a younger boy who had dark blond hair that was short and blue eyes that were shades darker than Kane's electric blue. The boy walked right up to the bed and began to look around, poking and probing at everything he saw. That was when this kid spotted the opened sketchbook and looked at it. The boy's face lit up with a smile full of trouble. He clung to the sketchbook and looked around to see if there was anything else worth taking. Bughuul was just about to jump down and take the sketchbook from the child, when he heard more footsteps coming up the ladder and saw that it was Kane, who was done and dressed from his shower. He noticed that when Kane saw the younger boy holding his sketchbook, his expression of calmness turned to one of pure rage. Kane yelled, \"James! Get the hell out of my room you little shit! And give me back my sketchbook!\" James looked startled at his brother's outburst. He quickly reacted and shook his head. He said, \"No. This is my book now. I want it. Besides, it has cool drawings in it.\" Kane growled and said, \"I don't think I will. You are nothing more than a spoiled little brat. Now give me the sketchbook or I will go downstairs and tell mom that it was you who went into her jewelry box and stole the necklace our grandmother gave to her.\" James shook his head and said, \"No! It's mine! I found it and it's mine!\" Kane growled and said, \"Okay. Have it your way. I am going to tell mother.\" Kane ran down the ladder and to the kitchen, where his mother was making breakfast. James followed him and ran behind his mother's leg. Bughuul stuck to the shadows and watched the scene. Kane said, \"Mom! James went up into my room and stole my sketchbook.\" James said from behind Mom's leg, \"No I didn't! It's mine!\" May sighed. She knew how much Kane treasured the sketchbook. It was a gift from his best friend Nathan for his going away present. She knew that James was spoiled and always demanded things and stole things from Kane. She tried her best to make sure none of her kids were spoiled, but her husband decided to spoil James because he was the youngest. She said, \"Now James. You know that I told you not to take things from your brother's room. That sketchbook is very important to him and I want you to give it back.\" James shook his head again, \"No. It's mine now. Big brother can go get a new one.\" Kane said, \"It has some drawings in it that I wanted to look up in at the library today. I want it back.\" May sighed and said, \"James. If you do not give your brother back his sketchbook, you will not be able to have any sweets today.\" James looked so horrified about not having sweets that Bughuul almost broke out laughing. The boy was spoiled. James stuttered out, \"B-b-but you can't do that!\" May said, \"I can and I will if you do not return the sketchbook now.\" James huffed and threw the sketchbook at Kane, who caught it and quickly looked through it, making sure none of the pictures were damaged. When he saw that there were none, he nodded and went back upstairs to finish getting ready. Bughuul followed him and remained in the shadows, watching Kane closely to see what he was doing. Kane stopped fixing his bed and became stiff. He had that feeling someone was watching his, and he knew just who it was. He said, \"I know you're there. I can feel you staring. Why don't you come on out?\" Bughuul was surprised to say the least. No one had ever caught him like that before. He simply smirked behind the mask and walked out of the shadows, standing to Kane's left. He turned and faced him, his eyes cold and calculating. Bughuul said, \"I'm surprised Kane. No one has ever been able to tell if I was watching them before. This makes things even more interesting.\" Kane all but snarled, \"Yea right. Why can't you just leave me alone? What did I ever do to you to deserve this treatment?\" Bughuul didn't reply right away. He instead walked towards Kane, making the teen lose his composure and start backing up in fear. Kane kept backing up until his back hit the wall. He closed his eyes in an effort to not look at Bughuul's face. Bughuul walked until he was right in front of Kane. He could see that Kane had closed his eyes and just shook his head. He slowly removed the mask entirely and let it drop to the floor with a small clack. He then placed his hands on either side of Kane's body and moved his head so his lips were grazing Kane's ear gently. He could feel Kane flinch at the contact. Bughuul said in a low tone, \"I can't leave you alone Kane. You see, you were the one who released me. You were the one who saw me first. You were the kid I saw first. For that reason I can't leave you alone. Not until the cycle is complete and another victim comes. But even then I would not leave you alone. No. You would not be able to escape me even then. If you are wondering what I am talking about, look up Pagan Deities at the library. When you find a book on them, look up all the deities whose names start with B. Then find the ones that are known to be evil and bring death. You are bound to find what you are looking for there. I'll be waiting for you to return and tell me what you found.\" He licked Kane's ear lobe and nipped it, feeling Kane tremble against his hands. Kane gasped when he felt something warm surround his ear and suck at it. He let out a whimper at the feeling, gripping Bughuul's shoulders in an effort to stay up. He felt the demon's mouth release his ear, making him shiver at the sudden change in temperature. He then felt the demon latch onto the skin right below his ear. He let out a moan as the sensitive skin was being abused. Bughuul could feel Kane starting to react to him. He smirked at that. He knew that the kid was sensitive behind his ear. He grabbed Kane's hips and and brought their bodies together. Kane let out a choked moan as he felt his lower body come in contact with the demon's body. Just when he was about to push his body even closer to the demon, said demon pulled away from his ear completely and pulled back so he could look at him face to face. That was when Kane let out a gasp. The demon's face was not the same as it was before. His face looked completely human. His skin was deathly pale, he had sharp features. His eyes were so dark that they were almost black. His half full lips had a very light-blue tint to them. His hair fell down slightly past his shoulders like a curtain of black silk. Kane couldn't think at all. The person before him was hot. He gulped. Bughuul smirked and asked, \"Like what you see? I know you thought that the mask I wear was my real face. Now how do you feel knowing that the person who has been did all those bad things to you is looks like he is 17 years old and hot?\" Kane didn't answer and instead looked away to the side. He could feel a blush rise up on his cheeks. He then felt a hand on his chin and his face was turned back around, so he was staring at the demon right in the eyes. Bughuul chuckled and said, \"I knew you would react this way. You are the first person to ever see what I truly look like. You should feel honored Kane. For a demon like myself to show their true face to a mere human, it means that I have a lot of respect for you. It also means something else, but I will let you figure that out by yourself. Now I must go. I have some of my own little brats to deal with. I'll see you later Kane.\" He gently pressed his lips to Kane's cheek in a small goodbye kiss. He then fully pulled away from the teen and bent down to pick up his mask. With Kane watching him, he slipped the mask back on and turned to walk away. That was when he felt something wrap around his wrists and Kane shout, \"Wait!\" Bughuul asked, \"Yes?\" Kane gulped and began to blush. He asked, \"Could we meet tonight? Please?\" Bughuul let out a low chuckle and turned around to face Kane. He placed his own hand around Kane's wrist and yanked, causing Kane to stumble into him. He quickly wrapped his arms around Kane's back and hugged him. Kane was surprised but submitted to the hug and wrapped his own arms around Bughuul's waist and buried his face into the demon's chest, inhaling his scent of ash, smoke, blood and death. He actually didn't mind the smell of blood and death. He actually found it addicting. Bughuul smiled when he felt Kane respond to the hug. It looks like things were going faster than expected. At this rate he would have a new companion and a person that the children could look up to as a mother. He couldn't wait. He buried his face into Kane's hair and smelled him. He smelled like fresh air and the sea and the forest. The two remain in the position for a few minutes before Bughuul pulled away and held Kane at an arms length. He said, \"Of course I can see you tonight. Lets meet here when your family is asleep. That way we can do whatever you want.\" Kane blushed at the implied suggestion. Great. Now he had a demon that was flirting with him. He simply nodded because he was blushing too hard to speak. He couldn't tell, but he knew the demon was smiling behind his mask. Bughuul nodded and said, \"Great. See you then.\" He then pulled away and walked towards the playing film and walked right into it, disappearing down the hallway. Kane just stood there, dazing into space. He quickly snapped out of it and finished getting ready. When he was done, he went downstairs and pushed the ladder to the attic up so his little brother couldn't get in. He ran out the front door shouting to his mother that he would be back later. At the library 15 minutes later Kane walked into the library and asked the librarian where he could find a book on pagan deities. She led him there and then left. Kane skimmed the shelves until he found a book that was called \" A-Z Pagan Deities and What You Need to Know About Them.\" He took the book off the shelf and went to sit down. He did what the demon told him to do and went to the beginning of the B section of names. He looked up the deities that were either evil or brought death and found a few. He read them and stopped at a name. The picture was very faded, almost as if the person who wrote the book was afraid of this deity. He read about the deity. Apparently the deity's name was Bughuul. He was known to bring death wherever he went. Kane read one of the passages, which said, \" Bughuul is a deity that devours the souls of children. When a child is exposed to him, they would be manipulated by him and become his puppets. He will then have the children kill their own family before he takes them to his realm forever. If the first person who sees him is an adult or a teenager, he would normally wait until a child came along, for it was harder for him to control them for their minds were far more developed than that of a child's. It is believed that pictures and videos are the gateway to his realm. In the past, there was only one case I heard of when a teen who had two younger siblings and two older siblings became the victim of Bughuul's manipulations. The teen himself survived but had been locked up in a mental institution for the rest of his life. When I went to visit him, it was apparent that the demon had destroyed the teen's mental state completely by giving him hellish nightmares in which if the teen himself was injured in the nightmare, he would wake up with the same wound in the same place. The teen told me that the demon would sometimes appear in front of him and torment him, telling him bad things about his family and friends. He would also sometimes show him things that weren't real. It was evident that it didn't take long for Bughuul to destroy the teen's mental state and take control. When he did, he made the teen kill his parents in a violent way. When the teen broke free from the demon's control, he was scared so much that he was sent straight to the mental institution where after two days I met him, he committed suicide because he was scared that the demon would find him. If anyone is reading this I advise you, stay away from any pictures of this demon. Also if you find a Super 8 camera in your attic, do not open it and watch any videos. You will only release the demon and dig yourself an early grave. Keep your children away from this demon as well.\" Kane was surprised at what he read. It was somewhat hard to believe that the demon that he spoke to and saw was really a horrible person who devoured children's souls. Then again, he did see a little girl when he was on that scavenger hunt. He put the book back when he spotted a book on demons and their ways of life. He picked the book up and began to look for demons who interact and mate with humans. When he found the page he was surprised at what he read, \"In all my years I have never expected to be mates with a demon. It came as a surprise for me because I always thought that demons only existed in story books and movies, but I was wrong. When I first met my mate it was a very strange meeting. I had walked in on him feeding and had screamed, which got his attention. His mask was on at the time so I had not seen his true face. I ran and he followed and eventually caught me. I was thinking that he would eat me but instead he let me go and ran away. The next few weeks I kept getting mysterious letters and gifts. I had no idea who it was until I met the demon once more. He was the one sending me the letters and gifts because he wanted to court me. He took off his mask and showed me what he truly looked like. He was hot! He explained that when a demon takes their mask off in front of a human, it was both a sign of respect and a sign that they wanted that human as their mate for life. It took me a bit of time to decide but I said yes. We first got married the human way and then we got married his way. Once we had married both ways, he turned me into a demon so that I could live with him forever. If you are reading this you will probably think that I am lying and that I am making this all up but I'm not. Everything I just told you is true. If you have seen a demon and received mysterious letter and/or gifts, then that demon might be trying to court you. If you have met this demon face to face and he/she has taken off their mask to show you what they really look like, then prepare yourself because that might mean that they will try to officially mate with you.\" Kane blushed heavily. So the reason Bughuul, he figured out that the demon that was hanging out with him was the same deity that the passage spoke about, showed him his real face was because he might want to mate with him? He sighed and put the book back. It was already 3:00 pm and his parents wanted him home by 3:30 pm. That meant he had thirty minutes to get home. Kane left the library and ran home. He couldn't wait to see Bughuul and tell him everything he found out. By the time he got home, it was 3:25. He made it back just in time. He unlocked the door and walked in. He called out, \"Hello. Mom, I'm home!\" He got no answer. Kane walked to the kitchen and saw a note on the counter. He walked over and picked it up. It was a note from his parents. It said, \"Dear Kane, If we are not home when you get back, then we went out with Josh and James to go look around the town. We won't be back until 8-9:00 o'clock tonight. There is mac n' cheese in the freezer you can make for yourself. Do not make a mess of the house. Love, Mom\" Kane frowned when he finished reading. So his family went out without him. He was always getting left out and it annoyed him. Oh well, it gave him time to talk to Bughuul earlier than he thought. He smiled at that thought and tossed the note in the trash as he left the kitchen to go to the attic. He pulled down the ladder and walked up into his room. He noticed the camera was off and that there was no film in it. He walked over to it and saw that the box of films were missing. He began to freak out. If he didn't have the film, he couldn't see Bughuul. That was when he spotted another note on his bed. He ran over to it and read it, \" Dear son, I cannot express myself of how horrified I am that you would watch these kinds of videos. This is wrong. Even James knows better than you. He has told me where the videos were and I took them. I have decided to burn the films later tomorrow. I will also ask you to give your sketchbook to your younger brother when we get back. If he wants it, he can have it. So I expect you to give it to him without complaint. From, Dad\" Kane was furious. His own dad cares more about the happiness of James than his other sons and his wife. Kane ran down to his parent's bedroom and searched it to find the videos. He didn't find them there. He then thought that his father might have put them in James's room. He went there next and found them under a pile of toys. He picked it up and went back into the attic. He went and took out a random film and hooked it up to the camera and hit play. He backed away from the camera and sat on the bed. He said, \"Bughuul? If you're there then I want you to come out to talk. My family won't be back until late tonight. I really need to speak to you. So please... come out...please.\" Kane finally couldn't take it and broke down crying. He was so upset about what his father wrote to him and about moving. He hated his family. He wanted them to disappear for good. Even better if he could just disappear from their lives. He was crying so hard that he didn't notice someone walking up to him. He did however notice when he felt someone pull him into their lap and hold him, rocking slowly and whispering sweet nothings in his ear. He turned and buried his face into their shoulder, clinging to them like they were his life line. Bughuul was furious. While he was resting one of his \"children\", who happened to be Ashley Oswald, said that they couldn't get to the human realm. He tried himself but couldn't either. He figured out that someone removed the film from the camera. The only other way out was through pictures taken by someone, but there were none. It was hours before a film was connected to the camera. He knew because he heard Kane. He heard Kane say, \"Bughuul? If you're there then I want you to come out to talk. My family won't be back until late tonight. I really need to speak to you. So please... come out...please.\" He rushed out and saw Kane on the bed crying his heart out. He ran over and sat down next to him and pulled him into his lap. He wrapped his arms around Kane and rocked him, whispering sweet nothings in his ear. He felt Kane move his head and bury it into his shoulder, clinging to him hard. Bughuul ran his fingers through Kane's short hair. He swore that he would get back at the person who made his beautiful Kane cry. He gently kissed Kane's forehead and pulled away, placing his hand under his chin and pulled it up so Kane was looking at him in the eye. He saw that the teens eyes were red and there were tears pouring down like a waterfall. Bughuul took off his mask and placed it on the bed before leaning in and licking away all the tears before kissing Kane's nose. Before he could fully pull his face away from Kane's, Kane wrapped his arms around his neck, leaned in and smashed their lips together. Now this time Bughuul's eyes widened in surprise. Kane's lips were as soft as they looked. Finally he responded to the kiss and wrapped his arms around Kane's waist, pulling him closer. Bughuul opened his mouth and pressed his tongue against Kane's lips, begging for entrance. Kane opened his mouth and Bughuul thrust his tongue in, making sure to get every corner he could get to before wrapping his tongue around Kane's. Kane moaned loudly into the kiss. It felt good. He faintly noticed that the demon tasted of death and blood but didn't care. He just wanted the pain to stop. For everything to stop. Kane reached up to touch Bughuul's hair and it felt like he was touching silk. He closed his eyes and allowed himself to be dominated by the demon. He faintly thought that perhaps being mated to Bughuul wouldn't be such a bad idea. After a few minutes Bughuul pulled back so Kane could breathe. He licked his lips at the taste of Kane. He looked at Kane who had stopped crying but was gasping for air. Once Kane caught his breath, he looked up at Bughuul. He then said, \"I know who you are. Your name is Bughuul. You are a deity that devours the souls of children who are exposed to you. Once the children are under your control, you have them kill their family and then take them to your realm where you would consume their soul. There is one case though at which your victim escaped. He was a teenager, and teenagers are harder for you to manipulate. The book said you destroyed his mental state completely before you had him kill his family. Once he did that, he broke free and was sent to a mental institution. He ended up committing suicide. I also learned about the meaning of when you took your mask off to show me what you truly looked like. There are two reasons why. The first reason would because you have a lot of respect for me and the second reason would be because you want to mate with me and make me yours.\" Bughuul raised an eyebrow. Did a book really say that a victim of his escaped, not that wasn't true, which it was, but he did not completely destroy the teen's state of mind. He had to say though, Kane did an excellent job at finding the info. He said, \"Good job Kane. I am very proud of you. You have found out everything I asked you to. For that you deserve a treat, but first I must ask. What or who made you cry?\" Kane looked down in shame. He didn't want Bughuul to know that he simply cried over a note that his father left him. Bughuul tsked and forced Kane to look at him. Kane flinched at the glare he was getting from the demon. Bughuul said, \"I will ask once more Kane. Who made you cry?\" Kane gulped before saying in a small voice, \"It was my father. He left me a note saying that he was angry with me because I watched the videos that you own. He also said that I had to give my sketchbook to James because he wanted it. I hate my family. My mom doesn't really care about me, my older brother hates me, my younger brother annoys me and my father doesn't give a damn about me only about James.\" Bughuul nodded. It looks like it was time for him to reveal himself to Kane's family. He then got an idea. He smirked which made Kane look at him with a questioning gaze. Bughuul said, \"Kane. I have a wonderful idea to give your parents a good scare. Are you going to help me?\" Kane saw that crazy look on his face and smiled. He nodded. Bughuul smiled back before grabbing Kane and pulling him back into a kiss, wanting to make sure he left his mark on the boy for the world to see that he belonged to him.[Chapter 4] Chapter 4 Kane sighed. He couldn't believe he agreed to this plan. The plan was for Bughuul to appear completely human with the children from his realm acting as his younger siblings. He would introduce himself to the Anderson Family as Kane's friend, who he met in the neighborhood. After that he had no idea what Bughuul was planning to do. Kane looked at the clock. It read 12:00 o'clock in the afternoon the next day. He got up from his bed and went downstairs to meet with his parents. He had told them previously that he had met a kid around his age and that the teen would be coming over today around noon to hang out. His mother agreed immediately, happy for her son to have a friend. His father though didn't look happy at all. Kane knew it was because he wanted James to be the kid this teen was friends with, not his middle child. The doorbell rung, symbolizing that Bughuul had arrived. Kane walked over to the door and opened it. Bughuul was standing on the other side, looking as hot as he always was. He was wearing a dark blue shirt that had \"I am a monster\" running across it. He wore black cargo pants and and sneakers. His hair was loose and fell around his face. Bughuul smiled and said, \"Hey Kane. Hope I'm not too early.\" Kane smiled and said, \"No. You're on time. Oh. Are these your siblings?\" Behind Bughuul were five children. There were two boys and four girls. One of the boys was clinging to one of the girls like the girl was his lifeline. Bughuul said, \"Yep. These are my siblings from youngest to oldest. Joseph, Sara, Amy, Charles, Ashley and Stephanie. Everyone, say hello to Kane Anderson.\" All the children said in sync, \"Hello Kane.\" Kane smiled and said, \"Hello. It's nice to meet all of you. I hope we can get along.\" Kane seemed to have then just remembered that they were all still outside. He quickly moved to the side and let them in. He shut the door and led them to the living room, where his family was waiting. He got them all seats and then sat down on the floor, leaning against Bughuul's legs. After a few minutes of silence, May asked, \"So how did you meet my son Bughuul?\" Bughuul replied, \"We met randomly on the streets. I accidentally ran into him and made him drop everything. I helped pick his books up and we kind of just clicked together. We began friends shortly after that.\" May nodded. It was nice to know that Kane was able to make a friend that would be there for him. Drake asked, \"Why do you want to hang out with Kane? He will bring you nothing but trouble.\" Bughuul frowned before saying, \"Who are you to judge Kane and weather he will bring me trouble? You may be his father, but to me you are nothing more than a heartless man whom only cares about his youngest son and would be willing to destroy his other son's happiness for the sake of the boy. I am friends with Kane because when I first saw him, I saw a boy who was in desperate need for a friend. I am willing to give him that for as long as he wants. So don't tell me who I should hang out and who not to.\" Everyone was shocked at what Bughuul said. Drake was sputtering. James was staring in shock, May had her mouth open in surprise, and Jose looked disgusted. Who would want to be friends with the freak of the family? Drake finally managed to speak, \"How dare you speak to me like that! I have every reason to be concerned for who is friends with Kane! I will not have someone of bad influence hang around with him while James is there! If you are going to continue to talk like that then you can just leave and never step foot in this house or talk to Kane very again!\" That was when May stood up and shouted, \"How dare you speak about Kane like that! He is nothing more than a kind, gentle person who needs someone to love and care for him! It is bad enough that you hardly pay any attention to him, but to make him lose his only new friend is just horrifying!\" She turned to Kane and Bughuul and asked, \"Kane. Why don't you take your guests up to your room and show them your artwork? I know how much you treasure it.\" Kane nodded dumbly. He never expected his mother to stand up to him like that. He led his guests out of the living room and up to the attic. He said, \"Sorry if it is not much. My other family members took the bedroom so I had to sleep up here.\" Bughuul smirked and said, \"No problem. Though I must admit, I can't believe that your family fell for that trick. Everything is going according to plan.\" Stephanie raised her hand. Bughuul asked, 'Yes Stephanie? What is it?\" Stephanie asked, \"Can we go back to our realm to rest for a bit. We will come back in a little bit.\" Bughuul replied, \"Sure. Go ahead.\" The children left through the film and disappeared through the hallway. Bughuul turned to look at Kane with a smirk, making Kane shiver. Before Kane could even blink, Bughuul was in front of him and pushed him down onto the bed and climbed on top of him. Kane only had enough time to take a breath before Bughuul smashed their lips together in frenzy. Kane moaned and opened his mouth, allowing the demon's tongue to enter his mouth and map it out. He wrapped his arms around the demon's neck to pull him closer. Bughuul responded by placing his hands on Kane's hips, pushing the shirt up slightly so he could gently stroke the skin there. Kane shivered when he felt Bughuul touch his skin. It felt like he was static shocked. He began to claw at the demon's back. As soon as Kane pulled away from the kiss to breathe, he felt Bughuul gently unwrap the bandages around his neck, revealing the bite wound that he gave him before. The wound itself finally scared over thanks to Bughuul's energy. He leaned down and gently grazed the scar with his lips, making Kane shiver at the feeling. The skin was sensitive to the touch. He gasped when he felt Bughuul latch on to the scar and suck, causing him to arch his back into the demon above him. Bughuul smirked in his mind. He knew Kane enjoyed having him mark him like this. He only pulled away when the skin around the scar turned red. Kane was breathless when Bughuul had finished marking him. The demon always knew what made him moan and gasp in pleasure. He raised his arm and placed his hand against Bughuul's cheek. The skin was cold to the touch. Bughuul turned his face to gently kiss the palm of the hand. Kane shivered at the feeling. Bughuul said, \"We should head down so they don't get suspicious. Wouldn't want them thinking that we are doing something illegal.\" Kane nodded and pushed himself up. Bughuul called the kids, telling them that it was time to head downstairs. The kids came running and exited the film. Bughuul quickly checked them (making Kane laugh softly) over before he had them head downstairs. Bughuul turned back to Kane and held his hand out to him. Kane smiled and took it, letting the demon pull him along. When they got downstairs, they headed to the living room and saw something that would have made Bughuul want to kill the family earlier than planned. James was standing next to Stephanie, hugging her around the waist. Stephanie had a look of disgust on her face. Kane's father was smiling smugly at the scene, like he wanted this to happen. When he spotted Kane and Bughuul, his smug smile turned into a sneer. Bughuul asked with barely controlled anger, \"What is going on here?\" Joseph said, \"When we came down and sat down James came over and hugged Stephanie. She asked him to let go but he wouldn't.\" Kane came forward and tried, keyword there, to gently pull James away from the girl. When he finally managed to do so, he picked Stephanie up and carried her over to Bughuul, who took her from his arms. Drake growled, \"Kane. What are you doing?\" Kane said, \"I am just getting James off her. She had the look on her face like she wanted James to get off her. I was simply doing what she wanted.\" His father said, \"You had no right. If she wanted James to let her go she could have said so herself. Why must you always destroy your brother's happiness?\" Kane growled, \"I don't destroy his happiness. He destroys mine! Everything I have he always wants! I read the letter father. I can't believe you would try and make me give up my sketchbook! My best friend Nathan gave that book to me before I left. It is the only thing I have left to remember him by and you are willing to take that away! James is nothing more than a spoiled brat because you always gives him what he wants! He will never be a brother of mine! I hate him and I hate you! I wish you would just disappear!\" Kane ran out of the house, not looking back. His eyes stung with tears. He just wanted to disappear for good. Everyone was shocked when Kane ran out. No one moved for several seconds. Bughuul was the first to recover and glared at Drake Anderson with eyes fill with hate. He knew that James was spoiled but this was just down right cruel. He couldn't believe that he would give his youngest son everything but destroy his Kane's happiness. Bughuul growled out, \"Guys. We are leaving. I cannot stand to look at this man any longer. Lets go.\" All the children got up and walked out the door, not looking back. Drake snapped out of his shock and said, \"Wait. Why don't you stay for a bit longer? It would be good for James to hang out with kids his own age.\" He was stopped when Bughuul glared at him even more. Bughuul said, \"Tell your son to leave the room. I don't want him to hear what I am about to say to you.\" Drake nodded in fear and said, \"James. Go to your room for a bit. I will call you when you can come out.\" James looked up in confusion but did as he was told. Once he left, Bughuul growled out, \"Listen here you worthless human scum. How dare you speak to Kane like that? You are very lucky that you are even still alive. Kana has told me everything that you did to him. Let me tell you that I am not pleased one bit. Kane is my mate-to-be and I won't have him crying because of something you did or said to him. You better start praying that Kane is not out there getting hurt. If he is, your life is mine. I am not someone you want as an enemy Drake. I will make your life a living hell. Now when I bring Kane back, you will not say anything mean to him. If you do... Well... I'm sure Kane wouldn't mind me having a nice snack out of your little James. Tell anyone of this conversation and I will know about it. Good day Mr. Anderson. I hope you have a wonderful rest of the day.\" Bughuul then turned around and walked out the door, not looking back at Mr. Anderson's fear filled face. He sent the kids around the back and into the attic so they could rest. He then went out to find Kane. Contrary to believe, he can go out anytime of the day he wanted to. He followed Kane's scent and found himself in the small forest a few blocks away. He entered and continued to walk for a few minutes. Finally he found Kane, curled up at the base of a tree crying. He heart felt like it was breaking as he heard his beautiful teen cry. He walked over and sat down in front of Kane. Kane looked up at the noise and saw Bughuul sitting in front of him. He threw himself at the demon, crying so hard that it felt like he was being torn apart from the inside. He clung to Bughuul hard, burying his face into his shirt. Bughuul wrapped his arms around Kane's trembling body. He felt his shirt getting soaked from all the tears. He ran his fingers through his hair, whispering things in his ear. After several minutes sitting there, Kane's sobs died down completely and he fell asleep, the emotional release taking its toll on his mental and physical state. Bughuul felt him relax and heard Kane's breathing even out. He smiled down at the teen in his arms. He swore that he would do everything Kane wanted him to do. He wanted to make Kane smile and be happy. He picked Kane up bridal style and walked back to his boyfriend's home, which was kind of his home as well. He rung the doorbell and May answered it. She gasped at the state her son was in. She ushered Bughuul inside and let him take Kane up to his room. He laid the boy down on the bed and tucked him in. He brushed Kane's hair out of his face and leaned down to kiss his lips gently. He then got up and went downstairs. May was standing there watching him. She had a sad look on her face. She brightened up though when she saw Bughuul. She said, \"Thanks for bringing him back.\" Bughuul said, \"No problem. It wasn't that hard to find him. By the way. Your son is very talented in art. I saw all of his drawings. They were amazing.\" The demon noticed that May made a sour face when he mentioned the artwork. Now why could that be? May forced a smile and said, \"Yes. He always loved to draw ever since he was little. Though at times I wish he were more like Josh. He would have a much better chance at getting a job that has to do with sports and stuff than a job that has to do with art.\" With that she left him alone. Bughuul never had the urge to kill someone this badly before. Hmm... Maybe he'll ask Kane if that would be all right. After all, the cycle must continue. He nodded to himself before he turned to walk out the door. He would never abandon Kane. Kane belongs to him as he belongs to Kane. He left and didn't turn back until it was night, where he snuck in using the shadows. He went into the attic and saw Kane still sleeping, the moon's soft beams dancing on his face, making him look like an angel. He smiled gently at the image. He walked over to the bed and bent down to pull something out from underneath it. It was a bag that had his normal clothes and mask in it. He quietly undressed and put on his normal attire back on. Just before he put his mask on, he leaned over Kane and pressed a kiss to the scar, to his closed eyes, his forehead, his cheeks, his nose and then his lips. He saw that Kane scrunched up his face a bit before relaxing. Bughuul could only shake his head at the action. He slid his mask back on and went to the film that was playing. He walked into it and disappeared down the hallway. The Next Morning Kane woke up feeling better than ever. He had a wonderful dream last night that showed a family of seven playing outside in a backyard of a house. There were six kids and two teens. He immediately recognized one of the teens as Bughuul. It took him a bit of time to realize that the other teen was him. The two teens were sitting on the porch swing with Bughuul wrapping his arm around the other Kane. They were smiling and laughing at the kids while they had fun. This made Kane smile because it was like this was a vision of the future and that this was going to happen to him. Kane got up and dressed for the day. It was Sunday, so his other family members were going to the church but he was not. He never really went because he would always fall asleep in the middle of mass. He went downstairs and saw that his parents and brothers were already gone. He smiled at that. This would be a great time to let the other kids run around in the backyard instead of always being cooped up in the film. Who knows? Maybe he and Bughuul could relax and enjoy themselves with worrying about Kane's parents ruining everything. He went upstairs to the camera and turned it on. He whispered the children's names and they came to him. He asked, \"Would you all like to help me play a prank on Bughuul?\" All the kids nodded. It was rare that they had a chance to pull one on the person their considered their \"father.\" Kane sent Joseph and Sara to get all the glitter they could find. Amy, Charles, Ashley and Stephanie were sent to get a bucket of water that was mixed with a lot of glue so it was sticky. He got an alarm clock and string. Soon everyone was ready. Joseph took hold of Kane's hand and walked him into the film. It was a weird sensation. The group went to the room that Bughuul was sleeping in. Kane set the alarm clock to go off at 10:15, which was in 15 minutes. He wrapped the string around the bucket of watery glue and hoisted it up so it was above the demon's head. He then tied the end of the string around the post of the bed and wrapped the end around the demon's waist. Kane then helped the kids set up the bucket of glitter so it was supported by the wall and it was sitting on top of the slightly open door. The kids and Kane then ran out of the film and hid in various parts of the house, which to them was the same place). They knew that Bughuul would be pissed when the prank was over. They all waited quietly, waiting for the alarm to go off. Fifteen minutes later it went off. Next thing they heard was Bughuul's footsteps coming down the ladder cursing, \"What the fuck!? Why the hell am I covered in glitter!? Wait a minute... Kids! Kane! I am going to kill you!\" Everyone snickered. It was rare that Bughuul would get this angry. They quickly quieted when they heard Bughuul come near their hiding spot. Before they had a chance to blink, Bughuul opened the door and found them. They quickly got up and ran around, trying to get away, which they did. Bughuul began to chase after them. He growled in irritation when they got away. He was about to continue in the direction they ran when he heard a crash coming from one of the bathrooms. He went over to investigate. Kane cursed to himself in his head. He just had to knock over the glass that was on the side of the bathtub. He had slipped because the floor was still wet from one of his family members, probably James, taking a bath/shower. He had hit the glass and sent it flying where it shattered on the floor a foot away. That was when he realized he didn't even lock the door. He didn't have time to get up and lock it because the door opened and reveal a soaking wet and covered in glitter Bughuul, who looked really pissed off. Kane gulped. He knew he was in trouble. Bughuul growled, \"Kane... Would you like to explain why I am covered in glitter and watery glue?\" Kane said in a small voice, \"Um... a prank?\" Bughuul growled again and stepped closer to Kane, who shrank back in response. Bughuul closed the distance between them and grabbed Kane's wrists, pinning them above his head. He leaned in so his face was centimeters away from Kane's. He then whispered, \"Did you plan this prank Kane?\" Kane didn't answer and looked away. He realized he shouldn't have done so because he felt something bite into his ear making him hiss in pain. Bughuul then hissed in his ear, \"I will ask again. Did you plan the prank Kane?\" Kane whimpered at the demanding tone and nodded. He felt the demon lick the wound he inflicted on his ear. He shivered at the feeling. Bughuul asked, \"What made you think it would be a good idea to play a prank on me?\" Kane replied, \"It's Sunday. My family went to church without me and probably won't be back until late into the afternoon or early evening. They always like to stay out after mass to do things. I wanted to ask you if the kids would like to play outside in the backyard while we hang out. I only wanted to have some fun.\" Bughuul sighed and said, \"Okay. I'll forgive you this time. But don't expect to go unpunished. Now why don't you get out for now.? I need to take a shower to get all this glitter off me.\" With that he pulled Kane away from the wall and then turned him so he could push him out of the bathroom before he closed and locked the door. Kane went into one of the other bathrooms to see the state of his ear. He didn't seem surprised when he saw the wound bleeding slightly. He should talk to the demon about biting him so hard all the time. He cleaned the wound and placed a band-aid on it. He walked out and went into the kitchen to make breakfast for everyone. Kane didn't want to brag but he was very good at cooking. He taught himself how to since he was six years old. He could make a variety of things. He got out the ingredients needed to make blueberry pancakes. Soon he was flipping the pancakes on the pan and stacking them on seven plates. He quickly made some scrambled eggs and bacon as well. He set the table and set the plates down. He got out drinks, milk for the kids and water for himself and Bughuul. He called, \"Kids! Come on down! Breakfast is ready!\" Soon there were multiple pairs of feet running down the ladder and into the dining room. Everyone took in the scent of the fresh food. They quickly sat down and waited for the remaining two people to sit down. Before long Bughuul entered the room, his hair wet and dripping and his skin was glitter free. He sniffed the air and let out a sigh. He said, \"It smells wonderful in here. I never knew you knew how to cook Kane. I can't wait to see what it tastes like.\" Kane blushed a deep red. Bughuul walked over to him and gently took his hand, leading him to the table and pulling his chair out to let him sit down. When Kane sat, he gently pushed the chair closer to the table before taking the seat next to him. Everyone then dug in. Amy, once she chewed and swallowed said, \"This is really good! You should cook more often mom!\" Kane almost choked on the piece of pancake he was eating. Bughuul smacked his back to help the food go down. When Kane recovered, he asked, \"Mom?\" Amy nodded and said, \"Yea. Bughuul is, or who we consider, our father. He said that we would be having a new companion soon and we put two and two together and discovered that the companion was you. Since you are older than us and Dad has fallen in love with you, then you are our mom. Simple as that.\" With that she went back to eating. All the others kids had nodded to what she said. Kane turned to Bughuul and asked, \"Is that true?\" Bughuul smiled at him and said, \"Yea its true. When I first saw you, I knew that you were an interesting one. You were different from your family. Even when I wrote those notes and gave you that wound on your neck, you never told anyone. You never went to anyone about what was going on. When I saw the way you acted around your family, I could tell that you wanted to get away from everything. I fell in love with your resilient personality and your spirit. I realized that I wanted you to be by my side as my mate forever. I would give you everything to make you happy.\" Kane blushed hard. What Bughuul just said to him was the sweetest thing he had ever heard. He smiled though. So he wasn't the only one who wanted to be together forever. He nodded. He wanted to be with Bughuul no matter what. He was the only person who cared about him and made him smile and laugh. All the kids cheered when they saw Kane nod. They now had a mother! Joseph got off his seat and went over to where Kane was sitting. He held his arms up, saying that he wanted to be picked up. Kane laughed and pick the child up, setting him in his lap. He laughed when Joseph dipped his fingers into the maple syrup and smeared it on his face. He wetted his napkin and gently wiped the boy's mouth off. After breakfast was over and done with the kids went outside to play while Kane and Bughuul cleaned up. Bughuul thought it would be a wonderful time to talk to Kane about his family. He walked up behind the teen and wrapped his arms around his waist, kissing the back of his neck. Kane giggled and leaned back into the embrace. He asked, \"What is it, Bughuul? What is on your mind?\" Bughuul raised an eyebrow at that. He asked, \"So now you're a psychic or something?\" Kane laughed and said, \"No. Just observant.\" Bughuul grumbled before saying, \"I was thinking about your family and what we should do with them. I have a reputation to uphold which includes killing every family that lives here and stealing one of their children. I haven't done that so far because of you. I didn't do anything because I was worried that I might do something you wouldn't like.\" Kane said in a quick, monotone, voice, \"Kill them.\" Bughuul sputtered in shock of the quick answer before asking, \"Are you sure? They are your family? Do you not care for them?\" Kane said, \"No. I hate them. They never paid any attention to me at all. They hated me when I was born and they still do. I want them gone forever.\" Bughuul smirked when Kane finished speaking. He began to nuzzle his mate-to-be's neck before gently nipping at the skin. He licked a path up to the teen's ear before gently sucking on the lobe, making Kane moan softly at the feeling. He soon released it and whispered, \"Then your wish is my command. Though, I might have to manipulate you because that is how I kill my victims. I manipulate one of the kids and make them do the killing. I also make them videotape the whole thing using the Super 8 camera. I hope you wouldn't mind if I do that. I like to keep a documentation of the whole murder.\" Kane smirked before he turned around in his beautiful boyfriend's arms and kissed him on the lips gently. He pulled away and said, \"Sure. I want to make their death painful. I know! Let's make them play hide and seek. For every time I find them, I will slash them with a knife or shoot them. We will have shock collars put around their necks so they won't be able to leave the backyard or the house. You will have the remotes for each one. I know how much you like to be in control.\" Bughuul smirked. Yep. He knew he chose the right person to be his mate. His mate was about as cruel as he was when he wanted to be. He leaned in and pressed their lips together, dominating Kane with ease. Kane wrapped his arms around the demon's neck and pressed them together even closer. Soon they had to pull away for air. Bughuul said, \"Sure. That sounds like a wonderful idea. I can send the kids out to get the collars. When would you want to do this?\" Kane said, \"Tonight. I want them gone and out of my life.\" Bughuul replied, \"Okay love. Tonight it is. I promise you that I will make sure that they feel all the pain they caused you. Now I am going to need you to submit to me. I need to be able to have complete control over your mind. You won't feel a thing. You will enter into a daze and won't have any control of your body.\" Kane nodded. He was going to go through with this and nothing was going to stop him. He closed his eyes and opened his mind to Bughuul. He felt something cool enter his mind and he blacked out. I understand if any of you are confused about this chapter. I really don't know why it came out this way. It kind of scares me that I made Kane become very sadistic towards his own family. Oh well. Next chapter there will be lots of blood, courtesy of Mr. Boogie and his sick, twisted mind. He really needs to be locked up in an insane asylum. Anyway, Review please and let me know what you thought about this chapter. Anyone who hates this story, keep it to yourself or Kane will come after you will a knife. Angel-Demon hybrid[Chapter 5] Chapter 5 The first thing Bughuul did after he took control of Kane's mind was sending the kids to get the collars that Kane wanted. When they left, he began to prepare for the night. He went back upstairs and got dressed in his usual clothing and mask. He grabbed the camera and put an empty roll of super 8 film in it so it was ready to record the murder. He walked into the living room where Kane was sitting down with a blank stare on his face. Bughuul set the camera down and walked over to the teen. He knelt down in front of him and pulled off his mask and kissed the teen on the lips. He nipped at Kane's bottom lip and pulled away, sliding on his mask once more. He then said in a an evil tone, \"When your family comes home, drug the with a light dose of this,\" he put a small vial of cloudy liquid in the teens hand, \"then place them here in the living room. After that, place the collars on them. When they wake up, you know what to do. Kill them all except the little boy.\" Kane nodded dully. His eyes showed no emotion in them and his body posture was very lax. He got up and went into the kitchen to wait for his family to return. While he was waiting, the kids returned with the shock collars and remotes. Bughuul took the collars from them and sent them upstairs to hide. He looked at the clock and saw that it was already 4:30 pm. Time sure flies by when you are planning the death of a family. He then heard the front door unlock, symbolizing that the family returned. Bughuul walked towards the shadows and hide there, watching to see what would happen. With the Anderson Family The Anderson family just returned from a wonderful day in town. They had met many new people and friends. Jose met the kids he was friends with at school and James met this girl that he liked. May had met the women who worked at the church and other people while Drake met with his boss and co-workers. It was indeed a fun time. May opened the door to their house and shouted, \"Kane, we're home!\" She got no answer. She shrugged and walked in, the others following her in. They all took off their shoes and coats and walked towards the kitchen. There they spotted Kane standing next to the window that was there, staring outside. He had a glass of water in his hand. Josh said, \"Hey freak. Didn't you hear mom? We are back. Now get out of my way. I am thirsty.\" He shoved Kane out of the way, making him fall and hit the ground hard. Kane didn't make a sound. Kane pushed himself up and looked at his older brother with a blank stare that would freak anyone out. He waited for everyone, expect dad, to get something to drink and then silently slipped in the drug Mr. Boogie (aka: Bughuul) gave him. He then moved back the window. He said, \"Nice to know you are back. Do me a favor big brother and go disappear for another few hours. Being around you is a danger to my health.\" Josh said, \"Now you listen here you little...-\" May said, \"Josh! Don't you dare finish that sentence. Kane. Apologize to your older brother. That is no way to speak to him.\" Kane said, \"No. I won't. Why should I have to apologize to him for something I said when he never had to do the same? He never said sorry to me once. I highly doubt he ever will.\" Drake growled and said, \"Say sorry to your mother Kane. You shouldn't disrespect her like that. She is the woman who brought you into this world.\" Kane snarled and said, \"Like I care. Ever since I was born one of you cared about what I wanted or what I felt. You tossed me aside like I was a broken toy beyond repair. To make matters worse when James was born, all my happiness was ripped away. You made me give almost all of my toys, my art supplies, and my books to him. You only ever cared about him and Josh. I will never consider you my family. Not now not ever.\" The family was shocked. They never heard Kane speak like that to them before. May was the first person to snap out of her shock. She walked up to Kane and smacked him hard on the cheek, making his head go to the side. She said, \"How dare you say that Kane. We loved you. We gave you everything you wanted. How could you think that we hated you?\" Kane said, \"I can think that because it is true. You always wanted me to become a doctor when I grew up. You never once thought about what I wanted to be. I wanted to be an artist.\" Drake said, \"So? Being a doctor pays better and gives you a brighter future son.\" Kane snapped and shout, \"Don't! Call! Me! That! I am not your son! I was never your son! You are not my father and never will be!\" James then decided to speak up, \"You shouldn't yell at mom and dad Kane. It only makes things worse for you.\" Kane said, \"Shut up you little spoiled brat.\" May said, \"Kane! Say you are sorry to James.\" Kane shook his head again and said, \"No. Its true. Do you know what else is true? I wish you were all dead. Dead at my feet with your blood pouring out onto the ground where it belongs.\" Drake went up to his son and grabbed his arm, yanking him out of the kitchen and to his room in the attic. He threw Kane up and closed the door, not knowing that something bad was about to happen. When he got back to the kitchen, he saw everyone passed out on the floor. He ran over to them to see what was wrong. Before he had a chance to figure it out, something heavy hit the back of his head and he lost consciousness. With Kane Kane sat on the attic floor. He was waiting for Mr. Boogie to come and get him out. He didn't know why, but for some reason he found himself able to trust Mr. Boogie to do everything (Kane is under the mental control of Bughuul, so he is like a completely different person and doesn't know that Mr. Boogie is really a demon or that his real name is Bughuul). So he sat patiently, waiting to be freed. He didn't have to wait long. The attic door was opened and Mr. Boogie came up. Mr. Boogie walked over to him and combed his fingers through his short black hair. Kane leaned back into the touch. He let out a small yelp when Mr. Boogie's fingers gripped his hair and yanked his head back so he was looking at him in the eye. Kane let out a whimper of pain as his neck was forced to bend back. Mr. Boogie said, \"Good boy Kane for following my orders to drug your family. You are doing such a good job. Now I want you to go downstairs and put the camera on. You will videotape every action you do and every injury you inflict. Remember though, don't harm the little boy. If you do, you will be punished.\" Kane nodded as best he could. He was scared of angering Mr. Boogie so he would do as he was told. It seemed like that was the response the person wanted for he let go of the hard grip and gently massaged the pained area. Kane let out a sigh of pleasure. Soon Mr. Boogie removed his fingers from Kane's hair and bent down to pick the teen up bridal style. He then walked down the ladder and to the living room where the rest of the family were, still passed out. He gently set Kane down onto the couch before disappearing into the shadows. Kane got up and walked over to the camera and turned it on to begin recording. Right after he did that, he noticed everyone was waking up. He turned the camera to face them and waited. Finally they came around and looked around. They spotted Kane standing near them with a camera. Josh said, \"Yo freak. What the heck is going on? Did you drug us or something?\" Kane said, \"You shouldn't call me that. You just might get shocked.\" Josh snorted and said, \"Shocked? Yea right. Like that will ever-\" Josh didn't get to finish his sentence because he felt electricity run through his body, driving out a scream of pain. The feeling died down immediately. Kane said, \"I told you so. Mr. Boogie doesn't like it when people disrespect me or call me names. Now we are going to play a game. It is hide and seek. I will close my eyes and count to twenty. You all must go and hide somewhere in the house or backyard. You can't leave the house or backyard or you will get shocked. Also if you try to call or use the phone to get help, you will get shocked. Now every time I find you, you will be cut somewhere on your body. This game will continue until you are dead. Now lets play.\" Kane turned around and covered his eyes. He began to count slowly to twenty. The others jumped up and ran to find a hiding spot. May had hid in her bedroom, Drake hid in the office, Josh hid in the basement and James hid in the backyard. Kane finished counting and turned around. He first grabbed the camera and walked towards the kitchen to get a knife to use and then began to search. He went to his younger brother's bedroom first and saw that he was not there. He then went to his older brother's bedroom with the same result. Finally he went to his parent's bedroom. When he entered, he heard someone let out a whimper of fear. He checked under the bed and didn't find anyone. He then slowly walked over to the walk-in closet his parent's had and opened it. There he found his mother staring wide-eyed at him. He walked forward and raised the knife. May wanted to scream but found herself frozen in fear. Kane grabbed her right arm and held it in a tight grip she never knew he had. He brought the blade down to her arm and pressed it against the skin. He then quickly yanked it down and May let out a scream of pain as blood ran down like a river. The cut was not very deep but deep enough to continue to bleed for a while. He said, \"One down.\" He left to go find the others. He found his older brother and father and gave them cuts on their arms. He knew where James was but didn't go after him. Minutes later After fifteen minutes playing the game, Kane had stabbed Josh through the heart and had made multiple cuts on his body killing him. Blood now covered Kane's hair, clothes, and face. He didn't care though. May was also dead. She too had many cuts on her body. He had slit her throat. He was looking for his father everywhere. He couldn't find him. That was when he heard a yelp of pain coming from the attic. Kane walked up slowly, camera in hand that had recorded everything and holding the knife that was covered in blood. He finally reached the attic. There he saw his father holding his arm where a nail had impeded itself. Drake turned and saw Kane standing in front of the only exit. His eyes widened with fright. His son was covered in blood of his own family members. He said, \"Kane. Listen to me. You don't need to do this. If you stop now, we will get you help. You could continue to live your life.\" Kane stopped and stared at him. He cocked his head to the side in a curious way. He said, \"I have to. Mr. Boogie told me to. He said that if I did this, I wouldn't have to worry about not being loved. Mr. Boogie said that I would be loved by him.\" Drake said, \"That's not true. Kane, he is making you kill your family. He is a murderer. He does not love you. I do. I love you son. I am sorry for the way I treated you. Please. Just drop the knife.\" Kane looked like he was having mixed emotions. He lowered his head to look at the ground. He wanted to believe what his father told him. He so desperately wanted to. Drake was thinking that he got through to his son when he saw something move in the shadows. He gasped in horror at what came out. It was some kind of demon. The demon looked human except for its face. It looked like a skull with blurred areas. He gulped. He then figured that this must be Mr. Boogie. Mr. Boogie walked towards Kane and stood behind him. He wrapped his arms around Kane's chest, pulling him against his chest. Kane knew who it was. He leaned back against the chest, feeling the cold seep into his bones. He felt Mr. Boogie lean his head down so it was next to his ear. Mr. Boogie said, \"Don't listen to him Kane. He is telling you lies. I promised that I would love you and I will. All you need to do is stick the knife in his chest and then your done. It will be over soon.\" Drake watch in horror as his son's face raised up, showing his lightning blue eyes flashing with hatred. Kane nodded to what Mr. Boogie said. Mr. Boogie smirked and unwrapped his arms from around Kane. He walked back a few steps to watch. Kane walked towards his father slowly. Drake backed up until his back hit the wall. He knew that this would be the end of him. He then shot forward to try and knock the knife from his son's hand, but got a nasty shock. Before he had time to recover, he felt a pain in his abdominal area. He looked down and saw the knife buried in his skin. He tried to yank the knife out but Kane pushed it in more, before yanking it out. Blood ran down from the wound like a waterfall. Drake could feel darkness creep up on him. He was very tired from the massive blood loss. He fell to the ground blood pooling around him. He then felt something touch his neck and he gave into the darkness. Kane pulled the knife out of his father's neck. There was a lot of blood surrounding the body. Kane stared down at him, not even caring that he had just killed his father or his family for that matter. He did what Mr. Boogie told him to do. Speaking of which, he felt arms wrap around him from behind. He leaned back into the embrace. He heard Mr. boogie say, \"Good boy Kane. You did everything so wonderfully. Now all that is left is to get you little brother and bring him up here to me. Do this and you won't have to worry about not being loved anymore.\" Kane felt something wet touch his cheek and slid up, licking some of the blood away. Kane figured out it was Mr. Boogie's tongue. He squirmed a bit, wanting to bury his face into the male's neck. Mr. Boogie loosened his grip enough for Kane to turn his body and bury his face into his neck. He smiled behind his mask at the jester. He ran one hand through the teen's hair gently, feeling Kane shiver and relax in his grip. After a few minutes of remaining in the position, Mr. Boogie pulled away and looked at Kane's face. It was covered in blood that was drying, his eyes glazed over showing that he was still in control of the teen's body and mind. He let the teen go and took the camera from him and gently nudged him to the ladder to go get his brother. Kane did as he was told and went down the ladder. He walked out into the backyard. He looked around to see if he could see his younger brother. He at first couldn't see him so he walked around to see if his footsteps would startle James to move. When he walked close to the edge of the forest area of the backyard, he heard a gasp of surprise. Kane snapped his head to the right and saw one of the bushes move slightly and knew he found James. He walked over to the bush and just stood there. He waited until he saw James try to crawl out from the side to get away. It was safe to say that James didn't get far before Kane had grabbed his arm in a tight grip. James was about to scream when he saw his older brother hold up the knife. James shut up and shivered in fright. He heard Kane say, \"Come on little brother, Mr. Boogie wants to see you. He told me to come get you after the game was finished.\" He proceeded to drag James back to the house. When they entered, James saw Josh on the floor in the kitchen, dead. He wanted to start crying but held his tears. He also saw his mother in the hallway, her throat slit open and her eye dead and staring up at the ceiling. He was pulled up the ladder and into the attic. There he saw his father lying down on the ground, a pool of blood surrounding his body. James so badly wanted to cry but didn't in fear that Kane would kill him as well. He was pulled and then pushed to stand next to a super 8 camera, the same camera he had saw in his older brother's room when he had came up to see if he could find something to take. He noticed a film was playing. He looked in horror as he realized the film that was playing was his family being forced to play hide and seek. He saw every cut that Kane made on his family members. He also saw every kill that was made. The last kill was his father. He watched as his father had rushed at Kane but ended up getting shocked because of the collar. Then he saw Drake being stabbed in the abdominal area then in the throat. James asked in a small voice, \"Why? Why did you kill them big brother? Why?\" He heard Kane answer, \"Because Mr. Boogie told me to. He said that if I killed them, I wouldn't have to worry about being alone anymore.\" James turned around to yell at Kane but yelped in surprise when he saw a figure standing right behind his older brother. The person didn't look remotely human. His face was that of a demon. He had black hair that went down slightly past his shoulders and was wearing all black. There was something about this person that was familiar, but he couldn't think of what. He heard the person speak, \"Good job Kane. You brought your brother up just like I told you to. It is safe to say that this game can end now. Why don't we tell him the truth?\" Kane nodded. His eyes cleared up as the cold presence in his mind pulled away. He shook his head slightly to clear his thoughts up. He noticed he was standing in the attic with Bughuul behind him and his little brother James in front of him. Then all the memories of what just happened came rushing back to him. He smiled when he saw that the deed was done. James asked, \"Big brother? What did he mean to tell me the truth? What is going on?\" Kane, now recovered, replied, \"It's quite simple James. This was all planned. Everything from the game of hide and seek to the deaths of our family members to you being brought up here. The person who is standing behind me is Mr. Boogie, or as you may know him, Bughuul. Yes. He is the same person who had came over to hang out with me on Saturday. The children he brought with him were not his siblings, but his 'children.' They were kids that he had previously took after he had them kill their families. He is their father in a way. I am their mother.\" James shook his head and said, \"No. That is not possible! There is no way that is true.\" \"Oh but it is little brother. Would you like proof? I can give you proof.\" Kane turned to face Bughuul and gently gripped the mask. Bughuul then raised his own hands and covered Kane's. They then both slowly slipped the mask off and Bughuul let it fall to the floor. James gasped when he saw the face of the teen that had indeed come over earlier in the week. He began to back up when Bughuul snapped his fingers. James felt hands grab onto him and hold him in place. He looked and saw the kids the teen had brought over. He struggled, trying to break free but the kids' grip tightened even more, making him stop at the pain. He saw Bughuul begin to move towards him at a slow pace, Kane standing back. When Bughuul was in front of the ten year old, he bent down to his level and stared at him in the eye. James quickly looked away, afraid to look at the teen. Bughuul chuckled lightly in amusement. Kane was able to stare at him in the eyes longer than that. He asked, \"Do you know what I am going to do to you James?\" James shook his head, afraid to say anything. Bughuul said, \"I am going to kill you. I am going to kill you very slowly. This way you feel the pain you inflicted on Kane.\" He walked over to Kane and took the knife out of his hands. He kissed him gently on the lips before walking back over to James, who was shivering in pure fear. He took James's arm and pressed the knife to the skin. He gave James an evil smirk before ripping the knife down his arm, making the boy scream out. Blood gushed down from the wound. Bughuul leaned down and latched on to the wound, digging and tearing at the slash mark. James cried out as the skin was torn even more. He had never felt pain like this before. Bughuul pulled away, his mouth covered in blood. He then stabbed the boy's hand, making the boy scream even more, tears rolling down his face. Bughuul pulled the knife free from the hand, blood spurting everywhere. Bughuul turned to Kane and said, \"Come here love. Come play with me.\" Kane walked to them, kneeling next to the demon. Bughuul dipped his fingers in the blood that was pooling and lifted them to Kane's lips. Kane then began to lick the blood off, taking the fingers into his mouth cleaning them off fully before he pulled away. He leaned in and lick some blood off Bughuul's cheek, just like he did to him. Bughuul pulled Kane into a searing kiss, dominating him. The kiss was different from all the others. It was more aggressive and harsh. Their teeth clashed together painfully. Bughuul bit down on Kane's bottom lip making it bleed. He then sucked on the wound, tasting Kane's sweet and addicting blood. Kane didn't do anything to fight back. He just sat there letting Bughuul take control of him. Finally after a few minutes Bughuul pulled back, letting Kane catch his breath. He stroked Kane's cheek lovingly, before he turned back to James. He saw that the poor boy was very frightened and was crying really hard. He smirked at that. He slipped behind Kane and placed the knife in his hand before placing his hand over Kane's. He guided their hands to the place where they would next injure the boy. It was his right leg. Bughuul made Kane's hand press the knife against the kid's thigh before jerking it down, making a long cut that had sliced through some muscles. James let out another scream. It hurt! Bughuul then guided Kane's hand so the tip of the knife was just an inch above the flesh. He then drove their hands down, stabbing the knife through James' leg. Blood spurted everywhere, on Kane, on Bughuul and on the walls. After a few more minutes of cutting poor James up and making him scream, the two then decided to kill him. Bughuul pulled his hand away from Kane's He then wrapped both arms around the teen's waist and rested his chin on his shoulder. He whispered into Kane's ear, \"You can do the honor of killing him. Stab that knife right into his chest or throat. Kill him and take your revenge on him for all the pain he gave you. Do it love.\" Kane nodded. He raised the knife so it was pointed to go through his little brother's chest. He then thrusted the knife down, breaking the skin and plunged the blade into James's heart. He died immediately. Kane yanked the knife free, blood spurting and hitting his face. The deed was done. The Anderson family was no more. Kane let out a laugh. He was finally free! It felt wonderful, better than anything he has felt before. He turned around and pulled Bughuul into a hug. He felt Bughuul respond and tightened his grip around Kane's waist. Kane pulled back and looked at his demon in the eyes. He leaned and pressed their lips together. The demon responded and deepened the kiss. Blood that was on their lips mixed in their mouths making it sweet tasting. Kane pushed his tongue into the demon's mouth, trying to reach every nook and cranny he could get to. Bughuul groaned as he felt Kane's tongue move around in his mouth. He pushed back, making Kane retreat back to his own mouth. Bughuul then forced his tongue into the teen's mouth, mapping it out fully before wrapping his tongue around the other muscle, making Kane shudder. Kane pulled away to catch his breath. He was panting really hard and heavy. He buried his face into Bughuul neck and sighed in contempt. He loved his demon and wanted him to know that. Bughuul smiled at the action. His Kane was such a sweet person. He took the knife from the teen's hand and stuck it in the wood of the floor. He picked Kane up bridal style and walked towards the film. Before he walked into it, he asked the kids to draw his sign on the wall so everyone knew what happened. They did as they were told and drew the sign in blood before walking with him into the film, disappearing for a long while until a new family came and opened the box of films. The next day A reporter on TV during the news said, \"Earlier today the bodies of the Anderson family were found. The entire family was murdered. Each one of them had shock collars around their necks and multiple cuts on their bodies. Police came to the scene after receiving a 911 call that they had not seen any of the members exit the house for hours. The police were shocked when they saw just how much blood had been spilled. The killer has yet to be found. Whoever did this will be brought to justice.\"[Chapter 6] Chapter 6 It has been a month since Kane had killed his family. He expected it to affect him but it didn't. He felt no remorse, sadness or guilt. He sighed softly. Most killers would feel some form of guilt after killing someone, even the children felt guilty for killing their families. Did that mean there was something wrong with him? Kane was snapped out of his thoughts when a pair of arms wrapped around his waist and he was pulled against a firm chest. He smiled and relaxed, knowing who it was. There was only one person who could sneak up on him like that. He felt a pair of lips touch the back of his neck gently. He asked, \"How was it? Did everything go as planned so far?\" He felt the chest vibrate softly. The person said, \"Yea. At this rate we will have a new member added to the family. The child is a boy named Jake and he is 11 years old. He reminds me of you. He is the loner of his family and is often forgotten about by his brothers and sisters.\" Kane turned around in the embrace to look at the person who was holding him. He saw a pale face with dark-almost-black eyes, almost full lips that were tinted light-blue, and slightly sharp features with black hair that fell like silk curtains slightly passed the shoulders. It was easy to see why he fell in love with this person. This person was none other than the deity Bughuul. Kane replied, \"That's good. I can't wait to meet him. I bet he will fit very well with us. I hope that he will come to love this family.\" Bughuul nodded and gently pressed his lips to Kane's. He pulled back when he didn't feel Kane respond. That could only mean that something was bothering his mate. He asked, \"What's wrong love? Did I do something to upset you?\" Kane shook his head and said, \"No you didn't. Its me Bughuul. There is something wrong with me.\" Bughuul asked, \"What do you think is wrong with you?\" Kane said, \"I don't feel guilty love.\" \"What don't you feel guilty about my angel?\" Kane said, \"I don't feel guilty of killing them. I killed my family yet I don't feel anything. I should feel sadness or guilt or even remorse but I don't. Why is that?\" Bughuul sighed. So that is what Kane thought was wrong with him? He shook his head at Kane and let go of him. He walked over to the dining room chairs and sat down in one of them. Kane began to think that he did something wrong and was about to cry. Before he started, he heard Bughuul say, \"Come here Kane.\" Kane walked over to where the deity sat and stood in front of him, looking down at the ground. He let out a yelp when he felt himself being yanked down and onto the deity's lap. Arms were wrapped securely around his waist to make sure he didn't fall. Bughuul turned Kane around so he was sitting sideways on his lap. He rested his head on top of Kane's head and breathed in his scent that still somehow remained the exact same when he first met him. He felt Kane relax in his arms and bury his face into his chest. After a few minutes Bughuul spoke, \"There is nothing wrong with you Kane. There is nothing wrong with not feeling anything when you kill someone. Believe it or not I never once felt guilty that I had a child kill their family. I didn't feel guilty because I knew that I was taking them away and giving them a better life without the feelings of abandonment and neglectance. I was giving them a chance to live with someone who cared about them and would love them. That is why I had them kill their families. For that very reason which is the same reason why I had you kill yours. I couldn't bare to see you suffer the way you did. I wanted to take you away and hide you from the rest of the world.\" Kane was shocked. So it wasn't wrong not to feel anything. He smiled and pressed his lips to Bughuul's. He immediately let the deity take control of everything. He moaned when he felt cold hands touch the bare skin of his waist. Kane wrapped his arms around his mate's neck and clung to him. Soon the kiss became more aggressive. Bughuul bit down on Kane's bottom lip making it bleed the sweet blood that he was addicted to. He sucked on the wound hard, trying to get as much as he could. Kane let out a whimper of pain as he felt the sting of the wound. That whimper of pain soon became a whimper of pleasure as Bughuul ran his hands up and down his spine, sending shivers at the cold touch. He arched his back into the touch, wanting more than he was getting. The deity didn't disappoint him. Bughuul began to rake his nails down his back, making him let out a groan. Before long they pulled apart, gasping for air that was needed. A string of saliva was still connecting them. Bughuul didn't waste any time and latched on to the scar on Kane's neck. Kane let out a moan and tilted his head back, giving the deity more room to mark. He gasped when his sneaky mate bit down on the scar, sending a jolt of pleasure up and down his spine. He began to pant because it was so damn hard to catch your breath when a demon/deity was sucking on your neck like it was dessert. Finally Bughuul pulled back completely. He saw that Kane's face was flushed red and he was panting really hard. He smirked at that, knowing that he was the only one who could make Kane feel this way. He gently nuzzled his mate's cheek before kissing it. He then said, \"Let's go outside. The kids are playing and I don't want to know what happens if I leave them alone for too long. Also no more talk about guilt. If I hear one more word about it you will be punished.\" Kane nodded. Whenever Bughuul said he would punish him, he meant it big time. He shivered at the thought. He was once more yanked out of his thoughts when he felt Bughuul pick him up bridal style and carried him outside in the backyard. There all the children were running around playing. Kane smiled gently. It felt like a lifetime ago he had a dream that showed this very picture and here it was happening right in front of him. He never once regretted opening that box of films. If he hadn't, he would not be here right now with a loving mate and children. All in all, this was his new life, and he was going to enjoy it to the fullest. The end ","Summary":" Hey people. Here is a new story that I came up with. This story has to do with the movie Sinister. "},{"Movie":"Sinister","Title":"Forever Young","Author":"breather89","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11908086","Passage":"[Chapter 1] Forever Young Bughuul smiled at his new child. Little Ashley. She still needed to wash the blood off her hands, but who cared? Soon, another family would arrive. He just knew it. They always did. A house that had an unsolved murder would go for a very cheap price. He looked at his six children. Three girls, three boys. he knew that someone they'd fade. But until then, they were so useful in drawing in other children. Tristin My name is Tristin Field. I was ten when my family died in Oregon on 28th August 1966. My sisters, Vicky (she got crazy if anyone called her Victoria) and Amber, were aged sixteen and thirteen. I'd just graduated from fourth grade. I remember my tenth birthday, in March that year. I'd got a Honda pedal-bike and an archery set. Toby had told me I was lucky, but I ignored him. He's always a bit jealous. Kind of creepy to think he's probably got his own children now, while I spend eternity in swimming trunks. It was early August and we'd just come back from a vacation at grandma and grandpa's in Idaho. Dad parked the car and told us, \"OK, take everything in and maybe we can go in the pool afterward.\" I dumped everything in my room and picked up a new comic. It was Batman and I thought it was great. I went in the attic because I knew Amber sometimes stole my stuff and hid them up there. I don't know why she did it every time; she knew I always looked there first. Anyway, I was pushing yet another box out the way and glimpsed this weird projector thing. I thought it looked cool. I'd never held one, but I knew what it was. It seemed a lot more fun than the archery set. \"Tristin!\" I heard Mom calling, \"Dinner! It's hot dog!\" I groaned and dragged the projector to my room, where I could look at it later. Dad came in as I was dumping it under the bed. \"Tristin, your mom said...\" he glanced at the projector, \"What's that?\" \"N-Nothing.\" I stammered, trying to stand in front of that. Why do I do that? I do such stupid things. He knelt down on the carpet and pulled it out. I got that sinking feeling in your tummy that you get when you think you might be in trouble. His eyes widened when he saw it. I expect he was thinking of something more serious. \"Tristen, where did you get this?\" he asked. I told him, \"It was in the attic.\" He mumbled something and told me, \"Tristin, if you want to handle heavy things, ask me for assistance.\" \"What about Mom?\" I asked. He scoffed. \"She's a woman, what does she know?\" \"Vicky won't like it if you say that.\" I told him. It's true – Vicky was always reading about modern women. They'd started up NOW only a few weeks before and Vicky said she wanted to join. But Dad just ruffled my hair, called me a tease and then walked out. A few nights later, I saw something standing over my bed. It was a huge figure, like those you see in pictures of the Grim Reaper, except he had a face. But no mouth. I would have screamed, but somehow I knew that this would be comforting. I went up to the attic again the next night. Next to the projector had been some drawings. Three drawings, all on sheet large sheet, with strange symbols all over. I squinted in the light of the flashlight as I had a look. Sunday Walk, '48 . A man, woman and a boy, all stick figures, all cut into pieces with a pitchfork, all on sleds. I guessed that they had been pushed down a hill and sliced by pitchforks. Wasn't hard to work out. Underneath, it said 'Brita Johansen'. As I read, I saw a girl come out of the shadows. She looked younger than me, maybe eight years old. She had blond plaits and wore a white-and-red flower pattern. She told me, \"I was the last of my line to be born in Scandinavia.\" She then pointed at the drawing, as if describing an art project, \"this is Mor, Var and Edvard. Edvard screamed too much.\" I was bewildered. (my teacher told me that means 'confused' or 'taken aback') Why was I shown this? And how come she was eight after nearly twenty years? Then a boy came from the shadows. He was older, maybe my age. He pointed at the next picture. This read, What a Gas! '56 . The picture had a man, woman, little girl and older boy, all on chairs. A gas oven was drawn with flames inside. The name underneath said, 'Ernst Omdahl'. He looked at me, with harsh, deep blue eyes. \"My family came over for a better life. Instead, they lost it.\" The third and last picture was of a man, a woman and two older boys, with ropes round their necks, all lying on beds. The title read Jump Rope, '64 . I blinked at the last one, as the dark-haired, small boy came out from the shadows. \"The last one – that seems familiar...\" The boy put his hand up and told me, \"Liron Langer, lived in Delaware. That's because I lived in your old house.\" I faintly remembered that when Dad had worked at the beach tourism industry, we had lived in a house for a cheap price. Dad hadn't much money before then, so we took the best option, a one-floored house overlooking the sea. I'd heard local kids tell me that a family had been killed there. That someone came in and found the parents and two of their three sons strangled to death with a jump rope. The younger one had been only days from his Bar Mitzvah. The third son, just eight years old, had vanished. There were still missing posters up on lampposts, which really unnerved me when I rode my bicycle through town. Then he told me, \"Your turn, Tristin.\" I raised an eyebrow, unsure of what he'd said. Then Liron explained, gesturing with his hands, \"It's like this. Each kid needs to kill their family. Bughuul – that's our friend over there – gives us power. He also chooses the one with the strongest mind. He doesn't like weak-minded children. He also doesn't chose kids under three or kids over fourteen. Too small or too big. Anyway, you chose the method. Just make it soon.\" It was weird hearing a little kid talk like a lawyer. Then he told me, as if reading my thoughts (maybe he could?), \"Take your time. You've seen all the pictures. You can use an 8mm camera. Enjoy yourself.\" I don't know what happened. But something inside me made me twisted and ignorant. Going to school didn't matter. Toby didn't matter. My bike and archery set and my swimming certificates didn't matter. Fifth grade didn't matter, breaking my voice didn't matter, TV didn't matter. I became dark that night. And I never looked back. Well, not until now. It was late August, just before we were to go back to school, that I carried out my plan. I'd got the idea after I'd gone for my swimming lessons in town. I'd come first, again. So I looked at the water and wondered about drowning. It would be simple. I was told night was the best time. Liron gave me green liquid and said that my family had to drink it so they wouldn't move. I had a rather nice afternoon, to be fair. Dad had said, \"OK gang, let's finish off with a nice splash about!\" He was always unbelievably cheerful. I couldn't stand it, personally. Or maybe I've only started thinking that since I became a ghost. We had a good time, really. It was the last day back before school (it was a Sunday) so Vicky and Amber were enjoying themselves. They didn't notice that I put the drink in before I went in the pool. Amber told me, \"I'm going into big school now. So I'm going to be at the Christmas dance.\" I groaned. Amber said she was going to wear her new rayon and Mylar gold dress with glitter. I personally thought it made her look like one of her Barbies. Still, I told myself, I'll get the last laugh. They all fell asleep when they crashed indoors – Mom and Dad in the kitchen, Amber and Vicky in the living room. I just sat around and waited for the sun to go down. I dragged them out to the chairs and taped them down, before using the rope to hook the chairs. I walked round the side of the pool and heard them groaning. I thought I'd probably say goodbye to them. I mean, they were a pain, but they were my family. I looked into Mom's eyes as she stared up helplessly. \"Bye-bye Mom,\" I told her, \"it's been fun. You wanted me to go places. Well, I am.\" I walked back round as she tried to ask what I meant. Then I pulled the rope. Dad went in first. I could hear Mom squealing, rocking on her chair. I heard Amber and Vicky crying. Then I pulled Mom in. Then Vicky and Amber. I saw Bughuul in the swimming pool. He came up and touched me on the shoulder. I was accepted. I turned to the camera, put my finger to my lips and then pushed myself into the pool. And into Bughuul's world. Darren My name is Darren Martinez. I was nine years old when I killed my family on 20th September 1979 in California. I first met Bughuul in August, when I was lying in bed. Mom and Pop and Ronnie (my twin brother) were out shopping. I just wanted to read my comics, I guess. But I wandered to the spare room. We never went in there. I'd hidden some Hersheys in there and I wanted to take them while my parents were out. I found a projector underneath the bed. It seemed weird. Why was there a projector there? I'd seen them in school, obviously, when we were shown movies and things like that (mostly about how man will walk on Mars in 1994 and the climate in Siberia), but I'd never seen one at home. Never touched one. I saw a small box next to it. It had a small film reel inside. Pool Party '66 . I took it out and shoved it in. It took a bit of time; it's not like Connect Four, you have to be careful. What I saw made my spine chill. I snatched it out and shoved it back under the bed. Then I pulled my legs to my chest and held myself, shaking. I didn't move until I'd heard the door opening and Mom calling out. \"Mom!\" I screamed, running down the stairs, nearly knocking Pop over, and burying my face in her dress. \"Darren,\" she stroked my hair, \"what's gotten into you? You look like you've seen a ghost.\" Oh, believe me, I had. But that night, I saw, when tossing and turning and ignoring the weird wrestling movie my parents had on (I think it was wrestling. Mom switched it off when I came in), I saw him. Mr Boogie. I felt calm and warm, then. Just as he looked over me. I smiled, giggling, holding my hands up as if he would pick me up. But then, hand outstretched, he walked backwards, slowly. A boy began to appear from nowhere. He had cracked, grey skin and wore swimming trunks. \"Hello, Darren.\" He was holding the film reel. \"You're in the film.\" My breath felt cold in my throat. I asked, though I have no idea why I asked this question, \"Why didn't you do video?\" He raised an eyebrow. \"Video?\" \"Haven't you read of video players?\" I asked him. He looked very confused, before he cocked his head slightly and told me, \"Darren, Mr Boogie – that's him – thinks you're stronger.\" \"But I'm not.\" It's true. I can barely lift my backpack when it's stuffed with my books, pencil case and lunch. He shook his head. \"Inside. Your mind is stronger. Ronnie is a little weak kid.\" I scowled to myself. Ronnie did always let me down. He was the whiny one, the baby, the stupid dim kid. I had what everyone said was 'potential'. So I grinned. When Mom picked us up from school a few weeks later, the car stereo playing the new hit 'I Will Survive' (oh, the irony), she told us, \"Kids, your dad and I are going to go fishing on Thursday. We'll pick you up after school. He said it's a great time to be out and about.\" I groaned. Mom looked at me in the rear-view mirror. \"Darren. It's nice to be away instead of stuck indoors reading.\" \"I like reading.\" I told her. But she answered, \"Come on, it'll be great.\" I didn't like fishing. When Ronnie wandered off back to the car, Mom asked, \"What do you want to dress for at Halloween?\" I shrugged. \"A ghost?\" Then she told me, \"I think this weekend we'll have a cookout or something. Last hot weekend before it goes dark.\" That night, I knew. I felt cold and excited. Like you do on Christmas morning. Mom and Pop had their after-dinner coffee. Ronnie had apple juice. I took them to the car. They were starting to stir when I put the camera down. I had the torch ready, from the lighter I took from my teacher's desk. I threw it. When they'd stopped squealing and the car stopped shaking, I looked into the camera and placed my finger to my lips. The fire alarm had been taken out and I knew that someone would spot the flames soon. Liron and Tristin told me what happened to those who failed. No way was I going like that. So you say I went out with a bang.[Chapter 2] Lawn Work '86 and Sleepy Time '98 Matilda My name is Matilda Green. I was seven years old when my family unfortunately deceased on 17th March 1986 in California. My older sister was named Keri. She was twelve years old. My Mom and Dad were constantly working in the city, so I spent a lot of time being babysat by my neighbour, before Keri became old enough to look after me. I wasn't like normal girls my age. I didn't want to play with ponies or do my hair or wear pink. I listened to music. Not the garbage that I heard at parties – Keri's mix-tapes with loud rock on them. I wore my hair in two pigtails, one higher than the other, to copy her. Mom told me off. So what? She and dad were bankers in Los Angeles. I didn't care. It was my life. Mom would just say that I shouldn't have that attitude and don't copy Keri, young lady, or you'll be in a lot of trouble. Well she got her face cut apart by a lawnmower, so I don't care. It was just after Valentine's Day. I remember because my school had a big ball (and considering it was a slightly exclusive school for banker kids and artist kids with stupid names and things like that) and I'd been sick after taking blackcurrant punch. I remember Mom snapping at me in the car. \"You need to think about your behaviour, young lady,\" she was piercing her pristine red nails into the wheel so hard, I thought it'd pop, \"we have a reputation to uphold.\" Keri was playing with my kid's camera. New model, came out last year. Ignoring me and secretly gloating to herself that I was in trouble. Typical Keri. As we pulled in, she called out, \"Sidney! Your daughter's done it again!\" almost in a sing-song voice, as if she enjoyed me being in trouble. Then Pop was sitting at the bottom of the stairs, his hands folded and looking ahead, scared. \"Sidney?\" Mom asked, putting the grocery bag down and putting an arm round him, \"What happened?\" He looked up and mumbled, \"It's OK, just...just don't let the girls in the basement.\" \"Sidney?\" but then he stood up and walked upstairs. I was scared. What had happened? Was it like when we found a giant hornet's nest in the kitchen and we had to eat at the Priests' every night? I got so sick of chilli fries. But in my room, I saw someone. He looked a little like Death. I saw three boys and a girl, standing around my bed. They all looked faint, their skin grey and cracked. They all held their fingers to their lips, at the same time. I just giggled loudly and sat up. Then the boy in swimming trunks took my hand and took me to the living room. Over the next nights, I saw two pictures and watched two home movies. Well, I'd say they were home movies, but they were rather scary, with horrible music that sounded like someone screaming. I asked Tristin, the boy in the trunks, \"How long have you been dead?\" He turned his head. \"Twenty years in August.\" Twenty years seems a long time when you're seven. I grabbed my popcorn I'd snatched from the cupboard. They looked at me, annoyed. \"I wish I could have that.\" I heard Darren mumble. \"Sorry,\" I told them, my mouth full, \"I didn't think.\" \"I saw you had a microwave.\" Tristin told me. I was confused. Didn't everybody have a microwave? Then I remembered Miss Wilson telling me that microwaves used to just be in diners and people thought they'd explode. \"Yeah,\" I told him, then, \"it is.\" He shook his head. \"I'm still getting used to these new sayings.\" I started giggling. \"You sound like my dad!\" Then he asked, \"You want to use it?\" I shrugged. \"I don't know.\" It took me a while. I was in the living room and Keri and her friends were having a slumber party. Tess and Marilyn and Candace. They were chatting and eating corn chips and drinking smoothies. I was irritated. The film was stupid, anyway. It was some boring film that came out the year before. Some British spy movie set in San Francisco. I thought I was too young for it. Keri had been squealing again . I put my hands over my ears and walked out, to the kitchen. As I opened the fridge to get some chocolate milk, I heard the sound of the lawnmower. I climbed up on the stool and looked out the window. Pop was mowing the back yard. At eight-forty-five? (I just learnt to tell the time; I got a cat sticker) I heard Mom come out and shout the same thing at him. I rolled my eyes, though Mom said I shouldn't. But it gave me an idea. On 17th March, I came in from school for the last time. It was Tuesday, so I'd had math and history. When I walked upstairs, I saw Liron in my room. \"Hey.\" \"I know you're ready.\" I put my bag down as he carried on, \"Bughuul says you're ready.\" I told him, \"I don't know how to use a lawnmower.\" He smiled, as if he'd been given a whole cake and told to eat it himself. \"Bughuul will show you.\" Later, I went down to watch TV with them. \"Pop,\" I asked, \"can I have pasta tonight?\" \"No, sweetie. It's fish night.\" He replied, not taking his eyes off the television. Oh. I'd wanted to have a good last meal. I got up to put the drug in. It was a weird green that I thought would look better as a paint. But I put it in Keri's soda and Mom and Pop's cider. They don't normally have cider out, but Pop had got a promotion so they celebrated. I just went upstairs as they crashed on the table. I heard the plates clatter. I didn't look back. I took them out to the garden and began to start up the lawnmower. I had to jump a few times to start it up, but Bughuul was patient. I think because he's so ancient that he'd have to. Then I pushed the lawnmower along, holding the camera at the top. Just be natural, I murmured to myself. Then I started with Mom. Just her face first. Then Pop and Keri. Then I turned round, pulling it (it was really heavy) and then back on their tummies. Bughuul told me to push the lawnmower over their hearts. Then I did their legs, because that was the last one. I thought someone would hear, but Bughuul told me they wouldn't care. I think my teacher said it was 'cry wolf'. She told us that story and I felt very sorry for the sheep that the wolf killed. But I read that sometimes the boy died and not the sheep and I felt much better after that. Then I parked the lawnmower and put their bodies in big orange bags that Pop used to put the yard trimmings in. I saw that lots of grass was mixed in. I put the bags by the lawnmower and I went up to the camera. I pulled my gloves off and put my finger by my lips. I then walked forward. I was in my Bughuul's world. I asked Tristin, \"What do we do now?\" He told me, \"We live in the house until another family moves in and we move with them.\" I was happy because it meant that I couldn't leave my bedroom yet. \"How long do we wait?\" I asked him, as we sat on the couch and I kicked my legs. He said something about waiting thirteen years. I was watching when Candace arrived to take Keri out to go shopping. I smiled as she ran in from the garden, screaming. Her eyes were wide and she almost slid as she gripped the phone. \"Orange County Police Department,\" I heard the tinkling voice from the other end. Candace almost shrieked, \"There's been a murder!\" \"OK, calm down, miss, I need you to-\" \"My friend! She and her family are dead!\" \"Just listen to me, what's the address?\" Candace yelled and then she blurted, \"They're in garbage bags! They were killed by a lawnmower!\" \"I'm sorry miss, did you say a lawnmower ?\" I heard the voice on the other end. Tristin and I were almost on the floor with laughter. When the police came, Tristin, Darren and I were sat at the table. They put lots of tape up and took pictures. I heard one of them talking. \"The little girl, her body wasn't in the garbage bag.\" I leaned back in my chair to look at them. Two police officers, standing together. Sometimes I'd seen them in town. They'd waved to us and once one gave Keri his hat. \"Matilda, she wasn't there.\" The other asked, his voice hoarse, \"What do you mean?\" \"We only found three bodies. Matilda isn't here.\" Oh, I was there! Christopher My name is Christopher Miller. I was thirteen years old when my parents and brother Jake died on 12th March 1998 in Missouri. It was about seven months after we'd moved from our home in California. I was very angry about it, but Mom told me, \"Chris, it's the perfect time. We've got great jobs and it's just in time for Jake to start middle school. There's an exceptional high school nearby as well for when you start.\" For Mom, 'exceptional' meant anything. I was in bed one weekend when Jake's screaming woke me up. I struggled to get duvet off and ran downstairs, my heart thudding. Jake was in the kitchen, holding his legs to himself and crying loudly. \"Jake, what is it?\" I asked. I wondered where Mom and Dad were. Then I remembered. They were working. Couldn't they have at least bothered to wake me up instead of dumping Jake on me like that? He was pointing by the oven. There was a box slumped against it and it had a big projector in, the sort they use in school. I went over and, on my knees, I read film reels inside. Pool Party '66. BBQ '79. Lawn Work '86 . I put my head up in exasperation. Jake was scared of home movies ? \"Where were these?\" I asked. He crawled up to me (Mom would have told him get off the dirty floor) and latched onto me. \"They had murder in!\" \"Murder?\" I asked. He squealed so fast I could barely hear him. \"They had some people drowning in their swimming pool and some people burnt in a car and some people killed with a lawnmower!\" I pulled him up and bent down to look in his eyes. \"Jake, I'll do you some scrambled eggs and you go get dressed. I'll put these away.\" As he did, I heard a voice. \"He wasn't supposed to find them.\" I looked around. A boy in a brown shirt. \"When did you come in?\" I asked him. He had grey skin, very cracked. I wondered if he was all right. Then I saw a girl come from the shadows. She had a yellow rain slicker and had grey skin as well. Somehow, her face seemed familiar, though I couldn't place it. She told me, \"Mr Boogie thinks you have a stronger mind.\" She said it so cold and straight-forward, I felt goose-pimples. \"Who?\" I asked, puzzled, as a boy in swimming trunks followed her, as well as a boy in pyjamas. This was getting weird. I began walking upstairs. \"Jake, there's some kids downstairs. Are they friends of yours?\" I called as I stood outside our room. He opened the door and shook his head. I walked back down and saw they'd gone. The projector was still there. I was at the library later, as Jake was getting some books out for his Scout group. I always found Scouts a bit much. I was part of the St Louis 'Science For Kids'. It was mostly things like glowing in the dark and lightbulbs exploding. It was fun. But I went on the computer. Big chunky things that weighed a ton. As it started up, I waited for Jake. He was only a few feet from me, selecting. I personally wanted to bang my head against the screen. Eventually the computer had loaded. Took almost as long for Jake to choose what he wanted. Well, those are computers for you. Big hunks of junk that cost too much and overrated. At least when the Y2K started I'd never have to see them again. I typed in the search engine 'lawnmower murder 1986'. A few results, mostly from movies. But then I widened the search with 'lawnmower murder 1986 girl'. Better, but nothing I wanted. Jake was getting fed up. He wanted to go to and get some candy. Honestly, if it wasn't a library, I'd have shouted at him. Then I tried 'drowning swimming pool 1966'. I found something interesting. An article from a newspaper in Oregon. The Field family were discovered in their swimming pool about twelve hours after the murder, when a neighbor came round to borrow eggs. Alexander and Linda Field, both forty-four, and their daughters Victoria and Amber, aged sixteen and thirteen, were found dead, having been drugged and drowned in their pool. The Field's son, Tristin, aged 10, is currently missing. Symbols were drawn over the walls inside the house. A motive is unknown, but it is believed someone killed the family in order to leave no witnesses when they abducted Tristin . There was a photo underneath. A small boy smiling. The photo was in terrible condition, but it showed the same boy in my house. That was stupid. Tristin would be Dad's age. How could he still be a kid? Was it his son? Then Jake started whining, so I switched the off button and got up, grumbling. I went back when I'd dropped Jake off at home. This time I took lunch so I could eat outside if I had to. I had a hunch, so I tried the boy in the brown shirt. I typed 'family car burning 1979 missing boy'. This one came from Sacramento. It was more recent. When fire services were called to the Martinez house by a neighbor who had seen smoke, they were horrified to find three bodies burnt inside the car. After a week, they concluded that only three bodies were found – Ruben Martinez, 48, Maurine Martinez, 42, and Ronnie Martinez, 9. Their second son, Darren Martinez, also 9, was missing from the scene. Strange drawings were found in the half-burnt out garage, but exactly what is unknown due to fire damage. As Darren was not found at the scene, police decided that he must have been abducted. Searches were conducted and his picture appeared on milk cartons, but no trace of Darren Martinez was found. Now, almost twenty years later, the house has been demolished to make way for a new street. Where Darren had been taken, a park is to be erected. Headstone: Darren Martinez – Born 25 th July 1970 Taken from this place 20 th September 1979 May he one day return It chilled me to the bone. I then tried the last one, as I had time. This one gave me a shock. Matilda Green, 7, vanished from the house a year ago, after her parents and older sister were murdered. There was apparently no sign of a struggle inside the house. The only clothes of Matilda's found to be missing were her dungarees and yellow rain slicker. Why she would be wearing these clothes and not any nightwear was answered by the chief of Orange County Police – because she was abducted and perhaps had to walk or was driven somewhere. But why? That question has been asked by everyone. Why her and not her sister? Why kill her family? Police questioned over 200 people in Orange County alone. Even now, her face can be seen smiling from the Valentine's Day ball, on a poster to be forever in local people's minds. A one-year vigil was held outside her school yesterday evening. Her sister's friend, Candace, 13, who found the bodies, refused to comment. Back in January, police had arrested a 37-year-old man on the California 91 Express Lane, not far from Deer Canyon Park. He had been pulled over for a routine stop but had a yellow rain slicker in his trunk. After 24 hours of questioning, he was released after his family verified it was for his 11-year-old daughter. However, since his address quickly became known to the public, a mob of over a hundred people rallied to his house and attempted to lynch him. It was only broken up by police. His wife and two children were moved to a safehouse . Eck. People actually did that? Not just in the old days in the South? Whatever it was, the movies came to my house. Then I looked again at the house surrounded by crime scene tape. Despite it being in black-and-white, I knew. It was our old house. I was still contemplating this when I was in bed, thinking. Then, from the darkness, I saw her. Matilda was holding her tiny hand out. She pulled me, like a child pulls a parent, her being so small, to the living room. I saw the three movies, heart thudding. Then I asked, \"Why was it just placed out?\" Darren answered, as he sat cross-legged on the floor by Tristin and Liron. \"Because you're the stronger kid.\" He breathed (can they breathe?). \"Plus, you're not going to be a kid for much longer.\" He nodded towards the projector. \"Bughuul doesn't like it when they grow up.\" I considered this. I was the only one in my class whose voice hadn't broke. I'd grown three inches last year. Something seemed to slither inside me; something that made me click. I thought about how to do it. Then I heard Jake whining about a later bedtime. They'd always sleep. That night, I spent my time with Jake. We were snacking on Reese's and watching videos of The Simpsons in our room. I thought I might as well let him enjoy himself. At about ten, I decided to make the drinks. I put the drug in their coffee and Jake's blackcurrant that night. Then I laid Mom and Dad on the bed and Jake on his, taping them down. I placed the dog between Mom and Dad as I went to get the knife. \"Sorry boy,\" I told him, \"But you'll get a good home.\" It didn't take long to draw Mr Boogie's symbols. He told me how to do it. I then went to get the sharpest knife in the house and turned on the camera. I ignored the dog barking and Mom and Dad groaning as I held the knife. I could still hear the dog when I moved to my room. Everything done, I went back to the kitchen. I did a weird dance with the knife, to show off. Then I put my fingers to my lips as I prepared to enter Bughuul's world. A/N: I chose the name Matilda from Roald Dahl's book. When I was writing this chapter, I remembered the director wanted to make a Willy Wonka-like character for Bughuul, so I guess it fitted. Writing 1998 was actually easier than I thought. I'm also a 90s kids, though a lot younger than Christopher had been. I originally set it in October, but in the movie, a poster states it was in March. You have to look closely, it's when Ellison had pointed out pictures of the swimming pool to Deputy So-and-So.[Chapter 3] Family Hanging Out '11 Stephanie My name is Stephanie Stevenson. I was ten years old when my family died in the back garden on 25th September 2011 in Pennsylvania. We'd lived in the house for two years. Our last house was this two-floored one in St Louis, but this one had one floor, so I got annoyed because I like the view. Mom told me there was a tree so I couldn't argue. It was about two weeks before that afternoon. I found a projector in the attic when I was looking for stuff for my Girl Scout art project. My twin Jenny told me to get it when she was out horse-riding. I should have told her to get off her lazy butt and do it herself. But I saw the videos. Pool Party '66, BBQ '79, Lawn Work '86 and Sleepy Time '98 . Why were they up here? Did they belong to Mom or Dad? And surely there should be more? Maybe they were part of a larger collection. Anyway, I decided to put it up. Mom told me how to handle a projector. They used to have them at school before DVDs. I saw some in old episodes of The Simpsons . These reels scared me. I put my hands over my eyes and shivered. I opened my fingers but then shut them again when the lawnmower ran over someone. I then heard something behind me. There were four children there. A boy in swimming trunks, a boy in a brown shirt, a girl in a yellow rain slicker and a boy in pyjamas. The girl told me, \"Bughuul says you're ready.\" \"Who's he?\" I asked, my voice shaking. They all looked simultaneously to the left, where a giant figure emerged from the darkness. A tall person with a horrible white face and huge black, pointy eyes. I was scared but as I looked up at him, I felt warmer, as if I were comforted. \"Stephanie,\" the boy in pyjamas told me, \"you chose how they die.\" I seemed to understand. The people in the film were their families. I was inspired when I was swinging on the tyre. How strong it was. How much I loved the tyre. So I put the drug in Mom and Dad's coffee and Jenny and Brian's colas. They all fell asleep quickly, on the picnic blanket. I started tying the ropes before sunset, I was so eager. I think Bughuul liked me. I was fast. Climbing up the tree, I began attaching the ropes. After sawing, I watched them as I finished the last of the cherry pie, still on the blanket. It was a bit cold, though. Then I swung on Dad's leg. He's always been pretty strong. But then I went up to the camera and put my finger to my lips. When I had gone grey and cracked, I went back to the living room and waited. The kids were all with me. I asked, \"How long does it take to move house?\" Christopher shrugged. \"Took me eleven years.\" Matilda told me, \"There are others, you know.\" I put my head to one side. She went on. \"There was a boy called Liron. He strangled his family in the early sixties. But recently, he began to feel very faint. And then he just vanished.\" \"Where?\" I asked. \"Heaven, Hell, don't know.\" Tristin replied. I asked, \"How old is Mr Boogie? I know I shouldn't ask how old an adult is, but he's not really alive.\" Christopher answered, \"He's from ancient Babylon, so about three and a half thousand years, at the latest.\" \"How many children have there been?\" I asked. Christopher asked, \"Why so many questions?\" I told them, \"I like to know things.\" Christopher's eyes moved up, as if he were thinking. \"Four thousand, Mr Boogie told me. But only thirty-two since 1960. He has lots of families. Don't give me that look, I was upset when I found out, too.\" \"Why were there so many?\" I asked. Tristin put his hands up, gesturing. \"Because families moved so much. Disaster, plague, war. People died quickly then.\" \"The fact that whole towns got ravaged or bombed in World War Two didn't help.\" Darren mumbled. When the new family moved in, I asked, \"Which one do you think is strongest?\" The others were all behind me in the hallway. Matilda pointed. \"The girl. She has a very talented mind. Very strong. The boy's just a weak pile of garbage.\" So I knew who my next sister would be. Ashley It was cold when Ashley heard the car drive up. The house hadn't been on the market long. But she couldn't wait to play around the next boy or girl who would kill. Then she gasped as he came in. Deputy So-and-So. \"Bughuul!\" she shouted, running down the hallway. The kids came out of the various rooms, seeing her frightened. Bughuul materialized in front of them. \"Deputy So-and-So is here! The guy who was at the old house. He's carrying petrol!\" \"What does that mean?\" Matilda asked, holding Stephanie's hand tight. Tristin and Darren looked extremely nervous and Christopher was fuming. \"I'll get him.\" He started, about to run down the hallway and into the living room. \"Wait!\" Bughuul called and the boy slunked back. All eyes were on Bughuul. He put his arms out, holding Matilda and Tristin by their shoulders. Matilda still held Stephanie's hand and the boys held each other's. Christopher protectively held Ashley close as Ashley put an arm around Stephanie. She liked Christopher. He was like Trevor if Trevor actually cared. As the flames curled around the living room door, Bughuul did his work. They were hurling, whirling, as if a huge wind were enclosing around them. Their hair blew round and they tried not to screw their eyes tight in the pain. It was as if they were being yanked through the spout of a tornado. Eventually, they finished and were in a large garden with a wooden fence. They dared to look around themselves, to take in their new surroundings. It was quite sandy and they could see small green plants growing by the roadsides. They guessed they were somewhere in the southwest. Then some children seemed to come out from the large grey stone steps leading up to the house. Two girls, three boys. All staring with discontent and exhaustion. Bughuul began. \"This is another link from Norway. This is Texas. The house is large enough so enjoy yourself.\" He gabbled, almost embarrassed. As he disappeared, Christopher walked up to them, defensively. \"I'm doing my best not to be jealous since I got over that a long time ago.\" He blurted out. One of the boys, in a white polo shirt, answered, \"Not exactly. Bughuul told us about you.\" Christopher asked, as his brothers and sisters came up, \"Who last lived in the house?\" A boy in a cowboy hat, thick gloves and red pants raised his hand. Christopher remembered the wooden fence and muttered, \"I'm not going to ask.\" The boy carried on. \"Connor Strudwick. No-one's lived here for almost a decade. Come in. It's always nice to see new people. Well, those who aren't dead, really.\" As they all walked in, Ashley asked Stephanie, \"You don't think Deputy So-and-So will come here, do you?\" But all Stephanie could say was, \"Not unless he connects it.\" In the box in the living room, Ashley saw their reels had been slotted in with some others. 4 th July 1973. Bowling 1984. Harvest 1992. Ice Skating 1998. Bull Fighting 2003. She couldn't wait.[Chapter 4] New Home The Platts drove up at half four on 1st August 2013. Mitchell and Shelly and their fourteen-year-old son Geoff were only staying for a week. Though Geoff didn't know why. He didn't like all this moving constantly. He blew a bubble on his chewing gum before looking round the place. What a dump. He was interested in the story behind it, though. About ten years ago some freak had killed the family here. Their ten-year-old son was missing. Geoff didn't know what happened to him. Didn't care either. Kid was either in someone's backyard or dumped by the road a few miles on. He grumbled as he went upstairs. No bother unpacking. It wasn't even as if they'd brought anything. He was lying on his back on his bed when he glimpsed something. Amongst the many boxes, there lay a projector and some reels. He glanced inside and noticed some reels. Why did his parents have so many reels? Could be from Dad's 'family' that he never let Geoff go near? After he set them up, his eyes widened with horror and amazement. Whoever did this had brilliant special effects skills. He'd have preferred sound, but never mind. Who did these? Sure, he was a little scared at first, but this was top notch. He'd chosen to watch them in order. So after Pool Party , he put on 4 th July . As he slotted it in, he lay back and took it in. Two girls, both around ten to twelve years old, with an older girl, walking along the road by a beach. A man and woman came some way behind them. He knew the hippie hair and the flower jeans – his dad wore some ages ago that looked hideous. Then they were at some allotment or other overlooking the beach. The woman setting up a picnic table. The kids came over from the wall and sat down. The camera now showed them drinking green juice. Then, night. The man, woman and two girls were tied to poles. Their hands bound behind and their mouths taped. Then someone lit a match and held it underneath the poles. There were fireworks strapped to the poles. Geoff looked in glee as the first one lit up like a Christmas tree, then exploded. He saw the woman and girls struggling. Oh, they were really good actors. The woman next. Then the girls. He clapped to no-one in particular as it ended. \"Very good,\" he murmured, \"very good.\" He shifted the reels around as he chose the next one. BBQ . Smiling to himself, when he finished, he picked up the next. Bowling . It showed a bowling alley. A man was bowling balls, a teenage girl with huge hair and low-hanging top and a boy around Geoff's age were sitting at a table nearby, eating. A woman brought in some green juice and they drank while another boy sat on a nearby bench. Then the family were tied up on different bowling lanes. Someone threw balls, hitting them. The fidgeting bodies tried to break loose, but the balls just kept on whacking. When he finished, he mused over the fact that someone must have got these ideas from somewhere. Going online, he typed up about the 4th July. He found some weird thing from Delaware. It said a family named Waterman were murdered in Delaware. Their eight-year-old daughter Fay was missing. Then he saw a photograph of a bowling alley. It was in Maryland. On 16th February 1984, a quadruple homicide had been committed there. The employees had come the next day to find the manager, Mr Butte, his wife and two of his three children battered to death. His younger son, Jackson, only eleven years old, was missing. A sweet portrait of Jackson in a white polo shirt smiled out at him from the screen. Absolutely fantastic, Geoff bemused, as he looked about the alley. Just like the movie. As he laughed, the children looked out from the shadows, crossly. How dare this boy mock their work! Worse yet, he wasn't a child, so they'd have to wait until he had kids! Geoff watched movies late into the night. Harvest started off outside a wheat field, which could be anywhere in the Midwest, with an older girl in red-and-white cotton and a straw hat running along the wooden fence. A man and woman were holding hands as they walked round by a large house. A seven-year-old boy in blue dungarees and a straw hat was holding a cup of green liquid. Typical, Geoff scoffed, couldn't they use a different prop? Then, night-time. The older girl, man and woman were on scarecrow poles, barely visible in the dim light. Then they moved closer. No, wait. It was a machine. Moving toward them. The combine harvester made quick work. He jumped up, heart pounding. That was scary! Kenny laughed from the darkness. Ashley looked sideways at him. \"I always liked riding it,\" he chortled in his Kansas accent, \"and I wanted to go back.\" The youngest child in the large group, little Isabella Patrick, pushed him playfully and he glared at her. \"Kenny Downer,\" she spoke almost like a grown-up, \"Bughuul says that it was knocked down.\" Christopher laughed slightly, then put a hand by his mouth as they all peered at him. \"Sorry,\" he carried on, \"but Mom told me something about it. We were driving through to visit my grandparents when she pointed it out. It had a weird plague in front. I remember because it was 15th August, exactly five years before.\" They stared back at Geoff as he finished Sleepy Time . He then placed Ice Skating in the slot. A girl with dark hair and purple mittens skidded on purple skates towards a man, who took her hand, on an ice rink somewhere Geoff recognised. Then he nodded. This was from Washington. He'd been in a summer camp in the Washington wilderness a few years back. Before everything went wrong and they kept moving. Isabella whispered to Ashley, tugging on her clothes, \"This next bit's good.\" Ashley asked what she'd wanted to say since she first saw the reel. \"Is it Christmas?\" \"Thirty days before Christmas. Daisy and I wanted to get bikes.\" Then, just as with the others, it was night-time. Thin ovals of ice had been cut out of the bottom, where the lake lay underneath. They'd been dragged from the rink, down from a small hill, then lain on the ground. The woman was pushed first, still struggling under the water. Then the man. Then an older girl. Isabella grinned her not quite full set of teeth as she remembered. She clapped her mitten-clad hands together as it ended. Then Connor's film went in. The usual, family messing about. Connor's dad stroking the heads of some bulls. His brothers riding some horses, messing about. Night. Connor's father and brothers were on the fences, tied loosely to them, but hands and ankles still taped. Then the bulls, who had been pacing the pen, seemed to notice them. Within seconds, all of them were pulled up by the animals' horns and gored, thrown about like dolls. Geoff squinted as he put his head on one side. Strange. That was their new garden. The director must have lived here. Oh well, whoever he was, Geoff wanted to congratulate him. That night, as Ashley was looking over the landscape, wondering what pictures she could do that could be inspired by this, she saw a car drive up. She saw them get out; two men and a woman, all carrying cans of petrol. Not again. Please, not again. This one didn't even look like it was Deputy So-and-So. \"Bughuul!\" she screamed, running inside. Eventually, the wind encompassed them again, as they all held onto each other, frightened and desperate. Then Bughuul held them apart, pushing them and pushing. His children all looked at him with fear and puzzlement. Why was he doing this? But then, Ashley opened her eyes. It was somewhere different this time. Not far from a beach. She looked at the house and saw it was a one-floored one, painted white, with a wire fence. She was somewhere in New England. Fay, Connor, Tristin and Stephanie were with her. Bughuul stood up straight and tall, and began before the children could begin complaining. \"Too many of you in one house leaves more room for problems. Don't worry, you'll be safe here. As long as you behave.\" Then he disappeared. Tristin moaned, \"What now?\" Five children were standing in the doorway on the porch, staring straight ahead at them. A girl with straight, blonde hair, wearing a yellow party frock and a pink party hat. A boy with red hair and a scuba-diving outfit. A tall boy with light brown hair, his clothes caked in mud. A girl with a dark ponytail, wearing a coral pink riding outfit. A girl with frizzy strawberry-blonde hair, dressed as a vampire. Ashley couldn't wait to see another movie. Texas Deputy So-and-So stood outside the house, feeling a mixture of relief and annoyance. He'd taken ages to research this chain, burning down the Oswalt and Stevenson houses. After burning down the Green house, he'd learnt a family had lived there in the mid-nineties before moving down to a Texas ranch after a nasty divorce. He'd found out that the mother had died of pneumonia in a trailer in a park someplace in Los Angeles (thankfully, homeless), but the father and his three sons had suffered worse. Being gored by a bull...he couldn't think how to approach the house. There might be somebody living there. When he learnt a family had been killed there by the house burning in August 2013, he'd thrown down his newspaper he'd picked up while eating waffles in a roadside diner, then rushed over fearing the worst. Then he saw it was actually committed by a third party. He'd asked questions and wondered who on earth would do that. There was some weird rumor about the dad being in the mafia, but personally he didn't care. The structure had collapsed and it was one less job for him.[Chapter 5] Grim Halloween Gardening Ashley had decided to watch the movies by herself. Take a bit of time to work out a possibility for a new child. She glimpsed over the movies, before deciding on Gardening, Wisconsin, 07-17-78 . She sat back against the sofa, Stephanie and Fay resting next to her. Two children were in a garden. One was a girl maybe a little older than Trevor. The other was a boy the same age. Then two adults came out and the man began digging in the soil, as the girl walked to a white table with a sunshade. The girl and woman began drinking as the man stopped and he and the boy began to sit down. Then it cut to the man, woman and the girl, all lying on the ground, by the flower beds. All had their hands tied and mouths gagged. Then a pair of gardening shears came from the bottom of the screen. One at a time, it carefully cut the throats of each victim. Ashley looked over her shoulder and saw him. \"Oh, hey Julian,\" she said, \"I was admiring your handiwork.\" He nodded as the film reel ended and sat down beside her, as Stephanie began to select another one. Wisconsin Deputy So-and-So looked over the facts, as he leant against his car outside the house. In 1978, the Groves family had been murdered, everyone said. Mother, father, twelve-year-old daughter Cloe. Her twin was missing. Made sense. So far he'd counted roughly thirty children in the United States alone. He couldn't believe he'd come so far in just eighteen months. Resigning as Deputy, he'd spent hours online looking up murders with a missing child that fitted the pattern. He'd call up and ask about symbols and if anyone had lived there since. Then he'd taken out all his savings and took his car across country. It would be night soon. Then he would get to work. Birthday Party Stephanie inserted the next reel as Misty sat cross-legged on the floor, watching her masterpiece. The reel (named Birthday Party, South Dakota, 07-24-69 ) began as it showed the birthday party of an older boy. His friends all giving presents and children playing on the bouncy castle. Night-time – the boy, his parents and a teenage girl were tied up on the bouncy castle, which had been dragged indoors. The camera panned over their faces as they lay still. Then a birthday candle, snatched from the cake, still with crumbs and icing stuck to the bottom, was lit and placed near the edge of the bouncy castle. The air inside all lit up in flames and Ashley could just make out the struggling figures inside. South Dakota Deputy So-and-So asked the realtor, \"So how long has the house been empty?\" The realtor, a bored-looking man who should really have given up smoking years ago and whose face looked like a sad, droopy dog's, recited the same thing that the deputy guessed he must have been asked several times. \"The Mallory house has been empty almost fifty years. There – was an incident on the son's thirteenth birthday. He, his big sister, his parents, all burnt alive inside. It was grisly. The scene was so revolting that one of the officers had to take six months' leave.\" The deputy braced himself. \"Did – they all die?\" The realtor glanced up from the report, a little taken aback. \"Well, nobody knows what happened to the youngest daughter. She was only ten when she was snatched. They say snatched because the deaths were an obvious homicide and she was gone. God knows who took her.\" \"Were there any – signature marks left by a killer?\" The realtor demanded, though not crossly, \"You interested in that stuff?\" Deputy So-and-So tried to feign surprise, shrugging his shoulders and his eyes looking round the room, as if this were a bit embarrassing. \"Well, I like writing.\" \"Writing?\" a hint of disbelief. \"Yeah.\" Whoops, too blunt. \"You don't look like a writer.\" The realtor almost snapped. \"I'm looking up cults and – well – this sounds like a cult murder. I mean, bunch of people murdered inside their home.\" The realtor leaned back in his chair and looked back at the screen, where Deputy So-and-So could just about make out a grainy black-and-white photo of a smiling girl. \"I guess some people suggested that. Symbols were found in the house and after the Manson attacks in California people began putting two and two together. But what puzzles me is what they'd want with the girl.\" Horse-Riding Lyn squealed as Tristin put in the next reel, Horse-Riding, Texas, 06-04-82 . \"This is mine! Budge up, budge up!\" Ashley groaned as the over-excited eight-year-old slammed down between her and Fay. The film began. It showed Lyn riding on a horse, laughing and grabbing at the reins. With a boy next to her and her parents walking around their stables, each feeding horses at the gates. Their names were underneath. Snowball. Nightshade . Then, night-time. In the dim light, the camera panned over the first stable, Snowball's. Inside, on a pile of hay, was Lyn's mother. In Nightshade's, her father. Then Lyn's brother in the third pen. A match was lit and the stables burnt, the cool night air fuelling the flames. The horses were running from the flames, throughout the exercise yard. The film ended. Texas Deputy So-and-So crossed another address off his list as he sat in the car opposite the old Dean house. OK, next house on his list was in California. The Newman house, overlooking the beach. If he started now, he'd been there on time. Surfing and Halloween Colin slotted his reel in. \"Which one is yours?\" Ashley asked. He didn't look from the projector as he began to set it up. \" Surfing, California, 06-06-72 .\" They sat back on the sofa as it started. Colin on a beach, his red hair sticking up as he patted a sandcastle. A girl about ten and a girl about sixteen sat on towels, as their mother held the surfboards up. Colin ran over, excited. Then it showed Colin's mother and his sisters, all tied to surfboards, in the low sunset light. They stirred as Colin pushed one out to the deep with his feet. \"I waved as they left,\" he told them, \"part of me wanted them found, so I tied their ankles to railings at the edge of the beach. They were found.\" Then Wendy stood up, her movie the last in the box. Halloween, Connecticut, 10-31-87 . The film had Wendy's brother and sister at the table, the camera outside the window. Then Wendy's mother served cookies as Wendy ran up to the table, laughing and grabbing one. The next shot had Wendy's mother and her siblings on the table, the tray with the cookies now scattered on the floor. The knife lingered over her mother's throat, then cut it, the blood spilling onto the floor. Her siblings followed. As the reel finished, Stephanie stood up and sniffed. \"Steph, what is it?\" Tristin asked, worried. Then they all smelt. Smoke. Connecticut It had been two years since the Oswalt family had been murdered. Deputy So-and-So was now at the Bishop house in Connecticut. Facts checked out; divorced mom and her kids, victims found on the table with their throats slit, eleven-year-old daughter missing. But even as he burnt the house, a gust of wind blew past his ears. He turned to the left for a second and saw her. He saw Ashley standing there, in her pyjamas, the blood still soaked over them. Angry, determined. \"One day,\" she hissed, sounding as if snakes were throttling his neck, \"we will get you.\" She disappeared in the shadows almost as quickly as she came.[Chapter 6] Ashley sat down as she looked round the new house. It was large, just like her old one. The living room was roughly the same, plenty of room for the children as they crashed on mattresses and chatted. They didn't need the mattresses because they didn't sleep, but it still added to the relaxation. Six new kids were leafing through the reels. Jonathon Fletcher was twelve, from Wyoming. He wore a pair of pyjamas and a brown wool jacket. Della Westley was seven, from North Carolina. She had on some jeans and a purple t-shirt with a slogan from some seventies programme. Like Matilda used to, she wore her hair in lop-sided pigtails. Elizabeth Archer was twelve, from Mississippi. Like Christopher, she was tall and slim. She also wore a green swimming costume with doodles all over that had obviously been done ages ago with marker pens. Ashley liked that. It seemed carefree, like her paintings. Robert Roscoe was eight, from Maine. He wore a baseball cap with pyjamas. An odd mix, Ashley thought. Sam Stevens was ten, from Vermont. He looked rather ridiculous, in black leggings and a white leotard, but he said that he'd killed them in a dance hall. He had said more times than Ashley dared to count that he really wished he'd gone for the clay pigeons instead. Sandy Acker was also ten, from Florida. Ashley could tell even without the shirt with a crocodile on the front. The girl had a suntan and a Southern accent. Then, they all stopped what they were doing and listened. Bughuul emerged at the doorway. The fifteen children all stood in the centre of the room, waiting. Bughuul began. \"My task is complete. It took some time, but we have managed.\" He then announced, \"The Deputy is dead.\" Ashley still felt a little remorse. She still had known him. Then Bughuul told them, \"You can stay here at present. There are only three houses that he had not managed to destroy. Here, one in Georgia and one in Illinois. He has been busy. But don't worry, he is gone.\" The children all went back to what they had been doing, as Ashley walked up to Bughuul. \"Bughuul?\" she asked. He looked down. \"Where – where exactly did he go?\" \"He's dead. I don't care.\" Bughuul started. But Ashley piped up, \"But where do other people go? Where did Mommy and Daddy and Trevor go?\" Bughuul sighed. Or what could be considered a sigh. \"Heard of Dante?\" he asked. She shook her head. He replied, \"Dante was right.\" Then he disappeared. Tristin called, \"Ashley, come on! It's starting!\" Jonathon had selected Campfire 2 nd June '68 . Ashley sat down between Stephanie and Wendy as it rolled. Jonathon in a tent, with a boy next to him around the same age. Then the camera pointed out and showed a man and woman around the remnants of a campfire, talking. Then it showed all three bound, in separate tents. Something was smeared all over the tents. It was honey. Lots of honey. The camera stood some way away as two large, black bears came up from the trees. Mauling the tents, ripping them to get at the honey. Ashley could make out the victims were also coated in honey. Where had Jonathon got it from? Then Sandy chose hers. She smirked as she inserted Greenhouse 2 nd March '14 . They sat down as they watched. Sandy in a garden with an older girl. A man knelt over some tomatoes in a greenhouse and a woman was sitting at a patio table. Ashley could make out the sea view just beyond the house. Then it was night. The man, woman and girl were in the greenhouse, drugged, bound and gagged. Gardening tools lay around them. Then a large gardening fork was lifted up and rammed through the heart of the first victim. Ashley watched nonchalantly as the other two victims were stabbed the same way. Sandy explained as it ended. \"The dirt would also have got in the blood, which doubles the pain.\" Then Della put hers on. It was Treehouse 15 th March '79 . Della was sitting on the edge of a treehouse and two boys were pulling up a basket and reading a comic. Della then looked at her brothers as they drank green juice and the camera peered to the adults on the ground, talking and laughing. Night-time. The man, woman and two boys were in the treehouse, drugged, bound and gagged. A match was thrown and as the camera descended, the treehouse was consumed. Ashley could work out the victims struggling inside. When Della's finished, Elizabeth stood up and held hers up. Instead of immediately putting it in, she held it and stood in front of the projector. \"This is named Swimming Pool 9 th May '87 . I filmed this while on holiday from school. As you can see when we get inside, it was filmed at my family's leisure center.\" Stephanie asked, \"Why are you saying this?\" Elizabeth shrugged. \"I guess because I like telling before showing. Besides, Mom told me that when there were guests, I shouldn't be rude.\" Ashley pointed out, \"We're not guests. Bughuul's letting all of us live here.\" Isabella nodded. \"Yeah. This is our home.\" Elizabeth blushed, if she could blush. \"Sorry, I get carried away. Anyway, let's watch.\" The film began with a teenage boy and girl sitting on pool loungers, with Elizabeth jumping off the diving board. A man and woman were dressed in uniform as they clapped and watched them. Isabella murmured to Ashley as the screen showed Elizabeth and her sister take part in a water ballet, \"Show-off.\" Night. The pool's lights were still on, but the parents and Elizabeth's siblings were high up. One at a time, they were pushed into the water with a huge splash. Ashley could make out Elizabeth's sister struggling to hold onto the edge, her eyes wide and terrified. But Elizabeth stamped on her fingers and caused her to fall. As it ended, Sam put his in. Isabella asked, \"What's this one?\" and leaned forward excitedly. Then he held it up. Dancing, 17 th April '06 . It had Sam in a dance studio, along with a girl in a pink tutu and a teenage boy in a leotard. They were on the bar by the mirror, whilst a woman played at the piano. A man walked in holding a drinks cooler and Sam ran in after him, seemingly overjoyed. Gymnastics ribbons lay on a nearby table, along with sheet music. Then the man, woman, girl and boy to the bars. All were semi-conscious. Then the gymnastic ribbons, tied round the victims' ankles, were attached to piano wire inside the piano. A few keys were played on the piano, causing their legs to be raised up. Then the piano wire was snapped, lashing back at the victims. Sam said himself this was a very complicated death, so he'd had to take extra gymnastic ribbons. A day later and they'd have been clay pigeon shooting. Robert put the last one on and smiled to himself. He really enjoyed the creativity of this one, he told them. Ashley didn't see how it could top being sliced by piano wire. But as she watched Movie Night 27 th September '98 , she saw she was wrong . Two girls sat on blow-up mattresses in a living room, with a woman at a kitchen counter to the left and a man getting dinner from the oven. On the screen, a video was being reflected on a wall. As Ashley squinted, she could make out something being shown. It was the campfire reel they had just seen. All of a sudden, the two girls screamed silently, pointing. The reel stopped as the woman ran over, but then it showed another one. The swimming pool scene. The girls were crying and holding each other, the woman looked revolted and the man was banging the walls, trying to find whatever hideous contraception allowed this. It cut to the five eating around a dinner table, with the glasses of green juice. Suddenly, it went black. No music. Just...utter darkness. Then it went through different rooms. It began at the foot of the stairs and then ascended upwards, to the girls' room. On two different beds, they were spread-eagled, their hands tied to the frame. Suddenly, out of nowhere, in a wide shot of both girls, it showed them going from still to struggling like crazy. Small pools of blood were pouring from their necks. Then it had the woman in her room. An electric blanket was placed under the main one, as the woman's head lolled from side to side. Then the dad in the attic. Lying on the floor, trying to escape. The camera went back to the main bedroom, where the duvet was on fire. The smoke trailed up as the doors were all opened. In the attic, the man had pushed himself over to the window, where he was trying to bash it open with a hammer. Then he was pushed out and smashed on the gravel below. The video ended as Sam explained. \"I didn't want my sisters to suffer. Sure, Rebecca and Ruby were a pain, but they were still nice.\" A/N: OK, just a few more chapters, this time with the children from Sinister 2 narrating. Which video is your favourite or the scariest?[Chapter 7] Running Christopher groaned as the kids rallied around the projector in the house in Georgia where he now was with Darren and Matilda. This was not what he had envisioned when he had been alive. Each of the kids wanted theirs and were bickering. Ray Reed wanted Free-Falling, NYC, 10/16/1976 . Dudley Gardiner wanted Hike, SD, 11/5/1981 . Jolene Masterson wanted RV, NV, 7/27/1986 . Karl Penny wanted Karate, MA, 11/28/1989 . Burt Honeysett (some people had horrible parents) wanted Beach, GA, 5/25/1996 . Christopher was at boiling point. \"Shut up!\" he started, standing up. They all looked at him. He demanded, \"I'm the eldest, so I choose!\" Quentin argued, \"Na-ah, I am.\" \"I'm a year older.\" Christopher pointed out. Forest backed down, blowing his unfortunately honey-colored hair out of his eyes and kicked his trainers on the floor. Christopher asked, \"OK, kids, I'll pick one at a time. How about...Ray?\" The seven-year-old kid with freckles spreading from ear to ear grinned as they began to watch. It showed Ray's equally freckled family in an apartment in New York. Eating dinner, as a matter of fact. Ray's big sister was talking on the telephone in the background, ignoring her family. Matilda scowled. She knew how that felt. Then it was night. Ray's mother, father and sister were drugged, ropes tied around their waists. Then, one at a time, they were lifted over, as if they were taking part in a macabre bungee-jumping. As it ended, Christopher scanned the children, before deciding. \" RV .\" Jolene smirked as she slotted it in and lay back. The nine-year-old sniggered as it started up. Her biggest success. It had two identical blonde girls sitting at a table in an RV, taking part in a card game. Jolene was glumly looking out the window. A woman was reading on a bed and a man was driving. Then it cut to night. The two girls were on beds, the duvets covering their bound bodies as their heads lolled around. The woman was in the passenger seat and the man in the driver's seat. Bottles and cans had been emptied all over the floor; shampoos and washing-up liquid and cooking oil. Then a match was lit and thrown on the beds. The duvet moving as the victim underneath thrashed around. The camera moved to a cupboard where some marshmallows were pulled out. After they were inserted onto a kebab stick, the camera went up to the second bed. A match was thrown on that as well, as the camera moved safely behind the flames, by the door of the RV. The marshmallows were slowly turned over the flames on the first bed, before two more matches were thrown onto the seats. Christopher was slowly nodding as it ended, as if he was one of those dogs on the backs of cars. \"Impressive.\" He turned to Jolene. \"A plus.\" She squealed with excitement as Forest grumbled. Then it was Dudley's turn. As it began, he told them, \"This was for my birthday. Well, my birthday was actually a couple of weeks before, but Mom and Dad saved for it.\" \"Why?\" Christopher asked. Dudley explained. \"Turning ten was always a big thing in my family. Tom always told me he wanted to go to California for his tenth. I chose Mt Rushmore. If you look closely, you can see it in the background.\" It began. Walking along a mountainside, or something like that. A man, a woman, two boys. they were walking along a path and then at a picnic table, where Dudley got up and walked off as the three drank. Night. The man, woman and boy were at the edge of the path. All propped up on the other side of the fence. Sharp objects, such as a tin-opener and a knife, were taken from the rucksack on the picnic table. Then they were all shoved in their backs as the bodies rolled down the hill. As the reel ended, Karl selected his. A man, woman, boy and girl were in karate outfits, in a living room. Karl sat down by them as they ate a meal. There was a close-up as the boy drink from a takeaway cup. Night. Still in their outfits, the four were on three of the sofas around the coffee table, which still held their plates and the glowing drink, with the girl, who was even older than Christopher, behind the last. A samurai sword came out of nowhere, then sliced the man in the chest, right where the belt was. The others followed suit. Burt smirked as he put his in. It started off with a man, woman and a teenage boy on a beach. Sitting on towels and talking. The camera was propped up and caught them from a distance. Burt went up to them and sat with them. Then it was sunset. In the pink glow, the heads of the man, woman and boy were visible. Their bodies were bound, all in cylinders cut into the sand. The towels were still on the beach, some feet away. The camera backed up onto some stone steps and watched. The cylinders filled up with water and the three struggled to keep afloat. The tide was now coming in, as they tossed their heads round, trying to escape. But it was to no avail. As it finished, Christopher lay back, wondering. When would that Deputy stop?[Chapter 8] The Last of The Children Milo My name is Milo Josephson. I was ten years old when my family died on 30th April 1961 in Illinois. I had seen the pictures when I lived there. Sometime in April, I saw these two kids talking to me. Brita Johansen and Ernst Omdahl. Apparently, we used to live in Ernst's apartment. They showed me their drawings, but they handed me something better. \"An 8mm camera,\" Ernst told me, \"because Bughuul wants to move forward, make sure his work is captured. You'll be the first to use it.\" I smiled. I was content. I knew living in a farm in Illinois was rubbish anyway. I had so many plans for the world. Sometimes I would hold my toy cowboy gun at the window and pretend to hit the birds outside. Dad was such an idiot. He was a priest. But he swore at Mom. I had three older sisters. They were Rosa, Rachel and Melissa. Dad thought it would be sweet that our names matched. Rosa, Rachel and Melissa were sickening sweet to the outside world. Rosa worked at the charities and Rachel spoke up for African-Americans. But behind closed walls, they were as cruel as Dad. Rudy hit me and my sisters stole my stuff. Once they gave me a 'bath' – covering me in girly shampoo and throwing me in the bath in my clothes. So I decided it was time. Rats. I'd used rats. To attack the filth that they were. That Sunday, Dad spoke up about being kind. He never knew what kindness was. \"Unless ye become as little children, ye cannot enter the Kingdom of Heaven.\" As we finished, I waited for them to fall asleep. The rats did a good trick and I watched as I ate my last meal; a plate of fries. When it finished, I was finally happy. I could be free of my dad's tyranny. Emma I am Emma Glover. I was fourteen years old when my family died on 25th December 1975 in Michigan. I was Bughuul's oldest American child. I was a 'late bloomer', as Mom put it. So was she. I didn't see the reels. Dad did. He kept them secret in our house in Michigan. He said he was watching a bunch of amateur rubbish and that he didn't want us watching it. My siblings, James, aged nine, and Libby, aged twelve, were always bright and happy and laughing. Just like that Christmas, actually. I saw a man above my bed that night, just a few days before Christmas. I shared a room with Libby and looked over at her, fast asleep. What was this thing? What was this dark creature? Was it just a nightmare? Then I saw a kid. A kid standing by my bed. A boy in a scuba-diving outfit. He grinned at me. \"I'm Collin.\" He told me. \"I want to show you something.\" He said he used to live in California, by Miami Beach. That seemed to stir something. I remembered when we lived in Miami Beach. For eight months in 1972 and 1973, we'd lived there while Dad worked at a store selling sporting gear. I'd heard that a divorced mom used to live in my house with her three kids. That the boy was missing and that the mom and her daughters were found dead on the beach. So, this was Collin Newman. I planned my method rather early on. I just needed to wait for snow. I remember seeing it snow on Christmas Eve. It was after sunset and James was running towards the window, yelling with excitement. \"It's snowing! It's snowing!\" he cried, jumping up and down. Mom went up and kissed him on the forehead. \"You'll have plenty of fun for Christmas, won't you?\" she giggled. James shrieked and then I smiled. I'd already worked out the title in my head. I got what I wanted for Christmas, so I got a great last day. I got the illuminated globe, the last of the books in a favored series, a new U-matic. It was hard, even with Bughuul's help, to dig graves, but I guess I did it well. James was the last to die, so his eyes looked at the camera. But anyway, I really liked the church bell addition. Ted I am Ted Kellogg. I was eleven years old when my family were tragically mauled by alligators in Florida on 14th July 1977. My brothers had seen the videos first, in our basement a couple of miles from the crime scene. One was a senior in college, looking for something to help. They told me the movies were 'weird-looking' and had to be some twisted joke. Until I saw Bughuul above my bed that is. I learned to love him. He's fine. Just don't upset him. I asked Dad when we were on the boat, \"So, expect to catch anything big?\" He chuckled. \"Ted ma boy,\" he breathed, \"the biggest stuff round here are gators and you definitely don't wanna catch them.\" That inspired me. When they were having a drink, I set it up. The alligators would be tempted, so I hung them over from the trees. The alligators made quick work and I smiled in the cool summer night. I hung around a little while, watched the crime scene tape, the reporters saying that an 'eleven-year-old vulnerable boy is missing and it is vital that he be returned safe'. I heard they suggested I was alligator meat and ruled me as dead. Apparently that's why it took so long for the Deputy to find me. Catherine My name is Catherine Richardson. I was eight years old on 6th February 1985, when I lived in Minnesota. My family were sadly killed in Dad's dentist surgery. It all started a few days earlier when I had come after school. Dad said I may as well have an appointment. I never liked it. Being a dentist's kid isn't fair. I was reading when I was alone in the lobby, skimming over the bad parts and moaning to myself that Dad had a lousy job. My sister Martina didn't care. She said Dad could have it worse. Well, I certainly didn't think so. I heard someone call, \"Hi.\" So I put my book down. A girl stood nearby, with a bobble hat. Then just behind her was a boy in white. \"Dad's unavailable, sorry.\" I told them, but then they moved forward. The boy held a reel titled Fishing Trip . \"Watch it, Catherine. We might find you'll enjoy it.\" The boy grinned at me. So over the next few days, I watched Birthday Party , Surfing , Christmas Morning and Fishing Trip . I found myself reeled in by it. Maybe because Bughuul has an odd effect over us. According to Jekyll and Hyde (Dad talked about it over the table on New Year's because we saw an old movie), there is a good and bad side to everyone. But Bughuul pulls the bad side and makes it – as Dad would put it – 'dominant'. Bughuul changes us. But by this point, we don't care. I drugged the drinks during after hours. I put them all in the dentist chairs and had it all done. Mom and Dad and Martina were constantly screaming. The drill couldn't drown out the sound. It was supposed to be easy. But I just couldn't do it very well with them screaming. I just shoved it right through Dad's head. Mom was next. Then I stood right in front of Martina, holding it by my side, blood over my top. \"Please Catherine,\" she was sobbing, \"don't hurt me.\" I snarled. \"I'm giving this to you because you're a mean sister and I hate you!\" I held it carefully and giggled as she died. Peter My name is Peter Fitzroy. I was ten years old when my family died in Minnesota on 11th November 1997. I first saw the films when I came across them only a month after we moved in. We hadn't set anything up yet and were still paining the rooms. My stuff was all over my room; a Simpsons game, soft toys and my medals from my activity days in my old school. I found the reels under the desk. The titles made me curious. \" Horse-Riding ? Campfire ? Dentist Appointment ?\" I couldn't understand. I guess I was frightened at first. Hiding under my duvet. But I decided to be brave. I watched them and then they egged me on, Lyn and Jonathon and Catherine. And then I planned it. The kitchen was still being done. My parents and my brother Kent were sat down. We'd ordered some takeaway food, so I put the drug in their drinks. I waited until nightfall before I tied them up. I had my wellingtons on and held the cable. I let the water out. I held the camera by it, so I'd get a good shot. I could make out their terrified faces in the gloomy darkness. I didn't care any more. I was Bughuul's. I threw it and then they all flopped around, like fish after you take them out of a bowl. It was rather fun. I liked the light show as well. It was quite bright. When I left, I wondered how they'd be able to get my family out. I guessed that perhaps the rescue services had unique equipment for this. 2015 It was three months since the Deputy had vanished. The police had investigated, so had the FBI. They'd come up with something. All those houses. Burnt to the ground. The disappearances of Stephanie Stevenson, Ashley Oswalt and Zach Collins. All connected to him. So a decision was made. The Deputy was wanted for questioning with the murders and disappearances. Dubbed 'The Family Murders', the FBI were investigating unsolved homicides with the same modus operandi going back to 1961. Thirty-four different abductions, countless multiple homicides and arson. The theory, devised from documents written by Ellison Oswalt from back before he vanished, Professor Jonas' research and the different arson attacks across the States, was that an underground cult abducted children, murdered the witnesses in bizarre ways as offerings to a god, then took the children to the cult for unknown purposes. The Deputy could be a member or a victim or even both; it hadn't been decided. But he was listed as the prime suspect in the abductions of Stephanie Stevenson, Ashley Oswalt and Zach Collins. Their three pictures smiled out from the FBI poster with the Deputy's photo from his days in the force above it. ' Wanted for Abduction ' the headline read. And it was impossible to not look at the three children without feeling some hint of sympathy, anger and worry. Everyone in America was afraid. Afraid for their children, for their livelihoods. What was this horrendous cult that struck without warning and where were the children? Thirty-five faces were lined up on a wall in the FBI. Young children, older children, smiling, frowning, school photos and family photos, black-and-white or color. Then the picture of the symbol, dotted beneath them. It hadn't been released to the public. After all, law enforcement need to keep something to themselves otherwise they wouldn't know who was the genuine article.

Supernatural. An area that many are unable to comprehend, especially in our century of science and technology. People might think that they know everything, that all can be explained scientifically, but it is one big delusion. There are still many mysteries that science is unable to explain. Many of us think: if something is not visible to the eyes, then it doesn't exist. Right? Wrong. Humans are not the only beings that inhabit this world. Moreover, there are other dimensions beside the one humans live in. And sometimes a few of them are lucky or unlucky enough to encounter visitors from these dimensions, entities that own the ability to cross the border between their and our worlds, and if you find some being appearing to you more than once or following you constantly, it's a sign that it is interested in you for some reason or wants something from you. This is the story of Lena Firth, one of the rare humans beings that encountered a malevolent visitor from another dimension. Lena's life has been rather usual, nothing out of ordinary. She finished studies, both bachelor and then master program, and now worked as a manager of a grocery store. Everyone in her area knew her as a very practical and hard working person, and, at the same time, an interesting conversation partner. People thought her to be one of those so-called realists who would dismiss such things as ghosts, spirits, etc., as a fairytale or a fruit of someone's sick imagination. But oh, they were so wrong… Lena might pretend to be like that, but deep inside she believed in all this otherworldly stuff and was sure that people are not alone in this world. But she was ashamed to speak about it, as she didn't want to be known as a psychopath or anything of that kind. And so her life continued until recent days. While going to work and back, the young woman had a strange feeling… like of being watched. It's like someone or something was following her all the time, but she could not see it. Lena thought she might be paranoid, but feelings of that kind never appear from thin air. If you suddenly feel nervous, there is always a reason for this. But even more strange is that she began feeling like that after she found out that some time ago in her neighborhood a whole family of four members were literally hanged by their necks on a branch of a tree in the backyard of their house. And the fifth member, ten-year old Stephanie, has mysteriously vanished without a trace, and nobody has still found her, just like no one has found the murderer yet. It made Lena remember a few more cases she had heard about murdered families. Some were burnt alive in a garage, some were drowned in a swimming pool, some had their throats slit. And each of the cases involved a missing child of every family. But there was one more case, more recent one, with the Oswalt family, and that was terrifying. One day, when Lena went back home, she saw a bunch of police cars surrounding a house and a crowd of onlookers. Curiosity got the best of her and she dared to approach one of the officers and ask what happened. It happened to be a deputy that knew the writer, Ellison Oswalt, personally and tried to help him to solve the cases of murders and missing children. He told Lena that Oswalt was a true crime writer and planned to write a book about the Stevenson family that was hanged on a tree and whose daughter, Stephanie, went missing. As the deputy and Ellison Oswalt maintained kind of a friendly relationship, he was saddened by the death of a writer and his family. Oswalt himself, then his wife, Tracy, and their son, Trevor, who was twelve years old at the moment, were brutally murdered, dismembered with an axe. Their seven-year old daughter, Ashley, vanished, just like the kids of all previous deceased families. All of this sounded frightening, but Lena couldn't resist the temptation to find out more. It was like something was urging her to dig deeper and find out what it was all about. It seemed that this deputy had information and she managed to convince him to tell more. When he asked her why she needed all of it, Lena confessed that she couldn't find peace because of being sure that somebody was stalking her. So they arranged a meeting at Lena's place to talk things over without any other person listening. When he arrived, the woman invited him to the dining room for a cup of tea. He gladly accepted the offer and sat at the table, holding a folder in his hands. \"So, Ms. Firth, let's get to business. You said someone is stalking you. Who is it? Have you seen the person?\" \"I don't know who it is, and that's the main problem,\" Lena said. \"I couldn't see him well, I just noticed from the far distance that the guy was dressed in black and had dark hair, approximately till the shoulders. But that's it, I can tell no more. He was very far away from me, and I've spotted him a few times, the last time was today on my way to work. I have told about it to my colleagues and asked whether they had ever noticed this strange guy, but no, neither of them had. So is it only me that is seeing him? I might sound crazy, but I know one thing for sure – I'm scared, deputy. I'm very scared. I can't sleep peacefully at night because of fear. I literally feel the presence of something, and it is following my steps, although keeping distance, for now.\" \"All right. But why are you interested in these murder cases for the first part? Do you think there is a connection between them and this stalker of yours?\" Lena cleared her throat and answered: \"I'm kinda sure about it, deputy. Let me explain. I think this because the stalking began right after I found out about the Stevensons and the murder cases before them. If it started before I got this knowledge, I wouldn't be that much worried, and I doubt that someone would need to stalk me at all. It might be a coincidence, but I doubt it. Something tells me there is a connection, and I want to make things clear.\" Deputy scratched his head and told: \"That sounds scary. When I spoke to Mr. Oswalt, he also complained that there was something in his house, he also felt the ominous presence. And he didn't believe in anything paranormal.\" \"But do you believe in it?\" Lena asked quickly. \"Of course, I do,\" deputy replied. \"I told him that if I were him, I wouldn't stay even for one night in a house where the whole family was hanged by their necks in the backyard, and their daughter is God knows where.\" Then he opened the folder and pulled out a few photographs with a strange symbol in them. \"What is this?\" Lena asked, studying the pictures. \"You see, Mr. Oswalt moved to that house intentionally, without telling anything to his wife,\" deputy explained. \"He wanted to write his next book about this case. And then he found a box with a projector and several reel of Super 8 mm footage. These films were actually murder footage of several families. And these pictures of a symbol that I'm showing you right now, were spotted in the films by Mr. Oswalt. He managed to scan them and printed them out.\" \"So is it some Satanic stuff actually?\" the woman asked, her curiosity growing stronger with each second. \"I don't know what it is, but it's definitely something of the occult,\" deputy replied. \"I advised Mr. Oswalt to call the University and contact professor Jonas, the occult crime expert. He could give more information about this symbol, if he had ever stumbled on it.\" \"And? Did you speak to Mr. Oswalt about it afterwards?\" \"Yes,\" he nodded and pulled out a few more pictures, this time containing the images of a strange, creepy figure. \"This is another thing that Oswalt spotted in the films.\" \"Who is this?\" Lena stared to the images in fear, feeling hot sweat covering her face. This figure was eerily similar to the guy that was stalking her. \"Well, Mr. Oswalt didn't tell me all the details of his talk with the professor, but one we understood for sure – this guy is behind all those murders. When we began our first talk, Mr. Oswalt asked me to help him to find out the exact addresses of all the deceased families, and I found the connection between each case. If you put them in chronological order, you can draw a line from murder to murder. I found out that each family lived in a house where the previous crime happened. For example, the Millers, who got their throats slit, have previously lived in Sacramento, where the Martinez family was burnt in a garage. And the Martinez family, before moving to the place where Millers died, previously lived in the place where a family was drowned in a swimming pool. And now, the Oswalt family lived in the house where the Stevensons were hanged, then they moved to the place where they were dismembered. I realized that if the family moved to another place, they sped up that guy's timeline and put themselves into it. I don't know who this strange guy is, but I have a feeling that he killed the families and kidnapped one of each family's children. We're investigating, but it will take hell of a time to find him and the missing kids.\" Noticing that Lena's face was already covered in sweat, he stopped talking, concentrating his sight on her fully. \"Are you alright? Ms. Firth, if there is something you want to tell me, do it. You can speak frankly with me about this theme, considering how much I have already told you.\" Lena took a paper towel and wiped the sweat from her face. Her heart was pounding like crazy. Now she was absolutely sure that it is definitely this guy following her. But why? – she thought to herself. - What does he want from me? Does he know that I've found out about his crimes? If so, then how could he know that? Millions of questions raced through her mind, but she could find no answers to any of them. It was pure panic inside of her, although she did her best to hide it. \"Deputy…\" she began through heavy panting, lifting one of the images of a spooky guy. \"I'm now sure that it is him that stalks me. This figure in the photos shares too many similarities with my stalker – black clothes, dark hair and pale face. So much I could notice. I think he somehow found out that I know about his crimes and now he definitely wants to get rid of the witness.\" Deputy took another sip of tea and tried to calm the woman down. \"Don't worry, Ms. Firth, we will do our best to prevent another murder, if that is his intention. I sure would also like to know who this creepy bastard is, and if he is interested in you, he will definitely show up again. I will contact the police station so they can arrange the patrol of your area and your house specifically. The suspect is keeping distance, at least for now, which is good, so we will keep a constant eye on you and try to catch him. I can only hope that we succeed.\" \"Thank you very much, I'd be very grateful for that,\" Lena sighed. \"I'm very afraid, really.\" \"Try to stay calm and don't panic,\" said the deputy, packing the images back into the folder. \"I'm glad you told me about it. I will also speak with the sheriff and offer an idea of demolishing that house where the Oswalt family was killed, so no unfortunate potential victims could suffer their fate. There have been too many tragedies, and we're not going to allow another one to happen.\" Finishing his tea, deputy stood up and spoke: \"Well, thank you very much for the tea. It's time for me to go now. As I promised, I'll arrange the police patrol to keep you safe. You have my phone number and my e-mail, so feel free to contact me anytime.\" \"Thanks, deputy,\" Lena said with a kind smile, shaking hands with him. \"I want you to know that I truly appreciate your kindness. I count on you.\" \"Of course, it's my pleasure,\" he smiled back. \"I tried to help Mr. Oswalt as much as I could, but… you see the result. He and his family were already doomed when they moved into the crime place, so I'm afraid there was not much I could do. When I met him, he was already too far with his investigation. So… if you see that guy again, let me know at once, alright?\" \"Sure, I will,\" Lena replied while he stepped out of the house. \"Thank you once again and good night.\" \"You're welcome,\" deputy smiled. \"Good night and stay safe.\" After he left Lena's place, she sighed in relief. She was happy to stumble on this kind man that was more than willing to help. She had much information to think about and truly hoped that they will manage to get their hands on that creepy asshole. She was still nervous, but at least now she could count on help. With this thought, Lena went to bed, hoping for a peaceful sleep.[Chapter 2] The Assignment Of a Demon Chapter 2 Surprisingly, this night Lena slept peacefully. Most likely the reason for it was that she could count on help from the police. At least she knew she wasn't alone and somebody believed her. With the morning alarm came the new day. The first thing she did after getting up from the bed was peeking out of the window, just to make sure that no one was watching the house. Luckily, the strange creeper was nowhere to be seen. That was comforting. At least he didn't follow her footprints all twenty-four hours per day. Leaving home, Lena noticed two police officers, one on the other side of the street and another one a bit farther away, both patrolling the area. Good, the deputy did what he promised and police was keeping a watch on Lena's house and the surrounding area. If anything happens, the stranger will not get away so easy this time. The woman turned around many times on her way to work, trying to notice any signs of the mysterious stalker, but nothing was out of ordinary. She even didn't feel his presence and no paranoia of being watched. And so it continued for several days, like things have returned to normality. But Lena didn't relax just yet, this seemingly peaceful atmosphere might be like silence before the storm. Oh, how right she was when thinking that! One evening, after the arrival home from work, Lena started feeling nervous again. Could it mean that the stranger was back on her tracks again? It is said that human bodies are able to pick up the bad vibrations, which is a sign that something is not right. Deputy advised her to stay inside at all costs, lock all the windows and doors and not to let anyone in, except for him and his colleagues. He would warn her in case he or any police officer was planning to pay a visit, so if there was no warning, she shouldn't open the door to anybody. The good news were that the deputy spoke to the sheriff and he approved the demolition of Oswalt house and also the Stevenson house, and this will be done already tomorrow, around three o'clock, starting with the Oswalt family home. What's more, sheriff had plans to contact his colleagues in other states where the murders happened and do the same to all other houses and burn all the places down if anything is left afterwards. As the deputy himself is a believer in supernatural kind of stuff, he said it is always good to be cautious, and no one should move into the house where such tragedies happened, especially the ones connected with occultism. This already sounds superstitious, but it is better this way. It is better to look funny then to allow another tragedy to happen. Such future outlook was completely fine for Lena. Thus they maybe could put an end to this vicious cycle of death. This thought made her smile, despite the growing panic inside. She had a bad feeling that nothing will go as easy as she thought. Anyway, it was time to rest, as it got dark already and the night was approaching fast. Lena switched the light off in the kitchen and prepared to go to her bedroom, but… she didn't know why, which devil made her do it, but she walked to the kitchen window to peek outside. At that moment she thought her heart would literally jump out of her chest. There, in the backyard, he stood in his ghostly glory within the high bushes, his pale face clearly visible, illuminated by moonlight. Lena couldn't see his eyes, as they looked more like two dark spots, but it was more than clear that he was staring right at her. Lena jumped away from the window, panting heavily and covered in sweat, but the further, the more she desired to check again if he is still there. She nearly expected him to stand right in front of the window, but no, she was wrong. He was nowhere to be seen. Lena slowly moved to her bedroom then, as her phone was lying on a night table. She had to call the deputy and let him know that this creepy bastard was back and that he was in her backyard now. But just as she touched the phone, Lena heard a faint sound in the hall. At first she dismissed it as a hallucination, as the fear has large eyes, and her own mind could have played tricks on her. But she was quickly convinced in being wrong, as after a few seconds it was followed by a silent, but clear sound of footsteps. Now Lena was overwhelmed by pure, animalistic fear, and all she could think about was to hide in a closet, hoping that this someone, whoever he was, wouldn't find her. Phone calls could be forgotten now, as he would definitely hear her talking, even if she whispered. Lena could only wonder how the hell he got into the house, as the door and all the windows were firmly locked. All she could do at this moment was waiting. The footsteps sounded rather slow and unhurried, but with each of them the sound grew louder and louder until Lena could clearly hear them in the room. It seemed that the stranger knew exactly where she was, as he deliberately approached her hiding spot. And as a confirmation of her suspicions, the closet doors suddenly were widely open and a tall figure of a man in black stood before her. Lena didn't manage to react as his large hand grabbed her by the throat and pulled out of the closet. That guy was definitely strong, as it seemed easy for him to pull an adult person by the neck out of a hiding place. Right in the next second Lena was pressed firmly to the wall. It was clear that she was not going anywhere in the nearest time. Several intense minutes passed in silence while the creepy man obviously was studying the woman. Lena used this moment too and inspected him closely. He was dressed in black coat which seemed a bit old-fashioned to me and black pants, and underneath the coat the collar of a white shirt was visible. His hair was raven black, shoulder length and looked rather messy. But the most frightening were his very pale, in fact, greyish skin colour and the face, if it could even be called a face. The only part of his face than looked human was the nose, but the eyes… To Lena, they looked like two triangular-shaped black spots, and the mouth wasn't visible at all, just a smudged, long and dark spot instead. He looked exactly like in those photos that the deputy showed her. If it was a mask, it sure looked terrifying. But something told Lena it was no mask, but a true face of this… man. Or was he even human? He looked more or less like that, but somehow she doubted that he was one. And she also noticed that his hands had the same grey colour as his face. All in all, his general appearance was indeed grisly. It was… sinister. \"Hiding is useless, Lena,\" a deep, low voice rang out in her head. \"You can't hide from me.\" What the hell? How does he know what my name is? – Lena was beyond terrified. \"W-who are you? How do you know my name?\" she asked in a trembling voice. Most likely he spoke to her telepathically, considering the lack of mouth. \"I know so much about you, Lena, I've been watching you for a long time already. And I know all the secrets of your dark soul.\" What? My… dark soul? – Now Lena was confused. - What is he talking about? \"Confused, I see? Well, let me help you then.\" The stranger then put the other hand on Lena's head while still holding her neck in his iron grip. She wasn't going anywhere in any case, but it seemed that he wanted to be sure of that. Suddenly a new understanding dawned upon her. Lena realized that deep inside she often wanted to do terrible things to people that she didn't like for one or another reason. Such things that only a true monster was able to do. She often fantasized how she would burn one of them alive, tear the other one's mouth apart, impale the third one, but do it painfully slow. In her mind, Lena was enjoying their suffering, their painful screams were like music to her ears. This is what he meant with the secrets of her dark soul. He was able to look behind the outer shell of Lena's human body and discover her true nature of a monster. Actually, it wasn't a new understanding, it was something he helped her to discover in the depths of her mind and realize what she truly was. And what is even more interesting – Lena felt all her fear of him fading into thin air. \"Do you understand now? This is what I saw in you. Your potential. That is why I followed you, letting you know of my presence now and then. I am so enthralled by you, Lena.\" \"Well, all right, let's assume it is so. But you still haven't told me who you are,\" she said, looking into his bizarre face. \"I am Bughuul, the devourer of children. I exist for thousands of years and feed on the souls of children to maintain my own existence.\" Ah, so that's it. Now the whole picture of the murders was becoming clear, or so Lena thought. \"So you are behind each family massacre, right?\" she couldn't help her curiosity. \"There was always one missing child. You kill the families and take away one of their children, don't you?\" \"Not really. I choose one victim and make him or her drug and then kill all the family before taking the child to my world where it is trapped for eternity.\" Now Lena understood it. This is why the police had always run into a dead end during the investigation of these crimes. They will never find the killer and the children that vanished without a trace. Because the missing children are the killers, controlled by a demonic entity, this Bughuul. His name sounded strange to Lena, as she had never heard about it, but it didn't matter now. She was determined to find out what his intentions were. \"Okay, now be so kind and tell me why you are here. I highly doubt you came here just to say how enthralled you are by me,\" Lena grinned slyly. \"You're right,\" Bughuul replied, although nothing in his face moved, not even a nod of a head. \"I have much more important reason for that. I have a task for you.\" \"What task?\" she began blinking fast. \"It seems that after the last ritual, humans have become smarter. Now they will avoid these places like a plague, and the last place of the ritual is going to be destroyed tomorrow. And in the attic of that house is a box labelled \"Home movies\", containing the things for a new cycle. You shall go to that house and collect that box, bring it to your place and keep it hidden until I give further indications.\" After what Lena had just heard, she felt like a bucket of ice cold water was poured on her. He wanted her to work with him? But why? Why does he suddenly need help? \"Wait a minute. Why do you need me for that? Can't you manage it on your own? If I understand it right, you were always working on your own,\" Lena said, not fully understanding the deal. \"One of the reasons is known to you. And now it's time to get to business, without asking the unnecessary questions. And, I'm afraid, you don't have plenty of options.\" No options… It meant that Lena had to do it, whether she wanted it or not. And since when should a demon care about the wishes of anyone else, except for his own? \"One more question, and believe me, it's a necessary one,\" Lena had to clear the last things up. \"The Oswalt family house is definitely cordoned off, not mentioning about being locked. How can I get inside and stay unnoticed?\" \"Don't worry about that. I'll take care of it. When you are there, the house will be open for you. Remember – a box in the attic with a \"Home movies\" label.\" \"All right, so be it,\" she sighed, although it wasn't easy to do, as his hand was still on her neck. \"I'll do it, since I have no choice.\" \"Good. Obedient girl, I like that,\" the demon's voice now sounded satisfied. \"Precisely, you have no choice. You know where the Oswalt house is. Now go and complete the assignment. I will pay you a visit soon.\" This time Lena just nodded in response, without saying a word. Bughuul, in turn, returned this gesture and finally let her go. As soon as she was free from his grasp, the demon vanished, like nothing has happened. \"Damn, this is just hilarious,\" - Lena said to herself. \"I became an ally of some demonic entity, and he didn't care to ask whether I agree to do it or not.\" But she knew well that if she dared to disobey, the punishment would be very severe. So she dressed up in black pants and pullover, not forgetting to put a cap on her head to cover as much skin as possible. She had to go unnoticed, so the more body is covered, the better, so she could merge with the darkness. And here she was, standing in front of the main door, ready for the most dangerous journey in her life…[Chapter 3] The Assignment Of a Demon Chapter 3 Lena looked at her watch, breathing nervously. It showed fifteen minutes to twelve. She was planning to begin her way to Oswalt house at midnight, at least there were less chances to be noticed by somebody. The police patrol sent by the deputy, were active at daytime, so Lena doubted that they would watch the area also at night, but you can never know. Either way, she had to be careful. At least she was dressed in black, so it would be hard to spot her in the dark. When it was finally midnight, she opened the front door a bit and peeked outside. The lights in her house were all out for some time already, so everyone around probably thought that she was asleep. Well, it was only better for her. Lena put the gloves on first and then closed the door and locked it, putting the keys into the pocket of her jacket. It was important not to leave fingerprints anywhere, so using the gloves from the beginning was definitely a plus. Lena might be a bit paranoid, but being cautious was the number one priority. The streets were deserted, not a single soul, but were well illuminated by street lights. Lena did her best to stay in the shadows and keep away from the light as far as possible. It took her around twenty-five or thirty minutes to reach the destination, considering how slow she moved, afraid to make extra noise. The Oswalt house was located just a few quarters away from her home, and if she walked fast, like she usually did, she would be there in fifteen minutes as maximum. Lena only wondered how it would be possible to get inside, as the place was definitely locked up and cordoned off. Bughuul told her not to worry about it, but could she trust a demon? That would be a crazy idea. Such creatures can never be trusted, but in this case she had no choice. Finally, there it was. The place of the last crime. From the outside it looked like a normal house, just like the others, but Lena knew of terrible things that happened there. She approached it from the right, looking for a way to get inside. Everything was locked, and she tried to push and pull, but all in vain. Then she decided to search the backside of the house and… what do you know? One of the windows was slightly ajar. Could it be that they forgot to close it or did Bughuul take care of it? Actually, it didn't matter. This was her chance to get in, which Lena used at once, trying to do it as quiet as possible. The room she got in turned out to be a kitchen when she took out her flashlight and shone it around. All in all it looked lovely, rather wide, and Lena thought that each housekeeper would like to have such kitchen. But there was no time to admire it, as she had to find the stairs that led to upper floor and get into the attic. The door out of the kitchen led into the hallway and when a ray of the flashlight touched its walls, Lena barely could make herself stand straight. The walls were smeared with what appeared to be blood. Besides, among the chaotic smears several drawings of kittens and unicorns could be distinguished. Lena could only guess who would do such thing. Then she remembered that the daughter of the Oswalts disappeared after the murdered family was discovered. Could it really be her that did all this? Probably. She remembered Bughuul explaining that he makes his victims drug and then kill their entire family before kidnapping them. But could a seven-year old girl commit all of this? Then it dawned on Lena that if Ashley was under Bughuul's control, she could be capable of anything, like all the other children he took. The spot where the woman stood at the moment looked like one true hallway of hell, so it was better to get out of there, and fast. The next room Lena got in was rather large, there was a fireplace between two big windows and a desk near one of them. She guessed this was where Ellison Oswalt usually worked and wrote his books. And that's where she found a few puddles of blood. This is where Ashley executed her parents and brother by the order of Bughuul. The bodies were already taken away, but the blood was still there. The murder weapon was nowhere to be seen. Lena wondered why they haven't wiped it yet, as it's more than clear whose blood it is. She doubted it would somehow help the investigation, but who was she to judge? The police and detectives sure knew their business better. \"Now, where the hell could the stairs be?\" Lena whispered to herself and shone the flashlight around the room. And there it was, practically behind her back. She had to be careful not to step into the blood by accident, so while she walked from the hallway into the living room and then to the stairs, she shone the light to the floor under her feet. Lena sure didn't want to leave footprints or any other traces of her presence here, otherwise she would betray herself. Thus all the plans could go awry and Bughuul would be in rage. In that case, the punishment would be inevitable. The young woman went upstairs quietly, looking back every few seconds, like being afraid to stumble on something or someone. She had heard about haunted houses many times in her life, about the unfortunate souls of murder victims or those who committed suicide for some reason. It seemed like there was some ominous presence in this house, but all was silent. This house was like one large grave. Altogether the upper floor had four rooms – Ashley's room, her brother's room and their parents' bedroom, the fourth one was the bathroom. Nothing out of order. All the rooms were closed, but Lena had no wish to check them. Besides, there was nothing of use for her. She had to find the attic. Speaking of which, there it was, in the middle of the hallway, a hatch in the ceiling. And lucky for Lena, it was open. It looked like the investigators had already climbed there once, as the ladder was standing right there, at the wall. All she had to do was to put it underneath the hatch and climb up there herself. The attic looked empty, nothing special. The Oswalts might not have made a use of it, at least not yet. If they were still alive, perhaps they could have turned it into an extra room, as there was enough space for that. Lena began to look for the box Bughuul talked about. He said to search for the one that is labelled \"Home movies\". She saw a few large boxes with some domestic stuff, still unpacked, as the Oswalts had just moved into this place before their demise. Maybe the box she searched for was hidden behind them, as she couldn't see it anywhere else. Bingo! There it was, well hidden behind the big boxes and a pile of different stuff and rubbish. On its cover there are only two words written in large block letters: \"HOME MOVIES\". Lena could barely hold back her curiosity and peek inside the box to see what's inside, but she realized this was no place for such things. She had to go back home and there she could check it out. The box had some weight, so it would cause a bit of a problem to climb down the ladder and then out of the kitchen window. Or maybe not… Anyway, it wasn't that heavy that a woman couldn't carry it, so Lena took it and put it right at the edge of the hatch, stepping down to the top of the ladder. She managed to get down with the box and put the ladder back where it stood before. Everything must look like it was before her arrival, not to cause any suspicions. As Lena climbed outside through the kitchen window, she tried to leave it a bit ajar, just like it was before she got here. She didn't know why it was left like that, but to hell with it, she only had to make sure everything was left seemingly untouched. Hopefully, no one would notice anything. Well, nothing except for the disappearance of the box she was carrying. But no one would even think that it was her who took it. It would take a lot of time to figure out who did it, so for now Lena could be peaceful. As soon as she reached her house, she locked the door firmly and rushed to her bedroom. She couldn't wait to see what was inside the box, although she had an approximate guess. Lifting the cover up, Lena shone the flashlight on it and yes, there were an old projector and several reel of Super 8 mm footage. Deputy had mentioned something about a box with such content too, but what is it all about? And what would Bughuul want it for? But, if he needed to keep these things safe, then there was a reason for that. Lena was sure that soon she would find it out. The young woman was preparing to put the cover back when something caught her eye. As the light touched the inside of it, there were several drawings seen on it, obviously children's. These were depictions of death scenes of families, the last one showed three people chopped in pieces. This was clearly Ashley's job. And by each of the scenes there was a figure standing aside and named \"Mr. Boogie\". It was him, Bughuul. So he was present at each murder scene and watched to make sure everything went smoothly. And now he was probably looking for the next victims to reiterate the macabre cycle once again. Anyway, Lena had no idea how to use such old technologies and also had no wish to do anything now. She just had to make sure this box stayed safe until Bughuul gave further orders. So she covered it and pushed it underneath her bed for now. Tomorrow she would look for a better place to hide it. Bughuul would definitely make an appearance the next evening when she is alone at home, so till then it would be fine. For now she could rest in peace and soon slumber took her in its embrace.[Chapter 4] The Assignment Of a Demon Chapter 4 Lena didn't expect to have a peaceful sleep this night, considering the recent events. It surprised her that she was able to fall into slumber that soon. So this night she could rest after all. But man, how wrong she was! As soon as the dream world took her into its arms, a faint whisper broke through it. \"Wake up, Lena.\" At first Lena was sure this voice sounded in her dreams, so she continued sleeping. But in a moment she felt her sleep being interrupted as a hand was put on her shoulder, shaking her lightly. \"Wake up.\" The second time this phrase was said loudly, in the same emotionless voice she had heard before. Bughuul was back. But why had he decided to appear right now, in the middle of the night? Was it really impossible to wait till the next evening? \"Oh… hey,\" Lena said, rubbing her eyes to see clearer. \"Why did you wake me up now, in the middle of the night? What's wrong?\" \"Did you do what I told you?\" The woman said nothing, but just climbed out of bed and sat on her knees in front of it, pulling out the box from underneath. And when she lifted her eyesight to the demon standing before her, Lena could swear that if he had a mouth, he would have smirked. But his face, as always, showed zero emotions. \"Good to know it's safe,\" he said with a hint of a sinister laugh in his voice. \"So, what now? You woke me up just for that? To check whether the box is safe and sound?\" Lena asked not without irritation. She was annoyed, thinking that he didn't let her sleep for this reason alone. \"No, of course not. Your mission for this night is not yet over.\" \"What do you mean?\" \"I have found the new family to begin my cycle once again. Your job is to deliver the box into their house and leave it in the attic so they can find it. The beginning of the process already is up to me.\" At this moment Lena felt like wanting to punch him into the face. Why couldn't he do it himself? She would agree to get into an abandoned house, but to the place where people still live? \"Damn it, Mr. Boogie,\" she huffed in annoyance, but at the same time grinning when calling him the name that children gave him in their drawings. \"You could have at least warned me earlier! How am I supposed to get into the place that is inhabited without being noticed? I'm more than sure they would notice the traces of someone else's presence, not mentioning about the house itself being firmly locked for the night.\" Bughuul laughed when she pronounced the funny nickname. Although he seemed entertained by that, one Lena knew for sure – this demonic laugh of his made her shiver not less than the first time she saw him. Of course, nowadays you can hear similar sounds in horror movies, but all of them appear to be manipulations of some specific programs. This, however, was not a programmed sound, but a true demon laughing. \"Oh, Lena, it's such fun seeing you worried and annoyed at the same time,\" he continued laughing, this time slyly. \"Watching you in this state is worth many things.\" Great, just damn great. Now he decided that it's a good time to come and make fun of me? What an asshole! – Lena was now beyond angry. \"Listen, if you think you can just appear in my house and mock me, you're pretty wrong,\" she hissed through her teeth. \"First you find me useful and then suddenly decide to laugh at me like I'm some kind of idiot or something? What the hell do you want from me then?\" Lena couldn't hold herself from raising the voice anymore. Bughuul tilted his head like in confusion, his messy black hair swinging from side to side. But in truth, he probably expected such reaction from the woman's side. \"Ah, I see that someone can't take a joke?\" now the sound he made was more similar to giggling. \"First of all, it made me laugh when you called me \"Mr. Boogie\", like all the children that I took. And second, I really liked seeing you in the state between being worried and annoyed. It only adds more charm to you.\" \"Alright, forget it,\" Lena sighed, feeling defeated. \"Let's get to business then. Tell me what to do.\" The demon nodded slightly, obviously satisfied with her obedience. \"That's more like it. Now, listen to me carefully. The place you have to reach is located on Floyd Street, number of the house is ten. There is a family of four living there. What you must do is creep into their house with the box and leave it in the attic. The rest is my job.\" Lena thought for a moment, trying to concentrate on the location of the street. \"Floyd Street? As far as I know, it's in a totally different district. Not very far, but I barely know the district itself. It will sure take hell of a time to find the right place.\" \"Don't worry about that. I will follow you in the distance and guide you. You won't get lost.\" \"But what about the traces? And how can I get inside the building?\" \"Leave it to me. I will open it for you and remove every trace of your presence, just like I did the last time after you took the box. Now dress up and get going.\" Well, so much of the talking. Lena knew she had to do it, not like that she had plenty of options. Bughuul vanished from her room and she began to change. She put on the same clothes like before, all black, including the cap and gloves. Even if he promised to remove all the traces, she had to provide maximum safety for herself. You can never trust a demon blindly, as it might end not in the best way. The journey took around one hour to reach the destination. Well, it was lucky for Lena to be woken at 2:00 a.m. and not later. Each time she had problems with orientation, Bughuul's voice echoed in her head, directing her to the right way. The streets were absolutely empty, but the woman tried to stick to the shadows anyway. And every time she turned around, she saw a glimpse of Bughuul in the bushes or among the trees. Lena had to admit that thus he looked much more intimidating than in the moments when he was standing before her. She guessed it was probably because of the uncomfortable feeling and sometimes even fear of being stalked, especially in the dark of the night. The house she was looking for looked humble comparing to the one that Oswalt family had. This one had just one floor, but the roof was rather high, indicating the existence of a spacious attic. The yard had no fence, just surrounded by beautifully cut high bushes. All in all, the place looked well-groomed. Like all other buildings around, this house was dark and peaceful. Lena was pondering about how to get inside without making a sound when Bughuul's voice echoed in her head again. \"Go to the back yard, there is a window to the living room open. You can get inside through it. The attic hatch is in the ceiling of the main hallway, I'll open it as well.\" So he opened the window for her? Lena wondered how he managed to do that. With telekinesis? Most likely, as she highly doubted that people would leave the windows open before going to bed, especially if their house had only one floor. But, thanks to that, at least she can get in. Now she just had to be careful not to make noise. Just like Bughuul said, the hatch to the attic was open and the ladder was pulled out. At least Lena didn't have to open things herself, otherwise she was sure she would wake up all the inhabitants of this place. It seems that Bughuul somehow knew that she was rather clumsy when it came to climbing somewhere higher, so he took care of technical parts. \"Very kind of him,\" Lena thought with a bit of sarcasm. But, on the other side, that is actually huge help from his side, and for that she was grateful to him. Lena put the box into the corner near some other things that were stored there, although she couldn't see what exactly it was as it was pitch dark everywhere, and she didn't dare to use flashlight, afraid of being spotted. But in any case, the box was left in a visible place, so the owners wouldn't miss it. Just when the woman was ready to climb down, Bughuul appeared before her again. \"All right, for now your job is finished, you can leave. But remember, this is not the last assignment.\" Of course, of course… How could she even hope that he would leave her alone once and for all? It was foolish to think that. \"Ok, so much I suspected,\" Lena huffed quietly. \"By the way, how can you know for sure that the owners are going to watch those tapes in the box? That they won't throw it all into the rubbish bin like some old junk?\" \"They won't, you can be sure of that,\" the demon replied. \"No one has ever resisted the temptation to start watching them one by one.\" \"So it means you affect them in some way, like force them to watch, but all looks like they do it willingly?\" \"You can say so. Now go, leave this house. I will change things like they were before your arrival. See you around.\" Lena had no other choice than to make this place a memory, so she climbed down the ladder quietly and then slid out into the yard. The clock now showed fifteen minutes to four, so she had to hurry and reach home until dawn. On her way she giggled about the thought of shock on deputy's face if he found out that this certain someone that is behind the family murders, has literally recruited her to be his helper and that this someone is not even human. But the other part of her shivered from it all. Deputy was doing his best to help her, but she… But… never mind. He would never know a thing anyway. And as long as no one suspected her, Lena was safe. Luckily, she reached home without any occurrences. It was slowly beginning to dawn, so Lena was pondering about whether she should still go to sleep or not. She wasn't even sleepy anymore, so trying to sleep now would be a torture. She didn't know what to do now, but one thing she was sure about – when Bughuul lets her know about himself again, it will happen already after the tragedy. Lena could only guess whom he chose to take this time, but she would definitely find it out later or soon. Time will show.[Chapter 5] The Assignment Of a Demon Chapter 5 For a few days there was no sign of Bughuul. Lena didn't know what exactly he was up to, but she remembered him mentioning about a new family he found, so he could start his deadly ritual once again. It was interesting to know whom he had chosen this time, of those four people that lived in the house Lena was sent to a few nights before. In any case, all she had to do was waiting for any occurrences. She only hoped that Bughuul won't wake her up again in the middle of the night. That is not a nice feeling when you get disturbed while resting peacefully, at least on workdays when you know you have to get up early for work. Luckily, she heard nothing from him until the weekend. Lena thought she could sleep longer on Saturday morning, but her hopes were broken like a piece of fragile glass. She nearly jumped of sudden noise of her cell phone calling. It was her habit to put it on the nightstand at the bed as she usually put the alarm clock in her phone. She stretched her hand to the phone lazily to check who it was, and what a surprise it was when she saw it was the deputy calling. Lena huffed in irritation, as the clock showed nearly fifteen minutes after eight. At the first moment a sting of fear pierced her body through, as she thought that he or anyone else among the police found out about her \"night walks\". Great, just freaking perfect, - Lena thought angrily. - Even on the weekend I cannot sleep as long as I want. If not Bughuul robbed her of her sleep, then someone else would do that. But she decided to answer the call anyway. Maybe it was indeed something important. \"Hello?\" she said in a sleepy voice. \"Hello, Ms. Firth? I'm sorry to wake you up this early,\" deputy's voice answered on the other end of the line. \"But there is something you would definitely want to know. Looks like I found some information about your strange pursuer.\" So they found out about Bughuul? Now this already raised Lena's interest. She was sure there is nothing new he would tell her, but she was curious about how exactly he managed to find it out. She had to do her best to pretend that she knew nothing about it. \"Oh? Really?\" Lena tried to sound interested. \"Did you find out who he is?\" \"Yes, I did. And I…\"deputy stammered, but continued nonetheless. \"I don't want to scare you, Ms. Firth, but… I'm afraid the strange figure that stalks you… It's not even human.\" \"What? Are you sure?\" Lena tried to sound frightened now. She was thankful for having a true talent in pretending and imitating sounds and people. This is something she was good at. \"I wish I was wrong, but, unfortunately, we are dealing with something… supernatural. And this thing is apparently of a malevolent nature. Ms. Firth, I actually have something to show you.\" \"Really? What exactly?\" \"First, there are some new pictures that might interest you,\" deputy explained. \"Second, I obtained a recording that contains historical information of this entity that we are dealing with. And most important, now it's absolutely clear that this thing is responsible for each family murder, at least from the sixties, starting with the family that was drowned in a swimming pool. But I'm pretty sure that this crime is far from being the first one.\" Well, this indeed might be something new that Lena had probably no idea about. She knew only the basic things about Bughuul, but now some details might provide some interest. \"All right, deputy, thank you for the news,\" Lena said. \"I think it would be good for us to meet again at my place. This already sounds interesting. Besides, if we know what exactly we are dealing with, maybe we could also find a way to fight it. If you have time, feel free to come here with all the information you got. Today I'm free all day, tomorrow as well. Just call and warn me where you are planning to arrive, alright?\" \"Of course, that will do,\" deputy agreed. \"I think I might visit you today closer to the evening. I'll call you again later to tell the exact time. So for now, goodbye.\" \"Goodbye, and thank you once again.\" 0o0o0o0o0o0o0o0o0o Time passed rather fast, and Lena couldn't wait to know what the deputy managed to find out. Despite knowing the demon personally, there might be something still obscure about him. She knew his name and that he devours the souls of the children to survive, plus that he exists for thousands of years. And, of course, that he's the one who forces the kids to kill their entire families before kidnapping them to his dimension. But that was it. Just the basic stuff, and no more. Bughuul ordered her to do what she is told without asking questions that he found unnecessary, so now deputy might shed some light on the things unknown. Around twelve he called again and informed that he was planning to visit her at five, so Lena had time to walk to the nearest grocery store and buy some baked stuff for tea. Last time she was so frightened that she couldn't think of anything else, but now the situation was different. She felt more relaxed. At least no shocking surprises awaited her, or so it seemed. Around five o'clock the sound of a doorbell rang throughout the house and Lena hurried to the door. Deputy was standing in the doorway with a strange, obviously old device in his hands. \"Hello, deputy. Please, do come in,\" Lena kindly invited him inside. \"Proceed to the kitchen, just like the last time. This time there is not just empty tea, I've purchased brownies. You know, I was too overwhelmed with fear last time, so my mind was filled just with that.\" \"Oh, thank you very much, but… you shouldn't have,\" deputy smiled, putting the old device on the edge of the table and a folder near it. \"Why not? You are my guest after all, so I couldn't do otherwise,\" the woman smiled back. \"Um… so… may I ask what is this thing that you brought with you?\" \"Yes, of course. This is a record player. As I said, there is a recording that explains things about the certain supernatural entity,\" deputy explained, opening his folder. \"But before we get to that, there are some pictures that I would like you to take a look at.\" He pulled out a few images with some strange, apparently ancient, drawings, but each of them depicted a death scene of a group of people. And every drawing featured the familiar symbol that she saw in the photos that deputy showed her earlier. \"So… what exactly am I looking at?\" Lena asked, studying the pictures curiously. \"These are the copies of ancient engravings,\" deputy explained. \"Maybe you remember from our last talk that I mentioned about advising Mr. Oswalt to call the University and contact professor Jonas, the occult crime expert?\" \"Yes, I remember that. And? What then?\" \"Well, the first thing is that professor Jonas has mysteriously vanished without a trace two days ago. We found this recorder and the images among his documents and other belongings.\" \"What? How?\" Lena began blinking fast. Deputy sighed and continued: \"To be honest, I don't know what to tell you at the moment. We began searching for him, but it will take a while. And I believe that his disappearance has something to do with that entity. I don't claim it yet for sure, but those are my suspicions.\" \"It could be,\" Lena nodded in agreement. And when that creepy bastard appears again, he will answer a few questions, - she thought to herself, scratching her chin. \"All right, now it's time for the most important part,\" deputy turned his attention to the recorder. \"Now we are going to listen to the entry, recorded by professor Jonas a day before his disappearance. I'm sure it will clear up the picture about your mysterious stalker.\" He switched the device on and in a few seconds the recording started. \" This is professor Andrew Jonas, entry recorded on August 27 th , 2012. I've received the sad news about the tragic death of Mr. Ellison Oswalt and his family, which happened a short time after I contacted him via Skype. Mr. Oswalt called for my help to provide information about the background of the mass murders of families. I got a few images from him, containing a symbol, the meaning of which he wanted to know, as it appeared in the murder scenes. It's a symbol associated with the worship of a pagan deity. A very obscure one, dating back to Babylonian times, a deity named Bughuul, the Eater of Children. The crimes that Mr. Oswalt was dealing with, they all had the element of a missing child. Well, Bughuul eats children. Now, the fragments of stories that have survived, they all revolve around him needing the souls of human children to survive. Now each story involves a different way that he lures or tricks these children away from the physical world and traps them in his own netherworld, and he consumes their souls over time. Now any worship of this deity would include a blood sacrifice or the wholesale eating of a child. In these particular crime scenes that Mr. Oswalt was investigating, there was nothing of the things just mentioned, meaning blood sacrifice or the eating of a child. It is more like a cult initiation. And before my last contact with Mr. Oswalt, I sent him a few images per e-mail, containing the ancient engravings, connected to Bughuul. These images were the only ones that survived throughout the history, as everything else had been destroyed because of the superstitions. Early Christians believed that Bughuul lived in the images themselves, and each person that stumbled upon them had large risk to become possessed. The children that saw the images, were especially vulnerable to Bughuul's possession. If a person gets possessed, he or she falls under a total control of Bughuul, and is forced to commit terrible things. This is what occurred during each crime, connected to Bughuul. Each missing child had apparently got under Bughuul's possession and was forced to murder their entire family, and afterwards they disappeared. As I've mentioned earlier, Bughuul takes them away from the physical world and traps them in his own netherworld. Sadly, I have to admit that this is exactly what we are dealing with in each of these cases, including Mr. Oswalt's case. The contact with him ended before I managed to answer his question, concerning the images serving as a portal for Bughuul to the world of the living. He asked me if it is possible to close the portal by destroying the images. Unfortunately, he didn't get his answer, but now, in this entry, I claim the following: it is possible. If everything connected to Bughuul is destroyed before getting in close contact with it, whether those are images, recordings, etc., it is possible to deny him the entrance to our world. But if you try to do it after you have managed to take a good look at the images or anything else and study it, then it is no use. The connection has been established and Bughuul won't stop until he completes his plans.\" This is where the recording ended. Lena sat in silence for a few moments, digesting all the information she had just heard. Deputy switched the recorder off and also stayed quiet, looking at the woman sitting across him. \"Alright…\" Lena finally spoke after a deep sigh. \"Now it's all clear. This Bughuul is following me for some unknown reason. I can only wonder what the hell he wants from me. I'm alone, I have no children, so I actually have nothing to offer him. But nonetheless, he apparently has some interest in me.\" \"It seems so,\" deputy agreed. \"But judging by what the professor said, looks like my future perspective is death. I've studied all the images, helped Mr. Oswalt with the investigation. I guess I have already gone too far as well. Now it's just a matter of time. And…\" he closed his face with his palms, supporting himself with elbows. \"…I beg your forgiveness. I have drawn you in all this crap by showing you the images.\" Hearing this, Lena shook her head frantically. \"Oh, no, please, don't say so. You're not to blame in this situation. This entity, Bughuul, started following me days before I met you. So it's not your fault, one way or another.\" And yes, to Lena it already didn't matter if he showed her the images or not. She has encountered Bughuul personally and became his helper, whether she wanted it or not. She only hoped that deputy wouldn't suffer from the demon's intrigues. \"Ah, yes, you're right,\" deputy smiled, admitting his own mistake. \"By the way, have you seen him since we met last time?\" Lena understood in grief that she was forced to lie and gave a negative answer. She knew what the consequences would be if she told him the truth. It would end tragically not just for her, but for the deputy as well. \"Good to know you're fine so far,\" he said. \"But our deal is still valid. If you notice him or anything weird, let me know at once, alright?\" \"Yes, of course,\" Lena nodded in response. \"And I would like to thank you for all the information, deputy. Believe or not, it's always easier to act when you know exactly what you are against, whatever it is.\" \"I can agree with that,\" deputy replied. \"It's much worse when you don't know what you're dealing with. The most frightening thing possible is the unknown.\" \"Right you are.\" Finishing his tea, deputy packed the images back into the folder and unplugged the recorder. \"Well, Ms. Firth, I guess it's time for me to go. I hope the information you heard today was useful to you. Don't hesitate to contact me if anything happens. If I find out any news, I'll give you a call.\" He put the folder on the recorder and picked it up, moving to the front door. \"Sure, I will if I face any strange things,\" Lena replied. \"Thank you very much for your help. I really appreciate it. Oh, by the way, do you need any help with carrying things? Is the recorder heavy?\" \"Oh, no, not at all,\" deputy smiled. \"I can carry it myself. And you're welcome. I'm glad to help. Good night, Ms. Firth.\" \"Good night, deputy,\" Lena said and closed the door after him, locking it for the night. She stepped back into the kitchen and washed the dishes, while thinking over all the things she found out about. Something was already familiar to her, but some details were new, like those images that served as some kind of a portal for Bughuul to the human world. And she was indeed curious about what could have happened to professor Jonas. Has Bughuul done something to him? Most likely, otherwise why would he suddenly disappear without a single trace? There was definitely something strange going on, and Lena knew that soon she will find it out. Very soon.[Chapter 6] The Assignment Of a Demon Chapter 6 Sunday passed without any particular occasions, and Lena could take a walk around the town peacefully, without even looking behind her every five minutes. She noticed a police officer patrolling the area not far from her home, but generally all seemed safe. Even at night no one disturbed her, and she was more than happy about it. The next day she went to work to the grocery store, as usual, and nothing seemed out of ordinary. But around the afternoon time she decided to switch on a small TV set in her office, just to hear the news. But what she saw and heard made the blood in her veins turn cold. The TV screen showed a female reporter standing in front of a familiar house. Lena recognized it at once – it was the same house on Floyd Street that she was sent to by Bughuul some days ago. And on both sides of the woman several police cars were visible. It has finally happened, - Lena thought to herself and turned the volume up a bit so she could hear every detail. \" Yesterday, on Sunday 23 rd , a family of three people was brutally murdered in their own house on 12 Floyd Street. Brian Hayes, 45, his wife, Mary, 40, and their daughter, eleven-year old Claire, were killed with gun shots into their heads, and their son, twelve-year old Daniel, is nowhere to be found. Parents and their daughter were found on the floor in the living room, tied with ropes and with a bullet in their foreheads. Looks like the Beretta M9 .22 LR handgun was used as a murder weapon. It's said that this case eerily reminds of several family murders that happened before, which include the elimination of a whole family and the disappearance of one of their child. Police is conducting the investigation, but no more details are yet known.\" Lena switched off the TV set and turned away from it. So this demonic creep claimed another victim. This time he forced a twelve-year old boy to shoot his family with a handgun before taking him away. She wondered what Bughuul was up to now. Will he make her fetch the \"Home movies\" box again from the crime scene at night? Or does he have any other plans for her? Lena had no idea what to think now. All she knew that at this moment she needed to talk to deputy about this case. So she pulled out the cell phone from the pocket of her jacket and dialled his number. \"Hello?\" a male voice answered. \"Hello, deputy? It's Lena Firth speaking.\" \"Oh, Ms. Firth? Glad to hear you,\" deputy really seemed glad to hear her, judging by his voice. \"Is everything alright?\" \"Yeah, I'm ok,\" Lena said. \"But… I've just heard the news on TV… Another family has been murdered, right?\" \"Yes, unfortunately,\" deputy sighed sadly. \"It was totally unexpected, but it seems that this creep did it again. By the way, how are things going by you? Any occurrences?\" \"No, from my side nothing,\" Lena replied. \"Although it's kinda strange. He seemed to be following me at first, but then he decided to switch for someone else.\" \"Yeah, I noticed that. But I haven't got a single doubt that he's behind the murder again. Just like with the Stevensons, just like with the Oswalts. And now the Hayes family have suffered the same fate.\" Deputy coughed and continued: \"And the worst thing is that if I try to explain it to my colleagues or the sheriff, they won't buy the story for sure. I will be laughed at. They would say they need just facts, and not some myths and legends.\" \"Understandable. No one would believe in all this otherworldly stuff unless they face it themselves. Moreover, as I see, this Bughuul attacks totally unexpectedly. I mean, you can never know who and when will fall victim to him. Am I right?\" \"Yes, you are,\" deputy agreed. \"Only Mr. Oswalt was the first one to begin complaining about some weird stuff in his house, but he moved to a crime scene on purpose, you know. He knew about the Stevensons, and he also discovered that these crimes were connected to occultism. But before him no one had any complaints about anything strange. At least, not to my knowledge.\" \"I see. Alright, deputy, I'm not going to distract you from your duties, and I have to get back to work too,\" Lena said. \"When I heard about the new case, I just… I felt I had to talk to you about it. Now I feel better.\" \"But of course, anytime,\" deputy replied. \"Have a nice day.\" \"Thanks, same to you,\" Lena smiled, more to herself, and hanged the phone. On the one hand, Lena felt a bit relieved after she talked to the deputy. But on the other hand, her own conscience didn't give her full peace of mind. The demon destroyed another family and claimed another child victim, and she knew about his plans. She could have warned the deputy and thus prevent the new crime, but she couldn't do that. Bughuul held her like in some kind of iron shackles, and she did not dare to disobey. He has gained power over her, and she could do nothing about it. But Lena was sure that she was also partially responsible for this particular crime, but not at her own will, of course. Returning home, she did the usual routine as always before going to bed, like having supper and taking a shower. Often she liked to watch some interesting film before going to bed, but this time she had no mood for that. Some inner voice whispered to her that exactly this evening something was going to happen, but what? Lena had no idea, but in the same moment when she finished washing the dishes, she heard a strange sound, like fast clicking of some sort. The young woman listened carefully and realized that it was coming from upstairs. Lena slowly went upstairs, trying to understand where exactly the sound was coming from, and the closer she approached to her bedroom, the louder the sound became. It meant that somebody of something was in her room. But how was that possible if all the windows and doors were locked from the inside? Then in suddenly dawned on her: no one else was capable of such things but one being. Bughuul. So he decided to let her know about himself now, just as Lena expected – after another deadly ritual of his. She opened a door a bit and noticed that her room was illuminated by a faint, flickering light. Then she finally opened it wide, and there was the demon himself, standing at her desk, behind the chair that she usually sat in when working with her laptop. And the light was eradiated by a working projector on the desk, the same one from the \"Home movies\" box. \" There you are, Lena,\" the demon said in an obviously satisfied voice. \"Well, hello there,\" she replied. \"It sounds to me you're satisfied with the result of your actions, aren't you?\" \" Oh yes,\" Bughuul laughed. \"So, what's your pleasure this time?\" \" This time… This time, I think it's time for you to get introduced to the whole matter,\" he said. Lena tilted her head in confusion until Bughuul pointed to the chair in front of him. \"Sit down.\" The woman did as she was told and sat down into the chair. Looking on her left, she noticed a few film cases near the projector, and one of them was empty, the one labelled \"Pool Party '66\". From that she deduced that the particular film was inside the projector. Bughuul then pressed one of the buttons on the projector, and the film began. And when that happened, Lena felt both his hands lie on her shoulders. She wondered why he was holding her like that, not like she was going anywhere, but decided to keep quiet. The tape they were watching now was dated as the earliest of the available ones. In it, a friendly family scene was shown, after which the same family was seen, taped onto pool chairs with ropes tied to them. An unseen figure pulled then each family member into the pool until they drowned. In the end, Bughuul could be seen in the water after the whole family was underwater. Right here the tape ended. Lena watched it with her eyes wide from horror and sat in her spot like hypnotized while the demon changed the tapes, putting the next one into the projector. This one had the name \"BBQ '79\", in which the family, after spending good time during barbecue, was seen chained inside their own car, which was parked in their own garage. The unseen figure set the car on fire, and Bughuul could be briefly seen in the picture, which could be spotted by the side of the car. Lena realized that this one was from Sacramento, she remembered the deputy mentioning a family burned in their own garage. And then there was this symbol on the car hood, the one from the photos that she had seen. The next tape carried the name \"Lawn Work '86\" and showed another family, seen in a living room through the window from outside, followed by an episode that showed rainy weather at night, and a lawn mower being pushed by an unseen person is pushed up to a family tied up on the ground being run over by an unseen person, killing them. At this moment, when the mower was pushed on a first person, Lena turned away abruptly, not wanting to see this bloody mess on the screen. But right then she felt Bughuul's hand on her head that turned it back to the screen. \" Did I allow you to turn away?\" he asked with a hint of a snicker in his voice. \"I don't want to see that,\" Lena said, covering her eyes. \"This is disgusting.\" \" Of course, you do, no need to lie to yourself,\" the demon continued, putting the hand back on her right shoulder. \"You are much stronger than that. I know it, and you know it perfectly. Now, where were we?\" While he changed the tapes again, Lena thought things over, realizing that no matter how disgusting these scenes were, the other part of her wanted to see it all, and even was curious about the many ways a human being can be murdered. This is what Bughuul obviously liked about her, and he knew for sure what to choose and why. The tape with a name \"Sleepy Time '98\" depicted the murders of a family in St. Louis. They were seen, strapped down to their beds, and the unseen person slit their throats with a knife. These were the Millers, so much Lena remembered from the deputy's story. This scene was more or less bearable, like the one with the pool or even the burning. The \"Family Hanging Out '11\", in turn, showed the events with the Stevenson family, the ones that were hanged in the back yard. Four members of a family were tied to a tree branch with nooses, but their feet were still on the ground. An unseen figure cut another branch that was supporting the family, which pulled them upward, killing them. And in the background of the last frame, Bughuul could be seen among the bushes in the distance, watching the scene. As deputy had said before, this was the same house where Ellison Oswalt moved in on purpose with his family not knowing about it. His goal was to write a book about the family whose death Lena had just witnessed. But his dream did not come true, and in the result this fatal mistake had cost him dearly. And the result of this mistake was seen in the \"House Painting '12\" tape. In the footage Lena saw Ellison Oswalt himself with his wife and son, lying on the floor in a living room, with their hands and feet tied with a sticky tape, and their mouths taped up as well. But when the family was chopped into pieces, Lena couldn't help but close her eyes. Dismemberment was what she really disliked of all the acts of violence. The movie also included the paintings Ashley made out of her family's blood in the hallway of their home. Although this scene with the walls painted in blood indeed looked terrifying, Lena had to admit that it charmed her with its macabre beauty. And now, the last one. This was obviously the new tape, depicting the murder that happened just yesterday, and it carried a symbolic name, \"Home shooting gallery '12\". This time Lena watched as a man, a woman, and a young girl were sitting on the floor in a row, supporting their backs against the wall, and all three were tied with ropes and had their mouths taped up in a similar manner the Oswalt family had. The film was silent, like the all the rest, but it was clear when each person got shot, like a target in a shooting gallery, as a bloody bullet hole appeared in the forehead of every family member: the first was father, then the mother, and the last was the daughter. And here the footage ended. Lena rubbed her temples, trying to digest all what she had just seen. Bughuul has just showed her how each family died, and all the grisly murders were recorded. But why had the police never found these tapes? \"Is that all?\" she asked in a tired voice. \" Just a little addition,\" Bughuul replied, taking one more tape from an old envelope labelled \"Extended Cuts\". Now Lena finally saw all the truth: the extra tapes revealed that the \"unseen\" individuals were actually the \"missing\" children. In these extended endings, each child came into frame after committing the murder, moved close to the camera and silently held one finger up to their mouth. Lena already wasn't too much surprised by this, as Bughuul had explained to her before, how his \"rituals\" work. She just didn't expect to see it all with her own eyes, let it be just on a tape. She has just watched a series of real snuff films. \"All right, so…\" she sighed finally, turning her head to face the demon standing behind. \"Why did you show me all of this?\" \" As I said before, I wanted to introduce you to the whole matter,\" he explained, not without his sinister laugh. \"What for? And what does it all mean?\" Bughuul put one hand on her left shoulder and walked to stand in front of her. He bent down to look right into Lena's face closely and whispered: \"It means that you will be the one to record the next ritual.\"[Chapter 7] The Assignment Of a Demon Chapter 7 Lena felt like if a bucket of ice cold water was splashed on her. Did he just say he wanted her to film another murder scene? Why? \"Excuse me?\" she asked half-surprised, half-irritated. \"Why do you want me to do that? Isn't it so that the chosen children do the filming?\" \" Yes, it is so,\" the demon replied. \"But now it's time for a change. And I know you can do it, so refusing is not an option. I think there is no need to remind that you are out of choices.\" \"Yeah, yeah, so much I knew…\" Lena huffed. \"Have you already chosen the family?\" \" Not yet. I will let you know when it happens. And believe my word, that will be very soon.\" The woman sighed heavily, but there wasn't much she could do. Disobeying the demon would cause very unpleasant consequences. \"One more question. Do I have to carry the box again to the house where this \"ritual\" of yours is going to take place?\" \" No. As you will be filming this time, you will bring the box with you on the day of the ritual. And you will need only the camera, so the projector and the tapes can stay at your home,\" Bughuul explained to her. \"Till then, keep it safe and hidden in your house. See you around.\" At this moment the demon disappeared. Lena still sat on the chair, trying to digest all that has just happened. First, he made her watch the murder scenes of whole families, including the most recent one. She had to admit that the last killings were the fastest and most painless, comparing to the rest. And now he wanted her to be present at the next killing scene and film it. If it was going to be something similar to the last scene, it would me more or less bearable. But she wasn't sure. All that Lena knew is that Bughuul was definitely preparing her for something. But for what? The demon will not leave her ignorant, that she was sure about. She will get her answer. In time. 0o0o0o0o0o0o Six days passed in peace, no sign of the demon or anything connected to him. Lena couldn't complain about anything in general, but her soul couldn't find peace, considering what she was going to go through. Bughuul could appear any day, any moment, and announce that he made his choice of the next victims. She was prepared for this though. Lena began to realize that Bughuul's appearance at her house was becoming usual, like going to work or having breakfast, not mentioning the absence of fear of him. 0o0o0o0o0o0o One more week, and still nothing. Lena has already begun to wonder about what could have happened. Did it really take him so long to search for the victims or was there something else. She could only presume that he probably wanted to take a break between the murders, for any case. Otherwise it would raise suspicions at once. On the fifteenth day, things changed at last. After her return home from work and having supper, Lena stumbled on the demon again, and once more in her own bedroom. \"Oh, hello again,\" she said, crossing arms on her chest. \"How are things going? I presume you have finally found what you wanted?\" \" Yes, I have,\" Bughuul said. \"Are you ready to go?\" \"I think so,\" the woman replied. \"But where now?\" \" I will lead the way, just like the last time. Now take the box and prepare to leave. Soon is midnight, and then you can go.\" Bughuul vanished again, and Lena slowly began to dress up in her black \"uniform\". She wondered how far he would make her go this time, but no matter where the goal is, she had to be maximally careful. She still hasn't abandoned the thought about police patrol, even at night. After all, no one can be sure of that. Lena waited till midnight, and right after the clock showed twelve, she opened the front door quietly, peeking outside for the signs of any people. For now, the streets seemed deserted. Lena thanked God that there were not many street lanterns in the street she lived on, so it would be easier to hide in the shadows. Holding the \"Home movies\" box with the camera inside, she locked her house and looked around, not knowing where to go. \" The place you have to reach is 10 Harbour Road, by the railways. Everything is ready for you,\" Bughuul's voice suddenly echoed in her head. Harbour Road? Oh yeah, I know where it is, - Lena thought to herself. But what did he mean by saying that everything was ready? She didn't dare to speak out loud, in case if someone might hear her. But it was no problem for Bughuul though, as he could hear her thoughts. Lena carefully moved to the left, trying to stick to the darkness, hiding behind the trees and bushes if necessary. The demon warned her if there were any threats, like somebody stepping out of the house to smoke or a car passing by. She had to hide many times, but safety was the main priority. She reached the chosen house in around thirty minutes, as her own house wasn't located too far from the railways. It was also a relatively small house that had only one floor, and the windows were dark. Lena wondered what she was to do now until suddenly someone grabbed her wrist. Lena felt blood in her veins getting cold, thinking that she might be caught. But when she turned around, there was just a little girl standing beside her and holding her hand. She looked around eleven years old. And while holding Lena's wrist, the girl always stared into the woman's eyes, without saying a single word. \" Don't worry, Lena.\" Bughuul suddenly appeared behind her back. \"She is the chosen one.\" \"Oh…\" Lena sighed in relief. \"Damn, when she grabbed my hand, I thought I'm done for.\" \" Don't worry, no one shall catch you. I will not allow it to happen. Now, she will lead you to the place of the ritual.\" Still holding Lena's hand, the girl led her away from the house, and right to the railways. There a horrible sight opened to her eyes: four people with their mouths taped up, tied to the railway, and all were still alive. Lena knew that this girl has drugged her family and tied them to the railway after she made sure they were unable to resist. The plan was now more than clear – they were going to wait until the train comes, and the unfortunate victims will severed into pieces by it. She shuddered from a single thought about filming this scene. \" Now, take out the camera and switch it on,\" Bughuul commanded. Lena did what he told and then asked quietly: \"But how do you know when the train comes? We can wait like that for hours, especially at night.\" \" The train is going to pass this spot in five minutes. It's a night train.\" the demon explained. \"When I said that everything is ready, I meant it.\" The last words he spoke with a hint of a snicker. This uncertainty of hers entertained him, but it will go away in time. He knew she would become similar to him, and murder scenes will not affect her in any way, shape, or form. But everything comes in its own time. Lena and the girl stood in the shadow where no one could see them. Five minutes have passed, and the sounds of the train were becoming louder with every second. Holding the camera in one hand, the young woman felt the girl squeezing her palm lightly. And right at that moment the train passed by in full speed, cutting the victims into pieces. Lena sighed heavily and sadly when that happened, but, on the other hand, she was surprised that she didn't turn away or the strong feel of disgust didn't take over her. Now all that was left of those unfortunate ones was a bloody mess. Lena continued filming, as Bughuul didn't give the order to stop, and when all was silent again, the girl came out in front of the camera and put her index finger to her mouth, just like the other kids did after murdering their families. And after that Bughuul came into the frame, took the girl into his arms and carried her away into the darkness. For minute or two, Lena just stood in her spot with the camera, not knowing what to do. Finally she decided to switch off the camera, as the \"ritual\" was over, and there was nothing more to film. Before she managed to put the camera back into the box, the demon's voice echoed in her mind again. \" Your work is done for today, Lena, you may go home. Keep the box safely hidden until our next meeting. I'll see you after a while.\" And that was it, no more sounds or any other signs of his or the girl's presence. Lena packed the camera into the box and left the crime spot as fast as she could. Reaching her house without any incidents, the first thing she did was putting the other things from the box back where they belonged and hid them under her bed. Taking a quick shower, Lena went to bed, but couldn't fall asleep for a few hours. No wonder, as the death scene she had witnessed and filmed still stood before her eyes. This is something she would be unable to forget for a while. All Lena could now do is wonder about how many times this merciless demon would make her film the grisly crimes. This sure is one hard mental experience. But she would get used to it later or soon, if she has to repeat this process again and again. After all, Lena just had to hold the camera, and as long as things were bearable, she was alright with that. Unless… Unless one fine day he makes her commit the murder with her own hands.[Chapter 8] The Assignment Of a Demon Chapter 8 Months passed one after another, and the news about new murders came out now and then. Again, each was similar in nature to the previous ones – a family dead and a child missing. And every time the police came to a dead end. No traces of a killer or any clues about who it could be. Of course, deputy had an idea about these crimes, he didn't hesitate to present all the evidence he had, but still there was no solid proof that the crimes were of a supernatural nature. Even the recording left by professor Jonas wasn't strong enough. Sure, it explained a few things, but the things he told about were historical and contained legends and stories about a deity named Bughuul. And the screenshots made by Ellison Oswalt while he watched the cursed tapes didn't manage to convince. The authorities were sure that the stranger seen it the pictures was some guy in a creepy mask, a member of some sect that worshipped this Bughuul. He committed ritualistic murders and kidnapped one child for unknown reasons, sometimes leaving a symbol behind. This was the official version, and no one would accept the version about supernatural forces behind the murders. The investigation should be based on facts instead of legends and rumors. Only one person knew the whole truth. And it was Lena Firth. From the first time when Lena filmed a murder scene, not a single killing passed without her participation as an operator, and after every family death a new tape was added to the \"Home movies\" collection. She still didn't fully understand why Bughuul made her film it all, and he didn't explain anything either. But all has its own purpose, and with each murder scene Lena realized one thing – blood and death didn't affect her anymore. She has become absolutely numb to it. She wondered if that was what the demon actually wanted, to make her treat killing as something ordinary. She wasn't entirely sure though, but meeting Bughuul so many times and working for him helped her guess his motives at least a little bit. And this time he was definitely preparing her for something. Time will show what exactly it is. One evening, when Bughuul appeared in her house again, their discussion made all things clear. \" So, tell me, Lena…\" the demon began, moving the strand of the woman's hair behind her ear. Lena was more than surprised by this gesture, as nothing of that had ever happened between them. This movement of the demon seemed almost… gentle. \"What do you feel when you watch the children taking their families' lives?\" Lena thought for a moment and said: \"Should I be absolutely honest?\" In the next second this question seemed silly to her, as she knew now that Bughuul could hear her thoughts. \"To tell you the truth, I feel… nothing. Not even a single emotion. Looks like I have gotten totally used to seeing people dying the most horrific ways. I highly doubt that something could surprise me.\" \" Very well, I'm glad to know it,\" Bughuul nodded, now touching her face with his fingertips. \"This was exactly what I wanted, that you grow completely indifferent to the death of human beings. You are now ready.\" \"Yeah, so much I guessed already.\" Lena stared at him attentively, not denying that the touch of his cold hand made her feel relaxed. \"So… maybe it's about time you told me the purpose of this all?\" Bughuul tilted his head on the left, then on the right, and his messy black hair swung from side to side. \" Of course, it's time to set things straight. Maybe you have already thought about it, but here it is: the next murder will be yours.\" Lena sighed at the last phrase. \"I guess I had my suspicions, and they turned out to be right.\" She crossed hands on her chest. \"That explains the reason for me to be numb to death. But does it change anything that the killer is not a child?\" \" No. As I usually make the children to do my bidding, it doesn't mean that I cannot make an adult person do it. Children are more vulnerable to my power, and among the adults there was no one that could fit for my task. To be precise – there wasn't, until I found you.\" The woman continued staring at him, and she could swear that if Bughuul had a mouth, he would have definitely grinned at this moment. \"Alright, so… have you already chosen the victims?\" she asked. Bughuul shook his head which meant a negative answer. \" No. This time I decided to give you complete freedom.\" \"What do you mean?\" Lena asked, tilting her head. \" It means that you can choose your victims and the way to kill them.\" 0o0o0o0o0o0o0o That was already becoming interesting. He decided to give her the choice of victims and be creative in killing? Now that's a surprise, at least so Lena thought. \"Wow… that is quite unexpected,\" she grinned. \"I thought you would make a choice, as usual.\" \" With the children it is needed,\" the demon explained. \"They don't know the life, and for them it's all the same. I give the order, and they do what they are told. But you have lived the life, and I'm sure there are people you cannot stand, right?\" Lena began thinking. She needed some time to dig through her own thoughts and memories. Finally she had come up with the result. \"Well, yes, when at University, there were some female course mates that I hated. You see, they were rather popular, especially among the guys, which included also provocative clothing and make-up as a success. I, in turn, was different. On the contrary, I preferred to be known as a \"grey mouse\" than being like them. Not a single day passed without their mocking and insulting jokes. I was so happy when the studies were finally over. Although at the party we had afterwards, all were friendly to each other, but… there is still grudge in my heart. The things they said to me during the time of studies can't be that easily forgotten.\" Lena felt a bit embarrassed while talking about her life to an inhuman being. But, on the other hand, she had no one else to talk to. Only him, Bughuul. \" All right. So you would choose them?\" Bughuul asked. \"Yes, I think so,\" Lena replied. \"I will invite them to my place for a cup of coffee, and then take their lives. Our relationship now is more or less bearable, so there wouldn't be any problem for us to meet. Although the murder must be planned properly, so that all goes smoothly and without fails. I have a hammer in my cellar, but the stakes… it would take time to make them. Plus, I have to make sure that the victims can't fight back.\" \" Don't you worry about that. I will help you to make sure you succeed,\" the demon assured her. \"Yeah, okay… As for the way of killing…\" the woman scratched her head, thinking about the proper way to get rid of her potential victims. \"I often fantasized about murdering them the same way you kill vampires, you know… like driving a stake through the heart. If I had to choose how to kill them, I would do it exactly like that.\" \" No problem, I approve this idea.\" Bughuul said . \"Besides, it would be something new in any case. No child that I have taken has ever killed their family that way.\" During their talk, Lena giggled deep inside her heart. Who could have imagined that one day she would discuss the murdering plans, and her conversation partner would be not a banal serial killer, but a supernatural entity? Normal people would feel frightened and disgusted, but Lena didn't. She already knew that people would call her a murderer and a psychopath, but, on the other hand, nothing has been normal in her life recently. Bughuul has entered her life unexpectedly and turned everything topsy-turvy. Not like she minded now, but at first such idea would seem crazy even to her. \"Listen, I'm going to call them right now,\" Lena suddenly said. \"If you don't mind, stay with me, so you can know when we arrange the meeting.\" \" No problem, I can wait.\" Bughuul agreed. \"I have all the time in the world.\" While Lena spoke on phone, Bughuul watched her, processing his plan in mind. He listened to her speaking and realized how eager her voice was. It seemed like she couldn't wait for the day she takes their lives. And that made him more than happy. It means she was really becoming like him. And very soon she would join him. The demon himself realized he was becoming impatient, but he had to wait. All will come in time. Finally Lena put her phone down and said: \"All right, that's it. We meet next Sunday at five. There will be three women coming. To be honest, I was a bit surprised about how glad she was to hear me again, the one I've just called. Well, better for us, right?\" Saying this, she winked. \" Of course,\" the demon nodded. \"So, here's the deal: on the day before the meeting I will be here and provide you with the all the necessities, so you can complete the ritual without any problems.\" \"It means on Saturday, right?\" \" Yes.\" \"Okay, Mr. Boogie, deal. Saturday it is then.\" Hearing the funny nickname again, Bughuul giggled quietly. \" You can expect me in the evening, as usual. See you around.\" Right then the demon disappeared, leaving her alone. Lena slowly walked around her bedroom, rubbing her hands and grinning evilly…[Chapter 9] The Assignment of a Demon Chapter 9 Time till the weekend seemed like an eternity to Lena, but she had to be patient, there was no other way. Patience is always bliss, so much she knew. And on Saturday evening, Bughuul appeared in her house again, as promised. But this time he brought something with him. \" Here, this will help you to rob your victims of all the ability to resist,\" he explained, putting a small bottle of some strange liquid on the table. The liquid had a suspiciously bright green color, it could be called phosphoric. Lena had never seen anything like that before. It looked like some glow stick liquid, but this was something much more serious than that. \"Oh, so that's how the chosen children drugged their families before killing them,\" Lena said, studying the peculiar bottle. \"And how soon does it work? I mean, how long do you have to wait until the victims are drugged?\" \" Yes, exactly,\" Bughuul replied. \"The effect of the drug is fast. Even if you add just several drops, the victim falls unconscious in ten minutes, even less. This is a very strong stuff, keep it in mind. It affects the human organism very fast. The more you add, the faster your victim loses consciousness.\" \"Okay, good, I'll remember that.\" \" And here are the stakes and the hammer,\" he said, putting several metallic stakes and a large hammer on the table near the bottle of drug. \"The one you use to drive nails into the wall will not do. You would need a larger and stronger hammer to pierce a human body with a stake.\" Lena lifted the hammer to see closer, but it did seem rather heavy. The stakes weren't that light as well. \"Damn, heavy stuff,\" she said, shaking her head and puffing air out. \" Yes, and for a reason. Remember that this stuff is going to be used on human bodies.\" \"I know. I just wonder if I'm strong enough to succeed. That will not be easy.\" \" No worries. Just like with the chosen children, I will control your actions, and you will be as strong as you have never been in your life.\" That made sense. Lena could never understand how small children could kill adult people so easily, especially in Stephanie's case. Now this got clear. \"I see,\" the woman said, putting things down. \"So, what else do I need… I think I would need to tie them up with something while they are unconscious, and tape their mouths up. I keep the tape in my cellar, so it will come in handy for sure.\" \" All right. And don't forget to prepare the camera before killing,\" Bughuul reminded her, as this was also an important part of the ritual, although Lena still couldn't fully comprehend the point of that. \"I will be watching you during your meeting. You won't see me, but just for you to know that I will be there. See you tomorrow then.\" \"Yeah, see you,\" Lena replied, and the demon vanished. All she had to do now was hide all the things well and wait for tomorrow… 0o0o0o0o0o0o0o The next day was crucial for Lena. Today she had to commit a murder with her own hands. She still doubted whether all would go smoothly, but if Bughuul is near at that moment, there shouldn't be problems. But one thing still occupied her mind. What would deputy say? How would he react when he finds out about all that happened? She was sure that after the murder, Bughuul will take her away to his netherworld, just like he did with all the chosen ones. He had never left anyone in this world, not a single time. And her case would not be exceptional. But, remembering all what deputy did for her, all the help he provided, she felt guilty in front of him. So Lena took a small piece of paper and quickly scribbled something on it, in hope that if deputy tries to look for her, he finds the note she was going to leave for him. Putting the bottle with the green drug into her jacket pocket, Lena began to prepare the coffee. She has bought the cake on Saturday, so they wouldn't drink empty coffee, and now she took it out of the fridge and put on the table, cutting in into several pieces and not forgetting to arrange the plates on the table. As it was autumn, it got dark pretty early, so she drew the curtains shut in all the house. It was what she always did, as she hated when it was visible from the outside what she was doing inside the house. Thus she provided herself full privacy. While there was still time till five, she poured some green liquid into each cup, except for her own, and poured some teaspoon of coffee into each, making sure the deadly drug was fully covered by coffee. Then she hid the bottle in one of the cupboards, hiding it well behind many tins and boxes. No one must suspect anything, and as Lena was very good at pretending, all should go as planned. Lena switched on the kettle to warm the water when suddenly silence was broken by the sound of a doorbell. She rushed to the door to open it, and there they were, standing in the doorway – Helen, Beth, and Lizzie, her ex-course mates and some time ago – the enemies. \"Oh God, Lena! It has been a while! Glad to meet you again!\" Beth exclaimed. The other two greeted her the similar way. \"Yeah, long time no see,\" Lena smiled back, giving each of them a hug. \"Glad to see you too. Please, do come in.\" All three women walked into the house and hanged their coats in the hallway. Lena invited them into the kitchen, showing a bit of her house on the way. \"You have a nice house,\" Helen said, peeking into the living room. \"And you're lucky to have a place to live in a peaceful area. You know, I used to like noisy places, but now… I guess my taste has undergone a change.\" She laughed at her last words. The water had managed to heat up when Lena and her ex-course mates entered the kitchen. While Beth, Lizzie, and Helen sat at the table, Lena poured hot water into all four cups. Her own cup stood separately from the rest, so she didn't accidentally mix up the cups. While mixing the coffee, Lena was afraid that the green liquid would be very much visible, but, lucky for her, it wasn't. It got perfectly blended with coffee, plus it had absolutely no smell and no taste, so no one would even know that there is some drug mixed in their drink. \"Well, girls, here you are,\" she said, putting a tray with three cups of coffee on the table, adding also sugar and milk separately, in case any of them wanted to add some. Then she took her own cup and joined them at the table. \"Thank you.\" The three women said it almost in unison, and each took her own cup of deliciously smelling hot drink. \"So, Lena, how are you? What do you do for life?\" Lizzie asked. \"I work as a manager in a grocery store,\" Lena replied. \"I wouldn't call it fun, as every day it's the same, but the job itself is fine, and the salary is absolutely satisfying. It's enough for me to pay all the bills and just live my life.\" \"I see. And you're still alone, as I presume?\" This question was asked by Helen. \"Yes, I'm single, and I'm absolutely fine with that,\" Lena told her. \"I feel I do not need to have anyone now. At least I'm free and can go wherever and whenever I want and do whatever I want to. So, what about you? How are you three going on with your lives?\" The women continued their talk in a relaxed atmosphere, and nothing foreshadowed any trouble. At least, Lena's visitors were relaxed and peaceful, drinking coffee without hurry. Lena herself also seemed like that, but deep inside she was hiding a grisly secret. They had no idea about what she had prepared for them. And only Lena knew that they were being watched. Bughuul was hiding in the darkness and watching his apprentice's every move. He admired Lena's ability to pretend and behave so like nothing out of ordinary was going on. Lena's guests finished the coffee, and she was patiently waiting for the drug's effect to begin. Until… \"Damn, I feel kinda strange,\" Beth said, putting a hand on her forehead. \"Me too,\" Lizzie added, shaking her head, but it didn't do any good. \"Shit! What's going on?\" Helen exclaimed, trying to stand up, but couldn't, as her vision blurred with every second. All three women had their mouths oozing with foam. Lena stood up, watching the scene nervously and patiently waiting until they finally faint. Maybe any of them managed to realize that she drugged them, or maybe not, but Lena didn't care anymore. In the next moment all three of her visitors were lying on the floor unconscious. \"Well, so far, so good,\" Lena whispered to herself. Now she had to tie them up somehow so they cannot move their hands and legs. She ran upstairs and pulled the \"Home movies\" box and a hammer with stakes from underneath her bed and carried it all down to the living room. Then she took the sticky tape from the box and began working. The tape was large enough to get their wrists and ankles tied together firmly, and the last step was taping their mouths up. Lena tied their wrists in front, so she could put the bodies on their backs, and then it would be convenient to pierce their hearts with stakes. When she finished with that, she pulled each body into the living room and put them in a row. While she stood up, staring at them, they really looked like vampires to her. And she was now ready to kill those vampires. Before beginning the ritual, Lena returned to the kitchen once again. First of all, she pulled a piece of paper out of her pocket and left it on the table. And while searched the cupboard from the drug bottle, she suddenly heard a sound from the living room and saw light flickering. Taking the bottle, she ran back and saw the projector working and Bughuul standing near it. When Lena looked to the screen, she saw a long, creepy corridor in it that seemingly had no end. She already knew that it was the portal to Bughuul's netherworld. \" Good job so far,\" he said. \"Ready for the main part?\" \"Yes, I'm ready,\" Lena replied. \" All right. Now prepare the camera before starting the ritual.\" Lena took the camera and turned it on, checking if it worked properly. Then she walked to Helen that was very slowly gaining consciousness, and spoke, not caring if she heard her well or not: \"You humiliated me when we were course mates. Such things can't be easily forgotten. You shouldn't have done that.\" Although Helen was barely conscious, she could open her eyes a bit. She could see Lena's face close to hers, and Lena's glance seemed lifeless to her. It looked like Lena was under some hypnosis. Helen realized that Lena drugged them all already before fainting, but she could do nothing about it. And now she was unable to move at all, like if her whole body was paralyzed. Lena placed the camera on the fireplace, stabilizing it with the items nearby. Then she took the hammer and the first stake and walked to Helen who was the first lying on her way. Placing the sharp end of the stake right above Helen's heart, she hesitated. \" Do it!\" the demon's voice rang in her head. Lena understood that now it was too late to turn back, so she lifted the heavy hammer and delivered the first blow. Helen twitched and wriggled from pain, but couldn't scream with her mouth taped up. As Lena continued driving the stake into her, she realized that she was feeling much stronger than before. She was conscious of everything, but couldn't control her own body, like it obeyed someone else's commands. And she knew, of course, whose commands it obeyed. Bughuul was still standing at the projector and watching her actions. She was now totally under his control, so the demon knew she would not fail. When Helen was finally dead, Lena left the first stake in her heart and went for the next one. The second victim in the line was Lizzie. The process went easier with her, as she didn't even manage to awake, so Lena doubted that Lizzie even felt anything. And the last to die was Beth who also lay unconscious. Lena repeated the same process with her, and after all three female bodies had stakes in their hearts, she put the hammer aside and stood up. Despite being under Bughuul's control, she still retained her own mind, and Lena felt no remorse whatsoever, mostly thanks to all the experience that the demon made her go through before. The three vampires were dead, and Bughuul's deadly ritual was complete once again. This case was an exception though, as the chosen one was an adult person. Finishing her bloody doings, the woman walked in front of the camera and put her index finger to her lips, which was also a part of the ritual, the final step. She then turned her head to the demon and made a few steps towards him. Bughuul, in turn, walked to her until both were standing close and facing each other. \" Well done, Lena, my faithful apprentice,\" he said, caressing her hair and face with his fingertips. \"I'm very proud of you.\" Then he stood beside her on the left and put his arm or her shoulder, thus hugging her. \"And now… let's go.\" Saying this, the demon slowly led Lena through the portal into his netherworld. It could be seen in the projector's screen how both walked away into the corridor. Only their backs were visible, and only Bughuul knew and saw that the farther they went from the portal, the woman's face was losing the color until it grew deathly pale and became greyish, just like his own face. At the moment she stepped through the portal, she lost her humanity and became a ghost, now a true proxy of an ancient demon. And when they disappeared in the end of the corridor, the projector switched off by itself, closing the portal. And that was the end. Lena Firth has left the world of the living. Forever.[Chapter 10] The Assignment Of a Demon Epilogue In a few days after Lena's disappearance, the police had new matter of investigation. It all began with the statement of vanishing of three women – Beth Hayes, Helen Carter, and Elizabeth Phillips. Mr. and Mrs. Hayes, Beth's parents, reported that their daughter and her two friend were invited by their ex-course mate, Lena Firth, to her house for a cup of coffee. And after that there was no sign of any of them. Sheriff gave an order to go to Lena Firth's house and interrogate her, as she was most likely the last one to see any of the women. Deputy and a few more police officers joined him, but deep inside deputy felt that something was not right with Lena herself as well. Was she alright? Or that demon finally got to her and got rid of her acquaintances too? In any case, they had to find out the truth. Seeing a house surrounded with police cars, a crowd of onlookers began to gather around. Sheriff tried the door, but it was firmly locked. Deputy had tried to call Lena many times, but always got no answer. Her phone seemed to be turned off. That made him get seriously worried. The police first asked the neighbors if anyone had seen Lena Firth or someone else entering her house. One neighbor stated that yesterday evening the light was on in Lena's house, and around five o'clock, he saw three women entering the house. But that was it. Afterwards he saw no one else leaving the place. Police had to be sure, so they finally decided to break the lock and finally got inside. The house was empty and silent, and as deputy shouted out Lena's name, it was useless. It looked like nobody was home. Sheriff ordered to split up and search all the house. He went for the living room while deputy checked the kitchen, and the two other officers went upstairs. The kitchen was empty, nothing out of order, but then a piece of paper on the table caught deputy's attention. Picking it up, he saw that it was a note from Lena, and it was addressed to him. He was going to read it, until… \"Jesus Christ! Oh, my God!\" It was the sheriff's voice from the living room. Deputy put the note into his pocket and rushed to the living room to see what the problem was. But when he saw what sheriff was looking at, he couldn't help but turn away from the horrible sight. There, in the middle of the room, three dead women were lying on the floor in a row, their wrists and ankles tied together and mouths taped up. But that was not all. Each woman had some metallic thing pierced right through the heart. Generally, all this scene looked like some twisted vampire killing scene. \"Oh, God… Who could have done that?\" deputy was in shock. \"I don't know. But it looks like we found the three missing women,\" sheriff said. \"Now we need to find the owner of this house. I bet she committed these murders. The bodies are in her house, so no one else could be blamed for that.\" \"Yeah… I guess you're right,\" deputy agreed with sorrow in his heart. \"I'll call the paramedics then. The bodies should be delivered to the morgue.\" While deputy called the hospital, the officers came downstairs, stating that they found nothing out of ordinary on the upper floor. And still no sign of Lena Firth anywhere. \"Well, it seems that the criminal has escaped,\" sheriff sighed. \"The criminal? What do you mean, sheriff?\" one of the officers asked. \"Take a look yourselves,\" he replied, inviting them into the living room. \"Damn it! Jesus…\" both officers were beyond shocked. \"Do you think the owner of this house did it, sheriff?\" \"To tell you the truth, I'm more than sure of that. The fact that we found the bodies in her house, is the number one evidence of her guilt. Now, let's examine the bodies closer and the room as well while the paramedics are not here yet. And I'm afraid it will take hell a lot of time to search for Lena Firth. She could be anywhere at this moment.\" No other traces were found in the house beside the bodies. When the paramedics delivered them to the morgue, the coroner stated in his report that all three victims were drugged by something, but no one could understand what exactly it was. It was some kind of substance, unknown to the science. All that could be identified that this drug paralyzed the muscles of the body, thus making the victims absolutely helpless in the hands of a killer. As for the drug itself… that was the main problem. No matter how much research was done, no one could find any chemicals that could be even remotely close to the composition of this mysterious drug. Once again, the investigation has come to a dead end. 0o0o0o0o0o0o0o At his home in the evening, deputy was having tea, unable to find peace of mind. With pain and sorrow he clutched a piece of paper in his hand. It was the note that Lena had left for him in the kitchen, and after he read it, the whole picture was finally clear to him. And the note said the following: \" Dear deputy, I'm leaving this note in hope that one day you will find it. All I want to say is I'm sorry. I'm truly sorry. Consider this note as a gratitude for all that you did for me, as the feeling of guilt before you was overwhelming me in my last moments in this world. You see, the recent murders of the families and the missing children… I knew all about them, as I was forced to be a witness. What's more, I had to film them all, except for the one on Floyd Street. This demon, Bughuul, had literally recruited me as his helper. This is why he was following me. He already had his plans for me. And he held me under his control, that's why I was forced to keep silent and tell nothing to the police. If I dared to disobey the demon, my punishment would have been very severe. And the last case with the three ex-course mates of mine… Yes, I killed them, I'm not going to deny it. The thing is that Bughuul was preparing me for that, making me witness the death scenes, so I would grow numb to blood and death and would feel nothing. I already knew what awaits me, I knew he would take me away into his netherworld after I complete his deadly ritual. Don't try to go looking for me, as it's futile. In the moment you are reading this note, I am in the place where no living human being can get to. And I ask only one thing: please, forgive me, if you can. I know I have done terrible things, but I really had no choice. I only hope that you would never experience anything of the kind that I was forced to go through. Once again, I'm very sorry and I beg for your forgiveness. Sincerely, Lena Firth\" Deputy put the paper down, feeling his eyes getting filled with tears. So this is what that unholy bastard was after. He turned her into a merciless murderer and then took away. Tomorrow he will show this note to the sheriff, hoping that at least this would make him believe that the supernatural force is behind all these crimes. If only they could find a way to stop the demon… but this mission was close to impossible. But still deputy didn't lose hope. The must be a way. And he would do all he can to achieve his goal and also take revenge for what the demon did to Lena. He hid the note back into his pocket and left the kitchen after finishing tea. Deputy lived alone in his house, but little did he know that he wasn't alone now. Despite that the heating was on, it was freezing cold in the house, which surprised him. He had no idea that while he was busy with his household care, a woman was following his every step, turning her ghostly pale face towards him and accompanying him with her lifeless gaze. Only the coldness could be a hint that something strange was happening in the house. Switching all the lights off in the living room, the kitchen, and the hallway, deputy was on his way to bedroom, when suddenly silence was broken by some kind of strange noise, like something had been moved. Shivers ran down deputy's spine, as he now realized that there was something else with him in the house. He remembered Ellison Oswalt's complains of similar phenomenon, and now he himself was experiencing that. The next moment deputy felt blood in his veins grow cold and his face covering in sweat. There, in the dark, a faint whisper could be heard, and it spoke only one word: \" Deputy…\" ","Summary":" The Assignment Of a Demon Chapter 1 A/N: Story is partially based on my dream. Supernatural. An are"},{"Movie":"Sinister","Title":"Broken Pieces","Author":"AngelicaMyers95","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12007671","Passage":"[Chapter 1] Bughuul glanced at his daughter. She'd grown so much in the past few years and it was happening at a faster pace than it would for a human child. He didn't fear that she'd change, but given what had happened between them recently, he was sure that she'll run away the first chance she gets and he won't be able to stop her. He remembered how much his wife had wanted to have a child even though he didn't want one but he agreed to having one since she was the only one who he'd cared for and he wanted to make her happy in spite of his own feelings towards being a parent. As the years passed, it seemed that his wife wouldn't get her wish, having a miscarriage after miscarriage which Bughuul had blamed himself for. He couldn't do anything but watch his wife suffer, he didn't know what to do anymore. The more time passed, the more he was convinced she'd leave, but she stood by him, despite the misery. There were many moments where she'd seemed too distant and sometimes he'd find her sitting in the attic, holding the clothes she'd made for their unborn children and weeping for her loss. It was something she couldn't bring herself to throw away even though he'd told her to do so, even going so far to get into a fight over it one night. He yelled at her, telling her that keeping what was meant for their unborn children would only bring her more misery and she cursed him for not grieving with her and before he could say anything, she stormed off. He didn't go looking for her, but he'd hoped for her return. He saw no point in going after her thinking that if she was so miserable with him, he should let her go. Hours after their fight, she showed up and apologized for her breakdown but he'd told her that it was his fault and that she shouldn't apologize for anything. He held her, relieved that she'd returned to him, still in fear that she could change her mind and leave out of the blue. Months after the fight, his wife discovered that she was pregnant again which, even though it made her happy, worried her as well thinking that she'd lose this one too. Upon hearing the news from his wife, Bughuul suggested that he should leave, at the very least until she carries her pregnancy out but she'd have none of it, saying that she needs him there and that she doesn't want to go through with it alone. Even though Bughuul stayed, he'd kept his distance from her during the pregnancy, fearing if he'd even do so much as touch her, she'd lose the child. She'd tell him that nothing would happen but he didn't want to risk anything, telling her that it would be better for them to wait for the child to be born. Despite their fears, there seemed to be nothing wrong during the pregnancy. When it came to term the labor lasted almost an entire day, but to her it was all worth the pain. Bughuul was terrified to even hold her, thinking something could happen but his wife assured him that the baby would be fine, so he reluctantly took his baby daughter into his arms. He held her, but the fear of hurting her in some way wasn't going away. Still, looking at her, he was proud to be her father. He never thought that he'd get attached to her but all it took was to look at her and he was captured instantly. He thought of all the things he'd teach her when she got older and it made him happy. In that moment, it seemed like everything was going to be alright...[Chapter 2] As time passed, it seemed that Lilly wasn't what Bughuul had expected her to be at all. She'd remained as innocent as she'd been on the day of her birth. Being almost three years old, Lilly looked twice her age and was no ordinary child. She liked to draw and was exceptionally good at it. She'd learned how to play the piano since she'd been fascinated by it when she was only a few months old. Bughuul first placed her on his lap and played her the lullaby he'd usually play to get her to sleep and she tried to play along with him. Bughuul was more than happy to teach her how to play the piano and was pretty pleased at how skilled she was in the arts at her age, but there was something that was worrying him when it came to her – she didn't like violence. The first time she was exposed to it was while she was outside with her mother when she noticed one of the older boys in the park kicking something. She ran closer to him, to get a better look and saw him mercilessly kicking a dog that had been badly injured beforehand, possibly by the same boy. Lilly loved to play with animals on the rare occasions her mother would take her to the park since she wasn't allowed to socialize with any of the children there, if there were any since her mother made sure to take her out when there were no other children around or when the children around were too old to even bother approaching Lilly. This boy appeared to be ten to twelve years old and was a lot taller than Lilly. Her eyes filled with tears when she first got closer and then she yelled at the boy as she cried to get him to stop. The boy turned to her, looking angry but then put on a slightly sinister smile upon turning to face her. Just as he pulled his knife out causing Lilly's heart to skip a beat, her mother ran up to her and the boy sprinted off. -What were you thinking?!- her mother yelled-I've told you a hundred times to stay where I can see you! Lilly was still in shock from what she'd seen and just rubbed her eyes. -We won't be coming out to the park for a while. Or at all. I should've listened to your father when he told me that taking you out past the front yard would be a bad idea. Lilly glanced at the dog that was still whimpering in pain and ran to it. -Lilly, come back here!- her mother screamed. Lilly looked at her mother, still standing beside the injured animal. -But he needs my help. He's going to die. -Leave him be. You know what healing those creatures does to you. -I know. I'll get better, I always do. Please mommy, let me do it. Her mother sighed. -Alright, but this is the last time you'll be doing anything of the sort. Lilly smiled and turned to the dog. She placed her hands on it, pressed on the largest wound on its body and used her powers to heal it. Since she was young, it took more time for the healing to take effect as well as more of her energy, making her feel dizzy and nauseous but she didn't care. Her mother picked her up and touched her forehead. Lilly was burning up. -This is a lot worse than the last time… Sweetheart, can you hear me? -Yes…-Lilly played with her mother's golden lock of hair- I want to sleep mommy. -Sleep baby, we'll be home soon.- she sighed- Your father won't like this at all…[Chapter 3] Bughuul was furious to find out what Lilly had done especially since she wasn't getting any better. He was angry at his wife for letting her heal the dog in the first place. -You're the adult, you should've said no and just dragged her back home!- he yelled. -She would've been miserable if that dog had died. -Why should she care about some worthless animal? -She just does. She saw that boy torturing the dog and it bothered her. I don't think she'll ever be okay with doing what we do. -She could still change her mind… Even though he said it, Bughuul barely believed in his own words and his wife sensed it in the tone of his voice. -You know that she may never be okay with this and we can't expose her to any of it. I know how much it would mean to you if she followed in your footsteps but I love her too much to let her suffer. Even though a part of him was disappointed with what he'd heard, Bughuul couldn't bring himself to think about it too much because his daughter was still in a critical condition. -We'll discuss this later, I need to see her now.- he said tiredly. -And while you do that, I'll be getting you ready for your next trip.-she touched his face-You don't look so good either, you need to feed. Bughuul pulled away from her. -I'm not leaving until Lilly gets better. -I can take care of her – -I don't think you can!- Bughuul snapped at his wife. -Don't you dare blame me for what happened to her!-she screamed-Unlike you, I want her to be happy, no matter whether she's anything like us or not! -I care about her happiness just as much as you do but I'm not willing to let her do anything dangerous just so she could be happy for a few moments! -She's hardly ever happy! Do you know how many times I've seen her cry in her room because she doesn't have any friends or siblings to play with?! -Don't start with that again, we're not having any more children. -She's suffocating in this house and you're barely ever here to see it! At least if she had someone – -Enough! Our daughter's life is in danger because of your stupidity. All you should do right now is try to find a way to make her heal. Bughuul headed over to his daughter's bedroom wanting to avoid any further discussion with his wife. Seeing his daughter lying in her bed helpless made him angry. He sat on the bed beside her and caressed her chestnut colored hair. She was asleep but he decided to wake her up just to see if she was still responsive. -Lilly, dad's here, can you hear me?- he whispered, still caressing her hair. At he got from his daughter were muffled noises, as if she was in pain. A few moments later, she opened her eyes. -Can you show me where it hurts the most? Lilly touched the center of her little tummy and he placed his hand on hers. -Daddy…- her voice was raspy and weak. -What is it sweetheart? -Your hand… -Is it bothering you? -No. It's cold… Bughuul picked Lilly up, placed her head on his chest and proceeded to caress her hair. -Is that better? -Yes. -I need you to stay strong for me. Can you do that? -It hurts daddy…-she sobbed-Everything hurts… -Do you see now that the animal wasn't worth your pain? -He needed my help… Please don't hurt him… -Don't talk anymore sweetheart, okay? It'll hurt less. Just try to go back to sleep. -I can't. It still hurts. -Does it hurt less? -Yes…- she glanced at Bughuul's hand that was on her belly and the bones on it seemed to become more and more visible as if he was getting thinner- Daddy, what's happening to your hand? -Nothing, I'm fine…- Bughuul looked up upon hearing the sound of footsteps and then of the door opening. -Can we talk?- his wife asked- I may have found a way to make her feel better. Bughuul wasted no time and quickly placed Lilly on the bed and got up. -I'll be right back.- he said to his daughter and then turned back to his wife and headed out of Lilly's room. -I've thought about it and if you're too stubborn to go out and feed so you can help her recover, you can use me as your source. -That's not a solution, it could kill you. -Not if you know when to stop and you do. -No. It could damage you far more than Lilly. -Would you take a good look at yourself? If you won't feed for me or yourself, at least do it for her. How do you think Lilly's going to feel if something happens to you? -And what if when I come back she's dead? She's in a lot of pain for a reason. She should feed as well. -We can't do that to her. You know that that's a choice and she certainly wouldn't choose to consume souls. -Then we'll just have to trick her into consuming it, she won't have to even know. -This decision could end up shaping her into something she's not. -It couldn't, I know it. Lora was like her and in all the years that she'd spent with me, needing souls to survive hadn't changed her one bit. We need to do this fast. -She'll resent us for this later. -I know, but at least she'll be around to do it. Bughuul did what was necessary to make Lilly feel better and it worked. She loved drinking hot chocolate more than anything, especially when she felt sick, so he asked his wife to make a cup of it while he went searching for a soul that they'd extract for Lilly to consume. She couldn't tell the difference but it healed her nonetheless and her cheeks were rosy again. Knowing that his daughter would be fine now, Bughuul was ready to make that trip and feed. Just as he was about to leave, Lilly ran up to him and wrapped her arms around his knees since this was the tallest she could reach and he picked her up. -Mommy says you're leaving again. -Now that you're all better I have to go. -But you just got here!-she fussed. -I know, but I'll try to get back here as soon as I can. -Can I go with you?- Lilly smiled and pleaded with her big blue eyes. -Don't look at me like that, you know I can't take you along. -Please daddy, I won't cause any trouble, I promise! -That's enough!- her mother interrupted- Your father has to go now. Bughuul put Lilly down and saw that she was about to cry. -Sweetheart, come here.- he knelt down in her level and she ran up to him- When you get back, I'll bring you a little something that we'll play with together. Her eyes lit up. -You promise? -Yes. Just be a good girl and listen to your mom. -I will.-she hugged him- I love you daddy. He hugged her back. -Not nearly as much as I love you silly girl…[Chapter 4] Sadly for Lilly, Bughuul's promise had to wait and by the time he returned she'd looked at him differently. He couldn't understand why she seemed angry or why she tried her best to avoid him, not even bothering to talk to him about the surprise he'd promised her at his departure. -Am I missing something?- Bughuul asked his wife. -I don't know why she's like this, but she's been avoiding me as well. -How long has she been like that?- there was a sense of concern in his voice. -It started about a week after you'd left. I just figured that she was acting out because you'd left us sooner this time. -Have you tried talking to her? -Of course I have, but I haven't managed to get anything out of her. You're more than welcome to try. -I was about to… Bughuul slowly went up to his daughter's bedroom and something caught his attention as he got a bit closer to the door. She was talking to someone. It wasn't just some animal or an imaginary friend as he'd heard a muffled voice that seemed to belong to a male adult. He tried to block everything else out and focused on the voices that were coming from the bedroom. The voice he heard was deep and commanding but at the same time weak, as if it'd belonged to an old man. -Come now- the voice said- you know that he has to pay for what he'd done to you and you're powerful enough to make him pay.- the man's voice became rougher and more threatening. -I can't do it!- she screamed. -Yes you can!-it growled at her, causing Bughuul to storm into Lilly's bedroom. Much to his surprise, Bughuul didn't see anyone other than his daughter in the room. Lilly just stared at him, unresponsive, with her eyes visibly red from crying. -Who were you talking to?!- Bughuul snapped at her. -No one… -Don't lie to me, I know that there was someone else in the room as well! Bughuul walked up to Lilly, knelt in her level and caught her by the shoulders, making her flinch. -Daddy stop! -What am I supposed to be punished for?! -Let her go!-his wife screamed. -What for?!-he screamed, ignoring his wife. Before Lilly could answer her mother got her out of Bughuul's grasp and took her into her arms. Lilly stuffed her face into her mother's neck and began to cry even harder, scared out of her mind. -What's gotten into you? Bughuul couldn't respond, being surprised at his own behavior towards Lilly. Without saying a word, he just left the room. About twenty minutes passed and his wife came into the bedroom, still angry from what had happened. -Why did you leave her room?- he got up from the bed-She shouldn't be alone.-he headed up to Lilly's room but his wife stopped him. -Stop. -I heard her talking to someone, we have to leave and we certainly can't leave her unattended. Bughuul moved past his wife and rushed over to his daughter's bedroom door, stopping at the threshold so he wouldn't wake her up. Then he slowly opened her bedroom door and went inside. He decided to check every part of her room to see if there were any traces of anyone else being in the room but he had no luck in finding anything. As he turned to face the door he saw his wife standing just a few feet away from him. -How come I never heard anything while you were away?- she asked quietly. -I don't know, maybe you weren't paying attention.- he responded quietly as well. -Are you saying that I'm a bad mother?- she frowned at him. -Given how many mothers I've seen, going through all these families, you're great. -I'm trying so hard not to be like my mother and I don't think I'm succeeding at it. -Listen to me.- he placed his hand on her cheek-You're nothing like your mother or anyone from your family. Dealing with someone like Lilly isn't easy, being who we are… -You've dealt with this before. -I wouldn't say that I have. A few moments of silence occurred as they both observed Lilly who was sound asleep. The silence was soon broken by Bughuul's wife. -What exactly happened between you and Lora?- she asked. Bughuul refused to meet his wife's gaze for a few seconds, still staring at Lilly, as he was caught off guard by the question. Then he sighed and turned to face his wife. -Why do you want to know what happened between us so badly?-he finally asked. -Because you still have her things in the attic.- she replied-You could've thrown them away and instead you hid them in a box behind a pile of other boxes, thinking that I wouldn't notice. -I can't bother myself with something that's in the past. -Then I guess you wouldn't mind if I got rid of that box. Bughuul walked over to the bedroom window and looked outside. -I find it fascinating that you still make an effort to keep the memory of that girl alive and yet you refuse to discuss her with me after all these years. Both of them were shaken up by Lilly's loud scream. They turned only to find that she was missing from the bed. -What's happening?! -Lilly!-Bughuul shouted. -DADDY, HELP!-Lilly's scream was clear but it sounded as if it were coming from inside the walls. Bughuul ran to the place where Lilly's screams were coming from but he couldn't find a portal which he could go through to get to her and the source seemed to change every few seconds. -YOU'VE MADE A TERRIBLE MISTAKE BY DISOBEYING ME, GIRL!- the same menacing voice spoke through the walls, but it sounded stronger and far more threatening. -YOU'LL REGRET THIS WHEN I FIND YOU!- Bughuul growled. The man inside the walls laughed for a few seconds and then stopped as if to take a deep breath. -You mean, if you ever find me?- he said calmly. Bughuul turned over everything in the room trying to find the portal as Lilly screamed for help. His wife did the same as quickly as she could in other rooms but had no luck finding any portal either. -DADDY!-Lilly's scream was now coming from the room as she sprinted towards Bughuul and grabbed on to him. He picked her up rapidly and got her out of the room. As he ran to find his wife, he couldn't find her anywhere in the house. He called for her, but there seemed to be no response either. -I'd check the backyard if I were you…- the voice whispered with a small chuckle. Bughuul ran out into the backyard still holding Lilly. She screamed at the sight before her, calling out for her mother. He didn't know how to react as Lilly was still in his arms and he didn't dare to put her down. Even though Lilly was screaming at the top of her lungs Bughuul couldn't hear her anymore. Strangely, all he was able to hear was a heartbeat. Still holding Lilly, he used his powers to get his wife's body down, as she was hanging from the tree before. He didn't sense that she was alive, but the sound of that heartbeat still grew stronger and stronger. Slightly more focused, he realized that the sound of that heartbeat was coming from her womb.[Chapter 5] It was three in the morning. Glancing at clock on her bedside table, Lora wasn't too happy that she'd been awoken at this hour. Not because she didn't like being woken up but because her house was always quiet and it was the first time something had woken her up at that hour. She heard footsteps coming from upstairs and it annoyed her that she'd have to use her powers to possibly hurt whatever intruder was there as she hated doing it. Lora walked out of her bedroom and got a little closer to the staircase so she could hear better. She heard whispers. One of the voices belonged to a little girl and the other one made her freeze in place. She'd known that voice all too well and she didn't want to go up there but she still figured that the girl was about to be hurt and she wasn't going to let that happen. She picked up the courage and a few moments later found herself in her craft room where Bughuul was with a girl. The girl before her was in tears and looked scared. -Is this supposed to be some sick game of yours that I'm not familiar with?!-she tried to sound confident but her voice gave her away. -I wouldn't have come here if I had a safer place to take my daughter to. Lora frowned. -Your daughter? -I'm aware that we have a lot to talk about, but for now, could you treat her wounds? I have some things I need to take care of and I trust you could watch her until I get back. -I'm still asleep, right?- Lora mumbled to herself. Bughuul got a few steps closer to her. -I know you resent me, but I also know that you wouldn't turn down a chance to help someone in need. Lora seemed surprised at the tone of his voice as it sounded pleading. -Okay. But as soon as you get back, you need to tell me everything, you owe me that much. -I will, just take good care of her. Don't let her out of your sight. It's important to be with her every second until I get back, it's dangerous for her to be all alone. -I understand. Bughuul went over to Lilly. -Listen to Lora, she'll keep you safe. -Please don't hurt the baby, it's not its fault that mommy's gone. -I'm sorry sweetheart but if I'll have to choose between saving your mom and saving that baby, I'll choose her. -Saving what's dead won't do you any good.- Lora said- Save the living. If that baby inside her is still alive, it won't stay that way for long unless you save it. -Daddy please.-Lilly took Bughuul by the hand- Mommy would want you to save the baby too. -I know. I just can't take care of another one by myself. -Just save that child. Don't worry about the rest. Bughuul sighed and left without saying another word. Lora looked at Lilly and it made her sad to see an innocent child so broken. She walked over to her and smiled tiredly, wanting to give Lilly some comfort. -Let's take a look at those wounds… Lora saw that there were bruises all over Lilly's body and it made her sick. -Honey, who did this to you?- she asked in a quiet gentle tone but also with a hint of concern. -It was the monster that killed my mommy… It's my fault she's dead. Lora hugged Lilly. -Don't say that.- she backed away and looked at Lilly again- Monsters are cunning creatures, he probably made you believe that he was a friend just to get something from you. -He did say that he was my friend… He also said that my daddy's a monster who makes children kill for him and then he traps them in a cold dark place… -Did you believe him? -I didn't at first, but then he showed me… The dreadful murders she was forced to watch flashed before her eyes and it made her scared again. Over everything that had happened, Lilly had forgotten just how cruel her father was to those children and now recalling it, it scared her and she felt unsafe, given that her mother was dead and as kind as Lora was, she was still a stranger to Lilly. -He said that daddy hates me because I'm not like him and that he's making me become like him by feeding me their souls when I'm not aware… I'm so scared…- Lilly began crying again. -Don't worry honey.-Lora placed Lilly on her lap- I'll take care of you, I promise. Now I'm going to make you some hot chocolate and then we're going to take care of your wounds. Lora took Lilly downstairs to the kitchen and made her some hot chocolate as well as coffee for herself and then started treating Lilly's wounds. They soon began a conversation so Lilly would be distracted from the pain. -What's your dad like?-Lora asked-Is he good to you? -Most of the time… I know he looks kind of scary but he was good to me. He taught me how to play the piano and helped me get better at painting. He had a lot of rules for me but he was still nice. My mommy said that he only set the rules to keep me safe but because of that I don't know anyone but mommy and daddy. -He's never mentioned me? Lilly nodded away. -It makes sense…- Lora spoke her mind. -How do you know him? -I used to live with him. He raised me, in a way. -Were you like those children? -I guess you could say that. I mean, I wasn't exactly like them, I was actually more like you, but he used me sometimes to do some bad things that I didn't like doing. -How did you run away? -I keep asking myself that same question… So, no brothers or sisters? -No. But I hope daddy will save this baby. -I believe he will. Would you prefer a brother or a sister? -I don't know. I would just be happy to have someone… Are you alone too? -I won't be alone for long. I bought this house so I could open up an orphanage. Hopefully it'll happen in the near future, I'm still setting it up. -Can I help you get it ready faster? Lora smiled. -I think you can, but only once you recover. -How long will that take? -It depends on you. If you follow my instructions you'll be as good as new in a few days. -I'll do everything you ask, I promise. -The first thing I need you to do is to tell me about that monster – what did he look like and what exactly did he want from you? -He's really tall and he has horns on his head… I haven't seen his eyes, it's like he didn't have any… -Did he tell you his name? -He told me he couldn't remember it. -Of course he did, so we wouldn't know who he was. Could you draw him for me once you've had a good night sleep? -Yes. -Good. And what did he want from you? What did he ask you to do? -He told me that I should kill mommy and daddy because they lied to me. He said that he'd help me do it. -And did you want to do it? -No. I could never do something like that. -Not even now that your mom's gone? You wouldn't do anything bad to your dad? -No. -That's good… I'm all done here, let's get you ready for bed.[Chapter 6] Bughuul didn't want to see his wife again, not in that lifeless state, and hearing that heartbeat in her womb would've only made him angrier. Still, he knew he had to save his unborn child – his wife would've wanted him to after all, and he knew that Lilly would resent him even more if he'd just decided to let it die. In a way that child was the last remaining piece of his wife but it meant nothing to him. He felt that it was unfair that it survived and she didn't. He knew that it wasn't the hanging that had murdered her. She had to have been poisoned by whomever this thing was and if it'd murdered her, it should've murdered the child as well. Why did it survive? As he unwillingly approached his wife's body which faded away in color with each passing moment, with only the womb showing any signs of life, he became more enraged. The bump had looked slightly bigger as well. The heartbeat, though a little weaker, was still constant. It became obvious to him that it was using his wife's remains to keep itself on life support. The sound of the heartbeat wouldn't give him peace. He wanted to just let it die and tell Lilly and Lora that he couldn't make it on time and save it, but all he could see before his eyes was his wife crying over all of their lost children. - We'd lost so many of them over the years and it was out of our hands. Now you want to willingly murder our unborn child? He could still summon the sound of her voice to his mind and the words that came to it couldn't have been real but he felt as if they were. Bughuul placed his hand on her belly and he felt the heartbeat pulsing through his hand. -Why don't you just die like the others?- he whispered angrily- She wanted them and I wanted them with her but they were never born. Why should you get to live while your mother's dead?- he began to press on the belly even harder, making the heartbeat slow down a bit, slowly draining it and then something made him stop. He began to feel another presence there. He heard the sound of heavy breathing, as if it were coming from behind, just a few inches away from him. -What do you want from me?!- Bughuul turned around, hoping to see whose presence he'd felt, but there was no one there. -You'll find out what I want very soon…- the voice announced itself. -Don't you dare lay a hand on my daughter again! She didn't do anything to you! -She didn't, but you did. -What did I do to you? I don't even know who you are. I'm surprised that you don't know who I am, even offended, in a way… After all, you'd faded into obscurity after your banishment, making anyone out there like yourself unaware that you're still alive. You may not recognize my voice as I'd grown older and weaker thanks to you but I don't think you've ever wronged anyone like you've wronged me to assume anyone else would want to harm you. Bughuul stood silent for a moment, realizing whom he was speaking to. It was someone he'd thought long gone, as he'd made sure of it, or at least he thought so. -How are you here?- he asked- You turned to dust before my very eyes. I murdered you. -You've underestimated me. Your delusion that you're more powerful than me had left you blind. -Why now? -Because your daughter is just the perfect little thing for me to corrupt, especially now that she's vulnerable. Who would've thought that someone like you could've fathered something so… pure? -I could say the same for you. But you don't care about her, do you? It's always been about your pride. -You were a fool to humiliate me twice. I'd spent years planning out the perfect vengeance and once you fell for that mortal girl I thought murdering her would've been perfect. But then, as I was about to do it, I sensed that she'd wanted a child and I knew you'd have given in eventually...- he let out a laugh of mockery- I absorbed the life of every single child that grew within her until I sensed purity like never before, years later, and decided to let her have Lilly. And you thought it was all because of you…- he laughed- Who knows? Maybe it was in a way. Maybe if you hadn't left her alone to go feed, you'd still have a child or two around apart from that precious little thing you love so much… -Why don't you just end me? It would give you pleasure, wouldn't it? -No…-he responded, almost gently- If I've learned anything having spent years with you was that you just won't die. But I've also learned that you can break and I will relish watching you crumble.- he laughed deviously. -That's nothing new to me… The sound of the heartbeat began to slow down again. -You should still save that child, while you have the chance… -Why would you care if it lives or dies? -I can sense its power even when it's this undeveloped. -And you'd love to take it, wouldn't you? Why don't you? Take it and leave Lilly alone. -I'd rather take the one that means something to you. If you don't choose to save the unborn, I'll take them both. -What is it going to take for you to leave Lilly alone? There must be something. Bughuul anticipated the response for a few moments, only being able to hear the heavy breathing and the heartbeat. -Since you were once dear to me, I would be willing to let your daughter go, but only if you were willing to do the same. Leave her someplace and never look for her. As much as it pained him to even think of leaving Lilly like that, Bughuul didn't hesitate for a moment in responding to the offer. -Done. -I'm not finished yet. Before you let her go, you'll have to bring Lora to me. It seems only fitting after all. -What could you possibly need from her now that she's a young woman? She won't listen to you. -What I do with her after you hand her over is none of your concern. I will give you a week to consider my offer, which you must admit is rather generous on my part. However, if your mind is not made up by then, I promise you the front seat to your daughter's destruction. Not that you'll have any choice when it comes to the attendance. Bughuul could no longer sense the presence of that voice. Now all he was left with was the weak heartbeat of his unborn child. Knowing now who he was dealing with, he had decided to save the child after all. He extracted a good chunk of his own energy to keep it alive. Doing that bought him a few hours but he knew the best way to keep it growing was to give it life of other unborn children so he set out to look for them. It would take dozens of them to save it and searching for them for too long would prove exhausting but he had to do it. It wasn't until dawn that he'd gathered enough energy for the child to be developed enough to be born. Bughuul had no other choice than to take the child out himself. His wife resembled a corpse at this point but he still couldn't find enough strength to part with her. She was everything to him and he felt he'd failed her in the end. He took her by the hand one last time and picked up the strength to say his goodbye. -I know I should be with you right now but I can't give up just yet…-he caressed her lifeless hand- Not until I make sure that every single family is as broken as ours is now. When I'm done making humanity suffer, I'll come to you, I promise… With those words, he took the child out of her and after it gasped for its very first breath, it cried loudly to announce its presence. Bughuul took his son and placed him to his chest. He looked at the boy and strangely all of the resentment he'd felt before had gone away. Another thing that seemed out of the ordinary was that he was able to sense anger and fear from the child. The baby boy opened his eyes, looked at his father and with that he instantly stopped crying. Bughuul then realized that he'd had a strange telepathic connection with his son, which he didn't have with Lilly. He sensed that his son was fully aware of everything that was happening, that he'd been aware from when he was only a month old in his mother's womb up until to the point when he entered the human world. Bughuul carefully paced with his finger against his son's cheek and the boy grasped it, looked at Bughuul and smiled. Bughuul sensed that, at that very moment, the fear that his son had felt was now gone and that the anger, though still there, wasn't directed towards him but towards the monster that had murdered his mother.[Chapter 7] Bughuul entered the bedroom that Lilly and Lora were in as quietly as he could. His son curiously looked around the room and seeing Lilly and Lora, he felt comfort, so he closed his eyes and drifted off to sleep with a smile on his face. Lora had fallen asleep in the armchair that she'd placed next to Lilly's bed, with Lilly's hand in hers even as they both slept firmly. Seeing that, Bughuul decided to wait until morning to introduce them to his son and left, occupying another one of the rooms with the baby. The following morning, Lilly woke up first as she was woken up by her brother's cries. She sat up from her bed hastily, making Lora wake up frantically. -What is it?!- she jumped up- What's wrong?! Before she could get a response, Lora heard the crying herself and just glanced at Lilly. -He saved the baby, Lo!- she said with a rush of excitement and a smile on her face. Then she jumped off the bed and sprinted out of the room. -Hey, slow down!- Lora was still pretty sleepy but she had to run after Lilly to make sure that it wasn't a trap to lure Lilly away or anything like that, so she bumped into a few things along the way. Two rooms down from the one they were in, Lora saw a baby boy on the bed and even though Bughuul lay right next to him he hadn't reacted to the crying at all. -Bughuul?- Lora came up to Bughuul and touched his hand but he was unresponsive- What in the world have you done last night?- she muttered to herself. -What's wrong with daddy?- Lilly sat next to her baby brother, trying to calm him down. -Nothing honey, he'll be okay. I just need to do something… -What's wrong with my brother? He won't stop crying. Lora sighed and looked at the crying child. Then she took him into her arms and examined him. -He's hungry. -You have milk, right?- Lilly asked. -He's not hungry for that… -Oh… Maybe I can feed him. -You can't, you're still recovering.- Lora rocked the baby nervously- Shhh, I need to take care of your dad first… -Daddy's moving! He moved his hand just now! Lora sighed with relief. -Bughuul, can you hear me?- she asked. -You need to feed him…- he responded tiredly a few moments later, after gathering the strength to speak. -I know but I can't leave Lilly with you in that state. -Just feed him… I'll look after Lilly… -I won't be long. Lora used the remains of the souls that she'd fed on and gave them to the baby which did the job and then she rushed back to Lilly and Bughuul. She was happy to see that Bughuul was regaining some of his strength. -You still have some explaining to do.- she said. -Now isn't the time for that, wouldn't you agree?- he glanced at Lilly. Lora groaned. -Alright! Lilly, come with me to see what you'd like for breakfast. -Okay. Before jumping off of the bed Lilly wrapped her arms around Bughuul's neck from behind and kissed him on the cheek. -Thank you for saving the baby daddy.- she said quickly and jumped off the bed. Then she took Lora by the hand. -You'll be okay?- Lora asked Bughuul. He nodded and she left downstairs with Lilly. Lora was happy to see Lilly so cheerful and hoped that she'd stay that way as long as possible. Since Lilly decided on chocolate-chip pancakes for breakfast, Lora started preparing them for her. -What do you want to talk to daddy about?- Lilly climbed on the kitchen counter and sat on it. -It's just some grown-up stuff, don't bother yourself with it. -What did he do to make you so mad at him? Lora sighed. -Lilly… Lora didn't know what to say and she wasn't sure if she should say anything at all, thinking of how Lilly may react. -Your brother needs you in the living room. Both Lilly and Lora turned upon hearing Bughuul's voice and saw him standing at the kitchen's threshold with the baby in his arms. -Is he okay?- Lilly went over to touch her brother's hand. -He's fine, he just wants to play with his big sister.- Bughuul said. Lora turned to Bughuul. -You should be with them.- she said- I'll get Lilly's breakfast ready in a few minutes. Bughuul took both Lilly and the baby into the living room and then placed his son on the couch. Lilly carefully sat next to her brother and caressed his tiny black curls. -He's adorable.- she said and then looked up at Bughuul- What are we going to call him? -Your mother had always liked the name Morgan for a boy, I thought we could honor her by giving your brother that name. -I like it. -He's pretty pleased with the name as well. -How do you know that? -I can read his mind in a way, if he wants to communicate with me. -I wish I could do that. -Maybe you will be able to in time… Bughuul observed his daughter as she cheerfully played with her baby brother and he was glad to see her be happy again but he knew that he'd have to talk to her about what had happened at their old house, as well teach her how to protect herself which he knew wouldn't be easy for someone her age. He didn't see the point in delaying the conversation about it any longer. -Lilly… She looked up at him. -Yes daddy? -I know you haven't thought to ask, but I brought you a little something as I'd promised. -What is it?- Lilly's mind was sparked with curiosity. Bughuul got up and got the box that was placed next to the couch. Then he placed it before Lilly who seemed eager to find out what was inside. -Can I open it?- she asked excitedly. -Yes. Lilly opened the box and saw a camera inside along with some additional equipment. She turned to face Bughuul. -It's mine? -It's yours. I think it's about time I teach you how to operate it. Lora came into the room and wasn't pleased to see that Lilly had received a 16mm camera as she knew what he normally got other children to use it for. -Lo, look what daddy got me!- Lilly exclaimed excitedly, carefully holding up her 16mm camera. -I see. And what is she going to be using that camera for, Bughuul?- Lora crossed her arms. Bughuul got up. -I'm assuming that you're here because Lilly's breakfast's ready?- he asked, ignored her question. -Yes.- Lora replied- Lilly, go to the kitchen, we'll be right behind you. -But daddy said that he'd teach me how to use the camera. -Go and have breakfast, I'll teach you how to work with the camera after you're done.[Chapter 8] -I'm done. Lilly got up and put her plate in the sink. As she about to head out of the kitchen to go to her father, Lora stopped her. -Lilly, you said that you'd draw your monster for me and I think you can do it now.- she said. -But daddy's waiting for me. -He can wait a bit more. I'll accompany you to the craft room. Meanwhile, Bughuul was trying to put Morgan to sleep by singing to him as he'd done to Lilly when she was a baby and it seemed to work, but just as Bughuul was about to head out of the room after making sure that Morgan's asleep, he heard him cry. Bughuul went over to Morgan and carefully touched his face and there seemed to be nothing wrong with him physically as he was clean and fed. A few moments later Bughuul found out that Morgan was afraid. There was something in the house that frightened him, something unknown to him, but Bughuul had the idea of what may be scaring his son, so he picked him up and took him out of the room. Even being outside of that room, Morgan fussed as the threatening presence was still there. Bughuul decided to go into Lora's craft room as he heard Lilly's and Lora's voices in there. As they got closer to the room, Morgan begged him not to go in there, using the telepathic connection that they had, but that made Bughuul want to go in even more as he thought that Lilly and Lora would be in danger and that he'd have to do something. -I'm sorry that I didn't come to you after breakfast daddy, Lo needed me to do something for her.- Lilly spoke as he entered the room. Bughuul could tell that something was wrong by the expression of sheer terror on Lora's face as she was staring at a piece of paper and it didn't take him long to snatch it away from her. He looked at the drawing for a mere second and seeing what was on it, he threw it away and destroyed it with fire using his powers. -Why would you draw this?- Bughuul asked Lilly. -Lo wanted to see the monster.- Lilly replied with a sense of fear since she could tell by the tone of her father's voice that he was upset- She said that it could help her protect me from him if she knew who he was. Bughuul glanced at Lora. -Where am I supposed to take them now?!- he snapped at her- How am I going to hide in some attic or basement with an infant?! -I get that you're angry, but I thought it would be helpful. Maybe I could take him – -And how would you protect him exactly? -The same way we're both protecting them now, I wouldn't let him out of my sight. You seem to forget that I'm as powerful as he is, maybe even more so. -You would be more powerful if you'd bothered to use your abilities. -Well, I just might start using them now when the situation calls for it. I'll find shelter where he won't be able to touch us, I promise. Bughuul glanced at his son who he felt didn't want to be separated from him and Lilly, which saddened him in a way as he wanted to be a part of Morgan's life but he knew that Lora would do anything in her might to protect him and he knew he'd have to leave Morgan, at least until he grew up to be a little older. -Just let me take him, please.- Lora said. Bughuul looked up at Lora and just nodded, letting her know that she would be able to take Morgan. Sometime later, as Lora was getting Lilly's things ready, she looked up from them to see Lilly sitting on her bed cradling her brown teddy bear with a look of sadness on her face. -Sweetheart, this may not be for long, there's no need to be sad.- Lora walked over to Lilly and sat next to her. -It's not fair.- Lilly said- I didn't have anyone and now that I met you and that Morgan's here, I have to run. It's my fault too, if I hadn't been stupid – -You're not stupid.- Lora caressed Lilly's hair- You're a kind little girl who wanted to make a friend and he took advantage of that… That same monster tried snatching me away when I was your age too. -Really? -Yes. I was lonely, just like you. Your daddy wouldn't let me have any friends since he thought that would be too dangerous. I'd only had friend for a short time and that didn't last. -What happened? -He was…- Lora realized that she was about to tell Lilly that Bughuul had murdered her childhood friend- He died. -How did he die? -It doesn't matter. After I lost him, I became angry and I pulled away from your dad and the monster saw that as an opportunity to take me away, or in his words, to take me back. Your dad took me away from him when I was only a week old. Lilly's eyes widened as she realized something. -You're the daughter he said daddy took from him…- she said- But the monster said that my daddy killed that baby. -That's not entirely true. He wanted me dead to get back at the monster for torturing him from early childhood and for banishing him from the only home he'd known but he changed his mind when he saw that I was neglected, bruised and starved… -What happened when he took you away? He took care of me the best way he knew how and I never thanked him for that. When the monster lured me away, your dad risked his life to save me. -So why did you leave? -I fell in love and your dad didn't want to even hear of it so, months after secretly meeting up with the man I fell for, I stupidly ran off after a big fight with your father about my secret relationship and I never came back. He never came after me either. -What happened when you left?- Lilly asked curiously. Lora felt as if something had stabbed her in the gut just thinking about what had happened after she'd left Bughuul but she knew it might make her feel better to finally talk to someone about it even if it was someone as young as Lilly. -I'd met with Ned that night after letting him know that I'd left your dad and he came to pick me up. He bought me a house soon after I'd left your dad and we decided to get married in our backyard as it was spacious and it had a wonderful garden…- remembering it all, Lora's mind drifted back in time, having her vividly remember everything- The wedding itself was small since Ned only had a few friends and only his mom was alive since his dad had died at war, while Ned was still a child. There wasn't much of extended family on his part either. His mother was a lovely woman and I loved having her around as she became like a mother to me as well. I was incredibly happy and It seemed as it my wedding day was going to be the happiest day of my life... But it didn't take long for it to become the worst day of my life.- Lora's eyes filled with tears as her own screams occupied her mind as did the image of scattered corpses everywhere- I'm sorry. I shouldn't have gone this far. -I want to hear what happened. -It's better that you don't hear the rest of the story. The point is that I should've stayed with your dad, at least he would've kept me safe. Lora pulled away from Lilly and sprinted out of the room, as she couldn't hold her tears anymore. Lilly still managed to notice that Lora was on the edge of tears and didn't want to make things worse by insisting that she finish the story. Since she felt responsible for Lora's crying, Lilly went over to Lora's room where she was standing and staring at the window through tears. Lilly ran to Lora and wrapped her arms around Lora's legs. -I'm sorry Lo.- she said- I didn't want to make you cry. -It's not your fault.- Lora turned to Lilly, trying her best to pull it together- I shouldn't have told you anything. -I'm not a stupid child who can't understand anything, you wouldn't be protecting me by not telling me anything. -You're a smart girl, but if there's no need for you to know about some terrible things then you shouldn't know them. I got carried away and I shouldn't have… Go and play with your brother, I'll join you in a few minutes.[Chapter 9] Moloch observed his brother from the flames. It angered him that Bughuul hadn't bent and decided to hand Lora over as he'd expected and he knew what he'd have to do. Moloch had longed for power ever since he could remember and it was all that ever mattered to him. Thirst for pain and tears of others had been something he'd craved since birth. Wanting to stay an only child, Moloch had gotten rid of every single one of his siblings before Bughuul was born, making it seem as if they'd gotten sick or something similar. When Bughuul was born, Moloch wasn't going to make an exception but it seemed like his brother was determined to stay alive. Moloch didn't know that his brother was aware of everything, even in their mother's womb, so he knew that his brother wanted him dead. It seemed strange to Moloch that his brother wouldn't just die despite his best efforts to drain him. Still, Moloch took his victories where he could and tortured his brother mercilessly whenever he had the chance even though Bughuul had done nothing to wrong him and was, at the early stage of his life, a total opposite to his brother. That time of innocence and compassion for mortal creatures didn't last and the evil that was buried deep inside Bughuul would slowly reach surface thanks to Moloch. Six years after Bughuul's birth, their mother gave birth to another child, which would be the last. It was a girl with beautiful raven hair who bore the most resemblance to their mother. Aware of Moloch's intentions with their sister, Bughuul barely left her sight. He didn't want to give his brother the satisfaction of hurting her, let alone murdering her like the others. He'd gladly taken a hit for her and Moloch had mocked him for it, claiming Bughuul to be weak and worthless. The love Bughuul had for their sister angered Moloch and he wanted her dead more and more with each passing day. Dahlia had a fascination with the human world and her longing for it wasn't something she could help. She didn't care that venturing into the human world made her more vulnerable and that was what eventually led to her doom. Bughuul didn't like her going there but Moloch saw it as an opportunity to finally get rid of her. He knew of the fear of the unknown that the mortals had and he made sure that they see his sister's abilities. He'd also made sure that Bughuul doesn't ruin his plan in any way, so he waited patiently for their father to return and take Bughuul along on his next journey, knowing that Bughuul couldn't refuse their father even to stay with Dahlia, mainly due to fear and respect he had for him. It wasn't long before Bughuul's departure when Moloch exposed his sister's abilities to the human world, making the mortals paranoid and filled with fear, just as he'd foreseen. The villagers ambushed her and kept her imprisoned and malnourished for a few days until they finally decided to murder her. Moloch had witnessed everything from the distance, and as he'd watched Dahlia get beaten and burned, his mother saw it too. Before she could do anything to defend herself, Moloch grabbed her and twisted her neck. He didn't stop until every bone in her body was broken. He took her out into the human world so she could die there, making it seem as if she were ambushed just like Dahlia. Upon returning, Bughuul knew that Moloch had something to do with their mother's and sister's demise but their father saw Bughuul's statement as false, knowing of his jealousy of Moloch and not wanting to argue, departed to find the ones responsible. Hours after their father's departure, Bughuul ventured into his brother's chambers, who was in the company of some of his most devoted worshippers, seeming more careless than ever. -How dare you come here unannounced?!- Moloch sat up furiously. -I see you're having a hard time after what had happened. Moloch turned away. -Leave.- he hissed through his teeth. -You've been planning this for a while now, haven't you? -Get out of my chambers! -I know you take pleasure in hurting the innocent but she was our sister! Moloch turned to face his brother and smiled. -What difference does that make?- he said- She was just as worthless as the rest of them. Filled with rage, Bughuul charged at his brother, making everyone present gasp and afraid to even attempt and defend their master. Even Moloch himself was surprised at his brother's reaction as well as his strength, but after a while he managed to take control, beating Bughuul nearly to death and locking him up in his chamber afterwards. Fueled by rage, Bughuul wanted to get back at his brother more than ever, having been pushed over the edge. Moloch was cunning and Bughuul knew that, so he had to use his brother's own tactics to defeat him. Bughuul spent weeks fooling his brother into believing that he'd changed, that he truly believes Moloch to be the one true God who should be worshipped by all even though the rage was eating him up inside. All the pretense was nothing more than humiliation for Bughuul but every time he felt like snapping he reminded himself that the charade would pay off. On the night a celebration in Moloch's honor took place, Bughuul decided to make his first move. He ventured into the chamber where Moloch had kept the offered children and eager to taste their souls, Bughuul grabbed them rapidly, one by one, consuming their souls. It was the best he'd felt since he could remember, having humiliated his brother by consuming the souls that weren't meant for him. -You think you're so clever, don't you? Bughuul turned upon hearing his brother's voice. -I hope that it was all worth it to you because I won't let you taste another soul ever again. You'll need them for survival, that I can't change, but you won't ever be able to feel their taste. -I hate you. -It doesn't matter what you do or say Bughuul, you can't win. -I'll never stop trying to destroy you. -And you'll never succeed. Farewell brother. With those words, Moloch sealed Bughuul's mouth with the remains of the children whose souls he'd stolen and cast him out into the human world, leaving him more bitter and vengeful than ever. Moloch had kept an eye on his brother, even after the banishment and he'd awaited Bughuul's return, knowing that it would happen. His senses hadn't failed him and Bughuul had indeed returned, but only years later, sometime after the birth of Moloch's first child. Even though he wasn't the fatherly type, Moloch still wanted a proper heir by his side and upon hearing that his wife was with child, he'd allowed her to keep it for that very reason. But when Lora was born, he was disappointed, as she was weak. Even after he'd attempted to forcefully feed her the souls of the innocent, she'd stayed pure and uncorrupt. Both he and his wife had felt nothing but hatred for their newborn daughter and had decided that they could at least get something out of her by torturing her, seeing just how much she could endure until she finally dies. Bughuul had heard of the birth of his brother's daughter and saw it as an opportunity to hurt Moloch's pride again, not thinking of what it may cost him. Just like the last time, he'd ventured there in the middle of the night searching for the infant but he couldn't seem to find her in any of the main chambers. It wasn't until Bughuul ventured deeper into the darkness that he'd heard crying, which itself wasn't so loud, even when he was only a few feet away from her. Lora was unclothed and practically skin and bones at this point, with cuts and bruises all over her fragile body. Bughuul had taken her into his arms and she looked at him, trying to cry harder, as if to cry for help, but her little voice was breaking. It didn't take him long to change his mind and bring her along instead of murdering her, figuring his brother thought her to be disgrace and having her live would hurt him a lot more. Much to his own surprise, he'd grown to care for the girl, even going so far to put himself in danger again by going after her when she was captured by Moloch. On that day, Bughuul thought he'd won the battle and that he'd finally gotten rid of his brother and at the time, that wasn't far from the truth. Moloch was on the verge of disappearing into the void, but his wife sacrificed herself along with his most faithful followers to keep him alive. -I'll get you back when I reclaim my power.- he'd said to her before she'd let him drain her- You're the only one who's ever been worthy of me. Moloch remembered what he'd said as he looked over his wife's revived body. She was now strong, possibly stronger than him and he had faith in her. He had faith that she'd help him destroy his brother and the ones he wants to protect once and for all.[Chapter 10] Bughuul watched his son sleep, thinking of just how hard it would be to spend years apart from him, especially given their bond. He wasn't sure how Morgan will take being apart from him either. Lora entered the room carrying sleeping Lilly, placed her on the bed next to Morgan and turned her gaze to Bughuul. -When are you planning on leaving?- she asked. -We'll be leaving soon. I just can't… I can't leave Morgan. -You don't trust me to take good care of him? -You know that I do. I just hate that I have to leave him like this. I never thought that I'd care for him so much after what had happened, but I do. Lora took Bughuul's hand into hers. -You're a good dad. I know you're doing your best, just like you did with me. I see that now. -It looks like my best isn't good enough. As I recall, before you left me you said that you hate me. -I was a stupid kid. -I get why you wanted all those things but the only way I knew how to protect you was to keep you away from everyone, especially after we'd left Moloch's realm. Lora laid her head on Bughuul's shoulder and her eyes began to fill with tears. -You were right though.- her voice broke- I should've stayed with you. Ned and his family would still be alive… -You couldn't have known… Those men paid for what they'd done to you. Lora looked at Bughuul. -What do you mean by that?- she asked quietly through tears. Bughuul touched Lora's cheek. -I murdered them.- he said- All of them. -So that's how you found me. You've been watching me all these years… -I had to make sure that you were alright. -Why didn't you come for me after what had happened? -I thought you'd be better off without me, that you didn't want me in your life. -But you were still there, weren't you? Those dreams that I'd had of you holding me when I cried, they weren't dreams. -No. I was with you every night until you recovered. After that I'd visit you every once in a while. It seemed like you were doing better. -I'd tried living a normal life but I knew that those men were Moloch's followers and I thought that it would only be a matter of time before they got to me. And I couldn't look for you because I thought you'd grown to resent me after I'd left you. I even thought you'd want me dead. -I'll never stop caring for you like you're my own, I want you to know that. No matter what. -This seems strange. It's like I'm seeing a whole new side of you. -Maybe that's because you're not a child anymore. -It could be… You still haven't told me how you met your wife. What made you fall in love after so many decades of not needing anyone by your side? Bughuul sighed. He'd been avoiding to look back on the past, even the happier times, as it would've only made him feel worse, given the circumstances, but there seemed to be a glow of curiosity in Lora's eyes, just like when she was child and he couldn't resist telling her the story, given that they won't be seeing each other in a while. -We'd met in a strange way, I suppose. I was always the one seeking out knew victims and she was, although the youngest in her family, still on the brink of turning twenty, making her too old for me to take. We wouldn't have even met if she hadn't made the offering herself and summoned me. -That must've felt great for you. -I'd be lying if I said that it hadn't. After my banishment, people seemed to have forgotten about me and hearing her calling out to me, praying to me, it made me feel like a God again. -So, what happened when you heard her call for you? -I presented myself to her, wanting to be commanding and threatening, making her regret that she'd tried to contact me in the first place, but the first thing she did was kneel before me and beg me to save her from the Gods, since they were supposed to be coming for her that night, because of the deal her parents had made for the benefit of her older sister. I couldn't pass on the opportunity to take away another gift from the Gods so I took her with me. For years she'd helped me get the children to make their offerings and she'd taken care of me as well, probably much better than I'd taken care of myself before. She lit up whenever she looked at me, and the more I found out about her, the more I became mesmerized with her as well. She was nearly as broken and miserable as I was, before she came to me. -It's nice that you found each other. -Except that she's gone now, all because I wasn't careful. I should've taken care of her like she had of me. -It's not your fault. You can't control everything. -I know I can't. If I could, Moloch would be nothing but dust now. -I've found out what can destroy him for good, I just need to find it. -Tell me what it is, maybe I can look for it too. -You can't. I'm the only one who can move around freely without being suspicious… -I'd still like to know what it is. -It's a dagger carved from the very first tree that grew on Earth. It contains poison that can kill any evil being, no matter how powerful it may be. -That sounds like something that's impossible to find in this day and age. -It will be hard to find, but not impossible. There are demon enthusiasts all over the world who collect strange things, one of them could have one of the daggers. -Wait, you said dagger not daggers before. -There are more, but we only require one. -Be careful. -Don't worry, I will be. About an hour later, Bughuul was getting ready to leave the house with Lilly. Holding her in his arms as she was still asleep, he said goodbye to Lora and told her that they'll still be in touch but only communicate the way he'd taught her when she was a child so Moloch wouldn't know that they're still in touch. Soon after Bughuul had left the house, Lora packed up the necessary things she'll need for Morgan as well as herself and left the house, knowing that she wouldn't be safe there alone with Morgan. She drove to a motel that was hours away from her house, planning to spend the next few days there and plan out what to do next. Lora knew that she wouldn't be able to afford going from place to place and that she'd have to find a safe place to settle in, at least for a year which wasn't going to be easy since she didn't know what Moloch could be capable of and just how far he'd be able to go when it came to hurting her and Morgan. She figured that he may still have some followers around and that she'd have to watch her back as well as practice her powers until she reaches her full potential. There was so much she had to do and she wasn't sure that she could do it, but she swore to herself that night, that she'd protect Morgan, no matter what the cost. TO BE CONTINUED IN BROKEN PIECES PART 2 I'd like to thank all of you who'd stuck with the story until the end.

Hopefully she could convince her mother to repaint it. It was a dusty pink color, and the paint job itself looked as old as the house. Not that she was complaining. As her father always reminded her, she should be lucky she even gets a room, let alone one to herself. Reagan Grace came bounding into her sister's room. Her mess of dark brown hair covered her eyes, and Avery swept it out of the way. \"Don't you just love it here?\" Reagan asked, twirling around. Avery shrugged. \"It's nice,\" she said with a weak smile. \"How's your room?\" \"That's what I wanted to show you!\" Reagan grabbed her older sister's hand and dragged her out of her room. \"Come see!\" Avery laughed. Reagan had such a light about her, and she loved it. She could never be sad around Reagan. Not ever. Pictures of kittens were already crookedly taped on the cream-colored walls. Reagan's pink sparkly comforter already dressed her bed. This room was a six-year-old's paradise already. \"It looks great, Reagan. Did you do this all by yourself?\" Reagan Grace's head bobbed up and down excitedly. \"Yeah! Well, Chance helped with the bed a little bit. But everything else I did all by myself. Aren't you proud of me?\" Avery squeezed her sister. \"Very. You did a great job. Maybe you can help me with my room? It looks so sad in there, you know?\" Reagan ran to her desk and pulled out a picture of a puppy with a bow. \"This will make it all better, won't it, Avery?\" \"Yes. I'm sure it will,\" Avery replied. \"I'm going to go help Mom downstairs, 'k? Why don't you find a nice spot to put that up, Sunshine? I trust your judgement.\" Reagan's big brown eyes widened with excitement. She hadn't felt so grown up and responsible since, well, earlier today when she helped lug boxes. She dashed to Avery's room, as Avery made her way down the carpeted steps. \"Avery, honey?\" Victoria asked. \"Where's your brother?\" \"CHANCE?\" Avery called out. \"What?\" came his voice from upstairs. \"He's upstairs.\" Avery quickly added, \"I'll go get him!\" before she was accused of sarcasm. That never went over well. \"Mom wants you,\" Avery told Chance as soon as she got to his doorway. \"You should help. You've been here all day.\" Although she was not even two years his senior, Avery sometimes acted like she was the mom. \"Make me,\" he teased. Groaning, he jumped off his bed and playfully punched his sister as he walked out. Avery followed him down the stairs. She glanced uneasily at the clock. 4:30 already... Another 45 minutes. She shook her head and went to the kitchen to start unpacking plates and silverware. / Bughuul paced back and forth, still watching his latest target. Due to recent events, the easiest way of getting the offering and blood sacrifice would currently be impossible. The atmosphere of his realm was darker, warmer, and more constricting than usual. His plan was foiled; the chain was broken. It was past time to restart the chain, and he had found the perfect house and candidate to do so. Ashley was perched on a flat rock, painting on a canvas, lovely scenes of murder. Suddenly, she heard Bughuul's voice in her head yelling her name. She shook her head, which was presently ringing with his telepathically vocal fury. She hopped off her seat and went to him, wiping her paint-tipped fingers on her smock. \"Yes... Sir...?\" she asked tentatively. If Bughuul picked favorites, she would definitely be one of his. She murdered her family in such a simple yet bloody way. She painted the walls gloriously with their blood, and filmed it all wonderfully. Her little sharpie drawing was a nice touch, too. He appreciated all manner of artistic sacrifices, and hers was one of the best quality. \"I apologize, my child,\" his telepathic voice said, more softly this time. \"I understand your frustration,\" Ashley replied with a sweet smile. \"So, what can I do?\" \"I've found a new target,\" Bughuul continued. With that, Ashley felt a dull burning sensation as he projected the life of Avery into her mind. \"I need you to gather some others, and get her for me.\" \"Yes, Sir. Who do you have in mind? And what about the other c-\" \"Forget the damn camera. I'm done with film.\" He said that so disgustedly, as if film hadn't been his go-to sacrificial aesthetic. It was as if it was now the most offending, vile medium. He had another camera, but for now, film would be a grim reminder of the one time his plan was foiled. Before he could torturously murder the Ex-Deputy, he needed a new soul for more power. \"I've had Frida plant the radio. She is going with you,\" Bughuul finished. \"Frida?\" Ashley asked. All she knew was this was Bughuul's first child of the modern age, and that was it. \"That would be me!\" A girl's accented voice sounded to the right of Ashley. She turned to a girl about her age, with light brown hair bound in two braids with bows at the end, icy blue eyes, and rosy cheeks. \"I put it in their attic, Father.\" \"As you should have.\" He turned back to Ashley. \"And you, you are to get a few other more... artistic ones. Musicians, artists, figure it out. Make haste.\" Ashley nodded and left to find some others. Frida smirked slightly at her \"sister\" and turned to Bughuul. \"Is that all, Father?\" Bughuul flicked his hand at Frida, who shrugged and left with a pout. / \"Are you excited to start school?\" Connor asked the children. At their new school, Reagan was to start first grade, Chance, fourth, and Avery, sixth. \"Yes! I can't wait to make new friends. But... I don't want homework,\" Reagan confessed. \"But yes, Daddy. I am.\" Connor smiled slightly. He eyed Avery, whose downturned eyes studied her food a little too carefully. Chance looked at her concernedly, and answered. \"Yeah, as I'll ever be.\" He added a cheezy grin and thumbs up. \"It isn't a lot...\" Chance whispered at Reagan, who giggled behind her mashed potatoes. \"And you...\" Connor asked. Avery felt his gaze on her, and it sent a chill down her back. \"Yes.\" \"Yes what?\" \"Yes, Sir.\" Avery forced herself to swallow the last bit of food before her nerves would make her lose it all. \"Good.\" Connor smiled slightly and turned to his wife as they began discussing each other's days. Reagan Grace patted Avery's hand softly before shoving half of a cookie into her mouth.[Chapter 2] \"Avery! Avery! Wake up.\" Connor shook her shoulder. \"Wake up.\" Avery's eyes slowly blinked open, and then widened. She shot up, fully awake, despite it being only five in the morning. \"Yes, Daddy?\" she asked with a slight waver to her tone. \"I have some boxes I need you to move upstairs before school, understand?\" \"Yes, Sir. I will.\" She sat in bed, making direct eye contact, just like he likes it. Connor impatiently cleared his throat. Avery threw her comforter off her body, the cold a stark contrast to the bundled burrito she was not one minute ago. Her legs shook slightly as she walked past her father to her door. \"Quietly. The others are still asleep.\" He noticed her shaking. \"Avery, sweetheart, is it too much of me to ask? Are you not a part of this family?\" \"Yes, Sir, I am a part of the family, and I'm glad to get to help.\" \"You seem so frightened. You know you don't need to be, don't you?\" Connor asked. If she didn't know any better, she would believe he sounded sincere. Avery nodded. \"Where are the boxes?\" \"Down by the couch. Thank you, Avery.\" \"You're welcome. Love you Daddy,\" Avery replied with a smile as he stood up. She swiftly made her way downstairs to be greeted by several bulky boxes labeled \"ATTIC\". She picked one up, struggled slightly, but managed enough to lug it up two flights of stairs without dropping it or hurting herself. After she got the fourth box up, she sat down on the ground, breathing heavily. Leaning her head back to crack her neck, Avery thought she heard some piano music. It started off faintly, but began to get louder. She stood up and looked around the room. The attic wasn't musty or spooky in the least. It could very well serve as a fifth bedroom if needed, and the guest would not feel uneasy. Avery located the source of the sound, finally. A strange-looking object, that resembled some sort of radio, sat on a small table near the window. That's strange , she thought. Avery walked closer to it, and touched it. The music sounded warbled, in a way. But still beautiful. Being a budding musician herself, she was interested in the tune. It sounded different from anything she had heard or played. However, since she knew nothing of HAM radios, or any old-fashioned technology for that matter, she didn't quite understand what was going on. She stood by it, listening to the melody, wondering if she could recreate it on her flute or the piano. The music fizzled out and stopped entirely. Avery almost jumped. She was still confused, but brushed it off. Maybe she could ask Chance about it. Her parents probably wouldn't approve of her snooping in a room that wasn't her own. / That didn't go according to his plan. She should have been much more entranced with the music and the radio. Even better, she should have been greeted by at least Ashley and Frida. But he knew the immature limitations of children. They were doing fine enough. Bughuul summoned Ashley again. It had been a day, earth time, and she still had not found all the children she should have. Ashley ran up to Bughuul and stood at attention in front of him. \"Yes, Sir?\" \"Why the delay?\" His voice inside her mind sounded impatient and infuriated. \"The child has already found the radio.\" \"Did she?\" Before Ashley could ask what happened, he burned the image of what just happened into her mind. \"Find them. Get them. Then get me that child.\" Ashley nodded firmly. \"Almost done, I promise.\" Ashley knew her fate along with those she'd bring along would rest in her hands, and her hands alone. If she failed on getting a full sacrifice from Avery, they would be exiled forever, just like Milo and the others. That was not going to happen, she would be sure of that. Not to mention, the entire realm was darker and more foreboding than usual, just because Bughuul was furious. He hadn't gotten a fresh, innocent soul in almost a year. Already, his plan for Avery was not working. \"I am not going to wait much longer. I cannot wait much longer,\" he announced, throwing his hand up. \"I understand. I just need one more, and then I'll bring 'em back to you.\" Ashley started to leave. Bughuul grasped her shoulder, bringing her back in front of him. \"Before you go, get someone to plant the box of films as well.\" \"But-\" \"She will need inspiration,\" he interrupted. \"Do you not agree, my child?\" \"That's true. Would you like me to take care of the films?\" Bughuul shook his head. \"One of the others can. I need you to finish recruiting.\" \"Yes, Sir.\" She looked up at him, her big eyes questioning, waiting for further orders. \"That is all.\" Ashley nodded and went back to finding the final child. It was incredibly hard to find artistic children who had kills focused on art mediums other than cinematography. But it wasn't impossible. / Avery scarfed down her breakfast, still replaying the radio tune in her mind. \"Whatchya thinking about?\" Reagan wondered. \"Nothing. I'm just sleepy is all.\" Not entirely a lie. \"Let's go,\" Victoria announced. \"Time for school.\" Enthusiastically, Chance and Reagan followed, with Avery walking behind slowly. Chance nudged her slightly, and she plastered an enthusiastic grin on her face. Here we go . They piled into the car, Avery sandwiched between her siblings. Reagan was babbling at a hundred miles a minute, while Chance actually nodded off, his head repeatedly bumping into Avery's shoulder. She had zoned off slightly, occasionally adding a smile or laugh to some nonsense sprouted by her sister. After they parked, Reagan Grace crawled over Chance and went out the door, waiting for her mom to walk her to her school next door. They separated from Avery and Chance with a quick goodbye. Trying to ignore the music in her head, Avery focused on the pit of nervousness budding in her stomach. Chance had already winked at some cute girl, being the flirt he is. \"See ya after school,\" Chance announced, heading to the building. Avery nodded, trailing him slowly and nervously. \"One more, one more,\" Ashley repeated to herself, trying to remember some of her siblings' sacrifices. She was so close, and time was running out. Who knows what would happen if she failed this simple step already. She wouldn't fail, she told herself. Then she remembered.[Chapter 3] thank you soooo much for the reviews/follow! I'm again legit surprised anyone noticed my stuff haha. :D Ashley finally had her group in tow. There was Cody, Evelyn, and Luke, along with Frida. \"How are they?\" she asked, a slight line of worry furrowed her brow. She knew there would be no punishment for recruiting the wrong kids, but she still wanted to please her father. Bughuul looked them over, recalling each one's method of killing and method of offering. \"Wonderful,\" he said, patting her cheek. Ashley beamed. \"Which one took care of the film box?\" Ashley motioned toward Cody, who raised his hand. \"I did. In the attic near the radio.\" \"Then you all are free to go. Remember, subtlety. She most likely will not follow you if you outright tell her what she is to do.\" \"Then how is she supposed to know?\" Frida asked. \"This is why you are not in charge of bringing her to me, my dear. Ashley understands.\" Frida scoffed at her sister. Ashley laughed at her before becoming sober again. \"I promise, Daddy, you will get all that you require.\" \"Mmm. Go.\" After he dismissed them, his pacing began again. He knew Ashley was capable and competent, but the others, he did not know as well. Even if they made great sacrifices, he wasn't entirely sure as to how well they would lure in Avery. All he could do is stand and watch, until he had to (or wanted to) intervene. / Avery walked cautiously into the cafeteria. She'd already had several classes, and nothing too daunting ...yet. She surveyed the room, full of chatty kids and cliques, none that she would ever be welcomed into. She went to get her food. Clutching the tray with moist palms, she walked along the edge to a table with no other occupant, save for a quiet, shy-looking boy. \"Can I sit here?\" Avery asked. \"Sure,\" he replied softly, barely looking up. \"Thanks,\" she replied with a smile. She set her tray down and sat. \"Dylan?!\" She could hardly believe her eyes. He looked up at her. \"Yeah...\" he said. \"Why?\" Avery's mouth gaped. \"No way! It's me, Avery. Avery Bowen, we were neighbors... Remember?\" He looked down at his food, and then back at Avery. \"Avery!\" he exclaimed, brightening up. \"I'm sorry. It's been so long.\" \"Yeah, it has. We were so little. Mom had another, her name's Reagan. You've got to come over some time. Chance would be so happy to see you guys again! How's Zach?\" Dylan's eyes dropped again. \"Um... Zach... he... he...\" \"Dyl?\" Avery looked at him concernedly. \"...house... fire. He... my dad's house... they both...\" That was the story they told. Both died in a house fire. Of course, there was fire involved. And a burning house. But neither Clint nor Zach died from the burning house. Pity lined Avery's face as she looked sincerely into her friend's eyes. \"Dylan, I am so, so sorry. I can't imagine how that must feel. Oh my gosh. I'm so sorry.\" Dylan shook his head. \"It's not your fault,\" he said soberly. \"So, you have a new sister?\" He would much rather talk about her life, anyway. She didn't have any cover stories she could worry about screwing up. Plus, it's nice to catch up with old acquaintances. Dylan hadn't had any luck with friends in his old school, even with Zach. Zach was able to make friends, but more of the wrong kind. Then, they both had to be homeschooled for a period, and always being on edge or on the run didn't help with finding other kids their age to befriend. He turned his attention back to Avery. Avery smiled. \"Yeah. She's six. She's the biggest bundle of joy ever. You'll love her.\" Reagan Grace was literally the highlight of Avery's life. She would be in a very dark place, she knew, if that sunshine didn't exist. \"I bet,\" Dylan exclaimed. \"So, you just moved here, then?\" \"Yeah. Couple days ago. For Daddy's work,\" Avery replied, taking a bite of food. \"They like the house a lot. It's alright. Can't complain, though.\" Dylan nodded, shoving his food across his plate. \"I hope we're able to settle down here. It's been hard the past few years.\" Avery knew what that meant. Her dad could get a bit intimidating, but he was nothing like Mr. Collins. She smiled at Dylan sadly, nodding slowly. \"We should really get together sometime. My family would love to have you over, if your mom is cool with that.\" Dylan smiled. \"Yeah, I'd like that. I haven't had really any friends, especially with all the moving.\" \"I understand,\" Avery said. Suddenly, she thought maybe he would be the best one to tell about the radio. It was still bugging her, the song buzzing in her head all day. / The brother that should have been dead, part of a ritualistic sacrifice to get Bughuul the innocent soul he needed, was now talking to Bughuul's target. Dylan could potentially say things that would influence Avery the wrong way. Bughuul would intervene and kill him, but that would be more trouble than it was worth. That would put up way too many roadblocks. Things had to go smoothly. He would take care of Dylan and his family eventually. But first, he needed Avery's innocent soul. And Ashley would not fail him in that endeavor, he had enough faith in her. He hoped that faith wasn't wrongly placed. / \"How was school, Avery?\" Connor asked, as he scooted his chair to the table. Avery shrugged. \"It was fine, Daddy. Remember Dylan Collins? From Ohio, when I was like five. He's at my school.\" Victoria smiled. \"I remember those boys. How are they doing?\" \"It's just Dylan, mama,\" Avery corrected with a sober tone. \"Zach and his dad died in a house fire, he said.\" \"Oh good Lord. That's awful,\" Connor sighed. \"Mmm... Really is,\" Victoria agreed, furrowing her brow. \"Wow.\" \"It really is. Anyway,\" Avery continued. She knew once her father asked her something, she had to answer completely and honestly. \"School itself went well. I like my classes and teachers. I did my homework already.\" That elicited a sincere smile from her father, which made Avery feel a bit happier with herself. Avery zoned out as Reagan Grace babbled all about her new friends and their art project and her teacher's pretty red hair. Chance, however, was less enthusiastic. Their words mingled with the music haunting her thoughts. \"Avery?\" Reagan asked, for the fourth time. \"Wanna play in my room?\" \"Oh,\" Avery replied, shaking her head. \"I'll do the dishes, and then I will?\" She looked to her parents for approval. \"Go play with your sister, hun,\" Victoria replied. \"You've had a busy day.\" Before Avery could express her gratitude, Connor cut in. \"No. If I had that mentality, I'd be out drinking with the guys, heading to work with a fucking hangover. Heaven forbid she help around the house, yes?\" He turned from his wife and glared at Avery. \"Do the dishes, put away the food, then you can play with Reagan until it's her bedtime.\" His voice got less stern as he spoke, which calmed Avery's on-edge nerves. \"Yes, Sir,\" Avery replied with a smile. She reached to start taking everyone's plates and utensils. It took nearly all of her willpower to force her hands to stop trembling. Reagan stifled a pout and went to her room. Chance went to his room, and the parents went to watch their crime drama as Avery was alone in the kitchen. Twenty minutes later, Reagan Grace came bounding down the stairs once she no longer heard anything in the kitchen. \"Done now?\" she asked excitedly. \"Yep! What do you want to do?\" Reagan ran to her drawer and picked out a piece of paper. \"I made you something for your wall,\" she explained. She handed Avery a picture of them and Chance, complete with grass, flowers, and giant butterflies. \"Do you like it?\" \"I love it!\" Avery exclaimed. \"I wanna put it up right now. Come help me!\" Reagan followed Avery to her room. Reagan looked around the room, scrunching her face in thought. \"I think, it should go by your door. So whenever you go out of your room, you see it, and think of me.\" \"I'll always think of you, Sunshine, but I love that idea.\" Avery reached for the roll of tape tossed on her floor and went to affix the masterpiece to the wall. \"Looks amazing, don't you agree?\" \"Yeah!\" Reagan screeched, a little too enthusiastically. She covered her mouth, wide-eyed, and burst out giggling. \"Shhh! They'll make you go to bed right now!\" laughed Avery. Reagan buried her face into Avery, still giggling. \"Ok, ok. You've got like ten minutes, what should we do?\" \"I dunno, what do you want to do?\" After a few volleys of that, they decided to go pester Chance, who was sprawled out on his bed, textbooks here and there, even though he was playing on the tablet he and Avery shared. \"What are you guys doing here?\" he sighed with fake annoyance. \"Daddy's gonna murder you if you don't finish your homework, bud,\" Avery said. Chance shrugged and went back to his game. Reagan bounded over to him and sat on his bed, bouncing up and down til he smacked her leg. Victoria came to the room with a smile on her face. \"What's going on up here?\" \"Nothin',\" Reagan Grace giggled, running to hug her mom. \"Good night!\" she exclaimed, grabbing Victoria's hands and leading her out. \"I'll be going to bed in a bit,\" Avery said. \"Love you, Mama.\" Victoria lightly squeezed Avery, placing a kiss on top of her head. \"Can you help Chance with his homework beforehand? Thanks, sweetie.\" Chance set the tablet down as his mom left. \"Let's do this thing,\" he announced, flicking his hand in the general direction of his homework. Avery plopped down beside him. \"Of course.\" / He hadn't let her mind be quiet for more than a second at any given time. Frida's song had been on repeat in the girl's mind, thanks to him. Not because he wanted to mentally torture her, but just so she would try to find a solution to fix it. And she would, he knew. There is no way that child would be content living with tinny piano music looping in her head for the rest of her life.[Chapter 4] Music. Music. Music. Avery tossed and turned, until she finally shot up in bed. Make it stop. It didn't stop. It wasn't in her head anymore. She looked up at her ceiling, and got out of bed. She headed to her door, glancing at Reagan's masterpiece with a smile. Peering out, she made sure her parents were asleep. It was 2 a.m., but you never know. She heard her dad's rhythmic snoring and headed opposite their room to the attic stairs. The piano music was getting louder. She wanted to wake up her siblings, but something told her not to. Slowly, she padded up the steps. The attic door creaked as she pushed it open. Two orange crescents were illuminated on the night table, where the radio was. She walked in, and quietly closed the door behind her. She flicked on the light, and walked towards the radio. Avery reached her hand out to touch it. \"Do you like my music?\" Avery gasped when she heard the voice. She whirled around. \"Your...m...music?\" \"Yes. I played that song. I'm Frida.\" \"I'm Av..er...y? I do like your song... it's been in my head all day. Who are you?\" Avery looked at the radio and back to Frida, who was suddenly surrounded by other children - two other girls, and two boys. Simultaneously, they all made a shushing gesture, and she suddenly felt very calmed. She felt that if she were to try to scream, she physically would not be able to. \"Where did you come from?\" she asked quietly. \"You'll find out eventually,\" a girl with long, red hair said. \"I'm Ashley. I hear you're an artist too?\" Avery didn't stop to wonder how this stranger already knew something about her. \"Yeah, kind of. I draw a bit.\" \"That's cool,\" Ashley replied. \"Our father is a big fan of art.\" \"You're... all siblings?\" Avery wondered. None of the kids looked remotely like each other. Maybe they're adopted. Ashley nodded. She looked at Cody and glanced her eyes at the film box. \"What's in the box?\" Avery asked. \"Why don't you open it?\" Cody, the barefoot boy with curly black hair and dark eyes suggested. He had swim trunks and a tee on. Avery knelt down in front of it, cautiously eyeing Cody and Ashley. She unlatched it and slowly opened it. It creaked tiredly until she finally swung it open full force. \"Are these... films?\" she asked. She repeated some of the names to herself. \"Did you make these?\" \"We did,\" Luke, a well-dressed, albeit a tad muddy, blond with a British accent said, nodding. Ashley reached in and picked hers up. House Painting '12. \"I did this one.\" Avery felt uneasy, yet curious. She had no idea what was on those tapes, and she didn't want to find out. But all at once, she was overcome with curiosity. Ashley heard her father's voice in her head. Subtlety. \"But it is awfully late for movies. We will stop by tomorrow?\" \"Don't leave,\" blurted Avery. \"I want to watch your film, Ashley.\" Frida was about to speak up, but Ashley shot her a look. She waited to see if Bughuul would give her any input. Nothing. \"Avery... Look, these tapes... Their names are kind of...\" \"Deceptive,\" lisped Evelyn, the youngest, who had large hazel eyes and shiny black shoulder-length hair. Ashley face-palmed. \"How so?\" Avery's eyes widened. Ashley felt the suffocation of her father's realm envelop her. The suffocation she'd feel if she failed. They would all be doomed. Exiled. Did Bughuul not send her to do the talking? \"Sometimes,\" Ashley said slowly, trying to formulate the correct wording in her mind. \"Things are put a certain way to be more... appropriate... for... others. These films are different than most home movies. It's not really something you watch and laugh about with your family.\" Avery paid no mind to the precaution. \"I want to see your film. Please.\" Ashley shook her head. \"Later. I promise, you'll get to see mine, and Cody's, and Evelyn's, and Luke's. And Frida has something else on that radio we'll show you in time.\" \"I want to see your film, Ashley. Why are you hiding them from me?\" Avery wondered. She was gripped with such fascination. She almost felt the evil surrounding the kids and the tapes. She almost wanted in. \"Avery, listen. You'll get to see them. I don't know if you're ready. They contain a lot... of graphic... violence... That's, uh, real?\" \"Like what kind?\" Avery wondered. \"Murder.\" all of the kids said in unison. They knew they had to slightly scare her off. Her curiosity levels were high, so they knew they'd get her to watch the films. What happened next took them off guard. \"I want to see,\" Avery replied soberly. \"I'm not afraid. My parents say violence and death is all over the world at all times. You can't get away from it.\" Ashley looked at her group. \"You're sure?\" Avery nodded. Is this what Bughuul had in mind? Maybe? Either way, Ashley had Luke and Evelyn set up the projector and screen. Ashley glanced at Avery one final time, but Avery's eyes were glued to the blank screen. The film started abruptly, cutting out right as the father got an axe to the head. Not a single response from Avery when she saw Ashley shushing. Nothing when the blood-painted walls were shown. Nothing when the kids were all on screen. Ashley flicked off the projector and looked at Avery, waiting for a response. \"You did that?\" Avery asked, fascinated. \"Your whole family? You killed them. What was that symbol? How did you paint with their blood? Can I see another?\" \"Slow down. That's all? You don't... you don't care? Avery,\" Ashley said, grabbing her shoulders. \"You need to understand, that was real. That wasn't just some fictional horror movie scene. I filmed that. I killed my family.\" Very subtle right there. Ashley hoped Bughuul hadn't been paying attention at that moment. \"I know. Why would a group of kids show up in my attic with creepy music, to show me old-fashioned fake movies? I can put two and two together. I'd like an explanation, and I want to see someone else's.\" \"He's going to love you,\" Ashley nearly gushed. \"He...?\" wondered Avery, uncertain. \"Our father,\" Ashley explained. \"Who's your father?\" prodded Avery. Ashley's eyes shifted to and fro uncomfortably. \"Mmm, I don't know if he wants us to tell you just yet.\" \"Why not? Same reason you were secretive about the videos?\" Avery asked, more curious than accusatory. Their expressions said it all. \"I would like to know. I'm kinda confused.\" \"I bet,\" Ashley replied, trying to laugh. She sighed. \"Ok. We call him Mr. Boogie, sometimes... but his name is Bughuul. He's, uh, not exactly ...human... maybe he'll let you meet him before he adopts you. That symbol you saw was his. We made those videos for him. After we do that, he adopts us, we go to his world, and live as one giant family. Sometimes, he has us go find other new siblings, like you.\" The only reason Ashley continued, is that Avery looked so eager and fascinated. 'He's going to love you.' That stood out to Avery more than any of that other stuff. \"So for him to adopt me... I have to do ...that?\" She couldn't bring herself to actually say \"kill my family\". Looking at the blank screen, and back to Ashley with wide, concerned eyes, she asked, \"What about Reagan and Chance?\" \"Bughuul chose you, Avery. And just you,\" replied Ashley, emphatically but apologetically. \"So... I...\" Avery wrung her hands together. Her two best friends, Chance and Reagan Grace. She loved them more than life itself. Was this worth it? \"Can I watch another one?\" \"Sure.\" Ashley looked at Luke, gesturing to the box. \"You're up!\" Luke went to the box and took his out. It read, \"Gardening '93\". He set it up and flicked on the projector. It started off with a family of four sitting in the grass, laughing. A scruffy little dog was bounding around. It panned to a young girl and her mom pulling weeds, and then to the dad and - apparently Luke - playing football. Avery thought nothing of the pitcher of lemonade on the patio table. Suddenly, the screen got darker as there were now deep, long holes in the ground. There were people in those holes. They were bound and gagged, but their eyes said it all. Someone was shoveling heaps of dirt into them. Occasionally, the shovel would whack down on a buried body. A few more shovels, and another scene change. The camera appeared to be set up somewhere in front, to show Luke planting flowers atop the filled holes. The final scene was a lovely, normal-looking new garden, with flowers and edged with cinderblocks. Luke showed up in front, doing the shushing gesture. The film ended. \"What did you think?\" Luke asked excitedly. Avery's expression was a little bit horrified, yet an equal mix of fascination and satisfaction. \"You did a nice job with the garden. That was creative. You both were extremely creative.\" Ashley was legitimately surprised at the accolades. \"Our father needs some sort of artistic medium along with the sacrifice itself. Usually just filming it would work, but we don't have a camera anymore. So we can't rely on cinematography anymore. That's why he had us come. Our sacrifices would have been just fine without them being taped.\" \"Why don't you have a camera anymore?\" \"Daddy doesn't want us talking about it,\" Ashley said a bit uncomfortably. \"Well, I think this is enough for tonight. We'll come back. You can see the rest of our tapes later.\" \"Alright,\" Avery said. \"You promise you'll come back?\" \"Of course. Oh, and Avery?\" \"Hmm?\" \"You cannot, I repeat cannot tell anyone about any of this, you understand? Else Bughuul will get very mad at us, and you. And we don't want that. So please ,\" Ashley pleaded. \"Not a word.\" Avery looked Ashley straight in the eyes. \"Not a word,\" she repeated fervently.[Chapter 5] Oh my goodness I am seriously so grateful for the amazingly kind reviews! Big hugs, -St0rmy The kids could make themselves invisible to Chance and Reagan, and continue haunting the house until they finally got Avery. But right now, they had to go back home. None of them were particularly worried, however. They seemed to be getting a hold of Avery quite well - if not too well. Still, the same dread that fills every child's body when their parents tell them they need to talk was present in each of them. \"Very blunt, are we, Ashley?\" Bughuul directed his telepathic conversation to Ashley alone, as her siblings stood by, oblivious to his side of the conversation. \"I was hoping you would intervene, but since you didn't, I used my best judgment,\" Ashley answered, eyes darting back and forth from Bughuul to the floor. She realized her tone was far too out of place. \"She could handle it...\" she said softly, back to a more childlike mindset. \"And you know that, how, exactly?\" Bughuul pressed. \"She's really curious,\" Ashley replied, shrugging. \"She... she was fascinated by it all.\" \"I know that,\" Bughuul said. \"Please,\" he said to all of them. \"If you scare her off, I've lost her. Understood?\" His children all nodded. \"When do I get to show her my music?\" Frida wondered. \"Stop acting like you're something special,\" Ashley muttered. \"You're last.\" \"Just because Father picked you to represent, doesn't mean you're better than the rest of us. Doesn't mean you're his favorite, either.\" \"Neither are you,\" Ashley retorted, half-inclined to stick her tongue out. Bughuul facepalmed. Damn kids . \"Ashley. Frida. You both know I do not 'play favorites'. Stop your incessant, annoying bickering. Now.\" \"Yes, Daddy,\" they said apologetically. The others quietly giggled at them. Bughuul turned to them sharply, and they straightened up. \"You all have been doing well, I must admit. However, keep the talking to a minimum, unless she initiates it. She sees the films, and that is all.\" / \"Avery! Avery!\" Reagan whispered harshly, shaking her sister awake. \"What?\" Avery mumbled. Her eyes slowly opened up. \"What time is it?\" She heard yelling from down the hall. \"Oh.\" Avery scooted to the side of her bed, flipping the comforter for her sister to crawl in. Reagan scuttled in, nestling close to her sister. Avery suddenly choked back a feeling of dread and sorrow. If she did what she was supposed to... No. Not now. \"You sleepy?\" \"Not really,\" Reagan confessed. \"I'm too scared.\" Of course, what child sleeps comfortably when their parents are shouting at each other? Avery found herself getting infuriated with them. How many times has this happened, poor Reagan woken up by their arguing very late at night? On school nights, no less? What was so important that they couldn't wait? \"What makes you happy?\" Avery asked. Every time they would play this game. Reagan Grace had an endless supply of what made her happy. The positive thoughts and the talking would drown out the yelling. And she would soon fall asleep. \"Ummm...\" Reagan's voice lilted. \"You and Chance. And puppies. Butterflies, cookies with sugar and icing, ice cream, baby bunnies, ummm... coloring, my fluffy pillow, drawing with you, school, my friends...\" \"Which ones?\" Reagan began listing all of her friends, kids, teachers, and family alike. She was asleep in no time. Avery couldn't fall asleep. She couldn't shake off the feeling that she was being watched. She probably was being watched. She slowly sat up in bed, looking around the room. She was about to exclaim Ashley's name when Ashley shushed and pointed at Reagan. She motioned for Avery to follow her. Avery nodded, and slipped unnoticed out of her room. \"Are we going to watch another film?\" she asked as they opened the attic door. \"Of course,\" Avery replied. \"Cody's is next.\" Cody smiled. \"I hope you like it.\" His reel read, \"Beach Day '04\". \"I know I will.\" Avery surprised herself at how quickly that came out. The film started off with a family of five enjoying the sunshine on a fairly empty beach. The water rushed over the youngest boy's feet, and he appeared to be having the time of his life. Then it showed the family making a sand castle, with Cody serving them drinks with little umbrellas. The film panned to a lovely sunset, but then it showed ropes tied to stakes in a boat. Ropes connected to giant hooks, meat hooks, that were being lodged into the parents' and little brother's mouths. Blood sprayed everywhere as they writhed in pain as the hooks were being jammed into their mouths, piercing into their skulls. They were then thrown overboard. The water roiled with their kicking feet as the camera panned back to the setting sun. The final scene was Cody, who shushed, then turned back to finish a graffiti mural of his family underwater with the hooks in their mouths. Above them was the symbol, painted in what appeared to be blood. End film. Besides exchanging approving glances, the other children were unusually quiet. Unbeknownst to Avery, it was because they had a lecture from their father. She turned to Cody and said, \"Interesting... I really liked your artwork. I've always wanted to learn how to do graffiti art.\" \"Maybe I can teach you later. I'm able to a lot at... our... place.\" \"That would be nice,\" Avery said. \"Daddy only lets me use pencils so it doesn't make a mess. I'd love to try any kind of paint.\" \"Your dad sounds like a real-\" Ashley slapped Cody's arm before he could finish. Avery's eyes darted downward. \"You want to see the last one?\" Ashley asked, quickly changing the subject. \"It's one of the best.\" \"I want to see!\" Luke announced. Evelyn smiled. \"Wait. Are we allowed to? Isn't it just one a day or something?\" \"We need to progress,\" Ashley whispered. She turned to Avery. \"I mean, if you want to...\" Avery nodded eagerly. \"Yes. I'd like that.\" Evelyn fetched her film, \"Campfire '13\", and set it up. The film began showing Evelyn first, surrounded by her large family. Her siblings ranged from nearly adult to toddler. Everyone was wearing cool-weather clothing. The trees around them were lovely shades of orange and red. There were a few shots of the campfire as it got a bit darker outside. It flickered on their faces as they smiled and laughed. Evelyn handed everyone hot chocolate. An older brother giggled as she tripped, nearly spilling the contents of the mug. She gave that one to him, sticking out her tongue. The scene changed a bit, to a shot of a treehouse before it suddenly cut to the family, laid out on the ground beyond the campfire. It showed Evelyn starting to douse her family with gasoline. One of the youngest siblings squirmed around, causing Evelyn to swiftly kick her in the head. The squirming stopped. Evelyn finished pouring the gasoline on them. She took a few sticks full of marshmallows, burnt and flaming. (\"Just like I like them,\" she whispered to the others.) The marshmallows were dropped on top of each family member. The scene cut back to the treehouse, and then to the view from the treehouse. It showed the burning family... the burning symbol of Bughuul. End film. Frida admittedly felt jealous that all she had was a musical recording on an old radio. That was impressive. Avery sat still hypnotized on the blank screen. \"Wow,\" she whispered. Fire... burning hot fire... lovely dancing flames. And the symbol. Deep inside, a part of her had already gotten inspiration from all these. Her mind snapped back to where she should be - back in her room, snuggling with her little sister. \"Good night,\" Avery said simply. She got up abruptly, brushing past the group and going downstairs.[Chapter 6] \"You ok?\" Dylan asked. \"Yeah, why?\" Avery replied. Dark circles engulfed the lower part of her eyes, which didn't seem to be able to focus on anything. Her mind felt fuzzy. It was replaying the kill tapes this time. At least the music was quieted for now. \"You don't look too good,\" he said, kind of concerned, kind of joking. Dylan hadn't felt quite this \"happy\" in a long time. He was glad his old friend was back. Yet all at once he was beginning to worry. The past few days she didn't seem quite herself. \"Thanks,\" Avery laughed. \"Hey... want to come over after school? My mom would love to see you again... and know that I'm actually making friends, ya know?\" Avery hedged. \"I would... but I need to be home by 4:30 to help with dinner. Where do you live?\" Dylan shrugged. \"See, we have some time. You know the golf course? Those houses there.\" \"Ok. We're like three, four minutes from there. Sure!\" Dylan smiled. \"Great.\" He held out his fist, which Avery bumped with her own. \"Meet up after class, k?\" Avery nodded in agreement, and they parted. [after school] \"Who's this?\" Courtney asked after greeting her son with a warm hug. \"Avery... Bowen. Remember them? From Ohio like... a lot of years ago.\" \"Connor and Victoria,\" Avery continued. \"And my brother Chance.\" Courtney's eyes sparkled once she remembered. She reopened the large front door, ushering them in. \"Avery, it's so good to see you again! You've grown so much, sweet pea.\" \"Yeah...\" Avery replied awkwardly. \"It's nice to see you again, Mrs. Collins. We have a new sibling, her name's Reagan. She's six. You guys should stop by some time. Mom and Dad would love to catch up.\" \"Definitely will work something out,\" Courtney agreed with a smile. \"What brings you all out here?\" \"Daddy's work. We haven't been in a place more than three years because of his job.\" Rapid footsteps approached them. \"What's the hurry?\" Courtney asked. \"I'll be back tonight!\" So&So; announced. \"See you,\" he said to Dylan who smiled with a slight head shake. \"Hi,\" he said to Avery. \"And bye. And goodbye to you,\" he added to Courtney with a quick kiss. He bolted out the door. \"Who's that? What's his deal?\" Avery asked, barely able to register what all just happened. \"Speaking of work...\" Courtney explained. \"This is a regular occurrence. Would you like something to drink?\" She had no desire to make up a cover story right now. \"No thank you,\" Avery replied with a smile. \"Alright. You two stay out of trouble. If you need me, you know where I am, Dyl.\" \"I know, mom.\" He motioned for Avery to follow him upstairs. She laughed and followed him, nearly tripping over a cat that was lying on the floor. \"I wish we could have pets,\" Avery sighed. \"Allergies?\" Avery shrugged nonchalantly. \"No. Mom hates them. I don't know why. Says three kids is far enough work. Especially me, oddly.\" \"You know you're welcome here any time if your mom gets too fed up. You can bring your brother and sister, too.\" Avery sighed. She knew Dylan understood, albeit at a much more intense level. She had so much bottled inside, she suddenly wanted to pour it out. But she couldn't. Not to Dylan, not to anyone. Not to anyone living , for sure. \"I'd like to, but... I doubt we'd ever be able to hang out with you for more than an hour. We don't really get social lives. Me especially. Anyway. Enough of that. What do you want to do?\" \"I dunno. What do kids our age do? It's been so weird lately. I don't know.\" Avery laughed softly. \"Agreed. Uh... I don't know either.\" They ended up watching tv. Actually it was more of Dylan watching while Avery was doodling on some scratch paper they'd found. \"Avery!\" She could barely hear his voice over the music blaring in her head. The tinny, haunting piano music was back. Dylan snapped his fingers in front of her pale, zoned face. He glanced at her paper and stumbled back with a gasp. \"AVERY!\" She came back to full consciousness, following his gaze to her paper. She flipped it over to hide it and stood up. \"Who is that?\" he asked, concernedly. Almost as if he knew... \"I dunno.\" \"Where did you see him, Avery?\" Dylan pressed. Avery shrugged. Her face was drenched with a cold sweat, but the color was coming back. \"I don't know. Why?\" \"It's weird to be drawing creepy things, is all...\" Dylan said, stumbling a bit over his words. He was hiding something also. \"I've... dreamt about him... ever since we moved here, ok? Do you know who it is?\" She knew he was hiding something, and she wanted to know what it was. Dylan took the paper from her, staring at her drawing. Staring at the incredible likeness of the face he had tried so hard to forget. The face that had haunted his dreams and his realities in that old farmhouse. The face of the one responsible for his brother's death. \"No.\" Avery didn't believe that. \"I need to go, Dylan. I'm... I'm sorry.\" \"I'll see you tomorrow.\" \"You wanna come over some time, maybe?\" she asked, trying to sound normal. Dylan shrugged but nodded. It wasn't Avery he was concerned about. Avery walked downstairs and into the kitchen. \"Mrs. Collins,\" she said. \"I've got to get going. Thank you for having me!\" \"Our pleasure, hun. You walking?\" Avery nodded. Courtney replied, \"No, no. Let me take you.\" \"You don't have to. I'll be fine. Thank you for the offer, though.\" Avery smiled and turned to leave. \"Bye, Dylan,\" she said as she left. Avery could not wait til bedtime. She hoped her parents would shut up, suck it up, and deal with it. She needed to talk to Ashley and the others. Tossing and turning, she waited until about midnight to go upstairs, drawing in hand. She needed an explanation. She stomped up to Ashley, whipping out her drawing. \"Is this your father? Is this Bughuul?\" she blurted. Ashley took the drawing and gazed at it with wide-eyed fascination. \"You drew this?\" Avery nodded. \"Wow. You've got a lot of talent. Why- what happened?\" Ashley realized she hadn't painted him in a while, and made a mental note that he would be her next art subject. \"I don't remember. All I remember is her-\" she pointed to Frida,\"-music blaring in my head, and I snapped back to regular consciousness and apparently drew this during that time.\" She sighed. \"I've been dreaming about him since we moved here,\" Avery added quietly. Ashley nodded knowingly. Ever since she first saw Stephanie, Bughuul had been in her dreams as well. He did that a lot, she knew. He would give most of his targets nightmares, but a few of them would actually see him in their dreams. \"You should show him. He loves this kind of stuff.\" \"No,\" Avery replied firmly. Apparently loudly, as well, judging by their surprised expressions. \"It's not good enough.\" she said, quieting her tone. \"I shouldn't show my art to others, anyway. I can't have pride.\" \"Did Connor tell you that?\" Ashley asked condescendingly. Avery nodded slowly. \"Well, Avery, this is really good.\" \"It really is, though,\" agreed Cody. \"It looks just like him.\" \"But... but what if he doesn't like it?\" Avery asked. \"What if he thinks I'm mocking him? And he punishes me? This is garbage, you guys. I just wanted to know if that was him or not. He can't see this.\" He had seen it. Her drawing was yet another portal to this world. He had not only seen it, he had been in it. He had been it. And he was proud of her work. It somehow soothed the fires of rage inside him, bringing him back to the more important matter at hand: the present events, and the soul. \"You should show him,\" Ashley repeated, handing the drawing back. All the kids' gazes suddenly swept over Avery, which caused her to slowly turn around. She gasped, stepping back into the group. Her dreams, her drawing personified. The tall, dark figure that loomed over her. Long dark hair, only dark marks for where his eyes or mouth should be. Imposing. Imperial. She was beyond terrified, but all at once, it made sense how they happily referred to him as their father. His presence didn't seem to scare the other children. Avery had to keep her whole body from trembling. He held his hand out. Avery kept glancing from her drawing to his hand to his face as she shakily handed it over. Avery glanced back at the others, and back to Bughuul. \"You drew this?\" he asked. His voice... she didn't hear it... she felt it. Like the music. He was in her head. An icy chill trailed down her spine. \"Yes... Sir...\" she replied, voice trembling. \"Avery, you did a wonderful job. You don't need to be afraid.\" He knelt down to her level. \"I will not hurt you.\" She believed him more than she believed her dad. \"I... know...\" she whimpered. \"I don't think that you do,\" Bughuul replied. Avery winced. Bughuul could tell she was frightened not just of him, but what he would think of her art. He could feel that intense desire for approval that she had, the approval and acceptance her parents never gave her. Avery stared into his blank eyes. No matter what, she knew, she had to make eye contact with those above her. \"I'm sorry... I do... I know.\" Bughuul felt a strange wave of pity. He knew a hurting child when he saw one. He had seen plenty over time. After they made their sacrifices and he \"adopted\" them, as they called it, they were happier. In the strangest way, they had a better existence. Avery was one of those children. He knew that being one of his ghost children would be better than being a child of emotionally distant and abusive parents. He stood back up. \"Do you mind if I hold on to this?\" Avery shook her head. \"Thank you,\" he said sincerely. Then he was gone. Avery stood in the middle of the room, blankly staring now at just the wall. \"Did he like it?\" she said slowly. \"You're kidding, right? He loved it!\" Ashley squealed. \"That's awesome, Avery!\" \"I want to go to bed now,\" Avery replied. Too much to process. \"You will come back tomorrow, right?\" Evelyn wondered. Avery shrugged. Ashley stepped closer to her. \"I know that was a lot to take in, alright? Good night, we'll see you later.\" \"Yeah, you will. Good night, guys...\" Avery rubbed her eyes and slowly made her way back to her room. The part of her that so yearned parental approval, parental acknowledgement beyond ordering her around, had a taste of what it wanted. She wanted more. She tried, and apparently failed, so hard to please. And here, some random drawing she made when she was in some weird trance, had gotten approval by her dead friends' father. She fell asleep quickly, forcing her thoughts away from Reagan Grace and Chance, away from anything related to her home, and forcing them towards her friends and the \"life\" they wanted her to have.[Chapter 7] It was no surprise to Avery that she did not wake up rested in the slightest. Groaning, she rolled out of bed to get ready. She felt anxious and nauseated, and overcome with a sense of pure dread. The turn of events, the decisions she could be faced with, it was all too much. She wanted to scream, she wanted to cry, she wanted to lash out. But she couldn't. She pushed all thoughts aside and ran into Chance's room. \"Wake up, dork,\" she exclaimed playfully, whacking him with a pillow. Chance rolled over to face her, his blue eyes puffy and bleary. He nestled back into his blanket with some attempt of saying \"go away\", but it was just a jumble of moans and groans. Avery hit him with the pillow again. \"You're gonna be late. Want me to get Reagan, then?\" The thought of a shrieking, energetic kid bounding onto his bed and jumping repeatedly to wake him up motivated him to get up on his own. Chance never was a morning person, in stark contrast to Reagan Grace, who was always raring to go. \"I'm up, I'm up,\" he said with a sleep-gravelled voice. \"Good.\" Avery ruffled his hair, to which Chance batted her hand away. She giggled and left his room so he could get ready. That, and the fact he looked like he could kill her, as he looked at anyone who woke him up. Reagan was babbling hundreds of miles a minute to Victoria, who offhandedly replied every so often. She was busy on her phone, work stuff, she'd tell the kids. Avery knew better, but she would always keep those thoughts to herself. She waved quietly to Victoria, and went over to Reagan Grace for her hug. \"Did you sleep well, Sunshine?\" \"Yep!\" exclaimed Reagan. \"Is Chance up yet? Can I get him up? Where is he?\" \"I just woke him up,\" Avery replied. \"He's grumpy as usual.\" They both started laughing. Victoria snapped her fingers at them, and they immediately quieted. Chance came plodding into the kitchen, looking a bit more awake than a few minutes ago. He grunted a \"good morning\" to Reagan before she could talk his ear off and poured himself some juice. \"I can't wait til I'm old enough for coffee,\" Chance whined. Which will be never , Avery thought suddenly. She shook her head quickly. \"Same here,\" she replied, clearing her throat. \"Will you shut the hell up?\" Victoria whispered harshly. They sealed their lips, secret laughter behind their eyes. / Bughuul wasn't particularly worried about Avery just yet. She had expressed some doubt on following through, but she was so thirsty for that parental approval her own parents refused her. The desperation could not be hidden from her eyes. He had a bunch of drawings and other artwork from his children, both before they were actually \"his\", and after he had \"adopted\" them. Avery's drawing of him was one of the most realistic, and he appreciated that. He would show her, too, once she got there. If she got there. Although Bughuul needed their innocent souls, and got said souls in a horrific way, he still loved his children dearly. He wasn't heartless. He would get overwhelmed at times if too many of them misbehaved, but he would never lash out at them. He would never hurt them, unlike so many of their human parents. That drove a lot of the kids to going through with the sacrifices, and he knew that would be a major part in Avery's motivation. The only setback she had, was that she was too close to her siblings. The films were doing their job, however. He wouldn't let her forget them. He wouldn't let the music stop plaguing her, either. The tapes were a part of his realm as soon as they were made. The cameras, the projector, the radio, all of them too were part of his dark realm. Of course they would corrupt the innocent souls. They were practically cursed. / Victoria finally put her phone away enough to shuttle the kids into the car and take them to school. Even then, she looked more annoyed than usual. Something was going on, Avery knew, but she wouldn't let on to any of them that she had an idea. Not like it would matter soon. . . There was no visit from Ashley's group that night. There was no shortage of dreams, though. The music wouldn't stop playing. Bughuul was in her dreams too, but she was less frightened of him than the last time. There was a lot of fire, too. Fire and blood. There was a numbness creeping into her psyche. A dissociation. She wanted to watch more films, even though the films and additional gore inundated her dreams. She wanted it over. Avery sat up suddenly, waking herself up fully from her dreams. She glanced at her clock before slowly stepping out of her bed and heading to Reagan's room. The door squeaked ever so slightly as she gently pushed it open. She crept slowly into her sister's room, trying not to disturb her as she laid down on the comforter. How could she do this to her? To Chance? Avery swallowed hard, nestling onto the pillow. Reagan stirred a bit, her eyes opening slightly before murmuring \"Hi Avery\" before drifting back to sleep. She couldn't do this. Could she?[Chapter 8] Avery came home from school that afternoon, looking like death (as Chance so kindly put). Her face looked abnormally pale, and her eyes had rather prominent dark circles under them. \"You ok, Sweetie?\" Victoria asked, putting dinner in front of Avery for once, instead of the other way around. \"Yes ma'am. I didn't sleep very well last night, is all,\" Avery answered. \"Thank you for making dinner.\" All day, she was plagued with the music, the films, the internal turmoil. She felt ill as it were, but she suddenly felt more distant from her family. She wanted to see what Frida wanted to show her on the radio. She wanted to see the others. She wanted her family to shut up so she could hear herself think. She wasn't thinking like herself, though, and she didn't realize it. Avery barely felt Reagan poke her until the tenth poke, that was followed by her exclaiming, \"Hey, Avery?\" \"What do you want?!\" Avery growled, slamming her fist on the table. Before she realized what she had done, she saw giant tears welling underneath Reagan's large brown eyes. Reagan's lower lip started to quiver as a lone tear strayed down her cheek. \"You bitch . Go to your room. Now.\" Disgust oozed throughout Connor's voice as he shot up. \"Connor, wait-\" \"Shut up, Vic. Let me handle this.\" Victoria rolled her eyes as she looked down at her food, then quickly back to her other two children. \"I'm sorry...\" Reagan whispered, tears now falling for her sister instead of herself. Victoria shook her head. \"You didn't do anything wrong.\" Avery slipped up to her room, remorse and fear welling up in her throat. Her dad had never called her names before. But she had never made his baby Reagan cry before. Avery made her way to her room, followed closely by her father, who slowly closed the door behind them. Silently, Connor motioned her to sit on the bed. He stared at her silently for several long seconds before finally speaking slowly and quietly. \"What the hell was that?\" \"I...I don't know, Daddy,\" Avery replied, voice quivering. \"What the hell were you thinking? You made her cry, Avery. She never cries. Ever.\" His voice was too calm. His stare was too deep. \"You call her 'Sunshine' for a reason.\" \"You make me cry, too, but you don't give a damn,\" she replied softly. Where did that come from? Avery barely felt his hand across her mouth, or the stinging after. She barely tasted the twang of blood. But she looked at her father with such hurt and shock. Never had he hit her before. \"Who do you think you are to use that kind of language, Avery?\" Connor's voice had only slightly risen. \"I give you a room, a roof, clothes, food, an education. You have toys, electronics, friends, what more do you want, kid? What more do you want?\" He had finally reached a yell, which was somehow less frightening to her. For you to love me. \"Nothing, Daddy. You're right...\" Avery started to cry. \"I'm sorry. I'm really sorry, Daddy. I don't know what's gotten into me.\" She looked into his eyes, forcing her tears to cease. \"Please... forgive me. I promise I'll work really hard on my behavior. I swear.\" Connor nodded slowly. \"You need to watch yourself,\" he said coldly. \"Yes, Sir. Can I apologize to Reagan?\" \"No. You are to stay in your room until the morning. As you know, I leave for work at five. I'm not going to work hungry. Thank you.\" With that, he left, slamming the door behind him. Avery didn't know if she was truly sorry or not. At this point, all that mattered to her was that her father had been verbally, and now physically, abusive. And Bughuul wouldn't be. At ten, Avery crept out of her room, only to run into Reagan. \"Sunshine, what are you doing up?\" \"Are you mad at me, Avery?\" she asked. \"No. I'm not.\" Avery knelt down, instinctively covering her lip with her hand. \"Reagan, I am so sorry for how I treated you at dinner. That was wrong of me. I'm just going through stuff right now, but that's no excuse. Do you forgive me, Rea? Please.\" Reagan nodded excitedly, tackling her sister in a hug. \"I'm sorry I was being annoying...\" \"You weren't. I promise. Now get back to bed! I'll see you in the morning.\" \"Okee dokes! Love you, Avery.\" Reagan blew a kiss to her sister. \"Love you more, Sunshine.\" Avery watched her sister go back to her room. She kept switching from her father to her siblings and back again. The back of her mind brought forth her potential father and potential siblings, however. Turning towards the attic, Avery made her way slowly up the stairs. She was ready. \"Sorry about what happened with your dad,\" Ashley said. Avery turned her face slightly away from Ashley. \"It happens. Can we get this over with?\" she asked impatiently. \"Frida's music, you mean? Yeah. Sure.\" Frida beamed. \"Tell me about it,\" Avery told her. \"About what you did, and how it works. All that stuff.\" \"Well... you'll have to listen first, then you get the explanation. Deal?\" Frida asked, almost uncertain. Avery looked too dark. Frida was almost afraid of what she would do. Avery shrugged. \"Yeah, whatever. I just want to get this all over with, ok?\" \"You ok?\" Cody wondered. Ashley socked him in the arm, shooting him a look before he could complain. Avery followed Frida to the end of the room, where the radio sat. Frida's presence in and of itself brought the radio to life. She moved one of the dials slightly, and her music started to play. Frida's voice reciting numbers was intermixed with the tune this time. But Avery instinctively covered her ears. The music had haunted her for too long. But then, she heard screaming. And she heard a voice, Frida's voice. And more screaming. The screaming stopped entirely, and was replaced by more music, accompanied by Frida singing. The tune changed slightly, until there was a static, and silence. \"That was when he came to get me,\" Frida explained. \"So, I had my family all tied up, right? And I was playing my little piano for Bughuul, but Mama wouldn't stop screaming. How could he possibly hear me over that racquet? So, I bashed her head in!\" Frida said with an innocent smile that would have sent chills over any sane person. Evelyn smirked approvingly. Sounded just like her annoying little sister. \"What about the others? How did they die if he got you?\" \"They were left to bleed out, like Mama would have been ...if only she stayed quiet. There's more. You want to hear them?\" \"More?\" \"Yeah. A couple others in Norway used the radio after me,\" Frida replied. \"But you don't have to hear them.\" She couldn't hide the eager look behind her eyes. \"Sure, just one more,\" Avery replied. It started with some sort of odd music from a stringed instrument, also accompanied by someone reciting numbers, before adult screaming interrupted it. The child yelled something that only Frida, obviously, understood. There was a whirring sound, like a drill, as the screaming became louder and stopped entirely. Then there was static. Frida explained to them all what they just heard. \"So, that was Eirik. He was playing some song, and his parents screamed in pain. He had nails all over their bodies, he told me. He told them to shut up so he can finish his song for Bughuul. They wouldn't, so he drilled through their eyes. He's pretty cool,\" she said to Avery. \"You'll like him.\" \"I bet.\" Avery stared at the radio, gently running her finger across it. \"So how did you get Bughuul to hear that?\" \"It's a certain frequency. Transmits it to his realm, where he hears it all. It's simple, really.\" \"So, what? I play music for him while my family is dying?\" Avery asked. \"How am I supposed to do that without being a copycat?\" \"You have your own unique flair,\" Frida replied. \"You'll think of something.\" \"And don't chicken out,\" Luke said. \"Or we're all doomed.\" \"What do you mean?\" Avery asked, before Ashley could scold him. \"Last time, this kid only managed to kill his dad, and then he got Mr. Boogie's camera broken, and then Mr. Boogie killed him and burnt the house down. The kids who tried to get him all got exiled, so they can't play with us anymore.\" \"Shut up , Luke!\" Ashley whined. \"But,\" she turned to Avery. \"It is true... it's bad for all of us if you don't do it.\" Avery shrugged. \"I will. I just... is there a way to make it less... painful... for Reagan and Chance?\" \"Depends how you do it,\" Ashley replied. \"Give them enough of this, and they will be fine.\" She held out a bottle of glowing green liquid. She didn't know how it worked, if it paralyzed the victim, or knocked them out, but anything to soothe Avery's doubts. Ashley couldn't let herself and her siblings get exiled. She couldn't disappoint her father. \"You put it in their drinks,\" Evelyn explained. \"Well, I'm making dinner on Saturday...\" Avery said offhandedly, studying the bottle in her hands. It was Thursday. \"Perfect,\" Ashley said. \"You'll do fine.\" \"What if he doesn't like it?\" Avery wondered, her soft side coming back momentarily. \"Make sure he does,\" replied Ashley simply. \"That. Isn't. Good. Enough. How can I make sure he likes what I do? How can I make sure Bughuul adopts me?\" Desperation riddled Avery's voice. \"Bughuul isn't critical like Connor, or any human for that matter. You saw how he responded to your drawing. Just make sure you complete the sacrifice, along with some sort of artistic something. 'k?\" Avery exhaled deeply. \"Alright.\" She ran her fingers around the bottle. \"Alright,\" she repeated, as if trying to reassure herself this was the best decision.[Chapter 9] One more chapter after this! Thank you guys for the support, it makes me soooo happy! xoxo, -St0rmy There was a slight wave of doubt in Ashley and Frida, especially. Avery was very well capable of going through with this, as long as she stayed in that mental state long enough. But if, for one moment, she thought of her siblings, it could snap her out of it and she would stop. \"What else can we do ...to ensure she successfully completes this?\" Frida wondered. \"Just see how it all goes...\" Ashley replied, out of ideas. \"And if it doesn't go?\" \"Then we're all exiled. And she's killed.\" \"Ouch. What makes you think she won't?\" Luke wondered. Ashley shrugged. \"I loved my brother, too. That didn't stop me. I just hope it's the same with her.\" / Avery had set down the steaming plate of food just as she heard Connor's footsteps approach the kitchen. He sat down without a word and began to eat. \"Is there anything I can get you, Daddy?\" Avery asked, trying to get emotion in her voice. \"I'm fine.\" Avery started to clean up the dishes, when Connor told her to stop. He had barely woken up, and clanging of pans weren't helping. Humbly, Avery quietly set the dishes down and went to her room to finish getting ready. Avery rinsed her eyes with cold water, and stared at her reflection. She barely recognized herself. And it wasn't just because of her lip. She began braiding a strip of her long blonde hair, and fastened a small bow on top. She heard that her dad had finished up downstairs, and immediately rushed back down to clean up. \"Was everything ok?\" she asked. He shrugged. \"Could be worse. Thank you, though. I do appreciate it,\" he said coldly, as if she were somehow forcing him to respond. Connor brushed past her, and left out the garage. Avery zoned out as she was washing the dishes. She thought about last night, about the radio, about what they had said. \"Avery?\" came Reagan's voice a ways behind her. \"Oh, hey, Sunshine.\" \"Who were you talking to last night?\" Avery's stomach dropped. \"What do you mean?\" she asked, trying to sound as innocent as possible. \"Upstairs.\" \"I don't know what you're talking about, Reagan Grace...\" Avery replied. She had been loud a few times. But Reagan should have been sound asleep. \"You want some breakfast?\" Reagan was six. She should have the attention span of a gnat. \"It's Friday, which means you can have your Fruity Pebbles.\" Please work, please work. Reagan's eyes lit up. \"Yay!\" she exclaimed, running to the pantry to get her cereal. Avery sighed a sigh of relief as she watched her sister scuttling around getting her bowl, spoon, and milk. \"The heck, man... why are you always so energetic?\" Chance whined, coming into the kitchen. \"Hey, Avery.\" His sleepy smile was immediately wiped off his face when he saw his other sister. He hadn't sounded that cold to her before. Of course her family should be alienating her for make Reagan Grace cry. She would have alienated herself if she... if she cared. Reagan didn't mind. She probably didn't remember, and she never held grudges. She would have grown up to be such an amazing person, Avery thought. Too bad the world will never be reached by her sunshine. \"You want something to eat?\" Avery asked Chance. \"No. I got it.\" He brushed past her to get his food. \"Chance...\" she said softly. \"I'm sorry, ok?\" He turned to face her. He glanced over at Reagan Grace and lowered his voice. \"I- come here.\" He took her arm and led her to the foot of the stairs. \"I had a nightmare last night.\" The way he said that made Avery's stomach drop. Chance lowered his voice to a whisper. \"There was a dark man in my room, in my dream, and he led me out. Downstairs, Mom and Dad and... Reagan... were all... tied up.\" Avery willed herself to hide any emotion besides innocent shock. \"And?\" \"You came towards me. Then I woke up. It felt so real, Avery. What happened to you?\" He walked back to the kitchen. Something told her he didn't mean the \"her\" in his dream. She felt nauseated. Victoria interrupted her thoughts when she came bustling down the stairs. \"Why are you just standing there? Go get your bag.\" She made it a point to be disgusted then avoid eye contact with the welt on Avery's lip. \"Yes ma'am.\" Reagan tossed her plastic bowl into the sink and ran to hug her mom, who was still eyeing Avery. Chance noticed, and looked at Avery as well, but more of a pitiful and fearful look. The fear didn't go unnoticed. Did the others' siblings act this way before they made the sacrifice? At school, Avery heard nothing that anyone said. Her head was literally buzzing the whole time. Frida's music didn't sound like music anymore. It was distorted, warbled, and deafening. She ate nothing. The only sane thought in her head was, \"You'll be better after you do it.\" She believed it. Avery finally believed everything would be better there. If this is how her life would be, and the only way to stop it was the sacrifice, she would stop it. She would make the sacrifice. \"Avery?\" Dylan asked. His voice sounded as if she were underwater, and he was above the surface talking to her. \"What happened?\" \"You know what happened,\" she replied, laying her hand on her mouth, slightly shielding the mark. She hadn't cared all day. \"I'm sorry,\" he replied with downcast eyes. He sat down next to her with his food. Avery looked deep into Dylan's eyes, and something about that stare made him incredibly uncomfortable. She studied his expression for a moment before uttering, \"It wasn't a house fire.\" Dylan broke eye contact to stare down at his tray. \"What do you mean?\" It took a lot of willpower to hide the shakiness that threatened to eke into his voice. Avery stood up suddenly, holding onto the table for balance. \"You know what I mean, Dylan,\" she mumbled, making her way to the door. He sat there, staring at her wide-eyed. \"Avery!\" he called out. She turned around slightly, without a word. \"Do you and Chance and Reagan wanna come over tomorrow? Mom said it's fine...\" Avery stared at him again, judging whether or not he was asking because he knew, or because he was concerned and wanted her away from her parents. She figured it was a bit of both, but kept her composure. \"I'd love to, but... we're going to be busy tomorrow. Sorry.\" She turned back and left before he could say anything else. The house was empty. Chance had a game, and she, their demon-child, wasn't invited. She didn't mean to make Reagan cry. But of course, Connor had the house turned against her. After her chores, she slowly made her way upstairs, wondering if this is what being drunk felt like. \"Ashley? Frida? Any of you?\" she called out. Instead, it was Luke who showed up. \"Hi, Avery - whoa. You look awful.\" \"Thanks. I feel it.\" \"It will get better,\" he said. \"Once you do it. You won't feel sick anymore when Mr. Boogie adopts you.\" \"I know,\" Avery replied. \"Where are the others?\" \"They're coming,\" Luke replied. \"You should sit down. You seriously look unwell.\" \"I know I do,\" she replied petulantly. She sat down anyway. \"You've already told me.\" She said that in a more teasing way, even though she hardly felt in the joking mood. When the others got there, they didn't bother hiding their reactions to her. \"This time tomorrow, you'll be better,\" Ashley encouraged her. \"Did any of you feel or look this terribly?\" Ashley nodded and replied, \"Most of us did.\" \"Do you know what you're gonna do?\" Frida asked. \"With your sacrifice.\" Avery rubbed her temples. \"I do. I think. I hope it will be good enough.\" \"It will be,\" Ashley replied. \"He is looking forward to adopting you. Everything is starting to feel better back home. You will feel so much better tomorrow evening, Avery!\" \"I know.\" Avery stood up slowly. \"I think they're back.\" She stepped closer to the door to listen. \"I'll see you-\" \"Tomorrow. Tomorrow night, you'll see us at home.\" As they faded away, Avery suddenly felt anxious. She would never see them again if she failed. A lump formed in her throat. They would get exiled, her family would be murdered more gruesomely than she had planned, and she would die without a father who loved her. She crept out of the attic. She snuck to her room, and walked out normally. No time for interrogation as to why she was in the attic. Avery wouldn't sleep that night even if she could. She had to make the final preparations, her head was throbbing and buzzing, and she was anxious yet excited. Late that night, she had disabled the last of their smoke alarms, and was eternally grateful Connor hadn't set up the appointment with the home security company yet. And he never will. After she had made the technical preparations, she worked on her drawing. It wouldn't be complete until dinner, but she decided to get a headstart so she wouldn't be using valuable time later. Bughuul's realm had gotten significantly less hot, stifling, and overall unpleasant feeling. He played no major part in Avery's condition, and he was glad. Whatever happened, he could not be more proud of. He hadn't had one of his targets be this way in a very long time, so this was promising. He would have his sacrifice, his soul, his daughter, tomorrow evening.[Chapter 10] Final chapter! Thank you guys soooooo much for your support! It makes me sososososo happy! -St0rmy The radio was set on the window ledge next to the piano, and there was a aura of darkness radiating from it. Soon, it would have a new tune after being inactive for over forty years. \"Dinner is almost ready, and Daddy's home soon,\" Avery told Reagan who came running into the kitchen to ask about food. \"Why don't you go bother Chance?\" Reagan happily obliged, not seeming to notice the deathly-cold nature of the dismissal, and ran off to find her brother. \"That smells-\" Connor started, as he came through the door. He muttered \"Oh, it's Saturday.\" under his breath, but Avery still heard him. \"It's almost ready.\" She wasn't allowed to eat with them, Connor had said. Not that it mattered. It worked great for her plan. \"Mmm, alright.\" He walked through the kitchen to get upstairs to change and shower quickly before dinner. Avery turned back to the food, a smile slowly making its appearance on her face. Connor came back down, soon followed by Victoria, and Reagan chased Chance into the dining room from the family room where they were watching a movie. Avery set their plates down at their respective chairs, and spread side dishes along the center of the table. She headed to get their drinks, pausing momentarily before grabbing them. This is it. Avery set their glasses - and Connor's beer bottle - down. \"I'm going to go draw,\" she said simply, not caring if she wasn't allowed. She startled a bit when the radio flashed on as she came near it. She sat down on the ground and recited her numbers as she drew. Her drawing was green flames with a white space in the middle, where she would paint his symbol. Underneath that was her family, all lying down, dead, but looking peaceful. The timing was perfect. As soon as she set her pencil down, she heard a fall and clanking of dishes. It didn't take long. She heard sudden outcries that were cut short. She heard a small body fall to the ground. Avery breathed in and out deeply before getting up slowly and going to the closet where she stored everything she needed. / The Bowen family was laid out in an X-shape, bound with duct tape on their mouths sacks on their heads. Surrounding them were stacks of birch logs, the ones Victoria wanted to decorate the fireplace with off-season. Avery doused the logs with methanol before sprinkling roach killer - boric acid - on them. The radio's eerie orange glow lit up the large room. Avery went over to Chance first, clutching a large butcher knife in her hand. Her knuckles were white. She slit his throat swiftly before moving to Reagan Grace. Another swift, deep slash. Ripples of velvety-red flowed from their small necks. Victoria was conscious still. So was Connor, as he mumbled and thrashed about trying to figure out what was going on. Avery dragged the knife across Victoria's neck slower than with her siblings, watching the blood trickle before moving on. Avery stepped over to her father. She knelt next to him as she ripped the sack off his head. His eyes were wide with sheer terror. She ripped the duct tape off his mouth. \"What did I ever do to deserve this?\" Avery asked quietly, before Connor could react. \"Why do you hate me so much, Daddy? All I've ever done is love you and try to be good!\" There was no hatred in her voice. Only hurt. \"Avery... I...\" She shook her head slowly to silence him. \"I just wanted you to love me.\" She glanced down at him, tears slowly cascading down her face. \"I'm sorry.\" Slowly, she dragged the knife across his neck. That stopped her tears from falling. Her sacrifice was almost complete. She let the blood trickle for a few seconds before letting it collect it in a small bowl. Avery lit matches now, and set fire to the logs. The chemical flames danced with a glorious green, and she smiled. Green was her favorite color. And now it symbolized more. It symbolized freedom. Freedom from pain, freedom from hatred. She had a paintbrush that Ashley had lent her, and she would use Connor's blood for the rest of her artwork. She was inspired by Cody, in a way, and painted in great detail Bughuul's symbol. She took a deep breath and sat down at the piano and started playing. Her song was eerie, haunting, and melodic. Unlike anything she had learned from her lessons. It was better. Her talent was never appreciated by her parents, but this time, her song wasn't for them. Her music rang through the house, and through the radio into Bughuul's realm. He heard it, he let Ashley and her group hear it. It was dark and moody and absolutely breathtakingly beautiful. She played until she noticed the radio was off. Now what? \"Ashley? Frida?\" Avery sounded concerned. She started coughing, now, as the house had been getting smoky. Slowly, her trance began to fade. \"Bughuul?\" she uttered, as if saying his name would make her face the inevitable. She was alone. \"Wait, what did I do wrong?\" she said, half to herself. \"I did everything I was supposed to, didn't I?\" she yelled into the radio. \"Everything!\" she turned back to her family. \"I did this...\" she walked over to Chance and Reagan Grace, horrified, wincing at the large slashes in their necks. Stifling a gag at the pools of blood surrounding them. \"I-I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry! I hope you knew how much I loved you two. I-\" she choked down a sob. \"I'm sorry.\" That would be her goodbye. Her knife was down by Connor. There was no other option, she thought. She didn't realize her drawing was gone. She bent down to pick up her, knife, coughing violently from the smoke, letting the tears flow. She stood up slowly, glancing at the knife. It glistened in the dying flames. She had to do it now, before the police came. Suddenly, Avery felt a hand on her shoulder. Immediately, she dropped the knife, knowing who it was and turned into him, sobbing. She wrapped her arms around him; he didn't scare her anymore. Bughuul gently returned her embrace and let her cry for a few before he shushed her. \"Avery.\" His voice, calm and soothing, beckoned her to look up at him. \"You're alright now. You're safe.\" \"What did I do wrong? I tried so hard!\" \"You did nothing wrong, Avery. I am so proud of you - you did more than I expected. Thank you.\" \"Really?\" she asked, voice shuddering with cries she tried to stop. \"Why didn't you come? I-\" He shushed her softly. \"Are you ready to go home?\" Avery swallowed hard and nodded slightly, wiping her tears with the back of her bloody and sooty hand. \"You mean, you're going to adopt me?\" Bughuul lifted her up then, and she felt comforted and loved in his arms, something foreign in her relationship with Connor and Victoria. \"Yes, I am.\" After a few steps, Avery began to feel sleepy, but no longer sick. She could breathe again. They were home. At that moment, everything was alright. Avery would be free, safe, and loved. Now that the ritual was complete, Bughuul's realm would be calm again. Right then, everything was perfect for father and new daughter. Avery rested her head on him, blinking heavily. \"I love you, Daddy,\" she whispered. \"I know you do,\" Bughuul replied. \"I love you too, my child.\" This time, the music wasn't in his head, he was sure of it. The eerie, mournfully haunting music now had a tangible source. He slowly got out of bed and crept to his desk. A wave of terror rushed over him as he looked at the HAM radio sitting there. He looked at it confusedly as a wave of dread rushed over him. \"Such a shame...\" came a voice behind him. He whirled around. \"You're all alone again, Dylan.\" A sinister smile was spread across Avery's face. Several of her siblings materialized beside her. \"But you don't have to be.\" ","Summary":" Hello hello... another Sinister fic yeeeee. I started this in like September and finished it a few "},{"Movie":"Sinister","Title":"Sinister III","Author":"Taliyatwo","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11466019","Passage":"[Chapter 1] Sunlight illuminated the floor as the girl entered the room for the first time. Small specks of dust were sparkling in the air as her body motion made it move. The room hadn't had another human being in it for a few years, nobody dared to enter it because of the atmosphere it gave. Yet, now this family was bold enough to enter it despite warnings they had received from many people. She hummed quietly, pointing one toe as her foot made a half circle shape on the floor. A small smile appeared across her face as she took a small skipping step, noticing the grip her sock was getting. The hard wood was exactly something she wanted. \"Oh my god, would you look at that.\" Her mother entered the room with wonder in her voice. \"The design is exactly as we imagined, it's perfect!\" She came closer to Brandy, embracing her small body with her warm one. \"What do you think hun?\" Her long fingers gestured towards the whole room. Overall, it was pretty spacious, compared to the last house this one could work more. Brandy took little delicate steps with a purpose to them as her eyes studied the room. \"I like it.\" A soft voice flowed from her mouth as her eyes darted back and forth. Her mother came closer again, placing her hands on the girl's shoulders to encourage her. \"That's what I thought.\" Her mother didn't try to hide the pride placed on her face.\" I was thinking we could put the mirrors all around on these walls, they're very smooth and it shouldn't be difficult to find a good size. Brandy moved up one side of her lips in agreement. \"Oh!\" Her mother exclaimed, placing a hand on her protruding belly. \"I think the baby agrees too.\" She made small circles on her belly to calm the baby. A small giggle escaped Brandy's mouth while making rare eye contact with her mother. \"Now how about we help the rest of your brothers and sister with their things?\" Brandy nodded rapidly, placing the dance box on the floor so she could carry more things. She did her special dash, which was a mixture of skips and hops, out of the room to the moving truck. As her foot steps echoed away, the smile on her mother's face seemed to slip off it. She sighed with a small mutter to herself. \"What have I done? What have you done Donna?\" Talking to herself wasn't a solution, but it made her feel better when there was no one else to talk to. She didn't want to move, but the nursing job here was a good opportunity for the family and with a new child coming, there was no room in the old house. Besides, bad memories from that house didn't help with their family life, things were stressed and restarting was the best way to fix it all. \"Mom!\" She glanced to the floor, completely unaware of the yell as she explored her thoughts. There was a want for something more, for something to fix the mess they were in. She gasped quietly as her son hit the wall to get her attention. \"Mom! Matthew threw the ball on the top shelf and I can't reach it!\" Riley exclaimed loudly. He ruffled his messy blonde hair nervously as he gawked at her. \"Did you break anything?\" She asked suspiciously. She could tell he was guilty by the look in his eyes. Riley shuffled his feet side to side. He shook his head quickly with hands hidden behind his back. Sneakily, he fluttered his eyes up at her in hopes she would drop it, but was only greeted with stern expression . \"Just a small light, we didn't mean to.\" She nodded as she considered how bad the damage really was. Her older daughter appeared from around the corner, holding two stacked boxes to move to her own room. \"Carly, will you help your brother get the baseball? \" she asked as a quick solution. The light wasn't a big deal, they could buy one later when they traveled to the department store. Carly let out a dramatic bit of air from her in nose, looking to the ten year old who seemed hopeful. \"Fine, where is it?\" She answered reluctantly, out of all the kids, she seemed most upset about the move. Especially since she had to leave her high school full of friends made all the way from elementary. When her mother mentioned the plan to move, Carly argued more than all the other kids. She threatened to run away and even mentioned killing herself. Something Donna found over dramatic since this house was a few hours away from the old one. It took almost two weeks to finally convince the girl the move was the only choice they had. \"Living room, top shelf.\" Donna answered as the teen took no time to think once she received her answer. Carly stalked to the other room, leaving her brother little time to gather himself. \"Oh and take your toys to the back Riley, we don't need to be breaking more expensive things.\" Riley nodded as he moved to follow his sister. Donna gave one more inspecting stare of the room before she moved back to get more boxes into the house. Brandy's POV We finally finished getting the boxes into the house around dinner time. Each of us were set up with our own rooms. While the boxes weren't completely unpacked, our bed were set up so we could sleep for school tomorrow. Yes, we were going straight to school after the move. Nobody wanted to, but mom insisted the more we missed the more we would be behind. She didn't want us taking classes all the way into the summer. I had just started middle school and it was difficult for me. I was small compared to all the middle schoolers and the joke of me being in the wrong school had gotten old. It was hard for people to believe I was a seventh grader. The one thing I had to look forward to was the fact my school would be a arts school. My mother put a huge emphasis on us doing things we liked and she thought that this school would help me more than the other one did. I wasn't stupid, I did fairly well in school. Subjects such as English and math I got off with B grades which weren't that bad. It was the fact I had more of an interest for dance than I did for school. I loved ballet the most, especially since I was on pointe earlier than most kids my age. My dance teacher was the one who mentioned the school to my mother. Because of her I was finally enrolled in a school that was a dream come true. With the dance room my mom promised, I wanted to practice in it tonight so I was ready for auditions tomorrow. I was nervous, but confident in making it. I didn't consider myself a terrible dancer since I was coordinated in my movement. And the dancing always felt like a small escape from the real world while I did it. \"Pizza's here!\" Carly yelled loudly, her voice held a small aggressive tone to it. As if she didn't want anyone to take more time to come downstairs. Carly was the oldest out of all of us and the only other girl in my the family. I guess most people would think we were close, but we just weren't. Carly had a personality distinctively different from mine. Unlike me, she was popular in school, she ran on the track team and had no problem with talking to people. Sometimes I found her voice to sound obnoxious, but even mentioning something like that to her would only bring her wrath upon me. In the recent year, she acted a lot different from her usual self, I guess more gloomily because of the hard turn all our lives had taken. Mom told me it was because she didn't want to move, but I knew it stemmed from something way before that. \"Brandy get down here now!\" Carly yelled as she increased the aggressiveness to her tone. Quickly I ran down the stairs, I was in no position to receive the rath of my sister. The pizza was ready and mom wouldn't let anyone eat until we were all seated. The smell of melted cheese entered my nose, causing my stomach to rumble in reply. I slipped into the metal fold up chair crossing my arms to fit in. Carly spoke to herself, \"Finally.\" It was as if she thought I couldn't hear her even though it was loud and clear to my ears. I slipped my fingers into the crust of the greasy slice as I took my first bite. We ate silently just as we had been doing for months. We didn't talk, but ate as a family like our mother wanted to. It was better this way since most of the time we tried to avoid each other all day. \"Are you guys excited for school tomorrow?\" Quickly that ice was broken by my mother who had clear intentions to change the quality of our family life. Nobody replied as we each quietly bit into our cheesy pizza, hoping it would be dropped. She glanced at us expectantly, which was a sign nobody would leave the table until she received a reply from all of us. I nodded, giving her a smile. I was excited and I knew the school was of high quality. \"I heard our school has a sick playground!\" Matthew exclaimed excitedly with hands thrown into the air. \"And, and I have recess at the same time as Riley so we can play together.\" \"Wow, but remember you guys still have to go to your classes, I don't need a call from the school saying one of you is missing from school.\" Mother explained carefully. Matthew and Riley were the youngest, for now until the baby was born and they had the most mischievous personalities out of all of us. They got in trouble so easily for small things, it was a good thing that they only did small things. \"What about you Carly? \"Mom asked my sister who was still busy into her pizza. Carly looked up, wide eyed as she was hoping Mother would ignore her even though it was never the case. Carly looked at all of us with eyes asking to change the subject before realizing she was trapped in this and had to give a reply. Her words were simply and rude. \"No.\" She didn't try to explained herself as she went directly back to her pizza. Mom bit her lip at my sister's words. She was trying to fix things and Carly had no intention to help her at all. I inhaled sharply as I recognized the expression on my mother's face, mixed with anger. A fight was about to go down and we had only been in the house for five hours. \"Why?\" My mother's voice was very authoritative. She was questioning my sister and she knew very clearly where these words would take her. Carly wasn't timid at all and she would take no time to argue against mom. Carly dropped the pizza on her plate, practically glowering at mom's fake worried expression. \"I think we al know why we really moved, you're just trying to avoid the memories we had at the other home, it hurts you doesn't it?\" She sneered angrily, directing her words to something hard in front of everyone. \"Carly, don't you dare say that. Drop this right now.\" My mother suddenly becoming very dark at my sister's words, Carly was intentionally trying to hurt her. \"It hurts you to know that he walked around that house with you, made so many fond memories.\" \"Stop it Carly! Your siblings don't need to hear this right now!\" Mother leaned across the table, warning my sister. With those words I felt myself snap, why were they trying to hide this from us when we knew everything? \"Shut up!\" I screamed, slamming my fist on the table. Everyone stared at me with shocked eyes, Carly included. \"I know dad's dead, we all do. There's no need to act like it never happened, how are we going to deal with our problems if we avoid this?\" I spoke very quickly, paying no attention to the harshness of my words. I breathed deeply for a few seconds as everyone sat in the silence. I stood up, making my intentions clear about today. \"I'm going to bed, goodnight.\" Normal POV Brandy shifted in her bed with an uncomfortable expression. After dinner something felt wrong. Her room felt wrong, before it was new and exciting, but now she could feel an unsettling feeling. Her eyes snapped open as she looked towards the source of her discomfort. A pale girl with wild curly hair, and a ruffled apron stood at the end of her bed. The girl who was younger than her seemed perplexed, yet pleasantly surprised. After a minute the girl finally spoke. \"What are you doing in my room?\"[Chapter 2] Carly's POV A small tap on my shoulder brought me to consciousness in an instant. I was a very light sleeper, even a whisper could wake me up. As my eyes lazily rolled to the side to look at the tapper, I was surprised to see Brandy's terrified little face. She came closer to me, begging for attention. \"I can't sleep, can I sleep in your bed?\" Despite how annoying she was to me, I couldn't say no. My mother didn't allow anyone to sleep with her after my dad died. She said it was better if she was alone. I opened up the covers as a gesture for her. She smiled very slightly, sliding into my side. For a second, I didn't know what to do, I was never a very touchy person. I could talk all the time, but the moment someone hugged me, things got awkward. She faced away from me towards the door as if she was watching something. \"Was it a bad dream?\" I asked carefully. Brandy wasn't one to share much. She liked to keep to herself and that's what made things frustrating for me. How was I supposed to know if something offended her. She said nothing if it did. Sometimes, I genuinely hated her for that. She could tell too, it was the reason she tried to avoid me sometimes. I couldn't help it, controlling emotions was impossible for me. She on the other hand could easily control her own and read how others felt. Brandy seemed to hesitate before shaking her head. \"I just felt scared.\" She replied softly. \"Why?\" I felt confused, normally she had a reason for things like this. She explained things when nobody else understood them. \"I don't know.\" Brandy whispered. I opened my mouth to ask more questions only to feel my tongue stutter as I didn't know what to say to her. She wasn't giving me a lot to go on. I didn't know why she was so scared right now. Nobody ever felt scared of nothing and she was making it clear she wasn't going to tell me what the thing was. I closed my eyes to get back to sleep. We both needed sleep since school was starting tomorrow. I shivered slightly as Brandy tugged on the blanket to cover her face. This house was pretty cold, hopefully we would get that repaired within the week. I began to drift off, exhaustion from the move filling my body. Despite that, I could feel Brandy shifting uncomfortably in the bed. My eyes opened as I was about to reprimand her for doing that. Suddenly, with no warning. She turned towards me, her eyes wider than ever. She wrapped her arms around me then burrowed her head into my chest. I looked towards the doorway seeing nothing. What was scaring her so badly? She shook nonstop, something was wrong and I couldn't figure it out. I hesitated, then gave her head a few strokes to calm her. She inhaled deeply, burrowing her head more. Slowly, I wrapped my arms around her to warm her up. At that motion, within seconds she began to relax. \"You're okay I promise, I won't let anything happen.\" I hear a relieved exhaled escape her mouth at my words. With that, I closed my eyes as darkness took over for both of us. Normal POV All the kids sat in the car. Matthew and Riley were bickering as they both tugged on their baseball bat. They were trying to decide who would be the first pitcher. Matthew finally yanked the bat to his side, swinging in excitement. Carly shot out her hand to stop the bat as it nearly rammed into the window. \"Jesus Christ guys, it's not like we're in a car right now.\" Carly commented with rolled eyes. \"Do that again and you boys won't be playing baseball during recess.\" Their mom added. \"I don't need to be paying for more things other than the house and school.\" Brandy sat in the back with her elbow balanced against the cup holders to observe the scenery going past outside. She liked to watch things move past them as if the trees were the ones moving and not the car. She could pick out branches rustling as the car's speed made a breeze. They seemed to wave at her, welcoming her on the way to school. Carly looked at her phone, smiling as a message appeared. Brandy peeked over to see who it was. \"Andy, who's Andy?\" She said curiously, \"why does he want to see you right now?\" All her words were innocent. She had no intention to cause any trouble. Riley snorted. \"You mean the Andy she made out with the week before we left?\" Matthew laughed along at his brother's words. \"Yeah, I believe she called him a hottie.\" \"I don't like Andy! He's a friend.\" Carly spat out quickly. A flush of red appear on her cheeks as she spoke. Carly remember that event and she considered it a mistake since her and Andy were friends all the way from middle school. \"He just wants to visit us next weekend since his school has a break that week.\" She stumbled on her words, becoming more embarrassed by the second. \"That sounds great, but we'll discuss it later today.\" Their mother said as she glanced back quickly to make sure all the kids were okay. Carly glared at her words, she knew exactly what they meant. \"Mom, when you say we'll discuss it you mean that it's a no.\" She began to leak anger as she spoke. \"I need to see Andy, he's my best friend!\" \"Carly, we'll discuss it at home.\" Donna said firmly. She was still tired from the move and didn't want to argue with Carly again like last night. She felt that a visitor wasn't good at that time, especially since they still wouldn't be settled in by that time, it would take longer. The car rolled into the parking lot, coming to a slow stop. Donna pushed the button to slide open the door. She turned to smile at her boys. \"Have a good day at school and remember, don't break anything.\" Matthew's POV \"This is gonna be a fast one!\" Riley yelled as he got into position to throw the ball. I held the bat, posed for the ball to come my way. He smoothly moved the ball forward, releasing it. I swung the bat quickly, feeling it come into contact with the ball as it let out a loud clapping sound. Within seconds the ball flew into the air, flying far past Riley. \"Nice! You got an inch farther than last time.\" Riley said mockingly. \"Farther than you could ever get.\" I retorted back. Compared to me, he still had a lot of work to do. I rested the bat against my shoulder, walking up to him confidently. \"Besides, I'm older so I'm better.\" Riley mocked my words with folded arms. \"I doubt it, besides I'll be the best baseball player in the world when I grow up!\" Even though he was only a year younger than me his words seemed childish to my ear. I snorted in reply as he seemed confident about it. \"Right and I'll be even better than you still.\" I said to tease him. \"Nuuh, I said I'm going to be the best.\"Riley argued. I laughed lightly then tackled him to the ground, ruffling his dirty blonde hair as he struggled. \"Come on looser, just admit it. I'm the best.\" He tried to kick out his legs, flailing as I pinned him down. I pushed his chest down so he was pinned with no escape. \"Say mercy and I'll let go.\"I tightened my grip ever so slowly that he wouldn't notice it. Shaking his head, he tried to push against me again. Compared to me, he had no upper body strength, it was like a bug fighting an elephant. He stood no chance. But, he was very stubborn and persistent. He would fight until he couldn't stand it. Finally, after what seemed like forever he yelled. \"Mercy! Mercy!\" He rolled away as I released his body. Stretching out his arms that were previously bent at awkward angles. Her glared with his words. \"I'm not weak at all, I'm stronger than Brandy.\" \"Brandy is a girl, there's a big difference.\" I said as he brushed the dust off his body. \"She has a different body and everything.\" \"Is that why she acts weird all the time?\" Riley said curiously, he gave a small tilt with his head to add to the question. I chuckled, Riley always seemed to ask the best questions. \"No, she's just acting the way Brandy acts. If you think about it, it's probably not weird to her.\" Riley thought about my words as he made clicking sounds with his tongue. \"So she's just being normal the way she knows how to be normal?\" \"Exactly.\" Normal POV Brandy sat up in her bed as the clock turned to 12, looking at the end of her bed expectantly. She was waiting for the thing that scared her last night. After thinking about it the whole day, her fear was less than it was before, more than anything she was curious to find out what exactly it was. \"Come on I know you're here.\" She called out to the blank spot. \"You said you would come back tomorrow.\" At that moment, the wild haired girl appeared, giggling as some moonlight illuminated her. Being able to see more clearly, Brandy considered the skin to be more of an ashy color. \"Hi Gloria, I was thinking about you all day.\" Brandy spoke with excitement, for once she had a secret and nobody else knew about it. She felt herself bounce in the bed, making a small creak as her body motion triggered the rusty springs. Gloria put a finger to her lips in a shushing motion before whispering more quietly than Brandy did. \"As have I, I love making new friends all the time.\" Brandy smiled as she nodded rapidly. She wanted to play all night with Gloria, the other girl was very energetic and seemed to want to be her friend. \"I made something for you and I want you to see it.\" Gloria said earnestly, \"but it's up in the attic and it's too heavy for me to bring down.\" Brandy looked up at the ceiling with a wondrous expression. \"We have an attic?\" She whispered. \"Mom's just been putting things in the basement.\" \"Yes there's an attic, but it's hidden and you can't tell anyone about it.\" Gloria replied with a sly grin. \"It's my favorite place to be in this house.\" Brandy frowned. \"Wait, how do know about the attic?\" She was confused as she had just met this girl, yet she was so knowledgeable about things in the house. \"Because, I used to live here silly.\" Gloria used her cold hand to pat Brandy's back. \"I know every hiding spot in this house.\" \"Now come on, we have to be quick before your mom comes home, she's working the night shift right?\" Gloria said as she held her hand out to the other girl. Brandy nodded as she stood up to follow. It was only her mother's first day of work at the hospital, yet the bosses scheduled her to be there for the night shift. She promised to get them off so she could spend time with the children, but they all knew that was never happening. Gloria lead her through the hallway to a vent. Quickly she pulled off the cover coming to her knees to crawl. \"The entrance is this way, stay with me because it's dark.\" Brandy kneeled down as she came into the crawl space with Gloria, within seconds, Gloria tapped her foot back. \"Okay, the ladder is right in front of us. Just keep following me and you won't get lost.\" \"Okay.\" Brandy whispered back. She reached forward, grabbing step by step as she went higher and higher until she came to a leveled floor in front of her. Perched on a stack of books seemed to be a old camera, ready to play as there was a white sheet pinned up on the back wall. \"Come on.\" Gloria ushered her forward. \"I made a movie for you to watch, I think you'll like it.\" \"But my mom.\" Brandy spoke cautiously as she didn't want to get in trouble for being out of bed. \"Don't worry, it's a very short movie, you'll be back in bed before anyone notices.\" Gloria reassured her, she seemed eager for Brandy to watch the film. Brandy twisted her lips then nodded as she sat down by the side of the book pile. \"Okay, play it.\" Gloria grinned as she pressed the switch and the film began to spin. Clicking sounds came out as an image projected out onto the white sheet. Brandy watched with confusion as it was a family cooking dinner. They prepared side by side, making things to perfection. An burly man laughed as he pulled a nicely roasted turkey from the oven, holding it in front of all the others to smell with delight. \"Is this a Thanksgiving dinner?\" Brandy asked curiously. She recognized some foods that were being placed on the dinning table. \"Yes, and we aren't even to the best part yet.\" Gloria smiled kind of snidely, something Brandy didn't understand as there was no importance to this dinner for her. The camera seemed to turn towards Gloria in the film, she held a wooden spoon firmly as an older woman behind her helped her mix some punch. She seemed to have a careful expression on her face despite the assistance she was receiving from the person who was probably her mother. Suddenly it cut to another scene, the family was at the dinner table with Gloria out of view. They all held up glasses of punch, cheering as they reached forward to clink them together. The burly man held up his fingers, counting from one to three, at three every single person pulled the glass to their lips. Some people completely gulped down the punch while other took a few sips. They smiled at each other as they moved to their food. Gloria's mother began to cough as her eyes looked towards the camera screen. Suddenly a nasty cough escaped her mouth, splattering blood into her mashed potatoes. Her eyes rolled back as her body began to shake out of her control. Her head then dropped into her own shoulder as she went limp. The other family member stared in shock, then a chorus of coughs began to escape from their mouths. Within seconds almost everyone dropped down just like Gloria's mother had while only one managed to stand. A teenage boy stumbled as he moved to the phone to call for help. He got five steps before collapsing. The camera came closer to his face as the expression in his eyes became glassy. Then it was over. As the film cut off, it was clear Brandy was shaking violently with fear. The film had taken a twist she didn't expect.[Chapter 3] Brandy's POV I sat down with the scene from yesterday playing over and over again in my head. Right now I was still trying to make sense of it and the logic I was coming up with didn't help. Last night I was up till 3 AM, trying to decide if it was better to fake sick so I could recuperate. But quickly I knew Mom wouldn't buy it, we had just moved and being sick could mean I didn't want to go to school. To be honest I loved the school already, the teachers were attentive and the students were kind to me. I really appreciated the warm welcome and now there were already more pressing matters than school. Mindlessly, I dug my fingers into the piece of toast on my plate. It made crunching sounds as my fingers entered, scattering crumbs all over the table. I couldn't believe that video, why would Gloria film the death of her family? They didn't seem like that bad of people from the video, if fact they seemed to be very happy. Something that was rare in this time and age since families seemed to fall with people giving in to their dark desires. I didn't understand it? Maybe she did it because somebody forced her to do it? It seemed like the most solid answer because nobody in their right mind would film their family dying. If anything, a film like that would create nightmares. Especially for a kid like Gloria considering she was only 9. Gloria didn't act like she was 9 sometimes, there were times were she talked in a more mature way. I actually admired it sometimes because she seemed so calm in certain situations where as I couldn't hide my horror at things. I wasn't paying attention to the toast becoming a mess on my plate. I wasn't hungry anyway so it didn't seem important to me. \"Brandy?\" My mom said. In my head it was muffled, I didn't hear it as figuring out the video was very important to me. I wanted to know why Gloria did it. I wanted to know if she felt guilty about it or if she truly thought the video was something good because she seemed to present it to me that way. If that was the case, I had stumbled on something truly terrifying. If I could I would back out it. Hopefully Gloria would leave me alone if I decided that. \"Brandy honey.\" I shot up as my mom placed a gentle hand on my shoulder. My gasp was a small shudder, barely noticeable. She placed her other hand on my toast wrecking one, pulling it back gently. \"Honey how are you going to eat your toast now? Look at it.\" She pointed out the pile of crumbs on my plate, not resembling the square shape it once was. I shrugged, I didn't want the toast and I had no intention to eat it at all. She frowned at my blank expression, I was trying to figure out what to think right now. I didn't know how to handle things right now. Softly, she brushed the crumbs off my hands with a napkin. \"Are you okay? You seem distant.\" She commented. Silently, Carly, Matthew, and Riley kept their heads down. They wanted no part of this conversation. Once again I shrugged because I didn't know how else to reply. Telling my mom about the video would make her think I was crazy or over imaginative and I didn't need that right now. I needed to be taken seriously. \"Is it something that happened at school yesterday?\" She asked me in her careful voice. At that moment, I kept my eyes from rolling. She thought she was treading on risky waters when it really wasn't that complicated. The school wasn't the problem and I couldn't believe she would assume something like that. \"No, school was great.\" I turned to her, giving a genuine smile. That would comfort her, especially considering how dazed I appeared a few minutes ago. She smiled back at me, happy to receive a response in actual words. I usually used actions to reply because they were easier to do. Finding the right words were complicated. \"Did anything good happen?\" I nodded, thinking about the school day instead of the video. \"For half of the day I danced then the other half I did school stuff.\" I swallowed as the tone in my voice turned to excitement. \"We have a recital in a month and the teacher said I could be in it as long as I keep my hard work up. She told me I'm a hard worker.\" I could feel a grin slide over my teeth, it was easy for me to be joyful about this. \"Really?\" My mom appear surprised. \"In excited to see you perform honey, I'm sure it will be amazing.\" Normal POV \"Bye Jessica thanks for the ride!\" Carly called out at the open window of her new friend's car. Jessica and her started talking today and Jessica kindly offered to take her home. All the juniors at school were let out early after taking the ACT, a hard test that decided what colleges would accept them, so basically their entire future. Personally, Carly had already given up on getting a good score. It was always her dad who helped her with homework and now that he was gone. There was nobody to make sure she got good grades. Her mother was too busy with other things to help so Carly decided to not study at all. She thought she was screwed and almost all the questions on that test were confusing. While she wanted to have a good future she knew that was not possible for awhile especially with the family life she had. At times, she felt hopeless. She entered through the garage, casually punching in the code. The door opened very slowly, taking its time. Carly waited impatiently with her right foot tapping the ground at a quick beat until the garage door was completely up. As soon as she reached the smaller door and opened it she threw her backpack onto the nearby couch. \"All by myself, I got the house all to myself.\" At this time she could do anything, she could throw a house party if she wanted. Especially considering her mother wouldn't be home till 2 in the morning. Really though, she wouldn't do that because parties before the nighttime were pretty lame. Who wants to come to a day party when all the fun happens at night? At least, that was her reasoning. She didn't know what the other students thought about parties. She slipped her laptop from the desk top then settled in comfortably by her backpack on the couch. Curling her legs to her left side, she relaxed against the armrest as she started to pull herself into the mindless internet. It was really parts of the internet that would make her laugh, but also parts she didn't have to think about, they were just there for amusement. As she scrolled through the pages she lost track of time. Simply going through things because it felt good. A loud thump echoed from down the hallway, startling her into the real world. Curiously, she looked down to see what it was. Were there already rats in the house? More quietly, the same thump sounded. She came to her feet to investigate what it was. As she came closer down the hallway, the sound seemed to get faster and quieter, coming to its fastest beat as she stood in front of a vent. She kneeled down, peeking into the vent to see what creature was trapped, but was met with pitch black. It appeared almost impossible for anything to be there as the black looked like a wall. She wiggled the vent cover, feeling it come loose in her hands so she could pull it off. Quickly, shivers ran down her back. What if somebody was hiding in here? While that was unlikely since their house was locked the idea still gave her the creeps. An unknown person in their house was horrifying. Quietly in the hallway, a tall dark figure watched her go in. Yes, she would discover something hiding in there, but things were already too late because everything was in motion. The the dark figure reached towards her then disappeared. She shook off the idea then reached into the vent, finding it went farther out. Considering how big the vent was she could probably fit, it was perfectly safe. Carly crawled in using her hands as her guide by patting forward to feel what was on the vent walls. It felt bare for the most part with a lot of dust all over. She began coughing as she reached forward to touch a box object. She patted it more roughly a few times, feeling perplexed about why it was there? Did the previous owners leave it? Or was it there since the house was built? Either way, there was no info about the previous owners. The only thing the retailer told them was that the owners died in the house. There was no info for how it happened or why, but Carly assumed it was probably an accident. It wasn't like any big murder plot or otherwise the house wouldn't sell. She dragged it out into the hallway, quick to open the box and see what she would find. In the box sat a camera, a very old one. As far as she recalled from her film class last year it was an 8mm camera which was strange. The house wasn't that old to have this in here. Next to the camera sat some cases of film. Each nearly identical to each other except for the names. She pulled the first one out, reading the title out loud to herself. \"Rooftop Garden '97?\" She frowned, all the titles appeared to be some sort of family video thing. She was curious to see what was on them as it probably showed the previous owners doing everyday things. She wanted to see it and there was really only one way to do that. Carly began to set up using the information she learned from her film class. She pulled a sheet off her bed, hanging it with some thumb tacks from her school supplies. She moved a coffee table to a spot near the center of the room to project a somewhat clear image from the camera. Then she placed the camera down, getting it into a good position. Carefully, she pulled the film from its case. Getting it set up so she could watch the entire video. When that was all done, she pulled the blinds closed so it was dimmer then pushed the switch to start the film. As the image popped up. The camera seemed to be catching some scenery that was pretty recognizable. It passed by the Statue of Liberty hinting to her this was from New York City. It moved across the horizon, passing the sun and many skyscrapers before pausing to focus on the rooftop. There was a whole garden set up with healthy brown dirt. A mother and her two little girls were tending to a cluster of already grown tomatoes. They dropped the ripe ones into a metal bowl. One of the girls giggled as she stuffed a mini red tomato into her little mouth. Bliss filled her expression as the taste filled her mouth. Her mother tickled her side then moved back to the tomatoes. An older man walked down the dirt digging small holes as his son followed behind him placing seeds in the empty spots then filling the holes back up. The man pushed some sweat off his grey brow then took a sip of water from the bottle he was carrying. One of the little girls hopped up, running towards him. Like that, within a snap the scene changed. It was very dark, still the roof top, but now it was nighttime. The camera was focused on the ground, it came up slowly to the edge of the roof where there were four people. Both of the little girls and the parents laying on their sides, dangerously close to the edge. Carly's eyes widened as she straightened up. Each family member had their ankles tied together and their wrists bound behind their back. There was a strip of fabric blinding their eyes and another piece gagging their mouth so they would stay silent. \"No.\" Carly whispered in horror. The camera came close to each person as they were pushed off the edge, falling to their deaths. Carly covered her mouth as the camera peered over the edge at the bodies lying broken on the ground. As a group of people began to gather the film ended. Carly flinched as the door swung open and Brandy jumped onto her lap. The little girl smiled, it was obvious she had a good day at school especially since those days were rare. Brandy glanced at the camera then hugged Carly. She became stiff as she looked at the doorway to see Gloria standing there. Just as she was about to ask Carly where she found the horrible camera. Gloria held up one finger to her lips to let Brandy know what happened was supposed to be a secret. She stayed silent, deciding to be in the moment of a great hug. Donna's POV I shuffled through my card deck, today I didn't have the night shift, but with the stress of the move I thought I deserved some fun that didn't happen often. So I told the kids I was working late. The game I was playing was getting difficult, I was so close to winning, yet nobody really knew what the outcome would be. You had to be smart for things like this or you would loose all your money in one stupid round. I sighed as I began to gather my courage, I was going to do this and destroy these people. Quickly I pulled the shot glass to my lips, gulping down the strong whiskey. I winced then pushed all my poker chips forward, it was time. I was going to beat them all \"Alright, I'm all in.\" Hi guys! This is Taliyatwo I just thought I would take some time to leave a note. Thank you for reading my story I really appreciate it and thank you to those few reviewers. Anymore reviews are welcome. I came up with this idea after watching Sinister 2 and I thought it would be a great story. Tell me what you think about this chapter and thanks for reading, see you the next chapter![Chapter 4] Normal POV Carly woke up at the sound of a swinging door. The person who did it seemed to have no purpose, it was a careless action. Slowly glancing at her clock, she groaned it was only 5:30 AM which meant they had another hour to sleep. Yet, she was curious to see why her mother was home this late. Very carefully, as not to disturb the position of the covers on her little sister. She slipped out of the bed onto the cooling wood, smoothly, her arms stretched out to the sides as a yawn sounded to signal her exhaustion. Swiftly her legs moved down the hallway until she came to her mother's room to see her completely collapsed on the top of the bed. Her mouth hung open with small snores traveling out into the open space of the room. Carly sighed at her mother's clothing from yesterday, the back had an unidentifiable stain. The smell of cigarettes was overwhelming as she neared her. Donna shifted her position, moaning. \"Mom?\" Carly asked as quietly as possible. \"Mom, are you okay?\" She looked towards her mother's night stand, keys messily thrown on, her pills scattered by clumsy movement, and a large stack of cash. Carly paused her eyes on the cash as she realized the significance of them and what it meant. From the smell, her mother had probably come home from a bar which meant the stack was her winnings from gambling. This wasn't good at all, especially since gambling was an addiction her mother hadn't touched for roughly 20 years. And now it seemed the women was already spiraling down quickly. For christ's sake, the woman was pregnant. It was strange to think she wasn't worried about the baby at all in this event. Then again, maybe she forgot that the baby was there. She tended to do that a lot lately. \"Mom, we've got school in a few hours. Who's going to take us?\" Her mother opened her mouth with a strong alcohol smell wafering out into Carly's nose causing her to wrinkle it in disgust. \"No.\" Donna replied as she turned away from her daughter, leaving the girl very confused. Carly angrily folded her arms, giving a very sour expression to her mother. \"Damn it mom! Who's going to take us to school?\" At that point she didn't care if the kids heard her. Her mother was being ridiculous and this was not responsible behavior. It was frustrating just to be in the same room. Quickly, Carly saw she was not going to get a reply. She left the room, taking all her self control to not stomp down the hallway as she entered her own room to wake her sister. The only other person who could drive in the house was herself and while she wasn't the best driver, it was the only option they had. Missing school already would set a reputation she didn't need. They all needed to make friends at school and if people expected one thing of them it could all turn to something worse. \"Brandy, Brandy. It's time to get up.\" She shook her sister's unconscious body, receiving a little frown from the girl's face. Brandy slowly opened her eyes, drowsily staring at her sister. \"Already? It's only...\" Her eyes wandered to the clock. \"It's only 5:42.\" She let out a shaky groan, rolling her body into a sitting position. \"Mom says we can sleep until 6:30.\" Brandy smacked her lips together as she laid down again. \"Mom's not feeling well so I'm taking us to school. I want to leave early just in case.\" Carly spoke quickly, hoping to not startle her sister. Brandy opened one eye lifting an eyebrow. Her chest rose softly in response. \"Is it because she worked late last night?\" Carly twisted her lips, she didn't want to tell Brandy their mother was doing other things that night. It would only make the girl more concerned for her mother than she needed to be. \"Can I see her?\" Within an instant, Carly shook her head almost violently. Brandy didn't need to see their mother like that. \"I think it's best we don't disturb her so she can rest.\" Brandy assessed her words, trying to decide how worthy they were. She was eager to see her mother, especially after not seeing her after school. She liked the time they spent together and now that they moved, it wasn't often because their mom was always busy. \"Fine.\" Brandy shrugged at her words. \"Will you tell her I hope she feels better?\" Carly let out a half sigh with her head moving up and down. She suddenly changed tones as a tactic to get her sister's mind off the subject. Quickly she scooped the girl off the bed receiving small giggles. Within seconds the expression on her face went blank as it reminded her of the little girl laughing in the video. There was a noticeable shake in her hands as she felt terror from it. \"Are you okay?\" Brandy asked softly, she wrapped her arms around her sister's shoulders. Carly blinked quickly to shake it off, giving her sister a sly smile. \"Of course, let's go wake up Matthew and Riley.\" She then dashed out of the room with Brandy laughing joyfully. Brandy's POV I moved my body very precisely, making sure to keep in sinc with all the other dancers. We all rose to our toes crossed in releve, taking very tiny steps to the right. I held my arms in a L position with the back row, making a very subtle flutter motion with the horizontal arm. It took all my focus to keep my body's relaxed appearance despite the fact my inner muscles were tensed. There was little pains shooting up my toes as we had to stay up on pointe. I wished for a break, but our teacher was precise. Everything had to be up to her vision and she only gave three chances. Once you exceeded that she threatened taking you out of the dance all together. She wasn't a cruel person, she was just passionate about what she was doing. I understood that because I loved dance too. It was what I wanted to do with my life when I was older. Even if it was only a job for younger people, I could teach when I retired because dance was an art for escape and I knew a lot of kids needed that in this cruel world. I took in a deep breath, feeling perspiration drip down my cheek. I prepped myself taking another deep breath then pulled into a double turn on one leg. Quietly, I landed with grace as everybody slid down to their knees. We all made a wave motion with our arms than slid to the floor, the music lingered for a few seconds, then ended. Miss Jennifer clapped enthusiastically, jumping up and down. \"That was it! That was it! We're one step closer to being prepared for our recital.\" Her words were cut off as the bell rang, signaling the end of school. She looked at watch clicking her tongue. \"Alright alright, time to go. Remember all we rehearsed, you'll need it for Monday. We'll go over things once than move on. Now go home! Have a good day.\" Like popcorn, kids came to their feet. Some running and other taking their time. I was one taking my time as I looked over at my friend Katie with a grin. \"This is great, I bet it looks really good.\" \"Of course it does.\" Katie replied in her high pitch voice. \"We've been working on it for weeks, I just can't believe you learned all of it that fast!\" I nodded with a small laugh. \"I've just always been able to learn dance moves quickly. I don't think I would consider that a talent.\" Katie hopped to her feet, running the small distance over to me. \"It should be because that was so hard for me.\" I shook my head in reply as Katie teasing stuck her tongue out. \"Brandy come over here.\" Miss Jennifer spoke over our voices with her hand ushering me quickly. Katie gave me a look as I hurried over. Miss Jennifer smiled as she slid a hand over my shoulders. \"I just wanted to say you did a really good job today. I understand it must be stressful learning all of this in a few day. I wanted to be sure, is everything alright at home?\" She looked at me with interest, she was someone who cared about the wellbeing of her dancers. I hesitated, while it wasn't perfect I thought we were surviving. \"Yeah, it's fine.\" I replied quietly. \"Good, then I want you to keep practicing at home like you've been doing. It looks like it's really coming along.\" She told me eagerly. \"I will.\" She slightly pushed me towards the door, waving as I walked away. Normal POV A loud yell sounded from Donna's closed door alerting the three younger ones who were working on homework at dining table. Curiously, all three looked at each other, wondering what it was about. Riley pointed to the door, mouthing words as he and the other two got up to check out the situation. They each placed one ear on the door. \"God Damn it Mom! I don't think you get it, do you!?\" Carly yelled angrily, she was still upset about what happened this morning. She held her hands up to shoulder level as she glared at her mother, trying to prove a point. For a second, Donna held her mouth open, shocked at the tone her daughter was speaking to her in. \"It's none of your business Carly, all it was was a little fun time for me. Nothing else! Besides its not like I do this all the time.\" She was practically seething, digging her fingers into the mattress. \"No, no you don't. You didn't do it when I was little, but you know what Dad told me? He said you used to be addicted to this thing and that it was hard to get you to stop once you started. He had to get you intervention!\"Carly retorted quickly. \"I can stop, I know I can stop.\" Donna replied with fake calmness. Truly, after getting a taste of gambling last night that was all she wanted to do. She craved it, but would never admit it was a problem. This time she didn't have her husband to save her. Carly snorted at her words. \"And?\" She asked sarcastically. \"What if you can't stop? You're supposed to be our mother, our caretaker. What's gonna happen to us when this consumes you?\" Donna placed a hand firmly on her hip. \"I told you, I can stop its not that hard.\" \"Yes it is, what's gonna happen when you lose it, what's gonna happen when suddenly you have a debt you can't pay off? Are you gonna take the boys out of baseball? Because you know how disappointed they'll be.\" Carly was more aggressive in her tactics, she was trying to convince her mom of how big this really was. She learned about addiction in school, it was something taught big every year and she was very knowledgable about the issue. \"Are you going to make Brandy quit dance, take away one of the only things she loves because you won't be able to afford it if things go wrong.\" At her words, Brandy who was already in tears covering her mouth as a loud sob echoed out. Donna looked at Carly in silence as she opened the door. Matthew and Riley stood with shocked expressions. Brandy had tears running down her face. Her lip trembled with her sensitive expression as she dashed away to her own room, slamming it shut. Quickly she locked the door than sat on her bed to cover her face as she continued to cry, she didn't understand why Mom was in that much trouble. It didn't make any sense. Carly and Donna knocked on the door. \"Please let me talk to you honey, let me explain.\" Donna pleaded on the other side. \"I promise it's not what you think it is.\" Brandy shook her head even though she knew neither of them could see that. She didn't want to talk because it would only make things worse. All she wanted was to go back to things being in the shadows and not having to know things like this were happening. Her shuddering breath came to a stillness as a familiar cold hand touched her shoulder. She looked up to see Gloria, frowning at her expression. \"Are you okay? You look down.\" The other girl commented with confusion as if she didn't understand the pain. Brandy let out a sigh. \"No, I'm not.\" \"Having a bad time?\" Gloria asked. Brandy looked to the door as footsteps echoed away, her mother and Carly had given up. Brandy nodded sadly. \"I have something to cheer you up then, another friend.\" Gloria said excitedly. \"I promise you'll like him he's really funny.\" She looked towards a dark shadow, making an ushering motion with her hand. \"Come on out Conner.\" With that, a boy moved out into her vision. He gave her a smile as she assessed him. His shirt, with a picture of a pirate was wrinkled and covered in dirt. Along with a huge hole on the knee of his jeans. Brandy moved her eyes towards his head, noting the spiked blonde hair and his pale skin. \"Hey, what's up? Gloria told me a lot about you.\" Conner finally spoke. His voice was at a slightly lower pitch. \"H-hi.\" Brandy stuttered. In the shadows, another figure stood that Brandy didn't notice. In such a short time, Bughuul was already pleased. Things were going well with his plans and each day, this girl became more perfect for the job he would need her to do. Hi! This is Taliyatwo again and I wanted to thank the reviewers once again. I really appreciate the support you guys give me. Sorry for not writing for a bit, I got busy with homework and had to focus on that. But, I'll try to keep up with this as much as I can. Any more reviews would be appreciated. I am open to any ideas for what the title of my story should be. The one I have is more temporary so tell me your ideas![Chapter 5] Normal POV It had been two weeks since moving and the kids were finally settled in. The house was set up and completely ready for use with all moving boxes completely emptied. After the fight that night, Brandy had become slightly more withdrawn than usually. She was trying to make an effort to talk, but felt uncomfortable. Especially since she had never heard her mother and Carly so angry like that. She wanted to help, but had no clue how to do that. While she knew what the issue was, Carly said it would take a lot of help to get their mother to stop the bad habit. And as Carly predicted, their mother was still gambling. She didn't do it everyday, but it seemed to control her mood when she did. The thrill of winning money made her vicious for more which wasn't the best thing to see. Yet, with her work schedule and gambling at night it was easy to see she was becoming exhausted from keeping up with it all. Her body was loosing sleep it needed at the right time and it wasn't happy about it. As she came home, dark bags were discernible under her eyes along with a dead look in them. It was sad to watch and all the kids felt helpless. Brandy stood in the bathroom, scrubbing her teeth at a consistent pace. She counted in her head for each section, determined for them to get a good clean. Carly stood close to the mirror, using one hand to hold open her right eye as the other placed a contact on the pupil. Quickly, she blinked it in, grunting uncomfortably as it didn't set in place for a few seconds. To fix it, she used two fingers to pat it in, sighing as it finally placed on her eye. Brandy spit out the toothpaste into the sink, glancing at a labeled pill container Carly had lying near her stuff. She took a swig of water, swishing it around a few times in her mouth with perfect concentration in that moment. As she released the water to the same place she had the toothpaste, she pointed at the container. \"What's that?\" \"Uh.\" Carly looked over as she was pushing in the other contact. \"Uh, those are my happy pills.\" Brandy lifted an eyebrow. \"What do you mean? Would they make me happy?\" \"No, you shouldn't be taking them. They're prescribed for me.\" Carly replied as she finished the contact. Brandy seemed perplexed at it as she hadn't seen them before. Carly noticed it too as she began to explain. \"It's like this, your happy levels are like this all the time.\" She held her hand at an even level making a horizontal line. \"And mine is like this, sometimes it drops.\" With her other hand she started going straight than made it drop to a lower level. \"The medicine makes it so mine stay as even as possible.\" \"They make you happy then?\" Brandy questioned. Carly didn't seem happy to her all the time, yet she did better than she had in the previous year. She was different and the different helped her to have more control and be motivated. Carly nodded as she patted Brandy's head. It was with that motion that Brandy finally understood what was a complex situation. \"Why are you putting in your contacts? Aren't you going to bed?\" Brandy asked as a follow up, it was almost like she was investigating her sister even though she didn't mean it that way. \"Nope, I've got a study group so I'm gonna be back later tonight.\" Carly answered as she tried to fix her hair. Brandy pouted at her words. \"Who's going to be there if I get scared at night?\" She really didn't get scared anymore, she just thought the notion was comforting to her sister. \"Hey,\" Carly placed one hand on each of Brandy's cheeks. \"I think that you won't be scared tonight, you're a tough girl and you can be brave. Right?\" She looked directly at Carly with a smile. \"I guess.\" The was almost a disappointment to her words. \"Good night. Sleep well when you get back.\" Leaning close she hugged her sister than moved towards her bedroom. She wondered what would happen tonight. After watching Connor's video of his family being pushed off a building she was trying hard to understand how Connor was able to do it. His mother and father were both taller than he could imagine being. Than again, he couldn't grow anymore. He was dead, at least that was what he told her. She should have been scared of him and Gloria, but they seemed too friendly to want to cause her harm. They wanted to show her that too, that was why they considered the videos harmless. Brandy flinched as she closed the door and heard Gloria's voice. \"Is it time today?\" The girl's voice was filled with curiosity. \"Are we going to watch more today?\" Flipping around, Brandy frowned at her. Watching the videos was pretty hard and with the situation in the house she didn't feel up to it. The only reason she watched the second one was because she was upset. It helped her to think about something else rather than her mother's loud, angry voice. \"Awww, come on. It's been a long time and the other kids worked on them really hard. Just for you.\" Gloria appeared insistent. She was serious about what this was and seemed almost in a hurry for Brandy to watch them. Brandy was unsure about it, morally she felt like it was wrong. Watching something like that and saying nothing to others seemed like hiding a problem and hiding a problem this big would cause it to bubble up until it exploded, destroying anything near it. \"Please?\" Gloria pleaded with a tone making Brandy feel guilty. She bit her lip, trying to decide if this was all really worth it. Besides, the videos weren't even that long and she could still get sleep despite spending the time to watch them. \"I guess, just a little bit though.\" Brandy was softer this time, adjusting her mood for what was next. Brandy's POV As I finished climbing the ladder I noticed everything was already set up. The screen, the camera they knew I would decide to watch it. I was nervous for this. Those videos were creepy and unsettling. I would never get them out of my heads and the other kids knew it too. Sometimes I suspected manipulation even though they told me they wanted to help and make me happy. I could already see Connor seated along with two kids I hadn't seen before. The girl had her red hair pulled into a tight ponytail on her head. It flipped upwards as she looked at me slyly. The other kid had a long sleeve shirt with stripes, his short faux hawk was a sharp contrast to it, almost surprising with his small appearance. Sometimes parents did that with their children because it was unique. I walked up slowly, awkwardly as I sat next to the new ones. It was strange that they all showed up at random times. Really, it didn't make much sense to me, but I knew they each made a video I would have to watch. It was enough to watch just one video, I didn't know if I could handle more. Gloria plopped down next to me casually, beaming harder than I thought she could. \"Cinthia will go first.\" She claimed with a gesture towards the girl. At that, the other girl moved to the camera. Starting to set up a reel that was in her hands. She whistled an unfamiliar tune until it was ready, showing uneven teeth, Cinthia pointed towards the screen as the image appeared. There were multiple maple trees, each appeared strong and healthy to the eye. A few people were carving out holes at the bases of the trees. As the camera focused on an older woman it was easy to see the hole she made was deep. She then pulled out an object that looked kind of like the end of a faucet, placing one end in the hole. \"What, what is that?\" I asked, my voice trailing off as thick, golden liquid dripped out of the faucet object into a clear pitcher the women held up. \"It a spile. My parents owned a maple syrup company, it wasn't big, but we made enough.\" Cinthia replied with her eyes glued to the screen. She pulled off her black hat, holding it in both hands. The camera moved to a teen boy tackling another girl his age. They looked to be close to each other. As the camera moved back to the older woman, Cinthia skipped into the screen with her father in tow. She blew a big pink bubble out of her mouth, looking curiously as the syrup starting to fill up nearly to the top. She removed the gum from her mouth, using her hand that was previously holding her father's to dip a finger into the syrup. She placed that finger in her mouth making an mmmm face as the taste completely filled her tongue. There was a snap as the image changed, each family member was tied upside down with their head pulled back to expose their neck. As the camera panned to each member it was easy to see each shaking, they were terrified because they could tell what was coming. A hand held up a cloth, wiping off the teenage girl's neck even though it probably wasn't needed. Then it brought up a marker, putting a dot on the most vulnerable area. After the hand was quick to pull out a spile and hammer, hitting the hammer onto the spile to embed it tightly into the neck. Then the maple syrup pitcher was held under the spile as red slowly began to drip out into it. The body changed from the shaking to a rapid twitch until the teen stopped moving as the rest of her blood emptied out into the pitcher. The camera moved along, filming each person as the process was done on them. I tried to cover my eyes at it, peeking a few times to see if it was over. Despite the disgust I felt there was also this curiosity there I couldn't deny. Finally, it clicked off giving me relief as I stopped the motions, how I felt was almost unsettling. I looked nervously at Gloria as she ushered the other boy to go. \"I... I think I'm done for now.\" I said shakily, trying to pushed myself up. Gloria gripped my hand quickly. \"Please? Andy worked hard on this. We all did.\" Too scared to say no, I settled myself back down as Andy started to place his film into the same area Cinthia had. As his film turned on, I quickly noticed a board game on the image. New and unopened, quickly the family began to tear it open. They placed all the trash in one pile, ready to already start playing. It zoomed in on a fire flickering in the fireplace. Keeping everyone warm as they all wore blankets over their shoulders. The camera settled into place as Andy walked onto the screen. He grinned at his family, holding up a pair of shiny dice. His mother and father cheered while his little sister reached for the dice. He left the screen again as the camera moved. Each member began to pick out a piece for them to use. As the scene changed, there was only a dim lamp to light up everything, the fire was barely out with two trails of smoke coming from it. It slowly came to the family members, each duck-tapped to a chair. All of them appear very groggy, as if they had woken up. The camera came close to each, Andy's hands placed a plastic bag on each person's head, sealing it off around the neck. Each person in reply struggled as their air disappeared in the bag. With the clearness of the bag, it was easy to see each one gasp for air. When it was all done, each face had a permanent look of fear placed in death, made sense since none of them had a way to escape what was coming for them. As the film turned off, I stared numbly at the screen. No complaints escaping my mouth. With each film I watched, I could feel the horror inside of me disappearing. While I had disgust for this one, I didn't feel much about it. I didn't even flinch. Which made me question, were these films doing something to me? I knew that lack of emotions was never a good thing, but now I almost wished I felt this way when I saw my mom and sister fighting. It would make things easier. Thank you for all the follows on this story! I'm working hard on updating when I can which will probably be at least once a week so don't worry if I don't do another update within the week. I hope you guys enjoyed the kill tapes and that you enjoy my characters too. Love you guys! -Taliyatwo[Chapter 6] Normal POV Brandy coughed softly, shifting in her bed in a pitiful way. She didn't feel that great right now. Her body was sore and cold. After watching the movies last night she had a hard time falling asleep because she was thinking about them. They didn't scare her as expected, but they kept playing. Over and over again in her head. She was trying to understand their importance, but still hasn't found it yet. Why were they there? Why did the other kids make them? Gloria said they were made so she could watch them, but that didn't make any sense at all. She didn't want to believe those kids killed their families just for her. She turned around to look at her mother who had been rubbing her back in a comforting way. She had mentioned to her how disappointed she was about missing dance class. It was the highlight of her day and now she didn't have enough strength to get up and go to school. She had to sleep so her body would heal. Her mother placed a cool hand on her forehead. \"Yep, I'm thinking this is probably a cold honey. So it should only be one or two days before you feel good again.\" But, was mother feeling well? That was the question Brandy had as she believed her own mother looked worse than she did at this moment. The unhealthy color of her skin made her wonder if she even went outside anymore? If she even took a moment to contemplate that warmness the sunlight brought. She wanted that so bad for her, but she was scared to ask anything. Mother said she was fine. She said nothing was wrong even though she knew it was false. Brandy exhaled sharply as she nodded in response, looking directly into her mother's eyes. It was a comforting gesture for her, she just wanted her to feel happy. Mother was caught off guard for a second by it. She didn't know why Brandy chose that precise moment to look at her, just before she was about to say something. \"So, I... I was thinking I have a bring your kid to work day this Saturday, which is in a few days. Would you like to come to that honey? I know it might not be as interesting to you, but we can get ice cream as a treat after?\" She asked quickly. She noticed that Brandy was withdrawing after the fight between her and Carly and she wanted to fix her just as Brandy wanted to do the same. \"I guess so?\" Brandy answered in a whisper. She was trying to make an effort to help, if mother was happy, she was happy. If there was anything that could be done to help she would do it. Again, they say in silence. Both pleasantly surprised at the other. Her mother had expected to receive a no response and the fact Brandy said yes really meant a lot to her. It was progress to coax her out of the comfort she'll built around her which meant they would go back to normal soon. She could continue what she was doing such as the gambling which was bring extra income to the family. Carly said it was a sketchy business they didn't need in their home and she understood that. She would just take it very carefully so they didn't jump onto the dangerous path. Besides, she didn't have a problem. She knew she didn't have a problem. \"Are you okay?\" Brandy asked as she noticed her mom lost in thought. That was rare here especially since mother was a quick thinker just as Carly was. She didn't contemplate things, but rather followed on instinct. That was why Carly claimed the gambling was such a big issue. It made things so difficult when their mother followed her instincts. The motherly ones were still there, but sometimes the selfish ones took over and that happened more often than she claimed it did. It was almost a regular thing now and everyone was scared there wasn't going to be enough for them all to survive on. They needed money desperately now, and mother wasn't getting the help she needed so they would have that money. Carly's POV \"Come on Richards don't stop now! You've got one more lap to go!\" I heard my coach practically screaming as he noticed my speed slow down the slightest bit. This was a competitive team and he made sure we were constantly doing our bests. I could hear myself panting as it was hard to keep an even breath here. Running wasn't exactly the most simple sport. I had to constantly think so I wasn't going into my comfort zone. That was what coach called it, it was everyone's point where you didn't have to think. It was a relaxing point and he said that our best didn't exactly mean we felt relaxed, if we were relaxed than we weren't running fast enough. Exhaustion filled my body as I continued to move, trying to push more effort into my legs. It was difficult when they felt to the point of falling off and running off without me. I was trying my best to be faster than I Was last week. He said the constant practicing would help us to be faster so we all would beat the other team at the next meet. \"Come on slow poke, you really aren't gonna let me beat you this time? Are you?\" I looked to my side as Jessica grinned at me. She breathed deeply as she ran along side by me, ever so slightly getting faster and faster. At that moment I felt a rush of energy, grinning at her teasing tone. I wasn't going to let her beat me this time. I wasn't going to get a slower time than last time. \"Of course not.\" I replied cheekily as I bolted away from her. Finally passing the finish line within ten seconds of saying that. I looked back to see a laugh filling her chest as she ran to catch up with me. Finishing the next ten seconds after I did. \"See I told you, you weren't that tired.\" She said in between gasping breaths. \"It just took a little motivation is all. Just a little motivation to make you move faster.\" She laughed again, amused at how I had reacted. \"Psh, I always finish before you and you know it.\"I swatted her back playfully as she jogged away to grab her water bottle. As she ran off, the smile almost dropped off my face as there was nobody looking at me too see how I was feeling right now. In fact, I was almost overwhelmed with what was happening at home. Mother had come home last night very upset. She had lost a big amount of cash. The amount was something she wouldn't share with me. Yet, she was almost delusional about it as she believed she could earn it all back again today. She seriously had a big misunderstanding of how money worked. She was even considering placing a bet on a game. She wanted to place a bet bigger than how much we owned on a team because she was so positive they would come out on top. When I tried to talk her out of it, it was pointless. We were going to lose everything within the next few days and I was scared, I was terrified. \"Hey, hey.\" Jessica tapped my shoulder, getting my attention. \"I'm taking people home. You need a ride?\" I nodded gratefully. At least somebody was trying to help me, even if it didn't relate to the issue.\" Brandy's POV \"Pst.\" I heard a small sound leading me away from slumber. \"Pssssst.\" It was louder, more urgent this time. I looked up to see Conner and Gloria standing by the side of my bed, glancing at me curiously. \"What's wrong?\" Conner asked, he seemed to be concerned despite the fact earlier he mentioned not being able to feel anything. Something of which made me jealous. I groaned, slightly annoyed at being woken. \"I'm sick and I'm trying to get better.\" My voice crackled as I explained myself. Both of them seemed excited that I was here right now. \"Oh.\" Gloria said in surprise. \"I thought maybe you would want to do something else to get better.\" This caught my curiosity, I thought sleep was the only way to get better as It was something I always did while sick. Mother said sleep had healing properties and it would help me get better faster rather than sitting in bed all day awake and miserable. I lifted an eyebrow at her, asking for an explanation. \"We all thought that maybe you would want to come and play hide and seek with us.\" Gloria answered in explanation. I groaned again at her words, it hurt to move. \"I wish I could, but my body is so sore. And my mom said I would get better if I slept it off.\" I shifted positions slightly, feeling my back ache in complaint. Gloria pouted at me, disappointed that I didn't want to get up. I did, but I was so determined to get better so I could dance tomorrow. She glanced at Conner, whispering something into his ear. He nodded in agreement. \"What if I told you she was wrong?\" Conner said out loud. At that point, allI could do was stare in shock. \"B...but she's never wrong?\" I answered, my voice almost questioning what I had said. I was suddenly very unsure of myself. \"Really? Your mother is the one who is getting sick, and she sleeps every night after getting home, without waking a second.\" He leaned closer to me, as if it was a secret. \"And we all know sometimes she sleeps in past the alarm. Yet, she looks terrible.\" Conner's explanation seemed more logical than mother's he actually had facts backing him up. I sighed as I slipped my legs to the side of the bed. \"I guess I can play for a little bit. If you say so.\" \"We promise! Gloria said excitedly. \"If you play with us, you will feel better so fast. Faster than if you slept!\" \"Come on quick! Cinthia is seeking first!\" Conner exclaimed. With his words, Cinthia appeared by my side, along with Andy. \"Aww, come on that's not fair.\" She complained, only to quickly get over it. \"Everyone hide!\" She covered her eyes. \"One, two, three, four, five, six.\" I ran off, not hearing the rest of her counting as I tried to think about a great hiding spot. I opened one door to see Andy, he giggled as he pulled it closed while whispering. \"Sorry, already occupied.\" I ran, hearing foot steps approaching my way. Quickly, I slipped into the town closet, pulling myself up onto a shelf as I pushed some towels in front for better coverage. I could hear whispering and sounds of surprise as Cinthia began to find the other kids. It was about five minutes in when she found me. Laughing as Andy and Gloria stood by her side. \"Now, we've got to find Conner!\" Cinthia exclaimed joyfully. \"He's got to be here somewhere.\" \"Probably somewhere hard.\" Gloria said with a frown. \"You better not be cheating!\" She yelled out loud. \"You know which spots are out of bounds.\" At her words, we all heard a snicker and like instinct. Cinthia yanked the vent covering off to see Conner sitting inside. He hopped out yelling. \"My turn.\" And like that everyone bolted as he began counting. We went like that, over and over again for a few more rounds. I had forgotten I was sick, it was so much fun to play this game, especially since my family didn't do any sort of family time like this. On a round that I had lost count, I was the one searching. I was looking corner by corner, trying to find where they had hidden this time. I paused as I could feel somebody behind me, it was almost unnerving to feel being followed. I thought it was probably Andy playing a joke. I whirled around quickly only to feel my stomach drop as I looked at a dark figure watching me from the entryway of the kitchen. I was frozen as I stared at him, almost certain that maybe he was a monster going to hurt me very badly, at least, it felt that way. He was wearing a suit, very pitch black which went along well with his drooping black hair and grey ashy skin. His mouth, or the spot where it was supposed to be appeared to be sealed shut. I jumped at Cinthia grabbing my hand, staring at him with the same uneasiness as all the other kids appeared around me. Her words suggested otherwise from her expression. \"Don't worry, that's Mr. Boogie. He won't hurt you, I promise.\" \"Are you sure?\" To me, his presence felt almost menacing, it really was unsettling. \"Yes, we are. The only reason he would is if you did something to displease him and all you have done is things he likes. He just likes to watch, I promise. In fact, he will make sure you get done what you need to get done.\" Gloria added. I looked at her curiously as she said that. \"What do you mean?\" Was he going to help me do well while I was dancing? If he was, then I would be grateful. \"You'll see.\" The front door opened, Carly walking in as she waved at somebody outside before closing the door. I looked around to see all the kids and Mr. Boogie had disappeared, they didn't want anyone else to see them which I understood. Carly looked at me, confused to see I was up and about. \"Brandy? I thought you weren't feeling well?\" I looked around again, feeling warmth flood my body as I smiled at her. \"Actually I feel a lot better right now.\" Thank you for all the support guys! I'm sorry for the long wait, I just started my job this week and there was a lot of paper work I had to fill out. I also had a big project due that needed work done. Good news though, it was finished so I had time today to work on this chapter. I hope you guys enjoyed this one. Any guesses for what will happen next? -Taliyatwo[Chapter 7] Normal POV \"Mommy, please stop.\" Brandy said softly as she pulled the bottle from her mother's hands. \"Carly said that wasn't good for the baby.\" She patted her mother's round belly gently. It was a precious thing to her, it was for her mother too. She just forgot sometimes. Her eyes, studied the roundness as she felt bad for the child, it didn't deserve this at all. If anything, the child was more innocent than she had ever been. The videos had changed that, she was confused about what she was doing. \"I want the baby to be happy when it comes out.\" Brandy whispered, putting a stress on the word happy as it was her favorite word. She hummed softly as her hand moved in circles, it was a way for her to comfort. She froze, in a way that seemed deliberate, but wasn't as an image filled her head for a second. She could see a hand, stabbing her mother's round belly with an object she couldn't make out. Her face was full of horror as she looked back up at her mother, trying to figure out why that image came to her. Her mother, luckily was not drunk at the moment. Just slightly buzzed which kept enough room for emotional thought. \"Brandy honey you okay? You look like something spooked you.\" She said, with a voice that could speak to an injured animal. She still had a motherly instinct and knew when something was wrong. Brandy looked at her face, studying it as she slowly leaned forward into a hug. Resting her soft cheek against her mother's shoulder as she considered if talking about what she saw was a good idea or not. Looking forward at the hallway she spotted Cinthia and Conner, standing together calmly as they shook their heads. Cinthia placed one finger to her lips to let Brandy know it was supposed to be a secret. Brandy shivered as she felt a chill run down her back. A deep breath filled her lungs as she tried to shake off what she was feeling. Looking back, the two kids we gone just as they had appeared. Like a wisp of wind. She looked at her mother, very hesitant as she nodded to say she was okay. She couldn't find the strength to open her mouth and say anything. After all, Cinthia and Conner were her friends. They wouldn't let her do anything bad. And they wouldn't hurt her family at all because they cared about her. Her mother frowned as she patted her daughter's head . \"Don't worry, the baby is going to be just fine.\" Brandy lightly pressed an ear against her stomach. \"So, did you figure out if it was a boy or girl yet?\" She spoke in almost a whisper as she was slightly disoriented. \"No.\" Her mother answered with a voice just as quiet. \"But I'm sure we will know soon.\" Brandy smiled at her words, looking back up at her face. A tear slipped out of the corner of her left eyes as she did that motion. She was perplexed at it as her finger wiped the drop off her cheek, she had no idea why it was there. \"I'm fine.\" She said quickly before her mother could say anything. Coming to her small feet within seconds, she backed up rapidly to the door. \"I'm okay, I'll be okay.\" Her toes gripped the floor as she ran out before her mother could say anything. Donna watched her daughter leave, concern filling her chest at the girl's strange behavior. This wasn't who Brandy was, yet it was all she did lately. Gripping the bottle she had slipped out from her daughter's hand while she was distracted. A shuddering breath filled her chest as she stared at the direction her girl fled to. Quickly, she pulled the bottle to her lips to have the warm liquid dull the emotions she felt. Brandy slipped into the tight space of her cracked door. Sealing it shut as she looked seriously at all the other children sitting on her bed. \"Be honest, what's happening to me?\" \"I already told you, you need to finish watching the movies. There's just one more left and trust me, Jamie really wants you too see it. He's been waiting so long.\" Gloria said, the tone of her voice was almost whiny as she spoke. It was something that made Brandy feel very scared. \"That's not the reason you want me to watch it.\" She moved closely to Gloria, gripping her apron as she looked seriously at her. \"Why do you want me to watch it?\" Deliberately, Gloria yanked herself away, giving Brandy a mischievous look . \"Mr. Boogie wants you to watch it. I'm sure you can feel it too.\" Brandy shook her head to deny it, she couldn't describe what she was feeling and honestly, it was something she didn't want to know. \"But why?\" She asked more softly. \"Trust me, you'll know when it's time. You'll know.\" Gloria leaned closely to her ear, the mischief glimmered in her eye as she disappeared with the rest of the children. Carly's POV \"Let's figure out what the hell this is.\" I whispered to myself as I set down the box again. As much as I tried to l forget about that one film, it was disturbing and I wanted to know why somebody would make a film like that. It didn't seem right, yet they did it anyway. I was going to investigate this mess and put it to rest. Quickly the projector was set in place for watching. Watching these films seemed like the best idea as it was the only thing I had. I pulled out the first film that caught my eye. The title. \"Family vacation.\" Seemed innocent enough, yet in this context it was disturbing. I didn't know what I was going to see on this film. My hands were slightly shaky as I set it up, I was beginning to regret my decision because something so evil like this always had consequences. Without a doubt, these things always ended that way. Maybe, I could prevent that. I swallowed nervously as I turned the film on, wrapping a blanket around myself as the image flashed onto my pinned up bed sheet. The clicking of the projector was unnerving as the camera zoomed into a family in a roomy car. They were singing a tune, it was a shame I couldn't hear it. What ever it was though, they seemed to be having a really fun time. It made me wish I was there along with them as they had their family time. I could see a little toddler in a car seat along with her older brothers. The two boys had pulled out an old game system. I think they were called game boy colors? My family had never been interested in video games. One of the boys yelled angrily at the other, yanking the game from his brother as he glared. The mother flipped around from the front seat, scolding her boys as she took the game away. The camera flipped around to the camera man, revealing a boy who was probably younger than the other two. His dark hair was a messy nest on his head as he looked at the lens with bored eyes. He began to say something to the camera I couldn't hear, what ever it was, it sure looked like complaining. The camera whirled around as the car came to a stop. Quickly the kids hopped out of the car. The young boy filming followed slowly behind, focusing the camera on the house they were going to. I stared intensely as I recognized that house as our own. It was exactly where we were living which made this that much worse. As the scene changed. The camera was back in the car. The lens moved around to the back of the car. Pressing up against the back window to show what was there. Clearly, I could see members of the family, slowly coming back to consciousness as they tried to figure out where they were. They all had looks of panic as they realized their ankles were tied together and attached to the back of the car. The father sat up quickly, trying to untie himself from the car, but the knot on his ankle seemed to be too complicated. Suddenly, the screen on the camera began to vibrate. All I could assume was that somebody had started the car. The man opened up his mouth as he was suddenly yanked forward as the car began to move. Each family member flailed their arms as the car began to speed faster and dragged them. The rough ground ripped into their clothing and skin. Creating very deep wounds, very bad road rash. It came to the point where the bodies stopped fighting, their tense hands now completely relaxed as they were pulled along. Finally, after five minutes the car came to a stop. The camera man proceeded to pull the camera from its spot than take it outside. In a walking pace it came up to the family members. Each had horrific wounds on their skin. They were all torn into so badly by the ground. It came to a stop on the father. I thought he looked the worse. The skin on his face was hallway torn off. His bottom lip was hanging down, completely revealing his lower jaw. It pulled back as the camera man studied his fully body. His whole shirt was completely gone. It looked back at his face. Slowly, I watched as his mouth opened in pain. Then the camera turned off. I switched off the projector, closing my mouth with determination as I quickly pulled out my laptop. Typing quickly I searched for information. After all, this was our house. I wondered why the realtor never told us about the death that occurred here. Within seconds I had found her number, it wasn't that hard to do. I hesitated before hitting the call button on my phone. I didn't know if I wanted these details, but there was danger here and I couldn't ignore it. \"Hello?\" A nasally voice answered on the other side, she appeared annoyed that anyone was calling her. \"Hi, I'm this is Carly Richards I had some questions about the house my mom recently bought. I noticed you didn't include any information about the previous owners?\" There was hesitation on the other line. \"Yes, I didn't include it because your mother didn't ask about them.\" \"Well I was wondering if you could tell me why they moved out?\" I knew exactly what she would say. Nobody ever wanted to talk about murder. \"I'm sorry I don't want to talk about that.\" She answered nervously. \"I need to know. I'm serious, otherwise I will tell my mother and trust me we will be out of here faster than you can notice.\" I threatened, besides it was the only way people like this communicated. \"They didn't move out they died.\" She said slowly. \"That house was actually their vacation home.\" Now, the title. \"Family vacation,\" made a lot of sense. \"Can you describe to me what happened?\" \"I'm not allowed to disclose that. All I can say is that it was an accident with their car.\" As I was about to say more she stopped me. \"Now, I can't say anymore. Goodbye.\" The line crackled as she hung up. That was okay anyway, I had gotten the information I needed. I pulled out another film to start watching. \"Thanksgiving Dinner.\" It read innocently. I sighed as I pulled out the other reel than set that one in place. \"This is going to take some time.\" And I certainly wasn't going to like it. Watching these things wasn't pleasant at all, but I felt it was the reason why things were suddenly going wrong at home and if I knew how to end this I would. Hey guys! Thank you for keeping me going. :) All your support has been really great as I write this story. I wasn't sure about writing this so the fact all you people like it too makes me really happy. See you all next chapter! -Taliyatwo[Chapter 8] Carly's POV It was late into the night when I finally finished the last of the films. Blankly, I stared at the white sheet trying to process all the chaos through my head. None of this compared to any of the horror movies I had watched before. Usually I watched horror movies for things like a date and that was meant to be fun. But this, these movies were pure evil. No fun in them at all. Who ever made them wanted the next person watching it to see all the suffering on the family's faces. All I could feel was numbness because it didn't make sense at all? All these titles Family Vacation? Makin' Maple Syrup? Game Night? Thanksgiving Dinner? Rooftop Garden? All very innocent titles and yet they didn't show innocence at all. It made me wonder, what person in their right mind would create these? The camera man almost took glee in what they were doing. There were few things I noticed that were very similar in each film. First, each family had consumed something prior to being murder. Something I assumed caused them to be vulnerable so the murderer could take action. Next, there was always one child in the family that ended up missing. The killer took them somehow? Probably even made them watch the whole murder. That made me feel sick. I honestly couldn't believe it. Finally, in each film you couldn't see the killer at all. I usually got a glimpse of their hands, but it was nothing more which only added to this mystery. Who was killing these people? Was it the same person or different ones? Was it a cult ritual? Knowing what I knew was terrifying. It made me wonder when this killer would strike next because the time of the kills were very random. Sometimes they were spread apart by a few years and other times they were almost decades apart. The killer seemed to kill when it pleased them which made no sense. Was it even possible to kill for both ritual and pleasure? Did the killer have capabilities to feel that much? Because the videos suggested they probably had no capacity for human empathy. As the dread began to coat me, I felt hopeless. I didn't know how to stop this let alone find the origin. How could I save people? Reaching my hand mindlessly to the table I snatched my pill container off the surface. It was almost automatic as I placed pressure on the bottle so it would open. These bottles were supposed to be \"child proof.\" Yet, they were easy to open for anyone who could read instruction. The clear words on the lid told anyone exactly how to open it. As I tipped it out and felt air land on my palm I glanced at it in panic, peeking inside the empty container. I could feel my throat drying in dread as I realized I forgot to refill my medication. I didn't have anything to help control my condition and that only made things worse. I needed them, I needed them so badly. I didn't have the ability to cry at this moment. It wasn't the same emotion as what I was feeling right now. I wanted it to end so badly right now. Allowing the container to drop out of my hand. I collapsed down onto my bed. All I could see was black above me. Softly materializing, a face appeared above my head. His face a dark ashy grey. The place were his lips were meant to be were sealed. It hit me a second later as terror seemed to seep out from that face into my chest. I opened my mouth to scream, only to be cut off as his hands seemed to grip my throat, cutting off the air. I was frozen like a statue as the world seemed to spin away. Into the numbness I desired. Normal POV Bughuul stared down at the girl as she went limp. Releasing his cold hands from her skin. She was getting too nosey with his business and he didn't like it. That had happened twice before and he took care of the two who investigated too much. This girl wouldn't get far enough anyways. She was in no way mentally well enough for this. The children all stood behind him. Practically glowering at the girl. They liked coming to this world, especially considering the condition they were in. With Bughuul slowly consuming their souls, they didn't have a lot of time left. Their bodies were practically ready to fall apart. If she messed up anything they would be gone. Bughuul would be furious and punish them for the mistake. Especially since it was their job to prep the next child for the next ritual. They all looked at the door as the nob wiggled. Each running to a hiding spot as they disappear from sight. Bughuul tilted his head, leaning towards the girl with an exhale as the door opened and he vanished. \"Carly, Carly!\" Brandy yelled in a shrill voice as Matthew and Riley followed along with her. \"Carly!\" Her voice was more urgent as she shook her sister trying to wake her up. She nearly released her own scream as Carly sat up drowsily. \"Why? Wha... What?\" She asked sharply. \"Somethings wrong, there's noise in mom's room.\" Riley stated quickly. Carly came back to awareness, looking at each of her siblings with concern. Those words were so vague. \"I saw a strange man go into her room with her.\" With that Carly shot up, ready to go help. She was scared, terrified. What if that \"man.\" Was the thing that choked her only moments ago? If it was. Their mother could end up worse than her. Physically, she was a lot weaker and probably had no chance against this man who was probably much bigger than she could deal with. Even then, was this being an actual man or something else? She practically slid down the hall as she rushed to her mother's door. As she opened it. Her eyes widened. There was only shock as she realized this was just a random man. Pinning down her own mother and beating her roughly. Her mother stared at her with a pained face, blood running out of her nose as she struggled to get away from this man much bigger than her. \"No!\" Carly yelled as she rushed at the man to help her mother. All she felt was rage, why was this man doing this? It was all for nothing as the man easily flipped off of her mother and pinned her down. She struggled as his weight on her body made it useless. Grinning, he brought down his fist onto her stomach. Receiving a breathless gasp of pain that signaled Carly's silence. \"Please, that's my daughter. She has nothing to do with this.\" Donna pleaded. She coughed quietly, looking helpless at her daughter. The man chuckled, seeming to add more weight onto the girl. \"She doesn't know does she Donna?\" \"Please don't...\" \"What? What's the problem with her knowing about your money issues? You owe me and my friends a lot and the longer you make us wait. The more impatient we become. Surely, you daughter would be sufficient enough to pay off this debt.\" The man spoke almost gleefully. Referring to Carly as if she was an item. \"Besides,\" he stroked Carly's cheek as she glared at him angrily. \"She's a very pretty girl.\" \"Not my daughter, never my daughter. I told you, I can get you the cash in a few weeks. I'll have the sufficient amount of funds to pay you then.\" At this point Donna was speaking carefully, trying not to strike a nerve on this man. He rolled his eyes dramatically. \"That's what you said two weeks ago and you came up with nothing.\" \"P..please.\" Carly whispered quietly as he pressed his elbow sharply into her gut. At that point, Matthew and Riley watching from the door were practically in tears. They were scared and didn't want anything to happen. They didn't want to lose their older sister. Brandy, filled herself with every drop of bravery she had. Approached the man cautiously. \"Please sir, that's my sister. I need her.\" There was a noticeable shaking in her body as she held back the instinct to run away. The man mostly ignored her as to him, she was like a helpless little bug who could do nothing. \"Please, my mommy will pay you back. She promises.\" She stood still for a moment, only inches away from him. He continued to ignore her, as if she wasn't there which only added to their suspense. \"Please sir, I-\" That was all she got in as the man whirled around, slapping his big hand against her soft cheek. The sheer force of it caused her to tumble to the ground, forcing a sharp pain on that side of her face. After that, there was silence as her mother stared at the man in horror. He had just slapped her child, her most fragile one. He had attacked her and two of her children. She wasn't willing to see him hurt her two boys two. Angrily, she pushed herself up as she slipped off her wedding ring. Something so precious and valuable. Yet, at this moment it meant nothing compared to her children. She quickly passed it to him. Telling him she was not willing to see anymore. \"Please get out. That should help you for your troubles.\" Her tone was exhausted, almost defeated. She had tried to get an extension and it didn't work. Now they were in a big mess. He released Carly, causing her to sigh in relief as air filled her lungs. All she could do was stare forward in shock as the overwhelming emotions of her depression filled her body. She didn't want to move. Studying the ring, he nodded in approval, grinning from ear to ear at Donna. \"I knew it, they said you were holding back. Looks like I got exactly what I came from.\" He laughed as he brushed off his pants. \"Oh and Donna, don't come to another game unless you want trouble like this again.\" With a conflicted expression Donna nodded. She didn't want her children to get hurt so, she would just have to find another game to join in on. If they didn't want her surely someone else would be more accepting. And less harsh with the payments. Within the minute he was gone and out of the house. Donna began to tend to her children, helping Carly sit up. She stared at Brandy with concern as she hadn't moved after being slapped. \"Honey,it's okay now. He's gone.\" But, to Brandy it wasn't okay. It was never going to be okay. At that moment she had hit an epiphany, her family was having a lot of trouble and there was no way to fix it at all. It was just going to get worse from there. She didn't want that. Donna bent down to look at her daughter's face. Seeing this indescribable rage mixed with the startling purple bruising on her face. Then, like that, it completely dropped as her expression became blank. It was so unusual when Brandy stood up silently without any acknowledgement as she headed towards the door. Her brothers, wordlessly moved out of her way, staring at her with their own shock. They had never seen this side of her either. She looked back at her mom for a second with a cold expression before moving at a frighteningly calm pace to Carly's room. She stepped in then locked the door behind herself. She whistled a familiar tune to herself. Musing as she tried to decide what to do. Then she whirled around, flickering her eyes back and forth at the ghost children, a small smile appeared on the corner of her lip. \"It's time, I'm ready to watch the last one.\" Next chapter guys! In excited about this one because it's almost the end of this story. Not quite yet though. Any guesses for what is going on with Brandy? Where do you guys think this is leading? Anyways! See you next chapter. -Taliyatwo[Chapter 9] Normal POV \"You know what to do.\" Gloria said, standing closely next to Brandy as they watched Donna sleep. The two children seemed to have synchronized movement as they looked at each other. Brandy nodded slowly with a smile reaching her lips as she ran to her mother's bed. Giving it one small bounce before tapping her mother's shoulder. \"Mommy, are we still going to your work thingy today?\" \"Hmmm?\" Her mother replied in a sleepy tone. Slightly shifting to face her daughter. It took all her strength to not cringe as she saw the brown bruising on her cheek. \"You know, the thing where you take me to work with you?\" \"I.. I thought maybe you didn't want to go because of yesterday.\" Her mother was hesitant as she spoke, studying every motion of her daughter to suggest as she was thinking. \"Of course I want to go silly.\" Brandy giggled quietly looking at her mother as if getting hit yesterday wasn't a big deal. \"Besides, I really want that ice cream you promised.\" Sitting up with a surprised expression she tried to find if her emotions were genuine. \"Okay, if you want to. I just have to cover up the little cuts on my face.\" She replied, giving in to her daughter's desire. She would do anything she could to make her family feel comfortable again where they were. Quietly, Brandy moved closer to her mother. Reaching out a finger to poke the deeper one on her nose, making contact with no refusal. She was interested in the feel. Suddenly beginning to push harder without much thought until her mother cried out in surprise. \"Ow, ow. Honey please don't. I can't have you picking at this or it won't heal.\" \"Oh.\" Brandy quietly whispered in response. Her eyes were filled with innocence as she stared at her mother. \"I'm sorry.\" As she thought about it though, she didn't really feel any need to apologize. Besides, the cut wasn't her fault. Her mother nodded. \"It's fine, just be careful okay. I know you didn't mean it.\" Ruffling the girl's hair playfully, she forced her mouth to give an even wider smile. \"Now, how about I get ready and you go eat breakfast okay? You can have the sugary cereal I normally let you have on weekends.\" At that Brandy perked up with a nod. She bolted towards the kitchen to have her sweet breakfast. \"How did it go?\" Gloria asked as Brandy poured the cereal into a bowl. Quietly, Brandy finished filling up what she needed then moved to her fridge to grab milk. She looked back at the other children nonchalantly, completely accepting. \"Perfect, everything is going according to plan. I will be able to do it tomorrow.\" Brandy's POV I loved them so much, how could I not? They were people constantly by my side, never-failing to show up when needed. I wanted that to continue, but with where we were going in this life, it didn't seem possible. My mother and sister were both depressed, they thought I didn't know it. But, I wasn't stupid. I just downplayed my knowledge when speaking to them. Anyway for them to feel comfort. It was mainly their personalities that told it to me. People's personalities are always plain out in the open. No matter how hard you try, you can't hide it. Someone will always see it and expose you for who you are. I always observed everything, you see people never pay attention to the quiet ones because we rarely say anything. But, the thing about being quiet is you notice every little change that happens. No matter how small it is, you can see it. I was delusional thinking my family would go back to normal. Things went downhill as soon as dad died. It was a car crash, the doctors said he died instantly so there was no suffering. But, everyday our family suffered dearly for it. Everyday everyone was slowly diverting into their selfish default settings. \"Brandy, honey what are you looking at?\" My mother asked as she finished filling out paper work. I had been staring into the open air, lost in my thoughts. \"Nothing.\" I piped up quietly. Of course she didn't take that into thought at all. \"Okay, I'm gonna go turn this in to the files. Stay right here I'll be back okay, then you can see some more interesting things. I promise.\" My mother tried to explain her words in an exciting tone. She was trying even though it was hopeless. I nodded as she left me alone at the desk. Silently placing my feet on the floor, I moved to the hallway. Intent on taking some souvenir with me. \"Come on.\" Gloria said as she and Cinthia appeared by my side. \"We found the perfect thing. It's awesome.\" She giggled, her voice bouncing down the hall as she ushered me towards a certain room. I felt no hesitation as I entered the room. From a quick observation it was sterile, a clean environment for what it held. The syringes we tightly packed, each container labeled for what they did. They words were ones I didn't understand, but so many options. I was normally scared of needles. My mom got us flu shots every year and usually did them herself. Honestly, the prick was the worst part. Yet, at this moment, none of that mattered. I wasn't scared of a little needle. In fact, I was fascinated with what it held. Cinthia pointed towards a specific container. \"Take one, they'll never notice.\" \"Are you sure? I don't want to get caught.\" I asked in my careful voice, if it was to be done, it had to be perfect. \"Yes, they are perfectly clueless.\" At her words. I snatched one out, tapping the safety tip that covered the needle. I stuffed it into my jacket pocket then stepped out into the hallway to see my mother's completely panicked face as she rushed over. Embracing me tightly. \"Please don't do that.\" She reached over pulling the door tightly shut. \"That room was supposed to be locked, I'm not sure how you got in.\" I pouted as she spoke, showing confusion in my eyes as she talked about how I wasn't supposed to go into the room. \"I'm sorry mommy, I just wanted to see what there was. I didn't touch anything, I swear.\" She let out a shuddering breath, looking at me with a slightly relieved expression. \"It's okay, I'm over reacting. How about we go look at my things? Hmm?\" I smiled. \"Okay.\" With that, she lead me down to another room. I placed my hand on the pocket, feeling the outline of the needle. Carly's POV I leaned against the cart with a sour expression on my face. I didn't want to be here, but mom insisted on a family shopping trip. All of us were here. But, each person was doing their own thing. My mother was strolling down the aisles, checking off items on her list as she found them. Matthew and Riley were playing around the toy aisle. They argued over a bat with a shiny gleam to it. Each wanted it as much as the other. Especially since it was the last one. Brandy was practicing her dance routine. Her recital was in a week and it was all she could think about. It was all she wanted to do. I watched her pulled out a bottle of lemonade then skip over to my mother. Instantly receiving a nod of approval. She gave me a one second glance as she placed it in the cart, then moved back to doing her own thing. My stomach still hurt from when that man was at our house. But, nothing compared to the dull ache I felt. The dread, and the overwhelming sense of wanting things to end. I needed more medication, but with the situation. My mother couldn't afford it. She didn't even have the heart to tell Brandy she couldn't afford her school either. I looked towards the fruit aisle, noticing a teenage boy watching me. His shaggy brown hair and thin tall figure suggested to me he had to be at least 15 to 16 years old. As he noticed I saw him, a red color spread across his cheeks in embarrassment. Nervously he smiled as he shuffled away slowly. I snorted, it was amusing the gesture he was giving me. Then, changing his mind he approached me. \"A... Are you shopping by yourself?\" He asked quietly, the tone of his voice almost reminded me of Brandy. A quiet and sweet personality. \"No, I'm out with my family.\" I replied with an obligatory smile. The way he moved, he was almost folding into himself, it had me very intrigued. \"If I had a choice I probably wouldn't have come.\" I said to make more conversation. \"No no me too. My mom had me come because she doesn't like to leave me alone. You think she would be comfortable since I'm 16, but I guess I can kind of understand in a way. \" he replied in a vague way to make a connection with me. I let out a laugh at his words, feeling the smile become more real. I nodded in agreement, both our parents had reasons for bringing us shopping. My mother was really concerned with my depression so she didn't want me alone. And she wanted our family to have some bonding time. \"I'm Carly, and you are?\" I held out my hand for him to shake. He seemed pleasantly surprised as he opened his mouth to reply. But, he didn't get too far as Brandy rushed towards me with excitement. \"Carly! Carly! Mom said we could get cookies. Do you want the milk chocolate ones or the white chocolate ones?\" In a quick movement she was in front of me, wrapping her arms around my torso. The boy seemed to have a random shiver run up his back. It seemed to be familiar to him as he glanced uncomfortably at my sister. \"I'm good with the milk chocolate.\" I replied more loosely. Brandy didn't reply, looking at the boy who was talking to me. His face seemed to morph into a horrified one, but so small most wouldn't notice it. \"Okay, thanks!\" Brandy pulled away, running to my mom to tell her. \"Anyways, what is your name?\" I asked, deciding to ignore his weird facial expressions. He seemed to shake it off as he looked at me with a serious expression. \"That's not important, I have to tell you something that is very urgent.\" I folded my arms, looking at him with a lifted brow. \"Urgent, really?\" He reached out, gripping both of my arms as he moved me closer. \"Listen I'm serious when I say this. Your family is in danger. Something bad is going to happen if you don't stop it. You need to burn your house down or something like that. And...\" His voice was hesitant as he spoke. \"I wouldn't trust your sister.\" \"What?\" I said, blinking my eyes rapidly. His words were strange, but in a way I understood them. After watching those films I couldn't shake off the feeling something bad was going to happen. \"Please, just please listen to me.\" He whispered desperately. A voice sounded, bringing him to attention. \"I have to go.\" \"No wait, I don't understand.\" I said to him as he began to pull away. He moved more urgently to the one calling him. \"Wait!\" \"Dylan, come on it's time to go.\" I watched as a woman with a southern accent turned the corner with her cart. Ushering the boy to follow her. He looked back at me one last time. \"Just remember what I said. Please remember it.\" He began to walk away with the women, helping her push the cart as they moved to check out. I watched him all the way until he disappeared from my line of sight. \"Carly, mom says she got everything.\" Matthew said, beaming at me as he held the bat, well I guess I know who won that argument. I nodded, following him so I could go home. Hey guys! Just letting you know there is one more chapter after this. Thank you for staying with me as long as you all have. I really appreciate it! As we come to the last chapter can I get any predictions? What do you guys think will happen here! Until next time. -Taliyatwo[Chapter 10] Carly's POV I guess I should have expected this. With how life was going there was always a mystery to how my mother afforded the house. The truth was she didn't. She could no longer pay for it, and because of that we had to go back to the old one. A house full of bad memories we tried to leave behind and now here we were, creating new ones in a house meant to be a restart on our lives. Physically, Matthew and Riley were the most upset. I could still hear occasional sniffles coming from the back seat. They had just become part of a little league baseball team in the area. Something that held so much excitement for them. And, now that we were going back. That would never happen. Me and my mother were on the same level about the situation. All I could feel was disappointment. She promised this would never happen and it happened because of her carelessness. At this point, I didn't care anymore because the truth hurt too much. Brandy, I didn't understand. It was different than what I expected as there was no protest from her. She only seemed to accept this was happening. When we left the house she said to me. \"There's nothing we can do. I see no point in being upset.\" It didn't make any sense to me because she loved the school she went to so much and now she didn't give it so much as a wave goodbye. It made me think back to what Dylan said to me. To not trust Brandy, it was hard to believe that. Especially since she was such a innocent girl. She barely understood how the world worked. And she wasn't capable of causing harm. She would never do it if given the choice because she always saw peaceful alternatives. All Brandy wanted was for us to be happy. She was always doing things to brighten our day. \"You okay?\" I asked Brandy as calmly as I could. \"Yeah, I'm kind of excited to see my old room you know?\" Brandy spoke softly, her voice genuine yet mysterious. \"It still had my ballet barres up and I really like them.\" She constantly practiced dance all day so I could understand her obsession with that. I nodded as the house came into view from the window. \"Maybe, this is what it's meant to be.\" Brandy said as her eyes studied the familiar curve of the door. \"I mean, fate choses things for you, doesn't it?\" I swallowed dry air, unable to say much more about it. The car came to a smooth stop and there was silence for a few minutes. Mom finally looked back, speaking in a grownup voice. \"I know it's not much, but trust me. The moving vans will bring everything else within the next few days. It will get better.\" Normal POV Brandy carried the iPod stereo, placing it carefully on the metal chair she had placed against the wall. Her eyes studied the room, the four plastic chairs set up across the wall as seating for the audience. The perfect reflection of the mirror as it gleamed from her wiping it down. The small table of chocolate chip cookies and lemonade as refreshments. Her fingers daintily stroked the hand written invitations she had created for everyone. Since they couldn't see her perform at her school dance recital, a homemade recital would have to do. She moved to a mirror to make sure her costume was perfect. Her fingers lightly pulled on the tutu, making sure it was sticking out stiffly as it should. She patted the beaded design of her bodice then looked closely to make sure none of her hairs were flying away from the tightly wound bun on her head. She then fiddled with the small tiara on her head until it was centered in place. Her eyes wandered down to her feet. Seeing the pointe shoes shining brightly along with her ribbons tucked into place. Smiling, she nodded at her reflection. Skipping away to hand out her invitations for the recital. Placed by her old bed which was pushed away for more room was the 8 mm camera. Propped up with a few pillows as it was set in place. Gloria, stood next to it. Adjusting the position as she waited for the show to start. Within a few minutes, the whole family followed Brandy into her room. Carly looked exhausted as she trudged along slowly. She liked the kindness of Brandy's gesture, but she didn't really feel in the mood to be doing anything. All she wanted to do was sleep. Brandy curtsied to her family as she thanked them for coming to her show. \"I thought that maybe a little dance show would be fun for you guys. I know things have been rough and I just want you all to be happy.\" She grinned, showing all her bright teeth. She walked over to refreshment. Passing a cookie to each person. Carly smiled at her sister sadly as she came up to her. \"Thanks, but I'm not feeling all too hungry right now.\" Nodding, she moved on to the lemonade. Making sure each person had one in their hands. Carly accepted it, then placed the cup right next to her chair. Brandy seemed to be filling with excitement as she handed the remote to her mother. \"Press play when I tell you to.\" Her feet seemed to glide along the floor as she moved to her bed. She bent down to press something then stood up, posing in place. \"Okay, ready.\" At her words, a soft classical tune played. The beats were in a waltz time as it started to pick up. Brandy slowly moved her arms along with her leg. Pointing her toe in front of herself as she pressed her weight onto that one leg. Effortlessly, her back leg lifted up into a 75 degree angle, giving her no trouble as she held it in place. Then she bent her standing leg, using that effort to go up onto pointe. All of it seemed to come naturally to her body as she moved along carelessly. Her face was one full of grace, showing no sign of discomfort from what she did. Her head tilted along with her body as it was fit. She did a few more movements then came to a prepping position, her body posed in utter concentration. Then, she pushed up onto on leg. Twirling in a dizzying way, her right leg moved from the front, to the side, then to a bent position helping her continue to move. She stayed in a balance that it seemed impossible for her to fall down. Riley looked towards his mom, his expression having become an unfocused one as he spoke to her. \"Mommy, I don't feel so well.\" His expression was that of exhaustion. He seemed too confused to cry . Brandy continued to dance, not taking time to notice her brother. His eyes seemed to droop as the cup slipped from his hand and he fell asleep. Donna blinked her eyes, feeling the same exhaustion too as her body began to shut down. She tried to help up Matthew who was beginning to fall asleep. Only to collapse to the floor as white foam leaked from her mouth. Within seconds, Matthew collapsed onto his mother Carly came to her feet with a horrified expression as her foot knocked over the cup placed by her chair. By that point, Brandy had stopped dancing too. Staring at her sister with a terrified expression. \"What's happening?\" Her voice trembled as she seemed to be struggling to stay calm. \"Come on, we have to get out of here.\" Carly spoke rapidly as she realized the person who made the films was trying to kill her family now. Brandy shook her head as she spoke. \"No, what about them, we can't just leave them.\" She seemed to be more concerned with the others rather than her own safety. \"We can call the police, what we have to do is leave right now. Come on.\" Carly held out her hand for her sister ushering for the little girl to hold it. Brandy seemed to give it, moving over to grab her sister's hand. Carly looked back, to make sure everything was safe, her eyes pausing as she spotted the 8mm camera running. Everything on her began to scream as Dylan's words played in her head again. \"I wouldn't trust your sister.\" It was all beginning to make sense now, and she didn't know why she didn't put it together before this. It was the kids doing it, besides, nobody ever suspects the kids. As she pulled her hand away from Brandy she felt a sharp prick in her arm. She looked at Brandy in horror as she pulled the empty syringe from the area. Betrayal was in her eyes as Brandy's expression seemed to become completely calm. \"I'm not stupid.\" Brandy uttered in a chilling tone. \"They told me you knew about the movies.\" Carly slowly slid to the group as she felt consciousness slip out of reach. Brandy bent down to look at her one more time. \"I'll make all the pain go away.\" At her words Carly groaned as she went completely limp. Carly's POV As I began to wake up, I felt sharp pain in my mouth. As if I had just chewed on glass. I opened my mouth to a familiar metallic tang as a hard piece seemed to slip out. I slowly trailed my head down to see it was a piece of mirror. All points poking out. Looking side to side, my wrists were pulled up and tied to Brandy's ballet bar. My ankles were tied together, completely immobilizing me from much movement. Brandy's mirrors were completely shattered, the pieces decorating the floor around us. In front of me was a strange symbol painted on the floor. It wasn't familiar besides the fact, what was used to paint it was a familiar liquid. I looked over to the right to see Matthew and Riley tied right next to me. Their bodies completely limp and it was clear they were gone. Shards of the mirror seemed to be embedded into almost every part of their bodies possible. Red still dripped from the fresh wounds as Riley's head hung in my direction, the look of complete terror forever frozen on his face as blood dripped from his mouth and neck. \"No.\" I tearfully whispered. I grunted with effort as I tried to free myself from my bindings, but my body was still weak from what Brandy used to knock me out. I heard a scream from mother forcing my head to turn to the other direction. She was tied in the same position. Brandy stood in front of her, not having bothered to change out of her dance costume as it was now stained with blood. She held the camera in one hand. Using the other to pick up pieces of the mirror off the ground and then stab them into mother's body. She picked up another, seeming to rub her hand gently on my mother's round belly. Speaking soothingly to the baby. \"Don't worry you won't have to suffer anything. I'm sending you somewhere far away.\" She then roughing stabbed the piece onto my mother's belly, receiving another cry of pain. Rapidly, she stabbed more and more pieces, heavily concentrating them on the belly as my mother sobbed. Then, she picked up the final piece, harshly shoving into into mother's throat. There was gurgling for a few seconds, then mother went silent. Brandy nodded in approval then walked over to me. \"No! No!\" I screamed even though it pained my mouth as I spoke. \"Please don't do this. Please.\" Brandy looked at me remorselessly as her hand scooped a shard off the ground. I looked forward to see a dark figure watching her earnestly. The same one who had knocked me out after watching the films. Pain radiated from my arm as she started stabbing pieces of the mirror into it. She moved quickly, repeating the motion over and over again all over my body. I could feel my head beginning to spin from the blood loss. \"Please.\" I whispered to her again as she continued to do it. \"Brandy please, I love you.\" She didn't hesitate at my words, they seemed to stir nothing in her at all. As the last piece of glass pierced my throat, I gasped for breath struggling to hold onto the last bit of life. I didn't want to die yet, there was too much left to do. It wasn't fair. As I began to think about the last few week I could feel my depressive thoughts taking over. Making this seem like the greatest kindness I had received. Then I accepted my fate. I slowly slipped into the darkness. Grateful that I wouldn't feel this ever again. Epilogue: Brandy's POV It had been a few years since I completely Mr. Boogie's ritual and killed my family. Doing it had been easy as I began to feel nothing. Now, all I do is feel nothing. No guilt, no pain. I didn't even seem to mind my family was gone. Why should I when I have all the other children to play with? They were all great fun and accepted me completely. Sadly, Connor was beginning to dwindle. It wouldn't be long until he completely disappeared. All the other children mentioned there having been countless of other children who played with them. That was the thing, since Mr. Boogie ate our souls we slowly began to disappear. While it was an uncomfortable experience, it never hurt. That was why the ritual had to continue. As long as we did it, we were allowed to play in the human world. It was fun and a much easier place to move in. \"Are you ready to do this?\" Gloria asked as I stared out the window at the moving vans. Waiting the few years for a new occupant in the house had prepared me completely for the next child to join us. I nodded confidently as I moved to my old room. The realtor had completely cleaned it out to remove all the traces of me she could. The only thing she couldn't pull out was a section of mirror I left completely unharmed. Still sparkling as brightly as the day I had cleaned it. Nobody knew it was me who had killed my family. As far as they were concerned, I was missing and would never be found. The murder of the Richards family confounded everyone. It was a mystery that terrified people and nobody seemed to want to investigate it. Even the police gave up within a few weeks of getting nowhere. I looked at the boy who seemed to be hanging up colored belts on the wall. They looked to be level up belts for karate. Something I didn't see a lot of when I was still alive. I think there was a studio open somewhere down the street. A man taught it at his house, or something like that. He had a frustrated expression on his face as he moved around. He was probably very upset about moving, most kids would be. As he stepped in front of the mirror looking at himself, I let myself finally be seen. Standing directly behind him which seemed to startle him as I spoke. \"You know, this was my favorite spot.\" I said, reminiscing of the time before this. He whirled around, staring wide eyed at me as his eyes studied my tutu. \"Hi I'm Brandy, what's your name.\" I held out my hand for him to shake it.\" \"G-Greg.\" He stuttered as he shook my hand in response. \"Well Greg.\" I felt a smile slide onto my face as I spoke. \"We are going to have so much fun.\" Thank you so much for all the support guys! It has been really helpful with me writing this story. Thank you for encouraging me to continue and especially for getting on me when I haven't updated. :) I really enjoyed writing this story and hope to write more in the future when I have time.

Why would you wantnto marry him\" exploded Ellie \"HEY! calm down\" shoutednMelanie. \"Wait a minute you can't marry himncause you're not divorced from your first husband\" smiled Ellie \"You mean the man you called daddynfor 9 years\" replied Melanie \"Yeah him, if he hasn't divorcednyou by now what makes you think he ever will?\" asked Ellie \"Yeah Mummy what about Daddy?\"nasked Gabby innocently \"Why, do you call him that? nYou've never met him, he isn't the hero you think he is, he doesn'tngive a damn about you or any of us\" said Ellie Viciously. \"Hey leave her alone. Gabby whyndon't you go to your room for a minute\" said Melanie Gabby got up and went down the hall tonher bedroom. \"Who the hell do you think younare? You don't tell her things like that, she's seven years old,nespecially when they're not true. She thinks Jake is a hero and younwere exactly the same at her age.\" said Melanie angrily \"Well. I don't want her makingnthe same mistakes I did and Jake doesn't care\" \"Yes he does, he sends you presentnevery christmas, easter, thanks giving and birthday. He also callsnon all the holidays even since you decided he doesn't exist.\" \"Yeah me but what about Gabby? Hendidn't even come and see her when she was born, in fact he's nevernseen her, his own daughter.\" \"That's not his fault\"nreplied Melanie quietly \"How do you figure that\" saidnEllie and then suddenlt realising \"he doesn't know about herndoes he?\" \"No he doesn't\" said Melanien\" and now I have to go back to get him to sign the divorcenpapers. I need you to come with me I can't do it on my own\" Ellie put her arm round her mother \"It's okay I'll come, but as soonnas he signs we leave\" \"Yeah, I don't wanna spend anymorentime there than necessary\" Ellie suddenly remembered why they hadnto get Jake to sign the papers and took her hand off her mother andntook a step back. \"I'm doing this for Gabby. Shendeserves to know who her father is even if it is just for her to findnout that she's much better off without him. But don't think thatnthis means I'm happy about you and Andrew and that I won't doneverything I can to make sure that the wedding doesn't happen.\"[Chapter 3] Going Home Ellie was sitting in the passenger seatnof her mum's new mercedes jeep. They were almost in Greenville,ntheir plan was to go to Jake's and get him to sign the divorce papersnand then leave. Both Ellie and Melanie knew it wouldn't be as easynas that. Ellie wasn't sure how she felt aboutnseeing her father again, she haad cut him out of her life 6 years agonand she had tried not to think about him, but she couldn't help it,nshe had always been a daddy's girl, at first she had hated her mothernfor taking her away from him. Melanie looked over at Ellie, she wasnjust like Jake, she had the same curly blonde hair and ocean blueneyes, she also had his stubborn nature. Ellie was looking out thenwindow, Melanie knew she was thinking about Jake. Three years agonMelanie was looking for something in Ellie's room when she camenacross, Ellie's old toy chest that Jake had made her when she was anbaby, tucked in the back of her closet. Inside the chest Melanie hadnfound all the pictures of Jake and Ellie together that she had takennwhen she left. Melanie thought that Ellie had thrown all the cardsnand gifts Jake sent her away, but they were all there in the chest. nMelanie knew that no matter what she said Ellie was still hurtingnover Jake but what she didn't understand was why she cut him out ofnher life. Melanie then looked into the back seatnat her younger daughter, Gabby had been so excited when she found outnthey were going to see her daddy, she had barely slept the nightnbefore. Melanie then pulled up outside anfamilar house. \"This is it, we're here.\"[Chapter 4] Jake 'This is it no turning back now'nthought Melanie \"Okay you two stay here rightnnow,\" ordered Melanie as she put on her sunglasses and grabbednher bag. Melanie got out the the car and whennshe did, a dog on the porch started to bark. Unfazed by this Melanientook the divorce papers and a pen out of her bag. \"It's alright, he won't hurt you. nQuiet Brian\" said Jake as he came out of the house, \"Whatncan I do for you?\" he asked not recognizing Melanie with hernsunglasses on. \"Well a divorce would be a goodnstart\" said Melanie removing her sunglasses, \"come on Jakenlets just finish this\" Jake was so shocked to see Melanie thatnhe dropped the car part he was holding but he quickly regained hisncomposure. He walked down the stairs and started walking towardsnMelanie. \"So this is it after eight years,nwhat not even a 'Hi honey, lookin good, hows the family. Remember menyour wife.'\" said Jake \"You honestly expect me to tellnyou, you look good, what did they run out of soap at the tyre factorynsince I left?\" replied Melanie Jake just looked at her thinking aboutnhow much she had changed, she wasn't the Mel he knew but he stillnwouldn't be able to sign the divorce papers, he loved her too muchnand he had worked too hard to throw it all away now. \"Did you bring Ellie with you?\"nasked Jake Before Melanie could say anything Elliencame out of the car, unaware of what Jake had just asked. \"Mum, I'm going to go and visitnGrandma and Grandpa\" said Ellie to Melanie without even lookingnat Jake. \"Gabby are you coming?\" \"No\" came a little voice fromninside the car \"You had another kid?\" askednJake \"With who?\" \"Are you sure you remember thenway?\" asked Melanie ignoring Jake \"Yeah I remember, I doubt thisnplace has changed much.\" said Ellie \"Ellie, stay, come in, we canntalk\" said Jake as he went over to hug her but before he couldneven touch her, she said, \"Don't touch me\" she thennstarted to walk away \"Why don't you go and hug your otherndaughter, the one that actually cares, the one that is sitting innthat car waiting paitently to meet her daddy\" after she had saidnthat Ellie disappeared. Jake stood there trying to take in whatnEllie had just said, he had two daughters, and for some reason Ellienhated him.[Chapter 5] How could you not tell me? Jake went over to Melanie's car andnopened the door, \"Hey\" he said to Gabby \"Hello you're my daddy, look samenas the picture.\" said Gabby excitedly as she showed him thenpicture she had of him. Jake looked at the picture andnremembered the day it was taken, it had been a few weeks before Melnand Ellie had left. It was Ellie's 7th birthday and she had gottennher very own camera and she had wanted to take a picture of him tonput next to her bed, so he could protect her as she slept. \"Yeah I'm your daddy\" saidnJake as he lifted Gabby out of the car. \"Now why don't you goninto that house and in the fridge you'll find a can ok coca cola andna candy bar\" he said kindly. \"Mummy can I?\" asked Gabbyneagerly \"Of course you can, I'll be in, inna minute.\" said Melanie Once Gabby had gone into the house,nJake turned to Melanie and said, \"Well I reckon you've got somenexplaining to do Mel.\" \"Yeah I'm sorry, I probably shouldnhave called and warned you\" \"No, what you should have done wasncall me 8 years ago and tell me I was gonna be a daddy again\" \"Are you kidding me? Jake younwere always drunk or working on that stupid truck, you never spentnany time with Ellie. You would have made me come back.\" \"You're damn right I would havenand I loved Ellie and I would have done anything for her and I stillnwould but you seem to have turned her against me.\" \"Hey I didn't I never saidnanything but nice things about you in front of her.\" \"Whatever, then why does she hatenme? Why wouldn't she take my calls? I haven't spoke to my daughternin 6 years, and I haven't seen her in 8 years. Do you have any ideanwhat that feels like? And now I just find out I have an 8 year oldndaughter as well. Anything else you wanna tell me?\" shoutednJake Melanie knew better than to tell Jakenabout Andrew and the engagment when he was like this. \"No of course not, now calm downnand sign these papers.\" \"What you really expect me to signnthose papers? What about custody of the girls?\" \"What about it?\" \"Who gets custody?\" Melanie laughed at this and then said, \"I get custody, I raised themnboth\" \"What if I want joint custody,nthey're my daughters too\" \"You wouldn't get custody in anmillion years. Ellie hates you and you've only said a few words tonGabby in her whole life.\" \"Gabby is that her name? When wasnshe born?\" \"Gabbrielle Earl Perry, she wasnborn on August 9th.\" \"Fine we'll talk later, I'm goingnto spend some time with my daughter\" said Jake before he wentninto his house.[Chapter 6] The Bar Gabby and Jake spent all day together, Jake couldn't believe how much he loved her, she looked so much like Mel, she was such a sweet kid. He had tried to contact Ellie but she wouldn't talk to him. Jake had a date that night with Suzi Brandon, he had been casually seeing her for a few months. He had started dating again about 6 months after Ellie had cut him out of her life, out of loneliness. He still loved Mel and he had worked so hard to make something of himself, but Mel had made up her mind that he was still the loser she had left behind, he wanted her and his daughters to be happy so he knew he had to let them go. Jake was sitting at the bar talking to Suzi, he had already told his mother Stella about Gabby and how Mel and Ellie were in town as well. He and Suzi got up and went to stand next to the pool table. Melanie walked into the bar thinking that it hadn't changed a bit since she had left. She spoke to her old friend Lyrlin. She started to walk towards Jake, but she didn't even make it past the bar when she heard Stella shout, \"Well, hells bells looks like trouble just walked right back into my life in the form of my favourite daughter in law\" \"Soon to be ex daughter in law\" replied Mel as she showed Stella her engagement ring. \"Wow, look at that rock. Who's the lucky guy?\" \"His name is Andrew\" \"Well hows my granddaughters? Jake told me about Gabby and I'm disappointed in you Mel, but I understand\" said Stella \"Yeah Stella I'm sorry about that. Ellies being difficult you know refusing to see or talk to Jake and Gabby she's just excited.\" \"Yeah I saw Ellie earlier, she was catchin up with Scott and Craig and the rest of that lot. Oh I gotta go, we'll catch up later\" said Stella, \"Brenda you get this lady any drink she want on the house.\" \"I have a martini dirty with 2 olives thanks\" said Melanie When she got her drink she walked over to Jake who had his back to her. \"Hey mind if I join you?\" \"As a matter of fact, we do\" said Jake as he moved to make sure Mel could see Suzi. \"Hi you must be Jake's hot date.\" said Melanie \"The name's Suzi\" said Suzi \"Hi I'm Jake's Yankee bitch wife, whom he refuses to divorce even though I'm engaged to another man\" You've all seen the film you know how the rest of it goes. Mel was starting to get slightly drunk while playing pool, when Ellie walked in the bar and came up and joined them at the pool tables with a bottle of beer in her hand. \"Hey, hey you're underage\" shouted Jake when he saw the beer bottle in Ellie's hand Ellie just looked at him with disgust. \"Hey leave her alone, if she wants a beer she can have a beer\" Melanie shouted back \"Where's the Jukebox in here\" asked Ellie \"It's over there\" said Bobby Ray pointing to the Jukebox \"Thanks Bobby Ray\" said Ellie smiling at him Jake sat thinking, Ellie would smile at Bobby Ray who had only told her where the Jukebox was, but she wouldn't even acknowledge him when he had helped give her life and had raised her for 7 years. It hurt Jake because he loved her so much. Ellie walked over to the Jukebox and made her selection, when she cama back she said \"This is my favourite song. It's just so familar to me\" Just then the song started. \" I don't know to much about, too much of my old man, I know he walked right out the door and we never saw him again Last I heard he was at the bar doin himself in, I know I got that same disease I guess I got that from him\" Jake looked over at Ellie at this point and she raised her beer bottle at him. Jake knew she had picked that song to tell him what she thought of him. Melanie looked over at Jake and saw the hurt in his eyes, she doubted anyone else could see it, but she could she knew him better than anyone. As much as Jake was infuriating her just now he didn't deserve what Ellie had just done, but Melanie felt powerless to stop it. \"This is the story of my old man, Just like his father before him.\" Stella looked over at Jake and felt so bad for him. When Ellie was born Jake had vowed to never leave her and do to her what his father had done to him and now Ellie had used that to hurt him. \"I remember baseball games and working on the car\" Jake remembered what Mel had said about him always working on his truck and it was true that he had spent a lot of time playing sports when he should have been at home with his wife and daughter. \"Someday he'll wish that he made things right, Long for his family and miss his wife Remember the days he had everything Now he's alone and miserable again.\" Jake could barely contain the hurt he was feeling Ellie must really hate him if thats what she really thought about him. \"Right Ellie you've made your point, now go home\" said Melanie \"Don't worry I'm going\" snapped Ellie \"Hold on, I'll walk you home\" shouted Bobby Ray. what did you think of that chapter i wasnt 2 sure about it plz review[Chapter 7] Walking Home \"Hey wait up\" shouted BobbynRay as he ran to catch up with Ellie Ellie remembered Bobby Ray, he was herngodfather and a best friend of her parents. \"So did that feel as good as younthought it would?\" asked Bobby Ray. \"Yeah it felt great to let himnknow what I really think of him\" said Ellie \"Yeah see I don't think thats hownyou really feel\" said Bobby Ray \"And what do you know? Younhaven't seen me in 8 years I've changed\" \"I don't doubt that, you werenalways a sweet good natured little girl but you had Jake's temper andnyou could lash out and hurt people, but you also had a conscience andnyou used to cry when you calmed down and realised you had hurtnsomeone. Do you remember what you did to Cassandra Blake?\" \"Yeah she scribbled over thenpicture I had spent hours drawing\" said Ellie \"Yeah and then you threw her intonthe lake\" laughed Bobby Ray \"Yeah then I cried and made you gonin and get her out\" said Ellie laughing now as well \"Yep and I got totally soaked innthat cold dirty lake\" said Bobby Ray \" So you see you donhave a conscience and I don't think you're proud of what you justndid. You hurt your dad real bad\" Bobby Ray wasn't surprised when henturned round to face Ellie and he saw a tear fall down her cheek. \"Come on let's go down to thatnlake and we can talk\" suggested Bobby Ray \"Okay\" said Ellie quietly They both walked down to the lake innsilence, when they got there Bobby Ray asked Ellie \"So are you gonna tell me why youndid it?\" \"I wanted to hurt him the way henhurt me\" said Ellie the tears now streaming down her face \"How did he hurt you? It seems tonme, you were the one to hurt him, by refusing to take his calls andncutting him out of your life and pretending he doesn't exist\"nsaid Bobby Ray \"I had to do that. He only callednme once a week. I cried myself to sleep 6 nights a week. The onlynnight I didn't was the night before he called because I knew I wouldnget to talk to him the next day. At first I hated my mother forntaking me away from him but then I realised she had done it for mynown good. My father didn't even try to get me and my mum back, hendidn't try and visit me I doubt he even noticed we left. I thoughtnthe only way was to cut him out and never see or hear from himnagain.\" Ellie was sobbing now, Bobby Ray sat down next tonher,and put his arm round her. \"It's okay, let it all out, younknow you can trust me not to say anything.\" he said softly \"I know, but now Jake's gonna hatnme, Gabby loves him, why couldn't I just have shown how happy I wasnto see him again.\" \"Shhh stop crying, come on girl. nI've got something to tell you. Come on dry thoses eyes\" Ellie started to pull her selfntogether, she wiped her eyes. \"That better now, your dad doesn'tnhate you, he carries a picture of you around in his wallet.\"nsaid Bobby Ray \"He probably got rid of that anlong time ago\" sniffed Ellie \"No I swear I saw it just lastnweek. You looked about five and Jake was carrying you and you werenhugging him, you were wearing that fairy princess costume you alwaysnwore\" \"Yeah I remember that, it's sonembarassing to think about now. Thank god my mum didn't take any ofnthose pictures with us to New York\" \"She would have had troublengetting them of your dad, they were all he had left of you. I wentnround to see him about a week after you told him you never wanted tonsee or talk to him again, he was lying on the couch in the samenclothes he had been wearing that day. He was filthy he hadn't movednfrom the sofa, he was looking at your pictures and the old homenmovies, he was such a mess.\" \"Oh my god, I had no idea, hennever seemed to care that much\" \"He doesn't like to show hisnfeelings much, but he was devastated he adored you, he still does,nyou were always a daddy's girl\" \"Thank you Bobby Ray\" saidnEllie as she gave him a hug Bobby Ray walked Ellie back tonMelanie's parents house and then he went back to the bar. You've all seen the film so you knownwhat happens at the bar.[Chapter 8] Leaving Again Okay I'm skipping ahead a bit, thisnis the morning after Jake and Melanie kiss in the Graveyard. \"Yeah, okay I'll bring the girlsnup to say goodbye\" said Melanie, she was on the phone to Jake,ntrying not to think about what happened last night. When she hung up she shouted to Gabbynand Ellie, \" Are you two ready yet come on Gabby I'll take younto say goodbye to Jake. Ellie I assume you don't wanna come\" \"No I don't\" she replied \"Okay I'll pick you up on the waynback, be ready\" \"Okay\" Melanie took Gabby to see Jake. \"Oh you guys are leaving rightnaway.\" asked Jake as he noticed the bags in the car \"Yeah but Ellie's not packed yetnso we've got half an hour\" said Melanie desperately hoping Jakenwould stop them from leaving again, but at the same time wanting himnto let her go. She really didn't know what she was feeling or whatnshe wanted, seeing Jake again had confused her especially seeing Jakenwith their daughters. \"Alright, half an hour, we betternmake the most of it then Gabby\" said Jake with a twinkle in hisneye About 10 minutes later Jake spottednEllie walking towards his house, he hoped she had come to forgive himnand say goodbye properly. Well if he was going to hope for somethingnit would be that Mel felt the same about him as he did about her andncame back and then they could all be a family again. \"Ellie did you come to play withnme and daddy?\" asked Gabby hopefully \"No sorry Gabs\" said Ellie \"nI came to talk to them\" she said pointing to Mel and Jake \"Uh okay, Gabby if you go into thenhouse on the coffee table you'll find two wrapped presents, the pinknone is yours\" said Jake just before Gabby happily skipped towardnthe house to get her gift. By this time Mel had joined Ellie andnJake on the grass. \"What is it Ellie? Where are yournbags? I hope you're here to apologise\" said Melanie sharply \"Uh no I'm not. I don't want tongo back to New York and Granma said I could stay with her and Granpanand enrol at the school. Come on Mum please\" pleaded Ellie \"Wh-what no. Why would you wannanstay here?\" \"I'm happier here, I've got my oldnfriends who are better friend than my one's in New York, this is justnbetter than the city. I'm happier here\" \"Oh my god. You're serious. Whatnabout me and Gabby we'd miss you so much\" \"I know I'll miss you guys too. nBut I know you'll never agree to stay. We'll talk every day I'll getna webcam. Please mum I really want to do this\" \"Uh okay fine, but just for anwhile and if I hear you've done anything you're not supposed to,nyou'll be on the first flight back to New York, understand\" nsaid Melanie seriously \"Oh I'll be good I promise, thanknyou\" said Ellie excitedly as she jumped up and down and gave hernmother a hug. \" I'm gonna go and talk to Gabby I don't want hernthinking I'm abandoning her\" Ellie said before she rannexcitedly towards Ellie who was sitting on the porch unwrapping hernpresent. \"Look after her for me Jake. nDon't let anything happen to her okay\" said Melanie \"Don't worry Mel she'll be fine\"n he replies \"I can't help it I'm her mothernit's my job\" \"Well I'm her father I'd dienbefore I let anything bad happen to her\" \"I know you would but it doesn'tnmake leaving her any easier\" \"I know but she'll be back fornyour wedding\" \"I hope so, but I dunno she'snpretty stubborn and she despises Andrew, her word not mine.\" Jake was thrilled to hear that Ellienhated Andrew but he tried to hide it \"awww I'm sure she'll come round\" \"Jake you were always a terriblenliar and now that you're older, you're worse\" said Melanienbefore she added, \" be paitent with her, she's still a daddy'sngirl at heart.\" \"I hope so\" replied Jake asnhe hugged Mel and then he realized he didn't want to ever let her go,nbut she had made her decision, they were divorced and she wasnmarrying another man. Ellie and Jake said goodbye to andnwaved off Mel and Gabby, both felt tears in their eyes but theynmanaged to control themselves. \"Hey Jake, sorry uh dad can wentalk for a minute\" asked Ellie nervously.[Chapter 9] Jake and Ellie Ellie followed Jake into the house \"I'm glad you decided to stay\"nsaid Jake to Ellie \"Thanks\" she replied \" Inuh just wanted to apologise for what I did that night in the bar, Inshouldn't have done it\" \"Thank you I know that wasn't easynfor you to admit.\" replied Jake \"Can I ask you why you hatenme so much?\" \"I don't I just felt I uh oh Incan't explain, I'm sorry I shouldn't have said anything. I toldnBobby Ray I couldn't but he insisted\" rambled Ellie before shenran out of the house. \"Ellie come back. Ellie\"nshouted Jake, he knew it was pointless to run after her. She hadnsaid something about Bobby Ray, he had walked her home last night butnit had taken him longer than it should, perhaps she had told himnsomething. Jake grabbed his jacket and ran out the door to findnBobby Ray. He found him in the Diner, Jake went upnto his booth and sat opposite him \"Hey Jake\" said Bobby Ray \"Hey, so I was just said goodbyento Mel and Gabby\" \"What about Ellie?\" \"She decided to stay here. Shenapologised to me\" \"Did she?\" said Bobby Raynwith a knowing smile on his face \"Yeah, but you already knew thatnshe would. You see I asked her why she hated me so much and she justnstarted to ramble so I couldn't really hear what she was saying, butnwhat I did hear loud and clear was your name. So you wanna explainnthat to me?\" \"Uh Jake I promised her I wouldn'tnsay anything, especially to you\" said Bobby Ray uncomfortably. \"Bobby Ray, we have been friendsnour whole lives, you were best man at my wedding, I made you Ellie'sngodfather. If there is something going on with her you damn wellnbetter tell me, she's my daughter.\" said Jake angrily \"Jake I can't, but that kid isnhurting real bad she needs you, now more than ever. Just talk to hernokay\" said Bobby Ray as he got up and left. Jake got up and drove as fast as hendared to Mel's parent's house. He knocked on the door and Mel's dadnanswered, Jake was relieved because Mel's mother had never reallynliked him, she blamed him for Mel getting pregnant and then having tonget married when she was 17. \"Mornin Earl\" \"Mornin Jake, I'm just on my waynout\" \"Okay is she here?\" \"In Mel's old room, I'm sure younremember where that is\" \"Thanks\" said Jake before henmade his way to Mel's old room He walked in and it looked exactly thensame as it had the last time he was in her room, when Mel found outnshe was pregnant with Ellie, except this time it was Ellie sobbing onnthe bed, not Mel. \"Granpa, I'm fine I told you it'snjust the time of the month.\" \"Oh I'm sure that didn't make himntoo uncomfortable\" said Jake light heartedly \"That was the general idea\"nsaid Ellie as she sat up and faced Jake \"I spoke to Bobby Ray\" saidnJake \"What did he say?\" askednEllie cautiously \"He said that I was to come andntalk to you and not leave until I got some answers\" said Jakensitting down on the chair next to the bed and taking off his jacket \"nand I've got all the time in the world to wait.\" Ellie just looked down at the groundnand dried her eyes before saying quietly, \"I'll give you answers if you givenme answers\" \"Fine, me first though. Why didnyou tell me never to contact you again?\" \"I had to, I couldn't go on thenway things were, I cried myself to sleep almost every single nightnbecause I missed you so much\" Jake's heart nearly broke when he heardnthis he was so busy thinking about how much he had missed Ellie henhadn't even thought about how she was feeling, and if she missed him. \"I had to cut you out\"ncontinued Ellie, \"for my sake, for Gabby's sake and for mum's Inknew that you still being her our lives was hurting her even thoughnshe would never admit it\" \"Alright. Why did you refuse tontalk to me when you came back? Why do you hate me so much?\" \"I don't hate you I just toldnmyself I did and that I was better off without you. But deep down Inknew that it would hurt too much if I thought about you. I couldn'tnlet you back in when we came back because I knew he had leave again\"nsaid Ellie tears now streaming down her face. \"Hey, it's okay. You have no ideanhow much I missed you too.\" said Jake kindly as he got up andnsat next to Ellie putting his arm round her. \"I'm so sorry\" Ellie sobbed \"Hey it's all forgotten\" \"Really?\" she asked \"Of course, you can't reallynexpect me to stay mad at my little princess.\" Ellie laughed at this and hugged Jakenback.[Chapter 10] Ellie Questions Jake Ellie had gone and washed her face andnreapplied her make up, when she had done this Jake decided to buy hernlunch at the diner. After they had ordered Ellie turned and lookednJake straight in the eye and said, \"Well I answered your questions,nnow it's your turn to answer mine\" \"Okay shoot\" said Jake \"Why did my mum leave you?\" \"Oh I thought you were going tonask that question. Well I was still a kid, I spent all my free time,nplaying football or working on the truck. I also went to the barnalmost every night. Your mum was still a kid as well but instead ofnhaving fun she was stuck at home all day with you, even when younstarted school, she got a part time job and she had to cook and cleannas well. I wasn't fair to her and I was to young and stupid tonrealise it, and by the time I did it was too late.\" \"Why didn't you try to get hernback?\" said Ellie trying her best to sound like an interigator. \"I did, a few months after younboth left I went to New York, but when I saw the sort of life youncould have there I knew it would take more than an apology to younboth back\" \"What did you do when you gotnback?\" \"I decided to make something ofnmyself, I started a business one thats quite successful now. I grewnup, I gave up football, and bought a truck that actually worked andnstopped drinking every night.\" \"Why didn't you try and get usnback then?\" \"It took a long time to get wherenI wanted to be and too much time had passed, I figured you had bothnmoved on and forgotten I even existed.\" \"When and why did you startndating, if you ever stopped\" \"Hey I never cheated on yournmother, and I never would. I started to date about two and a halfnyears after you and your mother left. I hadn't spoke to you innmonths and I was lonely.\" \"Do you love that woman you werenwith at the bar?\" \"No\" \"Do you still love my mum?\" \"Uh Ellie I think thats enough fornnow\" said Jake uncomfortably \"You said you'd answer mynquestions, anyway I think I already know the answer but I need tonhear from you?\" \"Fine okay I love her, I nevernstopped. I've always loved her and I always will\" \"Thats what I thougth\" smilednEllie \"I don't want you to get anynchildish fantasies about me and you mum getting back together. She'snmade her decision she's marrying that other guy\" said Jakenmiserably \"So, she loves you, I know shendoes. I used to catch her looking at your picture late at night atnthe time. I saw the way she was looking at you before she left. Shenloves you, I don't think she ever stopped.\" \"Stop it. She's marrying someonenelse. Anyway I have one more question for you. What do you think ofnher ... fiance?\" Ellie could see how much it pained Jakento describe someone else as Mel's fiance. \"I don't like him and to be honestnhe never really liked me that much either. He liked playing happynfamilies with Gabby but I was the baby mum had when she was 17 shock horror. Think of the scandal I could cause.\" Jake could hardly bear to hear thatnanother man had played tried to replace him with Gabby. Elliennoticed the hurt in Jake's eyes when she said that Andrew that playednhappy famillies with Gabby and she wished she hadn't said anythingnshe should have known that that would hurt him and she thought shenhad done enough of that in the past week. Jake and Ellie spent the rest of thenday together and it soon felt as thougt they had never been apart.[Chapter 11] Mel and Jake Melanie was at home alone, Gabby was at school, even though Ellie called her at least once a day Mel still felt empty as if part of her was missing which in a way it was. Mel knew that Ellie was just like her, she loved Alabama it was her home more than New York had ever been Gabby was the same but she was too young to be away from her mum. Melanie was sitting listening to one of Ellie's CD's that she had left. \"Out of sight, out of mind That's what they all say, But I learned that aint the truth with you and me babe\" Melanie thought about Jake even 8 years after she had left him she still thought of him every single day. \"Time can't change a good thing, Lovin you is something I still feel You'll always be my baby \" Mel remembered the night she saw Jake with that woman Suzi, she had felt not jealous but that Jake was hers and how dare this other woman touch him and kiss him. \"Remember we were lovin' every single night, You gave me all the love I need to survive And each and every day I'd only dream of you And every single thing we would do\" Mel remembered how she had felt about Jake when they were in high school, he was her best friend and her boyfriend she had thought he was perfect and that he would be everything she would ever want and need. Mel smiled as she thought of them both back then. \"These days I find myself remembering what we had\" Mel laughed out loud at this, that was exactly what she was doing now. \"The love we had, the love we made\" Mel thought of her and Jake's two beautiful daughters.The sex she had with Jake was also amazing.She was confused did she still love Jake? Or was she just sad that their 15 year marriage had ended, well legallly anyway, their marriage had ended 8 years ago. Mel listened to the end of the song and then she heard the phone ring and she put all thoughts of Jake out of her mind, telling herself that she loved Andrew and that Jake was only Gabby and Ellie's dad that was all. Mel and Jake didn't know how similar they were, at the same time as Mel was thinking about him, Jake was doing exactly the same. Ellie was going to stay with him for a week to see how they got along before moving in permanently. She was in her room unpacking, she had her music up so loud that Jake could hear all the words clearly. \"There's a thousand words that I could say to make you come home\" 'I wish' though Jake. He wished he could say something that would make Mel come back to him. \"It seems so long ago you walked away and left me alone. And I remember what you said to me you were acting so strange. And maybe I was to blind to see that you needed a change\" Jake remembered the day Mel had left him, when he got home from work he had shouted to her that he was going ot the bar as usual. That was when she told him that she and Ellie were leaving him, their bag were already in the cab and he had one minute to say goodbye to Ellie. He was such a fool not to realise how far he had pushed Mel, he should have treated her the way she deserved to be treated, like a queen. \"I've been sitting her Can't get you off my mind I'm tryin my best to be a man and be strong\" That was true as well, Jake thought of Mel every single day. But he put on an act as if he didn't care, but he had been slowly falling apart since he heard that Mel was going to marry another man. Why did he sign those divorce papers? he asked himself for the millionth time. So she could be happy he answered himself. \"And I know in heart you cant say that you don't love me too\" In the graveyard that night Jake could have sworn he say love in Mel's eyes. Oh well he could hope. the songs were always be my baby by atomic kitten and Gone Nsync[Chapter 12] What! Ellie was still thinking about whatnJake had said about him still loving her mum. Ellie thought hernmother still loved him. She had to talk to someone about it, Ellienknew her mother inside out but she was still getting to know Jake sonshe wanted to talk to someone who knew Jake as well as her mum did. nShe was on her way to talk to Stella. She arrived at Stella's, she knockednon the door and went in. \"Hello, Grandma, its Ellie\" nshe shouted before she saw Stella emerge from the kitchen \"Hey, you know I still can't getnused to being called Grandma, I'm not even 50 and I have a 15 yearnold granddaughter. I'll never forgive Jake for making me a Grandmanat 35\" said Stella Ellie just laughed and then said \"nSorry, Stella\" \"That's much better, now what cannI do for you?\" \"What can't I just come andnvisit?\" \"You can. Are you just here tonvisit me?\" \"No I wanted to talk about my mumnand dad.\" \"Oh right what you wanna talknabout? What do you wanna know?\" \"I dunno I just wanted to talk tonsomeone about them. It's so frustrating I know they both love eachnother but they won't admit it\" \"I know they've always hadnsomething special between even when they were kids. It was you, younknow that kept them from ending it all over something stupid.\"nsaid Stella \"What do you mean\" askednEllie \"Well, in high school they werenalways breaking up over a silly argument but they couldn't be withoutneach other, but when you came along they realized they had to grow upnand be a family for your sake, to make a stable environment for you\" \"So do you think they still loveneach other?\" \"Oh I know they do, now more thannever because they have been apart for so long\" Ellie was thrilled to hear this. \"But what about that woman dad'snseeing\" \"Suzi, that tramp\" Ellie couldn't help but laugh atnhearing Stella describe her like that. \"What she is a tramp and shendoesn't mean anything to your daddy. He's lonely well not so muchnnow but he was so he started to date women where there was no future.n I reckon he was waiting for your mum and he still is. I think he'llnwait forever\" said Stella \"I hope he doesn't have to waitnthat long\" said Ellie quietly. Ellie stayed and talked to Stella untilnshe had to go and meet her friends, it was 10:30pm before she arrivednback at Jake's \"Hey, why were you out so late,nyou know you start school tomorrow\" said Jake as she walked in \"I know I'm sorry\" \"Your mother called she said younwere to call her back as soon as you came home\" \"Why I talked to her this morningnand Gabby will be asleep by now. What does she want?\" askednEllie \"Dunno I didn't ask\" \"Okay I'll go call her now\"nsaid Ellie as she made her way to the phone in Jake's room where shenalways spoke to Melanie. Jake was sitting watching tv as Ellienspoke to Melanie, suddenly he heard Ellie yell but he couldn't makenout what she yelling. Ellie spoke to her mother for another fewnminutes and then she came out of Jake's room looking incredibly pale. \"What is it?\" asked Jakenconcerned \" Are your mum and Gabby alright?\" \"Yeah they're fine, it's just Mumnand Andrew have set the date for the wedding they're getting marriednin two weeks at the Carmicheal plantation, she said she wants to getnmarried in her home town.\" babbled Ellie before muttering \"I'mngoing for a shower\" Jake felt as if his heart had beennripped out. Two weeks. At least if they were getting married in NewnYork Jake could pretend it wasn't happening. \"Hey Ellie I'm going out, keep allnthe doors locked Okay\" Jake shouted up the stairs to Ellie \"Okay\" Ellie shouted back.[Chapter 13] What have I done? Ellie got up an hour before her alarmnwas supposed to go off. She hadn't slept well, she couldn't believenit her mum was getting married in two weeks. Ellie had to stop her,nshe just didn't know how. She was also worried about her dad, shenwas tip toeing around so that she didn't wake him, after she had toldnhim about the wedding he had gone out, so he was probably hungovernnow. Ellie was in the kitchen preparing hernbreakfast when she heard someone coming out of her dad's room. Shenhad her back to them so she just assumed it was Jake. \"Mornin dad, I thought you'd benhungover this morin\" said Ellie \"Oh honey I'm not your dad, butnyou're right he will be hungover this morning, he was wasted lastnnight.\" a female voice answered. \"Suzi! What are you doin here?\" \"Well I would have thought thatnwas obvious. Jake brought me, I think he's finally getting seriousnabout me...\" Ellie couldn't believe it, was Suzinreally so stupid as to think that Ellie wanted to hear about her andnher dad. Just the idea of them doing that repulsed her. Jake opened his and eyes andnimmediately felt the throbbing pain in his head. 'Oh god what happened last night' henthought. He hadn't had a hangover like this in years. Then henstarted to remember last night, Mel's wedding, the bar and Suzi. \"Shit\" he whispered he putnhis hand over to the other side of the bed to wake Suzi and hopefullynsmuggle her out before Ellie woke up. But his hand just fell to thenbedsheets. Where was she? Had she left already? Then Jake heardnvoices in the living room. \"Fuck. No\" he said as hengrabbed a pair of boxers and put them on before running into thenliving room, just in time to see Suzi forcing a disgusted lookingnEllie into a hug. Just then Suzi noticed that Jake had entered thenroom. \"Oh Jakey, you're up I was goingnto make you breakfast in bed. I thought all 3 of us could spend thenday together\" said Suzi, unusually cheery for 8am Jake andnEllie thought. \"I'm going to school\" statednEllie as she shot Jake the worst look he had ever seen. Ellie walked out the house managed tonstop herself from crying. Jake watched her leave and then turnednto Suzi and thought about how he was going to get rid of her withoutnhurting her. Eventually he told her that he had to go to work andnthat he would call her later, not very original but it worked. After Suzi left Jake went out to thenporch to clear his head. He jumped in surprise when he saw Elliensitting there. \"Shouldn't you be at school\"nhe asked her \"I've got plenty of time. Do younwanna explain yourself to me?\" \"Wait a minute I'm the father,nyou're the daughter I don't have to explain myself to you\" saidnJake grumpliy \"What are you doin with thatnWhore? What about Mum?\" \"You watch your mouth , you're notntoo old for a spankin you know. And in case you hadn't noticed yournmum is getting married\" \"Is that why you did it?\" \"No I did it because I wanted to,nnot that it's any of your concern\" shouted Jake Ellie then burst into tears and rannaway. 'What have I done' thought Jake.[Chapter 14] Mel's back! Ellie ran still sobbing, she was on hernway to see Bobby Ray, he was probably at the Carmichael plantation. nEllie was running so fast she knocked someone down. As she turnednround to help them up she was shocked to see who it was. \"Mum\" she gasped \"Ellie\" said Melanie happilynand then she saw the state Ellie was in, \"What's wrong?\"nshe asked worriedly \"Uh nothing. Why are back? Whyndidn't you tell me you were coming?\" \"I came to plan the wedding and Injust decided to come after I finished talking to you last night. nThere is obviously something home.\" \"It's not important. Where'snGabby?\" \"At Stella's. Tell me what gotnyou into this state.\" Five minutes later Ellie and Melanienwere sitting in the Diner. \"So are you gonna tell me what'snwrong or am I gonna have to drag it out of you?\" said Melanienwith a strong southern accent. \"It's nothing I'm just beingnsilly\" sniffed Ellie \"It's obviouslt something\"nsaid Melanie kindly \"Do you remember that slut Jakenwas with at the bar?\" \"Yeah that brassy fake redheadedntart\" \"Yeah her, well I woke up thisnmorning and started making breakfast when she came out of dad's roomnwearing only his shirt.\" Melanie felt as if her heart had beennripped out and stamped on, Jake was sleeping with someone else. nMelanie was devastated. \"Then when I tried to speak to himnabout it he yelled and me and threatened to hit me.\" \"He what! I thought that havingnyou living with him he would become more responsible. But tonthreaten you well I'll be talking him don't you worry about that. nYou're staying with Granma and Granpa tonight no arguing. Come onnI'll drop you off at school.\" After Melanie dropped Ellie off atnschool. She went to see Jake. Even though she didn't realise it shenwas more upset that Jake had slept with someone, than she was aboutnhim threatening Ellie. Melanie let herself in and she foundnJake lying on the couch watching tv, he hadn't even noticed that shenhad come in. Mel went and stood right in front of the tv. \"Hey whats the big idea, get outnthe..\" Jake stopped when he realized who it was, \"Mel, whatnare you doing here?\" \"Well I came to surprise Ellie andnshe knocked me over when she was sobbing on her way to Bobby Ray's. nDo you wanna explain why my daughter was in such a state when I sawnher.\" \"Our daughter Mel and she justnoverreacted about something.\" \"Oh don't worry she already toldnme that Suzi the red headed skank spent the night\" \"See that where Ellie picked upnall that filthy language.\" \"Whatever Jake. I don't want younthreatening my daughter with violence I didn't bring her up that way\" \"Thats obvious. She was actingnlike a spoiled brat,\" \"Well you don't have to worrynabout putting up with her I'm taking her and Gabby back to New Yorknafter the wedding\" said Melanie before stomping out.[Chapter 15] Jake meets Andrew Jake hadn't seen Ellie or Gabby in anweek, Mel said that any boy could be a father but it take a man to bena daddy and that he wasn't responsible enough to be a daddy. Jakenwas miserable, the only woman he had ever loved and ever will wasngoing to marry someone else and then she was taking his daughternhundreds of miles away. Jake had decided to take Brian for a walk innthe park, he had walked about halfway through when he spotted them. nEllie, Gabby, Melanie and some guy who must be Andrew Melanie'snfiance, were having a picnic. Melanie, Andrew and Gabby were allneating and laughing. Jake smiled when he saw Ellie, who wasnpretending to read a magazine but she was really putting bugs onnAndrew's plate when nobody was looking. Just then Ellie looked upnand her face lit up when she spotted Jake, and he knew she wasn'tnstill mad at him. Jake indicated for Ellie to meet him at the icencream stall that was just out of Melanie and Andrew's view. \"I'm gonna go get some ice cream\"nsaid Ellie \"Can I come I want some?\"nsaid Gabby \"Sure come on\" replied Ellie Ellie and Gabby walked away hand innhand and when Gabby saw Jake she squealed, \"Daddy\" and then she ran intonhis arms \"Hey munchkin\" said Jake \"Inmissed you so much\" he whispered \"I missed you too daddy\" saidnGabby Jake couldnt help but smile everytimenthis beautiful little girl called him daddy. \"What don't I get a hug from yountoo?\" Jake asked Ellie Just as he said that Ellie's facenerrupted into a smile \"Of course you do\" said Ellienas she threw herself into Jake's arms \"Hey am I not getting ice cream\"nasked Ellie Jake laughed and then went and got allnthree of them ice cream \"Gabby you better go back, tellnmum I'm talking to Craig. Don't mention dad okay. Promise\"nsaid Ellie \"I promise\" said Gabbynfiercely before she went back to join Melanie and Andrew. \"I'm sorry I shouldn't have spokento you like you like that. I shouldn't have swore. I'm sorry I toldnmum\" Ellie blurted out \"Hey it's okay it was my fault. nI'm sorry I brought Suzi home. I broke up with her by the way.\" \"Really\" \"Yeah of course I couldnt go outnwith someone my little princess hated so much\" \"Oh I thought you meant...\"nsaid Ellie disappointed \"Look Ellie I know you want me andnyour mum to get back together but thats never gonna happen. She'sngetting married and we're divorced\" \"I know but you love her and shenloves you\" \"We were childhood sweathearts, wenhave children together, we'll always love each other in a certain waynbut not in the way you want us to\" lied Jake. Ellie knew he was lying, but beforenEllie could respond Brian broke away from Jake's grip, he rannstraight towards Melanie and Gabby who he had obviously recognized. nJake and Ellie ran after him but it was too late he had already madenit over to Melanie. \"Brian\" shouted Melanie asnshe jumped up \"Brian\" shouted Gabby happilynas she started to stroke him. \"I'm sorry he got away\" saidnJake as he ran up to them. \"Well you should keep that beastnunder control. What if it had hurt my fiancee or the children\"nsaid Andrew Jake just looked at him and then henturned to Mel and said \"I guess it was the food thatnattracted him, or maybe he recognized you or our daughter\" \"Wait a minute you're...\"nsaid Andrew before he was interupted by Ellie \"Our daddy yeah he is\" \"Jake what are you doing? Did youndo this on purpose? Ellie come here.\" shouted Melanie \"No I'm staying here\" saidnEllie \"What\" said Melanie who wasnstarting to get mad \"Hey this isn't her fault, and nonI didn't do this on purpose but I'm glad it happened. You wouldn'tnlet me see my daughters\" \"Well you can hardly blame hernafter your recent and past behaviour\" said Andrew \"What the hell has this got to donwith you?\" yelled Jake \"Hey don't you dare talk to himnlike that\" yelled Melanie \"Shut up. Do you really thinknthat Gabby wants to hear her parent arguing like this. And mum dadnis right Andrew is nothing to do with me or Gabby.\" said Ellie \"I'm marrying your mother\"nargued Andrew \"Yeah my mother not me or Gabby. nNow mum, dad you two need to talk and work something out because wenneed both of you.\" Jake and Melanie both agreed she wasnright so they decided to meet and talk about it. Andrew wasn't happynabout it, he felt jealous because Jake knew Mel so well, they hadnhistory together and two daughters. Jake was also better lookingnthan Andrew was.[Chapter 16] Before the wedding It was the day of Melanie and Andrew'snwedding, Ellie woke up and then went to see Jake. \"Hey dad\" \"Hey Ellie\" said Jake as henpacked things into the back of his truck. \"There's a wedding going on\"nsaid Ellie \"I heard that mentioned a time orntwo\" replied Jake \"I sure hope this weather conoperates\" Ellie said who had now got her southern accent backncompletely. \"It's supposed to be a big one\" \"You're my dad and I love you butnsometimes you are too damn stubborn and proud\" \"She made her decision Ellie\"nsaid Jake miserably \"You know for someone who's beennholding onto something so hard you sure are quick to let it go\"nsaid Ellie \"You know I can't control hernanymore than I can control the weather\" said Jake before hendrove off. Ellie went back to her mum's to getnready for the wedding. Melanie was in her dressing room atnthe Carmichael plantation. She was thinking about the talk she hadnwith Jake, they had agreed that Ellie could stay here if she wantednto and that Gabby would visit one weekend a month. But what Melanienwas really thinking about was the kiss, they had been reminisingnabout when Ellie was younger and then she had leaned in and kissednhim, it was the most amazing and magical kiss she had ever had, thenshe had realized what she was doing and ran out and she hadn't seennJake since. Just then Melanie's mother walked in tonhelp her get ready. \"Realx it's just nerves\"nMelanie's mother said as she did up Melanie's dress, \"You'rendoin the right thing\" \"Am I\" asked Melanienuncertainly \"When I married your daddy...nLord, I was a fool for that man, I couldn't put one foot in front ofnthe other. I remember standing there thinking 'Preacher hurry upnbefore he changes his mind' and look where it got me. Sometimes thatnman makes me so mad, I could wring his neck.\" \"But you still love him?\"nasked Melanie thinking that her mum and dad were just like her andnJake. \"God knows I do. And only henknows why.\" she answered \"Momma\" started Melanienbefore her mother interupted \"He can give you life that wennever dreamed of. And he adores you.\" \"He does doesn't he?\" Melanie's mother left her alone tonfinish getting ready. She turned on the radio, little did she knownJake was listening to the exact same station at the same time. I didn't mean it when I said I didn't love you so Melanie thought about the horriblenthings she had said to Jake and she hoped he knew that she didn'tnmean any of it. I should have held on tight I never should have let you go I didn't know nothing, I was stupid, I was foolish I was lying to myself I couldn't have fathomed I would ever be without your love Never imagined I'd be sitting Here beside myself Guess I didn't know you Guess I didn't know me But I thought I knew everything I never felt Jake was sitting thinking about hownthis was the second time this month he was listening to love songsnand thinking about Melanie, but he couldn't help it the songs justnmade him think about Melanie. The feeling that I'm feeling Now that I don't hear your voice Or have your touch and kiss yournlips Cause I don't have a choice Oh what I wouldn't give To have you lying by my side This time it was both Melanie and Jakenthinking how much they missed each other and just wanted each othernback. When you left I lost a part of me It's still so hard to believe Come back baby please cause We belong together Who else am I gonna lean on whenntimes get rough Who's gonna talk to me on thenphone Till the sun comes up Who's gonna take your place There ain't nobody better Oh baby baby We belong together Jake couldn't believe hownaccurate this song was it was as if it was written about him and hownhe felt about Melanie. He had felt as if he lost a part of himselfnwhen she left. I can't sleep at night When you are on my mind Bobby Womack's on the radio Singing to me \"If You Think You'renLonely Now\" Wait a minute this is too deep I gotta change the station So I turn the dial tryin' to catchna break And then I hear Babyface \" I Only Think Of You\" and it'snbreakin' my heart I'm tryin' to keepnit together but I'm falling apart Melanie thought about allnthe night she spent awake thinking about Jake and listening to songsnand thinking about how the words reminded her of Jake, exactly whatnshe was doing now. She was trying to keep it together but she wasn'tnsure how much longer she could do it. The pain reflected in this song Ain't even half of what I'mnfeeling inside I need you, need you back in my lifenbaby Both Jake and Melanie were almost inntears. Melanie told herself that if anyone noticed she was cryingnthey would know something was wrong and she couldn't lie about it ifnsomebody asked. Jake told himself that he couldn't cry over hernbecause that would make things worse although he didn't know how,nMelanie was getting married in 2 minutes. We belongntogether Jake and Melanie both knew in thatnmoment that it was true they did belong together. You've all seen the film you knownwhat happens next.[Chapter 17] The Wedding Reception I know I'm skipping ahead a bit,nthis is set just as Melanie and Jake arrive at the wedding reception. Wade came into the lodge and announced \"Well folks. Look who finallynmade it to their reception. Ladies and Gentlemen Mrs and Mr JakenPerry\" The whole lodge errupted into cheers asnJake carried Melanie inside. They put their hands up in the air tonshow that Wade had handcuffed them together. Wade then took thenhandcuffs off, as he did Bobby Ray shouted out, \"You might wanna keep those fornthe honeymoon\" Everyone laughed and then Gabby andnEllie ran to congradualate her parents, with both of thier facesnbeaming with happiness. \"Hey! Hey! Hey! Speech Speech\"nshouted Stella \"Well\" Jake said \" I donbelieve I owe this lady a dance\" You all know what happens afternthat. THE END ","Summary":" Backround Information When Melanie left Jake, she took theirnseven year old daughter Ellie with her"},{"Movie":"Sinister","Title":"I Am Sinister","Author":"Bunnie24","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9061551","Passage":"[Chapter 1] Warning: This chapter is EXTREMELY BORING! This chapter, and probably the next one, is simply for character development. I promise the suspense/horror/Baghuul stuff will happen soon. She contemplated as she decided over which box to pick up next: the last box for dad's office that was extreme heavy, or the next box for the kitchen that she was certain would come undone as she picked it up. As she decided she could feel someone's presence at the edge of the moving truck. \"Ma'am?\" she heard. The young girl turned and smiled from the depths that was the rather deep U-Haul moving van. \"Yes?\" she replied, walking towards the edge of the van. The man smiled \"I'm looking for Harold Hannity?\" he said. The girl nodded \"Yes.\" She said, climbing down the moving van \"You're the electrician?\" she asked. The man nodded again \"Yes.\" The girl nodded \"Okay, he's inside.\" She said, instructing the electrician to follow as they both walked into the depths of the new house. She could hear her father from a mile away \"Please me careful with that, there's only three in existence!\" Harold Hannity said to the moving crew. \"Dad?\" she said into the large, open living room. Harold turned to his daughter \"Yeah, Elise?\" \"The electrician is here.\" She proclaimed, showing the electrician towards her father before walking out of the living and the house once again. She put the box on her fathers' desk, she was glad it was the final box to his office since his office was far off from the front door. Elise took a deep breathe as she let her heart rate go back to normal as well as her breathing; she reminded herself to get back into shape the second she could. She heard her father call her from the living room once again; she smirked as she made her way to the living room to find her father trying to move another bookshelf. \"Do you need help?\" Elise asked, trying to hide a chuckle as her father struggled with the large bookcase. \"If you don't mind.\" Harold said, trying to push the bookshelf forward. Elise moved the bookcase from the other side, letting it walk before her back came into contact with a wall and she stopped. She moved away as her father pushed the bookshelf against the wall, a smile on his face as he succeeded in his first task of moving. Elise watched her father, dancing to himself when the echo of her hungry stomach filled the living room. Harold stopped and turned to his daughter, looking at his watch, then looking back up at his daughter \"Order a pizza, anything you want!\" he said. \"Really?\" she asked with a smile. \"Anything except Onions!\" he said, walking out of the living room. \"Aw, c'mon!\" Elise protested. Harold laughed \"No way!\" Elise took in another deep breathe before leaving the living room and walking into the hallway where a box rested up against the wall. The box read 'Ellen's Things', Elise picked at her nails, looking around to see if her father was nearby, but he wasn't; so she picked up the box and walked towards the cord that was dangling from the ceiling. She opened the door to the attic and climbed up the steps to find a bare space except for one green box in the middle. \"Are you shitting me?\" Elise asked to the air as she pushed the box in her hands onto the attic floor and climbed up to examine the other box. Elise looked down at the box that read 'Home Movies' on the side of it; she opened it to find a projector and several 8 millimeter films. She huffed, putting the top back on the box and kicked it towards the attic door where she then carried it down and outside of the house and into the trash. Elise never gave it a second thought as she walked back into the house and locked the door behind her; she noticed how dark the house was becoming as she began to turn on every light she passed on her way to retrieve her cell phone. Harold passed by Elise in the hall as she retrieved her cell phone from the kitchen, watching her search for pizza parlors around the area before he cleared his throat. Elise looked up at her father and smiled, waiting for him to say something as he crossed his arms. \"So, how is everything going on your end?\" he asked. Elise smirked as she looked back down on her phone \"Everything is good. Looking for a pizza place that isn't thirty minutes away.\" She said before looking up at her father. Harold nodded \"Okay, well let me know when you order.\" He said, walking away. Elise remained still for a moment; she could still feel the struggle between her and her father, the past few months had been a struggle for the both of them; but that's why they moved in the first place. She finally found a pizza place that delivered to their location as she dialed the number and called, ordering a large pizza for both her and her father before hanging up her phone and putting it in her back pocket. \"Elise! Pizza!\" Harold yelled, placing two paper plates on the table. Elise soon followed, smiling as the box of pizza greeted her \"Pizza, Pizza.\" She remarked, sitting down next to her father and taking three slices for herself. Harold smirked \"Hungry? Or did you just fall in love with pizza?\" he asked, grabbing on slice for himself. Elise smiled \"Just hungry.\" She said before taking a big bite out of her first slice of pizza. Harold nodded \"Okay.\" He said, taking a bite as well. \"So, how's your room going?\" he asked. Elise looked at her father \"It's going. It's a very slow process.\" She said. Harold reached out for his daughters hand, Elise took his hand in return as they looked around their new kitchen for a moment. \"Are we gonna be okay?\" Elise asked. Harold nodded \"Yes.\" He said, kissing her hand \"We're going to be just fine.\" He assured her. Elise was getting ready for bed, brushing her teeth and staring herself down in the mirror; she spit out her toothpaste and washed out her mouth before giving herself a good long stare. She scratched her head as she adjusted her hair, coming across her scar that was hidden beneath her hair. Elise exposed her scalp, seeing the scar across her forehead as she reached up to touch it, only to take her hand back and ball it into a fist; she closed her eyes in sorrow as she let the scar hide once again within her hair. Harold stopped by her bathroom, smiling at her \"Goodnight, Elise.\" He said. \"Goodnight, dad.\" Elise said softly, adjusting her throat before turning off her light and walking down the hall to her bedroom before closing the door. Elise laid in bed, staring up at the ceiling as she thought to herself; this was the beginning of something, new or bad she wasn't sure, but something.[Chapter 2] It awoke her in the night, the loud bang coming from her ceiling as her eyes busted open. Elise sat up in her bed, staring up at the ceiling and waiting for another noise to arise; but there wasn't. She waited a moment longer, her mind interjecting thoughts into her mind as she finally huffed and got out of bed; she grabbed her sweater from off the floor as she wrapped herself in it before exiting her bedroom. \"Dad?\" Elise whispered. Yet her father did not respond to her, she looked down the hall at her fathers' bedroom door that was still closed; she inched her way towards it as she tried not to disturb the wood floor. Elise grabbed the door knob, holding her breathe as she turned the knob and gently opened the door to find that her father was fast asleep. She closed the door gently as to not wake up when she heard it again, the sound of footsteps coming from the attic. Her mind went empty as she stared at the ceiling, unsure of what to do as she looked around the hallway as if she expected a flash light to magically appear. Elise quietly made her way back into her bedroom where she grabbed her cell phone and turned its flashlight on to use for her journey into the attic. She swallowed hard as she found the dangling string coming from the ceiling, gently grabbing and pulling the door down to reveal stairs; she wasted no time climbing up the stairs with her 'flash light'. Her heart raced as she stuck her head into the attic, using her light to examine the entire attic only to find nothing, except a familiar box Elise was certain she had thrown out earlier that day. Elise hummed, climbing up the attic to get a closer to look at the box; she removed the top to see the projector and films that she had found earlier that day. \"What the fuck?\" Elise muttered, looking up and around the attic once again before she put the top back on the box and dragged it to the attic door. Elise then decided to wait until morning to throw the box in the trash once again as she climbed down the ladder and gently closed the attic door shut. She made her way quietly back down the hall and into her bedroom where she turned off her cell phone and placed it back on her night table before crawling back into bed. As she was dosing off to sleep she heard another bang coming from down the hall, her eyes bolted open and she once against sat up in bed. She contemplated getting out of bed as her body struggled to stay away long enough to go investigate before giving up and laying back in her bed. Elise couldn't help but smile as her body rejoiced as she began to go back to sleep, ignoring every bump and creak in the house as she blamed the noise on squirrels. She awoke with sunlight in her eyes, Elise groaned as she rolled around in bed as she tried to fight the morning and stay in bed all day. \"Elise!\" she heard from a distance. Elise groaned as she covered her head in her pillow while her father entered her bedroom. \"Elise!\" her father called again, pulling the bed sheets away from her sheet. Elise released the pillow and looked at her father \"What?\" she asked. \"It's almost noon, get up!\" Harold said. Elise groaned, fighting her father as she stayed in bed; Harold huffed \"Sweetie, to put it into perspective for you, I've already taught two classes.\" \"Okay, you've made your point.\" Elise muffled through the pillow. Harold folded his arms \"Up!\" he said, grabbing Elise by her arm and pulling her up in bed. Elise took her arm back, letting one giant yawn escape her lips as she sat up in bed and glared her father down \"I'm up! You can leave now.\" Harold laughed \"Oh, no, missy. Not until you physically leave you bed and march into the bathroom to brush your teeth.\" She sighed as she slowly moved out of her bed and walked into her bathroom where Harold followed closely behind her. Elise looked at her father as he leaned against the door frame and smiled at her; Harold watched as his daughter grabbed her tooth brush and began to brush her teeth. \"And on that note, I'm going back to work!\" he said, walking down the hallway. Elise stuck her head out of her bathroom with her toothbrush still in her mouth \"You came home just to wake me up?\" she managed to get out. Harold shook his head \"No. I came back for lunch…figured I'd kill two birds with one stone.\" He said before going down the stairs. \"Please unpack at least ONE box today!\" she heard Harold yell before leaving the house. Elise sighed, rolling her eyes to herself as she continued to brush her teeth and finally waking up for the rest of the day. She had finished her fathers' one request of unpacking one box; her energy level was high as she moved on to another box only to realize that it belonged in the attic. Elise struggled to carry the heavy box towards the attic as she finally dropped the box below the attic door as she pulled the string that pulled the ladder down. It had taken a few minutes but Elise managed to get the heavy box up onto the attic where there she remembered the troubling box from yesterday. Elise pushed the box further into the attic as she picked up and moved the 'home movies' box towards the ladder and began to make her way down towards the second floor. She walked her way slowly down the stairs before making her way to the front yard where the trash was already waiting to be picked up. Elise threw the box into the large pile of trash, saluting the box as she made her way back inside the house quickly as the breeze began to get a chill to it. She locked the door behind her as she took a deep breathe, trying to feel her toes that had come into contact with the bare concrete of the front yard; she then looked out into the open living room where boxes began to pile up. It reminded Elise of a game of Tetras as she cracked her fingers and took a deep breathe out \"Lets do this.\" She muttered to herself.[Chapter 3] Harold came home to the smells of a home cooked meal, the moving boxes had gone missing as everything in the house had been placed. \"Elise?\" he called out, cocking an eye brow as he looked around the house. He found her in the living room, curled up in a ball on the couch as she slept soundly as she cuddled with the remote control. Harold smiled \"Elise?\" he whispered as he stroked her hair. Elise hummed as she awoke, looking up at her father \"What time is it?\" she asked. \"It's almost 5:30.\" Harold responded. Elise rubbed her eyes \"Then I haven't been out that long.\" She said, sitting up on the couch. Harold looked around the living room \"Did you…\" \"Yes, I did. And then I made dinner…and when I was done with that I figured I'd sit down for a second.\" Elise went on to say. Harold smiled \"Well, lets eat! I'm starving!\" he remarked. It didn't take Harold long as he ate everything he could while Elise still nibbled on her mashed potatoes. \"You weren't kidding.\" Elise said as she took another bite of her potatoes. Harold nodded \"Yeah, it was a long rest of my day. One class and then office hours, and those damn Freshman are the worst!\" he said. Elise smirked \"They always are.\" She said. Harold smiled \"Yes.\" He said, before looking around the kitchen \"Did you do the entire house?\" he asked. \"Just the downstairs.\" Elise said, taking another bite of dinner. Harold and Elise were silent for a moment as Elise looked down at her dinner and took a bite of a carrot. \"So, when's your Neurologist appointment?\" Harold asked. Elise looked up at her father \"Wednesday.\" She spoke softly. Harold nodded \"And I shall accompany you so you're not scared.\" \"I'm not scared!\" Elise said with a smile. Harold took her hand \"And that's okay.\" He told her. \"I just want to make sure that you're okay.\" Harold went on to say. Elise took her father's hand \"I'm fine. It's been nine months and I'm still in one piece.\" She assured her father. Harold nodded \"Okay.\" He said. Elise awoke at nearly two in the morning, she felt funny as she leaned up in bed as she held her head; she felt dizzy as she slowly got out of bed. She heard thumping coming from the attic once again, she huffed as she quietly got out of bed and walked down the hall where the attic string hung, blowing with the heater. Elise pulled the string, letting the ladder fall to the ground; she held the railing firmly as she began to climb up the ladder when she felt a strong sensation overcoming her. \"Oh, no. I'm dying.\" Elise thought, losing consciousness. She awoke to loud beeps and bright lights as she finally was able to open her eyes, she stared up at a pale white ceiling. Elise groaned, she was disoriented as she closed her eyes again, ignoring all the noise and light around her. \"Elise?\" she heard someone ask. Elise groaned, she was too weak to speak as she tried to hide her eyes from the light as a hand grabbed her gently. \"Elise?\" she heard the voice ask again. \"What?\" she finally managed to get out. \"Can you open your eyes?\" she heard the voice ask. Elise shook her head \"The light…it's so bright.\" She whispered. \"How about I turn the light off, would that help?\" the person asked. Elise nodded gently as she found the light disappear from behind her eyes as she gently opened them. \"Where am I?\" she whispered. A man appeared out from the corner of her eye in a white coat \"Elise, my name is Doctor Thurman, you had a seizure tonight.\" He told her. Elise took a deep breathe as she looked around the E.R room that she was resting in \"Where's my dad?\" she whispered. \"He's in the waiting room.\" The doctor told her. Elise closed her eyes again, beginning to pull at the cabled that were connected to her body as the doctor stopped her \"No, no, no…don't tug on those!\" the doctor suggested, pulling her hands away. \"I want to see my father.\" Elise demanded, still struggling with waking up from her apparent seizure. The doctor nodded \"Alright, let me get him.\" It went silent as Elise kept her eyes closed, her mind jumbled up and her body sore, especially her head. \"Elise.\" She heard her father respond. \"Dad, what happened?\" she asked, beginning to open her eyes once again. Harold stroked her hair as he looked down at her \"You were going up the ladder to the attic when you fell down mid seizure.\" He told her. Elise let a deep breathe out as she closed her eyes again. \"Elise,\" her father said \"what were you doing in the attic?\" he asked Elise focused on her breathing, trying to remember why when it finally clicked in her mind \"I heard footsteps.\" She muttered. \"What?\" Harold asked. \"I heard footsteps in the attic.\" Elise said, taking another deep breathe. Harold took her hand \"Well, luckily your neurologist appointment is tomorrow so we won't have to wait long.\" He said. \"Tomorrow? What day is it?\" she asked. \"It's Tuesday…almost 3 in the morning.\" Harold told her. Elise tried to adjust herself in bed \"Dad, you should go home, you have work in the morning.\" She remarked. Harold shook his head \"No. Honey, you just had a serious seizure and I'm not going to leave your side for the next 24 hours.\" He told her. Elise groaned \"Fine. I just want to go home.\" She remarked. \"We will.\" Harold assured her. Harold was literal when he said he wouldn't leave Elise's side for the next 24-hours; every time she woke up he was there, waiting for a request or command. Elise would turn away from her father and go back to sleep throughout the day unless she was hungry or needed a bathroom break. She looked up at the attic, wanting to climb up the ladder to see if that box of home movies was up there waiting for her, but she was too weak to move at all. Elise huffed, ignoring her intuition of being too weak as she pulled on the string, letting the ladder fall out from the attic. She wasted no time as she gently climbed up the ladder when she got to the top to find the box once again waiting for her. \"Voodoo magic.\" She muttered to herself as she climbed into the attic and began tugging on the box until she pulled it to the ladder where she gently tried to carry the box as she climbed down the ladder. \"Elise?\" she heard coming down the hall; she thought for a moment as she pushed the ladder back into the attic and hurried into her bedroom where she hid the box under the bed and crawled back inside. Elise took a deep breathe as she cuddled with her pillow and pretended to be asleep as her father came in to check on her again. She felt Harold closing in on her as he checked on her for the fourth time that hour before closing the door behind him as he left her bedroom. Elise remained in her state of bliss, she would figure out what was going with the home movies; however it was just a matter of waiting for the right moment.[Chapter 4] They both sat in the exam room waiting for the neurologist to come back to discuss Elise's MRI results. Elise's eyes darted from her father to random posters on the wall when the door finally opened and entered the middle aged neurologist. \"Hi guys.\" She said as she closed the door behind her with her file. Elise adjusted in her seat while Harold sat on the edge of his seat, anticipating what the doctor was about to tell them. The neurologist turned to the father and daughter and opened the file to examine the results and history of Elise. \"Okay, we knew that Elise suffered a traumatic brain injury in her accident; and that while Elise struggled with small things, she never experienced seizures or developed a speech impediment.\" The neurologist remarked. Elise nodded as the doctor went on \"However the MRI concludes that the brain injury is secluded to the temporal lobe, and that's what caused the seizure.\" \"Is it a permanent thing?\" Elise asked. The doctor removed her glasses \"Most likely not, but it could.\" She said. Elise nodded, Harold took her thigh and sighed \"What do we do now?\" he asked. \"I will prescribe some anti-seizure meds and we'll see what works and what doesn't…it's going to be a long process but I'm sure we'll be able to find something that fits Elise's needs.\" The doctor said. Elise nodded \"Thanks.\" Elise got ready for bed as her father walked into her bedroom, leaning against the door frame as he looked at his daughter. \"Are you alright?\" Harold asked. Elise smirked \"Yeah, of course! Just another way my life is falling apart at the seems.\" She said sarcastically. Harold rolled his eyes as he walked into her bedroom \"Sit down.\" He said, forcing Elise to sit down on her bed with her father. \"I know a lot has happened in the past 9 months, I know. I know you blame yourself for what happened to mom and Haley, but you shouldn't.\" he said, taking her hand. Harold sighed, tearing up as he looked at his daughter \"Sweetie, we all struggle in some way. And you're like your mom, a lot. You're strong and brave…but you're also kind and compassionate.\" Elise sighed, brushing away forming tears as she looked at her father \"Dad, I'm going to spend the rest of my life taking pills so that way I don't have seizures. I knew I would live the rest of my life coping with a brain injury…but not like this.\" She said. \"And I blame myself for mom and Haley because I saw it coming a mile away, and I did nothing! I let that 18-wheeler hit us.\" She responded gently. Harold took Elise's hand \"It was nobody's fault. It just happened.\" He told her. Elise sighed, looking down at her lap as she cleared her throat \"I'm really tired, dad. I've had a rather long day and I need some sleep.\" She said. Harold kissed her forehead \"I love you.\" He said before getting up off the bed and leaving her bedroom, closing the door behind her. Elise let a deep breathe out, wiping her eyes in silence as she listened for her father to close his bedroom door from down the hall. She wasted no time pulling the box out from under her bed and placing it next to her. Elise grabbed a white sheet and tacked it against her window that was across from her bed as she pulled out the projector and films and laid them across her bed when she realized she had no idea how to use an old projector. She muttered a curse as she grabbed her phone and googled 'how to operate an 8mm projector', getting thousands of results; she read the instructions closely as she put the most recent film ' House Painting '12 ' together on the projector. Elise turned off her light as she played the movie, seeing a man in an office looking on his computer and watching films with an identical 8mm camera; she saw two children bickering as well as a young girl painting on a wall. It was then that the film turned dark, a bright light focusing on the man who would bound and gagged to the floor while lying on a tarp near the fireplace. She noticed that the fireplace looked identical to the one in her new downstairs living room as she watched the man look up at the camera before letting his head chopped off with an axe. Elise covered her mouth in shock, wanting to close her eyes but couldn't as she watched the man bleed out onto the tarp before the camera turned to a woman, probably his wife, as she received two wacks with the axe. She couldn't bare it any more; she turned off the projector as she sat in the dark on her bed. \"Oh my god.\" Elise whispered through tears; and in her fear and vulnerability she turned her lamp on and stared at the projector. She took the film out of the project and placed it back in its case before putting everything back in the box; regardless of how many pushes she gave the box that was now back under her bed, she couldn't shake the feeling of fear. She felt like someone was watching her as she took down the white sheet and let it lay on the floor; she contemplated who to call with such footage and while the police came to her mind several times she couldn't bring herself to make the call for some reason. Should she call the local police? Maybe the County? What about the FBI? No, they couldn't give less of a shit. Elise lied in her bed, covers surrounding her and her favorite stuffed animal that she held close. She couldn't close her eyes as every time she did there were the faces of the poor couple who died ruthlessly in their home…her home…or at least she thought. Elise got no sleep, and it was obvious with the bags under her eyes yet she pretended to be asleep as her father checked in on her before heading off to the university. As her bedroom door closed, her eyes shot open as she shot up in bed, the battle of her conscious now nagging at her once again for the hundredth time. 'The film and how she should report it to the authorities.' She told herself one more time before she got out of bed and pulled the box from underneath it again and placed it on her bed. She glared for a moment before turning to her closet to change into her wardrobe for the day; making a rather easy decision hard as she finally got dressed in jeans and a t-shirt. Elise turned back to the box, giving it once last look before she took a deep breathe and decided to bite the bullet as she reached for her cell phone to call the local authorities. As she dialed the number, the doorbell rang; Elise huffed as she ended the unfinished call and made her way downstairs and towards the front door where she opened it to find a man in uniform standing in front of her. \"Hi ma'am, I'm Deputy Olsen with Nassau County, may I come in?\" he asked. Elise stood there for a moment, thinking to herself; how was it possible that a deputy appeared at her door right as she was about to call the cops? Was it coincidence? \"I—I…\" Elise muttered softly. The deputy took a step forward \"Ma'am, are you okay?\" he asked. Elise took a deep breathe \"Can I show you something?\" she asked gently. The deputy nodded \"Absolutely.\" He said, walking inside the house.[Chapter 5] She covered her mouth as Deputy Olsen stood in shock, watching the film in Elise's bedroom through it's entirety. Deputy Olsen turned to Elise before turning off the projector, the both of them silent, especially Deputy Olsen. \"What's your name?\" he asked. \"Elise.\" She muttered. Deputy Olsen played with his belt nervously \"Elise, where did you find this film?\" he asked. Elise swallowed hard as she looked up at the deputy \"I found it in a box in the attic when we moved in.\" she said. \"How long ago was that?\" he asked. \"A week ago.\" She said, standing up \"But here's the thing, I threw away that box twice, and it ended back up in the attic.\" She said. The deputy nodded \"Do you live alone?\" he asked. Elise shook her head \"No, I live with my father.\" She said. \"Would your father bring that box back up the attic?\" the deputy asked. \"Without asking me what it was? No.\" Elise responded. Deputy Olsen cleared his throat \"Why don't we go back downstairs? We have a lot to talk about.\" He said. \"The house you're currently living in used to be the residence of a man by the name of Ellison Oswalt and his family.\" Deputy Olsen stated. Elise nodded, playing with a loose thread on her jeans. \"They were murdered in this house a year ago. Now, the report goes that Oswalt, his wife, and son were murdered but his daughter, Ashley, went missing. At the time, Mr. Oswalt was writing a true crime novel involving a family who also had the same fate at his family.\" The deputy said. Elise sighed \"Deputy, why did you knock on my door today?\" she asked. She kicked herself mentally, out of all the things that were running through her mind THAT was the question that escaped her lips? Deputy Olsen cleared his throat \"To warn you.\" He said. \"Warn me?\" she asked. The deputy nodded \"The thing is, I don't know how to explain it to you without sounding crazy.\" He admitted. \"I'd believe you. I can see it your eyes.\" Elise said. The deputy rose from his seat \"Mr. Oswalt and his family had moved into that other family's house so he could write this novel about the murdered family and their missing daughter, Stephanie. However, it all became bigger than he had anticipated.\" He said. \"How?\" she asked. Deputy Olsen popped his knuckles \"A string of murders with the same M.O. and a pagan deity by the name of Bughuul.\" \"Bughuul? Elise asked. He nodded \"Yeah. He, uhm, he is also known as Mr. Boogie, but anyway…he is or was a pagan deity who ate the souls of children.\" Elise thought for a moment \"That sounds…nice.\" She managed to get out. Deputy Olsen sat next to her \"But that's besides the point. I was working with Mr. Oswalt on this case when I figured out the connection between all the cases.\" He said. \"And?\" Elise asked. \"The next victims in line all lived in the house after the previous victims.\" He said. Elise cocked an eye brow as she looked at the deputy \"I don't understand.\" \"Okay, so there was a family who died by drowning in their home, the next family lived in the house before moving away and BAM…died by burning alive in their car.\" The deputy said. \"WOAH!\" Elise remarked, standing up \"Okay. I get it!\" she went on to say. \"They're all there…in those 8mm films.\" He said. Elise covered her mouth \"Holy shit.\" She remarked. \"They were in the attic of Ellison's house when he moved in,\" the deputy said \"They're all connected to the house.\" He went on to say. Elise looked at Deputy Olsen \"You're telling me that there are snuff films in my house, and not just that, they are CONNECTED to my house because a family was murdered by a pagan deity who killed the family and took their youngest daughter to feast on her soul?\" Deputy Olsen stared at Elise \"Did I miss anything?\" Elise asked. He stood up and looked her square in the eye \"If you leave this house, you will die.\" He said. Elise felt her heart fall into her stomach as she sat down on the couch, her hand on her chest as her heart raced. \"Elise?\" he asked, sitting down next to her. She turned to the deputy \"Do you know where Ellison Oswalt's research is?\" she asked. \"I have it.\" The deputy said. Elise nodded \"Can I borrow it?\" \"Why?\" \"Maybe there's a way to stop him.\" Elise suggested. Deputy Olsen smiled \"Okay. But just as long as I am along for the ride, cause if this gets over your head like it did Ellison, I'm ending it.\" He told her. Elise agreed, shaking the deputy's hand as she finally escorted the deputy out of her house, before taking his shoulder to get his attention \"What should I do with the films?\" she asked. The deputy shrugged his shoulders \"Whatever you want.\" He said, walking off the porch and back to his patrol car. Elise sat in front of her laptop, typing in the name of Ellison Oswalt to find many search results in front of her. Half of the results were of his infamous book as well as his bombs while the other half were about his murder and his missing daughter. Elise went on to spend several hours as she read every article resulting from the murder and watched every video report of the murder before going to watching interviews of Ellison. She smiled as she listened to him, he seemed ambitious as he talked about his novels, though every newer once became worse and seemed to reek of desperation, or that's how it seemed to Elise. Elise looked at the time, it was nearly noon and her father would be returning for a quick lunch soon; she closed her laptop and cleaned up the projector and films before realizing that she didn't have a plan for them. Let's put it back in the attic. No. Let's throw it away again. Yeah, just like it worked the past two times. Let's burn it. Wouldn't that bring the 'deity' into the real world? Elise huffed, taking the box as she placed it under her bed, she'd figure out what to do with it later as she took the sheet down once again and threw it in her dirty laundry hamper. She took several deep breathes as she thought about all the information the deputy had given her; could it all be possibly true? It had seemed skeptical, but she believed in stranger things. \"Give him a shot.\" Elise thought to herself as she left her bedroom to go downstairs and prepare lunch; she could feel it in her bones that this would become of something sinister. But she couldn't help herself to 'finishing Ellison's work', or at least that's how she saw it.[Chapter 6] She waited for her father to do back to sleep; throughout the rest of the day the other films seemed to be calling to her as she put the sheet back up on the wall and tried to remember how to work the projector. The bedroom was dark as the next film rolled, Hanging Out '11 . Elise watched closely as the family before her eyes laughed and played, she waited for things to change pace when the film's lighting went dark and four people were dangling from a tree. She watched closely as a tree trunk began to saw itself off before the family fell and began to strangle to death; Elise covered her mouth as she watched the family struggle before finally fell still. There were no words as Elise turned off the film, thinking about that poor family and wondered if this 'journey' was worth it. Elise turned to the box; two films down, four to go. She grabbed a random film canister from the box and opened it, preparing the next film before putting the last one away; she couldn't stop herself as she decided to watch all the films that night. There were no happy moments in this one as it started in the dark kitchen and made its way up the stairs with a spot light guiding her to the master bedroom. Was this one already too late as she saw two people lying on the bed with a barking Chihuahua in between them? But it wasn't. Elise watched as a man lied on the bed with tape covering his mouth when a knife appeared to slit the man's throat; her mouth was agape as the camera went to the other side of the bed to slit a woman's throat. Her eyes were glued to the scene as she watched the camera go down the hall and into the siblings' room when she finally remembered how to move her fingers and turned off the camera. She knew what was coming, why bother watching? \"I think that's enough for one night.\" She muttered to herself before hearing her bedroom door creak open. Elise turned to see who was entering her bedroom, but nobody entered as she crawled her way to the end of her bed. \"Dad?\" she called out. There was no answer as Elise got off her bed and exited her bedroom to figure out what was going on out in the hallway, if anything. She stood in the dark for a moment before turning on the hallway light to examine the second floor where she could find nothing. Harold's bedroom door was closed and Elise dared not open his door when she finally gave up and turned off the light when she heard footsteps in the attic. Elise swallowed hard before taking a deep breathe in \"You have the films, it just a squirrel.\" She told herself as she went back into her bedroom, making sure she closed the door before turning her lamp on to put away the projector and films as well as the sheet. It wasn't hard to get to sleep as she fought to keeps her eyes open as she thought about everything from the past 48 hours and how mentally and physically exhausted she was. She smiled to herself as she thought that was the reason she was falling asleep to easily tonight, closing her eyes and letting go of everything for just a few short hours. Since Harold wasn't using his office space, Elise took advantage of it as both she and Deputy Olsen unpacked boxes of Ellison Oswalt's research throughout the office space. Elise made sure everything had its place and enough space to add more as they covered walls and windows with pictures, transcripts, and Ellison's handwritten notes. \"How much research did Ellison have?\" Elise asked. Deputy Olsen sighed as he opened another box \"At least five boxes worth!\" he said. \"The man was dedicated.\" \"That's for sure.\" Elise looked at Ellison's notes on all the films, his notes were skewed with many different topics on one different page as she tilted her head when one sentence caught her eye. \"…when enhancing the films, Bughuul can be found in every one hiding in corners and sometimes in plain sight.\" Elise cleared her throat \"Hey, did he ever mention anything to you about actually seeing Bughuul?\" she asked. Deputy Olsen nodded \"He actually showed me a picture that he got from one of the films.\" He said. \"Have we unpacked it yet?\" Elise asked. Deputy Olsen shook his head \"No…but we're almost out of boxes so we're bound to find something.\" He said. Elise nodded, walking towards the deputy \"Are you supposed to be somewhere?\" she asked. The deputy looked up at her \"What do you mean?\" \"I mean, aren't you supposed to be, well, at work? On patrol? In the office?\" she asked. Deputy Olsen showed the walkie talkie sitting on the desk \"That's why I brought this with me.\" Elise nodded in approval as she grabbed the last box and began unpacking the rest of the paper work taping it to whatever space was left in the office when a transmission came though the radio. \"Deputy Olsen? We've got a B&E; in progress, respond? \" the radio said. He picked up the radio \"Rodger.\" He said, turning off the radio and smiling at Elise. \"See you later.\" Elise said. \"You're gonna be fine with this?\" he asked. \"It's paperwork!\" she assured him. Deputy Olsen nodded \"Okay, well if you find anything let me know!\" he said, leaving the office and out of the Hannity house entirely. Elise sighed, looking at everything that had taken pretty much the entire afternoon to do when she looked down at the box to see a picture staring back at her. The orange ambiance of the picture confused her as she picked the picture out of the box and examined it closely. She could only assume one thing as she saw the figure on the picture, the side angle only gave her chills as she placed the picture closest to the work desk, still unable to peel her eyes away from the picture. \"Elise?\" she heard Harold call from across the house. She shook herself out of her daze as she ran out of the office, closing the door behind her, and meeting her father in the living room. \"Hey, dad.\" She said, almost out of breathe. Harold cocked an eye brow \"You alright?\" he asked. Elise nodded \"Yeah, just…running around.\" She said. \"Okay…\" Harold said, handing his daughter his shoes. Elise took her shoes and looked at her father \"Where are we going?\" she asked. Harold smiled \"We are going to dinner.\" He said. \"I can make dinner, dad, it's ok.\" She said. Harold shook his head \"No, I want to go out, I've been craving Chinese and couple of co-workers and I were talking about this nice little place in the downtown area.\" He said. Elise nodded as she put her shoes on \"Okay, that works for me.\"[Chapter 7] Elise played with her straw in silence as both her and her father waited for their food to arrive when Harold cleared his throat. \"So, what did you do today?\" he asked. Elise looked up at her father and shrugged her shoulders \"Nothing.\" She said. Harold nodded \"Well maybe you should start. I know you can't drive, but town isn't that far away.\" He told her. Elise sighed \"Dad, I know.\" \"You need to make friends! I feel guilty leaving you alone in the house for hours at a time.\" Harold confessed to her. \"Dad, I know. But I feel like I need the quiet right now. I'll get out there; I'm just not ready yet.\" Elise said, taking a sip of her drink. Harold sat back in his seat as Elise smiled at her father \"Don't worry about me dad.\" She muttered. \"How can I not? You've just developed a seizure disorder.\" He told her. Elise smiled softly \"But I'm on medications…and I haven't had once since that night.\" She told him. Harold nodded in agreement, but he couldn't shake his worrying father ways as he looked at Elise \"…maybe you could start taking classes at the college!\" he suggested. \"No way in hell dad.\" She said, shooting down his idea. A tree branch scratched her window as the crackling sound of thunder woke Elise from her sleep. Elise groaned as she stretched in her bed, looking at her window to see the brightness of the lightening that showed the shadow of the tree. She sat up in her bed, knowing that she'd never get back to sleep as she grabbed her favorite cardigan from her chair and wrapped it around her as she got out of bed and walked out into the hallway. Elise let one yawn out as she stood in the middle of the hallway; she felt a cold chill surrounding her through her cardigan as she walked towards the stairs. She looked down the stairs as the lightening brightened the first floor, Elise contemplated if going downstairs for a drink or to watch television was worth it when she felt a breeze across her back. Elise turned her head slowly before turning her body where she found a creature stranding in front of her. She gasped, holding onto the railing as the being stood in front of her with a triangle face, empty eye sockets, no mouth, and greasy looking hair; she couldn't move as she stood eye to eye with the deity. It grabbed her arm roughly, almost taunting her as she tried to pull away from it's terrifying grasp before it finally let go and she fell back onto the stairs. The creature was the last thing she remembered seeing as she toppled down the stairs, hitting every stair on the way before becoming unconscious. She awoke on the couch with two paramedics kneeling in front of her with Harold behind them watching her closely. Her head throbbed with pain as she reached out to push her hand up against the pain when a paramedic took her arm and rested it back down on her side. \"Elise?\" she heard in a foggy manner as she began to fight her grogginess. \"Elise?\" she heard again, but this time slightly clearer. She hummed; blinking her eyes when everything was finally clear \"Elise?\" the paramedic asked as she finally became fully conscious. Elise turned to the paramedic who grabbed a small flash light from his pocket and tested her pupils before looked at her once again. \"Do you feel nauseated?\" he asked. Elise shook her head \"No.\" she said. \"Any severe pain anywhere?\" he asked. \"No.\" she said once again. The paramedics backed away slowly while Elise slowly sat up on the couch and looked around the house to find paramedics everything. \"What happened?\" she muttered. Harold sat next to his daughter \"You fell down a flight of stairs and hit your head.\" He told her. Elise turned to the stairs, pieces of a memory coming back to her as a loud rumble of thunder accompanied the thoughts of the strange creature standing behind her before it pushed her down the stairs. She sat up quickly in the couch \"I feel fine! I'm really tired…you should go.\" She said, trying to push herself off the couch. The paramedics looked at each other before turning to Elise \"You're sure?\" Elise nodded \"Yeah. Please, go!\" she said, slowly getting off the couch and attempting to gain her balance. The paramedics packed up and quickly left, leaving Harold and Elise alone in the house once again; Harold glared at his daughter who huffed \"What?\" \"This is all seeming like it's more trouble than it's worth!\" Harold proclaimed. Elise rolled her eyes \"I tripped! Easy as that! I woke up from the storm, decided to get a glass of water and since I'm not use to going down such steep stairs in the middle of the night, I slipped!\" she remarked. Harold scuffed \"You couldn't use the tap water in your bathroom!?\" he asked. Elise hummed, rubbing her eyes \"Y'know what dad, I don't want to have this conversation anymore. I just want to try and go back to bed.\" She said. Elise made her way up the stairs; she pulled the sleeves of her cardigan to find a hand shaped bruise on her left arm. She muttered a curse to herself before hiding the bruise back under her cardigan sleeve before climbing back upstairs and into her bedroom. She dialed the number to the Sherriff's office, she listened to the tone go on for a moment before somebody finally picked up. \"Nassau County Sherriff's Office.\" The voice said. Elise cleared her throat \"Hi, yes, is Deputy Olsen there?\" she asked. \"I'm sorry, he's no in the office right now. Is there something I could help you with?\" the voice asked again. She huffed \"Is there any way to reach him?\" she asked. The voice hummed for a second \"I could page him for you. Can I have your name and number?\" the voice asked. Elise gave the information then hung up, staring at the phone for what felt like an eternity before her cell phone finally rang; she wasted no time answering the phone. \"Hello?\" she asked in a hurry. \"What's going on?\" Deputy Olsen asked. Elise sighed \"You should probably come over immediately.\" She said. \"Well, I'm in the middle of something.\" He told her. Elise rolled her eyes, biting her lip and thinking for a moment \"Fine, I'll come to you. Where are you?\" she asked. The deputy tried to silence a chuckle, but Elise could hear as he finally calmed down \"I'm downtown, dealing with some type of domestic dispute.\" He said. She didn't waste any time as she hung up her phone, grabbed her purse and walked out of her bedroom where she rushed towards the entrance. Elise put on her shoes in a hurry, not listening to her surroundings when her father walked out of the living room. \"Where are you going?\" he asked. \"Out.\" She said. \"Well you can't drive!\" he told her. Elise put on her other shoe and glared at her father \"I'm not taking the car. I'm going out.\" She said before storming out of the house with her purse in one hand and her coat in the other. She had to get to the deputy, she couldn't wait for him.[Chapter 8] 1. Sorry this chapter is kind of/sort of late. 2. Sorry this chapters sucks so f*cking hard! I wanted to get the story/characters somewhere but it just turned into a mess...so I apologize. Hope you enjoy. She finally made her way into town, she was beginning to shiver in the cold weather, clearly she wasn't prepared. Elise made her way down every block of the downtown area, she searched for a Sheriff's Department car or Deputy Olsen himself but her shaking body couldn't take much more of the cold and she was beginning to give up. \"Elise!\" someone yelled out behind her. She turned around to find the deputy coming toward her, she stood where she was, as if if she moved they'd lose each other. Deputy Olsen crossed his arms \"SO what's so important that you just had to come to me?\" he asked. Elise pulled the sleeve up and showed the deputy the hand shaped bruise on her wrist, he was speechless as he looked up to her. \"Who did that to you?\" he asked. Elise raised her eye rows \"Who do you think?\" she asked. The deputy looked over Elise's head to see that they were standing in front of a coffee shop. \"Want to get some coffee?\" he asked. \"I think this is bigger than I thought.\" Elise admitted, stirring her coffee. The deputy took a sip of his coffee \"Don't give up. You need to end this!\" he said. Elise rolled her eyes \"I haven't even started it! He's not playing games, he's getting straight to the point and trying to kill me and my father. Mostly me.\" She said, taking a sip of her coffee. The deputy smiled, he grabbed his notepad and a pen from his pocket and began to write down a number \"Then we shall pick up where Ellison left off.\" He said, ripping out the paper and handing it to Elise. \"Professor Sean Jonas?\" Elise asked. \"Ellison spoke with him a mere two hours before he was murdered.\" The deputy said. Elise nodded, putting the number in her bag before going back to her coffee \"Thanks.\" She said gently. The deputy nodded \"No problem, just edge into the Bughuul talk with him, he didn't take Ellison's death lightly.\" He said. Elise nodded as she took another sip of her coffee, she could feel her cell phone vibrate in her pocket for the hundredth time. She groaned as she grabbed her phone to check it: 5 missed calls and 13 text messages just from her father. \"I've got to go.\" She said, standing up from her seat \"Thanks for the coffee.\" She said. The deputy nodded as she stood up \"You're welcome.\" He said. \"If you want, I can give you a lift home,\" he suggested \"The sun is setting, which means you'll freeze to death and you won't be able to se.\" he said. Elise scrunched her nose, wanting to say 'no', but she knew he had several points. She heard Deputy Olsen drive out of the driveway as she entered the house where her father was waiting for her in the living room. Elise closed the door, waiting for her father to pounce on her as he got up off the couch and walked out of the living room. \"You know what, I'm just going to beat you to the punch; I'm 23 and I deserve to have a life, and I'm not going to let Epilepsy stop me!\" she said. Harold looked at his daughter before kissing her forehead and going upstairs \"Goodnight, Elise.\" He simply said before disappearing upstairs. Elise placed her cardigan on the hanger before she walked down the hallway and entered the office where everything was still in its place. She grabbed her wallet from inside her purse and pulled out Doctor Jonas' number; she looked at the clock to see that it was half past nine; Elise thought it over before she grabbed her cell phone and began dialing his number. It seemed like he wasn't going to answer when she pulled the phone away from her ear when she heard somebody pick up on the other end. \"This is Professor Jonas.\" She voice on the other end of the phone, it was clear he had run to his phone. Elise cleared her throat \"Uh, hi…yes…Professor Jonas,\" \"Who is this?\" he asked, interrupting Elise. \"I'm Elise, Elise Hannity.\" She said. \"Are you a student?\" he asked. Elise was taken aback by the professor \"Uh, no.\" she said, looking around the office. The professor sighed \"Okay, then Ms. Hannity, how can I help you?\" he asked. She cleared her throat \"I was hoping to maybe speak with about a deity that I've recently come across.\" She said, swallowing hard as she waited for him to respond. \"What deity?\" he asked. Elise put her free hand in her jeans pocket \"Bughuul.\" She said softly. The professor was silent, she was sure she had lost him before she heard him gently clear his throat \"Do you think you could come to my office tomorrow?\" he asked. Elise closed her eyes \"Yes. What time would be good for you?\" she asked. Elise waited for Professor Jonas in his office while Deputy Olsen made an appearance at the Sheriff's office until she called to pick her up. She rocked in her chair as she waited; she was getting more anxious by the second as she heard him fiddle in his classroom before he finally walked into his office. Professor Jonas sat at his desk and glared at Elise for a moment before he cleared his throat \"How do you know about Bughuul?\" he asked. Elise stared back at the professor \"He's in my house.\" She responded. The professor nodded \"Where do you live?\" he asked. \"Ellison Oswalt's old house.\" She said softly, her breathing began to shallow as she Professor looked away from her for the first time during their talk. \"Professor Jonas. I need your help…please.\" She said gently. The professor looked at her; she played with her fingers as she noticed the wheels turning in his head. \"What all do you know?\" he asked. Elise let a small smile escape her lips \"Everything.\" She said softly.[Chapter 9] Elise sat alone in the office with nothing but the soft sound of the clock ticking that managed to go along with her heart beat. She looked at everything on the walls from a distance as she remembered the conversation with Professor Jonas; there were chills down her spine as she recalled every word that was spoken. \"Ms. Hannity,\" the professor spoke \"…there is no stopping Bughuul.\" He told her. \"To your knowledge.\" Elise remarked. Professor Jonas shrugged his shoulders \"Yes. But what you're dealing with is a deity, there's no real way to kill a deity.\" He told her. Elise adjusted herself in her chair \"Professor Jonas, I don't have a lot of options. There aren't any children in the house…it's just my father and I. I'm quite concerned about not knowing what Bughuul will do, or how he will go about doing things.\" The professor nodded, his fingers pressing together while silence engulfed the room; Elise heard her breathing begin to shallow as Professor Jonas' lips parted. \"I'm sorry,\" he said \"…but there's nothing I can do.\" Elise felt her throat swell \"But…there has to be something.\" She said. \"No.\" he said. Elise stared at the professor \"No?\" she asked rhetorically. The professor sighed \"I'm sorry I couldn't be more help to you.\" \"No…you can, you just don't want to! You're so afraid of having more blood on your hands—and lets be honest, Ellison's death was not your fault—that you turn away people who you could probably help…lives you could save.\" Elise said before getting up from her chair. Elise looked at the professor \"You were a complete waste of time…in case you didn't already know.\" She said before walking out of his office. Elise brushed away a forming tear, she let a deep breathe escape her lips before she stood up and began to pace around the office. Her mind wandered from topic to topic before she saw an unopened box in the corner of the house, she could have sworn that her and Deputy Olsen had opened all the boxes as she walked towards it. She opened the box only to be surprised by the contents as she picked up the box and placed it on her desk. The miscellaneous items, which Elise believed to have belonged to Ellison, had begun to collect dust as Elise pulled all the items out of the box one by one. Elise sat in her chair and examined every belonging, grabbing each and getting a closer look when she finally picked up the glasses case; she gently opened it to find a pair of reading glasses inside. She smiled, pulling the glasses out and placing the case on the edge of the desk; Elise looked through the glasses and smiled before putting them on. The bifocals were strong as Elise swiftly took them off and began to blink furiously. \"Damn Ellison,\" Elise spoke aloud \"…you were getting old.\" She said, putting the glasses on the table and leaning back in the chair as she rubbed her eyes. After looking up at the ceiling for a few minutes, Elise turned the light on her cell phone to see the time: 11:30 P.M. Elise groaned as she grabbed her cell phone while standing up from the chair and putting it in her back pocket; she gave herself a good stretch before turning off the light and leaving the office. She walked past the living room to find her father sitting in his lounge chair, grading papers as a fire lit up the entire room. \"Are you still up?\" she asked, walking into the living room. Harold looked up from his paper \"Yes. Obviously…why are you still up?\" he asked. \"Oh,\" Elise mumbled, putting her hands in her cardigan pockets as she thought up an excuse \"I lost track of time.\" She said. Harold nodded \"Were you in the office again?\" he asked. Elise tensed as she looked at her dad \"Maybe.\" She said softly. He took his glasses off and looked at his daughter \"What do you do in there? It's supposed to be my office, but I can't use it.\" He said. \"Have you been in there?\" Elise asked, perching her neck out towards her father. Harold shook his head \"No, I respect your privacy…but should I go in there?\" he asked. Elise shook her head \"No. There's nothing really going on in there.\" She said. \"So…what are you doing in there?\" Harold asked again. Elise smiled, trying to think of another excuse when she shrugged her shoulders \"Just…uhm…writing…pacing…stuff…\" she said. Harold smirked \"You use my office to pace around? You have an entire house to do that!\" he said with a chuckle. Elise chuckled \"Yeah…but the view to the yard is just beautiful back there…so…yeah…\" Her father nodded \"Alright,\" he said as he put his reading glasses back on \"Goodnight, Elise.\" He said, going back to his papers. Elise nodded \"Goodnight.\" She said, walking up the stairs and into her bedroom for the night. She awoke with a strong thirst, one of the side effects of her medications; she huffed as she forced herself out of bed and out into the hallway. Elise groggily walked down the staircase and into the kitchen to retrieve a glass of water when she heard a buzzing sound coming from somewhere on the first floor of the house. She put the glass of water down while following the noise that was coming from down the hall and in the office. \"Hello?\" Elise asked as she opened the office door and peeked inside to find a bright light that blinded her for a second before she regained her vision. The projector was on, but the film was clearly over as she film reel flipped at the end as it kept spinning. Elise turned off the projector and looked around in the dark, she walked to the backdoors and gave the knobs a jiggle, only to find that they were locked. She swallowed hard as she began to slowly back out of the office, making sure nothing or nobody was going to come out and alarm her when she bumped into something. Elise gasped as she turned around to find the door to the office that she had bumped into and nothing else, she chuckled as she walked out of the office and closed the door behind her. She chuckled as she rubbed her eye, going back to her glass of water when she felt something behind her as she slowly turned around to find a young girl standing in front of her. Elise gasped as the small red headed girl stood in front of her with blank eyes, she dropped her glass of water as she screamed in bloody murder.[Chapter 10] Harold wrapped up Elise's hand in a bandage as they both sat at the dinner table; Elise was holding back tears as she looked away from her father. \"You want to tell me what's going on?\" Harold asked his daughter. Elise sniffled her tears away as she brushed them away with her free hand and sighed \"…dad, this house is haunted.\" She said. Harold looked at Elise closely \"What?\" he asked her. \"Dad, there is something in this house.\" She told him. \"What do you mean 'something'?\" he asked her. Elise sighed \"I can't explain it dad.\" She said. Harold sighed, he finished wrapping up Elise's hand and kissed it \"I am calling your neurologist in the morning,\" he told her, getting up from his seat. \"What? Why?\" Elise asked, standing up from her seat as well. Harold turned to his daughter \"You've been acting so strangely lately...maybe it's the meds.\" He suggested. Elise shook her head \"No. It's not the meds! Dad, I'm serious!\" she proclaimed. \"I am not going to have this conversation with you, Elise!\" Harold said. \"Why not!?\" Elise yelled. \"Because you are not in a sound state of mind!\" Harold proclaimed as he left the kitchen. Elise huffed as she listened to her father climb up the stairs and shutting his bedroom door; Elise took a deep breathe as she held back her tears once again as she gently made her way back upstairs to her bedroom. She didn't know why she was calling him at nearly two in the morning; she could imagine him asleep, with his hand reaching out to his night table to try and find his phone. \" Just hang up. \" She told herself, letting the phone ring one more time. \"Hello?\" she heard on the other end. Elise went silent for a moment as she thought of something to say. \"Hello?\" he asked again, getting rather annoyed. Elise sighed \"I'm sorry…I didn't mean to call you so late.\" She whispered. \"Elise?\" Deputy Olsen asked. \"Yeah.\" She whispered again. \"What's going on?\" he asked. Elise sighed \"Well…I saw Stephanie Oswalt.\" She said. \"In your house?\" he asked. \"Yes.\" She said. Deputy Olsen went silent, Elise began to worry that he had hung up as she pulled her cell phone away from her ear to make sure he was still there. \"I'm really sorry…I just needed to talk to someone.\" She confessed. \"It's alright, Elise.\" He told her. Elise huffed \"No, it's not. I tried to tell my dad that 'something' was in the house and he didn't believe me! He told me that we needed to go see my neurologist because all this was happening because of my meds.\" She said. \"Your meds?\" he asked. Elise nodded \"Yeah. My anti-seizure meds.\" She said. Deputy Olsen yawned into the phone \"Well, you're dad will figure everything out soon enough. Just relax tonight and tomorrow morning we'll get together and figure out WHY Stephanie Oswalt appeared to you.\" He told her. Elise nodded \"Okay.\" She whispered. \"I'll be by in the morning…at around 9.\" He said. Elise smiled \"Alright.\" She said. Deputy Olsen yawned again \"Okay, I'll see you in the morning.\" He said before hanging up his phone. Elise pulled her cell phone away from her ear and hung up her phone as well before she placed it on her night table. She layed in bed for another hour until her clock read 8:30 before she finally got out of bed and prepared for the day. The house was silent as a loud knock came from the front door, Elise hurried downstairs to greet the deputy, who was still waking up with a cup of coffee in his hands. \"Morning.\" He muttered as he entered the house. Elise smirked \"Morning to you too.\" She said as she closed the front door. They both walked into the office where they were both startled by Harold standing in the room, staring at the research on the walls. Both Deputy Olsen and Elise stood in shock at the door as Harold turned to face them \"What's this?\" he asked. Elise froze to her spot, popping her fingers as she tried to find the words to explain everything. \"WHAT IS THIS, ELISE!?\" Harold asked again, his yelling echoed through the room. \"It's research.\" Elise said. Harold looked around the room, examining the walls that were covered with graphic images and notes. \"Research?\" he asked. Elise nodded \"Yes. Dad.\" She said. Harold huffed \"What kind of research are you doing!?\" he asked. \"That thing I was telling you about last night—THIS...this is what I was talking about.\" Elise said. \"Stop being vague, Elise! Tell me what all of this is, and who the hell is that guy?\" he asked, pointing to Deputy Olsen. Elise crossed her arms \"This is Deputy Olsen, he's helping me with the research.\" She said, walking closer to her father. \"…did you know you were buying the house Ellison Oswalt and his family was murdered in?\" Elise asked. Harold was speechless. \"Did you?\" she asked. \"No. I didn't!\" Harold responded. Elise grimaced as she put her hands in her back pockets \"Dad, there is a deity, a God-like spirit, in our house. And he is going to kill us if we can't stop him first.\" She told him. Harold was having a hard time understanding the words that were coming out of his daughters' mouth. \"…what?\" he asked. \"You heard me.\" Elise muttered. Harold's brow furrowed as he looked away from his daughter \"You're talking gibberish, Elise!\" he said. Elise scuffed \"No! I'm not! Dad, there is this deity named Bughuul and he eats the soul of children and kills their families. Dad, you have to believe me.\" She said, beginning to stand her ground. Harold was silent before he turned back to his daughter \"And how does 'Deputy Olsen' work into all of this?\" he asked. \"…dad, he knew Ellison. All this stuff is his. All these notes and pictures…they all belonged to Ellison; he was trying to figure out what was going with all these families with the same M.O, and when he found out what it was, it was too late!\" Elise explained to her father. Harold was still silent, almost speechless as he looked around the room once again. \"You believe me, don't you?\" Elise asked. Harold looked at his daughter with his dark brown eyes \"…I don't know…\" he told her. Elise began to tear up, covering her face from the world in her hair when Deputy Olsen came to Elise's aid and took her arm \"Show him the films.\" He suggested. \"The films?\" Harold asked. Elise looked up at her father \"Yeah. The films.\"[Chapter 11] Elise and Deputy Olsen turned away while Harold watched every film in the box; he was stunned as he watched families being destroyed. When the last film ended, Harold turned to Elise; still in shock as he remained silence for a few moments before he finally opened his mouth. \"Where did you find these? He asked. \"In the attic.\" Elise told him. Harold nodded as he slowly stood up from his chair \"…Ellison Oswalt…\" he muttered. \"Ellison was the first film.\" Elise told him. Harold covered his mouth as he looked at his daughter \"What's happening?\" he asked. Elise and Deputy Olsen turned to each other before Elise turned back to her father \"There is a Pagan deity by the name of Bughuul who is 'attached' to our house. He feeds on the souls of young children and kills their families…if we leave the house, we die.\" Harold stared at his daughter \"So we just put up with it?\" he asked. Elise was stuck in her thoughts, trying to put a sentence together \"Well, we don't know. Ellison was on to something, but he died before he could really figure anything out.\" She told him. Harold began to pace the office \"Have you tried contacting an exorcist?\" he asked. \"Dad, an exorcist can't help us.\" Elise told him. \"Then what are we going to do?\" Harold asked. Elise shrugged her shoulders \"I don't know. The guy whom I thought was going to help us couldn't…or wouldn't more like it.\" \"Why not?\" Harold asked. Elise shrugged her shoulders again \"Because he pussed out. He helped Ellison, but he won't help me!\" she said, tears threatening to spill from her eyes. \"Helped Ellison?\" Elise nodded \"He's a professor at the university; his specialty is occult and demonic phenomena.\" \"Professor Jonas?\" She nodded \"Yeah, you know him?\" she asked. \"Oh, you bet I do.\" Harold remarked. Elise couldn't stop her father as he stormed into Professor Jonas' office whom was in the middle of teaching a class. \"Can I help you?\" Professor Jonas asked. Harold smirked \"Yes, yes you can! You know my daughter, Elise Hannity?\" he asked. Professor Jonas saw Elise hiding behind her father; he began to choke up as he looked at his students who were glaring at him with confusion. \"…I think that's a good ending point for today's class. See you all on Wednesday.\" He said, pushing together his papers and books as his students left the auditorium until there was just him, Harold, and Elise. Harold stood a very hard stance as he looked at the professor in front of him \"My name is Harold Hannity…I work here, in the History department. You know my daughter, Elise, because she came to you for help, help that you refused to give her!\" he said. Professor Jonas took his glasses off \"Mr. Hannity, I cannot help you or your daughter.\" He told him. \"Bull shit!\" Harold hissed, walking closer to the professor \"You research intensively for hours and hours…weeks…months…years! Books beyond books about these things, and you can't help us? I think you're just a cold person.\" He said. Elise crossed her arms as she looked at Professor Jonas who looked at the both of them \"…I really don't know how.\" He said. \"How is that possible?\" Elise asked. Professor Jonas sighed \"…deities are myths…there is no real proof to suggest that they live among us…after Mr. Oswalt started hinting that Bughuul was real…I looked into it, but nothing…I couldn't find a damn thing.\" He told them. Harold threw his hands in the air \"So we're going to die? Regardless if you're going to help us or not.\" He proclaimed. Professor Jonas shrugged \"Just because I can't find something, doesn't mean it's not there.\" He said. Elise sighed \"Dad, lets go.\" She suggested. Harold glared at Professor Jonas while Elise tugged at his arm to leave the room; he finally gave up as he escorted Elise out of the office. Elise sat at the desk in the office while her father obsessively looked over every note and picture that was on the wall. She thought about what Professor Jonas had said, maybe it was all in her hands, and maybe it was easier than she thought. Or was it? She was lost in thought when the door bell rang, alerting her to her feet before she hastily walked to the door to answer it; Harold wasn't far behind. Elise opened the door wide as Deputy Olsen stood out in the porch then entered the house while both Elise and Harold took a step back. \"So, anything new?\" he asked. Elise shook her head \"No, unfortunately. Dad has been obsessing over the notes but can't find anything useful.\" She said. Harold huffed \"There are thousands and thousands of tiny post-it notes that I have yet to read!\" he said, defending himself. Deputy Olsen smiled while Elise opened her mouth to say something when the power in the house went out. There was complete and utter silence. Harold opened the front door and looked at the neighbors house to find that their lights were all still on \"That's weird.\" He said, closing the door. \"Neighbors lights are on.\" He said, going back to Deputy Olsen and Elise. They turned to each other as Deputy Olsen pulled his flash light out and turned it on, giving some light into the pitch black house. \"I'm gonna go into the kitchen and find another light…or maybe a candle.\" Elise said, feeling her way into the kitchen. Deputy Olsen and Harold stared at each other for a minute \"It's probably a circuit issue.\" Harold said, trying to comfort himself. \"Yes, sir. That's probably it.\" Deputy Olsen said, now following Elise into the kitchen to help her find more light. Harold stayed behind in the entrance before finally making his way into the kitchen where Elise found a small flash light and candle sticks. \"Great…now we need matches.\" Harold said. Elise nodded, looking around and trying to remember where the matches were when a loud crash came from the living room.[Chapter 12] The three of them walked into the foyer, staying close to each other as they glared out into the rest of the house. A creak in the wood alarmed Deputy Olsen as he pulled out his gun and aimed it out into the dark. \"That's not going to help you.\" Elise muttered. \"It makes me feel better.\" He retorted. Footsteps began to come from the living room, Elise managed to turn her flashlight on, only to see a cloud of darkness. Harold guided his daughter a few steps back as the footsteps began to get stronger before they suddenly stopped. Elise waited a moment when something slid across the floor and stopped at her feet, she handed the flashlight to her father as she picked up the 8mm tin case. She opened the case to find it empty. Harold looked at Elise \"What does this mean?\" he asked. Elise looked out into the darkness \"Over my dead body.\" She said, dropping the case and slowly walking out of the foyer and towards the living room. \"Elise!\" Harold protested. \"Dad, this fight is mine.\" She said, walking up to the darkness, trying to see something beyond the darkness when something grabbed her and pulled her into the darkness. Harold cried out, beginning to run towards the darkness while Deputy Olsen held him back \"He wins if you both die, she'll be fine!\" he proclaimed. The sounds of crashing and screamed were all they could hear as Harold looked out in fear while Deputy Olsen aimed his gun into the darkness \"Just wait, she's got this!\" he assured Harold. The lights turned back on the house and Elise sat on the floor, her hair a mess and her clothes torn as she huffed and puffed. \"Elise!\" Harold called out as he rushed to his daughter side. Elise looked down to see her hand grasping cloth as she let it go to see a piece of Bughuul's suit; she let it fall to the floor as Harold slowly picked her up. \"Are you alright?\" Deputy Olsen asked as he walked towards the both of them. Elise was dumbstruck as Harold guided her to the couch and sat her down, Deputy Olsen and Harold both waited for Elise to say something. \"Sweetie?\" Harold asked. Elise turned to her father \"…we have to end this.\" She said. \"I know.\" Harold said. Elise shook her head \"No, we have to end this now!\" she said, beginning to choke up on tears. Deputy Olsen handed a tissue from the box on the living table to Elise as she took it and began to brush away forming tears. Harold held his daughters' hand when the sound of Deputy Olsens' radio began to sound off a crime in progress. Deputy Olsen stood awkwardly as Elise looked up to him \"You should go.\" She said softly. He simply nodded as he began to walk backwards then towards the door as he left to take care of his business. Harold sighed as he rubbed his eyes \"Elise,\" he said \"What do we do?\" he asked. Elise shrugged \"I don't know…\" she said. They sat in the back yard, using their outdoor fireplace as they made s'mores in silence. Elise adjusted herself and her blanket in her chair as she burnt her marshmallow, she was thinking of a way to end all of this as she looked into the flames of the pit. \"Elise?\" Harold asked. She continued to look into the flame as the wheels in her head were starting to turn; her father continued to call out for her when she finally turned to him. \"We have to burn down the house.\" Elise said. Harold cocked an eye brow \"What?\" \"He's connected to the house…no house, no Bughuul.\" Elise said softly. Harold shook his head \"No, it can't be that simple.\" He retorted. Elise huffed \"Dad, we have to do something !\" \"…we'd have to make it look like an accident.\" Harold said, sitting back in his chair. Elise nodded \"Yeah…\" she said, throwing her stick with the burnt marshmallow into the pit before standing up. She looked at the house before she looked back to the pit, then at the house again as she smirked. Harold looked at his daughter \"…I take it you have a plan?\" \"…is there anything vitally important in the house you need?\" \"Everything in that house is replaceable…except for you.\" Harold told her. Elise nodded \"Okay, then.\" She said, picking up a large dying leaf off the ground and caught it on fire. She hurried to the house before it could burn her fingers and adjusted the leaf into the paneling of the house; it didn't take long for the paneling to succumb to the flames while Harold and Elise sat at the pit and felt the warmth on their backs. They had waited awhile before calling the fire department; they wanted to make sure the house couldn't be salvaged before taking action. Elise and Harold had moved to the front yard as the fire department attempted to put out the fire while the police were speaking to the both of them. \"I'm sorry, I'm just trying to comprehend what could have caused this!\" Elise said, putting on a good show for the office. The office nodded \"It's alright, ma'am.\" He said. Elise sighed as she shook her head \"…I went to bed after midnight…I was,\" she gasped as she looked at her father \"…the pit! Oh my god! I was outside making s'mores, and I went back inside to get more marshmallows, but I got a call on my cell phone.\" She said, not covering her mouth. \"How long were you on the phone?\" the officer asked. Elise shrugged \"Long enough to forget about the pit apparently.\" The officer nodded \"Alright, well we'll figure it out once this is all said and done.\" He said before walking away. Harold smirked \"You should have gone to drama school.\" He said with a chuckle. Elise sighed \"Maybe.\" Deputy Olsen pulled up to the house and stared up at the flames before making his way to Elise and Harold. \"What happened?\" he asked. \"What had to be done.\" Elise remarked. The fire had been deemed an accident after they had found the leaf in the paneling; Elise and Harold had moved into a new house a block away and were enjoying the peace and quiet. Elise was enjoying the new furniture as well as the new scenery as she propped her feet up on the coffee table. \"Feet off the table, Elise!\" Harold remarked as he sat next to his daughter to watch T.V. Elise put her feet down and crossed her legs as she watched the show in silence; Harold took a bite of popcorn. \"Deputy Olsen stopped by while you were out,\" Harold said. Elise turned to her father \"Oh yeah?\" \"Yeah…wanted to know if you would want to go out to dinner sometime…\" Harold remarked. Elise smirked \"Maybe.\" \"Tell him that.\" Harold remarked. Elise let a smile escape her lips \"I will.\" They both felt secure, the father and daughter could feel that the mess of three months ago was over as their paranoia left their bodies. This was truly their new beginning. The End. Thanks for reading...I'm SUPER sorry this chapter is random yet quick and kind of slaps you in the face.

Hugs, -st0rmy ((And if doing this isn't a \"thing\" let me know and I'll just add on to the original?)) She woke up cradled in his arms. Something wasn't right. Mind still foggy, she looked up at him, trying to focus her eyes. \"Bughuul?\" she asked, voice slightly hoarse. \"What's...happening?\" \"I'm sorry,\" she heard his rich, soothing voice murmur in her mind. \"You won't really remember this,\" he said quietly, smoothing her hair. She didn't know why she felt this way. She didn't know why he sounded so upset. She didn't know if this was even real. \"Don't leave,\" she pleaded, weakly stretching her hand to his. \"I don't feel well.\" He grasped her hand, slowly stroking it with his thumb. She was ice cold. \"Ensley... in order for you to become immortal, I have to absorb your death.\" Syl nodded weakly. \"But in order for me to absorb your death,\" he hesitated, squeezing her hand gently and letting out an almost shuddering breath. \"You have to die.\" The voice in her mind became a barely-audible whisper. \"Which means I have to-\" \"Kill me,\" she finished. She didn't know how she knew, she just knew she didn't want him to have to say it out loud. \"I'm so sorry.\" His telepathic voice broke as he gently caressed her face. \"But, I'll be alive again, right?\" Syl asked. Part of her didn't fully realize what she had just heard, but the rest of her was willing to go through with it. \"Of course,\" he replied. \"Of course. But I didn't tell you that until now. I-\" \"Hey,\" Syl interrupted. \"Whatever it takes. I still want you. I want to be with you always.\" Her body shook with a chill. \"I promised I would be your guardian. I don't want to do this to you.\" \"You're still protecting me. I trust you. I'd rather die by your hands and get to be with you for eternity than die alone by my own hands.\" That would have been her eventual fate. He sighed deeply at her comment. \"You won't leave?\" \"No, I will not leave you. I promise you.\" \"When this is done, you'll be here?\" she confirmed. He nodded, slowly running his fingers across her face. She was getting progressively colder. Her eyes were getting blearier. She reached her hand up to him, letting it rest on his face and neck. \"Don't leave me.\" Those were her last words as a mortal human. She would die, he would absorb the death, and she would be alive again. Her death - the only darkness she had - would give both him and his realm an immense amount of power. He would not have to require a sacrifice for a while, giving her plenty of time to adjust to her new life before subjecting her to one of the rituals. Her death would become a part of him; it would become part of his realm. It was dark and cold. It felt like she was underwater, but she was dry. She could breathe. Sounds resonated around her, but she didn't heed them. She kept walking, the ground a liquid metal under her feet. It was like a tunnel, and there was a break in the darkness up ahead. There was a large rectangular spot of light. She focused on the light, though she thought she would be safer in the tunnel itself. She kept walking towards it, but it kept getting farther away. He went to her periodically, but he never stayed long. He would talk to her while smoothing her hair. He'd let some kids in at times. Every time he left, he felt he should go back. He promised to keep her safe, to watch over her, did he not? But she was safe. He knew she had made her decision without much thought, he knew it was impulsive but sincere. He knew more than she did, but failed to tell her. She knew enough, but not everything. For one, immortality itself would be a huge adjustment. But now she would be surrounded by darkness, though she would adjust. She would never be able to go back to her normal, mortal life. She could feel trapped, if not now, then a few weeks. Days. Months. Years. Centuries. An endless life, that he would do everything in his power to make better than her old life. Her future, her happiness, her life, all would rest in his hands. The promise to protect her was relatively easy when she had control over her life and her surroundings. But his promise now leaned more towards giving her a good, happy life, without cares, without heartache, without being alone. He laid his forehead on hers and uttered an apology, hoping she would hear. Syl kept hearing voices. For a while, she heard her name being spoken. She thought she heard him, but he wasn't ever there. She heard other, younger voices at times, but didn't look in their direction. She thought she felt him, but she was alone. She would feel pain from deep inside, sometimes. It made her want to call out for him, but she knew he wouldn't hear. She wanted nothing more than to be with him in his arms. But why wasn't he there? Why couldn't she get out? The light ahead periodically flickered, making the nonexistent waves rush around her. The light went out. The apartment was as still as night. On her bed laid Syl's phone, which rang nearly constantly. The vibrations were the only sound in the whole building, it seemed. The phone died. Mason knew it was futile. He knew there was no way Syl would pick up. He knew she was gone. Even so, he dragged his thumb down his screen, searching through his contacts. He scrolled back up when Nat's name caught his eye. She answered sounding groggier than a usual morning. \"Who's this?\" \"Natty, where's Syl?\" \"Huh?\" \"It's Mason. Where's my sister?\" \"Oh, sorry, Mase.\" Nat cleared her throat. \"What? I haven't been home in a few days.\" \"When did you hear from her last?\" Mason asked, trying not to sound as impatient as he was feeling. \"A few days ago, when I left, why?\" Mason held his phone away from him, squeezing it and gritting his teeth. He slowly put it back to his ear. \"I need you to pick me up at the airport this evening. I'll call you when I have the flight info. Understood?\" \"Uh, yeah. Yeah, sure,\" Nat replied. \"What's going on, Mason? Where's Syl?\" \"I can't explain right now, just don't worry about it, ok? Just be at the airport when I tell you.\" \"Of course.\" Mason hung up. \"Damn it!\" He slammed his phone down hard enough to crack the screen. Taylor walked in then, having heard some of the conversation and his outburst. \"Mason...\" \"I need to go tonight.\"[Chapter 2] \"What's the matter?\" Taylor asked, eyes filling with concern. \"I don't know!\" Mason yelled. \"I don't know. I mean, I do, but I don't. Syl- she. I don't know.\" He brushed past her and ran up the stairs, taking up three in one stride. She heard him bustling around their room and followed him. \"Mason, is she alright?\" \"Look,\" Mason paused from his packing and looked his wife straight in the eye. \"Someone from her...our past, I think, has come back. And I think she's with him. But you know something? He is definitely the kind that would hurt-beyond hurt-her. Based on her phonecall, it's either that, or she committed suicide.\" His eyes brimmed with hot tears. \"I don't know which is worse,\" he whispered. He turned away from Taylor with a heavy breath and stuffed more into his bag. Taylor bit her lip. \"Who?\" \"You remember those murders I told you we were obsessed about.\" Taylor sighed deeply, slightly rolling her eyes. \"The ones you said were about the boogeyman and stuff, yes. But we've long since gotten over believing in that, haven't we?\" \"I don't know!\" Mason paced back and forth several times before reaching into a drawer to get more things. \"What do you mean? Is he real or not?\" \"Yes, Taylor.\" Mason stopped and looked her dead in the eyes. \"I was so worried about our son, that I blocked it all out. All my childhood stupidity with Syl. All gone. But he is real. He is real and he took my sister.\" \"I understand. Like why start a family, then, if we're all gonna die,\" Taylor replied quietly. She was on the fence, too. She believed, in a way, only because she trusted Mason. She didn't think he was insane, and she knew he had his doubts. If this was real, why would anyone want kids? \"Exactly. But for now, we aren't in any danger. Syl is.\" \"What did she say on the phone?\" \"She apologized, she said... I don't know. She's with him, that's all I know. Like she 'owes him' or something. I told you she said she saw him once when we were kids, and then regularly in her dreams. So she saw him again and she's gone.\" \"Is he real? Is he really real?\" Taylor asked. Syl had said so herself that she didn't know if maybe she had imagined him. All kids have imaginary friends. \"Yes.\" Gently taking Mason's hands, Taylor asked, \"Alright. So, what are you going to do?\" \"Get her back.\" He crouched down beside the night stand and pulled open the bottom drawer. After moving some things, he pulled out a flash drive. It had absolutely every piece of information he had about the murders and everyone involved. He shoved it into a deep zippered pocket in his laptop bag. Mason finished up quietly, not realizing Taylor had left until she returned. \"Your flight's in two hours. The best they had.\" He smiled. \"Thank you,\" he whispered, planting a firm kiss on her lips. \"You two stay out of trouble while I'm gone.\" Mason glanced down at his wife's stomach and laid his hand on her, trying to lighten up. He had to stay strong for them. Stay strong for Syl. \"We'll try,\" Taylor said with a small grin. \"Please, keep in contact.\" She squeezed his hand urgently. Mason nodded soberly. \"I love you.\" \"Love you, too. Stay safe,\" Taylor urged, following him to the door. He waved with a slight smile, which she returned, and shut the door behind him. Mason called Natalie and told her when he expected her to pick him up. He scrolled through his contacts again, the pit of his stomach roiling. A name kept being tossed back and forth in his mind. Dr. Stomberg. The only person on the face of this planet that would be of any help. Mason shoved that aside. He hated to admit it, but he kept thinking that Syl not being alive would be better than whatever would happen to her in \"the boogeyman's\" realm. So go to her place, expecting her to be dead somewhere. How could he think such things? Because otherwise, he would have to face a harsher reality. He couldn't do that. \"Hey,\" Stephanie whispered. She gently nudged Syl. \"Psssst, wake up! Syl!\" Stephanie's final yelp jolted Syl's eyes open. Syl looked around the room, which was a warm, rich color, but the structure of the room and everything in it was unlike anything she had ever seen. It was beautiful, ancient and mystical. Almost scary, but she felt comfortable. Syl looked back at the little girl who was bouncing up and down on her bed. She looked so familiar. Stephanie looked over her shoulder and exclaimed, \"Daddy was right. She is really pretty!\" Other voices replied in agreement. Stephanie turned back to Syl, beaming. \"You're really pretty,\" she repeated. Syl blinked slowly, slowly easing herself up and cocking her head. \"Thanks?\" was all she could muster. \"Where am I?\" \"Home,\" Stephanie replied. \"But what is- never mind. What's your name?\" Syl asked. \"Stephanie.\" She pointed behind her. \"And that's Ashley, and that's Ben. And then there's a lot more.\" Stephanie was prepared to start listing as many as she could, but she remembered something about overwhelming, and stopped. \"Stephanie...\" Syl repeated. \"You look like someone I knew about, named Stephanie.\" Syl scrutinized the child, though her eyes were still bleary. \"You really do.\" Stephanie looked thrilled. \"That's because I am!\" she chirped. \"Stephanie Stevenson. You know about me and them, too. Remember?\" Syl's eyes widened as she held the bunched-up blanket close to her. \"You're Stephanie Stevenson... the one who... hung her family... and that's the Ashley ...Oswalt... and he's the-\" \"I drowned my family!\" Ben announced proudly. \"And your 'daddy' would be...?\" \"Bughuul, of course,\" said Ben with a cheeky grin. The mere mention of his name comforted her. Where was he? Why was she alone? \"Right. So... so, this is... real, and I'm really here, and you're really here?\" She was asking herself more than anything. \"Yep!\" exclaimed Stephanie, bouncing slightly. Clearly, she had no concept of this being a lot for Syl to take in. Of course her adjustment period would be as short and simple as theirs were. Why wouldn't it be? Syl sighed, holding her hands over her eyes. \"We're so glad you're here,\" Ashley gushed. Ashley was cut short with a sudden gasp when she noticed Bughuul, and it felt as though an ominous cloud traveled over her and her siblings. Syl felt his presence too, with that same little chill, but not one of fear. There he was, standing regal and imposing between two of the marbled pillars. He watched with slight amusement the wide-eyed children realize their mistake. Servants, yes, but they're still young children. So of course nothing he had told them beforehand was obeyed. The children lightly stepped toward him with an eerie sort of grace, eyes lowered submissively. He sighed with disappointment while they walked around him, running off and fading into the darkness beyond. To those who've given this attention, THANK YOU! -st0rmy[Chapter 3] \"So what's this about?\" Natalie asked as she opened the car door for Mason. He shoved his bag into the back seat and slammed the door. \"I don't know. Thank you for coming.\" \"Of course!\" Natalie replied. \"Are we going to my place?\" she asked as she rounded the front of the car to get back in. Mason breathed sharply out his nose. \"I think that's a good place to start, yes. Have you been back there?\" \"No, I'm sorry. I haven't.\" Mason shook his head and buried it in his hands. \"Has she been acting weird? What happened the last time you saw her?\" Natalie shrugged. \"Regular chit-chat. She was watching something on her computer and I asked her if she wanted some food or something when I was out.\" Mason perked up. \"Wait, what was she watching?\" Natalie flipped off someone who cut right in front of her before apologizing to Mason. She replied, \"I dunno. She said it was a home movie or something, I don't remember for sure.\" Home movie... That sounded all too familiar. Mason gazed out the window in silence for several minutes. His thoughts were interrupted when Natalie told him they were almost there. He creaked his neck and sighed deeply, trying to soothe the roiling in his stomach. The few minutes it took to get from the parking garage and their apartment felt like hours to Mason. He could literally vomit at that moment, but he knew he could not let himself. Natalie looked at him with concern and touched his arm supportively before opening up the door. The place looked like it had been vacant for years, not just a couple days. It was eerily still and quiet. Cautiously, they both stepped in. \"Ensley?\" Mason called out softly. Not a single sound. He set his bag down by the door and ventured in further, after looking to Natalie for permission. She shut the door behind them as he began to walk around the main level. The kitchen. There was a plate on the table, food barely touched. The chair was pushed back. \"This was hers, right?\" Mason asked softly. Natalie nodded. This wasn't suicide. This was an abduction. He turned sharply and headed to the stairs. He ran to the top and stopped suddenly, stumbling forward slightly before catching himself. Bughuul's symbol had been burned into the floor. Mason shook his head and looked again, blinking hard. \"Natty!\" he called. She rushed up the stairs. \"Is that really there?\" \"What the fuck is that?\" How would he explain any of this to her? \"I don't know how to explain it. I need to make a call right now.\" He tried to push past her, but she held him back. \"Mason, wait. What happened to Syl? What is that, and why do you look like you know a hell of a lot more than what you're telling me?\" So I'm pretty sure the boogeyman kidnapped my sister. Gee, that would go over real well . \"If I tell you someone from our past has come back and took her away, would that be enough of an explanation?\" \"Yes. If you tell me who and why.\" He eyed her. Stubborn little thing. He sighed. \"Where's her computer?\" Mason asked. Maybe if she had visual proof, she wouldn't think he was insane. \"She was using it on the couch when I left. What does this-\" Mason pushed past Natalie and ran down the stairs. He opened the laptop and waited impatiently for it to boot up. \"Find her phone and plug it in. Please.\" Natalie did so as Mason typed in his best guess for Syl's PIN. It worked. Perks of having the connection of twins, despite being five years apart. He began searching through all her files. She didn't have much on her computer, and he was grateful for that. But then he found the clip. He wasted no time in playing it. The silent, jittery film of their family. Back when they were a family. Now, it seems, he's the only one left. He stared at the video intently, shuddering at the sight of a young Syl, sobbing into their mom. Then, Mason saw an all-too-familiar face. How cool this would have been to him when he was a child. But now, it filled him with nothing but hatred. \"Nat, come here, now.\" Natalie rushed over and sat beside him on the couch. \"You want your explanation?\" He placed the computer in her lap and pressed Play. \"Who filmed this?\" she asked at the shot of the whole family. Mason shrugged. Probably one of the ghost kids, but she didn't need that information. Natalie smiled slightly at their family life. She had heard plenty of stories from the happier times in her roommate's life. It was short-lived, when the video cut to dark, the screaming child, then Bughuul. Once the video ended, she skipped back a few frames. Natalie looked almost horrified. \"Who is that?\" she asked, wide-eyed. \"That, I think, is what took her. If I go into much detail, you will think I'm out of my damn mind. But he's got her. I don't know if she's alive or what. I don't know, Nat!\" \"I'm sorry, Mason.\" Natalie was incredibly concerned and confused. \"I don't know what to say. Is there anything I can do?\" She suddenly felt responsible in a way, too. If she had forced Syl to go with her, or if she had just stayed in for once in her life, maybe this could have been prevented. Or at least she could be more of a help to Mason. Either way, she felt guilty. \"Ride back to the airport after I make a call.\" His voice was emotionless. Natalie nodded fervently. He stopped by the kitchen again, turning on Syl's phone before stepping out the door. Mason paced, trying to control his shaky hands as he dialed. After a few rings, a female voice answered the phone. \"Hello?\" \"I'm sorry, do I have the wrong number? I'm looking for a Dr. Stomberg?\" \"You've got the right number. What can I do for you?\" \"Is he available?\" Mason asked, hoping he didn't sound too impatient. \"I'm sorry,\" she said apologetically. \"He's in the middle of teaching a class right now.\" \"Is there any way I can arrange a meeting? This is really important, and I don't want to say anything over the phone.\" \"Oh...\" This wasn't something academic. \"Yes. Definitely. Can I get your name?\" \"Mason Harper. I've got your address and everything. When is a good time?\" \"He's got classes all day today, is tomorrow fine or did you want to meet up tonight?\" Mason sighed. \"Tomorrow, I guess. I'm out of state.\" \"Alright. Just give us a call when you're in town.\" \"Will do. Thanks.\" He hung up and walked back in, slamming the door behind him. He went to the kitchen to check Syl's phone. He dropped it immediately, but then picked it back up, hot tears of anger, sorrow, and confusion welling in his eyes. The lock screen. His sister looking up at Bughuul. \"I need to go.\"[Chapter 4] He stopped a step beyond the entrance, gauging whether or not he should go on. Syl felt his familiar presence, not having felt it since she was in earth's dimension. It was stronger now. Closer. Safer. It was the only thing she knew. The only stability in her new immortal life was him, her guardian. He stood there silently, watching, waiting, almost nervous. Syl slowly got off the bed, letting her feet feel the shimmering floor beneath them. She took a few tentative steps, breathing deeply in attempt to calm her nerves. Her eyes fell to the ground, and she felt her heart beating hard against her chest. She barely heard him as he took a couple slow, smooth steps, closing the distance between them. But she knew he stopped. Syl felt a chill run down her spine. Part of her felt like she was still in her dream. Part of her thought she was imagining it all, hallucinating, something. But it felt too real. Slowly, she went to him, closing the distance between them. If this is all real, so is he . She stood closely in front of him, her short, rapid breathing noticeable. She willed herself to calm down, but to no avail. He sensed her fear, but he wouldn't get into her thoughts, though he wanted to. Not yet. If and when, that would only ever be her choice. She ran her hand gently down his chest, and finally looked up at him. \"You're still real?\" she asked, nervously. Breathlessly. He pressed her hand against himself and responded, \"Yes. I am.\" The sound of his velvety-smooth voice in her mind soothed her even more than the answer itself. It was the same as when they were reunited before she came with him, but she wasn't afraid of him now. There was no doubt, no hesitation. This was pure. It was surreal. She lifted her hand shakily to his face, softly stroking his cheek with her thumb. Gradually, she became mesmerized by him again, but more so. Trying to fight away the fear with the fact that he was hers now. How he chose her, of all people in any point in time, to be his. How this majestic, powerful deity wanted to be with her for eternity. But me, of all people... He sensed her sudden doubt, though he was no stranger to her historically-doubtful mind. Years of being betrayed one way or another had made her lose a level of trust. He cupped her face in his hands as his voice filled her mind with a warm sense of comfort. \"Nothing has changed, Syl.\" She let her hand softly fall back onto his chest and she leaned into him, soon feeling his arms envelop her trembling body. He held her until she was calm, but as soon she felt him start to move back, she wrapped her arms tightly around him, pleading, \"No, please. Don't leave me.\" \"I'm not going anywhere.\" She nestled deeper into him, focusing on his warmth more than her fear. She knew he felt it, and she didn't want him to. \"I'm sorry,\" she whispered. \"Why?\" \"I trust you, you know I do. I'm just ...afraid.\" She was sure she wasn't afraid of him. She herself barely knew what she was afraid of. And there was that nagging sensation in the back of her mind about \"betraying\" her brother. She didn't want to think about her past life. Not now. Not in the arms of her guardian. He rested his head on her, holding her close. \"You have no reason to apologize. I know you trust me, I know you are afraid. I would not expect you to act as if this is not entirely different from your previous life.\" \"Still. You deserve better. You don't deserve my fear.\" \"Ensley,\" he said, voice a beautiful, smooth murmur in her mind. \"You left your world for me. You let me bring you to my realm. After these millennia of waiting, you are finally with me.\" He tilted her chin up, shifting her gaze to his dark empty eyes. \"What I don't deserve is you .\" She smiled softly, beholding him in wonderment. \"Thank you for choosing me,\" she said after a pause, her voice just above a whisper. He caressed her cheek, brushing his thumb over her mouth. \"I hope you're happy here, Ensley.\" Ever since he first found her, she had become the light in his darkness. He was dark, evil, and corrupt. They both knew it. He had always prided himself in the fact he consumes the souls of innocent children. He loved their artistic offerings depicting their families' murders. The more blood, the more murders, the more satisfaction. That would never change. But despite all the sacrifices, all the portals, all the children, all the darkness, he felt empty. He felt alone. It was an endless loop, it seemed, always people to watch, children to gather, sacrifices to receive, souls to consume. He didn't mind the cycle in the slightest. But whatever part of him that craved companionship would not stop until he had found it. Until he had found her , after thousands of years. Syl was a good human, by their standards. But he saw deeper into her, he knew she was what he needed. She had always been innocent, kind-hearted, and strong. He thought about using her or her brother for sacrifices, especially with their obsession, it would be easy. But whatever it was, foresight perhaps, stopped him. She was the first child he protected instead of corrupted. The first adolescent he comforted instead of tormented. The first adult he guarded instead of killed. The first human he loved instead of despised.[Chapter 5] Wow thank you guys sososo much for the kind words! You're amazing. Loves, -St0rmy She sat at the foot of the bed, her head resting against his chest as he held her. She felt his fingers delicately running through her hair, lingering at the ends and twisting the strands. Part fear, part exhaustion from her sort of death, caused her mind to zone off as he talked, telling her past stories, of sacrifices and the like, as she'd requested. She willed herself to pay attention, she wanted to know, but it was too hard to focus. No matter how gory and horrific, he had a way of making it sound appealing, his voice, his choice of words. It was enchanting, definitely. It must not be that difficult to gather children, she thought, based on that alone. She sat in silence listening to him for quite a while, blanketed in the warmth of his soothing touch and voice. She perked up suddenly, as Bughuul's stories began transitioning to more specifically that of her and Mason, when they first became obsessed with the Oswalt murder and such. He told her about how they were almost amusing, then almost concerning. He started talking about her specifically, how he decided to protect her. How he had watched her grow up, but that was challenging in and of itself, since she gradually became indifferent to the supernatural versus not, aspect of the murders. He told her how he was able to actually get into her dreams, and that they were partly so she wouldn't forget, but mostly because that was the only way he could comfort her \"in person\". The dreams never let up once her life started going downhill at sixteen. He talked about how he changed up his realm for her, and how long the wait was, though two decades should be nothing to him. He told her about the day he finally chose to manifest to her again, the day he asked her to be his, to take her pain away. \"Tell me,\" Syl said at length, sitting up to face him. \"What was going through your mind when you showed yourself to me again, after all those years?\" He paused momentarily before answering, \"Truthfully, I was nervous. And your behavior at first made me rethink my decision.\" \"In my defense, I was slightly drunk...\" Syl interjected, smiling. \"I know. Your reaction was understandable, considering you had no warning.\" \"If I had known, then I wouldn't-\" He silenced her, placing his finger lightly over her mouth. \"Ensley,\" His voice in her mind was sincere yet alluring. \"Getting to see you, not in dreams, not from a distance; getting to touch you and hold you, in person ...indescribable. Still, that paled in comparison to hearing your acceptance, knowing that you would be mine and my wait was over.\" \"Why did you wait so long for me?\" Syl murmured. \"Why didn't you get me earlier?\" \"I wanted to see if your life got better. If I had gotten you sooner, I could have ripped you away from a life far greater than what I can provide.\" \"Impossible,\" Syl declared. \"There is absolutely nothing that compares to you.\" \"Syl,\" he said solemnly. \"You know who I am...\" He knew she was a good person, pure and full of light. Some part of him felt she should be less accepting. Less approving. And at the same time, he desired her approval. But maybe with conditions. \"Yes,\" she replied slowly, a small wry smile spreading across her lips. \"I've always felt that way about you. You aren't the same with me as you are with any other human, and that is what makes you so incredible.\" She held his face in her hands, meeting his gaze as she assured, \"I know who you are, I know what you do, but my opinion of you will never change, ok?\" He nodded silently and sighed deeply. \"Hey,\" Syl said, taking his hands and standing up. She glanced at the darkness looming beyond the room. \"I would love for you to show me more of your realm. Can we?\" Knowing that seeing his realm would set in stone the fact she was there forever was more intimidating than not. Not in a bad way, though. He didn't expect her to acclimate right away, and she knew that. But she had no reason to be afraid. She knew Bughuul would always be there. \"Of course.\" His realm had always been a source of pride, more evil and more mysterious and more beautiful than any had suspected. However, anyone who had had the pleasure of seeing it, both his child servants and the few adults, were too busy being afraid or otherwise harmed to appreciate it. He never cared, really, but to finally have someone able to admire it was appreciated. But the fact that said person was Syl made it even more important to him that it be beyond perfect. She deserved nothing less. She followed him, standing between two of the pillars, and exhaled nervously. \"You're alright.\" He wrapped his arm around her waist, further assuring her of her safety. Syl smiled softly and gave a slight nod. As they stepped out of the room, the darkness seemed to fade with a strange glow, like a sunset behind storm clouds. The surrounding area was dark, but seemed dimly lit rather than inky darkness. Around them were outlines of a large building with elaborate, towering pillars and large arches. It was strangely quiet for the moment. The air smelled faintly of incense and campfire smoke. In the distance, in what seemed like a blood red sky, were several strange lights resembling doorways. Trees, or something like them, were scattered throughout, along with large golden flames, like candlelight, seeming to float in midair in their holders. Syl looked around in amazement, taking in her surroundings. They walked some more, and it seemed as though she recognized some of it. \"You remember your dreams?\" he asked as she suddenly stopped. \"I remember all of my dreams of with you,\" she replied, her voice trailing off as she took in with awe what laid ahead. \"Especially this.\" Bughuul's symbol, glowing scarlet, bordered with ever-burning flames, spanned far and wide in all its splendor. It was flat on the ground, but looked three-dimensional. The glowing green poison flowed around the expansive symbol, bordering it like a picture frame. She was nearly hypnotized by his symbol. Pulling her eyes away, she turned back to him. \"The dreams. You've shown me your realm before.\" \"Our realm now,\" he corrected. Syl smiled, tilting her head onto him. \"And yes, I have.\" \"It's beautiful.\" \"You think so?\" He sounded almost surprised. \"Of course,\" she said softly, looking around with childlike fascination, hugging herself closer into him. \"Even more magnificent in person. I love it here, I really do.\" \"I'm glad. This is only a small part, and that doesn't include my dimensions or the other dimensions I will show you.\" \"Your dimensions?\" \"The photos, drawings, films,\" he explained. \"And they're like portals, aren't they?\" She knew a lot about such processes, but the information was still limited or incorrect. The information out there was only a slice of the actuality. There would be so much to learn about him and his realm and how everything works. \"Correct. For example, a photo not only creates a memory, it also creates its own dimension.\" \"No kidding,\" Syl replied, fascinated. \"So only certain entities have the ability to create their own worlds in photos, travel through them, and such. But I, as you know, can only access different media if I or my symbol is included. And now you,\" he said, taking her hand, \"get to join me as well, if you wish.\" \"Show me.\"[Chapter 6] \"Can we please talk about this?\" Natalie asked as she hurried behind Mason to the car. \"I told you,\" Mason said. \"You're going to think I'm insane. Can you hurry?\" He watched as she fumbled with her seatbelt, her lack of control seeming very out of character. Natalie mouthed an apology as she started her car sped off as quickly as she could without getting them both killed. \"Do you know the shit I've seen and done over the years? I saw the video, I saw what was burnt onto the ground, unless this is some sort of hoax, literally nothing else will phase me.\" Mason shook his head slowly. \"Who you saw in the video...\" Natalie glanced at him. \"What about him?\" \"There were all these filmed murders he was involved in, and anyone who knew about the films figured he was a serial killer, but it's not that simple.\" Natalie heard by his frequent hesitation that he wasn't comfortable in explaining anything. \"I've always been interested in other people's business, but now isn't a good time. I'm sorry.\" She was still too confused to worry much about what happened to her roommate. Everything was cryptic and creepy. But she knew whatever happened was affecting Mason deeply. \"I want to tell you, but it's way too complicated for right now. You have a right to know, considering you've been rooming with Syl all these years.\" \"No rush, 'k? Just let me know if there's anything else I can do for you, even after you're home.\" \"Thank you,\" he said softly. \"If I'm ever able to sort things out, or at least come to terms with it, I will explain everything, if you're still interested.\" More silence filled the vehicle, save for the breeze rushing in through cracked windows. As they pulled up to the drop-offs, Natalie squeezed Mason's arm. \"Be careful, Harper.\" \"Always am.\" He got out of the car but poked his head back in. \"Nat?\" \"Hmm?\" \"Thank you for being a great friend to Syl. You were there for her more than I was at times. I don't know what she would have done without you.\" Natalie smiled warmly. \"She's a great kid. And I hope you know she loves you more than life itself. I know you'd do anything for her. Best of luck.\" \"Mason?\" Taylor murmured, still half asleep. As she woke a bit more, she realized she was still alone. She checked the time, a little after four in the morning. He was still gone, but now she couldn't shake off the feeling of unease. Nights like these were when she wished she wasn't allergic, so they could have pets. Another creak made her sit up straight in bed, squinting in the darkness. A faint sound came from the other end of the hallway. A giggle, almost. She grasped her phone with sweaty palms, wondering if she could call 911. \"Taylor!\" came a small whisper. It sounded friendly. Mischievous. Childlike. Another happy giggle rang out, but louder this time. Taylor let out a shuddering sigh and put on her hoodie when she saw movement in the corner of her eye. She flipped on the lamp, and saw nothing. Cautiously, she crept towards the bedroom door and flipped on the hall light. She felt more uneasy now. But it wasn't because she sensed some malevolent force. It was because she knew someone was there, but just couldn't see them. The same reason she hated being \"it\" in childhood hide and seek games. If these sounds were coming from children, odds are it was one giant hide and seek game. She wasn't afraid of them. She wasn't supposed to be. At the moment, they weren't servants sent out to get a new soul, they were simply playful kids who had free time. Right? \"You guys,\" Taylor said with a shaky voice. Why was she talking to ghosts? \"It's a-it's a bit late for games, you know?\" She blamed pregnancy for her lack of sense. Another giggle sounded from right behind her and she turned around, met with the happy but rotting faces of a boy and girl, who looked to be about seven or eight. The little girl waved, flashing a cute smile with a missing front tooth. They dashed downstairs, but when she turned on the light, they were gone. Taylor shook her head and sighed again, purposing to venture all the way down, making sure to turn on every light possible. She gasped suddenly, taken aback at the disaster in front of her. Strewn about the floor were different newspaper clippings, sheets of notebook paper, reports, and several old pictures. The TV was also on, showing reports of a family murder and a missing child from several years ago. Taylor bent down reaching for a newspaper, another story of a missing child. She immediately recognized the child as the little ghost girl in her house. Although unnerved, she tried to keep brave and trudge back up the stairs. Curled in her blanket, she waited a couple hours until she could finally call Mason. She thought about his call from the airport the day before. How broken and exhausted he sounded, even though he was only gone that day. She could almost see him fighting back tears as he told her, as much as he could without being suspicious to potential eavesdroppers, that Bughuul took Syl. His words became muddled as he tried to sort his thoughts. She wanted to be there with him so badly, and she told him so on the phone. \"Twenty years ago I started this, and now I'm going to fix it,\" he had told her, trying to sound confident, but they both knew he had doubts. Mason reached for his phone just as it began to ring. Before he had a chance to answer, he heard Taylor, \"Something happened last night with ...kids and I'm terrified.\" Shaking his head, Mason replied to himself, \"Great. He knows where I am, too.\" \"What?\" \"I'm sorry,\" Mason said. \"Are you alright?\" \"Yes, I'm fine. I just want answers, I guess.\" \"I'm at the hotel, and I'll be meeting with Dr. Stomberg in about an hour. Hopefully he's useful. Right now isn't the best time to discuss your situation, phones and all. I'll let you know how the meeting goes, alright? Love you.\" He hung up quickly, before she had a chance to respond. Blindly he began flipping through Syl's pictures, looking for the one they took together on one Thanksgiving, it was the first visit they had had in a year. He found it after a while, and studied it. How happy they looked. He knew she put on a good face for company, but their closeness made Syl happy for real around her brother. \"A year,\" he muttered to himself. He remembered some excuses he had made on why there couldn't have been another visit in that timeframe. \"If only I knew.\"[Chapter 7] Within a second, they had appeared near the lights which Syl had thought were doors. She was slightly taken aback at the realization that she had just teleported, but her thoughts quickly changed focus when she noticed the \"lights\" up close. The lights appeared to be archway entrances. There were hundreds of these entrances it seemed, but only a few were lit. \"Are these all the portals?\" \"Yes,\" he replied. \"The ones lit are out in the open, the other ones are either hidden away or partially destroyed. With the hidden ones, I can access the dimension, but not use them to watch people. The ones that are partially destroyed take too much energy to access, so I usually avoid them. I will still show you eventually.\" \"You don't have to,\" Syl said with a hint of concern. \"So the light ones, where are they on earth?\" \"Some from this bothersome human who calls himself a 'demonologist', never been worth my time. Your brother keeps accessing your phone, and the others, symbols from old ...houses, and then the rest are tapes or radio recordings.\" So he is looking for me . Syl found herself quickly focusing less on her brother and more on Bughuul's perpetual reluctance to elaborate on anything ritualistic. She couldn't figure out if it was more out of respect or embarrassment or both. \"So, new sacrifice soon, then?\" she asked, sounding as casual as possible. It didn't bother her much. \"Not for a while, but yes. Very promising. Come with me.\" He took her hand again and led her to one of the archways. It was to an archived photo from over a hundred years ago, one of the first actual photographs he was captured in, he told her. She stepped beside him at the front of the entrance, the light a cool mist. Putting his arm protectively around her, he ensured she was ready and they stepped through. Syl held tightly onto him as she felt the sensation of having just woken up as they manifested inside. Looking around, it seemed like a different world, but time, everything, was stopped. Except them. \"Travelling to the different dimensions becomes less difficult over time,\" he told her. \"If you're willing.\" \"Of course,\" Syl whispered, mirroring the eerie stillness of their surroundings. \"What's the story behind this?\" \"Family reunion picnic, in which the child made the final decision in his mind to go through with the sacrifices. I was observing their interactions.\" Syl took a couple tentative steps away, heading towards a woman who was smiling behind her drink. She seemed so real, just frozen in time. Forever recorded in history as such. \"I just have so many questions about these dimensions and time, but I don't know what to ask.\" She sensed him behind her, closing the distance between them. \"Spend enough time traveling through these dimensions with me,\" he said, as she felt his arms envelop her. He leaned his head into hers, promising, \"And it will all make sense in time.\" \"It just seems kind of beyond the realm of human comprehension, though...\" \"Yes, but you are not like them; not then, and especially not now.\" \"Alright. If you say so.\" Syl followed him back to the portal entrance, where they got back to his realm. \"This one is active,\" he told her as he pointed to another entrance. \"Follow me.\" There was a printed-out screenshot of a low-quality recording of one of the films from the mid-2010s. Stomberg foolishly had kept it out in the open. Though the quality was terrible, it was still easy to see out into earth's dimension. It would have to do for now anyway. The only other portals for observation currently active were from the films the newest child would be shown. However, that seemed too much trouble for the given time, despite the occasional pull he felt when he knew the children were watching something with him. \"He won't see me?\" Syl asked before they went in. Bughuul shook his head and she followed him through the portal. \"You saw this film.\" \"It was terrible. Definitely the top few that made me feel sick.\" It was gory, involving a lot of knives and eyes getting gouged out. \"It was one of the bloodier ones they've made me. Understandable, considering your young age when you watched it.\" She immediately felt better. Not that he would take it as an insult necessarily, but she still felt bad. Gesturing ahead, he told her to watch. Unlike the other picture, this one wasn't the same setting all around. The other end of the picture had a view of the other dimension, earth's. A view of someone's office, filled with a lot of evil-looking statues and pictures and such. Syl watched intently and held back a gasp as Dr. Stomberg came into view. \"This is happening now?\" She noticed how frantic Dr. Stomberg was behaving. \"Yes it is. He doesn't know why, but your brother has an appointment with him soon.\" Bughuul didn't want to tell her. For one, it could upset her. Otherwise, he felt he might have to intervene, but listening to their conversation would give him more insight. He barely entertained thoughts of killing them, especially not Mason, but potential physical or mental pain were not out of the picture. For that reason, he wanted to stay silent for her sake. Syl's eyes stayed widened, but she said nothing. As much as she didn't want to think about her brother, her tie to the mortal world, she couldn't help but. \"I'm going to watch their meeting when it happens,\" he told her. Again, he preferred to keep his dealings to himself, especially ones not involving children, but it's different now. \"Ok. Tell me what they say?\" she asked with a hint of uncertainty. He looped his arm around her shoulders, pulling her closer to him. \"Of course I will.\" They observed Stomberg silently for a few minutes longer before he said they should go. \"I enjoyed that,\" Syl told him as they headed away from the entrances. \"I always thought it was cool that you did that, but now, I think it's beyond amazing. No words.\" Her eyes lit up in a way that pulled him to her past for a moment. He remembered the way her eyes lit up as a child, the spark of pure delight and childlike wonder. But when she saw him the first time with her brother, her eyes got even brighter, remaining the same every subsequent time. \"I know you, Ensley, but this- I never imagined you would react this positively to anything here.\" She reached up and stroked his hair as they beheld each other for a moment, both feeling a surreal pride in the other. \"It's my home now, and it involves you.\" She traced her finger from his hair to the collar of his coat before finishing, projecting through her thoughts, \"How else am I supposed to react?\"[Chapter 8] Syl wasn't surprised when Stephanie was the first child she saw, breaking the stillness of the realm. He had ordered they stay in their area for the time being, but now they were free to roam. Stephanie started running over to greet Syl but she stopped suddenly, looking up to Bughuul for permission. He turned to Syl, who smiled softly. She crouched down, holding out her arms. \"Hey, you,\" she said as Stephanie jumped into her arms. \"What've you been up to?\" \"Playing,\" Stephanie said with a shrug. \"Wanna play with us? Pleeeease?\" \"Stephanie.\" \"It's ok,\" Syl told him. \"Isn't it?\" He hesitated. He and Syl aren't the same. What are strictly servants to him are still children to her. The children could use a parental figure who thought of them as their actual children. Not sustenance, not servants. \"Yes. Go,\" he told Stephanie. Syl started following the elated child. \"Ensley.\" She turned back around. \"The meeting...\" Her stomach dropped. \"Mason and Dr. Stomberg? Now?\" \"It should not be very long,\" his voice was uneasy and almost remorseful. \"You can- you can go,\" she said, though fear washed over her face. \"Steph can take me around, I can meet the others. I'll be fine.\" Syl swallowed hard, forcing her mind to believe what her mouth said. Since the moment she awoke, she hadn't been more than a literal few inches from him. But she knew three kids already. Some familiarity. \"Are you sure?\" he asked, brushing strands of hair off her forehead. She nodded, mind clinging to his words and his touch. \"Don't let me stop what you do. I'll see you soon.\" \"I'm sorry,\" he said, tilting her chin to gaze deeply into her eyes. Their eyes lingered on each other for a moment before he vanished. She immediately felt the distance, whether she wanted to or not. \"You're afraid, aren't you?\" came Stephanie's voice, ripping Syl out of her thoughts. \"I- weren't you? Everything's so different.\" \"No,\" Stephanie stated, grasping Syl's hand. \"I hated my family, and my siblings didn't like me, so it's great here. So you saw my film?\" Stephanie sounded excited. Syl followed Stephanie down some stairs and answered, \"Yep. You were the reason the Oswalt murder got all of you famous.\" Stephanie clapped. \"It's great, isn't it! We should show you all our videos. There's a lot. So many of us. Glad you're here, Daddy's... Bughuul's temper is so much better. He's nice to us sometimes.\" \"Oh?\" Stephanie pushed open a door and motioned for Syl to go in. The room was large and bright with candlelight and had several kids playing with different things, all toys and games taken from their old homes. \"Guys!\" Stephanie announced impatiently. They all paused to look at Syl and Stephanie. Syl recognized a number of them from the films. She gave a little wave, trying to make her forced smile look genuine, willing herself to focus. She had barely paid attention to her surroundings, all she knew is that she felt frightened and alone without him right beside her. \"Syl!\" Ashley called. \"I wanna show you something.\" Syl walked over to the back wall, which was covered in paintings, where Ashley proudly pointed at one of the more prominent paintings, one of Syl and Bughuul. \"She let me paint the flowers,\" said Veronica, who made Lawn Work. \"For once.\" Syl traced her fingers along the painting. \"It's beautiful. Amazing work.\" \"Come back,\" Stephanie whined, grabbing Syl's hand again. \"You good at puzzles? Jeremy-\" she pointed to one of the boys Syl didn't recognize \"-and I have been working on this one for a long, long time.\" \"Used to be. I can try?\" Syl knelt down at the table beside Jeremy, across from Stephanie. She kept glancing at Ashley and Veronica's painting, mentally scolding herself for being so clingy and upset. \"So, Jeremy,\" Syl started as she looked from the picture on the box to the actual puzzle, \"You had a film?\" \"Yeah,\" he replied stoically. \"Used a sledgehammer. It was fun.\" \"Nice. Where is everyone else?\" Syl asked, as there were only about a dozen kids in the room. \"All over. Some of them wanna stay invisible, some of them are too ...ill to play anymore.\" Syl didn't need to ask what Stephanie meant by that. Syl nodded softly before placing another puzzle piece down and glancing back at the painting. \"Hey, thanks,\" came Jeremy's oddly indifferent voice. \"You finished it.\" Syl held her hands out to high-five the kids. Syl stood up. \"Hey, Steph? I need some air, why don't you look for another game, I'll be right back.\" Without waiting for a reply, Syl exited the room. She paced the dark hallways for a few minutes until she finally felt she could head back to the children. \"Mason Harper, yes?\" A woman with long blonde hair stood behind an elegant antique desk. He could only assume she was the one he had talked to earlier. Mason nodded. A brief wave of concern rushed over her pleasant expression. \"Just a moment,\" she said with a courteous smile. Stepping into a hallway, she called out, \"Dad! Mason's here.\" \"Is it three o'clock already?\" called a voice from a distant room. A white haired, eccentric-looking man came out of his office. \"Thank you, Leah. Goodness. Uh, hello, I'm Dr. Stomberg, as I'm sure you know.\" Dr. Stomberg walked quickly to Mason to shake his hand. His face was the same as his most recent photo, which was close to a decade old, except now he seemed to carry a heavy burden as shown through the lines in his face. \"Why do I have the feeling you're not here out of fascination with demons and the like?\" He thanked Leah and shepherded Mason to the hallway towards his office. \"I'm not,\" Mason said plainly. He followed Stomberg into the office. \"Have a seat,\" Dr. Stomberg offered. \"What's going on?\" \"I can only hope you're still somewhat involved with Bughuul? Him, the chains, et cetera.\" \"How do you-\" Mason interrupted, giving Stomberg the brief rundown, how he'd been obsessed with the murders since childhood, brought his sister into it, and she became obsessed. He held out the flash drive as if to prove he really did have all the information. Satisfied, Stomberg continued, \"Y-yes. I am. I was. It's been quiet lately, but I worked with a detective for years until he retired, trying to stop, uh, more like slow down , Bughuul. What's happened?\"[Chapter 9] \"Syl?\" came a small and raspy voice behind her. \"Syl!\" it repeated. She turned in its direction, trying to hide the horror that threatened to eke into her expression. A little boy stood there, but he was more like a mummified pile of ash than a child. She had no idea how he was still able to talk. \"You'd better behave,\" he warned. \"You'd better behave. Mr. Boogie doesn't like when we're naughty.\" \"What... the hell... are you talking about?\" Syl couldn't shake off the sickness in her stomach that came from his rotting gaze, staring right into her soul, it seemed. A hungry gaze, but also a warning one. \"I've been around for almost 90 years. I've seen things. Never me, he was never mad at me. That's why I'm still alive.\" Syl cocked her eyebrow. \"I don't understand.\" She tried to keep her voice from wavering. \"You don't know,\" the boy grumbled. \"You don't know what Mr. Boogie does when he's mad. You need to behave.\" \"I-\" She knew he killed a kid who failed and then burned the house, but that was all that was on record. This boy... he knew more, it seemed. \"I only hope he finishes consuming me so I don't see what happens to you. Just behave. And then no-one will witness his wrath against you...\" he walked around her, a strange guttural moan emanating from him. \"Syl...\" he hissed. \"Do what he says, don't question anything, and behave.\" Syl was about to talk when she heard Bughuul's voice in her head, but it no longer felt like her source of calm. She had nowhere to run. If she was suddenly afraid of her only comfort in this realm, what could she do? She stepped back, away from the boy, away from Bughuul. \"Ensley,\" he repeated. \"What did he tell you?\" He immediately regretted leaving her side for more than a second. Nothing was more important to him than Syl and her happiness, yet he felt it necessary to leave her to watch two miserable human beings. When she needed him. She stayed quiet, keeping her gaze everywhere but at him, before finally mumbling, \"You know what he said.\" He turned and looked at the boy, who began to shrink into the shadows before hiding entirely, awaiting his fate. True, he never did incite Bughuul's wrath, until now. Bughuul turned back to Syl. \"Please talk to me.\" \"I don't want to piss you off. I don't know what makes you tick, and I can only pray that I never find out.\" \"Look at me,\" he pleaded, his voice so soft and sincere, tempting, even. But she was too afraid. He wanted to reach out to her, she wanted to feel him, but the sudden lack of trust had prevented that. She wanted to look at him, but then she knew she wouldn't be able to look away. \"What you do... to the kids... when they misbehave...\" she murmured, crossing her arms tightly around herself. \"How do I know I'm any different?\" That sadness in her voice, the sadness he never wanted to hear. \"I told you, they are my servants. You are my equal. I need them for survival and to do my bidding; but you, I need you for companionship. I've waited thousands of years for you. You are not one of them, Syl. You are invaluable to me.\" She glanced up at him finally, taking a deep breath. \"But a couple thousand years is nothing compared to the eternity you've given me. You're bound to get sick of me, at least, if not full-out furious...\" Her voice dropped with her eyes. Her eyes fought back tears. \"Tell me what to do so I don't anger you.\" \"Syl.\" His voice in her head was just a whisper. She could feel the deep emotion in his voice. He felt an achy sorrow, a disappointment in himself. He should have done better- she should have no reason to feel the kind of pain felt as a mortal. He tried so hard to keep it from her then, but it was back now. \"You know that is never going to happen. And you will never upset me. I am never going to leave you. I am never going to hurt you. I want you to believe me.\" He paused for a moment, studying her. She heard \"I should have let you stay\" softly before he turned from her. She felt him leave. Not just physically, but emotionally. Like that connection had weakened ever so slightly. Before he started to walk away, she grabbed his arm. \"Please don't leave.\" Feeling him leave emotionally, scared her more than any future event. The last thing she wanted was for him to leave. She was afraid, yet she knew what he was saying was true. She knew she could believe him. He turned back around as he felt her desperately grasp his hand. \"I took advantage of your blind, impulsive trust when I brought you here. I didn't want you to say yes, Syl, for your sake. You gave it little thought, and you did not know what this all entailed. I took advantage of your vulnerability.\" Syl squeezed his hand lightly. \"No. Bughuul-\" She had opened her mouth to say more, but words would not come out. She cast her eyes back to the floor. \"I wanted you with me so much, but the whole reason I brought you here is why I should have let you stay.\" \"You still gave me a choice.\" Her voice was small but sincere. \"I still chose you. I knew enough. Even if I didn't, I still owed you this.\" \"Stop. You don't owe me anything,\" he insisted. \"But I didn't want to say no,\" she replied quickly. \"You were the only constant thing in my life, and if I said no, you'd leave. I'd never have the dreams- no hope of seeing you again, hearing you, feeling you.\" Her voice cracked as she took a small step toward him, forcing herself to not look at him. She would become powerless to his enchanting presence; for some reason, she felt the need to stay distant. She didn't want to be distant. He sensed that, he felt it. He'd always felt her emotions. He shook his head slowly and sighed quietly. \"Ensley,\" he assured, gently stroking the side of her face before gently running his fingers through her hair. \"Ensley, I never would have left you. My promise to watch over you was not and is not conditional. I would have stopped waiting, but I would never have left. I should have made it clear. But I wanted you with me so desperately.\" She could have finished a normal mortal life. Alone. Without him. She stood there silently for a time, head and eyes lowered. She willed her eyes to flicker up at him, immediately falling captive to his alluring majesty. Like always. She let herself become magnetized to him again. He had done far too much for her in both her old life and this one. He didn't deserve any of this doubt, this fear. He deserved all of her love and trust. Of everything in the universe, he was the one she knew she could believe. She cupped his cheek, a slight gloss covered her eyes. He softly tilted into her hand as she stroked his face with her thumb. \"That wouldn't have changed my answer.\" She leaned herself into him, finding solace in his warmth and steady rise and fall of his chest. \"You know I've always wanted you,\" she whispered. She felt his arms envelop her, feeling close again, safer, happier. He silently held her for several moments until she heard his beautifully smooth voice in her mind. \"I will love and protect you forever. Nothing will change that, Syl.\"[Chapter 10] Mason pulled Syl's phone from his pocket to show Dr. Stomberg the lock screen. \"He has my sister. I want to know why, I want to know how, I want to know what I can do-everything you can possibly tell me, I need to know.\" Dr. Stomberg peered at the phone, clearly expecting Bughuul to do something. Nothing. Mason also showed the picture on his phone, of the symbol in Syl's apartment. Stomberg sighed deeply, shaking his head. He was silent for a minute, nervously chewing on a pencil before he said, \"Tell me more about your sister.\" \"She was-she is my best friend. We've been buddies since she was born. She's literally the greatest, always been a good kid. Energetic, funny, but really deep and thoughtful. Ever since our dad died ...heading on a decade ago, things have been beyond tough. Mom kind of lost it, leaving the picture, but Syl worked her tail off to support herself so I could have my own life, she told me. She would always put others first.\" Mason swallowed the lump in the back of his throat. \"I...my wife and I moved several states away for work, which Syl insisted I do, for my sake. I feel like I abandoned her. Her only other good friend is her roommate, and then my wife. Syl's been alone, afraid and alone.\" Stomberg gave him a small comforting smile. \"I'm sorry,\" he said softly. \"Tell me, Bughuul...\" \"I tried so hard to convince her he wasn't real, but look how well that turned out. I just don't get it. He took her. Just like that, no major theatrics. Nothing.\" \"It is a bit odd...\" \"What's odd is why take someone like her?\" Mason began to sound desperate. \"Why not some disgusting excuse for a person? Why someone so sweet, young, innocent and incredible? It's my fault. Because of me she knew about him.\" Stomberg looked at him thoughtfully, tapping his pencil against his temple. \"It's not your fault. I'm just kind of at uh, at a loss.\" \"Meaning...?\" \"Ok, you know about the, uh, chains, you said? There haven't been any of his murders in the States in almost a decade. He's moved to other countries. I think, more likely than not, he was getting tired of the detective and me, like we were just pests. Burning houses only made his job harder.\" Stomberg looked around the room to gather his thoughts. \"Why would he leave a 'good' chain, to come back here, to do something so uncharacteristic? There's always the family , the child , and then the offering. Not one single person.\" Mason watched him intently. \"He's always very methodical,\" Stomberg continued. \"If he wanted to go out of his way to kill someone, it would be someone like me, the detective, or my daughter, since we all have targets on our heads.\" \"What if my sister is part of a different chain? Stealing adults for fun, kids for food?\" Mason wondered. \"Because he's never gone after adults before. At least not like that.\" \"But how do you know unless it was recorded? Start of a new process, maybe,\" Mason mumbled. \"Capture innocent adults, and break them apart slowly, piece by piece, and-\" \"Look, Mr. Harper. Nothing historical proves against the fact he is methodical. I don't want to be disrespectful or anything, but how can you prove he has a sinister motive?\" Mason let out a laugh. \"Are you kidding me? You of all people should know he is nothing but pure evil.\" \"I understand that, but there... there's always more than one side to things.\" \"You're one to talk,\" Mason scoffed. \"I have no idea what's happening to my sister, and there's nothing I can do to help her! I am all she has. That's why I came to you for help. Can. You. Help. Me?\" \"I want to, but unless we know exactly where she is, there's really not much I can do.\" \"So is there no way to stop him?\" Desperation laced Mason's voice and Dr. Stomberg felt a pang of guilt. \"We can slow him down, like what the detective and I did. But the only way to kill him is starvation, and there will never be a shortage of children.\" \"What about summoning him?\" Mason asked. \"I mean, it's possible with blood sacrifices and his symbol, or his image.\" \"What if I find a picture of him and ask nicely? Maybe drip some of my blood on it? What does he want?!\" \"I don't know. He probably chooses whether or not to answer someone's call.\" Mason stood. \"I'm sorry I wasted your time.\" \"You didn't waste my time,\" Dr. Stomberg assured. \"I wish I could help you, but now I need time to see if I can find more. Please try to think of the possibility that she is alright. This is historically different from anything he's done. Maybe it is all-around different.\" \"But there is hardly anything historically recorded about him because people were too afraid of bringing him into this world, and here I have to suffer with not knowing what the hell is going on because of them . Well, here's a new thing for future generations to hear, better write it down.\" \"I know you couldn't have told me anything over the phone, but now that I know what we're dealing with, maybe I'll be able to do more.\" Mason nodded soberly, reaching out to shake Dr. Stomberg's hand. \"Thank you.\" \"I will keep in contact with you on whether or not I find something helpful. In the meantime, I know you will keep doing your own research and I really hope you find answers.\"[Chapter 11] \"Why do you have all of this?\" Syl wondered, eyes scanning the vast room filled with all kinds of artifacts and documents, ancient and modern alike. Everything in the room had been taken from the victims' houses after the children completed their sacrifices. Along with the toys, other objects were taken. All little things, but still things that represented that time. \"I do want to be educated about human culture. Not that I necessarily have to, but I'd like to know more about who I kill, besides the basic human habits and mentalities.\" \"You have more on humans than humans have on you.\" Syl thumbed through several papers from the late 1700s. \"Why?\" \"I am not afraid of them,\" he said simply. \"You know, when I was little, I thought it was pretty awesome that people were so afraid of you that they destroyed almost everything,\" she smiled, resting her head on his shoulder. \"Glad it never occurred to me that maybe I should have been afraid of you.\" \"Humans are extremely predictable yet extremely unpredictable at the same time. So complex and confusing. As a child your mentality was a new variation of complex unpredictability. I know you, Ensley, you are the one human I ever chose to know and understand completely inside and out, but I never knew why you were not afraid of me, as a child.\" \"Like I said, it never crossed my mind,\" she answered with a smile as he put an arm around her shoulder. \"Probably always had that connection, just didn't know it until later. You've always been so enchanting to me.\" \"You have always been such a rare and astounding person.\" \"I'm glad you think so,\" she replied. \"So is there anything about you in here?\" \"Humans wouldn't dare write anything about me,\" He didn't bother hiding the scorn in his voice. \"Except the few things that ended up being destroyed. But it is better that way.\" \"If nobody knows you exist then you can do more damage, right?\" She posed the question with a glimmer of enthusiasm, the same she felt when reading about everything with her brother. \"That is correct. And more of them would try to stop me, which would be incredibly annoying.\" \"They can't stop you. Can they?\" Syl sounded worried. \"No,\" he assured. \"I can't be killed, nor can I be permanently stopped. Not to say there haven't been countless attempts over the years, some worse than others.\" \"You, did they-\" He shook his head slowly to stop her. \"It was all in the past, I'm fine now.\" \"Can I ask you something?\" she said, facing him and taking his hands in hers. \"Anything.\" \"You know everything about me, maybe even more about me than I know, but- but,\" she hesitated, glancing away momentarily. \"I want to know everything about you. At least, everything you're willing to tell me.\" He studied her, knowing she deserved to know everything. There was hardly anything of major importance about him on earth and they had barely spoken about his life yet. But at the same time he was worried that something he would tell her would either change how innocent she is or change how she felt about him. But why should he doubt her character and her heart? He knew her too well to even consider doubting her. \"Yes,\" he said suddenly. \"Of course, yes. But there's too much to say, but I can show you.\" \"Please. Everything.\" Holding her face in his hands, he began projecting images in her mind, memories of things he's seen, things he's done, things he's felt. Thousands of years' worth of memories were transferred to her in a matter of minutes. It seemed so overwhelming, but that's what she wanted. Everything from past memories to a more in-depth look into how the rituals worked from his perspective. Observation of people and houses. The attempts to stop him, to kill him, the resulting injuries he received, and the torment he dealt in retribution. Transitioning to different kinds of media, how he views the sacrifices as pure art, how he would feed off innocent fear. She felt how much he enjoyed causing pain, and yet she felt the underlying loneliness he had told her he had. He knew her deepest of thoughts throughout her life, and now she could finally feel some of his own thoughts from his past. The dull sensation in her head calmed as the images and feelings faded away, the most recent being just before she had her first dream of him. She knew he had shown her things he was apprehensive about her knowing. A multitude of intense darkness and violence, which he had feared she would be repulsed by. But she wasn't. She had never been. \"I know it's not the same as with you, actually observing and coexisting,\" he said after everything fully faded. \"I hope that wasn't too much.\" His voice in her mind sounded concerned, almost apologetic. \"No such thing,\" she replied, absentmindedly running her fingers along his chest. \"I said I wanted to know everything, and I meant it.\" He wrapped his arms around her waist, pulling her closer. \"I know,\" he said quietly. His entire existence he was alone, everything he did he did alone. It was how he preferred it, but now he felt as if she had been there the whole time. It was a strange and incredible feeling. She looked up at him, eyes full of admiration. She reached up to touch his face and neck, his skin soft and warm under her fingers. \"Bughuul,\" she murmured, just the sound of his name sounding equally as beautiful and powerful as she knew him to be. \"Your life... Thank you for showing me.\" His fingers tangled delicately in her hair as he leaned to rest his forehead on hers. His velvet-smooth voice in her mind sounding so soft, so sincere, so relieved, \"Thank you for letting me.\"[Chapter 12] Real quick, there's only 2 or 3 chapters after this and I'm getting sad thinking about it being over! Would anyone read a potential Part 3? I don't wanna beat a dead horse, so don't be afraid to say no ! The plan would be having Part 3 take place decades after this. All Bughuul and Syl with flashbacks to delve into her backstory. (Over winter break since school = no time!) Otherwise I'll just write up an epilogue chapter and call it a day. PLEASE let me know! :) I'm fine either way Also I CANNOT thank you enough for the support! You guys are so super sweet. It makes me so happy! xoxo, -st0rmy It had been nearly three weeks since Mason was able to get more than thirty minutes of sleep a night. He would keep waking up and going to his office, diligently flipping and clicking through every piece of research he had procured. He had barely spoken any words to his wife, who was getting increasingly concerned. Each time she brought him food or coffee, she would see the barely-touched leftovers from her last visit. But he had finally been able to get a whole hour of sleep. He was set on getting more, until he felt a light tugging on his comforter. He shot up, blinking heavily, tired eyes scanning the bedroom. He felt something grab his hand. Before he had a chance to make a peep, a little girl put her finger to her lips. Wide-eyed, Mason stared at her. She giggled quietly, cutely, even, and motioned for him to follow her. She smiled innocently, and he chose to ignore the decay in her round face. Her loose dark curls bounced up and down as she skipped soundlessly to the doorway, her tattered, blood-stained dress flowered around her as she twirled, her dead eyes still sparkling mischievously. Mason quietly got up, careful not to disturb Taylor as he got out of bed. Cautiously, he stepped towards the girl, who grabbed his hand, pulling him out of the room. She let go once they got to the top of the stairs, and hopped down each one, still making no sound. Mason walked slowly, suddenly wishing he had brought his phone. Or a knife. His eyes darted across the room. She grabbed his hand again, leading him to his office. She pointed towards the doorway and stepped aside so he could walk in. On his desk, his laptop was open, playing the same video that was on Syl's computer. The video that was only on her computer and his flash drive. The flash drive was nowhere in sight. Mason heard his door creak and close quietly, but he was too engrossed in the video to care. The video looped several more times until it suddenly stopped, right on Bughuul. Mason stepped closer, but he knew Bughuul was watching. Why else would it stop there? Mason slammed his computer shut and turned around, eyes widening momentarily before hardening his gaze and clenching his jaw. Bughuul stood there silently, slightly tilting his head and studying him. \"What do you want, Boogeyman?\" Mason spat, knowing full well the deity knew he meant it as a slur. \"Was taking my sister not enough? How about my wife? My son? You want them too? I won't let you!\" He slammed his fist down on the desk, leaving a dent in the wood. \"I don't want them,\" Bughuul spoke softly into Mason's mind. Too soft. Too calm. \"And Syl chose to come with me. I didn't take her. If it weren't for you,\" he said, taking a step closer. \"She never would have known I existed. I guess you deserve my gratitude.\" Mason rubbed his temples letting out a brief bitter laugh. \"I was a stupid, stupid child. Every day of my adult life I regretted ever showing my innocent baby sister such vile and disgusting things. This is all my fault! What have you done to her?\" \"Unlike you these past several years, I've been with her, taking care of her. She's fine.\" He still sounded far too calm. \"As if I believe that,\" Mason grumbled. \"You are just going to have to take my word for it.\" \"Fuck you.\" Bughuul strode across the room, pinning Mason between himself and the desk. The air was an icy quiet. Mason was a small, helpless child in Bughuul's imposing presence. But Mason didn't dwell on that long. He straightened up, his efforts of being even slightly imposing absolutely futile- laughable, even, to Bughuul. Mason ignored the chills running down his spine and the sudden sense of an impending crippling migraine. \"Go ahead. Do it. I know you're here to kill me anyway.\" \"I could so easily turn you inside out, light you on fire, and let you live like that for weeks. You understand that, do you not?\" Mason rolled his eyes but nodded just the same. Bughuul continued, \"As much as killing you, torturing you, would give me so much satisfaction right now, I'm not going to.\" \"Why not?\" Bughuul stepped back slowly. \"Because of Syl. For her sake, I'm sparing your pathetic life. But I would advise you to stop all of this.\" \"I'm not going to stop until I know what happened. And I cannot - will not - just take your word for it.\" Mason spat. \"The reason I wanted Syl, and the reason she agreed to come, is by no means that confusing to figure out.\" Mason sat down, still eyeing him, but there was less fire in his glare. He ran his fingers through his hair. \"What she said on the phone, how do I know she wasn't being brainwashed and forced to say it? Bughuul paced around the room, which had become yet another office dedicated to him and his children. He paused to pick up a news article, and turned back to Mason after skimming it. \"If you would focus more on the facts rather than your emotions, you would know there is no reason to not believe me.\" \"At least I have emotions. You just want to murder, torture, inflict pain. But have you ever felt loss? Pain? Dear God, what kind of fucked up person would let their sister become obsessed with some thing like you?!\" \"I felt her pain.\" \"You felt her-\" Mason let out another bitter laugh but stopped suddenly. \"You felt her pain...\" he repeated quietly, the realization slowly dawning on him. \" Guardian ...\" Mason spun his chair back to face Bughuul and stood up. He studied him, thoughts beginning to churn in his mind. \"You... No. No, no, no!\" Mason began to pace around as his face flushed with hot anger. \"You? Why? You're lying. You are lying to me. What did you do to her?!\" \"You know I'm not lying to you.\" \"If your word is so immaculate, Bughuul,\" he sneered. \"The least you can do is prove it to me. Where. Is. Syl?\" \"Respect...\" Bughuul was enjoying toying with Mason far too much. Mason threw his head back. \"Respect? You think you deserve my respect? After-\" \"My patience is running incredibly thin,\" Bughuul interrupted. \"And you are wasting my time. I'm just waiting for you to stop talking to me like I am your subordinate, because she wants to see you.\" Mason stormed up to Bughuul, \"You listen to me,\" Mason growled, grabbing Bughuul's shirt collar. \"I am sick of your games. You are letting me see my sister. And you are going to. Right now!\" As Bughuul glanced down at him, Mason felt his mind start to burn up. Excruciating fire filled his head. Mason stumbled backward. He grabbed his temples and his vision blurred. It took more willpower than he thought he had to keep from crying out. The room seemed to crack, melt in Mason's vision. Swirls of blood and fire swarmed in front of him. Images of murders never before seen plagued him. And he felt every one of them.[Chapter 13] Mason felt suffocated, he felt like he was drowning. He felt rats burrowing out of his stomach. He felt his body being dented and bashed by a sledgehammer. He felt his body being consumed by supernatural fire. His eyes felt gouged out, then he felt himself being hung on a tree. He felt acid burns, he felt himself get gutted. He felt his body get chopped with an axe, he felt snow freeze his body. More flames. More blood. More fear. The fear the dying families felt. The darkness that grew inside the children. He felt it all. \"Bughuul,\" Syl quietly said in her thoughts. She softly rubbed her hand along his back, briefly resting her head on him. \"Hey.\" He wouldn't answer. She knew what he was doing to her brother. She saw it all in Bughuul's mind. \"Listen,\" she whispered urgently. She moving in front of him, grasping his hand and interlacing their fingers. She cupped his cheek with her other hand, making him look at her. Gazing up at him with concerned eyes, she pleaded, \"Please stop.\" \"What are you doing here?\" \"Please stop hurting my brother. I know he's disrespected you, but he lost part of himself. You know how close we were. I need you to understand. Calm...\" She whispered his name, smoothing his hair off his face. \"Please.\" Syl couldn't hide the emotion in her voice. He sighed deeply, trying to quench the fires in his own mind as he laid his forehead on hers. \"There we go,\" she soothed, sensing the end of Mason's mental torture. \"Thank you.\" Syl pressed her hand on his cheek before turning to face Mason, though she stayed pressed against Bughuul, clearly apprehensive of how her brother would react. Mason's mind was still burning, as his body trembled and his eyesight wavered. A wave of vertigo rushed over him and he stumbled backward, willing his eyes and brain to cooperate. But then he saw them. Beautiful and surreal. The contrast. Lightness and darkness. Evil and innocence. Life and death. Human and deity. Mason watched them, how they seemed to melt into each other. How she looked at him. How he reacted to her touch, her words. The undeniable bond between the Eater of Children and his bride. It couldn't be. Mason took a step closer. Glancing back at Bughuul, Syl stepped toward her brother, still within an arm's length of her guardian. \"Ensley?\" Mason reached out, faintly touching her shoulder. \"Are you real?\" She could do nothing but nod. They stared at each other in silence until Mason finally reached out to grab her into a hug. Mason embraced her as tightly as he could, hot tears slowly trickling down his face. \"You're here. I-you, are-I... are you alright? Are you ok?\" \"Yes, I'm fine,\" she said, trying to encourage him. Her chest welled up with sadness, knowing she would never see him after today. Mason released her, but still grasped her shoulders, looking her up and down. She looked older, in a way. Though they Skyped weekly, he hadn't seen her in person in almost a year. The sadness in her eyes looked to be almost gone, the innocent spark still there. She had a strange, ethereal beauty, nothing but serenity and happiness in her eyes. No longer the care, the worry, the loneliness. \"You aren't like the kids,\" he said after fully studying her. \"You aren't dead.\" \"He took my death from me; I'm ...immortal,\" she said carefully. \"Immortal.\" An eternal life of torture? \"And you're ...with... him, is that right?\" Syl took a half step back. \"Yes. And everything he told you is true.\" \"And you believe him just like that? You know his history of manipulation, the master of sweet-talking, just ask any of those kids, hmm?\" \"I'm not one of them,\" she said simply, enough to shut him down. \"So you just... I don't understand. You left... everything... you...\" \"I can't explain it. I don't know what drew me to him. I don't know what makes me so special, I just know that we're together now, and I'm safe, I'm not alone, and I'm happy.\" \"And this was the only option? Look, I'm sorry I showed you the films. I'm sorry I introduced you to him. If I could take that all back, I would! I would never have moved half the country away. I would have made sure you had a good life.\" \"You didn't deserve living the same dull life just so you can look out for me,\" Syl told him. \"You deserved to meet Taylor, you deserve this great job, and you deserve to be a father. But you know what else? My guardian wanted us together. And so did I.\" \"Guardian...\" Mason scoffed, rolling his eyes. \"Where was he the day Mom and Dad told me I would be a big brother? I was beyond excited. It was the greatest news ever, knowing I'd have a little partner in crime. Where was he then, Syl? Where was he then?\" \"Mase... I know you've literally been there forever. You are the greatest brother, the greatest person I know. You'll always be my best friend. But I had to do this. I chose this. I chose to be immortal so I could be with Bughuul forever. I chose him .\" \"No. You chose to abandon me. I'm never going to see you again or talk with you again. Now, I'm going to worry about you until the day I die. You ever think how I'd feel? You are my sister , my best friend, and you think I'm ok with this? You think I'm ok with losing our late night chats that end in hysterical laughter, our stupid texts, our inside jokes, our-\" Mason took a deep breath, trying not to let it all sink in. Syl buried her head in her hands. \"I... I'm sorry, Mase. I tried. I tried to get over myself. I don't know what to say. I'm going to miss all of that, I'm going to miss you. So, so much. I just came here to tell you I'm safe.\" \"Safe? I felt what he can do before you stopped him. What if he does that and worse to you? He won't listen to your pleas for mercy then. You've subjected yourself to his control. Your mind is his, you know what he does. I'm worried for you, Ensley.\" \"He won't. Look, he's been with me constantly, helping me adjust, showing me places. Our realm is so dark and beautiful, the kids are great, there's so many other dimensions to be seen. It's wonderful and I'm fine. I know you don't believe him, but please believe me.\" \"Syl...\" \"Mason, look at me,\" she said, taking his hands. \"Look into my eyes. You've always said I couldn't hide anything because of them. You always knew when I was lying, when I was upset, anything.\" \"N-no. I don't need to.\" \"Why?\" she pressed. \"I'm afraid...\" he mouthed after a few moments silence. Afraid he'd see what he didn't want to see. Afraid she was telling the truth. It was better than her being in an eternal hell, but knowing she willingly made this choice... \"Mase.\" He finally stared into her eyes. It was there. Almost unrecognizable. For the first time in a decade, Mason saw happiness. He saw relief, he saw calm. He saw light. \"You promise?\" he whispered. \"Yes, Mason. I promise you. I'm beyond alright.\" \"But w-with him?\" \"Yes! Yes,\" she repeated softly. \"I couldn't ask for better.\" \"Syl...\" Mason said, lower lip quivering slightly as tears fell. He wrapped his arms tightly around his little sister, holding her close, knowing that would be the last time. \"I'm never going to see you again.\" Syl hugged him as tears ran down her face. \"No... but... but I'll still see you sometimes, alright? I'll be there, just... just from afar.\" \"Syl, please don't go. Please don't leave me.\" His voice shook with sorrow. Syl pulled away from their embrace, reaching her hand to Mason's face, wiping away some of his tears. \"I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.\" \"I can't protect you anymore,\" Mason said remorsefully. \"I will.\" There was softness in Bughuul's voice; no longer the pure hatred. Mason looked at him with wide eyes but nodded soberly. \"Mase, enjoy your life, enjoy your family. Please,\" Syl urged as she stepped away from her brother. \"I love you.\" \"I love you, Syl.\" \"Goodbye, Mason.\"[Chapter 14] Last chapter! Again, if anyone is OPPOSED to a Part 3 (decades from this, all Bughuul/Syl + flashbacks), PLEASE let me know. Also, to those in favor of Part 3, anything you'd like to see I'd love to hear it. Still a huge \"if\" on my end! And I just wanna thank you guys SO much for all the support. No words to describe how happy it makes me! Wow. You're amazing!. Lots of love, -St0rmy Mason woke up resting on his arms on his desk. He slowly sat up, cracking his neck side to side. He looked around his office. Neat and tidy. Nothing on the walls except for this large decorative abstract ...thing... he and Taylor thought was pretty. On his desk was scattered a few framed pictures of his family, including an ultrasound photo of his son. This isn't right. The walls are too empty. There was a cup of half-drunk coffee on his desk next to his computer. He tilted it towards his mouth and decided against finishing it off. Something was off, he knew. Something told him to turn around, and he did, towards the desk drawer. Opening it slowly, he peered in. He saw a large folder that he didn't quite recognize. He flipped the folder open, revealing a bunch of pictures and newspaper clippings. He stared at them intently, as if he couldn't recall what they were, but he knew he should. Blinking to clear his vision, he flipped through them some more until it all came back to him. What he assumed was the day before was when he saw his sister for the last time. Alive and well and not a normal human anymore. Sighing deeply, he left the room, looking cautiously throughout the house. Everything seemed in place. He didn't know why he felt so uneasy. \"Good morning, hun,\" Taylor exclaimed. \"You slept in your office?\" Mason shrugged. \"Apparently.\" He walked over to the table where she had breakfast laid out. \"You could have woken me up. I don't want you to have to do a thing, I told you.\" \"You were out,\" she replied with a laugh. \"Anyway, I know you'll step up once the baby is here.\" She handed him his coffee and sat down with her cup of tea. She watched him carefully as he took a bite. Mason noticed and responded, \"What's up?\" She had been so worried about his well-being for the past few weeks, and now she acted like nothing happened. Taylor shrugged. \"I just love you, is all.\" Her smile looked sorrowful. \"I love you too,\" Mason replied with a grin, although he seemed slightly suspicious. They ate in a relative silence, but nothing awkward. Mason kept waiting for Taylor to mention something about the ghost children or about his meeting with Dr. Stomberg, but nothing. After they finished eating, Mason cleared the table before cleaning up for work. Something caught his attention in his peripheral view, but when he turned, nothing was there. He finished brushing his teeth, still feeling watched. Mason went to their room to get his tie on and check his phone. Oddly enough, there was a voicemail from Natalie. He fixed his tie and listened. \"Hey Mason, it's Nat. I just wanted to check in on you and see how you're doing.\" She started to sound a bit choked up. \"I can't imagine... It's so empty in our apartment. I miss her a lot and I've only known her a few years. If you need anything, let me know. Tell Taylor hi from me.\" \"What the hell?\" Mason finished getting ready before running down the steps. \"Taylor...\" he said hesitantly. \"Yeah?\" \"I know this is going to sound weird but... what happened within the past few days?\" Taylor's eyes dropped, but she looked back at him with concern. She figured he must have taken his pills, too many of them at once. \"Don't... you remember?\" \"What are you saying?\" \"Your sister's funeral.\" \"Did you do this?\" He nodded his head slowly. \"Why?\" Syl wondered. \"The truth is far too complicated for human minds, it would cause too much trouble. He remembers our meeting. He knows what happened. And he knows he cannot tell anyone of this.\" \"So the others, why can't they-\" He laid his finger on her lips. \"Ensley, trust me?\" She nodded slowly with a sigh. \"Of course.\" He took her hand in his. \"You're alright?\" His voice had a hint of concern. \"Yeah,\" she replied with a small smile. \"Yeah, I'm fine. It was good to get closure.\" \"I'm sure it was.\" \"Thank you,\" she said softly. \"For sparing my brother's life. And his family's. I know that wasn't your original intention...\" Her eyes flitted downward momentarily. Looking back at his face, she added, \"And no. I won't ask you again.\" Syl knew how big of a deal it was that he would spare anyone's life, let alone an entire family, let alone an innocent child. \"I know you won't,\" he said, brushing strands of hair from her face. \"I don't want to be part of that world anymore.\" It was as if she were reassuring him. He cupped her face in his hands, thumbs smoothing her cheeks. \"You never did,\" he replied, his telepathic voice sounding amused yet proud. A smile spread across Syl's face. \"True. I guess I did always want you to take me away,\" she said as she slid her arms around him. \"Just without the corruption and murdering my family part.\" \"Which is exactly how everything turned out.\" She felt his arms encircle her slowly as he rested his forehead on hers. \"This realm needs one thing that is not corrupt in any way,\" he said, the velvet-smooth voice in her mind soft and sincere. There was a bright flash, causing Bughuul and Syl turned towards the doorway where Stephanie was standing. She had a Polaroid camera in her hands. Before either of them could react, she ran out and disappeared into the shadows. Mason trudged to his office and set a stack of papers down. He turned to his desk and startled. \"Steph...a...nie?\" He remembered the girl. So many childhood memories flooded back. \"This is for you, Mason!\" She handed him the picture she had taken. He gave her a small smile and then she disappeared. He looked down at it and sighed a shuddering breath. He held a gateway to their realm in his hands. He traced his fingers delicately around the photograph. So surreal. So mesmerizing. Mason smiled. \"Goodbye, Syl.\" ","Summary":" Heyyy it's me. Again. Sinister fic Round 3! Bc I love the concept of Guardian, but it was unfortuna"},{"Movie":"Sinister","Title":"The Sinister Legend","Author":"Jedi Heathcliff","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9083183","Passage":"[Chapter 1] A/N: Sinister is a pretty decent horror film, and I just HAD to write a fanfiction of it. It may be weird, but I hope to do Sinister justice. Please enjoy, and tell me how it is :) Disclaimer: I do not own any characters that you will recognize from Sinister, nor am I making a profit from this. I'm simply writing this to pass time, and hope to satisfy others with more Sinister until a new movie of it comes out :) Side note: This is going to happen about thirteen years after the Oswalts' murder. I know it sounds ridiculous, but I want to have at least one true survivor of the Oswalt family murder. That one survivor will be Trevor, who is now about 25 I believe. Forgive me if I'm wrong about the age. Chapter One: The Films The listing price of such an elegant home was ridiculously low. Beautifully carved, white pillars lined the front of the house. There were many large windows that let in a tremendous amount of light to illuminate the rooms during the day, but the best part was a study with a large fireplace on the second floor of the home that had already had furniture decorating it: a spacious, mahogony desk with an overhead light, bookshelves full of classic literature and even the modern crime novel Kentucky blood was on the shelves. To be precise, there were six copies total. Four floors total. Five if one were to include the attic. Isabelle set the last box down in the middle of the foyer and breathed in the new-house-smell. This was her first home. Finally having a job and ready to start life on her own, she was prepared for the best of luxuries considering her first house was so large and her job was more pay than she could have ever imagined a high school teacher receiving. Then again, this town was fairly rich in wealth and education. It was a high-class kind of town. Then again, maybe she just got good pay because she worked well with the high shcool students when she was a student teacher. It wasn't hard; she herself was in high school less than five years ago. After unpacking a dozen or so boxes, Isabelle decided to head out and explore the neighborhood. \"Hey! What do you think you're doing?\" someone yelled, just as she was about to step a foot off her property. Isabelle turned around to see a lean young man with long brown hair run up to her from her left. She raised her right brow in curiousity and confusion. \"What do you mean 'what do you think you're doing'? What am I doing that I'm not supposed to be doing?\" \"Living in that house,\" he stated rather harshly. \"Well, okay, I think I will be leaving. Nice to meet you, too.\" She turned the opposite direction of where he had come running. \"I wasn't finished talking to you,\" he called to her. She tried to be patient and not lash out at this man who was acting quite unwelcoming to her. Maybe not so much the words he was saying, but defnitely how he was saying them. \"I'm sorry to have moved right next door, Sir, but I'm not giving the house back.\" Crossing his arms, he asked, \"Were you not told of what happened there?\" \"Of course I was told what happened, but the house was cheap, and I don't believe in ghosts .\" He glared down at her. He was pretty tall...well, maybe he wasn't. Maybe she was simply short. \"You'll regret it.\" \"I don't feel regret. I simply see the good even when there's bad.\" Maybe that was pushing it a little too far, but Isabelle wasn't used to people being rude to her. Especially for first impressions and first meetings. Usually, people had no problem being polite and formal. Clearly, this man had one. He shook his head as if he were talking to a child who couldn't help but be beyond the definition of naive. Then, he walked away, not even giving her his name. She watched him enter a house right next to the one she had just moved in. If he had cared so much about the horrors of that house, why had he moved right next to it? Sighing in irritation, Isabelle was no longer in the mood for an exploration. Unpacking a few more boxes, she recalled what the realtor had told her about this house: \"It was a family of four. The husband was working on a new book in a different town until he and his family made a mad dash for this place. He was going to be a retired writer and find a different job to support his family, but the same night they moved in, they were brutally murdered. The father and the mother of the family were found, heads decapitated, limbs cut off from their torsos. But one of the children, a small girl by the name of Ashley had gone missing, while the other boy who was 12 had escaped. The police still cannot figure out what happened exactly. However, the house is cheap because of the tragic event driving away any and all buyers of the place. Having a house not being sold for so long will probably result in the tearing of it down. But it's such a pretty house. Why would anyone want that to happen?\" She took a few things that belonged to her parents and set them up in the attic. When she entered the vacant area, she noticed a single box directly in the center of the room with the label Home Videos. Setting her own box down, she picked the other one up and brought it to her office with the elegant fireplace, and set it on her desk. There were Super 8 films lined in another smaller box along with a projector to project them. Each roll of film had been labeled: House Painting '12 ; Family Hanging Out '11; Sleepy Time '98 ; Lawn Work '86 ; BBQ '79; Pool Party '66. Strange, she thought. Each film was taken in thirteen-year increments until Family Hanging Out and House Painting where it was merely a single year. Not just that, but what family takes films so far apart? Where are the other videos? Is this the same family filming? Deciding to satisfy her curiosity, she picked a random film from the middle and inserts it into the projector. Before turning it on, she struggled to find one of her white king-sized sheets to pin up on the wall. When she did find one, she suddenly noticed a rolled up projection screen on the opposite wall of the fireplace. Rolling her eyes at herself, she rolled the screen down and placed the projector on one of the larger packing boxes. Isabelle finally got it to work. She placed the film roll on and turned it on after switching off the lights. The family was in the kitchen. There was a mother, a father, two sons, and a chihuahua gathering around to make a family meal. Of course, the dog was merely making its rounds about the members to beg for food; only the youngest son had bothered to give him any. The mother looked kind and gentle. She smiled as she poured some pasta into a boiling pot, and the father grabbed fresh vegetables from the fridge and began cutting them up into minuscule pieces. Suddenly, the film cut off and switched scenes. It was now dark inside the house, and instead of the film having been set down to show everyone like before, someone was moving slowly through the halls and rooms and up the stairs in an eerie pace that didn't seem right. Something was off. A strange symbol was drawn in some kind of dark red paint on the wall just before a door. The person walked into the room and showed the mother and father lying in bed, tied at the hands, feet and their mouths duct-taped. The little dog was placed in the middle and continued to yap at whoever was holding the camera. Out of nowhere, a knife was in front of the camera and the throats of both parents were being slit. Isabelle covered her mouth to keep from crying out; not that it would have mattered, no one would have heard her scream. The slasher was now walking into another bedroom. This time, the younger boy of the family was lying bound on his bed. The knife appeared once more, covered in blood. Before metal touched flesh, Isabelle jumped back, knocked the box and the projector over and fell to her knees, trying her best to get rid of the horrific images that were swelling in her head. She brushed her curly brown hair back and forced herself to get up. She snatched the projector and all the films and headed out to her backyard. With much energy, Isabelle began burying the films of horrible and sinister happenings. A/N: Reviewing/Messaging me really helps! Even if it has nothing to do with Sinister :D[Chapter 2] A/N: I'm a bit shocked to have had any comments on the first chapter! Thanks for the support of this wacked out story. I know of the plot, but some huge special-certain-lovely-things are still unknown, if you know what I man ;) Anyway, I know that you guys are probably reading this story because you want to pass time, but I was kind of hoping to be more interactive with those who like the story enough to follow. So here's the dealio before I begin: 1) If you decide you want to be a part of this interacting, simply comment saying you want to join. Don't worry, Sinister lovers! I have a name for us! The Bughuulies! (AKA: a mix of Bughuul and Boogie). Might sound lame, but hey, we have our group now, yes? 2) *To be interactive, I would like for those to spit out ideas. It can be absolutely anything . You can ask for unicorns to come in or for OUR Isabelle to fall in love with somebody, etc. All of the suggestions will be in consideration, and I will most likely be using all of them in some form or another . I will also give credit to the person whose ideas I've used in that chapter in a section called...DUN DUN DUN DUN: The Bughuulies! Which will simply be a section where I quote you guys and respond, send a message specifically to you, and as stated just recently, where I also give credit to any ideas you have kindly given. 3) For further information, the only thing I do have in mind for this story is the simple extension of the legend told in the movie. I thought it could have been more in-depth and such, so that is what I'm going to do. Honestly, all the rest I have yet to come up with. I know, bad planning. 4) You might find this completely weird and entirely different. However, that is the point. Instead of this story being just mine, I saw we band together to make it ours. ( Besides, having more interaction and suggestions will really REALLY help me actually write this story because I'm never good at continuing a story) . This way, I actually get somewhere with this thing. *You can also PM me your suggestions or to simply chat with me :) I'm a very good listener/chaterer...er... Thank you for listening, my little Bughuulies! Now enjoy! Disclaimer: I do not own any characters that you will recognize from Sinister, nor am I making a profit from this. I'm simply writing this to entertain others, and hope to satisfy others with more Sinister until a new movie of it comes out! Chapter Two: First Day of Work Isabelle took a shower, dressed in nice pants and a dressy cardigan and headed off to her first day of work. The high school was only seven minutes away when driving, so gas money won't be much of a problem for her. Yet another plus of moving into that house. What that man was talking about, she didn't know. Except for those films. But she couldn't go there again; it would tamper with her sanity too much. She sighed and continued to supress the images. Finally parking in her assigned spot in the staff parking lot, she removed the key from the ignition and waltzed inside like she was on a catwalk. Isabelle couldn't help herself. This was her first day of actual work. Even when she was in school and college, her parents were the wealthy kind to have given her money just like that. Although, the money stopped coming in when she was finished with school. After that, her parents saw to it that she got a job in this place and that she could live a life on her own. Spoiled, she was, and sometimes Isabelle felt terrible for it. Stepping into her classroom that used to be Mr Aper's, an English teacher who had mentored her during the student teacher days. Now, it was all hers to use as she pleased. In this very room, she would open the minds of young adults to not just the beauty of literature, but to concepts where the students will be able to exercise their brains on. Students of both juniors and seniors started pouring in five minutes prior to the ringing of the first bell. Though after the bell rang, three students had walked into class. Two with their heads down in a sort of shameful way and the third clearly not giving a crap. \"Hello, class. I'm Ms. Jennings, and I will be your new English teacher for the rest of the year,\" she simply stated, smiling. At first, she thought this would be a simple task: state her name, give the class a simple essay to read and discuss; however, her nerves were getting the best of her. A hand was already flapping in the air. \"Are you that lady who moved into the haunted house?\" a girl asked. Not more of this again... \"Yeah,\" a boy began, \"That house has to be wicked haunted! A whole family was completely chopped up there! Not to mention, the dude of the house was already crazy before he moved here. The dude ran away from some other town. Probably because he knew the killer was on to him, so the killer decided to threaten him, but moving to a completely different state didn't do much for the poor dude. He wrote a book, and I read it! It was pretty badass. He is like a crime writer, which explains how he would be onto the killer and stuff.\" The boy right next to him nodded, \"I read that. Kentucky Blood. I also heard that the dude's son got away. Have you seen him, Billy? I think he still lives here! Right next to the house where his family was slaughtered! But I don't think his sister was slaughtered. I heard she was missing.\" Isabelle sighed. Might as well let them have a fun first day about whatever they want to talk about. She pulled a stool in front of the class. \"How old was she then? Nine or ten? She would be pretty old now...\" Billy, the second one to have spoken about the subject said. The girl who had first spoken shook her head, \"Twenty-two isn't old, Billy.\" \"Too old for me to date her, Julie!\" She rolled her eyes, \"That's all you ever think about: sex.\" Isabelle rose a brow, \"Alright, let's keep on the subject of the house, please. You all are lucky enough I decided not to assign you the essay I was planning to give.\" Everyone's eyes grew wide. This notion made her laugh. \"So, who is the person who survived the murders that is still living in this town?\" Julie's hand shot up again. She was clearly passionate on this subject. Or maybe she was just passionate about answering as many questions and asking just as many as she possibly could. \"May I take out my phone and show you some images and articles? I have them saved onto my notepad app.\" Isabelle nodded. Billy rolled his eyes this time, \"Nerd. Do you even play games on that? Who uses their own gaming device for education?\" \"No downing others in my classroom,\" Isabelle faked a cough. Billy looked at her as she and the rest of the class chuckled. Julie pulled up an article and image. In the image was a solemn looking boy with chest-length brown hair and a pale face. His eyes were a dark brown and obviously empty from the horrors he had either heard of or-and she hated to think-witnessed himself. But that wasn't the biggest thing on her mind. Isabelle recognized that little boy as the now-grown-man who had snapped at her for living in that house. Suddenly, the impatientness she had when he was talking to her made her feel utterly guilty now. \"His name is Trever Oswalt, and he was twelve at the time. We believe he still lives in this town, but where the haunted house and his house is really isn't an area any of us live in. Those are where the elderly people live, mostly,\" Julie explained. \"Did he witness the massacre or was he just informed?\" The girl shrugged, \"Beats me. The police here don't talk about it much because they feel they have failed at their job for never having found their sister or the killer.\" \"I bet the police know more than their willing to tell anyone. Especially that one guy in the town where the hanging happened...that was the house that the dude lived in before he decided to run like a chicken to this place. Look where he put this town. We are getting bad reps now because of it,\" Billy complained as if he actually cared about the town's reputation. The boy right beside Billy, Joel, looked at him weirdly, \"What are you talking about? Now this cruddy, boring town has something interesting going on!\" Julie chuckled, \"As if you even remember what this 'cruddy, boring town' was like thirteen years ago. You can barely remember a lecture after one day.\" \"Alright,\" Isabelle interupted, \"Since some of us seem to have some knowledge of this happening, I would like each of you to write down everything you know or have heard of about it. You can write an essay, make notes, write bullet points, or make it into a story. Any way you choose is just fine, so long as you write something and turn it into the white basket on my desk before you leave class.\" First hour ended up being the only class where this prompt was assigned. The other classes seemed to be interested in other things such as band or sports. Not a single mention of that house. Isabelle was partly grateful for it. It was a small break from the reality that she was living in. It also kept her mind off the guilt she felt. She would have to remember to apologize somehow, and not just by knocking on his door and simply saying \"sorry\". That would not do. After the school day ended, she drove home and decided to make dinner for him. Spaghetti with her specially made meat sauce. Isabelle prayed he was home. Then again, why wouldn't he? What man who had been traumatized at the age of twelve was able to function in a job? Let alone how to function on his own? Maybe that's why he lashed out at her. Perhaps he felt she was intruding on his family's memory or something. Isabelle shook her head. She was overthinking it all. She took out all the ingredients, setting them on the island in her kitchen. Before she was going to cook, she'd have to invite to see if he even wanted to come. That was probably the challenging part. What if he decided he didn't want to come? How was she supposed to give a sincere apology on someone's doorstep? She hated when people did that. Doorsteps will be doorsteps: boring. Many dresses lined her back closet. She had a knack for parties sometimes, and wearing the same dress twice was not something she enjoyed doing. She cursed her mother for giving her that trait. As she flipped through the rack of dresses, she suddenly stopped. What the hell am I doing? This isn't a date! This is simply a dinner and a sincere apology! Instead, Isabelle worked on her hair first, forgetting the outfit choice. Brushing it to a silky brown, she tossed the brush onto the bathroom counter and stuck with pants and a nice shirt. She rushed to the main floor and to her front door. It was quite alarming to find-after she opened that door-Trevor holding a platter covered in tin foil. For a moment, they stared at one another. For her, it was because she was secretly laughing to herself at the coincidence and for him, it was because he didn't know how to talk to people well without coming across as cold. \"I..uh, wanted to apologize,\" he mumbled almost reluctantly. Trevor presented the platter closer to her, and she took it. Smiling, she thanked him. \"I was just about to get you, actually. To invite you over for dinner, that is. I wanted to apologize for being rude.\" At this, he laughed. Kind of. It was more of an \"oh, please\" kind of laugh than a happy and genuine one. \"I was the one at fault, and you are smart enough to know that.\" Tilting her head, she furrowed her eyebrows in confusion. He answered her question before she even had to ask it, \"You just look like one of those kinds of people who retain a lot of knowledge. Am I wrong?\" \"Actually, you are. I may be book smart, but I ain't no other kind of smarts,\" she joked. \"Would you like to come in? I was just boiling the water for dinner.\" \"I don't know...\" \"Please,\" she insited, \"I bought so much spaghetti and there isn't any way for me to eat it all!\" she said in an over-dramatic way. \"If you say so.\" Isabelle gestured him in. To her surprise, he wasn't as hesitant walking in as she expected he would be. His mood was back to the grimness, but being in the house where his parents died didn't seem to effect him like it would have affected Isabelle if the situation were reversed. Odd. The water was now boiling, so she tossed the noodles in and began to brown the meat, adding seasonings and such. Trevor just sat down that the dining table which was still next to the kitchen (being the dining room and the kitchen technically one whole room). \"Forgive me for asking...but does it not bother you to be in this house?\" He shrugged, \"I've been in it plenty of times before.\" \"Oh,\" she simply said as she sat down talked over the sizzeling meat and the boiling noodles. \"My turn to ask a question-\" \"Oh, so now we are in a questioning game, are we? I wasn't aware that I was required to answer a question having asked one. Is that even fair?\" she smirked. Chuckling, he said, \"It's entirely fair. Can't expect to get away with personal questions and not having to be asked one. So, have you found or felt anything weird about this house since the first time you've seen it or lived in it?\" The question sounded rehearsed. Almost as if he chose his words carefully to make sure there wasn't any loophole where she could lie. And Isabelle hated lying. She tried not to lie, but exceptions had to be made for the first thought that came into her mind were those films she had found blatantly in the attic. \"No...why do you ask? Are you really into all that supernatural stuff? Ghosts aren't real you know. Although, I admit, I believe the devil likes to control demons to make us think that we are connecting with people who have once lived on this earth. Sometimes, they try to trick us into worshipping the devil. Isn't that so...egotistical?\" \"Demon. Yes, that's a better word than ghost,\" he said, but it sounded like more to himself than to her. She gave him a questioning look, but he was clearly in his own world as he stared at the table. \"Alright, then,\" she said, setting the table and placing oven-mits down for the hot pot and pan. \"Dinner is ready.\" The Bughuulies: I'll be honest, guys, the genre for this story is definitely part Romance, but I was certainly not aiming in the direction of Trevor. I'm sorry. But to be honest, it could have gone many different directions. It's hard for me to choose, which is why I'm letting you guys do it! :D YAYYYYY CHOOOOSIIIING! Please help me...please don't make me do it! Anyway, thank you Lady Minuialwen , Amber , 2SummerSolstice9 , and KnightmareAngel for reviewing! It means so much to me :)[Chapter 3] Chapter Three: The Craving for More \"Thank you for the meal.\" They stood on the front of his porch. His house was definitely not the size for a family of more than three, but by himself, it seemed to fit quite nicely. She wondered if he ever felt alone at night... \"You are very welcome, of course.\" Selfishly due to her guilt, she added, \"If you ever want to hang out or have another meal together...you are always welcome to come over. Don't feel the need to be all polite and distant because I bought that house... Which reminds me, do you know... Nevermind.\" Isabelle mentally slapped herself. She was so close to asking him about the trauma he had to go through. Stupid, stupid. \"No,\" Trevor insisted, \"You can ask.\" She still hesitated; the subject was unimaginably sensitive...it had to have been, but the curiosity was great, \"What happened? Did you witness it? Did...did you see the killer?\" Rubbing his eyes, he sighed. \"I think that story will have to wait.\" Isabelle nodded with understanding. She didn't expect him to answer right away. \"Good night, then...uh...\" \"Isabelle.\" \"Right,\" he smiled, shaking the hand she had offered him, \"Trevor. See you some other time.\" He walked into his house and shut the door. It was dark outside. The weather was still beautiful; a calming breeze swayed the thin branches on the trees, making creaking sounds that were both eerie and soothing. When she walked back to her house, she looked past the brick walls and into the forest behind. Why Isabelle was drawn to her backyard once more, she wasn't sure. Reaching the burial place of the box, she patted the unearthed dirt that had been piled back into ground to cover up the films. It didn't appear to be touched: the box was still buried safely in the ground where it belonged. A gust of wind blew her hair into her face. She shivered. It was time to go inside and go to bed. Yes, the comforts and warmth of her large, king-sized bed sounded heavenly right then. The house was just as dark as the outdoors had been, but it was much more silent. Not in a calming way, however. She could feel something was different. A scurrying sound could be heard from somewhere above her, so she walked upstairs into her office. There hadn't been anyone or anything there, like she expected, but the sound came back. This time, it could be heard on the third floor. She walked up yet another flight of stairs, only to hear the scurrying coming from the attic. Damned rodents , she cursed to herself. Taking her cellphone out to light up the attic, she scanned the room, still standing on the steps of the latter. And there it was: the box of films that she had found the first day she moved in. Another shiver ran down her spine. How did that get here? She was slightly nervous when she picked up the box. When Isabelle brought back once mroe into her office, she considered another plan of action at getting rid of the sucker. However, it was clear someone wanted her to watch more of the films, so why not? Because the last one was of a family getting murdered, you idiotic little girl! her subconcious reminded her. Rolling her eyes, she took another one of the films. Family Hanging Out '11. After the set up of the projector and the screen, the film started to play. Flashes of a family of five playing football and having a picnic were shown. A little girl with a bright red bow in her hair was swinging on a tire swing. It was strange, however, she didn't look in the least bit enthused about the outing. Suddenly, there was nothing but blackness, and then four people were standing with their hands bound and heads concealed with bags. A ropes were tied around their necks, around the tree branch above them, and tied once more on a branch that was located on the other side of the tree. Something was cutting the branch that held the starting point of the ropes. When the branch broke away almost completely-though, there was just a sliver of it left hanging on-the family started rising up, being suffocated by their lack of ground to stand on. Their feet struggled to find that ground, but it was no use. Finally, they stopped struggling. Isabelle immediately paused the film and turned away. She didn't understand why she let herself watch these things. It made her stood all the much closer on the edge of sanity. Soon, she would be kissing that sanity goodbye and falling into the pit of madness. Wiping away the tears that were streaming down her face, she looked back at the screen. Squinting, she saw an odd shape in the background near a bunch of brush. Walking as close as she could to the image, she found herself staring at an odd looking man...if one could call the figure such. His eyes were shadowed over and so was his mouth. His skin looked a sickly grey color. Was he the one who murdered these families? She shook her head, finding herself truly crazy. She needed sleep before moving on with the films and questions. For now, the films would simply be stuffed in her desk drawer until morning came when she was well rested. Yes, that was a solid solution for the time being. Wait...there was school in the morning. Isabelle moaned as she remembered that before stuffing the whole damned box into the bottom drawer, then headed for bed. She definitely needed some sleep. After school, she drove home as quickly as she could without getting a ticket. At first, Isabelle had been scared of what she had seen in those films. Now that she thought more about them and the figure she had seen last night, the mystery was too great to pass up. She had to find out more about those murders. After all, the police hadn't figured it out...what if she could? And not just for the sake of curiosity, but what if she could find closure for Trevor? When Isabelle got home, she thought thoroughly about where she could get more information. Ellison Oswalt was the man who was an ambitious crime writer and he had moved into the house of the hangings to write a book about it. He was on the correct track, which obviously got him and his wife killed along with his only daughter taken. Therefore, it was also clear that he had quite a lot of information dug up that someone didn't want to be dug up. Rushing to her computer, Isabelle searched the internet for the murder in 2011. It had taken quite some time, but she finally a source of information she could use: Deputy So-and-So, who turned out to be a man named Timothy Henderson. She immediately looke dup the man's number, or at least, the police department's number in that town. When finally getting a hold of them, Isabelle politely asked for a Timothy Henderson. \"Actually, he stopped working here over a decade ago. I'm sorry, is there any other way I can help you?\" \"No,\" Isabelle said politely, feeling disappointed, \"Thank you, though.\" She hung up, typing 'Deputy Timothy Henderson' into the Google search engine. To her surprise, Deputy Henderson had switched to this very town's own police department. Jumping out of her chair, she grabbed her jacket and keys. This man had to know something. He was the last person to speak to Ellison Oswalt before he was brutally murdered with his wife beside him. Deputy So-and-So had to know something more than what the police thought they knew. The Bughuulies: Thank you so much for the comment guys :3 even for those who decided not to join the club . But never fear! You can still join, or completely ignore me and continue reading this story. I'd probably do the latter as well! A few things: SOOOOOO sorry for the extrememly long and annoying author's notes in the previous chapter. Ambie Bambie2: Thank you so much for joining and giving me a suggestion :) It means a lot and really does help me write this story. I will admit, that was the first path I thought to take with this story! InkedCupcake92 : Thank you so much for commenting, and I take it you are joining! Yay! Two Bughuulies so far! We got to stick together, yes? And I'm glad you're happy to hear that there isn't any romance for Trevy. Not sure where you would be if there was, haha :) Thank all to those who have commented! P.S. From now on, The Bughuulies Section (aka: the author's notes) will be at the end of each chapter because I WILL be giving credit to the people who had suggestions that inspired each chapter, and I don't want spoilers in the beginning of the chapters.[Chapter 4] Chapter Four: More Information The police department was a nice mile away from the high school. Probably one of the smartest places to put it in a small town. After all, who hasn't heard of school shootings? They've been happening all over the U.S. since Newtown, Conneticut. After that one shooting back in 2012, more could be heard left and right, which led to a quarter of any town or city's police force stuck in a high school building for eight hours a day. But why should she complain? It's much better than running the risk of students feeling comfortable enough to take a gun and shoot down as many of their peers as they beleive they can. Parking her car in the closest spot she could get to, she hopped out and ran into the department. There were many people in uniforms running around with either weapons or papers in their hands. A few men and women were dressed in suits behind a large desk containing computers, telephones, and even more packets papers. \"Excuse me,\" Isabelle said to the only person not on a telephone: a small lady with a pleasant smile when she noticed she had someone to talk to. \"Is there a Deputy Henderson here?\" The lady nodded, \"Actually, we have two different officers here by the last name Henderson. Is there one in particular you would like to see?\" \"Yes. I believe a Timothy Henderson.\" She chuckled, \"You got lucky. Today is supposed to be his day off, but is co-worker become ill and Timothy had to report to work. I'll go get him. It'll be a few minutes depending on what he's doing at the moment. You may sit over there in one of those chairs, if you like.\" \"Thank you.\" Isabelle walked over to the ugly turqoise chairs that had stuffing from the cushions coming out of it. Clearly, they needed to invest in some nicer chairs. Especially since you could feel the cold metal if you sat just right in it. Fortunately, the wait wasn't anywhere near as long as doctors would make you wait at a hospital or clinic. In fact, she wasn't so sure ten minutes had passed before the kind lady arrived with a man who appeared in his late thirties to early forties. The lady pointed to Isabelle in a gesture of who had requested him personally. She then went back to her station and began taking calls. Isabelle stood up and held out her hand, \"Isabelle Jennings.\" He smiled a quircky kind of smile. It was clear he wasn't a very social fellow... He appeared rather depressed as well. Almost as if he had been through more than he should have the first forty years of his life. \"Timothy Henderson. Is there a problem?\" \"Well, I was just wanting to know if you had about twenty minutes to speak with me in private.\" He nodded, \"Of course. You may come into my office if you like.\" Timothy walked her behind the desks of people taking calls and took her down a narrow hall with multiple offices with names engraved on plaques: Kent Moore, George Smith, Elise Linton, Rebecca Thomas, Henry Jiles, Kacey Padding, Timothy Henderson. \"Ladies first,\" he said after he opened his door and gestured her inside. She walked in and sat down right away in the chair meant for visitors. It was time to get down to business. No more waiting. There was planning to do for school tomorrow, and it was already 5:30 in the evening. Timothy made his way to his desk, then sat down at his chair, \"It's odd you requested me.\" \"I know... Forgive if I may be crossing a line, but I moved into the house of the 2012 murder recently. I believe, as the owner of that house, I have a right to be told the full story.\" \"Actually,\" he corrected with a quircky smile no longer on his face, \"You have a right to know what happened, but not to the full degree. I suggest you move out of that house, Ms. Jennings. It isn't a...safe house to live in. Especially for such a young lady like you. I can't imagine you having any kids...\" he began trailing. In Isabelle's point of view, he completely changed the subject. However, Deputy So-and-So thought otherwise. In fact, what he had to ask was entirely relevant, \"Do you have kids, Ms. Jennings? Or maybe it's Mrs. Jennings?\" Isabelle shook her head. She supposed he needed to warm up to her before he gave her anything she could work with, \"Actually, it's Miss Jennings. I'm not married. Nor do I have any kids.\" Patience, Isabelle, she reminded herself. One of the few things she needed to learn was patience. Normally, she could deal quite well and let people take their time; however, if there was something she wanted, it was difficult to remain patient. He tilted his head in confusion, \"Hmm...I wonder what would happen now...\" \"Excuse me, I'm sorry, but I'm not quite following what you're saying. What does me having a family or not have to do with anything?\" He shrugged unconvincingly, \"Not sure-Please, listen to me. Leave that house.\" Timothy appeared insistant upon her leave. This could be the key to getting that information. On the inside, she smiled, \"I'll make you a deal. Give and tell me all the information you have, and I will move into a house across town.\" He rubbed his eyes with his index finger and thumb. When he looked at her, his eyes were tired and sorrowful, \"Giving you all the information would defeat the purpose of moving away.\" \"How so?\" \"Ms. Jennings, I appreciate you coming directly to me with this and not stirring up the rest of the town with that horrific event, but I must as you to leave. I'm not going to give you information you aren't legally required to have. I'm sorry, really.\" He truly did look sorry...but mostly worried. Timothy stood up, offering his hand to her. She took it and stood up as well, feeling disappointed at how she had come here only to gain no knowledge of the happenings than she had before she drove here. Before he opened the door for her, Isabelle remembered something. It was a risk to say so, but she should at least try to pry more out of this Deputy So-and-So, \"The reason I came was because I found a box of films in my attic. They were horrendous films of the murders that had happened during and before the murder here. I saw a figure in one of them... Have the police tried searching for that figure in the films? Have they even looked at them?\" The second she had mentioned the box of films, his head had whipped back to her, eyes wide. Timothy dropped his hand from the doorknob, \"You saw him ?\" \"Yes, I did. The man with black hair... I couldn't see much of him, though. His eyes and mouth were shadowed over. The image was small as well. Have the police not looked more into that man?\" He gently took hold of both her upper arms and made her sit back down in the visitor's chair. When he sat down in his own chair, his voice was no longer calm, it was rushed with hints of nervousness, \"Alright... dammit. I'll give you what I have and what I know, but on one condition.\" \"Yes, anything.\" \"You can't tell anybody about any of it. No telling of any of the information, that man, the murders, the children...none of it. You can't tell a single person. Ever. Don't even mention anything to the man living next door to you either. Do you hear me?\" His eyes were rid of the tired, depressing emotions. He was now staring at her intently, silently praying none of this would get out to anyone else. \"Trevor? Does he not already know, though?\" \"Oh, no. I'm sure he knows. I'm sure he knows everything there is to know. After all, it was Trevor who was able to receive all of his father's belongings after he died. Including all his research on the murders that soon ended with this... But I guess the murders are starting again... With you.\" A chill ran through her body. No way was she letting herself get murdered when she still had a week left of being twenty-one. Young for a college graduate, yes, but her birthday was September 1st. She had no control over having a very late birthday. \"I believe Ellison Oswalt, the one who was murdered with his wife, had pretty much all the information one could ever dream of on all of these murders. But all the notes, pictures, videos, clips, paintings, stories, and whatever else he had are with Trevor. I honestly cannot give you anything other than a few things I know myself. First, all of the murders have been families with both a husband and a wife along with children. Second, there is always a single child who is taken and never to be seen again. Third, the murders always dealt with those films that you found in your attic. You aren't supposed to watch them, but when you do, the second you move into a different house, you're dead. That's how he keeps the cycle going. Lastly...once you see Bughuul, nothing can save you... And you've already seen him, Ms. Jennings. The only odd thing is that you don't have children. He always takes the children, but you don't have any.\" She nodded and thought for a moment, \"So, I'm safe, right? If it's the children he's after, and I have none, then I'm useless.\" Timothy had to think about the situation as well for a while. \"No, I don't believe you're safe. He will keep tormenting you until you decide to move, he will then find a way to kill you himself, and all he will have to do is wait for the next family to come, hoping they will have children with them this time.\" \"Sounds like you know this man well.\" \"Oh, no. Not well. I believe he needs those children for some reason. They're like...valuable in some sense, but I'm not sure why. I was never able to so much as touch Ellison Oswalt's reports,\" he sighed. \"I'm not quite sure I understand all of this. How does the killer know that someone has seen his image? Is he always spying on me? I think we should bait the man and have a police force in hiding to pop out and arrest him at the right moment!\" He chuckled at her enthusiasm and imagination, but he quickly grew solemn once more. \"This isn't an actual man we are talking about. This is something supernatural and more sinister than you can even comprehend.\" Isabelle sighed. She wanted so badly now to get a hold of Ethan Oswalt's stash of information, but there wasn't any way Trevor would ever let her see it. There had to be some way, and Isabelle was going to find it no matter the extent she will have to take. The Bughuulies: Lady Minuialwen: That means so much to me! Thank you so much for such a wonderful compliment; I appreciate it greatly, and I am happy to hear you enjoy the story so much! Jo: I'm glad you like where this is going! I hope I continue on that path so your enjoyment doesn't end :) mmorgane: Thanks so much! Yes, no romance for long-haired Trevvy! Haha, glad you are happy with that choice that I made! Thanks for commenting! Thank you so much for those who continue to comment! It really truly does help me continue to write this! This story would definitely not have gotten past the first two chapters without you guys. I have, as promised, taken in all the suggestions that you guys have given. I STILL WANT MORE SUGGESTIONS FOR EVENTS/HAPPENINGS/ETC. IT'S REALLY NICE TO GET INTO OTHERS' IMAGINATIONS! P.S. This chapter may have been boring for you guys, but it was actually the most fun for me! Weird, I know. I love you, Bughuulies[Chapter 5] Chapter Five: Night Terrors: Part One \"Do you think Trevor would recognize you from thirteen years ago?\" Isabelle asked Deputy Timothy Henderson. He had walked her to her car after they were done speaking to one another about this sinister man. \"I don't believe so. I've never really met the kid. I only heard things about him.\" \"What if you pretended that you had to take those boxes of information to the police station? Saying something like its evidence to an unsolved crime?\" she suggested in hopes that it wouldn't be long before she could get the box in her possession. \"I'm awful at lying...\" \"Oh, please at least try once.\" He nodded. He, too, was craving to learn something he had to resist for thirteen years now. \"I'll see what I can do. If I do get it...I'll drop by your house or something. Maybe you should look at all that stuff before I see it just to make sure I can handle it. The supernatural...\" he trailed off cringing, \"No way would I be able to spend even five minutes at night at your house,\" he chuckled half-heartedly. When he said it, Timothy seemed to disappear right then, into another time that has long passed. \"Thank you again for all your help.\" He nodded, \"Maybe I'll finally have a new partner in these crimes again.\" Isabelle was finally home. It was 5:55 and there was still three hours left to get school things done. The work only took an hour. A lot less than she expected. Then again, she mostly skimmed the essays and gave a hundred percent if they wrote at least something down. What she was more interested in were her first hour's essays they wrote the other day. Most of what they wrote was completley off, especially the parts about what the killer looked like. He has curly brown hair and is aproximately five-eleven in heighth. The killer has long gray hair and is probably like a hundred years old now. The little girl Ashley was taken, and it was her father who murdered the whole family! Well, the last one was the most intriguing. Had this student not heard that the father of the family was murdered as well? Sighing, she tucked all the graded papers back into her school bag. She began thinking about Deputy Timothy Henderson again. How long will it take him to retrieve the information? Should she occupy her time with those films? Should she get some sleep? Should she simply talk to Trevor and see how he was doing? After all, at the current moment, she as a little anxious. Probably due to not speaking to too many people her own age. She had such a huge house to herself and nobody to share it with. It grew very lonely, very quickly. Films, it is. Getting up from the dining room table, she ran up one flight of stairs and into her office. Looking through the row of films, she picked up Pool Party '66. This was the first murder that had occurred. She cursed herself for putting herself through more gruesome images as she placed the film into the projector. She flipped the switch, lighting up the projection screen. There was a family of five on the screen. Two parents, of course, two girls and a boy. They were all throwing a beach ball around a pear-shaped pool. A boy slid down a slide and into the water. They then were sitting around a patio table with a large umbrella shading them. They ate and drank and chatted happily. That's when the lightness of both the mood and the day vanished. It was now night. A faint light from the camera was barely lighting where it was filming. The camera moved from the lone beach ball floating in the pool to a green vase that was placed on that patio table, and then appeared figures tied to lounge chairs with ropes wrapped around the bars of the chairs. One by one, the chairs were pulled into the water. The families' feets were wiggling as they struggled to breath. Finally, the camera moved to the left, and there he was: the dark man with shadowed eyes, long black hair, and a billowing black trench coat. Once more, Isabelle paused the screen to take in the man in the screen. He certainly didn't look like a man. Maybe he was wearing a mask... Why would he be wearing a mask underwater, then? Maybe it was to make himself look more creepy. Well, if that was what he was aiming for, he most definitely succeeded. She felt herself unable to look away from the figure's face. How in the world was he to stand in the water like that with nothing holding him down? Isabelle plopped herself into the rolling chair behind her desk, leaving the projector screen on. Slow footsteps were echoing above her, which made Isabelle jump. Before deciding to investigate, she let herself listen some a while longer. They were strangly slow; almost like the person was on an evening stroll rather than an intruder probably stealing or wanting to murder somebody. Her first thought was to grab a weapon, but she wasn't intelligent enough to keep one in all hidden corners of the house. The only practical item was a kitchen knife located on the other side of the house and on a separate floor. She could make it quietly, she was sure...or she thought she was sure. After all, the house was larger than any house for one person should be. Sucking in a large breath, Isabelle took silent steps all the way down to the kitchen while the intruder's steps had stopped. Halfway down the stairs, it was too late to stop now, so she made a run for the utensil drawer, expecting the footsteps to pick up after hearing her scramble. Yet, there wasn't a single muffled sound. Nothing. The largest knife in the drawer looked only slightly smaller than a butcher's knife. Good enough. \"Come at me,\" she whispered in an attempt to build confidence in herself for whoever was invading her home. What little courage she had managed to muster vanished completely when the footsteps resounded. This time, they were much smaller, and there was more than one pair of them as well. She prayed, please just be rats...please just be rats. She walked up two flights of stairs, placing herself directly bellow the trapdoor leading to the attic. By now, the footsteps had already receded, silencing the night once more. Isabelle contemplated on whether to search the attic for what she had believed to be intruders and what she had prayed for were rats. Screw this, she thought as another shiver ran down her spine. There was no way she was stooping so low to be as stupid as the characters in all those horror movies were. Instead, she crawled into bed and covered her eyes with the silky sheets. Soon, morning will come. Isabelle woke up to the sound of the projector reverberating. She sat up slowly, listening intently. Yes, the sound was real; she wasn't simply dreaming. Her bedroom was on the same floor as her office, which was both a convenience and an inconvenience. As of right now, it was clearly an inconvenience, and it wasn't so just because it woke her up. It was more than obvious now that there was an intruder; rats weren't knowledgable enough to be able to turn on even something as simple as a Super 8 projector. Now in her office, she saw the projection screen lit up with a projection that looked both familiar and unfamiliar. She hadn't seen this hallway in one of the films, but she recognized the hallway was the one directly outside of the office that she was standing in, but the one on the screen had blood splattered all along the walls. Some of the blotches created sinister images like angry looking dogs or skulls that seemed to be laughing. Isabelle walked closer to the screen. The camera was moving, examining all the images painted in blood. When the camera reached the end of the hallway, it started to zoom out. There was a flicking light coming from the office archway, then the flickering had suddenly stopped. The figure from all those other films as now in full view, coming out of the office on the projector screen. His hair was a black stringy mess, his face so unhuman-like just as she had seen in the pool film. The figure's footsteps were slow, and-God-forbid she think this-graceful. But there was something completely off. I can hear every footstep he makes. That wasn't right. The Super 8 films don't give off any sounds. They are only silent films to be watched, not heard. Just as her focus was back on the screen, the figure disappeared and the footsteps ceased. Then, there was a slight breath in her ear, and she jumped, but dared not to turn around. A sandpaper-like hand barely touched her neck before a piercing scream echoed outside. That scream wasn't hers. The Bughuulies: DUN DUN DUN DUN! Well, I thought it'd be nice to give this chaotic night two parts, so it's going to be a two-part special. Aren't ya'll lucky! I thank every single one of you so much for continuing to read this and bothering to review it. It means so much! I know it took a while for this part to come up, but it got up because I kept on getting reviews! Keep it up:) I love you, Bughuulies![Chapter 6] Chapter Six: Night Terrors: Part Two Isabelle forced herself to turn around, but there wasn't anyone there. The scream pierced through the night again. Checking out the scream actually appeared like a more comforting decision rather than stay put where she had felt breathing and fingers touching her neck. The noise sounded like it was coming from the back end of her house, so she jogged across the kitchen to the back door. Once outside, the screams were closer than Isabelle would have liked to acknowledge. In fact, she was sure that the screams were coming right from the forest fifty feet away. Finally, a figure came into view, shivering and naked. Isabelle recognized Trevor's long hair and plump lips. However, his eyes were closed and he was in fetal position. She had never seen any scene such as this, and she had no idea how to help. Crouching down, she tried shaking him awake, but it didn't work. She began to worry that something was seriously wrong with him. \"Trevor,\" she said, continuing to shake him, \"What's wrong? What's happening?\" Nothing seemed to unfaze him. \"Look at me, Trevor! Wake up! Open your eyes.\" She slapped his face a few times, then held it still in her hands, \"Look at me!\" His eyes fluttered slightly before opening as wide as a deer's in headlights. Even in the darkness, Isabelle could make out Trevor's beat-red face, and when he realized the state he was in: butt-naked and being held close to her. Isabelle became just as red. She got up, turned away, then stripped herself of her pajama bottoms. \"Um...you can wear these while you go to your house,\" she suggested as she tossed them behind her, not daring to look back. Only slightly could she hear that he was actually putting them on. \"Thank you,\" he mumbled. \"I'm sorry for all the commotion. Uh, I should go to bed... I'll wash these and give them back tomorrow.\" \"No need to rush in giving them back. Are you sure there isn't anything else I could do for you?\" There was a pause. It was quite a few seconds before he finally answered, \"Is everything okay with you?\" She was utterly confused now. \"What do you mean?\" \"It was a simple and straight-to-the-point question,\" he said rather harshly. So there's the old Trevor that she had first met. \"I'm quite dandy, thank you,\" she answered in just as a harsh voice. Another pause, then Trevor seemed to mumble something to himself that clearly wasn't meant for her to hear, but she had anyways, \"Alright, as long as its the truth.\" When the cool breeze of the night brushed against her bare legs, she decided to walk towards her house, not looking back at Trevor. The only sound she heard the entire way to the back door was her own footsteps. Not once did she hear Trevor's until after she shut that back door. Unfortunately for Isabelle, the morning came too soon. It was unknown what time she actually went to bed, but it was clear that it wasn't at a decent time. Stretching, she took a quick shower, dried her hair, changed into decent clothes, and headed towards the high school. After the first class piled in and the bell rang, Billy raised his hand, but spoke without even being called upon, \"You have bags under your eyes, Ms. Jennings.\" Isabelle gave a snarky smile, \"Why thank you, Billy, that's so kind of you.\" Julie began talking next, \"Did you finally go crazy in that house? Did you start hearing things? Sometimes, after being consistantly told a house is haunted, one starts to imagine things; however, ghosts don't actually exist. A lot of people think they do because-\" \"Shut up, Julie. Just because you are upset about never having seen a ghost, doesn't mean you get to automatically claim that they aren't real,\" Billy mocked her. \"Alright, alright,\" Isabelle said, \"Enough talk about the house. I have books to hand out that you are all expected to pick and read over the course of the next three weeks.\" Most of the class groaned minus a few guys and girls including Julie, whom were all excited to finally dig into the curriculum of English. \"Come on, now. At least I let you guys choose your book rather than force you to read super old literature,\" she chuckled. Isabelle went to the storage room in the back of the classroom and dug out the boxes of novels, which included a range of classic to modern literature. It was a better strategy to give the class not only the choice, but a variety as well to encourage them to read more. A majority of the class, of course, went with more modern books, but those who are avid readers picked otherwise. Isabelle was pleased, for the class didn't seem to groan as much when they discovered the extensive stack of books. The process of choosing was actually a lot less organized, which made it more fun. Isabelle simply tossed books left and right all throughout the room. Every student simply got to wander around, chatter, and whatnot while they picked. This was not only a bonus for the students, but for the teacher as well. Last night-she was sure it went into early this morning as well-was rough. Exhausted, she wasn't sure if she could have done much more than let the students do their own thing while she processed earlier events. A minute before the bell rang, all she had to do was force herself into the current moment and say, \"Now that you all have your books, your first assignment is to finish one chapter over the weekend and discuss to the class what is happening in the book so far.\" Perfect timing, the bell rang and everyone left. Six more periods to go. Home sweet home. And right as she is ready to relax, all comfortable in pajamas, the doorbell rings loud throughout the house. Isabelle forced herself off the couch in the living, walking over to the front door. It was Deputy So-and-So. \"What are you-\" she began but was surprised to see three boxes all around his feet, and a triumphant grin plastered on his face. \"I did it! I was able to retrieve the boxes! I think it was due to Trevor not wanting these damned suckers in the first place... He seemed mighty happy when I said I had to take them away. Here you go!\" He picked up a box, handing it to Isabelle, and then picked up that last two and walked inside, setting them down on the island counters in the elegant kitchen. \"Wow...\" he whispered. \"This place is huge.\" Turning to the owner of the home, he said in a normal voice, \"Does it get lonely in this big house all by yourself? Especially knowing all you do about the murder...\" Has it gotten lonely? No...lonely wasn't the right word. Although, she did miss having family living with her. Even a lover was something she always dreamed of having, but clearly nobody found her appealing. She shook her head. That was not the matter at hand. \"No, not really. I kind of like it by myself.\" Small white lies never hurt anybody. Especially when the truth doesn't concern anybody. \"Is there any place you want these? Like an office or something?\" She nodded, \"Yes, follow me.\" They both re-picked up the boxes and set them in her office with the projector still planted on that large box in the middle of the room. Just how the projector should be: off and silent. The boxes were set on top of the desk, covering it almost entirely. It was so plain that she had a lot of work to do. Work that didn't even involve getting paid. But hopefully, it would be worth, and hopefully, she would find a way to stop whoever this person or creature is. \"I appreciate this a lot,\" Isabelle said to the deputy. He nodded, \"Though, I don't think you should thank me. This stuff is pretty serious. Be careful alright?\" She nodded in reply. Isabelle then walked Deputy Henderson out with one last thank you, watching him drive off. And now, it was finally time to get down to business. It was nearing eight o clock and all she found were notes on just the murders and questions that Ellison had that were more detective-like than anything: where's Stephanie, how did the box get in the attic, etc. Moving on to the next box, she found photos and contacts. The photos held a strange symbol that seemed repeatedly painted in a dark red on various places: walls, a vehicle... It was the same symbol she saw in the film Sleepy Time '98. She took out the films from her desk drawer to examine them. She had watched Sleepy Time '98, Pool Party '66, and Family Hanging Out '11. The other ones she had yet dared to touch. Should she watch another one or save herself the horror? It was tempting for some odd, twisted reason. Shaking her head and scolding herself, she shoved the films back into the drawer. There were more photos than just of those symbols. There were enlarged imagines of the one behind all the chaos: Bughuul, as the deputy called him. \"Bughuul,\" she whispered to herself, \"What sick game are you playing?\" It saddened her to be reminded of the families that had to die...even the children that died. How can anyone be so cold hearted as to murder such innocent little human beings? No , she scolded to herself, this isn't a normal human being we are talking about. There was a loud bang, interrupting her focus on the creature in the photo. She looked above her to where the sound came from. It all honesty, the creepy noises, banging, thuds, and footsteps were beginning to get quite old. So old, that Isabelle was no longer scared. She was annoyed. Having been prepared this time, she grabbed a kitchen knife that she had decided to keep on the desk while she was researching. Walking upstairs, she looked in every room that surrounded the office below. Her last destination: the master bathroom. And in it was a message written in marker across the large mirror: It's you. The Bughuulies: I AM SO SO SO SORRY THAT IT TOOK SO LONG! BUGHUUL HASN'T EATEN MY SOUL, I SWEAR! You know how high school is...so much stupid tests and homework. I will continue this story, don't worry :) Thank you to all those who reviewed! LadyEpic101: Bagel. Haha! Bagels are nummy! :3 By the way, have you kicked a whale's anus yet? PLLML: Of course you can join! Welcome, fellow Bughuulie :) I'm happy that you have joined our little cult, haha! And yes, the romance seems very popular, so I just might decide to go with it. Thanks so much for reviewing, fellow Bughuulie! xLunaAngelWarriorx: Yes! You are entirely welcomed! The more Bughuulies, the scarier as we always say. I so much appreciate you reviewing! I'm happy to hear you enjoy the story. The romance thing with Bughuul is already into consideration now that you and so many others want to read that. I really love all the ideas and suggestions you have given me! I will definitely see if I can do something with a few of them. Thanks again :) You all don't know how much I appreciate each and every review. The only motivation I have for continuing stories is mostly because you guys tell me you enjoy it. I hope you all keep it up and stay patient with me if I get caught up in all the school crap! Two months to go and I will be free to give you crap loads of Bughuul-ness![Chapter 7] A/N: I'm so so so sorry for the long period of absence. Like I said, school is a big fat *****. Anyway, I am back and so happy to be back as well as happy to see so many reviews. I just hope you Bughuulies haven't given up on me! To make up for the long absence, I decided to get on with this story to the point where the real fun begins. TODAY, YOU WILL READ MY VERSION OF BUGHUUL AND HIS LIKE-NESS. DISCLAIMER: I HAVE MADE UP MY OWN VERSION OF BUGHUUL'S LEGEND. FORGIVE ME IF YOU LIKE THE ORIGINAL BETTER THAN THIS ONE. SORRY! But for the sake of making this story my own, I made up a legend to kind of fit the whole story I came up with and the ideas you all have given. I pray you do enjoy :) NOTE: Sorry if I mix up the days of the week and the timeline and stuff. I do have issues with that :/ Chapter Seven: The Sinister Legend A chill ran throughout her entire body. After a few moments of staring at the writing, she began laughing to herself. It could have been blood, it could have been blood, she repeated over and over. Well, Isabelle wasn't sure how to react to this situation considering she had never been in such a situation. Should she call the police? Ask Trevor to come and investigate or to keep her company? None of those ideas sounded appropriate. For starters, she made a promise to Deputy So-and-So not to get anyone involved or tell anyone of Bughuul. And lastly, Trevor wouldn't do much nor was he a friend of sorts. At least, on his part it was clear he didn't care to be a friendly kind of neighbor. Issy sighed and walked into her office to retrieve a few dry erase markers. It was clear that the marker used on her mirror was a permanent one and for some odd reason, going over permanent with dry-erase seemed to get rid of it. Going back into the bathroom and looking at the writing again gave the same electric chill. What did these two words even mean? Who's you? Why her? What about her? She watched the red marker cover the black and then rubbed it away with papertowels. It was apparent that Isabelle needed to solve this mystery fast before someone actually does get hurt. Which was another thing: what was going on with Trevor and his episode the other night? He was so out of it...so vulnerable...so scared. Timothy did say something about the supernatural. Could this supernatural creature torment Trevor without so much as stepping a foot outside her house? If that was the case she needed an expert on taking out the supernatural. Like a priest or something. Luckily, Ellison Oswalt left a phone number and Skype account to contact Professor Jonas, an expert on such legends. Phone calls appealed to her more. She decided to sleep the night off and wait to call him in the morning \"Hello?\" a deep, raspy voice answered. A harsh cough soon followed. \"Ah, yes, is uh a Mr. Jonas there?\" \"I am him. Who is this?\" \"Isabelle Jennings. I obtained your number from the late Ellison Oswalt's old research from thirteen years ago, about the legend of a man named Bughuul.\" There was a ragged chuckle on the other line, \"You mean the legend of a supernatural creature that is merely just a story and not much more?\" \"Sure,\" Isabelle said, holding in an impatient sigh. \"What questions do you have?\" \"I want to know the entire legend of Bughuul. Anything and everything to possibly know about him.\" \"Hmm... Tell you what, I have an article somewhere in my mess of papers with everything I've found on that legend. Mind you, it might take me a day or so to find it. I can mail all my research on that legend including the article if you like.\" There was some more coughing and sputtering. \"Not too well these days. Don't think I will find that stuff of much value or use to me anymore.\" Isabelle felt a sick sort of excitement, \"That would be absolutely fantastic. Thank you so much!\" \"Of course, goodbye, Miss Isabelle.\" The line went dead. Now all she had to do was wait patiently for that article and other findings. Hopefully she wouldn't have to wait more than a week. At least she would get all the original stuff from a professor. Now that was pretty darn cool. In the mean time, she would have to occupy her time with the rest of Mr. Oswalt's findings. Not that there was much left she hadn't already read. There were also the films. She had yet to watch all of them as well. Maybe- The ringing of her doorbell sounded throughout the house. Isabelle ran downstairs and to the front door. To much surprise, she saw Trevor standing there with her clean pajama pants folded neatly in his hands. \"Uh... Thanks again,\" he said sort of awkwardly, but not taking his eyes from her face. Isabelle took her pants from him, flashing a small smile, \"Not a problem. You're okay, right?\" \"Mhm. Well, I should be heading home... Lot of stuff to do.\" He began walking down her porch before she could answer him. Shutting the door, she tossed her pants aside, wishing she had those papers of that professor's. Nothing had made her more happy than when she opened her mailbox a week and a half later to a very large box of papers. Not as large as one of Ellison Oswalt's boxes, but still bigger than she had expected. Actually, she was expecting a yellow packet folder, not any sort of box. Boxes were better...because they were bigger...which meant more information. Isabelle sat down in her desk chair and destroyed the top opening of the box. She took out all the papers, throwing the cardboard aside. To be honest, she was hoping to find some sort of way out of the hauntings she was tossed into. Instead, she read the horrors of what Professor Jonas had found and written into a nice, summarized article . The legend of Bughuul is such an ancient legend, the original must be completely obscured by now. However, it is sacred drawings of old tribes from thousands of years ago that lead me to believe his true craving: children. What the children are truly for is still vague. I have researched many different reasons as to why such a deity would want these innocent beings. The most logical reason is to feed off their souls. They are such naive, simple creatures to attain, so it would be most practical for Bughuul to feast off them if he never wished to fight through a challenge. Other rumors and myths of this legend for reasons are as follows: souvenirs after murdering a family as do a lot of serial killers of today, company all to himself, children for his lover. The last of these three was also into consideration due to another rumor of Bughuul having a rough childhood. His childhood is quite a story within itself. As far as I have heard/read, Bughuul was once as normal of a human being as the next guy. His parents never took proper care of him, he was neglected, never went to school, kids next door would tease and hurt him. He began playing with dark magic which soon led to the corruption of his very soul, leaving him no longer human, but a demonic deity. Having never been loved by anyone, he is eager to seek out his \"soulmate\". However, this idea isn't logical due to how old he would be today. Other additions to this version of the legend include this mysterious lover to be fond of children, but she herself is incapable of being able to have her own. Which is precisely why Bughuul takes all these children alive: for her. If this mysterious lady were to ever truly love him as he seemingly would her, it is said that Bughuul would stop the massacres of these families. But as I have already written, Bughuul is more likely to consume the souls of the children because he needs to feed off of them. He does this by crossing worlds through videos and images. By moving from his torturous haunting, a family would be immediately slaughtered with a child missing as well. I have yet to hear of anyone who has yet to move while seeing Bughuul's image, but- So on and so forth. Isabelle knew most of the rest. She didn't care to read it. Was there more to this story than any one of them (i.e. herself, Professor Jonas, Ellison, and Henderson) could have ever comprehended? A shiver ran down her spine, tears brimming her eyes as she picked up her phone. For a long while, she stared at it unsure whether she might be crazy or not. What if it was just a trick? Just a burglar? Kids pulling pranks? Trevor trying to shoo her off? Maybe this very article was the joke. Maybe it was Jonas's last dying wish to mock her with the fact that a deity was looming around her house, breathing on her neck, watching her every move, writing messages on her mirror, and there wasn't a single thing she could do about it. It was worth a try despite all of it. Isabelle dialed the number, hearing it ring. She still couldn't help but feel more than just scared...she felt almost violated in some kind of way. \"Hello?\" a nice lady's voice answered. It took a moment for Isabelle to answer, still confused as to what exactly she was thinking. \"Uh...yes... I want to make an appointment for a check-up,\" Isabelle finally replied. \"Alright, what is your name?\" \"Isabelle Jennings.\" There were some scratching sounds of a pen on paper heard from the other line. \"And could you state any concerns you may have, so the doctor knows what he or she is checking for.\" \"Yes... Um...I think I might be infertile.\" DUNDUNDUNDUNNNNNN! The Bughuulies: Still sorry this thing is late! To those who have given me any sort of suggestions to move this story along: Thank you so much for your help with my story. All of the ideas are great and I can't wait to use them! Don't worry, credit will be given. IF I HAVE USED SOMETHING AND FORGOTTEN TO GIVE CREDIT, PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE TELL ME. Thank you \"By\" for realizing the stupid mistake I made. I can't believe I got the character's and the actor's name mixed up! HAHA! the noah clans pure madness: OF COURSE YOU CAN JOIN! WE WOULD BE SO HAPPY TO HAVE YOU :D breathe: I don't think I will have much insight on the children's friend's thoughts, but some other insights will be added, no doubt! drawnoflife: Yes, join! We are glad to have you in our lil ol club! Thanks for reviewing! Again, thank you all for reviewing, it means so much! I will try to update sooner especially since it's summer and I have nothing better to do! A/N: There is still details left out of the legend, obviously, so I will put more in later (most likely the next chapter, don't know, we will see, but it will come eventually!)...That kind of rhymed darn it![Chapter 8] Chapter Eight: The Horrors Continue Just a few more hours, she thought to herself as she put on a pair of black dress pants. All Isabelle needed to do was last until school ended, and she could go on her way to the clinic on the other side of town. Throughout the day her mind kept finding its way back to the subject of Bughuul. Since the beginning, she thought all the happenings, coincidences, and whatnots were mere jokes. Finally, Isabelle started to consider the counter-thought: what if it was all real? If the legends were true, a part of her felt bad for the creepy man in the long black jacket. If the legends were true, another part was angry that the psycho would dare approach families in such horrific ways. If the legends were true, there might not be any way out of this supernatural mess. She might have to live her life forever in that big, empty house with a deity that wanted to torment her into...what? Loving him? That didn't sound right. Isabelle shook her head as the last bell of the day rang. She tucked away all her folders and school supplies into her black bag, quickly heading out the door. But sadly only to be stopped by the school principal. \"Miss Jennings, I have been hearing great reviews about you,\" said the thirty-three year old woman. She had a nice head of thick, black hair that curled right at her shoulders. \"Not only from the students, but from the staff as well. I'm happy to have you on board at this high school.\" She tried putting on her best smile to hide her thinning patience, \"Thank you. I do love it here, and I would also love to stay and chat, but I have a doctor's appointment in ten minutes.\" \"Oh, sorry to hold you back. Maybe we can chat over your lunch break tomorrow afternoon?\" she asked with a slight raise of her right brow. \"Yeah, sure, sounds great.\" Isabelle gave a nod, then burst into a fast walk to her vehicle. God only knew how much she was truly dreading the coincidence she was sure to hear from the doctor. \"Yes, you are in fact infertile due to early menopause.\" Isabelle stared at the doctor slightly dumbfounded, \"But I'm twenty-two; that doesn't make any sense.\" \"There are many cases of early menopause in which the cause is unknown. You are one of those many cases. I'm sorry to have broken such news to you. Did you have a husband or some significant other you wanted to have help when breaking the news to or-\" \"No. No, thank you. I guess I will be on my way. Thanks for the check up.\" She checked out of the clinic, heading for her car in deep thought. She suspected something off in her female organs. She hadn't ever had regular cycles. In fact, the last cycle she had was when she was nineteen years of age. That seemed like ages ago. Isabelle finally hit a bump in the road. She was infertile, so what? That didn't actually prove anything, did it? The only thing it proved was that if she ever wanted to have her own children whom are flesh and blood, she was tough out of luck. However, that didn't mean this supernatural creature existed. But I saw him in the films. Then again, those were films. They could have been edited, or it could have been a trick of the lighting. Looking at the clock, it was nearing dinner time. Right on cue, her stomach rumbled in demand for something to eat. Isabelle put the car in drive and took off out of the parking lot. Once she got home she ate some leftovers from the previous night...or maybe that had been two nights ago... Now she couldn't remember. Hopefully, most of the things that have happened were just of her imagination. Maybe her brain was so overwhelmed with the horrific murders of the families in the films that she had made up everything after in her head. Isabelle's phone rang right after she finished her meal. She answered with a weary hello. \"Hello, Ms. Jennings, this is Deputy So-and-So,\" a chirpy voice said on the other line. \"I was just curious to know whether or not you found anything new in Oswalt's boxes?\" \"Not a whole lot...\" she trailed off. A small part of her was considering whether she should mention the new findings she found in that article the professor had sent, but even she was still trying to wrap her head around it. Even she thought the legend was the most proposterous myth she had ever heard of, so what would the deputy think? \"Well, if you do I'll give you my home phone number so you can call me. Or, you can call me if you ever need anything.\" \"Thanks, I appreciate it.\" Isabelle wrote the number down thinking that she would never actually call him for anything. Especially of the new legend she believed was the true one that fit with it all almost perfectly. He hung up the phone, leaving her entirely alone in that big, empty house. Sadly, it was already night and nearing ten o' clock. She would have to rise early for yet another day of teaching. Not to mention a lunch date with the principal. That ought to be a great time , she thought chuckling to herself. It wasn't that she didn't like her boss, but it was more of the fact that she didn't like socializing with others. Especially bosses. It made her nervous and break out into a cold sweat. Isabelle walked up to her room to change into comfortable clothes for the night. It wasn't long after crawling into bed when she heard little sobbing sounds outside her bedroom door. They sounded like a little girl crying. She shivered, not knowing whether this was a trick again. However, if a child was sobbing, clearly she needed help. Sighing huskily at herself, she climbed out of bed and put a hand cautiously on the door knob. The sobs still continued, so she opened her door and peered into the direction of it. Issy listened again walking completely out of her room. The cries seemed to come from the ground floor. As soon as she made it quietly to the first floor, she expected to be heard; therefore, ceasing the sounds, but that was not the case. Her tentative listening led her to the kitchen. And there, looking out of a window, was a little girl with red hair. The girl placed a longing hand on the windowpane as she furthered her sobbing. Isabelle wasn't sure whether to simply get her attention, ask her a question, or just walk up to her. Finally deciding, she said, \"Little girl, are you alright?\" The girl quickly turned around. Her complexion was paler than anyone Isabelle had ever seen, and her eyes were a puffy red from all the sobbing. The little one wiped her nose with the back of her hand then side-stepped away from the window. \"Can you tell me what's wrong? Where are your parents?\" The little girl swallowed, looking slightly conflicted as if she had a few select options on how to react, but she didn't know which to pick. Suddenly, the girl shuttered and looked upwards at the ceiling. \"He's coming,\" she whispered. Isabelle believed she knew exactly who he was. She quickly picked up the girl in her arms. \"Don't worry, I have a great hiding place,\" she said as she ran to the basement door, flinging it open. She ran down the stairs as quietly as she could. \"There isn't anywhere I can hide,\" the girl frowned, \"Especially when I'm with you.\" Issy went through many rooms and hallways to find the small door that used to be used as hiding place for runaway slaves. She put the little girl inside, climbed in herself, shut the door, and turned on the small bulb in the low ceiling so she could see. \"What do you mean by that? Why do I give you away when you try to hide?\" Isabelle started to feel like her reactions weren't right in the least bit. What she should have done was take the girl outside and ask her which direction her house was in. She should have grabbed her phone and dialed 911 to tell them there was a strange girl in her home for who knows what reason. There were many logical things she should have done, but she chose the one that nobody else would. Why was that? For starters, there is a deity in your house who appears to love tormenting you in your own home. Her own thoughts on the subject vanished when the girl finally spoke, \"He almost always knows where you are at. Or at least when you're near.\" \"How?\" The girl examined Isabelle's face. There seemed to be a growing hope in her eyes...a sort of happiness seemed to be building inside her. \"You could free him... You could free us-Shh! He's coming,\" she whispered, the happiness and hope vanishing from her irises. \"I must go,\" the girl said in almost an irrational manner, \"To keep you safe, I have to go back.\" \"Go back where? Girl, you need to go back to your p-\" She smiled before Isabelle could complete her sentence,\"My name is Ashley.\" Isabelle's memory wasn't the greatest, but she remembered Ellison Oswalt's family. His only daughter went by the name of Ashley. \"Is your last name Oswalt?\" She nodded, seemingly happy that Isabelle was catching on. \"But you're supposed to be, what? In your twenties by now? Listen, I'm not in the least bit a fan of jokes, pranks, or lies, so you better tell me where you live or I won't hesitate to call the police.\" There was a creak above their heads just as Ashley was ready to defend who she truly was. The girl looked back at Isabelle with a hint of fright, \"I-I can't tell if he's angry or not since I wandered off... He knows where we are!\" Isabelle got out of the hiding spot and took Ashley with her. Thank God Issy was smart enough to place a weapon in almost every corner of the house including the basement. She picked up a small kitchen knife and headed quietly upstairs with Ashley on her hip. All she had to do was make it to the back door, which was approximately twenty feet from the basement door. She could make, she kept telling herself. But as soon as she opened the door, a dark figure stood right in front of them. Ashley grabbed hold of the figure's black trench coat and pulled herself to him while Isabelle let out a scream before tumbling down the stairs. For Isabelle, everything went dark. Ashley wanted to cry, she didn't mean to wander off and have Isabelle catch her. But at the same time, she was angry. It was his fault she was now injured. Finding some courage, Ashley looked up at Bughuul, her gaurdian (in Ashely's mind guardian is in use for lack of a better word) for over thirteen years now, \"You shouldn't have scared her. You should have left her alone.\" She watched him turn sorrowfully away from her, walking down the stairs towards Isabelle's still body. The Bughuulies: Okay, okay, I know I suck at updating. :( I'm aweful to you guys! But I do appreciate all the feedback and reviews and PM's you guys give me! It fills my heart with happiness :) A/N: this chapter was difficult to finish because of lack of knowing what to do next, so if any of you have any ideas of events/situations/etc. please PM me or something! THANK YOU Thehalfbloodprince for giving me some ideas that I inserted to the best of my abilities into this chapter. I was stuck, but you helped me out! Important : I decided not to make the children all weird looking with the dirt/purple, blue stuff/or whatever made them look lifeless in the film because that clearly represented that the life was being sucked (eaten) out of them. And with my story, I don't want to make that the case, so they don't look lifeless or zombie-creepy like in the films. Instead, they are simply really pale from lack of sun. :) Hopefully the next chapter will be longer since this one was short.[Chapter 9] A/N: I'm so sorry, but for my own entertainment, I am going to be butchering the character of Bughuul :/ I was thinking about it, and there wasn't any way to keep his perfect scary, heartless image yet have my legend and the way this story is suppose to go fit. So, Bughuul won't be completely hiself from the films. If you don't like it, you can always make your own story. I would read it! Just bear with me on this story and let's see how it plays out, please :D Chapter Nine: Little Friends There was a rhythmic beeping sound that seemed to sooth her thoughts as she slowly came back to consciousness. She felt her head first, noticing a few stitches closing up her sliced skin. Grogginess still lingered, but she was able to open her eyelids and take in her surroundings. Isabelle felt a heavy weight on her left hand. She tried lifting her fingers, but it was difficult. Glancing down, she saw Ashley fast asleep with her cheek planted firmly on her hand. Slightly odd. Isabelle tried moving her other arm, but it felt achy and sore all over. In fact, her whole body felt like it had been kicked and punched repeatedly by a gang of body-builders. She closed her eyes, scolding herself for trying to move more after figuring out how in pain she was. \"Are you doing alright?\" a voice asked from the doorway. And just like that, little Ashley had disappeared, relieving her of the pressure on her hand. Looking up, she saw Trevor walk into her hospital room with a chicken wrap and milk. \"I figured you would be hungry after days of being fed with only liquid.\" He handed her the small meal. Surprisingly, she managed to say thank you. \"What happened?\" Isabelle asked trying to recall the last time she was awake. \"You fell down some stairs. I'm thankful I was able to hear your scream and bothered checking up on you,\" he kind of chuckled, trying to make light of whatever situation Isabelle was in. She remembered, though. She remembered trying to save a little girl from that figure. Where was that girl now? \"Di-\" she breathed in, trying to find the energy to speak in long sentences, \"Did you see a little girl when you went into my house? Or just now when you walked in?\" He gave her a questioning look, then a doctor a few nurses walked in, flocking around Isabelle. She was thankful that their questions were fairly quick. The only important thing they told her was that she could go home the next day after being examined for one night. Simple enough, but she wasn't so sure she wanted to be left alone at night. Especially when that meant she had all the time in the world to think about the events prior to the fall. After the doctors left, Trevor sat back down in the chair next to her bed that Ashley had sat in earlier. Where did she disappear to? \"What was your sister like?\" Isabelle asked. \"Why are you asking such strange and random questions? Maybe you fell too hard...\" \"Just tell me about your sister, please,\" Isabelle said rashly. Her patience-especially since she was in pain-was wearing thin. \"Alright, alright... Well, she was cute. Some of the time, anyway. When she wasn't painting unicorns on the walls of our bedroom. When we did share a bedroom that is,\" he smiled. As he got more and more into Ashley and who she was, he seemed to float off into a far away place. The way he described her was fitting with the little time she spent with the Ashley she had met. But her Ashley was more sad and frightened during that time. Hours later, Trevor was still talking when the doctor came in to tell him visiting hours were over. It was now past ten and though she had been out for days, Isabelle was growing tired. At least, tired of having outsiders in the room. I.e. having people who knew nothing of what she was dealing with in the evenings at her home when nobody else was around. After everybody scrambled out of her room, Ashley had appeared once more by the side of her bed. She looked a bit happier than she had ever seen her thus far and that warmed Isabelle a bit. \"How did you get in here?\" Isabelle asked. \"I think you know the answer to that,\" she said, hopping up onto the bed right beside her thighs. She gave a closed, wide smile, \"I'm no longer normal. I'm under the protection of the supernatural now.\" \"Protection? You were frightened! If you were protected, why be afraid?\" \"Well, I haven't been with him that long. All I know for sure is that he protects us. I still haven't figured out his anger pattern...what makes him perform evil acts...\" Ashley turned away in thought. \"Him. The figure at the top of the stairs?\" She nodded, \"His name is Bughuul, but us children call him Mr. Boogie. It's better than calling him daddy.\" Ashley gave a half-hearted chuckle, probably remembering her own father from long ago. \"You were crying at the window. Why?\" The little girl frowned now. \"My brother. I guess I haven't gotten over how I can't ever speak to him again. I just saw him reading in his bedroom, and I remember when my parents would read stories to him and I before bed. I wish I could hug him. I can't believe how handsome he's grown. Even if he still has that long, stringy hair,\" she laughed. Isabelle smiled at Ashley's admiration for her older brother. But what the child asked next surprised her. \"Could you be my friend? I mean, there are other kids...even another girl my age, but I want somebody who is close to my brother, somebody on the outside.\" \"I would love to be your friend, but I'm not that close to your brother.\" \"I think he likes you.\" Isabelle blinked a few times, \"What?\" \"He doesn't love you, but he definitely wants you as a friend. I can tell. I think it's because he doesn't get out much.\" Issy laughed. That's what she meant. Isabelle did dislike how there were different forms of the word \"like\". \"Will you be his friend for me since I can't be there?\" Ashley asked with desparation in her eyes. \"Of course I will,\" she answered, feeling sorry for the girl. How lonely she must have been living such a life. Where did she go when Isabelle couldn't see her then? Where did he go when she didn't see him? Wait, was she now giving into the truth that there was a supernatural deity or whatever wandering the halls of her home and children trapped with him? It had to be the truth. After all, how does a little girl appear and disappear without anybody noticing? Looking at the pale, small girl, Isabelle couldn't help but believe it all to be true. Everything thus far seemed to fit. Especially her diagnosis. There were far too many coincidences to simply pass Bughuul off as merely a legend. The legend had to be true. \"Thank you. I think I should go check on Mr. Boogie and the rest. I don't want to get into trouble. I will see you tomorrow, Issy,\" she smiled, walking out the door and vanishing. The next day, Isabelle checked out of the hospital and hitched a ride from Trevor. She thanked him when they stopped in front of her house. Just as she was about to shut the car door, she turned back to him, \"Would you like to have dinner at my house again tonight?\" Surprisingly, he didn't bother to find an excuse out of the invite, \"Sure. What time?\" \"Seven sounds good.\" \"I'll be at your house at seven then,\" he smiled, and then she shut the door, watching him drive back to his house. Friends. She could do that for Ashley. Maybe if he was over she could see him... Maybe they would be able to converse. No, that was probably too far. She wasn't sure how the whole ordeal worked with Bughuul's world and theirs. When she walked into the house, she noticed her phone was ringing on the kitchen counter. The ID read Mom. \"Hello?\" Isabelle answered, walking up the stairs to her bedroom. She had the rest of the week off, so she planned on spending it in her comfortable clothes. There wasn't any time to waste. \"Oh goodness, sweetheart, we are so sorry! We were out of town when the doctors called us. I can't believe this happened and we missed the call! I'm so sorry we-\" \"Mom, it's okay. It was a slight fall, but I'm alright now. It isn't that big of a deal.\" \"You went unconscious for a few days! Of course it's a big deal-oh your father wants to speak to you.\" There was a small crackling as the phone was handed over to her dad. \"Hey. How's my little girl after the fall? Still strong?\" Isabelle rolled her eyes, \"Of course, Dad. Last time I checked, however, twenty-two wasn't little.\" \"You still have a few weeks to go before your twenty-two, so until then you are my little girl.\" \"Oh, so when I do, you will stop calling me that?\" \"Hmm...nope.\" She laughed, \"Well, thanks for calling in, but I should probably get to work.\" \"Hey, now, don't exert yourself after that fall.\" \"Whatever you say, Dad. Goodbye now.\" \"I love you. No more falling down the stairs,\" he added before hanging up. A chuckle escaped her lips before she finally switched out her uncomfortable clothes into her comfy ones. Sweats. There was no better man-made material than sweatpants. After changing, she began heating up some fries from the freezer. While she waited, she reread Professor Jonas's article. He claimed to know so much about Bughuul, but there wasn't anything further on the legend she believed was true. He only went in-depth with the legend he believed was true, which clearly doesn't seem correct because if it was, Ashley looked pretty alive for a girl whose soul was being eaten by a deity. That was another thing: deity. Bughuul was not in any way shape or form a deity. If he was, he could have easily taken her anyway he wanted at any time without trouble, right? But he hasn't, so there must be limits. Deities don't have limits. Sighing, she tossed the article aside. It was useless now. There wasn't anything to further her knowledge on how to be rid of Bughuul. What if there was? Did that mean Ashley would have to leave too? What would happen to her? It wouldn't be fair to take her away from Trevor. God only knows what it's like to have been taken away from family with no hope or light. Just fear and darkness. Isabelle then wondered if there was anyway to free the children. She chuckled to herself. She was becoming too obsessed with the whole ordeal. The oven beeped, signaling that the fries were cooked and ready to eat. Isabelle pulled them out, blowing on one of the fries and stuffing it into her mouth, savoring the taste. \"Issy?\" Isabelle jumped at the sound of her name being spoken by Ashley. When she turned around she saw quite a few kids behind the little girl. Ashley gave her a big smile, \"We wanted to welcome you back home and tell you how happy we are that you are okay.\" Isabelle only stared at them wide-eyed while Ashley continued, \"I should introduce you to the rest of us.\" Ashley pointed to each child and said their name. A few she recognized from the Super 8 films. The boy from 'Sleepy-Time' went by the name of Henry, the one from 'Pool Party' was named Jack, the boy with curly locks and darker skin than the rest of the children was named Michael, the blond little girl was Sarah, and last but not least was Stephanie, the little girl with a bright red ribbon in her hair and who was in 'Family Hanging Out'. She shivered as she remembered the films she had watched. And she had connected the dots. It had been the children who killed their families. These innocent children who stood now in her kitchen had killed their families. But it hadn't been their fault. They were drawn into the darkness, manipulated, acting like puppets to do the dirty work for him...that creature. \"Will you play hide and go seek with us, Issy?\" Henry asked. Isabelle looked around, \"Won't you guys get into trouble?\" \"He isn't here right now. Hasn't been since he placed you in your bed after your fall,\" Ashley explained, her smile soft. \"I'm sorry, who did what now?\" The children giggled at her surprised expression. \"So will you play with us?\" Jack asked impatiently and excitedly. Her brain was no longer processing anything, so she simply nodded, watching the children jump up and down. \"We haven't had anybody else to play with us in ages!\" Henry said. \"How about you count first and come find us?\" \"Okay then...\" Isabelle turned around and began counting. She could hear the children scurrying out of the kitchen. There wasn't any point in being shocked. This was all some kind of supernatural dilemma. Right now, she should enjoy having company in her house. Now, it wasn't so lonely anymore. After she counted to one-hundred, she scoured the house for the children. It was hard not to smile whenever she found one of them and they would laugh and say, \"Darn it! She found me!\" Sadly enough, the fun ended when there was a sickening sound of shattering glass, a scream, and loud sobs. Isabelle rushed to the ruckus, finding herself looking at tiny Stephanie sobbing on the ground with a bloody ankle. Stephanie tried to get up, continuously sobbing, but she just fell right back down in pain. Issy rushed to her side, taking the girl's ankle as gently as she could. Even so, Stephanie flinched and sobbed louder. The rest of the children got out from their hiding spots and ran over to the scene. Not to far from Stephanie, the children saw a large rock with a wrinkled paper tied to it. Michael picked it up and unraveled the paper. \"It says: Suffer in hell, you kidnapper. Well, that isn't very nice.\" Isabelle tilted her head and almost laughed. 'Killing your own family isn't nice either' was what she thought, but that sounded terrible. The last thing she wanted was to hurt the children's feelings and traumatize them all over again. \"Don't worry about that now, we have to take care of Stephanie,\" Ashley said. Her eyes were furrowed, appearing to hold back a flow of tears. Isabelle got up, picking up Stephanie as if the little girl were her bride. She set the child on the edge of the sink and rinsed away the blood then wrapped it in a bandage. By now, Stephanie had ceased her sobs. She said a small thank you to Isabelle as she set the girl down at the dining table. The rest of the kids sat in their own chairs around the injured one. Issy herself sat at the head of the table. \"I'm sorry I can't bring you to a hospital. I'm sure you understand the chaos and questions that would errupt,\" Isabelle apologized. Stephanie only nodded. Michael spoke up, \"I don't want you to get into trouble for the mishap with Stephanie...\" She was about to answer when Jack interrupted, \"No, we will be the ones in trouble, Michael. Not Isabelle.\" Henry shook his head, \"Isabelle is the adult, though. He would blame her. He might get angry enough to kill her!\" \"He won't harm her. Do you guys pay attention to how different he is when around her?\" Ashley said quite perplexed at how blind the rest of her children friends were. Then again, they didn't take much interest in Isabelle like she did. And if it wasn't for Trevor taking an interest in Isabelle, Ashley wouldn't have bothered either. But seeing Mr. Boogie around her-especially in that incident a few nights prior to the fall-it was clear she was something other than a victim to him. \"She is the one who can save us from the other world, from Mr. Boogie.\" Jack laughed out loud, harder than she has ever seen a kid laugh. He started beating his fist on the table, saying, \"No one can save us. We are already trapped forever, Ashley. Stop it with the fairytales.\" \"It's not a fairytale,\" Ashley frowned. \"I heard a heartbeat in him.\" This clearly caught all their attentions. \"I heard it. He has a heart, and it started beating.\" The Bughuulies: Thank you to all those who continue to read and review this piece of crap :D dark angeltiger: I'm so glad you like this legend better :3 It makes me feel like I'm doing something slightly right!

Side-note concerning this stor y right here : I have finally used a suggestion from one of you Bughuulies and I will list this person's name in the Bughuulies section at the end of this chapter. ENJOY! Chapter Ten: Bughuul \"You're insane,\" Jack retorted. \"Let's not forget that she isn't the one who is taking children and murdering their families,\" Isabelle defended. \"The only one who can heal her is Mr. Boogie, so let's just get the punishment over with now.\" Some of the children appeared concerned and fearful of the thought. Ashley considered it thoroughly, however. \"I think that's a good idea. We can explain we were just having a bit of fun.\" \"Like he'll believe that,\" Jack smirked at Ashley. \"Maybe we should just bash that rock into Isabelle's head and he won't have time to worry about Stephanie because he will be too busy with his princess,\" he mocked. \"It makes sense when you think about it,\" she muttered feeling alone, but barely loud enough for anyone to hear. \"Uh-oh...I think he's back. Maybe we should actually go along with what Jack said and hurt Isabelle enough for him to not get angry about Stephanie.\" Isabelle went wide-eyed, surprised Ashley thought that preposterous notion was a good idea. The rest of the children also felt his presence and began to tremble, turning their eyes to Issy for help. Sadly, Isabelle found delay in coming up with ideas and excuses. Then again, she wasn't supposed to be a part of this in the first place. Why should she be the one to come up with anything? She didn't even know the creature well enough to know what to say or what would work. Isabelle felt a pang of guilt in her heart seeing at all the children looking to her for guidance that she couldn't give. \"How badly does your ankle hurt now, Stephanie?\" Isabelle asked. The little one shrugged, \"Not too bad, I guess.\" \"Do you think you can walk properly?\" Stephanie shook her head, a tear sliding down from her cheek. She wasn't crying over her injury now, however. The little girl feared for her friends. \"You guys go on. I can stay with Isabelle.\" \"Now you're the insane one,\" Jack spoke, \"We aren't leaving you behind. Not only would you be screwed but so would we be.\" Stephanie might have been the youngest, but she had come up with the best idea. \"No,\" Isabelle began, \"Steph is right. You all go on and maybe postpone any confrontations we will have with this Mr. Boogie and I will continue to tend to her ankle. She can't move much or it won't heal properly. If he does come, I think I can handle the two of us.\" The majority agreed and vanished. Though Ashley was quite hesitant at first, she gave one last look at the little girl and the young woman and vanished with the rest. Isabelle sighed, getting up from her seat, then sitting down next to the injured child. She probed her ankle gently asking what areas hurt and which hurt intensely. The end result was properly a large bruise from a severed artery at best. \"Would you like to rest in a comfy bed? I can turn on a movie or something.\" Stephanie finally smiled, enjoying the idea of comfort and visual aid. She couldn't remember the last time she had laid in a nice, warm bed. When Isabelle carried her to the master bedroom and placed her under the covers, Stephanie felt more at home than she ever had. The little girl smiled up at her, \"I wish I had my own bed.\" The young woman stopped for a moment, examining the happiness on the girl's face. For quite some time she had seen each child in only bits of delightment that fleeted just as soon as it came. There wasn't any telling where they went or where they slept or if they ate at all or conversed with others outside of one another. It wasn't likely they had a home. No place of shelter to run to. No one to watch over them but the creature who murdered their families in cold blood. Isabelle felt a strong wave of sorrow wash over her and a desire to help the little children; every single one of them. An idea suddenly popped into her head. Grabbing a notebook and a pen from her side table, she opened to a fresh page, sat herself next to Stephanie who was enwrapped in the show that was on, and began looking up local stores with cheap furniture. Just as she had a brilliant idea to make the children feel at home in her house, the idea was crushed when she realized how tight her budget was. With all the bills and necessities, there wasn't enough to go around for a few beds for the children. She had hopes that she could give each of them a room; there was enough to go around in that house. Especially with a single person living in it. Though the first idea was a no-go, another was thought of. She just needed to buy a few more blankets and pillows. The Walmart in town had a bunch on sale. If those huge, wool blankets could get any cheaper, she would be very surprised. It was just yesterday that Stephanie hurt her ankle. For a couple of hours, she had forgotten all about the others and simply enjoyed the girl's company. However, when Stephanie felt his presence, she immediately vanished. None of them had returned to her, hwich made her anxious because she wished to know what had gone on with them, but there really wasn't much she could do to figure it out. \"Having a sleep over or do you just love blankets and pillows?\" the young cashier asked, smiling. \"Well, one can never have enough blankets and pillows,\" Isabelle smiled. The majority of the time, she would love to converse with people; however, today wasn't the day. She really wanted to get home and put her plan into action. \"$47.30…$2.70 is your change. Have a nice day.\" Isabelle smiled, \"You too.\" The room she chose was twice as big as the master bedroom, though it didn't contain a bathroom of any sorts except the two that were across the hall. Only one contained a bathtub. A whole half of the room was completely covered in blankets piled three inches thick (not including the comforter and sheet that would be used to go over the children to warm them). Many pillows lined the homemade bed. It was a cool looking nest, and there was no doubt it would be warm too. Isabelle grew excited. Now all she had to do was wait for children to reappear again. How long would she have to wait? Looking at the clock, it was nearing her bedtime. School was in the morning and she would need the energy to focus. Sighing, Isabelle decided to finally change into pajamas and go to bed. However, it seemed like ages until she actually fell asleep. Fortunately, when she woke the next morning, she was fairly energized. She woke early enough to make herself a few cinnamon pancakes and to check every room for the children. There was even time left over for her to sit and read. When she arrived at school, the staff fussed over her making sure she was alright from the nasty fall she took. Some even had the balls to suggest it was the ghosts of the Oswalt family telling her to get out of the house before it was \"too late\". At first Isabelle was arrogant enough to think them stupid for thinking such nonsense, but then she remembered that she had seen it all, and then some. Ghost stories made much more sense than deities falling in love with you average every-day people. The principal seemed to take sympathy on her and not request to have lunch together. Thank goodness for that. She could barely focus on what her students were saying. \"Uh, Miss Jennings? Are you listening?\" a girl named Hanna asked. Issy snapped out of it, \"Sorry, Hanna, please continue.\" It didn't matter what the girl was talking about during her presentation, Isabelle couldn't get those children out of her head. She feared for them. What was going on with them? Why hadn't they come back for so long? Were they in trouble? Then there was also the rock that smashed through her window. What was that about? As soon as their presentations were over (God only knows what they were about. She would have to give them all As since she wasn't paying any attention.) she drove home and took the rock from the drawer in her nightstand. She examined the message and tried to remember if she noticed a vehicle or people around when it was thrown. Sadly, she couldn't remember any specifics. After a few more moments of vain examination, she set the rock back down and went to her living room to read again. For a few seconds she considered inviting Trevor over, bu she noticed his cheap car was gone, so she decided otherwise. Every word on the pages seemed to simply be a blur. It had been two days now and not even a sign from Ashley had come. She would have expected at least some substance from her. If she watched another video would that make them appear again? What if she watched the Oswalt's video; would Ashley know if she did? What if she bashed a rock against her skull? Would that bring the creature so she could interrogate him? Wow, she thought, I'm either Bella who really wants to see her Edward or I really need to go out and enjoy some real, human company. She preferred not think herself as someone as atrocious as a character from a teen fantasy book or whatever type it was. She cursed to herself, this stupid situation is going to drive me straight to the asylums. She shook her head. She refused to sink so low as to do any kind of harming to herself to make sure the children were alright. The accident hadn't been any of their fault. Not only that, but it had been years that they have been with him. If he would do anything serious, wouldn't he have done it by now? Walking into the kitchen and peering out the window, she saw that Trevor was still gone. Alright, Dinner for one then. There were a couple nights after the first when they had sat down for dinner to eat a meal. In fact, it was nearly every night since the last. She was so used to popping by or him coming over that it was habit. Now, it was just weird that he was gone. He had his own business that he operated from home, so he didn't need to (and wouldn't in the first place) go out; he was basically a shut-in. There wasn't any places she could think of that he liked going. Wow, I really am getting lonely. Right after Isabelle sat down to eat, she saw a faint movement and rattle from the window right next to the back door. Having been in many horror-full situations, she immediately thought the worst. But to be fair, it wasn't the wind because that wouldn't have erupted just the one window. Taking a knife she made her way quickly to the door. Without hesitation, she opened the door wide and stepped out into the cool night. The only fear left in her was the worry that she was truly turning into one of those idiots in horror movies that always made the wrong move and got slaughtered because of it. In the distant, she saw a bench in a garden; or what was supposed to be a garden, but it hadn't been tended to for years and more she didn't care to flourish it. This bench was there when she got the house; however, a figure was sitting on the bench, its long cloak draped over the back. Many other smaller figures sat on the grass around it. Isabelle's heart fell. She heard murmurs, talking, but she couldn't hear anything from him. Were they talking among themselves? She wasn't quite sure what to think. Were they for him or against him? Was he evil...or was he, by some miracle of God, good ? Being brave, she approached. She had questions, and if he was going to torment her and the children, she deserved some answers. When he finally acknowledged her from a few yards away, he took only a glance. That was enough to send shivers down her spine. His empty sockets where his eyes were supposed to be just appeared as endless black pits. Just as soon as he looks at her, his pallid face turns to the children (Ashley, Stephanie, Jack, and all the rest), and they vanish into the thin, cool air. She was now all alone, with him: Bughuul. BUGHUULIES: Thanks to .unwanted the scene of her meeting Bughuul with the children around him was all thanks to so check that member out!

I'm such a baby. (I apologize for missing anybody) Chapter Eleven: The Lunch Her mind went blank. She couldn't decipher whether she was terrified, in shock, or-the worst she could imagine-not feeling any negative emotion at all. What was she feeling? At least she knew it should be negative. If anything, she should be scared. \"Did you hurt them?\" she asked accusingly. When it came out, it sounded pathetic. Her lack of confidence was evident. The creature's head shook ever so slowly. For some strange reason, she felt the compulsion to step closer to him, so she did with the knife still gripped in her hand. Her heart had never raced so fast before. She felt extreme amounts of heat rise to her face. If she wasn't aware of it being November, she would have thought it was summer. He stood there waiting for her. Almost as if he was anticipating the moment when there was no space left between there, but he didn't make any moves towards her. He was patient, while he strong urge to feel his rough skin beneath her fingers grew. Two bright lights peered into the backyard between Isabelle's house and Trevor's which made her turn away from the creature to see what was going on. Trevor was finally home, his dinky car pulling into the driveway slowly. He popped out of the vehicle and before closing the door, he waved to her with a wide smile. It was a very happy sort of smile, almost excited. That was a first. \"What are you doing out here?\" Before Isabelle replied, she turned around, seeing that Bughuul was gone. Her heart sank a little. Isabelle walked over to Trevor and noticed two others getting out of Trevor's car. One was just slightly taller than herself and the other was so small and delicate. A child. \"Isabelle,\" Trevor said in a fairly loud voice, \"I would like you to meet my fiance and her daughter Jessica. Leila and Jessica, this is Isabelle, a friend of mine who lives just next door.\" Jessica was a small girl with wavy blond hair and dull blue eyes, the spitting image of her mother. In an elegant, innocent sort of way, they were stunningly beautiful. Well. One shocking bit of evens after another. Isabelle wondered what would come next. Trevor looked at the two people he had just introduced, \"Lady and gent, if you will excuse me, I would like to talk personally to my dear friend. You may head inside. I'll be a few minutes.\" He tossed the house keys to Leila and they both walked contently inside with excitement smeared on both their faces. Oh, boy. The young man faced her once more. Someone's very happy, she thought slightly bitterly. \"I know I never told you about her, and I apologize for that,\" he began explaining, \"I didn't actually think we'd go anywhere, but she is so amazing and so is her daughter. They will be moving in here shortly. If you don't mind, I'd like to ask if you could welcome them with open arms.\" She stared into his eyes the entire time, trying to hold back any tears. She wasn't necessarily sad or hurt by what was going on, but she was just so overwhelmed with all that was going on. Things were moving too fast right now and she didn't know what her role was. Or how alone she was. At first it was pretty easy. She had Trevor coming over every so often and Ashley hung around with her for a while. But now things were different. The children were MIA and Trevor had a new focus that would take up his time. Not only was she alone, but she was alone with the creature. What's worse is the fact she was feeling that way, because she liked to see herself as strong, but now she only had evidence that she clearly wasn't. The last thing she wanted to be was needy and pathetic. It was evident just how happy he was, so she nodded, putting a smile on her face, \"Of course, how about a dinner? Tomorrow? I can have a cake and a nice meal...\" He was hesitant, \"How about lunch on Saturday? That way they have a few days to settle in the house.\" She nodded, feeling no more energy to give much enthusiasm, \"That makes sense.\" Patting her back, he gave her one last eccentric smile, \"I'll see you later! I have to get what little they brought into the house.\" Isabelle watched him open the trunk to grab a few suitcases, bringing them inside and shutting the door behind him without another glance back at her to see if she got safely inside her empty house. The next few days were painfully slow. There wasn't any obvious company in her house and Trevor made no drop by since before she was introduced to the fiance. Fortunately, the students at school were well-behaved and talkative all the same. Their good mood was probably due to Thanksgiving Break being in only two weeks. Isabelle used to look forward to that, but now she wasn't so sure what she thought about being away from work for so long. There would be nothing to occupy her time except books. Not that that was a bad thing. Every day she had checked the bedding she made for the children in case they found their way there, but it never seemed like they did. Why did they finally come out to see her and then just disappear and leave her all by herself? It didn't make any sense. Throughout the day she cleaned and prepped the house, not that a whole lot of it was needed. It was hard for her to actually make a mess. The only mess was in her master bathroom. A bunch of dirty clothes cluttered the floor and a few damp towels were hanging on the shower, but it wasn't as if anybody would see the bathroom. When she claimed it was the right time to start preparing the meal, she did just that. After a few hours passed, the meal was set as well as the table and the cookie cake which said Congratulations was waiting on the island. Right on time, when the clock struck noon, the door bell rang throughout the house. Isabelle got the jitters just from the sound. She made her way into the living room and opened the front door. Right on the front porch were her guests in neat clothes. Pressed shirts, long sleeved dresses, and dress coats. Isabelle almost felt under-dressed. \"Come on in, the lunch is waiting for you all in the dining area,\" Isabelle said cheerily, \"This way!\" Trevor had his hand lightly on Leila's back guiding her to the dining room with Jessica tagging along behind them. She looked so small and innocent in her flower pattern dress. It warmed Isabelle's heart to see her smile up at her. \"Is that cake for us?\" Jessica asked in a very excited tone. She tried hopping in place to take a better look at it, but it didn't work out too well. \"Yup,\" Isabelle answered proudly, \"You even get to take the rest of it home when you leave.\" The little girl's mouth opened wide with surprise, \"Thank you!\" She ran up to Issy and hugged her. She no longer felt alone. xxx Over lunch they chatted about random things: careers, everyday chores, happy memories, childhoods, and the whole sha-bang. Leila was a kind young woman. She had a fair head on her shoulders and seemed like a determined mother who made sure her child got all she needed. She depended on no one, not even Trevor. Isabelle admired that trait. She was also only a year older than Issy; Jessica was four. The little was a bit antsy to say the least. She was bouncing in her seat, she couldn't stop smiling, and she continued to ask to go to the bathroom every so often. It was to use the bathroom in honesty, Isabelle heard the flushing each time and the child drank a lot of juice. Eventually, though, she got bored of the adult chatter and asked to roam. Jessica was enwrapped in the tales with Trevor merely telling her daughter to ask Isabelle. Isabelle thought it fine since she was perfectly capable to use stairs and old enough not to be watched for a half hour or so. Isabelle was also entertained by the tale of how those two met. Apparently, Leila got mail that wasn't hers sent to her house, and she thought Trevor's address was the right one, but it wasn't his mail either. He helped her find the address since she was new to the neighborhood at the time, and they talked and it just went beyond neighbors from there. It sounded like a movie; a cute and cliche movie. \"So when's the wedding?\" she asked, \"This December. We thought a nice Christmas wedding would be a nice time to do it. And I know that Trevor would want you to attend it,\" Leila smiled, waiting for her to answer. \"Of course,\" Isabelle answered. She turned to smile at Trevor, but she noticed a figure standing behind him. Ashley. Trevor looked behind him, noticing her eyes, but Ashley vanished before he saw anything. Isabelle's heart skipped a beat. Are they back? She felt heat running throughout her whole body. Now she was going to be antsy until they left. Great. \"Is everything okay?\" Trevor asked. \"Yeah,\" Isabelle answered, \"Just feeling a little warm. Do you mind me opening up a window?\" They didn't mind, so she did just that and let the cool breeze air out her pits. It was too late, however, because there were already dark, wet circles under her arms. When she felt like she had taken long enough, she sat back down at the table, wondering what else they could talk about. Suddenly, Jessica's shrill giggle echoed through the upstairs and it sounded as if she was running around. Leila slid her chair out from the table and sighed, \"It looks like we should be leaving then. I apologize. My daughter can be very rambunctious when she stays at anyone's house for too long.\" Isabelle felt nervous for a second. Her office was the first door on the second floor and it didn't have an actual door. It was just an open archway. A very wide, open archway. Her information, Oswalt's information, was scattered on boards, her desk, on the floor, and it wouldn't be hard at all to miss. \"How about you just sit down and I'll go get her? You both can enjoy a piece of cake while you're at it. I would love to be able to uh talk to Jessica.\" \"Um, alright then.\" Leila smiled, a confused glint in her eyes. Yeah, that excuse was strange and most certainly not good enough to get pass without question. Close enough. Isabelle ran up the stairs, searching every room for Jessica. Finally peering into the room with the pallet of blankets and pillows on the floor, she found them. Jessica, Ashley and the rest. All playing a bit of freeze tag. When Isabelle walked into the room, the majority stopped playing and looked at her, out of breath and smiling. \"Isabelle come play with us!\" Stephanie said. From the looks of it, her ankle was entirely healed, not a single scar could be seen on her bare skin. As much as Isabelle felt the urge to do everything she could to keep them there, she knew she had to get Isabelle back to her mother before her and Trevor decided to come search the upstairs. \"Well, Jessica has to leave now, so she can't stay.\" Jessica frowned, \"But I just got here.\" \"I know, but your mother and Trevor are wanting to go home. You can always come back later. You live right next door now, remember?\" She smiled at that, \"Oh yeah! Can I come tomorrow?\" \"Of course.\" Isabelle took the little girl's hand and led her through the hallways. Before they descending the last flight of stairs, Isabelle squatted to the girl's height and whispered, \"You have to understand that your mom and Trevor aren't allowed to know that those children are here. Okay? It will be our little secret because if they do know, you wouldn't be able to come back. Do you understand?\" The girl nodded confidently. \"What got you so excited, Jessie?\" Leila asked in that typical baby-voice that parents usually use. \"I saw a butterfly through come in through the window!\" she lied, \"It landed in my hair.\" Isabelle was utterly surprised. Where did she come up with that? \"I appreciate your welcome lunch, it was great,\" Leila said. \"You're very welcome. Don't forget the cake!\" Trevor grabbed it and led the little pack out the door. Isabelle would have thought she was alone, but remembering the children, she didn't think so. She climbed up the stairs then walked into the room. The children were still playing, light on their feet. \"So are you going to play, Issy?\" Henry asked. \"Of course.\" And she did. It was now Sunday morning and she had woken up a lot earlier than needed (the sun was still not up). Because the children were off in their own world again, she decided to try reading once more (that was still a laugh; it was hard to focus on something in silence in that house) to pass the time. Turning on a lamp and laying her full body on the couch, she glanced at the clock hanging on one of the walls: 3:47. Rolling her eyes in irritation, she opened her book to the page she was last on. The ticking of the clock was now her focus for noise. That seemed to help quite significantly in her effort to read and comprehend the words on the page. Her focus on the ticking, however, was interrupted not too long after finally comprehending the words. Sounds of footsteps outside the front door sounded. They were soft and there were many. A fuzzy feeling of delight began to swell in her heart. Did the children already sense she was up and ready to play? Isabelle got up and opened the front door, welcoming whom she thought were the children. But it wasn't the children. Bughuulies: I was going to publish this yesterday, but I recall Lady Minuialwen wanting a longer chapter. This was not significantly longer, obviously, but I just HAD to leave you guys hanging :P Even though I did that for almost a year before. I'm terrible, I should be a deity like Bughuul. I have the evilness for it. Again, thank you all so much for the reviews. I mean every single one has given me the jitters :D I love them all! Don't forget to send in ideas to contribute to the story so it's more of a community thing as well. :) I LOVE YOU ALL![Chapter 12] A/N: You probably all hate me DX I know. Go ahead and scream and yell at me in the reviews. I deserve it. I hope this extra long one makes up for it! And it's a tad bit fluffy! WARNING : IT GETS EMOTIONAL SOON ENOUGH AND IT MAY GET SUPER FLUFFY AND WEIRD OR WHATEVER, BUT I HAVE BEEN ASKED BY QUITE A FEW FOR MORE FLUFF, WHICH IS WHAT I'M GOING TO DO.

You know how college is, getting settled, making sure your roommate can't see what you're writing, blah blah blah. Oh yea, and pathetic ol' me was dumped by my boyfriend/fiance of two years. Oh well :/ At least writing never leaves! Thank you for all those who have just started reading, but thank you ESPECIALLY to those who continue reading after so long without updates! Love you guys! Chapter Twelve: Sinister Memories: Part One One hand slammed into her mouth, gagging her with a wool rag. Another snaked its way around her waist, yanking her off the ground. She was turned forward and was only able to catch a glimpse of two other figures behind the one that was holding her hostage. Isabelle tried screaming, but the sound was muffled, barely audible. \"No use in screaming, girly,\" one of them sneered. \"Ain't nobody gonna save a child-knapper.\" Flailing, of course, was useless. The figure had a tight hold of her. They moved upstairs and into the office; the first door they found. The big guy threw Isabelle to the ground while the other two wrapped her in duct tape. \"Where are they?\" Isabelle narrowed her brows. They were dressed somewhat casually. She expected them to appear dirty, but they could definitely pass for guys who got paid higher than the average middle-class worker. They didn't seem to be people who would man handle a young woman. The smaller guy wearing a nice tie retrieved the cloth from her mouth. Isabelle tried spitting out the lint left behind. \"Where are those children?\" \"What the hell are you talking about?\" Isabelle's voice cracked a little. \"We saw those missing children in your house. We've been hunting them down. And you have them. Where are they?\" the big guy interrogated. \"I'm only twenty-two years old, and this is my first year teaching. I haven't stolen a child, or anything really for that matter. You have the wrong person, and it would be much more than appreciated if you could continue your hunt elsewhere.\" The three of them chuckled. \"We can do this the easy way,\" the middle guy smirked, pulling out a long kitchen knife, \"Or the painful way.\" You're insane! she wanted to scream, but that would only provoke them The middle one held the knife to her cheek, \"I'm telling you, it would be much easier to hand the children over without any bloodshed.\" \"I don't have any children.\" Tears ran down her cheeks, overflowing from her eyes, but she couldn't stop despite wanting to tough it out. He dug the tip of the blade into her cheek. She could feel the droplets of blood mesh with her salty tears. He gritted his teeth, his smirk wiped clean away, \"Tell me where the kids are!\" Isabelle shook her head, \"I don't know what you're talking about.\" \"Uh...Kale...\" the short once said hesitantly. The middle one pushed on, demanding answers. Suddenly, the lights in the hallway flickered a few times before the sound of one bulb blowing out was heard. Then another blew out, then another. Each time, making them jump. Giggles could be heard from all around them, but the men couldn't pinpoint exactly where it was coming from. The windows in the office flung open, and the autumn leaves came tumbling in clumsily. It was almost comical to watch them whack senselessly at the leaves. Isabelle shivered as the wind blew through the room. He came back, knife still gripped in his hands. He came up behind her, holding it to her throat. \"What are you doing? Who else is here?\" \"Dude! Come on! We have to get out of here,\" yelled the big man. He yanked the middle of the group up from where he was, scraping Isabelle's neck with the knife while he did so. The men ran out of the room. She listened for them all the way out the front door until she couldn't hear their yells anymore. Her heart continued to pound in her chest so hard, it was making her dizzy. She tried feeling around the floor for a sturdy position to get up, but her blurred eye-sight was too much. She breathed in and out a few times, trying to regain her composure. Giving up, Isabelle shut her eyes and leaned against the desk. Everything grew quiet. The windows made a sliding sound as they were being shut and a blanket was wrapped around her entire body. Once more, she opened her eyes. Her vision much clearer now. Probably more than she liked. His gruesome face was even more detailed, being so close. But there was something different about him. And it was obvious. He had eyes. Human eyes. Or rather, they looked more human. They were a soft hazel brown. She was drawn to them, and though they still had a hint of this eerie emptiness, they still had warmth and humanity in them. She wanted to cling to that in this moment of weakness and vulnerability. He picked her up, walking her up a flight of stairs and into her bedroom. She felt her body shake; she still feared him. God only knows what he could do to her. Then again, the part of her that didn't fear was always thinking \" Would he do anything?\" She was set down onto the bed, covers pulled to her shoulders. He examined her briefly before disappearing down the dark hallway. Strangely enough, Isabelle's heart sank, and she felt alone. The following few days, the mystery of the note and rock was cleared up. Still, the children haven't been around. Neither has he. Despite school and being around so many students, she felt alone. Her house felt empty. Even though they weren't necessarily humans any more, she enjoyed feeling not alone because the children would appear from time to time. And his presence, the man, the deity, whatever he was, it was nice to know someone was around watching over her (mind you, it didn't feel that way at first). But there was no sign. She was alone, her parents neither answering her messages nor were they that close in the first place. And let's face it, Trevor wasn't close anymore with his new life starting. When Isabelle moved into the town, she wasn't worried about making any friends. She figured it would just happen. But it didn't, really. There wasn't anyone close to her. She tried reasoning it had only been less than a year since arriving, but she should at least have someone to hang out with once in a while. She supposed she could call up Deputy Henderson...No, that would be strange. Isabelle pulled a blanket over her as she snuggled into the couch, opening a book. It was a relaxing read. Other worldly places, princes, princesses, sword fighting. Love. As she thought about the word, what it meant, a slight smile formed on her face. It quickly faded, however. Was she to ever find love? Or would she live in this house, this giant house, alone? No one to share it with? As far she knew, no one would want to be with her. No one of her liking anyway. Most godly males wanted children. They deserved children. That was something she couldn't give. Alone, then. Her thoughts meandered to the children. And to him. He was a curious creature. Was he good or bad? Human or demon? Or something else? Maybe he was everything. Isabelle flinched at the double meaning her last thought had. She was really so desperate. So desperate to want to be in the company of something that had murdered families and took away children. Yes, she had truly gone off the deep end. It was normal, she rationalized. And it was. To be so lonely that you would look for the company of anyone, of any thing. She shut the book she was reading. It was settled then. She would go wander the town in search of something less lonely to do. After getting dressed, she walked into the kitchen to grab her coat, finding a small child sitting at the window again, spying on the neighbor...or rather now neighbors. \"Ashley,\" Isabelle called out, \"What are you doing?\" Ashley turned around, her cheeks tear-stained. \"I thought I would be able to go to his wedding. Be there when his children are born. But I'm stuck here.\" Isabelle frowned, dropping her coat on the island and squatted down next to the little girl. She set a hand on her shoulder. \"I'm sorry. But I will do all I can to invite them over here as much as possible. I'll ask to babysit, and you can play with them then. How does that sound?\" Her tears stopped, and she had a small smile forming across her face. \"That sounds lovely. Could you really do that?\" \"Of course!\" The little girl flung into Isabelle's arms and hugged her tightly. When she finally released, she asked, \"Where are you going, Isabelle?\" \"I was going out for a day in the town, but I can stay so we can play games if you like.\" She now grinned from ear to ear, \"We have been wanting to play tag with you for a long time! I'll go get the others!\" Before Isabelle could say anything more, Ashley ran down the flight of stairs. Curious, she tried to follow, but when she arrived at the base of the steps, there was no one to be found. Her brows crinkled with her confusion. She peered around the corners of the various finished and unfinished rooms. No one. When she came to one of the extra guest bedrooms in the basement, she heard an odd whisping noise coming from the closet on the other side of the room. She slowly approached it as the whisping got much louder. Her hands now rested on the door knobs of the doors. She slowly opened them, her eyes opened wide in shock. There was a large circular blob of dark purple substance. Based on movies she had seen before, it looked like a portal. As she grew more focused on the purple substance, she began to hear giggling. Her hand unexpectedly started reaching for the substance, and suddenly, it was through it. With much hesitation, she forced herself through, and found that she was in a very familiar place. All-too familiar. She was in her old bedroom back at home where her parents have lived their whole married lives and still lived today. Her roomwas filled with books and stuffed animals lined the bed and there were so many fuzzy blankets around that it was like a carpet on her hard wood floor. As a kid, she had always wanted carpet. She loved the feel of it between her toes, but her parents thought it looked less classy than wood, so they kept it their wood floors. The giggling came from the corner of the room that had the most chairs and bean bags set up. There were four children playing. One of them was Isabelle. Her first instinct was to hide, but it didn't seem that any of them had noticed her presence. Before she left for boarding school at the age of thirteen, she befriended Jack, Alaina, and Alex. It was never really agreed upon how we met for sure. We each saw it differently, even at different times, but we were so tiny when we did meet. It wasn't a surprise that no one could remember. Isabelle, the present day Isabelle, stood and watched over the four children as they circled around the tower of Jenga. Whenever it came crashing down, they teased the perpetrator and built it up again. Alex had dark brown hair and had darker skin than the rest from being outside a lot. Tod was similar, his hair however black and shaggier and skin much fairer. Alaina had beautiful shiny black hair that was pulled back neatly in a pony tail. It was prettiest when her mother sat her down to curl it for church. Sometimes Isabelle had been jealous of her and how pretty she was. That didn't affect their friendship of course, Isabelle didn't get that kind of jealousy. There was a knock at the front door. The children stopped their game play when Isabelle's mother came into the room explaining it was for them. She remembered who it was at the door. The memories came rushing back to her. Her parents gifted all of them with a badminton playset that they all anxiously waited to play with. It was too late in the day however, and it would wait until tomorrow to be set up. Isabelle felt her heart stop for a moment. She remembered what happened next. As soon as all her friends left, she went back upstairs to put away the game to find a mysterious yellow rose placed on her pillow with a a tiny slip of paper that said \"It's you\". The grown women turned towards the bed and for instance saw a dark figure place something on that very pillow before vanishing. Was it who she thought it was? Little Izzy came rushing in, wanting to hurry up and clean so she could eat dinner. She wandered to her pillow and picked up the floor, reading the note carefully. Her mother walked in. \"Aw, how sweet of your friends to give you your favorite flower,\" her mother cooed before Isabelle could ask if it was from them. Well, without asking, she got her answer. There was a strange force that seemed to pull her physically out of those memories, throwing her into a new one. Taking in her surroundings, she noticed she was now thrown back further in the past when she was just six years old playing on top of the monkey bars. She used to enjoy sitting on one side, gripping the other and doing what was called a \"penny drop\" where she slid her butt off and swung down with her arms still hanging on to the other side. As she watched little Izzy do this, something went wrong, her head was too far and hit the other side of the bars forcefully. She fell to the ground crying. Her friends that surrounded, the very ones who she watched play Jenga only moments ago, went for the teacher immediately. A dark figure...the same one from her old bedroom squatted down beside her. Isabelle could barely see from this distance, but she felt like she had to run over there to see what was happening to her younger self. As she got closer, the figure was all-too familiar. With one hand on the little one's shoulder in a comforting manner, he placed his other on the bruised area over her forehead. Little Isabelle stopped crying, no longer feeling any pain. The figure stood up, looking directly at her, the grown Isabelle who had long since forgotten about hitting her head on the monkey bars. As she kept her eyes to his empty sockets, everything faded away physically all at once. She walked closer to him, seeing that human eyes were filling those sockets once more. And for some odd reason, she felt the urge to reach out and feel the roughness of his skin. She obeyed the urge. It was a peculiar feeling. As she felt his cheek, his hand went up to his face, clasping her hand gently. The world around her changed once again. There were trees upon trees all around. Nothing for miles, and Baghuul was gone. There was, however, a questionable ladder hanging in front of her. She looked up to see where it led. It was an old treehouse. Isabelle yanked the ladder, giving it a tug. Sturdy enough. She became her ascend to the house. When she made it, she saw a little boy with dirty, long black hair and pale skin. He was too skinny for his own health, she could tell that much. The little boy looked up, \"Who are you?\" He tilted his head. Her eyes went wide. This was the past, wasn't it? Why was he able to see her. \"Um,\" she tried finding words, but there were none. \"Who are you?\" she finally countered. He backed up a bit, questioning her presence and whether she was safe to be around. Her heart sank. She hadn't meant to scare him. \"I'm Todd.\" She smiled. \"My name is Isabelle. And I will be honest with you, I don't know why I am here... I just kind of stumbled into your treehouse and was curious. What is that you have there?\" she asked, pointing to the papers and utencils on the ground. There wasn't much in this house. Just one little room with a small balcony all around and a single chair and table in the corner. \"My drawings.\" He lifted each up, presenting her an array of different scenes. \"Why don't you use that table over there instead of sitting on the floor?\" \"It's squeaky.\" \"Where are your parents at, Todd?\" \"At home.\" \"It's getting dark out, shouldn't you get going before it's too late?\" He shrugged. This entire time, not a single smile appeared on his face. But he still had a glint of light in his eyes that could barely be noticed. Isabelle hoisted herself up onto the floor of the treehouse. She fully examined each one, smiling at the nature and the imagination this little boy had. It wasn't any kind of masterpiece of course, but for a child his age, it was supurb! \"Well, I'll say I have an artist in my presence. I'm greatly honored,\" she smiled, handing back his pictures. There was a faint twitch of his mouth. \"Thank you.\" \"May I walk you back to your house?\" He hesitated, \"I don't know if that's a good idea.\" She raised a brow. \"Well, as an adult, it is my duty to make sure a child gets home safely,\" she said in a military-chief-kind of voice. Isabelle presented her hand for him to take. And he took it, smiling. Bughuulies: Was it worth the wait? I hope so. I am going to try and make each chapter longer than my previous chapters. I'll do what I can no gaurantees! If you haven't notice the title has the words \"part one\" in them, so yes, we will get a part two soon! As I say so many times, Thank you thank you thank you! For all the reviews and love you guys give the story! I greatly appreciate it![Chapter 13] A/N: And part two! I really hope you like the whacky route I went with this :) I still want to thank those who keep reviewing! It means a lot! Chapter Thirteen: Sinister Memories: Part Two When she took the boy's hand, she noticed bruises on his arm. Dark, yellow bruises. Her heart sank deeper in her chest. It was quite a walk back to the boy's house. It took nearly an hour to even come across anything other than trees. Thankfully, it was only a crossing of the street and we came upon his house: a little yellow building that looked like it was going into ruins. And the overwhelming smell of smoke hit her hard once she stepped on the front porch. \"Maybe you should come home with me,\" Isabelle suggested. OF course, the idea was stupid because she had no idea where she was at or what the year was either. \"No. It's almost dinner time. Have a nice evening.\" Just as he went for the front door, someone burst through it. The woman didn't look like any normal lady. Her eyes were fierce and raged filled them to the brim. If looks were able to murder, she and that little boy would have been dead in less than a second. The lady went for the boy, ignoring the presence of Isabelle. When he cried out in pain, Isabelle immediately lunged for to save him, but something grabbed her arm, yanking her into a rock hard chest. The next thing she knew, she was on the floor, heart racing quicker than it ever has. She took in her surroundings, trying to calm down. She was back in that guest room, right next to the closet. Ashley came in, \"There you are. We've been looking for you.\" A few of the other children followed behind her. \"Where did he go?\" Isabelle asked. \"Did you see him?\" The little girl squinted in confusion, \"Who, Izzy?\" She opened her mouth, she was going to say his name, but she didn't want to. For if she did, she feared that the reasons she asked for him would be more real than they should be. Isabelle instead shook her head. \"Nevermind... Who's Todd?\" There was silence. \"Where did you hear that name?\" Stephanie asked quietly. Isabelle pointed behind her, \"Well, I just got tossed back into my own memories, and then tossed into what looked like the early 1900s with this little boy named Todd. I don't know why that had any correlation with my memories. Why...I don't even know how to form my question, my mind is so fried.\" Henry spoke up, \"Mr. Boogie used to be just like us. Human. His name was Todd.\" Isabelle rubbed her temples. \"Jesus Christ, I think I'm going crazy.\" \"Jesus Christ?\" Michael questioned. \"Who's that?\" Isabelle's heart broke completely in two. She took another shot. It was fiery hot down her throat. Those people lied. They said drinking would make her forget things, but it didn't. Isabelle still couldn't get those children or the creature out of her head. Tears brimmed her eyes. Her brows furrowed as she gazed distantly at the small glass. The way she touched the creature's face... Why? She was curious, but either away, it was uncalled for... weird. Something inside Isabelle's stomach lurched. She felt especially nauseous. It had to have been the drinks, for she's never had so much alcohol before. In fact, the only time she touched it was New Year's Eve right after her twenty-first birthday. The young woman went to the bathroom, sat on the floor in one of the stalls and waited for any bile to come up her throat. She felt miserable. This was a terrible and stupid idea. Just because it worked out for the most part of society didn't mean it would help her in any way. And how cliche was that? Drinking to \"ease the pain\". She felt even more stupid. Someone burst through the bathroom doors. Isabelle looked to see two pairs of feet. There was a lot of smacking and moaning. Isabelle made an ugly face of clambered into one of the stalls, clearly trying to rip each other's clothes off. Isabelle cleared her throat. \"Someone's already in here,\" she mumbled, \"Don't expect me to leave either...it might be a while.\" They stopped, muttered frustrations and then left the bathroom. Isabelle thought about how they could do what they were about to do anywhere and anytime unprotected and be able to have children to love and raise. Something she would never be able to do. She mentally slapped herself for having such self-pity. She couldn't do anything about being barren. She should find the good. What was the point in moping around when she could be happy? It was such a waste to live life so miserable. Then again, was it really all that easy? No. She lived alone in a house full of dark creatures that might kill her at any point in time. She had no friends. Her job is okay but that can only make her so happy. For God's sake, Isabelle, get it together! You are young! There's so much life to live and not everything has to happen right now, she scolded to herself. It was a good point. She didn't need to make great friends with anyone right away or be so overwhelmed with the supernatural going on in her house when she was still alive and seeming to be close to those children, and as much as she would love to hang with people her own age, the children were still fun to hang out with. They made her mood that much brighter. Isabelle got up, going to a sink. She rinsed her face with cold water and drank as much as she could cup in her hands. It was time to go and take care of her body and mind, not destroy it. She did in fact call Deputy and got him to give her a ride home. The drunk stumbled slightly through the door. Though she had this revelation of choosing to be happy, she still found herself thinking bad thoughts. She hated that. When she was so excited about something or made a big decision about something, she usually ended up not going through with it. Laziness...cowardice...she didn't really know what it was. It was pathetic. Breathing in and out, she slowly walked up the stairs. Very groggy and mentally exhausted, she fell into her bed without taking any clothes of or turning on the lights. As she did so, she heard something crinkle beneath her. Now she turned the light on, taking off her shoes as she walked back to her bed. There was in fact a white piece of paper and a red rose. She picked up the note: You are loved. No combination of words could describe the feelings that were coursing through her body. She felt happiness, confusion, and scared all at once. But mostly, and crazily enough, she felt a peaceful kind of happiness. \"Isabelle?\" a little voiced said softly. \"Are you okay?\" The woman turned around to see Ashley standing in the door frame. The young woman felt ashamed and embarrassed with her state. In front of a child. How could she be so selfish and careless? \"Yes, of course, Ashley,\" Isabelle smiled. God only knew her eyes were showing her drunkenness. Turning around, back to the note, she closed her eyes and whispered quickly, \"Bughuul, she shouldn't see me in this state. Take her away.\" It was a desperate plead. When Isabelle turned back to Ashley, the little girl was gone. \"Thank you.\" Just as she said it, Bughuul appeared in the same spot Ashley had been. In all honesty, she felt embarrassed to be near him. Not only because of her state, but because she was more than just sure that he had laid that note on her bed. It was odd. This wasn't supposed to be happening; it wasn't normal. He should be cruel and killing whoever got in the way of his priority. She should be terrified and running away. But none of that was happening. None of the normal feelings that were supposed to be felt in that situation were being felt. It was only embarrassment because there was a fondness in the air. Whether it was one sided or not didn't matter. It was still not normal. \"Did you write this note?\" Isabelle asked. She didn't think he would answer, but she knew the answer. He nodded slowly. Her brows raised slightly in astonishment. She tested her luck. \"Who was that little boy? Todd. Was that boy you?\" She could see Bughuul being Todd with the same stringy black hair. This time, he didn't answer. He walked towards her slowly. Her heart beat faster with every step he took. With a sandpaper-y hand, he stroked her cheek. Suddenly, she was being knocked into a different time again. Isabelle was back in that same treehouse. However, this time, there was a lot more to see. The old table was still there was the chair. It contained notebooks upon notebooks with pens and pencils and crayons and paints. There was paintings of beautiful horizons, sunsets, and forests taped on the walls. There was a sleeping bag with blankets folded in a neat stack and two pillows at one end. Canned food was piled next to the table and a trash can was holding a bunch of empty cans. Was he living here now? The woman walked up to the paintings and drawings. They had gotten so much more realistic and detailed since she saw his last drawing. \"Hello again,\" said a low, rumbling voice. She jumped, turning around towards the entrance. It was a man who looked similar to the little boy. He had longer black hair. His clothing was dirty and worn. He was wearing a grin. Not a terrifying one by any means, but a happy one. As if he was so excited to see her. She was at a loss, and her heart was doing that annoying rapid beating again. \"Again?\" she questioned. \"Ah, so this is the day when you first travel through time,\" he chuckled. His teeth were yellowing. Despite that, he had such a beautiful smile. By the looks of it, he looked of Native American descent. His skin color which now looked healthier than when he was a child. It was much darker. He had a strong jaw line. Isabelle was nervous and curious. \"I'm lost.\" He climbed the rest of the ladder and stepped onto the creaky boards of the house. He was so tall, it made her feel like at any time he could attack her and she would be utterly defenseless. He had to bend only slightly in order not to hit the ceiling. \"Well, I suppose I could begin by telling you that you have visited me more times than I can count before this. Four times when I was a child and three when I was in high school and the rest was mostly after I made this treehouse my home. You are a friend to me. Weird to you that might sound, but in my opinion it is a fondness that goes both ways.\" He smiled at her, a twinkle of something strange in his eyes. It looked similar to the way Trevor looked at Leila. Isabelle turned away from him. She decided to put her two cents into the conversation while he had stopped speaking, \"This is my second time seeing you. Todd, right?\"He nodded. \"I saw you when you were younger. I took you home after you told me it wasn't a good idea.\" \"I see,\" he laughed, \"I guess I look a bit older, don't I? Well, I tried to ask you where you came from the second time you came to me, and you told me that you weren't allowed to tell. That it was less complicated and safe if I didn't know. I was okay with that because I was happy simply because you were there.\" Her heart pounded. \"You talk like you adore me or something...I'm not comfortable with that.\" Todd smirked, \"My apologies, my lady.\" What the hell? Isabelle wasn't sure what to think. Never had she been liked by a male like that. Neither had she seen any male be such a kind, old-fashioned gentleman. That was rare. And appealing. Isabelle cursed herself at that. \"What else?\" she asked almost rudely. \"Not much,\" he answered. \"Although, I'm sure you're wondering about this treehouse. I am living here. No, I don't have a job, and yes, it's not the most ideal living.\" She decided to go slightly off subject, \"How old are you?\" \"Twenty-five in three days.\" If this man, Todd, was truly the creature Bughuul, then what happened to him? He was normal. Minus the hard situation he was in of being homeless and unemployed, he was a kind man who honestly could be a godly man, not a demon. \"How are you getting food?\" \"I make some money here and there doing various jobs for different people. Nothing stable enough to live on.\" He frowned. His mood went from happy to solemn and even longing for something. Isabelle tried cheering him up in a non-direct way, \"May I saw all your drawings and paintings?\" It had clearly been much longer in this period of time than any other memory she had ever been in. She tried asking to go back home in her head, hoping Bughuul could somehow hear her, but there was no answer. For God's sake, she had to pee so bad, but there wasn't a bathroom for miles. When he finished showing her one of his bigger masterpieces, she asked, \"Do you remember how I was able to go back home?\" \"Only that someone had to take you back his or herself. It isn't up to you. That's all you ever told me. As I got older, the length of your stay grew longer and longer. Last time you stayed for two weeks.\" Two weeks? I have a job I need to keep up with. I could end up in a treehouse just like this if I don't show up to work for two weeks. \"Why? I know I wouldn't choose to stay that long.\" Todd didn't answer her. He got up and opened up the cabinet in the corner. He pulled out another sleeping back and pillow. Isabelle felt just as nauseous as when she was drunk, \"I'm going to guess that this isn't the first time I've stayed here...sleeped here.\" \"Correct. Don't worry,\" he assured her, \"I know your values. If you wish, I could pay for a motel. There is one just a few miles from here.\" He was serious. For someone who was so alone and broke, he was such a genuine person who looked out for others. But because he was broke, Isabelle declined the offer. Better off that money be for food than her prejudice and skepticism against him. There was something terribly wrong with him...there had to be. He turns into a creature that forces children to kill their parents and then take them away. And she could only imagine where they roamed, where they lived and slept and what they ate because they were now in this other-worldly dimension. Any appeal for this man, however big or small, she now hated him. This man would lose any kindness he had now and bring ruin and tragedy to so many others. Bughuulies: I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE HELL I'M DOING I feel like this story is going way out of whack, but it's just how it went. If you guys hate it, let me know and I can redo this entire chapter or any other chapter you guys dislike. I admit, I was having a little fangirl moment over Don Shanks in Life and Times of Grizzly Adams. He plays Nakoma and he also plays Michael Myers in Halloween 5. When he was in Grizzly he was so attractive...I can't help it :P So that is what inspired Bughuul as a human. Goodness I feel like I'm cheating my code of never being overly fluffy or stupid or illogical or unrealistic in my fanfictions like so many people do. But I did it. Sigh. Well let me know what you think, what you like, what you don't like, what you want to see, and whatever else you have to say. I love your guys' comments. They are so helpful and nice and it helps me continue to write this story! Next chapter will come when a consensus among all of us Bughuulies comes on whether we should keep or ditch the path that this story is taking. Thank you![Chapter 14] A/N: I know. I am a terrible writer when it comes to . I've been so busy with after becoming a staff member. But I decided to hop on over here and continue where I left off. Crazy crap is going to go down here! I want to thank the following people for continuing to review and read this story thus far: laughing jill xLunaAngelWarriorx BoaBoa17 Angel-Demon Hybrid PLLML Lady Minuialwen shadowkitten11 sophir Kyokkou Thank you all so much for reviewing the continuing of this mad story :) Chapter Fourteen: Weary Isabelle understood now. It made even more sense too if Bughuul was also Todd. Bughuul was so keen on tossing her in his memories to make her like him. Of course. He did seem to be obsessed with her. What with the creepy mirror writing, the constant \"guardian angel\" class act, and the flowers with notes. It was becoming too obvious that he wanted him to get her to spend time with himself from his past. With this epiphany, Isabelle was finding it hard to decipher if he was a genuine person or not. Maybe this was one, long twenty-year scheme to crush her in the end. What other explanation was there? He was a demon...something evil and sinister. That was true and evident. The young woman took the sleeping bag and pillow, making a bad as far away from his as possible. There was no telling what he might do. She had to keep a close eye on him. Thankfully, the man didn't question why she set up her bed across the house. He simply told her goodnight with another sweet smile, and got into his sleeping bag. Isabelle sighed. She sat on her bedding, but didn't lay down. The night was calm. Crickets chirped, grasshoppers played their song. The wind was calm, making it a fairly warm night. She curled her kneed to her chest, wrapping her arms around them, setting her chin on her kneecaps. The more and more she simply sat there, the more and more she grew tired. Of course, she couldn't fall asleep. What if something happened? What if he tried to do something to her? In all honesty, she may have thought that, but it was like she had to force the thought, she could hardly believe let alone imagine the man she sat and talked to for hours today would do any horrid things. And that was what really bothered her. She feared she was finally off into the deep end. Her life at that point was so scrambled, uncertain, odd, so far from normal, that she felt she was drifting further and further away from reality, from her normal life of work and Trevor. For every single day that went by, she cooped herself up in the house and played with those children, those tortured souls who lost their families and everything they knew. After hours of too much thinking, negative thinking, Isabelle decided that once she returned home, she would set herself back on the path of reality. Maybe she would even find some great friends...or even a partner. All she really had to do was stop being with the world of those children...and Bughuul. Maybe just maybe, he would leave her alone. Somewhere deep inside her heart-though she couldn't ever admit it-she felt loneliness at the thought of him being gone. It was the middle of the night. The stars and moon were shining their brightest. It was stunning. Especially having such a great view from high up in the tree, it was easy to see the beauty of the night sky. \"How long have you been up?\" Isabelle jumped in her skin, feeling her heart rate pick up from the unexpected voice. She turned from the window to see Todd was sitting up. \"I haven't gone to sleep.\" \"You know you can get sick that way.\" After a few moments' pause, she nodded and turned to look back out the window. He got up and walked over to her, \"You used to be really fun to talk to.\" At first she was slightly insulted, but he was laughing. It was contagious; she couldn't help but smile. Luckily, she was able to suppress the urge to laugh with him. \"Well,\" he continued, \"I also know that whenever you wanted to go back, you would go away from me. You said that it worked out every time when you did.\" Yes, that makes sense. No point in keeping me here if I won't talk to his past self. \"I guess I'll go. It was nice meeting you.\" He nodded, \"It was nice seeing you again, Belle.\" No one had called her that nickname before. It worked. She was home. Home sweet home. When she looked at the clock, it appeared to be around the same time she stumbled inside from being drunk. Odd. Isabelle crawled into bed, exhausted from staying up so long in that memory. Just seconds after, she was completely knocked out. When morning came, she went through her normal routine and drove to school. Before she reached her classroom, Trevor was calling her phone. \"Hello?\" \"Hey, it's Trevor. I was wondering if you would like to babysit Jessica for the evening? Leila and I would like a night to ourselves.\" Isabelle felt conflicted. Of course she would say yes and watch Jess, but at the same time she was hoping she could go out and socialize. Gross. She didn't like the sound of socializing, but it had to happen in order to snap back to this world. \"Of course.\" \"Great! We'll drop her off around five-thirty.\" With that, Trevor hung up. Well, he would be no help in the friend-area. It was understable. Isn't that how all couples who were going to be married soon were? Seemed accurate. \"Miss Jennings!\" called a voice behind her. It was one of the other English teachers, \"I was wondering about what novel you think we should assign the kids next.\" She was a pretty young women. Five or so years older than she, but very very intelligent. With how beautiful she was, she was in utter shock that she had yet to be with anyone. This girl was definitely someone who would be the best option in bringing her out of the other world. The lady was fun, quircky, smart, kind, the whole thing. Isabelle smiled, \"Well, I thought that the whole picking themselves assignment did well. Why don't we do something similar but limit their options to more classical novels? That way they get the required classical literature reading, but still have a choice.\" \"Brilliant! I was thinking we bring in Jane Austen, Emily Bronte, Mark Twain, Joseph Conrad-the works. Any others?\" She chuckled, \"Nope. I think you went through the entire list.\" \"Alright, well, I already have most of the books ordered. Have to get Emily Bronte in still... Not sure how long that will take.\" \"How about we discuss more assignments and such over coffee tomorrow morning?\" \"Great! Let's do it,\" she almost shouted. She patted Isabelle on the back quite forcefully and walked quickly away. The rest of the day went like pretty much every other day. Students complained, students talked, she graded papers during breaks, she ate a sandwich when it was lunchtime, and when the last bell of the day rang, she was grateful. She got home right at four, flinging herself onto the couch from the exhausting night last night. She shut her eyes and before she knew it, the doorbell rang, making her jump up from her sleep. It was, in fact, Trevor, as she should have expected. \"You look lovely,\" he said sarcastically. Isabelle tried patting down her hair to the best of her ability. \"Have a long day?\" Isabelle nodded then turned to the little girl next to him. \"Hello, Jess. How have you been?\" \"Good. I want to play again!\" she jumped eagerly. Trevor released the little girl's hand, letting her run inside the house. The child immediately ran up the stairs, not bothering to say goodbye. \"Well, I suppose that was easy,\" Trevor noted. \"Maybe I should bring her over here more often.\" Isabelle smiled, \"Maybe. You guys have fun.\" When Trevor finally left, she rubbed her eyes and yawned, still feeling weary. The moment she opened her eyes, her heart stopped. Bughuul stood but two feet away from her face, appearing out of thin air. She tried to recover her composure. \"I would appreciate an announcement of some sort. You scared me.\" Of course, he didn't respond. Bughuul, instead, walked closer to her, reaching a hand towards her face. Isabelle couldn't help but flinch at first. When she did, he stopped reaching for her and disappeared. She almost felt guilty. Her view on God was usually the same: she believed. So now that she has encountered something almost demon like, it terrified her that she feels like she is growing closer and closer to him. She was playing with fire; the devil. And yet, she couldn't help but think of him...of Todd. ","Summary":" A/N: Sinister is a pretty decent horror film, and I just HAD to write a fanfiction of it. It may be"},{"Movie":"Sweet Home Alabama","Title":"History repeating itself","Author":"XxStephXx","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2851356","Passage":"[Chapter 1] Important info This is basically going to be about Jake and Mel's daughter Louise, (if you've read twins then you'll know) and her struggle to avoid making the same mistakes her parents did. Characters Melanie Perry – 34 Jake Perry – 34 Louise Perry – 17 Jessica Perry – 17 Ellie Perry – 1 Darren McKinley – 18 It was 2 years since Jake and Mel had gotten back together, they had had Ellie who was now an adorable 1 year old. Jessica had left school when she was 16 and now worked full time at the stables. Jessica lived with her boyfriend Dave nearby. Louise had just graduated from high school, she was still going out with Darren and planned to go to college 5, miles away, to do a business degree. Louise still lived with Mel and Jake. ----------------- Chapter 1 Louise woke up at 6:30am, she had only graduated yesterday and now she was forced to think about what she had pushed to the back of her mind. Her period was 3 weeks late. She was sleeping with Darren, but they were always careful. What if she was pregnant? What would she do? She wasn't ready to be a mother. She adored Ellie and loved looking after her, but she was still relieved when she could hand her back to her mother. She loved Darren, but he wasn't ready to be a dad either. It was weird her mother had gotten pregnant when she was her age and that was why Louise and her twin Jessica were here. But Louise wasn't her mother and she had no intention of repeating her mistakes. She had plans to do something with her life, and a baby was not in those plans at least not yet anyway, she was only 17. If she was, everyone would expect her and Darren to get married and neither of them was ready for that. They loved each other, but they were still kids themselves. Louise knew she might be worrying over nothing, she could just be late. But she was pregnant she could feel it. Just then Louise heard Ellie cry. She went into her room and stood over her crib. \"Hey, mornin' sweetheart\" Louise said softly as she picked up Ellie, who had stopped crying as soon as she saw her big sister. Louise turned to go into the living room, and then Jake suddenly appeared in the doorway. \"Wh-what are you doin' up?\" asked Jake sleepily \"Daddy you can go back to bed, I'll get her ready and take her out\" \"Thanks\" grunted Jake as he made his way back to bed. Louise got Ellie dressed, gave her breakfast and then put her in her pram and walked down to the pharmacy. She made sure she was the only customer in the store at the time, and then she picked up a pregnancy test and took it up to the counter. \"Oh, so who's the mother to be?\" asked the woman behind the till. \"It's… uh my Momma, but she's not sure yet, so we'd appreciate some professional discretion\" said Louise calmly even though she was panicking \"Some what, now?\" \"Just keep it quiet or we'll have you fired\" \"Oh why couldn't you just say so? That'll be $35.90\" Louise handed over the money and walked Ellie over to Jessica's.y ----------------- \"Hey, what are you two doin' here?\" said Jessica as she came to the door. \"Hey, I uh need to talk to you. Is Dave in?\" said Louise as she took Ellie out of her pram and carried her into the house. \"No he already left. What's up?\" \"I'm 3 weeks late and I need someone with me while I take the test\" said Louise as she put Ellie down and went into the bathroom. \"You're pregnant\" \"God, I hope not\" came Louise's reply through the closed door. A few minutes later, Louise came out holding a little white stick. \"So?\" \"Positive, I'm pregnant\" said Louise not even surprised she had known she was deep down. \"Oh my god, I'm going to be an aunt,\" said Jessica excitedly as she hugged Louise, \"I know it wasn't planned but you'll see this is good news\" \"I don't think it is. I've been thinking about it these past few weeks and I don't want a baby right now or a husband. I'm not ready, maybe it's selfish, but I want a termination.\" \"What?\" said Jess shocked about how calm Louise was being about the whole thing, \"Are you serious? What about Darren? Are you gonna tell him?\" \"I am serious and no I'm not going to tell him. Why burden him with it, he'll only try to change my mind. He doesn't need to feel the pain\" \"I think you should reconsider. It's a big thing, you can't change it once it's done.\" \"I know I've thought about nothing else for weeks and I know how cold I sound but I have to be strong otherwise my life is over\" \"You could try adoption\" \"I couldn't as soon as I saw that little baby I couldn't give it up\" \"I guess\" \"Please Jess,\" said Louise as tears started to run down her cheeks, \"you're my sister, please I need you\" \"I know, I just don't want you to make a decision you'll regret. But you're my sister and whatever you decide I'll support\" \"Thank you and I know I'm making the right decision. I've made an appointment at a clinic in New York, I'm gonna tell Momma and ask her to come with me\" \"You already made the appointment you just found out\" \"Honestly Jess I knew\" \"Don't you think you're rushing a little?\" \"No if I slow down and leave it a few weeks I might not be able to do it. Will you come with me to tell Momma?\" \"Of course I will, but I still think Darren has a right to know, it's his baby as well\" \"Well I'm not keeping it, so knowing will only cause unnecessary pain and hurt\"[Chapter 2] Chapter 2 \"Well that's it,\" said Louise sadly as she came out of the doctor's office. Louise had told Jake and Mel about the pregnancy and they had supported her decision to have an abortion. She and Melanie had flown to New York for two days to get the termination and were flying back that night. \"How'd you feel?\" asked Melanie concerned, Louise didn't seem relieved or happy. But she didn't seem to have any regrets either. \"I dunno, relieved, sad, upset I just ended a life before it began. Oh I don't know how I'm feeling\" \"Okay, come on we'll go shopping. Let's go mad on your Daddy's plastic\" said Melanie trying to cheer up Louise. \"Uh I just wanna go back to the hotel and lie down\" \"Okay then,\" said Mel taking Louise's hand to try and comfort her. \"Oh my god, Melanie, Louise\" they heard someone say \"Cindi\" said Louise trying to be casual, \"hi\" she said silently praying she hadn't seen her coming out of the abortion clinic. \"Hi, what are you two doin' here? Is one of you pregnant?\" Louise had no idea what to say. Cindi hated her because she was going out with Darren and she would love to spread it all around town that she had had an abortion and break them up. Luckily Melanie stepped in sensing her daughter's pain. \"Sorry, we're in a rush, it was nice seeing you\" then she practically had to drag a petrified Louise into a cab. Neither of them said anything until they got back to their hotel room, where Louise collapsed into silent sobs. \"Sh-she's going to tell him and e-everyone\" \"Shhh shhh it's okay, you done nuthin' to be ashamed of\" said Melanie trying to comfort her daughter. \"Y-yes I have I've killed my baby. Oh god Darren's gonna hate me. What'll they all say? What'll they do?\" \"Don't worry about them. You don't have any regrets do you?\" \"No, I'm not ready, but…\" \"Then that's all that matters\" \"I was so stupid getting pregnant in the first place\" Melanie spent the next few hours trying to comfort Louise, until they had to go to the airport. --------------------------- It was after 2am when Louise and Melanie arrived home. Jake rushed out to meet them. \"Hey, what happened I was expecting you home hours ago\" he said as he carried their bags inside. \"Flight got delayed,\" said Melanie simply \"How are you feeling?\" Jake asked Louise \"Um weird I guess\" \"I uh don't really know how to tell you this,\" said Jake. \"Tell her what?\" asked Melanie alarmed \"Cindi knows and she told him,\" stated Louise. \"I'm so sorry honey, I didn't know until it was too late,\" said Jake as he sat down to comfort Louise. \"I couldn't have kept it a secret forever\" said Louise miserably \"Lou\" \"I'm going to bed, it's been a long day\" said Louise, her voice shaking as she held back her tears. ---------- This update is for sweetALABAMAluver[Chapter 3] Chapter 3 It was 7am the nextnmorning, Louise had been up since 6, she had had a shower, gottenndressed and had just finished breakfast. She was about to go and seenDarren. She had to explain to him why she had had the abortion. Shenknew that their relationship was over but Darren was more than anboyfriend to her, he had been best friend since she was a baby andnshe hoped one day they could be friends again. Even though deep downnshe knew she'd never be able to be just friends again, she lovednhim too much. She put on her shoes and when she looked up she sawnDarren standing on the porch, she went outside. He looked tired, he hadnbig black circles under his beautiful hazel eyes. For a momentnLouise just looked into his eyes, they had lost their usual sparkle,nshe could see the pain and hurt he was feeling. \"Hi, I was justncoming to see you\" Louise said quietly. \"Tell me it's notntrue, Lou\" pleaded Darren, \"Please tell me you didn't\" Louise couldn't looknat him, so she lowered her head and looked at the floor. \"I can't\" She had just confirmednwhat he had heard. Cindi had come to see him last night, (she hadngotten an earlier flight) and she had told him she saw Louise and hernmother coming out of an abortion clinic. At first he hadn'tnbelieved her, Lou wasn't pregnant, they were careful and if she wasnshe would have told him. But then the more he thought about it,nLouise had been acting pretty strange recently and she had alwaysnsaid she didn't want to do what her Momma had done, getting marriedntoo soon just because she was pregnant. \"Was it mine?\" henasked. Louise looked upnshocked and hurt. He could see the pain on her face and he knew henhad hurt her badly by asking that but he was confused. Why would shenkill their baby? If it was someone else's that might make morensense. \"How can you ask menthat?\" she said as tears welled up in her eyes, \"of course itnwas, there's never been anyone else\" Darren looked at hernand as soon as he saw her cry he just wanted to take her in his armsnand tell that everything would be alright. ' No. I have to benstrong, I have to understand' \"Well you can'tnblame me for asking. I mean we were always careful,\" he saidntrying to keep his emotions out of his voice. \"I know, but therenwas a few times\" \"Yeah, once or twice,nthree times tops\" \"It only takes once\" They fell into ansilence. Darren saw a lone tear slide down Louise's face and henhad to stop himself from wiping it away. Louise never cried so whennshe did, he knew it was bad and he just wanted to protect her from itnall. He couldn't bear to see her unhappy. \"Why?\" he asked \"Why what? Why did Indo it? Why did I let myself get pregnant? Why didn't I tell you?\"nsaid Louise stronger now, she wiped the tears from her face. \"Yeah, lets startnwith why you didn't tell me\" \"I didn't see thenneed to burden you with my mistakes\" said Louise quietly knowingnhow he would take that. \"You didn't see thenneed,\" raged Darren, \"it was my baby\" \"It was my mistake, Indidn't want to hurt you. I knew you wouldn't understand\" \"Understand? Howncould I possibly understand? You killed my baby. And don't givenme that bullshit about it being your problem, it takes two to make anbaby. I could have helped… I could have…\" \"Could have what? nSupported me? No, you wouldn't even have considered it an option. nYou would have assumed that I was having it and that we would getnmarried\" \"You don't knownthat\" \"Yeah I do, because Inknow you\" \"Yeah or maybe younjust thought I would make such a terrible father, that our baby wouldnbe better off dead\" \"Stop calling it, ournbaby\" screamed Louise, \"it wasn't a baby, it was a bundle, anblob\" \"It would have been anbaby. How did it feel having our baby ripped out of you? Or didnthey put you to sleep?\" \"It wasn't rippednout, I just had to swallow a few pills\" \"What was that thenncyanide for babies?\" \"Don't be stupid\" \"Oh now I'm stupid\"nshouted Darren, \"you murdered my baby\" By now Louise hadncollapsed onto a chair and was sobbing. The shouting had woken upnJake and he appeared on the porch, he took one look at the state ofnLouise and then he turned to Darren and said, \"Son, I think younbetter leave\" \"I uh I'm going, Indidn't mean to…\" said Darren as he stared at Louise. \"I know, now on youngo. I'll take care of her,\" said Jake kindly. Darren did as he wasntold.[Chapter 4] Chapter 4 It had been a week since Louise's conversation with Darren. Louise hadn't left her room since. Melanie had finally convinced her to go to the town's festival, just for an hour. Melanie, Jake, Ellie and Louise arrived and as soon as they did, Louise could feel everyone looking at her, judging her. They went over to where Bobby-Ray, Lirlyn and Clinton were. \"Hey everyone\" said Jake. Everyone greeted them, and they got a drink. While everyone was talking, Bobby Ray got up and put his arm around Louise. \"How you doin'?\" he asked kindly \"I'm okay\" \"Good and I want you to know I understand and I know you did what you thought was best\" \"Thanks Bobby Ray\" \"That's what God-Daddies are for\" he said then he kissed the top of her head. A little while later Louise, saw her other best friends Katie arrive with her boyfriend John. She wasn't sure how she was going to react to her, she was after all Darren's sister. Katie spotted Louise, she said something to John and came over. \"Hey\" said Louise quietly still unsure. \"Hey\" said Katie. \"I wasn't sure if you'd be talking to me\" \"Yeah well, you're my best friend and I don't give a fuck what my mother says I'm not about to abandon you in your hour of need.\" \"Really?\" \"Really,\" laughed Katie, \"anyway I should be thanking you. Thanks to you Momma was so distracted she didn't notice me coming home drunk at 3am\" \"Glad I could help\" laughed Louise, and then she added seriously, \"What about him? How's he doin'?\" she asked referring to Darren, but she couldn't quite bring herself to say his name. \"He's not great, stayed in his room most the time, just staring at Grandma's ring\" \"Why?\" asked Louise confused, his Grandma had died years ago? \"Oh he didn't tell you, well no he couldn't have. Since he's 18 now, he got his inheritance from Grandma and that included her wedding ring, it's been in the family for 4 generations and before she died she had your name engraved on the inside of it\" \"What? Really? I never knew, he didn't tell me,\" gasped Louise. \"He didn't know until a week ago\" \"But she died when I was 12 we weren't even together then\" \"I know but she always used to say that you two would end up together\" \"Oh well, I guess I ruined that,\" said Louise miserably. \"Yeah, he's really upset I've never seen him this upset before. Momma keeps telling him she can get the letters off the ring, but he won't let her near it. For what it's worth I would have done the same in your position\" \"Thanks\" \"Uh I gotta go, John's waiting. What do you think?\" \"He's cute\" \"He has a motorcycle, my mother hates it\" Louise laughed and said, \"See ya\" A little while later Louise decided to take Ellie to see the clown that was entertaining the children. She was carrying Ellie in the direction of the clown when Darren's mother stepped out in front of her. \"Well, well, well I was wondering when you were gonna show you face. I was beginning to think you'd left town\" \"Well here I am\" said Louise petrified at what she was going to say. She had always gotten on well with Darren's mother in the past, but she was old fashioned and very family orientated. \"Is that all you've got to say, after you killed my grandchild?\" \"What else can I say? What's done is done\" \"How about you're sorry,\" said Darren's Mother. \"I am sorry, sorry that I put myself in the position where I had to make that decision\" \"I took you into my home and treated you like a second daughter and you do this\" said Darren's mother raising her voice. \"Look, Joyce, I had to make a decision and I'm sorry that you don't agree with it\" \"Don't you think you owe me an explanation?\" Louise looked up and saw Darren come over and join the small crowd that was surrounding them. He was staring at Louise and he stood behind his mother. \"Honestly, no. I only owe one person an explanation and when he's ready to hear it, I'll gladly give it to him\" \"No you won't. you'll stay the hell away from my son or I swear I'll…\" \"You'll what?\" said Melanie angrily as she appeared next to Louise with Jake. \"I show her what happens to dirty little whores\" \"DADDY\" scream Louise as Melanie lunged for Darren's mother. Jake pulled Melanie of her as Darren pulled his mother away. \"Stop it,\" shouted Louise, \"look I'm sorry I've caused so much trouble, but you don't have to worry anymore. I'm leaving\" \"You-you're what?\" said Darren shocked \"Leaving, I got accepted to a good school in San Francisco and I'm going,\" said Louise sadly. \"Good riddance\" said Darren's mother. \"Quiet\" said Darren calmly, \"When?\" \"Tomorrow night\" \"Right\" said Darren just before he turned and walked away. ----------- THE NEXT NIGHT Louise was sitting in Jake's truck, he was taking her to the airport. Up ahead, Louise spotted Darren just standing at the side of the road. \"Daddy, can you pull over for minute?\" \"Are you sure?\" \"Yes\" \"Alright\" said Jake as he pulled over to the side of the road, Louise got out and went over to Darren. \"You're really leaving,\" he said \"Yeah I have to,\" Louise replied. \"Because of me?\" he said then he paused and added, \"if it is, don't go I don't want to drive you from your home\" \"You're not, I'm leaving because of me\" \"Jesus, Lou. Why did things turn out like this? I love you so much. I wish none of this had ever happened\" \"I know,\" said Louise the she gave him a hug, \"I love you too. I'm sorry, but I didn't feel as if I had any choice I'm not ready to be a mother or a wife\" \"I know that now, but I can't forget I'm sorry,\" he said and he was sorry he looked devastated. \"I know I couldn't expect you to, but I do love you and I always will\" \"Thanks\" he said unable to think of anything else to say. Jake beeped his horn. \"I uh better go, I'm sorry, I love you, bye,\" said Louise then as she turned to leave Darren said, \"I'm gonna miss you so much, this place isn't going to be the same without you\" then he went over to Louise and kissed her, \"I love you. I understand about the abortion and I wish we could just…\" \"Shhh I know. It's okay,\" said Louise then she walked away, got into Jake's truck and drove off.[Chapter 5] Chapter 5 2 YEARS LATER It had now been two years since Louise left. She goes to college part time, she's know a well known model, and has been dating a PR manager called Rick for 6 months. Darren had formed his own delivery business and has followed Louise's career through magazines. Since they hadn't spoken since the day she left. He is currently single. ------- Darren was sitting on a white uncomfortable wedding seat in the garden of the Carmichael plantation. He was so nervous he could hardly sit still. It was Jess' wedding day, Louise was bridesmaid, and he was finally going to see her again in person, instead of on the cover of some magazine. He had thought about her everyday since she had left, at first he tried to get over her, he'd gone out with girls in the past two years but he always compared them to Louise and now she was finally back, he was going to tell her, he loved her and wanted her back. He really was miserable without her, it had taken him two years but now he could finally forgive her for the abortion. Then the music started, Ellie who was the flower girl walked down the aisle first then Louise. Darren almost gasped when he saw her; she was even more gorgeous in person that she was in magazines. She had always been great looking but the two years she had been away had really changed her, matured her, she wasn't a girl anymore, she was a woman with the body to prove it. She was wearing a silk lilac gown that showed off all her curves and her blonde hair was partly down. Darren couldn't take his eyes off her at all during the ceremony. After the priest had pronounced Jess and Dave husband and wife, the bridal party walked back up the aisle. The guests started to move, the guy in front of Darren turned to him and said, \"Hey, that Bridesmaid's cute isn't she?\" \"Yeah she is,\" said Darren trying to be polite. \"Yeah, well she's spoken for. I'm Rick Walters, her boyfriend and I didn't particularly like the way you were looking at her\" \"What? Her boyfriend\" said Darren devastated. \"Yeah, so back off, okay buddy?\" Darren didn't answer, he felt as if his heart had been ripped out, she had a boyfriend, she was over him, she loved someone else. At the reception Louise was catching up with her family and then she spotted a group of her old friends, she made her excuses to her Grandma and went over to them. \"Hey,\" she said to everyone. \"Hey, we were wondering when you were goin' come and see us,\" said Craig. \"Yeah, sorry I haven't seen the family in almost two years, well except Momma, Daddy, Jess and Ellie\" explained Louise \"Hot damn girl those two years have been good to you. You look amazing,\" said Gordon. \"Thanks\" laughed Louise a little embarrassed. \"Where's…\" started Louise and then she turned round and spotted a drunk Darren, \"Oh hi\" \"Hi, how are you?\" slurred Darren. \"Are you drunk?\" \"So what if I am? What do you care?\" Before Louise could say anything, Rick came over and put his arm around her waist and pulled her close to him. 'Darren used to do that. He always made me feel safe and special. But when Rick does it, it feels lumpy and almost as if he's showing everyone else not to go near me. It's just not as good a match as…' Louise tried to pull away but couldn't Rick was holding on tight. \"Well here's Lou Belle's boyfriend now\" slurred Darren using the old nickname he had for Louise. \"Do you know him?\" Rick asked Louise. \"Yeah, well I thought I did\" she answered. \"Yeah, Lou a person can change a lot in two years, especially after their girlfriend runs away cause'…\" \"Hey man come on that's enough,\" said Craig. \"No, I haven't even started yet\" \"Yes you have, Darren you're drunk go home and sleep it off\" said Louise coldly. Just then Cindi joined them, just the sight of her made Louise want to punch her. It was because of her Darren had found out about the termination. Louise also noticed that she still looked and dressed like a cheap tart. \"Hey Cindi, Lou here just suggested I go home to bed, care to join me?\" said Darren looking at Louise not Cindi. Cindi couldn't believe what she was hearing; she had loved Darren since she was 14 until he had dumped her for Louise. It had felt great to tell him about the abortion, she couldn't believe her luck when she saw her leaving the clinic. She remembered how frustrated she had been when she tried to seduce him, after she had told him about the abortion and he had knocked her back. He hadn't so much as glanced at her in the two years that that bitch had left. \"Sure\" said Cindi without a second's hesitation. Darren put his arm around her clumsily and led her away. \"Well I can see you've really matured since I left\" Louise shouted after him then muttered, \"asshole\" Katie had been standing watching the whole thing, she saw how Darren and Louise had reacted to each other and the way they at each other. She knew they were still in love. ------- The Morning after the wedding, Louise got up early to run, well that was what she had told Rick, she really just wanted to get out of the house and clear her head. As she ran down the street she met Katie. \"Hey\" \"Mornin'\" said Louise, \"Didn't know you knew this time in the morning existed\" Katie just stuck her tongue out in response, and then asked, \"Where's Rick?\" \"In bed\" \"So… Jess' wedding was nice\" \"Yeah her dress was gorgeous,\" said Louise \"Do you think it will last?\" \"No I told that when she got engaged, getting married at 19 is a mistake, they'll end up in divorce court in a few years,\" said Louise. \"No, I meant you and Rick\" \"Oh, I um dunno maybe, he's a nice guy and he adores me so…\" \"But…\" \"What make you think there is a but?\" asked Louise. \"I just know\" \"Okay, I dunno everything was great until we came here and…\" \"And you saw my darling brother again\" \"Yeah,\" said Louise miserably, \"I don't know what's wrong with me, I thought that when I left I would leave all these feelings behind, but I didn't I've been carrying them around for the past two years\" \"I knew it you still love him, I could tell as soon as you saw him\" \"Promise you won't say anything,\" pleaded Louise \"I'm hurt you'd even ask\" \"Sorry it's just complicated\" \"I know and for what it's worth I don't think he's ever really gotten over you\" \"It sure looked like he was over it last night,\" said Louise. Suddenly Katie stopped walking and was looking at the house, they were standing outside of. Louise looked up and saw Darren, who definitely looked hungover, let Cindi out. Cini saw them as walked past and said cheerfully, \"Hi, lovely morning isn't it? Bye, call me later big boy\" Darren winced at blushed at this, and then he noticed that his sister wasn't alone. \"Lou\" \"Good morning\" she replied coldly \"I'm so sorry about last night, I was out of line, I acted like a total asshole\" said Darren \"Yeah you did, but I guess I deserved it after…\" said Louise. \"No it was out of order and all that stuff is in the past,\" he said \"Oh look what got into my bag last night, I'm so embarrassed\" said Cindi appearing again holding up a pair of Darren's boxers not looking embarrassed in the least. Darren blushed and snatched them away from Cindi. Katie looked away uncomfortably. \"I um better go,\" mumbled Louise then she took off running as fast as she could without appearing to be running away. Darren stared at her go, he had been so stupid and now he felt as if he had lost the only girl he'd ever loved all over again. Louise went back to San Francisco with Rick that night, she couldn't bear to be in town if Cindi was going to be all over Darren.[Chapter 6] Chapter 6 2 YEARS 9 MONTHS LATER -After Darren's one night stand with Cindi, she discovered she was pregnant. They got married and had a son called Jack. -Around the same time as Jack was born Melanie and Jake had a son called Kyle. -Louise recently broke up with Rick and went back home to escape from the press. Only her family knows she is back. It was the town's yearly festival, Jess was at home arguing with Dave, so Louise decided to go. She was wearing a pair of black combats and a tight gray hoodie, she put on a baseball cap, so people would think she was Jess, (well they are twins).[Chapter 7] Chapter 7 Bobby Ray had inherited the Carmichael Plantation. Louise was staying with him there. That night Louise was up in her room, when she heard the doorbell ring, wondering who it could possibly be a 11:30pm she went out to the landing and saw it was Darren, Cindi must have locked him out. Remembering what Melanie had said to her, Louise turned and went back to her room. Around 2am Bobby Ray was in bed, Louise went down to the kitchen to get a glass of water. She went into the kitchen and was surprised to find Darren already in there, sitting on one of the countertops with a beer in his hand. \"That's not the answer,\" she said \"What isn't?\" asked Darren smiling at her. \"Drinking yourself into oblivion\" \"Yeah, I guess,\" laughed Darren, \"although I've been drinking this one for the past two hours\" \"Then you'll probably want a fresh one,\" said Louise taking two beers from the fridge and handing one to Darren. \"Thanks\" Louise opened the other beer and jumped up on the countertop next to him and took a drink. \"So, what are you doin up at this time?\" she asked \"Thinkin'\" \"I'm sorry, I hope I didn't get you in too much trouble with Cindi\" \"S'ok\" They fell into an uncomfortable silence broken by Louise. \"So, how did you end up with a wife and son, and why wasn't I invited to the bachelor party?\" she said. \"Uh, you're not a bachelor,\" he pointed out. \"So, I can still drink you under the table\" \"True,\" admitted Darren, \"Do you remember Jess' wedding?\" \"The biggest mistake of her life, yeah I remember it\" \"What makes you think it was the biggest mistake of her life?\" \"She married a loser. Dave's a sleazy son of a bitch with a temper\" \"She'll be okay\" \"Yeah until he starts using her as a punch bag and he will.\" \"Anyway, do you remember what I… when I…\" \"Slept with Cindi\" \"Yeah, well I just thought of it as a drunken one night stand, but 6 weeks later she tells me, she's pregnant\" \"And you being the gentleman you are, you married her\" \"Yeah\" \"And let me guess, she and your mother didn't want me to be invited\" \"No actually, my mother wanted you there, she doesn't like Cindi much, was hoping you'd talk me out of it. It was me, I didn't want you there\" \"Ah\" 'He still hates me for what I did' \"It's not why you think. If you had been there I wouldn't have been able to do it and I had to for Jack\" \"Oh,\" said Louise unable to think of anything else to say. \"Yeah, so… what about you? I thought you left to go to college and a few months later you're on the cover of every magazine in the country\" \"I did go to college, graduated with an honors in Business and Economic. But a few weeks into my first year, a modeling scout offered to sign me up, I accepted it and the rest I'm sure you know\" \"Yeah. What happened between you and that guy? Two weeks ago the tabloids were saying you were engaged\" \"Well for once they weren't that far from the truth, he proposed I said no, we broke up\" \"Why'd you say no?\" \"What is this 20 questions?\" said Louise. \"Just two old friends chatting? Didn't you love him, you were together 3 years\" \"I didn't love him like I was supposed to, not the way he loved me, and I didn't love him nearly enough\" \"Oh why?\" \"Again with the questions. You'll laugh at me if I tell you\" \"Probably. But if you can't tell me, who can you tell?\" \"He wouldn't argue with me\" \"Excuse me,\" spluttered Darren, \"can you repeat that cause I thought you said that…\" \"He wouldn't argue with me, yeah I did\" \"Lou, do you have any idea how insane that sounds\" \"Yeah, but it was so frustrating he would always tell me I was right when I was clearly wrong and being totally unreasonable. He'd always say that whatever I did or thought was perfect.\" \"And you complaining\" \"Yeah, I need someone who'll tell me I'm wrong and shout back at me and tell me to go to hell\" \"No'one is ever going to understand your screwed logic you know\" \"Probably not\" They fell back into silence, broken once again by Louise. \"Jack, he is so cute. Still hard to believe that you have a son. You're a Daddy, wow you're such a grown up\" \"Yep,\" laughed Darren, \"I'm a Daddy\" \"He looks just like you did\" \"I know and even though he wasn't conceived the way I would have liked and the circumstances weren't right. I wouldn't change him for anything in the world\" \"Aww that's so nice,\" said Louise deeply touched by the love in his voice when he talked about his son. \"It's all true\" \"You really adore him\" \"I do and doesn't he know it\" \"Yeah, but everyone knows that you're a soft touch\" \"Not everyone only certain people can get round me\" \"Hmmm I s'pose\" \"You don't need to worry, you always could get me to do anything and I suspect nothing has changed,\" said Darren then he paused, \"Do you ever think about our baby?\" he saw Louise stiffen at this and he immediately regretted asking. \"All the time\" she finally whispered \"Me too, she would've been 4 by now\" \"She?\" asked Louise \"Yeah I always imagined, that it would've been a girl with your hair, my eyes, your intelligence, your smile and…\" he stopped when Louise suddenly jumped off the counter, \"I'm sorry, if I …\" he said. \"I have something I want to show you\" \"What is it?\" asked Darren \"Come and find out\" Darren followed Louise into the hall and watched as she put on her shoes. \"Are you just gonna watch or are you gonna put on your shoes and come with me?\" Darren put his shoes on and followed Louise out of the house, they walked in silence, then they stopped outside Louise's old house, (Mel and Jake had moved to a bigger one). Louise walked onto the porch. \"Uh Lou, how are we supposed to get in, the place is locked up\" said Darren. Louise didn't answer, she just lifted up a loose plank on the porch floor and took out a key. She opened the door and went in, Darren followed her into her old bedroom. She took a chair into the closet and stood on it, she opened the trapdoor to the attic, her hand groped around until she found what she was looking for. She lifted a large brown envelope down and carried it to the desk where Darren was standing. \"This is what I wanted to show you,\" she said handing him the envelope. \"What is it?\" He knew even before he opened it what it was. He opened it gently, tipped it and a sonogram picture fell out, underneath it was written, Patient – Louise Pearl Perry Date of Birth – 1/9/1983 Baby McKinley Female Date of Termination – 13/7/2000 \"It was a girl,\" he said Louise just nodded, \"there's more\" Darren put his hand and pulled out a piece of paper that had been folded in half. \"I uh ordered this over the internet using pictures of us as kids\" Darren unfolded the piece of paper and gasped when he saw what was on it, it was a little girl aged about 3, exactly how he had imagined their child would have been. \"Oh my god, she's exactly how I…\" he said in complete shock. He looked at Louise who had an odd look on her face. \"I haven't looked that in 5 years\" she said. \"Thank you,\" said Darren, \"for showing me\" he put the pictures back in the envelope and handed it back to Louise. She took it and put it back where it had been. They locked the house and started to walk back to Bobby Ray's. \"It wasn't an easy decision I took lightly,\" said Louise as they went into Bobby Ray's the living room. \"I know\" \"I had my reasons\" \"I know and I can understand now. I was really hurt that you hadn't trusted me enough to tell me,\" said Darren, glad that they were finally having the conversation they should have had years ago. \"It had nothing to do with trust, of course I trusted you. I would trust you with anything\" \"Then why?\" \"I wanted to protect you,\" said Louise, with tears streaming down her face, \"I couldn't put you through what I had…\" \"Hey shhh it's okay, don't cry,\" said Darren sitting down next to her, wrapping his arms round her and pulling her close to him. \"I-I'm sorry, it's j-just brings b-back some b-bad memories\" \"I know, it's okay I'm here, just let it all out\" Louise soon managed to pull herself together, but she still couldn't bring herself to pull away from Darren. \"Despite everything, I still think I made the right decision, we weren't ready,\" she said. \"I know, we'd probably end up in divorce courts by now\" \"See, I knew there was a reason I why I love you\" Then she realized what she had said and pulled away from him. \"Love, present tense,\" \"I-I'm sorry, I have to go,\" she stuttered and then ran out of the room. Darren just sat staring after her, \"I love you too sweetheart more than you'll ever know\"[Chapter 8] FLASHBACK \" See, I knew there was a reason I why I love you\" Then she realized what she had said and pulled away from him. \" Love, present tense,\" \" I-I'm sorry, I have to go,\" she stuttered and then ran out of the room. Darren just sat staring after her, \"I love you too sweetheart more than you'll ever know\" Chapter 8 About 10 minutes later, Darren went upstairs and went into Louise's room. It was pitch black; all he could make out was Louise lying on top of the bed, staring at the ceiling. \"Hey,\" he said softly. Silence. \"I know you're not asleep,\" he said \"What do you want?\" \"Well one day, I'd like a big house, a big family and you, mostly waking up next to you every morning,\" he said sitting down on the bed next to her. When she heard this she sat up, bringing her knees up to her chest. \"You have a family,\" she said \"No, I have a son\" \"And a wife,\" she pointed out, \"do you love her?\" \"She's the mother of my son\" \"That doesn't answer my question\" \"I suppose I do in the way,\" he admitted. Louise swung her legs over the other side of the bed and got up. \"Then, what are you doing here? Go back to your family\" \"What?\" \"You said it yourself you love her, go back to your wife\" \"Lou, didn't you mean what you said?\" \"It doesn't matter, you love your wife, go back to your family\" \"No\" \"GO DAMN IT\" \"What the hell is the matter with you?\" \"Nothing, just go home,\" said Louise sadly \"Lou,\" Darren said touching her arm. \"STOP IT,\" she shouted pulling her arm away \"STOP WHAT? I'M NOT DOING ANYTHING, I WAS TRYING TO TELL YOU I LOVE YOU, I ALWAYS HAVE AND I ALWAYS WILL,\" shouted Darren trying to get through to her. Louise was shocked by his outburst, all she could do was whisper, \"Jack\" \"I'll sort something out, he'll be fine\" \"No, remember my parents split up and it was hell, don't put him through that\" \"It will be better than him growing up with parents that don't love each other\" \"You said you loved her\" \"I said I loved her in a way as Jack's mother, for giving me him, but it's nothing like how I feel for you\" \"We're old friends, with a lot of history\" \"Stop trying to find a way of getting out of it. I love you and you love me,\" said Darren taking a step towards Louise, they were so close they were almost touching, \"and I don't think about my friends in the way I think about you\" Louise flung her arms around his neck and hugged him as hard as she could, \"Thank god, I've missed you so much\" Darren was slightly surprised he had expected Louise to fight a little longer. He wrapped his arms around her waist pulling her close to him. \"I love you,\" she said as she snuggled into his strong chest. \"I love you too,\" he said treasuring the feeling of finally having her back in his arms. ----------- The next morning, Darren woke up half an hour before Louise did. He spent the time just looking at her sleep. He couldn't believe how lucky he was to finally have her back. He knew it wasn't going to be easy ending things with Cindi, but he knew everything would be alright as long as he had Louise. Louise then started to stir, Darren pulled his arm round her waist tighter, she rolled out of his arms and mumbled, \"Not now, Rick, leave me alone. I have a headache\" ' What? She regrets it, she didn't mean anything she said last night' thought Darren frantically, 'Wait did she call me Rick?' \"I do hope you did not just call me Rick,\" said Darren in a mock stern voice. \"What?\" said Louise sitting up looking confused. Darren watched with amusement as she gradually remembered what had happened the night before and a small smile appeared on her face. Then he saw something else in her eyes. \"Stop it,\" he said \"Stop what?\" \"Worrying\" \"How did you…\" \"I've known you, your whole life. I know you better than anyone, you're worrying about Cindi and how everyone will react. Well don't, I love you and I don't regret a single second of last night,\" Louise didn't say anything. \"I'll talk to Cindi this afternoon. C'mon I want a good morning hug\" Louise's face relaxed and she smiled and lay down next to him, wrapping his arms around her waist, she turned to face him. \"Morning,\" she said \"Morning\" \"Oops I almost forgot,\" she said before kissing him. \"Well, that's something I could definitely get used to in the morning\" \"Hmmm me too,\" said Louise feeling as if she never wanted to move, his arms made her feel so safe. They just lay there for the next hour, just enjoying being with each other again. \"We should get up,\" said Darren reluctantly \"Yeah, I'm meeting Katie in an hour\" \"I have to pick up Jack\" They both got up and went into the hall when they did they saw Bobby Ray emerging from his room with a familiar man. \"Mr. Kolinsky,\" said Louise shocked \"Ms. Perry, Mr. McKinley,\" he said eyeing them both standing together with Darren only in his boxers and Louise in only his shirt. \"We didn't see anything,\" said Louise. \"Neither did we,\" said Bobby Ray taking Mr. Kolinsky down stairs As soon as they disappeared from view, Louise dissolved into giggles burying her face in Darren's chest to muffle the sound. \"I can't believe it, he used to teach us P.E,\" said Darren holding back laughter. \"I know, at least I know now when he walked into our changing room he wasn't looking,\" said Louise. \"Ugh, he came in while we were changing, I feel so dirty\" \"Don't worry he wouldn't have been looking at you, you were a scrawny little guy in high school\" \"Oi, I had you didn't I? I had a beautiful physique, still do. I only improve with age\" \"You really have deluded your self\" \"I have not, I think I've stayed in shape really well. If anything I think it's you that has to tone up\" \"Me\" \"Uh huh,\" said Darren grabbing non-existent fat on her stomach. \"Ah no it hurts\" shrieked Louise. A few seconds later they were both lying on the floor, laughing. \"I can't believe you did that, look you left red marks on my stomach,\" said Louise. \"awwww I'm sorry, you know your body is perfect. Forgive me?\" said Darren putting on his best puppy dog eyes. \"Hmmm I don't know\" \"Oh really I suppose I'll have to convince you,\" he said then he kissed her softly. \"I suppose I'll forgive you just this once, but don't let it happen again\" \"Well as much as I'm enjoying being in this compromising position with you, I better be going,\" said Darren. \"Okay\" \"Will I see you later?\" he asked \"Emmm yeah I have to pick up a package later,\" said Louise then she kissed Darren.[Chapter 9] Chapter 9 \"So are you going tontell me what's up with you?\" Katie asked Louise late that day,nthey had just been to lunch and Louise couldn't keep the smile offnher face. \"What do you mean? nNothing's up with me,\" replied Louise. \"Yeah right, you'venbeen grinning like an idiot all morning\" \"I'm just happy tonbe home\" \"Yeah right, you knownI'll find out,\" said Katie, \"Where are we going?\" \"I have to pick up anpackage\" \"Oooohhhhh\" \"Don't Ooohh me, Indo my agent is sending some sample magazine covers I just have tonpick one that's all\" \"Okay, I was justnthinking it's a little convenient, I believe my big brother spentnthe night at Bobby Ray's and oh wait a minute didn't you? Andnthen this morning, I was sure I heard Cindi screeching because he wasnlate picking up Jack and ooooooo you were late to meet me. And nownwe just happen to be going to where he works\" \"You have a warpednmind, you know that?\" \"Are you denying it?\" \"Denying what? Yes Instayed at Bobby Ray's, yes I was late to meet you and yes I'mngoing to pick up a package\" \"You know what I'mntalking about\" \"I really don't,nand whatever it is I just want to change the subject\" \"Adultery is a sin,nyou know. In the olden days the man would just go back to his wifenand carry on as if nothing happened, but the scarlet woman would benburned alive for her heinous crime\" \"That's reallyngreat. Where did you learn that, you failed history in high school?\" \"I just know thesenthings\" \"I think you've hitnyour head\" \"I haven't I'mnperfectly fine. But what about you have you committed any heinousncrimes lately?\" \"Not that I know of,\"nsaid Louise stopping the car, \"anyway we're here now, so are youncoming in to help me pick\" \"Fine,\" said Katiendisappointed she didn't get anything out of Louise. They went inside, therenwas a spotty teenager behind the counter. \"Hi, I'm here tonpick up a package,\" said Louise. \"Uh… um… I uhnmean name?\" \"Louise Perry\" \"oooh… you're…num… you're… on the…um,\" said the teenager blushingnfuriously. \"This is ridiculous,\"nmuttered Katie, \"DARREN GET YOUR ASS OUT HERE, I KNOW YOU'RE INnTHERE\" Suddenly the doornbehind the counter swung open. \"Do I hear thendelightful vocal talents of my baby sister?\" said Darren emergingnfrom his office. \"Damn right, we arentrying to pick up a package but your employee is just slobbering overnLou,\" said Katie. \"Eugene,\" snappednDarren, \"Go and get the package now\" Eugene did as he wasntold and scurried off. \"I'm just going tonsay hi to the guys,\" said Katie then she went behind the counternand through another door. \"Well…\" saidnLouise \"Well what?\" saidnDarren smiling slyly as he came out from behind the counter. \"Nothing, it's justnI think you made that kid wet his pants\" \"He deserved it. nDidn't you see the way he was looking at you?\" \"I did but I'm usednto it, I only hope he doesn't catch a glimpse of what's in thatnpackage, it might send him over the edge\" \"Why what's in it?\"nasked Darren raising an eyebrow at her. \"Just a few shootsnfor playboy\" \"WHAT? I HOPE YOU'REnKIDDING, YOU'RE DAD'LL KILL YOU\" \"Shhh keep your voicendown, of course I'm kidding. It's just some magazine covers,nalthough there should be a few bikini shots\" \"Oh really, well younare aware of our new company policy,\" said Darren wrapping his armsnaround Louise's waist. \"What policy isnthat?\" \"Well we need tonmonitor all material passing through, so we will need copies of allnphotographs\" \"Oh really then,nyou'll probably want the beach shots we took in Russia with the 100npound 90 year old woman in the background\" \"Ugh no you keepnthem, but I will have to see the rest\" \"I thought so,\"nsaid Louise then she gave Darren a quick kiss on the lips. \"I knew it, younreally thought you could lie to me,\" said Katie suddenly appearingnagain. \"You gave me thenfright of my life. What the hell are you doing, sneaking up on menlike that?\" gasped Louise. \"Don't try tonchange the subject I saw you,\" said Katie. \"Saw me doing what?\"nasked Louise innocently. \"You know what I saw,nand I expect you to tell me everything,\" said Katie. \"Uh sis do you mind?\"nsaid Darren \"Fine, fine, I'llngo and distract Eugene. But be a little more discreet and take it innthe office will you?\" said Katie before disappearing. \"Come on,\" saidnDarren leading Louise into his office. \"Did you talk tonCindi?\" asked Louise \"Uh no she's at thenspa today,\" said Darren \"There is a spa here.n When did that happen? Why didn't anyone tell me?\" Darren just laughed,nthey were committing adultery and were most probably gettingnthemselves into a biggest mess of their lives and she was morenconcerned that nobody had told her that there was a spa. \"It's not actuallyna spa, Cindi just calls it that. It's the nail bar with thenmassage thingy,\" he said when he had stopped laughing. \"Oh,\" she saidndisappointed, \"Someone should open a spa down here\" \"Okay, that isn'tnreally our main problem right now\" \"Yeah I know,\" saidnLouise getting serious \"I told Cindi we havento talk, she said I was to meet her at the bar after Jack is in bednso I'll take her outside and calmly and gently tell her that it'snover,\" \"What are you goingnto tell her when she asks why?\" \"I dunno that'snwhat I wanted to talk to you about. I don't think it's a goodnidea to tell her about us\" \"I agree, you won'tnget anywhere near Jack if you do\" \"So what do you thinknI should do?\" \"I dunno it's yournmarriage. But we should wait until you are divorced and everythingnwith Jack is sorted\" \"I am so glad younthink that, I was worried you'd…\" \"I'd what take anhissy fit and demand you tell everyone\" \"Yeah\" \"Well it's a goodnthing I'm sensible then. So what will you tell her because she'llnwant answers?\" \"Uh I'll just tellnher that the fight last night was the last straw, cause we have beennfighting a lot lately and that I don't think our marriage isnworking anymore\" \"What will you saynwhen she asks if I'm involved because she will?\" \"I'll tell her younhad nothing to do with it, and that it's been on the cards for anwhile\" \"So you'll lie\" \"Yeah. I don'tnfeel good about it, but I don't see any other way, if I tell thentruth there is no way I will even get access to Jack\" \"I know. Have younthought about going for residency of him?\" \"Residency, havingnhim live with me?\" \"Yeah\" \"No the kids alwaysngo with the mother\" \"In most cases yes,nbut I get the impression from you and Katie that you are the primaryncare giver, even though Cindi is unemployed. You do look after himnmost of the time\" \"Uh yeah I guess\" \"Then you havengrounds to get residency\" \"How do you know sonmuch about this?\" \"I know a lot ofnlawyers, and I spoke to one this morning and he said if you havendecent representation you should have every chance of gettingnresidency\" \"I never thoughtnabout it. Would you be okay if Jack was living with us?\" \"Of course I would,nhe's your son. I would never try to come between you\" \"Yeah, I could do itncouldn't I?\" \"Yes. Here's thennumber of the law firm my friend works for they have an office overnin Tuscaloosa, they specialize in this sort of stuff,\" said Louisenhanding him a card. \"Thanks\" \"I hate to break thisnup but we really should go,\" said Katie peeking her head in. \"Yeah she's right Indo have to go,\" said Louise. \"Okay, maybe I'llnsee you both later in the bar,\" said Darren \"Yeah maybe,\" saidnLouise who was definitely starting to feel guilty about breaking up anmarriage. \"I love you, andnplease try and not feel too guilty okay? This was going to happennsooner or later, with or without you,\" Darren said in Louise'snear as he hugged her. \"Love you too,\" shenwhispered then she pulled away, \"You know me too well, and it'snbecoming creepy\" \"You better get usednto it,\"[Chapter 10] Chapter 10 That night Darren wasnnervously waiting for Cindi, it was almost 8, Jack went to bed atn7pm. He knew she was just making him stew because he was talking tonLouise last night. It was well known that Cindi loathed and detestednLouise. It wasn't going to be easy ending their marriage and henknew things would get messy. All he could do wasnhope, that in the end everything would be okay. He wouldn't losenJack or Louise, they were all that mattered to him. Cindi could takenhalf the business, the house, clear out his bank accounts, he didn'tncare he just wanted the people he loved with him. Just then Louisenand Katie came into the bar. \"I thought he wasnmeeting Cindi when Jack goes to bed?\" said Katie looking over tonwhere Darren stood with Gordon, John and Dave. \"He is,\" saidnLouise. \"Jack went to bed annhour ago\" \"Oh. He can't havendone it already\" \"No, she's probablynjust making him stew\" \"Hmmmm\" \"Hmmm what?\" \"Nothing it just…ndo you think I'm doing the right thing I mean they're marriednshould I just leave them to it?\" \"Do you love him?\" \"Yeah\" \"Does he love you? nIn fact I know he does. So yes you're doing the right thing. nAlthough if you two had talked properly years ago this wouldn't benan issue,\" said Katie, then sensing how guilty Louise was reallynfeeling she added, \"You two belong together everyone knows that,\" \"Yeah I guess we do\" \"And just thinknyou'll end up with a fabulous sister in law\" Louise just laughed. \"Should we go over?\"nasked Katie \"Um no I think thenfurther I am away from it all the better,\" said Louise. Ten minutes later Cindinwalked into the bar and headed over to Darren. They sat down at onenof the tables in the corner, Darren went and got her a drink. Beforenhe could sit down to talk to Cindi, she stood. \"Listen up everyone,nwe have an announcement to make,\" she shouted and the bar wentnquiet, \"We're having another baby\" Suddenly the bar was innuproar, everyone was rushing to congratulate the happy couple, and sonnobody noticed Louise slipping out. She hadn't been outside fornmore than a minute before Darren ran out after her. \"Lou, Lou where arenyou?\" he shouted frantically. Then he heard someonenthrow up round the corner. He went round, it was Louise. \"Lou, I…\" \"It's alright,\"nshe said wiping her face with a wipe she pulled from her bag. \"It's not, I didn'tnknow she didn't give me a chance. I didn't know she was…\" \"I know you didn't.n I was watching and it's fine really\" \"Shit I arghhh thisnwasn't supposed to happen,\" he shouted out in frustration, \"Wencould still….\" \"No we couldn't. nYou couldn't do it, it would kill you knowing that you were missingnout on parts of your baby's life. The birth, the first time itnkicked and all the important stuff while she's pregnant. Indeprived you of one baby and I'm not going to do the same again.\" \"But…\" \"No buts, go back tonyour wife and kids. We should just accept that this is yet anothernsign that we shouldn't be together\" \"No we do belongntogether, I believe that. I thought you did too\" \"I did, but now andnonce I dunno maybe we were but not now. It's just not meant to be.n You know I'm right\" \"I hate this\" \"I know I do too. Wentried, that's all we could do,\" \"I'm sorry\" \"Sorry for what?\" \"All this everytimenit's fault\" \"If it wasn't fornme, we wouldn't have broken up in the first place,\" \"Lou come on you knownall that abortion stuff is in the past. But I keep screwing up now\" \"Darren listen to me.n You don't have anything to apologise for at least not to me. Songo back in there and be the doting dad\" \"Lou I'm sorry,nhurting you was the last thing I wanted to do\" \"Don't worry aboutnme. You're going to be a daddy again\" \"I know I justnthought that you'd be the mother of…\" \"Don't think likenthat okay. We tried it didn't work now we have to move on\" \"You're leavingnagain, aren't you?\" \"Yeah, I'm going tonsee if I can get a flight out tomorrow morning. I just don't wantnto…\" \"I know\" \"I guess this is it,nat least for a while\" \"I guess,\" saidnDarren, then he took Louise by surprise and pulled her into a tightnhug, \"I'll miss you so much. I loved today, even if I could onlynhave you for a few hours,\" \"Don't,\" saidnLouise who could feel tears welling up. \"It's true,\" saidnDarren kissing the top of her head and then letting her go. He stood and watched asnshe walked away until she was out of sight. Then he wiped the tearsnfrom his face and prepared himself to go back inside.[Chapter 11] Chapter 11 8 AND A HALF MONTHSnLATER Louise was in hernapartment in San Francisco she was just back from a photo shoot. Hernphone started to ring, she picked up. \"Hello\" \"Hi, Lou it'snKatie\" \"Hi, how are you? nSorry I didn't call last night, I was exhausted,\" said Louisentaking the phone and flopping down on the couch. \"It's not aboutnthat. I was wondering if you could do me a favour\" \"Sure. What is it?\" \"Come home for a fewndays\" \"Why\" \"Cindi had the baby\" \"I really don'tnwant to. I'm sure it's adorable you must be so proud of yournlittle niece or nephew but I don't think it would be a good ideanfor me to…\" \"It wasn't his\" \"What do you mean?\" \"The baby is, how donI put this, African American\" \"What? You meannit's…\" \"Yup\" \"Oh god. What doesnthis have to do with me coming back? We agreed that we weren'tnmeant to be and I'm not going back on that\" \"It's not that,nwell not exactly you two back together would be a plus\" \"Katie get to thenpoint\" \"Darren, he's anmess\" \"I bet, it must havenbeen such a shock\" \"Yeah it was. But I'mnworried about him. He's staying with me and he hasn't come outnhis room for 6 days, not even to see Jack,\" \"And let me guess younwant me to come and try to talk him out of it\" \"Please, he'snreally freaking us out. You always could knock some sense into him\" \"Alright\" \"You'll come\" \"Yes, I'll gononline and book a flight right now\" \"You're the best\" \"But you owe me\" \"I know, thank you sonmuch. Are you sure about you two….\" \"I'm going to hangnup on you now\" \"Fine, you're anlittle touchy today. PMS?\" \"Bye\" ------------------------ TWO DAYS LATER Louise had arrived homenthe night before. She was just about to go over to Katie's. Shenwould see Darren, she hadn't seen him since that night. She'dnthought about him though, that was all she seemed to think aboutnthese days. She had gone on dates since she'd been back in SannFrancisco but they never got further than a fourth date. Louise had decided itnwould be better if she spoke to him in a public place, so theyncouldn't talk about anything too emotional. So she was taking Kylenwith her to Katie's, they could take him and Jack to Chuck-E-Cheesenor something. She pulled up outsidenKatie's house and let Kyle out the car, he immediately ran over tonJack who was playing on the porch. Louise went inside and foundnKatie swallowing an aspirin. \"Things that bad?\"nsaid Louise letting her presence be known. \"Lou, oh thank godnI'm going out of my mind. Being a full time auntie is not easy, Inmean he's a great kid, but he keeps asking where Mommy and Daddynare? Why the new baby isn't here? I can't take it anymore. nRemind me never to have kids,\" ranted Katie so glad to talk tonsomeone over the age 5. \"Well I'm here. nI'll knock some sense into your brother. Why don't you gonshopping or something?\" \"But Jack?\" \"He's outsidenplaying with Kyle. Go you need to relax you look a mess\" \"Gee thanks\" \"Your welcome, so arenyou goin' to go before I change my mind?\" \"Yeah I'm going. nThank you so much for this, I know how hard it was the last time fornyou, but I couldn't think of anyone else, I've tried everything\" \"It's fine\" \"Okay bye,\" saidnKatie grabbing her coat and rushing out. Louise took a deepnbreath, 'This is it'. First she checked on Kyle and Jacknand then she went down the hall to the spare room. \"OPEN UP RIGHT NOW ORnSO HELP ME I WILL KICK YOUR ASS FROM HERE TO…\" shouted Louise butnshe didn't get to finish because as soon as Darren heard her voicenhe flung open the door. Louise looked at him,nshe was shocked he hadn't shaven in about a week and he just lookednso miserable, it also looked like he'd slept in the clothes he wasnwearing. \"Lou,\" was all hensaid before he hugged her. \"Yes it's me. Whonthe hell did you think it was?\" said Louise pushing Darren off her,n\"Now, you're are going to go for a shower and a shave and thennyou're coming with me. Understand?\" Darren just nodded,nstill shocked to see her. He was surprised she was shouting at him,never since the baby was born everyone had been tip toeing around himnas if he would break. \"Okay, then go. Wendon't have all day\" \"We?\" \"Yes, your sisternneeded a break since she's been looking after your son allnweek, and I said I'd watch Kyle, so all four of us are going out. nNow go and shave right now!\" Darren did as he wasntold. Twenty minutes laternDarren went out to the porch freshly shaven and with clean clothesnon. He saw Kyle playing with Jack while Louise watched. \"Daddy,\" said Jacknexcitedly running up to him. \"Hey little guy,\"nsaid Darren picking him up, \"I've missed you\" \"I missed you. Whynwouldn't you come out and play with me? Where's Mommy? AuntienKatie gave me beer,\" said Jack all in one breath like a typical 3nyear old. \"She what? Hownmuch?\" said Darren \"Just a little sip. nIt was kinda yucky\" \"Yeah, just younremember that it doesn't get any better,\" said Darren puttingnJack down, the he turned to Louise, \"Better?\" \"Much,\" shenreplied. \"So where are wengoing?\" he asked \"Well we were justntalking about that and we can't decide between McDonalds andnChuck-E-Cheese,\" said Louise. \"Chuck-E-Cheese,nChuck-E-Cheese, please please,\" said Jack jumping up and down. \"Chuck-E-Cheese itnis,\" smiled Louise. \"Daddy,\" said Jack \"What?\" \"Know what I can do?\" \"What?\" \"This, Kyle come andnhelp me,\" demanded Jack. Kyle went over to Jacknand got him in a headlock. Darren looked over to Louise, she gavenhim a reassuring nod. Then Jack took Kyle's hand flipped him overnhis shoulder catching his head so he wouldn't hit the ground. \"Wow, that's great.n I wonder who taught you that,\" said Darren amused. \"Louise did. Shensaid that if I know stuff like that then I will never be picked on atnschool,\" said Jack. \"Did she?\" \"Yup. Can we go now?n I've starving Auntie Katie made me have soy milk with my cereal,\"nsaid Jack screwing up his face. \"Oh you poor child,ncome on we'll get you a huge pizza to make up for it,\" laughednLouise. \"The uh car seat?\"nsaid Darren. \"Well lucky for us, Inrented a car with two of them,\" said Louise putting Kyle in thencar. ------------------------------ LATER AT CHUCK-E-CHEESE \"Alright go and play,nbut be careful. We'll call you when lunch comes. And no pickingnon people Kyle,\" said Louise before she let Kyle and Jack go andnplay on the soft play. \"You're worse thannmy mother, they're boys, you can't stop them getting hurt,\"nsaid Darren. \"I was only tellingnthem to be careful,\" said Louise. \"I assume my darlingnsister called you to come and get me out of her spare room,\" saidnDarren. \"Yeah she did, shenthought I could talk to you\" \"I thought so. Younreally didn't have to come, if you didn't want to…\" \"And what leave younin that state, god knows when you would have shaved if I hadn'tnturned up when I did\" \"Yeah I did havenquite a beard,\" laughed Darren. \"Do you want to talknabout you know…\" \"What? My soon-to-benex-wife having Bo Soreeli's baby,\" \"It was Bo's,\"nexclaimed Louise the she added, \"but that's not the point I'mnhere to talk about you\" \"It's fine, almostnthe whole town knows,\" Darren laughed softly. \"I'm sorry\" \"Yeah it was quite anshock in the delivery room to see that\" \"I'll bet\" \"I just wanted to benby myself for a while,\" \"You were in thatnroom for over a week\" \"So it took me longernthan most people\" \"And…\" \"And I'll file forndivorce first thing in the morning\" \"Are you sure? Inmean you were together a long time, maybe you could still work thingsnout,\" said Louise, who couldn't actually believe the words werencoming out of her mouth. \"She had someonenelse's baby,\" \"Yeah but you weren'tnexactly innocent though yourself\" \"It's different\" \"How?\" \"I didn't get younpregnant\" \"True, she made anmistake. You could just have easily gotten me pregnant\" \"Yeah and I wish Inhad,\" said Darren raising his voice. \"Look I'm justnsaying, don't rush into things. You've got Jack to think of, henshould have both his parents,\" said Louise. \"I'm not. This isnwhat's best, it should have happened years ago,\" sighed Darren. \"If you're sure\" \"I am and there is nonway I'm letting her take Jack, he's living with me. She alreadyncost me y… she's not taking my son as well,\" said Darrenndeterminedly, \"anyway let's talk about something else\" \"Okay, what?\" \"You. What have younbeen up to?\" \"Not much justnworking mostly\" \"Have a specialnsomeone in your life?\" \"I have recentlyndiscovered pilates, so I would have to say my pilate ball\" \"I meant a person\" \"Oh then no, not atnthe moment. How sad is that, the most important thing in my life isna big rubber ball?\" \"So you're singlenand I'm…\" \"Don't even gonthere,\" said Louise sharply \"But…\" \"No we learned ournlesson the last time\" \"I'm just…\" \"We're friends,nit's better that way\" \"Okay, fine,\" saidnDarren deciding it was better to drop the subject, \"So are younsticking around this time?\" \"I dunno, I've gotna few months off. So yeah I'll probably be here, maybe off and on.n I bought the old farmhouse, so I'll probably oversee thenrenovation,\" \"That's good, younfinally bought a place here, now we might see you more often\" \"Don't now younsound like my mother.\"[Chapter 12] Chapter 12 Louise has now beennback in Alabama for a week. Darren has moved out of Katie's and isnrenting a house close by. \"I don't know whatnto do, she wouldn't even talk about it when I brought it up lastnweek. I don't want to bring it up again, we've been getting onnso well, but I can't stand it knowing I was so close to getting hernback,\" said Darren to Katie, she had come to see how he and Jacknwere, and they had ended up talking about Louise. \"Last time, she wasnin a state, alright you broke her heart again. She doesn't wantnthat to happen again, she never really got over it, she seems strongnas if she's handling everything fine, but she's not,\" saidnKatie \"But what do I do?\" \"Nothing, give hernsome time, she'll see.\" \"I hope so. I justnmiss her all the time, knowing she's in town but I…\" \"She might havenmentioned earlier that she was taking Kyle and Ellie swimming thisnafternoon,\" said Katie. \"Did she?\" saidnDarren, \"Jack wanna go swimming?\" \"Are we goingnswimming?\" said Jack excitedly \"Yeah, come on we'llngo and get your stuff. Thanks sis you're the best\" \"I don't know whatnthe hell I'm going to do with you two,\" said Katie. \"Who?\" inquirednJack. \"Your Daddy andnLouise, you remember her,\" said Katie. \"Yeah, she's fun,\"nsaid Jack, \"Did you see what she taught me?\" \"Yeah I did, it'sngreat,\" said Katie, \"anyway I better go, bye\" \"Bye Auntie Katie\" \"Bye\" ------------------------ LATER The first person Darrennnoticed when he took Jack out to the pool was Louise. She wasnsitting on the edge of the children's pool. Ellie was chasing Kylenround the pool. \"Daddy can I go andnplay with Kyle?\" Jack asked him. \"Yeah of course youncan,\" said Darren and Jack took off, \"Don't run, you'll fall\" \"Fancy seeing younhere,\" said Darren as he sat down next to Louise. \"Hi, I was wonderingnwho Jack was with,\" said Louise. \"Yeah, I had the daynoff and he wanted to go swimming\" \"Yeah, Daddy said Indon't bond enough with my younger siblings, and it of course hadnnothing to do with the fact that Momma due back from New York thisnafternoon,\" said Louise, \"Ellie let go of their feet\" shenshouted to Ellie who had decided that Jack and Kyle weren'tnswimming anywhere and had grabbed a foot each. \"So how are you?\"nshe said to Darren after Ellie had let go. \"I'm good, you?\" \"Yeah I'm fine. nHave you spoken to Cindi?\" \"Yeah, she came roundnshouting when she was served\" \"You filed forndivorce\" \"Yeah\" \"And she didn'tntake it well\" \"No\" \"Are you sure? Don'tnyou think you should…\" \"No, I know what Inwant now and it's not to get back with her\" \"Oh okay\" \"Lou I've been…\" \"Lou I need to go tonthe bathroom,\" said Kyle as he swam up to them interrupting whatnDarren was going to say. \"Would you mind?\"nLouise asked him. \"Not at all, come onnlittle guy I'll take you,\" said Darren lifting Kyle out of thenpool. \"Thanks,\" saidnLouise gratefully When Darren broughtnKyle back, Louise was still sitting at the side of the pool, but Jacknwas in her lap crying, she was cuddling him. \"Shhh, it'snalright, it'll be okay,\" she said saying to him as he cried. \"What's thenmatter?\" Kyle asked innocently \"He stubbed his toenon the steps,\" said Louise. \"Are you okay?\"nasked Darren kneeling down to talk to his son. \"Uh huh I'm betternnow,\" sniffed Jack. \"You sure?\" askednLouise. \"Uh huh, can I gonback in the water?\" \"Alright, just bencareful okay?\" said Darren. \"I will,\" said Jacknrolling his eyes and then jumping back into the water with Kyle. \"He's so cute,\"nsaid Louise \"He is. Thanks fornlooking after him\" \"It's fine, all henneeded was a cuddle\" It was then Darrennrealised that he had to stop playing around and get serious if henwanted Louise back. He didn't have long, she could go back to SannFrancisco and he wouldn't see her. He could go after her, but henwouldn't have a clue where to look for her. He had to make her seenthat nothing could come between them now. \"So any plans to gonback to the big city?\" Darren asked her. \"Uh no, the house isngoing to take 6 weeks to finish so I'm staying til it's finishednand probably a while after that\" \"Good,\" saidnDarren. 'At least I've got some time then'[Chapter 13] Chapter 13 Louise had now beennback for almost two months and had no immediate plans to leave. Itnwas Kyle's fourth birthday party. \"Oh aren't theyncute,\" said Louise who was on the porch with the grown ups whilenthe kids played. \"What?\" askednDarren. \"Ellie look,\" shensaid pointing to where Ellie was currently ordering around, Liam,nClinton and Lirlyn's son. \"I wonder where shengets that from,\" teased Darren. \"And what do you meannby that?\" said Louise innocently. \"It just looks anlittle familiar that's all. Well at least she isn't making himnplay house, like someone I know did to me,\" said Darren. \"Uh you spoke toonsoon,\" said Louise just as Ellie flung a doll into Liam's armsnand ordered him to feed it. \"She's just likenher big sister,\" said Darren. \"I'm gonna tellnJess you said that,\" said Louise sticking out her tongue. \"I wasn't talkingnabout Jess\" Later in the afternoon,nLouise was helping Melanie set up the birthday cake. \"So what are you upnto?\" Mel asked her. \"What do you mean?\" \"I mean are younseeing anyone, got anything you want to tell me,\" \"No, and I don'tnthink so,\" said Louise not knowing that Darren was now standingnbehind her talking to Jake. \"You sure?\" \"Momma what's thisnabout?\" \"I was just wonderingnif you knew you were pregnant, that's all,\" said Mel, causingnDarren to take a sudden interest in what they were saying. \"What?\" splutterednLouise, \"W-what makes you say that?\" \"Mother's instinct.n So you didn't know?\" \"No, I mean I'mnnot, I can't be\" \"You sure\" \"Uh… yeah… uh…noh,\" said Louise very eloquently, still in shock. \"I think you'llnfind I'm right. Who's the father?\" gushed Mel. \"Momma, I'm not,njust drop it,\" said Louise as she walked off muttering, \"it'snnot possible\" After Kyle had blownnout his candles and all the children went back to playing on thenbouncy castle Jake had rented for the party. Louise slipped awaynthinking nobody saw her. \"Lou,\" Darrennshouted down the street at her. She twirled round,n\"What? I just came out for some fresh air,\" \"Are you sure?\" \"What yes. Why donpeople keep asking me that today?\" \"I just meant are younsure you're not on the way to the pharmacy?\" \"What? Why would younsay that? Why would I be going there?\" said Louise trying to soundnnatural but failing miserably. \"I uh overheard younand your Momma talking\" \"Oh which part?\" \"The part where shensaid you were pregnant\" \"What oh she was justnbeing silly, there's no way\" \"We both know it'snpossible\" \"It's not really,\"nsaid Louise still trying to kid herself. \"Lou we had sex 2nweeks ago, we didn't use protection. And you refuse to even talknabout it\" \"Alright so it'snpossible, but I'm not really I'm not even that late\" \"You're late andnyou didn't tell me,\" said Darren. \"One day, I am onenday late it's hardly something to panic about\" \"Who's panicking?\" \"Well me fornstarters\" \"Why?\" he askedncalmly. \"Why? Have you notnbeen paying attention?\" \"I have but I see itnas nothing to panic about, if you are it's great…\" \"Shut up\" \"No, you shut up\" \"I can't believenwe're having this argument, just go back to the party, I just wantnsome fresh air\" \"No, I'm not goingnback. We're going to the chemist to get a test and then we arengoing to wait for the results\" \"Why? I told you I'mnone day late, this happens all the time\" \"But you're Mommandoesn't always announce that you're pregnant\" \"Yeah well,\" saidnLouise childishly, \"I'm a big girl I can pee on a stick bynmyself\" \"Oh no you don'tnnot this time. I'm coming with you\" \"Well I'm glad tonsee you do trust me again after the first time,\" said Louise. \"That's not goingnto work either. You dragging me into an argument, so I'll givenin,\" \"I hate you\" \"Now you're beingnchildish, you just hate that I can see right through you. Now arenyou coming or am I going to have to carry you?\" \"Fine,\" said Louisenstomping ahead. Darren just rolled hisneyes and followed her. When they came out of the chemist Louisenstarted stomping again, not saying a word. Darren jogged a littlentil he caught up with her. \"Why are you beingnlike this? Is it… would… will it be mine?\" he asked. Louise stopped andnturned to him, for a moment he thought he was going to get a slap. \"I'm going to letnyou get away with that, only because your wife had Bo's baby, othernwise you'd be through that car window,\" she said. \"I'm going tonassume that's a yes,\" said Darren then Louise started stompingnagain, \"What the hell is the matter with you then?\" \"Nothing\" \"It's something\" \"I just… want tonfind out before I think or…\" \"Alright okay, we'renhere anyway,\" said Darren they were now outside his house. They went inside. \"Do you want me toncome with you?\" he asked, she just looked so unsure. \"I think I can peenalone thanks\" \"Okay fine, just comenout as soon as you're done. I want to see…\" \"You're seriouslynweird you know that?\" said Louise before going into the bathroom. A few minutes later,nDarren knocked on the door, \"What's taking so long?\" \"It's just…\" \"What?\" \"I don't have tongo\" \"Try\" \"I can't do whennthere is so much pressure\" \"Turn on the taps. nJust do it before I come in there and…\" \"You really do wantnto see me pee don't you?\" \"I don't know aboutnpee, but I wouldn't mind…\" \"Don't even say it\" \"Fine, just hurry up\" A couple of minutesnlater Louise came out. \"Here,\" she saidnhanding the white stick to Darren who was hovering outside the door. \"That's nice realnnice,\" \"You're the one whonwanted to see\" \"See, not hold thenpee stick\" \"I don't want tonhold it either,\" Darren went and sat itndown on the coffee table in the living room, then he sat down on thensofa next to Louise. \"You okay?\" henasked. \"Yeah I guess\" They sat in silence fornthe next three minutes anxiously waiting. \"It's time,\" saidnLouise looking at her watch, \"you look I can't\" Darren nodded got upnand picked up the stick. \"Well?\" \"It's positive\"[Chapter 14] Chapter 14 It had been two daysnsince Louise had done the pregnancy test. Darren had been trying tongive her some space so he hadn't seen her since, but now he wasnimpatient. It was a Friday, Louise was staying with Katie and shenwas at work, so Darren decided to pop by. \"Arghhh what am Inmeant to do? I don't even…\" he heard Louise call out innfrustration, he let himself in the back door and peeked through andnsaw Louise talking to Katie in the living room. \"I don't know, butnyou should talk to him. You can't avoid him for long, in fact I'mnsurprised he's lasted this long,\" said Katie. \"I know, I will\" \"So… am I going tonbe an Auntie again, this time?\" was Katie's oh so subtle way ofnasking Louise if she was keeping the baby. \"What? No. I meannyes. I mean no I'm not getting rid of it, it my baby, it'snjust…\" \"What? You said itnyourself you still love him, why can't you just tell him that, younknow he loves you.\" \"You know why\" \"Just talk to him, Indon't see why that should stop you, he's getting divorced and itnnever stopped you before\" \"Yeah and look hownthat turned out\" \"I'm just saying…\" \"Don't you have tonbe at work?\" \"Not yet, oh shit I'mnlate. We'll talk about this later,\" said Katie dashing out. \"Can't wait,\"nmuttered Louise. \"She's just tryingnto help in her own weird way,\" said Darren causing Louise to jump. \"God you gave me anfright,\" she gasped \"Sorry\" \"What are you doingnhere?\" \"You know what I'mndoing here,\" said Darren, \"We have to talk\" \"About what?\" \"Lou playing dumbnisn't going to make me go away, we do have to talk about it. nYou're pregnant, we're having a baby\" \"I know, I'm sorry,nI'm just being silly\" \"So… we're havingna baby and…\" he said then he was cut off by Louise grabbing himnby the collar and kissing him. ------------------------------ Later, Darren woke upnfeeling a little groggy (I wonder why). He took a second to wakenhimself up. He didn't even know how long he had been asleep for. nHe looked over to the window, Louise was standing with her back tonhim looking out. \"This is becomingnquite a habit,\" he commented putting on his boxers. \"Hmmm,\" \"I'm not sayingnit's a bad habit, in fact it's one I could definitely get usednto,\" said Darren walking over to Louise and wrapping his armsnaround her waist, resting his chin on her shoulder. \"So why is it younwon't marry me?\" he said. \"Marry you?\" \"Uh huh\" \"I don't believenyou've ever asked\" \"I'm asking now\" \"I'm not marryingnyou because I'm pregnant, you'd think you would've learned yournlesson last time and you're not divorced\" \"I'm not askingnbecause you're pregnant, I should have asked years ago. And thendivorce is almost through\" \"Except for thencustody of Jack and the financial negotiations,\" Louise pointednout. \"Yeah, but Cindindoesn't have a leg to stand on, I'll get custody of Jack, and Indoubt she'll get a penny\" \"Yeah, but if thencourts found out I was pregnant, then you'd be seen as no betternthan Cindi and she could still get Jack\" \"They won't we'renseparated\" \"But it still looksnthat way and you know she suspects something, in fact her announcingnshe was pregnant was a little convenient, all she'd have to do isnget proof and we weren't that careful, she could get to Bobby Raynor Mr. Kolinsky, it wouldn't be that hard\" \"She won't, shenwouldn't know where to look. It shouldn't matter\" \"So it doesn'tnmatter if you get custody of Jack? I've seen you with him, you'dnbe devastated if Cindi got him, and I'm not going to risk that,\" \"Lou…\" \"Let me finish. nNobody knows I'm pregnant, only me, you and Katie…\" \"I haven't toldnanyone\" \"Well, we should justnkeep it quiet\" \"What do you mean? nFor how long? You're not going away again, I won't let you, I'llncome after you\" \"No I'm staying. nIt's just easier to keep it quiet until after the divorce has gonenthrough, anyway it's bad luck to announce it before I'm 3 months,nI'm not even 3 weeks gone yet\" \"But you're stayingnhere now, permanently?\" \"Yes, I'm notntaking the baby anywhere\" \"Good. What about usnthough?\" \"I don't know,\"nsaid Louise pulling away from Darren and going over and sitting onnthe bed, \"I can't even think about that right now\" \"Why not?\" saidnDarren going over and standing in front of her. \"It's too damnncomplicated, you're still married, I just found out I'm pregnantnwhich is a big enough shock to the system in it's self. Butnthere's Jack and it's just best not to…\" \"It's best to whatnignore how we feel, we've tried that it didn't work that Inbelieve in why you are in the condition you are,\" said Darren thennhe bent down so he was face level with Louise, \"We can't do it, Inknow I can't. Don't tell me there isn't any hope, please Incouldn't bear it\" Louise just sighed. nDarren looked to the clock on the nightstand. \"I have to go, I havento be at work,\" he sighed, \"Just think about it okay? I love hownyou're thinking about Jack in every decision you make about us. Wencan do it this time I know we can. Will you come by tonight afternhe's in bed?\" \"Okay,\" saidnLouise, \"You should get going\"[Chapter 15] Chapter 15 Louise went to Darren'snthat night after Jack was asleep as planned. They had talked andndecided to keep the pregnancy a secret, but Louise still wouldn'tntalk about them getting back together. They were on the sofa,nwatching TV, then Louise scooted over and rested her head on hisnshoulder. He pulled his arms around her, sitting her in between hisnlegs, she rested her head on his chest. \"I'm sorry, I knownyou're annoyed with me,\" she said. \"I'm not annoyednwith you, a little frustrated maybe. But I know I hurt you badly thenlast time and you're still in shock about the baby, so you don'tnhave anything to apologise for\" \"But I am sorry, Inknow how I've been acting, there's just so much stuff going on innmy head\" \"You don't have tonexplain yourself it's alright,\" \"I… I just want tonbe able to keep you,\" she said quietly. \"What do mean? Ofncourse you can keep me\" \"I just don't wantnto have to leave you again, or make you leave, and I'm doing anshitty job of that I'm surprised you've put up with me for thisnlong\" \"I've been puttingnup with you your whole life, what makes this any different. I lovenyou and I won't give up without a fight\" \"I know\" \"I just hope thenfight doesn't last too long, though if it does I'll keep going\" \"I don't thinknit'll last much longer\" \"Yeah?\" \"Yeah\" \"Good,\" he saidnpulling her closer \"I love you\" \"I love you too,\"nhe said then he whispered in her ear, \"Marry me now?\" \"How could I refuse?\" \"You will?\" \"Yeah I will\" Just then Darren jumpednup without warning almost knocking Louise to the floor. \"What's the matternwith you?\" she said, then added, \"and owww.\" \"Come on,\" he saidnexcitedly grabbing her hand and leading her upstairs. \"We're having sexnagain,\" groaned Louise following him. \"Oh you can't foolnme you love it really. But sadly no we're not having sex again,nwell not right this second there's something I have to give younfirst\" \"Oh and what mightnthat be,\" said Louise knowing full well. \"This,\" said Darrennpulling a small velvet box out of his nightstand. \"Well let me see it,\"nsaid Louise. Darren opened the boxnto reveal a gorgeous platinum ring with a big although not toonhumungous diamond, that looked awfully familiar. \"Isn't that…\"nsaid Louise \"My Grandmother'snyeah it is, well the rock is, I had it put in another band\" \"Wasn't that…\" \"No I got Cindinanother one, my Grandmother always wanted this to go to you. Even ifnI thought we'd never be together I couldn't give it to anyonenelse\" \"Aww I love it,\"nsaid Louise. Darren took the ringnout the box and slipped it onto Louise's finger. \"You have no idea hownhappy I am to finally do that, I've waited so long… and it wasnworth it,\" \"Come here you bignsoftie,\" said Louise pulling Darren to her kissing him. \"No wait, wenshouldn't,\" said Louise a few minutes later just as Darren hadnher pinned on the bed. \"What? I really hopenthis isn't about contraception, cause it's a little late fornthat,\" said Darren. \"No it's just, thisnisn't a good idea\" \"Lou, no you can'tngo back on that not after…\" \"No not that, I meantnI should go back to Katie's\" \"Why?\" \"I don't want Jacknto be confused when he wakes up and finds me here. Anyway what if hensays something, we can't risk Cindi finding out and taking himnaway\" \"Do you have any ideanhow much I love you for saying that? Don't worry about that\" \"I can't help it,nwe're just going to have to wait\" \"Awwwww\" \"Don't pout, asnsoon as the divorce is through we can tell everyone, but we have itnkeep it just between us right now\" \"Fine, fine. Butnthis damn divorce better go through fast…\" grumbled Darrenngetting off of Louise. \"It will be best innthe end, you know that,\" she said getting up. \"So… that doesn'tnmean I have to like it right now,\" \"I know but it won'tnbe for long,\" she said kissing him then leaving. She hadn't even gotndown the drive way when she saw Cindi, making her way to the house. \"What are you doingnhere? Still sniffing around my husband ?\" said Cindi herndislike of Louise evident in her voice. \"I was helping himnwith something,\" said Louise politely. \"I think I can guessnwhat you wanted to help him with,\" said Cindi, Louise just threwnher a dirty look and then went to walk away, \"He'll never havenyou back you know?\" that made Louise stop in her tracks and turnnround. \"You see you killednhis baby,\" continued Cindi, \"but me I gave him something youncouldn't\" \"What was that Bo'snbaby?\" \"No, his son, thenapple of his eye. His first child, well not exactly his first younmurdered the first one, and he'll never be able to forgive you fornthat, he might say he has, he might even think he has, but he can'tntrust you. You know it and I know it,\" said Cindi leaving Louisenspeechless. \"What's going onnout here? Cindi what are you doing here? Jack's in bed,\" saidnDarren who had spotted Cindi and Louise out the window. \"I was just tellingnLouise here a few home truths, that's all,\" said Cindi sweetly. \"What are you doingnhere?\" said Darren. \"Can't a wife comenand visit her beloved husband and son\" \"What about yournother child?\" said Darren. \"At my mother's butnI thought we could use tonight for us, not the kids,\" said Cindi innwhat she thought was a seductive voice. \"Right well I'llnjust leave you two to it,\" said Louise, then she turned and startednto walk away. \"Yeah you do it,nwhore. Me and my husband have a lot of making up to do,\" Cindinshouted after her. \"What the hell is thenmatter with you?\" Darren said angrily, he knew something was wrongnwith Louise just by the look on her face, \"Lou, Lou come back\" Louise didn't turnnround instead she turned the corner at the end of the street. \"Just go inside,nJack's in bed. Just wait,\" said Darren. \"Whatever you say,\"nsaid Cindi stroking his arm, \"don't be too long\" Darren didn't saynanything he just took off after Louise. He finally caught up withnher three streets away. \"Lou, stop I saidnstop,\" he said grabbing her arm. \"What?\" said Louisenwearily. \"What happened? Whatndid she say? You know nothing will ever happen between me and hernever, I want you\" \"I know,\" sighednLouise. \"Then what?\" \"The abortion\" \"What about it?\" \"Have you reallynforgiven me?\" \"What? Yes, you knownI have\" \"No I don't. Inhave never seen you the way you were when I did it. I don't thinknit's something you could get over just like that\" \"So that's what shensaid?\" \"Yeah, but I have tonadmit it crossed my mind as well\" \"Look Lou I'm goingnto be honest. I hate what you did\" \"Right,\" saidnLouise tears in her eyes and she made to turn away. \"I hate what you did,nnot you,\" said Darren keeping a firm grip on her arm, \"and you'renright it took a while for me to get it, and even longer to get overnit. But it's been almost 7 years. And yeah I don't think I'llnever be okay with it, but it's not you, it's… I don't evennthink of it as something you did, more of something that happened\" \"But it is somethingnI did\" \"I know, but you werenyoung, you wanted a life and us we would have fallen apart if wenbecame parents when we were that young. I'm glad we didn't\" \"But the abortion didntear us apart\" \"But not for good,nnot if you don't let it\" \"But how can…\" \"I barely even thinknabout it anymore. We have to focus on our little baby that'sngrowing inside you now, not the past. I don't ever want you tontake that ring off, but if you don't feel it's right, I'dnunderstand, well actually I wouldn't but I won't force you. ButnI won't give up, it's taken me long enough to get you to agreenI'll spend the rest of my life trying to get you back\" \"You say that likenyou've lost me\" \"Haven't I?\" \"No. But pleasenwhenever you think about what I did, tell me, talk to me about okay?\"nsaid Louise \"Promise\" \"Okay then,\" saidnLouise hugging her fiancé. A couple of minutesnlater Darren pulled away. \"I'm sorry I havento get back. I left Cindi at the house while I came after you. Inhave to go and get rid of the wife from hell\" \"Yeah I guess you do\" \"It's funny\" \"What is?\" \"I trading the worstnwife in the world for the best,\" said Darren then he kissed Louisenon the tip of her nose, \"I'll see you tomorrow\"[Chapter 16] Chapter 16 It was a week sincenLouise and Darren got engaged, nobody knew about it, not even Katie. nDarren was covering the front desk at work, while his assistant wasnat lunch. Then he heard someone coming in, so he looked up and sawnit was Louise. \"Hi, what are youndoing here?\" he said pleased to see her, he had hardly saw her innthe past week. \"What aren't Inallowed to come and visit a friend at work?\" \"A friend?\" he saidnraising an eyebrow at her. \"What, aren't wenfriends?\" \"Lou seriously isneverything okay?\" \"Yeah, I'm justnpathetic I waited till Eugene went to lunch and all the drivers werenout so I could come and see you,\" she admitted. \"Awww did you missnme?\" he teased \"Yup,\" said Louisenleaning over the counter and gave him a quick peck on the lips. \"Hi, boss sorry I'mna little late,\" said Eugene coming back from lunch. \"That's fine, younreally didn't need to rush back,\" said Darren through grittednteeth. \"So, how can I helpnyou?\" Eugene said to Louise, blushing from head to foot. \"Actually I was herento talk to your boss, the package I picked up last week was in anshocking condition and I want to know why,\" said Louise pretendingnto be annoyed. \"Yes and as I wasnsaying if you would just like to come through to the office I cannfind out who handled the package and find out what happened,\" saidnDarren lifting the counter up and letting Louise through. \"Wow, you're actingnhas improved a lot,\" said Louise as Darren closed to office door. \"I hate this, I hatennot being able to kiss you whenever I see you, and being able to tellneveryone about us and…\" \"Sweetie you'renbabbling,\" said Louise cutting him off. \"Sorry,\" he said,n\"anyway I wanted to tell you that the divorce should be through inna week, all we have to do is wait for the papers to be drawn up andnsign them\" \"Wow how did thatnhappen, last I heard Cindi was holding everything up by trying to getncustody and half of everything\" \"I have my ways ofnpersuading her,\" said Darren mysteriously. \"Okay, either younslept with her or you paid her off. How much did she take forncustody of her son?\" \"$5000\" \"That's shocking, Inwon't sell my baby for anything less than $15000\" \"Well I was going tonoffer 20 but she got in there first and demanded 5, so I wasn'tngoing to argue. But she does get joint custody\" \"What does thatnmean?\" \"It means she takesnhim 2 weekends a month, and the rest of the time he's with us\" \"Oh okay that's notnso bad\" \"Anyway I want tontalk about more pleasant subjects,\" said Darren taking a stepncloser to Louise. \"Oh no you don't Inknow that look, no sex until…\" \"I know, I know, Indon't see why though\" \"Because if someonencatches us we can't really deny anything if we're in the middlenof… But since we're just talking…\" \"Fine, fine but Incan't last much longer, maybe if I give her $10000 it'll gonfaster\" \"No you just have tonbe patient,\" said Louise, \"and you said you wanted to talk aboutna more pleasant subject. I booked an appointment with the doctor, toncheck everything is okay with the baby.\" \"Really when?\" \"2 weeks tomorrow\" \"What time?\" \"Noon\" \"That's great,nwe'll get to see it, we'll get a picture of our little baby,\"nsaid Darren emotionally, as he placed his hand over Louise'snstomach, \"I still can't believe it sometimes\" \"You better, cause Inseriously think I'm gonna get morning sickness soon, I was feelingnnauseas when I woke up\" \"But you're okay?\" \"Yes I'm fine.

Louise had given him his bath, andnshe was now trying to read him a bedtime story. \"It's okay, they're justnsorting things out,\" said Louise pulling him onto her lap. \"Why is Mummy shouting about yournbaby?\" \"Well you know how when Mummy hadnZack, Daddy was upset?\" \"Uh huh\" \"Well Mummy thinks that it's anbit soon for Daddy to have a baby,\" said Louise trying to think ofnthe best way to explain it to him. \"But Daddy's not having a baby,nyou are\" \"But it's Daddy's baby asnwell, and Mummy is a little upset\" \"Oh but why?\" \"Well sometimes grown ups justnfeel like that about some things\" \"Okay\" \"YOU ARE SUCH A SUCKER, BET SHEnCOULDN'T WAIT TO GET KNOCKED UP, SHE'S TRAPPING YOU,\" theynheard Cindi scream. \"WHAT LIKE YOU DID, YOU MEAN?\"nDarren roared. \"Why won't they stop shouting?\"nsaid Jack close to tears. \"Okay, you stay right here I'mngoing to go and tell them to keep it down,\" said Louise, givingnJack a hug. \"You're leaving me,\" said Jacknas tears started to spill from his eyes. \"I'll only be gone for a minute\" \"Okay,\" said Jack his lip stillnwobbling. \"Why don't you go throw into mynroom and cuddle up on the purple chair,\" said Louise, she had annoffice up in the attic, where she had the comfiest squishiest chairnever. \"Okay,\" said Jack. \"Alright then, I'll be up in anminute,\" said Louise getting up. When Jack was safely tucked up innher office, with a blanket and the television on, Louise went downnstairs. \"THIS HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH YOU,\"nDarren was shouting. \"SO YOU FINALLY DECIDE TO SHOWnYOUR FACE,\" shouted Cindi when she saw Louise. \"Yeah, to tell you two get keepnyour voices down,\" said Louise, \"you're upsetting Jack\" \"You mean our son, he hasnnothing to do with you,\" said Cindi viciously. \"Yes, your son and he is upstairsnin tears, so either you two keep your voices down, or you can bothnget the hell out,\" said Louise slightly raising her voice. \"Sorry, we're finished herenanyway. I'll come up and see Jack in a minute,\" said Darren. \"Whatever, just keep it down,\"nsaid Louise going back upstairs. Louise went back upstairs and foundnJack still upset, but now he couldn't hear the shouting. Fivenminutes later Darren found them still in the office, both curled upnon the chair, watching a cartoon. \"Hi,\" he said crouching down innfront of them. \"Has Mummy gone home?\" askednJack. \"Yeah, she has,\" said Darren,n\"I'm sorry if we upset you\" \"Why were you both shouting? Younsaid you wouldn't shout anymore,\" said Jack. \"I know I'm sorry, Mummy wasnangry and I was angry,\" said Darren. \"Why were you shouting?\" \"It's grown up stuff, but Indon't want you to worry\" \"It's cause Mummy's upsetnbecause you and Louise are having a baby,\" said Jack. \"Yeah, that's it,\" said Darrennwearily. \"Come on, it's late, time fornyou to be in bed,\" said Louise, getting up. \"Okay,\" said Jack reluctantly. Darren and Louise both tucked Jacknin and he was asleep as soon as his head hit the pillow. \"So, do I still have to get thenhell out?\" said Darren slipped his arms around Louise's waist asnshe turned out Jack's bedroom light. \"No, I'm sorry about that. Itnwas just, Jack was getting himself in such a state, he hates peoplenshouting. I was just mad,\" said Louise. \"I know, I was just so angry Inshould have thought…\" \"S'ok, I hate seeing him upset,nwe should all be happy instead we're all fighting\" \"I know, I know\" \"I really love that little boy,nyou know\" \"I know\" \"I was afraid I wouldn't, I wasnscared I would be the evil stepmother\" \"He loves you, every time he hurtsnhimself he always wants you, he even loves you despite your cookingnand it took me years to be able to do that,\" teased Darren \"Oi I think I'm a very goodncook\" \"Sorry honey, you're a trophynwife, not a domestic goddess\" \"Well, I won't even be able tonbe a trophy wife, I'll be all stretched out and my body won'tnever be the same\" \"Awww you're gorgeous no matternwhat, and it'll be worth it,\" said Darren. \"Come on, we can't stand herenall night we'll wake him up,\" said Louise indicating to ansleeping Jack.[Chapter 19] Chapter 19 \"Daddy, Daddy, Daddyncome quick Louise is sick,\" Jack screamed as he burst into wherenDarren was sleeping. \"Jack it's 6am, gonback to bed,\" groaned Darren. \"But Daddy…\" saidnJack frantically. \"Go\" \"Louise is sick,\"nhe said quietly. \"What?\" \"She's being sick,nI heard her\" Darren shot up and sawnthat Louise's side of the bed was unoccupied, then they both heardnLouise throw up. Darren and Jack both ran down the hall to thenbathroom where Louise was crouched the toilet. \"Lou are you okay?\"nhe asked kneeling down beside her. \"Yeah, I'mnfan-fucking-tastic,\" said Louise sarcastically, not realising thatnJack was in the room. \"Are you going tondie?\" asked Jack quietly. \"Oh no, no of coursennot,\" said Louise realising her mistake, \"I'm just beingncrouchy because I don't feel well\" ----------------------------------------- \"Honey, sweetie pienoh husband I love so dearly,\" said Louise sweetly that night. \"Yes,\" said Darrennlooking up from the television slightly afraid he knew Louise wantednsomething and when she used those names he knew he wouldn't likenit. \"I'm hungry\" \"Okay, what do younwant to eat?\" \"Um double stuffednOreos, de caff coffee, cucumber, onions and….

One Sunday morning shenhad slept in and by the time she had made down to the kitchen Katie,nCraig, Darren and Jack were all talking about her and her unusualnmood swings lately. Luckily they had the sense to shut up beforenLouise heard them. \"Morning Honey,\"nsaid Darren kissing his wife, \"any morning sickness today?\" \"No none thank god,\"nsaid Louise, \"Hi Katie, Craig\" \"Hey, you look muchnbetter,\" said Katie \"Yeah I had a greatnnights sleep,\" said Louise. \"When's your nextnappointment?\" asked Craig. \"Next week,\" saidnLouise. \"Right in the middlenof the game,\" grumbled Darren \"Yeah and it's thenfinal…\" said Craig and soon he and Darren were debating over whatnthe score would be. While they were stillnarguing Louise slipped some coffee into her cup hoping neither ofnthem had seen her. \"Oh no you don't,\"nsaid Darren taking the cup from Louise before she had even taken ansip \"Hey give it back,\"nLouise protested \"No way you know youncan't have caffeine,\" said Darren \"Go on please justnone little cup,\" pouted Louise. \"Oh I…\" saidnDarren weakening he never could say no to Louise. \"Don't let her,\"nsaid Craig sternly who knew how weak Darren was when it came tondenying Louise anything she wanted. \"No Lou, I'll makenyou some tea instead,\" said Darren \"I don't want tea,\"nLouise grumbled like a child. \"You know I can'tnlet you have coffee,\" said Darren \"Pregnancy sucks,\"nmuttered Louise \"Surely you can'tnmean the miracle of birth,\" said Craig, \"the most natural thingnin the world\" \"Yeah to you peoplenmaybe,\" said Louise as she violently pointed to Darren and Craig,n\"but then you don't have squeeze something the size of anwatermelon out of a hole the size of a lemon\" \"Yeah but you get tonfeel your baby growing inside you that must be amazing,\" saidnCraig. \"Oh yeah it'sngreat. I can't have coffee or alcohol, I'm puking every morningnand I can't even have a cigarette,\" ranted Louise. \"You don't smoke,\"nKatie pointed out. \"Well I'd like tonhave the option,\" said Louise, \"and I have to put up withneveryone wrapping me up in cotton wool\" \"Feel better now?\"nlaughed Darren \"Yeah a little,\" said Louise sheepishly ------------------------------------------- \"Honey,\" Louise shouted at 2:45pm on the 4th of August \"Yeah,\" Darren shouted from downstairs \"My water broke[Chapter 20] Chapter 20 Darren had gotten upnearly that morning, leaving Louise to sleep she was exhausted she hadnjust gotten out of hospital the day before. Darren silently slippedninto the nursery. Louise had given birth to a healthy baby boy atn10pm on the 4th of August after over 7 hours of labour. nBenjamin Matthew McKinley was now 3 days old and had just spent hisnfirst night at home, even though he had been awake most of it beingnfed. Darren just stood over the baby crib and watched him sleep asnhe often did with Louise and Jack. Soon Ben started tonstir, he rolled over and opened his mouth to yawn. He stretched hisnarms and kicked his little legs, just as he was about to screamnbloody murder, Darren reached down and picked him out. Ben wasnimmediately soothed, Darren held Ben close to his chest and rockednhim gently. Although he would never admit it, Darren was jealous ofnLouise, she got to feel Ben growing inside her for months, and shenfelt every time he kicked, whenever he moved. Louise spent the firstntwo days of his life bonding with him, and she was the only thatncould feed because he was still on breast milk. \"Daddy, can I comenin?\" Jack whispered from the door way, scared he would wake thenbaby up. \"Yeah it's okay,nhe's awake,\" said Darren softly. Jack came into the roomnand sat up in the rocking chair next to the window. \"Where's Louise?\"nJack asked \"She's still asleepnso we're going to have keep our voices down, okay? She's stillntired,\" said Darren softly \"Okay. Are we havingnbreakfast?\" \"Yeah come on, I'llnmake us something, but remember…\" \"I know, shhhh,\"nsaid Jack putting his finger on his lips \"Well it's good tonsee your ready for kindergarten,\" said Darren proudly, Jack wasnstarting school next week. \"Hey, what are younthree whispering about out here?\" said Louise sleepily as she stoodnin the doorway of their bedroom. \"We were trying tonlet you sleep,\" said Jack as he went over and hugged Louise. \"Well I'm upnanyway,\" said Louise, \"So what's for breakfast?\" \"Come on I'll makenpancakes,\" said Darren \"Yayyy I love it whennwe have pancakes,\" said Jack excitedly as she ran down the stairs. \"I guess I shouldnhave a baby more often,\" said Louise amused by how excited Jack wasnabout the prospect of pancakes. \"I think you shouldndefinitely try it again,\" said Darren putting his free arm aroundnLouise. \"Let's not getnahead of ourselves I'm still sore from this little guy,\" saidnLouise brushing one of her fingers down her son's face. \"Yeah I guess wencould wait a few more weeks….\" \"Weeks…\"nscreeched Louise, \"keep talking like that and you'll be lucky tonget any EVER\" \"I was only kidding,nwell about trying so soon,\" said Darren \"I know, andnshouldn't you be making me pancakes,\" said Louise. --------------------------------------- \"He's asleepnfinally,\" said Darren relieved as he went into the kitchen wherenLouise was drying dishes. \"In the living room?\" \"Yeah I thought it'dnbe better to put him in the bassinette,\" said Darren \"Thank god, I thoughtnhe'd never go down,\" said Louise They had had a steadynstream of visitors to see Ben all day and they were all exhausted. nJack was with Cindi for the day. \"Yeah he was justnexcited\" \"Shouldn't Cindinhave brought Jack back by now?\" said Louise glancing at the clock. \"They're only anlittle late\" \"Yeah I know but I'mnreally worried Jack will think that we're only interested in Bennand that…\" Darren cut her off withna kiss, \"He doesn't you've made sure of that, in fact I thinknBen has grounds to be jealous that you're paying more attention tonhis brother than to him\" \"Yeah I guess I havenbeen over compensating a little, but…\" \"I know, step mum,nnew baby and all that but he adores you and you would never donanything to hurt him so you have to stop worrying, okay?\" \"Okay\" \"Good, now that Inhave you all to myself…\" said Darren then he lightly started tonkiss Louise's neck. \"Mmmm you know wencan't… not for another 6 weeks,\" she groaned \"I know but thatndoesn't mean we can't have a little fun,\" said Darren as henwrapped his arm around Louise's waist and tugged her into thenmiddle of the kitchen and started to gently sway with her in hisnarms, kissing her neck. \"I hope we're notninterrupting anything,\" said Cindi, with an envious look on hernface as she stood at the back door, with Zack balanced on her hip andnJack next to her. \"No, it's alright,\"nsaid Louise as Darren reluctantly unwrapped his arms from Louise. \"Yeah it's fine,\"nsaid Darren. \"How was your day?\"nLouise asked Darren \"It was okay. nWhere's Ben?\" asked Jack \"He's asleep in thenliving room,\" said Louise \"Can I go see him? nI'll be quiet I promise,\" said Jack \"Okay, but be quiet,\"nsaid Darren Jack noddedndeterminedly and then crept into the living room. \"How was he? Henwasn't feeling very well this morning?\" Louise asked Cindi \"He was fine, I hopenyou're not making him feel second best now that you have your ownnbaby,\" said Cindi Louise lookedndevastated, \"No of course not, did he say something?\" \"No, he didn't havento, mother's intuition. I know my son,\" said Cindi delighted tonknow that she had got to Louise. \"That's Bullshit,\"nsaid Darren suddenly \"Honey, if Jack isnupset we should know,\" said Louise concerned \"He's not, she'snjust being a bitch,\" said Darren getting angry. \"Excuse me, I am justnexpressing concern for my son. Maybe it would be best if he stayednwith me while you two bonded with the baby,\" said Cindi Before Darren could saynanything, \"NO, no way he stays here,\" said Louise heatedly. \"I was just saying,nperhaps it would be best for all of you\" \"No\" \"Louise, are younsending me to stay with Mommy?\" Jack said in a quiet little scarednvoice. \"No, I was justnsaying, you're not staying with Mommy you're staying here withnme, Daddy and Ben,\" said Louise kneeling down to Jack's level. \"Really?\" \"Yes, I promise,\"nsaid Louise hugging Jack, \"Don't you ever worry that you'rengoing anywhere\" \"I love you,\" Jacknwhispered into Louise's ear \"Love you too,\"nLouise whispered back \"You're my secondnMummy, but Bobby Ray said I'm not allowed to have a favourite,\"nJack whispered, \"But you're nicer\" When Jack pulled awaynLouise had tears in her eyes and was receiving strange looks fromnDarren and Cindi who hadn't heard what Jack had said. \"I uh…I'm goingnto go and run a bath,\" said Louise wiping the tears from her eyes. \"You okay?\" saidnDarren \"Uh huh\" \"I'll come help,\"nsaid Jack skipping up the stairs.[Chapter 21] Chapter 21 \"Would you look atnthose two?\" said Katie in disgust, \"it makes me wanna hurl\" shensaid indicating to where Louise and Darren were cuddling up. It was the town'snyearly festival, and Louise and Darren were lying together on thengrass. Darren was lying on the grass, Louise next to him resting hernhead on his chest. Ben was in his pram, awake for a change,ngurgling. Jack and Kyle were playing close by. They looked like anfamily from a TV special. \"It's cute, looknhow sweet are they?\" gushed Lirlyn, \"And they have a new baby\" \"Yeah we know it'sncute, us single people are just jealous,\" said Craig. \"I know I'm goingnto be single for the rest of my life,\" moaned Katie. ---------------------- \"Oh I think he'sndropping off,\" Louise whispered looking over to where Ben was innhis pram. \"Is he? He's notndue for another nap for another half hour,\" said Darren looking atnhis watch. \"It's alright, thenmidwife said it takes a few weeks for a baby to get into a propernroutine,\" said Louise. \"I know but he hasnbeen pretty consistent with his naps\" \"Listen to us, wensound like an old pair of boring parents,\" said Louisendramatically. \"Honey, we are\" \"I'm not boring,\"nLouise insisted, \"and I'm not old\" \"But we are parents\" \"Fine but I'm notnold and boring.\" \"Okay,\" said Darrennlowering his head to kiss the top of Louise's. \"Louise,\" Jacknshouted \"Uh huh\" \"Kyle says he'snBen's uncle, but he's my little brother,\" said Jack \"I am his uncle,\"nKyle protested \"Jack he is. Younknow how Kyle's mum is mum…\" \"Yeah\" \"And Kyle is mynlittle brother\" \"Yeah but you're anlot older than he is, you're my second mummy\" \"Yeah,\" said Louisensitting up, \"Because my mummy had me when she was really young, butnKyle is still my little brother\" \"So… he is Ben'snuncle?\" \"Yes\" \"Oh so he's…\" \"Your step uncle,\"nsaid Darren \"That's weird,\"nJack concluded before going off to play with Kyle once again \"He's right, it isna little weird that my step son's best friend is his step uncle,\"nsaid Louise. \"Yeah, but your justndysfunctional in all ways,\" said Darren \"I resent that\" \"Love you\" \"I applaude yourntiming so I won't kill you\" \"Good. I still lovenyou\" \"Love you too\" \"This is nice,\"nsaid Darren \"Hmmm I know, I couldnfall asleep right here\" \"Don't! I can'tncarry you, Ben and Jack all the way home\" \"Oh okay, just carrynme. Jack and Ben can fend for themselves\" \"You're are sonmaternal at times\" \"I know, but I'm sontired. First thing in the morning I'm investing in a breast pumpnand you can do the night time feeds. I need my beauty sleep,\" saidnLouise cuddling into Darren again. \"What's a… pumpnthingy\" \"It takes the milknfrom me and puts it in a bottle\" \"Why couldn't youndo that weeks ago?\" \"Well it's hard fornbaby's to adjust to the bottle but my breasts are killing me,\"nsaid Louise. \"We could have donenit weeks ago,\" grumbled Darren, \"I loved feeding Jack\" \"Fine I'll ordernone tonight you can give him lunch tomorrow,\" snapped Louise \"Are we having annargument, while everyone in town is looking at us and thinkingn'aawwww don't they look sweet'?\" \"Not an argument justna heated discussion\" \"Okay,\" said Darrennsimply Louise had never feltnso comfortable, just lying on the grass with her head resting on thenlove of her life, well if you didn't include Ben and Jack. Henwould argue with her, (Rick's one definite flaw), but he wouldn'tnlet things spiral out of control when she got herself worked up aboutnsomething trivial. He was always there when she needed him even whennshe was in the city, when she had a problem and she couldn't talknto him she would sit down and imagine she was telling him everythingnand imagine what he would say. He knew how to handle her and hernmood swings, he knew her better than anyone. She was so comfortablenwith him, she didn't have to pretend to be anything she wasn't ornput on make up in case she met him in the kitchen. But what amazednher the most was that she could be completely comfortable, but theynweren't an old married couple, Darren could still send shivers downnher spine and butterflies in her stomach, he just had a way ofntouching her or looking at her. Darren was the best father she couldnhave ever imagined, he was always there for all the important thingsnand it was so sweet how proud he was of Jack and Ben. He carriednpictures of them both and showed them off whenever he could. She suddenly sat up andnleaned down and kissed Darren on lips just letting him know how muchnshe loved and appreciated him. \"Ewww PDA, PublicnDisplay of Affection,\" said Katie, \"Really not necessary and innfront of impressionable young children\" \"It's alright, I'mnused to it,\" said Jack, \"they do it all the time\" Louise couldn't helpnbut laugh at what Jack had said especially since he was a 5 year oldnand he sounded like a 50 year old. \"That is so notntrue,\" said Louise \"It is,\" Jackninsisted \"It's not PDA ifnit's in the privacy of our own home,\" said Darren, \"and anywaynwe don't care,\" then he proceeded to kiss Louise again. \"See,\" said Jack. \"He's right,\"nLouise whispered to Darren \"So I love my wife,nand I still want to….\" \"I think I know whatnyou still want to do,\" laughed Louise \"Isn't it a goodnthing\" \"Well I'm notncomplaining,\" said Louise then she leaned into Darren andnwhispered, \"And I still think my husband is the sexiest guy inntown\" \"Ugh will you twonplease stop rubbing it us single people's faces,\" said Katie. \"Sorry,\" saidnLouise sitting up, then she smelt it, \"Who's turn is it to changenthe nappy?\" \"Yours,\" saidnDarren \"Awwww but I just didnit\" \"I did it before wenleft\" \"Honey will younplease do it again? I gave birth, I went through 7 hours of labournto give you another son…\" \"Alright, alrightnI'll do it,\" said Darren picking up Ben and the diaper bag. \"You've got himnwrapped round your little finger,\" said Craig \"Oh please she'snbeen able to get him to do anything for her since she was 6,\" saidnKatie. \"What can I say? Henjust does as he is told,\" said Louise.[Chapter 22] Chapter 22 It was the day Jack wasnstarting kindergarten, he was so excited. He had woken Louise andnDarren up at 6am so he could start getting ready. The four of themnwere outside the school waiting for Cindi to show up. \"Why isn't she herenyet?\" whined Jack. \"She'll be here,nI'll go and call her again,\" said Darren taking out his cellnphone. \"Don't look sonworried we have plenty of time, school doesn't start for anothernhalf hour,\" said Louise kneeling down to reassure a panicked Jack. \"I know but I wantednyou to be there when I first went in,\" said Jack, \"What if I getnlost, or the other kids hate me and I don't know what to do.\" \"Don't worry you'llnbe fine. Kyle is starting today as well, you might even be in hisnclass and if any of the kids give you a hard time you tell thenteacher or tell Ellie and she'll sort them out. But I'm surenyou'll be fine, what sort of person wouldn't love you\" \"But it's scary\" \"I know it is, butnyou'll be fine I promise,\" said Louise. \"She's on her way,\"nsaid Darren coming off the phone. \"Good, people arenstarting to arrive,\" said Louise \"She's bringing andate,\" Darren said quietly so only Louise could hear him. \"To her sons firstnday of school,\" said Louise \"Yup\" \"Great,\" saidnLouise. \"How are you feelingnnow? You seemed a little worried before,\" said Darren to Jack. \"I'm okay,\" saidnJack, then he started to talk to Ben. Five minutes laternCindi arrived with Zack on her hip and a fifty something balding man. \"Ewwww is that…\"nsaid Louise \"The guy that triesnto pick up housewives outside Wal Mart, yup that's him. He stillnwalks a little funny from where you kicked his little man,\" saidnDarren \"The guy is sleazynwhy would she bring him to an Elementary School?

Doug's face fell,n\"um, uh I… oh\" \"That's a lie,\"nsaid Cindi viciously, glaring at Louise. \"Why would I lie? nLook at him,\" said Louise \"He's my partner,nwe're in love and you have to try and poison us with your lies, youngonna marry him as well,\" said Cindi \"No, no thank you. nI'd rather… well actually I can't think of anything worse thannthat\" \"Partner?

This is my first Cast Away fic and I've taken liberties with this story. I don't own it or any of its original characters. Chapter 1 It had been a day like any other. She had gotten up in the morning; showered and dressed, fed her orange tabby and St. Bernard, fixed her breakfast, and went to her workshop to do some work. Little had she known that this would be the day she would meet the man that would change her life. Bettina happily hummed along to the tune playing on her radio as she made her way back returning from the hardware store to pick up some machinery she needed when she noticed a man standing by his truck with a look of uncertainty. He looked puzzled and he was standing in the road that led to her house drinking from a water bottle and looking at a map. Return to Sender, address unknown, no such person, no such zone. Chuck Noland drove along the highway listening to his favorite Elvis cd and glancing at the map realizing that he had no idea where he was going next. He grabbed his water bottle and took a sip. Chuck still marvelled at the feeling of the cool liquid sliding down his throat. There were a great many modern conveniences that he'd sorely missed marooned on that God-forsaken island; fire from a stove, hot showers, the sound of the toilet flushing, an on and off switch. He took a silent vow that he would remain grateful for all of it. He had survived. Even though things didn't turn out how he'd hoped, every day was a new day. Chuck would always be thankful. Finally, the day had come that he delivered the package. He made absolutely sure that no one but him would; of that he was certain. He had kept the package safe for years. Four long years he'd held onto it. It was his saving grace. It had been his only goal. The package and … \" Well we're not going to talk about her again for Christ's sake!\" He could smell the light, leathery scent. Chuck smiled and looked over at his newly purchased volleyball. Wilson number two sat happily in the truck beside him. He had realized this was an inanimate object, but the one he'd lost at sea had been his only friend during those long years. Since the five weeks he'd lost his special friend, he'd felt empty. Chuck had desperately missed Wilson's musings and annoying ramblings. Upon purchasing this one he'd joyfully found that Wilson's voice had returned, although no one could hear it but him. He welcomed it gladly because it was better than facing the other reality; the reality without Kelly. Pressing down hard on the steering wheel, he shook his former fiancee from his thoughts and pulled over to get a good look at the map. His only regret up to this point was that he'd been unable to meet the owner of the package if only to give his thanks in person. If not for the package he may not have stayed alive. Chuck got out of his truck with water bottle and map and considered the surroundings. The vast fields had stretched on for miles on end. His idea when he left Memphis had sounded easy. The plan was simply to deliver the package and then to blindly point to a place on the map to find his destination. Now faced with such an important decision he felt hesitant. The whirring sound of a truck driving down the road towards him distracted him. She normally wasn't the type who would've stopped and offered assistance, having little faith in men, but there was something about this stranger. He looked harmless and oddly familiar. Standing there Bettina could see that his eyes held a certain sadness and at the same time a little hope. Maybe that's what it was that compelled her to stop. The red, Ford truck turned and pulled up beside him. The smiling redhead greeted Chuck. \" An attractive, smiling redhead. You've always liked redheads, Chuck .\" Chuck had to agree with Wilson that she was quite attractive and friendly. \"You look lost,\" she told him with a smile; the wind blowing through her hair. \"I do?\" Chuck asked uncertainly. \"Because you are.\" To his delight the slender redhead exited her vehicle. \"Where you headed?\" she asked. Chuck found himself disarmed by her smile and sweet demeanor. \"Well I was just about to figure that out.\" She'd made her way to the back of the truck to her St. Bernard and patted its head as the canine panted happily. Bettina was happy that she'd stopped and that she might be able to help. She pointed in one direction. \"Well that's 83 south…\" then pointed another direction. \"This road here will hook you up with I 40 east,\" she paused for a moment then continued, \"um..if you turn right that'll take you to Amarillo, Flagstaff, California, and if you head back that direction you'll find a whole lot of nothing back to Canada,\" she told Chuck pointing back the other way. Chuck was grateful for her helpfulness. He was even more grateful for the kindness in her eyes and the pleasantness of her voice. And her smile. \"I got it,\" he told her quickly feeling like he'd already taken up too much of her time. \"Alright,\" she replied, got back into her truck, and looked at him with a smile. They were a long ways from just about anywhere. Smiling, she told him, \"Good luck, Cowboy.\" \" Yee Haw !\" \"Thank you,\" Chuck told her simply and watched her drive away. \" Well there she goes, Chuck .\" The Ford drove slowly, almost hesitantly down the road. Chuck felt a little remorse about her leaving. He didn't even know her. But he wanted to. Just then he noticed the symbol on the back of her truck. The all too familiar symbol that had inspired him to come all this way was driving off in the direction he'd just come from. The gold wings that he felt had flown for thousands of miles had indeed brought him here. He realized at that moment the gold wings had symbolized something else. It was the symbol for freedom from his island imprisonment. Suddenly he felt compelled to follow. Looking in every direction he considered his options. A gust of wind blew, cooling the sweat on Chuck's brow. An unexplained force pulled his face back to her direction. Turning her way again Chuck longingly gazed at what could possibly be his future. She pulled up in her driveway to her workshop and released April, her St. Bernard and made her way to her new purchase releasing it from its bindings. April barked and bounded towards the front porch. Puzzled by the dog's behavior, Bettina hurriedly made her way to her door and found April sitting quietly next to a package. It was from Federal Express. With crinkled brows she tried to recall what she'd ordered and was unable to figure it out. Her keys jingled as she pulled them out of her pocket and reached for the screen door noticing a slip of paper fall to the floor. She shook her head curiously and picked up the note. With dread she simply stared at it hoping that this wasn't from her ex-husband. \"No, please,\" she whispered. Bettina took a breath and unfolded the piece of paper. She gasped inwardly at the words. This package saved my life. Thank you. Chuck Noland. The words nearly took her breath away. Looking down at the package and back up at the piece of paper in her hand, Bettina wondered how it was possible. When had this package even arrived, she wondered. A slight, comforting breeze tugged at her hair cooling her neck. That's when it occurred to her. He'd brought it; the man she'd given directions to. Now it made sense. He was the man from Federal Express that had been stranded on the desert island for 3 or 4 years. It had made headline news and been in all the papers. As she unlocked her front door Bettina couldn't help but wonder why a man who'd just been returned to civilization would even bother to deliver this package after so long. Holding the door open with one hand she let April inside the house and slowly bent down to pick up the package. It did look weathered yet it had been delivered unscathed. A strong urge to turn around overcame Bettina. She glanced over her shoulder and saw his blue truck in her driveway. A smile curved at her lips as she watched the tall, dark-haired stranger exit his truck and precariously approach her front porch. Chuck couldn't believe he was doing this. The note should've been sufficient. But Wilson wouldn't let it go. It seemed now Wilson's presence was no longer required for Chuck to hear him. So here he was walking up the front steps hesitantly. The redhead didn't seem troubled by him. In fact there was a hint of a smile on her face. She turned and faced him. \"Hey Cowboy! You've come a long way,\" she remarked holding the package up, brushing her windblown hair from her eyes. \" You have no idea.\" Chuck smiled and nodded not knowing what to say observing the bluish tint in her lovely green eyes and uncharacteristically looked shyly down at the ground. Bettina's eyes darted nervously around her property. \"Come in and join me for some iced tea?\" She heard the words come out of her mouth and couldn't believe she said them. She inwardly cursed herself. It was one thing to give helpful directions to a lost stranger on the highway. Inviting him into her house was quite another. It seemed a force stronger than her had taken over. \"I….uh…just came to thank you….\" \"I should be the one thanking you,\" she cut in, nodding. \"I'm Bettina. But only my mother and people I hate call me that. You can call me Tina,\" she told him, extending her hand and felt at ease with him immediately. Chuck smiled at her and found her much prettier than before. \"Pleased to meet you, Tina. My name is Chuck.\" He shook her hand gratefully and admired the smoothness of it. \"Well Chuck, you have no idea how relieved I was that this note wasn't from my ex-husband.\" She narrowed her eyes and lifted a slender index finger and stated pointedly. \"He's a bastard.\" Chuck raised his eyebrows and Tina quickly caught on to his discomfort. \"Come inside, Chuck and let me get you something cool to drink,\" Tina told him feeling better now about her previous invitation. \"Thank you, Tina. I'd like that,\" he replied gratefully following her into her house. Something about Tina had made him feel welcome. He couldn't recall the last time he'd felt this way. She led him to the kitchen and dropped her keys on the counter, gesturing for him to sit at her dining table. \"Now how about you tell me about that note?\" A/N: Hope this wasn't too confusing. When Wilson is speaking it is italicized with quotation marks. There will be an eventual romance...please hang in there with me. Thanks for reading and please review![Chapter 2] A New Beginning Chapter 2 1975 \"Bettina, will ya stop following me already?\" the reddish-brown haired boy asked his little sister with frustration. \"The waves are too high and Mom wanted you to stay by the shore.\" \"They are not too high,\" Bettina told him stubbornly with crinkled brows and hands balled into fists. The boy sighed. \"Mama said she wanted you to be where she can see you.\" \"I'm not a baby anymore, Ricky, I'm 9 years old now! I can surf too!\" Her green eyes showed a defiance that her brother had come to dread. \"Tina, listen, it's too dangerous out there. Look at the size of these waves today. They'd swallow you right up. That's why Mom wants you to stay where she can see you,\" Ricky tried to reason with her. Tears of frustration filled her eyes. \"I can do anything you can do, Ricky!\" Ricky sighed and turned away from her with surfboard in hand. She watched him walk away from her. \"If Daddy were here he would let me!\" Ricky stopped dead in his tracks, hanging his head and laid the surfboard onto the soft sand. He knew it was true and felt the loss as much as she did; perhaps more. Ricky turned and faced his sibling slowly, his green eyes turned soft. Patiently he approached her small deflated figure. \"Daddy's gone, Tina. We can't bring him back,\" he told her softly shaking his head. \"Ricky, c'mon!\" Eddie, a brown-haired teenage boy called out. Eddie was Ricky's best friend and had long become impatient with Bettina's unreasonableness. Bettina looked down, tears spilling from her eyes. \"It's not fair.\" Ricky turned away from his sister and retrieved his surf board. \"Tina, please, just listen to Mom,\" he called out to her and ran to catch up with his friend. She glanced in the direction of her mom only to find that she was sunbathing and thoroughly engrossed in a book. Apparently she was not watching her at all. Bettina kicked the sand. \"Stupid Ricky!\" she muttered. \"Just 'cause he's 14 he thinks he can do anything he wants. I can too surf,\" she said to herself and folded her arms angrily. Bettina did not believe in double standards. From a young age her daddy had instilled in her that girls could do anything boys could do if they set their minds to it. Time after time Bettina's tomboyish nature and diligence had proved him right. When their father passed away however, her mom did not follow through with her father's beliefs and Bettina often felt stifled from who she really was. The nine year old picked up her boogie board that laid by her feet and taking one quick peek again to make sure her mother wasn't watching determinedly set off out towards the ocean. Present The empty pitcher sat on the dining room table between Tina and Chuck who now faced each other smiling enjoying each other's company. April, her St. Bernard laid at Tina's feet. \"And so there you were on that desert island for four years, all you could think about was Kelly, and you return home to find that she had married?\" Tina asked him incredulously leaning over and stroking April's ears and head. Chuck nodded to the redhead slowly and stifled a laugh at her shocked expression. Tina laughed, shaking her head, her green eyes glinted with playfulness. \"I think that's the worst thing I've ever heard.\" \" Good thing you didn't tell her about me .\" Chuck smiled and raised his eyebrows. \"Well Tina, I had a lot of time to think being stranded there. It was four years. Every sort of thought ran through my mind about Kelly and what had become of her. How could she still expect me to be alive? I half-expected that she wouldn't have waited for me,\" he told her half-heartedly and polished off the rest of the iced tea in his glass. \" I told you she wouldn't wait, Chuck. You didn't listen to me .\" It was comments like those that got on Chuck's last nerve and made him want to yell out in response. Tina sat up straight in her chair looking surprisedly in the direction of her window. \"Look at that, Chuck. It's dark already. Time sure does fly.\" Chuck sighed. \"It sure does.\" He knew it was time for him to leave now and he'd been dreading it since the moment he sat down and looked at the beauty across from him. He scooted out his chair and stood up. \"Thanks so much, Tina. It was a pleasure talking with you,\" he told her sincerely feeling an unfamiliar ache in his heart. Chuck also realized that it was wrong to impose on her any longer. He had thanked her and returned the package. His goal had been accomplished and now he had to figure out what was next. It sounded like goodbye. Tina hated goodbyes. They were usually goodbye forever. Her father had told her, Ricky, and her mother goodbye before he boarded his ill-fated flight. Tina's ex-husband had told her goodbye when he left on business to Russia without telling her he had no plans of returning to her. So here it was. A man; a stranger who had miraculously survived extraordinary circumstances whom she barely knew was now suddenly leaving and try as she might, she didn't want him to go. Tina tried to hide the disappointment in her face. \"Where ya gonna go, Chuck? There's nothing around here for miles.\" Chuck shrugged. \"I don't know. I haven't figured that out yet.\" Chuck wouldn't dare hope that this spirited woman before him would offer anything more. \"It's dark and within an hour it will be pitch black. There aren't even any street lights to guide you. I have a guest room up above the workshop. Why don't you stay there for the night? You can figure things out in the morning,\" Tina offered. \"That's awfully kind of you, Tina. I just don't know if that would be a good idea,\" he told her looking down slightly uncomfortable. His blue eyes met her green ones again and he thought he might have detected a bit of sadness in them. \" Um hello, pretty lady, offering to let you stay the nigh t.\" Tina's eyes brightened suddenly and she stood straight up from her chair placing the glass down on the table sharply. She'd made up her mind and nobody was going to change it. \"I insist, Chuck. Now, how do you feel about meatloaf?\" she told him feeling as though she'd settled the matter. Chuck appreciated her offer more than she'd ever know. Something had been bugging him. \"What about your...husband?\" \"You mean my ex-husband. We've been divorced for 3 years,\" Tina told him as she casually made her way to the kitchen and opened up her refrigerator. \"Fiancee, boyfriend?\" \"Nope and nope, Chuck,\" she told him retrieving a tupperware of leftovers off the shelf from the night before. \" Yee Haw !\" \"I told myself after my ex-husband…\"she paused for effect raising her index finger, \"He's a bastard…\" Chuck nodded understandingly. \"After he what?\" he asked curiously, sure that he shouldn't be asking. Tina stifled a laugh and shook her head. \"He…well, let's just say that I promised myself I would never fall in love again.\" Chuck recalled making that same vow after he drove away from Kelly that rainy night in Memphis. He could still feel the way she felt in his arms, her kiss on his lips.The pain of losing her felt like a knife through his heart. He had been a fool to think they could just pick up where they left off. It still hurt to think about it. Chuck absently watched Tina as she busily heated the contents in the microwave, and felt relieved that he wouldn't have to make the long drive that night after all. \"You're very kind, Tina. You can't imagine how much I appreciate this,\" he told her humbly. The beeping of the microwave prompted her to remove the tupperware and lid and stir the meatloaf and potatoes. She looked over at him briefly and smiled. He had kind eyes; as blue as the ocean. Tina instinctively knew this was a man she could trust. \"Do you like meatloaf?\" \"I love it,\" he told her as he joined her in the kitchen ready to offer assistance. She took two plates from the cupboard and dished some meat and potatoes onto the dishes. \"Chuck, I live alone and have for years. It gets lonely.\" Chuck knew what it felt like to be lonely. He'd felt it for four long years. \" Ahem. You weren't totally alone .\" She continued, \"It's nice to have someone to talk to.\" She smiled and snapped her fingers. \"This calls for some wine.\" Moments later, seated across from each other once again, Tina poured wine into their glasses and brought it to her lips. \"Wait. We should toast to something.\" His heart still felt heavy from his last memory of Kelly. The pain had only recently subsided from a sharp pain to a constant ache. Chuck lifted his glass. He couldn't stop the words that came flowing out of his mouth. \"To never falling in love again.\" Tina smiled because she couldn't agree more. Gingerly she lifted her glass to meet his with a clink and looked at the courageous man across from her. Tina found herself amazed by all that he had endured. She could tell he would be a good friend. \"To never falling in love again.\" A/N: There's more to the first part that will gradually be revealed in later chapters.[Chapter 3] Chapter 3 1975 The determined 9-year old tucked the board under her armpit and ran fearlessly out into the cool ocean water. Bettina was a good swimmer and was not put off by the swells which were already taller than she was. Stay where Mom can see you , Ricky's voice insistently echoed in her mind. Bettina shook her head stubbornly and ran full force into the water ignoring her brother's warning. She hopped onto her boogie board and paddled against them trying to make her way out as far into the ocean as Ricky. Paddling steadily she could no longer see her brother. She paddled harder and rode the oncoming waves. One wave almost knocked her off her board but Bettina remained strong using all of her body weight to steady herself. Stay where Mom can see you. She smiled victoriously and wondered if her mother had noticed how well she was doing. Before the next swell reached her Bettina squinted against the brightness of the sun and turned around to locate her mother and discovered that she had drifted so far off she could no longer see her. \"Mom!\" Bettina called out in panic. With her heart pounding, she remembered that she had to paddle and turned around to face a wave that was now looming frighteningly above her. The swell enveloped the girl and her board, somersaulting her young body three times. When she finally reached the top for air, she could barely breathe. The wind had been knocked out of her. She spit out the salty water and brushed seaweed from the red strands in her hair, sniffling hoping to alleviate the discomfort from the water that had invaded her nostrils. She then found herself in between large waves and was unable to see in any direction. Bettina paddled arms and feet furiously and turned around only to come head on with the pointy edge of the boogie board. And then there was blackness. Tina sat up in her bed anxiously. Her heart was pounding and she felt out of breath. She looked around trying to pry herself back into reality. Rubbing her eyes she noticed the early hour. She'd been having that dream. Again. It was the second night in a row. This particular dream she'd had off and on for years. It wasn't so much a dream as it was reliving a memory from her youth. These memories as well as her dreams had served Tina well many a time. While the meaning of it was unclear to her, she often found herself grateful for their prophetic meanings. Tina continued to rub the sleep from her eyes and figuring that her guest still lay asleep, she set out to start her day. \" When are you going to ask her, Chuck?\" Chuck rolled over in the bed trying his best to ignore Wilson's query. \" Chuck, when are you going to ask her?\" Chuck rolled over in the bed again putting the pillow over his head in an attempt to block the sunlight streaming through the exposed crevice of the window and Wilson's nagging question. \" Chuuuck.\" \"I've already told you, Wilson, it's none of our business what was in the package,\" Chuck retorted, irritated and now laying flat on his back. \" Four years, Chuck, and you're not even going to ask? You were stranded on an island for years, then you drive all this way from Memphis to deliver it and you're just going to leave her and forget about it?\" A loud, raspy, grinding noise penetrated the room startling Chuck and silencing Wilson. Sitting up in bed, Chuck glanced at his surroundings. It was an old, comfortable room with wood floors and paneling. Next to the bed was a small nightstand that a lamp and clock sat atop. It wasn't a big room but it was welcoming much like the rest of Tina's house that he'd seen. Chuck stood up groggily scratching his lower back and yawned. He made his way toward the sunlight and pushed aside the heavy, beige colored drapery. From the large picture window, he could see her house and the front yard as well as the road that had led him there. The grinding noise of the machinery continued prompting Chuck to make his way to the adjoining bathroom to splash some cool water on his face. Hurriedly he gathered his cell phone, his keys, and toothbrush he'd brought up to the room and made his way down to find Tina busy at work. Chuck couldn't see her masked face but knew that her brilliant green eyes lay beneath the shield, protected and safe from the glowing, fiery sparkles from the torch. Watching her silently he couldn't help but admire this woman. In the hours he had spent with her he found that she was smart and independent as well as kind and generous. Not wanting to interrupt he looked at the transformed garage and observed the tools, tables, other sculptures, and scrap metals that filled the large area. Out of the corner of her eye, Tina smiled to herself as she noticed Chuck standing there gazing wondrously at her workshop. This was a typical reaction to her. Maybe to others it seemed like it was the type of work for a man. To Tina it was simply work. And it was something she enjoyed. An artist since childhood, she had practiced many other forms of art. Drawing and painting were her favorites until she grew older and explored sculpting with clay. Her ex-husband, Dick, had introduced her to welding and she took to it naturally. Her hard work and natural artistic ability were her livelihood. Tina switched off the torch and set it down carefully. Raising the protective mask from her face she looked apologetically at Chuck. \"I'm sorry, did I wake you?\" \"Uh, no,\" Chuck told her shaking his head. A certain volleyball had. \"Listen, Tina, I just wanted to thank you again for everything and I'd better be..\" Tina quickly interrupted, \"You don't need to rush off. Help yourself to some coffee, Chuck,\" she offered pointing to the house. \"This sculpture has to be done by tomorrow and I just picked up this spot welder yesterday to finish the job. I've been dying to use it!\" Her gloved hand patted the machine fondly. \"I'll be in to join you in a few minutes.\" Chuck opened his mouth to decline. \" Have some coffee, Chuck. Then ask her!\" \"I should be going,\" he told her reluctantly. An uneasy feeling washed over Tina. She could feel knots forming in the pit of her stomach. \"I appreciate it, Tina and really I can't thank you enough but I'd better leave now or else I may never go,\" he responded half-jokingly. \" She doesn't want you to go. Let's just stay.\" Tina smiled warily as she watched the man who in such a short time had touched her heart. He made his way towards his blue Explorer and opened the door dumping a few belongings onto the passenger seat. Chuck could feel her eyes watching him. Truth be told, he didn't want to leave. Deep inside he knew he couldn't impose on her any longer. The kindness that she'd shown him he knew he would never forget. Tina had caught up to him. \"Where are you headed, Chuck?\" she asked curiously not wanting to let on the disappointment she was feeling. Chuck shrugged leaning one elbow on top of the car door. \"Not sure yet. Maybe California.\" Tina's eyebrows shot up. \"California, really?\" \"My half-brother lives in San Francisco. Of course we don't really get along…\" Chuck paused, looking at the ground, and wondered why he'd just shared that bit of information. \"It's just an idea,\" he told her, his eyes meeting hers. \"I'm sorry you have to go, Chuck,\" she told him regretfully. Please stay , she thought. Chuck took this as his cue and sat down on the leather seat. He opened his mouth to say something but instead shut the door. \" Ask her about the package, Chuck! Don't drive away without asking.\" Tina stood there, her apprehension growing at the rumbling noise from the engine starting. \"Wait…Don't go, Chuck. Not yet. I've got this funny feeling….and I can't explain why but….just please stay. Just for today,\" Tina pleaded feeling completely foolish. Here she was a grown woman begging a man she hardly knew to stay with her. Anyone would think she was crazy. If only the knots in her stomach would go away. Chuck was endeared by her concern. He looked up at her noticing the worry lines spread across her forehead. \"I'll be fine, Tina. Really,\" he told her nodding as if to reassure her. Putting one hand on the steering wheel he looked down and put the car in drive with the other. \"Just a second, Chuck. I'll be right back,\" she told him and ran towards her workshop grabbing something small and came back. \"Here you go, Chuck.\" Tina gave him a business card. \"If you ever need a friend...\" Chuck gazed appreciatively at the card and back at the concerned redhead. With a smile he told her sincerely in a low voice, \"I could always use a friend.\" Tina smiled but her heart felt heavy as she watched him slowly drive away. He waved his left arm through the open window. \" Goddammit, Chuck! You didn't ask her.\" Wilson had gotten on Chuck's last nerve. \"Do you know why?\" he asked calmly. \"Because I don't care!\" he shouted. \"I …don't…. care!\" What Chuck didn't notice as he drove away was Tina's puzzled expression. Tina stood there on her driveway watching his blue Explorer drive away. \"What doesn't he care about?\" she asked herself shaking her head. \"Mmrow.\" Tina looked down at her friendly tabby who was now circling around her legs. \"You hungry, Hobbes?\" she asked and picked up the anxious feline, petting his soft, furry head as he nuzzled her fingers appreciatively. Still puzzled by his outburst Tina turned toward her house and decided that some breakfast might take away the nauseous feeling lingering in her stomach. Chuck turned right when he reached the crossroads and considered whether he really wanted to see Dave, his obnoxious half-brother. It was a beautiful day; blue sky and white puffy clouds. He thought to himself that it was a shame that he would have to spend it in the truck. Absently, he pushed the on button for the stereo- the sound of Elvis's voice resounding through the truck. The gentle sounds of the music relaxed him as he noticed the beauty of the scenery. Green, lush fields lined the two lane highway for miles and miles. Driving onto I 40 he realized he needed to consult his map. Chuck reached over on the seat sure he had left it there but couldn't find it. He only found some trash along with his precious volleyball. He looked at the blank road ahead of him and continued to reach over onto the passenger side floor. \"Too bad you don't have any arms, Wilson. I need that map,\" he complained rubbing the floor and reaching underneath the seat while trying to steer the vehicle properly. \"Oh, now you have nothing to say, huh?\" Chuck told the volleyball beside him with an exaggerated expression. The road was straight for as far as his eyes could see so Chuck took the opportunity to bend down and look underneath the seat. Not finding the dreaded map he felt around once again on the passenger seat and picked up a card. It was Tina's business card. Chuck smiled at the gold logo adorning the card. The gold wings held his attention; his right thumb tracing the embossed symbol. The blaring noise of a large vehicle sounded startling him and snapping Chuck's attention back to the road. There was a diesel truck on the other side of the highway. The loud, blaring honking sound of the diesel truck continued. Chuck furrowed his brows unsure of the reason for the noise and checked to make sure he was in his own lane. \"What is this guy's problem?\" Chuck wondered aloud. What Chuck didn't know is that a grey jeep had been tail-gating the large truck. Through his side view mirrors the driver could see the jeep drifting to the side trying to pass him. Disturbed by the jeep's carelessness the truck driver let out several blows to his horn to warn the other driver of the oncoming blue Explorer. It was too late. Out of nowhere the grey jeep pulled out from behind the truck trying to speed past either unaware or uncaring that the blue Explorer was in the same lane. Chuck gasped in fear at the oncoming vehicle coming straight towards him. The jeep didn't have room to pull back into the other lane. In a fit of panic, Chuck reflexively swerved. Horns blared, brakes screeched; the awful sound of metal crunching metal thundered throughout the desolate fields. The shattering of the glass was the last thing he heard. And then there was blackness. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- A/N : Sorry for the cliffie (laughs evilly). I will try to update sometime next week. As usual, reviews are greatly appreciated![Chapter 4] Chapter 4 \"Whiskas, Purina, Iams, no…let's see,\" Tina said pointing along various cans on the shelf at the general store fifteen miles from her home. \"Aw here we go, Nine Lives.\" She read the flavors silently, picked up a few, and dropped them into her basket. \"And one more tuna-flavored can makes Hobbes a happy cat.\" She said to herself grabbing one last can. Betsy, the store owner was talking to Jim, a sixty-year old patron who frequented the general store more for the company. Betsy was a busybody in her fifties with dyed blond hair, eyes too big for her face,and a penchant for gossip. Tina kept to herself as she knew Betsy usually had nothing nice to say. \"Did ya hear about that fellow that was on the news? The guy that was stranded on the island for years?\" Betsy asked him with wide eyes. Jim nodded his head. \"I read about that last month.\" Tina's ears perked up as she casually walked down the pet aisle straining to hear. \"Well, he was driving on I-40 this morning. Got into a horrible car wreck,\" Betsy told him shaking her head and pursing her lips. Tina's jaw dropped and she blinked still trying to register the information. She hurriedly made her way to the counter. \"I hadn't heard. Poor fella. Sounds like he's been through enough,\" Jim responded. \"Got pretty banged up…\" Tina's heart was pounding and she swallowed hard. \"Is he okay?\" she interrupted. Betsy took notice of Tina's worried expression. \"I don't know, Bettina. My daughter works at the hospital. That's where he is.\" Tina hastily dropped her basket onto the counter and dug out a bill from her wallet, practically throwing it at Betsy, taking with her the single can of cat food in her hand and ran out the door. \"I shouldn't have let you go,\" a voice told him remorsefully. It was faint and dream-like. In his mind's eye he could see her. Blond hair now cut short and more practical, and brown eyes full of concern looking down at him. Brown eyes that were more of a hazel color that had guarded him protectively and gave him hope while stranded on that island. His head was foggy and everything ached. But at least she was here. With all his might he willed his hand to reach out to her. Heavier than a brick, Chuck used what little strength he had and lifted his hand slightly. It came up just barely when a shooting pain shot through his right arm causing it to jerk back down to its previous position. \"I shouldn't have let you go,\" she said again. \"Kelly…\" Chuck said weakly, barely able to get the word out and unable to recognize his own strained voice. He wondered if he looked as bad as he felt. There was no response. At that point the logic kicked in. The hated logic that had a way of taking away the peace he was feeling had taken over as if being violently shaken from a pleasant slumber. Kelly wasn't there with him. The painful realization of that hurt more than his injuries. Kelly was with her husband and her child. That was where she belonged. Chuck blinked furiously trying to focus. The light that was too bright for his eyes was finally giving way to reality. The clouded figure before him gradually manifested into the form of a face. And red hair. Tina didn't know what to say. She could barely face the man before her. Stitches and bruises marred his face. He laid there in the bed; right arm and right leg wrapped in bandages and propped onto pillows. White bandages covered Chuck's forehead. If not for his unforgettable blue eyes she may not have even been able to recognize him. He had asked for Kelly. But she wasn't here. Nor was she likely to come either , Tina thought feeling bitterly towards a woman she'd never met. The woman who had been the love of his life had her own life and it didn't include Chuck. It hurt Tina to see him this way. Her heart felt heavy with guilt as though she herself had caused the accident. Tina felt somehow responsible. His eyes had stopped blinking and were gaining cognizance of his surroundings. Brilliant green eyes gazed softly upon him. Chuck observed the tears forming. \"Chuck..\" she paused. \"I….\" \" Told you so.\" Chuck ignored Wilson's sneer. \"Tina..\" Chuck said with a low, labored voice. Tina looked away and wiped threatening tears from her eyes. \"I shouldn't have let you go,\" she told him sadly. \"Not your fault.\" Chuck replied weakly. There were two things he didn't understand. One was what he did to deserve this red-headed angel by his side. And the other- \"What happened?\" he asked her feeling his voice returning. Chuck had been in and out of consciousness for the past few hours. Bits and pieces of conversation with the doctor slowly made it back into his consciousness. Words like lucky to be alive were just a few of them. \"You were in a pretty serious car accident.\" Chuck tried to sit up and Tina helped him adjust the pillows. \"The doctor said that a teenager driving a grey jeep tried to pass a diesel truck and ran head on into you,\" she told him uncomfortably. \"He said you were very lucky. You have a broken leg, broken arm, and many cuts and bruises, but you'll be okay,\" she added gently; the look of astonishment apparent on his face. \"It could've been a lot worse. The teenager didn't survive.\" Chuck looked up and rolled his eyes. He wondered why God didn't just grant him the peace of dying. \" It's not your time, Chuck.\" Having broken an ankle as a child Chuck knew that there would be a long recovery involved...and crutches. As he digested the information he considered the woman beside him. \"How…did you know?\" Tina smiled her first smile since she'd arrived at the hospital frantic and distressed. \"Small town.\" Her dimples appeared charmingly on her face. \"Welcome to Shamrock, Texas, Chuck. Population 2,002. Word gets around quickly here.\" Chuck raised his eyebrows. \"What about my truck and…\" he trailed off to keep himself from saying Wilson. A dark-haired nurse in her mid-twenties walked in with a tray of food. \"How are we feeling, Mr. Noland?\" She propped his pillows up, and adjusted the bed so it reclined into a seating position. \"You look much better.\" \"I feel like I was in a car wreck,\" Chuck joked weakly, rubbing his forehead and discovering the bandage there. His attention was quickly diverted to the tray of chicken, jello, and salad that lay before him. She poured a glass of water and set it gently on his tray. \"I'll be back in a few minutes to get your tray. Eat up, Mr. Noland. You need to gain some strength back,\" she told him and left. Chuck's mouth was dry as though it were stuffed with cotton and longed for ice water. He reflexively attempted to pick up the glass with his right hand but shouted out in pain. Tina covered her mouth then moved to help with the glass. Chuck shook his head and smiled. \"I'm right-handed.\" He used his good left hand instead and took several gulps of the cool, refreshing liquid. \"Your Explorer was totaled, Chuck.\" Tina told him quietly. Chuck looked up at her in shock. It was the last thing that he had that belonged to him and Kelly together. He closed his eyes then opened them again hoping that if he did he would wake up. Maybe it was just a horrible dream. But it wasn't. Tina observed the mournful expression on his face. \"They did recover some of your belongings,\" she told him in an attempt to cheer him up and walked to the chair at the corner of the room. On top of it sat a medium-sized box. Chuck looked hopefully at Tina and the box she was peering into. \"Here's your cell phone, your wallet, a volleyball, a duffel bag, a mangled Elvis cd, and some papers.\" Chuck sighed with relief. All was not lost. Still he had to wonder what he was going to do now. Reality once again showed its ugly face. He couldn't stay in the hospital forever. Prior to the fateful plane crash that stranded him, Chuck had Kelly, his best friend, Stan, future in-laws and other friends with Federal Express in Memphis. The thought of going back to Memphis repelled him. That's where he and Kelly had built a life together. He wasn't ready to go back there. Maybe he never would be. Now beside his dreaded half-brother, he was alone. No other family to speak of, Chuck felt totally alone once again except no longer marooned on an island. That realization hit him painfully like a blow to the head. Maybe it was the way he laid there all wounded and bandaged, or the recollection of all that he'd confided in her the night before. Tina found herself overcome by emotion. The thought just occurred to her. He had nowhere else to go. Tina approached him slowly. He looked lost…and sad. \"Chuck?\" Chuck looked up at her serious face. This was the only way. Tina realized the sacrifice she'd be making for a man she hardly knew, but somehow it felt right and the feeling became surer every second she gazed upon his bruised, stitched face. \"You could really use a friend right now. I want you to stay with me at my house. I have plenty of room. I can help you get back on your ….\" The ringing of the phone interrupted her. Chuck blinked his eyes disbelievingly at Tina. Kind as she was, it was too much too ask. His first impulse was to decline politely. The solemn expression on her face gave him reason to reconsider. The phone rang two more times still as Chuck considered her offer. Unsure of how to respond he reached the ringing phone with his left hand. \"Hello?\" Chuck answered uncertainly. Who could be calling him? Tina waved to Chuck. \"Think about it,\" she whispered as she left the room quietly. \"Jesus, Chuck! Are you alright!\" His friend, Stan's voice sounded panicked. Chuck smiled upon hearing his voice. \"Yeah, I'm okay, Stan. I've been better.\" \"I had my cell phone turned off all day. When I turned it on just now I got the message from Shamrock Hospital that you were in a car accident. So what happened? Are you alright?\" he repeated, his voice raised and unstable. \"A jeep hit me head-on trying to pass a diesel truck on a two lane highway.\" \"Jesus, Chuck!\" \"Well, apparently I was very lucky and only broke an arm and a leg.\" Chuck told him feeling his right leg itchy beneath the thick, heavy bandage. \"Jesus, Chuck! I'm on my way. Where the hell are you?\" \"There's no need, Stan. I'll probably be here a few days and then after that I'll…\" Chuck's voice trailed off as he considered the weight of Tina's words. You could use a friend . \"I'll be staying with a friend here in Shamrock,\" Chuck told him decisively. \"Really?\" asked Stan's puzzled voice. There was a pause. Chuck guessed that it may have been a relief for Stan not to have to leave Memphis. \"Where the hell is Shamrock?\" \"Shamrock is in Texas, Stan. Population 2,002.\" Chuck told him amusedly wiggling the toes on his right foot. Chuck heard his friend sigh on the other end of the line. \"Seriously, Chuck, I can come and get you. Are you sure you're going to be okay?\" \"Absolutely, Stan. I'm in good hands here. I'll be fine,\" Chuck assured him gritting his teeth at the shooting pain from stretching his right leg. \"That's some friend.\" \"Yeah. Good friend,\" he agreed trying to reposition his leg carefully the way he had it. \"Alright, Chuck. Call me if you need anything. Anything. Got that? Oh and do me a favor and use that cell phone I got you. Call me once in a while.\" \"Sure thing….and Stan, please don't mention this to Kelly,\" Chuck told him uneasily. It was enough that he would be disrupting Tina's life. As much as he ached to see Kelly again, he couldn't stand the thought of disturbing her new life. \"You bet. Take care, Chuck.\" \"You too, Stan.\" Chuck's eyes looked up at Tina as she entered the room. He hung up the phone as she walked in slowly. Her eyes were soft and filled with empathy as she gazed upon the injured figure in the bed. The doctor had informed her that his arm and leg would need to be set in a cast. Crutches would be necessary for one to two months, perhaps longer. The doctor's biggest concern was that Chuck would have to be observed for a while to be sure the concussion caused no permanent damage. Unsure still what his answer would be Tina believed that it would require some persuasion for him to accept her help. Chuck looked down at his tray remembering the food in front of him. With his left hand he grabbed a spoon and clumsily scooped the jello with it. Carefully he brought it to his mouth and savored the orange flavor on his tongue before swallowing. \"You don't have to decide right now, Chuck,\" she told him softly with a smile. Tina felt like she was holding her breath. \"My offer is good for as long as you need it. You're going to need help. Please let me help you.\" \" You've got no one. Let her help you, Chuck!\" Still feeling the awful throbbing from his leg, Chuck realized he had to admit that he was in no position to disagree. His vehicle totaled and arm and leg broken, he doubted he could drive much less walk on his own for some time. Chuck closed his eyes and felt tears coming. He wasn't sure if it was the morphine or if he was just overcome with gratitude. For more than four years he'd been completely self-reliant. Now here was this woman who unselfishly opened up her home and life and was willing to sacrifice her time to help him. He sniffled and looked up at Tina's compassionate face, noticing small tears forming in the edges of her own eyes. It was silent and Tina watched him uncertainly. She realized that more than anything she wanted him to be safe. Chuck was a good man and hadn't deserved all that he'd been put through. Confined to solitude and countless hardships, not to mention the plane crash, and returning to find that the woman he'd loved had married someone else; it was too much for one person to bear. Not only had they buried his belongings in Memphis. They had buried his life. Her heart felt too heavy for her chest and Tina hoped she could keep herself from sobbing. Chuck opened his mouth and willed the words to leave his mouth. \"I..\" Tina raised her eyebrows hopefully, wiping away a fallen tear. \"What is it, Chuck?\" Chuck swallowed his pride, blinked back tears, and spoke sincerely in a low voice. \"Tina, thank you, I could really use a friend.\" A/N: Hello...hello...hello? Anyone there? (sound of crickets chirping) lol. I would love to hear what you think![Chapter 5] Chapter 5 72 hours later Chuck found himself seated in the passenger side of Tina's truck, riding along the bumpy road. Her truck, he noticed to his dismay did not have the best suspension. Every time they hit a bump his injured arm or leg would bounce around causing Chuck to grit his teeth in pain. \"I can't thank you enough, Tina,\" he told her bracing himself for an oncoming bump. Tina sighed and looked sidelong at the man beside her. He no longer looked pale. The bruises had just begun to fade and his arm and leg were set in a cast. \"You know how you can thank me, Chuck?\" she asked him wearily. \"By not thanking me anymore. You've thanked me enough for one lifetime.\" \" Yeah, enough with the thanking already!\" Chuck opened his mouth to respond but she interrupted. With a pointed finger she told him, \"I'm a firm believer in two things, Chuck. One is what comes around goes around. Not that you should expect it…but that if you're really in a bind someone will be there to help you.\" \" Uh…it was only you and I on that island.\" Chuck shrugged his shoulders. \"Still..\" \"The other is that things happen for a reason,\" she told him somberly, observing the stitches on his face and arm, realizing this was not something that would be easy for him to accept. \"Okay, now why…\" She interrupted him again, \"It's not for us to question why, Chuck. Just to accept things as they come and trust that it's all a part of a bigger picture,\" she told him matter-of-factly. \"Things usually end up working out in the end. Maybe not the way you thought but..\" \" This chick is crazy.\" Chuck interrupted, \"I'm sorry for saying so, Tina but I just can't believe that's true.\" Tina turned right onto her street. \"You can believe what you want. But that's how I feel and that's the way I've always lived my life.\" She pulled up into her driveway, shut off the engine and looked into his eyes. \"And that way of thinking has served me well,\" she told him with a smile and a wink. Tina exited the truck. \" Uh huh…and look at her, here all alone and desperate enough to help your sorry a…\" \"Stop it! Stop it, Wilson!\" Chuck whispered furiously. \"Just don't talk anymore!\" he uttered through his teeth. \" I'm still here!\" \"Easy does it now,\" she told him as she helped him onto the crutches exiting out through the driver's side. \" Easy does it, Chuck. We don't need any more accidents.\" Clumsily, Chuck struggled to gain balance on the crutches as Tina walked closely beside him ready to catch him if he should fall. Step by unsteady step, slowly Chuck staggered his way up her front porch steps and into her house. Tina smiled at him, her eyes shining brightly. \"Welcome home, Chuck,\" she announced pointing in the direction of her living room where she had a sofabed all made up for him. On the makeshift bed Hobbes laid cozily and gave Chuck a welcoming meow. Chuck smiled gratefully to Tina and made his way into the cheery room. Everything about it screamed home to him. From the pleasing plumeria scent that filled the space to the comforting blue color that covered the walls. Bookshelves aligned the walls on both sides of a cozy fireplace. A large television sat pleasingly across the sofa. An inviting easy chair sat between the sofa and an end table. He couldn't resist and his injured forearm was killing him. Chuck retreated to the easy chair with Tina's assistance and handed her the crutches. \"This is perfect, Tina,\" he told her out of breath. This had been the most moving around he'd done since he was in the hospital. Tina surveyed the surroundings, nodding her head. \"It'll do for now. Once it's easier for you to get around we can move you into the guest room down the hall,\" she told him then noticed his grimace. In a flash she was at his side. \"Are you alright, Chuck?\" \"I think the pain pill wore off,\" he told her, frowning and slightly adjusting his forearm onto the arm of the chair. With a concerned brow, she rushed off to retrieve the needed items. Chuck settled himself into a more comfortable position on the chair. It was large, overstuffed, and was upholstered in a rich, crème color. Chuck smiled, closing his eyes and sighed to himself in the cushy chair. As he rested his head back he was startled by the sensation of a soft lapping of a wet tongue on his fingers. April, Tina's St. Bernard sat cordially beside the chair licking Chuck's right hand. Unable to freely move his hand he leaned over and fondly pet the canine with his left. \"I see April is happy to have you here,\" Tina observed amusingly as she set down a glass of milk and a couple of pills on the table. Chuck gratefully popped the pills into his mouth and took a gulp of the white liquid. \"Thanks, Tina and April's quite a dog.\" Tina smiled, \"She was a stray. She was wandering out on the highway when I found her; all skin and bones, fur matted together, and the poor thing was starving.\" She leaned down to stroke April behind the ears. \"She's the best dog I've ever had,\" she added. \" Hey Chuck, you and April have something in common. You were both strays!\" \"Oh by the way, here's the box with your stuff, Chuck,\" Tina told him after retrieving his things from the truck. She set it down on the floor in front of him. \"So you like volleyball?\" Tina asked him lifting the packaged ball in the box and inspecting it. \"Sometimes,\" Chuck answered wryly. \"This is great, Chuck!\" Tina told him enthusiastically bouncing the package up and down. \" Tell her to stop doing that!\" Chuck smiled with satisfaction watching her. \"I used to be on the Varsity Volleyball team. I haven't played in years.\" \" Jesus Christ!\" Chuck's smile became even wider as she tossed it back and forth between her hands. \" This isn't funny! Chuck!\" \"Maybe after you've healed up we could play,\" Tina suggested. \" You've got to be kidding me.\" \"You know, Tina, I think I'd really like that,\" Chuck told her happily. \"So tell me what you were like before you were stranded, Chuck,\" Tina requested then took a bite of chicken she'd prepared for dinner.[Chapter 6] Chapter 6 The damp, musty scent of the cave assaulted his senses. Chuck blinked his eyes disbelievingly at the markings on the walls. Countless tally marks decorated one wall assisting Chuck in keeping track of the days, months, and years. This can't be happening , Chuck thought as he reached for the priceless timepiece that bore Kelly's photo. It had been his favorite likeness of her and it was the way he had always hoped to remember her. The rescue; the return to Memphis, the accident- had it really happened? Chuck's heart pounded and a lump formed in his throat. Suddenly he felt like it was hard to breathe. This can't be happening . \" It isn't real, Chuck,\" Wilson's voice told him. Chuck looked around desperately for the stuffed volleyball with hopes that if he could at least see it or touch it, his mind could try to make some sense of what was happening to him. \"Wilson!\" he called out frantically searching the enclosed space inspecting the crevices and openings. Suddenly a light illuminated the cave, commanding Chuck's attention. Quickly he ran to the opening and peered out at the rocks below. He tried to look up but the light shone too brightly for his eyes. Instead he concentrated his attention on the volleyball. Chuck climbed down from the cave and scoured the shore, the water, the rocks; his manner frenzied, and his mind racing, a feeling of hopelessness overcame him. \"Wilson!\" he still cried out. A glowing light from above shined on him, commanding his attention once again. Chuck looked up but the brilliant incandescence caused his eyes to water as if staring straight into sunlight. Quickly he used his hand to shield his eyes from the brightness. \"Chuck…turn around,\" a voice called out to him. Startled by the voice but overcome with curiosity Chuck turned around. There was a loud clanging noise of a pan crashing to the floor. \"God dammit!\" Tina yelled startling Chuck from his dream. Chuck sat up in the sofabed quickly, ripped from sleep, trying to catch his breath, and looked around the room. \"God damn, son of a bitch, mother f&#[Chapter 7] Chapter 7 \"Hold still.\" \"I am,\" he told her scratching the itchy, scaly skin below the cast on his forearm. Covered in a cast for weeks he likened the feel of it to that of a reptile. \"I'm almost done,\" she told him as she smoothed the creamy ointment onto the long cut on his forehead. \"Tina, do you think this is really necessary?\" he asked looking up at her determined face from the toilet seat in the restroom. Chuck didn't really mind Tina's soothing fingers aiding his progress but he wouldn't have told her that. \"I do,\" she replied and began applying the healing aid to the scratches on his left arm. \"Look, it's been three weeks since you got the stitches removed and it really is remarkable how well your skin is healing.\" He looked skeptically at her. \"The doctor never said to do this.\" \" Just let mommy do it.\" \"Chuck, it couldn't hurt and look at you-you're looking more and more like yourself everyday.\" \" And less like Frankenstein.\" She twisted the cap back on the ointment tube satisfactorily. \"The doc said that your arm's doing so well that you may be able to get the cast removed next week.\" \"I can hardly wait.\" Chuck had begun to feel the strength returning to his arm and noticed that when he stretched it the shooting pain had faded to almost nothing. \"You know I can do it myself,\" he told her gesturing to the ointment. \"I'm aware of that. But will you?\" \" No.\" She had a point. However, he wouldn't admit to looking forward to Tina's gentle assistance. In the three and a half weeks since he came to stay with her he found himself undeniably smitten with the lovely redhead. It was the little things. Little things like the smell of her hair as she held onto him tightly, assisting him into the truck. Or a whiff of her perfume as she quickly passed by him. Or the way her green eyes sparkled when she smiled. Or the gentleness of her tone when she spoke. Chuck could've easily named off a hundred things that he loved about her. The realization came clearer and clearer everyday. Whether he was sitting across from her engaged in a board game, or performing his one-handed tasks at her side, Chuck had come to realize that in Tina he'd not only found a good friend but his perfect match. Falling in love had not been a part of his plan; very much the opposite, in fact. Not that Chuck had much use for plans since he'd been rescued. Since his fateful visit with Kelly that rainy night any semblance of the old Chuck seemed to have disappeared. He was now the new Chuck. And the new Chuck had been very content to remain as he was in Tina's house completely happy that he could be near her seven days a week. \" Chuck, look alive!\" \"Chuck?\" Hoping that he hadn't just been gazing adoringly into her eyes, his attention snapped back to his arm and back up at her face again. \"A package came for you earlier from Fed-Ex. I set it on the sofa for you,\" she told him stepping back and handing him his crutches. If she were honest with herself, she would've been able to admit that she was terrified of the contents in that envelope. Weeks had passed since the accident and everyday Chuck grew stronger. It would probably be another month before he got his leg cast removed. Tina hated to think of what would happen when he didn't need her anymore. She felt a closeness to him she'd never experienced with anyone. Not even her ex-husband. Tears started to form in her eyes and she left the restroom quickly. Tina moved to the kitchen and tried to appear as though she was not watching as he sat on the sofa, tearing into the package. She imagined it contained an offer for Chuck. He held an important position for that company at one time. More than likely they wanted him to return as soon as he was able. The thought of him leaving was too much for her to bear. It was true that she hadn't sorted out her feelings for him. But she knew that when he gazed upon her with his ocean-blue colored eyes that it would start her heart racing and prompted a flurrying feeling in her stomach. Chuck held an expression of an uncertainty as he ripped open the large envelope within the package. Her breath held, she watched as he silently read the contents. An unfamiliar musical ringing sound startled Tina and she found his cell phone next to her house phone. Chuck looked up. \"Is that my cell phone?\" he uttered to himself. \"Tina,\" he called out. \"Will you grab my cell phone, please?\" Without a word, she handed the small device to him as the music of the ringing continued. He looked up at her with a smile and answered the phone with a puzzled expression. \"Hey Stan! Great to hear from you. Yeah, I'm doing much better.\" As tempted as she was to stand there and listen, she resumed her hiding spot in the kitchen. \"Well the leg cast will come off in about another month but the arm cast possibly next week. So how are you…..well I have it right in front of me. I haven't actually finished reading it yet. What do I say? I can't believe it, Stan. This was…unexpected to say the least.\" Tina peeked over and while balancing his cell phone with his neck and shoulder he was smiling, holding the letter with his right hand. \"Pain and suffering, Stan? Oh come on…\" he sighed and then there was a pause. \"Well I'm glad you're on my side. Of course I'm going to accept it.\" Her hand hit her mouth, covering it as she stifled a loud gasp. It was silent for a bit. \"Alright I'll let you get to your meeting. Hey, I sure haven't missed those,\" he laughed. \"What's that, Stan? Another surprise? My heart can barely handle this one.\" He laid the letter down and shuffled through the attached sheets. \"Well, I can hardly wait. Hey, I don't know how to thank you. You're right, I just did. Bye, Stan. You bet.\" Tina heard the beep of the phone as he hung up. She held threatening tears at bay. \"Tina?\" he called out, craning his neck. \"Tina. Come here! Great news!\" She took several breaths and reminded herself to stay calm. Regaining her composure she walked with a smiling face into the living room. He gestured for her to sit beside him. \"It's unbelievable, Tina.\" Her heart sunk as she prepared for the news. \"Stan, my buddy from Federal Express, well he somehow got them to give me…\" She held her breath. His eyes lit up. \"Severance pay.\" \"Really, Chuck? Is that what this letter is about?\" \"Yeah. I don't know how he managed it, but hey, I don't want to know,\" he told her as he rifled through the papers again. Tina was confused. \"So, Chuck, they're not offering you your job back?\" Chuck's head popped up and caught the anxious expression on her face. He shook his head. \"No.\" Tina let out a sigh of relief and smiled. \"When I was rescued they offered me my job back….but I turned it down. I just couldn't go back to the way things were before. They told me to take some personal time and think about it. So, before I left Memphis I told them that I wasn't interested….and now this.\" Tina flew into his arms, tears of delight shone in her eyes. \"I'm so happy, Chuck.\" He held her close and suppressed the urge to run his fingers through her hair. She backed away from him and corrected herself, \"I mean, I'm so happy for you.\" Chuck smiled back at her. \"He also said there was another surprise but that would come later.\" \"That's great, Chuck. I have a surprise for you too. I moved your things into the guest room,\" she told Chuck standing up and reaching for his crutches. Chuck opened the door to the guest room and beamed at the comfortable setting. As he gazed around the wallpapered room, he noticed his things had already been put away. His clothes hung neatly in the open closet. His papers and personal items sat atop the dresser and next to a full-size bed sat a nightstand. On top of the nightstand sat an alarm clock, lamp, and his good buddy, Wilson. Chuck smiled appreciatively at her as he sat on the bed. \"Thanks, Tina.\" She nodded as she saw his eyes turn to the volleyball. \"I was going to throw it in the closet, but figured that it must have been special,\" she told him as she plopped on the bed beside him. She leaned over and opened the drawer to the nightstand. With a smile she pulled a red marker out and closed the drawer. \"There's something I've been meaning to do, Chuck.\" Chuck looked at her curiously. \"What's that for, Tina?\" She smiled mischievously, holding up the red marker. \"I've been waiting to sign your cast for the longest time now.\" He leaned his cast towards her with a smile. \"Well, there you go.\" Tina wrote the words: 'Welcome Home, Chuck…..Love,' paused, and then continued. 'Your Tina.' Chuck read the words aloud and felt like he could just kiss her then and there. However her eyes were fixed on Wilson. \" What's she looking at?\" She fiddled with the cap nervously and looked from Wilson back to Chuck. \"What?\" Tina smiled, feeling slightly embarrassed. \"Have you ever been tempted to... draw a face on a ball?\" ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ THE TRUTH IS OUT THERE Seated side by side on the sofa sharing a bowl of popcorn, Chuck and Tina looked more like an old married couple than just good friends. The two had reached a level of comfort few couples reach after years of marriage. Platonic though they were, Chuck's shoulder was always a welcoming place for Tina's head. Comfortable and content, the two sat watching television and enjoying each other's company. Chuck sighed as he munched on a mouthful of popcorn, watching the two main characters, played by a male and female, who were FBI agents on an unending search to explain mysterious and inexplicable crimes of a supernatural nature and most times found themselves in over their heads. Tina lifted her head up and looked at Chuck noting his frustrated expression. \"What?\" He looked down at her. \"It's just that we've been watching these reruns for three weeks now…and one's alway s trapped inside with the monster, lunatic…etc…and the one on the outside never calls for backup!\" Tina rolled her eyes and laid her head back on his shoulder. \"Aw Chuck, what would be the fun in that?\" Chuck's brows were furrowed. \"Yeah, but Tina, come on,\" he said in a tone of annoyance, \"and didn't this show go on for years?\" \"Yes.\" \"So did Mulder and Scully ever end up together?\" Tina cocked her head to the side and looked at him with a curious smile. \"Why do you ask that?\" Chuck kept his eyes straight at the television although he could feel the weight of Tina's gaze. \"They have chemistry.\" \"You think so?\" she asked him with a small smile. \"Are you kidding me? They're hot for each other. You can just feel the sexual tension.\" Tina giggled. \"One day I'll rent the movie for you.\" \"There's a movie?\" Tina nodded and he continued, \"If Mulder were any kind of man he would've kissed her or at least told her how he felt.\" \"Yeah,\" Tina agreed. \"But then things would've gotten weird chasing aliens and monsters and all,\" she told him and nibbled on some popcorn. Chuck thought about it. \"Maybe.\" He nudged her. \"So how did it end, Tina? Tell me.\" She looked at him incredulously taking note of the playfulness of his tone. \"I'm not going to tell you that.\" \"Oh. I see, you're going to subject me to sitting through years of X-Files reruns to find out-\" \"Absolutely,\" she agreed heartily. \"Now shush, I can't hear what Mulder's saying.\" \"You only watch this show for that Mulder character.\" \"Mmm hmmm.\" she responded affirmatively. \"And what about you? You're not going to tell me you don't have the hots for that redhead, Scully?\" \" She's got you there, Chuck.\" \"Well, I do like redheads,\" he laughed. Tina scoffed and nudged him. \"I'm more of a redhead than she'll ever be.\" \"Oh really?\" he asked amusedly shoving another handful of popcorn into his mouth.. \"Yes,\" she told him defensively. \"In all the places that matter.\" \" gasp!\" Eyebrows raised, he looked at her. \"Tina, I can't believe you just said that.\" ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Minutes passed by quickly and the hours even quicker as Tina startled awake to the noise of the television. She found herself laying like a human blanket over Chuck, who was soundly sleeping. Stifling a yawn, she reached for the remote and shut off the television. The moonlight peeked in through the open window and as she sat up on the sofa she admired his shadowy sleeping form. Watching the steady rise and fall of his chest, Tina reached for the blanket and covered him. For the briefest moment she thought she saw him stir. \"Chuck,\" she whispered. \"Are you awake?\" There was no response. He was sleeping as peacefully as a newborn baby. Tina faced forward and made to stand but thought better of it. Minutes passed and she studied the man who lay asleep before her. The long faded cut that lay across his forehead drew her attention and she was tempted to run her finger across it. Or to run a gentle finger through his wavy, black hair. Or even lay a tender kiss on his stubbly cheek. Instead she resumed her earlier laying position with her head on his chest until their breathing was in unison once again. Her lids felt heavy and she breathed a contented sigh. Curling her fingers around his shirt, she whispered, \"Don't ever leave me, Chuck.\" Moments later she was asleep. Chuck opened his eyes slowly and watched Tina's angelic sleeping face and smiled. He shifted his position slightly and braced her back with his left arm. Chuck's heart was beating softly and he felt truly alive again...and happy. \"I won't,\" he whispered and with her in his arms he fell happily back to sleep. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- A/N: More to come![Chapter 8] Chapter 8 \"I haven't worn these in years. Do you think they make me look fat?\" Chuck observed the slender redhead before him modeling a dark blue pair of Levi's. His eyebrow raised as he admiringly watched the gracile beauty twirl and considered her question. \" Oh, please.\" Many adjectives came to Chuck's mind. Stunning, beautiful, alluring, and many others but certainly not fat. Observing the self-consciously worried look on her face he told her, \"Tina, thirty pounds and a muumuu couldn't make you look fat.\" Her expression turned to an embarrassed smile. \"C'mon, you're gorgeous,\" he added lightly. Tina's eyes sparkled and a grin came about her face. She couldn't help herself and flew into Chuck's arms appreciatively. Puzzled, Chuck embraced her wondering why such an idle comment would elicit such a reaction. He didn't mind though; she felt good in his arms and he would've liked for her to stay there. \"That's the nicest thing anyone's ever said, Chuck,\" she murmured holding him tightly. \" That was way too easy.\" \"I certainly hope not, Tina,\" he told her almost drunk now by the sweet scent of her perfume. If his arm hadn't been so itchy at that moment it would've been easy to just stay like that with her and forget that he had a doctor's appointment. \"We're going to be late,\" he told her regretfully. Tina pulled away from him uncomfortably. \"Oh right,\" she said and opened the front door for him to hobble out. The mail truck pulled up to her mail box and Chuck watched from the front porch as she rushed to retrieve the day's letters. She smiled and greeted the carrier politely as he handed the envelopes to her. The mailman drove away looking back at Chuck and then at Tina. Aw shit , Tina thought shaking her head and walking up her front porch and into the house, dumping the mail on the kitchen table. \"I think he liked you,\" Chuck said a little jealously as she locked the front door. \"And I'm sure he didn't think you're fat either,\" he told her lightly. Tina walked beside Chuck out to her truck. \"I'm sure that's not what he was thinking about.\" Chuck and Tina entered the front door happily with a large pepperoni pizza and a large bottle of wine.[Chapter 9] Chapter 9 The bright sun rose over the town of Shamrock. The invasion of sunlight peeking through the window awoke her. That and the loud purring of the cat. Tina could feel the warmth of the sun on her lids and shut them tighter as if to deny the morning its entrance. Hobbes's furry body lay nestled atop her head nearly hogging the pillow. The achy feeling behind her eyes seemed to increase with the echo of the feline's incessant purring. Slowly she opened her eyes, rolling over, and facing away from the light. Cozy and relaxed, she pulled the blankets up to her neck and attempted to fall back to sleep. An image of Chuck holding her flashed in her mind. Then her eyes snapped open. Tina searched her mind frantically trying to distinguish what had happened the night before from what had been a dream. The harder she tried to think, the more the aching persisted. Her heart pounded as she recalled the warm feeling of him holding her in his arms. And how good his arms felt embracing her. Chuck had told her that she was beautiful and that he wanted her. Had that been a dream, she wondered. Her thoughts went back to Chuck. He had been so charismatic. His eyes had been so hypnotic and his lips so inviting, his kiss so…. She nodded to herself. There had been a kiss. It had been intimate and delightfully sensual and, she thought wryly, ended too quickly. Tina got up and showered and willed the ache to go away. Her memories still fuzzy, she struggled to recall what if anything happened after. In the kitchen she busied herself making coffee. She peeled off the lid to the coffee can and began scooping the grounds into the coffee filter. Her mind still occupied with Chuck's kiss she scooped and scooped… \"That's going to be some strong coffee.\" Startled by Chuck's voice she gasped, taking notice of the large pile of grounds that lay before her. \"You scared me, Chuck,\" she said without looking at him and emptied the grounds back into the coffee can. He came up beside her. \"I'm sorry,\" he told her softly. \"Good morning.\" Chuck wanted to kiss her. He wanted to hold her. He wanted to pick up from where they left off. Having made it known already, if anything were to happen, he had decided that it had to be on her terms. She looked up shyly at him and smiled into his warm blue eyes. \"Good morning, Chuck.\" Quickly she tore her eyes away, moving from his curious gaze and poured water into the coffee maker. \" Oh yeah, this isn't a bit awkward.\" Deflated, he looked down. \"How are you feeling this morning?\" She looked at him with a fond smile. Always, it seemed his concern had been for her. Her fingers went to her head and she rubbed at her right temple. \"I've been better.\" Nodding, Chuck thought to himself sadly that perhaps last night had been nothing more than a dream to Tina. Or a blur. He hobbled to the cupboard and reached for some pain reliever then poured some water into a glass. As she reached for a coffee cup he set the glass in front of her with a couple of aspirin. Smiling, she looked up at him gratefully. He returned the smile as he watched her swallow the pills. It was silent for a moment as they stood facing each other. The beating of her heart was so loud she wondered if he could hear it. Her eyes wandered to his lips and she could almost feel the way they had felt on hers only the night before. Blue eyes full of longing looked upon her green ones. Her face came closer to his and her breath shallowed as she leaned even closer. The loud ringing of the phone startled the pair and Tina jumped backward. Free from the spell she smiled at Chuck and reached the phone on the nearby counter. Facing away from Tina, Chuck hung his head. He closed his eyes and heaved a sigh. They were almost there again. He desperately hoped they could get there again. \"Hello?\" The phone, it seemed to Chuck, was something of an ornament, as no one ever called Tina. She usually received orders by fax or e-mail so it was ironic that when someone finally did decide to call her that it would be at this most crucial moment. Chuck opened the cupboard and reached a coffee mug. \"No, thanks. I'm not interested.\" \" Great! A telemarketer!\" \"Oh, oh….well yes, he's here. Just a moment.\" Puzzled, Tina handed Chuck the cordless phone. Chuck shrugged his shoulders as he held the phone to his ear. \"Hello…Yes this is Chuck Noland speaking.\" Tina moved to the pantry to retrieve some cat food. \"Really? I…don't know what to say. Sure, I'd be interested.\" Tina snapped her head up to him and gave him a questioning look. \"Alright then, next Monday, here, 1:00 o'clock.\" He motioned for a pen and paper and she complied. \"Sure thing, thanks. Bye.\" He hung up the phone and set it down on the counter. He had a serious expression and made his way to the dining room table. \"I thought it was done.\" \"Chuck? What was that all about?\" she asked him and joined him at the table. \"That was Gloria from the Pampa News. Their newspaper wants to run a story about my experiences on the island.\" Tina's shocked expression turned to a smile. \"That's great, Chuck!\" \"I don't understand, Tina. After I was rescued I thought the story had been done. Over.\" \"Chuck, that may be the case in Tennessee. But here in Texas, you're practically a celebrity. I'm sure they want something more in depth than just a news report. It's a fascinating story.\" Chuck had a doubtful look on his face. \"I agreed to accept the interview. It's extra money and I'm not doing anything else with my time.\" He got up from the table and made his way to his coffee mug. Confused, he looked back at her. \"Wait a minute, how did they know I was staying with you?\" Tina smiled and rolled her eyes. \"Small town, Chuck. Population 2,002.\" \"Are you sure you want to go through with this?\" Tina looked down at him, her face somber, her eyes determined. \"I've never been as sure about anything in my life.\" \"Okay.\" He nodded. \"Alright, Big Boy, light my fire.\" Chuck gazed upon the items they'd collected. With one hand Chuck dug a small pit then reached a hollowed piece of wood. He added some bits of grass and dry leaves to some tiny twigs on top. Satisfied with that, he grasped a stick he'd searched out earlier that had a rounded, pointy edge. Bracing himself into a comfortable position he began to rub the pointed edge of the stick against the wood. At first there was nothing so he wiped his forehead and took a breath. Before continuing, he added a few more dried leaves to his pile of kindling. Surrounded by boulders Tina and Chuck had made their very own makeshift firepit. She stood and watched as he continued. Chuck picked up a sharp rock and ground it against the pointy corner of the stick, to sharpen it. Steadily he rubbed the corner of the stick again onto the wood then picked it up to a brisker pace. Tina caught a glimpse of a small stream of smoke and gasped as Chuck quickly blew some air onto it. \"Chuck!\" she clapped, jumping up and down excitedly. He continued to grind the stick until he had a flame at which point he motioned for twigs and some wood. \"You did it! That was amazing!\" \" I'm not impressed.\" \"Well I never had a cheering section before, but thanks, Tina….now do you want to do the honors or shall I?\" \"Right,\" she said and headed to the porch and retrieved the unopened Fed-Ex package which lay protectively guarded by April. Tearing open the package, she dumped the contents onto the dirt next to Chuck and laid the package back next to her faithful St. Bernard. \"How about we both do it?\" Tina picked up a card and some letters from the pile and gingerly dropped it onto Chuck's fire. The items were quickly swallowed up by the flames. Blindly she grabbed her wedding picture and handed it to Chuck. He didn't look at it. Seeing a photo with Tina and her ex-bastard wasn't an appealing prospect to him. With not even so much as a glance he set it face down onto the highest burning flame. The picture quickly curled into smoky blackness. Chuck surveyed the pile beside him and reached for a cassette tape. Unable to help himself, he considered what sort of use the tape inside may have served. It may have been handy as a binding of some sort. It wouldn't hold very tightly, he knew for sure. He read the name of the artist with a grimace. \"Air Supply?\" \" I'm all out of love, I'm so lost without you.\" Tina glared at him. \"Oh, shush,\" she told him as he added it to their bonfire. A red, thick notebook caught his attention and they both reached for it simultaneously but Chuck grabbed it and examined it. Large golden wings adorned the front cover. \"What is this?\" \"Please, Chuck, oh God, don't open that.\" Her saying that made him more curious so he quickly opened it to the first page. \"Chuck!\" she reprimanded as she snapped it away from him. Away from his view, she opened it back up and silently skimmed through the pages. Chuck looked at her curiously. With a sigh she told him, \"It was a journal I kept while he was away.\" She snapped it shut. \"It was a pathetic account of how much I missed him when he was gone.\" \" Burn, baby, burn!\" The sadness shown in her eyes and Chuck reached out to her. \"Shall I?\" Wearily she handed him the journal. Without a look he threw it into the fire. \"Next?\" he asked but when he looked at her he saw a single tear fall from her eye. \"Tina, you alright?\" She wiped her eye and scooped the rest of the contents, dumping them angrily onto the burning flames. \"I'm going to be.\" She looked like a grieving widow who'd never been afforded the opportunity to grieve. With an aching heart, Chuck gestured for her to sit with him, holding out his arm to her. A brief moment passed and she obligingly joined him at the fire resting her head on his shoulder. He enfolded her into his embrace and planted a single kiss on her head. Silently the two watched as the remnants of Tina's marriage became consumed by the sparkly flames until there was nothing left but burning embers. \"Thank you, Chuck. I couldn't have done this without you,\" she told him sighing into his shoulder. \"I'm so lucky to have a friend like you.\" Chuck hid the look of disappointment on his face and nodded. \"I feel the same way, Tina.\" \" Hey Chuck, don't you have something you would like to add?\" It was quiet for a moment and Chuck cleared his throat. \"I …I have something to add.\" She looked at him curiously as he reached inside his pocket and pulled out a tiny picture. \"I've always kept this with me but I think it's time to say goodbye.\" He didn't look at Tina, his eyes transfixed upon the likeness in the photo. Tina held her breath as she watched him gaze upon the face in the picture. It was Kelly; his Kelly, and despite her growing feelings for Chuck she couldn't help feeling his sorrow. Minutes passed and still he held the small photograph which had once belonged to the timepiece. To Tina it felt like an eternity. Every moment that he continued to gaze upon it, Tina felt like she was dying inside. Finally and without any words, Chuck leaned forward and tossed the last tangible reminder he had of his former love. With a sigh he watched the flames quickly devour the miniature portrait. She noticed the serious look he wore and nudged him lightly. \"Say, Chuck, what else can you do that you learned on the island?\" Chuck snapped out of his dismal mood and looked up thoughtfully. \"Not much that's incredibly useful here, Tina.\" She nudged him again and smiled. \"Aw, c'mon, Chuck.\" Unable to resist her dimpled smile, he cleared his throat and used his best Native American accent. \"Indian Brave Hop Along make-um rope from branches, tie logs together and make-um raft from tree. Use-um door from port-a-potty for sail. With a giggle she asked him, \"So what else can Hop Along do?\" \"Hop Along make-um spear from big stick. Catch dinner.\" He paused and looked at her amused face. \"Use-um blade from ice skate to give-um self root canal.\" \"You didn't!\" she exclaimed, mouth open wide in disbelief. Noticing the incredulous look on her face, he continued. \"Hop Along make-um water bottles from coconuts.\" \" Make-um good friend from volleyball.\" Stormy clouds loomed overhead and fat droplets began to fall from above dotting their faces. Tina looked up at the grey sky and to the cast that braced Chuck's leg. \"Well here comes the storm, Chuck. We've gotta get you inside. That cast has to stay dry.\" Chuck nodded to her as she helped him up and along into the house; April trailing behind them. The rain fell down lightly at first putting out the smoke from the fire. The following downpour washed away the sad memories of a ten-year marriage the way that soap cleanses dirt. The home that once was filled with loneliness now embraced warmth and companionship. No longer would Tina feel haunted by the harmful words of her ex-husband. Nor would Chuck feel haunted by the image of a love once lost. The rain continued to fall hard and heavy that evening and flushed away the sorrow and bitterness of two broken hearts. Long awaited closure had been its special gift. A/N: Thanks and big hugs to my two reviewers! It means so much to know that someone is actually reading and enjoying the story. Any and all feedback/constructive criticisms are appreciated. More still to come.[Chapter 10] Chapter 10 It was difficult at first. The memories of that night had indeed haunted them both. Two people who are around each other constantly are bound to develop feelings for one another. At least that's how Tina had rationalized it. Here it was, one week later and Chuck still hadn't mentioned the kiss and had not behaved out of the ordinary. Tina wasn't sure if she felt relief or resentful about it. The more she thought about it, the more it seemed the latter. One thing she wondered is how much longer she could wait for him to hold her in his arms again the way he did that night. The morning after the kiss they seemed to come so close to that place. It was the place that separated the warm, easy friendship they shared to an intimate, deeper bond. It was a place that Tina craved and until now she hadn't realized how much. Chuck was determined to remain a gentleman. One thing he did not want was to ruin their friendship so he vowed not to pursue her unless she made the first move. This seemed like something of an impossibility given their close proximity to each other on a regular basis. But Chuck remained strong. And Wilson never let him forget. Tina decided that for the time being the best course of action was to work. Lately she'd fallen behind on some of her orders and spent hours on end in her workshop. He tried not to take it personal. Yet for the past week she had gone out dutifully every morning to her workshop and only came in to eat. Sometimes her work would consume her and after dinner she would fall to bed exhausted. Chuck missed her sweet presence in the house and as the days went on he couldn't help but feel like she was avoiding him. Things may have stayed that way if it hadn't been for Stan's second surprise. It was a clear, sunny Saturday and the Texas heat was starting to get to him. With June quickly approaching it was bound to get worse. Thank God, he thought, that in a matter of weeks his remaining cast would be removed. He found himself constantly wiping down the beads of sweat that formed around the openings. It was getting close to dinnertime and Tina had been working for hours. With much difficulty and a smile, Chuck staggered his way down to the workshop with a large glass of lemonade. Out of the corner of her eye she could see him approaching and quickly shut off the torch and the spot welder as Chuck slowly made his way towards her. Tina tugged off her mask and wiped her forehead as Chuck handed her the refreshing drink. She gave him a smile. She had missed him too. She missed the easy companionship they had with one another. Now it seemed her head was filled with so many questions. It was true he hadn't taken advantage of her that night. Since then he'd made no advances toward her; shown no special interest. Had it been a fluke, she wondered. While it should have been easy to go back to the way they were, somehow it wasn't. And every day that passed her feelings for him grew stronger. Tina would hardly throw herself at him. The blue-eyed man stood before her watching; as magnetic as ever, as she drank a tall glass of lemonade that he'd just prepared. Still she wanted to hug him for his thoughtfulness. And his kindness. Had she not been so sweaty she would've hugged him, she told herself. \"You are a lifesaver, Chuck. Thanks,\" she told him gratefully and took another big gulp of the lemonade. Chuck nodded his reply when they heard the sound of a vehicle pull up into the driveway. It was a dark, green Ford Explorer. Tina and Chuck looked questioningly at it. A delighted grin overcame Chuck's face as he recognized the driver. \"Stan!\" He hobbled towards the truck as Stan shut off the engine and opened the door. \"Surprise!\" Stan said as he exited the vehicle. He leaned in and embraced his friend. \"Wow, Stan….it's more than a surprise. It's like a shock!\" he told him laughing and shaking his hand. Stan sized up his friend. \"Look at you, Chuck. You look almost normal,\" he told him then looked back in the direction of the driveway. Tina stepped up to them and smiled. \"Hey, Stan, I'd like for you to meet my very good friend, Tina.\" Stan's eyes met her green ones approvingly and shook her hand. His eyebrows raised. \"Oh so you're the friend who's been taking care of my buddy?\" Despite the dirt on her face and the protective gear she was wearing Stan could see she was quite a beauty. \"It's a pleasure to finally meet you, Stan. Chuck's told me so much about you. What a wonderful surprise it is to have you here.\" Stan gave her a wink. \"The pleasure's all mine, Tina, but I'm not the surprise.\" Just then a black sedan pulled up behind the Explorer. Stan happily waved to the driver as she stepped out and gestured for her to join them. An attractive well-dressed lady in her late forties walked towards them and took Stan's hand. She had dark brown hair and a shy smile. \"Hello, Honey,\" he told the woman. \"Tina and Chuck, I would like for you to meet my fiancée, Eileen.\" Chuck gaped and smiled at the woman who had put such a happy expression on his friend's face. He reached out to shake her hand. \"It's so nice to meet you, Eileen.\" \"I'm so happy to meet you, Chuck, and relieved that you're alright. We were very worried about you when we heard about the accident,\" she told him and then faced Tina. \"So you must be the friend who's been taking care of Chuck?\" Tina nodded. \"It looks like he was in very good hands,\" she told her with a wink. \"After all no one could take as good care of man as a woman.\" Tina smiled at Stan's fiancée and liked her immediately. After a brief tour of Tina's house, quickly she showered and the four headed in the sedan towards a quaint Italian restaurant about twenty-five miles outside of town. The four sat around the table chatting; the flickering light from the candle slightly illuminating their enthusiastic faces as they spoke. \"I have not been to a restaurant in ages!\" Tina exclaimed happily. She couldn't remember the last time she'd been able to sit in a public place with friends and just feel comfortable and happy. Stan and Eileen looked at her questioningly. Chuck gestured to his crutches. \"We don't get out much.\" He quickly changed the subject. \"So when's the big day?\" he asked the couple who were seated side by side holding hands affectionately. The pair looked at each other and laughed. \"Actually, when we get to Vegas…but we're not quite sure when that's going to be,\" Eileen responded with a giggle. Puzzled, Chuck looked at Stan. \"I don't understand.\" \"We're eloping, Chuck.\" Mouths open wide, Tina and Chuck beamed at the happy couple. \"Wow!\" the two said in unison as they watched the two lovers engage in a kiss. Chuck and Tina looked at each other uncomfortably as Stan and his fiancée continued to lock lips. After a few moments Chuck cleared his throat. \"So?\" Tina chimed in, \"So?\" Stan and Eileen parted hesitantly as they faced Chuck and Tina. \"No church wedding, ceremony; friends, family, and whatnot?\" Chuck asked them. The two lovers laughed. \"We've been together long enough, Chuck. We don't need anyone's permission. We've both been through that whole wedding routine. Stan got on one knee three nights ago and told me he wanted to marry me. So, of course with a stop here, that's what we're setting out to do.\" Stan nodded. \"That's what we want.\" \"I'm so happy for the both of you,\" Chuck said but it was too late because the pair's lips were locked again. \"At it again.\" Tina faced Chuck looking down and cleared her throat. \"I think I need to use the little cowgirl's room.\" Elaine pulled away from Stan's embrace. \"I think I'll join you.\" \"So is it serious between you and Chuck?\" Tina applied some lipstick to her bottom lip in the mirror, feeling the heat rising to her cheeks. \"Oh…Chuck and I aren't….We're just good friends.\" \"Really?\" the older lady questioned. She looked curiously at Tina in the mirror as she combed her hair smooth. \"Could've fooled me,\" she said with a pleasant smirk. Tina was tongue tied. \"There's really nothing…\" \"Look, Tina, I just met you and Chuck and forgive me for saying so but good friends don't look at each other the way the two of you do.\" \"So a journalist came over and interviewed me. She didn't say when she was going to run the story, though.\" \"That's great, Chuck. Get your story out there.\" Chuck and Stan glanced around to make sure the ladies were out of earshot. Stan looked at his friend suspiciously. In a brief couple of hours, Stan could see the change in Chuck. Maybe it was his relaxed manner. Or maybe, he thought, it was the permanent smile affixed to Chuck's face. This was hardly the same individual who visited him at two o'clock in the morning after leaving Kelly's house. \"Wow, Chuck, Tina's gorgeous. You've really done well for yourself.\" Chuck knit his eyebrows. \"What? No, Stan. We're just friends.\" Stan gave him a look of bewilderment. \"Why?\" Chuck shrugged his shoulders. \"Well because we're just friends, I suppose.\" Stan leaned back in his chair and observed his long-time friend. He knew Chuck wasn't telling the truth. \"You look great anyhow, Chuck.\" Stan grinned evilly at him. \"I guess there's nothing like hanging out with a hottie like Tina to make you forget all about Kelly, eh?\" Chuck sat straight up in his chair with a disturbed look on his face. \"Hey, Stan, don't talk about Tina that way.\" Stan smiled triumphantly at his response. \"Now you see, if you had no interest in Tina other than friendship then that remark wouldn't have bothered you.\" Chuck narrowed his eyes at his friend. \"Don't go using your little lawyer tricks on me, Stan. It's just not what you think, that's all.\" \"Maybe it isn't Chuck, but she's into you .\" Chuck watched Stan with interest. \"She's been hanging on your every word.\" Chuck shook his head but Stan continued, \"Listen, Chuck, I just want you to be happy like Eileen and I.\" Seizing the opportunity to change the subject, Chuck quickly said, \"So tell me about Eileen. I really like her, Stan.\" \"I'm crazy about Eileen. We met through mutual friends. And the first time I saw her I knew that we'd end up together.\" He looked up as the server brought their drinks. Stan took a sip of his drink and set it down. \"You know something, Chuck? After Mary passed away I thought I'd never have a single happy day again. It took a long time for me to get over losing her, but I know she would've wanted me to remarry. Now look at me, I feel like a teenager again. Being with Eileen is like a natural high, \" he laughed. \"I really want you to have the same kind of happiness.\" Chuck took a sip of his drink as the smiling ladies rejoined them at the table. Tina sat down beside Chuck and looked at Stan and Eileen. \"I was just telling Eileen that they should spend the night at my house,\" Tina informed him and Chuck nodded. \"We have plenty of room.\" Stan shook his head. \"That's very kind of you, Tina but we're headed towards Austin and we'll rent a room there.\" Tina shrugged her shoulders at Chuck then focused their attention back on Eileen and Stan who had fallen back into each other's arms again. \"Not again.\" Leaning in towards Chuck's ear Tina smiled and whispered to him, \"Maybe they should just get a room now .\" After having said their fond farewells Eileen sat in the passenger side of the sedan with the car running as Tina headed inside the house. Chuck and Stan stood talking outside on the driveway. \"Well, I wish you all the best, Stan. You and Eileen both. Come back again and see us.\" \"It was great seeing you, Chuck. You don't know how relieved I am that you're doing better. I felt really bad about not being here for you after the accident. But now I can see that everything has worked out for you.\" Chuck nodded and smiled as he watched Stan head back towards the car. Puzzled, he looked at the Explorer and back at his friend. \"Hey Stan, aren't you taking the Explorer?\" Stan turned around with a smile. \"I thought you'd never ask, Chuck.\" He pulled keys out of his pocket and handed them to Chuck. \"This was your second surprise. The Explorer is yours. Courtesy and best wishes from Federal Express.\" Speechless and open-mouthed Chuck stared back and forth from the beautiful dark, green truck to the keys in his open palm. \"I…I…can't-\" Stan cut in, \"Of course you can.\" He closed Chuck's fingers over the keys. \"She's brand new, Chuck, except for the miles I put on her from Memphis. Enjoy,\" he said then embraced his friend who still stood there with a shocked expression. \"It was great seeing you again.\" Chuck looked at the keys in his hand and smiled gratefully at Stan and waved goodbye to the happy couple as the sedan backed up. Stan's window rolled down and he called out, \"Treat her right, Chuck and you'll be happy with her for years to come.\" Tina came outside and waved goodbye to Eileen and Stan then noticed they were driving off without the other vehicle. \"Chuck?\" she noticed Chuck standing completely still with a silly grin on his face. \"Chuck? What about the Explorer? They're not just going to leave it?\" Chuck stood silently letting his thumb run across the gold Federal Express keychain. He would never be able to repay this kindness. With a chuckle he finally let it sink in. \"Surprise.\" A/N: A huge thanks to Nate, whose kind words encourage me to keep posting! Thanks so much! Feedback is always appreciated.[Chapter 11] A/N: Happy Halloween! A very warm thanks to Nate, whose kind reviews make my day! Feedback is always welcomed and appreciated. Chapter 11 After a full inspection of Chuck's new vehicle and a short test drive, Chuck and Tina excitedly made their way inside the house. \"Four wheel drive, dual air bags, 5-disc cd player, leather interior...\" \"Four liter engine, seven passenger seating, automatic windows and locks...\" Chuck added. \"Purrs like a kitten, and of course, the new car smell,\" Tina added with a smile as she made her way to the kitchen. \"I still can't believe it.\" \"Me neither!\" Tina replied. She had mixed feelings about the brand new Explorer Stan had gifted to Chuck. She loved the truck and was absolutely thrilled when she drove it, but part of her felt that now he had a way of leaving. Selfish though it sounded, she couldn't help it. Tina resolved not to show it and just be happy for him. \"Do you want some coffee?\" Chuck nodded. \"Yes, thanks.\" Then he shook his head. \"It was enough of a surprise just for Stan to show up here,\" he paused. \"Then to announce that he's eloping!\" Tina nodded as she poured water into the coffee maker and scooped the coffee into the filter. \"Yeah, that's pretty surprising.\" \"I just can't believe how happy he looked.\" She pressed the on button on the coffee maker, turned around, and smiled at him. \"I really liked Stan and Eileen. They are such nice people. I'm sure they'll be very happy together.\" \"They did get a little carried away, though.\" \" A little!\" A giggle escaped her lips. \"Uh yeah,\" she agreed and walked around the corner into the dining room and leaned against the nearby counter. \"I mean, c'mon, all that making out at the dinner table. I felt like saying 'we're still here!'\" he told her a little uncomfortably and saw her laughing expression begin to turn serious as she gazed into his blue eyes. \"I know,\" she agreed softly. Her breath caught as she felt his eyes lock onto hers. For a brief moment, Tina began to see Chuck, as though she were seeing him for the first time-and in those amazing eyes she was captivated by the attraction she saw there. Tina saw what Eileen had spoken of-and now as he stood there, irresistably adorable; the picture of vulnerability with his crutches, trapped in awkward conversation; she found herself magnetically drawn to him. \"It was a gratuitous display of affection,\" he told her softly. Dressed in a black button down blouse, and denim knee-length skirt, her red hair curled and make up on, he'd thought she never looked so beautiful. He wasn't aware of the words he was speaking anymore as she slowly inched her way towards him. \"Completely gratuitous.\" Tina felt like she no longer had any control of her feet and even though he was only a short distance from her it seemed like a mile. \"Unnecessary.\" \"Unwarranted.\" Her heart was pounding and her eyes darted back and forth between his eyes and lips. Tina stood before him only inches away. Her green eyes sparkled as she gazed up at him and they stood there silently for what seemed an eternity. Silently she willed him to kiss her. \" Don't do it, Chuck.\" Stan's words played over and over again in his mind. She's into you, Chuck . He watched her as she leaned closer to him, her lips parted slightly. \"Chuck...\" she uttered. \"Tina…\" With both hands he grabbed her closing the distance between their two bodies as the crutches fell sharply to the floor. His lips claimed hers, gently at first, then passionately as he stepped forward and pulled her in even tighter. \" Chuck!\" Her fingers ran through his hair and down his back as he brought gentle hands to her face. \" Chuck!\" He ignored Wilson and stayed happily trapped within her kiss enjoying the feel of her, and the sweet scent of her perfume. \" Stop this right now!\" The weight of Chuck against her seemed to make her drift backward until she was backed up against the table. Out of breath, he pulled away from her to see where they were as she felt the edge of the table digging into her back. He backed away from her slightly allowing her to lean forward a bit and surveyed the cluttered table. Chuck steadied himself and leaned forward and pushed the mail, newspapers, and salt and pepper shakers off the table with one quick brush of his arm. With a swoosh and a couple of thuds the objects landed on the carpeted floor as she watched him with an amused smirk. He looked at her and winked. \"I've always wanted to do that.\" Then he grabbed her by the waist and leaned her backward onto the table. \" Are you crazy, Chuck? Or just downright stupid?\" Chuck couldn't understand for the life of him why Wilson wouldn't shut up. But at this point he didn't care. He had the woman of his dreams in his arms and that was all that mattered. Long, slender arms reached out to him and pulled him on top of her and met his lips eagerly once again. Tina was in heaven. She couldn't seem to get enough of him. Every inch of her was covered with goose bumps as he ran possessive fingers down her arms and back; embracing her securely. As he kissed the sensitive flesh on her neck she could feel the desire mounting. \" Goddammit, Chuck, listen to me! Stop this right now!\" At that moment Chuck felt like he would really like to stab that blasted volleyball. But still he paid it no mind and let his hands wander to the opening of Tina's button-down shirt. Her breath caught as his determined fingers began to undo button after bothersome button. Tina's mind was whirling and she wanted very badly to continue but it seemed she had a voice inside her screaming desperate warnings-yelling for them to halt. There was a thump suddenly and then a meow. The two looked up as Hobbes's furry face looked questioningly at them. \"Mmmrow.\" Tina giggled and reached out to the orange tabby. \"I forgot to feed you, didn't I?\" Deflated, Chuck hung his head. \"Can't you feed him later, Tina?\" he asked her huskily. \" Saved by the cat.\" Tina sat up on the table and kissed Chuck softly on the lips. \"No, Chuck,\" she told him regretfully. Gently tracing the outline of his jaw, she focused her gaze on his lips so that she wouldn't get caught in the magnetic force of his eyes again. With a sigh, she told him, \"I want you, Chuck...so badly, but… I think that we shouldn't rush.\" Deep inside, Chuck knew she was right. He would never have admitted it. Looking into her sparkly green eyes, he could see that Tina was his now. And it didn't matter how long he'd have to wait so long as he knew that he wouldn't have to live without her. With a sigh, he looked down and stepped backward so she could scoot off the table and watched as she regrettably fastened the buttons back on her blouse. Her eyes caught sight of his two legs standing evenly on the floor and she smiled excitedly. \"Look, Chuck, you're standing on both of your legs without your crutches! Is your leg okay, does it hurt?\" her expression turned to concern. Absently he looked down at his legs and then began to lean on his right leg. He felt some numbness and a feeling like his leg had fallen asleep. But there was no pain. With a smile he looked up at her worried face. \"It feels okay. It doesn't hurt.\" She threw her arms around him excitedly as he moved side to side shifting his weight back and forth experimentally. Holding her in his arms they moved together slowly, rhythmically as though they were dancing. If there had been music playing at that moment it would've appeared as though they were enjoying their first dance as a couple. Once again their eyes locked and he leaned down to kiss her but before their lips touched they were reminded of another hungry animal. April had made her way over and jumped onto Chuck, nearly knocking him over. \" Haha! Saved by the dog!\" Tina pushed the St. Bernard down and smiled up at Chuck. \"I have to feed these animals.\" She pulled away from him and grasped one of the fallen crutches off the floor. \"Just in case, maybe you ought to use one until the doctor says it's time to remove the cast. You don't want to reinjure your leg, Chuck.\" He nodded appreciatively as he took the crutch from her and held onto her hand, caressing her fingers, not wanting to let go. She smiled back at him, squeezed his hand gently, then pulled away. As Chuck tested out his newfound ability Tina quickly fed the hungry dog and cat. The moon was high in the sky and Tina observed how dark it became so quickly through the window. With a yawn, she told him, \"I'm tired, Chuck. We've had quite a day,\" she said with a wink. She moved towards Chuck and embraced him. \"I'm going to sleep,\" she said looking into his eyes. With a smile he whispered, \"May I join you?\" Smiling, she nudged him and pulled away. \"Do you really think that would be a wise idea?\" Her whole body was screaming it's objections and she felt as though now his lips were pulling her in with some strange magnetic force. Her lips began to make their way towards his, but she thought better of it and kissed him on the cheek. With a heavy sigh she backed away with a look of longing in her eyes and headed up the stairs. \"Can't blame a guy for trying,\" he called up to her. \"Good night, Chuck. Sweet dreams.\" \"Good night, Tina.\" I love you, he thought, but the words didn't follow. He could hear the sound of her door closing upstairs and hobbled over to turn off the kitchen lights. A yawn overtook him. Tina was going to sleep. Chuck had a volleyball to deal with. Tina awoke to the sound of angry voices shouting. Or just one voice rather. It was Chuck's. Confused, she sat up in her bed and strained to listen but couldn't make out anything coherent. Quietly she crept downstairs and stood outside his door with her hand poised to knock. \"Can't you just for once let me be happy?\" Tina wondered who Chuck was talking to. Stan? With a slight gasp she wondered if he was speaking to Kelly. Quickly she ran to the kitchen to see if the cordless phone was sitting in its base. There beside it lay his cell phone. Puzzled, she hurriedly made her way back to Chuck's room. Chuck's raised voice sounded aggravated and she leaned into the door to listen. \"All I'm saying is that Tina is different. I can't help what happened with Kelly.\" On the other side of the door, Tina listened intently with her hand covering her mouth. \"Stop giving me a hard time. I know what I'm doing.\" Her heart pounded as she listened and every sort of thought ran through her mind. Maybe, he was sleepwalking. Or sleeptalking. Maybe , she thought, he was having a nightmare . \"Sorry? Oh I'll be sorry?\" he shouted out incredulously. A really loud, lucid nightmare .With eyebrows knit, she shook her head, thoroughly perplexed. There was a pause. \"Why do I listen to you?\" he demanded angrily. \"The only thing I'm sorry about, Wilson, is that I bought another goddamned volleyball!\" There was a banging noise that sounded like an object slamming full force against a wall and Tina backed away from the door, startled. Her breathing quickened. Definitely not a nightmare . She could hear him muttering on the other side of the door and just stood there utterly bewildered, her feet seemingly glued to the floor. She knew she should have knocked and made her presence known but she'd never heard him speak this way before. It frightened her. Hastily and without warning Tina heard the sound of the doorknob turning forcefully and the door opened before her. Chuck stepped out quickly with one crutch and nearly ran into Tina. Judging by the alarmed, upset look on her face he could see that she'd heard everything. With wide eyes he stood facing her, his heart pounding in his chest as he fearfully searched his mind for what to say as she looked questioningly at him. Only two words came to mind. \"Oh shit.\"[Chapter 12] Chapter 12 With head in hands, Tina sat on his bed as Chuck looked at her pleadingly. \"Are you telling me the truth, Chuck?\" He sat down beside her and took her hand in his. \"Yes. I am telling you the truth.\" He searched her eyes as she faced the volleyball on his nightstand. It was quiet for a moment and then he spoke again. \"I didn't tell you about this before, Tina, because...\" he looked down and sighed. \"Because I didn't want you to think I was crazy. I haven't told anyone.\" She considered the note of desperation in his voice. \"So is Wilson, um… is he speaking to you now?\" Chuck shook his head. \"No, he doesn't speak to me constantly. Mostly when he finds things that are objectionable.\" She stood up in a huff. \"Does Wilson find me objectionable?\" \"No, no, Tina,\" he got up and faced her. \"Wilson thinks you're hot.\" \"Wilson thinks I'm hot,\" she repeated. A giggle escaped from her lips. \"A volleyball thinks I'm hot.\" Deflated, Chuck turned away from her. \"I knew I shouldn't have told you. I should've just kept it to myself.\" She approached him and laid her hand on his shoulder. \"No, Chuck, I'm just kidding,\" she told him and laughed again. \"I don't think you're crazy. I think it's a miracle that you were able to come away from that island with any sanity.\" He turned and looked into her eyes, his own countenance shadowed with vulnerability. \"So…are you sure you're not going to try to have me committed to some mental institution?\" he asked her quietly. Tina looked up thoughtfully. \"Well, tell me this,\" she said with a hint of a smile. \"Will Wilson tell you to step in front of a speeding vehicle?\" Chuck shook his head. \"Or …tell you to jump off a cliff?\" she asked. Again, he shook his head. \"Or murder me or my pets in our sleep?\" \"You're mocking me.\" Her arms slid around his waist and she met his eyes. \"No, these are important questions. You have to ask yourself when and why he speaks to you.\" \"Wilson says he's looking out for me. He doesn't want to see me get hurt again.\" It was quiet for a moment as Tina stood watching Chuck, weighing his words carefully in her mind. Chuck felt as though he'd been holding his breath as a look of understanding appeared on her face. \"Well, I think that's a pretty good friend right there,\" she finally responded. \" Well, thank you, Tina.\" Chuck breathed a sigh of relief and drew her into him with a smile. \"What?\" she asked him. \"Wilson thanks you.\" Tina pulled from Chuck's embrace, glanced quickly at Chuck, and approached the volleyball on the nightstand, facing it. \"Thank you, Wilson, for watching out for him. And I have no intention of hurting him, now or ever.\" It was silent and she looked over to Chuck who was gazing at her admiringly. \"You are amazing, Tina,\" he told her, taking her into his arms and kissed her tenderly. After a moment she pulled away and asked, \"Well, did Wilson say anything?\" With a warm smile Chuck told her, \"He has no objections.\" Kelly Frears-Lovett was the perfect wife and mother. She was attractive, well-educated, a good friend to those who knew her, and well-respected in her community. She had the perfect home, the perfect husband, the perfect daughter, the perfect life. She was the envy of all her friends. Indeed she had the kind of life many women could only dream about. As her husband, Jerry entered their home with another bouquet of roses for her, she couldn't help but smile. Jerry was in fact, the perfect man. A doting husband and father, a wonderful provider with his thriving dental practice, he was sensitive to Kelly's every need. He approached her with a smile at their solid oak dining room table as she sat doing the bills. Charming and suave, he handed her the roses. She responded to him with a kiss. He was everything a woman could want in a man. Devastatingly handsome dressed in his suit and tie he was also sweet, thoughtful, and sexy; these were the things that attracted her to him. \"Hey, you're home,\" she told him looking at the clock. It was lunchtime. Jerry retrieved a vase from the kitchen, put the flowers in the large glass container, and filled it with water. \"Just thought I'd pop in and see my favorite gals,\" he told her with a smile and set the vase of roses on the table in front of her as she gazed at them appreciatively. \"Katie's taking a nap.\" He raised his eyebrows and grinned devilishly. \"Well, I guess I have you all to myself then,\" he said coming up behind her, brushing her blond hair away, and kissing her on the neck. Kelly Frears-Lovett was a woman in love. Sadly, it was not with her husband. It would've been easy for her to be happy with Jerry. She had every reason to be. And she might've lived happily ever after. If only- If only Chuck hadn't come back. Saying goodbye to him was the hardest thing she'd ever done and not a day passed that she didn't regret it. When she bumped into Stan the past week over at the video store, she'd been shocked to receive the latest news about the former love of her life. Despite Chuck's request Stan had told her about Chuck's accident, that their truck had been totaled, that he'd survived. He also assured her repeatedly that Chuck was okay, that he was recovering, that a friend was caring for him, that he was happy. How could that be , Kelly wondered. How could he be so happy, when I'm so miserable? Kelly pulled away from her husband separating his lips from her neck and took his hands in hers. \"Jerry,\" she said to her husband nervously, her amber eyes pleading. \"We need to talk.\" \"...Drifting out in the open seas for days, Noland all but gave up hope of rescue until a Russian naval ship spotted him in his makeshift raft that he'd fashioned from tree trunks, rope, and video tape, using a door from a port-a-potty as a sail. \"I was determined,\" Noland stated, \"that I was either going to get off that island, or die trying.\" Upon his miraculous return to Memphis, Noland was received by friends and his Federal Express family with a heroes welcome. \"It was great seeing everyone again, but things had changed. I was a different person. I couldn't go back to my former way of life.\" Noland added. Still a dedicated Fed-Ex employee at heart, Noland took it upon himself to return the fateful package to its recipient hundreds of miles from Memphis and delivered it to the small town of Shamrock, Texas. When asked what was so special about the package, Noland answered, \"It was the wings,\" he stated simply. With a tight grip on the package, he proudly points to the winged symbol with his finger. \"This package saved my life,\" he added. The recipient of the exceptional package turned out to be Texas' native Bettina Peterson, former wife of Dick Peterson, of Peterson Dairy Farms, a popular chain throughout Texas. Ms. Peterson was unavailable for comment. Noland's adventure didn't end there. A deadly head-on collision while trying to leave the small town left Noland incapacitated with a mild concussion, a broken arm, and a broken leg. These unfortunate circumstances led him to Peterson's care and have kept him in Shamrock where he currently resides. Yet he does not dwell on the many hardships he endured. Noland possesses a strong spirit, and with odds stacked against him, it truly takes an extraordinary individual to have survived his many near-death experiences. With a broad smile he celebrates his triumphs and his second and third chances at life. \"Not everyone gets so many opportunities to start over. Everyday is a new day.\" When asked what his next move would be, Noland responded with an inspiring grin that his future was uncertain but stated, \"You never know what the tide will bring in,\"\" Tina finished, set the newspaper down, and smiled at Chuck sitting across from her. \"Wow, Chuck, what an amazing article,\" she told him as he sipped his coffee and threw her arms around him. \"Truly inspiring,\" she said affectedly and kissed him. \"I've gotta hand it to that Gloria from the Pampa News.\" \"What a great picture too! Such a handsome fellow and who'd ever thought that my package would've been so inspirational?\" Her eyes beheld the likeness of Chuck holding the package in his hands and she traced the image of the wings in the picture lovingly with her finger. \"Yeah, it's a good thing you saved it.\" She nudged him. \"Did you know that this newspaper will probably make it out all the way to Austin? People all over the great state of Texas will be reading it!\" she remarked and laid her head on his shoulder skimming the article again. \"So are you hungry?\" Tina looked down. \"Yes, I am, but Chuck, I could make something here and then we could go to your appointment.\" Her gaze met his just in time to notice the suspicious look he was giving her. Quickly she changed the subject. \"Today's the day, Chuck. You're finally gonna get that cast removed. You must be excited!\" \"Tina, you can't stay holed up in this house forever. Remember how great it was to get out with Stan and Eileen?\" he watched her as she nodded reluctantly and took her hands in his. \"I'm right here with you. I'm not going to let anybody say anything to you.\" Tina shot him an amused glance. \"That's very sweet of you but what are you going to do, knock them over the head with your crutches?\" \"Very funny. I insist, Tina. Everything will be fine.\" Tina and Chuck sat at the table at Marie's Diner in town browsing the menu. Chuck wore a bright smile as he contemplated the lunch specials. Tina's eyes darted back and forth around the room and back to her menu as she tapped her foot nervously on the floor. \"Will you relax?\" he asked her. \"People are looking over here,\" she whispered leaning in close to the table. \"Ignore them, Tina. Just like you always do.\" \"I don't invite trouble by hanging out in diners, Chuck!\" she hissed exasperatedly. \"You aren't inviting trouble, Tina,\" he retorted. \"We're just two people sitting here getting ready to order some lunch.\" Chuck eyed his menu again. \"The French Dip sounds delicious. What do you want?\" \"I want to leave.\" \"I'm right here, Tina. Stop worrying.\" Tina nodded and looked back down at her menu noticing the decorative drawings of Texas' state bird on the front cover. Her artist's eye caught the detail of the wings on the mockingbird. \"Say, Chuck?\" he looked up at her. \"What was it about the wings on my Fed-Ex package that kept you from opening it?\" Chuck opened his mouth to answer when he caught sight of an older couple approaching them. With a smile he told her, \"Let me handle this.\" Tina looked up with dread as she recognized Betsy, the general store owner, and her husband, Sam. Tina closed her eyes and sighed and opened them up again only to find Betsy in front of them eyeing her and Chuck suspiciously. \"Well, Bettina Peterson!\" she crowed. \"I just don't believe it!\" \"Hello!\" Chuck interjected. \"How are you folks today?\" Betsy's large eyes met Chuck's with a smile and went right back to Tina. \"All this time, Bettina, and really you're keeping this man all to yourself,\" she drawled. Tina's fearful expression turned to confusion. \"Well, young lady,\" Sam piped up, \"aren't you going to introduce us?\" Stammering, Tina finally got out her reply. \"Uh…yes…this..is..\" Before she could finish, Sam cut in, \"Chuck Noland. Read all about you in the paper, son. I'd like to shake your hand,\" the old man told him extending his hand to him as Chuck responded with a friendly but surprised smile. \"It's a pleasure having such a fine individual here in our small town,\" Betsy chirped. Tina was at a loss for words as she gaped from Betsy back to Chuck. \"Well thanks, that's very kind of…\" \"It's not everyday you meet a man who's beat death three times!\" \"Really, it's inspiring,\" Betsy added, \"and we're very happy to welcome you to our small Shamrock family.\" The older woman leaned in towards Chuck and whispered, \"Bettina has a good heart. She's single, you know?\" A slight gasp escaped Tina's lips as her already surprised expression turned to shock. \"I'm Betsy and this is my husband, Sam, and we own the general store. Come see us anytime!\" she told Chuck with wide eyes as her husband nodded enthusiastically. Chuck met Tina's disoriented gaze then smiled back at the couple. \"Thank you, Betsy and Sam. I'd really like that.\" Before they reached Chuck's doctor's appointment it had been confirmed that just as Tina had suspected Chuck had become a local celebrity. Several people had approached Chuck and Tina in awe just to shake his hand. The good news was that Tina no longer had to worry anymore about their judgmental opinions. It seemed the Fed-Ex package was something of a conversation starter and they were delighted that with all Chuck had been through that he'd ended up there in Shamrock...with one of their own helping him. The bad news was that it would still be one more week until Chuck's cast could be removed. A/N : A great thanks to Nate and to Cat Turner for your kind reviews! I love that you are hanging in there with me. I have this story almost 99 percent written so far with still much editing to do and hope that if all goes well to post the last chapter the week before Christmas. Prior to the conclusion I hope to have many questions answered. So we still have a few chapters to go yet! I would love to hear from you! Please review![Chapter 13] A/N: Thanks to Nate, as always, I remain ever grateful for your comments! As usual, any reviews, feedback, constructive criticisms are appreciated. Thanks for reading :) Chapter 13 A loud knocking at the door interrupted Chuck as he sat busily on the sofa folding towels. With furrowed brows, he wondered who it could be. In the two months he'd been with Tina she'd never had visitors. The knocking continued. \"Just a minute,\" Chuck yelled, grabbing hold of the crutches and hobbled over to the front door and opened it. A man roughly about Chuck's age stood before him. He was tall with short, wavy reddish-brown hair, a muscular build, and a friendly smile. \"Hello,\" Chuck greeted with a puzzled expression. \"Howdy! You must be Chuck Noland.\" \"That's right.\" \"I'm looking for Bettina. Is she here? I saw her truck out front.\" Chuck felt his heart skip a beat. He couldn't help but wonder if it was the bastard who stood before him. \"She's upstairs and you are?\" The man pulled open the screen door and held out his hand to Chuck. \"Sorry. That was stupid of me. I'm Ricky, Bettina's older brother.\" Chuck breathed a small sigh of relief and shook the man's hand enthusiastically. \"Of course. Come on in. Tina told me all about you.\" Ricky's face took on a serious look. \"Oh. Hope she threw in some good stuff.\" \"She did. Come sit down.\" He gestured to the easy chair and Ricky plopped into it. \"I haven't seen my baby sister in months and when I read the article in the paper I just had to come meet you in person. You see, I live in Austin.\" \"Tina mentioned-\" Ricky interrupted, \"Our Ma even found the article online and e-mailed it to me.\" Tina descended the stairs quickly and gaped surprisedly at her older brother. \"Ricky Ricardo! Oh my God. How are you?\" she squeaked and ran to embrace him. He squeezed her tightly and lifted her off the floor. \"Bettina Louise! I'm great, Sis. How are you?\" \"I'm doing just-\" \"I was just telling Chuck here about the newspaper article and I just had to come see for myself.\" Tina met her brother's green eyes and looked casually at Chuck. \"I'm so surprised to see you. Are you staying?\" Ricky nodded. \"Just for tonight. I have to head back tomorrow. I've been meaning to get out here for a visit and see…\" he paused and looked at Chuck, \"what you're up to.\" \"Ricky?\" she cocked her head to the side. \"Did Mama put you up to this?\" Avoiding her eyes, he told her, \"Well, Mama wanted to be here but she's in Florida right now, as you know.\" Tina pursed her lips. \"Right.\" She gestured for him to sit but he stood facing her. \"I'm fine, Ricky. I can take care of myself.\" \"And Chuck, I see.\" With a smile, she looped her arm through his leading him to the kitchen. \"I am taking care of him as any good friend would do. So lay off, please,\" Tina told him very sweetly as she circled him back around into the living room and gave Chuck a look of warning. \"I'm about to start dinner. How about you two get acquainted?\" \"Okay, let's start with little known facts about Bettina.\" It was Mexican food night. The trio sat around the dinner table filling their taco shells with ground beef, cheese, lettuce and tomato, and beans and rice. \"Alright,\" Chuck agreed with a smile. \"Let's start with that,\" he repeated noticing Tina's horrified expression. She shook her head. \"Aw Ricky, c'mon.\" \"My baby sister was runner-up for Miss Teen Texas,\" he told Chuck proudly. Chuck was enjoying this. He felt as though he were learning about a whole new side to her. \"Wow, Tina, I'm impressed.\" With a frown, she said, \"Oh please, Ricky, I don't want to be remembered for that. I would rather be known as a successful independent businesswoman who doesn't need the help of a man to survive. Ignoring her, he continued, \"She has quite the singing voice too. Have you heard it?\" Chuck shook his head as Ricky continued. \"Bettina has quite the stubborn streak in her. She's very damned competitive.\" \"Ricky!\" Chuck spoke up uneasily. \"I could see that.\" \"Chuck!\" He looked at her hurt, distressed face, and told her defensively, \"It's just that you win every game we play. Scrabble, Chess…\" \"Checkers, Sorry, the list goes on….\" Ricky continued. \"And on.\" Chuck added. \"Let's not forget how you took first place in the surfing competition when you were 16.\" Chuck gaped at the embarrassed redhead who was now looking down and shaking her head. \"Tina was very athletic. She lettered in Volleyball, Soccer, Track.\" \"Can we please talk about something else?\" she begged her brother; her face flushed. Ricky's green eyes turned to Chuck. \"So how long since the accident?\" \"It's been almost nine weeks. I should be getting this cast off soon,\" he answered and took a last bite of his taco. \"You've suffered some serious misfortune, Chuck. So what are your plans now…I mean do you have a job lined up or do you plan on continuing to leech off my sister?\" \"gasp!\" The question caught Chuck by surprise and bits of the taco went down the wrong way causing him to cough uncontrollably. \"Ricky!\" Tina reprimanded as she walked up behind Chuck and firmly patted his back. \"He is not leeching off of me.\" Ricky looked reproachfully at Chuck and back at Tina. Still patting his back she hissed at her brother, \"If you must know, Ricky, we have a business arrangement.\" \"Right,\" he responded doubtfully. Chuck signaled to Tina that he was okay and took a drink of milk. \"Seriously,\" he cleared his throat. \"I've been paying rent and other expenses because she's been taking care of me.\" Tina nodded in agreement and sat back down in her seat. \"He received a large severance check from Federal Express not too long ago as well as money from a settlement.\" With a suspicious look he eyed Chuck and Tina. \"But, I would've done it for free, Ricky, and I told him as much. Chuck wouldn't hear of it.\" With an apologetic look he told Chuck, \"So what's next for you once you're back on your feet?\" Tina cut in, \"Well he's not going to be one hundred percent, Ricky. After the cast is removed he'll probably have to go through physical therapy and use a cane. It could take months.\" \"Okay, okay, Tina.\" He turned to Chuck. \"But you've got to have a plan.\" Chuck considered Tina's overprotective brother realizing that he meant well. \"For the first time in my life, Ricky, I don't have a plan and I don't intend to rack my brain trying to figure it out.\" Ricky studied Chuck's face. Here was a man who'd survived extraordinary circumstances. Since Ricky had arrived in Shamrock he'd noticed the change in the people's attitudes towards his sister. He would always be grateful to Chuck for that. \"It's a miracle that you are still alive.\" \"Don't I know it,\" Chuck agreed noticing Ricky's relaxed tone. He raised a finger. \"You know, our own little Bettina had her own brush with death.\" Chuck's eyebrows raised and looked at Tina curiously. She shook her head. \"Oh please, Ricky. Spare us.\" \"When she was about what…nine…ten years old she wanted to surf some pretty high waves.\" Ricky looked at his sister who was rolling her eyes. \"She was trying to catch up to me and went out too far. She ended up getting swallowed up by the waves and bonked on the head with her boogie board.\" \"Wow…that sounds -\" Ricky cut in. \"It knocked her unconscious. If not for this teenage boy pulling her from the water she surely would've drowned.\" Chuck stared at Ricky, dumbfounded. \"Oh my God-\" \"We don't even know who the boy was. Never even had the chance to thank him for saving my little sis from the clutches of Hell.\" \"Ricky!\" Chuck was speechless. He couldn't imagine the thought of Tina dying. \"Oh that reminds me of the time that Tina snuck into the movie theater and…\" \"Ricky, he really doesn't want to hear this.\" \" Yes he does, yes he does !\" \"She and her boyfriend were making out and-\" \" Okay, maybe he doesn't .\" \"Goddammit, Ricky!\" she screamed. Ricky glanced up at his sister, unfazed by her outburst. \"Oh yeah, and of course she has quite the pottymouth.\" \" No shit .\" \"Ricky!\" \"Well, yes, I've noticed that.\" \"Chuck!\" Furiously she picked up the empty plates and took them into the kitchen, dropping them into the sink and muttered profanities to herself as the two men laughed. Ricky's expression quickly turned serious and he leaned towards Chuck. \"Seriously, Chuck, another little known fact is that my sister is a black belt in Karate. She broke a guy's nose once.\" He paused for effect. \"She can kill you if she chooses.\" With furrowed eyebrows Chuck's eyes met Ricky's. \"Don't get me wrong. Tina wouldn't hurt a soul unless she was threatened. However, I have a shotgun and I will use it if you hurt my sister. Remember that.\" \" Well, Ricky's a scary son of a- !\" \"Ricky, I have no intention of-\" \"Let's just keep it that way, Chuck, and we'll get along just fine,\" he finished casually. Returning to the table still muttering curses Tina became silent and observed the curious exchange the two men were having. \"So is that it? Have ya'all had enough of making fun of me? Are we done now?\" Ricky's eyes never left Chuck's. \"I'd say we're done, wouldn't you.\" Chuck nodded. \"We are most certainly done.\" Ricky gathered his things the next morning as he got ready to leave. \"Are you sure you're going to be alright?\" \"I'm sure,\" she told him with a smile. \"Well I should hope so, I gave him the talk.\" Tina's face fell. \"Oh good Lord, Ricky, not the talk. We're just good friends,\" she told him not wanting to admit their true relationship yet. \"Call it what you want, Tina. I saw the way he was looking at you,\" he told her noticing the surprised look on her face, \"and the way you were looking at him.\" He opened the front door and faced his sister. \"Chuck's a great guy…but you're my sister and I can't stand to see you get hurt again.\" Ricky embraced her with strong brotherly arms and walked out the door. She followed him out onto her front porch and pet April as she watched her only sibling drive away. \"Pleasant fellow.\" Tina was startled by Chuck's voice and turned to see him standing at the screen door. She opened up the door and kissed him good morning. \"Hope we didn't wake you.\" They turned and headed towards the kitchen. \"I was getting up.\" Chuck's eyes fixed on the kitchen table. \"I understand why you didn't tell him about us.\" He laughed. \"Imagine if you had.\" Tina embraced him tightly. \"Aw Chuck, you'll have to forgive Ricky. He's been through a lot too. Dick was his best friend.\" Chuck nodded understandingly. \"So I guess you can't blame him. It's just going to take some time.\" Tina moved away from him to reach for two cups from the cupboard. \"Tina?\" She turned her eyes back to Chuck, noticing his curious expression. \"Are you really a black belt?\" One week later The past week had been hell. Kelly's grip tightened on the steering wheel and she shook her head as she drove on auto-pilot, reliving the past week's arguments with her husband, Jerry. She was a married woman. So what was she doing driving to Texas? This wasn't how it was supposed to be , she'd thought over and over again. Chuck and I were supposed to get married. He said he would be right back. Kelly sighed as those words absently escaped her lips once again. How many times had she repeated them to her family, to her friends, to her therapist? It had taken years for her to accept Chuck's death, although everything inside her screamed that he was still alive. Year after year had passed and her heart had been broken. If only I'd waited, she lamented. \"Who are you waiting for, Kelly?\" the therapist had asked her. \"Chuck's dead and he's not coming back. You have to let him go. It's time to move on.\" Kelly had moved on alright, under much urging from her mom, therapist, and Jerry. She had been honest with him right from the beginning. She hadn't gotten over Chuck and maybe she never would. Jerry truly loved her and accepted that. And that's probably why he convinced her at the hub not to meet with Chuck. \"It was too soon,\" he'd told her. \"Give yourself some time.\" The night he'd shown up at her house Chuck hadn't required any explanation from her. He had deserved an explanation; he had deserved something... Just the thought of it had brought her to tears. Chuck was a prince among men. And she'd almost left with him. For a brief moment, she'd put aside her responsibilities so that her heart could reunite with his. But she couldn't do it. Upstairs watching from the window, Jerry knew that Kelly was his, because the love of her life had come back and she couldn't leave her family. Chuck had almost been killed…again. This time in a car crash, and nobody had told her. She'd almost lost Chuck…again. Not this time , she thought. Kelly reached under her seat and grasped Chuck's favorite Elvis cd that she'd secretly held onto and popped it into the cd player. Take my hand, take my whole life too, 'cause I can't help falling in love with you. She wiped more tears from her eyes as the tune brought her to another time; a happier time when she and Chuck had their whole lives ahead of them. Brushing blond strands of hair from her eyes she sat straight up in her seat, took a breath, and patted a brown leather-bound journal on the seat next to her. The journal; it had been one of the last gifts she'd received from Chuck that Christmas before he left. It was something she always treasured. Following the suggestion from her therapist, Kelly diligently recorded her feelings. It's gold lined pages contained entry after entry of love, loss, depression, and grief. Kelly wanted, no, needed Chuck to forgive her. She hoped that the journal would help him to understand what she'd gone through while he was stranded. Kelly desperately wanted Chuck to take her back. Two hours ago, she'd left her daughter, Katie in her mother's care. Katie was the biggest reason that kept her from leaving with him. Katie was her whole world- one and a half years of love and unbridled joy - she couldn't abandon her. While Kelly's mother hadn't exactly approved of what Kelly was up to, she understood. Her husband took it better than expected. Jerry half-expected this may happen and told her that he might not be there if she returned. And that was the chance she was willing to take.[Chapter 14] Chapter 14 \"That was a good movie, Chuck. I really enjoyed it. I'm so glad we did this,\" Tina told him as they walked up to the front door. \"Yeah…not too bad for our first date,\" Chuck told her, standing beside her holding onto his crutches as she nodded and unlocked the door. \"Next time, though, you might actually let me watch the movie,\" he chuckled jokingly. She nudged him. \"I didn't hear any complaints from you in the movie theater.\" She held the door open for him as hobbled through. \"Hell, you're lucky we were in a public place otherwise I might have taken advantage of you,\" she added playfully. Chuck stood in front of her and kissed her for what seemed like the hundredth time that day and still he felt like he couldn't get enough of her. Her arms went around him automatically and he deftly manuevered her back up against the wall. \"You can take advantage of me now.\" His lips lined her neck with soft kisses. \"My room's just a few feet away,\" he told her huskily. Tina pulled away from him and her face became serious. \"I'm really tired, Chuck. I'm going to sleep now. I had a wonderful time.\" Chuck's face fell into a frown. Disappointed as he felt, he would never force her to do anything she didn't want to do. \"Why don't you sleep with me in my bed, Tina?\" he suggested innocently. \"Sleep, Chuck?\" \"What, you don't trust me? I'll be a perfect gentleman,\" he told her lacing his fingers into hers. She looked down. \"I know you will, Chuck. It's infuriating.\" Her eyes met his puzzled expression and she laughed. \"It's myself I don't trust. Sleeping in the same bed…it's too tempting,\" she told him shaking her head. With a sigh, she added, \"I hope you don't find this too hard to understand. My heart's just not ready yet. I've been thinking a lot clearer; clearer than I ever have. I can't separate the two. Other people can, but I can't.\" It was impossible for her to miss the hurt look on his face. She leaned into him and kissed him softly on the lips. \"Someday I'll be ready,\" she promised. He had an irresistible urge to tell her how much he loved her, but at that moment he doubted that she would believe him. Chuck didn't know if she would ever be fully capable of trusting any man ever again. \"Of course I understand, Tina.\" Leaning into him again she embraced him tightly and whispered, \"Thank you.\" Tina counted herself a very lucky woman as she backed away from him and resisted the urge to throw her arms around him; feeling that magnetic pull from his lips once again. Instead gently she told him, \"Good night, Chuck, and thanks for making me feel like a teenager again.\" Chuck smiled at the redhead. He was happy; happier than he'd been in a long time and he wouldn't dream of pushing her away from him by not respecting her wishes. This woman, he knew, would definitely be worth waiting for. \"My pleasure, I am here for you anytime you are feeling hormonal.\" With a fond smile, she turned and headed upstairs. Patience is a virtue, and Chuck had tons of it. He didn't know when she would be ready, but he would be there when she was. \"Give me three more.\" Chuck looked up at her like she was crazy. \"Oh come on, Tina, my arm is killing me.\" \"Just three more reps, Chuck,\" she encouraged softly. \"Soon we'll be able to move you up to twenty-five pounds in your right arm.\" Silently he cursed the dumbbell in his hand and scrunched his face as he did one more and stopped. \" She's a real ball breaker.\" Tina knelt down to where he was sitting and stretched her neck. \"Come on, Chuck,\" she coaxed sweetly. \"I'll tell you what. I'll give you one kiss for every rep that you do.\" Decidedly that was just the motivation he needed so he continued. It was almost enough for Chuck just to see Tina dressed in a sports bra and spandex shorts as they did their workout. \"Two,\" he grunted curling the dumbbell almost reaching his shoulder. Promptly he was rewarded with Tina's lips, but too soon he noticed she pulled away. \"One more, big boy.\" Feeling like his arm was going to fall off, it shakily curled up once again, squeezing the dumbbell tightly in his grip and slowly lowered the weight to the floor as Tina smiled with delight. \"Three,\" he grunted. Clapping, she hopped enthusiastically onto his lap, threw her arms around his neck, and this time granted him a very provocative kiss. Pulling away, Tina gazed adoringly into his eyes tracing his jaw with her finger. \"I'm so proud of you.\" Chuck smiled at her and stretched his arm. \"I'm a little concerned about the workout you're planning for my leg.\" \"Oh no,\" she replied, shaking her head. \"Your leg is going to require the assistance of a professional. We'll get the name of a physical therapist this afternoon after the doc removes your cast.\" \"This afternoon, you mean if they remove it.\" \"I have a good feeling about it,\" she told him with a wink. \"Today is the day.\" She stood up and reached for his crutches and handed them to him. \"Which reminds me, I have a surprise for you.\" Chuck's eyes widened. \"You do?\" He gave her a puzzled look. Already Tina had done more than he could ever hope for. He couldn't fathom how she could possibly feel compelled to do anything more. Tina's face lit up. \"Yes, I do. Stay… right… here,\" she told him kissing him on his cheek, punctuating the words with her kisses. The crutches fell as Chuck let go and embraced his adorable redhead now holding her tightly and kissing her; his arms caressing her back. His kiss took Tina's breath away and she nearly forgot his surprise. With a giggle she told him, \"Chuck, you don't even know what it is.\" His face became serious as he gazed into her eyes. \"Tina, you're the only surprise I'll ever need.\" Her green eyes sparkled as she smiled and she backed away from him. \"Stay right there.\" A moment later she returned with a big smile. Chuck's eyes lit up with delight as he stared at the surprise in Tina's hands. It was a wooden cane. With a derby handle it was a classic looking walking stick made from beechwood and stained a light brown color. Chuck sat down in the chair and admired the smooth glossy finish with his fingers. As his fingers made their way up the cane just below the handle he caught sight of a carving. His breath caught as his eyes treasured the delicate carving of wings. Speechless, he looked up at her; his heart felt as though it was overflowing. \"I had it done in town,\" she told him. \"I was afraid it wouldn't be ready in time.\" \"It's so…\" he trailed off, at a loss for words, \"the wings…they're beautiful…the cane is exquisite…thank you, Tina.\" \"Your welcome, Chuck, I'm so happy that you like it. Now let's get you ready for your appointment.\" With his new cane, Chuck proudly walked for the first time in months through Tina's front door. \"I think I'm getting the hang of this,\" he told her grasping the cane handle with his left hand and setting it forward, and pushing off the cane, swinging his right foot forward, finishing with his left leg. Tina beamed. \"You're doing wonderfully, Chuck. Although I have to admit, I'm going to have to get used to you not having a cast or crutches anymore.\" She used to worry so much that once he was free from his cast that he would be ready to leave her. Now she felt safe and secure that they were together, in a relationship. The way that he treated her confirmed that. \"You have no idea how happy I am to be rid of that cast. And those crutches…banging into walls and furniture everywhere I go…I can take showers again.\" Rubbing her neck, she smiled at him, \"Don't tell me you're going to abandon your bubble baths?\" Chuck retreated to the easy chair setting the cane down carefully and smiled. \"Hey, nobody else knows about my bubble baths. I'd prefer to keep it that way.\" She sat on his lap and laid her head on his shoulder. \"It's our little secret; just mine, and yours, and Wilson's.\" Tina sat up with furrowed brows and stretched out her neck making moaning sounds. \"What's the matter with you?\" \"I think I slept wrong. My neck's been bothering me since I woke up.\" \"See, I told you. You should've slept with me.\" Facing him, she narrowed her eyes at him. \"We talked about this.\" Chuck laughed. \"I know, I know. Now face forward and let Chuck work his magic fingers on your neck.\" Obediently she complied. \"Ooh, I just love it when you refer to yourself in the third person.\" The touch from his fingers sent shocks throughout her body and she began to wonder if this was such a good idea after all. But when his fingers made their way up to her neck rubbing and kneading she didn't dare stop him. She moaned with delight as his fingers caressed and rubbed up and down her neck. \"Oh, Chuck, this feels won..derful,\" she moaned. \"You are sooo good at this.\" \"Well I never tire of hearing that,\" he told her jokingly. Her tank top revealed milky white shoulders and his fingers couldn't resist touching them. Massaging and kneading, Chuck thoroughly enjoyed the sounds of pleasure coming from her mouth. Slowly his hands made their way down her back and he waited for her objection. But it never came. All she could do was focus on the pleasurable sensations of his hands gently but firmly massaging the muscles in her back. Tina bit her lip and wondered how much more she could take as his fingers continued on her back then changed to a rubbing circular motion. She lifted up her tank top slightly so that his fingers met her bare skin. She gasped as his gentle touch drew goose bumps from her sensitive skin. The rubbing then turned to scratching and she closed her eyes and lost herself in the wonderful sensation, adjusting her back to his fingers. Then he stopped. Curiously she turned around to find out why his needful touch had abandoned her. He was holding back. He looked like a cat ready to pounce on a canary, yet out of respect for her he did nothing. Without any words their lips met passionately as she pulled him closer. His blue eyes were intense as he broke away from her. \"How would you like to continue this in my room?\" Green eyes full of desire met his own. Her heart was pounding. There was no stopping now; she was ready. \"I'd love to. Unless Wilson has any objections.\" It was quiet for a moment then Chuck grinned at her; his eyebrow raised mischievously. \"Wilson has no objections.\" The two stood up and Chuck grabbed his cane and hurried after Tina into his room. The room was a mess. The bed was unmade, there were clothes on the floor, and the new face they'd drawn on Wilson stared menacingly at them. But they didn't care. Monkeys could've been flying overhead and they wouldn't have noticed. Tangled in each other's arms Chuck's lips met her neck and covered it with soft baby kisses. She was about to yank off her tank top when they heard the doorbell ring. \"Go away!\" Chuck shouted continuing the journey of her neck with his lips. Tina stopped and leaned up onto the bed on her elbows. With a concerned voice she said, \"No, Chuck. Nobody ever comes here.\" \"Yeah, except your brother.\" \"Not very likely to happen again,\" she retorted as he hung his head. \"It could be important.\" The doorbell rang again. Tina got up quickly from the bed, smoothed her hair down, fixed her clothing, and gave Chuck a quick peck on the lips. \"Don't go anywhere, Cowboy. I'll be back shortly and once I get rid of our little unwelcome visitor, I am going to rock your world,\" she told him with one eyebrow raised and blew him a kiss as she left the room. A broad grin overtook Chuck's face as he settled back in the bed comfortably and waited for his gorgeous redhead to return. Out of the corner of his eye he caught Hobbes's grey eyes staring at him. The feline sat by the bed amidst a pile of clothing looking up at him as if ready to join him. Chuck's eyes fixed on the orange tabby with a warning. \"Don't…even… think about it.\" He heard Tina speaking and inviting someone in. Deflated, he looked down and cursed whoever was interrupting them. Tina appeared in the doorway. Her face was white as a ghost. She looked shaken as she stepped into the room and gently shut the door behind her. Chuck sat up, concerned. \"What? Who's out there, Tina? Is it the bastard?\" A look of sadness overcame her as she shook her head. \"No, Chuck. It's… not the bastard.\" She fought back tears and told him softly, \"It's Kelly.\" A/N: Thanks to Nate for your comments. I always look forward to them! Sorry about the cliffie, but I hope you all enjoy a wonderful Thanksgiving. Gobble gobble![Chapter 15] A/N: Thanks to Nate for your feedback. I soooo appreciate it. Please hang in there with me. Hope you all enjoy this chapter. Please read and review...or else! (LOL) Chapter 15 It had been a day like any other. She had gotten up in the morning; showered and dressed, fed her orange tabby, Hobbes and St. Bernard, April, fixed her breakfast, and went to her garage to do some work. Tina remembered that day like it was yesterday. Little had she known that was the day she would meet the man who would change her life. And change her life he had. Unwittingly Chuck had repaired her reputation. He had taught her how to trust again… And how to love. And now he was gone. Chuck was more than she could ever ask for. He was attractive, kind, sweet, and gentle. And the bluish color of his eyes; they seemed to haunt her even now. In his eyes, she had seen sadness, despair, loneliness- almost a mirror image of her own. Then in the time he was with her it changed to fun, and joy, and happiness. She even thought she saw love in those eyes. Yet as he drove away with Kelly she didn't dare look, because her heart was broken, and one thing she couldn't bear to see in his beautiful ocean-colored eyes was pity. Tina wondered bitterly what it was about herself that seemed to push away the men in her life. Then she wondered if it had been her at all. \"I have to go,\" he'd told her. \"Kelly and I need to go somewhere and talk.\" I have to go. Two of the most traumatic goodbyes of her life had begun with those four words. And now Chuck had said them to her without even so much as a second glance back in her direction. She'd felt her heart sink as he'd walked out with Kelly. Once again those four words that stayed permanently etched in her brain had come back to haunt her; to serve as a painful reminder that she should never trust again. It had been hours since they left and Tina still sat crying on her bed; her green eyes now clouded red; tissues scattered everywhere. April and Hobbes lay there with her quietly, as if to console her with their presence. She and Chuck had been happy. They could've actually had a future. Why couldn't Kelly let them be? She already had a husband who loved her; and a child, Chuck had informed her. Kelly had everything Tina ever wanted. Why did she have to come back for Chuck? Shaking her head, she wiped her tears with a clean tissue. These questions threatened to drive her insane. Another question, even worse, plagued her. Why did Chuck have to go? Are you in love with her, Chuck? It was the question Kelly dared not ask. Seated in his vehicle for hours talking to him, saying all the things that needed to be said; stumbling over words that should've been spoken months ago, she looked at the man who sat expressionless before her. When Kelly arrived at Tina's house, she certainly did not expect to find a beautiful woman living there. She didn't expect that this was the friend who'd been caring for Chuck. And most of all, she hadn't expected Chuck to look so…good, so healthy, so happy. Kelly didn't know what she expected, really. Maybe she had secretly hoped that he would look more like he did the night he came to visit her in Memphis; pale and thin, and desperately in love. The man who gave her a welcoming hug stood tall, and walked with a cane. He embraced her with strong arms. His eyes held an appealing glow. His once thin frame was filled out to a healthy size. If not for the faded scar on his forehead and his cane she would hardly be able to tell he had been in a deadly car crash just two months prior. The charming smile that she had missed had returned and it warmed her heart, except for one thing. It wasn't for her. Now, as Chuck sat silently listening, Kelly jabbered on foolishly; completely unable to read his thoughts, and slowly, painfully began to realize that she had made a monumentally, huge mistake. \"Oh my God, Chuck, please say something,\" Kelly told him with a hint of exasperation in her voice. \"Tell her that you shouldn't be here, Chuck. Tell her to go home to her husband!\" Chuck cleared his throat and considered his words. \"I was really…surprised to see you, Kelly. Part of me was thrilled that you came here, and another bigger part of me was just confused.\" Her hazel tinted eyes searched his blue ones for any clue that would lead her to where he was headed. \"And?\" \"And you blew your chance two months ago, Missy.\" Looking down, his fingers absently traced the golden edges of her journal. \"Things are different now, Kelly. I am not the same Chuck Noland that you knew four years ago. I've changed. Hell, I don't even have a job right now.\" He looked up at her, sure that this point would faze her. Her eyes met his sympathetically. \"I'm different too.\" \"Yeah, married!\" \"I have no plans for my future; me,\" he pointed to himself for effect. \"I used to have plans for my plans,\" he laughed. \"I was pathetic.\" \"No, you weren't.\" \"Actually yes, you were.\" He looked at her determined face and silently cursed Wilson's remarks. \"I am not the same man you fell in love with, Kelly.\" She had come too far to be brushed away so easily. \"Do you still love me, Chuck?\" \"The truth, Chuck.\" Chuck opened his mouth but no words came out. He found that he didn't have the courage to say the word. Fixing his eyes on his former lover, he realized that she was offering everything that he had wanted; or thought that he wanted. Two months ago, that would've been perfect, but now as he sat there looking at her pleading face he realized something. He ached for Tina. Her gaze turned downward, a defeated smile overtook her lips. \"Okay…the answer to that question is pretty obvious.\" She paused for a moment. \" Do you love her, Chuck?\" she asked him referring to the lovelorn redhead that had given her a murderous glare as she and Chuck walked out together. \"I feel…very strongly for Tina, Kelly. Seeing you here right now, it's perplexing. I thought I knew how I felt about her. I really need to sort out my feelings…alone.\" He glanced at the time. It was half past eleven and he knew that Tina would be furious with him. He instantly regretted the way that he had left. It was abrupt, to say the least. Silently he kicked himself - he never should've left that house, he thought remorsefully. Nevertheless, he didn't think it would be a good idea to try to break in, assuming that she probably locked him out. It would be better, he decided, to call her and wait until morning to go home. They drove to the closest inn, and rented two rooms. Chuck told Kelly in so many words to get a good night's sleep, and in the morning, she would go home to Memphis and he would go back to his home with Tina. Chuck startled awake and looked around. He was in the cave again. Everything was there exactly as he remembered; the tally marks, the sketches of Kelly, the timepiece on the rock. Even the awful musty scent was so strong he wanted to gag. His heart pounded and a lump formed in his throat. This can't be happening . \" It isn't real, Chuck ,\" Wilson's voice told him. \"Wilson!\" he desperately called out searching frantically around the cave. \"Wilson!\" A blinding light commanded his attention. He went out to the entrance to the cave and peered out not being able to focus on the brightness of the light. This was too familiar. Why did it seem like he'd been through this before? Chuck made his way down to the rocks below and continued his search for Wilson. If he could just find Wilson, then maybe everything else would make sense, he thought. \"Wilson!\" he called out desperately, at the top of his lungs. A glowing light from above shined on him, commanding his attention once again. Chuck looked up and gasped at the powerful sight above. The light was actually more of a golden glow. At first he couldn't make out completely its odd shape. The more he looked, the more the glow began to take form. It manifested itself magically into a huge set of wings. Gaping, he found himself in awe of the image in the sky. It was identical to the wings on the package. A peaceful feeling embraced him and he couldn't take his eyes off the incredible aura. \"Chuck, turn around,\" a voice called out to him. That voice, Chuck realized, he still didn't know who it belonged to. He tore his eyes away from the sky and took a deep breath. Don't wake up yet, oh God, please , he thought as he turned around slowly. His eyes scanned the beach and found his campfire along with Wilson sitting on a post. \"Chuck,\" the voice called him again. \"Wilson?\" Chuck asked heading towards the volleyball. There was a giggle. \"No, Chuck, over here.\" Puzzled, he turned around to find Tina sitting in front of the campfire roasting a marshmallow. Dressed in a floral bikini and grass skirt and more radiant than ever, her sparkling green eyes met his. Her long, red hair shimmered from the bright sun and flowed with the breeze. She smiled up at him; her dimples showing sweetly, and gazed happily at his bewildered face. She patted the sand next to her, gesturing for him to join her. \"It's you, Tina. It was always you.\" Chuck startled awake, sitting up in the bed; shocked at his new revelation. He breathed heavily, trying to catch his breath and focused on his surroundings. He rubbed his eyes and noticed the daylight peeking in through the heavy drapes. This wasn't his room. Slowly, reality began to sink in. This was a motel room and Kelly was asleep in another room a few doors down. Heaving a sigh, he realized how much he missed Tina. What was he doing here? He had to talk to her. It had to be now. Chuck knocked on her bedroom door. \"Tina? Are you in there?\" \"Go away, Chuck.\" Her sad voice didn't deter him. \"Listen, Tina, I wanted to tell you that I'm sorry and-\" Tina's voice interrupted. \"Yeah, I'm sorry too, Chuck. I'm sorry that I stopped and gave you directions; that I invited you in…\" He could hear her sniffling on the other side of the door. She was crying because of him, and the thought of it broke his heart. \"Tina? Let me come in, please?\" he begged. \"Go away, Chuck!\" He wasn't ready to give up. He turned the doorknob hoping that she left it unlocked but to no avail. Chuck sighed and leaned against the door. If only he could just hold her in his arms, then maybe she would listen, he thought. \"Just hear me out, alright? It was confusing seeing Kelly again. She was a big part of my life for a long time.\" Her voice was icy cold, and it hurt to hear her speak this way. \"You left with her, Chuck.\" His tone became defensive. \"Yeah, Tina, but I told her I wasn't in love with her anymore. I told her to go back to her husband.\" It was silent. \"Tina?\" She sniffled again. \"So, what do you want, a medal? You still left with her.\" \"Tina, no…listen, I came back.\" \"Well yeah. All of your crap's here. So go on, Chuck. Pack it up and get out of my house,\" she demanded. Her voice sounded closer as though she were right on the other side of the door. \"Go have your happy ending with your precious Kelly. Don't worry about me. I was fine before you showed up here and I'll be fine after you're gone.\" Her words cut him to the bone. He could feel his heart pounding in his chest. He desperately needed to see her. \"I have something important to tell you, Tina, and I'm not leaving.\" Her voice turned calm, her tone withdrawn. \"It really doesn't matter, Chuck. You see even if I let you stay, you would still end up leaving.\" He interrupted her. \"No, that's not true.\" She continued, \"Maybe not tomorrow or a year from now or five years from now, but you would still leave just the same.\" \"Dammit, Tina, will you please listen?\" \"It's better that you leave now,\" she said sobbing, her voice muffled. \"Tina, I swear to you, nothing happened between Kelly and me. We said goodbye, she's on her way back to Memphis.\" \"Where she belongs.\" \"Goodbye, Chuck.\" \"Tina, no…I…\" He could hear her sobbing on the other side of the door. \"Goodbye. Please leave now.\" \"No, it's not goodbye. I don't ever want to say goodbye to you.\" He listened for a sound, any response from her but there was nothing. \"Tina?\" he called out and knocked on the door. \"Tina?\" There was the sound of a door closing inside the room. He figured that she retreated to the bathroom. Chuck listened intently for any noise or sound. There was nothing. A realization hit him like a slap in the face. She was done. She didn't trust him. She may never trust again. Tears of frustration welled in his eyes. It couldn't be over. He refused to believe it. He cared more about Tina than anyone in the world. A whiny sound came from below and he looked down to see April's sad brown eyes looking up at him. The tears fell and he patted the dog's head soothingly not sure whether he was consoling himself or the St. Bernard. \"It's not over,\" he told the dog quietly. With renewed determination he stood straight up and knocked on the door again loudly. \"It's not over, Tina, do you hear me? It's.. not..over!\" he called out. His pleas were met with silence. \"You really blew it this time, Chuck.\" Defeated, he fell against the door, tears falling down his face and sighed. \"I love you,\" he said quietly and sadly made his way down the stairs to his room to gather his things. On the other side of the door, Tina was silent as the salty tears spilled down her cheeks too numerous to count. She leaned her hand up to the door and said silently, \"I love you, too, Chuck. Goodbye.\"[Chapter 16] A/N: We still have a couple of chapters left. I'm actually nervous about posting this one...please let me know what you think. A big thanks to Nate, as always. I don't know what I'd do without your comments! Chapter 16 Dear Tina, My world was turned upside down four years ago when Chuck left. He was the love of my life. We were on the verge of becoming engaged when his plane went down. I never got over him and to be honest, don't know if I ever will- but, that's my problem. I am heading home to my husband now, if he'll still have me and try to return to the normal life I had before Chuck came back into my life. I realize now that I have made a huge mess of things. Please accept this letter as my apology. It was a mistake for me to come here. Chuck is a good man and you deserve to know that nothing happened between us last night. I came a long way to discover that he doesn't love me anymore. Just the same, I will be forever grateful to you that when he had no one else you kindly took him into your home and cared for him. He looks wonderful because of you. He is happy because of you. Please forgive my intrusion on your lives. I wish only the best for you and Chuck. You are the one he loves. Sincerely, Kelly Tina read the letter again, digesting Kelly's words. When she pulled it from her mailbox hours earlier her first impulse had been to rip it to shreds. She was glad that she hadn't. For a brief moment, Tina began to see through Kelly's eyes. Not once had Tina given any thought to her grief. A pang of empathy struck her. Kelly must've suffered a considerable loss. Who would've known that Tina would be able to identify with Kelly at all, she thought. Chuck hadn't meant to leave her. They had simply been a couple who loved each other building a life together. Then in the blink of an eye, it was over. It was nobody's fault. Tina's anger slipped into depression. Wandering aimlessly around the house, she realized she couldn't stay angry at Chuck. Instinctively she knew that he hadn't slept with Kelly. His words the day before had touched her very soul. She heard him say that he loved her. It had been years since she heard those words. But then he still left. Her eyes surveyed the guest room hopefully for the third time. Sadly, it was completely devoid of anything belonging to him. Tina rummaged through the drawers and closet looking for something, anything of his. Pathetically, she hoped he'd left something behind so he would have to return. Tina had told him to leave. I love you . The words she'd vowed never to say again spilled from her mouth. As much as she didn't want to believe it, her heart belonged to him. The very notion of saying those words terrified her; making her vulnerable again. It was with sadness that he spoke that sentiment and in return those three words had flowed from her lips so naturally. He didn't hear her say it. Her heart felt like it was shattering into a thousand pieces as she said goodbye to Chuck. And he left. It's for the best , she told herself. He would've left eventually . The men in her life always did; her father, her husband, and now Chuck. And they never came back. Tina tossed and turned in the bed as she experienced that dream once more. Her nine-year old body had been swallowed up by waves and somersaulted three times as though she were a simple stick floating in the water. When she finally reached the top for air, she could barely breathe. The wind had been knocked out of her. She spit out the salty water and brushed seaweed from the red strands in her hair, sniffling hoping to alleviate the stinging discomfort from the water up her nose. She then found herself in between large waves and was unable to see in any direction. Bettina paddled arms and feet furiously and turned around only to come head on with the pointy edge of the boogie board. And then there was blackness. \"Little girl, are you okay? Are you okay?\" Hands were grasping her shoulders shaking her slightly. She could hear words being spoken. A boy's worried voice called out to her. Bettina opened her eyes slowly; the bright sun illuminated everything with white. Blue eyes met her own solicitously. Slowly her eyes began to focus. She tried to speak. \"What…?\" A choking sensation overcame her and she felt her lungs were heavy with water. Coughing spasms roared violently through her body emitting what felt like gallons of salt water. The boy moved his hands to her back and helped her to sit up, firmly patting her as she coughed until she could breathe again. \"Are you alright?' She nodded and coughed. In a low voice she asked, \"What happened?\" \"You were out pretty far. I think you got hit on your head with your boogie board and it knocked you out,\" the boy told her; blue eyes full of concern. Bettina shook her head trying to clear the water from her ears. Her heart seemed finally to stop pounding. \"But how….\" she tried to ask but the coughing overcame her again. \"I…\" the dark-haired boy began but was interrupted. \"Bettina! Bettina!\" her mother's voice shrieked. \"Oh my Lord! Bettina, are you okay?\" She panted and dropped in front of Bettina separating the boy's grasp from her daughter. The red-headed bikini clad woman embraced her only daughter tightly; hazel eyes filled with fear, panic-stricken at the thought of what could've been. Bettina was still in shock and was relieved that her mother had found her. When she looked up to thank the boy Bettina found that he had already walked away from them. It was as though he faded away in a dream-like manner never to be seen again. Tina startled awake and lay in her bed realizing that she must have dozed off. Kelly's note lay there next to her. The afternoon daylight shone through the blinds. Hobbes lay comfortably asleep atop her head, and April down by her feet. She wondered how long she'd been asleep when her thoughts quickly moved to her dream. This was the first time her dream had concluded, she realized. Her heart felt sadness for the boy who she'd never even had the chance to thank. He had saved her life and to this day, she could not describe what his face looked like. Only that he was a boy around Ricky's age. He had worn dark blue swim trunks that bore a logo of bright, golden wings. And that his eyes were as blue as the ocean. With a gasp, Tina sat up in her bed as the meaning of the epiphanous dream sunk in; the glorious apperception that had not revealed itself until now. \"Oh my God.\" Chuck sat in his truck parked at the inn. He had been there for hours. His blue eyes stared off into space and he sat there lost in his thoughts. Hours passed and he thought of a thousand different things. He thought about how things hadn't worked out with Kelly and how he was glad that it hadn't. He thought about time, all the valuable time he'd wasted in his life; like precious sands from an hourglass slipping through his fingers. He thought about Tina especially; where he'd be without her, and how much he loved her. Chuck thought about fate. Fate was what kept him from leaving Shamrock, after all. Shaking his head, he laughed at how much that sounded like something Tina would say. Except for that now he believed it. When Ricky had told of Tina's near-death experience Chuck was dumbstruck. It couldn't be, could it? He was just a teenager the summer he stayed with his grandparents in Galveston, Texas. In all his fifteen years he had not known fear until he saw the young red-headed girl drifting and sinking in the ocean water. Much like the others, it had been an uneventful day at the beach, challenging himself to get past the high waves. The voice of a girl crying out caught his attention and when he looked in her direction he saw the wave push the boogie board forcefully away causing it to collide with the girl's forehead. Hurriedly, he struggled against the waves to reach the unconscious girl who was already sinking below the water's surface. Without hesitation he wrapped his right arm around her chest so that her face was up and swam her to the shore. He nearly panicked when he noticed she wasn't breathing. She was just a kid, not more than ten years old. He couldn't let her die. Chuck never considered himself a hero. The girl's mother didn't grant him so much as a second glance. At the dinner table, in his own way Ricky had thanked him. Not that he needed any thanks; he was just happy that she was alive. Fate. It was a funny thing; before he met Tina it held no meaning for him. To Chuck, fate defied logic. It wasn't anything that had been proven. It was a word that people used when there were no good explanations for things that happened to them. Now, as Chuck stared at the volleyball beside him on the passenger's seat, he realized that he could no longer deny it. Stranded on an island, fate stepped in and delivered him a package. The package had led him to her. They were meant to be together. He stood in front of her closed bedroom door, set his cane down, and knocked loudly. He had searched everywhere for her. Her truck was there yet she was nowhere to be found. \"Tina!\" Chuck called out. There was no response. Next, he turned the doorknob but found that it was locked. He looked down and sighed. \"Listen, Tina, I know you hate me right now. I know you told me to leave. And I almost did,\" he paused for a moment. \"I wish you would open the door, Tina.\" Putting his ear up to the door he listened but still there was no sound. \"I wish I didn't have to say this through the door but here goes…I love you, Tina and I'm so sorry. I hope that someday you will forgive me. I will never leave you again.\" Not discouraged by the silence he continued, \"We are meant to be together and I love you. Did you hear me, Tina? I said I… love… you!\" Chuck began to feel like he was getting nowhere. He leaned against the door and sighed. \"It was you. You were the voice in my dream. Tina, please? Talk to me,\" he pleaded feeling hopeless and helpless. \" C'mon Chuck, you can do better than that. Get in there! Make her listen!\" For once, Wilson was making a lot of sense, Chuck thought. He stood up straight, cleared his throat, and called out, \"Alright, Tina, one way or the other, I'm coming in! Either open up the door or I'm breaking it down!\" \" Go, Chuck. Go, Chuck!\" \"On the count of three.\" Chuck took a breath. \"One…two…\" \"Chuck, turn around.\" Chuck's body stiffened at the sound of Tina's voice. She had just spoken the words that haunted him for months. It reminded him of his dream. Slowly, he turned around and faced her. Standing there with her arms folded, she was not impressed. She was a mess. Her hair hadn't been combed, her clothes were disheveled, and her eyes were puffy. Tina's face wore a smirk. \"Oh, I thought you were in the room,\" he told her quietly pointing towards the door. She looked down and simply shook her head. \"But the door was… locked.\" Without a word Tina walked past him in front of the door and shoved it open. \"The door needs to be replaced.\" Chuck's eyebrows raised and he laughed to himself. Here she was in front of him and the words that had flowed so easily from his mouth just moments before seemed to abandon him. \"Tina, I …uh.\" She'd been digging around in the pantry when she heard him calling out for her. Her heart leapt that he'd actually returned. Quietly she stayed at the bottom of the stairs just to hear what he had to say then made her way up to witness him shouting at her bedroom door. Her eyes met his; her face serious. Tina still felt the sting of when he left with Kelly. None of that mattered, she reminded herself. Chuck was here now. She resisted the urge to throw herself into his arms. Happy as she was that he returned, her face showed no emotion. There was one question that she needed an answer to. \"Tell me one thing, Chuck,\" she requested calmly. Chuck nodded. \"Anything.\" \"What was it about the wings on the package that kept you from opening it?\" With no clue as to where this line of questioning may lead him, he happily obliged. \"It was the angel wings; my grandma's trademark. She loved everything that had to do with angels and wings. The summer that I stayed with my grandparents in Galveston she created emblems of wings and sewed them onto my clothes. She told me that they would keep me safe everywhere I wore them. While at the time I wasn't crazy about it, they were unique-I'd never seen anything like them before. So I wore them-on most of my clothes she put them where they couldn't be seen, so only I knew they were there. Anyhow, two months after I went home she died from a stroke.\" His voice softened, \"So the wings were very special to me.\" Tina listened to him, her eyes hopeful. He smiled as he recalled the memories he'd not thought of in years. \"There was one pair of swim trunks- they were my favorite. It had the wings on the lower right side. I kept them for years.\" \"They were dark blue.\" It wasn't a lucky guess, he knew, as he saw the flicker of recognition in her eyes. Surprised as he was to hear her say the words, it only served to confirm what he already found to be true. He nodded with one eyebrow raised and took a breath. \"Yes.\" Slowly he moved closer to her with cane in hand. \"On the island, when I saw those wings on the package that were so much like my grandma's design, I knew I had to somehow deliver it to its rightful owner. Tiny tears ran down Tina's face as his words confirmed the amazing connection they shared. Chuck mistook her tears for sadness and painful regret washed over him like a tidal wave. \"Tina, I'm so sorry… I love you and I'll never leave you.\" A forgiving smile crossed her face and she wiped away her tears. Closing the distance between herself and Chuck, she looked deeply into his soulful eyes. \"You saved my life, Chuck,\" she told him softly and melted into his embrace. The cane landed against the wall as he squeezed Tina tightly and vowed to himself never to let go. His fingers brushed her hair tenderly and he whispered gently in her ear, \"You saved mine too.\"[Chapter 17] Chapter 17 The bright sun rose over the town of Shamrock. Luminous, orange, and welcoming; it was a glorious new day. The morning light peeked in through the window and awoke him. That and the loud purring sound of the cat. Chuck squinted his eyes open as he felt the warm heaviness of Hobbes's furry body nestled atop his head. He stretched upsetting Hobbes's cozy position and the feline lazily stretched out unwittingly landing his tail on Chuck's lips. Slightly irritated, Chuck wiped the tail away from his mouth rubbing away the excess fur. On any other day this might have annoyed him but as he caught sight of Tina laying sweetly beside him all he could do was smile. Carefully, he rolled onto his side and gazed upon Tina's angelic sleeping form. Long, red hair spilled onto her pillow and she lay there peacefully as he observed the gentle rhythm of her breathing. Chuck counted himself the luckiest man in the world as he lay next to the woman he loved. His heart beat easily in his chest and contentedly he recalled her words from the night before. In his mind's eye he could see the adoration in her green eyes as she told him for the first time that she loved him and how his soul felt complete. And he could still feel the sweet surrender of her body as she gave herself to him. Admiringly he watched as his beloved redhead slept peacefully and resisted the urge to stroke her face or hair for fear of waking her. Unable to help himself, Chuck cuddled up closer to her and planted a gentle kiss on her cheek, leaving her undisturbed, then settled himself back onto his pillow. He took the opportunity to look around the room. The walls were painted a light beige and decorated with various floral prints as well as picture frames. On one wall was a large wooden rack that held a display of various color belts-karate belts. White, yellow, orange, green, purple, blue, red, brown, and at the bottom, just as Ricky had said, black. Proudly, Chuck thought to himself how it must've taken much discipline to get to that level and respected her even more for her accomplishments. Out of the corner of his eye on the other side of Tina he saw a folded piece of paper. He caught the words \"Dear Tina\" and inwardly gasped as he recognized the penmanship. It was Kelly's handwriting and Chuck found himself intrigued by it. As quietly as possible, Chuck reached over the sleeping redhead and grasped the letter. It was none of his business, he knew, but somehow he couldn't control his hand from reaching it nor his eyes from reading it. Rolling over onto his other side his eyes devoured Kelly's words quickly and he breathed a quick sigh of relief. \" Well, she wasn't so bad after all eh, Chuck?\" Chuck could still recall Kelly's dispirited face as he told her goodbye that night. Her amber eyes held a sadness that Chuck had known all too well. \"Go back to your husband and daughter. They love you,\" he had told her and the stream of tears sliding down her face had pained him, but Chuck knew it was for the best. He wiped her tears away with his fingers. \"You love him, too, Kelly. You just haven't given yourself the chance.\" With that he'd given her a smile and a gentle kiss on the cheek then left for his room. \" You did the right thing.\" Chuck folded up the letter and mentally agreed with Wilson. \"I can't believe you're really here.\" Chuck startled at the sound of her sweet voice and set Kelly's note on the nightstand. He watched as she rubbed her eyes and yawned, marvelling at her natural beauty, and then asked her lightly,\"No regrets, I hope.\" Tina threw herself into his embrace and kissed him. \"No regrets…now or ever.\" Strong arms held her tightly, returning the kiss, and Chuck eased himself on top of her. Her green eyes met his, with a smile she asked, \"So you read Kelly's note, huh?\" \" Well, there's a mood-killer right there!\" Chuck looked down and laughed. \"What?\" Tina asked him. \"I was just surprised that she wrote to you,\" he told her simply as he scooted off her and lay by her side. \"And Wilson said…\" Tina stretched lazily and leaned her head on her palm with her elbow propped up on her pillow. \"Wilson, huh? What did Wilson say?\" she asked with a slight smile. Chuck wasn't sure what to make of the way she asked that but continued, \"Well, Wilson was always on your side.\" \"Wilson was always on my side,\" she repeated, her eyes fixed on the pink roses on her quilt. With a smile, her green eyes met his. \"That's good to know, Chuck.\" \"Yeah, and he wasn't happy at all with Kelly,\" \" Wilson wasn't, huh?\" Chuck looked at Tina uncertainly. \"Why do you keep saying it like that? What, don't you believe me?\" he asked her defensively. Another thought, even more terrifying struck him as he narrowed his eyes at her surprised face. He sat up in the bed and cocked his head to the side. \"You think I'm crazy, don't you?\" he demanded accusingly. Tina sat up in the bed, bracing the covers and reached out to him. \"No, I don't think you're crazy, Chuck. I never did. It's just that….\" she stopped and turned her face to the side. Chuck could feel the anger inside himself beginning to rise. He was starting to wonder if he knew this woman at all. It sounded as though she was mocking him. \"It's just that what , Tina?\" he asked her coldly. She was taken aback by the sudden change in his tone. Intuitively she knew that if she didn't approach this just the right way that she could lose him. Taking her hand in his, she told him, \"Let's just calm down, Chuck.\" He held still, unfazed by the warm gentleness of her hand. \"Finish what you were going to say.\" His blue eyes turned cold. Closing her eyes, she breathed a deep sigh. \"I just don't know if you're ready to hear this yet, Chuck. I was going to let you figure this out on your own,\" she told him hesitantly. He pulled his hand away from her and raised his voice, \"What? That you're going to have me committed?\" Tina laughed and shook her head. \"No, Dummy. Will you please just calm down and listen to me?\" Chuck was silent as he observed her passive smile and relaxed body language. \"You see, Chuck, I have a Wilson too,\" she told him softly and noticed that his body began to relax. \"What?\" he asked her, shaking his head. \" What ?\" \"Now you think I'm crazy, don't you?\" she asked him taking his hand in hers again but this time his fingers welcomed hers and stroked them gently. Chuck didn't respond as he watched her questioningly. \"I have my own Wilson. That's right,\" she nodded. \"My Wilson told me not to let any man get close to me again. And never to trust or love because as soon as I did, that man was bound to leave me.\" Chuck's eyes looked away from her and he breathed a guilty sigh. \"Chuck, don't you think it's rather odd that the volleyball doesn't have to be in front of you in order to hear its voice?\" He shook his head. \"No, on the island, there were times I heard him without being right there.\" She nodded understandingly. \"We're actually very fortunate, Chuck-that we listen to our voice. Everyone has one, you know. Most people tune it out or just choose not to listen to it.\" Chuck looked at her serious face silently, alarmed by the meaning of her words slowly sinking in. \"It's the voice of reason,\" she explained matter-of-factly. \"Although we don't normally give it a name or a face, or attach it to a tangible object; you were in survival mode on that island. Stranded alone, you had no other choice.\" A single tear fell down his cheek. His blue eyes looked past her and he could see himself on that island, on the beach, and recall the first conversation. \"I know that,\" he said quietly, nodding his head slowly. \"I've always known on some level.\" He could recall many conversations he'd had with Wilson, a lot of them unpleasant. \"It was sort of a game, at first, but then it became real. As time passed, Wilson was real to me.\" Tina leaned in toward him and laid her head on his shoulder. \"This is what I'm trying to say, Chuck. Wilson is real; just not the way you think he is,\" she told him wisely. Chuck heaved a sigh. \"You're right,\" he told her softly. He chuckled, \"He's a real smart ass, though, I'll tell you.\" They sat quietly for a moment then he faced her. \"How long ago did you figure this out?\" \"The first night that you told me.\" With raised eyebrows, he looked at her. \"Oh,\" he squeezed her and laughed. \"Well, you're quite the smarty-pants, aren't you?\" She looked at him incredulously. \"What? You weren't thinking all this time that I was some kind of ditz, were you?\" \"Well, no…\" Open-mouthed, she stared at him, her hurt expression apparent on her face. \"Oh come on, Chuck.\" He took her into his arms and kissed her. \"I have always known that you were smart and beautiful.\" \"Mmmm-hmm,\" she agreed doubtfully. \"I have,\" Chuck told her and held her in his arms, happy that things were okay between them. Then he pulled away from her and looked at her mischievously. \"Riddle me this, Smartypants. I have two coins in my hand that equal 30 cents,\" he began, showing her his closed fist, \"one is not a nickel, what are the two coins?\" Tina didn't miss a beat. \"The two coins would have to be a quarter and a nickel. You said one was not a nickel so the other coin had to be a quarter.\" \"Damn!\" With a smirk she sat up and reached her robe, standing and wrapping it around herself. Chuck sat up as well and reached his cane. \"Okay, now spell the word -Supercalifragilisticexpealadocius.\" Tying the belt around her waist she laughed. \"Oh come on, Chuck, what are we, eight years old?\" Chuck looked challengingly at her. \"What's wrong, Tina? Can't spell the word?\" Walking towards the door she rolled her eyes. \"S-u-p-e-r-c-a-l...\" Setting the cup in front of her at the table, he smiled, and filled the mug with coffee. \"We'll have to check the spelling on that one.\" She spooned some creamer into her cup, sipped some coffee, and looked up at him. \"Chuck, let it go.\" With a chuckle he sat and stirred his own coffee. \" It sure would have been nice to have someone as smart as you with me on that island.\" She took another sip and laughed. \"If I'd been there we would've gotten off that island much sooner.\" Taken aback, he froze and his eyes locked onto hers. \"Oh really? How much sooner?\" Tina looked up thoughtfully and tapped her cheek with her finger. \"Probably after a few months- I would've been out of there.\" Chuck snifted, \"Riiiiight, Tina. There were too many things to consider; the tide, the winds, the weather, the seasons…\" Tina snapped her fingers. \"That reminds me, Chuck. A couple of days ago…\" she began excitedly, bouncing around on her seat barely able to contain herself. \"Well, there's going to be this show on Oprah…\" Chuck looked up with interest. \"About people who've survived against extraordinary odds.\" \"Really?\" he asked, impressed, as she nodded to him. \"We should record it. I think I'd really like to watch that one.\" Tina nearly spit out her coffee and shook her head. \"No, Chuck, I don't think you understand. Two days ago, a producer from the Oprah Winfrey show called here. They would like for you to appear.\" A/N: Thanks bunches and bunches to Nate! The end is near, and I have the story written completely. I would love to hear what you think so far.[Chapter 18] Chapter 18 Epilogue Beautiful dawn – lights up the shore for me. There is nothing else in the world, I'd rather wake up and see –with you. Beautiful dawn – I'm just chasing time again, Thought I would die a lonely man, in endless night. But now I'm high; running wild among all the stars above. Beautiful dawn – melt with the stars again. Do you remember the day when my journey began? Will you remember the end - of time? Beautiful dawn – you're just blowing my mind again. Thought I was born to endless night, until you shine. High; running wild with all the stars above. Sometimes it's hard to believe you remember me. Will you be my shoulder when I'm grey and older? Promise me tomorrow starts with you. Getting high; running wild among all the stars above. Sometimes it's hard to believe you remember me. -James Blunt, \"High\" Chuck leaned over and peered out the small window. Hundreds of miles below he could see the ocean. Distant, mesmerizing, and daunting; the dark, blue sea stretched on endlessly. Lost in thought, he found his eyes were hypnotized by the sight. \"Do you hate me?\" Chuck looked over at Tina's face, smiling and batting her eyelashes coquettishly at him as she took his hand and leaned her head on his shoulder. \"That, my dear Mrs. Noland,\" he began, \" is an impossibility,\" he told her charmingly with a smile and kissed her gently on the lips, lacing his fingers with hers. Tina faced him, her face shadowed with a worried expression. \"Are you sure? You gave me the choice of anywhere in the world to go for our honeymoon, and I chose…\" \"Hawaii,\" they said simultaneously. Chuck absently ran a thumb over the diamond solitaire that graced her finger. \"Anywhere with you, my dear, will be paradise.\" Tina giggled and nudged him. \"That's very sweet, but, Chuck, we're married now. You don't have to say those things to me.\" \"I plan to say many things like that to you, Tina, for as long as we both shall live.\" Tina sighed happily and leaned her head back on his shoulder. Chuck gazed out at the white, billowy clouds. \"Besides, there's a vast difference from being stranded alone on a desert island to spending seven wonderful days on an island resort with your beautiful bride.\" Leaning her head up to him, she kissed him. \"I love the ocean, Chuck, and I love you.\" \"I love you too,\" he replied contentedly, happy that her eyes were still sparkly, and kissed her again. \"Truthfully, I kind of miss it. I mean, I wouldn't want to go back and live there, but it was beautiful.\" She smiled widely, her dimples showing. \"I think Oprah was pretty impressed with you.\" Chuck laughed at the humbling experience of being in front of a live audience and recalled how nervous he'd been. \"Well, Oprah was pretty amazing herself. It was mighty generous of her to pay for our honeymoon.\" \"Mmmm hmmh,\" Tina agreed. \"This honeymoon, Tina, it's just the beginning of a whole new life for us,\" he told her contentedly. The steady buzzing noise of the airplane continued and Chuck embraced his wife happily as the two contemplated their future.

If you would like something more, then please continue... \"Goddamn, son of a bitch, mother f$#&!\" \"Now, Tina…\" \"Piece of shit, asshole, do you have something to say to me?\" she shrieked, her face twisted with madness, sweat dripping from her brow. Chuck stood there, red-faced, shook his head, and looked down. \"This is all your fault, Chuck Noland! See if I ever let you lay a hand on me again! Bastard!\" The nurse smiled uneasily at him. \"Please try not to take anything she says right now personal.\" Tina's angry attention turned to the older woman. \"Listen here, Beotch, when is this f&#[Chapter 19] A/N:nThis was written as an afterthought and because I felt like writingnsomething Christmas-y. I hope you enjoy! And a quick thanks to thosenwho submitted reviews- each one is like opening up a gift! AnVery Noland Christmas I'mndreaming of a white Christmas just like the ones I used to know... Thensoothing sound of Elvis's voice resounded throughout the shoppingncenter. The bitter cold of the season and the festive decorationsnseemed to have everyone buzzing about with Christmas spirit. Tinanhummed along as she waited patiently. \"Donyou think this makes my butt look fat?\" Tinanstood in the dressing room with a smirk as Chuck exaggeratedlynmodeled the dark blue pair of jeans in front of the long mirror.n\"Very funny.\" She walked up to Chuck and embraced him. \"Inthink they look great on you,\" she stated, smacking him on hisnbehind. \"Besides, you really needed pants.\" Chucknsmiled, \"Well, okay then. Thank God this was the last of them.\" He eyed the pile of clothes he'dntried on and sighed. \"Are you sure you don't mind, Tina? I feelnlike we've been clothes shopping forever.\" Withna sly smile she told him, \"You know, Chuck, the only thing Inenjoy more than dressing you is un dressingnyou.\" Tina faced him and nimbly began to unfasten the button tonthe jeans. Withnwide eyes, Chuck protested; grabbing her hands, looking aroundnfearfully. \"Tina, my God, we are in a public place!\" Hernhands slid easily around his neck and she kissed him provocatively.n\"Like we've never done that before.\" \"Yeah,nbut, we still have Christmas shopping to do. Don't we still have tonfind something for Ricky?\" Chuck breathed, finding himselfndisarmed by the continual movement of her soft lips on his neck. \"Ricky'sngift can wait,\" Tina told him flirtatiously, her green eyesnbright as she pulled him back into the small room and quickly lockednthe door. \"I can't.\" Chuck'snvoice was husky as he complied, \"Well, when you put it thatnway...\" ChristmasnEve \"MerrynChristmas, Tina and Chuck, and congratulations on your wedding! WithnLove, and Best Wishes from The Lovett family,\" Ricky read thencard in his hands and scrutinized the picture of Kelly, Jerry, andntheir daughter, Katie's smiling faces. \"Hey, Chuck isn't thisnthe gal you dumped for my sister?\" BeforenChuck could answer, Tina emerged from the kitchen with a sliced hamnon a tray and set it on the dining table. \"Why yes, it is,nRicky. And thanks for bringing up such a painful memory,\" shentold him offhanded. Hisneyes met Chuck's. \"You made the right choice.\" Chucknsmiled and nodded in agreement as he poured wine into their glasses.n\"Definitely.\" Annattractive blond in her mid-thirties rounded the corner holding antray of deviled eggs and set them on the table as Tina gave her ansmile. \"I'm so happy that you can be here with us, Trisha.\"nTina winked at Ricky. \"It's been years since my brother'snbrought a lady friend home for the holidays.\" Trisha'snlight blue eyes lit up, and a warm smile came about her face. Hernvoice was surprisingly nasal and high-pitched. \"I was sonthrilled when Richard invited me to meet his sister andnbrother-in-law!\" Tinanblinked -still surprised at how Trisha's voice did not match hernappearance. Curiously, Tina turned to Ricky. \"Richard?\" Rickyncut in gruffly, \"Yes, Richard, so what of it?\" \"Welln, it's just that we've only ever called you Richard, hmm...let'snsee...never,\" she replied laying silverware on the table. \"So,nI've decided that I want to be called Richard now.\" Tinanstopped what she was doing, stood up straight, and met her brother'sngreen eyes. \"After 44 years, you decide you want to start beingncalled Richard?\" Chucknlooked up alarmed by Tina's challenging tone. Ricky'sneyes met hers with annoyance. \"Oh, I'm sorry,\" he began;nsarcasm apparent in his tone, \"do you have a problem with that, Bettina ?\" Chuckncaught Tina narrowing her eyes at her brother and cut in. \"No,nshe doesn't.\" Thenfoursome took their seats and began to serve themselves. \"So,nChuck, is there any news about your book?\" Ricky asked, cuttingnhis ham. \"Itnshould be released any day now.\" Chuck told him with a smile. \"WhennRichard showed me the spread about you in People magazine, I was sonexcited to meet you!\" Trisha squeaked. \"Mynhusband seems to have that effect on people,\" Tina told themnproudly, winking at Chuck. She watched as Trisha and Ricky exchangednaffectionate glances, \"So how long have you been seeing eachnother?\" \"Fivenmonths,\" Trisha chirped. Thisnwas a surprise to Tina because Ricky had never mentioned his petite,nblond companion. Then again, after two failed marriages he had takennto solitude like a hermit. As she caught the rapport between him andnTrisha, she couldn't deny that her brother looked happy. \"So whyndon't you tell us the story of how you two met?\" \"Ohnit was sweet, really,\" Trisha began, \"My girlfriend and Inwere having dinner and a waiter dropped a note for me from a man atnthe bar.\" Rickynshifted in his seat uncomfortably. Withna smile Tina asked, \"Oh, you must tell what the note said!\" Rickyncleared his throat and shook his head at Trisha. \"Itnwas so cuuuute,\" Trisha told her; her eyes grabbing the group'snattention. \"It said, 'I'm Richard, but I have no idea who younare. Let's change that,'\" she finished with a twang. Tinantried to keep herself from laughing. \"Really?\" she asked,nas Trisha nodded enthusiastically. Ricky's eyes stayed fixed on thenplate in front of him. Chucknwatched the scene, amused. He'd never seen Ricky embarrassed beforenand he could see the twisted pleasure it was giving his wife. Thensiblings hadn't stopped bickering since his arrival and in Tina'snmind Ricky had shared too much information about her personal life.n\"It's too bad Mom couldn't be here.\" Rickynpicked up the cue quickly, grateful to Chuck for changing thensubject. \"Yeah, she's up north with her boyfriend and she sendsnher best.\" \"So,nTrisha, how about we discuss some little known facts about mynbrother?\" Tina asked with an evil grin. Rickynclosed his eyes and shook his head. Trisha'snface lit up and she squealed, \"I would love to!\" Tinanfound that she couldn't help herself. Happily she seized thenopportunity. \"Well, when Ricky-sorry, Richard, and I were kids,nwe used to play dress-up.\" Thenblond was positively captivated by the idea. \"Awww, that's sonsweet!\" she said looking at Ricky adoringly as he gesturednwildly to Tina to stop. \"You mean he used to dress up in yourndaddy's suit and tie?\" Rickynattempted to change the subject. \"So, Chuck, Tina says you'venbecome pretty good at welding...\" Chucknnodded, watching amusedly in silence enjoying a mouthful of ham. \"Nonsuit and tie for my big brother,\" Tina roared, her nosencrinkled. \"He used to dress up in Mama's dresses!\" Chucknstifled a laugh, and began coughing uncontrollably at the piece ofnham that had gone down the wrong way. \"That'snenough, Bettina!\" Ricky exclaimed turning different shades ofnred. Cockingnher head to the side, Trisha gazed at Ricky adoringly. \"That isnnothing to be ashamed of,\" she said laying her delicate hand onnhis shoulder. The blond turned to Tina, \"I think it's sweet thatnhe has a feminine side.\" Tinanhad reached over and was patting Chuck's back firmly. \"Oh,nTrisha, you don't know the half of it. Up until he was a teenager henwas afraid of the dark...he used to scream like a little girl!\"nTina added wickedly. \"DidnI ever mention that my sister cusses like a sailor?\" Ricky askednthe blond. Tina'snmouth dropped open. \"I learned from the best, eh, Rich - ard ?\"nshe shot back. Thenblond watched in horror as the siblings continued to take verbal jabsnat each other completely ignoring Chuck's attempts to settle themndown. Suddenly, Trisha stood up from her chair and let out a loud,nscreeching whistle from her lips that caught everyone's attention.n\"People, it's Christmas! This is a time for peace and love.\"nSatisfied with their guilty expressions, Trisha continued, \"Inhave an announcement to make,\" she cleared her throat, regainingnher composure and fluffed her hair, then continued in hernhigh-pitched tone, \"Richard asked me to marry him...\" Tina'snexpression quickly changed to surprise and the whole group'snattention was focused on Trisha as they watched her expectantly. \"AndnI said yes!\" Ansmile overcame Tina's lips as she noticed the blond's shining eyesnand Ricky's delighted expression. The two did appear to be in love.n\"I'd like to make a toast. Let me be the first to sayncongratulations to Ricky and Trisha on your engagement, I know you'llnbe very happy together,\" she said, raising her glass to thenhappy couple and winked at her brother mischievously. \"May thisnmarriage last longer than Ricky's other two.\" Tinanfelt Chuck's elbow dig into her side as she delighted in Ricky's andnTrisha's shocked expressions. \"I was just joking.\" Chucknfurrowed his eyebrows at his wife and stood, smiled, and faced Rickynand his fiancee. \"I'd like to say something.\" He clearednhis throat, \"The past four Christmases I have spent entirelynalone. Each one I thought might be my last. Now, being here, I am sonthankful that I have a beautiful wife, a brother-in-law, and a futurensister-in-law to share this Christmas with. I look forward to manynmore to come. Family is truly the most important thing.\" Ansmall tear slid down Tina's cheek and she smiled brightly at Chuck.nTrisha and Ricky met Tina's gaze with a smile. \"Inask you now to raise your glasses,\" Chuck requested and watchednas everyone followed suit. \"To family. May us never have to livenwithout them.\" Thengroup smiled appreciatively, insults gone and forgotten, and toastednin unison, \"To family.\" ChristmasnDay Thenlivingroom smelled of coffee and the mouth-watering aroma ofnchocolate chip cookies. The tall Christmas tree sat brightly in frontnof the corner window, beautifully decorated with many handmadenornaments as well as gold, silver, and red shiny spheres. Garlandnmade from popcorn covered the tree. Aprilnlay by the sofa gnawing on her new rawhide bone and Hobbes dug hisnclaws into his brand new scratch box. Tina and Chuck sat side by sidenexchanging gifts; the carpeted floor now a cluttered mess of wrappingnand bows. Admiringly,nChuck's eyes treasured the engraved Swiss army knife in his hand.n\"This is perfect, Tina. Thank you.\" Tinanleaned over and kissed him softly on the lips. \"May you never benstranded without it.\" Blindly, she reached for another gift andnhanded it to Chuck. Withna smile, Chuck accepted the package from her and tore into itneagerly. \"Chess for Dummies,\" Chuck read sourly as he torenthe remainder of the wrapping paper from the book. \"That's cute,nTina. Real cute.\" Tinangiggled. \"Aw c'mon, Chuck, it was a gag gift, I haven't givennyou your real gift yet.\" Chucknlaughed. \"By the way, you know that see-through lace nightie wasna gag gift, don't you?\" Hernface fell and she asked him with a disappointed frown, \"It was?nYou mean you don't want me to wear it?\" Chuckncorrected himself, \"I mean that it was intended to be a gag,nbut, of course I want you to wear it,\" he told her noddingneagerly. Satisfiednwith his reply, she smiled and handed him another gift. \"Thisnone's for Wilson.\" Chuck'snmouth dropped open at her thoughtfulness as he eyed the package andnlooked to Wilson, who sat happily beside them wearing a santa hat.n\"Aw...Tina, you shouldn't have,\" he told her examining thennot quite square shape of the present. \"Well,nI just figured he must get lonely because you don't talk to himnanymore.\" Chucknleaned close to her and brushed her lips lightly with his. \"Thatnwas very considerate of you.\" He tore open the wrapping quicklynand chuckled as he gazed upon a new Wilson volleyball. Tina turnednthe volleyball around and Chuck laughed out loud as his eyes took innthe sight before him. Tinanhad drawn a face. It was female, complete with eyelashes, bright rednlips, dimples, and one eye winking. Withna big smile, Chuck took the female volleyball and placed her besidenWilson. \"Oh, I can hear him already. He's saying, 'How you doin'?'\"nThe sound of Tina's musical laughter reminded him. \"Okay, yournturn now.\" Tinanwas puzzled. \"Well, Chuck, you already gave me earrings, a cellnphone, a red scarf, which I love, by the way, and the ...\" \"There'snone more,\" he told her as he handed her an envelope decoratednwith a shiny silver bow. Shengave him a puzzled look as she slid open the envelope. She pulled outnthe contents and with a smile of delight, she jumped up and down andnhugged him excitedly. \"You're taking me to Hawaii again?!\" Chucknsmiled. \"Well, I figured it's also our six-month anniversary-\" Tinaninterrupted him with a long kiss. It was such a wonderful surprise,nand since they'd been together Chuck never ceased to be thoughtfulnand caring. She wondered how it was that she ever lived without him.nIt was then she remembered the last gift under the tree. It wasnChuck's and it was the one that meant the most to her. Gingerlynshe placed the airplane tickets back into the envelope. \"Thanknyou, Chuck. What an amazing gift. I can't wait,\" Tina told himnand squeezed his hand. \"You have one more gift.\" Thentwo stood in front of the tree; their eyes settled on the hugenpresent before them. It was wrapped in shiny snowman paper and toppednwith a big, red bow. Withna laugh, Chuck said, \"I can't possibly guess what that couldnbe.\" Tinanwore a sneaky smile. \"And you won't. Open it.\" Chucknmade his way over to the side of the large package and lifted it. Itnwasn't heavy. \"Okay, it can't be a big screen tv.\" He tooknthe red velvet bow from the top and placed it aside. \"Love thenbow.\" With his finger, he tore into the seam at the top. \"Loventhe wrapping.\" Innanticipation she watched him slowly, torturously unwrap the box. Shenwas tempted to unwrap it herself. Hentore open the box, and to his surprise, he found another box inside,nalso wrapped. \"Wow...it's...it's...another box!\" Chuck tooknit out and began to unwrap. \"Love the wrapping- penguins thisntime.\" He lifted the slightly smaller box and shook it. \"Letnsee, \" he guessed, \"it's a..nother box,\" he said as henunwrapped it and opened it. Fivenboxes later Chuck'sntone was less enthusiastic as he grew tired of unwrapping the boxes.n\"Love the wrapping. Angels, this time.\" Tinanfelt like she was going to burst from excitement as she watched himnfinally unwrap the smallest package that was the size of a shoebox. Chucknbreathed a sigh of relief as he opened the wrapping and found thatnthis was the real gift. He lifted the tissue carefully and found anpiece of paper. His eyes met hers curiously and she quietly stood bynhis side as he gingerly lifted the gold-embossed sheet. Henread it out loud: TennReasons Why I Love You 1.nBecause you make me laugh. 2.nBecause you love Elvis. 3.nBecause you saved my life. 4.nBecause you delivered the package to me. 5.nBecause you love me. 6.nBecause I couldn't ask for a better husband. 7.nBecause you are a kind, generous human being. 8.nBecause of your ocean-colored eyes. 9.nBecause these past six months have been the best of my life. 10.nBecause you are the father of my child. That'snright, Chuck, you're going to be a daddy. Merry Christmas ! Chucknhad tears in his eyes as he read the last words. Silently, he turnednto Tina and pulled her into his embrace. Tightly he squeezed her andngave her a long, sweet kiss. \"Thank you, Tina. It's the bestnChristmas present you could ever give me,\" he told hernsincerely, his blue eyes clouding up again. \"When?\" henwhispered anxiously. Shencouldn't wipe the grin off her face if she wanted. \"Late Augustnor early September.\" Thentwo held each other in front of the Christmas tree, perfectly contentnand happy. Tina looked up into his eyes and kissed him. \"MerrynChristmas, Chuck. I love you.\" Itnwas the happiest day of his life as his arms held Tina, and his heartnwas filled with joy. \"I love you too, Tina.

While Melanie was on the phonenJake had cleaned and tidied the house and prepared a romantic mealnfor her. Melanie finished her phone conversation and went downnstairs hoping that she could moan to Jake about her suppliers andnthen they could have an early night. When she walked into the livingnroom it was dark, at first she thought that maybe Jake had gone outnand then she saw all the candles and the huge bouquet of lilies innthe middle of the beautifully set table. \"Jake\" she said completelynshocked, \"What have I done to deserve all this?\" \"Well Mrs Perry I see it hasnslipped your mind but it has been 6 weeks since we rekindled ournmarriage\" \"Oh my god of course it is\"nsaid Melanie as she went over and hugged Jake, \"but you know youndidn't have to do all this. Don't you remember what you did for ournone month anniversary\" \"Yeah but aren't I allowed tonspoil my wife?\" said Jake as he pulled a chair out for Melaniento sit on. \"Of course you can and you reallyndon't have to stop\" said Melanie as she sat down. \"I don't intend to\" repliednJake Jake and Melanie sat down to dinner andnthey talked. While Jake was telling her about his day, Melaniencouldn't believe she had even considered marrying Andrew. Her andnJake were made for each other and she was so glad he had taken hernback after her behavior towards him when she came back to get andivorce. As Melanie was telling him about her argument with hernsuppliers, Jake couldn't believe how lucky he was that Melanie hadncome back to him, when she could have had everything she had everndreamed of with that Andrew guy. After dinner Jake and Melanie watched anmovie as they snuggled up together on the sofa. \"Well Mrs Perry\" Melaniencouldn't help but smile every time Jake called her that \" Inthink it's time to go and do what we do best and can I just add thatnI love that we do it at least twice a day now\" Jake was obviously talking about sexnand it was just then that Melanie realized that she and Jake had beennhaving sex for 6 weeks uninterrupted. \"Uh no\" gasped Melanie \"aww why?\" asked Jakenconfused, \"Oh is it the \"special time\"\" he askedndisappointed. \"No thats the problem\" saidnMelanie who was now starting to panic \"Hey honey calm down\" saidnJake concerned \"I'm 3 weeks late\" whisperednMelanie \"What are you serious? You'renpregnant. Thats great news.\" said Jake excitedly but when hensaw that Melanie wasn't happy or excited he asked her \"What'snwrong. We're having a baby aren't you happy?\" \"Jake what if it's Andrew's\"nsaid Melanie quietly not wanting to say the words out loud in casenthat made them true. \"Oh shit\" said Jake \"rightnbefore we start to panic we better find out if you are pregnant ornnot\" he said trying to keep calm \"I'll go and get a testnfrom the pharmacy\" \"But what if someone sees you andnguesses it might not be yours\" said Melanie clearly distressed \"Well we have to know\" arguednJake \"don't worry I'll be discreet\" he said as he left thenhouse 'Shit' thought Melanie as she tried tonwork out when her last period was, it had been a week before thendisastrous wedding, and she had only slept with Andrew twice sincenher last period. But she and Jake had done it a LOT since they gotnback together, so it was probably Jake's. 'Twice' she thought 'itnonly took once'[Chapter 2] Pregnant Jake was in his truck thinking about what had just happened, Melanie could be and most probably was pregnant but it might not be his. What was he gonna do if it wasn't. Leave her and break his heart at the same time. Jake had no idea what to do, all he wanted was to know if she was pregnant or not. Jake went into the pharmacy and got the pregnancy test without being seen. When he arrived home he found Melanie pacing on the porch. \"Hey did you get it? Did anyone see you?\" she asked urgently \"I got it and no nobody saw me\" Jake replied as he went in the house closely followed by Melanie. A few minutes later Melanie emerged from the bathroom holding the white stick, she looked over at Jake who was sitting at the breakfast bar. \"so\" asked Jake \"We have to wait 3 minutes for the results\" said Melanie as she went over and put the stick on the breakfast bar. \"Oh honey thats really not hygienic. I really don't want pee and toast for breakfast tomorrow\" said Jake trying to make Melanie laugh. Melanie laughed and then said, \"Jake don't it's not funny. What if it is his baby.\" Jake saw the tears in Melanie's eyes and he put his arm around her waist and pulled her onto his lap, \"I love you and whatever happens we will get through it together\" he said \"Really because I wouldn't blame you if you wanted me to go right now\" said Melanie as a tears rolled down her cheek. Melanie then stood up and faced Jake. \"Look\" said Jake as he also stood up and wiped the tear from Melanie's cheek, \"You're not going anywhere I was without you for 7 years and I don't intend on ever being away from you any longer than is absolutely necessary. I'm not going to lose you now that I've finally got you back. If you leave I'll follow you, I'll do whatever it takes to keep you\" he said determindly \"Oh Jake I love you so much\" Jake gave Melanie a big hug and told her that everything would be all right, when they pulled apart they realised that the 3 minutes were up. \"Jake look for me I can't do it\" pleaded Melanie Jake went over to the breakfast bar and picked up the stick. \"It positive\" he said \"You're pregnant\" \"Oh\" was all Melanie could say. She had no idea how she felt about it she defineltely wanted to have Jake's children but she didn't want anything to do with Andrew but she also felt like she was ready to be a mother. \"I uh need to think. I'll be back soon\" said Jake as he left the house. Melanie thought she knew what that meant, that he was going to the bar and wouldn't be back for hours until he is reallt drunk. But Jake didn't go to the bar, he came home about an hour after he had left and he found Melanie sitting at the kitchen table looking at her wedding ring sobbing. \"Oh honey shhhh\" said Jake as he went over and put his arm round Melanie \"It's okay there's no need to cry\" \"Yes there is it might be Andrew's. I was thinking maybe I could just get an abortion\" sniffed Melanie \"What and risk killing our baby. I don't think so and anyway I don't think you could go through with that\" \"Then what I don't know what to do. I love you and I can't bear the thought of losing you now that I've got you back\" said Melanie \"Hey I'm not going anywhere, even if it isn't mine\" said Jake \"I couldn't ask you to bring up another man's child\" \"Well maybe I won't have to. I remembered reading in the newspaper last week about a clinic that have this machine that can pin point the exact time of a baby's conception right down to the hour from a sonogram picture. The clinic's in LA and if you're willing I booked us on a flight tonight and got us an appointment for tomorrow at 1pm\" said Jake \"Really of course I'm willing I wanna know as soon as possible when is the flight?\" \"We have to leave here in an hour to make it to the airport on time\" said Jake before he kissed Melanie. awwww isn't Jake so sweet[Chapter 3] The Clinic It was 11am and Melanie and Jake werensitting in a cafe in LA eating breakfast. Melanie and Jake had spent the entirenflight last night talking about the future. Jake had reassurednMelanie that no matter who the father was that he would stick by hernand the baby. Jake had told her that it was up to her what they toldnpeople, Jake was more than willing to tell everyone that it was hisnbaby and raise it as his own. Jake had also told her that if shenwanted Andrew to be involved he would support that as well. Melaniendidn't know what she would do if it was Andrew's, she thought thatnpeople deserved to know where they came from, but she didn't wantnAndrew to be any part of her and Jake's life. \"I love you\" said Melanienspontaneously interrupting the silence \"Where did that come from?\"nasked Jake as he put down his knife and fork \"I was just thinking how lucky Inam to have you. I don't know what I did to deserve you.\" saidnMelanie \"Hey I'm the lucky one, to havensuch a gorgeous wife.\" said Jake smiling \"That not sure if the baby she'sncarrying is yours\" \"I thought we talked about thatnlast night. It's not your fault. I'm not going anywhere. I lovenyou too much to leave you.\" said Jake as he moved his chairncloser to Melanie. \"I know I just wanted to tell younI love you and after all the things you said last night, it made menlove you even more and I didn't think that that was possible.\" \"Okay then\" said Jake as henput his arm round Melanie \"I love you too and you'll never knownhow much\" he said before he kissed her head, \"now I don'tnwant you to worry about the clinic okay, it's not good for you or thenbaby\" \"Okay\" Jake and Melanie finished theirnbreakfast and then made their way to the clinic. They had to wait innthe waiting room for about 15 minutes. Melanie was terrified and shencouldn't get a song out of her head. WhennI'm lost in the rain, In your eyes I know I'll find the light Tonlight my way. And when I'm scared, And losing ground, Whennmy world is going crazy, You can turn it all around.

Melanienturned to look at Jake and she knew why she couldn't get the song outnof her head, she did always turn to Jake when things went wrong, evernsince she was 10 years old, he was her protector. n n Justnthen Melanie and Jake were called into the doctors office, they wentnin and sat opposite the doctor. n \"Hello it's Mr and Mrs Perry isn't it\"nasked the doctor n n \"Yes\" said Jake n n n \"Alrightnwell I'm doctor Murray, but you can call me Louise\" n n \"Okay Inwas just wondering about um... privacy for us.

There really isn't anything tonworry about\" said doctor Murray \"Goodn, see I told you there was nothing to worry about\" said Jakensqueezing Melanie's hand. \"Okay,nnow do I need to explain how this works?\" asked doctor Murray n n \"Uh no notnreally, the only thing we really want to know is if this could harmnthe baby in any way\" asked Jake n \"No it's completely 100 harmless tonthe mother or the baby. What happens is we take a sonogram picturenand then we put it into our machine along with the mother's details,nage, weight etc and then the machine gives us the date and time ofnconception. Do you understand?\" said the doctor. \"Yes\"nsaid both Jake and Melanie \"Okaynthen you just have to fill out some forms and I need to give you anphysical to get the details I need and then we take the sonogramnpicture.\" Melanienlooked over at Jake and he looked at her and squeezed her hand again,nand she just knew that everything would be alright as long as she hadnJake. Melanienfilled out the forms, had the physical and the sonogram all with Jakenby her side the whole time. Jake and Melanie walked out of thenclinic hand in hand, but what they didn't know was a reporter for thenNew York Times had saw them and recognizes Melanie as Andrew's exnfiancee.[Chapter 4] Andrew Jake and Melanie had to wait 2 days fornthe results. It was the day after they had gone to the clinic andnthey were watching 'Along Came Polly' in their hotel room, lyingntogether on the bed watching in. There was a knock on the door. \"Oh that must be our ice cream. nI'll get it\" said Melanie as she got up and went into the othernroom to answer the door. \"Andrew\" said Melaniencompletely shocked \"Hi Mel I think you've got somenexplaining to do\" said Andrew as he walked into the hotel roomnand handed Melanie the newspaper he was holding. Melanie read the front page headlinenand saw the picture of her and Jake leaving the clinic yesterday. \"Oh no how the hell did theynknow?\" she whispered \"Hey honey whats taking you sonlong?\" said Jake as he came into the room and when he saw whonMelanie was talking to he said \"What the hell are you doingnhere?\" and he went over and put his arm protectively roundnMelanie. \"Jake look\" said Melanie asnshe handed him the newspaper, \"Oh shit\" he said when he sawnit \"Yeah, so are you pregnant?\"nasked Andrew \"Yes I am\" said Melanie asnshe moved in closer to Jake \"Alright.

I'llnfind out if it's my baby. I'll be there when you get the results. nMel we need to talk whether this Neanderthal likes it or not\"nthen Andrew started to make his way to the door closely followed bynJake. \"Don't you ever come here andnupset my wife again\" said Jake \"Well like it or not I'm a part ofnthis\" said Andrew before Jake slammed the door in his face, thenturned round to face Melanie. \"Oh Jake he knows what am I goingnto do if it's his\" said Melanie almost in tears. \"Hey don't worry whatever happensnwe will work it out together\" said Jake as he went over tonMelanie and pulled her into his arms.

The next morning Jake woke up and earlynand went into the kitchen and started preparing breakfast, he wantednto surprise Melanie with breakfast in bed. As he was frying thenbacon, Jake heard a knock at the door he turned off the stove andnwent to see who it was and when he saw he was gob smacked. \"Star\" he said. He had gonenout with Star a few times before he and Melanie had gotten backntogether, he hadn't heard from her since the night Melanie had gottenndrunk at the bar and he had taken her home. \"Hi Jake\" she replied \"Wh-what are you doing here?\"nJake asked stepping out into the porch so as not to wake Melanie. \"I uh know I haven't been in touchnfor a while but I was thinking that maybe we could go for a drinkntonight\" said Star Before Jake could let her down gentlynMelanie emerged from the house fully dressed and had clearly heardnwhat Star had just said. \"Oh hi it's Melanie right. HasnJake finally divorced you?\" asked Star and then she noticed thenwedding ring on her finger she continued \"Of course he has I cannsee your wedding ring. So what are you doing here?\" Jake saw Melanie's eyes flash and henthought 'uh oh there's gonna be trouble' \"No actually he hasn't divorced menwe got back together and I'm pregnant and I find my husband out herentalking to some blonde floozy. Now most of the time I have quite anviolent temper but since I got pregnant I've been a lot morenvolatile, so I suggest you get out of here and stay away from mynhusband or you'll feel the full wrath of my temper.\" saidnMelanie as she walked closer and closer to Star \"Uh Okay I'm sorry I didn't know\"nsaid Star before she ran down the stairs and out of sight. \"Did you have to be so rude tonher\" asked Jake as he went back in the house \"What! She's lucky she's still innone piece\" said Melanie following Jake into the house. \"Oh come on Mel she didn't know\" \"Why didn't you tell her. Werenyou hoping to keep as a bit on the side?\" said Melanie gettingnangry \"Oh you're being ridiculous now\"nsaid Jake who was also getting mad. \"Am I\" shouted Melanie \"Oh I don't need this I'm going tonwork\" Jake shouted back before storming out \"Fine\" Melanie shouted afternhim.[Chapter 7] Can't sleep Jake got back from work at 8pm, henheard Melanie working up in the attic, he grabbed a beer out of thenfridge and sat down to watch tv. He was still mad about what hadnhappened that morning, how could Melanie even think that he would beninterested in Star. A few hours later Jake heard Melaniencome into the room, obviously still mad too. \"You can sleep on the couch\"nshe said to him coldly \"Fine\" he replied Just then a pillow came flying at Jakenfrom the bedroom closely followed by a blanket. 'Great' thought Jake he was beingnkicked out of his bedroom for nothing. It was 3am and Melanie had been tryingnto get to sleep for 4 hours now, she hadn't realized how much she hadngotten used to having Jake lying beside her and now she couldn'tnsleep without him. Melanie crept into the living room to get andrink, she looked over at Jake who she thought was sleeping. Shenwent over to him and knelt down beside him. \"I'm sorry\" she whisperedn\"After what I've put you through lately I don't have any rightnto be mad at you\" she kissed his forehead and then stood up andnwent into the kitchen. Jake who also couldn't sleep, had onlynbeen pretending to sleep and had heard everything Melanie had saidnopened his eyes and said, \"I'm sorry too\" Melanie came back into the living roomnand said, \"I thought you were asleep\" \"I couldn't sleep I guess I gotntoo used to having you next to me that I can't sleep without you\"nsaid Jake sitting up \"I'm sorry I shouldn't have saidnwhat I did this morning\" said Melanie as she sat down next tonJake \"I'm sorry I didn't tell Starnabout us I was just so happy I didn't even think\" \"It's okay I shouldn't be mad atnyou anyway I know you wouldn't do that on purpose\" \"Thanks and you know I would neverncheat on you\" \"I know, now come to bed so we cannboth get some sleep\" Jake and Melanie went into theirnbedroom and tried to get some sleep. About half an hour later Melanienwhispered \"Jake are you awake\" \"Yeah\" he answered \"Inthought you were sleeping\" \"No I can't sleep\" she saidnturning on the lamp \"I forgot I had something to tell you\" \"What\" \"I got my very first pregnancyncraving today\" \"Really what was it\" askednJake excitedly \"It's gonna sound really gross,nbut it was pickles dipped in mayonnaise\" \"Ewwww Mel that is reallyndisgusting\" \"I know but I couldn't help Inwanted it and I ate the whole jar of pickles\" Jake and Melanie sat up all that nightntalking and planning about the future and their baby.[Chapter 8] Telling the Grandparents \"Bye honey, remember I want younback here by 4\" said Melanie as she waved Jake off to work. \"I know I'll be here\" saidnJake as he kissed Melanie goodbye Last night had been their 3 monthnanniversary. Jake had taken Melanie out for a candlelit boat ride onnthe lake. They had sipped orange juice and Jake had eaten chickennwhile Melanie ate pickles and mayonnaise and tomatoes dipped in brownnsugar. They had invited their parents round for dinner that night tontell them about the baby. Melanie had managed to convince Bobby Raynand his mother to cook for them because she wanted everything to benperfect but neither she nor Jake could cook. That day Melanie cleaned the house fromntop to bottom, she picked out clothes for Jake to wear that night andnhad ironed them. When she had finished that she went out and boughtnfresh flowers to sit out, so by the time Jake got home Melanie wasnthinking she might be able to get used to being a domestic housewife. \"Hey honey look at what I didntoday, I cleaned, I ironed clothes for you for tonight and I went andngot flowers\" said Melanie proudly \"Wow impressive you might stillnmake a good little housewife\" said Jake \"I know, now go and have a showernand don't forget to shave and don't mess up the bathroom\" saidnMelanie \"What now? They're not comingnuntil 6\" \"I know but I still haven't had mynshower\" \"Then why don't you go first younalways take much longer than me\" \"Well see I'm not sure I trust younnot to mess up the bathroom, so I guess I'll have to join you in thenshower\" said Melanie as she led Jake into the bathroom. By 6pm Jake and Melanie were bothndressed and ready, waiting for their parents to arrive. \"I'm nervous\" said Melanien\"should we tell them before or after dinner?\" \"It's up to you\" said Jakenputting his arms round Melanie's waist \"Do you think they'll be pleased?\"nshe asked him \"Their first grandchild of coursenthey're gonna be pleased\" Jake reassured her \"I hope so\" replied Melanienas she turned round to hug Jake Just then there was a knock at the doornand then Stella, Jake's mother walked in holding a bottle of wine \"awwww how sweet, you still wannanhug him after putting up with him for 3 months\" said Stella \"Yeah and I'll still wanna hug himnuntil the day I die\" said Melanie pulling away from Jake \"Alright I'm glad to hear it. NownJake go and open this and pour me and Mel a glass\" said Stellanhanding Jake the bottle in her hand. \"Uh no thanks Stella, I have a Uhnmeeting in the morning so I can't be hungover\" said Melanienpolitely \"Go on you can have just onenglass\" insisted Stella \"Okay\" said Melanie \"gonon Jake\" Jake just looked at her and then henmade his way into the kitchen saying over his shoulder, \"Honey can you come and help menfind the corkscrew?\" \"Sure, hold on Stella I'll be backnin a minute\" said Melanie before following Jake into the kitchen \"What the hell are you doing? Younknow you can't drink\" whispered Jake \"I know I won't but pour me anglass and hopefully my mum and dad will arrive before Stella noticesnI'm not drinking and then we can tell them okay\" Melanienwhispered back \"Is something wrong in there?\"nshouted Stella from the other room \"No we'll be out in a minute\"nJake shouted back before whispering to Melanie \"Fine but I don'tnthis one little bit\" \"I know\" said Melanie beforenshe kissed him \"don't worry\" Jake then handed her a half full glassnof wine and they went back into the living room. Jake and Melanientalked to Stella for about 5 minutes, luckily Stella hadn't noticednthat Melanie wasn't drinking. There was a knock at the door and thennMelanie's parents walked in. \"Hey Mommia, Daddy\" saidnMelanie as she got up to hug them both \"Hi Earl, Pearl\" said Jakenwho was quite aware that Pearl didn't really like him, but Earlnthought of him as the son he never had. \"Jake, Melanie, Stella\" saidnPearl \"Hi Mel, Jake I saw that new trucknsitting outside, very nice\" said Earl \"Thanks I'll take you out for anspin after dinner\" said Jake There was a few more minutes of smallntalk then Melanie got up and went over to Jake who put him arm roundnher. \"I'm sure you're all wondering whynyou're here\" said Melanie \"I thought it was to celebratenyour 3 month anniversary\" said Pearl \"You are but there's anothernreason as well\" said Melanie \"We're pregnant\" announcednJake Suddenly there was a lot of noise andneveryone got up to congratulate Jake and Melanie. Then they all hadndinner and spoke excitedly about the baby and the future. Afterndinner Jake took Earl out to see the truck, leaving the women alone. \"So how far along are you\"nPearl asked Melanie \"How long have the two of younknown?\" asked Stella \"I'm 3 months now and we've knownnfor about a month and a half\" \"Oh\" said Stella \"Nownsweetheart I don't want you to think I'm not thrilled cause I am butnare you sure it's Jakes\" \"I thought you would ask that.

They all stayed for another half hour. As Melanie closednthe door after them she turned to Jake and said \"Wow that went really wellnalthough I had tell our mothers about the clinic, Daddy didn't asknanything did he?\" \"No I don't think it even crossednhis mind that it might not be mine\" \"Yeah but it is\" squealednMelanie Jake went to bed that night feelingnhappier than he had ever been, he was with the love of his life andnthey were having a baby.[Chapter 9] Mood swings and cravings Jake had just gotten home from work, henwas completely exhausted Melanie was now 4 and a half months pregnantnand had started to show, had developed an insatiable appetite fornsex and was very prone to mood swings along with her weird foodncravings.

Jake couldn't help butnsmile this was exactly what he wanted, his beautiful wife who henloved more than anything in the world feeding their children andnlooking perfectly natural while doing it. Even though Emily andnOscar weren't their children, he knew that they would have childrennjust like them one day. Just then Melanie noticednJake watching her, \"Hey you're homenthank god, Clinton dropped these two off at 3 and we've got them tilln8, so you better get your beautiful little butt over here and helpnme. \" said Melanie \"Uncle Jake\"nshouted Emily running over to hug Jake \"Hey there\" saidnJake hugging Emily back, \"I hope you've been a good girl fornyour Aunt Mel\" \"Yeah she has they'venboth been absolute angels\" \"We felt your babynkicking Auntie Mel, but she explained that it wasn't the baby hurtingnher it was their way of talking to us\" \"What\" said Jaken\"the baby kicked\" \"yeah\" saidnMelanie happily \"it kicked for the first time about 2 hours ago\" \"Wow\" said Jaken\"I can't believe I missed that\" \"It's okay I'm surenthere will be lots of other of times when you can feel it\" saidnMelanie knowing that Jake was disappointed \"There sure will be,nI hired a manager to look after the warehouse, so I can be here fornyou and the baby\" said Jake, he always called it a warehousenbecause it had been a warehouse when he had bought it but now he hadntransformed it into a successful glass business, they made and soldnglass, they also had a cafe there. \"Really, so you'll benhere all the time\" said Melanie \"Pretty much\"nreplied Jake \"Uh honey I love younbut we'll kill each other if we have to spent every moment together\" \"I know I'll stillnhave to go to work, but hopefully not every day and only for a fewnhours when I do have to go in\" About an hour laternMelanie was relaxing on the porch, she had put Oscar in his pram tonsleep and Clinton and Lirlyn were due back in an hour. She wasnwatching Jake play with Emily, he was so good with children, rightnnow they were playing basketball and Jake was lifting Emily above hisnhead so she could dunk the ball in. Melanie started to think aboutntheir baby and what it would look like, she hoped they had Jake'sngorgeous eyes and his sandy blonde hair, in fact she wanted them tonbe just like him except maybe not as stubborn. An hour later Lirlyn andnClinton came to pick the children up and when they left Jake sat downnnext to Mel and asked \"Why didn't you callnme when the baby kicked?\" \"I couldn't rightnaway I had to explain it to Emily then Oscar needed changing andnfeeding and by the time I could call you I knew you would be on yournway home.

Mel had given birth to a healthynbaby boy 6 weeks earlier and Jake had been by her side for the wholen5 hour labour. They had decided to call the baby James, Jamie fornshort it had seemed like the only name they had both liked that wouldnfit in, in New York and Greenville, they had also decided his middlenname should be Earl after Mel's dad. Jamie had Jake's eyes and hisnsandy blonde hair, he had Mel's nose and smile. Just then Jake saw Jamie open his eyesnand screw up his face to scream, but before he could make a soundnJake lifted him up and whispered, \"Morning little guy, come on letsnlet your mommia sleep\" Jake carried Jamie into the kitchen tonheat up a bottle, while the bottle was heating up Jake changed hisnnappy and then fed him the bottle. As he was doing this Mel cameninto the room, Jake was so wrapped up in feeding Jamie that he didn'tnnotice. Melanie couldn't believe she had come so close to not havingnany of this, she had the only man she had ever loved and ever willnand they had an adorable son together. Melanie shuddered when shenthought of what her life would have been like if she had marriednAndrew, she would probably have been an alcoholic by the time she wasn30. The sight of Jake and their son brought a tear to Melanie's eye. \"Morning\" she said \"Morning. What are you doin up? nWe were gonna go for a walk and let you get some sleep\" \"Oh I guess my mommy clock wentnoff. I was wondering why he wasn't up yet\" \"Alright in that case I'm stillngonna take him for a walk and then you can have a relaxing bath andnjust rest.

I'm opening my first store in New York\" saidnMelanie \"Oh right, well maybe I'll takenhim another day\" said Jake who had finished feeding Jamie andnhad dressed him and was now putting him in his pram. \"Bye have fun\" said Melanie,nshe knew why Jake wouldn't take Jamie out on the plane, he was afraidnthat something would go wrong. Melanie took Jake's advice and have anlong relaxing bath and then she tidied the house and made morenbottles for Jamie. Jake came back with Jamie and then madenhim and Mel some lunch, after they had finished eating he got up andnsaid, \"Right I gotta go bye\" henkissed Melanie \"bye little man\" he said as he picked upnJamie to kiss him as well. \"Bye honey\" said Melanie As soon as Jake had left, Melanie putnJamie into his baby carrier and grabbed the diaper bag. Then shencarried Jamie in his carrier and strapped it into the front passengernseat of the state of the art jeep that Jake had bought Melanie. nMelanie drove to where Jake's business was situated and got out andncarried Jamie into the shop, \"Hey Mel. he's upstairs in thenoffice\" said one of his employees \"Thanks Lucy\" replied Melanienas she made her way upstairs to see Jake She knocked on the office door and thennshe heard Jake shout \"Come in\" Mel went in and saw that Jake was sonenthralled in what he was doing that he hadn't even looked up. \"Hey you've got a visitor\"nMelanie said, then recognizing his wife's voice Jake looked up \"Hey what are you two doing here?\"nhe said getting up and walking towards Mel and Jamie \"Well someone missed their daddy\"nsaid Mel as she handed Jamie to Jake \"awww I missed him too\" \"Jake I'm gonna go out to the carnand take the car seat out and put it into the plane and then I'mngoing home.

She left them to looknaround and then she went over to Jake and surprised him with anpassionate kiss. \"Hey what did I do to deserventhat?\" said Jake \"You're not complaining are you?\" \"No of course not. Where'snJamie?\" \"Asleep in my office. I justnwanted to come and talk to you I know I haven't been around muchnthese past few days, it's just taken a lot more work than I thought\"nsaid Melanie \"I know honey, it's okay I know itntakes a lot of work\" said Jake understandingly \"awww what did I do to deservensuch a sexy, intelligent and understanding husband\" said Mel \"Alright Mel what is it?\"nasked Jake suspiciously \"What, nothing\" said Melninnocently \"Mel\" \"Okay there's a fund raising eventnand my publicist wants us to go she said it will be great publicitynfor the opening\" \"awwwwwwww Mel\" \"Come on Jake please.

She went into hernbedroom to aske Jake to put her necklace on for her. When she walkednin, she saw Jake he looked so adorably sexy, he was wearing a blacknsuit with a white shirt, he wasn't wearing a tie and he hadn't donenthe top few buttons of the shirt. \"Hey, can you help me with thisntie?\" said Jake as he noticed that his wife had entered thenroom. \"You know what I think you lookngreat as you are. Don't wear the tie.\" \"Really? Great I hate wearingnties\" \"I know. Can you put my necklacenon for me?\" asked Mel \"Sure\" said Jake After he had put her necklace on her,nMel turned to Jake and said, \"I uh should probably tell younthat Andrew will be there tonight.\" \"I guessed as much. We'll justnhave to show him that I'm never letting you go again and he'll justnhave to get over it\" said Jake as he wrapped his arms aroundnMelanie. \"I love it when you do that\" \"Do what?\" asked Jake \"Put your arms round me, it makesnme feel safe. Just knowing you're there.\" \"I'm glad because having you in mynarms makes me feel like the luckiest man in the world and I'll alwaysnbe here to protect you\" Just then Pearl called from the livingnroom, \"There's a big fancy limo waitingnoutside for the two of you\" \"Come on we better go\" saidnJake grabbing Melanie's hand When they arrived and got out of thenlimo Jake was shocked at how many reporters knew them and wanted tontake their picture. \"Oh no\" whispered Melanie tonJake \"What\" he whispered back \"Andrew's mother\" Just then Andrew's mother turned roundnand recognised Melanie, \"Well, well what do we have here?\"nshe said[Chapter 13] The Press \"Kate hi\" said Melaniencheerily before whispering to Jake \"Don't leave me\" Jake then sqeezed her hand andnwhispered back \"I won't\" \"Mayor Henning to you\" saidnKate \"Whatever. How are you?\"nsaid Mel \"Just smile for the camera's andnwe'll talk inside you little tramp\" said Kate and then she wentninside \"Miss Carmichael\" shouted anfemale reporter \"Mrs Perry if you don't mind\"nMel replied \"Well is this your husband? Wasnhe the reason you left Andrew Henning at the alter?\" Melanie felt Jake squeeze her hand andnthen put his arm round her shoulder. \"This is my husband, and I have noncomment regarding Andrew Henning\" \"Is it true you have a baby?\"nsaid the reporter \"Yes we have a 2 month old son\" \"What did you call him? Will henbe at your opening on sunday?\" \"His name is James Earl Perry andnyes he will be at the opening\" \"Mr Perry how do you feel knowingnyour wife's ex fiance is inside?\" Jake looked at Melanie before replying, \"I haven't really thought about itnI don't see why I should be bothered my wife and I are very deeply innlove.\" \"Well Mr Perry that is a verynattractive accent, how do you and your wife feel about all younlegions of female admirers?\" \"Well honestly I didn't know I hadnany female admirers\" said Jake blushing \"Oh of course you do and I loventhat I have such a sexy husband\" said Melanie It took Mel and Jake another 20 minutesnto escape from the press. \"Wow\" said Jake as they wentninside \"I didn't know I was so well known\" \"Well of course you are, we werenall over the papers here for months\" They mingled for about half an hournbefore they were asked to take their seats for dinner, they went overnto their table and saw that an attractive brunette was sitting therenalready. \"I guess we must be sharing\"nMelanie murmured to Jake \"Hi\" said the brunette \"Arenwe sharing a table with you two?\" \"Looks like it\" said Jake \"I'm Amelia Cortez and my date isnat the bathroom\" \"Hi I'm\" started Melanienbefore Amelia interrupted her \"I know who you are I love yournclothes and this must be your husband, wow he's even cuter in person\" \"Thanks\" laughed Melanie shenand Jake were now sitting down. \"Oh but things may be slightlynawkward...\" before Amelia could finish her date arrived at thentable \"Andrew\" said Melanie shocked \"Melanie hi and I'm sorry I dontnknow your name\" said Andrew unfazed \"This is Jake\" said Melanie \"Hi Jake sorry I didn't know yournname I really should have found it out after you stole my fiancee onnour wedding day and then when you threatened to throw me out of anwindow\" \"It's okay I guess I should havenintroduced myself after you forced your way into my hotel room andnupset my wife \" said Jake \"Well...\" started Andrew \"Don't come on both of you sitndown, shut up and eat dinne quietly and peacefully\" said Melaniensternly \"Fine I won't stoop to thisnneanderthal's barbaric level\" said Andrew \"Jake sit down\" said Melanienas Jake got to his feet with a dangerous glint in his eye, \"andnAndrew I suggest you shut up or I might let it slip to Ameila aboutnthe little blue pills you take at bedtime\" Jake laughed and Andrew looked as if henhad been slapped. \"Little blue pills\" saidnAmelia looking confused and then she realized \"Oh my god she'sntalking about viagra you're impotent\" The rest of the evening went quitenwell Andrew had obviously told his mother to leave Jake and Melnalone.[Chapter 14] Storming out It was now a few weeks until Jamie'snthird birthday. Melanie had now opened a whole chain of shops, shenhad hired people to run her business all she did now was design andnsent her designs to New York. Jake had opened branches of Deep SouthnGlass in New York, San Francisco, LA and Seattle. Everything inntheir professional lives were going well but Jake and Melanie hadnbeen fighting a lot lately and they were right in the middle of yetnanother argument. \"You're never here, you're eithernat work or at the bar\" shouted Mel \"Well excuse me but I have tonwork\" Jake shouted back \"No you don't you choose to\" \"Yeah I do it gets me away fromnyou and all your nagging\" \"I have to nag because you don'tndo anything. You go out early in the morning and don't come backnuntil late at night and I'm left to clean and cook and look afternyour son. You haven't seen Jamie in 3 days I may as well be a singlenparent\" \"Mommy\" said a small voice Mel and Jake turned round to see Jamienstanding outside his bedroom looking sleepy \"Oh honey did we wake you\"nsaid Melanie softly \"Come on I'll take you back to bed\" shensaid as she scooped him into her arms. Ten minutes later Melanie came out ofnJamie's room and found Jake pacing in the living room lookingnfurious. \"There he's fast asleep,not thatnyou care you probably wish you were at the bar\" said Melanie \"You know what Mel I would, younknow I work hard all day and when I come home all I get is younnagging in my ear so yeah I'm going to the bar don't wait up\"nsaid Jake before storming out. Mel was furious with Jake, she waitednup until 4am for him and then she went to bed. When she woke up thennext morning she saw that Jake's side of the bed hadn't been sleptnin, she assumed that he had slept on the couch. She went into thenliving room expecting to find him sleeping off the beer he had hadnthe night before, but Jake wasn't in the living room. He hadn't comenhome. Mel was worried she knew that they were having problems butnshe didn't think that they were so serious that Jake wouldn't evennbother coming hom. Mel tried to put her worries to thenback of her mind as she got Jamie dressed and dropped him off atnnursery. When she got back hom she saw Jake's truck and thought forna minute that he had come home to beg for forgiveness then she sawnthat the plane had gone. He had gone to work. Mel spent most of that day thinkingnabout her and Jake and she realized that their problems were seriousnand that she needed some space to work out what she wanted. Shenbooked her and Jamie on a flight to New York that left this evening,nshe packed their bag and then went to pick Jamie up from nursery. nWhen she returned home and put their bags in the car, she knew thatnJake was due home any minute, just then she saw him plane, shenwatched it land, and watched Jake get out and tie it up before hencame over. \"Daddy\" shouted Jamie as henran up and hugged Jake \"Hey little guy\" said Jakenhugging his son back \"Jamie go inside and get Marcell\"nsaid Mel. Marcell was Jamie's teddy he couldnt sleep without him. Jamie walked into the house and thennJake turned to Mel \"Look I don't want another fight. nI just needed some space last night. Wait what does he need Marcellnfor?\" \"I agree with you, I think we bothnneed some space so I'm taking Jamie to New York with me\" saidnMel unsure of how Jake would react to this. \"You're leaving me\" said Jakenlooking shattered \"No well not right now, I justnthink he need some time apart to see how we feel and if we shouldnserparate\" \"So you're running away as soon asnthings get a little bit tough again\" said Jake \"What like you did last night\" \"I'm sorry I don't wanna fight. Inlove you both of you\" said Jake \"I know I love you too but thingsncant go on as they are. Don't worry we'll be back in a week\" \"I'm going to miss you both sonmuch\" said Jake emotionally \"I know, now go and say goodbye tonJamie and don't call or follow us I'll call you and tell you whennwe're coming back\" \"Okay\" said Jake numbly as henwent to say goodbye to his son.[Chapter 15] Back Home Mel was sitting on a plane on it's waynto Alabama, she had managed to get an earlier flight than planned,nJamie was asleep in the seat next to her, he looked more and morenlike Jake every day now. Mel had thought that going to New Yorknwould clear her head and she would be able to work out what shenreally wanted, but it had confused her even more. Mel felt like hernlife in Alabama with Jake was becoming to much like her mothers, shenstayed at home all day looked after Jamie, cooked, cleaned. Jakenwent to work all day and when he eventually came home he thought thatnshe had nothing better to do than run around after him before he wentnto the bar, and she couldn't go with him because she hadn't time tonarrange a babysitter. But in New York as soon as she walked into hernoffices there she was immediately the most important person in thenroom and she had people running after her, she had designed 3 outfitsnand had taken Jamie to the park everyday while she was there, but shenhad to admit they had both missed Jake a lot. When the plane landed Melanie hadnmanaged to get their bags and find her car in the airports massivencar park without waking Jamie. When she was in her car Melaniencalled Lirlyn and asked her if she knew where Jake was because shenwanted to surprise him. Lirlyn told her that Jake was at work henwasn't expecting them until tonight. It was only 15 minutes awaynfrom the airport so Melanie decided to go and see Jake right away. Jamie had woken up just as Melanienpulled up, he recognized the place instantly, Melanie told him thatnthey were going to see Jake. Jamie got so excited he adored hisndaddy and he hadn't seen him in a whole week. Melanie lifted him outnof the car and carried him inside they headed straight for Jake'snoffice. Melanie stood outside his office andnshe saw him talking on the phone pacing inside. \"Honey we have to be quiet when wengo in daddy's on the phone okay\" whispered Melanie to Jamie \"Okay\" Jamie whispered back Melanie and Jamie snuck into Jake'snoffice without him noticing he had his back to the door. \"Look just fix it okay I can't benin two places at once\" ranted Jake, then he turned round and sawnhis wife and son \"I'll uh call you back\" \"Can we talk now\" Jamienwhispered to his mother \"Yes\" whispered Melanie back \"Hey little guy come over here andngive your daddy a hug\" Melanie put Jamie down and he ranntowards Jake and hugged him. Jake spent a few minutes with his sonnand then he gave him a toy he had bought for him as a welcome backngift, as Jamie was playing with it Jake let Melanie into thencorridor. \"I thought you weren't coming backnuntil tonight\" he said \"I got an earlier flight at thenlast minute Jamie missed you\" \"I missed him too. I missed bothnof you. What about us?\" \"I dunno I thought that going awaynwould have helped, but it hasn't. Jake we've got some major problemsnand I don't know how to fix them.\" \"Alright so where do we go fromnhere?\" asked Jake not sure if he wanted to know the answer \"Well we're staying at Bobby Ray'snhe's got 2 spare rooms so it makes sense and then we have to see ifnwe want to sort out our problems because I do I really want to sortnthem out.\" said Melanie almost in tears. Jake then took her into his arms andnsaid soothingly \" shhhh it's okay we'll work this out together. nI let you go once I'm not gonna make that same mistake again\" \"Thanks\" said Melanie as shenpulled away from him and wiped her tears from her face, \"I'mngoing to the house to get a few things\" \"Okay but I'll keep Jamie here andnI'll bring him back with me at 4pm\" said Jake, \"I reallynmissed him\" \"4 you don't usually come backnuntil 8\" \"I know but I made my manager fullntime now so I'm mostly in the way here now\" \"Okay I'll see you later\" When Melanie got back to her car shenwondered if she had done the right thing by not telling Jake that shenwas pregnant. She had found out in New York but she didn't want tontell Jake because she wanted them to get back together because theynboth wanted to not just because she was pregnant.[Chapter 16] Mel tells Stella Mel and Jamie had been staying at BobbynRay's for 4 days, Jake had just picked up Jamie he was taking him outnon the plane today. Mel thought she was going to burst shenhad to tell someone about her being pregnant, she still hadn't toldnJake. She and Jake had agreed to go to a marriage counsellor but thenappointment wasn't until next week. Melanie couldn't think of anyonenshe could tell and then it hit her, Stella, she had always toldnMelanie exactly what she thought and Mel knew she could trust her notnto say anything but she wouldn't like keeping it. Melanie was standing outside Stella'snhouse she knocked on the door and after a few seconds Stella came tonthe door. \"Mornin babydoll, where's mynfavourite grandson?\" \"He's with Jake I need to talk tonyou\" \"Sure come on in\" said Stella Melanie went inside and Stella madenthen both coffee. \"He came here the moment you left,nI had to stop him from coming after you\" said Stella \"Really he seemed fine when wenleft he said he understood\" \"He did, he was just terrifiednthat you weren't coming back\" \"I told him I was I couldn't takenJamie from him\" said Melanie \"I know thats what I told him andneventually he calmed down.

Inmiss him so much you know the whole time I was in New York I couldn'tnsleep because I knew Jake wasn't next to me and I knew he wasn't onnthe couch either\" \"Awww thats so sweet but I'mnguessing that this wasn't what you came up here to talk about\" \"Well it is related to it butnbefore I tell you I need you to promise not to tell anyone\" \"Of course\" \"I mean it you can't tell anyonenespecially Jake I mean I will tell him I just can't tell right now\"nbabbled Mel \"Melanie you're rambling I promisenI won't tell anyone even Jake, now please tell me I'm starting tonworry now.\" said Stella \"It's not bad news well I supposenit could be it depends how you look at it\" \"Spit it out\" \"I'm pregnant\" Melanienblurted out \"What that's great news\" saidnStella as she hugged Melanie \"I think so\" \"But wait why can't I say anythingnto Jake, he is the daddy isn't he?\" said Stella \"Yes he is\" said Melanie \"butnyou can't tell him because I want us to sort out our problems and getnback together because he both want to not because I'm pregnant\" \"Oh okay I'll keep quiet but younhave to tell Jake soon it's not fair on him\" \"I know I will. There's one othernthing I need\" \"What is it?\" \"I'm going out with the girlsntonight to the bar and I need you to make sure that none of my drinksnare alcoholic. I'll be drinking Martini's all night\" \"Of course no problem\" \"Thanks Stella I knew I couldncount on you\" Melanie and Stella spent almost all dayntalkin about the baby, Melanie was now quite excited about being anmother again. She was so glad she had told Stella.[Chapter 17] Violence and Jealousy Melanie, Lirlyn and Dorthia all walkedninto the bar dressed up and ready to have a good time. \"Hey I'll get the drinks you gonfind us a table\" said Melanie, \"Hey Stella can I get 2nwhite wines and a dirty martini with 2 olives please?\" \"No you you can have lemonade in anmartini glass with 2 olives\" said Stella quietly \"Thanks\" said Melanie andnthen she saw Jake over by the pool tables with Clinton, Eldon andnBobby Ray. Then a smartly dressed dark haired man came up to the barnto talk to Melanie, \"Hi I'm Craig\" he said \"I'm Melanie\" \"That's a very pretty name for anvery pretty girl\" Melanie giggled at this and then said,n\"What a line I bet you say that to all the girls\" Craig laughed and said, \"Yeah thatnwas a pretty awful line I guess I'm just nervous about talking tonsuch a stunning woman\" \"Well I don't wanna lower yournself confidence but I'm married\" \"Oh well. You're husband is anvery lucky man. Here's my number take it just in case\" saidnCraig as he handed Melanie his business card. Melanie took it and said, \"alrightnbut I seriously doubt I'll need it\" Melanie then took the drinks over tonher and table and sat down and started to talk to Lirlyn and Dorthia.n Melanie didn't realize that Jake had saw her at the bar, he couldn'tnhear what she was saying but he saw her giggle and take some guy'snnumber. Just then a group of girls walked intonthe bar in tight mini skirt and even tighter tops. Melanienrecognized one of them as Star, Jake's ex/ \"Oh look who it is the whorenbrigade\" said Lirlyn loudly A few minutes later Melanie looked overnand saw that Star was all over Jake. \"Would you look at that whore allnover Jake\" said Mel angrily \"Come on\" she said gettingnup and walking over to the pool tables followed by Lirlyn and Dorthia \"Star\" said Melanie raisingnher voice \"Get your slutty hands off of my husbad\" \"Excuse me but I heard y'all hadnsplit up\" said Star \"Temporarily\" \"Not if I've got anything to donwith it\" Jake was enjoying this watching twonwomen fight over him even though he knew Mel would win, he was stillnupset and mad at Mel for flirting with that guy at the bar and takingnhis number. He knew that Star would annoy Melanie that was the onlynreason he was letting her anywhere near him. \"I think that Jake and I wouldnmake an adorable couple especially with his gorgeous little son\"ncontinued Star Melanie snapper when she heard this shenslapper Star across the face and then threw her drink on her. \"Right that's it you bitch\"nsaid Star Before Jake could do anything Star hadnpunched Mel in the stomach so hard that she fell to the ground. \"No\" screamed Stella \"She'snpregnant\" Melanie was just lying on the floorncurled up in pain. \"She's what\" shouted Jake \"Pregnant Jake I'm pregnant\"nmoaned Melanie who was still on the floor doubled over in pain. Jake couldn't speak the bar was inntotal silence until Stella said, \"The ambulance is on it's way\" \"How the hell was I to know thenstupid bitch was pregnant\" said Star Jake turned to her furious and calmlynsaid, \" Star fuck off and if you come near me or my family againnI won't be responsible for my actions\" Then Jake knelt down beside Melanie andntried to calm her, \"shhh honey it'll be okay\" \"Jake if your girlfriend has hurtnmy baby I'll never forgive you and I'll kill her. So leave me alone\" Jake felt as if his insides had beennripped out, he sat on the stool next to where Melanie lay, he feltncompletely helpless. It seemed to take the paramedics forever tonarrive, when they did they put Melanie on a stretcher. Jake andnStella followed her outside Jake was about to get in the back of thenambulance with Mel when she said, \"No I don't want him coming. nStella will you come with me\" Jake felt as if his heart had beennripped out and stood on. Stella looked at Jake and he nodded to her, \"Of course I will\" saidnStella as she got into the ambulance Jake just stood there watching thenambluance drive away with tears running down his face, then BobbynRay's truck drew up beside him. \"Come on Jake get in\" saidnBobby Ray \"No I need to go after her\" \"That's where I'm taking you,nremember you've been drinking\" Jake got into the truck.[Chapter 18] Not Again Jake was silent all the way to thenhospital. When they got there Bobby Ray parked the truck and thennthey both ran into the emergency room. \"Melanie Perry she just came in. nWhere is she?\"Jake asked the receptionist \"And you are\" said thenreceptionist \"I'm her husband\" \"She's in maternity second floor\" Jake didn't bother to wait for thenelevator he flew up the stairs two at a time like a mad man. \"Melanie Perry where is she? Howsnthe baby\" Jake asked the nurse at the front desk. \"We're getting Mrs Perry ready forna scan. I go and see if she wants to see you, em who are you?\" Before Jake could reply he heardnMelanie sob, \"Stella call Jake, I want mynhusband, please this can't be happening again. I need Jake\" As soon as Jake heard this he ran andnburst into her room and he saw her sitting on a bed with her knees upnat her chin sobbing, \"Mel\" \"Jake thank god you're here. I'mnbleeding, they don't know if the baby is alive or not\" sobbednMelanie \"Hey it's okay I'm here now and Inain't gonna let anything happen to you or our baby\" said Jake asnhe went over and put his arm around Mel. \"Wh-what about J-Jamie\" \"Don't worry about him I'll takencare of him\" said Stella \"He-he's at my p-parents and he'snnot got nursery tomorrow b-but if you ask L-louise\" said Melanientrying to stop the tears. \"shhh don't worry about anything\" \"Ma you can pick up Jamie and looknafter him tonight\" \"Yes now I don't want either ofnyou worrying about him just concentrate on this baby\" saidnStella The doctor came in and said that theynwere ready to do the scan, Stella left the room. Jake watched as annimage appeared on the small screen. \"Well Mr and Mrs Perry it's goodnnew both mother and babies are fine, the bleeding must have beenncaused by minor trauma\" \"Oh thank god\" said Jakenrelieved \"It's okay\" said Melanie alsonrelieved and then she added, \"wait babies plural as in more thannone\" \"Yes you did know you were havingntwins\" \"Twins\" said Melanie and Jakenat the same time both of them shocked \"Yes congradualtions Mrs Perry younare three months pregnant with twins\" said the doctor, \"Howevernafter you're fall we'd like to keep you in overnight for observation.n It is entirely optional but I would recommend you stay\" \"Well if everythings alright thennI'd rather go home I have a young son to look after\" saidnMelanie as she sat up and tried to get off the bed, Jake put his armnout and stopped her. \"No she'll stay. Mel what ifnsomething goes wrong, Ma will look after Jamie\" said Jake \"Jake you know I hate hospitals\" \"Well you won't be alone I'll benright here with you all night\" said Jake \"You don't have to\" \"I know I want to now will younjust shut up and let me take care of you\" Melanie smiled at this, that wasnexactly what Jake had said to her not long after she found out thatnshe was pregnant with Jamie, she looked up and saw that Jake wasnsmiling too and she knew that he had said it to cheer her up.[Chapter 19] Talking things through Jake had sent Stella and Bobby Raynhome, he had told them that Melanie was expecting healthy twins. nStella was going to pick Jamie up from Mel's parents in the morning. It was 4am and Mel was lying in hernhospital bed wide awake. Jake was sitting on a chair next to her bednalso wide awake. They had turned the light off 2 hours ago. Melanienthen broke the silence. \"We still have problems thisndoesn't change that\" \"I know but it did change things Inwas petrified tonight, I thought I might lose you and our babies andneven the thought of that broke my heart\" replied Jake \"When I saw Star touching you Infelt as if she had ripped out my heart. I can't blame slapping hernon hormones I've wanted to do it ever since I first met her 4 yearsnago. Do you remember that night how stupid I was but I still wantednto kill her because she had you\" \"I'm sorry about that I was justnso jealous when I saw you talking to that guy at the bar, maybe he'snthe sort of guy you should be with not me\" said Jake miserably \"I told that guy I was married. nWhen are you going to realize that I don't want someone like him ornAndrew? I love you, I always have and I always will. I had your sonnand soon I'll have two more of children\" \"I guess sometimes I still can'tnbelieve that you picked me over Andrew, he could have given youneverything you'd ever wanted\" \"No he couldn;t I've only evernwanted you and that's the one thing he couldn't give me\" \"What are we gonna do? I want younand Jamie to come home.\" \"Jake I don't know. The reason Indidn't tell you I was pregnant was because I wanted us to get backntogether for us not just because I'm pregnant\" \"I was wondering why you didn'tntell me. It will be different I've hired a manager\" \"You did that before and it didn'tnmake a difference\" \"This time it is different I'vengot full time managers in all the branches and then I have a generalnmanager who oversees them all. I won't need to work at all\" \"Jake I don't know\" \"Come on Mel we'll still go toncounselling but we're a family now and I'll be there to help more andnI'm not letting you have any stress for the next 6 months not afternour scare tonight\" \"You better be there I saw Jamienplaying football this morning and the worst possible thing happened. nWhen he threw the ball to Oscar he didn't knock him down\"(A/n -nOscar- Lirlyn's son aged 5 while Jamie is still only 2) Jake gasped in fake horror, \"He'snthrowing like a girl, right thats it he's just been enrolled at JakenPerry's football boot camp\" Melanie was laughing not just at whatnJake said but the serious tone in which he said it. \"Hey what are you laughing at I'mnserious\" \"Thats why I'm laughing\" \"So you're coming home\" saidnJake turning on the light \"Yes\" said Melanie happilyn\"but I still want us to go to counselling\" \"Whatever you want\" said Jakenbefore Mel grabbed him and kissed him intensly \"Well I can see that yourninsatiable appetite for me is earlier with these babies\" saidnJake \"Thats right just wait til I getnyou home Big Boy\" \"Big Boy\" chuckled Jake andnthen he suddenly looked horrified \"Do you think it will be twicenas bad because it's twins because I remember last time I was alwaysnexhausted\" Melanie just laughed \"Wait what about the house?\"nsaid Melanie \"What about it?\" \"Well we don't have much roomnright now and there really isn't space for the babies\" \"Yeah you're right we'll have tonmove\" \"Oh oh we could buy the land outnnear the beach and build out own cutom built house, it can be mynpregnancy project and we decorate Jamie's room with a football theme\" \"That sounds expensive\" \"Come on Jake we can more thannafford it in case you hadn't noticed we're loaded\" \"I know I was only kidding.

Does this mean you're sayingnyes\" \"Yes whatever makes you happy\" Jake and Melanie spent the rest of thennight talking about the babies and their dream house.[Chapter 20] Jamie's third birthday It was Jamies third birthday and he wasnhaving a barbeque party, Melanie was sitting on the porch withnLirlyn. \"Hey Mel can you keep a secret?\" \"Sure what is it?\" \"I've been dying to tell someonenall day.

The childrennwent up first and when they were sitting down eating, the parentsnwent up for food. When Melanie got up to the barbeque. \"What can I get you honey?\"nasked Jake Melanie looked down at the barbeque andnshe went pale, dropped her plate and ran inside. \"Eldon, man the grill\" saidnJake as he handed Eldon the tongs and then ran into the house afternMelanie. When he got into the house he heardnMelanie being sick in the bathroom, he went over and stood in thendoorway, \"If you didn't want my cooking allnyou had to do was say\" said Jake Melanie took her head out of the toiletnand turned to Jake, \"I'm sorry I just looked at thatnmeat and ...\" before Melanie could finish what she was sayingnshe had to put her head back into the toilet and she was sick again. nJake knelt down beside Melanie and he held her hair back and rubbednher back. \"Shhh don't worry about it. Inguess these babies are vegetarians\" Mel was sick a few more times, Jakenstayed with her. \"Alright I think that was it\"nsaid Mel as she got up to wash her face. \"Are you sure I don't want youngoing back out there if you're gonna feel sick again\" \"Yeah you're right I better staynin here until everyone's finished eating I'll get the desserts ready\"nsaid Melanie \"Alright do you want me to staynwith you?\" \"No Jamie will be wondering wherenwe are and you haven't had anything to eat\" \"Okay I'll come and get you whennall the meat is gone\" said Jake as he helped Mel up off thenbathroom floor. Once everyone had finished eating Jakenhelped Melanie bring out all the desserts. After they had done thatnJake went over and put his arm around Melanie as they watchedneveryone get their desserts \"Jake\" whispered Melanie \"Yes\" he whispered back \"Is there anymore jelly in thenhouse?\" \"No I think thats all there is\" \"Oh\" \"Why\" \"I've suddenly just got a cravingnfor a big bowl of jelly\" \"Well Mrs Perry you're wish is myncommand\" said Jake as he made his way over to the jelly bowl \"Jake can I get evaporated milknwith it?\" \"You can have anything you want\" It had started to get late so everyonenwas going home to put the kids to bed. Mel and Jake were sayingngoodbye to everyone when Clinton came up, \"Hey Jake the guys are all goingnto the bar, you coming\" he said Jake looked at Melanie and she said tonhim, \"Go on you've been great today youndeserve some fun\" Jake almost said yes and then henrealized that Mel had done as much as he had that day and henremembered why they had split up. \"Uh no I'm gonna stay here andnclear up\" said Jake \"Wow talk about whipped I guess wenknow who wears the trousers in your house\" teased Eldon \"Yeah whatever I'm happy stayingnat home with my family\" laughed Jake[Chapter 21] Where my Loyalties Lie It was a week after Jamie's party, Melnwoke up and saw Jake lying next to her sound asleep, he had been atnthe bar the night before and Melanie could smell the beer on him. Melanie went into the living and nearlynscreamed when she saw Clinton lying asleep on the couch. Instead ofnscreaming she just smiled and thought about what sort of night theynmust have had and how rough both of them would feel when they wokenup. It had been the first night Jake had been out without her sincenthey had got back together and that was almost a month ago. Melanie got Jamie dressed and made themnboth breakfast and then took him to nursery. When she got back shenhad tidied up and done the dishes before Jake emerged from theirnbedroom. \"Mornin honey you look rough\"nsaid Melanie \"I feel rough\" \"Must have been a good night lastnnight\" \"Yeah I um think it was. I'mnsorry I didn't mean to get that drunk\" \"It's fine just remember that whennthese babies are born you owe me one night of babysitting\" \"All right\" said Jake as henleaned in to kiss Mel \"Uh no, no kisses until you showernyou smell like a brewery.\" Jake laughed and said, \" Alrightnthen but when I get out I want 2 kisses and a bacon sandwich\" \"You'll be lucky\" Jake turned round to go into thenbathroom and then he noticed Clinton on the couch, \"Oh looksnlike I'm not the only one who's gonna feel rough this morning. Heynwhere's the little\" \"Jake it's 12:30 he's at nursery\" Jake went into the bathroom and Melanienstarted to make bacon, the smell of it woke up Clinton, \"Mornin\" said Melanie \"Mornin what time is it?\"nasked Clinton \"12:30\" replied Melanie \"Younhungry you want a bacon sandwich\" \"Mmmm yes please\" saidnClinton sitting up Jake then came out of the bathroomnwashed and wearing fresh clothes. \"There do I get a good morningnkiss now?\" \"Of course you do\" said Melnas she went and handed Jake a plate with his bacon sandwich on it andnthen kissed him. \"Hey I thought the deal was Inshowered and made myself beautiful I'd get two kisses\" \"Just be grateful you're gettingnanything. Clinton you're sandwich is on the counter\" \"See who wears the trouser now\"nJake asked Clinton \"Jake crumbies\" said Melanie Clinton just laughed and said, \"stillnher but what did you expect you married old felony Melanie, but shencan make a good sandwich\" \"Thanks and less of the old\"nlaughed Melanie After they had finished eating Clintonnhad went into the bathroom to get cleaned up, \"So do you wanna tell me why Inwoke up and found Clinton on my couch?\" Melanie asked Jake \"He fell out with the missus\" \"About what?\" \"He said she did something shenpromised she wouldnt, I just tried to keep my nose out\" \"Oh my god he wouldn't\"ngasped Melanie \"Wouldn't what?\" \"Lirlyn told me she was pregnantnbut that it wasn't planned\" \"Oh no he wouldn't\" \"Ask him when he comes out\" A few minutes later Clinton came out ofnthe bathroom and Mel went into the kitchen as she did so she shotnJake a meaningful look. \"Uh Clinton I was talking to Melnand she told me about Lirlyn being pregnant\" said Jaknuncomfortably \"Yeah she dropped that little bombnon me last night\" \"Is that why you crashed here?\" \"Yeah I still can't believe shendid that after she promised she wouldn't\" Melanie who was listening from thenkitchen couldn't take it anymore and she burst into the living room, \"Oh oh I can't listen to thisnanymore she didn't do it on purpose and what sort of a man abandonsnhis kids and pregnant wife\" shouted Mel angrily \"Hey Mel calm down let me dealnwith this go and see your mother or something\" said Jake as henled Melanie outside, \"Fine I'll go and see Lirlyn shenmust be devastated and he better be out of my house by the time I getnhome with Jamie\" Melanie spent the rest of that dayncomforting Lirlyn who was devastated and couldn't stop crying. WhennMelanie left to pick up Jamie, Clinton still hadnt come home. WhennMelanie and Jamie got home they found Jake sitting down by the lake. \"Daddy guess what I did today?\" \"What\" asked Jake \"I learned how to play soccer\" Melanie looked at Jake and she couldntell that something big had happened and that he needed time tonthink. \"Come on Jamie lets go inside andnyou can help me make dinner\" After she had put Jamie to bed Melanienwent outside to talk to Jake[Chapter 22] A/N – I'm so sorrynI know it's been a while I've had this chapter on my computer fornages, but I don't like it, so I'll probably replace, but anywaynhere it is. Most of you will need to reread the last chapter to knownwhat is going on. Melanie went out tontalk to Jake. Sorting out the past \"Hey, aren't youngetting cold\" said Melanie \"No, I've just beennout here thinking,\" said Jake \"About what?\" askednMelanie sitting down next to Jake. \"Everything\" \"I'm sorry Inexploded earlier. What happened with Clinton?\" \"I told him he wasnone of my oldest friends, but that I couldn't believe that he couldnreally leave his family\" \"Alright, then what?\" \"I told him hencouldn't stay here and that he should go home\" \"Did he?\" \"No he said he wasngoing to stay at Bobby Ray's\" \"Oh right\" \"How's Lirlyn?\"nasked Jake. \"Devastated. nPetrified at the thought of being a single working mother of 5\" \"Oh my god. Howncould he do that? I don't know how any man could abandon his kidsnlike that and I can't even begin to imagine how Lirlyn must benfeeling\" \"I know, when I foundnout I was pregnant when Jamie and I were in New York, I was terrifiednat the thought that I might have to do it alone. Even though I knewnthat I wouldn't have been alone, I would have had my parents,nStella and even if we weren't together I knew I'd still have younaround. But Lirlyn doesn't have any family left, she's only gotnus\" \"Don't worry we'llnbe there for her and the kids. I just can't believe how he'snturned out, he works all day, yells at Lirlyn if his dinner is not onnthe table when he gets home and then he goes to the bar every nightnand gets drunk. That could have been me\" \"How do you work thatnone out?\" \"Come on Lirlyn andnClinton were just like us, they got pregnant and married right out ofnhigh school. If you hadn't miscarried, that could have been us,\"nsaid Jake miserably \"Yeah, if I'mnhonest I think it would have. But it's changed now, I no we won'tnlet that happen\" \"I know,\" said Jakenthen he paused, \"Do you ever think about that baby?\" \"Yeah I do, I'llnnever be okay about losing it, but at the time I felt relieved andneven now I think it was for the best, I'm ashamed to admit that butnit's true. They would have been 11 by now\" \"I know I think aboutnthem all the time. At the time I thought that us having a baby wouldnbe an adventure and it did take a long time for me to realize that itnwould have been our only adventure. I still think that the baby wasna blessing even losing it\" \"What?\" saidnMelanie emotionally not understanding at all. \"No, don't get menwrong, it'll never be okay. But if we hadn't gotten pregnant, wenwouldn't have gotten married\" \"Yeah and if I hadn'tnlost it, I wouldn't have left and made something of my life and letnyou grow up\" said Melanie understanding now what he had meant. \"Exactly and becausenwe got married you had to come back for a divorce and then wenwouldn't have gotten back together and have Jamie\" \"Yeah okay if younthink about it that way, it does make it easier,\" said Melanie. \"It's still scarynto think that if we had stayed together, you'd be a housewife,nlooking after a crappy house and 4 or 5 kids. I'd still be workingnat the tyre factory and getting drunk everynight\" \"I know, I try andnnot think about that. We're nothing like that now, we're luckynour time apart made us grow up and realize how we really feel\" saidnMelanie. \"I know. I can'tnimagine being without you or Jamie or not being around for the twins\" \"I know, and I knownyou would never do that. And you should know that I would never takenthe kids from you no matter what happens\" said Melanie as shenhugged Jake. \"Oh\" gaspednMelanie, \"The babies are kicking\" she put Jake's hands on hernstomach. \"Oh my god, I feelnit\" said Jake emotionally \"Right come on insidenbefore you catch a cold. I don't want you worrying anymore, you'rennot Clinton and I'm not Lirlyn. We're gonna grow old togethernand we'll be the only couple still having sex in the nursing homeneveryday\" Jake just laughed andntook Melanie's hand and went inside.[Chapter 23] Chaos \"Jamie, get in here\" Mel shouted out the kitchen window to Jamie who was playing on the porch. \"Mummy\" said Jamie coming into the kitchen \"Uh huh\" said Mel as she put his lunch on the kitchen table. \"Where are all my toys?\" \"I told you sweetie, they're all packed away\" \"Was I bad?\" asked Jamie close to tears. \"No, no of course you weren't\" said Mel bending down to talk to him, \"We had to pack them away in boxes, so that Daddy could put them in the big truck and take them to your new room in the new house\" \"Oh okay\" said Jamie sitting up at the kitchen table, \"can I go in the big truck with Daddy?\" \"I'm sure Daddy will let you\" Jamie sat and ate his lunch then Melanie cleared away his dishes. \"Mummy\" \"Yes\" \"When can I play with my toys again?\" \"We're moving in tomorrow, so I think we could get Daddy to find some for you then\" \"Okay. The new house is for my baby brother or sisters\" \"To make room for them, but you are going to have your own special toy room\" \"When are the baby's coming out of your tummy?\" \"3 months\" said Mel thinking about how big her baby was now and how much like Jake he was, \"C'mere and give your Momma a hug\" Jamie jumped down from his chair and hugged Melanie. \"What's goin on here?\" said Jake standing in the doorway \"Oh we're just having a little chat, weren't we?\" said Melanie \"Uh huh. Daddy, Mummy said I could come in the big truck with you, can I?\" asked Jamie excitedly going over to his father. \"Okay. You wanna come now. I just loaded it,\" said Jake, \"oh and Mel why do you have 16 huge boxes labeled shoes?\" \"Well feet expand during pregnancy so I had to buy more shoes\" said Mel innocently. \"Yeah, whatever honey\" said Jake putting his arm around Mel and kissing his head. Then he picked up Jamie and took him out to the truck. ---------------- A/N - for everyone reading this I just loaded another Sweet Home Alabama Story, it's a fluffy romantic one, you should all definitely read it, it's called 'History Repeating it's self[Chapter 24] Naming the Twins \"Honey,\" said Melanie weakly \"Yeah?\" said Jake looking exhausted. \"When are you bringing Jamie to see the twins?\" she asked. Melanie had given birth to two healthy baby girls earlier that evening. \"First thing tomorrow morning,\" promised Jake. \"Good. He'll love them won't he?\" said Melanie. Even though she was exhausted she knew he wouldn't be able to sleep. \"Of course he will, he has two baby sisters,\" said Jake. \"That are still called, Baby Perry 1 and 2,\" said Melanie. \"Honey, shouldn't you get some sleep, you must be exhausted. We can decide on their names in the morning\" \"I am exhausted but I can't sleep,\" said Mel, \"Come on I want to name them\" \"Alright, alright,\" said Jake knowing he couldn't deny Melanie anything a few hours after she had given birth to their children, \"What were the girl names we liked?\" \"Rachel, Rebecca, Beau, Paige, Claire and Holly\" \"Okay then,\" said Jake looking into the little cribs by Melanie's bed. \"Beau is still my favourite, isn't it so cute for a little girl?\" gushed Melanie. \"Yeah we can name our daughter after my Uncle Bo the alcoholic that killed Cousin Jean with a shovel,\" said Jake sarcastically. \"Fine,\" said Melanie unhappily she really loved that name, \"What do you think we should name them?\" \"Claire\" \"No,\" moaned Melanie, \"They're not Claire, that's a dull, drab name, they are far too pretty for that name\" \"Rachel and Rebecca then,\" said Jake. \"Two R's that is way too cliché,\" insisted Melanie. \"That leaves us with Holly and Paige\" \"She is definitely a Paige,\" said Melanie fondly stroking the cheek of one of the babies. \"Yeah she is,\" said Jake, \"So Holly then?\" \"No, she isn't a Holly\" \"Rachel?\" \"No look at her Jake,\" said Melanie. \"Rebecca seems like such a big name for such a little girl,\" said Jake gently picking up the unnamed baby. \"Yeah, what do you think?\" \"She's make a cute Becca, you know short for Rebecca,\" said Jake. \"Really\" \"Yeah\" \"Well looks like it's Paige and Becca Perry,\" said Melanie happily. \"Yeah,\" said Jake kissing the top of Mel's head, \"Thank you\" \"No problem,\" said Melanie \"I'm in a room with the three prettiest girls in the world,\" said Jake as he gently lay Becca in her crib. \"And you wouldn't be at all biased would you?\" \"I can't help that I have a stunning wife and three gorgeous kids\" \"Wow three kids\" \"I know,\" said Jake, \"how grown up are we?\" \"It's scary I don't feel like a mother of three\" \"You'll get used to it, you're a fantastic mother\" \"Thanks\" ","Summary":" An anniversary and a shock Melanie Perry was in her office arguingnwith her employees in New York.

Much love xxx I do not own The History Boys , or any of the plays, songs or books here mentioned! xD \"So,\" Hector leaned back in his wooden chair, hands folded neatly over his chest. His eyes swept over the eight youths sat before him before dramatically glancing up at the small metal tin residing on a shelf above his head. \"What joyous revels have you lovingly honed for me, mes petits garçons ?\" \"Oh, oh, oh!\" Timms waved a chubby hand in the air in a pantomime of mock-earnestness. \"We've got something for you, sir. There's no way you'll get it,\" he said, with a cunning glint in his eye. He beckoned to James Lockwood, who was rolling his eyes and swearing under his breath, clearly not so earnest to perform. \"That remains to be seen, you arrogant little tart,\" Hector sighed indulgently, waving one regal hand. \"Let's have it, then. Chop chop,\" Timms sprang to his feet and marched confidently to the front of the classroom, followed reluctantly by Lockwood. They stood before the remaining six boys, who displayed varying degrees of interest. Akthar remained buried in a copy of Plato's Republic , while Crowther and Rudge watched intently, grinning in anticipation of Timms' upcoming showcase, which was sure to be comedic. Donald Scripps politely smiled, one eye on Lockwood-but the other on his friend David Posner, who's large, appealing eyes were fixed straight forward, mousy head leaning on his pale little hand, which was supported by his sharp elbow on the desk. Before Posner slouched the carelessly handsome Stuart Dakin, who gazed unfocusedly out of the window. Scripps shook his head, giving a small sigh-poor old Poz, staring wretchedly at the back of Dakin's shiny head of dark hair as if it were the Creation itself, the first sunrise. Scripps recalled the detailed account Dakin had subjected him to that morning; a crude, boastful story of his latest efforts to get into Fiona's pants. He grimaced. Love Dakin as he did, he could be one complacent fuck. Never in Posner's rosy eyes, though. With a pang of pity, Scripps made to jab his friend in the back and offer some whispered word of comfort, but Lockwood had assumed his rehearsed position, peering concernedly at Timms, who had assumed his character, leaning on the piano, one hand clutching his heart. \" I might not be alive in ten years !\" he declared in a falsetto voice, fluttering his eyelashes. In the back row, Rudge and Crowther snorted. \" Yes, but you will be. You'll have children ,\" Lockwood reassured him, a hand on his shoulder, his voice of an equal pitch. But Timms pushed him away, his other hand flying melodramatically to his forehead. \" I can't think about ten years !\" he exclaimed, wailing like a woman. Hector smiled, head tilted to one side, while Crowther chuckled. \" You haven't got the speeds anyway ,\" Lockwood consulted an invisible newspaper. \" So I'll send you to these two, shall I? You haven't been to any other agency? Just so we don't get crossed wires. Now Jeanine I want you to get one of these jobs, alright ?\" He showed the swooning Timms a \"job advert\" sternly. \" If I send you, that means I'm putting myself on the line for you. Your presentation's OK, you look fine, just be confident and go in there convinced that this is the best job for you and you're the best person for the job. If you don't believe it, they won't believe it .\" Timms looked up at Lockwood, eyes wide. \" Do you believe it ?\" he almost begged. Lockwood regarded him kindly. \" I think you could make me believe it if you put your mind to it ,\" Sniffing, Timms gave a small smile. \" Yes, all right .\" He squeezed Lockwood's hand-then burst into boyish laughter as Hector and the other boys began to applaud. He took a theatrical bow, smirking triumphantly at Hector, while Lockwood, glad the farce had ended, looked longingly back at his chair. \"Clueless, sir?\" The old teacher sunk further into his chair, looking excessively satisfied. \"Do you children think I have gotten slow in my old age?\" he pretended to accuse the performers. \"Did you think I would not instantly recognise Caryl Churchill's Top Girls ?\" Timms cried out in dismay, as the rest of the class erupted. Hector chortled. \"We thought it was obscure!\" Timms protested. \"We thought-\" Hector sighed, eyes fixated upon the ceiling. \"Dear lord, send me some boys to teach who are not ignorant little trollops! Now be seated, my children,\" He reached over and whacked the griping Timms lightly with a book, and then Lockwood for good measure as they made their way back to their desks, before addressing the class \"Our revered headmaster, in his omniscience, asks that I evoke a discussion regarding one of the many issues that plague you troubled youths. However, I believe that you are in no need of further education concerning excessive alcohol consumption or, worse still, clear instructions on how to become riddled with sexually transmitted diseases,\" Some of the boys smirked. \"Pray you fill this next half hour with some useful endeavour, and then we shall have music to end,\" Opening his leather-bound weapon, he settled, a contented smile still in place, and began to read. The bulk of the class busied themselves with textbooks, paper and Biros, intending to devote this snatched thirty minutes to revision. Dakin, however, yawned and stretched widely, before slumping down upon his desk and closing his eyes. Scripps tutted, grinning whilst grappling in his bag for a battered copy of Elton's England Under The Tudors. He wondered at how happily Dakin could discard his sleep and, by extension, his education for a shot with the lovely Fiona. \" Poz ?\" he hissed to the smaller boy. \" Poz ?\" Posner reluctantly tore his gaze from Dakin to face him. In his eyes lingered the mists of sadness they always held, especially when in the company of Stuart. Scripps' heart ached for his poor, hopelessly devoted friend, as it often did-and at the same time, he felt a pang of frustration at him, which he repressed in his benevolence. Posner's soft, Pre-Raphaelite features had arranged themselves to show he was listening. \"You still down with doing the one we practised?\" he asked, deciding to grill him later, when not in earshot of their peers. Certainly not in the presence of Hector; though Donald would be sincerely amazed if their receptive teacher had not noticed, considering his obsession with poetry regarding unrequited love, that one of his pupils was openly, embarrassingly, head-over-heels in love with another. Posner blinked for a moment-then understood. \"Y-yes, that would be…fine.\" He glanced at the sheet music just visible in Scripps' bag, eyes still hazy, and not at all eager. \"We could always do a different one,\" Scripps said tactfully. \"I have Get Happy in my folder, I think. You like that one,\" he encouraged him, as if appeasing one of his little sisters. \"No,\" Posner said, resigned. \"I think it would be…therapeutic…to sing the first one,\" \"Alright,\" Scripps offered him a final, friendly smile, before opening his thick, tattered book and beginning to read. \"Come, Maestro, let us bask in the subtle delight of your piano and the full glory of your forte ,\" Hector finally gestured for Scripps to come to the old piano that stood in the corner, with a smile. Hearing Posner stand up near him, he made his way to the stool, setting up the manuscript paper on the familiar wooden stand. He glanced up at his singer, who had stood as usual just behind the corner of the piano, half obscured. \"Okay?\" Posner nodded, pink, cat-like tongue moistening his dry lips. He glanced at Dakin, who had sat up a fraction straighter to hear the music. Posner's Adam's apple rose and fell in his throat. \"So what shall you regale us with today, Messrs Scripps and Posner?\" Hector had removed his glasses and replaced his book, leaning back and relaxing. \"Will it be Jazz, or Folk, or perhaps Musical Theatre -or God forbid it, this so-called Grunge ?\" Scripps snickered, along with most of the other boys. \"Folk, sir. It's quite a pretty piece,\" \"Performed today by a pretty duet,\" Hector offered Scripps the smallest of winks. \"Well, in your own time,\" Trying to brush off the latest and possibly creepiest of Hector's comments, Posner clasped the top of the piano and Scripps positioned his deft fingers on the cold keys, ready to play the opening bars. He counted in with his foot, and then played the short, melancholy introduction before Posner began, a little uncertainly, to sing, his innocent, trembling tenor filling the classroom: \" She's like the swallow that flies so high She's like the river that never runs dry She's like the sunshine on the lee shore I love my love and love is no more ,\" Looking up to check on Posner, Scripps noted as always how his eyes were glazed over as he sang meaningfully, lost in the music-but also thrust into the spotlight in the presence of Dakin. Donald could see why he had been reluctant to sing a song about doomed love. \"' Tis out in the garden this fair maid did go A-picking the beautiful primrose The more she plucked, the more she pulled Until she got her apron full ,\" Scripps chanced a backward glance around the remaining assembled boys; Rudge half-listened, eyes cast down, while Crowther and Lockwood swayed slightly to the haunting melody. Timms was smirking, as he always did at Posner's sincerity when he sang, but Akthar looked serious as he listened. Dakin leaned lazily backward, frowning slightly. He ran one hand through that thick, shiny hair, which Scripps guessed was the reason for Posner's increased feeling as they entered the third verse, grasping the side of the piano. \"' Twas out of those roses she made a bed A stony pillow for her head She laid her down, no words she spoke Until this fair maid's heart did break…\" Scripps did not need to look up to know that Posner would be singing this to Dakin, wondering if David himself was even aware that he was. He sighed quietly, imagining David dying willingly in silent tears, heart shattered by the careless Stuart…before quickly expelling that image from his mind. He shook his head, wondering why he thought such weird thoughts sometimes. He persevered with the intricate piano accompaniment, knowing that Timms would now not be the only one smirking at poor Posner. \" She's like the swallow that flies so high She's like the river that never runs dry She's like the sunshine on the lee shore I love my love and love is no more… \" Posner's final note lingered in the air, finally resonating as Scripps softly intoned the last chord. Hector began the hearty applause, his eyes slightly clouded. \" Most heavenly music! It nips me unto listening, and thick slumber hangs upon mine eyes …\" He allowed himself a quiet moment of contemplation, rubbing his eyes, before charting the classroom for the answer to the question he did not need to ask. \" Pericles , sir,\" Akthar stated loudly, as the bell began to ring, signalling the end of the day. \"Well done, Akthar. And very well done to Posner and Scripps,\" The musicians smiled at their teacher, who continued: \"A beautiful arrangement that is, of a most compelling song. The piano part does not stand merely as an accompaniment to the vocal line; it is a melody in itself, making the song not a solo for a voice, but a duet between singer and pianist. It would have almost been more fitting for young Posner to sit and Scripps to stand up and be seen!\" Posner was slightly put-out as they gathered their books along with the rest of the boys. \"Why doesn't he like me?\" he murmured to Scripps in the rumpus. \"Come on, Poz, he doesn't not like you…\" Scripps began comfortingly. \"You're just too-\" \"Now, who goes home?\" Hector addressed the class as a whole. Each pupil suddenly became far more interested in the contents of their bags. \"Crowther?\" Hector tried. \"Can't, sir,\" Crowther answered, with a smirk. \"Got rehearsals,\" \"Lockwood?\" \"Can't, sir. Going into town,\" \"Ah, Dakin,\" Hector's eyes fixed determinedly on the handsome boy. \"You will come, won't you?\" Dakin rolled his eyes, his back to Hector. \"Okay, sir,\" he sighed. \"Why not,\" \"Excellent, excellent,\" Hector smiled earnestly. \"I shall see you on the forecourt in ten minutes,\" As the teacher exited the classroom, the other boys shot a grateful look at Dakin, who's pleasure at the sudden attention outweighed the distaste for his lift home. \"You are all indebted to me,\" he said, with a look of mock-horror. \"I'm horny as fuck-might get a hard-on because of the vibration, and Hector will cry with joy,\" There was scattered swearing and laughter as Dakin headed for the door. \"Bye, losers.\" Scripps glanced at Posner-who predictably stared breathlessly after him. \"You know, you shouldn't stare so at Dakin,\" Scripps said delicately as he and Posner left the iron school gates amid the throngs of teenage boys in uniform. \"He'll get sick of it eventually,\" Posner shrugged, eyes downcast. \"And?\" \"He might…say something. To you,\" Scripps prompted. \"That you…wouldn't like…\" \"At least then he'd talk to me first,\" Posner sniffed, with the air of a martyr. Scripps sighed. \"I just don't want you to get hurt, mate.\" \"Oh, Scrippsy…\" Posner moaned, eyes misting over again. \"He hurts me simply by being close. And by not being close. I don't know which pain is the more bearable…\" Coughing awkwardly, Scripps tried to formulate a constructive response, before giving up. \"Still don't know what you bloody see in him,\" he said, gruffly, trying to lighten the mood. He thought of the way Dakin boasted about his exploits with Fiona. \"I mean, I love him and all, but he is a massive twat,\" \"That's just the issue. I love him ,\" The boys at school jokingly declared their undying love for one another regularly; indeed, Timms had proposed to Crowther with a Haribo ring just that lunch time. But the way Posner said it, which such reverence, sincerity, devotion…Scripps almost believed him. He nodded understandingly. \"When you love someone…\" he began carefully. \"Their…their flaws only highlight their perfections…make them seem even more perfect than they already were.\" Posner paused, looking up at Scripps with spaniel eyes. \"You're right,\" \"I know…\" Scripps unlocked his bicycle and mounting it. \"I'm always right, O Small One,\" he said, fixing his grin back in place. \"See you, Poz,\" \"Thank you. For everything,\" Scripps looked down at his friend. So pure, so hopeless, so completely beside himself, his wholesome eyes shining with innocence. He thought of David's sweet red heart beneath his school shirt, barely held together by thin threads, thumping with love for Stuart Dakin. \"Take care, mate,\" Scripps rode away quickly, leaving Posner alone.[Chapter 2] Hello again. Thank you so much for reading my fic. I hope you enjoy Chapter Two! Hope you are all well and happy xxx Scripps received the standard ladle of lukewarm baked beans atop his rock-hard baked potato with thanks, to which the hirsute woman behind the counter merely grunted. The canteen, as usual, resembled an animalistic mosh-pit in which pre and post pubescent boys congregated for their midday ration of what was prison food in both appearance and taste. After paying for his lunch, Scripps manoeuvred his tray with dexterity-although the red sea of adolescence tended to part for the older pupils-until he finally reached the rectangular bench in the corner which was occupied by five of his peers. At the head of the table sat Timms, who commandeered the conversation, having captured the full attention of Rudge. The latter boy had balanced a precarious open can of Coke atop a stack of loaned videos from the school library; a selection of Carry On films. Crowther was seated in a hunched position on Timms' left, staring intently at what appeared to be a tattered play script, while Dakin slouched beside him, his feet propped up on the adjoining chair as he consumed the last of his potato. Opposite Dakin sat Posner, straight as an arrow on the edge of the cold metal chair. As Scripps dumped his tray down beside him, he noticed that Posner's tray of food was untouched, baked beans congealing unappealingly on his unbroken potato. \"…it's just the worst,\" Timms was saying as Scripps took his seat. \"The absolute worst thing, in my opinion, that any human being can do,\" \"What?\" Scripps was curious and wary; it was most unlike Timms to be involved in a serious conversation outside of the classroom. \"Bestiality.\" Timms answered disdainfully, shaking his head while contemplating the remains of his grated cheese. Scripps rolled his eyes fondly-he had been expecting something like this. He jabbed his plastic fork into the solid vegetable and finally assembled a mouthful while listening, amused. \"You know what the worst thing about it is?\" Timms continued. \"It's that the dog or whatever has no way of giving its consent. I mean, you could almost see how it would be more acceptable if the dog was down with it, right? But it can't even give a yes or no…\" he finished sadly. \"You don't get talking dogs,\" Rudge agreed wisely. \"I mean, if you had a pet who could say yes to sex-\" \"Isn't that just called a wife?\" Dakin interrupted suddenly. There was a short silence-then Timms and Rudge roared with laughter. Dakin grinned knowingly as Scripps, disgusted by the fact that the corners of his own mouth were twitching, slapped his hands to the sides of his face. \"You,\" he accused, pointing his fork at Dakin. \"are a despicable human being.\" \"But fucking funny,\" Timms spluttered, still chortling. \"Ooooooh, I'm sorry, Pope Scripps ,\" Dakin drawled, raising one thick, dark eyebrow as Rudge wiped his eyes. \"Didn't realise you were in favour of women bishops.\" \"If you continue comparing wives to pets, you are unlikely to ever get one to agree to marry you. And not just because you're fuck ugly,\" Scripps gave Dakin a sick grin. \"Fuck off, Popey. And come on!\" Dakin sat up straight. \"Anyone would have me. Are you going to eat that?\" he suddenly shot at Posner, who jumped a mile. \"No,\" he managed to say, wide eyes falling to the untouched tray which he appeared to have forgotten about. \"Give it here then,\" Dakin took Posner's plate without waiting for an answer and dug in. \"In ten years,\" he said, turning back to Scripps, mouth full. \"when you're in a monastery or whatever, I will be happily married with shitloads of cash and beautiful babies,\" Scripps continued to smile condescendingly back. \"I'll believe it when I see it,\" \"Alright. I'll put it to the test,\" Dakin turned to Crowther. \"Crowther, darling, marry me?\" he said camply, fluttering his eyelashes. \"And we shall have beautiful babies,\" \"Shut up, you prick,\" Crowther didn't look up from his script. \"I'm trying to learn my lines,\" Scripps grinned smugly as Dakin turned to Rudge. \"Rudge, darling, marry me?\" he asked, pouting. \"And we shall have beautiful, slow babies,\" \"No,\" Rudge grunted simply. \"Don't think my bird would be to happy,\" \"Ooh, two rejections!\" Scripps whistled tunelessly. Dakin gave him the finger before turning to Timms. \"Timms, love, marry me?\" he asked, a sneer playing around his full lips. \"And we shall have beautiful chubby babies,\" Timms gasped, pretending to be offended. \"Just for that, no!\" But he turned back to Dakin, a glint in his eye. \"Posner will marry you, though.\" he snickered. Rudge snorted into his sleeve as if at some shared joke with Timms as Dakin looked mildly horrified, though he tried to retain his cool air of indifference. Posner, on the other hand, looked openly appalled, his wide eyes darting between Timms' nastily grinning face and the ceiling. A delicate pink spread to his thin cheeks. Scripps opened his mouth-he wasn't sure what he was going to say, but he would say anything, anything to defend Posner, to save him from this horribly calculated set-up. The smaller boy looked like a china doll-ghostly pale with deep rose cheeks. He looked ready to either run away or die. But before he could speak- Dakin tapped the table with his fork, frowning slightly. Then- \"Aye go on then,\" He fixed his devastating dark eyes on the anxious Posner, to the amazement of Timms. \"Fuck it,\" His voice was emotionless, almost bored, as he drawled: \"Posner, will you marry me?\" Posner gaped at Dakin in disbelief. Half of him looked absolutely mortified. But the other half-the other half looked as if he had been dreaming of this moment his entire life. Not this exact moment-but a moment like it. His eyes shone…A strange sensation gripped Scripps, as if a huge weight was pressing down in his chest and stomach-which suddenly felt bottomless. For the first time in his life-the first time ever -he truly wanted nothing more than to punch Dakin in the face as hard as he could. Reeling with shock and surprise, Scripps yanked himself back to his senses. What was he thinking? And why was he so-so angry ? He was never angry. Never . Especially not at his friends. Dakin was his friend , for goodness sake. Why on Earth was he suddenly furious with him? \"Well…\" Posner finally found his voice, trying hard to stay cool. He gulped. \"Alright then.\" \"Ha!\" Dakin beamed triumphantly at Scripps. \"Told you,\" Scripps said nothing. His hands clasped in his lap. Why did he suddenly feel that his insides had fallen out? \"Come on, Posner doesn't count for this game!\" Timms was clearly both miffed that his joke had back fired and shocked that Dakin had gone through with it. \"I still won,\" Dakin signalled to Posner, who appeared to be in some kind of trance. \"Come on then, wifey, take this back to the kitchen for me, would you?\" He gestured to his crowded tray. \"Don't you bloody dare-\" Scripps began, trying to keep his tone light and jesting-but Posner had already sprang to his feet and was practically skipping towards the racks by the kitchen wherein the boys were supposed to leave used trays after lunch. Dakin stretched lazily. \"There's a good pet.\" \"Awh, look!\" Timms had switched back to his joking persona, smirking. \"He's your little lamb!\" Scripps watched Posner as he scraped Dakin's plates into the provided bin. Although he had his back to them, he could tell his smile was a mile wide. Scripps hated the way Posner basked in scraps of attention from Dakin, as if they mattered more than anything in the world. He would never say so-but he hated the way Dakin treated him. Mostly it was indifference, merely vainly basking in Posner's devotion and admiration-but it was so much worse when he took advantage of it. It made something unpleasant twist in Scripps' stomach. \"What?\" Dakin frowned suddenly at Scripps, bringing him out of his thoughts. Scripps realised he had been staring at him. \"N-nothing,\" he said quickly-then dropped his voice to a murmur so only Dakin could hear. \"You shouldn't… encourage him.\" Dakin's frown deepened. Suddenly, he didn't look quite so handsome. \"Not my problem,\" he said, with an almost defiant air of indifference. Scripps stared hard at him. \"And you shall have beautiful Jewish babies!\" Timms was saying in a falsely sweet voice. \"What's this?\" Suddenly, a bespectacled teacher appeared behind him, wearing a dark suit and an overly keen expression. \"Mr Irwin!\" Suddenly, Dakin sat up, poker-straight. \"On your lunch-break, sir? Did you forget you're not a pupil now? You're supposed to go to the staff room. Careful, you'll get reprimanded for improper school uniform!\" he said, very fast. \"Ha ha, very funny,\" Irwin turned quickly away from Dakin-much to his visible annoyance. \"No, I'm stuck on duty.\" He sat down in Posner's chair and slouched, looking even more like an overgrown schoolboy. Scripps smiled good-naturedly at Irwin; poor guy. He tried so very hard. \"Go to make sure the younger ones don't kill one another. So what's this about Jewish babies?\" the young teacher asked, looking as if he half-dreaded the answer. \"Dakin and Posner got engaged sir. And they shall have Jewish babies.\" Timms informed him, just as Posner himself returned to the table. Mortification swept like a tidal wave over his face again, as Dakin, who had looked irritated at the lack of attention from Irwin, looked eager rather than embarrassed as Irwin turned back to him, looking both surprised an uncertain. \"…Right. Wow.\" He whistled through his teeth as Posner stared hard at the ground, as if trying to find a crack to fall into. \"Er…how long have I been in a coma?\" Dakin chuckled, much too forcedly. \"It was to prove a point, sir.\" \"As good a reason as any,\" Irwin seemed determined to get in on the joke. \"Well, congratulations, Dakin, Posner. Should I buy a hat?\" Posner blanched as Timms and Rudge spluttered with laughter. Scripps gestured to him to sit down, before realising that there was no longer a seat to take. Irwin must have realised this, for he made to stand up-then sat back down firmly, a smirk around his lips. \"Shame on you, Dakin, leaving your fiancé to stand while you sit!\" He gasped theatrically. \"You ought to give up your chair for him.\" Timms and Rudge gasped in astonishment, and even Crowther looked up to see what Dakin would make of this. Scripps made to stand up himself to keep the peace, but Timms locked him into his seat with one strong arm. \"I wanna see this,\" he hissed. Posner himself fidgeted, staring determinedly at the ground. Dakin glowered at Irwin, amazed. He clearly hadn't wanted the joke to extend this far. \"What? Are you fucking- seriously ?\" he stammered in disbelief. \"I have never been more serious.\" Irwin managed to keep a straight face, thought his eyes shone. \"Stand up for Posner, Dakin, or I shall think less of you.\" \"Yes, Dakin, stand up for me,\" Posner said suddenly. He folded his arms and stared down at Dakin, who's mouth hung stupidly half-open. \"It would be terribly rude not too.\" Dakin gawped in amazement as Scripps felt a pang of admiration for Posner. \"Do as your wife says, Dakin!\" Timms nudged Dakin with his foot, now wheezing with mirth. \"Stand up!\" Dakin could see his hands were tied. Shooting an evil glance at Irwin, who watched, amused, and glaring at everyone else, he sluggishly stood up. He walked around to the other side of the chair and stood beside the incredulous Posner, who looked surprised at his own daring. \"Happy?\" he snapped. \"Pull the chair out for him,\" Irwin ordered, supressing a smirk. Dakin muttered several rude words under his breath which demonstrated what exactly he thought of that idea. \"I will not have that sort of language from you in the presence of your wife ,\" Irwin grinned at Posner, who was now looking hopeful, to show he was joking, before looking seriously back at Dakin. \"Pull out the chair for Posner immediately. That is an order.\" Irwin held up a finger as Dakin began to say what Irwin could do with the chair instead. \"You will thank me later in life for this important lesson in manners .\" Colour now tinging Dakin's cheeks, he glared at Irwin before dragging the chair out a reasonable distance from the table, making as much noise as he could on the industrial floor. \"There now. That wasn't so hard, was it,\" Irwin smiled satisfactorily at the apoplectic Dakin. \"Invite him to sit.\" Without bothering to protest, and without looking at Posner, Dakin offered him the chair with a sarcastic sweep of his arm. Posner sat down quickly, looking both scared and triumphant. \"Thank you.\" \"Welcome.\" Dakin grunted. He looked up at Irwin, who gave half-hearted applause. \"Well done, Dakin. A lesson I'm sure your peers will not let you forget,\" \"Oh don't worry, sir. We won't let him forget.\" Timms looked as if Christmas had come early. \"Now, if you will excuse me.\" Irwin rose majestically, still smirking at Dakin. \"Remember-you all owe me your essays on Stalingrad after lunch. I hope they will be less mind-numbingly dull than your previous essays.\" He swept away, leaving Timms, Rudge and Crowther to bully Dakin mercilessly for the rest of lunchtime. Scripps glanced at Posner, who was looking straight forward. There was a wonderment in his eyes, as if he had experienced something magical. \"Okay?\" \"…Yeah.\" Posner smiled at Scripps dreamily. \"I think I'll be alright…\" He continued to stare straight forward, as if gazing at another world. Scripps folded his arms, watching Dakin as Rudge rubbed his knuckles on his head and Timms mimed a blow-job at him. Dakin shoved him away hard, swearing. He kept glancing over in the direction of the staffroom. Scripps looked back to Posner. What on Earth did he see in him? Why Dakin, of every boy Posner knew? Yes, he was handsome-but so was Crowther. So was Lockwood. Why Dakin? Why not anyone else? And why did he have to be in love with anyone at all? Scripps shook his head hard. Stupid, stupid, stupid …He expelled those thoughts from his mind. Looking up at the ceiling, he thought about Jesus. Jesus was protective of his friends, wasn't he? Look how he'd defended Mary Magdalene in the Book of John. It was perfectly natural to feel responsible for Posner, to care about him deeply. There was nothing wrong with that. He was bound to feel older-brotherly toward such a vulnerable, innocent friend. That's all it was, after all. Thank you for reading. Chapter Three soon xxx[Chapter 3] Hello. Thank you so much for reading-I hope you are all well and happy. The next chapter will be posted as soon as I can xxx Still wearing only his father's ancient dressing gown and striped pyjamas, Scripps played the old family piano, taking advantage of the otherwise empty house to play as loudly as he could. The tired instrument was squashed into a corner of the dining room, scratched mahogany wood with off-white keys, some of which were so stiff they had to be pressed very hard to produce a sound. But Scripps was well-used to it by now, and considered these imperfections part of the piano's charm. His bare feet worked the pedals as he played, eyes sweeping back and forth across the sheet music propped up before him; the accompaniment to a song from some musical Posner wanted to sing. Scripps practised the song again and again, until his deft hands almost followed the music themselves. He periodically glanced up at the clock, counting down until he would have to get dressed and collect his little sisters from their ballet class, which ended at midday. As both parents were at work by now, the responsibility had been handed to Scripps, who didn't mind the two-mile round trip to the studio and back. It wasn't a bad walk-and some fresh air would clear his head. While still playing, Scripps calculated how much money was left in his wallet-he would take the girls for ice-cream on the way home. He needed to get out of the house-it was much too quiet. This morning, his thoughts even drowned out the piano, no matter how loudly he played. He heard Posner singing the melody in his head as he played. He envisioned the classroom, Stuart Dakin sprawling over his desk in the corner, Posner's misty eyes fixed upon him… Scripps glanced up at the small wooden cross hung on the wall beside him, fingers pausing mid-bar. They shook slightly. All night, he had lain awake, trying desperately to find a reason for this suddenly resentment of his friend- his friend -Dakin, relating to Posner. Twice he had decided he was merely bored of their ongoing saga. Twice he wondered if this was just an outlet of stress regarding university; the interviews, the exam, the pressure…but nothing could explain it. This wasn't him. Scripps was almost never angry. He didn't understand why he was so upset about something that didn't even concern him. Dakin and Posner were his friends. It just happened that one loved the other. It had been that way for ages. So why now did it bother him so much? He continued to stare at the cross. It was normal to worry about one's friends. It was normal to want to protect them. It was okay to feel angry, as long as he forgave -that's what he had been taught. But how could he overcome this when he couldn't fathom what it was he had to overcome? \"Please.\" Scripps said aloud. His voice was slightly breathy, as he appealed to the cross on the wall. \"Please, Lord…help me find strength…help me find peace…\" Scripps arrived customarily five minutes early. He made his way through the heavy red door and navigated the white corridors and the steep, narrow stairwell until he found the small room in which mothers waited for their children, which had a window so you could see through to the ballet studio. The whole studio smelled of an odd mixture of sweat and perfume. He looked at the action photos of the older students on the walls; long-limbed slender girls in leotards and tights, leaping, stretching, pirouetting. It was such a female environment-Scripps always felt slightly ill at ease. A father was a rare sight, except at the showcases, and the ratio of boys to girls training was tiny. There was but one photograph of an athletically graceful boy in black, his leg held high over his head. Scripps could hear the buzz of female voices behind the door to the waiting room. \"…and my husband says if he sees Felicity's feet bleeding one more time, he won't let Felicity or Georgia carry on dancing!\" Inexplicably, there was a burst of laughter from the other mothers. Scripps started-he was always a little wary of these women. \"Oh look, there goes little Maisie.\" Scripps leaned on the door to listen, hearing his youngest sister's name. \"She is soooo cute! Her little curly hair…\" one of the mothers sighed. Scripps grinned. \"That's her sister over there. Lily?\" There was a buzz of agreement. \"Sisters, yes. Their mother just drops them off and leaves them instead of staying to watch,\" another mother tutted. Scripps frowned-apparently this was not the norm? He was confused. Did they all stay and watch for the whole two and a half hours? Gossiping like witches around a cauldron? \"My husband knows the father from work. Lovely family. Christians. Told me Donald-their eldest-is trying for Oxford-or was it Cambridge?\" There was an impressed murmur-Scripps couldn't help but feel a twinge of pride. \"The lad who picks the girls up?\" \"Yeah, that's him,\" \"Ooooh!\" Another mother suddenly gave a carnal groan. \"So he's clever and gorgeous!\" There were shrill giggles and gasps. Scripps reeled back. \"Caroline! He's young enough to be your son!\" one mother shrieked. \" Grandson ,\" another woman sneered, to more cackling. \"Come on-he's lush ,\" the woman called Caroline was saying. \"I've seen half of you looking at him when he collects the girls!\" There were squeals of denial. \"You are terrible !\" \"Come on, I would,\" Caroline was saying. \"Do you think he had a girlfriend?\" More squeals. \"Why don't you get your Esther to ask one of his sisters?\" one mother said sarcastically. \"Ooooh, imagine my ex-husband's face if I turned up with a sexy toy-boy!\" \"Imagine my husband's !\" \"He'll be here in a minute. He's never late.\" \"Do you think I should invite him to the pub?\" Scripps started at how serious Caroline sounded. He had begun to feel very vulnerable. Thinking about how much it annoyed him when Dakin objectified Fiona, he realised he understood how she must feel. \"If he's old enough to go in a pub,\" More cackles. \"I'm so going to ask him out!\" Caroline sounded like a teenager, giggling away. A small rumpus announced that the class had ended and the ballet students had arrived. Reluctantly, Scripps pushed the door open and entered the room-instantly aware of every mother's head whipping around to look at him. He looked up and smiled as politely as he could, keen to grab his sisters and go. He could hear Caroline twittering across the room. Keen to avoid her, he skirted around the side, trying to blend in until- A five-year-old auburn-haired tornado jetted across the room towards him, wearing a headband and a mile-wide grin. \" Donny !\" \"Hey!\" Scripps matched Maisie's grin, bending down to catch her. He swung her high into the air as he always did as she squeaked in delight, trying not to be very aware of the other mothers watching them. \"How was it?\" he asked, balancing her springy little self in his arms. \"Good.\" She beamed at him, patting his hair, and Scripps felt his worry seep away a little. Suddenly, he felt a small pair of arms grasp him around the legs. He looked down to see a freckly six-year-old face. \"Hey, Lily!\" He bent down to scoop her up in his other arm, just about managing to keep his balance. It wouldn't be long before Lily was too big. \"Good morning?\" \"Yeah.\" Lily was never so enthusiastic about dance. He adjusted them both comfortably onto his hips, then tickled Lily gently until she smiled. Looking down at his little sisters as they gazed up at him like a pair of spaniels, Scripps felt a rush of affection for them. Suddenly-he realised something was missing. \"Why aren't you two changed?\" he asked, realising although both girls had changed into their trainers and wore cardigans, they still had their leotards and tights on underneath, soft ballet shoes in their hands. Both girls looked sheepish. \"Mummy forgot to give us the bag,\" Maisie explained. Scripps suppressed a sigh- typical . Quite often he had to walk back though town with two little girls in ballet clothes in tow-usually carrying their ballet shoes himself. But he fixed a smile back in place. \"Silly Mummy,\" He adopted a teasing tone. \"You two had better not get any ice cream down your leotards, then!\" \" Ice cream ?!\" Scripps was rewarded with two hopeful, gap-toothed grins. \"Come on, then, you two,\" Mentally awarding himself Brother of the Year, he carried his whooping sisters out of the waiting room, shutting the door quickly with his foot to drown out the coos from the mothers. \"Look how sweet he is! He is mine . Mineminemineminemine !\" \"Scripps? Hey, Scripps!\" Scripps spun around, leaving Maisie and Lily to excitedly read what the menu inside the cheerful ice cream parlour had to offer. He scoured the small café for the source of the call-until he spotted Dakin sat on a table near him, opposite a beautiful girl with light brown hair-Fiona. Scripps's stomach lunged-then settled quickly. His hand feeling uncharacteristically heavy, he waved and grinned awkwardly at his classmate, who had stood up to talk to him. Fiona looked somewhat put-out, though she smiled determinedly over the sundae they were sharing. \"Hey!\" Dakin embraced him in a one-armed hug, seemingly in a wonderful mood. He smelt of cologne. \"How are you, you fuck-\" \"Shhh!\" Scripps gestured to his sisters, who would still be in earshot. \"-You bender,\" Dakin opted for, patting him hard upon the back and giving a boyishly handsome smile. Without waiting for an answer, he launched into his next sentence. \"I was going to call you later. Listen, my parents are away for the weekend and explicitly forbade me to have any parties. So boys night at mine tomorrow?\" He grinned mischievously. \"Oh-okay!\" Scripps' smile became more strained. \"That sounds great,\" \"It was going to be tonight, but Rudge has a rugby thing.\" Dakin explained, looking very pleased about something. He leaned over to Scripps and murmured in his ear. \"So tonight, there's a private party in my pants,\" he said roguishly, jerking his head towards Fiona, who smiled obliviously. \"You jammy beggar,\" Scripps tutted good-naturedly, punching him on the arm in a display of normality. Dakin grinned and pulled away, blowing a kiss over to poor Fiona. \"Donny! We've chosen!\" Maisie called. \"Okay!\" Scripps waved to her-and motioned to Dakin that he had to go. \"Stuck babysitting? Sucks to be you,\" Dakin shrugged. \"But you'll be at mine at eight, right? Oh-and bring what booze you can!\" he added as an afterthought. \"I've got my parents drinks store in the cellar, but not sure if it's all fancy wine shit.\" Scripps raised an eyebrow. \"So we get together a tonne of booze that only five of us will drink?\" \"Five?\" Dakin frowned, counting on his fingers. \"Akthar can't…Posner won't…\" \"I can't,\" Scripps smiled at the ground. Dakin gasped theatrically, throwing his hands in the air. \" What ?!\" He threw his hands in the air, unable to get his head around it. \"You don't drink?\" \"Ephesians says.\" Scripps grinned. \"I can have, like, a glass, but I can't get drunk.\" \"You don't have sex, you don't wank, and now you don't get pissed ?\" Dakin patted Scripps' shoulder in a mock display of concern. \"They'd better have a bed ready for you in the bin, mate, seriously.\" Scripps shoved him off. \"It's not that bad. Anyway-I'll bring some, okay?\" Dakin grinned. \"You're the best.\" \"Can't wait for tomorrow!\" Scripps mustered as much enthusiasm as he could. Sitting down, Dakin hesitated for a second before saying: \"Look, do you mind calling Posner and telling him? I don't think his nerves would stand it if I phoned him myself.\" Scripps swallowed hard. He forced a teasing grin. \"Even though you're engaged ?\" he snickered. Dakin gave him the finger. \" Donny !\" Maisie called again. \"Come on!\" \"See you tomorrow, Donny ,\" Dakin drawled, grinning, as Scripps walked off quickly towards his sisters. SPOILER: Party, party, party! xxx[Chapter 4] Hello. Sorry for the delay-hope everyone enjoys. More as soon as I can. Thank you so much for reading and reviewing-it means a lot to me. Hope you're all well and happy. xxx Posner scrutinised himself in the bathroom mirror, discarded shirts lying all around him on the floor. He buttoned up his final choice. Deeming it the most acceptable, and running a hand through his hair yet again, he \"borrowed\" a few drops of his father's cologne stratigically. An untimely spot had already been concealed with a subtle dap of his mother's foundation. It was a shade too dark for his skin, but Posner hoped Dakin's house would have low lighting. Dakin's house. He was going to Stuart Dakin's house. He had barely concealed his elation on the phone to Scipps, and had hardly sat still or eaten all day. He'd never spent so long getting ready, never worried less about the entrance exam in a few weeks. Dakin's house. He wondered if there would be photographs, reminders of past Stuart Dakins he'd never known. Would it be spotlessly tidy, the work of an efficient mother-or would it be a messy male den, intriguing and exciting? Perhaps- \"David?\" called a female voice from downstairs. \"David, dear? Are you alright?\" \"Fine, Mum!\" Posner shouted back, experimenting with the flick of his hair-did it look better to the left or the right? \"Are you sure? You've been in the bathroom for half an hour!\" \"I'm sure that's an exaggeration, Mum!\" \"Where is it you're going again?\" Posner suppressed a sigh. She'd already asked him this question four times. \"To Da-Stuart Dakin's. My-friend-from school. He's having a party.\" \"A party ? When will you-Come down and talk to me properly. I've hardly seen you all day.\" Resigned to his fate, he picked up the armful of shirts and tapped down the stairs to the kitchen. A slightly rounded woman with mouse curly hair beginning to turn silver was up to the top of her marigolds in the soapy sink. When she turned to him, her kind eyes brightened, the lines around them deepening. \"There's my boy,\" Posner perpetually endured this treatment as he kissed her on the cheek. Since his brother and sister, thirteen and ten years his seniors respectively, had left home, he had never ceased to be her baby. \"Come away from the oven, dear, it's still hot,\" she warned him, confirming this. She was in complete denial that he would be leaving in a few months. He had long since stopped reminding her that he was eighteen. Reaching up to smooth his hair, Posner's mother scrutinized him. \"You're looking thin, dear.\" \"You say this every time I have exams.\" Posner said patiently. \"Because whenever you have exams, you forget to eat. It's not good for you, darling.\" She patted his cheek worriedly. \"You need to remember to take care of yourself too. Watch the oven,\" she reminded him as he stepped back subconsciously. \"What time do you want to be at Stuart's?\" \"Eight,\" David let her straighten his shirt collar. \"What sort of party is it? What's that smell coming from you? And what's that on your face?\" She reached towards Posner's strategic foundation. He yanked away as fast as he could. \"It's just a gathering.\" he explained quickly. \"Just the boys in my history class.\" \"Will there be girls there?\" \"No,\" David said truthfully, withstanding the flow of questions. \"Shame,\" Posner spun around at the sound of this new voice. A small, slim man with wisps of grey hair strode into the kitchen, newspaper under his arm and a grin on his face. He wore a black coat, and looked exhausted, but happy to be home. He smiled at his wife and son proudly. \"Dad! You're back early,\" David kissed his father's worn cheek. \"Well, they don't own me at work,\" he said, embracing his son with one arm, then leaning over to kiss his wife. \"What's all this about a party?\" David suppressed a sigh. \"My friend from school is having a-gathering-tonight at his house.\" Posner's father had been removing his coat-but stopped suddenly. \"On a Sunday night?\" \"A school night,\" Posner's mother added. \"What time will you be home?\" David hadn't been looking forward to this. He gestured vaguely in the direction of the hall, where sat his school bag, packed with school uniform and books. \"We're all staying at D-Stuart's, then going to school in the morning from his,\" he rushed, mouth dry. \"That's what you do at parties. He lives really near school so it's-\" Posner's father looked stunned. He folded his arms. \"No. Absolutely not. You're not going to stay up all night, then waste your day in school because you're tired. You can go for the evening, then I'll come and pick you up at-\" Heart quickening, David suddenly felt short of breath. He'd been dreading this. \"But Dad-\" \"No buts. Don't you want to go to Cambridge?\" Posner's father was resolute. David could feel his face falling. He felt slightly panicked. There was no way he was missing out on staying the night at Stuart Dakin's, no way . He couldn't . He looked beseechingly at both parents. \"Oh, come on Sam,\" Posner's mother suddenly chimed in. She was looking at David, head to one side, a sad smile in place. Suddenly, a flicker of hope rose in Posner's chest. \"He's due a bit of fun. It can't all be work, work, work. That's just not fair on him-he works so hard, don't you, darling? He needs to spend time with his friends-they haven't got long left together. Look at him, he's clearly desperate to go.\" She stroked Posner's hair, while giving her husband a look that clearly wasn't worth arguing with. There was one advantage to being his mother's baby. Posner's father looked stunned. But he knew when he was beaten-and wasn't happy about it. He looked at his son as if he was making a massive mistake-but just for once, Posner didn't care. He silently begged his father, who's resolute face slowly crumbled in the face of two opposing parties. \"Oh-fine. Fine . But you're not to drink anything, do you hear me? I know what these lads' parties get like. I don't care what the other boys do-you have to get some sleep and get to school on time tomorrow, okay? That's the deal, David.\" he said seriously. Posner felt like jumping up and down. Feeling as if a huge weight had lifted from his chest, he grinned broadly at both parents. \"I promise I won't drink anything. And I'll get to bed. I promise\" he gabbled. His mother laughed fondly, while his father looked like he already regretted his decision. Posner managed to meet his eye. \"That's my good boy,\" Posner's mother beamed. \"But let me give you a lift there-I don't want you walking around on your own at eight o'clock at night. It's not safe.\" Willing to pay this small price, Posner gave both his parents heartfelt thanks, before almost dancing joyfully back upstairs. Tonight was the night of nights. Dakin's house was smaller than Posner had expected. The living room was almost perfectly square, with red walls and cream leather sofas, covered in blue fluffy cushions which matched the rug under the coffee table on the wooden floor. There was a television and radio in the corner, but no books, apart from a few women's magazines stacked neatly on the surface. On the wall, to Posner's delight, there was a large photograph of a small older girl and a small younger boy, who looked very alike, with a man and a woman. The man could have been Stuart Dakin as he currently was, smiling handsomely at the camera. It was strange thinking of Dakin as being a son and a brother, with a family, the dead spit of his father, that he had been young once-as young as the small, dark-haired boy in the photo. However, there was no space for quiet contemplation. Because the cellar and drinks cabinet had been raided, and Posner's classmates were drinking as if it was going out of fashion. Loud music blared from the radio, boys shouted to one another and roared with laughter, doors banging and glasses clinking. Before Posner on the wooden boards, Timms and Lockwood comically jerked to the music, clutching bottles in their sweaty hands, much to the amusement of Akthar, who although sober had caught the tipsy vibe of the room. Posner had never seen him so free, so uninhibited. He could hear Crowther and Rudge laughing from the hallway outside. As he sat on the sofa, legs tight, hands cupped around a bottle of Coke, he was both unsure how he should behave-and deliriously happy. For, having begun drinking long before the others had arrived, Dakin himself was excitedly strutting about, even more deliciously confident than usual, dancing and chatting to everyone-including Posner. Right on cue, Dakin staggered into the living room, leaving Rudge and Crowther, and grinned around at his friends. \"Is this fucking awesome or what?\" he declared, shooting a hand into the air-which unfortunately was grasping a can of larger, which dripped onto the floor. Either not noticing or not caring, he plonked himself down on the sofa, looking excessively-and lusciously-pleased with himself. His hair had come slightly out of its usual neatness, giving him a wonderfully wild edge. Posner felt his insides compress delightfully as Dakin grinned at him. \" Posner ! Poz, my old friend!\" he beamed, as if having only just seen him. Posner smiled shyly back. He was scarcely able to hide his euphoria at being addressed so affectionately by Dakin-even if he knew in his heart that it was drink-induced. \"Having fun?\" he asked him coyly. \" Fuck yeah !\" Dakin suddenly began to laugh loudly. \"Look at these twats!\" He gestured at Timms, who was now disco dancing like a twelve-year-old girl with Lockwood, who was giggling in a most un-Lockwood-like manner. Posner gave an obliging laugh, keen to please him. He gazed at Dakin, marveling for the thousandth time at how handsome he was. He felt his heart glow warmer suddenly. Suddenly, Dakin noticed his Coke-with apparent horror. \"What the fuck is that?\" he exclaimed, as if Posner was drinking something repulsive. \"Er…I don't really drink,\" he said, cringing at how uncool he sounded. \"Big up!\" Akthar cheered from the floor. \"Not just me!\" \"Not you too!\" Timms staggered over, forth bottle of beer clutched in his hand. \"Where the fuck is Scripps?\" he demanded Dakin, as if he were hiding Scripps from him. \"Coming later,\" Dakin explained, still contemplating Posner's Coke. \"He needed to do something or other-churchy, God-bothering shit, probably... Fuck . Three boring people at my party!\" he declared, suddenly sounding like a child. \"Hey! It is so not boring!\" Akthar protested. \"I'm having great fun-and I'll be able to remind you all of this tomorrow!\" he snickered. \"WELL!\" Timms shouted, making a wild gesture with his arms. \"YOU can be the Three Muska-QUEERS!\" He roared with laughter, actually falling to the floor, clutching Lockwood tightly, who also chuckled wildly. \"GEDDIT!\" Timms chortled. \"Three Muska-QUEERS!\" Posner rolled his eyes at the pathetic joke, fixing a tolerant smile in place. But Dakin was doubled up with laughter-his hand suddenly grasping Posner's shoulder. Posner gasped-suddenly, everything seemed to stop. All he could feel was the warm, exotically unfamiliar weight of Dakin's celestial hand on his shoulder…but it was gone as quickly as it came. \"DOORBELL!\" Dakin yelled, making to get up-then sitting back down. His can seemingly weighed him down, as he giggled. \"Poz-you go, mate. You go-see-who-it-is!\" Reluctantly, Posner stood up, leaving Dakin, and made for the door. The second he was gone-Dakin shot up and grabbed a bottle of vodka from the coffee table. \"DOWN IT, DOWN IT!\" Timms began to chant gleefully, still gripping Lockwood. \"No, no!\" Dakin giggled again, gesturing to Posner's bottle of Coke, left unattended on the floor beside the sofa. He mimed pouring. Timms gasped, and cried out with glee, while Lockwood laughed and Akthar half-protested-but his eyes shone. \"You do it!\" Dakin thrust the bottle at Lockwood. \"I-I think I'll spill it!\" Lockwood eagerly grabbed the vodka, still chuckling tipsily. He carefully poured half of the Coke into one of Timm's empty bottles of beer. Holding the mostly empty bottle in one hand and the vodka in the other, he raised them theatrically. \"Should I do it?\" he announced. Encouraged by the cheering of the three other boys, Lockwood dramatically emptied the vodka into Posner's bottle. The clarity of the vodka was diluted by the brown liquid-enough to hide it reasonably well. But now-the ratio of vodka to coke was high. Very high. Dakin shrieked in delight, looking as if Christmas had come early, while Timms and Akthar clutched each other, giggling hysterically into their sleeves. Triumphantly, Lockwood replaced the bottle-just in time to hear Posner and Scripps' voices in the hall, coming towards them.[Chapter 5] Hello :') Thank you for reading everyone, and your lovely review made my day! You know who you are :') Thank you so much! Hope you enjoy this chapter, and that you are well and happy. I do not own the song used in this chapter :') Thank you xxx \"Arrgghhh!\" Dakin fell to the floor with a crash, dropping his can of Smirnoff which hit the coffee table and spilt onto the rug. He burst into a fit of hysterical laughter, seemingly unhurt and unaware of the small lake of liquid the rug was absorbing. Rolling onto his side and curling up into a foetal position, he continued to howl. \"You-you a-absolute fuckin- !\" Timms roared-then suddenly clapped a hand to his mouth and ran from the room, across the hall, and shut the toilet door behind him. Rudge, Lockwood, and Crowther were a tangle of arms and legs on one sofa as they collapsed with mirth, handing a large bottle, which contained a potentially lethal mixture, around between them, and until that moment Timms. The sixth tape in the player had run out by now, but no one appeared to have noticed in the abyss of noise and commotion. Giggling feverishly, Posner dropped to his knees beside Dakin. \"Y-you alright?\" he squeaked, voice higher-pitched than usual. He giggled again, one hand twisted in his hair. Dakin turned towards him, a dashing grin in place. \"M-marvellous! Never-never-ever better!\" he declared rakishly. \"Help me up, w-wifey, there's a g-good pet,\" He regally offered a hand to Posner, who took it eagerly, giggling even more as he stood up. He attempted to yank Dakin to his feet-but overbalanced-and both fell down in a giggling heap. Scripps marvelled at the display in front of him, one hand clutching a plastic cup of beer and the other involuntarily gripping his forehead. The whole house smelled like a brewery, and Dakin's latest alcoholic addition to the floor was not the first. The sound of Timms vomiting tainted the air, just audible above the vulgar laughter. The last time Scripps had checked the clock, it was almost two in the morning. As Posner failed for the second time to pick up the uncharacteristically clumsy Dakin, Scripps sighed and got to his feet. \"Come on,\" He bent down and pulled Dakin up, sitting him firmly down on the sofa. \"You, my friend, need some water,\" \"N-no I don't! I am absolutely-\" Dakin jabbed Scripps in the chest. \"-not drunk-\" He jabbed him again. \"-at all.\" He collapsed backwards on the sofa, head lolling disjointedly to one side as he laughed. Scripps turned away from him to look at Posner, who had got unsteadily to his feet. He frowned. Posner had been drinking Coke all evening. That could not account for his increasingly wild behaviour-how-? Suspicion gripped him. As Posner plonked down next to Dakin, still giggling like a schoolgirl, Scripps crossed the room to where Posner's Coke bottle sat on the windowsill. \"You know what, Poz?\" Dakin was saying, voice wobbling slightly. \"You're actually alright.\" \"T-thank you!\" Posner beamed, speaking much more loudly than his usual gentle tone. \"Y-you're alright too!\" \"Yeah, you're alright. I thought-I thought you were really weird …but you're actually—quite-cool.\" Dakin was informing him. \"You and I need to go for a drink some time. Like, seriously, mate. You, me, pub. We'll hit the pub some time, yeah? I-I'll take you-down the pub …and teach you about-about big boy stuff, yeah?\" Posner giggled hysterically as Scripps picked up the bottle. It was empty, save a few drops at the bottom of light brown liquid. Removing the cap, Scripps downed the last few drops-and recoiled. \"This is, like, ninety-per-cent vodka!\" he exclaimed. \"HA!\" Dakin's head shot up. \"THAT'S SO-SO-SO-SO FUNNY!\" \"No, it's not v-vodka!\" Posner struggled to his feet and crossed the room to Scripps. \"It's coke !\" He snatched the bottle and waved the label in Scripps' face, so loud, so unlike himself. \"Silly old Scrippsy!\" he simpered, patting his arm. \"IT'S COKE, POZ!\" Dakin yelled. \"I P-P-PROMISE IT'S-\" He broke off with laughter, as Lockwood too sniggered in the background. Scripps swung around and marched up to Dakin. \"You spiked his drink, didn't you?\" Dakin threw his hands in the air. \" Oooooh !\" he mocked. \" Sherlock !\" \"Seriously not cool!\" Scripps gestured to Posner, who had collapsed back onto the sofa next to them, staring dreamily into space. \"Look at him! I don't know how he didn't notice-!\" \"Come on, Scrippsy!\" Lockwood called over, taking a swig from the communal bottle. \"It's just a joke-it was only one bottle! D-don't be boring !\" \"But look!\" Scripps tried to keep his voice level. \"He's never drank anything strong before-and he probably hasn't eaten-look at him!\" Posner had curled up, head resting on Dakin's shoulder, mouth slightly open, an impish grin on his face. Amazingly, Dakin did not pull away. \"Leave him alone, Saint Scripps !\" he said, suddenly sounding irritated and a lot more sober. \"You're not his fucking mother . Relax a bit!\" Scripps relented and sat down, hating himself. He should have been looking out for Posner-of course the boy would drink anything Dakin gave him, unquestioningly. How could he not have noticed him become like this? The drunken Posner snuggled into Dakin's shoulder, singing quietly to himself. Scripps could hear faint strains in a poor, scratchy version of his usual pure voice: \" Ask me how do I feel, ask me now while we're cozy and clinging… Well, sir, all I can say is if I were a bell I'd be ringing !\" Scripps bit his lip. Dakin's smug smile as Posner lolled on him made his stomach twist…but he shouted at himself in his head . Stupid, stupid, stupid…just relax, Donald. They're happy, and you should be pleased. Supressing a yawn, he turned away from Dakin. Akthar had already gone to bed in Dakin's sister Laura's room. He envied him…but he couldn't leave Posner. Resigned to his fate, Scripps sprang back up and put on a new tape at random, to much drunken cheering. He gritted his teeth and smiled. Half past four. The house was finally quiet, apart from snores and the ticking of clocks. It was peaceful, as only the calm after the storm could be. Crowther snored on one sofa, while Posner had fallen asleep on the other, in the warm patch Dakin had finally been persuaded to vacate by Scripps and Lockwood, who had claimed Laura's other bed beside Akthar, while Scripps had just re-entered the living room to find Rudge yawning widely, cross-legged on the floor. \"Did he go quietly?\" he whispered. Scripps shook his head. \"We could only get him as far as his parents' room, so we stuck him in there.\" \"Did you manage to get him dressed?\" Rudge seemed to have sobered up considerably quickly. Scripps shook his head again, half-smiling. \"He's still in his pants. Bloody hell...had to half-carry him to the bed. Weighs a tonne. The things I do for Jesus…\" Rudge covered his mouth to muffle the laughter suddenly. \"Have you seen Timms?\" \"No. Where is he?\" \"Bath.\" Rudge said simply. Scripps spluttered. \"What? Asleep?\" \"No, building a fucking rocket. Yeah, I covered him in a towel. Fucking mess-sick all down his shirt. Thought about turning the water on to clean him up a bit. Scripps laughed. \"Some night, huh?\" Rudge grinned. \"Great night, yeah.\" Scripps lied, staring at the rug where Dakin's Smirnoff had stained. Rudge glanced at the clock, counting. \"In four hours, we'll be-\" He yawned again. \"-in Irwin's class.\" \"Don't say that!\" Scripps caught the yawn. \"We both need to get our heads down for a bit…\" \"Right, yeah. I wanted to talk to you about that.\" Rudge folded his arms. \"I was going to go up to Dakin's room, but he's got a double bed and it seemed an arsehole move to have it to myself while you had nowhere. I'm not really keen on sharing with you, you see. No offence!\" He held up his hands. \"Not you personally. But…you know what I mean.\" Scripps nodded, slightly amused. \"Well…with all your Jesus stuff I figured sharing's sort of your thing…so I wondered whether you'd take Posner upstairs and share Dakin's bed, and I'll take the sofa. Okay?\" Rudge looked a little desperate-so comically so that Scripps laughed and agreed without thinking. He approached the sofa on which Posner slept. Posner had spent the rest of the night making the most of the opportunity to cling to Dakin. He lay on the sofa, looking so peaceful, curled up, his fingers softly folded over his hands, expression more free of anxiety than Scripps had ever seen it. The thought of waking him from such a happy place made Scripps' heart ache. \"Go on then,\" Rudge was clearly keen to sleep. \"See you in the morning.\" Softly, gently, Scripps folded his arms protectively around the sleeping Posner and lifted him up. He was so small, so light; Scripps could feel his bones under the delicately pale skin as he held him in a bridal carry, resting his head on his chest. The feel of him in his arms made Scripps involuntarily quiver suddenly, his breath sharply leaving his lungs. Shaking his head slightly to expel the inexplicable feeling he slowly, carefully, made his way out of the living room and towards the stairs. Posner did not awaken, though he moaned slightly in his sleep as they began to climb, like a kitten yawning. Pictures of Dakin and his sister Laura covered the wall of the staircase, at various ages. There was a recent one of Dakin near the top, on some cliff overlooking a sea coast. He wore sunglasses and was staring into the distance, looking like a film star. Scripps opened the first door-to find the mostly-naked Dakin spread-eagled on a double bed, foot hanging over the edge. Closing the door with difficulty, taking care not to disturb Posner in his arms, he tried the second-and found a bathroom, wherein, as promised, Timms snored loudly in the bath, covered in vomit and a towel. Suppressing a laugh for Posner's sake, he closed that and tried the next. It revealed a girls' room, with purple and white twin beds occupied respectively by the sleeping Akthar, and Lockwood, who lay with his eyes open, staring at the ceiling. Scripps nodded at him, and then shut the door. Finally, he edged open the last door with his foot. Beyond was a small box bedroom, painted white, a double bed with union jack sheets crammed inside. There was not much room for anything alongside except a small wardrobe and a desk, which was invisible under a layer of textbooks, paper, history books and folders. A poster of Carrie Fisher in her metal bikini graced the wall, alongside another of Veronica Lake posing in black and white, and a further picture of Marilyn Monroe in a white swimsuit just above the bed. So gently, as if handling the crown jewels, Scripps set Posner down on the bed, head resting on the soft pillow. He sat down on the bed beside him, suddenly not a bit tired. Four forty five, according to the fish-shaped clock on the wall, remnant of a much younger Dakin. Hugging his knees to his chest, he looked down at Posner. The curtains were still open, which cast a ray of late moonlight onto his peaceful face. He looked so much more like himself than when he had been giggling and holding onto Dakin. He looked more whole. Scripps watched him sleep for a while, thinking. In the hours they spent alone together around the piano, Posner would come out of his carefully maintained shell. He'd laugh properly, make jokes, smile freely, sing without restraints. But the moment Dakin was in the equation…it was like he shrank . Whenever he was with Dakin, he seemed like only half a person. A shadow of the real David, whom Scripps felt lucky enough to catch glimpses of whenever they were alone together, playing music or just talking. Or even now, when Posner was fast asleep, long eyelashes spread like folded wings in the silence, punctuated only by his gentle breathing… Suddenly, Scripps felt an invisible power take possession of his body, feeling himself somehow pulled with an overwhelming, almost sacred force towards Posner. It was stronger than anything he'd ever felt in his life…irresistible, compelling, an imperative… Scripps felt something in his heart shift, like a gear stick, opening…and whatever was released was warm, like liquid sun and stars spreading over his whole body. Involuntarily, he gave a gasp, like a wounded puppy. He stared at Posner. So empty…and suddenly so full. Full of… David. David . It was David. Scripps suddenly felt illuminated, his whole body shining, warm and deliriously happy. He gazed in wonder at the boy who lay so close to him, as if hardly daring to believe he existed, that his mass gently indented the soft mattress and pillow, that he breathed mildly, rising and falling, that if Scripps tore his eyes away for a second, he would disappear. Scripps realised he had been in denial for months. David . All along…everything he felt towards Dakin… Scripps pushed Dakin firmly out of his head as he breathed shallowly, fighting not to make a sound, not to wake the sleeping angel. All that mattered was right here, right now. Scripps couldn't feel the bed beneath him, the walls around him, the ceiling above him. He existed outside of time and space, outside of reality, rationality, even humanity. And the reason was David Posner. Without meaning to, Scripps' hand reached out and gently, so softly, stroked David's angelic cheek, fingers brushing his blessed, delicate hair. Touching him was electricity. Scripps pulled away as quickly as he had felt him. But his hand felt different, changed. David . How could he have been so blind? Everything was suddenly so clear . Defined. Glistening, like newly discovered treasure. Head reeling, he stared out of the window at the suddenly beautiful smoggy night sky. \"Thank you, Lord!\" he whispered, his face stretching into a smile wider than he had ever smiled in his life. And it was all because of David Posner. He felt like laughing and crying at the same time, wanting to both whoop out loud and curl up in silent elation. Scripps looked back down at Posner, who slept on. Feeling as if he could never sleep again, he almost fell down beside him, propping himself up on one elbow on the pillow as his head whirled, trying to process this miracle. He gazed at David Posner, beguiled, mesmerised- shocked at how he had never seen this before. What was right in front of him all this time. David .[Chapter 6] Hey everyone. Sorry for the wait. I hope you're all well, and thank you so much for reading. Next chapter soon xxx The eight boys who sluggishly dragged their reluctant feet into school the next morning certainly did not look like Oxbridge material. Timms looked faintly green as he trudged along, while Lockwood and Crowther were mumbling experimental excuses to one another for forgotten books. Rudge looked reasonably well, though his stubble was unchecked, and he kept running a hand over his chin self-consciously. Meanwhile, Akthar bounced happily along, speaking loudly into everyone's ears, which rung with white noise. \"YOU ALRIGHT THERE, LOCKWOOD?\" he shouted, grinning gleefully. \"LATE NIGHT, HEY?\" \"Fuck off.\" Lockwood muttered venomously, rubbing his forehead. He turned to Scripps, who was rifling through his bag, rather more frantically than was necessary. \"You alright, Scripps? You look like a fucking panda.\" Scripps offered him a tight smile, then swiftly put his head back inside his bag. He felt his sleepless night physically-but it hardly bothered him mentally. Those few last, precious hours had gone far too quickly. Eternity could not have been long enough. He had felt reborn-renewed, like the tightest chains in the world had unbuckled around his chest, setting him free. It was as if he had been asleep for the longest time, and was only just waking up. Longing all night to gather him in his arms again, to feel him as close as he could be…but resisting. His presence was enough. Lying, in the silence, perfectly still…happy. So happy. So clear. Until David-Scripps could not bring himself to call him Posner-had woken up, like a perfect kitten, butterfly eyelashes fluttering, looking up confusedly at the ceiling, those eyes Scripps had not stopped thinking about finding his own-it had been the final piece of the jigsaw…Only then, David realised that he was in Dakin 's room. That he had slept in Dakin 's bed. Scripps had barely thought on where they were. They could have been anywhere in the world and Scripps wouldn't have given it a second thought. But when David comprehended that he had spent the night in Dakin's bed, seemed to disappear somewhere else… It was like a knife to the gut. To have watched him sleep for hours, to have carried him up the stairs, feeling the weight of him in his arms, to have silently vowed to take care of him, to make sure nothing bad ever happened to him again…but for Dakin to have still been the only thought in David's mind when he woke…Scripps felt as if he had been kicked, punched, thrown at a wall. But he had never shown it. Not for a second. Not after poor David had sat up, confused, wondering what had happened last night. He'd gently explained what had come about, and brought him a big glass of water. He'd offered careful advice when David panicked about what his parents would say if they found out. He'd waited patiently while David, moving slowly, seemingly disorientated, stared all around Dakin's room as if he'd just gained access to an undiscovered treasure trove. He'd smiled. Just the same. Finally, he left David to gather himself and get dressed while he looked after the other boys, helping Timms out of the bath, making tea and toast constantly while the others tried to piece last night together. He'd knocked on Dakin's parents' bedroom door, as the beast had not stirred despite all the morning activity, only to be sworn at croakily by the boy who was clearly suffering greatly with his hangover. He took care of everyone. He couldn't do enough for them. Making sure everyone was okay the entire time…so he didn't have to face his own mind. \"AWESOME NIGHT, DAKIN!\" Akthar yelled smugly in Dakin's ear. \"DID YOU ENJOY IT, POZ?\" he called, snickering. \"You fuck off, you twat.\" Dakin snapped at him. His hair was far from immaculate, and he looked exhausted, head down for once as he walked-and talked to Posner. The two had been conversing for the entire twenty-minute walk to school from Dakin's. David moved slowly-but his eyes were shining. No sleeplessness, no headache, could steal this moment from him. Scripps drew a breath in quickly, finally zipping shut his bag as they approached Mr Irwin's classroom. Regretfully, his ears tuned into Dakin's voice. \"…Akthar told me we have to go for a drink now. Apparently.\" \"Oh!\" Posner squeaked. \"Really? I don't remember that.\" \"Neither do I. But apparently we arranged to go for coffee on Saturday morning.\" Dakin sounded resolute, putting the finger up at a smug Akthar. Scripps frowned. What was he doing ? \"Saturday?!\" Posner's face had evidently fallen, although Scripps had his back to them. \"I don't know why I'd have said that. It's Shabbat-my parents likes us to be together. They will be hard to get around…\" Dakin sniffed. \"Come on, one week?\" He sounded genuinely annoyed-Scripps was sure he wasn't used to being rejected. \"How long does it go on for? Can't you say we're studying or something?\" Posner he thought hard, looking harassed. \"Look, I might be able to slip away for an hour…I'll try…I don't know though…\" \"Come on, Poz!\" Dakin treated him to his most charming smoulder-with a secret backward glance at Akthar, who was laughing behind his hand. Scripps suddenly got the feeling that this was a dare. He blushed on David's behalf. \"Erm…I'll try! As long as I'm there in the morning…and in the afternoon and evening…It's not like we're that orthodox…\" Posner licked his lips nervously, keen to hide his eagerness. \"As long as they don't find out that some monkey spiked my drink last night!\" He laughed too enthusiastically. \"Whatever.\" Dakin was glancing again at Akthar, who was miming a blow-job behind him. \"Just be there, alright? Eleven? Just for, like, an hour.\" \"Okay!\" Posner gave him a bright smile-which made Scripps' heart ache-just as Irwin's door flew open in front of them to reveal the thin, nervous young teacher-and Mr Hector. \" Bonjour, mes enfants .\" Mr Hector was picking up his briefcase, looking slightly harassed. \"Never fear-I'm leaving you in the capable hands of Mr Irwin. No interfering from me and my…ah- gobbets .\" The sickly smile could not hide the undertone of bother. Irwin had raised an eyebrow. \" Morning .\" He grinned knowingly as the boys tiredly piled into the classroom. \"Good one, was it?\" \"It was alright, sir!\" Dakin suddenly piped up, trying to look brighter. Scripps wondered if he was even aware of the hand combing through his hair. \"Would have been better if I could remember a bloody thing,\" Promptly, as if to prove his point, he tripped over the chair leg. \"Ah, \"I say the gentleman had drunk himself out of his five senses.\" Hector smiled, reminiscing . Dakin grinned hopefully at Irwin, suddenly no more than a desperate puppy in a dog's home. But Irwin merely gave him a weak smile and gestured for him to be seated. Scripps plonked himself down miserably at the front. Saturday…Saturday…Posner would be in a café, being used by Dakin to win a bet, his heart racing, like he had made Scripps' race last night…the other boys quietly laughing at him…and Scripps would be collecting his sisters from ballet class. He couldn't know. Even if he did…what would he do? Scripps felt as if he was pushing against a great weight, keeping all of this bottled up inside him, supressing everything, letting nothing show. He couldn't. He had to hold his tongue. David loved Dakin. There was nothing he could do about it. He knew that. He couldn't compare to Dakin. There was no point trying. Dakin was like Adonis… He could only play the piano to David's song which was meant for Dakin...Scripps shook his head violently, trying to concentrate on what Irwin was saying and nothing more. But, all the time, he felt David's heavenly presence, so close to him…but lightyears away. His jaw tightened. It was alright. Scripps couldn't expect anything more. Just having David close should be enough. Knowing, even though the intention was not so, how happy Dakin made him, should suffice. Scripps could never hold David in the way he had longed to, could never be to David all he wanted to be, could never…It didn't matter that he finally could see clearly. Knowing why he felt as he did about David had only made it worse. He had preferred confusion, blissful ignorance. At least then it didn't hurt so much-so deeply. David loved Dakin. His heart was Dakin's spaniel. And now Scripps' was David's. He had become poor, unrequited David. Just as devoted, just as hopeless, just as utterly besotted. Suddenly-he understood. To have this person so close, so near, so present…and yet be unable to make them realize how much you cared, how you didn't even matter anymore... It was just him. Just Donald Scripps. There was nothing he could do. Nothing. Nothing would change. Nothing.[Chapter 7] Hello everyone. I'm so sorry for not updating-I was sort of taking my A levels :') Thank you so much for sticking with me- I will be more regualr again now. I hope you enjoy this chapter. Big love xxx Regardless of the bright sun, the late morning was cold and crisp, the wind strong and unrelenting. It bit at the back of Scripps' neck as he dragged his feet through the streets towards the ballet studio in town. He turned up his collar, then re-folded his arms across his chest, wishing he'd put on a coat, despite of the season. Having spent the entire week biting his lip, he now licked them periodically for warmth, feeling them becoming dry. Dakin's mood had altered on a daily basis this week, which had a knock-on effect upon the rest of the boys. When Dakin was content, there were smiles and jokes. But when his handsome face clouded over and became cold, the communal temper ran and there was stony quietness. Even Scripps found it difficult to maintain his front of cheerful indifference. It was incredibly tiring. This was always the way; Dakin being the nucleus of the group. The only boy who's mood had remained consistent was David-who acted at all times as if crossing a tightrope when Dakin was around. Scripps watched hopelessly as he laughed too eagerly at Dakin's jokes, or when his lips quivered as Dakin summoned silent storms. Still-wherever possibly, David never left Dakin's side. Scripps knew he was being pathetic. He hated being part of this horrible love-web within the classroom; watching David as David watched Dakin. It was so pitiful. A consistent cold war, an immovable stalemate in which every player was steadfast but knew they each fought a helpless cause. Scripps knew in his mind that it was unhealthy-he ought to focus all his attention on his studies-this was his future , and besides, all this caused him was agony. But as he lay awake every night, unable to keep David out of his thoughts…it was fruitless trying to suppress this. It was so natural . To stop would be akin to removing a limb. To feel for David so much… There was the rub. He couldn't even name what he felt for him. Dakin is your friend. You have been friends for seven years. He will always be your friend. Your friend and nothing more. As long as he's in your life, nothing else matters. It doesn't matter that he will never feel anything for you. It doesn't . Although Scripps told himself this almost hourly…it barely helped. Finally, he arrived at the ballet studio, lips pushed together, arms crossed tightly across his front. Suddenly, he caught sight of himself in the glass doors. He looked so tense. Taking several deep breaths, Scripps tried to re-apply his mask-he couldn't let any of this show in front of his sisters. Lily and Maisie had both acted strangely around him this week-he knew they could sense that something was wrong with him. Maisie was as wild, energetic and loud as usual, but patted his knee in her funny way more often than usual, and never made a fuss at bedtime. Lily was even quieter than normal, staring at him quizzically with her big, curious eyes as if trying to figure him out. She had such old eyes for six, and sometimes he wondered if she knew far more than she let on. He hated putting them on edge-it was like watching David pussyfooting around the turbulent Dakin. Shaking his head firmly, he marched through the corridors towards the studio in which the girls were taught. He thought of David, trying so desperately hard to please Dakin. He imagined them right at that moment fulfilling whatever Akthar's coffee bet had entailed. He hoped Dakin would be in a good mood so David was at least comfortable. Scripps bit his lip-he hated to think of David being the butt of so many jokes. He envisioned him-having fought so hard to get away from his parents on the Sabbath-hanging onto Dakin's every word, perfectly silent, eyes wide and round, so pure … Scripps was not a jealous being, but he would have traded his perfect A levels in a heartbeat to have David look at him just once as he looked at Dakin… But all thoughts of David-or anything else-were suddenly rudely ejected from his mind as he entered the waiting room to find the gaggle of mothers as well as two dance teachers all crowded something in the middle of the room. The noise was deafening-they all spoke at once with varying degrees of worry and panic. The Something they gathered around was sat in a further dance teacher's lap-just visible on the floor through the legs of the women and their daughters in ballet clothes-and it was crying bitterly, tears streaming down her freckled face, mouth open as she wailed in agony. \" Lily !\" Scripps charged forward, cold fingers suddenly closing around his heart. Heads snapped up as the crowd parted to allow him to run to his little sister. He crouched down beside her, heart racing. The dance teacher who held her had one hand around her shaking shoulders and the other supporting her left arm. Lily turned to face Scripps-but winced in pain as she did. She opened her mouth to speak, but nothing came out but another heart-wrenching cry of agony. \"What's happened?\" Scripps asked urgently. Instinctively, he went to hold his sister, to comfort her in any way he could-but as soon as he touched her shoulder, she cried out again. \"Shhh, shhh, it's okay, sweetie.\" The dance teacher was a slender, thirty-year-old woman with a sugar-mouse voice. She looked up at Scripps, who was scarcely aware of everyone else in the room watching avidly. \"This is your brother, isn't it, Lily?\" Lily nodded, going to reach out for Scripps again, but she was in too much pain. She stared desperately at him with watery eyes. Scripps tried hard to keep calm, touching a hand to her forehead, which was scarlet and boiling hot. \"What's happened to her?\" he asked again. \"She's hurt her arm,\" the dance teacher said-then dropped her voice so Lily couldn't hear. \"We think it might be fractured. She fell hard on it. We were on our way to my car to take her down to the hospital-my assistant was just going to call your home.\" Scripps tried to process all this, hand still on Lily's head, trying to comfort her as best he could. He couldn't believe it-how could this have happened to his sister? Seeing her in this much pain was more than he could handle. \" Donny !\" Maisie suddenly appeared, running out of the studio and flinging herself into his arms. Her cheeks were also tear-tracked, eyes wide. \"What's happening?\" \"Maisie.\" He cuddled her in his other arm, still gently smoothing Lily's damp hair, scarcely able to look at her little face, all screwed up and magenta. \"Did you see Lily fall?\" he put to Maisie, who nodded, tears cascading down her own cheeks. Scripps held her close. \"It's okay. Everything's going to be okay.\" Unsure who he was really talking to, he took another deep breath and looked back at the dance teacher. \"Where is your car?\" \"Just across the street.\" The dance teacher had clearly dealt with these kinds of injuries before. \"Lily? Lily, sweetheart, do you think you can walk with me and your brother to the car?\" Lily said nothing, but her face contorted in pain. It made Scripps' heart break. He couldn't comprehend this-his little sister, being taken to hospital, in agony… Another dance teacher had returned, holding a small sling. The teacher holding Lily took it from her and so gently secured it into place, supporting Lily's arm. She whimpered as it moved, more tears streaming down her face and dripping onto her lap. \"It's alright, Lily,\" the teacher explained softly. \"It's just to hold you all steady until you get fixed, okay?\" Waving the watching crowd away with a graceful but definite hand, she began to stand up, gently guiding Lily by her good shoulder. Lily whined in protest like an injured puppy. \"Come on, sweetheart. You're being ever so brave,\" the teacher coaxed her. Lily said nothing, but , gritting her teeth resolutely, she held out her good arm to Scripps. Without having to be asked, Scripps bent down to support her, helping the teacher move her gently to her feet. She was boiling hot and damp, and she cried out a few times-but eventually she stood straight. Scripps opened his mouth to congratulate her-but nothing came out. He found his own eyes prickling with tears of shock. Fighting them back for the girl's sake, he forced a comforting smile at Maisie, who was gripping his other arm like a vice, whimpering herself, as if Scripps would break himself if she let go for a moment. \"Good girl,\" the teacher said to Lily, whose tear-tracks shined on her freckled cheeks. \"Right, we'll go slowly, okay?\" She turned to Scripps. \"Is there anyone to look after Maisie?\" \"No,\" Scripps said, swallowing hard to try and make his voice sound less thick. \"She'll have to come too.\" \"Right.\" The teacher let go of Lily, who clutched Scripps harder like a life support, and opened the door for them. At snail's pace, Scripps and his sisters made it through the corridors as one body, towards the entrance. The teacher, who introduced herself to Scripps as Lauren, chatted as brightly as she could the whole way, to try and keep Maisie and Lily calm. Lily's sobs echoed, each one like a stab wound to Scripps. Although he knew there was nothing he could have done, he couldn't help feeling guilty. He'd never broken a bone in his life; it was torture watching his sister suffering. He wished he could change places with her, take her pain away and bear it himself instead. \"You're being so brave, Lil,\" he choked, cuddling her as best he could without moving her sling. \"Much braver than me!\" Lily managed a little smile through her tears-then winced as her arm jarred with the step she took. \"It hurts!\" \"It's going to be okay,\" he promised her, while squeezing Maisie's hand tight so she knew this applied to her too. She was being so quiet and good, despite her shock, looking worriedly at her sister. \"Mummy…\" Lily spluttered. \"I'll call her the minute we get to the hospital, and she'll come as soon as she can. You're stuck with me until then, old girl.\" Scripps gave her a weak smile. \"It's okay,\" Lily leaned her head into him, gulping hard. \"I'm glad I'm stuck with you. You'll look after me.\" Scripps almost burst into tears himself. \"Scripps! Scripps !\" Scripps whipped around at the sound of his name-and pounding feet. He was helping Lily into the front of the car, negotiating her sling with the seatbelt. She emitted only dry sobs now-as if she'd run out of tears to cry. But as he turned around, Maisie still grasping his arm-miraculously, David Posner had appeared, his skinny frame running towards him at full pelt, a large satchel stuffed with books banging off his thigh. Despite everything, his heart did a rapid backflip. Jogging behind David, holding a disposable coffee cup and looking utterly put-out, was Dakin. \" Scripps !\" David skidded to a halt. \"What's going on?\" \"Poz?\" Scripps found his voice as Dakin stopped beside him, panting. He gazed at David. It was as if he'd dropped right out of the sky. \"It's my sister. She-she's hurt her arm,\" he rushed. David gasped, as Dakin swore under his breath. Lily looked up, her wet eyelashes sticking piteously together. Scripps noticed David's eyes widen as he looked down at her, then again as he took in her arm. \"Is it- broken ?\" he mouthed. Scripps swallowed, hard. \"Maybe.\" He still felt shaken himself. David clearly noticed this, as he sighed sympathetically. \"Do you need help?\" A flood of warmth filled Scripps. He said nothing-but David looked into his eyes, and nodded understandingly. \"We'll come with you,\" Dakin coughed slightly. Scripps started-he'd almost forgotten he was there. \" We ?\" He looked as if he would rather be anywhere but here. Unlike David, he seemed slightly repelled by the girls' crying. \"Scripps needs help,\" David said firmly, crouching down beside Lily and clicking her seatbelt carefully into place with a comforting smile at her. He looked up at Scripps, seeming even more angelic than before. \"Come on, you've helped me enough times. Time I returned the favour.\" Scripps felt his insides condense into a pleasantly warm liquid, a heavenly contrast from his panic…but he would not let it overwhelm him as he bent down to his sister beside David. \"Can you both look after Maisie for me? She's a bit-\" No sooner had Scripps made this request had Maisie finally released Scripps and ran-straight to Dakin. She threw her little arms around his legs, burying her face into the side of his jeans. \"Arrghh!\" Dakin recoiled, not quite pulling away but looking suddenly scared and clueless. Clearly, children were firmly out of his comfort zone. The corners of Scripps' mouth twitched, despite everything, as Dakin looked wildly from Scripps to David. \"Why is she hugging me?\" \"Sorry. I just told her you were taking care of her. She makes friends, erm, quickly .\" Scripps shared a look with David, who was amused. Maisie gripped onto Dakin, refusing to let go. She always behaved like this when she was scared. \"Look, do you really need me too?\" Dakin was protesting, frozen as if Maisie was an excitable puppy. \"I'm sure-\" \"Oh!\" Lauren appeared from where she had been loading items from the car into the boot to make more room. \"Who are these?\" \"They're my friends.\" Scripps explained. \"D-Stuart and David are going to take care of Maisie.\" Dakin rolled his eyes, looking furious-he was trapped now. He looked incredulously at Maisie, who clung to him like a vice. \"Oh-well, lucky they showed up when they did!\" Lauren turned to Lily as Scripps stood up. \"Look, I'm sorry to ask, but can you walk her to the hospital? There are only four seats in the car, and I need to be with Lily.\" His tone was grateful and apologetic. \"I'll meet you-\" \"No problem.\" David cut in, smiling re-assuringly at Scripps. \"We'll look after Maisie-you take care of Lily. Don't worry.\" Dakin was still tutting as he tried to quietly prize Maisie off him. David shook his head at him. \"Don't worry,\" he said again. \"We'll be fine.\" \"Donny!\" Lily called out, voice cracking. It was like gravity to Scripps. Quickly, he bent down to Maisie. \"You be a good girl, okay? Stuart and David will look after you. I'll see you soon.\" Maisie whimpered, pulling her face away from Dakin's thigh. \"Lily…?\" \"Lily will be just fine. We're looking after her,\" \"Mummy?\" \"Mummy will be on her way soon. I'll meet you at the hospital, okay?\" He dropped a kiss on her forehead, beginning to back away to Lily. \"Right-you be safe now-hold David's hand across the road-be good-\" Maisie nodded, grabbing David's hand to prove she would be. David looked quietly touched. \"Come on then, Maisie,\" His voice was softer than usual, adopting a comforting tone. \"We'll be okay, won't we?\" \"Thank you so much!\" Scripps rushed, shooting an indebted look at David, before hurrying back to the car, trying to collect his mind-which threatened to spill right out of his head.[Chapter 8] Hello, everyone. I hope you enjoy this chapter-thank you so much for reading. And a special mention to you (you know who you are) for your lovely review-I feel very honoured. Thank you so much for your kindness, and best wishes :') Hope everyone is well and happy, and I will update very soon! xxx Posner watched as the car drove away, disappearing around the corner. He took in a long breath, feeling slightly disorientated as he considered the sharp turn this day had taken. Just a minute ago, he was finishing his coffee in a mostly-empty café, sat across from Dakin…and now he stood on the pavement outside a dance studio, holding the tiny, sweaty hand of a little girl with auburn hair in a leotard. Scripps' sister sniffled, tear tracks shining on her freckled cheeks as she looked up questioningly at Posner. He suddenly felt horribly responsible. \"We'd better get going,\" he said to Dakin, who was staring vacantly at the sky. \"I don't want Scripps to worry.\" Dakin grunted, still looking at neither Posner nor the little girl who stood between them. Suddenly, he set off at an alarming rate down the street, with the air of a man unjustly put upon. Posner scurried after him, holding Maisie's hand, distinctly aware that her legs were far too short to keep up. \"Dakin!\" he called. \"Do you-could you-?\" His voice caught in his throat. \"Would you mind slowing down? She can't-\" Dakin let out a short, sharp sigh, so venomous that Posner started. He stopped abruptly and turned on his heel to face his entourage. His eyes were cold and accusing, as if this was all Posner's fault. He stared at him for a moment, as Posner began to feel vaguely sick. But quickly, Dakin set off again, his pace reduced a fraction. Maisie let out a small sob as she hurried along, making Posner feel even worse. Why was Dakin behaving like this? \"I'm sorry, Maisie,\" he said to her. \"I know you're upset. But we have to get you back to your brother, okay?\" Maisie nodded, gulping hard. \"Okay,\" Her voice was high-pitched, the faintest of baby lisps still present as she cried. She gripped his hand firmly. Posner could faintly remember his need to cling to an adult when frightened as a child. With an unpleasant sensation in his stomach, he realised he had become that adult. Feeling old, he looked desperately after Dakin, who was speeding up again. \"Dakin!\" Posner called, desperate. \" Dakin !\" Dakin stopped dead and whipped around. \"What?\" he snapped, frustrated. \"Can you stop bleating my name?\" Posner felt the ice in his tone like a spear to the chest. He was surprised-and hurt. \"Maisie can't keep up,\" he explained pathetically. Dakin looked at Posner as though he was to blame. \"Carry her then,\" he retorted, marching off once again without any further comment. Posner's mouth fell open. Dakin had begun to be short with him towards the end of their meeting this morning. It had been as if he was eager to get away. Posner hadn't thought much of it at the time…come to think of it, he had hardly thought at all this morning… Maisie looked up at him quizzically. She let out a hiccough. \"Come on, then.\" He bent down and lifted her up, trying to disperse her weight neatly as he balanced her on his hip. She was small and light, but he knew she would not remain so as they covered the distance to A and E. He was also terrified of dropping her. The last thing Scripps needed was another injured sister. Nevertheless, he persevered, and increased his pace to almost catch up with Dakin. Maisie seemed more relaxed in his arms-she was clearly used to being carried. He could easily imagine that Scripps' sisters had him wrapped around their fingers-he could never refuse anyone anything, least of all two cute little girls. He talked fondly about his sisters at school-it was clear they meant the world to him. No wonder he was so cut up when Lily was hurt. And no wonder they both plainly adored him. Posner wondered what his childhood would have been like if he had been this close to his older siblings. Whenever he was with them even now they generally still behaved as if he was a sticky toddler, keeping to themselves and talking down to him. When he was five, Lily's age, his sister had been perpetually absent from the house, involved in countless clubs and teams, and his brother was in exactly the same position Posner was in now-three As in his pocket and desperate to be accepted into Cambridge…He didn't make the cut. Posner hurried along, holding Maisie carefully. The back of Dakin's shiny head was just in front of him, in touching distance. Posner had imagined so many times what that luscious darkness felt like beneath his fingers… \"Dakin?\" He tried again. \"Dakin, are you okay?\" \"Will you bloody stop?\" Dakin didn't bother to turn around. \"It's really annoying.\" \"I'm sorry.\" Posner backed up quickly. \"…But-\" \"Fuck this.\" Dakin stopped dead in his tracks once again, so Posner almost crashed into him. \"Dak-\" he began, appalled at his language in front of Maisie. But the dark-haired boy didn't seem to care. His eyes looked straight past Posner, nonchalantly into the distance. Posner realised with a start that this was how he always addressed him. \"You don't need me. You can get Maisie to Scripps and-the sister-whatever the other one's name is-at the hospital by yourself. I'm going home.\" With a sigh, he began to walk straight ahead in the other direction. \"See you at school.\" Posner felt as if Dakin had pulled a rug from beneath him. \"What?\" \"See you at school, I said.\" Dakin repeated louder, again not turning around. Suddenly, Posner blurted out, his voice unnaturally high-pitched: \"At school. Yeah, school . Where you and Akthar and whoever else is involved will give you whatever they said they would to go for a coffee with me!\" Stopping, Dakin whipped around. The corners of his mouth were twitching. \"What did you say?\" His amusement filled Posner with a sort of heat. It spurred him on. \"You don't think I don't know what they all think of me? You don't think I don't realise that you all laugh at me? Treat me like a joke ?\" Dakin looked mildly shocked, but let out a bubble of laugher, looking at Posner as if he was a child having a stupid tantrum. \"Steady on, there.\" he chuckled. Maisie made a noise, and wriggled nervously in his arms. He patted her shoulder to re-assure her, as anger filled him at Dakin's reaction. \"I'm just a joke to you all. An oblivious baby with a stupid, infantile crush ,\" Dakin's eyes widened in mock-amazement. \" What ?\" His voice was high, condescending. He bent his knees, hands theatrically resting on his thighs. \"You have a crush ? On me ? I'd never have guessed!\" He roared with laughter, eyes shining. \"No one's ever told me! Couldn't have made it a tad more obvious , could you?\" Posner felt his cheeks burning-even, to his annoyance, tears prickling behind his eyes. He felt as if someone had punctured his heart, and it was bleeding, slowly covering his insides with a horrible, hot liquid. \"Go then.\" His voice was quiet. \"Go.\" \"Right-o.\" Still sniggering, and looking pitifully at Posner, he sauntered away. That horrible, boiling liquid surged through him as he watched the boy he had loved so devotedly leave, without a thought, without a care, without feeling . \"But Scripps would have helped you!\" he shouted pathetically, as if this was his last breath. \"He would have helped you!\" \"Whatever.\" Dakin swaggered off, shaking his head. Posner was left, holding onto Maisie, breathing hard and fast.[Chapter 9] Hello everyone. Hope you enjoy the new chapter and that you are all well and happy. Thank you for reading xxx \"…The x-ray confirmed that Lily has fractured her scaphoid bone,\" the young nurse was explaining. \"It's not severe, so she just needs a cast.\" With a warm smile at Lily, she added. \"Don't worry, it's just like a big thick bandage.\" Scripps relaxed slightly. He and Lily had been taken to a white side room after the x-ray, where they had waited for about twenty minutes before being visited by this friendly-faced blonde nurse who had given Lily painkillers half an hour before. Lily herself sat on his lap, holding her arm close to her chest, head leaning on his shoulder. She had stopped crying by now, but hadn't spoken much. \"Thank you.\" Scripps' voice sounded odd in the small, echo-y room. \"This has been remarkably quick.\" \"It's unusually quiet. You couldn't have picked a better day to break your wrist, pet!\" The nurse laughed softly, and Lily managed a weak smile. She was exhausted from all the excitement. \"I'll be back to plaster you up soon.\" She stood up to leave. \"You'll need to come back in about two weeks so we can give you a new cast, then you'll need to keep that on for another four weeks until you're all healed.\" Lily nodded, looking as if she didn't quite understand. \"Thank you.\" Scripps said again. \"It's not a problem.\" The nurse treated Scripps to her warmest smile. \"Just my job.\" After she had gone, Scripps sighed, leaning back slightly. He squeezed Lily's good hand. \"Broken wrist, hey, old girl? That's a turn-up.\" He made his tone as bright as he could. Lily wriggled slightly. \"It doesn't hurt so much now. Just sort of uncomfortable. It looks weird,\" she added. Scripps once again took in her wrist, which was red, bruised and strange. He shook his head-it was still difficult to take in. \"Only six weeks, and you'll be as good as new.\" \"Will I have to go to ballet still?\" Scripps laughed. \"No, no! You can definitely take a holiday.\" Lily looked pleased. \"Good.\" She looked at the clock on the wall, which ticked far too loudly. \"Where is Mummy?\" \"On her way from work, now.\" Scripps promised this with some reservation-it would be at least another hour before she would arrive. They might even be at home by then. \"Where is Maisie?\" Lily asked. Relieved he had not had to answer the previous question, Scripps replied quickly that Stuart and David were bringing her. \"They might even be here now, waiting.\" Lily nodded, satisfied. \"Good…Stuart?\" \"The tall, dark-haired one.\" \"David?\" \"The small, light-haired one.\" Lily giggled. \"Maisie?\" \"The little bouncy one.\" Lily laughed louder. She was enjoying this new game. \"Lily?\" \"The little annoying one.\" Scripps grinned as her mouth fell open. \"No, I'm kidding, sis. You're the little brave one.\" \"Okay.\" Lily seemed brighter. \"Donny?\" She nudged him gently with her good elbow. \"Erm…\" Scripps struggled. \"Well, that's just me.\" He shrugged. \"You're the brother one.\" Lily informed him. \"The brother one?\" \"Yeah.\" Scripps chuckled. \"Okay. I am the brother one.\" Lily fell quiet once again. She leaned into his shoulder as if she might sleep. Scripps always marvelled at how easily small children slept. No lying awake for hours, mind racing with worries and issues, unable to switch off. Just peace. Like David at Dakin's party… stupid, stupid, stupid. He felt disgustingly selfish, thinking about his own ridiculous problems when his little sister had a bone broken…but as Lily's eyes fluttered open and shut, he couldn't help it. Feeling terrible, he allowed himself to think about David, the weight of him in his arms that night, his presence behind him as he played the piano, his singing voice, the way he spoke, how those lips formed words...He liked to watch the small movements David made, the rise and fall of his chest as he breathed, his pale, slim fingers holding a pen, the visible shoulder blade when he raised his hand in class… He knew he was only torturing himself. It was ludicrous, time-consuming and fruitless. His David was with his Dakin right at this moment. He hoped they had got to the hospital by now, and that Maisie was okay. He would have liked to look for them, to have both girls safely with him, but he couldn't leave Lily. However, he trusted David completely. With a guilty surge for enlisting their help so suddenly, he hoped Dakin wasn't giving David a hard time. \" Lily !\" A high-pitched screech greeted Scripps as he and Lily emerged into the hallway filled with chairs outside A and E, where they had initially waited to be seen. Lily now sported a thick, solid cast which reached from her knuckles to just below her elbow. Scripps couldn't fathom why the cast had to be so long since it was only a bone in her wrist that was broken, but the plaster had been covered in a sort of white gauze and the whole thing was secured in a large white sling. It dwarfed Lily, but she seemed much brighter now. She kept tapping the hard cast, fascinated. Scripps spotted the source of the scream towards the end of the corridor. Maisie was scrambling off David's lap to greet her sister. She shot up the hallway, and cuddled Lily as best she could. \"What is that ?\" she squeaked, pointing at the cast. Scripps looked up to see David slowly coming towards them. Though he smiled, it did not reach his eyes. \"I broke my wrist.\" Lily was telling her sister, with a slight note of pride in her voice. For once, she was enjoying the attention. \"Look, knock on it!\" \"Won't that hurt?\" Maisie looked at it worriedly. \"No-feel it!\" Lily took Maisie's hand and touched it to the plaster. Maisie's eyes widened in surprise. \"I thought it looked soft!\" While the girls talked, Scripps watched David approaching. He greeted him warmly. \"Thank you so much for bringing her.\" \"It's not a problem.\" David's smile was fixed in place, but his eyes were dull as old gold. Scripps looked behind him curiously. \"Where is Dakin?\" David shook his head once-before quickly turning to the girls, bending down slightly. \"How is your arm, Lily?\" Scripps frowned as Lily, suddenly not her usual, shy self, began chatting to David. Where had Dakin gone? And why was David so…lifeless? \"What happened?\" David shook his head again, listening to Lily. Or under the pretence of doing so. Scripps didn't give up. \"Look, where did he go?\" \"Home.\" David said monosyllabically, standing upright. Scripps frowned. Usually David was more than happy to talk at length about Dakin. Why this sudden silence? It didn't matter to Scripps that he had gone-it wasn't like Maisie had been left alone. But the effect it had had on David was disturbing. He was robotic. \"…Did something happen between you and Dakin?\" Scripps asked quietly. \"Donny!\" Lily called suddenly. \"I need the loo!\" \"Oh-right-\" Scripps had almost forgotten where he was. Feeling awful, he looked around until he spotted the familiar sign. \"Maisie, go with your sister.\" He didn't especially want to set foot in a ladies' toilet. \"I'll be right here, okay? You both come straight back after.\" \"Okay,\" Maisie said breezily, leading the way. When the girls were gone, Scripps turned back to David, who looked even paler. He opened his mouth slowly. Then closed it again. \"Did something happen?\" Scripps repeated, feeling apprehensive. He didn't like David's body language. Suddenly, David snapped. \"Look, you're just going to say \"I told you so\", aren't you? You'll tell me it's my own fault!\" Scripps was startled. \"Of course not! I would never-look, what's happened? Please tell me. You're scaring me.\" David's pale cheeks were flushing red. \"Okay, fine . Dakin \" said something I wouldn't like .\" Exactly like you said he would the day I sang She's Like The Swallow and Lockwood and Timms did Top Girls ! He-\" David broke off for a moment. \"Look, it's been proved right. Stupid little Posner's stupid little crush has broken his heart!\" he rushed, eyes cast upwards in despair. Scripps watched in dismay as tears began to fill David's wide eyes. He looked distraught. Fighting the urge to simply throw his arms around him, Scripps searched desperately for something to say. He wanted to comfort him, to stop him crying, to tell him Dakin didn't matter, that he was worth so much more than that, that he was wonderful…but he couldn't. \"Oh, Poz…\" he mumbled. That was all he could manage. \"It's fine.\" David said thickly, pursing his lips. \"Go ahead and laugh at me, and tell me you knew it was going to happen.\" \"No-\" Scripps stopped, horrified, as a tear dripped down David's thin cheek. It was natural, human nature at its purist. \"Oh, Poz, come here.\" He enfolded David into his arms, holding him tightly. David resisted-then gave in, leaning into him. He cried quietly into Scripps' shoulder in the middle of the hallway. Not caring who stared, Scripps embraced him, and the rest of the world seemed to melt away. Electric currents shot from the tips of his fingers as he held him close, his thin shoulders shaking slightly as he sobbed. Scripps felt like crying himself. Seeing David so hysterical almost killed him. \"There, now,\" Scripps mumbled tenderly into David's ear. \"There, now.\" David made a sound like an injured puppy. \"I-I-can't-\" \"There, now, shhh,\" Scripps made slow circles on the smaller boy's back with his hand. \"Shh, it's okay. It's going to be okay.\" He knew he was spouting nonsense-but he just wanted to comfort him in any way he could. \"It's going to be okay.\" \"I-it's not !\" David gave a strangled cry. \"I-d-don't know how I will ever face him again!\" \"Shhh, it's okay.\" Scripps murmured. \"It's going to be alright…Oh, please stop crying, I can't bear it,\" he let out, on the verge of tears himself. David sniffed hard. He took several deep breaths. \"I'm-being s-silly.\" \"No, you're not. How could you be?\" Scripps held him tighter. It felt like the most natural thing in the world. David fitted perfectly into his arms. But he barely thought on that. All he could think of was how on Earth he could make this better for David. He held him safely. \"I'm not going to let anyone say anything to you at school, if that's what you're worried about.\" \"No, that doesn't matter.\" David's voice still shook. \"I d-don't care w-what he says.\" Scripps sighed, still making slow circles on his miraculous back. Between his shoulder blades, he could feel his racing heart. \"You clearly do. Oh Poz, I can't bear to see you like this.\" \"B-being stupid,\" David repeated, wiping his eyes hard. \"No, you're not. What's stupid about loving someone?\" Scripps took a deep breath. \"The person you love is just being stupid right now. Whatever he's said to you, however he's hurt you-\" Scripps paused. He realised that old fury at Dakin was building up once again in his chest, stronger than ever. It was almost primal-a need to protect David at any cost. He couldn't believe that Dakin had hurt David like this. Had been so cruel to someone who he knew loved him so devotedly. \"Look, David.\" He looked straight into his eyes. They were heavenly, in seas of tears. Scripps reached up and gently wiped away the last tear. David looked surprised-but Scripps carried on, not caring. \"I'm not going to let him hurt you again. You don't deserve it.\" It was as if he was speaking with someone else's voice. \"I'm not going to let anyone hurt you again. Ever . I swear.\" A long moment passed. It could have been a hundred years. Or just seconds. David's eyes were wide. He stared straight back into Scripps' eyes, and seemed to notice something he never had before. He opened his mouth, as if to say something…then closed it. His eyes swam with tears, but he blinked them back hard. Suddenly, he broke firmly away from Scripps. \"David-?\" \"I have to go.\" David was backing away fast, sounding distracted. \"I need to get back to-I have to-\" \"David?\" Scripps was confused. His arms suddenly felt cold and empty. \"I need to go,\" David repeated, suddenly looking frightened. \"Tell Lily I hope she gets well soon. Say goodbye to Maisie for me,\" he gabbled. \" David ?\" Scripps' voice had become forlorn. \"Goodbye, Scripps!\" he called, his voice a flute. That was the last Scripps heard as he disappeared around the corner. Scripps was still and silent. He felt as if he had experienced a hurricane. So full of emotions, he was completely empty. Then-he shouted out loud. It was a wordless cry of pain and anger, which echoed off the walls and ceiling. A tidal wave washed over him as his head fell into his hands. It was as if his centre of gravity had been ripped away, leaving him drifting in space, cut off, hopeless... David ...[Chapter 10] Hello, everyone. Sorry for the delay. Thank you so much for reading and following-I really appreciate it. I hope you are all well. Thank you xxx \" Speak again !\" Crowther declared, knelt on the floor before the standing Dakin. \" Speak again, Jokanaan, and tell me what I must do .\" He delivered the lines like a professional actor, eyes hungry as he reached out to touch Dakin's leg-but Dakin recoiled, stepping back and holding out his arms warningly, as if Crowther was a wild animal. Almost all of the boys watched Crowther, enraptured. \" Daughter of Sodom, come not near me! But cover thy face with a veil, and scatter ashes upon thine head, and get thee to a desert to seek out the Son of Man .\" Dakin's acting seemed to be enhanced by Crowther's talent, as he regarded Crowther with a mixture of fear, piety and pity. In the corner, Hector clapped delightedly. \" Who is he, the Son of Man ?\" Crowther's voice was honey, so unlike his usual tone. He managed to be feminine, while avoiding any trace of campness as he slowly rose to his feet. He lent in to Dakin and whispered seductively. \" Is he as beautiful as thou art, Jokanaan ?\" \" Get thee behind me !\" Dakin shouted, jumping away. He looked around dramatically. \" I hear in this palace the beating of the wings of the angel of death .\" The boys broke into hearty applause, which Hector joined enthusiastically. \"Bravo, Crowther, bravo!\" he boomed. \"And me, sir?\" Dakin reminded him, shrinking back into himself. \"Yes, yes, you too, Dakin.\" Hector appeared to brush him off, turning back to Crowther. Dakin frowned. It seemed that the more time Dakin spent with Irwin, the more of his \"golden boy\" status in Hector's eyes was lost. \"But marvellous, Crowther, simply marvellous!\" Hector himself was saying. Crowther tried to contain his pleasure at the compliments. \"Cheers, sir,\" he grinned, sheepishly. \"Do you know what it was?\" Hector shook his head fondly, tutting. \"Your excellence excuses you from my displeasure at your patronising me with Oscar Wilde , you oblivious coquettes.\" Dakin shrugged as the rest of the boys laughed delightedly. \"We knew you'd get that one, sir.\" \"Crowther, pray remind me of the play you are starring in this weekend?\" Hector again ignored Dakin, sending Crowther up. \"I think a, shall we say, field trip is in order? Boys?\" He looked expectantly around the classroom, which was received with much nodding and agreement. Crowther looked slightly embarrassed, but thrilled, his eyes wide. It was rare he got this much attention. \"Oh sir, it's only The Crucible . Local am dram.\" \"There is nothing wrong with am dram.\" Hector stretched nostalgically. \"I was no stranger to the boards when I was young…and I certainly have a soft spot for Miller. Anyhow, which part do you play?\" Crowther's grin stretched. \"John Proctor.\" There was general awe in the room, especially from Hector who applauded once again. \"A field trip to watch young Crowther play this turbulent, steadfast, extraordinary character…Someone must pass the message onto our dear dictionary person …where is he today?\" Scripps started as all eyes suddenly turned to him. He had not been paying attention to the performance, nor to Crowther's moment of fame. Instead, he had been staring so hard at the back of David Posner's empty chair that he was surprised it bore no mark. He had been pondering this when he was suddenly thrust onto centre stage in the classroom. \"Erm…\" Scripps' eyes finally met Hector's, who was looking at him curiously. \"What?\" he said, stupidly. \"Where is dear Posner, do you know?\" Hector repeated patiently, head to one side. \"Are you quite alright, Scripps?\" \"Erm…I don't know.\" He coughed. \"Yeah, I'm-fine, sir.\" Hector frowned as the bell rang, signalling the end of the day. Eyebrows raising, it was clear that he did not swallow Scripps' lie. \"It must be your turn for a lift on the motorbike today,\" he said, with a smile as if offering him a great treat. Scripps' stomach jarred unpleasantly. Oh no. Not today. \"Yes, sir,\" he mumbled, too distracted to be anything but compliant. Hector beamed, satisfied, as he picked up his bag and left the classroom, beginning to don his leather jacket. \"Whoop whoop!\" Dakin's handsome face suddenly loomed into view, startling Scripps, whose chest constricted agonisingly at the sight of him. Now feeling rather sick, Scripps forced himself to smile ordinarily at Dakin, as if his presence didn't fill him with rage. \"Ooooh, your turn on the feel-mobile!\" Dakin was saying childishly. \"Mate-remember to put your bag between you and the big guy!\" \"I'll remember,\" Scripps said, trying to sound as if his jaw was unclenched. He stared at Dakin's devilishly striking looks, trying to quell the flames of furious agony in his chest. \"Do yourself a favour and try not to get a hard-on.\" Dakin ruffled his hair before slinging his bag over his shoulder and swanning in blissful confidence from the room. Scripps stared after him, wondering how he could be so relaxed with the weight of whatever he had done to David on his mind. Maybe he didn't feel it, didn't understand. Scripps almost envied his self-obsessed indifference. Where was David? Why hadn't he come to school today? Scripps wondered on account of whom David was absent-Dakin's actions, or his own. The former filled him with anger-the latter with dread. Clinging unwillingly to his teacher, Scripps' nostrils were filled with the smell of leather, the back of his neck being whipped mercilessly by the wind as they sped along. Schoolbag clamped firmly between his front and Hector's back, his only shield, Scripps endured the vibration of the road, gripping tightly for dear life. As the world raced by, Scripps gritted his teeth, praying to God that the traffic lights would be in his favour and they would not have to stop. If they did, there would be no stopping the old man. Sure enough, like most of Scripps' prayers, it went unanswered. Hector slowed to a standstill as the red light displayed. Scripps rolled his eyes long-sufferingly as the anticipated hand reached around towards him. He habitually recoiled as much as he could without letting go of Hector's shoulders. Luckily, the bag prevented Hector's grasping fingers from reaching his genitals. Sighing, Scripps hated his life. He had barely slept since his last meeting with David, he had not stopped loathing himself, the suppression of all he was feeling destroying him from within-and now he was dodging the grasp of his predatory schoolteacher on the back of a motorbike. Had David worked out his secret? Finally, the green light signalled, and the motorbike roared off. He had to know. He couldn't live like this. \"Mr Hector?\" Scripps shouted, over the deafening thundering of the motorbike. \"Mr Hector?\" \"Yes?\" Hector shouted back, sounding slightly put-out. Conversations were rarely held on the bike. \"Can you-\" Scripps paused, swallowing hard. He knew he would regret this. \"Can you drop me off on Milton Rise? It's not far, sir. Sorry to ask,\" he added. \"There's something I need to do!\" Finally, the motorbike roared to a halt on the corner which lead onto Milton Rise. It was not a particularly attractive street, with pale brick terraced houses and cracked pavements. But to Scripps, knowing who lived there, the plainness became beauty in his eyes and caused stirrings in the bottom of his stomach as if he were about to walk onto a stage. Scripps scanned the houses, working out on which side of the street number 18 would be. \"Is this the place, Scipps?\" Hector asked, removing his helmet and steadying the bike with a foot on the kerb. \"Perfect, sir.\" Scripps began to scramble off the bike, clutching his bag like a life jacket. \"Thank you for the lift.\" \"You are most welcome.\" Hector smiled at Scripps in his usual way-but there was a searching look in his eyes. \"Are you sure you are quite alright, my boy? You have had a troubled look about you recently.\" He tilted his head to one side again, concerned. Scripps marvelled at how he could switch from attempting to fondle his genitals on a fast bike to caring immensely about his welfare. \"N-no, sir,\" he answered, far too quickly. Hector frowned. \"It's not this infernal Oxbridge fixation, is it?\" \"No sir, nothing like that.\" \"So there is something.\" Hector grinned triumphantly. Scripps tutted good-naturedly. \"You've caught me, sir,\" he said, smiling weakly. \"Too smart for me.\" \"Not at all, dear boy-I am a mere Sheffield -educated mortal.\" He grinned satirically, then sighed fondly. \"Whatever is the matter?\" Scripps shrugged vaguely; he was not about to discuss David with Mr Hector -of all people. The excitement would probably make him keel over. \"Nothing that can be remedied…\" \"Come now, that can't be true.\" Hector leaned closer, still softly smiling. \"A problem shared is a problem doubled.\" Scripps snorted. He looked into his teacher's eyes, the bright eagerness mixed with a worldly wisdom that Scripps did not understand. He had never thought of Hector as being a human being, with his own life and loves and experiences beyond the pages of books. Sighing, he realised how much he would miss the old man once he went to university. \"…Well…I guess I'm having some problems with…\" He chose his words carefully. \"…feelings for another…person…\" Hector's eyes lit up with excitement. \"I knew it! I knew it!\" he said gleefully. \"I'd know that look anywhere.\" Instantly, Scripps was embarrassed. \"Look, sir, you'll forget we had this conversation, right?\" \"Of course, of course, my dear boy-my lips are sealed.\" Hector looked as though Christmas had come early. \"So-are these feelings requited?\" Slowly, Scripps shook his head, feeling immensely awkward. \"No.\" If anything, Hector looked even more pleased. \"It is a pain we all must bear at some point in our lives-dear, dear! To be young…Well, Scripps, now is the perfect time to use that pain to do some real writing . It is your ambition to be a journalist, right? Why not use words-compose poetry? After all, as a great man once said-\" Scripps involuntarily sniffed. Hector backed up. \"I'm so sorry, Scripps, I got carried away…ignore this foolish old teacher.\" \"It's okay, sir. I know what you mean.\" \"But Scripps-\" Hector did not seem keen to let him go. \"Do you know for sure it is unrequited?\" Scripps swallowed hard. \"I'm ninety-nine per cent sure.\" \"But it is that one per cent that grieves you so?\" Hector nodded knowingly. \"It is that tiny portion of hope that tortures a person in your predicament…\" \"Sort of…\" Scripps took a deep breath, knowing he was going to regret this. But it felt so good to talk to someone . \"Well…this person sort of…loves someone else.\" \"Ah, I see!\" Hector clapped his hands. \"But the other person is just so cold, and horrible to them, and just recently they've really, really hurt the person I…well… but I don't know what's happened, they won't tell me, and now I don't know what to do because I think I might have accidently made it clear that I have feelings for them and I think that might have freaked them out and now I feel so bad because they have no one to talk to- they are my best friend and I should be there for them to talk to about whatever the person they love has done to them but they can't and it's so hard and I'm hurting so much because they are hurting and that kills me and I think I've royally fucked up, sir. I'm terrified I've lost them for good.\" Scripps took several breaths, before realising how he had gabbled. Feeling his cheeks flush, he said quickly: \"I'm sorry, sir.\" He was mortified. Hector put his head to the other side. He didn't look bothered by Scripps' outburst. Instead, he looked once again at the sign at the side of the road, Milton Rise . He frowned musingly. A few silent, agonising moments passed. \"…Milton Rise…\" Hector mumbled. \"Why is that familiar…?\" He looked up at Scripps. \"To paraphrase My Fair Lady , is this the street where said person lives?\" Scripps nodded. \"I've come to see if there is anything I can do for them.\" \" Milton Rise …\" Suddenly, Mr Hector's eyes widened, mouth hanging slightly open. \"I know. I've written it on an envelope home before now. One of us lives here…\" Fear gripped Scripps, like ice in his heart. Oh no . \"It's not-it's not one of-it's not anyone from-?\" But he knew his lies were transparent. Hector feigned innocence. \"I was not suggesting that one of your classmates was the object of your affections.\" He pretended to look incredulous-but a wicked grin gave him away. The old man looked as though he had won the lottery. \"No-not-sir!\" Scripps stammered, terrified. \"Oh, not to worry, my dear, dear Scripps!\" Hector beamed openly, eyes twinkling like stars. \"Your secret is quite safe with me!\" His tone suddenly became enraptured, hypnotic. \" To love another is something like prayer and cannot be planned. You just fall into its arms, because your belief undoes your disbelief …\" Scripps blinked. \"That was beautiful, sir…\" \"Anne Sexton, my boy.\" Hector put a hand on Scripps' shoulder, looking him straight in the eyes. \"I will say no more, Scripps. Just take care of yourself, yes?\" \"Thank you, sir,\" Scripps smiled gratefully. \"And please-\" \"My lips are sealed.\" Hector was putting his helmet. \"Now, fair you well on your noble quest. I shall see you tomorrow.\" \"Thank you.\" Scripps said again, pathetically. \"Goodbye, Scripps.\" The bike revved, and too soon was gone, leaving Scripps wondering. That had been one of the most surreal conversations of his life. He felt that he had entered another realm-one of insanity. Quickly, he gathered himself, and put the previous conversation out of his mind as he hurried along the pavement to number 18, Anne Sexton's words ringing in his head. They filled him with a sort of courage as he rapped on the blue front door before he could stop himself. Nervously, he waited. He felt slightly sick, half-dreading the sight of David-or how David would regard him. There was a long pause, before the door finally opened-to reveal a middle-aged woman with greying curly hair. \"Hello?\" she asked, her eyes kind. Scripps could pick out David in her voice, and those eyes. She had to be his mother. \"Mrs Posner?\" he asked, anxiously. \"Yes?\" Her eyes narrowed slightly. \"Do I know you from somewhere?\" \"Yes, I'm-I'm Donald Scripps. A friend of David's from school.\" \"Oh!\" David's mother smiled warmly in recognition. \"Yes, the pianist David sings with. I remember.\" \"Yes.\" Scripps coughed slightly. \"I was wondering –as David wasn't in school today-erm…where he was…?\" His voice trailed off pathetically. \"David isn't very well, I'm afraid,\" she answered apologetically. \"I decided to keep him off. It's all this pressure I think-it's affecting his health…\" \"Oh no.\" Scripps was torn between worry-if David was ill, he wanted to run to him and comfort him-and suspicion. Could this be an excuse? \"Would it be okay to see him? It won't take long,\" he rushed. Mrs Posner looked slightly taken aback-but she still smiled. \"I'll just pop up to him and see how he is feeling. I'm sure he'll appreciate you coming, dear.\" \"I hope so.\" Scripps said sincerely. \"Thank you so much.\" \"No problem.\" Mrs Posner smiled again as she left him on the doorstep. Scripps waited apprehensively. He heard the sound of fee on stairs, and then a door being opened. \"Mum?\" Scripps' heart leapt at the faint sound of David's voice. It at least tripled his nerves. \"How are you feeling. Oh, you do look pale, darling.\" \"I'm…coping.\" \"Well, I came up to tell you one of your friends is here to see you. I wondered if you were up to seeing him.\" There was a pause. \"Who?\" \"Donald, he said. Donald Scripps , was it?\" Another agonising pause. Then, in a very different, misty voice: \"Erm…I don't think I can see him. I feel really…I don't think it's a good idea for me to see anyone right now.\" Scripps felt as if all his internal organs had fallen out onto the floor. \"Oh really, dear? He's come all this way. He's obviously a nice boy. He seems very worried about you.\" \"Yes. He's a wonderful friend…\" All of Scripps' organs miraculously fell back into place. \"…but tell him I'll see him tomorrow. I don't think I can face anyone at the moment. Tell him we will talk tomorrow…please.\" \"Okay, darling. I'll go and tell him. I'll bring you up a glass of milk too, yes?\" \"Mum, I don't want milk-\" David sounded annoyed. \"It's good for you. It makes you stronger, darling.\" Mrs Posner said firmly. \"I'll be right back.\" Scripps did not know how to feel as he heard her footsteps on the stairs once again. On the one hand…they were to talk tomorrow. On the other… \"I'm sorry, dear, but David's really not feeling up to it.\" Mrs Posner punctured his thoughts as she re-appeared. \"Oh, really?\" Scripps quickly arranged his face into a look of surprise and concern, as if he hadn't heard. \"But you'll see him tomorrow in school, dear, if he's well enough.\" Mrs Posner's head fell to one side, much like Hector's. \"Are you alright, dear?\" \"Yes. Yes, I'm fine. Thank you so much. Tell David I hope he gets better soon.\" After they had said goodbye, Scripps stood for a few moments silently on the doorstep.[Chapter 11] Hello everyone. Thank you so much for reading-next chapter will be posted soon. Also a massive thank you for all your reviewing and following-I appreciate it so much. I'm so happy to be here, with people who love The History Boys as I do. Big love to you all xxx PS: I apologise for the French in this chapter! I'm very, very rusty! In addition-I own nothing! :') \"Good morning, good morning!\" Mr Hector boomed, throwing open the door to admit the assembled boys, who shivered and clutched raincoats and umbrellas. \"Good morning! Good morrow to the sun. Hail, thou fair heaven !\" \" Cymbeline , sir,\" Akthar answered the question which did not need to be asked. \"Trés bon, Akthar.\" Mr Hector beamed even more broadly than usual as the class filed in. \"Il pleut des cordes!\" Timms pointed at the window, on which rain lashed, making slug trails on the glass. As if on cue, thunder sounded in the distance, a low rumble on the horizon. \"Il fait mauvais!\" he shouted, laughing as if Hector was completely mad. Hector himself simply shook his head, a knowing smile on his lips. \"Non-sens, mes enfants-le temps est beau! Sophisme pathétique! Exemples, exemples!\" The teacher waved a hand expectantly as the class began to sit, carefully locking the door behind them. \"Les Grandes Espérances!\" Lockwood called, throwing off his mac and showing Timms with rain water. \"Le Prométhée Moderne!\" Timms clouted Lockwood hard upon the head for his injury. \"Le Roi Lear!\" Crowther added. \"Les Hauts de Hurlevent.\" Scripps said quietly from his seat. \"Ah, bien fait!\" Hector grinned down at Scripps, giving the slightest of winks, which made his skin crawl-he had almost forgotten their conversation yesterday. \"Les Hauts de Hurlevent! Le amour interdit! Et le amour obsessionnel...\" Scripps shrunk slightly in his seat, feeling his cheeks burn. He was put at great unease by the twinkle in Mr Hector's eye when he looked at him, as if they had some great shared secret. He supposed they did-but being reminded of it sent an uncomfortable lunge through his body. There was a great emptiness in his chest. David Posner's second day of absence, rather than evoking the same dread as the first, merely induced a horrible sense of anticipation and anti-climax. He had barely slept-partly because Lily's poor broken wrist had been hurting on and off. Scripps wondered if anyone else in the class had to put up with six-year-olds tapping on their bedroom door at un-Godly hours. She found it difficult to sleep with the cast on. Instead of bothering their parents, she granted Scripps the highest honour of being her first port of call. Whenever he was not up with Lily, he had lain awake in bed, thoughts of David running through his mind as he had tried desperately to prepare what on Earth he was to say to him today. Having arrived at school, heart racing, with nothing in mind, he had been both exasperated and relieved to find no sign of David. It was impossible to gauge. Scripps prayed with all his might that David had not unearthed his secret-then it was just a question of comforting the boy regarding Dakin. But if David had realised Scripps was in love with him…? Wait. In love with him ? That was ridiculous. Scripps felt himself physically shake. Of course he wasn't in love with David. How could he be? The idea was ludicrous. Suddenly, someone tapped on the glass of the locked door. \"Attends. Quelqu-un frappe á ma porte!\" Mr Hector cocked his ear comically. \"Lockwood-ouvrir lui, s'il vous plaît!\" Begrudgingly, Lockwood got to his feet, abandoning the small ruler war he and Timms were conducting under the desk, and made his way across the classroom. He jimmied the lock, and the door swung open-to reveal a small, slim boy with soaking wet hair. \"I'm so sorry I'm late, Mr Hector, I-\" not t Hector put a finger to his lips, which were stretching into a satisfied smile. \"Ici on ne parle que français!\" he said in a sing-song voice. David smiled, relieved to clearly have escaped trouble. Meanwhile, Scripps merely stared at him. Here was David-David, sopping wet, his hair gloriously windswept-and smiling. The sight of him made Scripps' heart start to turn lazy somersaults in his chest, the warm glow spreading through his body...For a few glorious moments, Scripps forgot everything. \"Oh! Je veuillez m'excuser de mon retard!\" David was saying to Hector. \"Pas de problème,\" Hector indicated the chair nearest to Scripps. \"Asseyez-vous, mon enfant!\" \"Oh, Dakin!\" Timms suddenly called, his voice in a comical falsetto. \"Dakin, mon cher? Voici ton femme!\" \" Fuck off .\" Dakin hissed from the back of the classroom, as Timms and Rudge giggled. David ignored them, walking quickly to where Hector had motioned without reaction or comment. Scripps' heart went into double time as David collapsed into the seat next to him, looking exhausted. He marvelled at how David's mere presence could have this much effect upon him. As usual, he felt physically drawn to him, wanting nothing more than to hold him close, safe and warm. It was almost too excruciating to bear. \"Hey.\" Scripps whispered as David finally composed himself. He looked up, slightly surprised. \"Oh-hi, Scripps.\" David gave him a wan smile, removing his raincoat and slinging it over the back of his chair-splattering Scripps with droplets in the process. \"Oh!\" he squeaked again. \"I'm sorry!\" \"It's fine,\" Scripps couldn't care less. \"Listen-how are you?\" David made a non-committal noise. \"Better than Saturday!\" \"That's good.\" Scripps smiled. David appeared to be regarding him perfectly normally. \"I'm glad to hear it.\" \"I'm really sorry for just running off like that.\" David whispered. \"How is Lily?\" \"She's coping.\" Relief was cascading through Scripps' veins. \"I can't thank you enough for your help.\" \"It's no-\" \"Ahem!\" Mr Hector's voice suddenly cut through their conversation. \"L'Anglais, c'est interdit!\" \"Talk to you at break.\" Scripps murmured, to which David nodded once. After rushing through hurried apologies in French, Scripps paid no attention to Hector-nor anyone else in the classroom for the next quarter of an hour. Knowing his secret was safe-that he had not lost David-filled him with such joy. However, it was bitter. This silence, this restraint…Scripps wondered if it would almost have been better to have David know, so that there would be no secrets. Propped up on one elbow, Scripps tried not to stare at David, who was working quietly, writing in his battered notebook. It was immensely difficult-the gravitational force between them was so compelling. His small left hand lying idle on the desk was tantalisingly inviting. Scripps longed to take it, to fit his hand into his own larger one, to connect. Even to touch it, to trace the maze of lines and veins Scripps had memorized that night after Dakin's party, when he had held vigil over the sleeping David for those precious hours… Suddenly, the crackle of paper interrupted Scripps' thoughts. A piece of lined paper, folded many times had been pushed onto his desk. Written on the front, in familiar blue handwriting, was simply the word Scripps. It was addressed to him. Scripps chanced a look at the author of the note, who was deliberately not looking at him. Frowning, slightly bewildered, Scripps unfolded the note, his hands trembling slightly. Dear Scrippsy. I'm sorry-I couldn't wait to talk to you. I need to say a few things, and if I don't say them now, I think I should burst. I hope you will understand. Keep this hidden-I wouldn't want the whole class to know. Firstly-I'm sorry for shouting at you this weekend, I truly am. It was not your fault in the slightest. I was so upset because of what had happened between Dakin and I. Oh Scrippsy, he was so harsh and cold. It was quite frightening. He was selfish and, frankly, an arse to me-and to you. But I shouted back at him. I told him I hated being the class joke, like you always said I should. You were right-I do feel better for saying it. Worse in many ways-he wouldn't even look at me when I came in just now. But better in many others. I was just reeling with the shock of it when I met you, and consequently stormed off. I feel terribly guilty. I hope you can forgive me? Secondly-you may have noticed that I called Dakin an arse in the previous paragraph. This is because I'm starting to think-maybe he is. A bit. Oh, I don't know. But when he was so cold on Saturday-it was like I was breaking through a veil to see the real Dakin for the first time. Before Saturday, Dakin was perfect to me. But since Saturday, it's like the glass somehow shattered, and I could see him clearly. It made me wonder if I had somehow invented my perfect Dakin in my head- and I couldn't see the real Dakin before me. Or choose not to (see how deeply I have been thinking!). Anyway, to conclude, after many hours pondering this, I wonder whether I have been a complete fool regarding the whole Dakin business. I'm so confused, Scrippsy. Maybe I still love him-but maybe...I don't know. Thirdly-what you said at the hospital before I left about how you would protect me. I can safely say that I think you got a little theatrical! Perhaps it was the high drama of the day. But I just wanted to say thank you. I do appreciate you so much, Scripps. You are always so good to me, so kind and understanding. I couldn't ask for a better friend. And, as your friend, I wanted to say that you need not worry. Dakin make me feel so weak-but now I feel stronger. I think I can handle Dakin. Finally-You. I'm sorry, Scrippsy, but you haven't seemed yourself recently. I wanted to tell you that I am always here to help you just as much as you are here to help me! We can lean on one another-it's better that way. So if you need anything at all, you can always come to me, I promise. I'd drop everything for you just like you do for me. Chin up, Scrippsy. And thank you, once again. From Your Poz xxx Scripps read the note twice through, breathing heavily, before turning it over. His hand shook as he wrote back, palms moist. Dear Poz, Firstly-no worries, seriously. It's fine, I completely understand. I don't blame you. I hope you're okay now. Secondly-I cannot tell you how goo that is to hear. This sounds like a fresh start for you, mate. I think you might be right. You don't have to make up your mind-no one is rushing you. Take your time, and don't stress. Everything will turn out the way it is supposed to. Thirdly-I must apologise for my own outburst! It was probably unnecessarily dramatic…but I'm glad the sentiment got through. If you ever need anything, you know where to find me. And lastly- Don't worry about me, mate. You just take care of yourself. I'm absolutely fine-probably just tired! Nice to have you back. Always, Your Scrippsy. Scripps passed the note along before he could stop himself. It hurt him to lie to David-but not as much as the truth would. Besides-how could he convey everything onto a scrap of paper? David' letter had both relieved and grieved him. To know that he was perhaps finally getting over Dakin filled him with elation-and a tiny beacon of hope had flared without his permission in his chest. But David remained oblivious to his feelings…Scripps could not understand how he could feel all of this for him…and he feel nothing…even if David did get over Dakin, there was no way he could tell him his heart, or make any of his feelings known. The very thought terrified him. Breathing in hard through his nose, Scripps concentrated on the joy he felt at David's improved state. After all-what truly mattered but David's happiness and their friendship? Scripps could live through David's contentment, could find his own reasons to rejoice in David's… He sighed heavily. Sadness and longing sat like immovable, jagged rocks in his heart.[Chapter 12] Hey everyone. Thank you so much for reading. I hope you are all well and happy. I hope you enjoy this chapter, and I will update soon. xxx Donald Scripps and David Posner strolled together through the corridors in the direction of the din audible from the canteen half-way across the school. Because of the storm, every pupil remained inside, which saved Scripps the playground duty he would have had to undertake. The rain lashed mercilessly at the windows-Fiona's blouse was rather damp, to the great approval of most of the boys, who seemed to be finding every excuse to bypass the Headmaster's office, staring through the window like tourists at a zoo. But they could have been in the middle of a hurricane for all Scripps cared-nothing could dampen his spirits. Rather than spending their mutual free period studying, Scripps and David had snuck into the empty music classroom. After he had picked the lock on the lid of the piano open and consolidated his thick folder of sheet music, for one glorious hour Scripps played while David sang. Anything David wanted, from musical theatre to jazz and folk, Scripps picked out on the yellowing keys, making more mistakes than normal as the sound of David's voice stole him away from reality. Sometimes he sang along quietly, but mostly he just listened, distinctly aware of David standing behind him, sometimes leaning in close over his shoulder to check the lyrics. Scripps wished he would linger there longer. When they were not playing, they talked. Not about Dakin. Not about anything in particular. As the rain hammered at the window, making trails down the window, they simply talked. Mostly David talked, while Scripps listened contentedly. He loved hearing the wonderings of David's mind, collecting precious details like butterflies in glass jars and storing them away safely in his mind. David's favourite songs, the places he liked, the places he wanted to go, by what means he had burned his hand when he was seven, how the word \"popcorn\" made him think of slippers for some reason…Everything seemed of great importance. \"I'm sorry, Scrippsy, I feel like I've done nothing but talk!\" David's voice broke into his thoughts. \"You must be sick of the sound of my voice!\" How could I ever be? \"Not at all,\" Scripps assured him, half amused. \"Not at all.\" As they entered the canteen, the noise levels rising dramatically, Scripps joined the line for lunch behind David, feeling like his feet had not touched the ground. He loved the simplicity of this-just talking with David about everything and nothing, just relaxing together, singing and playing. He wished every day was like this. No tension, no shadow of Dakin looming over David, no faint sadness in his eyes. Just the two of them. As he received his tray of rubbery pasta and congealed sauce with thanks, he thanked God silently for this precious time with David, for David's new clarity and happiness. As he looked up and saw David waiting for him, holding his own tray and smiling shyly, he felt like the luckiest person in the word. \"Dakin? Yoohoo, Dakin?\" came a high-pitched, mocking voice from the crowded lunch table they approached. \"Dakin, mon petit poulet?\" Sluggishly, Dakin looked up from his plate of pasta, looking furiously at Timms as Scripps and David sat down with their trays. \"Regardez!\" Timms was saying, a huge, smug smile on his face, pointing at David. \"Voici ton femme! Ton femme, Dakin!\" he declared, snorting. \" Fuck off !\" Dakin snapped, with even less patience than usual as the rest of the boys howled with laughter. Scripps caught David's eye and smiled empathetically. \"Ton poulet est fâché!\" Lockwood was telling Timms. \"Je m'en fous,\" Timms said, shrugging-then cackling again. \"Il est la maladie d'amour!\" Scripps half-listened to Dakin's colourfully phrased reply, which would have made his vicar weep. He found he had no interest in lunch, half-heartedly stirring his food with the plastic fork. However, to his delight, he watched David eat hungrily, as if he was starving. He tried to remember the last time he had seen David eat so enthusiastically. Epiphanies must be exhausting, Scripps thought proudly as David ignored Dakin and merely snickered at Timms' teasing-so different to his mortification at the start of the joke. The difference in David-how relaxed his shoulders were, how he breathed with ease! Timms' lips were puckered now, as he kissed the air beside Dakin's cheek. \" Embrasse moi, je te desire …\" he murmured sexily, making wet, slurping noises. He rubbed his hands across his chest, giving a carnal groan. \" Oh, oh, oh, Posner, ma chérie !\" he growled in a low voice, before switching to a simpering falsetto to exclaim: \" Oh, oh oh, Dakin, mon mari !\" Rudge snorted his Coke out of his nose as Timms joined in the rapturous laughter that followed his lastest display. \"I genuinely hate all of you.\" said Dakin, his voice monotonous, eyes so cold he seemed almost serious. \" Ooooooh !\" Timms squealed, holding his hands up, face now slightly red from laughing. \"Posner, ton mari est grincheux!\" David glanced up, his smile stretching lazily across his face. That miraculous dimple glowed upon his cheek, making Scripps' heart silently melt. \"Je veux un divorce.\" David was saying, lightly. Timms' hands slammed on the table, his mouth hanging open with shock. \" NON !\" he shouted, so loud that several tables around them turned to stare. The other boys gawped at Posner-who simply smiled again, looking directly at Dakin, who regarded him with narrowed eyes. \"Je veux un divorce,\" he repeated. \"Bon débarras, mon cher!\" \"UN DIVORCE!\" Timms cried, looking scandalised. He looked at if his world had just shattered. \"UN DIVORCE?\" \"Oh mon Dieu!\" Lockwood added, eyes bulging, looking unsure whether to laugh or cry. The suspicious Dakin kept looking sideways at David, as if trying to work out his game. David, on the other hand, looked around serenely, enjoying the upper-hand he so rarely achieved, taking another mouthful of pasta and sauce. Scripps merely gawped at him, full of admiration. He felt himself deliriously falling for him all over again. \"Que dire des enfants?\" Timms was saying in horror. \"Les enfants?\" Dakin spluttered, breaking his silence. A forkful of pasta was half-way to his mouth, floating in mid-air. \"Oui, vos enfants! Les enfants juives !\" Timms banged his fist on the table in frustration. \"Les enfants juives? Again?\" said a voice from above. Eight heads snapped up to see Irwin standing over them, his eagerness carefully masked by a raised eyebrow and sarcastic tone. He looked over the boys. Looking as if he dreaded what he would hear, he turned to Timms. \"Dare I ask-what on Earth has happened now?\" Timms looked up at him, eyes wide, looking like a character from a Shakespearian tragedy. \"Posner just told Dakin he wants a divorce!\" he said thickly, as if they were his own parents. Irwin stared for a moment-then an uncertain laugh bubbled out of him. \"What?\" \"I know! I'm as saddened and appalled as you are, sir!\" Timms groaned, a hand flying to his forehead. Irwin looked at David, who was calmly taking a drink of water. \"This must be one of the shortest-lived marriages on record…\" \"It's not that unusual, sir!\" Dakin said suddenly, his voice much louder than usual, eyes wide, almost begging for Irwin's attention. \"Ernest Borgnine and Ethel Merman were only married for four weeks!\" Irwin laughed. \"Oh dear, oh dear-you boys!\" \"Don't say \"you boys!\" like that, sir!\" Dakin retorted, still keen to capture Irwin's interest, like a hungry spaniel. \"Makes it sound like we're more than about five minutes younger than you!\" Irwin raised his eyebrow again. \"Dakin, I can see that the trauma of your separation has addled your brains. You seem to think that treating me as a comrade will distract me from the fact that you failed to hand in your essay this morning.\" A loud \" Ooooooh !\" issued from the table as the other boys delighted in Dakin's embarrassment. Irwin looked pleased with himself, as Dakin's cheeks were tickled pink. \"It will be on my desk by the end of the day, Dakin. You mustn't expect this leniency from Oxford!\" \"Have a heart, sir.\" Scripps piped up, grinning smugly at Dakin. Suddenly, Scripps felt a lot more warmly towards him than he had done in a long time. \"He's just lost his wife.\" \"My fucking wife .\" Dakin hissed, folding his arms. He looked daggers at Irwin-who ignored him. \"And he and Posner's children are caught in the middle!\" Timms was lamenting. Scripps marvelled at how he kept a straight face. \"Oh, they're like poor little sheep that have lost their way! Where will they go, sir?\" Timms wailed, appealing to Irwin. \"What will they do, sir?\" Irwin chuckled, looking slightly taken-aback. \"Which brings me onto my second point Dakin, Posner-between getting engaged and married-and I still want to know why I wasn't on the guest list-how on Earth did you make time to have children?\" \" That's the problem with Dakin and Posner having children together, sir?\" Akthar exclaimed, shaking his head at the madness he was experiencing. \"Not how the children came about in the first place-but how they fit it into their schedules ? Didn't you take biology, sir?\" This debate continued as Scripps lost himself deep in thought. He kept glancing at David. He seemed more drawn to him than ever, so compelling that Scripps wondered if it would physically hurt to be apart from him. He thought about that night at Dakin's again, carrying him up the stairs, lying next to him for those treasured hours…then of today, in the music room, simply being themselves. The time he spent alone with David stuck more firmly in his mind than anything he had ever experienced before, even the times before he had realised all David truly meant to him. A small, daring part of Scripps' brain wondered if it was worth risking those times for a shot at truly being with David… A small shock passed through him, like an electric current. He had never fully allowed himself to consider this possibility before. Could he…did he dare…? No. It was hopeless. David would never see him in that way. He had never given any indication that he liked him, or found him attractive at all. Despite what those ghastly mothers had behaved like, Scripps did not consider himself attractive at all-especially if David's tastes were closer to the movie-star looks of Dakin…Scripps felt strange, wondering whether he was handsome enough to be liked by David. Looks shouldn't matter. But Scripps wondered if, when it came to it, they did. He had such little experience of this. Aside from holding hands with one or two girls and a few kisses at parties, Scripps was ignorant of the world of relationships. Their close friendship was exactly that. He was sure he didn't have a chance with David-and telling him how he truly felt could jeopardise the friendship he held so dear…but would he regret not trying more? Could he risk his current relationship with David? Was he willing to stand whatever David made of his confessions? What if David was freaked out? Scripps certainly was. This whole business terrified him more than he cared to admit. As he watched David laughing softly at something Irwin said, eyes shining, Scripps wondered.[Chapter 13] Hey everyone :') Sorry so much for the delay updating-I have been so busy. Thank you so much for sticking with me, and for reviewing and following-and reading :') I hope you are all well, enjoy! More soon xxx \"'Scuse!\" A small boy attempted to dash past Posner in the corridor-crashing sidelong into him like a tawny-haired torpedo in the process. Letting out a small \"Oh!\", the pile of books Posner had been clutching to his chest spilled out of his arms and onto the floor. \"Awh, shit!\" The boy stopped, turning on one heel. He glanced at the books on the floor as Posner bent down. \"I did say 'scuse!\" Giggling uncertainly, he dashed off towards the canteen. Posner sighed heavily. He knew that if it had been any one of his taller, more intimidating classmates, that boy would have respectfully apologised. As it was, Posner was willing to bet he didn't look much older than that boy, especially in uniform. Pushing his lips firmly together, he began to scoop up the dropped books as he cursed his parents' genes yet again. Why couldn't he have been a few inches taller, a little bit broader? It would make life so much more- \"Hey!\" Suddenly, as if out of thin air, Scripps appeared at the other end of the hallway. Despite the dull weather, he had abandoned his blazer, and had rolled up the sleeves of his shirt, strong forearms exposed. Posner noticed a radiant smile break over his face as he drew nearer, eyes bright. \"Poz! What are you doing down there?\" \"Hey, Scrippsy.\" Posner grinned weakly from his position kneeling on the floor. He noted Scripps' apparent good mood with pleasure. \"Some kid knocked me.\" \"Oh-let me help you with that!\" With astonishing speed, Scripps swooped down and began to collect Posner's books into a pile. Abandoning the protest his lips had been forming, Posner simply watched as Scripps retrieved the books. The pile of books under his arm grew quickly in his eagerness to help, and before Posner knew it, he was standing, books balanced neatly under one arm as he chivalrously held out his other hand to help Posner to his feet. \"Oh-thanks!\" Posner, slightly surprised, took the hand. \"No problem.\" Scripps said kindly, his eyes shining as he gently, but firmly, pulled Posner up. \"Here, are you going to the library now?\" \"Er-yeah. If my arms don't break on the way!\" Posner gestured to the books, still in Scripps' strong arms. \"Here-let me help you out. I'm going there anyway. Can't have more arms broken!\" With dexterity, Scripps divided the books between them. Posner noticed that he had kept hold of all the heaviest books as he adjusted the much lighter load in his arms. \"Come on then.\" Scripps smiled again, before setting off towards the library. Posner followed, feeling distinctly happier. Scripps was clearly in a wonderful mood-something he hadn't seen for quite some time. Everything always seemed nicer when Scripps was smiling-his features emitted a sort of glow, as if he wasn't just happy in himself, but wanted the world to be happy too. There was not a selfish bone in Scripps' body-he emanated an aura of safety and warmth, as if he was taking care of you simply by being with you. Posner loved the pleasure he got from helping others-it was inspirational. \"How is Lily's poor wrist?\" he said conversationally. \"Oh-she's the centre of attention at primary-I think half the school have signed her cast!\" Scripps said cheerfully. \"Maisie always talks about you, you know?\" \"Really?\" Posner asked, surprised. \"Yeah, it's all \" Is David this?…Does David like that?… \"\" Scripps smiled fondly. \"She's fascinated by you.\" \"Oh!\" Posner felt a little awkward, but not unpleasantly so. He had liked Scripps' sisters-such nice little girls. \"You look after them a lot, don't you?\" \"Yeah.\" Scripps pushed the library door open with his back, and held it open for Posner to pass through in front of him. \"Both parents work quite a bit, you see. But it's never quiet at home with those two! Well, here we go.\" Scripps carefully put the pile of books down on Posner's favourite desk, next to the window. \"Enjoy studying!\" \"Thank you.\" Posner pulled out the wooden chair and sat down, adding his own books to the pile. \"Are you studying in your free too? Come keep me company,\" he offered. \"I'd love to-but can't.\" Scripps smiled sadly. \"I'm helping out in a first-year English lesson. Mrs Dyer said there's a boy that needs some attention, but she can't help him as much as he needs as well as teaching the rest of the class. Poor kid has a lot of trouble reading…\" Posner blinked. \"And you just said you'd help?\" \"Yeah,\" Scripps frowned slightly, still smiling. \"I had a free-and I like Mrs Dyer. She lent me Paradise Lost .\" Posner felt another surge of warmth towards his friend. \"Wow…\" \"He's embarrassed, Mrs Dyer says-think the other boys give him a hard time about being slow.\" Scripps was saying, stretching. \"so she thought having a sixth former to sort of mentor him would be beneficial.\" \"Yeah…\" Posner agreed, slightly distracted. He had never noticed the slight but defined muscles in Scripps' arms, softly visible against the white fabric of his school shirt. They must have been a recent addition to his physique…Posner liked the way he talked with his hands, so expressively, just like the way he played piano… \"…just to give him some confidence, you know? I think that's all it is, really.\" Scripps stopped abruptly. Posner jumped-he realised he hadn't been listening to Scripps so much as watching him talk. He shook his head slightly. \"Yeah-that sounds great,\" he said, finding his voice. \"Well-good luck. Hope it goes well.\" \"Thanks.\" Scripps grinned. \"See you at lunchtime.\" And with that, Scripps was gone, leaving Posner alone. As Scripps walked away from the library, his spirit was soaring. Making his way towards the English classrooms at the other end of the school, he wished he could have stayed with David in the library for the next hour. But he'd made a commitment to Mrs Dyer, and to this boy. Dutifully, he made his way through the corridors, concentrating on the walk so little that his bag crashed repeatedly into the walls. He knew his notebook would be getting bent, but found he did not care. Trying to remember details of Lord of the Flies , the book he had studied in first year English, he turned the final corner. \"Ah, Scripps!\" Mr Hector had appeared, at the door to his own classroom. His hand had been on the door knob, but he let it go and approached Scripps. Oh God . \"Good morning, sir.\" Scripps forced a smile for the old man, eyes flicking to his destination across the hall and round the corner, trying to non-verbally tell him that he was in a hurry. \"Good morning, my dear boy.\" Mr Hector's eyes were wide as he talked to him as if speaking to a dear friend recovering from a serious illness. \"How are you today?\" he asked delicately. \"I'm fine, sir, just fine.\" Scripps said, trying desperately to avoid the conversation he knew was coming. \"Ah, a brave soul!\" Mr Hector's hands were clasped behind his back. \" Sat like patience on a monument, smiling at grief ….\" \"I'm fine , sir.\" Scripps said again, more firmly. \"Excuse me, I have to get to-\" \"Aren't you going to tell me where the quotation was from?\" There was a twinkle in Hector's eye. \"Or will you disappoint me?\" \" Twelfth Night , sir. Easy.\" Scripps forced another smile, wondering how on Earth he could escape this. \"Well done, boy.\" Mr Hector looked pleased. \"Now, if you will excuse me, I have a class of young minds to mould…\" He put his hand back on the door handle and twisted it. \"But if you need to talk at all, Scripps…\" he added, with concern. \"Yes, sir. Thank you sir.\" Scripps rushed awkwardly, wondering if there was anything he would not do to avoid talking about his feelings for David Posner to Hector . The old teacher seemed determined to hear about it. \"Good, very good…Goodbye, Scripps.\" Finally, Hector had disappeared into his classroom. Scripps breathed a heavy sigh of relief, leaning against a display board on the wall. How simply mortifying . He wondered how on Earth he could get off the hook. He wasn't sure how much more of Hector's concern he could take. In a way, it was nice to have someone know-he felt less like he could explode with the pressure of the secret. But Hector , of all people. He'd rather Timms knew. Well, not Timms. Timms would tell everyone …the thought made Scripps shudder. But he'd rather have almost anyone else know rather than Hector. Shit, maybe he'd even rather- \"Well, that was weird.\" Scripps spun around to see Dakin, carelessly handsome, folder and textbook tucked under his arm. \"What the fuck was that about?\" he was saying, making his way towards Scripps, an expression of bewilderment and amusement spreading neatly across his face. Scripps' heart began to race, as if he had just been ushered onto stage. It hammered uncomfortably-Scripps could feel the colour spreading to his cheeks. \"Oh, hey, Dakin.\" Scripps folded his arms, trying to appear cool. \"Yeah, it was weird, wasn't it?\" he rushed. \"No idea what goes on in that man's head sometimes…\" \"No.\" Dakin grinned suspiciously, leaning against the wall beside him. \" If you need to talk at all …Have you and the big man been having cosy chats about your problems ?\" he spluttered. \"No!\" Scripps said, far too quickly. Dakin snickered, a corner of his mouth twitching. \"You have! Oh my God, what the fuck are you talking to Hector about?\" Dakin stepped closer, eyes glistening. \"Not how frustrating it is not being able to have a wank ?\" \"Oh, ha ha, clearly …\" Scripps drawled sarcastically, trying to turn it into a joke. He felt increasingly trapped, as if the walls were closing in on him. \"Did you two make some deep, personal connection while he groped your balls at fifty miles an hour?\" Dakin was laughing openly now, looking at Scripps as if he was a freak. \"What the fuck ?\" \"Shut up, Dakin,\" Scripps attempted a new tactic with a heavy overtone of desperation. \"I have to get to Mrs Dyer's classroom-I can't be late for her-\" He began to try and walk away. \"Hold on a second.\" Dakin stepped in front of him, blocking the path. He frowned, thick, dark eyebrows knitting together. \" Like patience on a monument, smiling at grief …\" Suddenly, Dakin gasped, hands flying to his mouth. \"You cannot be talking to Mr Hector- Mr Hector -about your fucking love life ?\" Scripps's heart raced even faster, thumping uncontrollably as if in danger of breaking down. \" No ! Of course not!\" he said quickly-but he knew his face was giving him away. He had never felt more claustrophobic and exposed in his life. \" Oh my fucking God !\" Dakin reeled backwards, eyes wide, hands still clasped to his mouth which muffled his voice ominously. \"You actually are. You actually fucking are !\" Scripps swallowed the rage that was building inside of him. He felt boiling hot. \"Fuck off, Dakin,\" he tried, pathetically. \"Of course I'm not-\" \"What are you asking him about?\" Dakin continued, giggling like a madman. \"The birds and the bees? As if Mr Hector would know the first thing about women-I don't care if he's married! Unless-\" Suddenly, Dakin became still. \"It's not a boy is it? That's not why you've gone to Hector, is it?\" Scripps said nothing-but he knew his face read like a book. \"I have to go,\" he mumbled, trying to walk away again. \"I have to get to-\" \" Fucking hell !\" Dakin clapped his hands, looking cruelly delighted, eyes round and shining nastily. \" Fucking hell !\" \"Leave me alone.\" Scripps muttered, finally managing to walk past him. He set off at an alarming pace along the corridor, wanting to put as much distance between him and Dakin as possible. His heart pounded against his shirt, as if he had just ran a marathon. Suddenly, he was burning up all over his body. \"It's not me , is it?\" Dakin shouted after him. \"Don't think I can deal with another little fan in History!\" \" No , Dakin, it's definitely not you.\" Scripps found his voice, which echoed across the hall. \"Who is it, then? Who the fuck is it?\" Dakin yelled-but Scripps had already turned the corner.[Chapter 14] Hello everyone. I apologise endlessly for the wait. I am incredibly busy, and it means so much to me that you have stuck with me. Thank you so much. I hope you enjoy this chapter, and I hope to have a much shorter gap before the next one. Thank you xxx \"Oh my God!\" Slamming the door behind him, Dakin stormed into Mr Irwin's classroom and fell dramatically down into his seat beside Timms. Posner's head snapped up, along with the other assembled boys. \"What the fuck?\" Timms looked half-amused, half concerned. The rest of the boys dropped what they were doing and leaned in to listen. Posner swallowed nervously. He had been trying so hard to pay less attention to Dakin, and it had worked wonders so far. But when he commandeered attention like this, it was difficult not to notice how handsome he was… stop it, stop it . He had made such good progress recently. Dakin might be gorgeous…but he was also a prat. As he was handily displaying. \"You guys are not going to believe this!\" Dakin slapped the back of his hand to his forehead dramatically. His face was the picture of shock-but his eyes were glinting. \"You are never going to believe this in a million years!\" \"What?\" Lockwood looked like he was about to wet himself with excitement. \"Don't fucking leave us in suspense like this!\" Timms shouted, banging Dakin on the back. Dakin grinned, obviously enjoying the spotlight-but quickly buried his face dramatically in his hands. \"Oh, oh, oh, it's happened again!\" he moaned, teasing them. \"It's so terrible!\" \"What is?\" Posner couldn't help himself. His voice was a tone higher than usual. \"Yeah, come on.\" Akthar drawled sarcastically, leant up on his elbows. \"It can't be that interesting.\" \"It is.\" Dakin sat up straight, looking around at the assembled boys, ready to embark his news. Posner noticed his eyes linger on him for a fraction longer than the others-but finally, after making them wait another tantalising moment-he pointed dramatically at Scripps' empty chair. \"Donald Scripps is in love with me!\" There was a short silence. Then- \"BULLSHIT!\" Timms yelled-then burst out laughing. \" Seriously ?\" Lockwood's jaw was practically on the floor. \"In love with you?\" \"You're fucking with us, right?\" Rudge's eyes were darting between Timms and Lockwood, as if trying to decide who to side with. \" Again ?\" Akthar shot a glance at Posner. Posner himself did not know what to think. The moment the words had passed Dakin's lips-it was as if he had been plunged into water, cut off from everyone else, his hearing lost, his vision impaired. Scrippsy ? In love with Dakin ? It couldn't be…or maybe it could be…What if he was? What if, all along…? Posner couldn't get his head around it. If Scripps was in love with Dakin, why didn't he tell him in the first place? They could have supported each other… But how did he feel about it? Posner was conflicted…just as he had begun to get over Dakin, his best friend had fallen for him…Posner frowned. Yes, he saw the attraction, of course he did. But…why didn't he want Scripps to be in love with Dakin? Why had his heart suddenly sunk to the bottom of his chest? \"I know!\" Dakin was shouting dramatically, basking in this new glory. \"I know! I'm a fucking man magnet!\" \" Scripps ?\" Lockwood was scratching his head. \"No…he just doesn't seem the type…he's so… Christian ,\" \"How do you know ?\" Crowther said, leaning forward. \"I got it out of him…well, sort of. But I worked it out.\" Dakin said vaguely, shaking his head, a sort of triumph around him. \"I can't fucking believe it...another one! Another little fan…\" Posner felt his cheeks burning. He suddenly felt very hot. Staring at the back of Scripps' empty chair, he wondered where on Earth he could be…and fought the urge to leave the classroom right that second to find and comfort him. Posner just couldn't understand why Scrippsy hadn't told him…He still could not work out how he felt about the whole affair, in general. There was no way he could get his head around it…Scripps and Dakin ? \"Well, we all know one thing.\" Dakin was declaring, preening. \"I must be making it incredibly hard for him not to wank!\" \"Right, settle down!\" The door swung open to reveal Irwin, who strode in, oblivious to the atmosphere. He banged his briefcase down onto the desk, making the boys jump. \"I thought we'd talk about the Pilgrimage of Grace today. And I don't want your \"It was an uprising which ultimately failed \"-if anyone says that in their next essay, I will wipe my arse with it-\" He stopped, turning around and taking in the boys' faces. \"Hey, who's been murdered?\" Timms let out an uncertain giggle. \"Urm…\" Lockwood bit his lip. \"Oh, come on !\" Irwin leaned back against the desk exasperatedly. \"What on Earth could have happened now? I swear to God, if this is the latest instalment of Dakin and Posner's sordid marriage saga…\" But before anyone could answer, the door swung open again to reveal Scripps. Instantly, there was silence. Head down, clearly trying to avoid anyone's eye, Scripps walked quickly to his seat, mumbling an apology to Irwin. With him, he brought an atmosphere as thick as soup. Posner watched his friend's slightly hunched shoulders, wanting nothing more than to run to him, give him a hug, tell him he knew how he felt, that everything was…well, not going to be alright, but certainly sometime may not be as bad as he felt now…but he could do nothing. Every eye bore into the back of Scripps' head, and Posner could tell his friend felt it. He squirmed in his seat on Scripps' behalf. \"We don't have time for this mucking around and taking the piss.\" Irwin was saying impatiently, taking a piece of chalk and writing \"The Pilgrimage of Grace\" on the blackboard in big, sweeping letters. \"We are going to have an academic, Oxbridge standard discussion about the rebellion, and at the end you are all going to tell me why the Pilgrimage was in fact successful !\" He underlined his words with a flourish. \"And if anyone so much as mentions bloody Auden , I will deal with you all as Robert Aske was dealt with.\" As the class gradually fell into historic debate, Posner ripped a piece of paper from his notebook and quickly scrawled. Are you really in love with Dakin? Posner xxx It seemed too direct, but he couldn't think of any other way to phrase it. Subtly, when Irwin's back was turned to write on the board, Posner threw it onto Scripps' Desk. As Scripps unfolded the note to read it, Posner saw him visibly recoil. He turned the note back and forth in his hands, shaking his head. Posner waited anxiously as Scripps finally took up his pen and scribbled a reply. He took far too long, and Posner was drumming his fingers nervously on the desk by the time Scripps tossed the scrap of paper back. No, I am not. Did he say that? Is that why everyone's being so weird? Oh Poz, I am the biggest idiot in the universe. He's got the complete wrong end of the stick. Scrippsy xxx Posner blinked uncertainly. He was confused-but relieved. Quickly, he wrote back: Oh good. I was hoping you didn't. Don't worry-we'll soon set the record straight again. Why are you an idiot? Poz xxx Don't worry about me, Poz, I can cope. You just worry about yourself. Scrippsy xxx Scrippsy, with all due respect, that is bollocks. You are so frustrating! Let me worry about you for a change! Look, you either tell me what's wrong, what on Earth has been bothering you so much recently, or I will force it out of you. It's a shame…you were in such a good mood this morning…Poz xxx There was a long pause. Posner half-listened to Irwin as Scripps' hand shot back and forth across the page. He had such nice hands…Posner frowned-why was he staring at Scripps' hands? He shook his head-but found himself watching again. They were such nice hands; clean, soft, warm, yet somehow strong and sturdy at the same time...Finally, the note landed back on his desk. Look, Poz, I am so grateful for your help. But honestly-I can't talk about it. Even if I did, I would sound like a fool. I have tried to tell you what the matter is, I swear-but I can never find the right words. Everything sounds stupid, and no amount of words can seem to convey what I am feeling. I want to tell you-God knows I want to-but I can't. I'm sorry. I really can't tell you what is wrong. Scrippsy xxx Posner read through this last note twice, trying to wring any meaning he could out of it. He found himself beginning to feel uneasy. Scrippsy, you're talking in riddles. I don't understand and I'm really concerned about you. Please tell me what's wrong, I can't bear this. Poz xxx Posner, I can't bear upsetting you. I honestly can't bear it. That is why I can't tell you. I can't bring myself to endanger your feelings. I care about you too much. Scrippsy xxx Posner let out an audible, exasperated sigh before frantically scrawling back: I DON'T CARE! You, Donald Scripps, are the most infuriating person in the world! Fuck off with all your caring stuff for once! I, David Posner, as your friend, as your best friend, who cares about you more than anything else in the world right now, implore you to tell me what is wrong! I don't care what it is, what you've done-no matter what, I am here for you! Do you understand? Poz xxx Scripps read and re-read David's latest note. His heart was pounding, as if he had just ran a long distance, and a strange, sick feeling was surging through his veins. The pen was gripped in his sweaty right hand as he tried with all his might to dare himself to write back… I love you. Scripps scribbled out the words before he could even re-read them, with such force that he almost tore through the paper. The ugly black lines obscured the beautiful words he longed to say…but he could not. He could not. At least not here. Not like this. Can I talk to you later? Scrippsy xxx Scripps waited anxiously for David's reply. A minute later, the note landed back on his desk, still warm from their hands. Of course. Oh Scrippsy, I can't stand seeing you like this. Please let me help you. Your Posner xxx He couldn't tell him. He couldn't. He didn't dare. Oi Scripps, do you really want Dakin's dick? Timms No, thank you. Fuck off. Scripps[Chapter 15] Hey everyone. Thank you so much as always for reading, reviewing and sticking with me-it means so much. I hope you enjoy this. As usual, I own nothing. Best wishes xxx \" Je renierais ma patrie Je renierais mes amis Si tu me le demandais On peut bien rire de moi Je ferais n'importe quoi [Je ferais n'importe quoi] Si tu me le demandais\" Scripps closed his eyes and allowed David's angelic voice to wash over him until it engulfed him completely. His fingers caressed the keys of the piano automatically, filled naturally with the same emotion that threatened to prickle behind his own eyes. Behind him, he felt David's presence at his shoulder, and it was celestial. As always, he felt that physical pull towards him, as if they could never be parted. Just like the song… \" Si un jour la vie t'arrache moi Si tu meurs que tu sois loin de moi Peu m'importe si tu m'aimes- oh !\" Suddenly, David stopped mid-flow as Scripps intoned an-ahem -unusual chord that certainly was not part of the notation. Scripps swore under his breath as the music stopped, quickly re-arranging his hands into a more correct position. \"I'm so sorry!\" David giggled, sounding slightly shaken. Scripps loved the awed, other-world feel his voice always took after he had sung. \"Don't worry!\" he was saying, half-amused. \"It's not a crime.\" \"I was just so into it…\" Scripps admitted, twisting on the stool to look at his companion. David laughed softly. \"Me too…\" Scripps allowed himself to gaze at David for a moment, taking him in. \"Yeah…\" he murmured. David's eyes were wide and shining as he looked back into Scripps'…Quickly, before he could become too absorbed, Scripps wound back around to face the piano. \"Shall we carry on?\" \"Oh-yes, okay!\" David's voice was slightly distant. \"Can we take it from the beginning of that verse? I like it so much.\" He reached down to turn the page back, brushing Scripps' shoulder with his hand as he did so. Scripps felt as though he had been touched by a higher being, some power he did not understand. His heart glowed. Shaking his head slightly and trying to focus his mind back on the music, he played the predeceasing bar before nodding David in. \" Si un jour la vie t'arrache moi Si tu meurs que tu sois loin de moi Peu m'importe si tu m'aimes Car moi je mourrais aussi…\" ... A lot had changed for Posner. His brain pounded against his skull as if it were composed of a thousand bats, desperate to escape. Tiredness prickled behind his eyes, reminding him of his sleeplessness. He had tossed and turned all night, plagued by these persistent thoughts in his head. He had tried to make sense of it all…and failed. Scripps … Posner could not fathom it. Seeing his friend so vulnerable, so clearly upset, utterly refusing to disclose to him what was wrong…and yet still so selfless with it. Caring only for others-as usual. Scenes flitted across the screen inside his mind; Scripps looking after his sisters; Scripps helping that poor; slow boy to read; Scripps caring for him when he was sad; listening to him for hours, then making him laugh and feel okay again; Scripps laughing; Scripps swooping down to help him carry his books; the joy in his whole being as he played the piano…the montage played over and over again…in spite of whatever was bothering him so intensely. The Herculean effort was almost unbearable…and yet somehow, Posner couldn't tear his eyes away. It was all so abrupt . Scripps was one of the most inspiring people he had ever met; always ready to help someone, generous in every way-especially with his time. Posner had always admired Scripps…but he did more than ever now. In many more ways than he had thought possible. Posner had always been dimly aware that his friend was handsome ; however his mind had never focused on that aspect of him. Scrippsy was simply Scrippsy-the exterior was irrelevant because the interior was all that mattered. But recently-since his mind and heart had become increasing purged of the colossus of Dakin -he had begun to notice Scripps more and more. When Scripps had smiled at him just now, looking at him with those deep, warm brown eyes…he had felt his heart give a small flutter. He could barely concentrate as he sang. The French words rolled off his tongue with ease as usual, but he could not take his eyes away from Scripps. He couldn't understand. It was as if they were magnetic, being pulled together by some unearthly force…he couldn't explain it. There was an unexplicable urge in his right hand to reach out and touch him…again. When he had brushed Scripps' shoulder, he had almost gasped aloud-it was like an electric shock. Scripps seemed to draw him in like a blazing fireplace on a cold winter's day. The electric current between them had not ceased since they had broken contact-Posner remained distinctly aware of it as he began to sing the final verse. \" Nous aurons pour nous l'eternite Dans le bleu de toute l'immensite Dans le ciel plus de problemes Mon amour, crois-tu qu'on s'aime? Dieu re-unit ceux qui s'aiment… \" As Scripps played the final bars, Posner breathed deeply, acutely aware of his heart pounding in his chest as if demanding freedom… He was so confused. It was almost unbearable. Irwin shuffled the papers on his desk for the fourth time that period. It was an unnecessary action, but the Headmaster seemed to be walking past his window more times than the law of averages allowed for. He assumed he was being spied on to ensure he was correctly using his non-contact lessons efficiently, and the menial reorganisation of the pile of already-marked essays masked the fact that he was not being productive. He paused, gazing at the paper that had landed on top this time. Stuart Dakin , read the name at the top, followed by a four-page essay, the second longest of any of the boys. Irwin studied the boy's work, noting how he made his \"g\"s the same way Irwin himself did. He compared Dakin's writing to his own red notes in the margins. It was becoming strikingly similar to his own…Trying not to read too much into it, he wondered if it had been too harsh to cross out an entire paragraph… It had been a long day. A long term . Occasionally in the past hour, he had attempted to pick up his notebook to plan a lesson, or make notes, or anything that was not simply sitting here, staring at the clock on the wall and trying not to catch the Headmaster's eye. Suddenly, there was a knock on the door. A small, shy knock. \"Wha-\" Irwin's head snapped up. \"Yes, come in!\" he called, trying to snap himself out of the sleepy trace he had found himself in. The door swung open to admit a small sixth form boy with mousy hair and an anxious expression. \"Oh-hello, Posner!\" Instantly, Irwin felt nervous. He thought worriedly of the last time Posner had come to see him alone… \"What can I do for you?\" he asked, half-dreading the answer. Posner had already crossed the room and sat down at the desk closest to his own. He looked wide-eyed up at Irwin, clutching the strap of his bag like a life support. He opened his mouth-then closed it again, licking his lips tensely. Alarm bells rang in Irwin's head. \"Posner?\" he prompted him, trying to adopt an adult's tone-he always had to resist the urge to speak to Posner like the youngster he resembled rather than the eighteen-year-old he was. \"Is something wrong? Not more marriage troubles?\" he joked desperately, trying to lighten the atmosphere the boy had brought with him. Still, Posner said nothing. He opened his mouth again-then seemed to swallow the words he was forming. Irwin coughed awkwardly. \"I just marked all of your essays!\" he said, attempting to make conversation, indicating the small pile on his desk. \"Congratulations-yours was not the dullest! A commendable feat-though perhaps it did not have satisfactory competition. Yours was the longest as well, as a matter of-\" \"Sir?\" Posner suddenly blurted out. \"I-I find myself confused. About-something.\" Instantly, Irwin's guard went up. He was touched that Posner saw fit to come to him with his troubles…though the nature of his problems often drew attention to uncomfortable skeletons in Irwin's own closet… no pun intended , Irwin thought fleetingly. He sighed. \"Look, Posner, you're only eighteen, you really don't need to worry about labelling yourself with a specific sexuality yet, just give it time, and-\" \"No, it's not about that, sir.\" Relief swam through Irwin's veins, which he tried not to show. Posner's eyes were round, and so serious looking it was almost amusing. But the corner of his lip trembled with nerves. \"Okay.\" Irwin began again. \"Are you going to tell me the, erm, problem?\" Posner swallowed hard, before licking his lips again. \"Sir…what does it mean when...how do you…\" Irwin chuckled, more out of awkwardness than anything else. \"For someone as articulate as yourself, you have a great deal of trouble expressing yourself verbally. Not a good trait to have when it comes to interviews-\" \"Is it possible to think you love one person, then think you start falling for someone else? Is that normal?\" Posner rattled off, so fast Irwin could not answer straight away. He blinked uncertainly. \"Is this…Dakin…again?\" It was horribly inappropriate how sweet the boy's name tasted in Irwin's mouth. \"I'm sorry, sir, I just need to vent to someone.\" Posner said. His eyes had become misty- please God, don't let him cry . \"And you're the only person I can trust,\" the boy continued shakily. Irwin coughed again. \"Erm…moving as that is, Posner…are you sure?\" \"Yes.\" Posner said certainly. \"Can't you-\" Irwin searched desperately for any possible escape route. \"Can't you talk to Scripps about this? He's your friend, isn't he-?\" Suddenly, Posner's whole face had changed. His eyes grew cloudier. \"No, I can't talk to Scripps, sir…\" Irwin pressed his lips together, wishing he knew less about his boys' personal lives. He looked fleetingly at the window, wondering whether he could jump out of it. \"Oh, sir, I'm so sorry, but I'm so confused!\" Posner burst out. His voice was becoming ominously thick. \"If I don't talk to someone, I will burst. It's all too sudden …\" Stretching and seeing that there was no way out of this, Irwin knew he would have to suck it up. Bracing himself, he reached into the draw of his desk and recovered an old box of tissues, which he placed tactfully in front of his distressed student. \"So…\" He tried to distance himself from the reality of the situation, and try and deal with this as best he could. For fuck's sake, he was a history teacher-not an effing councillor . \"You thought you liked-( Irwin could not bring himself to use the word love )-Dakin…and now you think you like someone else?\" Posner nodded, blinking rapidly. \"Well, that's just fine!\" Irwin made his tone falsely bright. \"Posner, I know you're new to all of this, but that's completely normal. Really, I don't see why you're so worried about it. People like one person…and then they move on. It happens every day. Really, there's no need to beat yourself up about it!\" \"No, sir, it's more complicated than that…\" Posner's voice shook slightly. Isn't it always? \"Really?\" Irwin wished again that he was anywhere else in the world but here. \"Why?\" \"Because I don't even know whether I like the some else properly-like I did Dakin-or whether I'm just confused and trying to lay my feelings onto someone now that I have \"moved on\" from Dakin…and worse.\" Posner gulped. \"It's someone else in our class.\" Irwin gulped himself. God, he did not need to know this … \"Oh. Really?\" he said again, trying to sound off-hand. Posner's eyes now looked firmly damp. \"Will I always fall for people I can't have, sir?\" he said forlornly. \"Is that another of my curses? Besides being small, Jewish, homosexual and from Sheffield , I have to be continuously unlucky in love?\" Irwin coughed again to cover up the nervous laugh which almost bubbled out of him. \"Erm-I think you may be slightly over-dramatizing it there…\" Irwin commented-before hastily reeling himself back in. He didn't want to make Posner uncomfortable-he just needed him to go. Right now. This conversation was far, far too close to home for Irwin today. \"Look, Posner, there really is no formula for this. It's not like history-you have to live it. Experience it.\" Wow. That was deep. \"So maybe you like this other boy now-and maybe you'll decide you don't. That's okay. You don't have to become obsessed with it. Just let life happen, Posner. You don't always have to be certain of things.\" Posner sniffed hard-but he nodded. \"I just don't want to ruin another friendship.\" \"I know…\" Irwin sympathised-just as the bell, mercifully rang. As Posner thanked him and hurried off to his next lesson-Irwin slumped down into his seat, letting out a long, frustrated breath he had been supressing all day. Maybe if he had grown a moustache, he would have looked less fucking approachable … Irwin pushed open the staffroom door and instantly made a bee-line for the coffee machine. He wished stronger drinks were permitted on campus-it would not surprise him if Mrs Lintott had a bottle of something stashed in her desk for days like this…would it be completely inappropriate to ask her? \"Oh, hello,\" came a regal, slightly cold voice from behind him. Irwin spun around as the coffee began to brew to find Mr Hector sat in his usual chair, apparently just coming round from a period of deep contemplation. Irwin smiled wanly-he was always slightly intimidated by the older man. \"Hello. How are you?\" he asked weakly. \"Oh, well enough.\" Hector said vaguely, in his usual, mysterious way. He noted the large measure of coffee Irwin was now pouring himself, with large spoonfuls of sugar. \"Bad morning?\" \"Sort of.\" Irwin took a gulp, finding it too hot and far too sweet, but not caring. \"Long. Trying.\" \" Trying ?\" Hector gave a reminiscent chuckle. \"I doubt any of our boys could try me these days…I must have seen it all by now.\" \"Want to bet?\" Irwin muttered into his mug. Hector cocked his ear, some of the coldness melting. He indicated the seat next to him. Slightly wary, Irwin took it. There was always something in Hector's expression he couldn't quite read, some worldly wisdom, coupled with a sort of sadness that always took him by surprise. \"Go on.\" Hector prompted, kindly, as if dealing with a student. \"Like I said, I've heard it all.\" \"Probably not this.\" Taking another mouthful of coffee and a deep breath, Irwin half-reluctantly began: \"Posner's having a few problems, you see.\" \"Oh- is he now?\" Suddenly, Hector sat up straight, looking much more interested. \"What kind of problems?\" \"Erm…just general life problems-\" \" Love ?\" Hector asked eagarly. Irwin blinked nervously. \"…Yes, as a matter of fact-\" Suddenly, Hector laughed out loud, slapping his knee. \"That is remarkable ! You know, young Scripps was talking to me just the other week about exactly the same thing!\" Irwin tried unsuccessfully to fathom wherein exactly Hector's new excitement lay. \"Oh, really?\" he said, trying to sound casual. \"There must be something in the water…\" Then, abruptly, he remembered. \"As a matter of fact, Scripps was mentioned in my conversation with Posn-\" \" Really ?\" Hector exclaimed, so loud that several maths teachers in the corner turned to look at them. But the old man didn't notice, his grin stretching worryingly. \"In what context?\" Irwin was entirely taken aback. \"Well…\" he proceeded cautiously. \"Posner said that he had fallen for a classmate-\" \"Not Dakin this time?\" Hector asked, smile still firmly in place. \"No-how did you-?\" \"Oh, Irwin, my dear boy, I think the entire city knew of Posner's infatuation!\" Hector said, almost bouncing up and down. \"I am not oblivious! But what of Scripps?\" he implored, seemingly desperate for information. \"And-and I asked him why he came to me instead of Scripps, whom he seems to be friends with, and he said-\" \"Yes?\" Hector asked eagerly, face lighting up even more. \"-that he couldn't talk to Scripps about it. Although I still can't see why not-\" Hector let out a small, delighted sort of squeal. His eyes were no more than slits as his beam threatened to split his face in half. \"Oh, this is marvellous !\" \"What?\" Irwin was more confused than ever. \"Hec- what's marvellous?\" Hector continued to grin a mile wide. \"Isn't it obvious ?\" \"N- what?\" Irwin felt acutely worried. But Hector seemed not to care. He chuckled, cheeks now tinged pink with pleasure. \"Is it any wonder you don't teach mathematics when you cannot even put two and two together? Has all of your education numbed your basic, human senses?\" Elation was crackling all over the old man. He laughed again, seemingly full of the greatest joy that Irwin simply could not understand. \"Oh, the young, skinny love! How simply heavenly !\" \" Skinny love ?\" Irwin was more befuddled than ever. \"What's that?\" \"Never mind, Irwin, don't you worry your head about it!\" Hector stood up. Suddenly, his smile was quite different. There was a sort of cunning, like a sly old fox. Irwin could almost see his impressive brain whirring behind his spectacles. \"Don't you worry about it at all. If it proves so, then loving goes by haps; Some Cupids kills with arrows, some with traps !\" he sang, giggling to himself. \"Now, let me make you another coffee…\"[Chapter 16] Hello everyone. I apologize so much for not posting for a ridiculously long time. It means so much to me that you've stuck with me despite me deserting you :( I basically haven't been in England for weeks...But thank you so much for reading, and I hope you forgive me and like this. The next chapters will follow far more quickly, I promise! Love to you all xxx This chapter is dedicated to Vinyaya-thank you so much for being so lovely and noticing things! Means the world to me. I hope you continue to enjoy, and its lovely to see someone who loves \"The History Boys\" like me! PS: I don't own the poem used in this chapter :') Posner knocked habitually on the door of Hector's classroom, knowing it would be locked. He waited, but no reply came. Frowning, he checked his watch-Mr Hector had arranged to meet with him at this time, for their weekly poetry discussion. He knocked again, slightly anxious. \"Hey! Posner!\" Spinning around, Posner suddenly found Timms and Lockwood, hurrying along the corridor to catch up with him. Both wore grins like Cheshire cats, and held their arms folded as they skidded to a halt. Posner was put in mind of many famous comedy duos. \"Posner, you're, like, besties with Scripps, right?\" Timms was saying, with a significant smirk at Lockwood. \"…Right?\" Posner replied, apprehensive. He was surprised to find that his heart had done a small backflip at the sound of Scripps' name. Stupid, stupid, stupid. \"Is it true that he's-\" Timms broke off, spluttering again. \"in love with Dakin?\" Posner felt as if a rock had dropped to the pit of his stomach, as he stared into the two smug faces before him. \"No.\" he answered shortly. \" Oooooohh !\" Timms squealed in falsetto, to Lockwood's delight, as Posner's cheeks burned. \"Getting defensive are we?\" \"It's a proper little love triangle, isn't it?\" Lockwood smirked down at him,. \"You love Dakin, Scripps loves Dakin, Dakin loves Dakin-\" \"Fuck off.\" Posner spat, crossing his arms over his scorching chest and racing heart. He looked determinedly at the floor, feeling his cheeks burning. Trying to distance himself from Timms' grinning face he could see out of the corner of his eye, he willed Mr Hector to open the door as quickly as possible. Or for Timms to go away. Or for the floor to open and swallow him. \"-it's worse than a bloody soap opera!\" Timms was saying, as Lockwood snickered. \"Anyway, see you around, Pozzy.\" Posner did not look up as the two clowns strolled away, still making crass jokes. He hated being called Pozzy. He wasn't even a fan of being called Poz, but that was different because it was Scripps' name for him… Stupid, stupid, stupid . Posner shook his head as if to attempt to expel Scripps' handsome face and ready laughter from his mind. He sighed, clenching his fists subconsciously. The less he felt for bloody Dakin, the more he seemed to fall for his best friend…or maybe it was the other way around. But the pain. The pain . Finally, the door swung open to reveal a smiling man in a pinstriped suit and bow tie, glasses sitting on the bridge of his nose as usual. \"Ah, Posner,\" Mr Hector's eyes twinkled down at him-more brightly than Posner had ever seen them. The old teacher seemed uncharacteristically delighted to see him. Posner felt suddenly ill at ease. \"Do come in. I apologise for the delay, but…\" As Mr Hector moved aside to allow Posner into the room, he revealed a light-brown-haired boy sat on a desk, clutching a copy of Larkin's complete works and wearing an expression of upmost astonishment. Scripps' eyes widened even further as he regarded Posner-whose heart flipped right over in his chest. The two boys stared at each other, as if hardly daring to believe that the other was not a mirage. Posner felt his whole body glow as he gazed into Scripps' eyes-and Scripps gazed right back. \"I hope you don't mind young Scripps joining us today?\" Mr Hector was saying, seemingly from a great distance away. Posner blinked, and with a jolt he was back in the room. He tore his eyes from Scripps to look at his teacher. Mr Hector was maintaining a practised teacher-ly manner-but his eyes shone brighter than candles, and his voice had an edge of immense self-satisfaction, as if he had just began to accomplish a great personal goal. \"I seem to have accidently pencilled you both in at the same time. How silly of me!\" he said, the corner of his mouth twitching. \"You must forgive me-it can only be attributed to my mere Sheffield education.\" Scripps still looked slightly shell-shocked-but his face broke into a friendly, apologetic smile, which Posner gratefully returned. He hung his bag up beside Scripps' on a peg and sat down at a desk. \"Come, come, let us be sociable!\" Mr Hector gestured for Scripps to sit beside Posner with a theatrical sweep of his arm-and a subtle wink at Scripps, which made his skin crawl. The calculated set-up by the old man made Scripps feel a little nauseous-he had seen the situation for what it was the moment that the door had swung open, like the gates of Heaven, to reveal David Posner. Hector's smirk said it all. Scripps' cheeks burned unpleasantly-he felt like a laboratory or circus animal. Slightly reluctantly, he made his way over and sank into the seat beside David. The whole right side of his body seemed to feel warmer due to its proximity to the boy Scripps loved. \"Hi,\" David whispered to him, as Mr Hector rummaged in his bag for a book. \"H-hi,\" Scripps whispered back, his voice unnaturally high. \"Alright?\" he said, attempting to get back to an outward normality. Oh God, what if David realised what Hector was up to? Every fibre of Scripps' being tightened at that horrible prospect. \"Yeah. You?\" David offered him a small smile, which Scripps couldn't help but return. The dimple on David's cheek triggered that supernatural force that drew him towards him, irresistibly. Before Scripps could reply, Mr Hector had straightened up. He twinkled down at Scripps, like an uncle surveying a favourite nephew. \"Now,\" he said, with another indulgent smile. \"I thought we'd move on from Larkin to something a little older today.\" Hector placed an open book on the desk in front of Scripps. \"I trust you are familiar with Dante Gabriel Rossetti?\" David and Scripps nodded in unison-something which gave the latter an acute jerk in his stomach. \"The artist?\" David asked. \"Pre-Raphaelite?\" \"Yes, yes!\" Mr Hector beamed at David. \"But also poet, as you can see.\" He patted the book. \"Here is a favourite of mine.\" \" The House of Life 19. Silent Noon ,\" David read aloud. \"Yes, indeed!\" Mr Hector nodded, then launched into a lengthy anecdote about the poem. Scripps tried his best to listen, intensely aware of David's perfect, soft hand inches from his own. His breath was coming out in shallow, short bursts, as if his chest would otherwise fly open and his heart would fall out onto the floor. With a Herculean force, he kept his own hand from taking it and not letting go. Posner was concentrating so hard on Mr Hector that he didn't take in a single word. All of his might was spent keeping his hand firmly on the desk and not sliding it into Scripps' perfect, soft hand, so seamlessly slightly larger than his. He longed to know if it felt as strong and steady as it looked. Pushing his lips tightly together, he dug the tips of his fingers into the desktop and tried not to listen to Scripps breathing quietly beside him. \"…but of course, the only way to really appreciate a poem is to read it aloud!\" Mr Hector declared loudly, bringing Scripps abruptly back to earth. \"Now, I would read it to you myself, but I have an errand to run in the staffroom.\" The teacher had already begun to move towards the door with the air of a man keen to get away. Scripps frowned-this was most unlike him. Usually, he adored reading aloud-or being read to. But Hector had picked up his briefcase. \"Sir?\" Scripps asked, noting David's expression of confusion in equal measure beside him. \"Why don't you read it aloud to young Posner, Scripps?\" Mr Hector suggested, as casually as he could muster, one hand already on the door knob. \"I'm sure you will both-ah-benefit from it. Now-I will be return presently to hear your thoughts.\" With one foot outside the door, the old man gave a regal wave. \"Farewell!\" he called, shutting the door firmly behind him. To his amazement, Scripps heard the outside lock turn. Shaken by the teacher's abrupt and uncharacteristic exit, Scripps leaned back in his seat, unsure how to proceed. Here he was…alone…with David… \"…So?\" David's voice cut through his thoughts like a bell. Scripps turned to him, smiling involuntarily. Sometimes he got so lost in his thoughts of David that he forgot that the real thing was right here beside him. \"…Are we going to read this?\" \"Erm…yeah, I guess.\" Scripps coughed awkwardly. \"Er…do you…do you want me to-?\" \"Yes!\" David answered at lightning speed-then he looked adorably embarrassed. Catching one another's eye, they both laughed softly. Scripps felt the pulling sensation that seemed to exist between them triple as he stated at that impossible dimple on his left cheek. He permitted himself to gaze at him again-in his fascination, he barely registered that David gazed back. \"Well, okay then. Anything for you.\" he finally said, as if joking. His eyes quickly scanned the pastoral poem before him, before he cleared his throat and began, slowly, to read aloud: \"Your hands lie open in the long fresh grass,— The finger-points look through like rosy blooms: Your eyes smile peace.\" With more passion, Scripps read on, the beautiful words transporting him away. He heared David Posner take a deep, long breath beside him, and felt his heart glow. It poured from his mouth in Rossetti's words. \"The pasture gleams and glooms 'Neath billowing skies that scatter and amass. All round our nest, far as the eye can pass, Are golden kingcup fields with silver edge Where the cow-parsley skirts the hawthorn-hedge. 'Tis visible silence, still as the hour-glass. Deep in the sun-searched growths the dragon-fly Hangs like a blue thread loosened from the sky:— So this wing'd hour is dropt to us from above. Oh! clasp we to our hearts, for deathless dower, This close-companioned inarticulate hour When twofold silence was the song of love.\" Scripps finished, breathing hard. He looked up from the page to see David staring straight back into his eyes. His eyes were misty, as if, like Scripps, he felt that he had somehow glimpsed another world. Neither spoke. In a burst of courage, Scripps moved his hand a few inches closer to David's...which did not pull away. Noiselessly, he covered it with his own hand. The meeting of their skin caused a small explosion in Scripps' chest. David drew a short, sharp breath...He had not taken his eyes away from Scripps. Fireworks, music, every extreme weather condition blared in Scripps' brain...and yet there was silence at the same time. Complete stillness and silence, as if the world had come to a stop. There was a shift. Suddenly, and quite without meaning to, David had leaned forward. His beautiful eyes widened, as if he had surprised himself with the action. There was a longing in his eyes, which Scripps knew he matched. Almost subconsciously, Scripps obeyed that celestial force pulling them together, and leaned closer, until their faces almost...but not quite...touched. Still, there was silence in everything but the thudding of their hearts. Together, in a single action, so new and yet performed as if carried out one thousand times...Scripps' lips met Davids.[Chapter 17] Hello everyone. Sorry this has taken so long again! It means so much that you have stuck with me. Big love to you all and I hope you are all well and happy. Thank you for the reviews as well-always lovely when people are so generous :') Thank you for reading Xxxx Scripps quite forgot that he was sat on a plastic chair behind a battered, graffiti-spotted desk. He forgot that he was in school, in Mr Hector's classroom. He even forgot that the old teacher would be on his way back any second. All he knew was that he held that miraculous hand of David Posner's, that he felt the gentle heat from his body, drank in his warm, clean smell…and most importantly, that those lips, those lips that had longed to know the shape and feel of, were now pressed softly against his own. It was an ineffable experience. It was as though Scripps had left his body behind, despite those incredible sensations he felt, and had ceased to be ruled by gravity or the laws of physics. He even forgot to question how or why this was happening-it was, and that was all that mattered. All he knew was that it could never be long enough- Suddenly, the kiss broke. Scripps did not know who had broken it, but he found himself face to face with David. There was a long, pregnant silence. David's eyes were wide and looked slightly shocked, and even a little scared…but a smile slowly broke through, like the sun behind clouds. Scripps felt his own features return it, without his instruction. He wanted to speak, to tell David exactly how he felt at this precise moment, how the sheer air seemed different, how the colours around them were both brighter and dimmer at the same time, how his heart beamed inside his chest…but he said nothing. Instead, he let the moment resonate as long as he possibly could, bathing in the glorious silence and the traces of David still on his lips. After what could have been seconds, or a lifetime, David's lips finally parted. \"…Scripps?\" His voice sounded misty and distant, the question innocent, born of pure surprise. Suddenly, Scripps had to fight the urge to laugh. It was an expression of sheer joy, pure elation and relief, as if the tightest belt in the world had unbuckled forever. \" Posner ?\" he whispered back, mimicking David's hazy tone-at which both boys burst out laughing for a few seconds. It was like the two sat in the aftermath of a terrible storm, or an earthquake, and were simply happy to be alive together. Scripps felt the tension beginning to melt away as he gazed back at the amazing person who sat before him, giggling. \"Scripps, I…\" David managed to find his voice, a last laugh bubbling out of him. He was staring hard at Scripps, as if terrified he'd disappear if he tore his eyes away for a moment. \"I'm just-I don't know what to-\" He broke off, shaking his head, that disbelieving smile still in place. \"Me neither.\" Scripps had almost forgotten that they were still holding hands. He stroked David's smooth palm, like a fortune-teller reading the lines. He felt tongue-tied himself. It was funny-in the moments when there were thousands of words to say, he could find none. \"I just-I just can't-\" David was still stammering. He took a deep breath, collecting himself. \"I can't believe that just happened!\" he half-sighed. \"Me neither,\" Scripps repeated, meaning it. The elation had made him feel brave. \"Did you-I mean, did you want it to happen?\" \"Yes!\" David said, far too quickly and eagerly-at which they both laughed again. Scripps' heart was beating so fast, he was amazed that it did not break down. However, he had never felt so relaxed at the same time. \"D-did you?\" David finally asked. \"Yes,\" Scripps answered, more seriously. \"Yes, I did.\" His sincere tone made David pause. His eyes shone even brighter. \"Really?\" he squeaked, sounding amazed. \"Yes!\" Scripps grinned back, squeezing his hand. David blinked rapidly, eyelashes fluttering. \"Oh!\" He took a moment to think about it. \"I-I thought you might just have wanted to, you know, see what it was like, or something?\" \"No!\" Scripps shook his head. \"No! You're not an experiment, David.\" David frowned slightly, dazed smile still in place. \"You called me David? Not Posner?\" \"I don't know why,\" Scripps admitted. \"Since…well, my brain just started calling you David when I…when I began to like you.\" he tailed off, softening the truth. David's surprise turned to pure astonishment. \"You-you liked me?\" he stuttered. Suddenly, Scripps's stomach twisted. \"Y-yes…\" he managed. \"Yes.\" he repeated more definitely. \"Let's make that present tense. I like you. I like you almost more than I can bear.\" He coughed nervously. \" More than I can bear. It's been ages, and it's been the hardest thing in the world to hide, because I didn't know what you'd think-\" \"I like you too!\" David burst out, cutting Scripps off-but the other boy couldn't care less. A feeling of ecstasy like nothing he'd ever experienced was spreading through his whole body as those words left the person he loved more than anything in the world. To be liked back…to be liked back by the one he loved...there was nothing like it. \"I've been trying to hide it too,\" David was saying, his eyes suddenly glistening with tears, his whole face positively glowing. \"I thought you-I didn't think-but you do! You do!\" \"I do,\" Scripps brought David's trembling hand to his lips and kissed it tenderly, then more fiercely. \"I do so much.\" \"I'd-I'd never have thought you did!\" David stammered, holding tightly to Scripps. \"Really?\" Scripps grinned wider. \"I thought I did a lousy job hiding it. Every time you are with me…I just can't help it.\" He kissed him again, savouring each one as if it were the last. \"I can't believe it.\" David murmured. \"I can't believe you do.\" \"How could I not?\" Scripps kissed David's hand a final time, then reached across to gently stroke his face. \"You are the most incredible person I have ever met. You are kind, funny, generous, clever, pure and good…and absolutely gorgeous to boot,\" he added, with a smile. David's eyes popped in shock. He looked so comic that Scripps laughed and felt his heart swell with love. \"…I am?\" David was genuinely surprised. \"Of course you are,\" Scripps traced his cheekbone. \"You are the most amazing person in the world.\" \"But I thought the same about you!\" David sat up straighter, his voice. \"I didn't realise what was staring me in the face all these years. You are…\" His voice trailed off, as he reached out his own hand to stroke Scripps' cheek. Scripps quivered at his touch, as he watched David struggling to find the words he sought. Eventually, he gave up, with a sigh. \"You were sent for me, Scrippsy. I know that much. The way you've cared for me, looked after me, kept me happy, gave me a reason to get up in the morning and carry on…It came to me slowly. But Scrippsy, I fell for you all at once when it did.\" Scripps scarcely dared to believe that he was not dreaming. He willed time to stop so he could stay there, in the empty classroom with David, for the rest of his life. He neither knew nor cared what would happen next. The only thing that mattered was the present. \"Can I kiss you again?\" David suddenly asked, an impish grin playing around his lips. \"God, I think I should die if you don't!\" Scripps laughed as he closed his eyes.[Chapter 18] Hello! It's been a long while but I'm back! Hope you enjoy this chapter :) I promise I'll update again soon xxx Kissing Scripps was more wondrous than Posner had dared imagine. He did not know how many times their lips had met-each kiss seemed to flow into the next like a waterfall. When he had pictured kissing Dakin all those nights when he was alone he had worried and worried about what it would feel like, what he should do, whether he would be good enough a kisser not to disappoint him. But with Scripps, it was the most natural thing in the world. He held tightly to the soft yet work- roughened hand wrapped safely around his own. Dakin's lips looked smooth and perfect, while Scripps' were slightly chapped but Posner couldn't care less. They were far warmer and more real. Dizzily, Posner realised his hand had reached out to wrap around Scripps' waist, pulling himself closer to him and deepening the kiss. Posner could scarcely believe what was happening, happily knowing the disbelief was shared by Scripps, who had begun to tenderly stroke Posner's hair, burying his fingers in it. Bliss filled Posner as he kissed him joyfully. Dakin's body was so effortlessly chiselled, all hard outlines and smooth surfaces, while Posner felt the slight softness of Scripps's belly around his waist, not so toned as those strong arms Posner had noticed before. It was just so real … like Dakin was cold, hard plastic, unattainable, while Scripps was warm, full of life in Posner's arms. And kissing him…. After what was realistically a few minutes but may as well have been centuries, or seconds, or millennia, their lips finally fell away from one another. Posner found himself beaming, gazing into Scripps's warm, dark eyes. The crinkles around them told him that Scripps was beaming right back. He squeezed his hand. \"Alright?\" \" Alrigh t?\" Posner exclaimed, voice raising. \" Alright ? You're asking me now if I'm \" alright \"?\" Scripps laughed, burying his face in the hand that wasn't holding Posner's. \"I'm only a few inches away, you know! No need to shout,\" \"How can I not!\" Posner's blood was racing in excitement. \"Scrippsy, I'm so… happy !\" Scripps laughed again. \"I'm so pleased.\" \"How can you be so calm !\" Posner gripped Scripps' hand in both of his. \"I can't believe it!\" \"I know.\" Scripps laughed. \"Neither can I. Believe me, I am the opposite of calm.\" \"Then act like it!\" Posner leaned forward to kiss his cheek. \"I can hardly sit still!\" Scripps laughed on, shaking his head. \"As you wish.\" Suddenly, Scripps stood up and lifted Posner clean out of his chair. Posner cried out in surprise as Scripps scooped him up in a bridal carry. Grinning, he spun Posner around and around, dancing them around the desks. \"I'M SO HAPPY!\" Scripps shouted as loudly as he could, his voice echoing off the walls and into the hall outside. \"Scripps! Put me down!\" Posner screamed in protest. \"What on earth are you doing?\" \"I thought you wanted me to be excited!\" Scripps teased him, still holding him close in his strong arms. \"Okay, less excited than this!\" Posner couldn't help giggling. It was so wonderful to be held, his whole body quivered. Scripps grinned down at him. \"Do you remember at Dakin's party when I carried you to bed like this?\" \"No?\" Posner frowned. Scripps chuckled. \"Yeah, you wouldn't do. All that vodka…You weighed a ton up those stairs!\" \"Put me down this instant, Scrippsy or you will regret it immensely.\" Still laughing, Scripps placed him gently back in his chair and sat down next to him. \"I am so happy though, David, you have no idea.\" Scripps took his hand again. \"You have no idea…\" \"David.\" Posner giggled. \"I can't get used to you calling me that.\" \"I'll stop if you don't like it.\" Scripps smiled back at him, eyes so soft they melted Posner's heart. \"Oh Scrippsy, you could call me Daffy Duck right now and I wouldn't care.\" Posner squeezed his hand. \"I like it when you call me David. It feels very…grown up…Hey!\" He frowned slightly as Scripps creased up laughing again. \"What?\" \"You.\" Scripps shook his head, still gazing at him with those soft, crinkled eyes. \"You're so funny.\" He put on a high-pitched voice. \" Oh Scrippsy, it's so grown up, like we're in Brief Encounter …\" \"Hey!\" Posner tried to be annoyed but couldn't help laughing. \"You're not supposed to say things like that right now!\" \"I can't act normal, I can't make jokes, what can I do?\" Scripps grinned, leaning on the desk on one elbow. \"You're supposed to be all romantic and sweet and whisper sweet nothings- what ?\" Scripps was doubled over laughing. \"It's official. You've read too much poetry. Oh, come here.\" Scripps took Posner in his arms. Posner closed his eyes, holding tight to Scripps, kissing his cheek… \"Hem- hem \" As the voice came from the doorway, the two boys sprang apart. Both boys were shot back to their senses, catapulted back into Mr Hector's classroom. But it was too late. Hector strode into the room, looking every bit the proverbial cat in possession of the largest vat of cream ever. The indulgent grin on his face was almost sickly as the boys tried to look innocent in vain. \" Bonjour indeed, mes petits enfants .\" Hector grinned smugly, sitting down at his desk. \"Well, well…\" Incredibly uncomfortable, Posner could feel his cheeks blushing scarlet-but this only seemed to titillate Hector more. He chuckled merrily. \"Please, continue reading the poem, Scripps. I'm sure I'm not too late to hear the final lines.\" \"Er…\" Scripps sounded every bit as uneasy as Posner. \"We finished it, sir\" \"Of course you did.\" Hector twinkled at the boys, making their stomachs churn uncomfortably. \"Well, off you trot then. It would seem that today's lesson is well and truly learned.\" He winked at Posner, who blushed even deeper. \"Come on, pip pip. Time to go home. Unless-\" Quick as lightening, Scripps and Posner had said goodbye and ran from the classroom, charging down the empty hallways together, bags banging on their backs, gazing at one another. Simultaneously, they burst out laughing, shouts of mirth echoing around the halls. They ran faster and faster, towards the main exit and school gates. Before they rounded the last corner, Scripps grabbed Posner's hand and held on tight.[Chapter 19] Hello! I promised a quick update and here it is! Thank you for reading, much love 3. I apologize for my appalling French-I am very rusty! If you would like to, I'd love to hear your thoughts so far! Feel free to leave a review if you want :) xxx \"What the-\" \"Why the-\" \"-fuck?\" Timms, Lockwood, Akthar and Rudge, for once, barely seemed to have an appetite. Forkfuls of school lunch potato had only made it halfway to their mouths as they gawped across the canteen. \"What are you on about now?\" Crowther glanced up from his script. \"Come on, the last show of The Crucible is tonight and I have to go over these cuts.\" Rudge pointed. Crowther followed his finger to the other side of the hall. The backs of Posner and Scripps's heads were visible, bent close together at a small table as they talked. \"What are they doing over there?\" Rudge said blankly, glancing at the two empty chairs at their table. At the other side of the canteen, Posner and Scripps ate from the same tray, sipping cans of Coke. \"This is nice.\" Posner said, putting down his fork and smiling at Scripps. Scripps snorted. \"What, a crap school lunch in a hall full of teenage boys?\" \"No!\" Posner giggled. \"I meant…its nice being here on our own. And sharing lunch with you…its…\" He sighed, beaming. \"What?\" Scripps humoured him, smiling. \"It's almost…it's almost like a proper date.\" \" A what ?\" Scripps looked shocked-then burst out laughing. \"A what now?\" He gawped at him in disbelief. \"Don't laugh at me!\" Posner began to see how ridiculous he sounded, feeling his cheeks turn pink. \"Sorry-\" \"Ah now don't be sorry.\" Scripps shook his head, still laughing. He looked at Posner, a half smile on his lips. \"Some fucking date! There's some kid over there getting yoghurt poured on his head.\" \"Don't you want it to be?\" Posner put his head to the side, eyes wide. \"Don't you give me the puppy dog eyes, mister.\" Scripps grinned. He looked around, then leaned in closer. \"If you want a date, you'll get one.\" he murmured, eyes bright. Posner raised an eyebrow. \"Promises, promises…\" \"What are they doing ?\" Timms frowned. \"Maybe they're all the way over there because they can't deal with your fucking stink anymore.\" Dakin snapped, looking suddenly up from his book. \" Oooooooh .\" Timms sang childishly. \"Just because we don't all liberally spray ourselves with Lynx for the benefit of our dearest school secretary.\" He looked back over at the backs of their classmate's heads. \"Seriously, though. What are they doing?\" \"Who fucking cares.\" Dakin hissed, looking murderous, before he noticed the other boys peering curiously at him. \"What?\" \"Clearly you fucking care.\" Lockwood took no bullshit, as usual. \"Do you know what's going on?\" Dakin's face suddenly looked lost, as if he was facing a horrible idea he didn't want to believe. Then, he carefully smoothed out his face. \"No idea. They've probably started a little Dakin fan club.\" he smirked. \"Why don't you just bloody ask them?\" \"Alright.\" Timms got to his feet. \"OY! SCRIPPS! POSNER!\" \" What the fuck !\" Lockwood hissed, pulling him down as everyone around them began to stare. \"What the hell are you doing?\" \"Asking them.\" Timms grinned. \"It's fine, they couldn't hear.\" \"They could.\" Crowther hurriedly hid his face behind his script. \"They're coming over here.\" As Scripps and Posner crossed the crowded canteen, all six remaining boys tried to look as if they hadn't just been talking about them. \"Hi guys.\" Scripps sat down, placing his half-finished lunch tray on the table. Posner sat beside him, smiling at everyone. They both looked incredibly happy, with little glances at one another as if sharing a secret. \"What's up?\" \"Dakin wants to know why you were over there?\" Timms was never one to mince his words. \"I don't!\" Dakin protested, a pink twinge to his perfect cheekbones. Scripps frowned a little at Dakin. The handsome boy's eyes were regarding him strangely, and kept darting to Posner. \"Why were you all the way over there are not here with your bestest friends as always?\" Timms pressed, nudging Scripps in the ribs with a blunt elbow. \"Is our conversation no longer intellectually stimulating enough for you?\" \"Well, we're here now.\" Posner said smoothly, propping himself up on an elbow and trying to defuse the questioning, smiling shyly at the ground-he wasn't going to tell them about their walk in their mutual free period, around the grimy streets surrounding the school. It wasn't the prettiest setting, but it hadn't mattered. He wasn't going to tell thrm how they'd talked and talked about everything and nothing. He certainly wasn't going to tell them how Scripps had held his hand briefly as they walked through an ally back to school…or how Posner had kissed his cheek fleetingly before they entered the gates again…He felt Scripps's foot gently brush his and knew Scripps was thinking the same thing. \"But why-\" \"Oh, hello.\" A sudden voice cuts Timms off. Mr Irwin had loomed above them, tall, thin and earnest as ever. \"Fancy seeing you boys here at this one table. Quite as tediously generic as your Stalingrad essays.\" Irwin grinned as groans chorused around the table. \"Oh sir!\" Dakin moaned, suddenly not interested in Scripps any more. \"That's not fair!\" \"Alas, Dakin, yours was especially competent. Imagine the scene-I am a don of Oriel College, Oxford, I have just read a hundred essays on Stalingrad. Here lands on my desk another list of careful points arranged into two thousand dull words. In other words; I am asleep.\" \"Sir!\" Dakin protested as the other boys laughed at him. \"What else was I supposed to say?\" \"I keep telling you all.\" Irwin pulled up a chair from a nearby table. \"Argue the opposite way. Find something-anything-to say in Hitler's defence. You don't have to believe it-just back it up.\" Posner bit his lip. He always felt awkward in conversations about Hitler and the Nazis…but before he could think too much about the blurry photographs of murdered relations kept on his grandmother's mantelpiece when she was alive, he felt a subtle, yet comforting hand on his knee, hidden under the table. A warm glow filled Posner. Of course Scripps would remember. He covered the hand with his gratefully. \"…and then those sleepy old dons might wake up and give you a chance.\" Irwin was saying. \"Do you see what I mean, Dakin?\" Dakin nodded earnestly. \"But I'm still not sure. Can I see you after school, sir?\" Posner saw him treat Irwin to his most appealing, yet darkly mischievous, eyes. Irwin blinked, surprised. \"Well…\" But quickly he regained his professionalism. \"Of course, Dakin. Be at my door after the last bell, when I've got rid of my Year Sevens.\" Seeming nervous, he took off his glasses and began to clean them on his shirt. \"Well, Dakin's got plenty of time now his marriage is over!\" Timms grinned, to laughs from Rudge and Lockwood and groans from the rest. Even Posner found himself smiling at TImms' joke. Dakin looked daggers at Timms, the pink tinge in his cheeks deepening to crimson. \"Oh, come on, haven't we flogged that poor dead horse enough?\" Irwin replaced his glasses, shaking his head. \"I think we're all sick of this sordid saga. We ought to let Posner and Dakin grieve their relationship in peace.\" A smile had returned to his anxious face. \"I trust you came to an arrangement regarding the children?\" \" Oooohhhhh , Dakin, voici ton ex-femme !\" Timms whistled, miming a blow-job at him. \" C'est vrai .\" giggled Posner at the steaming Dakin, who gave him a very strange look. \" Ça m'attriste qu'ils se séparent .\" Lockwood clutched his heart, winking at Dakin. \" C'est une situation bien triste !\" Timms lamented, giving a pantomime of swooning to much laughter. As he clowned, Dakin began to look more and more strange. His thick, dark brows had knitted together as he stared at Posner and Scripps. It was as if he was doing a complex sum in his head. \" Où est ton plateau ?\" he suddenly asked Posner, his voice cold and questioning. There was silence as everyone turned to look. Sure enough, the table before Posner was empty. No tray, no plate. Posner felt his face begin to burn. Out of the corner of his eye, he saw Scripps looking determinedly at the floor. Dakin's lips began to break out into a serpent-like smile. \" J'ai faim, pas toi ?\" he asked, his eyes beginning to shine. The other boys looked around nervously, some smiling, some unsure whether Dakin was joking. \" Te sens-tu malade ?\" Dakin asked him with false concern. Then-he flashed a quick grin at the other boys. \" Ou c'est la maladie d'amour!\" Posner tried his best to laugh along with the other boys, though his stomach was twisting unpleasantly. \"You phrased that wrong, Dakin, it's-\" he began, trying to hide his nerves. \" Cela n'a pas d'importance !\" Dakin's voice was rising, his grin becoming madder, though he leaned back and folded his arms. \" Quelque chose ne va pas , Posner?\" His French was getting worse as he became more heated, though he tried to keep his cool. He bared his perfectly straight white teeth. \" Ou est-ce que tu m'aimes ?\" The other boys creased up laughing as Posner grinned awkwardly, trying not to show how anxious he was. He could see Scripps cursing in his head, though he remained outwardly cool. \"Alright, Dakin, we've had enough-\" Scripps began, his voice as casual as he could muster. \" Et tu , Scripps?\" Dakin jerked his head around like a snake to fix his dangerously shining eyes on Scripps. His voice was quiet, but tinged with venom. \" E st-ce que tu m'aimes aussi, Scripps?\" There was a pregnant pause. \"Alright, settle down, Dakin.\" Irwin said, raising his voice with as much authority as he could muster. \"I'm at the end of my tether with this joke and the inclusion of a third party may be more than the school gossip column can handle.\" The other boys began to nervously laugh again, just as the bell went to signal the end of the lunch period. \"Dakin, I shall see you at the end of the day. As for the rest of you-\" He stood up. \"-try to keep me awake through your Kristallnacht essays. Christ knows I could do with the amusement.\" \"That was too close.\" Posner muttered as he and Scripps walked together to afternoon registration. \"What do you mean, too close?\" Scripps frowned, rolling his eyes. \"Dakin thinks we're both in love with him. Big deal.\" \"No.\" Posner lowered his voice. \"Did you see the way he was looking at us? He's close to working it out…\" \"Don't be silly, he's not that perceptive.\" Scripps scoffed…but he wasn't sure. \"Look, who cares if he finds out? It might bring him down a peg. He could use that.\" Posner didn't look convinced. \"Well, we'll see him tonight at Crowther's play. What if he says something there?\" \"Let him.\" Scripps said, braver than he felt. \"It doesn't matter.\" Seeing Posner's face fall, he slipped an arm around him in a way that could easily be mistaken for mere friendliness. \"Look, let me take you out for tea tonight.\" \"Really?\" Posner's eyes lit up. \" Really ?\" Scripps mimicked his eager tone. \"Sure.\" Then-he slapped his forehead. \"Oh no wait, I have to pick the girls up from school.\" \"Oh, that's okay.\" Posner smiled. \"I could come with you?\" \"You really want to do that?\" Scripps smiled at him, squeezing his shoulders. \"Yes, I'd love to. Then we can go back to yours…and you can make me tea.\" Posner smiled cheekily, his dimples very prominent. Scripps snorted. \"Beans on toast at mine surrounded by two little sisters? Really romantic.\" he drawled. \"Yes please!\" Posner leaned his head on Scripps's shoulder, practically bouncing along beside him. \"That sounds lovely.\" Scripps gazed down at him, his chest aching with love. For the thousandth time since they had first kissed, he silently thanked God for bringing he and David together. \"Oh Poz, with your spaniel heart…Fine then. It's a date.\"[Chapter 20] Hello everyone! Thank you so much for reading, it means so much! There will be no update tomorrow, but I promise another chapter on either Friday or Saturday :) Hope you enjoy this xxx \"Sleep on, and dream of Heaven awhile- Though shut so close thy laughing eyes Thy rosy lips still wear a smile. And move, and breathe delicious sighs!\" Hector read aloud from a dusty, battered paperback, his voice rich and revering Rogers' words. It was his usual manner when reading poetry-as if he was a prophet delivering some heavenly verse. No matter the subject matter of the poetry, there was something in Hector's voice that made Posner want to listen-he could make the dullest of verses sound wonderful. It was the depth of his passion Posner admired. \"Ah, now, soft blushes tinge her cheeks And mantle o'er her neck of snow: Ah, now she murmurs, now she speaks What most I wish-and fear to know!\" Scripps slouched slightly in his seat in front of Posner and beside Dakin, whose eye he was determinedly avoiding. He never was very interested in Romantic poetry, and Hector's veneration could sometimes make it more unbearable. But he listened politely. The description of the sleeping princess reminded him of the night spent with David at Dakin's after the party…He could hear Dakin's feet shuffling beside him-Dakin was not a fan of any sort of poetry, least of all Romantics. Out of the corner of his eye, he noticed Dakin gazing out of the window, handsome face illuminated in the weak afternoon sun. He could feel anger twisting in his chest at how Dakin had interrogated them both during lunch, especially David. If it was possible, he felt even more protective. Part of him wanted to build a wall between Dakin and David, so high and strong, to make sure he could never upset him again. But, he knew in his heart that he should turn the other cheek and forgive. Whatever Dakin had done, their old friendship nudged at the back of his mind, making him feel guilty. He remembered all those times he spent laughing with Dakin in History class, listening to the tales of his exploits with Fiona, watching him vie with Timms to be the leader of the class conversations, the provider of the banter, the coolest and wittiest. Scripps breathed out slowly, turning away from Dakin and fixing his eyes on Hector, who was exulting the penultimate verse. \"She starts, she trembles, and she weeps! Her fair hands folded on her breast: -And now, how like a Saint she sleeps! A seraph in the realms of rest!\" Posner listened closely, letting the rhythm wash over him. His eyes wondered from Hector to the back of Dakin's head, a dark mass of thick, shining hair, so perfectly groomed and gelled tightly into place. Beside him, Scripps' short mop of light brown, neat at the front and mussed at the back where he became more careless combing it. It looked so soft and warm…and now he had felt it beneath his fingers and knew its texture, it was even harder not to reach out and run his hand through it…He sighed, leaning forward, Dakin disappearing altogether from his view as he gazed at Scripps, leant on his elbows, wondering what on earth he had done to deserve what they were discovering together. \"Sleep on secure! Above control Thy thoughts belong to Heaven and thee And may the secret of thy soul Remain within its sanctuary!\" Hector finished the poem with a flourish, resting the open book in his lap and looking around at the class in silence for a moment. \"Now…\" he said expectantly. \"What does the mind of the modern youth make of Rogers' retelling of this classic tale?\" \"Sir?\" Rudge waved a hand in the air. \"Yes, boy?\" Hector asked him, surprised. Rudge did not usually give his own insight, least of all begin a discussion. \"Sir, what classic tale is that?\" Rudge asked blankly. A ripple of laughter bubbled through the classroom, lead by Timms. \"You fucking idiot!\" \"Boys, boys!\" Hector shook his head, smiling kindly at Rudge. \" The Sleeping Beauty , Rudge.\" \"Oh!\" Rudge nodded in comprehension, giving TImms the finger. Then, he sniggered. \"I love The Sleeping Beauty, sir.\" A loud snort escaped Lockwood. \"Yeah, me too sir!\" he chimed in, grinning at Rudge. \"Ha!\" Timms had caught on by this point. \"Yes, it's one of my favourites, sir?\" he giggled. \"Really warms your heart on a lonely night.\" All three boys were grinning at Hector like Siamese cats, snickering into their hands. Hector sat down heavily at his desk, shaking his head in a pantomime of despair. \"Oh, only these dear children could turn Rodgers' Sleeping Beauty into howling jamboree of juvenile innuendo!\" \"Oh no sir!\" Timms gave a great performance of innocence, widening his eyes, putting his hands together in mock prayer. \"We'd never do that to Rogers' poem, sir! There's no need for self abuse when you actually have your \"hands folded on her breasts!\"\" Hector sighed exasperatedly as the three clowns collapsed, standing up from his desk and picking up the book of poetry. Like a general disciplining his troops, he marched through the classroom until he found each boy. \"You are all three ignorant-\" He hit Rudge over the head with the tome. \"-little-\" He hit Lockwood. \"- tarts !\" He saved the hardest whack for TImms, who was still sniggering at his own joke. In the following commotion, while the battered boys howled in protest, Scripps suddenly whipped around, taking advantage of Hector being distracted, and dropped a small scrap of paper on Posner's desk before quickly turning back into his seat. Curiously, Posner picked it up and unfolded it. Can you stop staring at me please? Scrippsy xxx Posner's eyes popped as he read the note, his cheeks beginning to flush-before he saw Scripps' shoulders shaking with laughter. Half laughing, half appalled, he scribbled back: Don't flatter yourself. It's just your head has swollen so huge it's impossible to see beyond. Poz xxx I'm rather enjoying it actually. I feel like Dakin. There's really no need to stop, love. Scrippsy xxx Your head is so huge I'm surprised it can even fit through the door. Poz xxx That's what she said. Scrippsy xxx I hate you. Poz xxx Oh, my heart is breaking….Can't wait for later. Your Scrippsy xxx Me neither. Hanging out with Lily and Maisie. Seeing Crowther in The Crucible . Oh, and seeing you. I'd almost forgotten of course. Your Poz David When the bell finally chimed to signal the end of the day, there was the usual scramble-scraping of chairs and shoving of books into bags. \"Now, who goes home?\" Hector boomed over the commotion, causing the volume only to rise as each boy determinedly avoided his eye. \"Dakin?\" he asked, hopefully. \"Can't, sir. Got to see Irwin.\" Dakin slung his bag onto his back and strode purposefully out of the door, slamming it so hard behind him that it caused a draft. \"Ah, Scripps!\" Hector's leering eyes, unabashed, locked on Scripps as he delved into his bag, making sure he'd remembered the key for his bike lock. Scripps's stomach squeezed unpleasantly as he saw again that knowing twinkle in the teacher's eye. \"Can't, sir. Got my bike.\" His fingers found the key and waved it, glad of a good excuse. He saw Posner packing away his books out of the corner of his eye and grinned, which was returned with the most appealing spaniel eyes Scripps had ever seen. \"Lockwood?\" Hector's gaze swivelled to the front row. A desperate look around-then a sigh. \"Alright, sir. I'll come\" \"Ah, excellent, excellent.\" With a sickly smile, Hector picked up his bag and motorbike helmet before striding regally out of the classroom door. As the other boys gathered round to bully Lockwood and give him advice, Scripps casually strode out of the door, closing it behind him-before whipping around the corner into an empty corridor that was barely used to wait for Posner, as they had discussed. This way, they could go via the bike shed and not be seen leaving together. A smile on his face, Scripps folded his arms and leant against the wall, anticipating the wonderful evening ahead of him. He and Posner, collecting the girls, taking them home, then a whole glorious afternoon together before going to watch The Crucible that night. Posner's date , he thought, laughing to himself. Well, if the title made him happy… \"Scripps?\" Scripps started at the sudden address. Suddenly, as if out of thin air, Dakin had appeared beside him. His handsome face was set. \"Dakin?\" Scripps blinked, confused. \"Weren't you supposed to be seeing Irwin?\" \"I'm going there now.\" Dakin said, his voice carefully quiet and smooth. \"Just thought I'd come and say hi before I went. We haven't spoken in ages .\" There was something strange about the way Dakin was looking at him, the way he'd angled his face. It was a good angle, Scripps noticed. Showed him off. \"Oh!\" Scripps arranged his face into a warm smile, ignoring the dangerous emphasis. He had decided to give Dakin the benefit of the doubt. \"Sorry, mate, you know how it is. Listen, how are you?\" \"Oh, I'm alright…\" Dakin's voice was almost normal, an attractive half smile around his lips. \"It hasn't been the same, not chatting to you about bloody Fiona and everything like we used to.\" \"Yes, you're right, I-wait. Bloody Fiona?\" \"Yep.\" Dakin stretched lazily. Scripps noticed him deliberately flexing his arm muscles. \"Think I might be getting a bit sick of her. Bit clingy. Decided we might have to come to an amicable mutual withdrawal of forces.\" \"But you were so close to Berlin!\" Scripps laughed, feeling warmer towards Dakin then he had in a long while. \"I guess.\" Dakin shrugged. \"Well, it's not like she's the only person in the world. There's so much to do, see and try, and with her being in her twenties and me young…\" He fixed his sultry, brooding dark eyes straight on Scripps…almost hungrily. \"I guess I want to…spread my wings a little. Head off the beaten track. Make like Frost and choose the road less travelled. Do you see what I mean?\" Scripps nodded, hiding his misunderstanding. Dakin was behaving so oddly now they were alone. \"I see…?\" he said carefully, eyebrows slightly knitted together. This hadn't been the kind of conversation he'd expected at all. \"Anyway…I'd best be getting to old Irwin's. Don't want to keep him waiting. See you tonight, Scripps.\" With one last, deep look at him, treating Scripps to a confusingly suggestive smile before sauntering off, bag casually hooked over one shoulder. Scripps was befuddled. He stared after his classmate, mouth slightly open in confusion. If he hadn't known better…he could have sworn Dakin was... flirting with him…? No. Impossible. Scripps shook his head. And yet…the way he was…staring as if he was a hungry lion and Scripps was a particularly tasty antelope… \"Hey! Fiona!\" Dakin's voice suddenly echoed through the empty corridor, followed by the sound of running feet. \"There you are, baby…I missed you…\" There was a pause Scripps could only assume was filled with a kiss. \"We still on for tonight? Or are you still exhausted from Saturday night?\" \"Stuart, get off me! You know we can't behave like this while I'm at work, I'll get the sack!\" Fiona said, trying to be stern-but Scripps could hear her giggling. \"I take that as a yes.\" Dakin said, his voice low and seductive. \"I'll be outside your office door at half four exactly. Then you can give me what you promised at the weekend…\" Scripps frowned, more confused than ever. Surely this-the eager run, the titillating banter-wasn't the behaviour of a man about to break up with his lover…What was Dakin doing ? If he had been flirting with Scripps-and Scripps was almost positive he had been-what could his game be? Scripps mulled it over in his head, trying to fathom Dakin's logic…what did he want? Wait. All of a sudden, Scripps remembered the rumours. He himself was supposed to be in love with Dakin, according to the other boys. He snorted slightly at the memory of lunchtime. So then-if hypothetically he was actually in love with Dakin-why would Dakin encourage him like this? Scripps thought back to the days when his David was head over heels for Dakin, how Dakin had similarly encouraged him …so why -? \"Scrippsy!\" As if Scripps's thought of him had summoned him, here was David Posner, hurrying towards him. Scripps's heart jolted in his chest. \"Sorry I was so slow, I got cornered by the guys-\" But before he could finish his excuse, Scripps had thrown his arms around him, holding tight, all thought of Dakin expelled from his brain. \"Hey,\" Scripps said into his hair, planting a quick kiss on the top of his head. \"Let's get out of here, shall we?\" Making their way out of the fire exit at the end of the corridor, Scripps and Posner skirted around the back of the ugly, concreate buildings towards the school bike shed. All the while, they talked about their day, about Rudge and Timms's clowning in Hector's lesson, about their history lesson with Irwin that morning, about their snatched walk in the middle of the day. Neither mentioned Dakin at all as they laughed together. \"Here we are, then,\" Scripps crouched down to unlock his bike, then presented it with a sweeping gesture to David, who was waiting behind him. \"Your carriage awaits.\" \"Scripps…\" David sounded nervous, as if he dreaded the answer. \"What are you suggesting?\" Scripps grinned mischievously. \"Don't you trust me?\" \"Of course.\" David said automatically. \"But-\" \"Get on, then.\" Scripps held the frame of the bike steady with one strong hand and held the other out to David. \"Scripps, I-\" \"Go on.\" Scripps smiled at him reassuringly. \"I promise I won't let you fall.\" As if this was against all of his better judgement, with Scripps's help, Posner climbed awkwardly onto the seat of the bike, gripping Scripps's shoulder so tightly Scripps was sure he could feel bruises forming \"Rest your feet on the frame-good, like that.\" Scripps held onto Posner's waist. \"Now, you have to hold on tightly, okay? Promise?\" \"I'll just pretend you're Hector.\" Posner grinned through his gritted teeth. \"Please don't do that.\" Scripps shook his head, laughing. \"You trust me, right?\" He met David's eyes, a glint in his. Posner took a deep breath. \"Though I think it will definitely result in my death, I do.\" \"Good. Right then,\" Scripps suddenly swung his leg over the frame of the bike onto the farthest peddle from him. He wrapped practised hands around the bars. \"Hold on, remember!\" He felt one of David's slim arms wrap tightly around his chest and the other around his waist. Through his school blazer, Scripps could feel David's sweet heart pounding against his back. He felt his entire body drink in David's warmth, feeling as if nothing in the world could be better than this. \"Right. Ready?\" \"No!\" Posner squeaked. \"Okay!\" Laughing, Scripps kicked off the ground and, standing in the peddles with David's arms around him, they sped off down the road on the bicycle.[Chapter 21] Hey everyone! I'm afraid this chapter won't be the most exciting one-I was trapped in London last night until 3am, so I wrote this for you guys pretty fast! Enjoy some fluff and I promise the next chapter will be more interesting ;) xxx \"This actually isn't so bad!\" Posner clung to Scripps, his nails digging into him as he gripped like a vice. His voice was abnormally high pitched as they rode along the edge of the street beside the pavement. \"Not so bad!\" he squeaked determinedly. \"I think that's a lie!\" Scripps called back to him, grinning. His legs had begun to ache from pulling Posner's weight as well as his own on the bike, but he was so happy he barely noted it. \"Don't worry, I'm going about half the speed I would normally.\" \"This is half ?\" Posner clutched Scripps tighter, so Scripps was put in mind of baby koalas. \"It's okay!\" he laughed delightedly. He felt so free as they whizzed along the road, barely noticing anything around them. The entire road, cars and everything around it could have been burning for all he cared. All that he felt was David holding on to him as tightly as he could-though he knew it wasn't out of love but more fearing for his life. \"We're not far from the girls' school.\" \"Now I'm finally convinced I'm not missing out on anything on Hector's bike!\" \" Trust me, you're not!\" Scripps assured him. \"On that bike it's not just the speed but the wandering hands! Try getting your balls groped at fifty miles an hour and barely escaping with your honour!\" Posner laughed-then gave a small squeak of terror as a car sped close by them. \"Don't worry!\" Scripps grinned back at him briefly. \"You're very safe!\" \"I'm not!\" Posner gripped even tighter. \"My mum would kill me for agreeing to this!\" Then, he started. \"Speaking of my mum, can we stop at that phone box?\" He held on with all his might at they turned the corner. \" Please stop! And slowly !\" Gradually, Scripps came to a standstill, leaning one foot on the kerb to steady the bike. \"Why?\" he asked, turning round to help David down, which he couldn't seem to do quickly enough. He jumped onto the pavement, breathing a sigh of relief and digging a hand in his pocket for change. \"I need to ring my mum-if I don't come home she'll think I'm dead.\" He gave Scripps an apologetic and slightly embarrassed look before heading toward the red phone box beside a bus station. One of the glass windows was shattered but the phone was intact. \"Sorry, she's a little protective.\" \"Don't worry!\" Scripps smiled reassuringly, leaning the bike against the intact wall of the phone box. \"It's fine, you don't need to apologise.\" He understood-thinking about how precious David was to him, he couldn't imagine what he must mean to his own mother. She'd seemed such a sweet woman when he'd met her on the doorstep. That seemed like a lifetime ago after everything that had happened... \"Come on then.\" David smiled, pulling him into the phone box by the hand and closing the door behind them. Scripps suddenly found himself in a tight, enclosed space, body so close to David's...he felt currents of electricity running through his body... \"Oh!\" Scripps widened his eyes in a pantomime of innocence. \"Sir! In broad daylight? What sort of a boy do you think I am?\" Posner grinned. \"I simply couldn't wait.\" he said, making his voice deep and lustful, hands sliding around Scripps' waist. \"I must have you now.\" His eyes were shining as they playacted, simply fooling around...but there was a glint. A definite glint in David's eyes Scripps had never seen there before...a look that only meant one thing... Scripps stepped quickly backwards, a hand flying to his forehead. \"Oh sir, I am innocent in the ways of gentlemen!\" he simpered-trying to ignore how being this close to David in such a tight space was making him feel...\"What would my Daddy say?\" he sighed tragically, desperately clinging to the joke. Posner grinned, still in character. \"Why do you tempt me so, you little tease?\" he growled-before they both burst out laughing. Scripps hid his relief as Posner turned to the phone, leaning on the wall. He found himself feeling strangely winded as he stared determinedly at the roof of the phone box. He hadn't found himself feeling this way for a long time...not since he'd stopped...Scripps did not allow himself to feel anything of this sort, had simply not allowed thoughts of this kind to enter his mind... don't think about it ...While Scripps leaned against the glass, Posner slid coins into the phone and dialled his number. It didn't take long for an answer. \"Hello?\" Scripps could faintly hear Mrs Posner's voice on the other end of the line, though he pretended not to listen. \"Hi Mum, its me.\" \"David? Is everything okay?\" Scripps smiled slightly at the rate she assumed the worst. David hadn't been wrong about his mother. \"Yes, Mum, everything is fine! Just letting you know I won't be home until late.\" \"Late? How late? Where are you?\" Posner glanced quickly at Scripps, who looked away quickly. \"Mum, remember I'm going to see a play tonight my friend is in? I told you on Wednesday.\" \"Yes, that's not until later. Dad was going to give you a lift, remember darling?\" \"I'm going to my, erm, friend's house first. Then we're going to the theatre together.\" \"Which friend? The one in the play? Where does he live? Won't you be home for dinner tonight?\" \"Mum!\" Posner struggled to keep his voice even. \"Don't worry! It's Scripps-Donald Scripps?...yes, the piano one…No I won't be home, I'm eating there…No...No, Mum! Don't worry! It's fine, I'll see you later….Yes, I'll be safe…What? Mum , it's fine …You do know I'm legally an adult?….oh alright, okay then. Okay. Yes. Yes….Thank you…I love you too. Bye, Mum.\" He slammed the phone down before she could protest. \"There!\" He turned triumphantly to Scripps, rolling his eyes. \"She was reminding me to cross the road carefully and to stay with you when we're out tonight…And Dad has to pick me up after! Honestly, she thinks I'm about Lily's age…\" \"It's fine.\" Scripps smiled. \"She just loves you.\" \"Yeah, and don't I know it!\" Posner said as they left the phone box. \"She can be…smothering…\" \"Ah now.\" Scripps was still smiling-but his eyes were sad. \"Sometimes I think it might be nice if my mum was a little more involved….but hey.\" He grinned bravely, then nudged Posner playfully. \"Hey, why are you looking so strange?\" David had suddenly fixed his eyes firmly on the floor. \"I called you my friend.\" he said, not meeting Scripps' eyes. \"Yeah? What's up with that?\" Scripps said vaguely, picking up the bike and wheeling it towards the rode. \"Well….you're not just my friend, are you?\" David looked up at him, eyes suddenly wide. \"Sorry!\" He slapped a hand to his head. \"Sorry, I'm an idiot!\" \"Don't be silly!\" Scripps laughed at his panicked expression. \"It's cool.\" He reached out over the bicycle and stroked David's cheek with one finger, trying to ignore how hard his heart was thumping in his chest as he truly began to register what David was implying. \"Look, you don't have to worry about calling…this…anything.\" David bit his lip. \"Don't you want to call it anything?\" he asked in a small voice. \"Oh, Poz…\" Scripps laughed again, shaking his head. \"Don't worry! You're worse than your mum for jumping to conclusions!\" He gave him a quick hug over the bike with one arm. \"I don't care about what we call this, you know? It's just…it's just great we have it, hey?\" \"Okay.\" Posner nodded, giving Scripps those spaniel eyes again. Scripps could feel his heart melt inside his chest as he looked into them, feeling himself fall a little more in love with him. It was all he could do not to lean over and kiss him, right here in the street and damn all the traffic and passers-by… \"Come on, love,\" he said reluctantly. \"Not far now.\" Scripps felt, as he did every day, slightly guilty as they walked into the deserted playground at the primary school, wheeling the bike beside him. It was utterly silent, excepting a lone pigeon strutting around inside the hopscotch markings. Every child had already been taken home, since Scripps could only every make it down from his school, no matter how fast he rode, at least twenty-five minutes late, as the lower school day ended fifteen minutes before the upper. He knew it couldn't be helped, but he hated the fact that Lily and Maisie always had to watch their friends all be collected by a parent or the like before he finally came, a consolation prize of a big brother. However, as always, he felt the weight lift off his shoulders as he saw two little heads-one mouse, one auburn, peering out of a classroom window, looking out for him. As they spotted him, both little faces broke into huge smiles and instantly they disappeared from their watching post. Scripps couldn't help but grin as he hurried to the classroom door, leaning his bike against the wall and crouching down seconds before the door was flung open. \" Donny !\" The little auburn tornado sprang instantly into his arms, as she always did, messy school bunches swinging wildly at each side of her head. Scripps hugged his bouncy little sister tightly with one arm, then held out the other to the little mouse sister who had followed behind her, an anxious smile on her face, arm bound. He hugged her far more gently with the other hand and she leaned gratefully into his shoulder. \"Hey!\" he said to both of them when they let go. \"Good day?\" \"Look!\" Maisie suddenly waved a colourful sheet of paper. \"Look what I painted!\" she said, proudly showing the symmetrical set of colourful blobs. \"It's a butterfly!\" \"So it is!\" Scripps looked at the picture, grinning. \"It's awesome! How did you paint that?\" \"Mrs Madley said that if we painted one wing then folded the paper over, it would turn into a butterfly!\" Maisie explained in one breath. \"Mrs Madley said that butterflies are caterpillars first and then they eat lots of fruit and sausage and cakes and they turn into butterflies!\" Scripps laughed. \"Is that right? Did Mrs Madley read you a book about a caterpillar, by any chance?\" \" Yes !\" Maisie looked amazed. \"He was very hungry! How did you know ?\" Her eyes goggled at him. \"I'm magic.\" Scripps tickled her, making her squeal. \"How about you, Lily?\" he asked, turning to his quiet sister. \"It was okay.\" Lily said, as she always did when asked this question. \"What did you get up to?\" Scripps gently pressed her, encouraging her to talk. \"Well…\" \"We learned the two times table, didn't we, Lily?\" came a fruity voice from behind her. A sturdily built Jamaican woman with long, greying braids had appeared, her ready smile in place. \"And we did some history this afternoon.\" \"Mrs Quinn!\" Scripps looked up at Lily's teacher apologetically. \"So sorry-\" he began. \"Donald, you come late every day. You apologise every day. And I tell you every day that it is fine.\" Mrs Quinn winked at him. \"Let's stop this performance, it's getting boring. You're never as late as your mother was collecting you!\" Scripps grinned apologetically. \"Thank you for waiting with them.\" he said, as he always did. \"I'm here anyway.\" Mrs Quinn waved. \"No trouble. See you on Monday.\" She closed the door behind them as Scripps began to load the girls' school bags onto the handlebars of his bike. \"Hey, Maisie, look over there! See who it is?\" Scripps tapped Maisie's shoulder and pointed across the playground to where Posner was standing, slightly awkwardly. Before he had time to say anything else, a small gust of air hit him as the little girl sped off across the playground, a huge grin on her freckled face. \"It's my friend !\" Maisie yelled, running full pelt towards Posner and finally hugging his legs so hard he almost overbalanced. Scripps's heart warmed as he watched the boy he loved get such a welcome from his little sister. David's own face had formed a huge smile-one couldn't help it around Maisie. Scripps smiled softly as David bent down to talk to her, getting another, suffocating Maisie-hug around the neck for his trouble. Turning back to the bike to wheel it over, he noticed Lily standing nervously behind it, hiding. \"Alright, Lil? You remember David?\" he asked her gently. She nodded, still shyly hiding behind the bike. \"Shall we go and say hello together?\" He held out a hand to her, which she took, and together they walked over to David and Maisie with the bike. Maisie was talking at a million miles an hour to David, who was listening and nodding, looking slightly overwhelmed. When he heard the wheels of the bike, he turned and grinned. \"Hi, Lily, how's the arm?\" he asked, keeping his voice quiet and kind. Scripps loved him for this. Lily hung onto Scripps's hand, half-hidden behind his legs, but she gave Posner a timid smile. She leaned over slightly so he could see the cast in its sling, covered in childish scribbles and pictures from her classmates. \"…and then the caterpillar ate the fruit and sausage and cakes and turned into a butterfly like this!\" Maisie was saying to David excitedly, waving her painting. \"It was awesome!\" \"Wow!\" David turned back to Maisie, laughing. \"Sounds like quite a book! And that's such a great painting, I love all the yellow!\" Scripps quickly rearranged his face when he realised how nauseating his expression must be as he smiled what must have been his goofiest grin ever watching David being so sweet to his little sisters. It just made him even more perfect in his eyes. His mind flicked back to the David in the phone box, so close to him...the way he'd made him feel...this David was not the same...and yet he was both... He squeezed Lily's hand gently. \"Come on, let's get home.\" I promise the next one will have a little more action! See you tomorrow, much love xxx[Chapter 22] Hello lovely people! Thank you so much for reading and reviewing, it means the world! It made me laugh so much when you guys picked up on my calling Dakin \"plastic\"-so many Mean Girls references! I am now utterly convinced that on Wednesdays Dakin wears pink :P Hope you enjoy this chapter! Much much love and more soon xxx In Scripps' eyes, the world was currently absolutely perfect. In front of him, he could see his little sister Maisie skipping and bouncing along, chatting seemingly without even pausing for breath, hand in hand with David. Beside him, his little sister Lily, her good hand resting on the saddle of his bike as he wheeled it along. There was no sun and the sky was grey-blue, saturated with clouds as if it was considering raining, but to Scripps this suddenly seemed as wondrous as a beautiful spring morning. Scripps watched, the biggest grin on his face, as Maisie swung on David's hand. He could hear her telling him about something that had happened in her reception class that day. David probably didn't understand a word, but he listened to her-really listened, not pretended to as so many adults did. Scripps loved him for this, for the way he turned and smiled at her to comment every now and again, how her little face lit up when he did. \"So you had history today, hey?\" Scripps asked Lily as their little group made their way down the street of terraced red-brick houses. He heard a laugh bubble out of Maisie in front of him, high pitched and infectious, so it wasn't long before David was laughing too. He could see the dimple flash on the side of his face, warming Scripps's heart. \"What did you learn about?\" Scripps turned back to Lily, an encouraging smile in place. \"Er…\" Lily dragged her feet a little, but she managed to smile at her brother. \"Henry VIII.\" \"Really!\" Scripps grinned. \"That's what I learn about too! There you go, Lil, you're as clever as the big school kids!\" Lily giggled uncertainly, but she looked pleased. \"He had six wives?\" she exclaimed. \"What, at the same time?\" Scripps teased her. \"No!\" Lily really had the giggles now. \"Silly.\" Scripps made a funny face at her, sticking out his tongue and making his eyes pop, and more laughs bubbled out of her. He loved seeing her relax-she was always so anxious. \"Is that all you learned?\" he asked her. \"He liked to eat lots and lots!\" she told him, making a big gesture with her good hand. \"Is that right?\" Scripps always liked to encourage her to talk-it was good for boosting her confidence. \"Yes!\" Lily gave a small skip to keep up with the bike. \"So he was big big big big!\" She puffed out her cheeks to demonstrate. Scripps laughed, slowing the bike down a fraction for her. \"Look! Look, that one there! That's my house, David!\" Maisie had started jumping up and down and pointing to the very last red terraced house as they approached it. It was square, two floors, with slightly peeling white window panes. The front door was white too, and Scripps could see that morning's newspaper jammed inside the letterbox. There was a hanging basket above the doorway, but it had long since died, the flowers brown and stringy. Scripps felt a twinge of nerves in his stomach. He tried to remember what state the house had been in when they'd left that morning. He looked quickly at David, who was looking up at the small chimney on the roof, identical to every other house on the street. \"Come on, then.\" he said before he could think about it too much, feeling in his pocket for his house key. He hoped David would understand whatever was on the other side. The correct way to describe Scripps' house was probably an \"organized mess\". Every surface, from in the hall to in the bathroom, was covered in clutter, from pots and pans in the kitchen, to books and toys in the living room, to a thick coating of sheet music atop the piano and finally neatly folded washing at the bottom of the stairs. The floors were all very clean and there was no visible dust, but it couldn't be denied that this was the kind of house that would give Posner's mother a heart attack. However, Posner found himself smiling as he looked around. \"I love your house!\" he said politely. \"You're so full of lies.\" But Scripps gave him a quick, grateful look as he knelt down to help Lily take off her school shoes. \"If I'd known you were coming, I'd have cleaned up a bit. It's a bit difficult to keep things organised.\" \"Don't be silly!\" Posner smiled at him, bending down to remove his own shoes. \"It's fine.\" \"Right girls,\" Scripps hung Maisie's coat on the bannister and helped Lily take hers off in the same movement. \"Make sure you're out of your uniforms before tea-I can't be bothered with washing out stains.\" \"Can we watch TV?\" Maisie asked, already bobbing out of sight into the living room. Lily followed her, glancing back at Scripps for approval. \"Your eyes will go square,\" he said warningly-but he grinned when Lily looked at him, worried, to show he was joking. \"Just for a bit, but homework later, okay?\" \"Okay!\" chorused the girls. Posner heard a TV being switched on and the sounds of a children's show blasting out. Scripps was busy hanging up Lily's coat and putting the girls' bags by the door. He yanked the paper out of the letterbox and set it down on the side, before turning to the staircase and beginning to pick up the washing on the stairs. Posner watched him, feeling quite surprised. He'd known Scripps' parents were out of the house a lot, but he didn't know that Scripps was basically running the ship single-handedly. He noticed the small wooden cross on the wall above the piano, the only bit of decoration on the walls. \"Hey!\" Scripps's voice brought him out of his thoughts, the pile of washing now neatly in his arms. He was grinning down at him from the bottom stair, arms full of clothes, suddenly looking more handsome than ever. \"Daydreaming about me, are we?\" \"You wish,\" Posner reached up to help, but Scripps had already begun to climb the stairs, motioning for Posner to follow him. \"Don't you sit in class and dreamily doodle my name in hearts on your notebook?\" Scripps looked back, winking. \"No!\" Posner protested, feeling his cheeks begin to grow hot- okay, once . But Scripps was laughing to himself as he reached the landing at the top of the stairs. He was dealing the clothes into the large chest of drawers at the top of the stairs by the time Posner reached him. \"Don't you dreamily doodle my name on yours?\" Posner said, looking around. It was a small hallway with four doors leading off it. There was a nail on the wall, but no picture hanging from it. \"Oh, all the time.\" Scripps said cheekily, folding little-girl's t-shirts into the lowest drawers. \"My books are simply covered in hearts.\" \"They'd better be.\" Posner suddenly spotted a picture frame on the ground beneath the nail. In it was a picture of a younger Scripps-the braces on his smile and spots on his forehead told Posner that he was about thirteen. In his arms, he carefully held a newborn baby, tiny and pink, wrapped in a blue knitted blanket. Her eyes were closed but her little red mouth was open, as if she was yawning, or indeed chatting. On his other knee was a girl of maybe eighteen months old, dressed in yellow, smiling at the camera, but her eyes were looking nervously over at the baby, as if she was a little afraid of it. Posner smiled-Maisie and Lily had not changed a bit. It was the only photo he'd seen in the whole house, so unlike his or Dakin's homes which had mantelpieces and walls dedicated to documenting their children's lives. It seemed very strange, so foreign to Posner. He wondered what kind of parents wouldn't want photos of their children…then again, he knew he shouldn't judge. There could be any number of reasons…then again… \"You like that?\" Scripps closed the last drawer and looked up. \"The hook on the back broke last night. I need to fix it. God, I looked a sight then.\" \"Ah, everyone does when they're that awkward age. Not me, I always looked about ten.\" Scripps laughed. \"I bet you did. Anyway.\" He pointed at the door farthest to the right. \"That's me.\" \"Oh really?\" Posner pointed at the door beside it, which was covered in glittery pink stickers of kittens and ponies. \"I thought that was it.\" \"Ha ha. No, that's the girls. I'm just here.\" He walked over to open the door, and held it open for David-before looking in, gasping and dashing into his bedroom, looking panicked. Posner frowned, confused. He followed Scripps through and found himself in a small bedroom, rectangular and painted a faded grey colour. The walls were covered in shelves of books, except one which held carefully painted models of medieval knights, some on horseback, some on foot. Confusingly, behind them was an equally carefully painted toy rocket. There were no pin-ups, like on Dakin's walls, but a map of the world and a couple of photographs pasted beside the single bed, covered in a navy duvet. A small Bible sat beside the battered lamp on the neat desk beside the small wardrobe, with a faded rug on the floor. Finally, there was Scripps, stood in the corner with his back to the wall. He was smiling, but looked slightly odd, his hands firmly behind his back. \"Wow,\" Posner looked around, taking in the room, a strange mesh of a much younger Scripps and the studious boy he now knew. He walked closer to the photos beside the bed, blu-tacked to the wall. One showed Maisie and Lily, looking a lot closer to their current ages, at the bottom of a slide. The other, to Posner's surprise, was the photograph the boys from history had taken together on the day they found out their A level results. He couldn't remember who had taken it, but all eight of them were crowded in together, arms around one another. He could see Timms laughing, Lockwood shaking his head at him, Akthar grinning into the camera, Rudge facing the wrong way, Crowther making a peace sign. In the very centre, Dakin's half-smile, impossibly sexy, looking intensely at whoever was taking the photo-ah yes, it had been Fiona. Posner smiled at the memory as he spotted his own face, right at the front as usual. He must have moved as the photo was being taken because his arm was out of focus, but he was smiling hopefully-even Posner had to admit it was a nice photo of him. And there, just behind him, an arm thrown around his shoulders, was Scripps himself. Scripps was grinning too, his face alight, but Posner noticed his eyes were focused to the left. On him. Posner was so touched by the photo he nearly forgot to ask why Scripps was standing so awkwardly in the corner. \"Scrippsy, why are you all the way over there?\" Posner began to approach him. He saw Scripps's shoulders tighten- he was holding something behind his back . \"What have you got there?\" \"Nothing.\" Scripps began to edge away, side-stepping along the wall, a massive grin on his face. \"Scrippsy, what's that behind your back?\" \"Nothing!\" Scripps was giggling now. \"Show me!\" \"No way.\" Scripps hid whatever it was more firmly. \"Right. You asked for this.\" Suddenly, Posner launched himself at Scripps, grabbing at both of his arms. \"Hey!\" Scripps looked surprised, beginning to dodge. Posner fought back, trying to pin his arms to his sides. Quite quickly, he managed to squish him against the wall, subduing him and locking his arms in place. Scripps looked more surprised than ever. \"Where did you learn that?\" \"I had older siblings.\" Posner held Scripps tightly. \"What's behind your back? Tell me or I'll crush you.\" \"You're stronger than you look.\" Scripps said, sounding impressed…and perhaps even a little turned on. There was a strange look in his eyes…but before Posner could get a proper look, it had been carefully wiped away as quickly as it had appeared. \"Fine. You win.\" Reluctantly, Scripps produced, from behind his back, a tattered brown teddy bear, with matted curly fur and a missing eye. \"Here you are.\" Posner looked at it, blinking. \"Is that all? Oh Scrippsy, I've mine on my shelf. Only he's black. Oohhhhhh, yours is so cute!\" He reached out to pat the battered bear on its curly head. Scripps smiled-but he still looked odd, embarrassed but somehow cheeky. \"I'm glad you like him. But I had to move him because…he sits on my pillow during the day…\" Posner paused…then a laugh fizzed out of him. \"Scripps!\" \"The girls look for him sat there!\" Scripps said, his cheeks beginning to turn red. \"Especially Lily-she has him at night sometimes when she can't sleep!\" \"And you don't?\" Posner teased. Scripps laughed, shaking his head. \"I keep him for old times' sake. My grandma gave him to me when I was three.\" \"That's adorable.\" Posner said, patting the bear again. \"Yeah, she used to look after me a lot when I was a kid.\" Scripps said, giving the bear to Posner. He was warm and fuzzy-this was a well-loved bear. Posner couldn't help giving him a little cuddle. Scripps smiled at him, eyes soft. \"You look so cute like that.\" \"Oh come on, Scrippsy, Stalin would look cute with a teddy bear.\" Posner pointed out, but he couldn't help feeling as nauseatingly warm and fuzzy as the bear when Scripps looked at him that way. \"Yep, and Stalin was cuter than you to start with.\" Scripps smirked-before being attacked by Posner and the teddy bear. They play-fought until finally Posner managed to push Scripps down onto the bed, the mattress creaking slightly-but Scripps wasn't giving up. He yanked Posner down with him, so they both would up in a tangle, limbs mixed up together in a giggling heap, as if they were children again. The mattress was soft, although Posner could tell half the springs were broken, and the duvet smelled like washing powder, and a slight hint of Scripps' own warm, clean, boyish smell. Posner stroked the pillow gently, knowing Scripps had slept there last night...Scripps himself hand stretched out, one arm behind his head, one pulling Posner close beside him. Feeling safer and more comfortable than he ever had before, Posner snuggled into him, resting his head on his chest, wrapping his arms around his waist. He could hear Scripps' heart beating beneath his school shirt. It was so natural to lie like this with Scripps. \"Alright?\" Scripps asked, kissing the top of his head. \"Of course.\" Posner was warm, safe and protected by the strong arm around him. He felt as if nothing could ever go wrong as long as Scripps held him. \"Hey Scripps?\" \"Yes, l-\" But Scripps was cut off as Posner began to eagerly kiss him, to which Scripps enthusiastically responded. Of course, Posner had no one to compare him with, but it seemed that Scripps was probably almost definitely the best kisser in the world. Their lips just seemed to fit -though maybe this was Posner's imagination, since he adored him. And Scripps adored him right back, he knew. It was the most wonderful feeling in the world to be wholly wanted, cared for and accepted by another person. There was no emptiness, the unrequited agony of the days of Dakin. No, this was altogether different. How could he ever have believed he loved Dakin when this was right out there waiting for him? The emptiness was gone from his heart-instead it was full, so full it almost overwhelmed him. To lie with someone, holding them close, feeling them holding you too, kissing them, being kissed back… \"Scrippsy… you kiss by the book ,\" Posner whispered, smiling, as they paused for breath. He stroked Scripps's chest, feeling his heart beating. Looking into Scripps' face, noticing the small lines around his eyes and mouth as he smiled. But as he straightened up further to admire them closer, something caught his eye. \"Oh!\" \"What's wrong?\" Scripps asked, blissful eyes becoming clouded with concern. \"It's just…\" Scripps lifted his hand from Scripps' chest to point at the Bible, which was sat just a metre away from them on the desk. Scripps followed his finger-then burst out laughing. \"Oh Poz!\" \"No, really!\" Posner suddenly sat up straight, letting go of Scripps despite his protesting. \"I'm just…I mean are you okay with this?\" \"Yeah?\" Scripps sat up too, hugging his knees still grinning at him. \"What, do you think lightning bolts are going to shoot out of it?\" \"No!\" Posner said, giggling in spite of himself. \"I…I guess I've been thinking…Does this…I mean, am I…?\" \"Do I think it compromises my Christianity to kiss you?\" Scripps said, as if he'd read his mind. \"Yes!\" Posner said, feeling the worry growing inside him. \"Not at all.\" Scripps answered immediately. Posner blinked. \"Really?\" \"Yes.\" Scripps leaned over and pecked his lips. \"You see? No lightning.\" \"But really?\" Posner pressed him. \"You think…I mean…Well, I don't know what I mean really.\" Scripps laughed. \"You do know it says the same thing in the Torah, right?\" \"Yes, but I'm nothing like as devout as you.\" Scripps sighed, taking Posner's hand in both of his. \"Well, if you must know, the first thing I did when I realised I loved you was to thank God.\" He smiled, shrugging. \"I figured that God wouldn't have brought us together if he didn't want us to, you know, be us. I love God and I know God loves me, and I have served Him all my life, and therefore I refuse to believe that God would make me feel something He supposedly hates just to damn me for the sake of it. Do you see what I mean?\" Scripps stroked Posner's hand, suddenly looking down. Posner's eyes were wide-he knew Scripps was revealing something very personal to him. \"So, I prayed a lot. A lot . And eventually, I made up my mind. I didn't feel guilty about you at all. That's how I know that, as far as I believe, God doesn't mind in the least that I love kissing you.\" Posner was speechless. \"Really?\" \"Well, that's what I believe. I don't know about anyone else.\" Scripps smiled again, squeezing Posner's hand. He sighed again, looking down at the duvet. \"Does that satisfy you?\" Posner was more moved than he could say. Then…his mind wondered back. \"Did you say…did you say when you realised you loved me?\" Scripps didn't miss a beat. \"I said I know God loves me. Is that would you meant?\" Posner gave him a searching look-then decided to let it go. He'd probably heard wrong-it seemed too good to be true. \"Okay. I'm satisfied.\" \"Come here, then.\" Scripps wrapped his arms around Posner and kissed him again. \"I don't want to waste any more time. The girls will want their tea in a bit and I'm not done with you yet.\" \"Oh no?\" Posner gave him what he hoped was a very sexy look. Scripps frowned, looking concerned. \"What's wrong with your face? You look like a confused llama.\" \"Oh, just stop talking.\" Posner stopped his mouth in the way he had learned always worked on Scripps. Gradually, they sank back down onto the bed, lying in one another's arms, lips hardly leaving one another's for a moment. Posner felt himself sink deeper and deeper into the mattress, as if the rest of the word was leaving them behind, becoming an unimportant blur, simply background noise. They kissed again and again, sometimes tenderly, sometimes more urgently, sometimes simply just small, simple kisses. As his head swam, void of anything but Scripps, he silently appealed to the stars, to the Gods, to anything in the universe that this would never, never end, that he would never stop feeling Scripps' body against his, Scripps' lips kissing his, Scripps' honey-musk breath on his cheek, the taste of him, the feel of him, the- Suddenly-Scripps' bedroom door had been thrown open. Instantly, Scripps and Posner sprang apart, as if they had been burned. But it was far too late for that. In the doorway stood a man. A tall man, with a lined face, short, auburn hair and a thick stubble on his square jaw. A man who wore black trousers and a polo shirt, a badge on his chest reading Jack Scripps . His hands were covered in some kind of dirt or oil, which also stained his clothes. And his eyes, older versions of the eyes Posner had been gazing into so blithely just seconds ago, were fixed directly on Scripps' bed. And those who lay upon it. \" Dad ?\"[Chapter 23] Hello everyone! Thank you so much for reading and reviewing, it means so much! Please keep doing so :) Don't be mad at me for some of the comments in this chapter-this is the 80s...hope you enjoy! More soon :) SPOILER: I hope you all haven't forgotten about Dakin... A deafening silence filled Scripps' bedroom. It was as if the entire place had suddenly been plunged under water, muffling all sound, slowing time almost to a standstill. When Scripps was with David, it often felt this way-like they were the only people in the world. However, this was the first time it had ever filled him with dread. Scripps stared at his father in the doorway. Jack Scripps was a tall man, built like a brick wall, with broad shoulders and thick arms, an ex-rugby player physique. His auburn hair had been thinning for a while, the lines on his face slowly forming despite the fact that he was still only thirty-eight years old. Scripps had always put this premature aging down to a lack of sleep and his heavy smoking. Inexplicably home early, his large frame cast a long shadow into Scripps' room. And he was staring right back. A long moment passed in that deathly silence. Scripps felt he was rooted to the spot. Even his breathing seemed to have stopped. He could feel David beside him, his peripheral vision telling him that the boy he loved was equally frozen. Jack Scripps simply continued to stare. His expression was almost completely unreadable. Scripps noted his thick, raised eyebrows. It seemed like a mixture of shock...and anger. His lips had become thin, knitted together as he stared. Scripps saw his father blink hard several times, as if making sure that the scene before his eyes was real. After what seemed like centuries...Jack Scripps stepped backwards out of the room and closed the door. Scripps' stomach had dropped to the floor, jarring painfully as the door banged shut. Scripps' blood had turned ice cold. He turned to face David, whose already porcelain skin had turned even whiter. His mouth hung open slightly. Scripps could see pure fear beginning to brim in his eyes as he looked in horror at him. \"Sc-\" \"Shhh.\" Donald grabbed his hand. He felt at a complete loss. Feeling sick, he held on tightly, not knowing what to do, what was going to happen now, how to deal with this, how to- Then-that thick, deep Yorkshire accent from the hallway: \"Donald. Landing. Now.\" Scripps felt as if all of his insides had disappeared. He stared at the door-then back at David. David was gripping his hand so tightly, looking desperately at him, expecting him to know what to do. Which he did not. Of course not. He had never dreamed that this situation would ever occur. He'd never even considered telling his parents the truth about him and David-he'd just assumed that they'd never find out so long and he and David were always out of the house by six-that was when his father usually came home, and his mother even later than that. Scripps simply could not fathom why his father was home at twenty to five in the afternoon. But he was. And Jack Scripps had just come home from work to see his son locked in a tight embrace with another boy, passionately kissing. Scripps felt his cheeks burn. But he had seen. And now he was calling Scripps outside. As he looked into David's wide, fearful eyes…a kind of bravery suddenly filled him. A resolve. He knew he had to go and face his father right that second. Like a man about to walk to the scaffold, Scripps stood up. David held onto his hand, gripping like a vice. Forcing himself to unattached from him, Scripps bent down to kiss his hand. \"Wait here.\" he whispered. He gave David what he hoped was a reassuring smile before kissing his hand again, this time lingering for as long as he dared. Then-he turned to the door. Slowly, he began to walk, feeling as if the floor was suddenly a deep pool he was wading through, the water heavy against his legs. Smoothing his tie and ensuring he didn't look rumpled, he made himself take the doorknob in his hand and turn it. Shutting the door behind him, he looked around to find himself face to face with his father. Scripps forced himself to stand up straight and meet his eye. They were almost the same height, Jack Scripps a couple of inches taller but no more than that. Scripps took a few steps forward, until they were only a few feet apart. He waited. Jack Scripps gave his son a long, searching look and Scripps felt as if he was being X-rayed. The two men stood in silence for what seemed like an entire minute. Then- \"Donald.\" Jack Scripps said, finally. His voice sounded heavy, yet very distant. He took a deep breath. \"What's going on?\" Scripps swallowed, realising how dry his mouth had become. He managed to retain eye contact. \"Dad…I-I'm s-\" He was about to apologise-then stopped himself. \"I-it's-\" \"No.\" Jack looked all around the hall-then suddenly pointed to the staircase. \"Why are you letting the girls watch television on their own? They could have been watching anything, you know what they're like with the remote control, clicking about everywhere.\" Scripps blinked. \"Dad?\" \"I know, I know, I'm rambling, I'm sorry.\" Jack sighed, covering his face with his hands. He looked just as lost as Scripps felt, suddenly much smaller. \"I just don't know how to deal with this kind of thing.\" He looked through his fingers at his son. \"It's a bit of a shock, mate.\" Scripps was confused. He didn't know what he had been expecting but it certainly wasn't this. Jack's hands still covered his face. He looked up at the ceiling as he took a few steps back, leaning on the door behind him. \"Um….\" He looked back at Scripps, taking another deep breath-then stood up straight, arms folded calmly across his chest. \"Right. Okay. So…\" Scripps struggled to understand this reaction. \"Aren't you going to…you know…?\" \"What, shout at you? I feel like I should!\" Jack shook his head. \"But no. Don't see the point really.\" \"The point?\" \"Well….\" Jack shrugged, sighing. \"You're gonna do what you're gonna do. You're an adult now.\" Scripps couldn't hide his surprise. \" Dad ?\" \"Donald, do you think I'm from the Dark Ages?\" Suddenly, Scripps realised his father was smiling sadly at him. \"Look, I don't care. Nothing against…\" He held up his hands, vaguely gesturing. \"I mean, can't say I love the idea of it but…look, whatever. If you're…you know…\" He gestured again. \"You're gonna be, you know...So whatever.\" Scripps couldn't believe it. He stared at his father. Suddenly, the lines on his face, the thinning of his hair, seemed to melt away. Scripps could see the man Jack was rather than the father he'd become. \"Look, I don't know….\" Jack sighed, folded his arms again. \"I don't know anyone who is-\" he coughed. \"queer, but-\" \"I'm not queer , Dad-\" Scripps begun indignantly. \"What you were doing back there looked pretty queer to me.\" Jack's face had broken into a grin, which Scripps, in spite of himself, found himself returning. A small snort escaped him. It was so bizarre, to be stood here, joking with his father while he could still taste David on his lips. It felt very surreal. Even unbelievable. \"Look, like I said, I don't love the idea…\" Jack said clearly, holding his hands up. \"I guess you're glad it was me who caught you though and not your mum!\" \"Well, the idea was that neither of you would.\" Scripps said honestly. \"Yeah, I gathered.\" Jack nodded understandingly. He looked at Scripps again. \"I'd have kept it quiet if I was you as well. You know how people are about…this kind of thing.\" There was an awkward pause. \"You know what your mum thinks.\" \"Yeah…\" Scripps remembered her commentary when there was a news story a month back regarding AIDS. He swallowed hard. \"But I'm not going to ship you off to conversion therapy.\" Jack looked kept looking at Scripps, the sadness clouding his eyes again. \"Look, I wish I hadn't found out this way.\" \"I know, Scripps said apologetically. \"I'm sorry.\" \"You could have told me.\" \"I couldn't-\" \"Oh, mate…\" Jack's face fell. He took a few steps towards Scripps. \"I know how your mother is. But I'm not like that. I don't-I don't want you to think you can't talk to me.\" Scripps swallowed. He could feel heavy wetness prickling behind his eyes. \"You're…you're never really…\" Jack nodded, as if he had known the answer before Scripps even spoke. \"I'm never here.\" \"Yes.\" Scripps said, struggling to keep his voice steady. \"I'm sorry, I know you can't help it, I-\" \"No, Donald, don't…\" Jack was shaking his head. \"I know…\" He stared at Scripps. \"It just makes me wonder how much else I don't know about you….or the girls…\" There was a long silence. Then, in perfect synchronisation: \"I'm sorry.\" The two men smiled, realising what had happened. Scripps blinked hard, fighting back his tears. \"Ah now, none of that.\" Jack quickly turned back into the Yorkshire mechanic he was. His eyes were suddenly shining. \"None of that. I mean, I know you're a nancy but there's no need for that.\" \"Dad!\" Scripps began to laugh. \"I mean, this is hard on me too. It's not every day a man comes home to find his only son is a screaming bender.\" \" Dad !\" \"All those show tunes on the piano…Judy Garland, Gracie Fields, Barbra bloody Streisand…I should have guessed.\" \" DAD !\" \"I know, I know.\" Jack was grinning. \"I have to get used to the idea somehow.\" \"The songs were for David anyway….\" Scripps let his laughter die away as he saw his father's eyes flick to his closed bedroom door. \"That was David?\" \"Yes…\" Scripps swallowed hard. \"That's David.\" Jack pursed his lips together. He leaned back on the wall again, eyes still fixed on the door. Then, he sighed, resolved. \"…is he nice?\" he asked in a strained voice. It was so bizarre Scripps almost burst out laughing again. \"Yes, yes he is.\" \"From school?\" Jack asked awkwardly. \"Yes.\" \"Knew it.\" Jack's eyes had begun to shine again. \"Knew we shouldn't have sent you to that posh all-lads place with no birds.\" \"Dad!\" Scripps giggled. Jack managed to smile back, looking back at his son. He still looked a little shell-shocked. But he was beginning to look a little more relaxed. \"Right. I'm going to do the tea for a change. You…both…can come down for it in like half an hour. I'm going to go to your sisters.\" Jack started towards the stairs. \"I'd like to meet…him.\" Suddenly, he put a hand on Scripps's shoulder. Scripps started. It was such a foreign touch. He doubted his father had physically touched him in years. It was strange…but nice. They stood like that for a moment. Scripps could almost feel tears behind his eyes again. \"You make sure you tell him what a scary dad you've got so he doesn't mess you around.\" \" Dad !\" Scripps began to laugh again, finding his voice strangely high-pitched with emotion. \"I haven't suddenly morphed into your daughter!\" Jack grinned, removing his hand, before jogging heavily down the stairs, leaving Scripps breathing hard behind him. A hand had flown to his shoulder as he blinked back the tears. He couldn't believe what had just happened…it was as if he had met his father for the first time….but there wasn't time to dwell now. David was still in his room. He turned around, unsure what to say to him, but feeling this strange sense of comfort. As if everything would somehow be alright….for now...[Chapter 24] Hello everyone! Hope you enjoy this chapter! Thank you so much for reading, and do please review if you like! I'd love to hear your thoughts. I apologize for another rushed chapter-it has been incredibly busy! But I love posting this, so I hope you guys still have fun reading :) xxx It was amazing how quickly one could go from being completely grateful and amazed by someone to wanting to kill them. Scripps sat at the kitchen table, tapping his leg exasperatedly. To his right, Maisie and Lily were happily tucking into their egg and chips, just about the only thing their father could cook that didn't come out of a tin. They were chatting and laughing, but Scripps was preoccupied. To his left, David was listening to the girls and smiling determinedly, not saying a word, not touching his food. His eyes kept darting to the head of the table, where Jack Scripps sat. Staring. Eyes narrowed. Scripps couldn't believe his dad. He'd assumed he was joking with the protective father act. But now, here he was, eyeing Posner as if he was some kind of dangerous gangster type with a motorbike and a gun, rather than the nervous-looking mousy schoolboy he was. It would be laughable if it wasn't so embarrassing. Jack had stiffly shaken David's hand when they'd come downstairs, grunted a greeting-then had begun this act. David was all but walking straight out of the door five minutes after meeting him. Jack had immediately sat down heavily in his seat, beginning this Robert De Nero act, staring, arms folded, eyes narrowed. David's eyes widened, fear beginning to creep back into them as Maisie had dragged him off by the hand to look at her toy ponies in the living room. But before Scripps had got a chance to follow-Jack had given him the ghost of a wink. Typical . \" I thought you said he was great about it ?\" David had hissed to Scripps, kneeling on the carpet beside Maisie as she made a plastic pony gallop along his arm. Scripps sighed exasperatedly. \" Just ignore him .\" he'd muttered back, patting his shoulder. \" It's his idea of a joke. \" \" He doesn't look like he's joking to me !\" And now David sat at the kitchen table, looking as if he was awaiting torture, while Jack regarded him as such a criminal, a pantomime of a protective father. Scripps wanted to hide under the table. He saw David bite his lip as Jack devoured a chip with far more ferocity than was necessary. Rolling his eyes, he reached out under the table to put a hand on David's knee. He felt David's cold little hand pat it gratefully, resting atop it. Looking back up at his father, who was still glaring at David as if he was a small insect crawling on the table, Scripps raised his eyebrows meaningfully at Jack, trying to communicate without words how much he needed him to stop mucking about. But this only seemed to spur him on. \"So, David …\" he said suddenly, making David jump out of his skin. Scripps could see that glint in his father's eye as he relished this, though he kept his mouth a straight line of severity. \"Where is it you applied?\" David swallows hard, as if he was scared of getting the answer wrong. \"Cambridge.\" \"Ah!\" His eyes flipped to Scripps, the corner of his mouth twitching. \"So this is your competition, hey, lad?\" \"Well, it's not like we're applying for the same college.\" Scripps said smoothly, as David had begun to blush. \"All the same though, isn't it?\" Jack said, feigning stupidity. He flashed dangerous eyes at David. \"Well, you know what they say; friends close, enemies closer…\" Scripps could not believe his father. \" Dad !\" he hissed. \"David's my friend.\" Maisie chirped, egg yolk staining her chin. \"Is he now?\" Jack said, raising a deliberately suspicious eyebrow at David, whose pink hue deepened to magenta. \"And mine!\" Lily piped up, smiling shyly at David. She'd begun to warm to him, tapping her cast with her good arm. Scripps nodded to her encouragingly as he reached over to wipe Maisie's face. \"Yes!\" Maisie sang, trying to dodge the tea towel Scripps was attempting to clean her off with. She grinned at her dad, pointing to Lily's cast. \"David took me to find Lil in the hospital when she got broken.\" Scripps managed to hold her steady to wipe her chin. \"Yeah, he did.\" He gave him a proud smile. David's magenta was quickly turning to scarlet. Jack's other eyebrow had raised. Scripps could see traces of approval in his face, though he struggled to keep his de Nero act going. \"Oh yes?\" \"Yep!\" Maisie giggled, still struggling to get away from the tea towel. \"Even though the nasty boy was being mean.\" Scripps started-he'd forgotten how Dakin had behaved that day. David seemed to be thinking along the same lines as he smiled at Maisie, almost as bashfully as Lily. Jack seemed to have either not understood or not heard the second comment as he regarded David, struggling to keep his face neutral. \"Right then.\" He nodded to David as he wolfed down another forkful of chips. \"Proper local hero, aren't you?\" David looked as if he wished the ground would swallow him up. He looked as if he might speak-then there was a small crash of metal on tiles as his knife tumbled to the floor. \"I'll get it!\" Scripps dived under the table, desperate for the opportunity to mouth a few swearwords. He retrieved the knife and returned it to David, who appeared to be wishing for a meteorite to crash through the ceiling and crush him. \"That was nice , Donald.\" Jack said dryly, relishing David's humiliation. \"Glad chivalry ain't dead, ey?\" Scripps clapped a hand to his mouth to stop himself saying anything to his father. He could feel his own cheeks burning as dark as David's. Looking straight at Jack, he narrowed his eyes and shook his head, jerking his head repeatedly, silently begging him to stop. But yet again, this only seemed to make his eyes brighter. \"Yes, Donald was always a nice lad, weren't you? Very good lad, my son.\" he said, looking directly at David, mouth still a stern line, eyes glittering with mirth. David nodded quickly, staring at the floor. \" Very good lad.\" Jack said shortly. \"Apart from the time you got into your mum's make-up when you were little.\" \" Dad !\" Scripps's hands flew to his forehead as he felt his entire body begin to scorch. Maisie and Lily had already burst out giggling at him-they'd heard this story far too often. \"Will you-\" But then he saw David's face. He was giggling too, his eyes bright. \"Yep, you did.\" Jack said, his face still a mask, mouth serious, eyes glinting. \"Didn't you, lad? It was my birthday and all my mates were round for beers. You must have been four years old-you and that bear of yours got into Mum's make-up bag and found her lipstick, didn't you?\" Scripps was still looking at David. Even though he was laughing at him-Scripps realised how immediately more relaxed he'd become when the focus was off of him. \"All over you it was-bright pink.\" Jack was saying, the corner of his mouth beginning to twitch. \"There I was, a twenty-four year old lad with all my mates there, and here was my lad covered in lipstick like a miniature Lily Savage.\" Scripps paused-then determinedly smiled stiffly at his father, squeezing David's knee as he giggled. \"I remember.\" Scripps said, shaking his head. \"I thought it was a crayon.\" \"Sure you did.\" Jack raised an eyebrow. \"Like I said earlier-the signs were all there, weren't they, son? I should have guessed.\" Scripps could have kicked Jack as he looked at him smugly. David was still giggling with the girls. \"Yep.\" he said, bearing the embarrassment for the sake of David. \"I remember Mum whacking me with her hairbrush.\" \"She did, yes.\" Jack nodded. \"Right over the head. That was her way when you were a bairn.\" \"Like Mr Hector.\" Scripps muttered to David, who burst into fresh giggles, before turning back to his father. \"Well, she was only twenty-two, wasn't she? That lipstick probably cost a fortune.\" He shot a quick glance at David, whom he could see was quickly doing the mental mathematics-but he didn't blink, instead giggling again. \"But all in all, you were a good boy, weren't you, lad?\" Jack said, darting a glance over to David. \"A very good lad. Apart from the time you found my old cricket bat and broke your grandma's Lladro lady waving it around, remember Donald?\" \" Okay , Dad.\" Scripps forced himself to smile as David and the girls collapsed laughing. \"You cried, didn't you, Donald?\" Jack said, smirking. \"I was five years old!\" \"And how about the time you were learning to use the toilet and-\" \"ALRIGHT!\" Scripps could put up with a lot, but he was reaching his limit. \"You've had your fun, Dad!\" \"Tell you next time you're here.\" Jack said, giving David the smallest of winks. Despite Scripps's humiliation, he would have gone through worse to see David laughing the way he was, and the way his face lit up at Jack's tiny gesture of friendship. It made him want to both hug and violently shake his father. But sat here, at his kitchen table, being laughed at by his sisters and disgraced by his father, he wouldn't have swapped being here for anywhere else in the world. \"Ready to go?\" Scripps asked, donning his jacket and reaching out to help David with his. \"Hey, I'm not Maisie.\" David grinned, buttoning his own coat. \"Sorry, force of habit. Right, see you later Dad. Bye girls!\" He called into the living room, hoping for a speedy exit. \"Bye!\" called the girls in unison, scribbling away at their drawings. \"Wait!\" Jack Scripps had hurried into the hallway. He folded his arms again, pulling his de Nero face. \"Where are you going again?\" \"To see a play.\" Scripps repeated, edging towards the door as fast as he could. \"Of course.\" Jack said, pretending to roll his eyes. \"Well, David, it was…nice to meet you.\" He kept his stern expression-but gave David a small smile as they shook hands. \"Thank you, sir. You too. I mean-\" David began, still looking nervous. \"That's alright. You're welcome any time, son. Not like you'll see too much of me, ey?\" Jack allowed himself to be friendly-then grinned. \"I'm sure I can find some more stories about Donald for you.\" \"That WON'T be necessary.\" Scripps ushered David closer to the front door, rooting in his pocket for his keys. \"Bye Dad!\" \"Back at a reasonable time, Donald.\" Jack said, going back to his strict persona. \"No staying out all night. Then again, what's the point? You can't exactly get into too much trouble, can you, lad? At least you can't get him pregnant, ey?\" \" DAD !\" Scripps buried his face in his hands, unable to hold back his embarrassment. He could tell David was equally humiliated. It was lucky the hallway was dark because he was sure David was positively purple. \"That's one plus, hey?\" Jack was unfazed, laughing to himself. \"Have a good evening, lads.\" Scripps hurried David out of the front door and into the street as quickly as he could. \"I am so so sorry!\" he rushed, shaking his head. \"It's his idea of fun, I'm so sorry!\" \"Hey, it's okay!\" David was actually laughing. \"At least he doesn't mind us.\" \"I know right!\" Scripps felt like jumping for joy. \"I told you everything would be okay,\" he said, grabbing David's hand in the dark of the night and squeezing it quickly. He looked up to the smoggy dark grey sky and silently thanked God for his father's acceptance. \"I couldn't get used to you being called Donald.\" David said, his head to one side. \"You've always been Scrippsy.\" \"It's only you who calls me that. I'm just plain Scripps mostly.\" \"But you're my Scrippsy.\" David leaned up to peck his cheek. \"Okay, I'm going to vomit.\" Scripps made retching sounds, before grinning and throwing an arm around David as they walked down the street. \"Imagine what a field day my dad would have if he heard you call me something as sickeningly sweet as that.\" He bent over, pretending to spew on the pavement. \"Shut up, Donald .\" David teased, flicking his arm. \"Oh heck, especially don't call me that.\" \"I sort of like it.\" David said thoughtfully. \"It's very…dignified.\" \"David, darling, it's the name of a duck.\" Both boys cracked up laughing again as they turned off onto the main road, which was lined with bushes. It was entirely pleasant to walk beside David in the light of the streetlamps, the cold of the night air biting at their cheeks, leaves rustling beside them in the wind. \"Did your dad mean it when he said \"Don't stay out all night?\"\" David asked suddenly. Scripps blinked. \"I doubt he'd notice one way or the other. Why, are you planning on an all-nighter?\" David scoffed. \"Yeah, as if. My parents are even stricter than your dad was pretending to be. But…\" He leaned his head on Scripps' shoulder. \"As we had such a lovely time in your room…just us on your bed…Well…\" David slipped his hand through Scripps's arm, his voice becoming more hushed. \"I certainly wouldn't mind…if you wanted to…\" His lips drew closer to Scripps's ear. \"…maybe…?\" \"…Yes?\" Scripps was rather enjoying all this attention-but his eyebrow was raised. \"Maybe…felt you could…climb up the drainpipe…through my bedroom window…and then…\" \"David!\" Scripps pulled away, shocked. He tried to ignore how fast his heart had begun to race. \"What do I look like, bloody Spiderman?\" he asked, slightly breathless. \"I think you could.\" David hadn't given up. He slipped both hands through Scripps' arm, reaching up again to whisper in his ear. Scripps tried not to notice how this made his legs feel as unsteady as a foal's. \"I think you could…and if you did…I think you might…\" David paused for a second, as if daring himself. \"I think you might like what you found there.\" His voice had become placed the softest kiss on Scripps' neck. As he was sure David wanted the effect to be, the insides of Scripps's body had turned entirely to mush… \"I think you might…\" David kissed him again-a very different sort of kiss… \"like it very much…\" \"…David…\" Scripps began, dreading the answer. \"What exactly are you suggesting?\" David kissed him again, letting his soft lips linger on Scripps's neck far longer than he should have. The feel of his warm breath made Scripps's head spin dizzily. \"I think you know exactly what I'm suggesting…\" David whispered. Scripps shook his head, clenching his teeth with the effort of refusing perhaps the most tempting offer he had ever been faced with. \"Look, David, as much as…I mean…it's not you…David you know I can't- David !\" \"What-oh!\" David cried out in shock as Scripps suddenly pulled him into the bushes by the side of the road. He let out a small scream as he fell backwards onto the soil beneath them, still in Scripps' arms, twigs and leaves scratching at him-then another scream as Scripps fell down directly on top of him. \"Scripps! What's the hell are you doing?\" \"Shhh!\" Scripps begged. He gestured frantically behind them. \"It's my mum's car. She's driving home.\" He closed his mouth sharply and stayed absolutely still, willing David to do the same. Sure enough, behind them came the sound of a car, driving slowly along the road. Scripps was completely frozen. He waited until the car had turned the corner towards Scripps' street. Then, he allowed himself to breathe out. \"Sorry.\" \"Scrippsy!\" David hissed angrily. \"Did you really need to push us into these bushes! I'm literally lying in mud!\" \"I'm sorry.\" Scripps apologised, breathing hard. \"I…I guess I just panicked…\" Posner looked up at him, beginning to look sad. \"Is she really that bad? Scripps bit his lip. He sighed, leaning on his elbow. \"She's….I guess she's….\" He sighed again, feeling extremely awkward. \"Look, enough about Mum, hey?\" \"Sorry.\" David nodded, quickly catching on. He grinned up at Scripps impishly. \"Oh, Scrippsy, all your talk about abstaining for God and here you are, throwing me into the bushes and pinning me down…\" \"Oh!\" Scripps realised he was still on top of David. \"I'm so sorry, did I crush you?\" he asked worriedly. \"Oh, shut up, Scrippsy, you know I don't care.\" David grabbed Scripps's face in his hands and kissed him hungrily. \"Just stop being worried. Let go.\" \"Says you.\" Scripps murmured into David's mouth, but before long he was absorbed in his kisses. \"Very classy, here in this bush.\" he managed to say. \"I think it's romantic.\" purred David into Scripps's neck. \"This is the kind of exciting date I wanted.\" \"Well, that's good then-\" Scripps said, before David's kisses silenced him again. It didn't matter about the dirt, or the leaves, or the scratching twigs. Scripps closed his eyes, completely lost in the boy he loved. He wasn't sure where David ended and he began-they were a single entity, bound together. It felt so entirely right…as he had on his bed, Scripps wished he could stay here in David's arms forever, with nothing to do except love him… He found himself relaxing completely as he lazily buried his fingers in David's hair… \" Oh !\" Suddenly, David recoiled, breaking the kiss so abruptly Scripps felt dazed. \"Scripps, did you just fart ?\" A loud snort escaped Scripps's nostrils. \"Sorry.\" he said sheepishly. \"Oh God, you are disgusting !\" David wriggled out from underneath him. \"Ugh!\" \"Come on, David, like you've never done it!\" Scripps found himself beginning to laugh. \"Never while kissing you!\" David said, sounding utterly furious as he stood up. \"Oh bloody hell, I hate you so much…stop laughing ! How old are you?\" \"Sorry!\" Scripps chuckled. \"Oh, you don't hate me,\" He stood up, following David out of the bushes. He wrapped his arms around his waist. \"Everyone does it. Come on!\" \"No!\" David struggled out of his arms and began to march down the road in the direction of the town centre and the theatre. \"Oh, that was so gross…\" \"Just going to leave me here, are you?\" Scripps still couldn't stop laughing. \"Baby, come back to me!\" he called after him melodramatically. \"No!\" \"Or am I going to have to catch you?\" \"I'd like to see you try!\" Scripps grinned, then ran after him down the dark street.[Chapter 25] Hey guys! Happy Easter/other holiday/general Spring happiness! I hope you enjoy this chapter. More soon! Thank you so much for reading and reviewing-always appreciated. Big love xxx As per, I own nothing :P \" I walked into a honkey tonkey just the other day I dropped a nickel in the juke box just to hear it play I didn't have no tune in mind, I didn't wait to choose Just dropped a nickel in the slot and I played the juke box blues ! Wooo!\" Posner spun around and around, one arm hooked around a lamppost, the other flying out beside him. A huge grin was spread across his face as he sang into the dark, chilly evening Sheffield just for the sheer joy. He filled his lungs with the crisp air as he whirled faster and faster. \"Wooooooo!\" he cried out to the skies, feeling so young, so alive. \"That's a great way to get stabbed you know, love?\" Scrippsy was following behind, arms folded, laughing. Posner loved it when Scripps laughed-it made him feel like the entire world was laughing with him. \"Don't you like my singing?\" He twirled round to face him, still hanging from the lamppost, eyes deliberately large. \"You know I love it, Gene Kelly,\" Scripps grinned. \"I wish I had my piano handy-it's hard to cram into my bag, you see.\" \"Ha ha.\" Posner let go of the post, practically skipping back to Scripps. \"Am I embarrassing you?\" he asked, smiling like the Cheshire Cat. \"Goodness no.\" Scripps caught him in his arms, sighing long-sufferingly-but he couldn't help smiling. \"I'm over the moon you're so cheerful.\" \"Sing with me, then.\" Posner demanded playfully, slipping his arm through Scripps's as they carried on walking towards the theatre. \"No!\" Scripps rolled his eyes, still laughing. \"You know I can't sing. And I'd like us to get to the theatre un-assaulted.\" \"I've never heard you sing!\" \"You must have!\" \"Well, not properly!\" Posner wasn't going to give up. \"Scrippsy, I'm so happy! I really want you to sing with me.\" \"Darling, as much as you would like it to be, this is not the set of Funny Girl . You are not Barbra Streisand. I am not Omar Sharif. This is Sheffield at night and we are a couple of schoolboys walking arm in arm. Ergo, drawing attention is a recipe for disaster.\" \"Oh, don't be so sensible all the time!\" Posner smiled playfully. \"Do you want me to let go of your arm?\" he teased. \"Don't you bloody dare.\" Scripps held on tighter, pulling him closer. Posner felt his entire body warm up, down to the cockles of his heart. \"Sing then, or I will.\" \"This is emotional manipulation.\" Scripps grinned, shaking his head. \"You'll have to let go anyway in a minute, when we see the others. I'm not going to prance down the street like it's the fucking yellow brick road.\" \"Just sing quietly, then.\" Posner slowed their pace down and leaned his head close to Scripps's. \"Come on, Scrippsy, please? I really want to hear you sing.\" \"No!\" Scripps protested, though Posner could tell he liked their closeness. \"I'm not going to start singing walking down the main road in public!\" \"There's hardly anyone about! That's not an excuse…come on, Scrippsy,\" Posner snuggled into his shoulder, looking up at him. \" Please ?\" \"No!\" Scripps laughed. \"Not all of us have a gorgeous voice like you, love.\" \"I bet you do. You have such a lovely speaking voice. Come on !\" They turned the corner into the street where the small theatre the community amateur dramatics group hired out. There were far more people now-mostly old couples and middle-aged women, some of whom had children with them. Posner questioned the wisdom of this, considering the subject matter of The Crucible , but he was too busy bugging Scripps to think too much about it. The small crowd was slowly thinning into the main doors, going to take their seats before the show started-but a group of five teenage boys were congregated outside a small off-licence beside the venue. Reluctantly, Posner slipped his arm from Scripps's, feeling the cold bite him a little as he did. \"I'll make you sing sometime…\" \"No you won't.\" Scripps grinned smugly at him. \"Just let me accompany you when you sing, okay?\" \"Always.\" Posner looked at him adoringly-then narrowed his eyes. \"But I will make you sing, Scrippsy, just you wa-OH MY GOD RUDGE IS ON FIRE!\" \"HA!\" Timms roared with laughter as he dropped his cigarette lighter to the ground. He pointed at where Rudge had thrown his a second before. \"HA! You pussy!\" \"No!\" Rudge leapt down to scrabble for it, amongst jeers from Lockwood and Akthar. \"Rematch! I wasn't ready!\" \"Bollocks!\" Timms shouted, folding his arms and smirking. \"I won, fair and square.\" \" Rematch, rematch !\" Lockwood chanted, egging Rudge on. \"Come on, guys, that was fucking hilarious!\" \"What's going on?\" Scripps skidded to a halt in front of them. He'd run automatically as soon as David had cried out-but as he stopped and let his eyes focus, he realised that there was no carnage, certainly no burning Rudge and no evidence of flames at all…then he spotted the lighters. He gave a huge sigh of exasperation as David reached the scene, panting behind him. \"You scared the life out of me! Don't you know the difference between fire and smoking ?\" \"What the fuck?\" Timms had heard Posner scream and was killing himself laughing, leaning on Lockwood for support. \"Shit, Poz, what's wrong with you?\" \"No, you weren't smoking!\" David gasped, getting his breath back. \"Rudge's leg-!\" But more laughs boomed out into the night before he could continue. Scripps frowned. \"What are you doing?\" Timms grinned wickedly, holding up the lighter. \"You can watch-we're having a rematch. Ready this time, Rudge?\" \"Fuck yeah.\" Rudge bent down and rolled his trouser leg to his knee, skin hairy, browned and bruised from rugby. Timms did the same, to cheers from Lockwood and Akthar, his chubby pale leg almost glowing in the darkness. As soon as they did so-Scripps caught on to what was happening. \"Oh, for fuck's sake, how old are you, twelve ?\" He shook his head in disbelief-then again, this was Timms and Rudge. \"Right. On my count.\" Timms was holding the cigarette lighter a few inches above his exposed skin. Rudge nodded, holding his likewise. \"Oh, give over, Scripps!\" Lockwood called over, kneeling down between the boys to judge the match. \"You don't have to be a prefect now.\" Scripps shrugged. \"On your head be it.\" he said, settling to watch. \"What's going on?\" David asked, straightening up. \"Awh Poz,\" Akthar chuckled. \" Someone never had any friends in the lower school.\" David opened his mouth indignantly-but Scripps bent his head to explain. \"It's the dumbest thing. A playground craze. I have to break it up at school all the time when I'm on duty. You get the lighters-\" \"Three!\" Timms called out. \"-then hold the flame as close to your leg as you can-\" \"Two!\" \"-and whoever wusses out first loses.\" \"One!\" Timms yelled, eyeing Rudge like a hawk, who was staring back, hand poised to flick the lighter. \"GO!\" Quick as a flash, both flames flickered far too close for comfort to the boys' skin. Scripps folded his arms to watch, realising what David must have seen. He felt like he should stop them-but then again, as Lockwood had said, he wasn't a Prefect here. He looked over to David, who was watching the contest with an equal mix of curiosity and dread. Even as the competing boys moved the flames closer, so they must have felt the heat strongly, Scripps was unconcerned. No one ever got burned playing this-well, not that he'd seen. But he could see the first traces of Timms beginning to bite his lip already as the lighter licked his plump calf. It would all be over in a few seconds. His money was on Rudge this time, who looked far more confident. Right on cue, Rudge moved the lighter even closer to his skin- \"Whoa!\" Rudge dropped the lighter as quickly as he could, leaping away from it. Instantly there was a roar of victory from Timms-but Scripps turned to where Rudge was nursing his calf-and spotted a small bald patch. \"I burned my fucking leg hair off!\" Instantly, all the boys, including Scripps, collapsed laughing while Rudge rubbed his patch, barely the size of a twenty pence piece. \"You fucking pillock!\" Timms yelled. \"I win again, you pussy!\" \"No!\" Rudge protested, standing up straight, wobbling slightly. \"I got the flame closest!\" \"You dropped first!\" Timms retorted, still laughing hard. \"Rematch?\" Lockwood suggested. \"No way!\" Akthar chimed in. \"We have to give this one to Timms.\" \"In fairness, like five hairs died for Rudge's title.\" Scripps pointed out for the hell of it. \"Five hard-earned leg hairs!\" \"Thought you were too mature and good to get involved in something like this, Saint Scripps .\" came a drawling voice from the shadows. A handsome, dark-haired boy had appeared, one thick eyebrow raised. \"Oh, hi Dakin,\" Scripps smiled at the approaching Dakin as the argument continued amongst the other boys. \"Didn't see you there.\" \"No?\" Dakin threw his arms around Scripps in an unexpected hug. It could not have lasted for more than a second-none of the other boys noticed. Scripps awkwardly patted him on the back, spotting David over his shoulder, who was pretending to be very interested in the \"Closed\" sign on the door of the off-licence. \"Well, you see me now.\" Dakin had broken the hug as quickly as he'd begun it. He was staring intensely into Scripps' eyes, his deep brown ones seeming to cut right through Scripps's \"I sure do?\" Scripps said, trying to keep his voice casual and friendly, vaguely aware of Rudge rugby-tackling Timms in the background. \"Good to see you, hey mate?\" \"I know.\" Dakin treated Scripps to that boyishly cheeky yet darkly sexy half-smile that had used to drive Posner so crazy. Being on the receiving end, Scripps couldn't help but slightly see why… \"It's always good to see me.\" Dakin was quipping. \"A ha ha ha ha!\" Scripps forced himself to laugh, dimly aware of David still staring at the shop window behind. \"Hadn't we better start getting in there? Don't want to miss Crowther, hey?\" \"Oh Scripps, haven't you read The Crucible ?\" Dakin took a step even closer. \"Crowther won't be on for ages ….John only appears to see Abigail after all the business with Betty.\" \"Yes yes, I know!\" Scripps determinedly kept his voice light, taking a subtle step backwards. \"Anyone with an English GCSE knows The Crucible . Even so, we shouldn't walk in late.\" \"You're right…as always, hey, Pope Scrippsy?\" Dakin said, a slightly groaning edge to his voice. It was, even Scripps had to admit, incredibly sexy. \"Completely infallible, aren't you…\" he murmured, leaning his face closer to Scripps's…. \"You'll sit next to me, right?\" he almost whispered. \"Er, sure.\" Scripps said, taking another, less subtle, step backwards. He felt his brows beginning to knit together in confusion. Why was Dakin-? \"Good!\" Dakin's voice had suddenly become louder and more natural as he stepped away from Scripps. \"Come on, we're going in!\" he shouted to the others, who had finally stopped scrapping. Ignoring them, Scripps crossed the pavement to find David. \"Okay, love?\" he whispered to him. \"Of course.\" David turned around to smile at him. \"You'll sit next to me, right?\" Scripps felt a strange sensation in his stomach. \"Of course.\" he replied, with far more conviction this time. \"I'll have to-you might cry at the end.\" he teased. \"Ha!\" David scoffed. \" You might.\" \"Well, we'll have to comfort each other then. Come on,\" Scripps gestured to the main doors. He could still feel that sensation-like thousands of snakes were fighting inside him. It was so uncomfortable. It was...like something awful was about to happen...But he ignored it as best he could, reaching out to squeeze David's hand. \"Lets do this then.\"[Chapter 26] Hello everyone! Thank you so much for reading and reviewing, it means the world :) Please continue to do so, I love hearing your thoughts. Hope you enjoy this, more soon! As per I own nothing. Hugs xxx \" My wife will never die for me! I will bring your guts into your mouth but that goodness will not die for me!\" Crowther's desperate shout echoed to the back of the theatre as he clutched tightly to the woman playing his servant, fighting against her struggles, weeping and protesting. His face was twisted in a grimace of agony, crying almost to the heavens as well as to the wretched Mary Warren. In the auditorium, every single audience member watched, enraptured. \" I cannot, I cannot….\" Scripps was sitting bolt upright, back poker straight. To his left, Dakin slouched, leaning on one arm of his seat, but he was watching Crowther intently. To his right, David leaned forward, eyes glued to the stage. Beside them sat Rudge, Timms, Lockwood and Akthar respectively, all equally in awe of their classmate's talent. Scripps couldn't believe it-he'd known Crowther was good at drama, but this good? The way he played Proctor…he was practically professional standard. Scripps couldn't help but wonder why on Earth he was applying for Oxford when he had this under his belt. As if to prove Scripps' point, Crowther was crying out his closing lines straight to the skies. \"… we are what we always were, but naked now!\" His entire body was trembling with emotion as Mary Warren sobbed beside him, keeled over. Crowther's voice rose to a great boom once again as he threw his head back, eyes filled with dread. \" Ay, naked! And the wind, God's icy wind, will blow!\" With that-the lights were out. The theatre was plunged into complete darkness for a couple of seconds…but as the lights came on-the curtain had been drawn, and the majesty of Crowther was gone. The entire theatre burst into rapturous applause as the house lights lifted, signalling the fifteen-minute interval before the second half would begin. Scripps joined in enthusiastically, hoping Crowther could hear so he knew what an amazing job he was doing. \"Hey, get Crowther!\" Lockwood called as the audience began to file out into the foyer and bar area. \"I know right?\" Timms called back. \"Old Hector would be wetting himself!\" \"The poor lad would have a free pass for the feel mobile all term!\" Akthar joked to appreciative laughter. \"Isn't he amazing?\" David looked back to Scripps, who was following close behind him. \"He is!\" Scripps grinned back. \"Il est incroyable!\" \"Mais oui!\" David lead him over to a corner of the foyer while most of the other boys went to the bar. \"This is exactly the kind of date I wanted.\" he said shyly, leaning against the wall and lowering his voice. \"It's exactly what I wanted.\" \"What, with all the others there too?\" Scripps nudged him playfully. \"Well…in the dark I can pretend they're not there.\" David shrugged, then looked up at Scripps with a glint in his spaniel eyes. \"Anyway, what happened to the French? It was really enhancing the experience!\" Scripps laughed, feeling his features soften. \"Oh Poz….fine. Right…French…er…Je voudrais travailler dans… une maison de passe !\" \" Scrippsy !\" David giggled, pretending to slap him. \"I'm going to the loo anyway. See you in a minute-maybe you can think of some nicer French phrases to say to me!\" He smiled cheekily up at Scripps, blowing him the quickest kiss. \"Anything you say.\" Scripps smiled softly back and raised a hand in farewell as David left him, disappearing into the chattering crowds towards the toilets. He watched him go until the mousy head had completely vanished…Scripps leaned back on the wall, folding his arms and thinking about Crowther's performance again. Knowing how the play ended, he reckoned he'd have to do some serious emotional distancing not to shed a tear. Scripps was a big softie really-he often found himself welling up at Maisie and Lily's Disney movies. Normally, he was overwhelmingly embarrassed by this fact-but somehow he felt, if it was just David, he wouldn't mind crying a little. David made him so comfortable…their new relationship built on the solid foundation of years of close friendship seemed to Scripps absolutely unbreakable, a stronghold just for them. If, as he suspected, he would love David for the rest of his life, he'd definitely cry in front of him at some point… Wait. For the rest of his life ? Scripps forced himself to mentally take a step backwards. He was being stupid, ridiculous and rash and stupid…but to hold his best friend for as long as there was air in his lungs… \"Alright, you loner? Scripps was suddenly yanked back to reality and found himself face to face with a handsome pair of dark eyes, framed by thick eyebrows. \"Oh, hi Dakin!\" he said quickly. \"Sorry, I must have zoned out.\" \"Yeah, I can see that. You were like Hermione in The Winter's Tale .\" Dakin gave a mischievous, boyish half-smile. \"Oh yeah?\" Scripps laughed, pretending to freeze like a statue. \"Well, I've transformed back now, Leontes.\" \"Who the fuck is Leontes ?\" Dakin frowned. \"He's…he's Hermione's husband…the mad king?\" Scripps prompted, shrinking back down into himself, feeling embarrassed on Dakin's behalf. The focus of half the play? \"Oh, right, sure.\" Dakin said hurriedly, trying to smooth over his mistake. \"Been a while since I read any Shakespeare at all. Anyway, will you come outside with me a minute? I want a smoke.\" Scripps was surprised. He glanced over to Rudge, Timms, Akthar and Lockwood, who were all beside the bar. \"Er…aren't any of the others going?\" \"Nah, they said they weren't going to bother.\" Dakin lied so smoothly Scripps almost believed him. \"Besides.\" That dashing half-smile returned. \"I'd sooner go with you. You have the capability to talk about something other than girls or farting.\" Scripps snorted. He looked quickly in the direction of the male toilets. There was no sign of David at all. \"Looking for Posner?\" Dakin said, a glint in his eye. Scripps started-it was as if he'd read his mind. \"There was a queue for the bogs. He'll be ages. Come on, let's go out for a bit. Jesus I need the air.\" Hands tied, Scripps followed Dakin outside, through the main doors so they wound up beside the same off-licence. The air was a lot colder now, the streets practically empty. Scripps shoved his hands in his pockets as he watched Dakin light up, wishing he'd stayed inside. He hoped David wouldn't be looking for him before Dakin was finished. Dakin himself seemed to be quite happy to take his time, inhaling deeply, leaning against the wall beside Scripps. \"Enjoying the show?\" Scripps said, keen for conversation to speed things along. \"Yep.\" Dakin said vaguely. \"Crowther's not doing a bad job.\" \"Yeah, he's great.\" A pause. \"So,\" Dakin looked up at him, blowing smoke rings into the crisp air. \"Why are you and Poz so attached at the hip these days?\" Scripps coughed awkwardly. \"We've always been mates, you know that.\" \"Yeah, but why especially now?\" Dakin probed. His voice was light and casual, but there was some kind of undertone to it that Scripps could not place. \"Like, you guys are literally never apart. Everyone is wondering.\" Scripps paused-then pretended to sigh. \"Awh mate, you know Poz is delicate. He needs supporting.\" He felt guilty for his not-quite-lie, but managed to meet Dakin's eye. \"He just needs a good mate, right?\" \"And you're the Good Samaritan.\" Dakin said, rolling his eyes. \" Delicate ,\" he spat. \"More like a wuss.\" \"Come on, don't be like that.\" All Scripps's strength was devoted to keeping his voice casual and level. \"That's the patriarchal standards for masculinity talking.\" \"How dare you call me unevolved?\" Dakin flashed Scripps another handsome grin, before going back to his questioning tone. \"Don't you get bored with him? He can be so melodramatic and annoying. I mean, there's being a good bloke and just indulging him. He'd be better liked if he was just…you know…more chilled. Cooler about stuff. You know?\" Scripps looked up at the smoggy sky, pursing his lips together to fight back the retorts building in his throat. \"Ah Dakin, we don't all have your natural social gifts!\" he joked desperately. \"I mean, I get he's in love with me, but he could just chill about it a bit. Is that what you talk about?\" Dakin took another drag, looking searchingly at Scripps. \"No.\" Scripps answered truthfully. \"Really?\" Dakin looked surprised. But quickly, he smoothed out his features. \"You know, if you keep hanging around with him, people will think you're gay.\" Scripps shrugged to hide a snort of laughter. \"They will, you know.\" Dakin pressed. He stared hard at him. \"Lots of people already think you are.\" There was another pause. \"Well, I don't really care.\" Scripps said, trying to avoid what Dakin was getting at. \"It's just a rumour.\" \"Well, could you confirm or deny it for me?\" \"What?\" Scripps took a step backwards, forcing himself to laugh in disbelief. \"What do you mean?\" \"Could you comfirm-\" Dakin took a step closer to him. \"-Or deny-\" He took another step. \"-that you are in love with me.\" His eyes were intense, cutting into Scripps like chocolate brown blades. Scripps was taken aback. He blinked at Dakin, who now stood barely a foot from him, so close he could smell the tobacco on his breath. Then-he began to laugh, shaking his head in amazement. \"Fucking hell, Dakin, what do you think?\" \"Well, I don't know.\" Dakin blinked, his eyes wide. \"You might well be.\" \"Shit, Dakin, how thick are you?\" Scripps was laughing harder, a feeling of nervousness growing inside him. \"Of course I'm not! Look, come on, we'd better get back inside.\" he hinted desperately. Dakin gave him a long look. \"I don't believe you.\" \"What do you mean, you don't believe me?\" Scripps buried his head in his hands, sliding them down his face. \"Dakin, what the hell are you talking about?\" \"I know you were having cosy chats with Hector about being in love with someone. And I know you're suddenly attached to Posner, and it can't be because he's good company because frankly he pisses me off. So what on earth could you guys have in common?\" Dakin raised a thick eyebrow. \"I'm not thick, Scripps.\" \"You're fucking insane.\" Scripps struggled to keep his voice even. \"Absolutely fucking crazy.\" \"I'm not,\" Dakin took yet another step towards him. He looked at the ground-then looked back up at Scripps. \"Look, I'm sure you are. You're not weird like Posner but you could have hidden it better. I've caught you staring strangely at me for weeks. You've been avoiding me for weeks. You looked so pleased when Poz pretended to fucking divorce me. Come on, Scripps, don't be an arsehole. You know its true.\" Scripps could feel himself growing hotter. His heart had begun to pump faster, as if he was preparing to jump off a cliff. \"Dakin-\" he began, making his voice as calm as possible. \"You can't seriously believe that-\" \"Prove it.\" \"What?\" \"Prove it.\" That incredibly seductive half-smile was playing around Dakin's lips. There was triumph in his eyes as he looked at Scripps, as if he was an alligator and Scripps a baby gazelle. \"Prove you're not in love with me.\" \"How?\" Scripps was more confused than ever. He could scarcely believe this was happening. \"Kiss me.\" \" What ?\" Scripps jumped backwards about a foot, so shocked he nearly fell over. He forgot to be calm and casual, voice raising. \"What the fuck , Dakin?\" \"Kiss me.\" Dakin stepped towards him again, a glint in those handsome eyes. He flashed another well-practised half-smile, dripping with sexiness. \"If you don't love me, it won't mean anything. If you do…now's your chance. Kiss me.\" \"NO!\" Scripps felt his heartbeat seem to triple in speed. A sick feeling was creeping into his stomach. \"Dakin, you're mad. You're mad if you think I'm going to-\" \"Oh, go on. Live a little.\" Suddenly, Dakin shot out a hand and gripped Scripps' forearm. His hand was hot and rough, uncomfortably tight. \"It'll be fun. No one's around. Just do it. I know you want to. And I want you to do it. Kiss me.\" \" What ?\" Scripps felt like Alice in Wonderland, tumbling down and down into a world of madness, where everything was upside down. \"Dakin, this isn't funny!\" \"Come on, just do it.\" Dakin tightened his grip. \"If you don't love me, it won't mean anything. It's not like you're seeing anyone. And Fiona doesn't matter. You'll like it, I promise. I don't care what you say about all your God stuff and not wanking-we're just a pair of horny teenagers looking for an outlet. And I'm offering to be yours. Because I'd like to use you too.\" Dakin grinned that almost irresistible smile, his eyes more intense than Scripps had ever seen anyone's before. \"You'll like it! It's just a fucking kiss.\" Scripps tried to catch his breath. He struggled to release his arm from Dakin's grip. \"I can't kiss you, Dakin! I won't!\" \"Alright.\" Dakin raised his eyebrows. There was a gleam in his eyes, shining brighter than the moon in the sky. \"I'll make it easier, shall I?\" Half a second. Not even that. Before- Dakin had crushed his soft, full lips against Scripps's.[Chapter 27] Hey everyone! Thank you so much for reading and reviewing-please keep doing so if you'd like! More soon, much love xxx Scripps felt as though his entire body had frozen. He couldn't move. He simply couldn't move. Perhaps it was the shock of it, perhaps the intensity. It was as if Dakin wasn't really kissing him, as if it was happening in a dream…a nightmare. He was too stunned to even close his mouth. He simply stood, rooted to the spot, hands hanging limply, legs locked. It was only when he felt Dakin's tongue, warm and well-practised, enter his mouth-that he was suddenly jolted back to his senses. \" No !\" Scripps broke away from Dakin, staggering backwards a few feet, wiping his mouth hard with the back of his sleeve. He had begun to feel sick. \"Dakin, what the fuck ?\" he shouted, reeling. \"Jesus, Scripps!\" Dakin looked shocked, but he was laughing. \"What's wrong with you? It's just a fucking kiss!\" \"Oh….oh no no no no…\" Scripps ran his hands through his hair, staggering slightly, shaking his head. \"No no no no…\" The spectre of David had appeared before him as he still tasted Dakin inside his mouth…his heart had begun to race. \" What ?\" Dakin looked amazed, arms spread wide. \"What's the problem?\" An evil glint had appeared in his eyes. \"There. I knew you loved me.\" He declared in triumph. \"I knew it. Otherwise it wouldn't have meant anything.\" Finally, Scripps managed to raise his head to stare at Dakin. The boy suddenly didn't look so handsome. There was a kind of insanity in his victory, something almost threatening. Scripps scrubbed hard against his mouth with the back of his hand, gazing at Dakin in disbelief. \"Dakin, that's…Dakin…\" He managed to stand up straight, gathering all his courage. \"Dakin, get this into your head,\" He made his voice steady and clear, looking him straight in the eye. \" I am not in love with you .\" Dakin laughed, shrugging. \" Sure you're not. Anyway it doesn't matter. It's not like I'm asking you to marry me.\" He took a step closer towards Scripps. \"You're not exactly my first choice in the world either. You know me, Scripps. All I want is-\" \" No , Dakin, you don't understand.\" Scripps stepped backwards, holding up his hands. It took all of his strength to keep his voice calm and measured. \"I cannot give you what you want. I can't be your…whatever you want me to be. I can't…I'm-I'm very…. flattered -but I can't.\" Dakin blinked. He frowned. His mouth had suddenly turned down into a sneer. \"What are you on about?\" He spread his arms again. \"What the fuck is wrong with you?\" \"Nothing is wrong with me!\" Scripps protested, his voice beginning to raise again. \"Look, Dakin-what just happened should not have happened! You have no idea what kind of a position you've put me in here! You've just hurt…..me.\" he corrected himself quickly, feeling his cheeks burn. \" Hurt you?\" Another laugh bubbled out of Dakin. \"Are you that fucking frigid?\" Scripps felt anger brimming inside his chest. He looked Dakin straight in the eyes, those dark, beautiful, crazy eyes….he had to know. \"Look, Dakin….I never told you….but I'm actually….I'm in a….relationship.\" A second. And then- \" Bullshit !\" Dakin shouted. \"That's just absolutely fucking bullshit! Who the hell are you in a relationship with?\" He stared at Scripps in disbelief. \"Look, you're a loony. A raving fucking lunatic. It's not wanking that's done it to you. You need a release. And God knows I need a release. And I'm offering you a business arrangement in which we can be that for each other. It's got nothing to do with love . Look, you find me attractive, obviously, so I don't see why you'd want to duck out? You don't have to lie.\" \"I'm not lying.\" Scripps forced himself to stand up straight. He gritted his teeth, making himself stare Dakin squarely in the eyes. \"I'm not lying, Dakin. I'm in a relationship. And, for the record, I am not, nor have I ever, ever been, interested in you.\" A long pause. The wind whooshed down the dark street, rustling an old newspaper on the ground beside them. Dakin stared straight back. He paused…then slowly his eyes began to widen. They seemed to almost pop out of his skull. At the same time, as his eyes grew larger…Dakin himself seemed to grow smaller. It was as if he was aging backwards, becoming younger and younger. He opened his mouth-then closed it again. His entire body seemed to have hunched over, shrinking inside itself. Scripps stood still, arms hanging awkwardly by his sides, as he waited for Dakin to respond. Dakin himself had not taken his eyes away from Scripps. But his hands had travelled upwards to hug his shoulders. Suddenly, Dakin looked nothing more than a child. \"You're really not?\" Scripps swallowed, feeling more awkward than ever. \"No, mate.\" \"….Right….\" Dakin's voice had become odd. Higher-pitched than usual, quiet and lost. He looked back up at Scripps. Taking a deep breath, he opened his mouth again- \"It's you and Posner, isn't it?\" There was a deafening silence. Scripps felt his heart drop in his chest. \"How did you know?\" Dakin took several more laboured breaths. \"I guessed ages ago.\" he said oddly. His eyes were suddenly fixed to the floor, staring blindly at the ground as if at a bright light. \"I've known for a while. Fuck !\" The curse burst out of him almost involuntarily. Scripps bit his lip-he had never seen Dakin like this before. It was as if he had reached an inevitable-a terrible event he had known was coming but hadn't wanted to believe. Dakin ran his hands through his famous hair, before hugging his shoulders again. \"Dakin-?\" Scripps took a step towards him. He couldn't fathom Dakin's reaction. \"Dakin, what's wrong?\" \"Fuck off, Scripps.\" Dakin snapped, still hunched over, staring at the floor, his voice strangely misty. \"Dakin!\" Scripps reached out a hand to touch his shoulder-before realising it had begun to shake. \"What's going on? What's wrong with you?\" His hand gently came to rest on the quaking shoulder. Dakin shoved it off hard, with far more venom than was necessary. \"What do you care?\" His voice, always so careless and brash-was suddenly no more than a plaintive moan. It almost broke Scripps to see the colossus of Dakin reduced to this wreck. \"Of course I care, Dakin, we're mates!\" He gently replaced his hand, slowly, as if dealing with an unpredictable dog…but this time, Dakin let him. It was as if he had no more fight left in him. Scripps could tell he was desperate for comfort. \"Dakin, please talk to me. Tell me what's wrong.\" A long moment passed by. Dakin still could not meet his eyes. He spent a long while trying to formulate a sentence, Scripps could see his mouth forming many words which faded from his lips before he could express them. Finally, he seemed to give up. He looked up at the dark grey sky rather than at Scripps as he spoke: \"So you like Posner. Not me.\" he said, voice ominously thick. \"And….Posner likes you now….Not me.\" Scripps bit his lip. \"Yes.\" he said quietly, still confused. \"But Dakin-\" \"Alright, I'm going home.\" Suddenly, Dakin had slipped out from under Scripps's hand and set off down the road at a terrific pace. \"Dakin!\" Scripps shouted, starting to make after him. \" Don't !\" Dakin called back, his voice a sad songbird with only one song left in him. As he glanced his head back-Scripps could have sworn, in that flash of Dakin's face, in that half a second…a tear was running down his cheek. \"Just don't ! Go back in! I'll see you at school.\" Scripps watched helplessly as Dakin, practically running now, disappeared into the night.[Chapter 28] Hello! Hope you're all well and happy. I'm sorry for the delay-I've been lucky enough to see lots of my friends these past few days. Thank you so much for reading and reviewing, much love to you all. More soon, please continue to do so! xxx \"Has anyone seen Scripps?\" Posner had eventually found Rudge and Lockwood, leaning against the bar in the foyer of the theatre. Both held plastic cups of beer. \"Not since in there.\" Rudge answered, jerking his head towards the auditorium. \"Lost him, have we?\" Lockwood grinned, taking a swig. \"Probably off chasing Dakin.\" Rudge laughed hard, the drink splashing in his cup. \"Do you two take turns or what?\" Lockwood smirked. Posner felt himself burn up, wishing the floor would swallow him up. \"A simple \"no\" would have done.\" he muttered, turning and leaving them. Where was Scripps? He glanced again at the spot he'd left him-but it was occupied by two old ladies. He looked all around the foyer for that sand-coloured head, those warm brown eyes. But he was nowhere to be seen. Posner couldn't understand it-he'd said he'd wait for him? He glanced at the main doors which lead to the street outside-Scripps didn't smoke. Nonetheless, Posner was desperate. Making his way slowly through the crowded foyer, Posner eventually reached the front doors. He pulled one open and stepped outside into the cold. The temperature had dropped considerably since they'd arrived at the theatre, and there was a definite wind now. Wishing he hadn't left his coat on his seat back in the auditorium, he looked around. No Scripps. Suddenly, he spotted a figure at the top of the road, walking briskly away from the theatre. He squinted-the figure was male, tall, broad-shouldered, with dark hair and- \"David?\" Posner whipped around-out of the shadows, Scripps had materialised. \"Scrippsy?\" \"There you are,\" Scripps approached him, sighing with relief. \"I'm so sorry I didn't wait by the-\" \"Why are you out here?\" Posner interrupted. He turned again to look at the dark-haired figure, still hurrying up the road. He squinted. \"Isn't that-\" \"Dakin's going home,\" Scripps said, coughing. \"We came out here so he could smoke, but…\" There was something odd about him. Posner blinked, turning back to Scripps and frowning. \"What's going on?\" Scripps suddenly became very interested in the pavement. \"Scripps?\" \"Er…\" There was a pause. \"Dakin-he's had a bad day. Wanted to head home.\" Posner was not satisfied. He didn't like the way Scripps was refusing to meet his eyes. \"What happened?\" he demanded. \"Like I said, he wanted to head home!\" Scripps said truthfully…. then he sighed. \"Look, don't take this the wrong way, okay?\" Suspicion and nerves began to creep into Posner. \"What?\" \"Alright...\" Scripps sighed, running a hand through his hair. \"Look, I'm as confused as you will be here. I swear-I didn't mean for it to happen but…look I owe you the truth. It would be worse if you didn't know. I'd feel too bad…David, I've no idea what's going on with him but…\" \"Spit it out.\" Posner couldn't bear it. \"Dakin knows.\" Posner breathed in hard, feeling an uncomfortable jolt in his stomach…then exhaled. \"Okay. That's nothing too awful…how did he find out?\" Scripps folded his arms. Then unfolded them. Then looked at the sky. Then at the floor. Then back at the sky. The half-moon glared down through the smog, the silvery light faint. \"Scripps? Is there something else?\" Scripps buried his face in his hands, sliding them down his cheeks, as he always did when he was stressed. \"Look,\" He walked right up to Posner, taking both of his hands. Finally, he managed to look straight into Posner's eyes. Despite the situation, Posner couldn't stop himself thinking how handsome they were, how warm their shade of brown, the way they looked at him with so much adoration…Scripps held his hands tightly, his fingers gently stroking Posner's own. \"Look, I swear I didn't mean for it to happen. But…Dakin's been….well…\" He sighed, tongue almost seeming to knot itself in his mouth. \" What is he?\" Posner couldn't stand it. He did not like the way Scripps was holding onto him, hands vices, as he if expected him to run. \"…Dakin just kissed me.\" The half-moon had disappeared behind a cloud. Posner felt as if his world had just collapsed around him. The heart in his chest had been replaced with a rock, a rock weighing a thousand tonnes. He stared at Scripps, whose eyes were as wide as Posner's own, as he struggled to process this unbelievable news-had he not known Scripps as practically incapable of lying, there was no way he could have believed it. He was hot. His mind was reeling. He was cold. There was a strange roaring in his ears as he imagined… Dakin …Dakin, whom he had revered for so long…kissing Scripps. His Scripps. His own Scripps… \"David?\" Scripps was squeezing his hands unbearably tightly. \"David, please say something?\" he begged. Slowly, Posner came around. \"He…kissed you?\" he said stupidly. \"I'm so sorry, David, I never meant for it to happen!\" Scripps was speaking low but far, far too fast. \"I still don't understand-\" \"But…\" Posner could feel tears starting to prickle behind his eyes. The only thing on his mind…he could not. Not now. He could not lose Scripps. He could not. Especially not toDakin. He couldn't lose him. \"He…he likes you?\" Scripps sighed desperately. \"I don't know! Probably not really. You know what he's like-\" \"But he wants you.\" Posner interrupted. \" Dakin wants you…\" He felt as if all of his insides had dissolved. \"I don't know! I suppose he-\" Scripps began to protest. Posner felt sick. \"Do…do you like him?\" he stammered. Scripps slapped both hands to his face, making a sound like a strangled dog, before gripping Posner's hands even tighter than before. \"Of course not, David! How could you think I could ever do that to you?\" \"But…but he's Dakin .\" \"So?\" \"He's…he's Dakin …\" Posner blinked hard, staring beseechingly at Scripps. \"He's Dakin .\" \"Oh Poz…\" Scripps folded Posner tightly in his arms. Posner struggled for a minute…then eventually let himself go limp. He leaned into Scripps' shoulder, breathing in his warm, clean smell. \"How could you think that I could ever-\" \"But… \" Posner pulled away from him again. \"When I was on the phone to my mum earlier…and I said I felt bad because I just called you my friend …and you said-you said-\" His voice had become too choked. Scripps took Posner's face in his hands, looking him directly in the eyes. \"…Okay…\" He took a deep breath. \"How could I ever think about Dakin when I have you? Oh David, that's how he found out about us-when I pulled away from him, I told him I was….with you.\" Scripps gently stroked his cheek. \"All I meant by what I said by the phone box earlier was that I didn't care what we called it. Not that it didn't exist. Oh darling, you should have said something if you felt like this!\" Posner bit his lip, shaking his head. \"What do I compare to Dakin?\" he whispered, holding back tears. Something deep within him was threatening to reveal itself. \"Compare?\" Scripps asked, frowning in confusion. \"There's no comparison, what do you-?\" \"What do you mean? That's ridiculous!\" Posner choked out, suddenly almost shouting. His words came from a deep place within him he almost never allowed to spill out. \"I'm-I'm nothing next to him! He's-he's-!\" \" What ? What are you talking about?\" Scripps pulled him close again, wrapping his arms around him, holding on so tightly Posner could hardly breathe. Or maybe that was his tears. \" You're being ridiculous! Please, if you do one thing for me ever, never, never think that you are nothing!\" He ran a hand through Posner's hair. \"Forget about Dakin. What we have is nothing to do with him! I'm so sorry that what happened happened-\" \"-not your fault-\" Posner whispered. \"David, listen to me. You are not nothing. You have never been nothing in your life! No one is nothing! Please, please never think that you are nothing, it breaks my heart.\" Scripps kissed his forehead. \"You don't know how… amazing you are. I could tell you every reason why-but you'd never listen. And we'd be here all night.\" He held him tighter. \"David, you are… everything . You mean everything to me, and I wish to God you could feel the same way about yourself…\" \"Scripps…\" Posner breathed, swallowing hard. \"I could never think about anyone else, David-and I really hope you might not either. Because I want to be yours-and only yours. And…it would be wonderful if you would be mine.\" Slowly, Posner began to feel warmth flood his body again. He clutched onto Scripps for dear life. \"I'm yours already.\" Scripps breathed out hard, holding him almost unbearably tightly. \"No more thinking like this about yourself, okay?\" Posner made a small, mewing sound. \"And as for Dakin…\" Behind the main doors into the theatre, a bell sounded. The interval was over. \"I need to talk to him. Is that okay with you?\" Scripps pressed. \"I won't if you don't want me to. It's your choice.\" Posner paused. He swallowed hard again, trying to find his voice. \"Talk to him.\" \"Thank you.\" Scripps kissed him, almost desperately. \"Oh Poz, I just want you to be happy. I can't bear that you're not.\" Posner let Scripps lead him back into the theatre, blinking hard. Scripps had his arm firmly around his shoulders, as if trying to hold him together. He looked at him, feeling as warm and safe as he ever had with him, knowing that Scripps had never meant to hurt him. Scrippsy would never hurt him, he felt sure of it. Once again, he could scarcely believe the strength Scripps felt towards him-it was the kind of thing he had felt sure never happened in real life-only ever in books or poems. It was almost terrifying-yet here he was, safe in Scripps' arms. He tried with all his might to push Dakin firmly out of his head. Dakin was gone for this night. There was only Scripps. As they took their seats, Posner thought about what Scripps had said. He had always assumed that the world felt the same way towards him as Posner felt towards himself. But here was Scripps, telling him that he mattered, that he was worthy and…and something , rather than nothing. For the first time in his life, he did not allow his own insecurities to contaminate Scripps' promises. When the lights went down, and Scripps gently folded his hand into Posner's in the dark, he felt more… human… than he ever had before. As soon as he had turned the corner, Dakin's frantic pace reduced down to a stroll. He could feel hotness and wetness, perspiration under his arms and on his forehead. Impatiently, he scrubbed his hairline with the back of his hand. As he looked around him, he felt the cold air biting the nape of his neck as it never had before. He shivered. Slowing right down to a standstill, Dakin looked up at the sky. The harsh light of the lamppost above his head assaulted his eyes, and he squinted to look past it. It was so smoggy that he could not see a single star. Only the light of a cold half-moon beamed down, a silver blade in the darkness. It was as if it was cut straight through him, slicing him into pieces, fractions which drifted aimlessly off on the wind.[Chapter 29] Hello! Thank you so much for reading and reviewing-it means a lot :) please continue to do so, I love to hear your thoughts :) stick with me a little longer, we're getting there...;) As usual, I own nothing. Much love, hope you're all doing wellxxx Scripps picked up the phone, clamping it between his ear and shoulder as he flipped through the address book. Beside him, Maisie was slamming her fist down on the piano keys, giggling at the horrific clashes she was making. \"If you want to learn, I'll teach you, noisy!\" he said out of the corner of his mouth as he finally located Dakin's home number. Maisie responded by grinning at him and bashing louder, still in her ballet leotard and tights. Smiling back distractedly, he punched in the number and waited. After many rings- \"Hello?\" Scripps bit his lip frustrated-it was a female voice. \"Hey!\" he said politely, through gritted teeth. \"Laura, is it?\" \"Yeah?\" Laura drawled. She sounded eerily like a female Dakin, the northern twang diluted by two years of university in the south. \"Is your brother around?\" he asked, as casually as he could, turning his back on Maisie as she thumped the keys. \"Probably…I don't know…Hang on.\" The sound of the chord thumping against the receiver as she held it away from her. \"Stuart! It's one of your stupid little geek friends!\" Scripps raised an eyebrow as he waited, leaning against the wall. He could hear distant crashes on the other end of the phone as the receiver passed from one Dakin sibling to the other. \"Hello?\" came the familiar voice of his classmate, a male Laura with the northern twang intact. Scripps felt a jolt of nerves in his stomach. \"Dakin? It's me.\" Silence. \"Dakin?\" \"What?\" the voice on the other side of the phone snapped. \"Just…just thought I'd give you a ring,\" Scripps said carefully, keeping his tone as light and ordinary as possible. \"To see how you were.\" he added. \"Why? I'm fine. Why wouldn't I be?\" Dakin spoke sharply, defensively. \"Dakin…\" Scripps clutched the receiver closer to his cheek, as if that would help his cause. \"Look, mate, I'm really worried about you. After what happened last night, I thought-\" \"What the fuck?\" Forced laugher bubbled from Dakin. \"Mate, I have no idea what you're talking about!\" Scripps blinked, taken aback. \"Come on, mate, don't play that game. I…\" He paused, letting a hand slide down his face. \"I was going to ask if you wanted to go for a drink this evening or something…and talk it over?\" Another silence. \"Dakin? Come on, answer me. We need to-\" \"We don't need to do anything!\" Dakin coughed out more laughter, adopting a mocking tone. \"Come on, Saint Scripps, don't be a wanker. Of course I'm fine, I'm halfway through Irwin's fucking Kristallnacht essay. Have you started it?\" \"Dakin…\" Scripps took a deep breath. \"Stop it.\" \"Stop what?\" Dakin asked, his voice so deliberately light and casual it made Scripps want to throw the phone against the wall. \"Stop avoiding the subject. We need to talk about what happened yesterday so we can both move on.\" A snort. \"I still have no idea what you're on about. If you haven't started the essay I'm off. See you.\" \"No-!\" But the dialling tone had already sounded. Scripps let out an exasperated sigh, slamming the receiver into his forehead. He could feel his skin burning with frustration and embarrassment. Having half-expected this to happen, it wasn't so much anger as worry. He hadn't stopped worrying about Dakin since the kiss…oh fuck, that kiss …Scripps absent-mindedly rubbed his lips with the back of his hand. He hated that it had happened, probably more than Dakin clearly did, no matter how much he tried to pretend otherwise. David had been wonderful about it, but it had broken Scripps' heart to hear him call himself \"nothing\". To hear the person you loved tear themselves down…Scripps could not bear it. It had just made him more determined than ever to care for him and love him as much as the laws of physics allowed until David learned to love himself… \"What was that?\" Maisie asked vaguely, still hammering the piano with her small fist. Scripps started-he'd almost forgotten she was there. Quickly, he picked himself up. \"Oh nothing. Shouldn't be eavesdropping, cheeky!\" Scripps said cheerily, leaning over her shoulder. Gently, he laid a well-practised hand on the keys, thumb on \"C\", middle finger on \"E\" and little finger on \"G\". He played the chord with a flourish, while Maisie watched. \"That's a \"C\" chord, that is.\" \"Show me, show me!\" Maisie put her starfish hand over Scripps', stretching to reach. Scripps gently adjusted her, then slipped his hand out from underneath hers, leaving her to bash the keys, noisy \"C\" chords blasting out of the old instrument as Maisie laughed delightedly. \"C!\" she shouted, giggling. \"Well, if you're going to be loud, you might as well be tuneful!\" Scripps squeezed her shoulder. He looked down at her auburn head, still pulled back tightly into her ballet bun. He patted the top of her head, wishing, as he often did, that Maisie didn't have to ever grow up. \"You look tired, dear.\" Mrs Posner leaned over the lunch table to pass her youngest son a bowl of chicken soup. \"Look at your eyes! All pale and purple…\" \"Mum, I'm fine.\" Posner quickly busied himself with a deep drink of Ribena. \"No more nights on the town, hey?\" Posner's father grinned at him. Posner forced himself to smile back, determined to conceal the truth behind his sleepless night. A while ago, Dakin often occupied his thoughts for hours before he could finally fall asleep-but only last night had it filled him with horror. He dived into his soup as if he was starving, trying to avoid talking. \"Well, I for one can't wait until next Saturday!\" his mother was saying, pouring wine. \"When Aaron and Esther are coming home.\" \"Yes!\" his father replied enthusiastically. \"It will be nice to have all the kids here.\" \"And their kids!\" Mrs Posner beamed proudly. \"Emily phoned last night-little Oliver is growing at a rate of knots! He's already outgrown the little outfit we got him for his birthday! Do you remember? With the ducks on the pockets.\" \"Little champ.\" Mr Posner grinned. \"He'll outgrow the lot of us, won't he, son?\" \"Mmmm.\" Posner agreed vaguely, half-listening to the chatter about Aaron's promotion, his wife Emily's charity work, their son Oliver's precociousness. Posner had not seen much of his nephew since he was born, as Aaron and Emily had moved to Gloucestershire to be closer to Emily's parents. It would be good to see the little fellow-Scripps would love to hear all about him, being so fond of children. Posner nodded at appropriate intervals as the conversation moved to Esther and her new husband Dan, the GP. Posner did not like Dan-he was smarmy and patronising-but it was Esther who had to live with him. They'd moved south as well-only to Birmingham this time, but nonetheless south. Posner wondered, as his mother reached over to pinch his cheek, whether his parents would ever take the hint. \"It won't be long before Esther will have a family of her own! It will be wonderful to have the house full of kids again…\" Mrs Posner smiled sadly as him as she patted him. \"My baby boy is almost grown up too! It won't be long before you'll have your own children…\" Her eyes had become dangerously misty. Posner hid a burst of laughter with a coughing fit. \"Yes, isn't it time we set you up with a nice Jewish girl?\" his father asked, face deadpan-before laughing to himself, shaking his head. \"Kidding. Don't worry, son, you'll have no time for women at Cambridge! One less thing to worry about, hey?\" \"Mmm.\" Posner agreed, concentrating on the soup. \"If he goes.\" Mrs Posner said, taking a sip of wine. \"Well, if he gets in, of course he's going to go!\" Mr Posner looked at his wife as if she'd gone mad, giving Posner a sideways smirk. \"And you've every intention of getting in, haven't you?\" \"Mmmmm.\" Posner agreed, chewing a lump of meat that hadn't boiled down properly. \"But not yet!\" Mrs Posner took a larger gulp of wine. \"Mmmmmmm.\" Posner agreed, thinking about Dakin again, the way he'd practically ran up the street away from the theatre last night…it made his stomach churn every time he thought about it. He bit his lip, before taking another spoonful of soup. There was more salt in it than usual…every time he imagined Dakin kissing Scripps, he felt physically sick…he felt violated…if Dakin had already guessed they were together, then he knew Scripps was not free to kiss…it felt as if Dakin was deliberately trying to hurt him… \"…don't you think so David?\" \"Mmmmm.\" \"He did it to hurt me.\" \"Oh David, you can't think like that.\" \"I know he did.\" Posner muttered, one hand covering his mouth. He was very aware of his parents in the living room down the hall as he held the phone as close as he could to his face. \"I just told you-he's acting like he's forgotten about the whole thing!\" Scripps protested, his voice normal on the other end of the line. \"Maybe we should too. Move on.\" \"I can't,\" Posner whispered. \"I keep…thinking about it.\" \"Oh…\" Scripps sighed. \"You can't carry on like this. I told you, it meant nothing to me. It was nothing like…nothing like how we kiss. It's not going to happen again.\" \"It's not about you.\" Posner clutched the receiver so tightly he felt it almost cutting into his skin. \"It's him. \" \"We can't obsess over it,\" Scripps said, his voice level. \"We have to move on. What is it going to take for you to do that? Whatever you need, I'll make it happen, okay?\" Posner thought for a moment. \"I…I need him to…oh I don't know!\" \"Look, we'll see him in the flesh on Monday. See how you feel then, okay? Just relax now. I can't bear to think of you so wound up.\" Posner couldn't help but half-smile. \"I'm always wound up.\" \"I know.\" Scripps said warmly. \" Let be .\" \" Hamlet .\" Posner giggled. \"Easy.\" \"Of course.\" Scripps gave a yawn. \"I'm so bored. Can't you come over here? I miss you.\" \"We literally said goodbye like sixteen hours ago!\" \"That's way too long. Practically a lifetime. Can't you come?\" Scripps giggled. \" Be with me always - take any form - drive me mad! only do not leave me in this abyss, where I cannot find you!\" \"Scripps!\" Posner clapped a hand to his mouth to muffle his laughter. \"Stop quoting!\" \" Oh God it is unutterable! I cannot live without my life !\" Scripps persisted, still spluttering with mirth. \" I cannot live without my soul !\" he finished melodramatically. \"For goodness sake!\" Posner hissed. \"Stop it! My parents will hear me! And you have no taste!\" \"What's wrong with Wuthering Heights ?\" Scripps acted wounded. \"You're such a romantic, I thought you'd love it!\" \"Shhh!\" Posner begged. \"I'm going to start laughing and then my parents will kill me.\" \"Why?\" \"They don't like using the phone on the Sabbath.\" \"Oh! I'm sorry!\" Scripps suddenly sounded mortified. \"No! No, I was the one who phoned you, remember?\" Posner murmured. \"I just really wanted to talk to you.\" \"Still, we should hang up. I don't want to be in your parents' bad books.\" \"Believe me, they'd be far less pissed about me using the phone today than they will be when they find out that one, I'm with someone, and two, he's both male and a Christian.\" Scripps laughed apologetically. \"Sorry. I should have been born a Jewish girl.\" \"No, I like you just as you are.\" Posner whispered. \"As I do you.\" Scripps said sincerely. \"Look, if you can't get away today, meet me after church tomorrow. I don't think I can last until Monday without holding you again.\" Posner felt his cheeks flush. \"Oh…thanks?\" \" Thanks !\" Scripps burst out laughing again. \"You said you wanted romance, then you pooh-pooh Wuthering bloody Heights and all you can muster after my purest display of passion is \" thanks \"! Lordy, I should be offended!\" Posner giggled, pressing his hand over his mouth. \"Like I said. Just as you are.\" He shot a quick glance to the living room door, making sure it was still closed. \"I wish you were here.\" \"And I you. I really do…\" he whispered back. Posner knew Scripps would be clutching the phone just as tightly as he was…He checked the living room door was firmly shut once again, then looked all around. Nervously, he tried: \"You know, this is generally how phone sex starts…\" \" David !\" Scripps spluttered. \"Cheeky! Right, it is definitely time for me to hang up.\" \"No!\" Posner protested, desperate to keep him. \"Don't do that!\" \"I don't want to. I need to.\" Scripps tried to sound serious, but Posner could tell he was smiling. He felt a slight twinge of excitement inside him, wondering if he dared… \"Don't go,\" he purred. \"I'd be dreadfully upset…you don't want to do that to me, do you?\" There was a great deal of coughing from the other end of the line. Posner waited anxiously. When Scripps finally spoke-his voice was strangely distant. \"Keep talking like that and you'll make me do something I really don't want to do…\" he murmured, voice hardly more than a groan. \"Yes, darling?\" Posner breathed, hardly able to catch his breath… \"Bye, David.\" \"No!\" \"I'm going now! Look, I'll see you tomorrow. You take care of yourself, okay? I lo…I can't wait.\" \" Goodbye-e, goodbye-e, wipe a tear baby dear from your eye-e .\" Posner sang as quietly as he could. \"Beautiful.\" Scripps grinned. \"See you.\" \"See you.\"[Chapter 30] Hello! Hope you're all well. A thousand apologies for the delay-I have been stupidly busy and travelling up and down the country. Hope you enjoy this, more soon! Thank you so much for reading and reviewing, it means the world. Please keep doing so! Much love xxx I love you. Just fucking say it to him. Don't be a pussy. I love you. Scripps drummed his pen anxiously on the desktop. Before him, he could see the back of David's head, bent as he took notes. The nape of his neck was beautifully white and smooth, so slender his school shirt collar hung loosely around it even buttoned to the top and secured with a tie. Vaguely aware of Irwin writing something on the blackboard, Scripps stretched out, leaning back. He couldn't concentrate whatsoever, and not just because it was a Monday. All he could think about was the previous day, that glorious Sunday. There had been a mutual unspoken agreement that neither would mention Dakin. By virtue of this, for seven glorious hours, Scripps had enjoyed uninterrupted bliss in the company of David and David alone. When church had finished at eleven, Scripps had left his mother to take the girls home, for miraculously she had the day off. After waiting inside until she was gone, waving the girls off, he'd sat back down in the pews for one final private prayer. Silently, he praised and thanked God with all his heart, genuine, humble and innocent as a child. He knew God knew why. Then, he turned on his heel to help the vicar collect and stack the hymn books before heading next door to set up chairs and plates of biscuits in an adjoining church room for the old ladies' book club that most of the elderly church-goers attended after Sunday service. He did all of this with a huge smile on his face, feeling the same glow inside when the Reverend thanked him warmly and when the old ladies clucked and commented, as they did every week, what a good boy he was and wasn't he strong to carry all those chairs? Though he grinned at them, he needed no thanks. He loved to do it-and he knew the biggest reward in the world would be outside waiting for him. Sure enough, when he left the building, munching a chocolate chip cookie, there he was. Leaning against the fence surrounding the church, the sunlight illuminating his face and hair, beaming at him, was David. \"Hey there!\" he had called with a cheeky wink. \"Schmoozing the old ladies? Hoping they'll write you into their will?\" \"Oh, shush.\" Scripps had scoffed, shoving the other half of the biscuit into David's mouth. And the day was perfect. They'd gone to the park and studied in the sunshine, their bench covered in books and paper. The work was mostly in silence, but it was wonderful to look up and every time see David smiling back at him. When their concentration had begun to waver, they'd gone for a walk through the trees, packed together on the edge of the green so the sunlight made dappled shapes through the leaves. Finding a particularly large sycamore, they had sat down behind it, the huge trunk obscuring them from view. David had sat between Scripps' legs, leaning against him as Scripps leaned against the tree, a textbook resting on David's knees which was eventually ignored in favour of one another. It lay forgotten on the roots of the tree while they talked, simply happy to be together and to spend time just relaxing in the shade. Scripps adored holding him this close, feeling totally at ease, tracing with his fingers the lines and patterns of veins on David's pale little hands. Loving him was so simple when they were alone, so deliciously uncomplicated-Scripps simply let the current take him, smiling and laughing and just being with him. The love he felt simply was-it was as much a part of him as the breath in his lungs. It had been a shock when David's watch showed that it was already twenty to six in the evening. Despite his protesting, Scripps had insisted on walking him home, making the most of that last, precious twenty minutes before David disappeared behind his front door in time for tea. Feeling simultaneously empty and full, Scripps had trudged home in a daze, wishing with all his heart that he could turn back time and have their day to enjoy all over again. He'd lain awake most of last night, unable to get David out of his head, thinking about how he loved him, how much he wanted to tell him so that he could keep telling him every single day…but there was doubt. Perhaps it would ruin everything. Perhaps he'd scare David off. Perhaps…but a tiny part of him, a portion of his heart which glowed so warmly…told him that perhaps…perhaps David loved him too. Suddenly, a note landed on his desk: Dear Scrippsy, Thank you for yesterday. It meant the world. Your Poz xxx Scripps smiled, every cell of his being warming as if they had been laid down in direct, glorious sunlight. He looked up to see David's face turned back to face him, his perfect blue eyes, shining as they looked back at him. Quickly, he scribbled back: Don't be silly. It was a gift to have spent it with you. We must do it again. Your Scrippsy xxx God, I wish I could turn right around now and kiss you. Your Poz xxx Scripps sighed, gazing at the back of David's head. His mouth twitched into a half smile. The desk might get in the way. Your Scrippsy xxx I'll throw it. Your Poz xxx I'd love to see you try. Your Scrippsy xxx You underestimate me. Anyway, have you spoken to D? Your Poz xxx Scripps bit his lip. He quickly glanced at Dakin, bent over the desk beside him, his dark hair, his broad shoulders, his cocky slouch…hang on. Scripps frowned. There was something wrong. Instead of a perfect mop of thick, ebony hair immaculately gelled and shining…the hair was dull, matte, lax and sticking up strangely. The broad shoulders, usually so relaxed and irritatingly masculine, were rounded and hunched over, making the boy look half his size. Dakin did not slouch-he was almost curled up, so small, as if he was trying to hide under his desk. It was almost like sitting next to a different Dakin, as if he'd been replaced with a poorly designed clone. Hang on. Your Scrippsy xxx Scripps took a deep breath, then grabbed a fresh scrap of paper. He hesitated, before putting his pen to it and beginning to write. Dear Dakin. You okay? Really worried about you. Scripps Before he could think about it too much, Scripps quickly folded the note and placed it subtly on Dakin's desk. He waited, half listening to Irwin, deliberately not looking at Dakin. Instead, he directed his eyes at David, his hair neat and soft, shoulders relaxed, posture a little straighter than it used to be. He allowed him to fill him with courage, remembering that his love for him was the reason for this. All at once it had become his reason for everything. Dakin took his time. But finally, the scrap landed back on Scripps's desk. Gritting his teeth, he unfolded it. There, in Dakin's own handwriting, strangely similar to Irwin's on the blackboard: Don't talk to me. Scripps sighed exasperatedly, covering his face with his hands and letting them slide down. \"Right! I took the liberty to mark your essays in my lunch hour,\" Irwin said, suddenly raising his voice in a much more commanding manner. \"You mustn't expect this quick turn-around at Oxbridge but there isn't much time. Alright then, here we are.\" He picked up the stack of new essays, now covered in red pen, and began to hand them out, throwing them carelessly on each desk. \"Better, Akthar…up to a point compelling, Lockwood…not your best, Crowther, but I could see where you were going with it…began well but dissolved into rambling, Timms…we're almost there, Rudge, though I think the Carry On comparison rather ran away with you….\" Finally, he turned to the back few desks. \"Posner, your courage as a Jew to write this way about Kristallnacht is something that will place you at a great advantage in an entrance exam. Keep it up. Now, Scripps…\" Irwin shuffled the essays. \"Your language became a little flowery. Mildly nauseating.\" There was a ripple of laughter through the class. Scripps grinned, shaking his head in embarrassment, but he felt good-humoured. Finally, Irwin came to Dakin. He looked down at Dakin's essay, before placing it gently down on his desk. Lowering his voice almost to a whisper, he murmured, quiet enough for the rest of the class not to hear: \"Ah Dakin, what happened?\" While the others poured over their essays, Scripps watched Dakin out of the corner of his eye. Picking up the essay, he glanced at the comments-then immediately put it back down, facing the desk so no one else could see what Irwin had written on it. He leaned back, folding his arms and staring up at the ceiling. Though his handsome face was expressionless, Scripps could tell his friend was very upset. Scripps felt a great pang. It killed him to see Dakin reduced to this. He turned to Dakin, opening his mouth-but quickly closed it again. \"Look, I think this is the first compliment Irwin has ever given me!\" David turned around to show Scripps his essay, which wasn't quite as littered with red pen as Scripps's was. \"Though my ancestors would turn in their graves if they read this.\" \"Nice!\" Scripps smiled proudly, subtly squeezing his hand under the desk. He showed his essay, snorting with embarrassment. \"Look, he crossed out a whole paragraph of mine!\" As David read Irwin's comments, Scripps glanced back to Dakin. To his surprise, Dakin was looking right back at him. There was a searing coldness in those devastating brown eyes. Scripps quickly looked away, eager not to bother him, though he felt terribly guilty. It was very wrong to desert Dakin now, even if he thought he didn't want help. Scripps was determined to help him all the same. Especially since, behind the icy stare, there was the most distressing hint of sadness. Scripps swallowed hard. He leaned thoughtfully on an elbow, racking his brains.[Chapter 31] Hey everyone! Hope you're all well and happy. I hope you enjoy this chapter, more soon! Thank you so much for reading and reviewing, it's really wonderful of you! Please continue to do so, I love to hear your thoughts. Much love xxx Irwin sat perfectly still, staring straight ahead at the empty desks in front of him. He still felt completely out of place facing a classroom at this angle. It was as if he should be taking notes from a competent teacher, telling him exactly what to do. It seemed like a cruel joke that suddenly he was expected to guide the boys when he could barely guide himself. The poor bastards in what he referred to in his head as the \"Oxbridge\" lot were only about five years younger than him, he'd calculated. They'd have been at school together. If Irwin had grown up in Sheffield, he'd have been in the top year, sixth form, whatever they called it now, while the boys were thirteen-year-olds here. Irwin had been a prefect. He imagined himself in Scripps' shoes, on playground duty, wondering what it would be like to be in charge of the boys at such a young age. It was easy to picture it-perhaps some would be charging around with a football, swapping cigarette cards as the younger boys did. Smart boys like them would definitely have given him some cheek. Especially Dakin. Irwin frowned. For some reason, it was impossible to shrink Dakin into a youngster. His features were so sharp and defined, so adult before his time, and yet so boyishly handsome… It seemed so wrong that now he was supposed to be their teacher. Perhaps the most important teacher they'd ever have. The one who was supposed to nudge them into Oxbridge . Trying to shake Dakin out of his head, he thought desperately about the other boys instead. As much as he'd never thought he'd end up teaching, especially this young, it had been truly rewarding to read Rudge's essay, seeing how their wildcard boy had improved. Perhaps this is why people taught…but Dakin's essay…Dakin's had frustrated the hell out of him… Posner's was better though. Much better. His money was certainly on him to get one of those converted Cambridge places. That's if he didn't get distracted by boys…Irwin clapped a hand to his forehead as he recalled their last meetings, and how strangely Hector had behaved when they'd talked about Posner and Scripps…there was certainly no trouble imagining Posner as a youngster. It was easy to see why his feeling for Dakin were not, as far as Irwin knew, reciprocated. It would feel like kissing someone so much younger… Making a small grunt of exasperation, Irwin kicked the bin under his desk. Not as much younger than Irwin as the one who had run through his mind all of last night, keeping him awake until the small hours…he kicked again, burying his face in his hands. Thinking like this would get him fired…or worse… \"Who the fuck is Elizabeth Barton?\" \"Something about Kent?\" \"Wasn't it York?\" \"Definitely York.\" \"Don't be a wanker, it's Kent!\" \"Who cares?\" \"It doesn't matter. Just bung the name in the essay.\" Timms stretched, his back audibly clicking. All eight boys had found themselves sat around a big table in the library, festooned with books, paper and pens. It was their mutual afternoon free period, and it was proving to be one of the more stressful of their lives. Necks ached, eyes stung and mouths yawned as they concentrated, pages flipping and pens scratching. And tension was rather high. \"Kent.\" Posner raised his head, rubbing the back of his neck. \"The Holy Maid of Kent.\" \"Nah, it was York.\" Lockwood folded over the corner of a page in his textbook for reference. \"Holy Virgin of York.\" \"Just fucking look it up!\" Timms flapped his hands in exasperation. Scripps was already scanning through a thick library volume. Finally, he jammed his finger down on a name. \"Elizabeth Barton, Holy Maid of Kent.\" He flashed Posner a quick smile, which was shyly returned. \"Are we all satisfied now?\" \"Yep. Didn't think it was York.\" Akthar made a note of it. \"But we still don't know what the old bitch did to deserve a place in our essays?\" Crowther frowned. \"Scripps, does it say who she was in there?\" \"Er…\" Scripps had already closed the book. Quickly, he began to flick through again. \"Erm…\" \"Elizabeth Barton, Holy Maid of Kent.\" Suddenly, Dakin had looked up from behind a large pile of battered books. His voice was low and short. \"Nun. Made a prophecy against Henry VIII's marriage to Anne Boleyn. Also called the Mad Maid. Executed for it. The prophecy, not being mad. There you go.\" he snapped. Immediately, he disappeared again, head bent low. There was a short silence. \"Well then.\" Akthar added to his notes. \"Wish I'd known her.\" Timms grinned. \"Everyone knows crazy girls are the best in bed.\" \"She was a nun!\" Lockwood shook his head, slapping a hand to his forehead. \"Come on, they were up to all sorts!\" Timms protested, laughing. \"Especially pre-Reformation. Old Liz Barton might have been the local bike. Out of her habit for a bag of chips. She was probably noshing off the local Abbot and everything.\" \"Yeah, because Cambridge would love to read about that in your entrance exam.\" Akthar underlined something, turning over a new page. \"Actually, I reckon Irwin would encourage it.\" Lockwood pointed out. \"A fresh view, or whatever. Originality. The Secret Diaries of a Slutty Nun.\" \"Corruption in the Catholic church?\" Crowther rolled his eyes. \" Really original.\" \"Watch out!\" Timms nodded at Scripps. \"Jesus over there will get really pissed you're bashing his Dad's head office.\" \"Lucky I'm not a Catholic then,\" Scripps yawned, stretching his arms. \"Oh come on, you're all on the same train, who cares who the driver is?\" Timms scoffed. \"Yep, we're all just general Bible-bashers really.\" Scripps shrugged. \"Hell-bent, ironically enough, on bothering God every minute of every day.\" Posner gave a small giggle. Behind Dakin's books, there was a quiet \"Pah.\" sound. \" Christian indeed. Because all Christians love to suck off Jewish boys.\" he murmured. Scripps turned to him, so quickly his neck jolted. \"Something wrong, Dakin?\" he asked, his tone suddenly much more serious. He watched carefully as Dakin emerged, eyes snake-like, from behind the stack. He eyed Scripps. \"Nothing at all, Scripps.\" he hissed, voice icy polite. \"Why, is something bothering you ?\" He raised his thick eyebrows, almost challengingly. Scripps swallowed hard. \"Nope.\" He met Dakin's eyes, forcing himself to smile. \"Nothing at all.\" Scripps rushed through the Pathetique sonata, banging the keys far harder than was necessary. Ignoring the dynamics, every phrase had become fortissimo as he finished as quickly as he could. The piece had never been played this violently, Scripps was sure, as he gritted his teeth. Barely able to concentrate on the notes, sure he was going wrong, but not caring, he stared up at the cross, nailed to the wall above the piano. It was so shiny, the evening sun reflecting on it through the window. Finally, Scripps smashed out the final bars. He slammed the lid down, breathing hard. He couldn't stop thinking about Dakin's comment. It had been hell to hold in his anger, to keep his face straight. Would this be forever now? For the rest of the year with Dakin? Carefully, he breathed out as slowly as he could. \"No, I won't be angry.\" Scripps said out loud, still staring up at the cross. \"I'm not angry…except…look, I am. I need…I need to…I don't know what I need to do.\" He sighed heavily. \"I want to help him…but…\" Clasping his hands together, he rubbed them, before burying his face in his hands and letting them slide down… Get rid of all bitterness, rage and anger, brawling and slander, along with every form of malice. Be kind and compassionate to one another, forgiving each other, just as in Christ, God forgave you. Scripps looked back up at the cross. Dakin lay back, both hands behind his head. He stared up at the ceiling, feeling a chill on his bare chest. Fiona's pillows were always depressingly flat and hard, the silk squares she put on them so her hair didn't frizz at night cold and slippery. Fiona wiped her mouth, lying down next to him, careful not to let her skirt slide any further up her long, slender legs. \"Come on, gorgeous, give us a kiss.\" Automatically, Dakin wrapped his arms around her, still staring at the ceiling. He kissed her hungrily, sticking his tongue down her throat and biting down hard on her lips. Ignoring her small squeak of pain, he kissed harder, faster, frantically. Shutting his eyes tightly, he pawed at her breasts, clenching his jaw so hard it hurt. Grunting, his fingers found her waistband, scratching at the bottom of her shirt, trying to slide underneath. He opened his eyes and stared desperately down at her. Fiona was so beautiful. Her eyes were large, her lips full, her hair shining. Her hips were slender, yet curved, her breasts so firm and soft…and yet he felt nothing. Nothing. Nothing… Groaning, he dived in for another kiss. Irwin pushed aside the empty pizza box, so it landed directly on top of last night's. He ran a hand through his hair, staring at the blank wall of his tiny flat. He could her the tenant downstairs moving around, the one above watching TV. There was nothing but silence in his rooms. He looked to his left, the small bookshelf half-full of battered volumes he didn't read any more. He looked to his right. His single bed, unmade. On the counter by the stained cooker, there was a stack of dirty plates and mugs. This was not how he imagined his twenties. A tiny, dirty flat. A job he loathed half the time. And…an empty bed. An empty, single fucking bed. No. No. Irwin slapped his hands to his head, then again, and again, harder and faster and faster until his mind was swimming. He refused. He absolutely refused. This would not be another night like the last… He stood up, marching over to the sink. Far too violently, he threw several stained pans into the stagnant water, not caring when it splashed him. He turned back to the counter and threw the dirty plates in on top, finding the \"CLANG!\" as they smashed together oddly satisfying. Next, he grabbed the mugs, chucking them into the sink, relishing every smash and clang. He almost felt the vibration through his whole body as he sank down beside it to sit on the grubby floor, still in his stiff suit, far too big for him. He knew he looked pathetic. This was pathetic. He was pathetic. Dakin…Dakin's handsome face swam into his mind, that arrogant, boyish smile, those intense dark eyes…that glorious body Irwin had imagined so many times, hidden beneath his school uniform…the glimpses he caught of shoulder, back, arms, through the thin material of his school shirt… Giving a small cry, Irwin slapped both hands to his face again, so hard it stung. He didn't care. He couldn't care. There was a knot in his stomach, coiling tighter and tighter, pain filling every fibre of his being….Groaning, he kicked the kitchen counter. The pans in the sink rattled loudly, almost spilling out onto the floor.[Chapter 32] Hey everyone! Sorry for the delay-been very busy! Enjoy some fluff this time. Thank you so much for reading and reviewing-it means the world. I love reading your reviews-it makes my day every single time :) See you soon! Much love xxx \"Come to my house on Saturday?\" Posner suddenly blurted out, surprising even himself. He looked up at Scripps, who sat beside him on the grass outside the library at school. It was a warm Tuesday afternoon, so they lent together on the bricks to read. Behind them, the sound of a class of youngsters spending their post-lunch lesson inside. Before them across the small lawn, the windowless wall of another classroom. It was almost perfectly private. Scripps looked back at him, startled. \"Do what, now?\" he spluttered. \"Come to my house for the Sabbath.\" Posner pressed, turning to him. \"I want you to meet my parents.\" Scripps's gorgeous brown eyes grew even wider. \"David?\" \"I do!\" Posner took Scripps's larger hand in both of his smaller ones. \"My brother, his wife and their son, and my sister and her new husband, will be coming up. So I want you there.\" He gave a shy smile. \"As you're my…well, mine.\" Scripps coughed-but he smiled broadly. \"As much as I'd love to, I think I might ruin the Sabbath, to be honest, darling.\" He squeezed his hands. \"But I'm flattered that you want me to be there.\" \"Scrippsy, just don't mention you're Anglican and we're good to go.\" \"I think they might notice that I'm not a girl, though.\" Scripps pointed out, giving Posner a gentle flick. \"That might ruin the Sabbath far more than my Christianity.\" \"Look, I've been thinking,\" Posner leaned back on the wall, closing his book. \"Since your dad was so wonderful about us, I wondered whether telling my parents might be okay. I know they're old and stuff, but they've never outwardly said anything against homosexuals. They're quite…well…I can't see them kicking me out for it.\" \"I can't see your mum ever letting you leave home!\" Scripps grinned-but he looked serious again. \"Look, David, I'd love to be there with you, but I can't see this not ending in tears.\" Posner gently stroked Scripps's hand. \"How about I at least ask them? At least I could try?\" \"Oh David, I don't want you to get hurt.\" Scripps still wouldn't budge. \"What if they freak out? We might not be able to see each other at all any more. I don't think I could live with that. Besides, things are going great. More than great, David.\" He clutched Posner's hands tightly. \"I don't want to take any risks.\" \"I know…\" Posner sighed. \"…But will I ask them anyway?\" \" Poz -\" \"Darling, please let me try,\" Posner pressed, leaning into him. \"I really think they might be okay after all! Look, Mum and Dad are getting their grandchildren from Aaron-and Esther too, someday. It won't matter that they won't get them from me!\" Scripps frowned, still looking deeply troubled-but the ghost of a smile flashed across his handsome face. \"I definitely want kids.\" Posner's eyebrows raised in surprise. \"Oh!\" \"Yeah!\" Scripps leaned his head on Posner's shoulder. As he did so, Posner felt a warm glow course through his whole body. \"I'm like the broodiest eighteen-year-old guy ever. Absolutely want them. House full of kids, one day.\" Posner was quiet for a moment. He and Scripps had never really talked about life further than Cambridge. Swallowing hard, he looked down at Scripps, his thick, soft hair tickling Posner's jaw. It had just seemed a given that they'd be together through university, Posner wouldn't want it any other way. He hoped with all his might that they'd both get into Cambridge, so they could walk around those stately homes of colleges together, through those beautiful parks, that historic town. They could study together in that amazing library he'd seen in the photographs, spend evenings in the White Horse just like Thomas Cromwell, see one another through those horrible exams, then graduate together. Further south, they could take the train to London and go and see a play, or an opera, or a musical. Maybe even to Brighton, like Graham Greene, walk together on the beach, on the pier… It seemed like a world of possibilities had suddenly opened up, beckoning Posner into the brightest light he'd ever seen. But to think even further than that… \"You'd be a great dad.\" he murmured. Scripps laughed. \"Well, I've had a lot of practise with the girls!\" He snuggled into Posner, the warmth intensifying. \"I hope I'll be a good dad.\" Posner felt the glow inside him grow and grow, filling every cell… \"Look, Poz, you talk to your parents if that's what you want. I'll even be there when you do, if you want?\" Scripps looked up at him, straight in the eyes. \"I'd better talk to them on my own, I think.\" Posner reasoned. \"If it goes well…\" \"I know. I hope it does.\" Scripps said sincerely, wrapping an arm around him. \"Scripps…\" Posner took a deep breath. \"You're going to be in my life for a long, long time, I hope. We might as well make you an official part of the family. You're already part of mine…\" Scripps coughed, yanking his arm away and pretending to cower away from him. \"What is this, Tis Pity She's A Whore ? Is incest your secret kink?\" \"No!\" Posner giggled, realising what he'd said. \"I just meant-\" \"I know what you meant.\" Scripps laughed, gathering him in his arms again, holding him close. \"Oh Poz, you're so sweet…\" He stroked his hair adoringly. \"What did I do to deserve you?\" Posner leaned into him gratefully. He could never describe how he felt, when Scripps held him like this. He felt so warm, so happy, so safe…It was as if the world could collapse around them and they'd be shielded in each other's arms…Posner's heart had begun to race, beating so hard against his skin that he felt it might burst out. He could have sworn it had grown wings, golden wings. \"What did I do to deserve you ?\" he whispered. \"Don't be silly.\" Scripps smiled devotedly. He kissed the top of his head. \"You're my world, David, you know that? Of course…of course I will stay with you for as long as you want me there. Years, decades, centuries if I could…You alone know, love, or ought to know, how blessed and happy you make me, just because you are mine. And I am yours, David. I couldn't imagine anything more deliriously wonderful than that. To have you…and to be yours…\" Posner felt his entire body begin to melt. He held on as tightly as he could, feeling the wings of his heart flap crazily in his chest…he knew it was no longer his. There was…there was this force …pulling him towards Scripps…He had never felt anything like it before…It wasn't physical, it was…so much more than that. It was his whole self … Posner couldn't believe he'd ever thought he was in love with Dakin… This was…love. It cut him so deeply, rooting itself deep inside him, becoming as much a part of him as the racing heart in his cheat, the air in his lungs. He knew it had been under his skin all this time, waiting patiently to give itself entirely to Scripps, where it had always known it belonged…He looked up at Scripps. No more was he dazzled by his handsome face, his dark eyes, his ready smile…it was his…entirety. The Scrippsness of Scripps. His…his soul. Posner hated to use that word…but he could think of no other. It was the deepest, most intimate thing he had ever experienced. This was love. It had been growing inside him all this time. What could he do but let the force pulling them together take him? \"Oh…\" he gasped, holding onto Scripps as tightly as he could. \"Are you okay?\" Scripps's face was flushed with concern. \"David?\" \"Yes…yes of course I am…\" he said breathlessly, imagining Brighton. \"Of course I am…\"[Chapter 33] Hey! Sorry its been so long-I've been taking my exams but I'm back now :D Hope you're all well and happy. Thank you so much for reading and reviewing-please continue to do so! Nearly there now :) Much love xxxx \"…and then I would conclude here before I began to ramble, as you did. With an ambitious point like that you don't want to get bogged down with details-you're not trying to write a thesis, just showing an alternative viewpoint. Besides, regarding Hitler's exercise habits, it wouldn't be prudent to…Dakin?\" Irwin raised his head from the essay he was slashing at with a bright red pen. \"Are you listening?\" Those broad shoulders stiffened slightly as Dakin raised his head a fraction from whence it had slouched on his chest. \"Mmmm?\" he drawled. Despite the desk in between them, a wooden reminder of everything that separated them, Irwin could not help but notice how devastating his eyes were when they were so lazily half-shut… \"Dakin, I'm not going through your essay for my health,\" he pressed on determinedly. \"You've got to take this in. We have to be serious now, there is so little time left. A performance like this so close to your entrance exam…look, Dakin, I'm going to be frank with you. It looks like you did this essay in about fifteen minutes.\" He forced himself to look sternly at Dakin over his glasses. \"I expected far more effort from you. Look,\" He leaned forward a little. \"reading your last essay, I'd have had my money on you of everyone to get a place. It was original, it was concise, it was...But this.\" He tapped the red-splattered paper in front of the boy. \"This is really poor, Dakin. Frankly, if you produced something like this in your entrance exam, if I were a don I'd have put it down before the second paragraph and crossed off your name. I mean it.\" Irwin stopped talking. Biting his lip, he wondered whether that was too harsh. But Dakin needed harsh. He needed to be pushed if he wanted to do himself justice. \"Dakin?\" Irwin prompted. \"Don't you think so?\" Dakin hadn't moved. He opened one eye a little wider. Irwin vaguely noticed the dark purple circles under them, broodingly handsome. But he ignored them, staring expectantly back at him. \"Dakin? Were you listening to any of that?\" Dakin simply shrugged. Anger boiled in Irwin's stomach. Looking down at the slouching boy, it infuriated him to think about the opportunity Dakin seemed quite relaxed about throwing away. For the first time in his short teaching career, he wanted to shout at a pupil of his. Swallowing hard and taking a deep breath, Irwin struggled to keep his voice level. \"Where's your head?\" he snapped. \"What do you think you're doing? Am I completely wasting my time?\" Another shrug. \"Dakin!\" Irwin's rage was beginning to bubble out of his mouth. \"What's wrong with you?\" Suddenly, both dark eyes snapped up to look directly into Irwin's. It took the young teacher completely by surprise as Dakin suddenly met his gaze. Again, he noted the dark circles beneath them. There was a dullness behind them Irwin had never seen before. There was no sparkle, none of Dakin's own brand of compelling arrogance. Now that Irwin was looking at him properly, it was clear that the boy hadn't slept. His skin looked pale, his lips strangely dry, eyelids heavy as Dakin struggled to keep them open. This wasn't laziness, this was exhaustion. \"I'm sorry, sir.\" Dakin finally murmured, his voice a shadow of its former self. Irwin felt his fury dissolve as quickly as it had come upon him. Instead, he was filled with concern. \"What is wrong with you?\" he asked, voice much gentler. \"You're not yourself at all.\" Dakin shrugged yet again. \"Nothing, sir. Just…just tired.\" Irwin looked searchingly at him. He noticed Dakin's hand lying on the desk in front of him. It was all he could do to stop himself reaching out and taking it… could he? In a comforting gesture… stupid, stupid, stupid . Of course not. What was he thinking ? He was going to lose his job… \"Look, Dakin.\" He coughed, trying to regain his professionalism. \"It's pretty clear you're useless here today. Why don't you go home and catch up on your sleep? I can have a word with Mrs Lintott so she'll excuse you from her lesson this afternoon?\" Dakin didn't need asking twice. Instantly, he had shot to his feet, grabbed his bag, and was halfway to the classroom door…before he shyly turned back on his heel. \"Thanks, sir. Really decent of you.\" \"That's okay. You look like you need a break…Dakin?\" Irwin swallowed hard. God , he hated this part of the job…but this was Dakin. Not Posner. This was Dakin. \"Is there anything you want to talk about?\" A pause. Dakin scuffed the tip of his shoe against the classroom floor, in a gesture so foreign to his usual persona Irwin had to look twice to make sure it was still the same boy. \"Nothing, sir.\" he muttered. \"Sure?\" Irwin pressed. \"It's just you kind of look like shit.\" Finally, Dakin cracked a smile. \"You're crap at swearing, sir.\" Irwin's heart warmed. \"Perhaps my vocabulary is just too advanced.\" Dakin chuckled softly, before stifling a yawn. \"I'm alright, sir.\" \"Well, that's a bloody lie.\" Irwin said shortly, making Dakin give another weak smile. \"Fancy telling me the truth? I am a human as well as a teacher.\" There was another long pause. Finally, Dakin shook his head. \"Nothing sir. Thank you.\" He made for the door again. \"Well, if you ever feel like being honest…\" Irwin smiled, gesturing the chair Irwin had just vacated. \"Maybe I will, sir…\" Dakin turned back. Irwin felt his heart give a small backflip as he caught a glimpse of Dakin's signature handsome grin. \"Maybe I'll come and see you again sometime…would you like that, sir?\" Irwin spluttered. \"Well, only if you feel you need to-\" Dakin's smile was beginning to return to its former, devastating glory. \"Playing hard to get, hey, sir?\" Irwin could have sworn he saw the ghost of a wink. Ignoring his suddenly racing heart, he forced himself to wave Dakin away impatiently. \"Get out of here, you cheeky sod, before we both say something we regret.\" Posner crouched over the battered piano in the side room at school he and Scripps liked to use. He was picking out the notes of a new song with one finger, wishing he had Scripps' piano skills. Scripps himself was away helping Mrs Dyer in that lower school English class. He felt his heart glowing as he remembered how much time he gave up to help others-Posner was so proud of him. It would certainly be worth mentioning tonight… Posner was planning to plant the seed of Scripps meeting his parents this weekend by bringing him up favourably at dinner that evening. The anticipated event, the boy he loved meeting his parents, filled him with an equal mixture of excitement and fear. The actual explaining that Scripps was a boy and that Posner loved him was one thing (he had decided to let Scripps's Christianity be a lovely surprise…maybe in five years time?)…but if they surpassed that hurdle…Posner knew his mother would adore Scripps, she already knew him as Posner's \"nice\" friend. He was everything she would want in her youngest son's partner; kind, gentle, honest, and protective and loving enough of him to rival even her. As for his father…Posner loved the idea that they would get on. His father would like Scripps's intelligence, his work ethic, the fact that he too was applying to Cambridge. Scripps was so affable among all his other qualities, Posner could not imagine that, if they gave him a chance, they would not love him. Posner grinned to himself as he hummed the new melody. It was wonderful to think, that for the first time in his life, the future could be bright… Scripps waved goodbye to Mrs Dyer with a cheery smile before slinging his bag over his shoulder and leaving her classroom-before allowing his face to fall into exasperation. As he walked away as quickly as he could, he prayed to God and Jesus and every angel in Heaven that he would never end up teaching. The boy he was mentoring was not only slow but so frustratingly unwilling . Scripps liked to help out, but frankly it baffled him how the boy had managed to pass his eleven plus to get in to this school. Scripps shook his head, before remembering to walk upright, the prefect badge glinting embarrassingly on his blazer. Turning towards the corridor where the room with the piano was, where he knew David was waiting for him, Scripps couldn't wait to stop being Donald Scripps, the model student, and just be Scrippsy . The corner of his mouth twitched at the cutesy nickname, but he didn't mind-it was funny, the way David naturally smiled as he said it… \"Ah, here comes young Scripps!\" A voice jerked Scripps from his thoughts, as he noticed a greying, bespectacled head peer out from around a classroom door. Mr Hector had pounced so seamlessly; it was as if he had been lying in wait. \"Morning, sir.\" Scripps made himself smile, ignoring the uncomfortable jerk in his stomach. \"A spring in his step, a smile on his lips, how satisfying to see one of us so contented!\" Hector declared, as if he was an actor on stage. There was a kind of wistful sadness in his voice, but his grin was of indulgent pleasure. \" Happiness in intelligent people is the rarest thing I know ! Perhaps you are not Oxbridge material after all!\" Scripps smiled politely. \"Perhaps not.\" he agreed. \"Bye, sir.\" \"Goodbye indeed. Pip pip.\" Hector waved a regal hand-before pausing. \"Oh, Scripps?\" \"Yes, sir?\" Scripps turned back. \"You must tell our dear Posner to bring you along to more of our little poetry discussions. It was most…stimulating-to have the both of you there.\" Hector's smile had become a little sicklier sweet, making Scripps' stomach churn. \"Er…alright. Bye sir!\" he called back, setting off again as quickly as he could. \"Good day, young Scripps. Fare you well, wherever this morning's path may take you...\" Scripps hurried away, clenching his jaw uncomfortably. He shook his head, as if trying to dislodge the memory of Hector's comment from his mind. He hoped Hector wouldn't always smile indulgently at him, as if he was living vicariously through him-the fantasy of loving a schoolboy made all the better when it was two schoolboys in love...It was so bloody creepy . Perhaps Scripps would have to pretend he and Posner now loathed one another and stay at opposite ends of the classroom at all times to throw the old man off the scent. Then again, that might encourage him more . Hector adored broken hearts, after all-all those poems- Suddenly, a mop of dark hair caught Scripps' eye. A figure had materialised at the end of the corridor. Coming towards him, heading away from Irwin's classroom, was Dakin. Something twisted inside him unpleasantly as he and Dakin locked eyes with one another. Scripps opened his mouth automatically to say hello-but no sound would come out. He waited anxiously, legs moving on autopilot, until the two boys were almost face to face. Scripps desperately searched for something to say- \"Hi, Scripps.\" a voice said wanly. Scripps blinked. He checked Dakin's lips again to make sure they had moved. But they had. Dakin had come to a standstill directly in front of him. And he was staring straight back. \"Er…\" Scripps licked his lips anxiously. \"Hi, Dakin.\" He looked up at him, noticing with guilt the dark circles under his eyes. \"How are you, mate?\" he managed to say. \"Well…\" Dakin raised a thick eyebrow. He took a deep breath-then let his shoulders fall. \"Shit, to be honest.\" he said frankly. \"Pretty shit.\" \"Ah, mate…\" Remose fluttered inside Scripps as he finally managed to meet Dakin's eyes. He was so glad Dakin was finally speaking to him that he himself was completely tongue-tied. He opened his mouth-then closed it again. Dakin nodded. \"Yeah. Pretty fucking shit.\" He looked away from Scripps to the ceiling. \"Old Irwin's sorted me a sick note. I'm just heading home. I don't suppose you want to come for a…\" He looked back at Scripps-then down again. \"No. Of course not. You're busy.\" Scripps bit his lip. \"Look, if you need to talk, I'd be happy to-\" \"No, you're clearly heading somewhere.\" Dakin seemed determined to talk himself out of opening up. \"Anyway, its not like you'd ever bunk off, Saint Scripps .\" He gave a weak smile. Scripps felt a glow-it was so nice to speak to Dakin almost like they used to. \"Yeah, you're right-I am too much of a goody-two-shoes for that.\" Scripps smiled guiltily. \"But if you want to talk-\" \"Nah-I'm alright.\" Dakin drew himself up to full height. \"Irwin's practically begging me to talk to him . He's desperate to hear all about my life. Have me open up to him, bare my soul, all that jazz.\" That signature half-smile was playing around his lips. \"Might take him up on it. Maybe he'll even buy me a drink.\" The old swagger was beginning to creep back into his voice, that signature half-smile playing cockily around his lips. It made Scripps want to hug him, to see flashes of the old Dakin they all knew and loved beginning to show once again. \"You complacent fuck.\" Scripps grinned back. \"Enjoy your nap this afternoon.\" \"Oh, I will. Have fun with Totty.\" Dakin started off down the corridor. \"See you, Saint Scripps.\" \"See you, Dakin.\" Scripps watched him depart, folding his arms and leaning against the wall. As Dakin turned the corner, Scripps hugged his own shoulders, his smile spreading wider across his face. He allowed himself a moment of silence. Then, he turned on his heel and began to hurry joyfully down the corridor to the piano room where David waited. ","Summary":" Hello. I hope you enjoy my latest attempt at fanfiction.
