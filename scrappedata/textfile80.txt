It was short…so, so short. The servants were arguing how to style it. It was too short to do much with it and the cut job her mother had given her made it look terrible. She felt like a piece of her was missing. She used to spend hours upon hours managing her hair…now it was gone…and she felt as though all of that hard work was wasted. The servants decided to simply pin some of it from her face while leaving a few curly wisps near her face. She hated it. Once they left, she continued to stare at herself in the mirror. She didn't know how long she was sitting there…but she felt something inside her crack. She raised a shaky hand and ran it down her hair. Where her hair would have continued to grow…it stopped. It was so sudden…like how her life suddenly stopped after her mother had banished her to the middle of a swamp. Her face contorted to a mixture of anger and pain. She stood and grabbed the hairbrush and threw it as hard as she could at the mirror with a scream. The mirror shattered and Rapunzel yanked the pins from her hair and she yanked on the short strands, as if pulling it would make it grow. She had tears running down her cheeks and sobs wracked her body. She hardly noticed when her Prince rushed in and grabbed her arms. \"Rapunzel, Rapunzel, stop, what is it? What's wrong my darling?\" he asked frantically. Worry was in his beautiful blue eyes and in his eyebrows. Rapunzel buried her face into his shoulder and sobbed. Her Prince gently stroked her hair and gently guided her to the bed. He sat her down and tried to calm her down. \"Rapunzel, my darling, what ails you?\" he asked. It absolutely killed him to see her in this way. He never wanted her to feel this way. She had already been through enough…they both had. Rapunzel shook her head as more tears ran down her cheeks. She didn't want to tell him. She didn't want him to think she was some conceited child who cared too much for her looks. \"Please tell me, my darling,\" he said. He gently sat her up and used his thumbs to wipe the tears from her cheeks. Rapunzel looked at him through blurry eyes and she tried to calm herself down. Then she ran her fingers through her hair again and was once again surprised when her hair stopped just below her chin. \"I…hate it,\" she whispered. \"You hate what my love? Your hair?\" he asked with concern. \"Is that what this is about?\" Rapunzel looked down and more tears ran down her cheeks. \"Rapunzel…my love, my darling,\" her Prince started. \"Do you not know how beautiful you are?\" Rapunzel looked up at him. He smiled softly at her and wiped her tears away again. \"You could have no hair on your head…and it wouldn't change how much I love you nor how beautiful you are. But of course, your beauty is not the only factor that made me fall for you. Your kindness and devotion and curiosity make you who you are…not your hair,\" he said. \"It was a part of me,\" she whispered and sniffled. \"I know…\" he said. He leaned forward and looked into her navy blue eyes. \"How can I make you feel better?\" Rapunzel looked into his blue eyes and realized that he was right…she wasn't her hair. Though she missed it terribly…it was a symbol of her captivity within the tower. She was free now…that burden was gone. She was his now…and he was hers. She wrapped her arms around him. \"Don't be like my hair. Don't be cut from me,\" she whispered. \"Never,\" he whispered back to her. He gently pressed his lips to hers and Rapunzel knew that everything would be alright. She never had to be afraid.

How dare she? How dare that spoiled selfish girl betray her? After everything she had done for her? The witch was fuming. Her anger and devastation taking over her. She stared at her daughter as Rapunzel sat on the bed and sobbed. She had that look in her eyes. The same look that people always gave her…fear, hatred, disgust. The look coming from her dear Rapunzel made the Witch's stomach twist. She scowled and turned away. \"Why? Why Rapunzel? Have I not given you everything? Is my love not enough for you?\" the Witch demanded. \"No!\" Rapunzel sobbed. \"You know that I love you, mother, but I'm no longer a child! Please, I wish to see the world.\" \"The world,\" the Witch spat. \"The world is dark and cruel and selfish and full of wolves and murderers and thieves.\" \"No! It's not! I know it's not! There may be dangers in the world but there is also goodness and kindness. The Prince—,\" she began then she cut herself off with a gasp when the Witch grabbed her by her hair. \"Do not mention that snake in my presence ever again you selfish, spoiled, child,\" the witch hissed and yanked on Rapunzel's hair. She yelped in pain causing her to sob more. \"Do you not understand that he is poisoning your mind? He will hurt you. Can you not see that? But don't worry…I've taken care of him.\" Rapunzel grabbed her mother's wrist and looked up at her through blurry eyes. \"What did you do to him?\" she demanded. \"It doesn't matter what I did to him…now…I'm going to put you somewhere where no one will ever find you again!\" she yelled and grabbed a pair of rusty scissors. \"No! No! Please, mother don't! No!\" Rapunzel screamed and the Witch began to chop her hair. She began to cut through the long blonde curly strands of hair and they fell to the floor with feather-like grace. Ungrateful, selfish, traitor. The words ran through her head like a mantra as the witch chopped. Finally she was finished and she threw the scissors to the ground. She looked down at the hair then she looked back at her daughter. Rapunzel's sobs had ceased. Her face had taken on a look of shock. Now she was the one who looked hurt and betrayed. She looked up at her mother with such heartbreaking eyes, that the Witch felt her own heart shatter. Her expression wavered, only for a moment before the cold took over her heart once again. She grabbed her daughter's arm and used her magic to teleport them out of the tower. They reappeared in a swamp. Rapunzel wrenched her arm from her mother's grasp and she fell to the ground. She looked around her surroundings and felt her heart clench in fear. \"Where are we?\" \"A swamp. No one will find you here,\" the Witch said. Rapunzel slowly reached up to her head and ran her fingers down her hair. She widened her eyes at the short length. She felt fresh tears form in her eyes and spill down her cheeks. \"You wanted the world…welcome to it,\" the Witch said. \"No, mother, please. I'm sorry,\" she said. \"Please don't leave me here.\" The Witch looked down at her then quickly teleported out of the swamp. She reappeared in the woods at the base of the tower. She felt tears fill her own eyes. Then she quickly blinked them away. \"Children must learn,\" she said to herself. ","Summary":" How dare she? How dare she?

This is my take on it! Reviews welcome. Ella had become accustomed to disappointments throughout her life, but finding out her Prince Charming wasn't as charming as he claimed still hurt. To know the extent of his betrayal, that he would so easily take advantage of an unexpected situation and willingly forget his marriage vows . . . that blow would take some getting used to. As Ella left the baker, Little Red, and Jack at the edge of the woods, she wasn't sure what she was supposed to do now. Yes, she had told Charming they were through, but was it really that simple? She was his wife still, at least legally. Where could she go? Certainly not back to Stepmother's, she thought with a shudder. But what other alternative did she have? \"Ella!\" the baker, whose actual name she couldn't recall (did he even have one?) called. She turned to find the children waiting further up the path, but he was jogging towards Ella. She smiled as he panted, trying to catch his breath. \"The children and I were talking and we thought . . . well what I mean is . . . would you like to . . .\" He blushed. \"Would you like to come live with us?\" Little Red shouted, causing the baker's baby, whom she was holding, to cry at the sudden noise. \"Now look what you did!\" Jack exclaimed, worsening the situation. \"Give him to me, I can make him stop.\" \"Gregory left him with me! I can soothe him. Just watch: I'll sing!\" Ella and Gregory ( that was his name!) cringed as Little Red tried to sing the baby back to sleep. Gregory sighed. \"As you can see, they're a bit of a handful already, but I think the two of us could make it work. If you wanted to, that is.\" She raised an eyebrow. \"So, you want a live-in nanny?\" \"No!\" he exclaimed, blushing further. \"No, that's not it at all. God's teeth, I'm awful at this,\" he muttered. Gregory took a step forward and folded her hand between his. \"I know things with your prince are complicated, but if you would like a safe place to figure out where to go to next, my door will always be open. You can stay as long as you like.\" It was Ella's turn to blush. It was an unexpected gesture of kindness and it broke her heart further. She blinked away the tears and squeezed his hand. \"Your offer is most kind, Gregory, and I think I shall take you up on it, but first I must return to the castle. I've never left a prince before and I'm sure it's not as easy as leaving him in the woods.\" She sighed. \"If only it was as easy to get rid of him as it was to get him,\" she mumbled. Ella looked up at Gregory. \"If you don't see me tonight, I'll send word by messenger of my arrival. I promise I won't leave you and the children in the lurch for too long.\" Gregory shrugged off her concern. \"I'll manage. I may not be a natural with children, but if all else fails, there's always muffins!\" Ella laughed. \"Maybe err on the side of caution with those treats, unless you want the children to need new clothes in a few weeks.\" \"Good point.\" He squeezed her hands then let them go. \"Good luck, Ella. I'll see you soon.\" She bowed her head. \"You as well, Gregory.\" She then set off down the road towards the castle and wondered whether or not her prince was waiting. Ella found him at the archery range notching another arrow. She watched him for a moment. For once, no courtiers were fawning around him, begging for favours. No women were attempting to hang off his arm, either. Ella bit her lip. Why must he be so good looking? This would be so much easier if he were a toad inside and out. But that was part of the problem with their relationship, if one would even bother to call it that. Charming may be handsome, but she barely knew him beyond his chiselled jaw and impressive physique. Perhaps if she had actually talked to him in depth at the ball when they danced, she could have avoided this mess altogether. But the mess had been made and, as usual, Ella was the one who had to clean it up. She took a deep breath and walked across the manicured lawn towards her husband. Just as Charming was about to raise his bow and fire, he caught a glimpse of her from the corner of his eye. His face immediately lit up and he dropped everything to run to her. She imagined he thought this was some sort of grand reunion and she felt herself tense up at the thought of his touch. She stopped a foot away from him and held up her hand. He skidded to a halt and stared at her in shock. \"My darling, you're back! I'm so happy.\" He tried to embrace her, but she took a step back, causing him to stumble forward. Obviously, this was the first time his touch hadn't been sought after. He caught himself in time and raised himself to his full height. He stared at her, his brow furrowed in concern. \"Ella, whatever is the matter? I thought you were here to make up.\" She could have laughed at his stupidity. Did he even listen to a word I said earlier? \"Charming, I'm here because I need to collect my things and finalize our annulment. I'm not here to take you back.\" \"Take me back? It is I who should take you back after you abandoned me in the woods!\" he exclaimed. Charming pressed a hand over his heart. \"You wounded me greatly, Ella. I thought my heart would break.\" She glared at him. \"I left you because you cheated on me , you ogre!\" Charming gasped. \"Ogre? Ogre? I am a prince!\" \"Not a charming one, I should think,\" she hissed. Charming shook his head. \"Charming or not, I am a prince and one doesn't just leave royalty like that. It simply isn't done.\" \"Are you not going to take responsibility, then? You're just going to ignore the fact that you couldn't remain faithful to me for even a day? One simple day? Our wedding day, no less!\" \"I waited for you for three days, Ella!\" he shouted. \"I searched for you and searched for you. I was dedicated! I still am. It was you who kept running and you still are.\" Ella stepped closer to Charming and jabbed her finger against his chest. \"I ran because I was frightened, because I didn't know what I was doing, and I still don't! I married a man I barely knew to escape a life of abuse and cruelty. I'm not saying I didn't make mistakes, but you contributed to this, too! It's time you actually owned up to it, Charming. You owe me at least that.\" Charming's gaze shifted from her harsh glare to her dishpan hands and the bruise peaking out from the bodice of her dress, near her shoulder. He paused. \"I didn't know they hurt you, Ella,\" he said quietly. \"Why would you? You barely asked about me at all,\" she said, trying to speak around the lump growing in her throat. She didn't expect this confrontation to go this way. \"I never told anyone while I was there, and I certainly wasn't going to tell my new husband that I am damaged goods. How could you have wanted me after that?\" Charming gently took her hand in his, removing it from his chest, and met her gaze with a sort of kindness she hadn't expected to see. She had never seen anything in his eyes but a fierce determination, a confidence she never had. Not since she lost her father, her home . . . everything. \"I am sorry, Ella. You are right; I have treated you most unkindly. Before and after this afternoon.\" He lowered his gaze. \"I am not used to feeling this guilt. It is . . . uncomfortable, to say the least.\" \"It usually is.\" She slowly removed her hand from his and hoped the tingling would stop soon. \"And I am sorry as well. I think we both went into this marriage with unrealistic expectations. Perhaps it would have been better if we never danced together in the first place.\" Charming's throat bobbed and she noticed tears in his eyes as he shook his head roughly. \"No, dancing with you was the best decision I ever made and I will not regret that. I have done many things I regret over the years and I'm sure more will follow, but that is not one.\" She hadn't expected such passion from him, not about a few simple nights of dancing. But perhaps they meant more to him than she thought. Ella slowly nodded. \"I don't regret it either.\" They didn't say anything for a moment. This is not going quite as planned. She expected to be in her room by now collecting her things. Now what? \"If an annulment is truly what you want, I won't fight you on it,\" Charming said. \"But I would like to request one thing. Will you let me court you properly before I talk to my parents and the bishop about an annulment?\" He tilted his head down to gaze at her closely. Ella blushed. \"I want to know for sure I did not let the best thing that's ever happened to me out of my life before we give it one final, real try.\" Ella gulped. Has his gaze always been this intense? \"If I may request one thing myself,\" she said quietly. \"Anything. Name it and you shall have it.\" \"My father's house. I want my father's house in my name,\" she said so fast she wasn't sure she had actually voiced her one dream. \"It passed to my stepmother when he died, but he wanted me to have it when I was old enough. My stepmother and stepsisters had me live there as a maid to humiliate me. I want to honour his memory, and my mother's.\" Charming nodded. \"I will have the paperwork drawn up today. Is that all? No carriages full of gold? No mountains of jewels?\" Ella laughed. \"You have already given me my heart's desire, Charming. I couldn't ask for anything else.\" Charming smiled. \"You have a lovely laugh. I didn't realize that before.\" Ella blushed. \"I don't believe I laughed much before.\" She took a step away from Charming. \"I should go and collect my things. The baker, Gregory, has invited me to stay with him and the children for a time. I would like to move them into the house with me, once the paperwork is done.\" Charming frowned. \"The baker? Is he in love with you too, then? Shall it be a battle for your heart?\" Ella chuckled. \"Everything isn't as dramatic as all that, Charming. Or as easily explained.\" She shook her head. \"He is a friend and he just lost his wife. Three children is a lot to handle on a baker's salary. I should like to help them out, if I can. After all, his misery is partially our fault, is it not?\" Charming blushed. \"I suppose. But he had best not try anything while you are there. You are a married woman, after all.\" \"And you a married man, in case you forget again,\" she said with a bitter smile. \"If I hear of another woman, Charming, it's over. And I won't hesitate to tell your family, and anyone else who will listen, the truth behind our annulment. Do you understand?\" Charming bowed his head. \"Of course, Ella. I promise it won't happen again.\" She nodded. \"Good. When will the paperwork be ready to sign?\" \"Tomorrow morning. I'll send a carriage for you.\" \"No need, I'll walk.\" She was about to leave the archery range when she remembered something. \"Oh, and Charming?\" He smiled. \"Yes?\" \"Please allot my stepmother enough money to find a new house to live in. She may be cruel, but I don't want her destitute. The guilt would eat me alive.\" \"She will be given something, I assure you.\" She bowed her head. \"Goodbye, Charming.\" \"Until tomorrow, Ella.\" Ella really didn't believe Charming would keep his word about the house or staying away from other women. He hadn't been honest in the past and she wasn't sure his sincerity could be relied upon. But to her utter shock, Ella's father's house became hers with one signature and just like that, Ella's life was more that just cooking, cleaning, and avoiding the next slap. At first, Gregory refused to move into Ella's house. It wouldn't be proper, he said, with his wife so recently passed. What would people think? \"People are already talking about you, the children, and myself. Why not give them a good story?\" she countered. After days of pressure from Ella, Little Red, and Jack, Gregory finally gave in. He insisted Ella take the master's room. He claimed he was more than happy to stay on the second floor across from the children's bedrooms. The children didn't seem to mind sharing Florinda and Lucinda's old chamber, even with the baby there as well, since it was twice the size of their old one. Little Red and Jack had turned into quite capable babysitters, which was just as well since Ella had a great deal on her hands with a house to restore and a future to decide upon. Gregory spent most of his day at his bakery in the village, leaving Ella to bring old relics from her mother and father's time out from the attic and back to the main levels of the house. Her stepmother's tacky decorations were soon put in the attic for another time, perhaps for when Little Red needed a dowry. Someone will want to buy that old junk. Her stepmother had also let the garden fall into disrepair over the years. Ella simply hadn't had the time to maintain it and when the gardener was fired, Ella could have cried. Now, every morning she got her hands dirty tending to her vegetable patches and wildflowers. That was how Charming found her the first afternoon he paid her a visit. It was altogether a shocking but pleasant visit. He stayed only a few hours and even commented on the beauty of the house. \"It reminds me of the village house my mother grew up in before my father chose her to be his bride. She always wanted to go back there someday, but she died too soon and too young.\" It was the first time Ella realized they had something in common. After that, his visits were more frequent and longer. He helped her with chores around the house and when those were done, she let him take her on horseback rides, picnics, and other outings. Her birds informed her when he wasn't there that he hadn't been seen with any woman, as far as they could tell. No woman was bragging about the prince more than usual. It was as if Charming was actually keeping his word. It was difficult to convince the children (and Gregory) that Charming was changing, but when Charming taught Jack a bit of swordplay and gave Little Red her own hunting knife, it was hard for them to deny he was actually a decent person. Even Gregory started to come around when Charming started to buy pastries exclusively from Gregory's shop. There was so much money coming in that Gregory had to open a second shop and hire more apprentices to keep up with the workload. Several months after the confrontation at the archery range, Charming was lingering in Ella's library after supper. Gregory had offered to put the children to bed and Ella hadn't heard the baby cry in a half hour, so there was a good chance everyone else was asleep as well. Charming was looking at a copy of ancient Greek history when Ella shut the library door quietly behind her. She had a glass of mulled apple cider in each hand. \"I always like cider when it's this chilly out,\" Ella said quietly. Although the house was insulated, she knew how sensitive the baby was to noise, even this far away. Charming thanked her for the cider and guided her to the couch, where he wrapped her in the blanket lying there. \"It will be winter soon. My hip has been popping everyday for a week.\" Ella giggled. \"You sound old.\" He frowned, a glimmer of a laughter hiding in his eyes. \"I am most offended, my lady. Just for that, I shall let you freeze.\" He tried to take the blanket from her, which ended in a tug of war where Ella's cider tipped over and they ended up in a tangled mess on the floor. Ella buried her head in Charming's chest as she laughed and she could feel Charming shaking as he smothered his giggles in her auburn hair. \"If the baby wakes up, this is all your fault,\" she whispered. She knew they should pull themselves off the floor, but she was quite comfortable lying on his chest as he rested on his back. She felt his arm snake around her waist. The heat from it made her sigh. They stayed there, quiet and content, for some time. When the clock struck twelve, Charming sighed. \"I should head back to the castle. If I'm going to come here tomorrow to help you fix the back fence, I'll need my beauty sleep.\" Instead of making a comment on his beauty, Ella's heart raced. \"Or you could just spend the night.\" In all the months of visits, Charming had never spent the night. He had never asked and she never offered. But the more he came over and proved he had changed, the more she learned about him . . . and the more she realized maybe an annulment wasn't what she wanted after all. Charming sat up, being careful to keep Ella close to him but not hurt her back. She sat on his lap, her legs on either side of his waist and tried not to blush as she felt his stare. \"Is that what you want?\" he asked quietly, his hand weaving through her auburn locks, tilting her head up so she would look at him. God's blood, he is very handsome in firelight. She nodded. \"Yes,\" she whispered, tilting her head towards his. \"I do.\" Ella had only kissed her husband once, maybe twice, since they met, and she forgot how good he was at it. Before she knew it, his shirt was completely unbuttoned and her dress was half off, leaving her skin chilled but on fire at the same time, if that were possible. Ella pulled away from Charming just as he was beginning to unbutton the rest of her dress. \"Wait!\" she whispered, glancing at the door. \"What?\" he asked, panting. \"Have you changed your mind? I can go, if you like, I don't-\" \"Shush!\" she covered his mouth with her hand and waited. \"I thought I heard someone.\" She removed her hand and kissed his nose. \"Before this goes any further, we need a door that locks.\" Charming cradled her face gently in his hands and gave her a soft kiss. \"Good thinking, my love. One that's close by, I hope. I don't think I can wait much longer for you.\" He trailed kisses down her neck, nipping a little here and there, enough to drive her mad. She barely managed to regain her senses and get off his lap. \"If you let me get somewhat decently dressed we can make a run to my chamber,\" she chastised playfully. He pouted but did as he was told and got his shirt buttoned on. They ran from the library, cider completely forgotten, but before they went in, he picked her up to carry her across the threshold. \"This is silly,\" she whispered. \"It isn't even our wedding night!\" \"No, but it's the one we should have had, if things had worked out differently,\" he reminded as he shut the door behind them. One of the servants had stoked the fire and it was still going when the couple entered Ella's chamber. \"True, although I doubt I would have been this eager in the spring,\" she said with a chuckle as she began undressing her husband. \"Yes, it might have been a bit awkward, I'll give you that,\" he murmured against her skin, his mouth once again latched onto her neck. This time, she didn't tell him to stop. Ella did have to return to the castle with Charming, but during her months away, he had customized their bedchamber so it would feel more like her father's manor than a cold, isolated castle bedroom. She appreciated the little touches he made, such as the bookcases and cozy rugs. The manor did stay in her name, and she visited quite frequently, but ultimately it was Little Red and Jack who had the run of the place, and at thirteen and fourteen, respectively, they did a decent job with the help of the servants and Gregory. In the end, \"Cinderella\" truly did live happily ever after with her Prince Charming.

Prince Charming, the elder, strode, and so did the younger, but with quick, alternating glances at his elder brother's steps and face, checking what he was doing. Annabel was almost certain that the younger prince's mimicry was unconscious, a mere by-product of growing up in the huge, dense, exuberant shadow of Charming. Charming seized his brother around the neck and noogied him in the head, causing the younger prince – what on earth was his name? Annabel wondered – to pull away with a shout of laughter and shake his head like a horse, scattering water everywhere. It was then that Annabel noticed that they both looked like they had gone swimming with their clothes on - mostly on, she amended, with an eye on their open shirts. It was also then that they noticed her. \"You there! Girl!\" Annabel froze as the heir's voice pinned her in place. Please don't let him ask me to bring him new clothes. Please, please… Annabel wasn't sure whether prayer worked, but she was praying with all her might now. Such an invitation she could not refuse, and it could, and likely would, destroy her reputation, as well as the little she possessed that might make her an attractive wife. God was listening, apparently. \"Send for my steward. Have him meet me in my room with a change of clothes,\" Charming continued. \"And mine,\" put in the nameless younger prince. \"And his,\" added Charming. Annabel dropped a quick curtsey and fled as Charming continued speaking to his brother. \"And her voice—oh, my God, what a voice! I'm sure you've never heard anything so beautiful.\" \"I'd argue that, brother…\" The younger prince's argument, whatever it was, was lost as Annabel closed the small servants' door. She leaned against it, pulse still hard in her neck as she thanked Heaven for the near miss, and also for the fact that she wasn't the one who had to rescue the younger prince's leather hose. Then she picked up her skirts a little and ran. It wouldn't do to delay, or she ran the risk of being remembered.

He looked up and saw the horrible she-giant meandering towards him. It was then everything seemed to go in slow motion. He began to think about how his life led up to death by nobleness. He grinned to himself in satisfaction. He would be praised by all the peasants if he survived this. Prince Charming drew his sword and charged at the giant, piercing its foot. However, what the Prince thought as bravery was only stupidity. The infuriated giantess bent down and grabbed the Prince by his torso. \"How dare you, a pathetic human, stab me!\", the giant screamed in her earsplitting voice.

Life had pretty much gone back to normal, the village was rebuilt, the Prince had become King and had taken a new wife as his Queen. Cinderella had stayed with the Baker and helped to raise his son, who was now 10 and growing into a strong and capable young boy. After that day, 10 years ago, Jack and Little Red Riding Hood had no family to go back to, so they stayed with the Baker and Cinderella. They had become a very close family, like mismatched bits of clothing that one puts together to make a very passable and unique outfit. As Jack and Red (as he liked to call her) grew, they discovered they shared the same ideas of what they wanted their life to be. They both loved to travel, liked being in charge of what they did and both had a strong will to see and do things that others would find commendable. They, although for the most part, grew up as brother and sister, they also grew to have fond feelings for each other that went beyond the feelings one has for siblings. Cinderella and the Baker noticed this and thought it best they introduce Jack and Red to other people before things got more complicated than they were already. Cinderella found a boisterous and affectionate girl named Kate, while the Baker found a stable and boring young man named Fred. Now, Jack and Red found out about their plans and decided to play along and have some fun. They had found that life had become quite boring, and being now in their twenties, they craved some excitement and thought this would be just the ticket. And, they loved the idea of working together on a plan, it made them feel all the closer to one another. They set to work in devising their plan, but first, but first they had to find out a few things about Fred and Kate to make sure their plan would be successful.

And his young son. \"How much happier he'd be if his mother was around,\" the Baker lamented. \"Oh don't say that,\" Cinderella replied, she looked at the young child and softly whispered, \"I lost my mother too…\" There was a knock on the door. Cinderella opened it. To her surprise, it was the Steward. The man who had killed Jack's Mother 5 years back. Cinderella curtsied, \"Good day, sir,\" \"The prince has requested you visit his castle. As well as your family,\" the Steward proclaimed. \"My family? This is the only family I know,\" Cinderella replied. \"Your… step-family…\" the Steward corrected. Yes, Cinderella was to be reunited with her rotten step-family. The family who tortured her as a kitchen wench, made her do all the work, and forced to stay home from the ball. \"And… when does he request us to his castle?\" Cinderella asked, grieving over the fact that she'd have to see those wretched women again. \"At dusk, malady…\" the Steward replied. \"Right then,\" Cinderella agreed, \"I shall get ready.\" \"Very good. I shall inform the prince immediately.\" the Steward informed, as he mounted unto his horse, \"Fare thee well!\" he shouted as he rode off. Jack came down the stairs, looking uneasy. \"Is he gone?\" Jack asked the Baker. \"Yes, Jack, he's gone.\" \"Okay, good,\" Jack continued down the stairs, \"I know it has been 4 years, but… it still haunts me.\" \"Don't let it worry you, son,\" the Baker calmly reassured, \"it was merely the past.\" The Baker walked towards Jack, \"and the past is behind us,\" \"And the past is behind us,\" Jack repeated. He suddenly became more cheerful, \"Right! It was just the past!\" and he ran out of the house, in the direction of the market. Cinderella hurried upstairs to her bedroom and began fixing her hair. Little Red was in the room as well, \"Oh, hello Red,\" Cinderella smiled. Little Red noticed Cinderella and glumly said, \"Hello.\" \"Is something the matter, Red?\" Cinderella asked. \"I'm not sure,\" Red responded, \"I have an urge to go back into the woods, and its killing me.\" \"Why would you want to go back to that horrible place?\" Cinderella asked as she put on makeup. \"Because I'm not afraid of it,\" Red explained, \"sure I may have been eaten alive by a wolf but it was exciting… and scary. I was excited and scared.\" \"You were the bravest one, 4 years back.\" Cinderella admitted. \"Do you really think so?\" Red asked Cinderella. Cinderella responded, \"Yes, I truly do.\" \"Thank you,\" Red cried as she jumped into Cinderella's arms, hugging her. After Red let go, Cinderella got her dress out of the closet, and put it on. She headed downstairs. \"I'm off,\" she announced to the Baker and Jack. \"Don't be out too late,\" the Baker required. \"Have fun,\" Jack exclaimed. Cinderella rode off in the carriage they had purchased with the five gold pieces Jack had stolen from the Giants. Red came down the stairs and went to the Baker, \"Can we go back into the woods?\" she asked him. \"Why do wish that?!\" he asked, baffled. \"I wish to go to my Granny's cottage. I miss it.\" Red responded. Jack watched in silence, as he thought about his house too. He stood next to Red, \"I wish to go to my old cottage as well.\" The Baker contemplated for a minute, \"Hm. Very well… I could use supplies if we find them. I did have the idea of expanding the cottage. And if we expand, then I can get the new thatched roof I've always wanted. And the new chimney.\" Red and Jack looked at each other in excitement. \"Well,\" the Baker exclaimed, \"what are we waiting for!\" The gang bolted out the door and down the street. They past the Witch's garden, and tried not to think about it. They were stopped by a peddler on the street, right by the entrance to the woods. He was old and wizened. \"Good day there, folks. Perhaps you'd be interested in some of my extra special loaves of bread! Guaranteed to repel wolves!\" he yelled. \"Nonsense,\" Jack remarked, as they carried on.

After I'm done beating you at this dare, I'm coming for you!\" \"I'd like to see you try!\" Responded a lean boy around her age. It was around noon. Jack had rushed into Red's room with a prideful smile and announced he had been able to climb all the branches of the tremendous oak outside their village. Being the egoistic child she was, instead of congratulating him on this seemingly-impossible task, she claimed she could do it as well. It was that moment he took it a step further and dared her to climb it faster than he had. \"Only ten seconds until you lose!\" Jack sneered, and proceeded to count. Red strained harder to the next branch, biting her lip until it almost started bleeding. \"Ten...\" \"Stupid muscles, work harder..\" She mumbled and continued to try to pull herself up. \"Only five more seconds left, Red!\" Finally, Red got a good grip on the branch and heaved herself up as quick as she could. \"...Aaaand zero! Ha-ha, I beat yo-\" Jack looked up to see Red sticking her tongue out at him from the highest branch. \"Aw man, how do you always manage to beat me at everything?\" Jack pouted and leaned against the tree. He thought he heard something stir behind him, but when he turned around saw nothing. Jack glanced back up at Red. \"Don't know, I guess I am just more fit to survive. After all, I did beat a wolf!\" Little Red Riding Hood made mock growling noises followed by whimpering. \"Well,\" he thought for a moment, \"you didn't beat any wolf! You had to be saved!\" Red was silent for a moment as she sat on the branch and looked down at him. \"Well, you made two giants mad!\" The girl spat. \"Because you dared me to!\" \"Because I thought you were lying to me!\" Jack groaned. \"This could go on forever! Let's just go home. Lunch should be almost ready.\" \"I'll meet you there, okay?\" Red told him, lying down as if she were to take a nap. \"No, I'm waiting for you.\" Jack insisted. \"C'mon slowpoke.\" \"Don't call me a slowpoke!\" She shouted back and sat up. \"I just need to.. Take some time for deep thinking.\" \"Deep thinking?\" Jack almost bursted out laughing then immediately stopped at a sudden realization. \"Wait.. You can't get down, can you?\" \"...Maybe...\" She admitted quietly. Before he could respond, there it was, that sound again! Jack turned around towards the bushes and still saw no sign of light. He turned towards Red again, more impatient because of the possible danger. \"Alright, umm..\" Jack tried to think of a solution. \"Oh, uh, I got it! But you're not going to like it.\" \"What is it?\" Red asked. \"Jump down and I'll catch you. You can trust me, I think.\" Jack anxiously awaited until how she would respond. He had often thought of her as someone he tried to impress, but never understood why. He would certainly impress her with this. \"No way, Mister Liar!\" She pointed at him annoyed. \"You wouldn't catch me.\" His heart sank. He shouldn't have even hoped she would agree. \"Try me.\" Jack opened his arms out. \"We have no other options right now.\" \"Well, okay..\" She wordlessly leaped down as he held out his arms to catch her. Fortunately, Red seemed to be falling right in his direction. He was preparing for her to land in his arms when he felt a push from behind him. Jack stumbled forward and hit his head on the hard wood. Jack heard something hard hit the ground. Oh no.. Red! Guilt washed over Jack. He had to find her. \"So dizzy..\" He groaned, looking around for her on the ground. \"Oh, there..\" Red was lying directly under the spot where he had been standing before the shove. She was clearly unconscious. Her hands laid limp at her sides besides her palms which were clutching her wolf cape as if danger were nearby. Every once in a while, the girl would move slightly or make a small noise. For once, she didn't seem annoyed or tense. Jack realized he had been staring for far too long. Oops. \"Man, I wonder what pushed me.. Was is what was making the noise I was hearing behind me?\" He wondered aloud, glancing behind him. To his surprise, he noticed a trail of wolf paw prints leading to the woods. No.. It couldn't be... The Wolf was dead.. Jack shrugged. Some questions were better left unanswered. He bent down and scooped Red up, beginning to carry her back to the Baker's cottage. ","Summary":" (Hi! This is going to be a JackHood story! Both friendship and romance.

Summary: They find their way out of the woods, the birds find Cinderella and she finds something out. Disclaimer: I don't profit from writing this fanfiction. Author's Note: Post movie (I haven't seen a theatrical production). The title was inspired by Sondheim's 'Being Alive'. Found family. Supernatural elements. 1,611 words. Not alone, alive: shallowness They reach the point in the story where they all made the decision to live with the Baker, his voice peters out, his son is asleep and it's time for them to leave the woods. They find a path out in the early morning light, but they all wonder what further destruction will lie at its end, so it is not just weariness that makes slows their pace. Cinderella keeps looking back for Jack and the little girl and recognizes the anxiety in their eyes. \"We can't call you Little Girl.\" Cinderella says, \"What's your name?\" \"Call me Red,\" she says, and from that point on they will. In the village, the bakery stands untouched along with a clutch of other houses. The Baker lets out a sigh of relief when he sees it. They all quicken their speed. He lets them into his home. They sleep through the morning in whatever nook they can find. After waking, Jack wants to go outside to explore, but doesn't get very far, for all available hands are needed to rebuild the village. Red stays behind to root around the kitchen, while, out of habit, Cinderella washes the dishes. \"Do you know how to bake?\" the Baker asks. \"No,\" Red answers. \"I should learn.\" The Baker nods and looks around, the slight hesitation revealing how much his wife was a part of the process. He says, \"I don't normally bake this late, but we could rustle something up.\" Once she's done with the dishes, Cinderella offers to come up with better sleeping arrangements. She still remembers the confines of the castle and the tangles of the wood all too well, so she doesn't mind. This house is in between grandeur and grime, and it's standing. She starts to clean, as the scent of baking bread permeates everywhere, as it must have done before the giantess came. Villagers come asking for bread, as the afternoon draws to a close. The Baker is the only one who talks of prices, and he gives that up soon enough and says the bread will be free for just for one day, but one day becomes two, and then the Baker is paid in goods and favors, not gold coin. This is life, and it is not spent alone. Cinderella is nobody's mother, nobody's princess, nobody's drudge. But she helps to plait Red's hair, she makes sure Jack has enough bread before he leaves to join the work crew and she croons at the baby, and when she picks him up because he's crying, she takes him to the father who must be both father and mother. Nobody shouts at her and nobody sweet talks her. The birds find Cinderella quickly enough. It's a relief. All her life, before her mother and then her father left her, they have been there. They heard her cry. They always came. They will always come. The way she understands them amuses the children still. They have no gift for it and say all they hear is birdsong. So, Cinderella has to translate what her birds tell her about the rebuilding that is taking place far and wide throughout the kingdom. It's good to hear that they're not the only makeshift family springing up. Although nobody else knows the full story of dangerous wishes, golden shoes, stolen harps and magic beans, and although many have their own griefs, they're not stuck in the pitch. The news brings a smile to the Baker's face too. It's good to see. He smiles at his son and he smiles at Jack, sometimes, when the boy forgets that his mother is dead and is still a boy, a little reckless, a little prone to show off in front of Red. And Red is a good study in the kitchen, although she doesn't always follow the orders the Baker gives. But he nods in approval at the girl, Cinderella sees. They tell each other their stories over meals. Jack's are full of where he'll go and Red's are full of what she'll do. Cinderella remembers when she craved experience. That craving is a little tempered now, but every place the birds talk about make her wonder if some day she could see them for herself. The Baker tells his stories to his son first, but as the baby slips off into sleep halfway, the others know they are stories for them too. One late night, not yet midnight, but late, so late that Jack's head is pillowed by his arms, and like Red and the baby, he is asleep, the Baker is recounting still. \"...and yesterday my wife told me that my sister must still be alive—\" \"What did you say?\" Cinderella asks, awakened from the trance she'd been drifting into. \"My sister must still be alive – Rapunzel, the baby the witch stole and brought up as her own.\" \"No, before that,\" Cinderella says, although she notes that he may be right. She didn't get to know her fellow princess much, no more born to palace life than Cinderella herself, but she seemed nice, and if she is the Baker's sister, he should find her and get to know her. Perhaps she could ask the birds to keep a watch. They will deal with that later. \"My w-wife told me,\" the Baker has realised his slip. He is a good man, a brave man, a fallible man. \"Yesterday,\" Cinderella says. \"You said yesterday.\" With more gentleness, she adds. \"Your wife is dead. How can you have spoken to her yesterday?\" He is so quiet that she can hear the fire crackle and the children breathe. And underneath it all, her heart is beating faster than it did before. \"In the woods, she speaks to me, sometimes.\" Cinderella remembers a figure in a willow tree, a figure she knows she will never see again, and how it warmed her to hear such lovr when she was so very cold. Her silence must be what encourages the Baker to add. \"And my father. He's spoken to me there too.\" At those words, her eyes widen. \"Your father?\" The Baker nods, and turns to fuss with the baby's blanket rather than face her. She doesn't know what to say. Cinderella is glad that the children are asleep, because she has enough to work through with her own emotions. She's not sure what she feels – there's jealousy there, certainly –and she knows she needs to sort it out now. She heard only her mother's voice. She thought the Baker was going through the same thing as her, but the woods have given him more. He has lost more, she tells herself swiftly. Some of what she lost was something she never had. \"Is there a place?\" she asks, remembering one afternoon, four days ago, when the Baker said he was going to speak to Jack, leaving Cinderella and Red in charge of the baby and house. He was carrying a pick and a spade, Jack told them, and they all knew he had gone to bury his wife. \"A place where they talk to you?\" \"No particular place. Just in the woods. When I'm walking there.\" His voice is low, muffled. \"Is it just them?\" she asks. \"What?\" the Baker yelps. He had got up to move towards Jack. It's not the first night he'll carry or lead the boy to bed. There should be a bedtime for him and for Red too, but the last time the children had one, they had a mother to insist they went to sleep. Now they have nightmares, and Cinderella doubts if her voice and whatever she says are comfort enough. \"Red's grandmother or your mother or...Has anyone else spoken to you?\" she clarifies. \"Jack's mother, I think. Once.\" His clears his throat. \"Don't tell him.\" She wants to promise not to, but she can't. \"Maybe he should know,\" she says instead. \"I think he'd like to know. But it would be better coming from you.\" She lets the words settle into his mind and thinks about the conversations with her mother by her willow-tree grave. \"Do they listen to you? Like the birds listen to me?\" \"Er, it doesn't quite work like that.\" \"Oh.\" \"Why?\" Cinderella is looking at Red when he asks, and it's now her turn not to be able to look him in the eye. \"I just thought if my mother—. If you were to hear from her, could you say that I'm sorry that her grave was destroyed?\" \"Where we met,\" he says, soft and sad, and Cinderella says no more, but thinks of mothers and fathers, and children, and how they are not left alone, not entirely, as the Baker rouses Jack enough to get him to make his way up to bed. Eventually, Cinderella finds a blanket of grey and green woven some winter by another woman, and wraps it around Red, who dropped to sleep in a rocking chair and looks settled until a bad dream wakes her. Cinderella goes up to her room in the eaves of the house and thinks about how the birds will come in the morning and find her here. Perhaps she will be tending to the hearth, perhaps someone else will. Customers, perhaps even paying ones, will come to the Baker's too, and find bread baked. Phantom voices may urge the Baker on, if not tomorrow, then in the days after that. And for a time, she will be here, and Jack and Red and a baby boy, in a bakery, in a village on the edge of the woods, in a kingdom being rebuilt by their own hands.

And in this village lived a childless baker with his wife. She had overheard, while not in the habit of overhearing, two princes talking. She hadn't seen a prince before coming to the woods, and now there were two, two princes walking. Two princes walking in the woods, talking about maidens in the woods. Near the rose thickets one prince had said, what sort of name is Rapunzel the other had said. Hair as yellow as corn one prince had said, disappeared like a fine morning mist the other had said. It's dark and soggy and muddy and foggy near the rose thickets. The moss and the trees all chirping with crickets. The branches tug at her dress, at her hair, and all the rest. Brambles and spines and thorns, all for some hair as yellow as corn. An evening fog had rolled swiftly in, shrouding the trees and the woods and her feet. Tripping and falling over bunches of leaves the Baker's Wife ends up on her knees. She stands and brushes the dirt off her dress, - \"-but who would notice dirt on a dress like this?\" She comes to a wall all ruined and broken, she braces herself and a sigh from her throat comes. High above her head a dark tower rises, according to the prince – full of glittering prizes. How terrible it must have been, for a girl so young and fair, to live in a tower high up in the air. No doors or stairs and surrounded by thickets. How terrible it must have been high up in that tower, and the Baker's Wife feels so sorry for her. She feels, guilty, then for what she must do. It seems such a cruel thing to put this girl through. But instead, she decides, of stealing the hair she'd climb up, up the tower, high up in the air. She would just ask Rapunzel for a lock of her hair. Nervously she skittered around the base of the tower, it would soon be midnight – that terrible hour. And so the Wife clears her throat, to hit the right note, and speaks clearly from the base of the tower – \"Rapunzel, Rapunzel, let down your hair to me.\" Nervously she spoke, unsure of herself. She called out to the castle, to the girl on the shelf. High up above a window swung open, deep in her chest she could hear her heart thumping. So late at night and such a strange request, the Baker's wife was sure she'd be turned away. But earnestly and bright the words came down to her – \"Is that you at this hour, my prince?\" She had to think fast and she had to think quickly, when the words came down to her they had come down so sweetly. So she lowered her voice and spoke rather thickly – \"Yes.\" The heart in her chest still beat ever more quickly. And then came down, from high up on the tower, a long plait of hair that smelled faintly of flowers. The Baker's Wife gave it a tug and it seemed to be strong, she wondered how on earth her hair got this long. Smiling sweetly she noted its colour, the long plait of hair that had come from above her, as yellow as corn just as she'd heard. She was sure then and there that she had her girl. With her boot on the wall and her hands on the hair the Wife climbed the tower that was built without stairs. She climbs in the window and meets the girl's gaze, the girl whose hair is the colour of maize. But Rapunzel looks confused at the woman climbing in – the prince had never looked quite so thin. Surprised and confused and terribly scared she went to ask the woman what was she doing here, but all that came out past her worried stare - \"Y-you're not the prince…\" The Baker's wife, sorry to lie, came out with a wince. She was certainly not the prince. \"No, I ah- came here to ask you a favour.\" \"Where is the prince, the prince my saviour?\" \"The prince is fine but I need your help.\" \"What do you want?\" Rapunzel said with a yelp \"I need a lock of your hair.\" \"Whatever do you need a lock of my hair for? Where is the prince?\" \"The prince is fine but I need your hair.\" \"I think I'd like you to leave, unless you've more to declare?\" \"I need your hair to have a child, please, we can trade? My boots – they're suede! I-I can bring you bread, it's homemade!\" \"No, no. Now you really must go.\" The Baker's Wife won't leave and Rapunzel won't give up her hair, so they come up with a plan to say fair is fair . Rapunzel, so lonesome up in her tower, wants to know love and its exquisite power. She hasn't been kissed and she hasn't been loved, she's sat in her tower so high up above. So she asks for a kiss in exchange for her hair, the Wife simply says we'd make an interesting pair. But Rapunzel is insistent and won't take any less, and it didn't matter, she says, that we both wear a dress. \"A kiss? For this?\" \"Yes, a kiss. A kiss for this.\" \"You've princes and castles and romance and all, a kiss from me could not - would not - enthral!\" \"But you do not know how it is in this castle, away from life and all the hustle and bustle. I'm surrounded by thickets and walls and trees. And you come and go just as you please, out of the woods and away from the trees. Back to the village and back to your street. With doors and stairs and the clamber of feet. And me with no space and no lover's embrace, I dream and dream of that heavenly space. Past all the woods and the walls and the trees, away from the thicket and the thick woodland breeze. I dream of a kiss so perfect and pure, I dream of a kiss that makes me want more, until I'm moaning and groaning like some common wh-…\" \"Alright!\" The wife interrupted – Rapunzel was sure. \"You've made your point, and I agree to your trade. I'll kiss you as best and as good as I know, but afterwards, though, I will have to go.\" The decision was made, the two had their trade. A kiss for some hair, and fair was fair. Next to the bed Rapunzel stayed, while the Baker's Wife came out of the shade. Above their heads was a bright cascade, with little white flowers that were hung and arrayed. Unsure of herself and feeling quite nervous, the Wife runs her hands down the front of her dress. \"I haven't kissed a girl before.\" She says, giggling, her eyes on the floor. Timidly she walks over to the blonde, whose features are pointed and fine and her eyes are dark and the Wife thinks they're so very different to mine . She raises her hands and puts them on the girl's shoulders, who relishes the contact and practically smoulders. The Baker's Wife looks into Rapunzel's eyes and gently smiles, surprised at how good the skin of those bare shoulders feels under her fingers. There's a hint of something in the blonde's eyes, and the Wife's heart beats when she sees that it lingers. Her gaze flickers between her lips and her eyes. It was a pleasure to look over such a glorious prize. The Baker's Wife runs her hands over the girl's shoulders. The Baker's Wife runs her hands over the girl's neck. She's overcome with lust in her eyes and thinks to herself oh what a prize. With her work-hardened hands on a soft delicate jaw the Baker's Wife has never felt this before. She leans in slowly, going in for the kiss, never with her husband had she felt such bliss. Her breath comes in trembling and the witch's words she has trouble remembering. When at long last their lips come together the Baker's Wife wants to stay here forever. With her hand on the jaw and their stomachs together she hadn't felt this before, not before and not ever. A moan slips her lips as she opens her mouth, a moan slips her lips with her heart thundering loud. A hand moves to Rapunzel's waist, which is so small and taught, bathing her tongue in a heavenly taste. The girl is so soft and so warm, so unlike her husband who was weathered and worn. The Wife's breath came in deep and fast as she started to wonder whether she could last. She deepens their kiss and is delighted to hear Rapunzel mewl at her lips. Clutching at the hips, while her mouth slips while she kisses the lips of this blonde girl and sips on the lust crawling in her body, making her breath and heart beat oddly. The noises she hears are the best she's ever heard, and wants more of them in life, swimming in her world. The Wife wraps her arms around the blonde's neck to pull her in close, as close as the tower and its thickets of rose. Her tongue sweeps over Rapunzel's lip and she feels the girl moan into their kiss. It was utter bliss. Like this. Their tongues then meet, betwixt their kiss, and the Baker's Wife is sure she's never tasted anything so sweet. She is completely overcome by the sensations in her mouth and finally knows what love is about. Electric jolts fire all through her body, with Rapunzel at her mouth who is moaning so softly. The Wife steps back, all giddy and breathless, her kiss with the girl had left her quite weightless. They look at each other with pink swollen lips, unsure if they'll ever feel something like this. The girl has a look that says I want more , but the Wife leans back and says – \"I've never been kissed like that before.\" \"Do you need to leave, are you completely sure?\" With her arms around Rapunzel still, the Baker's wife had never had it so good. She had heard the saying, like all villagers should – there definitely is something about the woods.

I reach into the back of my pack. Phone phone phone, come on where is that stupid thing I thought finally gripping my hand around the phone. I sat down on the rock on the side of the trail. The thick layer of trees and brush surrounding the trail. \"Hey Karyne what's up bestie?\" I said into the phone, twirling my perfect golden hair. \"Nothin just hangin. Where are you I'm totes bored, can we like hang or something.\" \"Sorry I'm going mountain climbinging or whatever it's called, well I've gotta go my moms giving me the mom look.\" I hung up and put my phone in my pocket.\"What do you want, at least I have friends.\" I hopped up stubbing my toe on one of the billions of rocks. \"Ashlyn Jean Miller, you will give me that phone right now!\" My mom yelled at me. \"No why would I, my boyfriend is supposed to call me in like something hours.\"I replied \"Give me that phone or you're grounded from the phone, tablet, ipad, tv, just grounded from electronics in general.\" \"Ooooooh someone's in trouble.\"My obnoxious little brother Billy said in his I'm better than you voice bouncing around us. \"SHUT UP!\" Me and mom yelled in unison. \"Humm where was I, Oh yeah, Give me that phone!\" \"Ugh here you go you didn't need to make that big of a deal about it.\"I finally gave in. I passed her the phone and hoped along. \"Go on ahead, I'll catch up.\" I yelled out to my mom and brother billy. Blarg this is so boring. I thought as I sat down on the rock and took off my backpack. I pulled out my lunch box and grabbed a granola bar. Ugh chocolate chip well I guess that will do. I thought, I quickly ate the bar. \"I'm coming,\" I called out to people that weren't there. I slowly pushed off the rock and continued hiking. The trail becoming steeper by the minute. I walked up to a little fork in the trail. Blarg more options, why did we have to go hiking. I thought I started off on the left trail, let's hope this is the right way. After what felt like an hour though probably was only ten minutes, the trail came to a stop. \"Oh no, this is the wrong way!\" Stupid brain. \"Blarggg\" I looked into the thick layer of brush and trees. Suddenly my eyes landed on a little sheltered cave. \"Okay well I guess I can take a little nap.\" I peeled open my eyes expecting to see the ceiling of my room. Where am I? What's happening to me? I wondered. Then the memories came flooding back. Huh so it wasn't a dream. Over the three days I had whittled a bow afterward I had gone hunting collected berries and even built a fire and fort. It had been a long few days, but I've made it through, surprisingly. I leaned the twigs into tepee position and grab the matches from my bag. I pulled out a match and lit the fluff at the bottom. I stared into the fire the breeze whipping the flames about. The brown leaves drifted into the fire. The light of the fire illuminated the rainbow of trees. I sat down on the log and stared into the thick brush and layer of trees. I turned around and saw two bright blue eyes staring at me from behind a blueberry bush. \" Who are you? What do you want? I can see you, you know.\" \"Ruff grrrr\" I closed my eyes bracing for impact. Aaahhhh! Please don't hurt me I'm a good girl. I opened up my eyes and saw the bush rustle then a big gray head poked out. A dog, why is it out here? This is a forest. \"Hello little doggie,\" I said reaching out to it. \"Are you hungry?\" \"Ruhr Ruhr,\" the dog replied wagging his tail. I reached into my backpack and tossed the dog a hare from the hunt earlier. The dog grabbed the hare then ran off. Well let's go hunting I guess. I thought to myself. I walked over to the cave. I grabbed the bow I had made earlier and ran out of the cave. The thick layer of branches leaning up against the cave. The dog I met earlier ran up to me and started barking his little head off \" Ruhr ruff ruff grrrr!\" \"What is it boy who's over there?\" I asked \"Is it a person?\" \"Ruhr Ruhr,\" \"Is it a squirrely?\" \"Grrrrrrrrrrr\" I took a step forward and the dog walked with me. All of a sudden a giant brown bear reared up and planted it front paws right in front of us. \"Aaaahhhhhhhhhh!\" I screamed trying to run away but my legs were frozen to the ground like a scarf left out on a cold winter night. Oh goodness this is bad very very dog leaped on top of the bear and sunked his claws into the bear's back. The bear slashed out his paw in terror. The dog jumped off and the bear ran away wobbling in terror. \"Thank you doggie, do you have a name?\" \"Ruhr Ruhr,\" the dog replied shaking his beautiful gray head. \"Hum your name will be Luna because your coat is like the moon. Hummmm wait now that we are friends and all, can you help me get out of this my mom will be worried.\" \"Ruhr,\" Luna slumped to the ground. \"Think about it I will talk to you in the morning.\" I crawled back into the cave and laid down on the layers of moss. I stretch my arms out and stared aimlessly at the roof of the cave a trickle of sunshine coming through the wall. I pushed myself up forcing myself to move on. I pulled the branches aside the light burning my eyes. \"Hello Luna have you decided yet.\" \"Ruhr,\" Luna slowly got up and limped down weaving through the trees. I jumped up and ran to catch up. I followed Luna until finally we stepped out of the forest. \"Thank you, now follow me.\" I walked over to the gift shop. \"Hello can I borrow a phone.\" The worker passed the phone. I called my mom and she came to pick me up and brought me home. \"Hey mom, bye mom\" I said running down the steep stairs. \"Wait where are you going. It's breakfast time.\" My mom called from the kitchen. \"Sorry be back in a sec.\" I threw on my coat and ran outside. \"Hey Luna who's a good doggie,\" \"Aaaahhhhhhhh, wolf.\" I heard from behind me the sound bouncing of the acres of land. \"Mom calm down it's just my doggie friend Luna.\" I said leaning up against the house petting Luna's beautiful gray fur. \"No Ashlyn, that's a wolf.\" Mom said staring Luna down. \"WHAT!\" I screamed \" Why did she help me then.\" \"What do you mean 'helped you'.\" \"She is the one who lead me out I was completely clueless, she save my life from a bear, and she's my best friend. But now I realize that well I can do what I want to do, and be who I want to be. I'M FREE!\" \"Okay? So I'm guessing you want to keep her then.\" \"Yeah, but she belongs in the woods.\" \"You know you can adopt her, your brother could use a friend to play with.\" \"Hey!\" I protested \"JK.\" I tossed the toy ball Billy got for his second b-day, over the fencing. Luna ran through the opening. This was the start of a new life, a good life, a happy life.[Chapter 2] sorry this story had nothing to do with into the woods it was a mistake. ","Summary":" Brring!

Œil de biche, longs cheveux fauve, démarche mal assurée… Tout en elle éveille ses instincts de prédateur. Il s'approche d'elle à pas feutrés, et lit dans son regard à quel point elle redoute ceux de son espèce. Mais dans ces yeux voilés par la peur, réside une infime étincelle. Celle de la fascination celle du désir qui embrase son ventre. Il l'aborde en usant d'inoffensives questions, comme il parlerait de la pluie et du beau temps. Autour d'eux, le brouillard esquisse un cadre ouaté au forfait qu'il fomente déjà. La malheureuse lui confie être seule, croyant arborer une marque de courage aussi affutée qu'une épée, et non un aveu de sa faiblesse flagrante. Elle recule quelque peu; il s'avance pour se faufiler dans la brèche. Il effleure son épaule elle frissonne. Il pose sa main sur le haut de son bras, resserre son étreinte. Elle ne fuit plus. Elle n'est plus qu'à quelques centimètres de lui, sa gorge blanche et palpitante prête à être livrée à ses crocs. Il enroule son autre bras autour de sa taille, et elle frémit autant qu'elle gémit. Doux son, promesse de divins plaisirs ! Elle est presque sienne désormais. Son odeur sucrée vient lui aguicher les narines. Dans un instant, il goûtera à son corps. Mais d'un bond, la rétive s'échappe. Il en est autant agacé qu'aiguisé dans son désir. Il aime la chasse, et encore plus lorsque la proie ne tombe pas immédiatement dans ses filets. Cela confère un certain piment au jeu, et démultiplie sa jouissance lorsqu'il vient à bout des obstacles. Voyant sa belle biche tenter de prendre de la distance, il sourit, de ce sourire charmant et carnassier qu'il a appris à maîtriser. La naïve ne sait guère s'y prendre : au lieu de mettre le plus d'espace entre eux, elle reste dans son champ d'attraction, jetant à sa figure de fallacieux arguments aussi solides que des fétus de paille. D'un souffle, il les envoie voler au loin ; détruit toute résistance. Ô délectation que de la sentir contre lui, offerte à tous ses caprices ! Déjà ses lèvres s'entrouvrent sous les siennes, et il la dévore, sans retenue. Elle chancèle, tombe, et il se couche sur elle, se love entre ses bras, se niche au plus profond de ses cuisses. La chasse est finie. Au fond des bois, l'hallali résonne comme un râle de plaisir.[Chapter 2] Elle ne comprend pas, ne comprend plus. Comment en est-elle arrivée là ? Pourquoi ? Et surtout, qui est responsable ? Son premier réflexe est de rejeter la faute sur ces bois, de blâmer ce lieu si étrange qu'il en est sourd à la vie du village, si sombre que le soleil ne s'aventure sous ses frondaisons. Une chose est certaine : cette maudite histoire ne lui serait jamais arrivée au village, ni même au château… Un haut-le cœur la submerge. Sans doute tout cela se serait déroulé aussi au château… Après tout, n'habite-il pas là-bas ? Ah, maudit soit-il ! Maudits soient ses mots de velours qui lui caressèrent l'esprit aussi audacieusement que ses mains le long de son corps. Maudit soit son regard saphir qui l'adouba comme un joyau inaltérable. Qu'ils soient maudits, lui et sa voix chaude qui envoûtèrent son âme ; lui et son étreinte qui lui prirent son corps ; lui et sa lame qui ensemencèrent cette honte au plus profond d'elle ! Naïve fût-elle de croire qu'elle n'en conserverait qu'un exaltant souvenir ! Elle s'est laissé emporter par ces bois, son cœur, son corps, ce Prince, mais elle s'est fourvoyée. La raison lui revient ; les remords aussi. C'est une litanie sans pitié, sans répit : coupable, responsable ! Coupable, porte le blâme ! Coupable, coupable, coupable ! Ses genoux cèdent sous ce poids, et elle s'effondre, terrassée par cette vérité. Elle est autant à incriminer que le Prince. Une part d'elle-même, aveuglée par des fables de grand-mère, a voulu croire aux rêves, en dépit de tout. Elle désirait ce que lui renvoyait le Prince, elle croyait à cette promesse d'évasion. Un instant, elle a fui le joug du quotidien. Un instant, un infime instant de grâce, elle a vécu ce rêve d'insouciance. Mais il ne faut pas croire aux rêves, surtout s'ils sont trop beaux.

The bakers son is called William. This is my first into the woods fanfiction and I am hoping not to make it an one shot. It is a little different to what I am used to (Bechloe) and it creates a bit of a change for my readers too. I was sat in the soft fluffy armchair in the house I had come to call home when he came into the room. 'Ella...' He was crying, he had come to call me Ella rather than Cinderella which was my full name. 'What is it my baker-boo. Is it what happened?' I knew before I even asked, it had been 5 years since his wife had died. I remembered that day all to well, the day I rejected my dream. The day I left a prince. The day I became a Mother, House wife and Baker. I had raised my 'children' well as if they were really my own. Little Red Riding Hood (who eventually told me that her name was Charlotte), Jack and the bakers lovely son, William. A small young boy walked into the room. 'Hello mummy Ella.' He said 'Are you and dad having a chat?' William was an adorable child. He was average height for a five year old, though I knew he would eventually be taller than me. I loved how he called me 'Mummy Ella' rather than Mum as that meant he realised I wasn't his birth mum, and that he didn't call me Ella, and that meant he had accepted me as his 'mother'. I smiled at him. 'Just give us a moment William.' I said. He walked away. I looked at the man crying softly beside me. 'I understand... I know what it's like to loose somebody you love, although lets be honest I had it a whole lot worse. Things that have happened to me always seem to be bad. I mean lets face it we have been through the same but at different times. Both of us...' At this point I was cut off by Charlotte Red (that was my name for her). 'Miss El, I mean Mom Ella. Jack's climbed a tree again and he won't come down.' I sighed 'I will continue this later.' I told the man sat next to me. 'I'm on my way miss Red...' I liked to play with the children in such a way as I did. Having missed so much of my childhood due to horrid step relatives, when I was around children I felt the need to let out the child within my personality. I was a young girl at heart, forced to mature far too quickly by a cruel and unloving family, and despite being 22 now. I followed Little red through the forest to where Jack had climbed a tree, a tree right outside where he apparently used to live with hateful mother. 'Jack would you please like to come down.' No response from the boy 'Jack it's nearly dinner time.' 'I'm not hungry Ella' He said I could hear the tears in his voice. 'Can I come up Jack?' I asked 'Yes just don't bring Charlotte.' I looked round at Charlotte. 'Charlotte. Could you please return to the house and help your father with the bakery.' I really didn't like to sound impolite or to hurt her feelings, but I had to make sure she left if Jack wanted to talk to me. 'Sure. I actually want to show him my secret bread.' She said, then she ran back to the house. She stopped after a short while and turned back to me. I looked at my shoes. Heeled shoes, no thing to wear while tree climbing. 'Yeah, I was just thinking you might want these' Charlotte said walking forward bear footed. I took off my shoes and gave them to her. She gave me hers, it really paid to have a daughter with the same sized feet as me. Carefully I scaled the tree. It actually was quite easy to climb this tree as it lots of thick branches close together, and I quickly reached Jack. Now almost 16 years old Jack was taller than me, and looked older than me to be honest he looked 17 (the same age as me when I took on being a mother to him) and I looked 17 so it looked like we were a couple. Fortunately for our mother/son relationship, not many people who hardly know us came though this part of the wood. I put my arm around the 15 year old. 'What's the matter?' I asked softly. 'As I am nearly 16 I think my mother would be really proud to see me now.' Jack told me. I smiled sadly at him and he smiled back. 'Tonight, come and see me. I'll tell you about my 16th birthday. It wasn't even a event to most people. You are certainly more lucky than me...' he looked at me and then hugged me. 'You wanna race down' he said. 'Yeah sure' I replied 'Down the tree and into the house, 3, 2, 1, Go' and we happily raced down the tree and back to the house. Obviously being a strapping teenage boy he beat me but I didn't mind. With my mismatched family I felt like I could be who I really was, rather than Cinderella, doing all the work while her step family partied all night. I liked to be around people I could relate to and this family was definitely could all relate to each other. We had all been through similar things in our lives, at varying ages and with various outcomes for each person. I had certainly lost so much, My mother, my father, my sibling and my childhood, but I felt like I had my sibling and my childhood back when I was with my 'family'. Thanks for reading please leave a review on your thoughts/opinions. Hope you enjoyed and I will update this again very soon. Lea. 🌈🌈[Chapter 2] This is for me quite good fun actually I might make some more Into the Woods fanfiction at some point although this covers most areas. It was now about 7:00 and I was tucking William up into bed. 'Tell me a story Ella, Tell me a story.' I sighed I knew that would come. 'One day there was two young girls. One was called Ella and the other was called Jessica.' Suddenly Charlotte and Jack turned up. They may both be teens now but they still loved a good story about passed times. The baker decided to join, despite the lack of space in the room. I looked around the full room and continued my story. 'Ella and Jessica were very good friends and Jessica was like a sister to Ella, Ella is me by the way and Jessica was your mother William, it was Jessica's 18th Birthday. I was only about (what?) 7 at the time and she told me she loved somebody she couldn't call her own. I told her she should ask him the one issue was he was two years older than her,that makes him 13 years older than me... That man was your father William. About a year later, once my friend Jessica was 19, they got married. As she was such a darling she let me be one of her bridesmaids. She was so beautiful on her wedding day, she wore a rose pink skirted dress with a white top. I l wished so, so much I could wear that dress on my wedding day, of course back then I wasn't completely aware of what terror would crush my childhood, deprive me of my life and cause what I was told was an accident. And I swear I...' I continued. 'Ella, Ella.' The baker was calling to me. I suddenly was aware that tears were rolling down my face. Fortunately the five year old's eyes were closed he was trying to sleep. 'Sleep softly, Let your head rest upon the grass, Sleep tonight you're not alone, You'll always have someone, Sleep here, sleep now, Close your eyes and dream, Let your mind be free, Sleep for now and you shall see, All that you could be.' Charlotte had the most beautiful voice, and the lullaby was the most soothing I had heard. 'My mom used to sing me that when I was little, just after my father had left...' I cried a little more, for five years I had been the strong one keeping my past locked behind me. Now I have to let everything out, both emotionally and with the story of my past. We left the now sleeping 5 year old in the other room and went back into the main room. I started crying more than before. 'If you ever want to talk about anything...' My Baker Boy said. 'Yeah I'd be happy to talk to you about it.' Charlotte agreed. 'Me too' Jack joined 'Technically you would be 'me three' you know' Replied Charlotte 'I don't care.' 'Well you should.' 'Well I don't' 'Oh well that's just great then.' 'Yeah it is.' 'I don't care about tree climbing then' 'Ahhhhhhhhh' Screamed Jack and ran at Charlotte. Charlotte slapped him across the face, Jack aimed a punch at Charlotte's face. 'No' The baker yelled and grabbed Jack pulling him back, I could see Jack struggling I only had a matter of seconds before Charlotte reacted. 'Well what are you waiting for?' The baker yelled at me. I raced round Jack and the baker, as I did so I reached out, stopping to grab her, and pull her back towards the wall. When they were little, and they would fight we would just grab which ever one we were nearest to and drag them out through the nearest doors to talk to them. Now I could no longer hold back Jack, he was bigger and stronger than me so it was safer for me to get hold of Charlotte and the Baker to grab Jack. So Sorry about this chapter's length, but it had to be done, I have had quite a busy time recently and have spent a lot of it on my new Bechloe fanfiction (check it out if you haven't). Also I have some help on this fanfic and other into the woods one I am writing from my friend Kate so thanks to you or this fanfic wouldn't have happened.

Three years ago, my inability to look someone in the eye and quick blush was awarded with \"aw\" and \"oh how cute\". Now, it's as though I'm some kind of leper, the very dregs of society because I have trouble speaking my mind or joining in on conversations. It's as though my social skills- or, rather, lack thereof- define me as some weird, psycho Goth girl who spends her weekends communicating with dead relatives with my trusty Ouija board or conspiring with Sadako from The Ring to haunt innocent high school girls. You know, and the fact that God gifted me with raven black hair, abnormally pale skin, and incredibly light blue eyes that went from cool to disgust-o within a matter of month. And my last name being LeStrange doesn't exactly help my image. So, there you go; that's me, the faux Ghost Whisperer, Zoe LeStrange, or Zoe the Strange as I am referred to by the less ghostly-looking and more social girls at my high school. I am, in my opinion, more or less your average freshman high school girl; I want a group of best friends to swoon over guys with, some kind of activity to occupy my free time, and, of course, some ah-mazing heartthrob to have as a boyfriend. Is that most likely impossible for me to achieve in my current state? Yep. Will my first year of high school probably be worse than Hell Week at the Citadel? Of course. But, the optimistic little chatterbox that I am, I've decided that this year is my year; I will have a good freshman year and nothing will stop me. \"Zoe the Strange,\" I whisper to my dark room the night before my first day. \"You're something real special; now, you just got to show the rest of the world that.\" My eyes flutter shut, a small smile on my lips, and I dream of a perfect high school life. \"'You took your time with the call, I took my time with the fall!'\" I jolt upright in bed, shocked from my slumber by Carly Rae Jepsen's hit-o'-the-summer I queued up in my iPod the night before. My heart eventually settles back into its usual rhythm and I stumble out of my room and into the bathroom. \"Damn it, Zo; hurry up!\" Kyle, my little brother, whines from outside the door. \"I'm almost done.\" I carefully slip the hair pin just above my ear, smiling at how bouncy and graceful my curly hair decided to be this morning. \"There. Perfection.\" I allow myself one more moment of self-appreciation before letting Kyle in. \"Way to look like a total zomb, Frodo Bag gins!\" he squawks, chuckling at his own lame joke. \"Screw you, midge.\" I return in an overly cheerful voice. \"Get out now, or you get to witness me taking my morning dump.\" He replies, already pulling down his boxers. \"Ew, Jesus; I'm going, you little perv!\" I slam the bathroom shut behind me. \"Kyle is being soooooo lame!\" I fume to Sven, my adorable Bischon puppy. Sven barks back adorably, his little tail wagging so hard his little butt is wiggling. \"I know, I know; I can't let it get to me. You're right, Sven.\" I pat his furry white head affectionately. \"Time to get dressed.\" Saint Michael's Catholic High School is an institution of learning for the best, brightest, and richest; I'd received a half scholarship from a writing contest, and my mom could swing the other half. The mandatory uniform (for girls) is comprised of a pleated blue skirt and a white blouse. The shoes have to be brown or black, preferably leather; socks must by white or navy high knee socks or navy blue, gray, or black tights (without any holes or tears). Allowed sweaters/jackets include: a plain navy blue sweater, a sports club sweatshirt, other St. Michael sweatshirts (purchased from their online store, of course), or the navy blue blazer which is required for the boys with the school emblem on the left side. Navy blue sweater vests are also acceptable. I pull my socks all the way up, adjust my skirt so it's exactly three inches above the knee (as specified by the dress code), and stick my feet into my new, shiny, black Mary Janes. \"Perfect.\" The clock says I still have thirty minutes left before mom will be ready to drop me off, so I apply some of my newly acquired mascara and Ruby Red lip gloss with a steady hand. Usually, I'd wait until after I force down a few spoonfuls of Cinnamon Toast Crunch, which was my favorite breakfast cereal since birth, but today I'm way too nervous to even attempt eating anything. \"Time to go, love-y dove-ys,\" Mom shouts from down stairs. \"Coming!\" Kyle and I yell, tousling with each other as we scramble to the car, flinging our newly purchased book bags over our shoulders. Kendal, my baby brother, is already buckled into his car seat, snoring adorably, his little blond head lolling to the side. \"You have your house key, Zo?\" Mom inquires, maneuvering the dark green minivan out of our practically nonexistent driveway. \"'Course.\" I reply, dangling my wallet in front of her face, my keys hanging from the zippered pocket. \"Good. You got your lunch money?\" After a round of twenty questions with mom about what I remembered to pack, we reach the drop off for St. Michael's. Students in uniforms identical to mine shuffle across the front lawn, waving greetings to friends, yelling cat-calls, seeming like perfectly normal high school students. I smile to myself; this year won't be a problem at all. I hop out of the passenger's side, give mom a little smile and a half-wave, and begin walking to the entrance, taking a leisurely pace. St. Michael's is a pretty imposing place actually; the front doors are made of expensive doors with bronze handles, held open by some very heavy looking encyclopedias with a set of grand stone steps leading up to them. The front hall has a vaulted ceiling with floor-to-ceiling trophy shelves lining the walls, filled with shiny plaques and ornate trophies for every sport, academic competition, or best-school-of-the-year awards. The floors are sparkling and there are benches at regular intervals with little plaques proclaiming which successful alumni donated it. Off the main hallway is the gym (state of the art scoreboard, new basketball hoops, and a mural of the mascot, St. Michael the Archangel with a Greek toga, laurel wreath, angel wings, and a flaming sword, painted on the wall) and the locker rooms (freshly-cleaned showers with non-mildew-y plastic curtains and six bathroom stalls, two of them handicap accessible). About half way down are two more hallways, one leading to the Fine Arts wing (art studio, performing arts center, etc.), the other leading to wrestling rooms, weight rooms, and the like. Then, at the end of the main hallway, there's a flight of stairs leading to the second floor, where the freshman and sophomore lockers, along with the Theology, History, and English classrooms are. There's a raised walkway leading between the second floors of the A building and the B building. B building second floor is the junior and senior lockers and Science, Math, and Foreign Language classrooms; the first floor is the cafeteria, front office, and empty classrooms used for Study Hall. There's a courtyard between the A building and B building first floors ringed by tall hedges with a fountain in the middle (aka prime seating for the popular kids). Sports fields, a football stadium, and the building that houses the indoor pool/track make up the rest of the campus. Not including the extensive parking lot behind the school. I find my locker fast enough, getting my locker shelf in on the first try, and neatly stacking my books and binders inside. The excessive organization won't last for long , I sigh inwardly. I may seem well put together, but I'm an innate slob. It's a worst affliction than being shy. A girl with red hair styled in a pixie cut clumps over to me, somehow staying upright in her Wallabies. \"You're locker 2506?\" she inquires, a no nonsense expression on her face and a hand on her hip. \"Y-yes.\" I stammer, my heart pounding in my chest. This girl may seem tiny- almost like a little fairy-, but she's quite intimidating. Her stern expression melts into a pretty smile. \"Cool; I guess that makes us locker buddies.\" She gestured to the locker beneath mine. \"Oh.\" Wow. I'm just amazed by my conversational skills right now; quite an eloquent response, eh? I grimace slightly. \"I'm Lil, by the way.\" She sticks her hand out, expecting a handshake. \"I'm, uh, Zoe.\" Dumb much? I sound like I'm freaking unsure of my own name! \"Zoe LeStrange.\" I say in a much more sure voice. \"LeStrange? Cool; I'm Lester.\" Her face changes to a slightly pained expression. \"A truly crap name for an aspiring actress, but Fate is cruel.\" Drama-rama alert; steer clear! I decide my inner voice needs to take a break, so I focus on examining her as she chatters cheerfully, expecting only well-placed nods and \"mm-hm\" noises to keep her assured I'm listening. Her face is slim and she has petite features, except for her big, Bambi-esque, gray eyes; her ears are slightly pointed at the tips, but not noticeably so. She's an inch or two shorter than me, and she has nice, slim curves; although, her torso is pretty much swallowed up by the oversized navy blue sweater vest she's wearing. A bell rings somewhere in the distance and, suddenly, everyone's rushing to their respective homeroom; Lil and I meander to Room 204, home of Mr. Snow, aka Mr. Snore , as cleverly dubbed by some popular senior a decade or so back. He's asleep at his desk when we take our seats. \"Schedule?\" Lil holds out her hand expectantly. I pass her the crumbled paper, wincing slightly at her only slightly creased schedule. \"We have… hm, bio and history together. Not so bad; could be worse.\" She shrugs, giving me a what-can-ya-do smile. \"Yeah.\" I nod in agreement. Thankfully, I'm saved from anymore awkward attempts at conversing on my part by the announcements. \"Welcome back, students! We all hope you had a terrific summer, and are ready to have a SUPER school year!\" the woman, probably the fifty-something-year-old secretary from the principal's office, enthuses. \"All freshman and new students are to report to the performing arts center right after homeroom; afterwards, you are to report to your third period classes.\" The rest of the announcements sound strangely like advertisements for the various clubs; photography and Writers Anonymous sound interesting. Finally, homeroom ends with the Pledge of Allegiance and a prayer. Lil and I make small talk about our summers as we're pushed by the wave of other freshmen to the auditorium; we find seats next to each other, and Lil nervously chips at her silver nail polish as we wait. The principal, an imposing man who vaguely resembles a college linebacker, makes a long, rambling speech about new beginnings; the disciplinarian, \"call me Ms. Vicky\" she told us with a conspirator's wink, yammers on about following rules and the \"imminent consequences of insubordination\". The guidance counselors nervously fidget as they talk about making appointments to plan courses, talk about college, or \"just to hang\". Then, eventually, we're allowed to vacate. \"Welcome, welcome!\" Mrs. Dare, my Honors English teacher, greets us as we file into her classroom. \"Sit wherever you want; we'll get seating arrangements sorted out at some point.\" She gestures to the circle of beanbag chairs on the ugly purple shag carpeting. I duck my head down, and claim a cushy green one with a nice view out the window and of the clock. Slowly, the room starts to fill up, all the seats occupied except for the one to my right. The late bell rings. \"Shit!\" a guy, who runs in at the last possible moment, grunts as he bends over trying to catch his breath. \"Sorry, Mrs. D. I got caught up with somethin'.\" The boy runs a hand through his messy black hair. Mrs. Dare sighs with extra gusto, pointing to the chair beside me. \"Yes, yes, Sam. Please be seated.\" The boy- Sam- flashes a dazzling smile at her and plops down beside me. \"Hey.\" He nods when he notices me watching him. My face turns a new shade of red and I mutter a quick \"hi\" before directing my attention elsewhere. Sam chuckles softly. \"Now, we'll go around the circle and introduce ourselves. I don't want just names or nicknames or whatever you call what you kids go by nowadays; I want you to include an interesting fact about yourself. Something we'd never guess about you.\" A pretty blond, Tammy, starts off. \"I'm Tammy, short for Tamara, and I know origami.\" Slowly, everyone introduces themselves, and then, quicker than I can formulate a fact, it's my turn. \"Um.\" Come on, Zo; you can do it! Screw them, screw everyone. You're who you are and, if they can't handle that, it's their problem. \"I'm Zoe, short for Zoe the Strange,\" the cruel nickname rolls of my tongue easily and I suddenly feel more confident. That's who I am; I'm Zoe the Strange. A small smile appears on my lips. \"And I guess a weird fact about me- er, whatever- is that I was born while my mom was on a business trip to Tokyo, and I have dual citizenship.\" The introductions keep going, but I feel… well, less timid. More like someone who would fit the nickname. Sam's fact is that he's a huge fan of Asian horror movies; he flashes me a slightly cocky grin when he says it and my cheeks are suddenly on fire again. \"Alright; now that that's over with.\" Mrs. Dare smiles wickedly. Uh-oh. \"I'll be splitting you all into pairs for your first assignment; we'll be working on this for the entire first quarter.\" What?! Not cool! \"I want you all to pick a book; and I mean a real, honest-to-God book, no Twilight vampire teen fiction. Do a project on it; a paper, a movie, a series of drawings, a reenactment of a scene, whatever. Just make it good.\" Her brown eyes sparkle with untold evil behind those old lady glasses. Damn it! Way to discriminate against shy people. Even my inner insults are falling flat. \"Okay, pairs are…\" she begins to rattle off names. \"And, finally, dearest Samuel and The Strange.\" No. Just no. \"And, before anyone asks,\" she directs me with a sympathetic look. \"You're stuck with your partner. No switching. My apologies.\" The malicious glint in her eyes proves the last statement false. I examine the other pairs. A cheerleader and a Goth girl (her hair is black with red streaks and about five pounds of makeup around her eyes), a nerd and a buff jock, a Queen Bee and a boy who's obviously overly-dramatic. Not exactly pairings made with the students' comfort in mind. Which, of course, is the point; she wants to force us out of our comfort zones, see how far we'll go to get a good grade. We have to get along or fail. Class ends just as Sam is about to say something, and I'm already halfway out the door by the time he stands up. Ugh, that was beyond rude. But, I continue to rush down the hallway, making it to History within a minute. \"Hey, Zoe.\" Lil smiles at me, a fresh coat of bright red lipstick on her lips. \"Hi, Lil.\" I reply as we collapse into two seats in the back. \"So, what'd you just have?\" She smiles genuinely at me. \"English. Mrs. Dare is… interesting?\" I shrug. Lil watches me, waiting for me to explain. \"Well, she split us up into pairs and we have to do some type of project on a book. Which wouldn't be so bad, you know, if it weren't in pairs ; I just hate having to rely on someone else for a good grade.\" I sigh. \"That sucks. I heard Mrs. Dare is kind of a bitch.\" Lil and I chat about her drama class- \"it was ah-mazing! I think it's gonna be great!\"- until History starts. And, guess who takes the seat in front of me? No, go ahead; take a guess. Think messy black hair and English class. Yup, you got it. Sam. \"Hey, Little V.\" he nods at Lil. I give her a wide-eyed look. \"No, it's not about that; it's short for Little Vicky.\" She chuckles at me scandalized expression. \"Oh. Good.\" My face is probably a new shade of red. \"This is my friend, Sammy; Sammy, this is my locker buddy, Zoe.\" Lil introduces us. \"We already met.\" Sam announces, loudly enough for Mr. Patterson to turn around and shoot us a glare. \"Mr. Fredericks, I implore you to at least attempt to be a bit quieter when you're flirting during my class.\" \"Aye, aye, cap'n.\" Sam gives him a mock salute, turning right back around when Mr. Patterson goes back to scribbling things on the board in his illegible scrawl. \"Zoe's my partner in English.\" Sam winks at me as though we share some kind of secret just because we're in the same English class. \"Ah, now I understand why Zoe's worried about her grade.\" Lil nods. \"Ah, that hurts, Zoe the Strange; it hurts right here.\" He points at his heart. He said my nickname. It doesn't sound mean or cruel when he says it; it sounds almost… affectionate. Lil and Sam continue their banter throughout class, eliciting an abundance of glares from Mr. P. \"Lunch time!\" Lil and Sam shout at the end of the period, grinning like maniacs. \"Um, what's so great about that? It's just lunch.\" I comment. Lil and Sam are dragging me through the packed hallways, going straight for the front door. \"Just lunch? That's practically blasphemy!\" Lil exclaims, throwing the front door open and skipping across the front lawn. \"My mom's the superintendant, so me and my friends get exclusive access to the sports fields at lunch.\" Sam shrugs. \"We used to come over here during lunch period at the middle school.\" He nods at the nearly identical building that holds St. Michael's Middle/Elementary School that's separated by a wall of hedges. \"Cool.\" I reply, tucking an errant strand of hair behind my ear. \"Double piercings? I didn't take you for the type.\" Lil remarks after we all get comfortable under a grand oak tree by the soccer field. \"What type did you think I was?\" I steal a chip from the big bag of Ruffles Sam had swiped from Mr. Snow's secret stash. \"Um, I dunno; the quiet nerd? The shy backstabber? Or maybe the closet religious nut?\" She doesn't seem to notice my embarrassment at her answer, or at least decides it isn't worth apologizing for. \"I can only agree with the first one.\" Sam adds. \"But, if you are the quiet nerd, you're pretty cool for one.\" My cheeks burn, but I attempt to conceal it by stealing a handful of chips. Lil and Sam trade insults, periodically discussing classes or clubs, until we hear the distant sound of the lunch bell. Lil gallops off, leaving Sam and me in the dust to get a good seat in Theology class. \"What have you got next?\" He asks as I drape my messenger back over one shoulder. \"Um, Spanish, I think; you?\" \"Same. Let's walk together.\" Sam suggests this casually, oblivious to the fact that I'm suddenly anxious. Lil's easy to talk to, but being able to converse regularly with the opposite gender is not an expectation I've set yet. \"'Kay.\" I squeak. The first few minutes pass in awkward silence. \"So, you and Lil go pretty far back, right?\" Good job! You got this, girlie! My thought process was starting to sound a lot like my stepdad's ex-wife, who happens to be a life coach. \"Yeah; we've been best friends since birth practically. She can be kind of oblivious about what she says, but she's a pretty nice kid, all things considered.\" I nod, fiddling with my key chain. \"You have any brothers or sisters?\" he inquires suddenly. \"Yeah, one brother, one sister; you?\" We swap stories about stupid things our brothers have done (he has four, all older) and the rest of the walk to Spanish passes quickly. \"Your stop, milady.\" He sweeps an overdramatic bow. \"Isn't this your class too?\" I must look really confused because he laughs. \"Nah; I'm in the stupid kids' class. You have bio next, right? I'll meet you here and we can walk together.\" Sam flashes one last smile, and then dashes down the hall towards his own class. I'm not very early, so I get stuck with a seat in the front row, but, honestly, I'm not at all upset about it; walking with Sam was more than worth it. I spend most of the class thinking about Sam; I can feel the beginnings of a crush forming. Oh, come on; who're you trying to delude? It's not the \"beginnings\" you've already got a crush. Damn. Thought process is right. Thank you; of course I am. Damn smug inner voice. Sam is cute though; heart-throbbingly so. His messy black hair is always falling in his pretty green eyes with those unbelievably long lashes; he has one of those I-know-I'm-hot smiles that make you want to see more if it. He has nice, classic features; clean cut jaw, nice cheekbones. He's taller than me and looks pretty muscular, but not too much so. So, I have my heartthrob, now I've just got to get him to like me back. \"Want to hang with us at the Fro-Yo Palace?\" Lil offers. It's Friday of the first week, and Lil and I have become fast friends; she's spent the past three days at my house after school, leaving really late. \"Definitely.\" I've come out of my shell around Lil and Sam; I can keep up polite small talk with Bobby and Hailstorm, two of Sam's friends. Hailstorm is a pretty blond metal head who wears clip-on black and blue extensions and writes song lyrics up her arms in Sharpie; Bobby is the Goth from our English class who's actually the star of the baseball team. \"Cool.\" Lil slams her locker shut, flashing me a smile. \"Week one has been conquered.\" She makes a little checkmark in the air with her finger. \"Hey, kiddies.\" Sam, Hailstorm, and Bobby appear beside us. \"Who you callin' kiddies, toad?\" Lil shot back. Hailstorm rolls her eyes. \"Stop it, love birds; this is gonna make me lose my appetite.\" Lil's face flushes and she flashes Hailstorm a glare. \"Dumbass.\" She finally mutters, grabbing my arm and leading me in front of the other three who share a good laugh. Lil's still fuming when we reach Fro-Yo Palace. \"Oh, hell no.\" Bobby growls. Hailstorm sees my shock and lets out a long sigh. \"The Royalty's sitting at our table.\" She points to a corner booth with cracked leather seats that are supposed to seem retro and not ugly. Brianna, Brooke, and Brenda (the Triple B's, aka the captain and co-captains of the cheerleaders, although I heard Brenda's real name is Catherine) and Mattie (the quarterback) and two other jock straps occupy the table; all of whom are guffawing about something Mattie said. Hailstorm marches over, glowering over Brooke, and the other three soon follow, me grudgingly dragged by Lil. \"'Scuse me, but this is our table.\" Hailstorm hisses. \"Oh, really? I don't see 'Table Exclusively for Sluts and Co.' written anywhere here.\" Brianna retorts, earning another round of chortles. \"Well, then that's just proof that it's not yours.\" Lil shrieks. Brooke looks past the others and straight at me. \"Aw, you even brought along your little charity case. How sweet.\" Lil opens her mouth to snap something back. I am Zoe the Strange , I think. What would a freak like me do at a time like this? \"Fine; you can have the table. I guess it's only fair to let you have your fun now before your life spirals into the depths of crappiness when you reach your twenties, already previously being knocked up by one of your brain dead cronies,\" I gesture to the football players. \"You do know that in about ten years you'll have three kids you hate, an ugly husband with a beer gut who's a wuss even when he's drunk, and you'll be stuck wishing you weren't such a bitch during high school so that you would have actual friends to vent to instead of hairdressers who you pay outrageous wads of cash to because you've got no other way to whine about how you used to be an ah-mazing cheerleader with the absolute hawt-est boyfriend.\" Wow. I think that's the most I've said since my science presentation in seventh grade. \"Well, at least she's not a loser slut-whore!\" Brianna croaks. \"You mean a loser slut-whore who will most likely earn more money in one year than you will in your entire sorry life? Hm, that's definitely a way worse thing to be.\" My voice is dripping with sarcasm. \"How 'bout you do yourselves a favor and just give up the goddamn table? I can formulate more intellectual insults than you could ever wish to and I'd rather not be stuck listening to you sputter meaningless curse words about me when I could be eating some frozen yogurt. Or, do I need to give more of you predictions about your sad, sad future?\" Holy shit. I just said that. Who AM I? But, to my surprise, they give up the table, snarling a few insults as they pass. \"Holy shit.\" Hailstorm breathes. \"You're way more badass than I thought.\" So, we sit down and eat our yogurt and I decide being a badass seems like a very nice thing to be.

First she is forgotten, while napping on her friend's bed. The second and third time occur on the same night. It's her RA's birthday. There are seven people going, but there is only room for six people. The girl ends up in the trunk. They arrive at the restaurant and everyone is going in…except the girl is forgotten. Most of them are in the restaurant by the time she starts yelling. Finally, one of them hears her and tells the owner of the car to open the trunk. The evening proceeds to be \"fun.\" As the party comes to a close, they go back to the dorms. Again, everyone begins to leave her. They crack up laughing because they can't believe that she was forgotten yet again in the span of just a few hours. Her presence seems to go unnoticed. Slowly, they only come to see where her roommate is or for help. There is no more \"friend\" status at this point. She is just the person that is merely there. The one that they acknowledge, but deem as a child not good enough to hang out with them even though she is just as old as they are. She isn't even the baby of the group, but her stature makes her seem childlike. Recently, she has begun to stop talking to them and started finding places to hide. The worst of it all is that she has recently begun to \"cut\" herself. She takes a plastic knife and makes light marks on her skin because she doesn't want anyone to notice. The pain doesn't seem to go away. She wonders if she should just take the next big step and just take her life away. Before you begin to say she should talk to someone, she has. She told her RA that she hates being forgotten, but she said it's fine. She explains that she gets to see things from a different perspective. How is this supposed to help this girl?

A nice girl. A smart girl. A Christian girl. So why was she having so very un-Christian thoughts? God didn't want her to feel this way… did He? It was always the girl with the red hair that made her feel this way. Nine classes together since kindergarten. Marianne knew very little about her— just that her name was Olympe or Olivia or something, she was adopted along with two other boys, and that she was very, very sarcastic. Unlike Marianne, who was always giving out advice and cheerful to the point of being annoying, the girl with the red hair was always prepared to offer a snarky comment with a roll of the eyes. Marianne was always surrounded by Nina, Micah, and her friends. The girl with the red hair always seemed to be alone, except for maybe Rhiannon. Marianne cared about what God wanted her to do and whether she'd go to Heaven or Hell. The girl with the red hair… didn't care at all. She even went to that \"Religions of Other Cultures\" class! Indeed, the girl with the red hair was the kind that Daddy always warned Marianne to stay away from. Marianne's exact opposite. The kind that Marianne would never dream of associating with. And yet… that was what made her so fascinating. From the moment she and the girl with the red hair sat next to each other during seventh grade history, Marianne wanted to know more about her. She glanced at the top her paper, and saw that she had written \"Olive Penderghast\" in the space for her name. Olive Penderghast. Lovely name , Marianne thought. But Olive was always the girl with the red hair to her. Throughout the years since then, Marianne began growing more and more interested in the girl with the red hair. Yet it seemed like the more she knew about her, the less Marianne understood her. Still, that was what made her so fascinating. Nina had always been easy to understand, an open book. This girl, however, didn't reveal anything to anyone. Not even Rhiannon knew Olive's secrets. What confused— and even scared— Marianne the most was the fact that she was beginning to feel something resembling attraction her. This wasn't how she was meant to be. She was meant to be with Micah. Or with another boy. But not a girl, and not a girl like this. Perhaps, Marianne reasoned later on, this was why she was so obsessed with \"saving\" the girl with the red hair. Maybe if she saved the girl, she could also save herself. This is a bit of a \"Wild Mass Guessing\" fic. I have a theory that Marianne is gay or bi with a crush on Olive, and that her boyfriend, Micah, is just a cover. I mean, come on. She sniffs Olive's hair. Marianne setting off my gaydar like crazy aside, I also apologize for using the phrase \"the girl with the red hair\" a lot, but I, like Olive, found it odd that Marianne had to ask Olive what her name was after if they'd been in the same class for such a long time. I hope you enjoyed, and I hope you review. ~ Cookie VanDeKamp ~ ","Summary":" Marianne liked to think of herself as a good girl. A nice girl. A smart girl. A Christian girl.

Not a football jock, but more of a smart guy. Not nerdy with glasses and spoke in Star Trek like technobabble, but just an ordinary guy. Good looking, easy to get along with, the perfect man. Rhi spoke to him for a while. They will go out soon if Rhi would have the courage to ask him. But being the eccentric Rhi, she had to do something stupid instead. Yes, I got involved. We were in the cafeteria and Rhi had been quiet all morning. When Rhi was quiet, you can tell she was planning something. That would always scare me. I despise talkative people as much as anybody, but in the case of Rhi, I wish she were talkative forever. We sat down with our lunches and I was waiting for that Rhi plan to come out of her mouth. I didn't have to wait long. \"I wanna do something to impress Grant,\" she said. I sighed and said \"What is it?\" \"I wanna make a home movie for him and I want you to help me make it,\" said Rhi. \"What is it? A re-enactment of his favourite movie?\" I asked, hopefully. Seriously, I was starting to get nervous. I always do when Rhi comes up with a plan. \"No,\" said Rhi with a crafty grin that said \"I'm going to do something naughty and you're going to get involved whether you like it or not.\" She leaned over to me and said \"It's called 'How To Cover Up Someone's Naughty Parts'.\" That's it! There was that Rhi-ism right there! She wants to make a home movie called \"How To Cover Someone's Naughty Parts\"! I asked her what we were going to do in this movie. She answered \"I'm going to get naked and you're going to cover up my parts using objects.\" And this is the part where I'm shocked and say \"Seriously.\" I did and Rhi gave the typical answer \"I'm dead serious.\" \"You're willing to get naked on camera?\" I asked. \"Why else do you think I kept going to that tanning salon?\" said Rhi. I have to admit, Rhi does have the body of either a supermodel or an athlete. She works out a lot and watches her diet. For all I know, she either wants take up modelling or sports as a career. Or maybe a body double for movie stars. When we're in the locker room, I would always stare at either the lockers, the floor or the ceiling. Because once Rhi took her clothes off, she would never put them back on again. She would stand in front of you with her privates parts right there for you to see. I have to look at Rhi in the eye when talking to her. It was like her way of saying \"I have a better body than you and I will pester you with it.\" Even the other girls would look at her with a hint of jealousy in them. Even the coach couldn't stop staring at her. And she's got a point. There is nothing more gross in this world than icky tan lines. It's like that scene in The Graduate when Mrs Robinson's naked and she is all covered in tan lines. Ew. No wonder Benjamin wanted to get the hell out of there. \"What are you going to do with this movie?\" I asked. \"Post it on Youtube and have teenage boys jerk off to you?\" We had to keep out voices down, by the way. \"No,\" answered Rhi. \"We're going to film it and I'll put it on a DVD and give it to Grant for his own viewing pleasure.\" I gave Rhi a dirty look that said \"I am not going to help make this movie in any way shape or form.\" But Rhi always had a back up plan to seduce me to the dark side of the Force. \"Remember those PlayStation 1 games you were eyeing up in that store?\" said Rhi. Oh no, my Achilles' heel. I am a huge old school gamer. Big time. \"You couldn't afford them. I can get them for you,\" she said looking at her finger nails like a drug dealer. A part of me went Let's see if Rhi would be able to actually do this. You'll get those games and you'll have a story to tell. I looked at her and said \"Okay, Rhi. I'll help you make this movie.\" Rhi smiled and told me to come over to her house at 7 O'Clock tonight. . . . . . . That evening I arrived over at Rhi's house and I met her odd, but friendly parents. Well, they had their clothes on this time. I went outside to their garden and Rhi was in a bath robe. Her mom was setting up the camcorder on the tripod. She got the camera from her cousin who shoots weddings. Also in the garden was a couch, big lights and table full of objects like a magazine, a tea cup, a fan, beach balls and other things. Rhi's mom had done her daughter's make up and her hair. I couldn't believe a couple would actually help their own daughter make a video where she gets naked. After Rhi had her make up done, it was my turn. I was so nervous and I couldn't stop shaking. And I'm the one with her clothes on . After I got finished, I sat down on the sofa and got into shot. Rhi stood behind me and dropped the robe revealing her natural beauty. Her parents exclaimed \"Oh honey, you're so beautiful.\" Me, I was thinking Let's get on with this! Rhi's dad turned on the camera. He kept saying \"Is it on? Is it recording? Did I press record?\" like any parent would. So we had to start again. We filmed the first scene where Rhi is down behind the sofa and she stood up. I'm sitting pretending to read a magazine whilst my head was covering her vag. Rhi's hair was covering her breasts. Rhi was moving left and right behind the couch and I had to move my head left and right to follow her. We did it about 5 times and it went very well. Rhi's mom directed us and she actually knew about timing. She came from an acting background and her father was a stage actor. He taught her all about acting and comic timing. For the next scene, the camera was at the left side of the couch. Rhi wanted to do a scene where she was in the background and I was in the foreground leaning to get a cup of tea. My arm and the teacup were covering her butt and her... y'know. In the background Rhi was dancing in a sensual way and being flirtatious. The next scene, the camera was in front of the couch again and I had to sit at the end of the right side with a fan at the ready. Rhi had to come out from the side of the couch and I had to use my fan to... well, you know. Then we filmed another scene where I had two beach balls. You can guess what they were covering. We filmed even more crazy outrageous stuff. I was actually having fun and I actually admired Rhi for being so brave. I don't know who had more fun, her or me. So, we wrapped about 10.30. Rhi gave me a big hug and said that she would get me those games next week. I said thanks and went home. You know that feeling that you get when you accomplished something incredible? I was like that. It was a great feeling and it was all thanks to my crazy, crazy friend. . . . . . The next morning at school, Rhi and I met up with Grant, and Rhi seductively gave him the DVD of our movie on it. \"I think you'll like this a lot,\" she said giving him a flirtatious look on her face. Grant grinned and replied \"I think I will.\" That morning, the school had to go to the gymnasium. The staff had to show us a really boring documentary about the history of our school. It was on TV but no-one cared to watch it. So, one of the teachers recorded it and put it on a DVD. The DVD player had a cable connected to a projector and it was going to shine on a big white screen. Rhi and I were sitting next to each other. \"Wake me up when this is over,\" said Rhi as she snuggled beside me and closed her eyes. The lights went down and the projector started. 10 seconds later, I yelped \"Rhi! Rhi!\" \"Oh, is the documentary over already? That was fast,\" said Rhi. But then she saw why I woke her up so quickly. On the screen, there was a title card that said \"How To Cover Someone's Naughty Parts\". I looked at the screen in horror as I heard people around me saying \"What is this? How to cover up someone's...?\" Grant was charge of the putting the DVD into the player. He had meant to put the DVD with the documentary on it, but he accidentally put our DVD on instead! Then we appeared on-screen and the whole school saw the naked Rhi. People were saying \"Is that Rhi? Is she naked? Who told them to do this?\" Then people started to either wolf whistle or laugh in shock. Then more people joined in. I just wanted the floor to give way, so that I would fall into a big, deep hole. Or an alien invasion to happen. Or our school to explode. Or the Apocalypse to begin. Or Godzilla attacking our school. Or a terrorist attack. Anything. Anything would nice. Except this. All the students were looking at me and Rhi. They just laughed in our faces. I just went white and sank in my chair. I felt like I was going to vomit. \"TURN THAT OFF!\" yelled the Principal. The lights came on and the DVD player and projector got turned off by Grant. Everyone was all staring at Rhi and I. The students all said \"Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhh.\" \"SHUT UP ALL OF YOU!\" shouted the Principal. As those eyes glared at us, my heart was pounding and my palms and armpits were pouring with sweat. My back was hot and my heart was pounding. Marianne and her obnoxious religious group gave us those shit eating grins. Grant gave us an \"I'm really sorry\" look and Todd and Brandon looked at me. Their looks said \"No matter what happens, I'm still your friend.\" The Principal looked at Rhi and I and bellowed \"YOU TWO, MY OFFICE! NOW!\" As Rhi and I got up, left our seats and walked out of the gymnasium, we could hear the students tittering and muttering to each other. It was as if Rhi and I were on our way to get executed. . . . . . Rhi and I got sent to the Principal's office and he was all fire and brimstone. Never had I ever been shouted at by someone this angry. He accused us of making porn and 'clouding the students' minds with unholy thoughts'. Did I mention this guy was single? Then he said the words of doom: \"As if this day, you are both expelled.\" A lightening bolt went down my spine and I could hear only silence. My eyes filled up with water and my lip quivered. But I tried with all my might not to cry. \"Sir, could I tell you why I did this?\" asked Rhi. \"Go on,\" said The Principal. Rhi told the Principal the story. All truthfully. Very rarely had I ever seen Rhi be so serious about anything. At the end of her story, she said \"Sir, it was my idea. I only asked Olive to help me make the video. You can expel me, but please, sir. Don't expel Olive.\" The Principal looked at us and said \"All right. I'll just give you 3 months detention then.\" We both sighed with relief. We all know Rhi is a bitch, but she is honest. She knows when to do the right thing. She would know when to take the blame and never blame her problem that she caused on another person. \"Thank you,\" I whispered to her. \"Anytime, ho,\" she replied. The principal called both our parents and let them know what happened. Of course Rhi's parents knew about this, but my parents didn't. We all know my parents are the most laid back people in the world. Well, they were very disappointed in me. My punishment was that I wasn't allowed on the internet for a month. . . . . . The next day, Grant met up with Rhi and I and said that he enjoyed the video. He apologized once again for putting it on that projector by accident. He even asked Rhi out eventually. Rhi accepted. Well, she got what she wanted. And also, Grant gave Rhi a photo of himself. A naked photo. Let's just say Rhi cherished this. And I got my PS1 games. At least I got to revisit my childhood. Even though the thing I did to get them got me into trouble. For the next three months, Rhi and I spent our detentions cleaning rooms, putting books in the right order, picking up garbage, washing windows, etc. During one of our detentions, Mrs Leigh, the art teacher found us in the science room and talked about the video we made. She said to Rhi that she was looking for a life model and was wondering would Rhi be interested. Rhi being the horny bitch she is, accepted without hesitation. Mrs Leigh looked at me and said \"And Olive, you looked so beautiful in that video.\" \"Oh, thanks,\" I said. That made me really happy. That afternoon when I was walking home, Todd came up to me and talked endlessly about the video. I told him my crazy story. Todd said to me \"You looked so beautiful in that video. I couldn't stop staring at you.\" \"Funny, that's what Mrs Leigh said,\" I chuckled. \"Well, that's what a lot of the students were saying about you,\" said Todd. \"The football team is crazy about you. Even the girls can't stop admiring you.\" \"Huh!\" I said. \"I definitely have preference bending powers.\" Todd and I continued to talk as he walked me home. I don't think anything I will ever do will be as crazy as everything in this memoir you have just finished reading. Nothing . THE END ","Summary":" OLIVE AND RHIANNON MAKE A HOME MOVIE From the memoirs of Olive Penderghast: For weeks, Rhi had been"},{"Movie":"Easy A","Title":"Never","Author":"patricia51","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7497322","Passage":"[Chapter 1] Never by patricia51 (Marianne's reaction to the Great Webcast of 2010. Perhaps wildly out of character but I wondered at why she was holding her cross so fiercely. Femslash overtones.) Long after Olive smiled into her webcam and then disappeared to be with Todd I continued to watch the now silent image of her room. I want to deny what she said, especially about Micah and Missus Griffith. No, more than deny it. I want it to be a vicious, unprincipled lie. I want a lightning stroke from heaven to prove that what she said is a lie. Of course that lightning bolt doesn't come. And it won't because I know that Olive was telling the truth. My heart is torn asunder because I know that the man I loved, past tense now, not only cheated on me and with a married woman to boot but he lied about it when he was caught. My face burns when I recall how Olive stood there with her arms open for me and the look on her face when I slapped her. When did I stop being confident in my faith and become so certain of my own infallibility? Some friend I turned out to be. The hurt and the guilt and the feelings of having failed not only Olive but everyone around me by my actions are all mixed in together. It all settles into a dull ache now as I cling to the silver cross at my throat with one hand. That dull ache is mixed with the fear that if I finally acknowledge my most secret feelings that cross will sear my hand like a branding iron. Will it? I've always thought it would, that certain people, certain actions, certain feelings, are beyond the pale and completely inconsistent with the central core of my faith. The central core of me. The biggest thing is that I never will be able to tell her. I'll never be able to tell Olive Penderghast that I, Marianne Bryant, professed Christian and hater of Homos and Whores, fell in love with her. That I dream about her at night and during the day. That I imagine her in that goddamn outfit from the pep rally and my knees grow weak and my mouth grows dry and I can't stop thinking about how her mouth would taste and how her body would feel against mine. And no matter how I pray about it late at night in my bed my thoughts drift to her and after a while I not only cannot stop my thoughts and my busy fingers I don't want to stop. And it's all so futile. Maybe, just maybe if I hadn't acted as I did I might at least get the chance to feel her in my arms again even if she thinks it's only because we're friends. I could settle for that. Amusing isn't it, I think bitterly. Olive is head over heels in love with Todd. Todd, who stood by her like a friend should; like a Christian should. And I am on the outside looking in with an attraction and desire that once I would have condemned as unnatural and hateful. Perhaps that's my punishment for being judgmental, for striking her. \"Let the one among you that is without sin cast the first stone.\" I guess I thought that was me. I was smug in my goodness. \"Pride goeth before a fall\". In this moment of clarity I can see what the future is going to bring. I'm not talking about Missus Griffith losing both her job and Mister Griffith. Those are givens. I'm only sorry about that because she turned out not to be whom I thought she was. And I'm not talking about Micah. I've made excuses for him long enough. No, what I'm talking about is going to incredibly hard. I will have to go to Olive and beg her pardon for acting as I did. I can be true to my beliefs at least that much; to remember \"For as you judge, so will you be judged\". That won't be the hard part. I expect Olive will forgive me, to my shame I know she is that kind of person, more Christian in her behavior than I was. It would almost be easier if she didn't. Because then I would have an excuse to avoid her. Then I wouldn't have to see her all the time with Todd and see her arms around him and remember how they felt around me. But I'll be good, supportive and penitent. I won't hope, no pray even for them to break up. I'll smile and encourage them and live with the knowledge that never will I be able to tell her how I feel about her.

Yeah, that's the word. Anyway, I haven't actually been doing the things that people say that I've been doing, but I haven't really been denying them either. \"So, I guess I was just wondering: is that wrong? It's just that a lot of people have been asking me to do things, and I thought it would be okay, because it's not real. \"It was make believe, and no one was getting hurt. But a lot of people hate me now, and I kind of hate me, too. And I've been getting hurt. And I'm tired of this. \"However, if I try to tell anyone the truth, not only will no one believe me, but there is a pretty good chance that the life of someone I respect very much will be turned upside down.\" Olive was thinking of Mr. Griffith. He didn't deserve what his wife was doing behind his back, but Olive really didn't want to have to be the one to tell him. \"Have you ever heard the saying, 'The truth will set you free'?\" Father Stephen had heard enough from Olive to see where she was coming from. \"I have.\" Olive nodded. \"The truth is uncomfortable and it changes things, but nothing can really ever stay the same way it is forever, except for God.\" \"Does God care that I lied about all of this?\" \"He does care, but He is also willing to forgive you. In fact, He wants to very much. He loves you.\" \"That's not what His followers at my school say.\" \"Then they're speaking for God, and putting words He never said in His mouth. He doesn't appreciate it, no matter how well intentioned it may be.\" \"I'm not sure it's well intentioned.\" \"The point is that they think they are well intentioned.\" \"Ah.\" \"People can really be awful. No doubt that you know that, since you're still in school. But don't let your peers determine your life, and how you live it. \"If you want your reputation back, or respect, or whatever it is that you think you've lost, take it back. Life is messy, and things get out of hand. But you can't let that rule you.\" \"How do I do that if it will really hurt someone that I don't want to hurt?\" \"May I ask in what way?\" \"A marriage.\" Olive sighed. \"If I come clean with the truth, someone I respect very much will lose their marriage. Not because of anything I did, but because of what I know, and what I haven't said.\" \"Don't you think that it would be better if that person found out the truth instead of living a lie and not knowing it?\" Father Stephen shook his head slightly. This young woman was definitely dealing with something far beyond her years. \"I just really hate that it has to be this way. The person involved really doesn't deserve what's been going on. And I don't want to be the one to tell.\" \"Is there anyone else who could?\" Father Stephen asked, already knowing the answer. If Olive was struggling with this, she was the only person who could expose the truth. \"Not really. That person's spouse, I guess, but there's not really a chance of that.\" \"What do you think you have to do?\" Father Stephen asked. \"I have to tell the truth.\" Olive's heart was heavy as she acknowledged that it was the only way. \"I'll be praying for you.\" Father Stephen said, and Olive appreciated it. \"Thanks. I think I'll need all the prayer I can get.\" Olive left the church and drove straight back to school. The afternoon session of detention was still going, and fortunately, Mr. Griffith was there. She waited for the students in detention to file out of his classroom. \"Olive?\" Mr. Griffith sounded surprised as she approached his desk. \"What's up?\" \"I need to tell you something, and it's horrible, and I'm really sorry.\" \"Does this have anything to do with you walking around dressed as Hester Prynne?\" \"Kind of. I found out that someone told the school that I had given something to him that I didn't...\" Olive waited for Mr. Griffith to catch up. She wasn't going into details. \"And...\" he supplied. \"And I know who did give him something, and you're not going to like it.\" Olive settled for a vague version of the truth, hoping he would understand. \"Olive, I don't know who you're talking about.\" Mr. Griffiths shook his head. \"I know that the stories going around can't be true. But who would lie-\" \"Your wife.\" She cut him off abruptly, but spoke quietly. \"What?\" \"It was your wife. I tried to get her to tell you. And she refused.\" \"I'm glad you told me, I guess?\" He said after a moment. \"I don't know what the proper response is when your student tells you that your wife has been cheating on you with an 18 year old.\" \"I'm so sorry, Mr. Griffith. I didn't want to tell you.\" \"Why did you?\" He asked, out of curiosity. \"Because a priest told me it was the only way for the truth to set me free.\" Olive said, honestly. \"Ah.\" \"He said you'd rather know and be upset than not and be blissfully ignorant but lied to.\" \"I would rather know, but it took a lot of guts to tell me that, Olive. I'm proud of you.\" \"So you'll help me repair my shattered reputation?\" she asked, half joking. \"I will.\" he nodded. \"You deserve it, after taking the backlash that someone else deserved.\" \"Really?\" Olive asked. \"Yes. It was very heroic of you.\" \"Thanks.\" Olive turned around to leave. \"Olive?\" Mr. Griffith said. \"Yeah?\" She turned to look at him. \"Thanks for telling me.

Olive and Todd finally get together. Olive's POV.) \"I think I'll lose my virginity to him. Maybe in five minutes, maybe tonight, maybe six months from now, or maybe on the night of our wedding. The amazing thing is, either way, it's really none of your business.\" I said those words to close the \"Big Webcast Confessional of 2010\" and I meant them. So why am I not only announcing that the great event has taken place but going into exquisite detail about it? Two reasons I suppose. First of all I want to finally set the rumors to rest about my previous \"experiences\". Heaven knows the first attempt didn't seem to do it. It calmed things down somewhat. Rhi and I got back to being friends and even Marianne and I settled into a sort of unspoken truce. But others didn't and really, that was okay because I really don't give a shit what a lot of them think. But for the general viewing audience, particularly the ones who complained I didn't take my clothes off the last time, well, I'm still not going to take off my clothes but I am going to describe what happened. Oh and the second reason? It's simple. Eat your hearts out one and all. If I had known (although he's always been so incredible at everything else so this shouldn't be a surprise) how marvelous a lover Todd would prove to be I seriously doubt I could have held myself in check this long. But he, sweet wonderful boy that he was and sweet wonderful and incredibly sexy man that he IS, has got more self-control than I do. But what would you expect of someone who didn't even want to have his first kiss until he felt it was right? God, I am so lucky. By the way, he's nice enough to claim that the wait was more than worth it. He claims that I left him staggering and smiling and wobbling as he walked for days afterwards. That's flattering but as I recall he was ready again the next morning. And the next evening. And the afternoon in between. No wonder I was walking bow-legged myself for a week or two. Still he absolutely insists that I was everything he had ever dreamed about and that he had dreamed about me a LOT over the years. The only light in the room was the pale glow of the moon peeking through the sheer curtains that were a-flutter in the breeze from the open balcony doors. But it was enough. I could see Todd on the bed, his hard-muslced body waiting for me. The covers were thrown back. I walked towards him in my silk nightie, conscious that it covered no more of me than his boxers did of him. I... Error - 8kb deleted - error ... So there you have it. Absolutely the exact account of how I surrendered my V-Card. Except for a couple of things I see I've forgotten in the heat of the moment so to speak. I AM going to show a bit of a video now. It's just related to what I've been talking about, not part of that actual time but that really IS none of your business regardless of what I have been talking about. But I think it's cute. It's Todd driving me from the church to the hall where we had our reception. On a lawn mower. I know we look funny, him in his tux and me in my long white dress (which I was perfectly entitled to wear by the way) and veil and all but I still love it. I love him too. I always have. So you see it wasn't five minutes after the video chat. It wasn't that night. It wasn't six months from then. It took place over five years after that day. It was after we graduated from high school. It was after we graduated from college. And son-of-a-gun if it didn't take place on our wedding night. Two more things by the way. By now you may be scratching your head and deciding that once more I'm telling stories. Why would you say that? Because I just went back and deleted everything that I just typed about how Todd and I made love for the first time. My first time, his first time (I can't believe someone as handsome and amazing as he is waited but he did), our first time. So why? Because it's our damn business (and none of your own to paraphrase an old western song). If you want sex on your computer go download something from a porn site. I know I left just enough here to piss you off if that's what you were expecting. Damn, give me a break. You think I was going to splash the details of our honeymoon on the web. Get real. Oh the second thing is that night is going to have consequences far beyond just one night (okay followed by a week) of incredible sex. When she gets older I don't want our daughter (or son) to know that it's splashed all over the web about the night that her parents conceived her. Bye! (The End) (I originally thought of completing the sex scene between Olive and Todd and then thought... nahhhhhhh. Obviously she would never post it. It would be much more like Olive to pretend she was going to reveal all the juicy details and then not do it.)

Olive and Todd were on the lawmower, driving (if that's even the word for it) along an old country road to nowhere when the lawmower stops. It just stopped, no warnings. Todd tried to restart it but tug on the string but nothing happened. The engine roared loudly and then it cut off almost immediately. Olive sighed and pulled out her phone. She tried called her mom. \"Shit, just my luck,\" she said under her breath when it said Sevice not available . Todd tried his phone too but the same words printed across the screen. Service not available . \"That's just dandy,\" Olive said sarcastically, then started laughing. Todd looked at her oddly and then just started laughing too. You would think they were mentally unstable in you saw them. They were laughing like maniacs. \"Looks like we're stuck out here,\" Todd told her, stating the obvious, when their laughter died down. \"I guess we are,\" Olive smiled. Todd wrapped his arm around her shoulder and they walked in the direction where they came from. Olive started to shiver even though it was about May in California. \"You cold?\" Todd looked concerned. Olive smiled at him. \"Just a little, I will survive though,\" she assured him. Todd hugged her closer to his body. \"Thanks.\" Olive looked up and met his eyes. They walked a little more before Olive almost collasped. \"You definitely need to go to sleep.\" Todd told her, setting her down by a huge oak tree. He held her tightly and she started to drift off into a sleepless sleep. Olive woke up in Todd's arms the next morning. She shook Todd slightly. \"Hey Todd, wake up sleepyhead,\" she whispered in his ear. He stirred and rubbed his eyes. \"We better get going,\" Todd said and Olive agree. It took four hours to walk back to Olive's house. \"I am tired, hungry and thristy,\" Todd complained. All Olive could was laugh. Olive check her phone. 2 new text messages . She decided to open them later and enjoy time with Todd. So that's what she did. The following Monday at school, everyone looked at her in sympathy. Maryanne walked up to her and wrapped into a bear hug. \"I am so sorry I slapped you and called you a whore,\" she screeched into Olive's ear. \"It's okay Maryanne,\" Olive said, not really caring.

The Red Lobster scene. Written instead of a chemistry lab write-up; also without dialogue, as that is for wimps, or something. Nothing is mine. Reviews (full of constructive criticism, as per usual) are love and rainbows. White Knight Syndrome Somehow, on the same Friday Todd's got the 6 to 10 shift for Red Lobster, Anson brings Olive on what looks like an actual date. Todd only shatters one water glass when he sees them over by the hostess' desk. It's not even a full glass. Things could be worse. Well, no. Things couldn't be worse, because this is Olive he's talking about, and when it comes to Olive, his brain doesn't exactly function the same way it does for the rest of the universe. See, on the one hand, Todd thinks Olive's hot. He can fully appreciate the aesthetics of her hips and her boobs and her legs and how they all make this curve, this long line of her that's just so easy to run his eyes down. (The new outfits she's been sporting? Don't help at all.) Besides, he's a guy. It's not like he can stop himself all that much. But on the other hand, the one currently holding a platter of lobster while he watches her talking with Anson as they sit down at the booth behind the fish tank, he doesn't just want to like her because of said hotness. That isn't fair to either of them. So he finds other things about her, things that slowly begin to accumulate until he barely notices the physical stuff anymore: she actually reads the books for English, and knows what \"prestidigitation\" means, and tries her hardest to be nice and generally pleasant to everyone (though she fails at that part a lot), and that up until two weeks ago, she walked through the halls like she just didn't give a shit – which, not to be a cliché, just makes her even hotter. Nowadays, she looks like she tries to look like she doesn't care, and it kind of hurts, because he wishes she didn't have to. Actually, it kind of sucks that Olive is letting all these guys exploit her like that – well, to be fair, he wouldn't know but with Brandon he's pretty sure it wasn't so much exploitation as a favor done – but he keeps reminding himself that whatever it is, it's Olive's choice. Except, when he watched her walking away from Marianne and Friends, it didn't look much like her choice at all. Out of the corner his eye, past the tiny clownfish he named Nemo on his second day of work, he sees her laughing. It's not her relaxed, No Really I Actually Think This Is Funny laugh though, no matter how much she grins; rather it's the one he saw when she was with Marianne, the This Is Awkward But If I Talk Fast Enough It'll All Work Out laugh. (He realizes that Anson has no way of knowing this. He doesn't care, and lets the weird feeling – triumph? – pass.) Look, it's not like he's some sort of stalker. But there are clues, once you know her well enough, a secret code of gestures and accessories – the one smile she wears when she wants to feel confident; her favorite pair of high heels for good mornings and afternoons and evenings; this one shade of lipstick when she wants to stalk the halls, get noticed. (She already has his full attention, but she hasn't caught on to that part yet.) Maybe it's all psychology, the noticing he does: he sees one detail and wants to know them all, to find the patterns. Anyways, just because he knows which laugh she uses with friends and which one with enemies and which one with frenemies (and he needs to stop overhearing his mother's HBO shows while doing homework), just because he knows her walks and her hand motions, just because he knows her doesn't mean he's, he doesn't know, in love or anything. However, remembering that he knows her better than Anson apparently does, while a little satisfying, doesn't really help his mood. In fact, he's decidedly grumpy when he's ringing up the check for booth 5 (the one that has the overworked parents who take their preschoolers to a lobster place and somehow don't expect that their children would throw their macaroni and cheese on the walls and there'd better be a tip for the clean up he'll have to do later) when he suddenly realizes that oh yeah , the overworked mom had taken him aside and said it was little Tyler's birthday today, please could you bring us a dessert? At the time, he'd nodded, because he needed to take booth 11's order – Rhiannon (who he now dislikes because how could she not see what she was doing to Olive as soon as she stood next to Marianne), shrimp linguini alfredo; her hippie parents (who are nice but he can smell the pot from ten feet away), a crab entrée to share – and then had promptly been distracted by the fact that Olive and Anson were sitting down in the window booth. Now, of course, he has to go get that dessert, but at the moment he's contemplating how Anson is a skeezeball, and a creeper too , and he's going to punch him in the face if he doesn't stop staring at her like that, and Olive deserves so much better, and shit , he really is in love/like/whatever-the-hell-this-is with her. (But only a little bit.) He finds the dessert tray in the kitchen, grabs a few spoons and the lobster hat and Sam and Eliza and Thomas to go dance the Birthday Lobster Conga over to booth 5. When he sets down the piece of chocolate cake, he spots her out of the corner of his eye (just past Nemo's little orange face), panicking. He then proceeds to not- exactly -stare at her Mission Impossible ninja crawl past the fish tank. Also, it is a total coincidence that when Olive (and Anson) leaves the restaurant, he has to go outside and check his car and yeah, his shift is totally over, yep . He reflects that he is kind of ridiculously pathetic, and finds that he doesn't actually care. When he goes to his car, he can see Anson, that asshole, leaning down and flashing some sort of – gift card? Credit card? ID? – and leaning down and – seriously, fuck Anson. He doesn't want to see this, because it's bad enough that apparently Olive is his one and only, 50's style, but now he has to see her with someone else. Except Olive doesn't look happy. Okay, so call him pathetic. He won't deny it. But this is Olive , the same Olive who he almost kissed in 8th grade and regretted not kissing ever since, the same Olive who's bright like a neon sign and way too smart for her own good, the same Olive who just did something to Anson (pushed him away? Punched him in the face? He can't really see past Anson's car) and is now stomping away. Is now crying . So maybe he has a bit of a White Knight complex. So maybe those heels look like they hurt. So maybe he just needs to make sure that Olive makes it home all right; so maybe he can't stand it when she cries. And so maybe it isn't romantic, or the best moment. And she might not accept his help, and she might run away when she sees how much he cares in the sappy, romcom sort of way (because he's pretty sure all she'll have to do is just look at his face to figure it out). But he rolls down his window, calls out her name, and when she smiles at him through her tears and running mascara and wobbling heels, his heart does some sort of thumpy belly-flop thing in his chest as she lets him take her home. And so maybe he tries to kiss her – it's not like he hasn't wanted to since 8th grade, not like he hasn't thought about it all the damn time – and it doesn't work, but – but it could, maybe. She smiles a little and says not like this and it's a little unreasonable but he hopes anyways. The point is that for once in these past two weeks, Olive looks like she could be happy – and right now, that's all Todd needs. ","Summary":" Easy A , Todd/Olive. The Red Lobster scene.

A/N: Lizzie replaces Rapunzel and Sam replaces Cinderella \"Oh my god that movie was awesome!\" Sam exclaimed as she and her sister Lizzie exited the theater. \"They made an awesome play into a great film! Agony was so funny. I couldn't stop laughing.\" Lizzie said smiling. Then she started to sing. \" Agony! Oh the torture they teach!\" Sam started laughing and joined in with her sister. \" Am I not sensitive, clever, well-mannered, considerate, passionate, charming, as kind as I'm handsome, and heir to a throne? \" The girls burst into laughter but they didn't notice that they had wandered into the street. They only looked up a mere second before a semi truck slammed into the sisters. Lizzie and Sam Harkness were dead before they even hit the ground. X=X=X \"Oh God my head.\" Sam groaned as she opened her eyes slowly. She looked next to her to see her sister who looked as if she were only gently sleeping. But something was different. Lizzie's clothes looked like a medieval gown of a lower class peasant. It was crimson red in color with no corset and it appeared to be very comfortable. Sam looked at her own clothes and noticed that they too had changed. She wore a simple green poofy shirt, black breeches, and brown knee high boots. \"Sammy?\" She looked back to Lizzie who was just sitting up. \"Why are we in a forest? And what happened to our clothes?\" Sam hadn't even noticed that her surroundings were not that of her home in Cardiff, Wales. \"I have no idea Liz. Let's try to find someplace with people so we can figure out where the hell we are,\" She started to stand as she spoke. Lizzie nodded and stood as well, \"I'm wearing such a pretty dress. It looks a lot like the one I wanted from Earthbound.\" She smiled and then twirled around. Sam laughed at her little sister, \"It looks pretty darn comfortable.\" \"It is.\" After a few hours of wandering through the woods, the sisters came across a small village. \"Finally! Civilization!\" Sam exclaimed dramatically while falling to her knees. Lizzie laughed and gently pulled her sister up. Then she noticed another thing that was weird. \"Sam, does the \"civilization\" look a little odd to you?\" \"Now that you mention it, yeah. It looks like a little medieval village.\" Sam said in confusion. \"Sammy, I think we fell through the Rift.\" The girls looked at each other, Sam in astonishment and Lizzie in fear and worry, her face then took on a look of panic. \"Dad and Ianto are going to be worried sick! What are we going to do?!\" \"First off, calm down before I smack you.\" Sam smirked when her sister shut her mouth and tried to calm herself. \"Second, we need to find someone who can tell us where we are.\" Lizzie nodded. \"Good pla - Sam look out!\" Sam turned just in time to see a white horse rear up, ready to trample her. \"Holy shit!\" She screamed, falling on her butt. Sam raised her arms, awaiting the impact from the horse. A/N: Sorry for the cliffie but I couldn't figure out where else to finish. It was going to be longer but I didn't want it too terribly long.[Chapter 2] \"Brother, I told you that you should have slowed your steed.\" Said a very handsome blonde man riding a black horse as he rode up to the other man. The white horse's rider was also very handsome. His hair was medium brown in color, dark brown eyes, and a rugged look to him. Him and the blonde man were both dressed in the kind of clothes worn by the higher class people in the Middle Ages. \"What the fuck are you doing, idiot?!\" Sam screamed that the brunette as he dismounted his horse. His face took on a very shocked expression with a hint of anger. \"I do apologize madam but you shouldn't use that sort of language to a prince.\" He said indignantly. \"I wouldn't care if you were God himself, you should've paid more attention, you asshole!\" Sam screamed before shoving him. The \"prince\" stepped forward in anger but stopped when Lizzie stepped in between them. \"Sir, I do apologize for my sister.\" She took on the odd vocabulary that they seemed to have. \"We've had a very odd day and my sister is irritated and confused.\" She bowed and sighed in relief when the blonde man stepped up. \"My ladies, what has happened to cause such distress?\" He asked, staring at Lizzie with an almost smoldering look in his eyes. The girls then launched into their story, leaving out the part where they died back in Cardiff. The brothers looked at each other before the brunette spoke. \"Well, you ladies certainly must be confused.\" \"Oh, we are. Um, may I ask you gentlemen for your names?\" Lizzie asked. \"I am Prince Charming. This is my brother, Prince Dashing.\" Lizzie started giggling and Sam snorted. \"What is so amusing?\" \"You've got weird ass names.\" Sam said before Lizzie elbowed her. \"What my sister means is just that we have never heard of those names before.\" \"What about you girls? What are you called?\" Charming asked. \"I'm Sam and this is Lizzie, my baby sister.\" Lizzie blushed and looked insulted. \"I'm barely a year younger than you Sam.\" Lizzie protested. \"I'm guessing that you young maidens don't have a place to stay? If that is so, we insist that you come back to our castle with us.\" \"Oh that's not necessary your majesties. We can find jobs and a place to stay here in this village. We don't want to impose.\" Lizzie shook her head. \"We insist, my lady.\" Dashing gave Lizzie a look that made her feel weak at the knees and crumble immediately. \"Well, alright.\" She said softly, looking enchanted. Dashing led her to his horse and helped her on before mounting behind her. Sam strutted over to Charming's steed and looked at him seriously. \"Don't get any funny ideas, Princey.\" She deadpanned before mounting by herself. \"Crazy woman.\" Charming muttered before mounting as well.[Chapter 3] A few months later, the Harkness sisters were getting used to life in the Middle Ages. Although the Princes were opposed to it, the girls went back to the village where they met the boys and started their new lives. They met this lovely married couple who owned the local bakery and upon hearing their story, the couple insisted that the girls stay with them. Life was pretty good for the girls. Even though they missed their fathers, they were happy in their new home. They still kept in contact with the princes through letters. In the woods just outside of town, Lizzie had a hidden garden where she grew delicious looking fruits and gorgeous flowers. She often went there after the bakery closes and some of the fruits ended up in the sweets the baker made. It was her little haven. Life got interesting one unsuspecting spring day. The bakery had been unusually busy and they closed earlier than normal. Lizzie had just left for her garden and Sam had gone up to her room. She was just about to open a book when there was a large bang was heard from downstairs. Sam jumped off her bed and rushed downstairs. There, in the now doorless entrance, was the witch from next door. Sam went over to the baker and his wife, slightly freaked out. \"What the hell do you want, lady?\" Sam snapped at the old hag. \"It's not what I wish, it's what they wish,\" She looked at the wife. \" Nothing cooking in that belly now is there? And there will never be. Unless you do exactly as I say. In three days time, a blue moon will appear. Only then can the curse be undone .\" \"Fucking riddles man,\" Sam muttered. \"What curse?\" The wife asked, scared of what the answer could be. \"The one I placed on this house,\" The witch seemed to think it was utterly obvious. \"What are you talking about?\" The baker asked. The witch sighed, \" In the past, when you were no more than a babe, your father brought his young wife and you to this cottage. They were a lovely couple, but not lovely neighbors. You see your mother was with child and she developed an unusual appetite. She admired my beautiful garden .\" Sam sighed in annoyance. \"Can you just get to the point?\" The witch glared at her. \"Silence child!\" She snapped before continuing. \" Your mother told your father that what she wanted more than anything in the world was greens, greens, nothing but greens. Parsley, peppers, cabbages and celery. Asparagus and watercress and fiddleferns and lettuce! He said Alright but it wasn't quite, because I caught him in the autumn in my garden one night .\" Sam was getting more and more impatient. \" He was robbing me, reaping me, rooting through my rutabaga, raiding my arugula and ripping up the rampion, my champion! My favorite! I should have laid a spell on him right there !\" She suddenly shouted making the three jump. \"I could've turned him into stone, or a dog, or a chair.\" The witch started to laugh before she sobered up. \" But I let him have the rampion - I had lots to spare. In return however I said Fair is fair. You will let me have the baby that you wife will bare and call it square .\" The baker looked shocked. \"I have a brother?\" \"No. But you have a sister.\" \"Well, where is she?\" The man demanded. \"She's mine now.\" The old lady growled. \"And you'll never find her.\" \"Oh my god can you get on with the story?!\" Sam exclaimed in irritation. \" Small price to pay for what else your father stole from me. It cost me my youth, my beauty. My mother warned me. She would punish me with the curse of ugliness if I ever lost any of them ,\" The witch looked up as if she was scared her mother was right above her. \"Lost what?\" Sam and the wife asked in unison. \" The Beans, the special beans. I let him go. I didn't know he'd stolen my beans. I was watching him crawl back over the wall when BANG! CRASH! A lightning flash !\" The witch then flipped her head back. \" But that's another story. Never mind, anyway. At last the big day came. I made my claim. Oh don't take away the baby they shrieked and screeched. But I did, and I hid her where she'll never be reached. Your father cried and your mother died when for extra measure - i admit it was a pleasure - I said Sorry I'm still not mollified and I laid a little spell on them .\" She pointed to the Baker. \" You too son. That your family tree will always be … a barren one .\" When the wife heard that she started to cry. The man went to comfort his wife. He turned to glare at the old woman. \"How could you do this?\" He demanded. The witch ignored him like she did with Sam, \" And when your mother died, your father deserted you. Your father was no father, so why should you be?... Now there's no more fuss and there's no more scenes and my garden thrives; you should see my nectarines! But I'm telling you the same I tell kings and queens: don't ever never ever mess around with my greens!...especially the beans .\" \"Dick move, woman,\" Sam said. \"Is there no way to break the spell?\" The wife asked. \" You wish to have the curse reversed? I need a certain potion first. Go to the woods and bring me back, \" She started counting off with her fingers that had claw like nails that made Sam feel revolted. \" One, the cow as white as milk. Two, the cape as red as blood. Three, the hair as yellow as corn. Four, the slipper as pure as gold. Bring me these before the chime of -\" \"Let me guess midnight?\" Sam deadpanned. \" Before the chime of midnight in three days time, that's when the blue moon reappears which comes but once each hundred years! \" The witch now seemed to be begging them. \" Bring them and I guarantee a child as perfect as child can be. Go to the wood! \" Then she disappeared in a twister of dust and wind. \"Why is it always midnight?\" Sam said before going upstairs to get her coat. There was no way she wasn't going to help. She refused to stay home and do nothing. Besides she needed to tell Lizzie so she doesn't get worried when she comes home and find her sister and the Baker gone. When she came back down, the couple where arguing. \" The spell is on my house. Only I can lift the spell .\" The baker sang. His wife shook her head before singing her protest, \" No no, the spell is on our house. We must lift the spell together. The spell is on our house .\" \"Now remind me, what are we to return with?\" This made Sam sigh in annoyance. \"These items will help you two have a kid and you can't remember them? There's the cow as white as milk, the cape as red as blood, the hair as yellow as corn, and the slipper as pure as gold!\" \" A cow as white as milk, the cape as red as blood, the hair as yellow as corn, the slipper as pure as gold. \" The baker repeated. \" Into the woods, it's time to go. It may be all in vain, I know. Into the woods but even so I have to take the journey .\" \" Into the woods. The path is straight. You know it well ,\" the Baker's wife said. \" But who can tell ?\" The baker started to head out the door with Sam in tow. \" Into the woods to lift the spell .\" The wife looked on with worry as the two left. \" The way is clear. The light is good. I have no fear. Nor no one should. The woods are just trees. The trees are just wood. No need to be afraid. There's something in the glade there. \" The baker suddenly paused but shrugged it off. \"I nto the woods without delay but careful not to lose the way. Into the woods. Who knows what could be lurking on the journey. Into the woods to get the thing that makes it worth the journeying. Into the woods to make the potion. Into the woods! Into the woods! Into the woods and out of the woods and home before dark! \" ","Summary":" Into the Woods Redone.

Enjoy! Disclaimer: I don't own the characters or situations mentioned in Easy A . John Hughes is a Big Fat Liar ( or how my life did not go back to normal after revealing my Big Non - Slutty Secret to the entire school ) If there is one thing about my story you need to remember, it's this: real life is never going to be just like a John Hughes movie, no matter if you've managed to snag yourself a boyfriend who shows up outside your window on a riding lawn mower and whisks you away into the sunset to the awesomely synthetic tunes of Peter Gabriel... which I did, thank you very much. But the thing about movies and books is that they usually end once you get your Hollywood happy ending. You never do get to find out if Cinderella and Prince Charming end up having a dozen snotty brats, getting old and saggy, and hating each other's guts or if the Breakfast Club manages to topple the strict social pyramid that is the American high school and stay BFFs for life after the credits roll, you know? I'd like to say that my ending was just as perfect and awesome as any of the movies, and yeah, for one glorious weekend, it was. I had my John Cusack (although I don't think Cusack ever had abs as nice as Woodchuck Todd's), got my kickass musical number, and I had been gloriously vindicated in the eyes of my peers. Or so I thought. It shouldn't surprise a single one of you that broadcasting the sordid details of my two week reign as the supposed slut of the Ojai North High to the World Wide Web did not, in fact, immediately set all things right in the crazy life and world of Olive Penderghast. I was hoping that some other shiny scandal would occur over the weekend to distract the magpie-like attention spans of my contemporaries, but alas, that was not to be. Come the Monday After, people were still texting each other about my supposed slutty shenanigans in first period (\"herd olive&todd; did it on a lawn mower!1! wut a easy ho\"), whispering about me in bathroom stalls (\"Can you believe that attention whore? Did all that for a guy, Christ, what a dumb bitch.\"), shooting me judging glares in the hallway, and generally just being assholes about the entire situation. Perhaps I should have uploaded a Spark Notes version of my tale for the substandard achievers because it seemed my point about gossip being a Very Bad Thing Indeed and that slut shaming is Incredibly Uncool and Hurtful had gone over everyone's heads quite nicely. I'm sure Molly Ringwald never had to sit through a lecture from rat-faced Nina Lachowski about the horrible sin of lying for ten minutes in English before the substitute could get her to shut up and probably would have made up with her former best friend who called her a tramp the week before by lunch too. And I bet Ferris Bueller totally never got a month's worth of after school detention for his kickass musical number. Lucky bastard. At times, the Monday After I spilled my big, non-slutty secret to the entire school felt worse than the weeks where everyone thought I was Doing It all over the place. How unreal was that? I had triumphed most supremely Friday afternoon. I had taken control of my image and reclaimed my sense of self! I had stuck it to The Man and told everyone where they could shove their ridiculous sexual double standards! I got the guy, empowered myself, and I was Queen of the World! And yet I was still eating lunch in the big wide cafeteria alone and feeling like utter shit. Yeah, this would definitely be the scene of my movie they'd leave on the cutting room floor. Who wants to watch the fearless protagonist be publicly humiliated even more than she already was? So I did what any other teenage girl who had turned a thousand of her peers against her with one brief webcast: I sought out someone who'd understand my deep and unrelenting angst. And no, it wasn't a protagonist in a Judy Blume or Sarah Dessen novel, okay. Geeze. The thing about having a boyfriend who spends a good chunk of his school day wandering around in a woodchuck outfit is that he should be easy to find in a crowd. However, Todd must've been going incognito today to avoid all the congratulatory, \"Dude, you finally made with a hot chick! Yeaaaah!\" asspats in the locker room or the simpering pouts from his club full of admirers. (If you think it's weird that our school mascot has admirers, you have clearly never seen Woodchuck Todd's fabulous abs on game day.) Because I don't have his class schedule memorized (stalker I am not) and couldn't find him in the hallways between classes, I had to wait to talk to him until seventh period gym, the one class we had together. The guys were still on their swimming unit and we girls were supposed to be running laps around the track, but I begged out, informing Coach Johannson that my body was currently putting my uterus through the blender and I could barely walk, let alone run, without being in extreme amounts of pain. I think she would've let me stay behind anyway, what with the bomb I dropped about Mrs. Griffiths making every other teacher uncomfortable as hell around me, like I was some scandal sniffing gossip dog. I just happened to be in the wrong place and blamed for the wrong STD at the wrong time. Take a chill pill and treat me like a human, teachers. Anyway, I hung around on the bleachers by the pool, ignoring Evan every time he walked by to glare daggers at me for telling everyone that our imaginary tryst was, well, totally imaginary and ruining his chances with the ladies until college, until Todd finished with his laps and exited the pool in all his dripping wet glory to sit come talk to me. \"Your nickname today shall be Merman Todd in honor for your great skill at the forward crawl,\" I declared as he approached, sounding much more confident than I felt. \"Or are your particularly attached to the Woodchuck portion of your name?\" Todd grinned and my heart fluttered, making me feel a tried and true teenage girl again. One of the things I like about Todd is not only is not he scared away by my humor, but he gets it and that is essential for the boyfriend of Olive Penderghast. \"All this conditional identity business is going to mess with my head,\" Todd replied, sitting beside me. He did a good job of ignoring the wolf whistles that were howled in our direction by our classmates; me, not so much. \"Someday I'm going to wake up and think I am actually Merlobsterchuck Todd and it will be all your fault.\" \"Merlobsterchuck. Now that would be an interesting mascot,\" I replied, scooting over to avoid the water he was dripping all over the bleachers. \"I don't think it will strike fear into the hearts of our rivals though. More like extreme confusion.\" Todd nodded and threw the towel in his hands on his head, drying himself off. While his head was covered, the boys across the pool — asshole Evan among them — took it upon themselves to make incredibly lewd gestures at my person. The Olive from last week wouldn't have stood for that shit, but the Olive of the Monday After was still feeling vulnerable and miserable enough to refer to herself in third person, so it only added to my bad mood. It took Todd approximately five seconds to pick up on my change in demeanor; probably one of his super powers as a Merlobsterchuck... thing. \"You look unhappy,\" he said, peering at me curiously from under his towel. His gaze followed mine across the pool where the crowd of XY-chromosome carrying dumbasses was quickly dispersing. \"People still giving you shit?\" \"Of course not. Our peers are incredibly forgiving and understanding creatures who welcomed me eagerly back into their bosom of friendship and joy,\" I said grumpily, leaning back onto the bleachers and glaring up at the sky. I wish had remembered to grab my sunglasses. \"I don't know why I thought that webcast would magically fix everything. I'm still getting called a whore except now I'm a lying whore, everyone thinks I chucked your wood over the weekend even though the V-card is still firmly entrenched in my wallet, and the next big rumor going around will be that I dominated you on the bleachers in full sight of seventh period gym class... \" Even if I hadn't actually done anything except lie the last few weeks, the fact that thousands of other teenage girls who had slept with their boyfriends, let some guy stick their tongue down their throat at a party, or, gasp, had sex for the fun of it had to go through this judgemental bullshit daily was depressing enough for me. Why was it anyone's goddamn business what went on between my legs? \"But the question is, will the rumor include the fact that you dominated me while wearing the Ojai North Woodchuck mascot suit? Because then that'd check 'closet furry' off the kinky sex bingo card real fast,\" Todd replied, pulling the towel down around his shoulders. He grinned, but it faded when he noticed my mood hadn't improved. \"Hey, I know it sucks now. But didn't we say we were just going to ignore it?\" \"Yeah, but... \" But you ' re not a teenage girl , Todd , I wanted to say. Except how does one explain all the complexities of being a teenage girl world to a teenage boy? All the mixed messages we get sent every day — be smart, but not too smart because guys don't like that; be sexy, but you're a slut if your shirt rides too low; wait for marriage, but you're a prude if you won't give it up to your boyfriend; be proud of your body, but here's a bunch of products to fix every single little mistake God made when he gave it to you. It's no wonder we're all grumpy and a little bit crazy by the time we move out of the hellhole stage of life known as adolescence. \"But sometimes it's just hard to ignore,\" I said instead. \"I don't know, maybe I'm just in a girl mood or whatever, but it's going to suck, spending the next year and the half always wondering what other people are saying about me. And you. And — us.\" It was probably a bit presumptuous of me to assume that Todd and I would still be together by graduation. After all, we'd been dating a grand total of two days and I still couldn't believe he wanted to date me, of all people. A part of me thinks he's going to go running for the hills once he realizes how incredibly boring my life is, that being with the girl who lies to and for people isn't all that fun, and that deep beneath my snarky exterior I'm just as weepy and emotionally needy as everyone else. \"It's just... now that I've heard the worst, it's harder to tune out now, I guess,\" I finished, turning my gaze to my tennis shoes and waiting for him to laugh it off and tell me to stop being so sensitive. In an 80s movie, this would've been the moment where Todd would've assuaged my doubts by leaning over to kiss me in full view of all of our haters and I would've forgotten all about my miserable Monday After in favor of making out on the bleachers with Prince blaring in the background or something. But, like I said, life — especially mine — isn't a John Hughes movie. There aren't lines written by someone else to memorize or cliches to follow for the sake of pleasing an audience; you don't have to force chemistry with Anthony Michael Hall or deal with wooden actors who make your job a million times harder. And there certainly aren't any edited versions that get to run on TNT so you can relive your glory days a million times a month either. You have to improvise with life and while that's really shitty and sometimes painfully embarrassing, it can end up being really satisfying too. Todd didn't kiss me on the bleachers that day, but he did reach for me hand and gave it a reassuring squeeze. And miraculously, that felt better than any kiss we could've had. \"Things will get better, Olive,\" he said, giving me that smile of his that had been melting my knees since the eighth grade. \"And if they don't, at least you won't have to do it alone this time.\" Here's another big confession: the thing I love (yes, l-o-v-e) most about Todd isn't that he has a great sense of humor or that he looks good with his shirt off and covered in blue body paint. It's that, somehow, he always knows just when I need him most and he usually knows the right thing to say too. He's a good guy — way better than a thousand John Cusacks or Judd Nelsons combined. \"You're right,\" I said, looking him in eye and smiling for the first time all day. \"I don't.\" ","Summary":" Author's Notes: I loved Easy A and I really wanted to write some Olive/Todd post-movie fic because "},{"Movie":"Easy A","Title":"Ever After?","Author":"badwolf707","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10670882","Passage":"[Chapter 1] So in the end she and Rhiannon aren't as close as they once were.

I couldn't help but get the vibe that pretty much every guy in the film liked Miss Zachey, she was just such a lovable character. Therefore, I wrote this short drabble for her. Disclaimer: I Don't Own Drillbit Taylor. There weren't any teachers in McKinley High that were adored by its students. Except for the English teacher, Miss Zachey, that is. She had beautiful golden wavy locks, that just begged for someone to run their fingers through them, and bright sea-blue eyes that a person could get lost in if they stared at her long enough. Perhaps it was her appearance that most students liked (at least the male students, anyway). Or maybe it was the way she carried herself when she was in their presence; treating them like her equals and not her underlings. It could've been because she wasn't like most teachers. Miss Zachey was never obnoxious or boring, she was perky, and pleasant to be around. She didn't ramble on about dull subjects for long periods of time, she'd always make her presentations as short and to the point as possible, and always managed make everyone interested in whatever she was discussing. She didn't demand respect from the rest of the class, most students just gave it to her. She didn't scold students for not paying any attention to her, she just hoped that they'd catch what she'd said the next time around. She didn't get angry when she had to repeat herself several times to a student (even when they'd clearly been daydreaming in the middle of class), she would just smile and shake her head. And no matter how out of line, or rude a student would act (although it rarely happened), she would always respond to them in a soft, understanding tone. And though she taught of language and great poets, her words were like poetry in and of themselves. Every word that came out of her mouth was like a long line of a million lovely words strung together, in one beautiful piece. Her voice was so gentle and sweet, that it could put one to sleep if they closed their eyes. She always wore an easy smile on her face. And even on the rare occasions when she didn't smile, there would always be a happy glint in her eyes. All the boys in class had a small crush on Miss Zachey. And if adoration from her students wasn't enough, the parents adored her even more so. Though she could never find herself a man (not that the students minded). Or at least, she could never find a man that would ever amount to anything. She did have boyfriends, but they never lasted long. She always fell for the wrong kind of guy. Always someone that would mistreat her, and didn't deserve her love even in the least bit. As far as her students were concerned, no one would ever be good enough to deserve it.

I shoved her off and tried to pull the covers back over my head ''Come on Fallon get your lazy ass up, we're starting at a new school come on'' she shrieked, sometimes I hated her attitude to and early start I was not a morning person. ''Alright I'm going surprisingly enough I do not move at fifty miles per hour, my speed in the morning is two'' I grumbled before trudging to the bathroom, I heard the door slam indicating that she had gone to get ready. Thank god. I stepped into the shower and felt my muscles relax as the hot water caused the bathroom to be smothered in a blanket of steam, I washed my hair with my favourite strawberry and mango shampoo and conditioner with matching body wash. Once I was satisfied I wrapped a fluffy towel round my self and wiped the steam off my mirror, chocolate brown hair with a natural wave hung loosely just reaching my hips with forest green eyes and long eye lashes greeted me. I opened my wardrobe and winced at the door creaked open and nearly fell of all together, I really do need to fix that at some point. I pulled out some red skinny jeans with a black jumper that zipped up at the back with my black doc martins and a leather jacket and quickly put on some foundation, eye liner and mascara and jogged down the stairs. I said a quick hello to Blairs mum Hadley who was kind enough to let me stay with her, Blairs' past and her mums were not what you would call great and neither was mine, her mum was nice enough to let me live with them when I turned sixteen, but enough about that I will let you die of boredom when I tell my story later. I grabbed an apple of the counter and met Blair by the door who was wearing a black long sleeve dress with leggings that were ripped down the front with a denim jacket, combat boots and her charm bracelet. We both had identical charm bracelet, we got them when we were six and have kept them ever since. I grabbed my bag off the floor and headed out of the door, we got to the end of the road where the bus stop was, there were a few people waiting there which gave it away. I finished my apple and dropped the core, Blair was still talking non stop since we left the house. ''A new start at Mckinley, and as we wait for the usual yellow bus Blair does not seem to be shutting up any times soon'' I tried to sound like a news reporter. Blair smacked the back of my head '' well excuse me for being exited '' she huffed ''I am as well but I hate being the 'new girl' '' I sighed, that was the one thing I hated being the centre of attention while the teacher made you stand at the front of the class and talk about yourself. ''I do to but at least we have each other'' she grinned, I laughed '' Well that's one thing we can get through today, together'', the school but then pulled up the yellow paint peeling off. We stepped on and sat at the front, for once not having people throwing food at our head like they were dart boards. I was jerked forwards as the bus pulled to a stop, we were the last to get off the bus avoiding everyone pushing each other, once we were off a small boy with light brown hair jumped in front of us ''hi I'm Emmett, you must be the new girls'' he chirped. He sounded to perky for how early it was but he reminded me of my little brother in a way, ''that's us'' I cheered sarcastically, he was about to reply but he paled slightly, I looked behind us to see to boys well men walking our way. They were held back that was for sure, one of them had slightly curled dark brown hair he was well built at least 6 ft, the other had short dark brown hair, again well built about 6'2. People practically ran to get out of their way. ''Come on Emmett you can show us our lockers'' me and Blair both grabbed his shoulders and dragged him towards the building, ''I'm guessing you saw too'' I questioned Blair she nodded. ''Emmett who are they'' Blair asked softly ''Filkins and Ronnie their basically the school bullies, try to avoid them, here's your lockers'' he smiled before trotting down the hall. '' At least our lockers are next to each other'' I smiled, everyone in the hall parted making room for Filkins and Ronnie who were holding Emmett by his trousers screeching. They tried to shove him into an open lockers, no one else was helping him just standing there, I walked up and grabbed Filkins by the hood of his jacket and pulled him away Blair helping with Ronnie. I pulled Emmett out of the locker and whispered a quick run, he sprinted off down the hall, The locker door slammed in my face as I was met with glaring and very angry Filkins. I had to look up to his his face, my measly hight of 5'5 was nothing compared to him ''look what we have here'' he grinned down at me, he slammed me into the lockers and I winced but I had dealt with people larger than him. ''Awww trying to protect your little boyfriend now are we'' he mocked, I raised my fist and swung it forwards, hitting him in the jaw, while he was examining his face I grabbed Blair's arm and pulled her away from Ronnie who was currently rolling around on the floor holding his 'certain' place which made me grin before racing off with Blair in tow to our lesson. The teacher didn't even spare us a second glance as we entered the room, he merely told us to take a seat not moving his eyes from his computer screen ''looks like someone's watching something interesting, hey Fallon'' Blair giggled wiggling her eyebrows,''clearly'' I laughed before we took a seat at the back. I pulled out my sketch pad and started to draw whatever came to mind, after ten minuets I was almost finished when the door burst open ''Filkins and Ronnie your late'' the teacher stated in a bored tone not noticing the paper balls being thrown his way and students running backwards and forwards through the room, ''take a seat'' he motioned towards me and Blair. ''Well we're in trouble'' I dead panned and watched as they both stalked over '' you don't say'' Blair's mocking voice whispered, I looked away and continued to draw as they both collapsed into their seats, I'm surprised they could take the weight. '' That stunt you pulled, really wasn't that funny '' Filkins growled '' well I thought it was '' taking his silence as a sign that the, very short, conversation was over I looked down at what I had drawn. I wanted to burn it. It was a portrait of Filkins which I wanted to set on fire and never speak of it again but before I could get rid of it my sketch pad was snatched from my hand, Filkins took one look at the picture and grinned I lunged for it, throwing my self over him to get it, I failed obviously and missed it by a few centimetres the teacher finally looked up from his computer. ''Fallon stand outside'' he said flatly, I sighed but stood up and trudged outside not missing the smug look on Filkins face, I slammed the door behind me I spun round and looked through one of the windows and saw Blair who looked like she was screaming at Ronnie. And to top it all off Filkins was flicking through all of my sketches. I glared at him through the window wishing I had the power to burn him where he sat but unfortunately all he did was smirk at me and carry on with what he was doing ignoring me silently pleading him in my mind to stop, a few minuets later the teacher let me back In the class room to get me things. Once I heard the shrill sound of the bell go off like a siren I snatched my sketch pad out of Filkins hand shoved it in my bag and made my way out of the room to see Emmett standing out side the room, I gave him a small smile grateful for him being nice enough to take me and Blair to our lessons for the day. I grabbed Blair's shoulder and pulled her away from what looked like a highly, note the sarcasm, interesting conversation with Ronnie and we were off to our next lesson. Finally it was lunch, you do not realize how happy I was to see food, once we paid for everything including my two burgers and a hot chocolate with whipped cream and marshmallows we sat with Emmett and A few of his friends. '' breey fu oke '' Blair tried to say with her mouth full of food '' she said, hey you okay '' I explained to Emmett '' yeah I'm fine '' he sighed '' hey I know what can cheer you up '' I grinned and Blair's head shot up '' you do '' I sighed '' not you, but I know how to cheer you up '' I smiled at Emmett. And that's how I caused a food fight between everyone in the canteen, me and Blair grabbed a fist full of mash potato and threw it at Emmett. He shrieked and ducked and the potato splattered on the two people behind him. '' oh no '' I whispered as Ronnie and Filkins turned round and the look on their faces said it all I looked at Blair who had the same look on her face I did. '' Every man for himself '' I shouted before running. I dodged round other people throwing food and teachers trying to get control of the situation, Filkins still right behind me, and grabbed a bowl of mash potatoes and turned round. I was met with pasta sauce covering my face and hair, Filkins laughed but it was cut short when I smashed the potatoes in his face, I giggled at his expression '' can I at least now your name '' he questioned '' I leant up and whispered in his ear '' It's Fallon''. The food fight came to a halt when the door to the canteen slammed open '' you two '' principal Doppler pointed at us '' my office '' I heard Filkins grumble then we both trudged after the principal.

Drillbit was back to how he was before he met Wade, Ryan and Emmit ,back in the woods hanging out in trees scrimping for relationship with \"that teacher\" as he preferred to call her had fallen apart and he was back out on the streets. He trudged back to his \"home\"He supposed it was and sighed as the rain began to fall. This situation was slightly better than it had been the last time ,at least now he had a tent and a sleeping crawled into the tent soaked through from the rain and shivering ,but finally he fell asleep. Around the same time as Drillbit fell asleep a teenage girl was spritining towards town . Drillbit was woken early the next morning as something came crashing through the woods right into his camp .He was at attention immediately ,if it was a cop he was in trouble ,if it was anything else ,who knew. Whatever it was ,it was breathing heavily and as it went to run past the tent it tripped on one of the ropes and went sprawling across the ground .Drillbit sprang out of his tent as the thing went sprawling and as he looked round the tent to where the thing had landed he saw.... A teenage girl wearing black knee high boots,black skinny jeans with a Rip across one knee, a black leather jacket with a black top underneath and black sunglasses ,the type that bodyguards usually have. Her hair was the only thing colourful about her it was a very vivid dark red and it fell straight down to her waist ,beside her was a black backpack with whit skulls and crossbones on it .She saw him looking at her and scrambled to her feet clutching a bright red bag that looked so out of place with her black clothes. \"You steal that?\" Drillbit asked her pointing to the red bag. \"So what if I did?\" The girl shot back at him \"Even a runaways gotta eat at some point \" \"Why you running?\" Drillbit asked \"Thats for me to know\" Was the reply \"Who are you anyway?\" \"The names Drillbit\" \"I'm Ace\" \"what kinda name's Ace?\" \"I dont know what kinda names Drillbit?\" \"I dont know ,So why you runnin' Ace?\" \"I already said that's for me to know!\" Ace snapped and she glared at him for a few seconds before a snapping sound made her whip her head about ,scared. \" I gotta jet see ya round Drillbit\" and with that she had gone ,disappeared into the trees with both bags .A few seconds later a man with a very bushy moustache crashed into the camp. \"You!\" He barked at Drillbit \"You seen a girl come past here ,all in black ,red hair ,sunglasses with a bright red bag?\" \"yeah I saw her she went that way\" Drillbit pointed in the opposite direction from the way Ace had went. \"Thanks\" Moustache man said and he charged off through the trees in completely the wrong direction. A few minuets later ,Ace came back \"You didnt send him after me?\" \"nah that's not my way\" \"Well thanks , Your an alright guy Drillbit\" \"so Ace ,heading anyplace in particular?\" Drillbit asked to change the subject \"Nope,just where ever I decide where the pickings are good and someplace my parents aren't looking for me ,you'd think that after three months they'd just give up trying to get me back\" \"They must really want you back then\" \"No my dad just wants his good old punching bag back\"She smiled bitterly and she took her sunglasses off to reveal a black eye ,it was so swelled up that she couldn't even open her right eye \"I can take him though .But enough of that I should move before Mr Moustache comes back \" she shoved her glasses back on and turned to leave. \"Wait a sec Ace\" Drillbit called after her \" You say you can fight ?\" \"Yeah ,you wanna go \" She moved into a martial arts stance facing him \"No I don't wanna fight you ,but you need money right?\" \"Yeah I do\" \"Well,with your skills and my brains we could pull the ultimate body guarding scam ,there are tons of people out there who would pay good money for people to protect them ,I should know Ive done it before\" \"I'm listening\" Ace said Drillbit then explained about his time as a bodyguard for Wade,Ryan and Emmit. Ace listened to the story and laughed a bit when he showed her his missing finger \"Hey thats not funny!\" Drillbit said to her \"Yeah it is !\" Ace giggled back at him \" Why did you catch a Samurai sword?\" \"cause it was going to hit the kids \" \"aww cute\" Ace said sarcastically \"Are you in or not?\" Drillbit asked \"Yeah i'm in\" Ace said \"when do we start\" \"Today..if possible\" Whoop first chappy all done !!!!!!!!!!!

Or Jane Eyre. Chapter 1: Her~ 1. She was six when she first saw him. She had been playing in the front yard when a moving van pulled up across the street. She had grabbed hold of her pink stuffed rabbit, got to her feet and ran out to the curb as the mysterious new strangers - two adults and one child - exited their vehicle. He was not much older than she, and at the time thought they could be great friends. She had grown excited and filled with glee as he came trotting up to her, looking both ways before crossing the street. He came to stand at the edge of the curb, just in front of her, and eyed her curiously. She had become awkward and fidgety under his gaze, she remembered, and had not noticed when his eyes lingered downwards to the stuffed treasure she held in one arm. He had not said a word. Without warning or incentive, he snatched the fluffy bunny from her loose hold, smiled, and ran off. She barely had time to mourn the loss of her only friend as her mother called her back inside for dinner, to which she numbly obeyed. In her shock, she remembered, quite clearly, looking back across the street. He was nowhere to be found. She would not see Mrs. Periwinkle for a very long time. 2. She was in school the second time she saw him. She had been doodling idly in her notebook when the teacher announced a new student. She immediately looked up, her curiosity quashed when she caught sight of him . He wasn't looking at her, merely staring at the one empty seat in the back that would soon be his. Gradually he scanned the faces, his gaze backtracking as it rested on her. His big eyes squinted, then widened as he remembered her. Then he did something she would never forget: he smiled. He smiled the biggest smile his premature face muscles could manage. The knowing, tell-all smile that said he remembered full well what he had done to her - what he had stolen - and he wasn't sorry. He was proud of it. Proud as proud could be. At that moment one thing became clear to her own six-year-old brain: she wasn't about to get that bunny back any time soon. 3. Her ninth birthday was when everything changed. She had just blown out the candles on her cake when there came a knock at the door. Her mother, wondering who it could be, walked over and answered, cracking the door open. She heard a woman's voice, and it was then that she saw him . He was hiding behind his mother's legs, peering inconspicuously into the room beyond. His face reddened as he realized he had been caught by her stare, and he wasted no time in sending an angry glare at her before hiding further behind his mother. When they were done with their exchanges, her mother came back into the room, but not empty handed. In her hands was a fairly large box, wrapped - albeit poorly - in festive birthday paper. It was handed to her with little care, and she shook it with even less. Though immensely curious, she was no fool. He would always give her 'gifts', wrapped or not, and they were always a part of some dastardly prank. She had learned early on not to trust him, but she always ended up opening the wrapped boxes. Not because she was naive, but because she was curious. Inherently, uncontrollably curious. Shaking the box again, she held her ear to it. It made no sound; not a rustle, nor a thud. And that made her all the more suspicious. Gulping down her curiosity, she held the box tightly in front of her. And tossed it carelessly onto the floor. 4. It was two whole days before she opened it. After her birthday party, her parents had informed her that they would be moving. She was elated; she would no longer have to deal with him , and she had no friends to miss anyway. They were only moving an hour away, they told her, but it was enough for her. And so, on the eve of their move, she found the courage to finally open the unopened birthday present, the first of its kind. She figured that, in the end, she would be far away - so far away that he would never be able to mock or prank or laugh at her ever again - so there was really no harm in letting her curiosity get the best of her one last time. She made quick work of the wrapping paper, revealing a cardboard box underneath. It had bold black letters printed on the side that read: 'PLATES'. Plates? Why would he give her plates? She tried to comfort herself with the thought that he had probably just used an old box out of the house because he was too lazy to find anything else, but knowing him and his devious mind, it did little to help the more probable idea that he was just using it to toy with her fragile mind. Mustering up the courage that she had had just moments before, she took a breath, and, fearing the worst, opened the box. What lay inside, unprotected by even the smallest sheet of tissue paper, shocked and horrified her to the core: it was Mrs. Periwinkle. She hesitated in picking her up; it may have been sabotaged. The stuffed rabbit was hardly stuffed anymore; the micro beads that sat inside its tummy were long ago squashed and worn away to nothing. Sadly, it was no longer fluffy either. Its once soft synthetic fur was now matted and dirty and dull. She moved to hold it up to her face, but was horrified to find that as she did so, the left eye came out. Any feelings of happiness or regret towards him immediately ceased, and were replaced with feelings of sadness and anger. She held the rabbit up to her chest, squeezing tightly. She now officially hated him. 5. After they moved, she was much happier. She spent seven long and lovely years attending a new school district, with new people and new friends. She no longer cried herself to sleep, or felt a terrible knot in her stomach, or lived in constant fear of what was in store for her the next day. And then her parents told her they were moving. Again. Back to their old neighborhood, nonetheless. She couldn't help arguing, fighting them every step of the way on the matter. She calmed down after a few days. Her mother had comforted her with the fact that it had been so long, he may not even live there anymore. Everyone moved out of that house eventually. He probably didn't live there anymore, and she was just paranoid. At least, that's what she told herself. 6. When they hopped out of the moving truck, she took a look at their 'new' home. It was the one she had grown up in. The exact. Same. One. Right across the street from him. She nearly fainted. 7. On her first day of school as a sophomore, she glanced at the house across the street. It certainly didn't look vacant. She eyed the black Mustang in the driveway before getting on the bus. She felt an onslaught of butterflies and her stomach lurched uneasily as the bus driver began to pull away. She nervously searched the faces as she sat down in her seat, failing to find anyone resembling him. It was fourth grade all over again. 8. She had made it through an entire week of school before she saw him. She was sitting in a corner in the library, trying to study for a test, when he walked by her table. He didn't recognize her. He looked at her as he passed by, and he didn't seem to have the faintest clue as to who she was. She hadn't seen him in years, but she knew . His face had matured greatly, but he still had a hint of boyishness to his features. His hair was virtually the same, and it was that prominent feature that gave him away. It was him. Their eyes met, and as he regarded her coolly as he passed by she recognized the unmistakable glint they held. They reminded her of a cold knife. 9. She noticed him every day at school after that. She later learned that it was his Mustang that sat in the driveway, and that his parents were more often than not 'away' on business trips. She wondered how he got around, living by himself like that, and she was shocked to find that he was a year older than her; technically an adult. He may not have recognized her, but she avoided him like black plague. She was always going out of her way to stay away from him. It was taxing, and it wore her down faster than she could imagine, but it was worth it. She may not have been able to make any friends, but it was worth it. Her grades may have slipped, but it was worth it. Anything to stay away from him. 10. It was on a Monday when her death sentence came. In Science. The teacher was assigning partners for a project, which would count for 70% of their final grade. Her name was called. She stood up, hoping that they would shout out a 'Danny' or 'Rachel', anyone besides the one person she had worked so hard to steer clear of, and that she could quell the fear and nausea pitted in the bottom of her stomach. Her hopes were in vain. The teacher called out his name. He stood up, and her stomach plummeted, her insides clenching painfully in terrible discomfort. He walked over to her work station, and she stood stalk still, rigid and frozen in her spot, unable to even turn her head and face him. She began to sweat. She numbly sat down, too afraid to even look him in the eye. She felt like puking. 11. She avoided him like Death now, even going so far as to skip out on lunch, instead hiding in the bathroom until her next class. She dreaded the thought of having to spend time with her tormentor, but she knew it was inevitable. She couldn't fail a grade just because she was scared to death of her new lab partner. Her parents wouldn't let her. It didn't stop her, however, from trying. 12. She had avoided him for so long that it had caused him to have to track her down and find her. He had cornered her in the library, seeming very annoyed, and told her they needed to get started on their project. He looked her straight in the eyes the entire time, seeming to have no recollection of who she was, but she didn't dare look at him. Not once. She couldn't. Not with his penetrating stare and calculating gaze. Somehow she knew, that if she looked at him - even once - he would know. 13. She wasn't quite sure how, but she had somehow managed to convince him to come to her house for their project. She didn't remember what she'd said, or even that her lips moved at all, but he agreed. She was sure he thought her strange - she was always quiet and looked at the floor when around him - so she was surprised when he had said yes. She supposed that they were so far behind (because she had held it off for so long) that perhaps he just didn't care and wanted to get it over with as quickly as possible. She realized later that maybe the library would have been a better choice - going to her house may incidentally jog his memory, and the last thing she wanted was for him to resume his torment on the victim who got away - but quickly disposed of the thought because, after all, her parents would be there. Nothing bad ever happened when she was around her parents. She would be better off at home, in familiar territory. She felt safer already. 14. Their first study session did not go particularly well. He had assumed that she had chosen her place because she already had all of the materials needed for their project. This was not the case. They spent over an hour in her room, at her desk, attempting to brainstorm but failing miserably. It became apparent that he was frustrated by her overly quietness and lack of input, so when he tried to challenge her on an idea for the project he just ended up arguing with himself. At the end of the day, they could only agree on one thing: what they were going to do for their project. It would be an erupting volcano, cliche as it was. It was simple, easy, sure to get a passing grade. But most of all it was something that didn't require a whole lot of teamwork. They could both go their separate ways in constructing it without having to be around each other a whole lot, and that sounded good to her. When he left that day, angry and frustrated and annoyed, she couldn't help but feel the exact opposite of those things. She watched from her bedroom window as he crossed the street to his house, and let out a breath she'd been holding since thirty seconds ago. He was finally gone. She could have cried with relief. 15. Another week passed and things were going as planned. She couldn't avoid him anymore at school, as he had already found all of her hiding places, and she saw him much more often. They never talked or chatted, and he made no effort to. Occasionally he would ask her about something related to their project, to which she would give the shortest, most efficient answer possible. She began to grow slightly more comfortable in his presence. He never teased or pranked her, and she saw him do no such thing to any of the other students, but he had a cold countenance about him, as if surrounded by a layer of ice, and she was still wary. She figured that if he hadn't recognized her by now, he never would, and her guard dropped ever so slightly, by the smallest degree, to the point where she no longer tensed when he came within walking distance of her. She would never, however, hold tight to the idea that he had changed. 16. It was a Tuesday, she remembered, when things started to go south. They were nearing the end of their project, and he had suggested they go to his place instead of hers - he already had everything they needed, and it would be silly and time-consuming to move everything from his house to hers. She remembered a bad feeling in her stomach, like she knew that it was a bad idea, a road that could lead nowhere good, but she had (reluctantly) agreed. When she finally got the courage to go outside, walk across the street, and knock on his door, she felt - even more than before - that it was a terrible mistake. She was thinking heavily about running back across the road, to safety, when he opened the door. She kept her eyes down as he silently looked her over, and there was a distinctly irritable sigh on his end before he let her in. He led her upstairs and into what she could only assume was his bedroom. She tried not to look around too much, but she had never had the pleasure (or displeasure) of seeing inside her enemy's fortress. She was not amazed or astounded at how clean and expensive everything looked - it was the suburbs, after all - but she wondered how much it had changed over the years. Was it like this seven years ago? Her musings were cut short as she came to face his desk, their work station for the project. It was laden with all sorts of items and tools and directions. She noted that there was only one chair to sit in, and she had wondered if he had expected her to stand the entire time they built the volcano, but her thoughts were halted when he suddenly went downstairs and disappeared for a few minutes. He reappeared in the doorway, shuffling past her with a chair in hand. He set it beside his, and motioned for her to sit down. She silently obeyed, keeping her eyes on the chair. They had been working efficiently for about an hour, if she remembered correctly, when the incident happened. She had dropped something - whether it was paper, clay, or something else entirely, she couldn't remember - and they had both bent down below the desk to pick it up. She let him reach for it, and was about to stand back up when he suddenly held it out to her in an attempt to hand it back. She sat crouched, unmoving, staring at the object he held - it may have been a pencil; she remembered it being small - and then she made the dreaded mistake. She looked at him. His eyes widened considerably when she did this, probably in shock, because she hadn't looked him in the eye since the day she had discovered him in the library for the first time. They both stared, frozen in their places, and she felt an onslaught of self consciousness as he snapped out of his daze and began roaming his eyes over her face, quickly studying every feature as though he would never get the chance to do so again. And then it happened. Suddenly his gaze snapped back to her eyes, and his own widened further in recognition. And she could tell that, in that moment, he knew. He knew who she was, knew what he had done to her, remembered. She sat there, stomach moving to her throat, and time paused for a few agonizing seconds. And then, snapping back to reality, she gathered herself, stood up, and turned. She ran. 17. She was able to avoid him for four days after that. She took extra special care in staying away from the places he frequented, and extra extra special care in blending in with the crowd at the places she couldn't avoid him, like the cafeteria. Class was no problem, because there could be no talking or conversing in the first place, but she knew that she couldn't keep it up forever. And she was right. 18. He confronted her on the seventh day, in the library. He had cornered her much the same way as he had before, when she put off doing their project together for as long as she could. He had looked very determined, she remembered, and she, she was sure, looked very frightened. She contemplated running, or screaming, or yelling for help; anything that would get him away from her. But she stood frozen, heart hammering hard in her chest, watching as he purposely stalked up to her. He came to stand about a foot away from her, face serious as she all but trembled before him, hand shaking slightly as she slowly put back a book she was thinking about reading. She wasn't really sure why she was so afraid of him; maybe it was because now that they were grown he was just so much bigger than her, or perhaps because of all of the emotional trauma she suffered at his hands as a child. Whatever the case, she was scared beyond belief, and she waited with bated breath as he contemplated what to say. What he did surprised her. Crossing the border of distance between them, he reached out to the shelf of books beside her, delved his hand in between the many titles, and pulled out the book she had been holding not five minutes ago. He brought it back to his side of the invisible barrier that separated them, briefly turned it over in his hands, and inspected it. He held it out to her, and after a few seconds she hesitantly took it. \"It's a good book.\" He'd said. And then he brisquely turned around, and walked off. She let out the breath that had threatened to burst her lungs, and after he had disappeared from sight she looked down at the cover: Jane Eyre. She wondered when he had developed even the slightest interest in literature, and even more so a liking for contemporary romance novels. She moved to put it back, untrusting of his taste in books, but something - she wasn't sure what - made her pause, then slowly reel it back into her arms. Then, on a whim, she walked over to the librarian, pulled out her card, and checked it out. She enjoyed the book very much. Once she had cracked it open she found that she couldn't put it down. It took her three days to read it. It probably would have been one if she had been able to settle down with it over the weekend, but this was not the case. She read it every chance she got; on the school bus, at lunch, in the library. When she was finished, she actually felt the urge to read it again. But then she thought of him. And the mere fact that he had recommended it to her - save the fact that she had already been considering checking it out herself - stayed her hand. She took it back that very same day. 19. The next time they crossed paths, she noticed a very inherent difference in his behavior. She had been late in getting to class that day, and just as she ran to catch the closing door, he appeared from inside the classroom. He said nothing, holding the door for her as she caught up. She almost immediately slowed her pace, but not in fear. She felt the oncoming wave of confusion wash over her as she came up to him, stopping just a few feet away as she stared at him. This time it was he who kept his eyes down, and as she studied him coolly she noticed that his usual aura of distance and coldness had all but evaporated. She took a step, paused, and went inside. 20. Over the next few days he continued to surprise her. If he didn't hold the door for her one day, he would hold her books for her the next. He gave her much more space, no longer hunting her down whenever he needed something - usually input for their project. He had started to send her little smiles whenever they saw each other, and once he had even complimented her hair. It had gotten to the point where, over time, it was almost expected of him to be courteous to her. And that scared her. 21. After giving it more thought, she started to become more anxious of him. What if it was a trick? She wouldn't initially think him to be so cunning, but she also wouldn't put it past him. As the days passed, she grew more and more suspicious of his intentions, and over the weekend, when she had all of her thoughts to herself - when she really had time to think -she was convinced he was the Devil. She tried to calm herself down before Monday came, but she was able to do little more than work up a stomach ache. When morning came, and she found herself staring cautiously at him as he held the door for her, she had spiraled her nerves into a train wreck. She felt a nervous sweat come on whenever he walked by, and she dreaded the very thought of having to keep her guard up for an oncoming attack. Her stomach was in so many knots she wasn't sure if she would have to make a dash for the bathroom - or the trashcan. In the end she made it through the day. But just barely. 22. He came to talk to her after the third day. They were eating outside that day, just behind the school, when he had walked up to her table. He hesitated, as though unsure of himself, before sitting down across from her. He was quiet, lacing his hands together in front of him as he looked down at the table. She wondered what it was that warranted breaking the unspoken boundary between them, but she already knew. Finally, he opened his mouth. \"What are we going to do about the project?\" Honestly, she didn't know. She knew what she wanted to do, and that was to forget about the entire thing and run far away. But that would never come to fruition. So, she said the only thing that came to mind: the truth. \"I don't know.\" He spoke again, quicker this time, surer of what he was going to say. \"We need to finish it.\" Somehow, stating the obvious spoke more volumes to her than anything else ever could. She still wanted to run, to be free of his presence - the constant irritation in her side - but she knew that he was right. She needed to be rid of this beast, to kill it, to get it over and done with. She replied in all seriousness: \"Okay.\" 23. They met after school every day after that, to work on their project. It felt as though a weight had been lifted, and she found that in the coming days, it was much easier to be around him. They still met at his house, and for some unknown reason she was fine with this. They worked and worked and worked, and it ended up taking them three days to get it just right. They had ruined the first volcano, and it set them back until he could go out and get more supplies. They were nearly finished when it happened. She was checking things over to make sure they had done everything right, waiting for him to come back from the bathroom. She was very focused on a particular section of the volcano, and she hadn't noticed him come back in. She had leaned back away from their finished work when she suddenly felt a chill. She froze as it ran up her spine, feeling a presence - his presence - behind her. She got that feeling that one often gets when they enter a potentially dangerous situation; when the air changes, and the hairs on the back of their neck stand on end, as if the whole room is electrified, and they're just waiting for the moment when they get shocked, burned, fried. She remembers distinctly the feeling of her neck hairs prickling as she felt his breath hit the side of her neck, moving up to her chin, her cheek, her ear. She was unsure what to do, so she stayed silent, still and unmoving. Time passed, and as she waited for him to do something, she wondered if he wasn't exactly sure himself what he was going to do. And just when she was about to open her mouth, to ask what it was that he wanted, he spoke. His choice of words startled her, but their impact shocked her to the core. \"I'm sorry.\" It took her all of two seconds to process the words, and almost immediately her walls crumbled. Her eyes welled, her throat constricted, her shoulders trembled. She let out the breath she'd been holding as the first tear fell, the careful barriers she'd built to protect herself over the years falling along with it. It wasn't the words themselves that moved her so - anyone can say they're sorry - but the way he had said them, as though he had really meant them. And as more tears and wracking sobs came, she knew that he was, indeed, really, truly sorry. Another sob came, and she gasped, sniffling furiously at her suddenly loose nose. A pair of arms encircled her waist and she was slowly rotated around to face him, her tear-filled eyes obscuring him from view. Then he surprised her again. Swiftly but gently she was pulled to him, and as she buried her face in his shirt, she cried harder. He wrapped his arms around her, holding her tight, and she didn't object. They stood there for what seemed like forever, and he rubbed her back as she soaked his shirt, neither of them speaking. After a while her legs grew weary, and she sunk to the floor, taking him with her. He pulled her into his lap, weaving a hand into her hair as he gently rocked back and forth, cradling her. By now her tears had ceased, and she concentrated on evening out her breathing. They sat together for hours - or what felt like hours - listening to the tick of the clock that rested on the wall. They remained silent, neither willing to break the sudden peace that overcame them. She was too tired for conversation anyway, and even if she weren't she didn't know what she would say. It was getting late, she knew, and her parents were probably getting worried. But in truth, she didn't want to leave. She felt at peace; content, here, sitting on his bedroom floor. She felt a new wave of tears coming on, but this time of the happy kind. And in that moment, as she rested her head on his shoulder and wrapped her arms around his back, nothing else mattered. He was sorry. End.~ A/N: Not quite sure if I should have ended it here, but this feels right to me and I feel like it's long enough. I'll extend it if you want me to, but for now I'll just end it here. Maggie's a lot weaker here, and Terry's a lot less mean, but like I said this is an alternate take on them (and totally OOC) so whatever. Do you think this counts as one of those fanfic off-canon warnings for a 'gentle!Terry'? Lol XD I don't know crap about making an erupting volcano, or if that would even qualify as fair game for a high school science project (probably not) but whatever, it's done. Anyway, I'll have Terry's POV up soon, and then it'll be finished. Feel free to fave or review, or whatever it is that you do. Lol. 'Til next time, Nikkette~[Chapter 2] A/N: Chapter two. Basically just Terry's POV of the first chapter, so there'll be the same amount of breaks. Personally I prefer reading from the dude's perspective, but that's just me *shrugs* Disclaimer: I do not own Drillbit Taylor. Or G. I. Joe. Chapter 2: Him~ 1. He was seven and a half when he first saw her. They were pulling up to their new house when he noticed her playing across the street. He stood by his parents as they began to unload from the moving truck, watching her curiously. He watched as she repositioned one of her dolls into an upright stature, and began pouring invisible tea into a plastic pot. He remembered feeling strange, almost entranced, as he observed the scene before him. Then he noticed the little thing she was holding in her arms. It was soft and shiny and fluffy and it stood out from all the other toys crowded around her fake, imaginary table. And he wanted it. He didn't remember asking his parents if he could go to see her, just looking both ways before crossing the street. He does remember, however, eyeing the stuffed thing in her hands as he sauntered up to her. As he crossed the street he became aware of how... happy, she looked to see him. And that threw him off. He skidded to a halt just at the edge of the curb, suddenly feeling no desire whatsoever to be any closer to her than he already was. He had planned to...well, he wasn't really sure - he hadn't thought ahead that far. But he knew one thing; he wanted that plushie. She came to stand just in front of him, looking expectantly at him, and he saw his chance. So, without thinking, he snatched the fluffy treasure from her arms and ran back to his parents to safety. He went inside to explore his new house, not looking back at the girl. Once he picked out his room, he went inside, shut the door and sat on the hardwood floor to examine his find. It was a stuffed bunny with ridiculously floppy ears, and he wasn't sure what to do with it now; he really didn't even want it anymore, now that she didn't have it. And it was pink. He didn't like pink. 2. It was his first day of school when he saw her next. The teacher was introducing him to the class. He was looking at the children surrounding what would soon be his desk when he noticed her sitting towards the back. Her eyes were wide and her mouth shut tight, and he immediately thought back to the stuffed animal he had stolen. He smiled. 3. He saw her nearly every day after that. He wasn't sure why, but he loved to pick on her. He would spend his days executing schemes and pranks, and his weekends thinking up more. He would give her noogies and tickle her until she cried and make fun of her looks and give her 'gifts' with bugs inside them. It wasn't that he hated her; it was quite the opposite, actually - he would even go so far as to say she was his friend. But he loved to poke fun, and there was no stopping that. It was on the last week of May, he remembered, when everything changed. He had caught wind that her birthday was coming up. He spent the rest of the day wondering what he could get her; he didn't know what she liked, and at ten years old he certainly didn't have any money, but he still tried to think of something, anything, he could give her. He was in his bedroom doing homework when it came to him. He had rested his head against his desk, tired from all the work, and gazed lazily over at the pile of toys in the corner. Then he saw it: the bunny. He didn't really want it anymore, but he was afraid that if he threw it away his mother would find it in the garbage and question him about it. And so it stayed, locked away in his room, for roughly three years. He went over and picked it up, squeezing its tummy. It was old and worn - he had used it multiple times as target practice for his G. I. Joes - but he was sure that, even after all this time, she would still want it back. It was decided: this would be his gift. And so, without further ado, he scampered downstairs for the wrapping paper and tape. When his mother walked him across the street to her house, he suddenly felt nervous. He wasn't sure why; he was sure she would like it. But he couldn't help thinking that maybe she wouldn't. Her mother answered the door, and as she exchanged words with his mother he peered into the room at her. She caught him staring and he, embarrassed, glared before looking away and hiding behind his mother's legs. Her mother took his gift and shut the door. 4. He didn't see her the next day. He spent the entirety of his school hours wondering, worrying, hoping she liked his gift. Surely she would have been elated to be reunited with her childhood plushie. But maybe not. Maybe she would think it was stupid, or maybe she had gotten a newer, better one, and she didn't need it anymore. Maybe. 5. She wasn't there the next day, either. Or the next. And as he noticed her absence at school, he also noticed how plain her front yard was, how empty and barren her house looked. He had just got home from school when he heard his parents talking - about her. Apparently she had moved away, and they were speculating on the best way to break the news to him. As he went to sleep that night, he thought, puzzled at what he would have to look forward to at school now that she was gone. He wondered if he would ever see her again. 6. It was seven years later when he would again lay eyes on her. He was eighteen now, and he had spent the last seven years skimping by on school, friends, and life. He had his own car now, and his parents had recently gone on a business trip to China for a few months, leaving him to his own devices in an empty house. He should have been thrilled at the thought of the absence of parental control, but he found that, if anything, it just felt boring. The only thing that was half interesting was the new neighbors he was soon to have. People had moved in and out of the house across the street for years, and every one of them never stayed for more than a year. He moved the curtains aside to look out the window at the moving van on the other side of the street. There were two adults, a man and a woman, and a young girl, probably around his age. They looked no different than any of the others that had moved in before them. They would be gone soon enough. 7. He decided to stay home from school the next day. He figured that with his parents gone, this was something that an average teenager would do. He expected to feel happy or as though he had gotten away with murder. Or something. But in truth, it felt the same as any other day, just with a change of scenery. The school bus pulled up, and he peeked out the window. The girl from yesterday - the one that had just moved in - was there, waiting at the curb. She was staring at the car, his car, that sat parked in the driveway. She then looked to the window he was staring out of, and he wondered if she could see him. The bus driver opened the doors, and she stepped inside. He thought nothing of it. 8. He saw her again the next week. He was at school - in the library to be exact - and he was searching for a book on the Civil War. He began to round a corner when he noticed her sitting alone in a corner. Their eyes met, and she looked at him as though she were seeing a ghost. He looked at her coolly, not stopping as he rounded the corner into one of the aisles, breaking their eye contact. He didn't know her, and he couldn't understand why she had looked at him like that. It unsettled him. 9. He didn't see her for a long time after that. He was curious, and wondered where she was from time to time, but he was in no position to track her down. He still noticed her in class from time to time, but outside the classroom she seemed to vanish without a trace. He never exactly looked very hard, but he never could seem to find her after class let out. He had his suspicions that it had something to do with their encounter in the library. He wondered. 10. It was a Monday when he noticed her again. The teacher was assigning science partners for a big project - it would count for a large percentage of their overall grade, and would more or less determine whether or not they graduated. Her name was called, she stood up. He couldn't help but feel a strong sense of familiarity at the ring of her name; where had he heard it before? His name was called. He stood up, and sat down next to her. They would be spending a lot more time together. 11. He didn't see her for over a week after that. He wasn't sure if it was because she didn't like him or they just kept missing each other. But in a public school, where hundreds of kids were forced to be around some of their most hated enemies, whether they liked it or not, the latter was rather unlikely. He decided on the former. 12. It was getting ridiculous, the lengths she was going to to avoid him. He dedicated the rest of his free time into tracking her down. If they didn't start on their project soon, it would be too late, and then they would both fail. And he couldn't let that happen. He found her in the library. He had to all but corner her into listening to him. As he told her that they needed to get started on their project, he noticed that she consistently kept her eyes on the floor. She listened, but she wouldn't look at him. Not once. It irked him. 13. They had finally come to an agreement. She had proposed that they go to her house for the project; he agreed. He couldn't help but think she was strange; she was quiet - unnaturally so - and every time he tried to talk to her she kept her head down, refusing to look at him. The more he thought about it the more it annoyed him - the more she annoyed him. But they needed to get this done. So he stayed silent. But it only went downhill from there. 14. Their first official study session went terribly. She didn't have a scrap of material that could be used for the project, and they spent forever trying to brainstorm with little success. He couldn't stop from getting irritated with her quietness and lack of input. He couldn't even have an argument properly. By the time it was over, they had only come to a single agreement: what they were going to do for their project. It would be an erupting volcano, dumb as it sounded. It was easy, plain and simple, and it was an almost guarantee that they would both graduate. But more importantly, he wouldn't have to spend a whole lot of time around her. It wasn't that he hated her or anything, he just figured it would work out better for the both of them if they didn't spend any more time around each other than necessary. And that was fine with him. 15. A week had passed without a hitch. She still tried to avoid him at school, but he had found all of her little hiding places, and she soon learned that resistance was futile. Eventually it became routine: they would go through school together, he would flag her down to run something project-related by her, and they would meet up at her place later. They never had any real conversations, but it wasn't like he ever really tried. Over time they grew used to each other, and he daresay they were now at a comfortable silence - a much appreciated step up from tense and awkward. She still wasn't any more talkative, and she still refused to look him in the eye, but rather than harp on her for it, he decided that it was probably nothing more than a silly quirk. Besides, he liked where they were at now, with their friendly mutual silences, and he didn't want to lose it. He could manage. He simply accepted it. 16. Unfortunately, things began to go south. They were almost done with their project - 'almost' meaning that they still had to get the materials and build it - and she had - albeit reluctantly - agreed to his suggestion to finish it at his house. He told her that it was because he already had all of the supplies they needed, which was true, but in fact it was because he didn't like the way her parents looked at him, like he was the most vile thing on Earth. After he had sped home from school that day, he went upstairs to clean up his room. Granted, she probably wouldn't say anything, but the last thing he needed was for her to go home and gossip to her parents about how filthy he was. It was nearly two hours later - far past the time it took for him to tidy up - when she knocked on his door. He had been in the middle of a game when she finally decided to show. He annoyingly swung the door open, and he noticed how scared she looked. He then realized how angry he probably looked himself - he would have apologized, but held back on account of her being so late. Instead he let out a sigh, and, stepping aside, let her inside. It became apparent to him that she was quieter than usual, and she was keeping a safer distance from him than before. This angered him because it made him feel guilty for earlier. He led her upstairs to his room, then disappeared to get her a chair from the dining room. He came back, chair in hand, and set it beside his at their workstation: his desk. He motioned for her to sit down, and she visibly hesitated before taking a seat. They worked for about an hour or so without incident, but it didn't last. She had been jotting down notes while he worked when she dropped her pen. It fell underneath the desk, and they both leaned down to get it. He got to it first, and as he picked it up he turned to give it back to her. It was then that he noticed something terribly amiss: she was looking at him. His eyes widened. A lot. Aside from that first day at the library, she had never - ever - looked at him. But that wasn't like this. In fact it was far different up close, a whole different experience. Realizing this may never happen again, it took him all of two seconds to come back from his shock and practically rake his eyes over her face. He studied every feature, every inch of skin that spread over her skull, and put to memory the shape of her nose, eyes, lips, everything. She was actually quite beautiful. He wasn't sure why - maybe it was the way she kept her head down all the time - but he had always thought- assumed , that she was rather plain. He was very wrong. His eyes landed back on hers, and it was then that he realized. A very strong feeling of familiarity came over him, and the more he stared, studied, observed, the more it became apparent that he had, in fact, seen her before. He looked at her and he recognized, knew, who she was. Everything from his childhood years ago came flooding back, and with it, the memories of her. He continued to stare, and it was then that she panicked. Abruptly getting up, she backed away from him, a panicked expression on her face, and without so much as a word, a signal, or even a gesture, ran out of the room. He dropped the pen, and everything hit him like a ton of bricks. He sat there long afterwards, thinking about the girl he had known all those years ago, the pen long forgotten. 17. She avoided him for days after that. The only time he saw her was in class, and even then she was hard to spot. He gave her her space for those few days; he needed time to think things through himself. When those days were up, however, he had every intention of talking things over with her. Even if he had to burn the whole school down to do it. 18. After the sixth day he decided she had had enough time to herself. He tracked her down to the library. She was in one of the back aisles, looking at a book. She noticed him almost immediately, and with his cover blown, he began to walk up to her. She looked as though she might run, or scream, or yell, and he hurried to catch up to her before any of those things could happen. He came to stand in front of her, and he noticed her hand shaking as she put back the book she was holding. Suddenly he didn't know what to do. He wasn't sure what he should do or say, or if he should do nothing at all. She was scared to death, that much was for sure. What he decided on surprised not just him, but apparently her, too. He reached beside her and pulled out the book she had been holding, ignoring her flinch. He examined the title. Jane Eyre. He remembered reading it for tenth grade. He briefly turned it over in his hands before handing it to her. \"It's a good book.\" He said simply, giving her a lopsided half-smile. And with nothing more to say, he turned around, and left. 19. When he saw her the following Monday, he had decided to make an effort to be as nice as possible. He had given it much thought over the weekend, and he had come to the conclusion that the best way for her to forget about who he used to be and accept who he was now was for him to be as friendly and courteous as he was capable of. And so, when everyone was crowding into Science, and she was lagging behind, he executed his first of many good deeds: he held the door for her. She looked suspicious, very suspicious, and rightfully so, he supposed. But he had to prove himself, and she had to get to class. She accepted. As she walked by him with all the caution of an injured animal, he couldn't help but notice how nice she smelled. It was in that moment that he realized just how close they really hadn't been over the past few weeks - he didn't even know she had a scent. And he was going to try his damnest to fix that. 20. He kept up his gallantry very well. He was rather impressed with himself. It took some mustering, but he found that it wasn't nearly as difficult to be nice (consistently so, that is) as he had previously expected. After he had held the door for her, it seemed as though he had opened one for himself, with all kinds of possibilities that had before been locked. Sometimes she would try to dodge his chivalry; she would be the first one to class so he couldn't hold the door, or act like she didn't hear him when he complimented her, or look away when he smiled at her. But he knew that, in reality, he was wearing her down. It wouldn't be long now. 21. He wasn't sure when, but somewhere along the line, something went wrong. As the days progressed, she began to withdraw from his kindness. She would hesitate to accept any form of help he offered, and all of his efforts seemed to gradually have been put in reverse. It was then that he realized he was being too nice, trying too hard. She was slipping back into her previous state of distrust, and it was all because he didn't seem genuine enough. He had to fix it. He just didn't know how. 22. He left her alone for a while after his realization. He gave her three long days of reprieve from his presence. He decided to try and talk to her on the fourth day. He sat down at her table at lunch. He didn't say anything at first - he really didn't know what to say. After giving it some thought and coming up with nothing, however, he said the first (and only) logical thing that came to mind. \"What are we going to do about the project?\" She said nothing at first, and he wondered if she would even bother stressing her vocal chords on him at all. \"I don't know.\" He visibly deflated with relief at her words; not so much the words themselves, but the fact that she agreed to speak at all. With this knowledge in mind, his next sentence came much more easily. \"We need to finish it.\" For a second she looked as if she was going to bolt, and for a split second he panicked, but she regained herself as quickly as the look came, and she replied, \"Okay.\" 23. They met up with each other every day after that to work on their project. The atmosphere around them was far more peaceful, the tenseness all but dissipated, and he knew that they were on the right track again. They continued to meet at his house, an unspoken agreement between them, and he was surprised to find that she was okay with this. And in turn, that was perfectly fine with him. They accidentally ruined their first miserable excuse of a volcano, so he had to buy all of the supplies all over again and rebuild it from scratch. It took them three days to get it just right. He was silently amazed at how fast they could work together when there wasn't any hostility hanging over them. They were both putting the finishing touches on their newer, better volcano when it happened. She was checking everything over, making sure they had done everything right, when he left to go to the bathroom. He was washing his hands when he was suddenly hit with a pang of guilt. He thought of all the things he had done to her, all those years ago, and he suddenly felt awful, like the most vile thing on the planet. And when he thought about it, he guessed he was. He stood there for a while, though it couldn't have been more than a few minutes, thinking about how no matter what he did, how nice he acted, or good he seemed, it would all mean nothing if he didn't acknowledge what he had done to her, and how lucky he was that she had tolerated him so far. It was ridiculous how guilty he felt all at once, all of the sudden. Maybe it was because he had put so much energy into changing who he was, into forgetting who he used to be. But none of that mattered now - what mattered was that he had treated a little girl terribly, and she was waiting for him in the next room. And he realized that, if nothing else, it was imperative: He needed to apologize. He exited the bathroom, and moved to stand in the doorway of his room, hesitant to go in. She was standing right where he left her, looking over their project. Her back was to him, and he could tell that she hadn't noticed him yet. Slowly he entered the room, unsure of what exactly he was going to do or say. He came to stand just behind her, and after a moment she froze, and he knew that she knew he was there. She stood frozen, and so did he. He wanted to back away, to take it back, reverse time, but he couldn't. He needed this. They both did. He leaned in closer, breath increasing slightly in panic at not knowing what he was supposed to do, and moved his lips up to her ear. This was it; the moment that would make or break everything. He started to sweat in nervousness, trying to think of the right words to say. He swallowed. \"I'm sorry.\" A second passed, and he was starting to feel a little bit better, that he had chosen the right words. And then she began to cry. Her body began shaking, and any sense of feeling like he had done right crumbled. He watched in a panic as she let out a shaky breath, and as another sob came he didn't know what to do. He stood there behind her, frozen in place, and it seemed like an age before it became obvious what she was expecting from him. Slow and unsure, he wrapped his arms around her middle and turned her to face him. He pulled her to him, and she all but threw herself at him, burying her face in his shirt, the speed and strength of which scared him. He held her tight, and when she cried even harder he almost let her go, panicked at the thought that she didn't want him to. So they stood there, him rubbing comforting circles on her back and she soaking his shirt with snot and tears, both silent and unwilling to break what they had at the moment: understanding. They held their places for a very long time, and after a while she was crying so hard that her legs began to shake - whether from emotional or physical wear, he didn't know. Slowly she sunk to the floor, and he was again surprised at her strength as she pulled him down with her. Again he was unsure of what to do - of what she would want him to do - but he knew enough to know that she needed to be comforted. Hesitating for a moment, he reached out and pulled her into his lap, weaving a hand into her hair as he began to gently rock back and forth, cradling her. As the minutes passed she stopped crying, and he was relieved to find that her breathing was beginning to even out. They sat like that for hours on end - or what felt like hours on end - listening to the ticking of the clock that rested on the wall. They still hadn't spoken to each other; neither of them wanted to cut the thin wall of peace that surrounded them. Even if they could speak he wouldn't know what to say, and he had a feeling that she felt the same way. It was pretty late by now, and he was probably going to catch hell from her parents for keeping her so long, but he didn't care. He felt far too content - at peace, even - sitting right there, on his musty wooden bedroom floor with her. And in that moment, as she rested her head on his shoulder and wrapped her arms around his back, nothing else mattered anyway. She forgave him. End.~ A/N: I really hate fanfiction's document manager.

This chapter mainly focuses on Filkins and what he does on a typical lonely afternoon. :P Song suggestion for this chapter is; Lazy Bones by Green Day (although the song does have some strong language though). Hope you enjoy. Disclaimer: I Don't Own Drillbit Taylor. A Lonesome Afternoon - Terry lay on his couch, his head on a pillow, arm hanging lazily over the side, staring mindlessly at the plasma screen t.v. in front of him...pretty much bored to death. And not because he'd lost the remote hours ago, and had himself stuck watching a long, pointless, infomercial, but because he seriously didn't have anything better do. At least, not without Ronnie around. On a normal Sunday afternoon, the two of them would be hanging out, riding around town, preying on nerds, hitting on chicks, and grabbing a bite to eat at their favorite burger joint. But today, Ronnie had some lame 'family outing' to attend, which left Terry high and dry, watching t.v. in his living room all by himself. He would've dug his cellphone out of his back pocket and called up some of his other buddies, but truthfully, he didn't have any. Other than Ronnie, Filkins didn't really have any other close friends. Sure, he knew some guys. But he wasn't as close with them as he was with Ronnie. They were the type of guys to call for a night filled with partying and beer. Not the kind you could just call up and hang out with. Most of 'em were pretty boring too. They would just ramble on and on about their girlfriends, and 'lady problems'. Something he himself couldn't really relate to. Yeah, Terry had a few chicks here and there, but they were only-for-the-moment deals. Never anything more. Most of them would get on his nerves within a matter of minutes, anyway. They were always way too chatty. Kept wanting to talk about 'feelings' and other pointless shit like that. And truth be told, he didn't need a girlfriend. Having one would require a lot of up-keep, something he really didn't have the time for. Although now, on an afternoon as sucky as this, he kinda wished he did have a girlfriend. Someone to blow up his cell phone with texts, beg for him to take them out someplace nice, or make-out with on his couch. Hell, even having someone to nag at him for something stupid sounded like fun right now. Anything would be better than sitting home alone, watching infomercials. \"URRRNNTTT!\" Sounded the buzzer from the washroom. Terry lazily lifted his head up from the couch pillow, none too excited about the fact that the dryer had finally finished its job with his clothes. Since his parents had moved to Hong Kong, he'd had to start taking care of himself. From buying groceries and making dinner, to washing dishes and his own pair of underwear, he now did it all. Grudgingly, of course, but he did it nonetheless. Filkins slowly got up from his spot on the couch, prolonging his fate of folding and putting away nearly every article of clothing that he owned. Though he knew his fate was inevitable, if he didn't do his own laundry, no one else would. Still, he couldn't help stalling the matter. When he finally made his way into the washroom, he immediately began unloading the dryer and carelessly tossing all the articles of clothing into a (more-or-less) clean hamper. Other than the sound of the t.v. coming from the other room, the whole house was filled with silence. And it left Terry feeling kinda depressed. Just the other day, him and Ronnie were laughing like mad, cleaning up scattered red solo cups, empty beer cans, and other party trash around the house, trying to recover from the previous night's party. Now look what he was doing. Terry tossed the last article of clothing into the hamper (a sock it looked like), along with a little square piece of fabric softener he had put in the load. But not before holding up said fabric softener to his nose to sniff. It was pretty much the only thing he liked about doing the laundry; getting to smell the fresh scent the fabric softener left behind. It just smelled so damn good. He hoisted the hamper up onto his shoulder to carry, and proceeded making his way down the hall and up the stairs to his room. He paused on the steps for a minute when his foot came into contact with a small, hard object. Although irritated at the sudden pain shooting through his foot, he was also curious as to what the hell the thing could possibly be. He thought for sure that him and Ronnie had cleaned everything up from the party yesterday. He slowly removed his foot from it, revealing a small, silver ring. How did that get there? Must've been from one of the chicks at the party, he figured. He stared at it, a brow raised, and bent down to pick it up, somehow managing to do so while balancing the hamper on his shoulder at the same time. He turned the ring over in his hand, looking at it from all angles, and spotted an engraving on the inside of it. Dakota, it read. Terry's brows furrowed in thought. Wait...did he read that right? He looked it over once more, and sure enough, it said Dakota . And if he wasn't mistaken, the very ring he held in his hand belonged to none other than Dakota Westers; a chick he knew from school. She was pretty hot too. Blonde hair, a pretty face, nice body, the whole package. He wondered where she'd been while she was at his house. He didn't remember seeing her at the party. Filkins dismissed the thought after a few moments, then put the ring in his pocket and continued making his way upstairs. It wasn't until he got in his room and started putting away his clothes that he realized how messy the rest of the room was. There were numerous items scattered all across the floor, including: a black hoodie, a pair of boots, an old pizza box, some CDs, candy wrappers, an old History essay (that was due weeks ago), and a pair of socks. Oh, and a pack of gum. He'd forgotten that when he and Ronnie were cleaning up the house his room was off limits. Now he kinda wished that it wasn't. Because then it would be clean. And not a freakin' trash dump. Terry groaned. It wouldn't get picked up if he didn't do it. It took him no more than five minutes to tidy up the place, but that didn't mean he enjoyed it. After he tossed the old pizza box in the trash, he remembered the ring he had in his pocket, and quickly dug it out to take another look at it. He absentmindedly wondered if she would want it back, or if she even realized that it was missing in the first place. Other than the engraving on the inside, there wasn't really anything special about it anyway. It was just a plain silver band. Probably got it from her boyfriend or something though, 'cause really, who in the Hell would get their own name engraved on a ring? It didn't matter to him though, he was just a little curious is all. He set the ring down on his dresser; he'd decide what to do with it later. He shuffled his way out his room and down the stairs. He was getting kinda hungry, so he figured he'd head to the kitchen. It shouldn't have been a surprise to discover that all the bowls and plates were dirty, but Terry was still shocked to see the stack of dishes in the sink, nearly a mile high. \"Shit...\" he muttered to himself. This day was going from bad to worse. After loading up the dishwasher, Terry rummaged through the fridge in search of something to eat. Finding nothing but ketchup, mustard, soda, a few slices of cheese, an expired half-gallon of milk, and a few tortilla wraps, he decided to just order a pizza. Sitting on one of the stools by the kitchen counter, Filkins waited impatiently for the food to arrive. Tapping his hands on the faux marbled counter surface, and bopping his head for no particular reason other than boredom. After about five minutes, the doorbell rang. Terry's head snapped up at the sound. There was no way the Pizza man could be there that quick...Right? He'd only just ordered a few minutes ago. Either way, he got up from his stool, and walked over to the front door. Which he quickly unlocked and carelessly flung open. Not-so-shockingly, it wasn't the Pizza man. In fact, it was another face that he had not been expecting to see for at least another day or so. Standing no more than a few feet ahead of him, was Ronnie. Damn, just the dude he wanted to see. \"Ronnie?\" Terry tilted his head disbelievingly. \"What are you doin' here? I thought you had a 'family outing' to attend.\" Ronnie glanced behind himself at the silver SUV in the drive-way, and Terry leaned out the door just in time to spot Mrs. Lampanelli waving to the both of them as she pulled back out onto the road. \"Yeah, about that 'family outing',\" Ronnie smirked, making air quotation marks with his fingers. Terry grinned back at him, and quickly ushered him inside the house. This was bound to be a hell of day with Ronnie in the house.[Chapter 2] A/N I suggest listening to the song Earthquake by Labrinth Ft. Tinie Tempah when reading this, I had it in mind when I wrote this. ;) Disclaimer: I Don't Own Drillbit Taylor, Twinkies, Hot Pockets, Doritos, or any other products and/or characters mentioned in this story. Smash Something - It was a typical late afternoon at Filkins's house. Ronnie had come over to hang out and play video games with Terry on his new Xbox 360, and binge on Doritos and Twinkies. They ended up playing Army of Two for about three hours straight, then took a short break from their gaming so Ronnie could go into the kitchen and pop a few hot pockets into the microwave to satisfy their hunger. Terry was still in the living room, secretly playing the game he'd 'paused', trying to figure out how in the hell to get to the next level, when he heard a loud crash come from the kitchen. \"Oh Jeez! \" Came an annoyed voice from the kitchen. Attention captured, Terry immediately paused their game and strained his ears to listen for any other sounds. \"Hey, Ronnie...\" Terry called from his spot on the couch. \"You break somethin'?\" Back in the kitchen, Ronnie was cringing over the shattered china plate before him, biting on his nail nervously. \"...Yeah...\" He called back sheepishly. Terry got up from his spot on the couch, deciding to check out the situation for himself. \"What was it?\" Ronnie bent down to pick up one of the larger pieces of the broken plate, and slowly turned it over in his hand. Even if he did manage to pick up all the shattered pieces, he'd never be able to glue it all back together. At least, not the right way. There were way too many weird patterns and details etched all over them, to be able to follow along with it correctly. \"Uh...just a plate,\" Ronnie said discreetly. Terry made his way into the kitchen. \"What kind of plate?\" he asked specifically. Ronnie shrugged. \"Ah, I don't know...\" He laughed nervously. Terry leaned himself against the door frame and crossed his arms impatiently, a single eyebrow raised. \"Some china?\" He said nervously, waving the large porcelain piece around in his hand. Terry was silent for a moment, as if thinking over what he was going to do to punish him for breaking his mom's china. He slowly made his way over to where Ronnie stood, and gave him a clap on the back. Ronnie flinched just before he did so, then shut his eyes and scrunched up his face, expecting a swat on the head for his clumsiness. But Terry did nothing of the sort. Instead, he threw back his head and cackled loudly, amused with the scene before him. \"MY GOD! You're such a klutz! \" He howled. Ronnie opened an eye and took a peek in his direction. Deciding there was no threat present, his muscles relaxed a little, and he exhaled deeply. \"Hahaha...\" Ronnie joined in uneasily. \"Did you actually think that I would give a shit about my mom's broken china?\" Terry teased, shaking him roughly, but playfully. \"Well, yeah, bro. Like you said; 'It's your mom's china', so-\" Ronnie was abruptly interrupted by Filkins snatching a random plate off the kitchen counter, and slamming it against the sink's faucet, shattering it into a million pieces in one loud CRASH! \"-W-wha?\" Ronnie stared at him, baffled. Terry grabbed another plate from the kitchen cupboard and threw it on the hard-tiled floor. Causing another loud CRASH! Now Ronnie was really confused. Was this some kind of game? Or was he just jerking his chain? Whatever the real reason, Ronnie followed suit and picked up a porcelain plate of his own, looking to Terry for advice. He nodded once in approval, then Ronnie's hand swung the dish in a downward motion on the corner of the kitchen counter. CRASH! Another broken plate. Ronnie chuckled lightly in enjoyment. It had been a while since he'd smashed something and felt good about it. And I mean, man , did he feel good! Truthfully, it was kinda therapeutic. He reached for another plate and smashed it in just the same way. Then before they knew it, they were picking up all sorts of plates and dishes, slamming them on the floor, throwing them at the walls, tossing them across the room like frisbees, and shattering them with other household objects like a bunch of unruly kids. And it was surprisingly more fun than playing video games on the Xbox 360. They went on tossing plates, bowls, cups, and just about anything they could get their hands on for about 10 minutes straight before finally running out of all breakable dishes (the rest were plastic), and by the time they were done, they sat themselves down on the tiled floor, backs against the dishwasher, laughing like there was no tomorrow. They had acquired a few cuts and wounds from such hard, breakable items, but it was all worth it. After a while, the laughter died down though, and Ronnie asked the one question that had to be lingering somewhere far back in both of their minds. \"Who's gonna clean this up?\" And despite the loud yells, hollering voices, and wholehearted laughter that they had shared only moments before, they now both fell silent.

Disclaimer: I Don't Own Drillbit Taylor Detention - Filkins glared at Mr. Taylor from across the room. He'd been stuck sitting at his desk for nearly an hour, staring boredly at the clock on the wall in front of him, waiting for Mr. Taylor to let him leave. He'd been kept after class for 'picking on' one of his classmates, but in all truth it was just a little razzing. Terry was already on a short fuse as it was, and him being kept after school on a Friday didn't help. \"You got something you want to say?\" Asked Mr. Taylor, peering from over the top of a romance novel he had in his hands. \"This is bullshit!\" Terry outbursted. \"Profanity!\" said Mr. Taylor, shaking his head. \"You just got yourself another hour of detention.\" \"Bit my ass, sub! \" Filkins bit out. \"Insubordination.\" Said Mr. Taylor, getting up from his seat. \"You want another one?\" He threatened, walking over to Terry. Filkins smiled. He knew he was trying to look intimidating, but the fact that all he had as a threat was giving him a few more hours of detention made him so much more pathetic than he already was. \"Keep going.\" said Mr. Taylor, kicking the empty chair in front of him to turn it around. Hilariously, the chair ended up being a lot heavier than it looked, and only moved a few inches from the contact his leg made. Mr. Taylor stared down at the object for a split second in embarrassment, then positioned the chair to face Terry. \"I got nothing to do.\" He said, seating himself in front of him. \"Believe me, I've got nothing to do.\" Terry leaned over his desk, and tilted his head. \"I'll keep you here all day, boy.\" Terry didn't believe him for a second. He knew Mr. Taylor hated being kept in that room about as much as he did. \"Yeah,\" Mr. Taylor nodded, as if his threat was actually valid. Filkins smirked, amused. If it was a challenge he was looking for, a challenge he would get. \"Till you learn.\" Filkins' smile stretched even wider. He'd figured that even a sub as dumb as Mr. Taylor would realize that learning wasn't his shtick. \"Okay-?\" He asked before cutting himself off as another teacher entered the room. It was an older woman with short, curly, brown hair. \"You have to leave. I've got a class here in five minutes.\" She said matter-of-factly. \"Right now?\" Mr. Taylor asked, looking at her from over his shoulder. \"Yeah.\" She confirmed, walking over to the teacher's desk, and setting down a few folders she had in her hands. Mr. Taylor turned his head back around to face Terry, and sighed disappointedly. Terry smirked victoriously, and bolted out of his seat before he was given the permission to go. Mr. Taylor turned around in his seat. \"But you owe me an hour, mister!\" When Terry reached the school parking lot, he spotted Ronnie leaning against the passenger door to his Mustang, hands in his pockets, a smile on his face. \"Yo, Ron what're you doin' here?\" \"You were my ride, man!\" Ronnie explained. \"What took you so long?\" \"Detention.\" Terry said shortly, swiping his keys from his front pocket, and unlocking the car. He may have been kept after class, but the day wasn't over yet. It was still a Friday, after all.

What did they expect me to do? Less than a day old and already my poor baby is put in danger. He is my only son and I will do anything to protect him. This is just so unfair! That vile little spawn dared to touch my child and they expected me to let it go unpunished. I'll admit, however, that I may have gotten a bit carried away that day. Normally I am the mildest temper compared to the others here, who take airs and act as though it is a privilege for this circus to have them. Fools! All of them! One mistake and they lock you away and throw away the key. If I'd known what would happen I would have spanked him a little harder. Maybe then he'd think twice next time he dares bully another helpless creature. Just thinking about him makes my blood boil anew. I barely know my child a day and already we were separated. Ohhh, what a cruel hand fate dealt to us? Fools they are to take my child away at such a delicate young age. I can't help but cry for the loss of time we face. And did they treat him well? No! They put him to work immediately in my stead without training and expected him not mess up. Fools! It a miracle he's still alive. Was he safe from the cruel judgment of my peers? Hardly, they sent him back among those harpies who not only abandon him but actively shun him. An innocent baby left alone to fend for himself, and it's a mouse of all creatures who offers him any kindness. It's not what I would have wished for but his seems to have done a satisfactory job in helping my Dumbo. Though after that act he came up with I'm tempted to stomp on him a few times as well as that idiot ring master. I could hear the screams of terror coming from the big top and, despite best my efforts otherwise, I was helpless but to pray for my baby's safety. It was a great relief when that mouse, Timothy, brought him by, and I still cry thinking about that bittersweet moment. It was precious and too short, but he was clearly exhausted and needed to be put to bed. After that things just seemed to get worse. I seriously think they were trying to kill him. My poor baby! How terrified he must felt. Then once again, I heard the screams from the tent and thought the worst. Only to learn he could fly! It's a miracle is all I can say and now looking back. I can't say things didn't turn out for the best. My son is a star and will never again be placed in such danger. But as I watch him carefully from our private quarters on the caboose, and far from those who once tormented my son, my only fear now is that I wish he wouldn't fly so high.

Mrs Jumbo kneels down and caresses his face. His eyes shine with a sudden brightness that startles her momentarily. His eyes sparkle like unblemished gems and the stars that were so bright that sad, sad night not too long ago. He giggles and shakes with quiet laughter.

Buell","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12451365","Passage":"[Chapter 1] Introduction The circus is pretty much what people do who want to do the impossible. Now a days, a circus can get criticism from animal activists who say that they don't belong in the circus but in the wild. Well here's the thing, back during my day, there was no PETA at all. Apparently, circus abuse wasn't talked about that much until a few decades later. Now for this story, you would expect it to have my son Dumbo right? Well, here's the thing I will talk about him during the story. Another thing you should know is my son didn't live very long. But, don't worry i'll explain that part later. For those who don't know me, my name is Harriet Jumbo or Mrs Jumbo for short. Honestly, life in the circus wasn't bad at first when my son arrived but after what happened to him later on is something that's not easy to explain but that will be for later. See, when your in the circus business, you have to make sure you get your show ready, hire acrobats, clowns, magicians, and also, you need animals that will be able to perform year round. It can be challenging at first but once you get used to it, you will have sold out crowds, people coming to see the so called \"Greatest Show On Earth\". However, just because your circus is good at first, doesn't mean it lasts forever. For example, your show could lose it's popularity because of either there are less crowds, losing money for the budget, people from your staff either quit or get fired, and your dream will fall apart in front of you. Trust me, i've seen the circus I knew fell apart because of what happened to my son. Man, if you think being a circus elephant is easy, obviously you haven't seen what we've been through. I'll explain that later but for now, the reason I wanted to tell you this story was because i've seen a lot happen during my time as a circus elephant and after I retired. You have known me in the Disney film \"Dumbo\", but they're are things the film didn't tell you about. Not to worry, I will explain how I got into the circus, life in the circus before Dumbo, my time with him, what sadly happened to him, what after after the incident, life after being forced to retire from the circus, and my reflection on what happened during my time in the circus. Trust me, this story will show that not every circus is warm, kind, and friendly. Chapter 1: The Beginning Before I was ever born, my mother once lived with her family in India. Everything was doing okay at first, until one day a circus scout was looking for the next show stealing attraction. Now, when they found my mother's family, they decided to separate them from her. She was then captured and then shipped to the Florida Zoo. What the staff didn't know was that my mother was pregnant with me. So, the staff knew the day would come when I would be born. Apparently, my mother was in labor when that day came. The staff watched on as my mother gave birth to me. I was at first a bit wobbly but thankfully my mother helped me stand up. It was pretty special that the staff saw this. Unfortunately, the ringmaster forced my mother to perform despite just giving birth to me. So, I was under the care of the zoo staff. I thought I would see my mother again but during one show she never made it out alive. She was walking on tight rope when all of the sudden, one wrong step and fell straight to the ground and landed on her hand causing her to break her skull. When the staff learned about this, they knew I was too young to know what happened to my mother so they decided to keep it a secret until I was ready to learn the truth. As time went on, I eventually learned what happened to my mother. I just couldn't believe it, how could she have done it without me? I knew she loved me so I eventually moved oon from the tragedy. Now, if you're wondering if there ever was a Mr. Jumbo, the truth is, there was no Mr. Jumbo because unfortunately, no males ever met me. So, basically I was a loner. One night, the storks arrived with baby animals but sadly, I never got mine yet. So, I sighed sadly. Chapter 2: My Son Dumbo Arrives Once the next morning came, everything was getting packed for the train that was heading to Atlanta. When I was about to board into my car, I looked up again but no luck. Then, the Elephant Matriarch pushed me into the car when suddenly, she got stuck. It took 6 workers to get her in and thankfully, she was in. Let me tell you about the Matriarch, Catty, Giddy, and Prissy. They're pretty much the most bossy, snooty, fucking assholes that I had to deal with. All they do is not give a fuck about me and just completely ignore me. Once the train was rolling along, a stork had my son in it and apparently, he was late. He then came to my cart, I signed on a notepad, He Sang the Happy Birthday Song, when asked about the name, I said \"Jumbo Jr.\" and then he left. I wasted no time unwrapping it and it truly was a proud proud day. Once I first saw him, I knew this was the one. Everything was okay at first but when he sneezed, he had big ears. The others were in shock at what they've just seen and instead of Jumbo, they called him Dumbo and that's how my son got his name. One elephant pulled on his ear and I slapped her trunk. I knew I couldn't stand it, so I found a door and slammed it right on their fucking faces. Once that was done, me and my son can relax in peace and quiet and that's what we did for the rest of the trip. Chapter 3: The Circus Once the train stopped in Atlanta, it was pretty much all hands on deck in order to get the circus tent set up for the show. Me and my son helped out the others getting the tent set up and believe it or not, it was raining so we worked in the rain. Once the tent was ready, the circus then had a parade with the marching band, lions, tigers, a gorilla, a female hippopotamus, camels, and of course, the clowns. Once the elephants arrived, my son was grabbing my tail when he got distracted and fell into the mud. Thankfully, once we got back in the tent, I have him a bath and it made me glad to have him. We then started playing around and that would make me happy all the time. Everything was just okay until a group of shithead boys came. At first I letted him near them. But then, one of them blew in his ears and I wasted no time in spanking the living hell of him. The others ran away and the Ringmaster heard this. So, he and the workers tried to tie me down while they take my son away. I knew I shouldn't have done this but I grabbed the Ringmaster's leg and threw him to the water. He was mad as hell so he locked me in solidarity condfinment. I just felt miserable because I wasn't able to see my son. Chapter 4: Timothy Mouse I guess sometimes getting trouble is not good. I knew I shouldn't have spanked the boy but he blew in his ears so he deserves it. My son is going through depression while the other elephants talk about what happened earlier. While that was going on, Timothy Mouse was just eating peanuts when he saw how the other elephants completely ignore my son. Instead of watching, he decided to stand up for him and the others were afraid of a mouse so they ran away from him and honestly, i'm really glad he did that because they deserved it. Once that was taken care of, he then met my son. He knew those ears could make him a star. So, he sneakily snuck in the tent where the ringmaster was asleep. He told him of Dumbo and he had an idea for the next show. Chapter 5: Pyramid Of Pachyderms The next night, the ringmaster showed a full crowd what to expect when elephants stack on top of each other. They all went one by one on the tiny little ball and by the time the last elephant was on the top, my son then started to run. Then, all of a sudden, he tripped and collided with ball causing the pyramid to fall down. Now, I couldn't see it but I heard people panicking and running for their lives. The elephants made a huge mess in tearing apart the circus ring. Luckily and thankfully, no one was hurt but my son made a huge and regrettable mistake. We then headed to Missippi for the next show. The other elephants blamed my son for their injuries. The ringmaster decided for punishment, my son would be a clown. Chapter 6: My Son Being A Clown And Baby Mine During the next show, my son was on top of a building and he was forced to jump out of the window so he fell into the mat. I knew my son was miserable because he wants to see me again so Timothy decided to let him see me again. When Timothy said \"Oh, Mrs. Jumbo\", I knew my son was out there. I unfortunately couldn't move my feet because of the chains so I used my trunk to feel him for the first time since we got separated. I rocked him and that made me lucky to be his mother. Well, the visit was short, but it was worth it so after that, I waved him goodbye. Chapter 7: The Miracle Now, I didn't know what happen to him after that but I hoped he would make me proud. Well, the next night, he jumped and flew. I couldn't see it but he did it, my son finally proving himself that he can do it. So, in reward, I was free and we had a reunion and that made me happy in a long time. Now, you think that's it, well it turns out there out there's more to the story. Chapter 8: What Happened Next After my son's performance at the circus, it was clear that my son was the main attraction of the circus. The ringmaster knew my son was perfect. Everything was finally going good but one day, he accidentally runs away. I told him to come back, but he didn't listen. The circus staff was in trouble because without my son, the show can't go on. So, they decided to cancel the next few shows because of what happened. Thankfully a few days later, my son came back and I was relived because I thought i'd lost him. Things were back under control until one night, fate would take my son's life from me. Chapter 9: The Tragedy During one show, my son was about to fly sky high. I knew he could do it. But, once he started flying at first everything was okay. Then, out of nowhere, my son had a heart attack and he fell. I just couldn't believe it because this was the second tragedy since my mother's death. The audience was shocked about this and they couldn't believe this would happen. Not even the circus animal doctor could save my son. Chapter 10: The Aftermath Once the story of my son's tradgic death, everyone across the nation and world were sad because they were hoping to see my son but unfortunately they can't now. They knew someone was to blame. But, believe or not, no one was to blame. As it turns out, his young heart was unable to keep up with the rest of the body so it pretty much explains why he had the heart attack. After this happened, the circus I once knew started to fall and tear apart. Ticket sales were dropping because people were no longer interested in seeing the big top again. As fate would have it, the circus filed for bankruptcy and most of the animals were sold to other people. As for me, they had no choice but to let me live in the big world by myself. Chapter 11: Retirement At first, retirement wasn't all that bad because I was finally free. Once I was in the outside world, I knew I had to get a job. So, I was hired as a therapy animal for a group of people with autism. Honestly, i'm really glad I became a a therapy animal because I was sweet, kind, good hearted, and brave. Once I got done with that job, I knew it was time to live in peace and quiet. So, I eventually lived in a large, beautiful forest just outside of Atlanta and that's where I lived for the rest of my life. Epilogue When I look back at what happened in and out of the big top, I would remember those ups and downs. Sure, my son would've been here if it wasn't for the tragedy, but I moved on but I always remembered him. I died peacefully and I hope whoever reads this can understand, being a circus elephant is hard but when you're a mother, always remember to be you've always been: yourself.

Fred knew they would not be able to agree on a name so the stalk wrote Georgina on the tag, after a label on the front of the train car called horhay. Fred did not know who the baby belonged to, his instructions were to deliver it to the car and he did not contemplate his existence. The two elephants fought over the baby, but the baby needed to eat. The female was friends with a cow and the baby would only drink milk so the female claimed the front end of the baby and by default the man elephant got the back. There was no sense in cutting the baby in half because they both loved it. They split the tasks as well as the baby. The man's job was to pick up the poop and the woman's to feed the front. The ears were closest to the front of Georgina so it was easiest to listen to the female. The male pulled on the tail but the trunk was thicker and he was afraid the tail would break. The female realized her hostage and threatened a shortage of milk if the male did not bring her food in addition to cleaning the train car. The battle continued. Ears listened. The male got tired of cleaning the car and providing food so the humans put him in another car, they thought the car was dirty because of too many elephants. If he wanted to see the hostage, he had to bring food and clean poop. ","Summary":" The One after Jumbo The stalks name was Fred.

The clowns weren't nervous, they had done this act before and were already set, As a group of clowns were already holding a trampoline,which actually was just a plastic ring with paper instead of rubber. Soon the clown behind set would slap the baby elephant in the behind with a wooden plank, sending him down through the fake trampoline and into the tub of whipped cream right below it. The clowns decided, as a way to further entertain the audience and gain another zero in their paycheck, they recently raised the building drop to over 200 feet, foolishly saying that the elephant could take it and was,\" made of rubber.\" The elephant, who you may know and love as ,\" Dumbo,\" was feeling anxious. He couldn't wait to show his newfound talent of flight, which he accidentally learned he had after a recent ,\"intoxication.\" Dumbo shuddered and tried to block the images of pink elephants in his mind.\" after I show them,\" he thought,\" they'll free my mother and I'll be a star and we'll travel the world and eat peanuts.\" And he had all of this thanks to two factors. One, he held in his trunk, a magic feather, which gave him the ability to fly, and the other was the one who found the feather for him, his new best friend, Tmothy Mouse, who had helped him through his recent hardships. Timothy himself was right by him, standing atop the alleged burning building, and was looking at the large crowd in amazement. \" Look at that full house. Dumbo you're standing on the threshold of success. Don't look down, it'll make ya dizzy.\" He exclaimed to his pal, as a kind warning now seeing the the loooong way down. The rodent chuckled to himself, imagining the looks on their faces seeing an elephant fly. \" Boy, are they in for a surprise. Got the magic feather?\" Dumbo sure did.. and he gave a wink to Timothy, knowing well about the ace up his sleeve... if he had sleeves.\"Good!\" Timothy knew that the magic feather wasn't really magic. It was just a way of thinking so he could believe. Dumbo was perfectly capable of flying on his own, thanks to the large ears that had been causing him misery this whole time. Timothy received the signal, as the drumroll started. \"Okay,\" he said. \"contact!\" Dumbo got into his stance,\"Take off!,\" and he leaped, narrowly missing the clown in the back with a plank. He fell, and fell, and fell, but, in the excitement, the confidence bringing feather slipped out of dumbo's trunk, much to his shock! Timothy gasped,\" Uh-oh! The magic feather!,\" as he made a grab for it, but to no avail. Now in mid-plummet, the mouse hurried to tell dumbo the truth. \" Dumbo, come on fly! Open them ears!\" Dumbo couldn't, believing his magic was gone. \" The magic feather was just a gag! You can fly! Honest you can!\" Now begging. They fell faster... and faster! \" Hurry! Open 'em up!\" The bottom was rushing toward them... \" Please!\" Finally taking heed, The little pachyderm opened his ears and- (The following scene has been censored for its violent nature, gory visuals, and outright dark turn on the Disney name.

It was an accident ! Those things are tough, how was I supposed to know what fall could hurt him?

Timothy, the red wearing clothes mouse, was able to act as his herald and mediator between contracts of riches, so Dumbo got his mother free and became a circus star. But fame does not pass the proclavities of time without the hint of damnation, disilusionment began creeping into the wonderful heart of the big eared proboscidean. \"Dumbo, what is wrong?\" said his mother in oedipal concern. Dumbo did not answer, he never did. Speech is for all taken granted, it is an ability that does not take into consideration the emotional needs of individuals. So all Dumbo could do is be sad, sad that his life was a farsical helegian nightmare of cyclical motions, and alone in silence he was. \"I know, lets have a party!\" said Jim Crow, eating a watermelon full of fried chicken. The evil elephant ladies much disliked, they were the product of a society that rewards hatred and demonization of one's fellow sapient beings. So the ugliesta and most whore of them all took out a pistol, and shot Jim Crow in the chest. \"HAW HAW HAW, DIES YOU AVIAN MALARIA CORVID VODOO ORISHA NIGGER!\" cackled evilly the elephant matriarch prostitute, writting in her forehead the entirity of the Avestas with fermented rotten pigeon dung. She was all the evils of the earth, all the condemnation of centuries of internalised bigotry externalised in a single petty act of murder, she could not be stopped. She then kept shooting, all the clowns fell and the ring master died, a bullet in his wound filled with carnicerous hatred that twisted his flesh into a grotesque parody of itself, from which spawned Ahriman's hateful Daevas that violated the savage intrincancies of mankind, spreading forth from the circus and tainting the earth. The more the elephant's, whose name was Jen in homage of Ahriman's foul consort, hatred flowed forth in bullets, the more darkness overwhelmed the earth, the more chaos and lie spread. All the other whore elephants congratulated, rubbing faeces in their pestilent bodies to homage their loyalty to all evil and hatred in the world. \"Oh yeah, Dumbo, you will die you disgusting abomination\" moaned the elephants whorily, forsaking all their dignity as sapient beings in order to lust after the very concepts of murder and hatred, worshipping the Angra Mainyu with all their evil hearts, with immense hateful faith that all beings on the earth would suffer forever in concentration camps. \"Jen, you have fallen too far!\" said Dumbo's mother, and with an ounce of her strength she prayed to Ahura Mazda, prayed to the highest of all spirits to deliver them from harm. \"Y-yes, Dumbo's mother, don't let darkness take over the world\" said Jim Crow, still alive but barely, giving in a last prayer to the yazatas before finally dying, with a soft banjo music playing. And with that faith, with that good will towards all mankind, they were spared from the bullets of the hateful Jen, whose whoredom was so immense that she tore off her own placenta, her nourishing organ of life, waving it to the heavens in a sign of mockery towards God to show that she was now the queen of abortions and foul murders. But in her evil she saw a weak member in the group's defenses: Timothy. Yes, Timothy the smarty mouse whose compassion tethered Dumbo to this world, it was his turn to be suicidal. Like Dumbo, he too was born different from others, but instead of manifesting in a mutation of the flesh, it was the homoromantic attractions for men. And in a deeply homophobic society, that is a sin that cannot be forgiven, that cannot be enhanced positively with a token of faith like a feather's crow. No, he was doomed forever to the life of a bachelor, he was doomed forever to be considered a walking bomb waiting to explode and be sent to the guillotine. Becoming Dumbo's manager was a relief, a chance maybe of not being forced to marry, but his paternal love for the elephant child made him realise he'd never have a family of his own, would never find true love. And now, that the might of Heaven was protecting against the darkness of whoredom, he could not help but feel rejected, to feel that he truly deserved to die and be sent to hell. Oh Timothy, what a mistake you've made! The will of the group is always stronger than the will of individuals, only communal faith can protect from a bullet's lancelet sting. But in your despair, you open yourself for the killing shot, and BAM, the whore elephant Jen lodged a bullet in your chest, exploded in a gibbering amount of gore, destroyed ribs, a concussive force that sent his head flying, flying in true mockery of freedom. \"NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!\" said Dumbo, for the first time finding the voice with which to speak, \"DADDDDDDDDDDYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY!\" And with those words, Timothy shed a tear, and saw the light. Everything became bright and blue, and Jim Crow appeared, sorrounded by doves and angles. \"Oh Timothy, haven't you learned everything from our times together?\" said the natural wisdom crow, \"If a group is composed of strayed individuals, then its power is one and the same!\" And Timothy realised the truth, and cried again, but this times, tears of pure brightness happiness. Then, softly, Jim Crow grabbed his head, and they kissed, shining on the universe a bright light of pure love brighter than ten thousand suns, burning Jen and her whores to utter oblivion. \"NNOOOOOOOOOOOOOO HATRED AND WHOREDOOOOOMMMMMM ALWAYS WIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIINNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNN!\" cried the elephant whores in protest and pure darkness hatred, but it was futile, light and life and love always prevail over evil, always burn it until not even atomic particles remain. And so the evil whore elephants were sent to the hell they so lusted and craved after, and were fit a most righteous punishment: to be raped by demons, to be pregnant with their abominations, who in turn eat their flesh and rape them and gnash their sordid wombs for all eternal history, boys and girls! And with that, Timothy and Jim Crow were restored to life, and Dumbo found once again the will to live. And everyone lived happily ever after, amen and amen!

All eyes were on Kitty from Timothy, he had never heard such a beautiful singing voice in all his life. After the performance, Kitty had just got done changing back to her normal clothes. Timothy was waiting patiently waiting for her. Timothy was outside of the bar, Kitty spotted Timothy with his hands in his pockets, whistling. \" Hey there Tim \" the white female mouse spoke, \" There's the gal of the show! \" Tim replied, Kitty blushed, \" Oh stop, your the manager and friend of a flying elephant! \" she said, \" your the gal with an amazing voice \" Tim said back. The two of them laughed and blushed, it was awhile since Timothy spoke with a girl before, regardless of his sisters. Kitty kissed Tim on the cheek, \" thank you for coming tonight, i really appreciate \" Kitty said. Tim put his right arm over his head and blushed, \" oh gosh, it was nothin' \" Tim said still blushing. \" oh i almost forgot to ask ya, do you wanna meet Dumbo in person? i'm sure the lil' guy would love ya \" Tim asked.

The two of them were headed to the circus, Tim really wanted Kitty to meet Dumbo, he knew they would like each other. \" its amazing how you two were able to become good friends \" Kitty said, \" yeah, he was scared of me at first since im a mouse, then i was able for him to gain my trust, he's a great lil guy isn't he? \" Tim said. After awhile from walking, they finally reached the circus. Kitty followed Tim so she wouldn't get lost around all the circus tents. \" Dummmbooo \" Tim called, \" there's someone i want ya to meet \" Tim called once again, he also did a certain whistle for him. Dumbo was a bit tired and bored from Timothy being gone. Dumbo finally spotted Timothy and trotted happily towards him, greeting him with a lift from his trunk, \" hiya Dumbo, sorry i was gone for so long, but i want ya to meet someone \" Tim said. Dumbo's pupils widened when he saw Kitty, Dumbo leaned towards Kitty as his small trunk approached her. \" pleasure to meet you Dumbo \" the white female mouse spoke as she touched the little elephant's trunk. Dumbo smiled at the white mouse as he thought she was nice and pretty. \" Kitty here is a great singer \" said Tim, Kitty blushed again. \" oh Tim? \" asked Kitty, \" yea? \" said Tim, \" i kinda need a ride home, could you and Dumbo give me a lift? \" asked Kitty, Dumbo and Timothy looked at each other, \" what do ya say Dumbo? \" Tim asked, Dumbo smiled and nodded. \" oh thank you dearly \" said Kitty. Dumbo bent down so the two could get up on his yellow hat, they both walked up his trunk and were ready to take off. \" Dumbo head south then i'll guide you as we go \" said Kitty, Dumbo flapped his ears and took off, Kitty looked at Tim \" my house isn't far from the bar \" Kitty said, \" your a poet and you don't know it \" Tim chuckled, Kitty giggled at Tim's humor, she liked Tim for how kind and humorous he was. \" my home's right down there Dumbo \" Kitty pointed, Dumbo flew down, Kitty had a mouse hole home behind a building in a town.

There were, but there were only 8 stories and like 4 were about Olive and Todd. It got me thinking, and I really didn't like how they dealt with the whole Anson/Olive scene. The guy was a total douche! He was taking it way too far in my opinion on trying to force himself on Olive. So, this is how I feel it should have gone. And since there are very few stories concerning this movie, probably no one will read it, but at least I will get to write it. Read on! DISCLAIMER: I do not own the movie Easy A, the characters, or anything that could, or might be, or is, affiliated with it. Chapter 1 Cliched White Knight Todd threw the bag of garbage into the dumpster with a little more force than necessary. He was glad his shift was over because he wasn't sure how much more of work he could take tonight. First, he couldn't believe that Olive went out with Anson. Doesn't she know what kind of guy he is. I know how he treats women and it's not okay. Todd shook the thoughts from his head. Olive wasn't the typical girl, she wouldn't fall for his crap and she would put a stop to it if he got out of hand with her. He hoped. He was still shaking his head as he walked across the parking lot to his car. He stopped when he heard shuffling. Great, what a way to end my night. A fight in the parking lot. Todd sighed and turned as he prepared himself to break up a fight. His eyes widened as he saw what was really going on. Olive couldn't believe this. Anson really thought she was having sex with people for money. Granted, he probably wasn't the only one who thought that, but still. She tried to explain to him that everything was a lie, that she was still a virgin and not a prostitute and she would not be sleeping with him in exchange for 200 dollars to Home Depot. He wasn't getting it and she was starting to freak out. \"Just take me home, Anson.\" \"No way. Not until I get what I payed for.\" He grabbed Olive once again as he said this and she pushed against his shoulders as hard as she could, but he was a lot stronger than she was and held on to her. \"I haven't slept with anyone. What part of that do you not understand? I just said it so they wouldn't be treated like outcasts anymore. All those guys wanted was a little popularity so I lied to everyone and said I slept with them. I never did. Then other guys started coming to me and offering me gift cards to lie about it for them too. To lie, Anson. Not actually do it. Got it? If you don't want to take me home, fine, let me go and I'll walk.\" Anson didn't pay any attention to what she said and when she tried to pull away again he shoved her against his car. Olive, not expecting it stumbled and fell to the pavement. Now she was scared. She decided she would run back into the restaurant and just call someone for a ride home. Or maybe she could convince Todd to take her home. Olive went to get up and Anson shoved her back down and grabbed her hair. He tried to open his car door and put her inside so she opened her mouth to scream and he slapped his hand over her mouth and put his face right in hers. \"I didn't waste my time tonight just to get nothing out of this. You don't want the gift card? Fine. I'm still going to get something in exchange for my valuable time. So shut up and get in the car. Now.\" Olive couldn't speak with his hand over her mouth but she started to cry and shook her head no. Anson didn't care and continued trying to shove her into the car. Olive kicked out and tried to hit, punch and scratch him. Whatever it took to get away from him. Anson reared back and hit Olive with his other hand and caused her head to hit the side of his car. Olive continued trying to struggle. She knew that it would be all over if she got in that car. Olive knew if Anson got what he wanted no one would believe anything she had to say about it. She had soiled her own reputation so badly, that everyone would believe Anson over her. Her only option was to fight with everything she had to get away. So she kicked him again and again. Finally, Anson just grabbed the side of her head with both hands and as she drew in a breath to scream he slammed her head off the side of the car and started putting her in the car. The black was starting to edge into Olive's vision and she felt herself going lax and Anson putting her in the car. She knew she should fight, but she didn't have anything left and it was a struggle just to keep her eyes open. Todd took in the scene in a matter of seconds. Anson was trying to put Olive in his car and it looked like Olive wasn't even moving. Blocking out the possibilities of what Anson could have done to Olive or if she was hurt or worse, Todd charged him and tackled him away from her. He and Anson struggled and Todd didn't know what he would do even if he managed to pin Anson. But he just kept trying to get the better of Anson. Todd just about had Anson pinned when he heard a moan and turned to check on Olive and Anson right hooked him hard enough to just about knock him out. Anson jumped up pushed Olive the rest of the way out of his car and took off, squealing his tires as he sped out of the parking lot. Todd shook his head to clear it and groaned as he pushed himself up. He sprinted to Olive and knelt down next to her. With one hand he brushed her hair back from her face and gently shook her shoulder with the other. \"Olive? Can you hear me? Come on, wake up.\" Todd was worried and was pulling his phone out to call 911 when Olive groaned and her eyes fluttered open. He forgot about his phone and decided he would just take her to the hospital himself. She was awake and he could probably get her there faster anyway. He was just glad that she was looking at him. \"Hey. Take it easy, I'm going to take you to the hospital okay?\" \"No. Please don't. I'm fine and I don't want to go there. Please Todd.\" He saw that she was starting to breathe faster and didn't want her to have a panic attack so he just helped her sit up and pulled her into his arms and shushed her, trying to calm her down. \"Okay. It's okay, Olive. I'm not going to make you do anything you don't want to. You're okay now, I'm gonna help you into my car okay?\" Olive just nodded and Todd pivoted so he was squatting behind her and put his hands underneath her arms and gently lifted her to her feet. She wavered slightly so he quickly put his arm around her to steady her. He didn't know what to do. He didn't want to take her home like this and she refused to go to the hospital. His parents were out of town so he thought maybe she could come home with him until she decided what her next move would be. \"Olive, listen, my parents are out of town for the weekend and I have my whole house to myself. If you want to come home with me until you calm down and decide what you are going to do next , you are more than welcome. But it's up to you.\" \"Y-Yeah, I'll do that. I can, can tell my parents I'm spending the night at Rhi's. Thank you so much Todd. For everything, for for-\" \"Hey, shh. It's okay. Let's just get you cleaned up okay?\" Todd gently led her to his car and helped her into the passenger side and buckled her seat belt for her. He was just sliding into the driver's side when he realized that Olive was silently sobbing and her hands were shaking as she tried to text her mom. Without a word, Todd grabbed her phone, sent out a text to her mom and set the phone in the cup holder. He turned Olive's face toward his own and gave her a reassuring smile. \"Everything is going to be fine, Olive. I promise.\" Olive bit her lip and nodded her head as she tried to stop crying. Todd kissed her forehead gently and settled himself in his seat and started the car.[Chapter 2] Okay, so I hope you enjoyed the first chapter. I know it's definitely not entirely realistic on what would have happened but I'm a sucker for a guy saving a damsel in distress and always have been. Sorry if you don't like it... but here's chapter two anyway. DISCLAIMER: I do not own Easy A or any of the characters or anything that is, or may be affiliated with the movie or characters. Chapter 2 Saving You Todd kept glancing at Olive the entire way to his house, just making sure that she was doing okay. Her mom had already text back a response telling her that it was fine and to have a good time. He told her to keep talking to him and had her tell him everything that had happened in the parking lot with Anson. She told him the whole story right up to where she had blacked out and was crying again. Todd reached over with one hand and grasped her hand in his. \"You're safe now. I won't let him touch you.\" He meant what he said and swore to himself that not only would he not let Anson near Olive, but that he would make him pay for putting his hands on her. When he pulled into his driveway ten minutes later, he turned to Olive and was surprised to see she had fallen asleep. He got out quietly, went over to her side of the car, and gently lifted her into his arms. He had some difficulty when he got to his front door trying to hold onto her and get the door open at the same time but he managed. He brought her upstairs to his room and gently laid her on his bed. He figured she would want something more comfortable to sleep in and turned to grab something of his out of his dresser. As he turned he felt her grab his hand. \"Don't leave.\" \"I won't I promise. I'm just going to get you something more comfortable to sleep in okay?\" Olive nodded and slowly let go of his hand, as if she was afraid that he had lied and really was going to leave her. He moved as quickly as he could and hesitated as he asked her if she needed help changing. When she said she didn't think so, Todd turned to leave the room so she could change with privacy but stopped when her panicked voice reached him. \"Wait! Where are you going? You promised you wouldn't leave.\" Todd turned around quickly and walked back to her and knelt down. \"I'm not. I just thought you would want some privacy to change clothes.\" \"You don't have to leave. You could just turn around.\" Todd smiled and nodded his head. He stood and turned his back to Olive and waited until she quietly told him she was ready. Todd quickly stripped down to his boxers and started grabbing blankets, throwing them on the floor. Olive asked him what he was doing and he explained that he was making himself a makeshift bed on the floor so she could have his bed. He was startled to see the tears start leaking from Olive's eyes once again. \"Hey. Don't cry Olive, it's going to be okay.\" \"I don't want you to sleep on the floor. Maybe I should just go home and try and explain everything to my parents.\" \"You don't have to go home right now. I'm fine with sleeping on the floor. Besides, it's a little late to try and explain everything to your parents tonight and you haven't had time to really calm down. You just need a good night's sleep and you'll be able to think more clearly in the morning. Okay?\" \"Okay. But Todd?\" \"Yeah Olive?\" \"Do you think maybe-. Well could we-. Um.\" \"Whatever it is Olive, you can say it. You can ask me anything.\" \"Okay. Will you sleep with me? Just sleep. I just want to be close to you.\" \"Um. Okay. Yeah, if it's what you need, sure.\" Todd slowly got up and made his way to the other side of his bed and pulled the covers back. He looked into Olive's eyes, silently asking if she was sure about this. She gave him a small smile and he slid into bed beside her and she immediately cuddled herself into his side and he wrapped his arms around her. It just felt natural. He stroked her hair and kissed her on the forehead. \"Everything will be fine Olive.\" \"Promise?\" \"I promise.\" That was all Olive needed to hear and she fell asleep shortly after. Todd lay awake for a while, thinking about the night's events and what he would do about Anson come tomorrow. He was thinking about how grateful he was that he had been in the parking lot when he had because he couldn't think about any of the alternatives. He kept replaying the scene over and over and he pulled Olive tighter to him and closed his eyes tightly in relief that she was safe. He would help her sort this out and he would personally deal with Anson and make sure he never even thought about coming near Olive again. He had liked her since the eighth grade and over the years, that like had turned into love. He had just never worked up the courage to tell her. With everything that happened tonight, he knew how lucky he was to even have her around to tell, so he decided he would tell her the second he got the chance to.[Chapter 3] Okay, third chapter. Hopefully at least one person is reading this, if not, well hey you do what you can! I am enjoying writing it so that's all that really matters I guess. DISCLAIMER: I do not own Easy A, any of the characters or anything else that is or may be affiliated with the movie or characters. Chapter 3 New Beginning Olive woke up to a quietly snoring Todd holding her close to his chest. She looked up at his sleeping face as she thought about everything that had happened in the last twelve hours. She didn't know how or what she was going to tell her parents and she definitely didn't know what she was going to do about Anson. She was so lost in thought, she didn't notice Todd open his eyes and stare back into hers. She focused back on him as he smiled at her and she felt herself smiling back without even thinking about it. \"Feeling any better? How's your head?\" \"Um, it feels better. Thank you. For everything you did last night. I don't want to think about what would have happened if you hadn't come when you had.\" \"I don't want to think about that either. I did get there on time and I don't want you to thank me. I'm just glad I was able to stop him Olive.\" \"Yeah. So, what are we going to do?\" \"Well, that's up to you. No matter what you decide I'm going to support you though. And you aren't going to do anything alone.\" \"I don't want anyone to know.\" \"Okay, I'll support anything you decide except for that. Olive, you have to tell someone! He can't get away with this!\" \"I told you. I just want to fix everything that I've done and get back to normal. With you.\" Todd sighed as he realized he probably wasn't going to be able to make her change her mind and he knew he couldn't take it upon himself to tell anyone because he knew she wouldn't forgive him. But that didn't mean he had to be happy about the decision. \"So we are just going to do nothing about this?\" \"If we go to the cops or my parents or anyone else it is just going to backfire in my face.\" \"What? How?\" \"Todd, his family has a lot of money. I've completely soiled my own reputation with my lies. He is just going to tell people that I am making this up because he turned me down. They will all believe him.\" \"Your parents wouldn't Olive. They will believe you, just like I do.\" \"Yes, they would. But their opinion alone wouldn't help anything. If I admit to the lying and to what I've done, they will just say that I have admitted being a liar and won't believe me. If I stick with the lies, they will go with whatever story Anson tells them. Either way, I'm screwed and he gets off scott free.\" \"No he doesn't. Not if I have anything to say about it.\" \"Todd no, I don't want anything happening to you because of me.\" Todd just shook his head as he stood from the bed and went over everything she had said. He let out a frustrated sigh as he realized that she was probably right. He was still going to kick the shit out of him though, no matter what Olive said. He turned to her and told her just that, not caring if she liked the idea or not. \"Todd, please. We will figure out a way to get him back for this okay? I don't want you getting hurt or into trouble. Please.\" \"Fine.\" \"Promise?\" \"I promise.\" \"Thank you, Todd.\" \"I love you.\" Olive just sat and stared at Todd, not believing what she had just heard. As she stared she watched a small smile appear on his face and then get bigger until he was full on grinning at her. \"What did you just say?\" \"I said I love you Olive. I love you and now that I have finally worked up enough courage to tell you, I will say it all day if you want.\" \"You love me?\" \"Yep. Since the eighth grade. What about you? Do you love me, Olive?\" \"I- Todd- You-\" \"A yes would be good. Please tell me you feel the same Olive. Please.\" Olive continued to stare at Todd still not believing what she was hearing. She thought maybe she could still be dreaming until she saw the happy expression on Todd's face begin to fade into hopelessness and hurt. She realized that not only was she not dreaming, but if she didn't tell Todd how she felt within the next five seconds, he was going to take her silence as an answer of no. \"Yes. Todd I have had a crush on you since long before eighth grade. Yes, I love you. I just can't believe that I am sitting here after everything that's happened and you are actually telling me this.\" \"You have? And can't believe it? I haven't exactly been hiding it the past four years.\" Todd smiled at her and Olive smiled back as she patted the spot next to her on the bed. Todd sat back down and leaned against his headboard. Olive snuggled into his side and the two of them talked about everything. All the wasted time, how all the lying had begun and the purpose of it. How she got into the situation with Anson in the first place and what they were going to do to get back at him.[Chapter 4] Okay, I think this is going to be the last chapter. If there is anyone who has stuck with this story right up until the end, I appreciate it and I hope you enjoy the ending. DISCLAIMER: I do not own the movie Easy A or any of the characters. I also do not own anything that is or could be affiliated with the movie or characters. Chapter 4 Tear You Down Olive got together with Rhiannon over the weekend and told her everything that had been happening and everything that Anson had done and tried to do. At first, Rhi was a little angry that Olive had lied to her, but she also understood how she could be sometimes and apologized to Olive for putting her in a position that made her feel like she had to lie in the first place. Once everything had been forgiven, the two girls sat down with Todd and came up with a plan to take Anson down. Rhi was going to convince him to tell her the truth about everything that had happened with Olive by convincing him that she would not only approve of it but wanted him to do it again. She would be wearing a mic on her the whole time and Todd was going to be outside of the room recording the whole conversation. Once they did that, Olive was to come in and threaten Anson with it. If he didn't help fix her reputation and admit to the entire student body that he had tried to force himself on her and she had denied him, then Olive was going to send the recording to the police and tell them everything that had happened and Todd would be right beside her to support and back her up. He was also antsy to be able to get his own little alone time in with Anson so he could dish up some payback. Everything was going smoothly and Anson's eyes widened in surprise as Olive walked into the room with a smirk on her face. She told Anson they had recorded everything and she listed her demands to him with the threat of turning him in. He was angry and couldn't' believe that these two girls were going to be the ones that took him down. He glared at Olive and decided that if he was going to go down, he may as well leave her something to remember him by. Todd was standing outside the door, listening to Olive tell Anson everything she wanted from him and the consequences if he refused. Todd was waiting for his own opportunity to go in and give Anson a taste of his own medicine. He had worked hard to convince Olive and Rhi to give him five minutes alone with Anson and they had agreed. As long as he let them finish the agreement, it was only five minutes, and Todd promised not to seriously injure Anson. Todd was getting ready to burst through the door when the plan went south. Anson lunged at Olive and slammed her against the wall with his hands locked around her neck. Rhiannon's eyes went wide and she screamed and looked around for anything in the room she could use to hit Anson with. Olive was grabbing and scratching at his hands and everything seemed to happen all at once when Todd burst through the door and immediately zoned in on Anson with his hands around Olive and Rhiannon looking unsure of what to do. Todd saw red as he grabbed Anson and began hitting him repeatedly until Anson stopped moving and he felt a hand on his shoulder. He stopped and turned around, expecting it to be Olive but instead seeing Rhi looking terrified and pleading with him to stop before he really did some damage. Todd pulled away and looked to where Olive had been and saw her sitting on the floor with her back against the wall and her hands on her throat. Rhi started crying and ran to Olive. Todd reached her at the same time and pulled her into his arms. He tossed his phone to Rhi and told her to call the cops. Olive's eyes widened but she didn't say anything. Todd just kept rubbing her arms and grabbed her face in his hands, assuring himself she was whole and okay. \"Are you okay?\" \"I... think so. Here you are again, coming to my rescue.\" \"What can I say? I'm a sucker for a damsel in distress. Especially when I'm in love with said damsel.\" \"I love you, Todd. I'm sorry I didn't listen to you from the beginning and just go to the cops.\" \"Well, you kind of had a point too. They probably wouldn't have believed you, especially with Anson's family being as prestigious as they are. But they have no choice but to believe you now. We have all the evidence they could ask for. Everything will be fi-\" Todd broke off as he heard Anson groaning and trying to sit up behind him. Todd turned and glared at him as Anson tried to get his bearings back. Anson looked to Olive and she could tell he was really scared now that she, Todd and Rhiannon really had the upper hand. She was still worried that Todd would go over and finish the job so she gripped his arm with both hands and tried to pull him closer to her. Without turning around, Todd scooted closer and wrapped Olive in his protective embrace and continued to glare at Anson. \"Just so we're clear, Anson. Deal's off.\" Anson's eyes widened as the sound of sirens got closer to all of them. Rhiannon came back over and sat on Olive's other side and grasped her hand. Olive turned and gave her a smile. Everything was going to be fine. Olive sat on her bed in Todd's arms later that day. She had been checked out at the hospital after talking to the cops, giving them her recording and statement and repeating everything to her parents. Her throat would be sore for about a week but she was going to be fine. All in all, she felt pretty lucky. She had come out of this on top after all. Anson was being dealt with. All had been forgiven between her and Rhiannon and they were closer than ever. Her parents had heard everything she had to say and supported her one hundred percent and were glad she was alright. Her reputation was going to be fine, especially after everything with Anson died down. And she got Todd. She finally had her full circle moment. Her John Hughes ending that she always wished she could have. Olive ended up with the good guy at the end of the day. He was all hers and he wasn't going anywhere ever if she had anything to say about it. And she did, because after all, everyone knows a white knight can't resist a damsel in distress. Especially when he is in love with said damsel. The End I hope you liked it and please leave a review!

Anna sighed in despair, looking at her reflection in the slightly steamy mirror. She leant forward and wiped it with the back of her hand but still couldn't see through it. Anna's mum had told her time and time again not to leave her bathroom door open after a shower but she hadn't listened. She rarely did. Anna got up to close her bathroom door and waited a couple of minutes for the fog to clear. She took a glance back at her face and scowled. Her hair! Anna's unruly dark waves hung around her shoulders, mocking her. Her mum adored it and called her a 'pretty little angel', the mere thought made Anna want to puke. Anna straightened her hair in record time and ran over to look at her little alarm clock, she had ten minutes to get to the bus stop. She used five of these minutes to choose an outfit; a loose fitting cropped t-shirt with 'Black Sabbath' logo across the front which showed a slither of flat stomach, black skinny jeans and her patent white Doc Martins. She used the other five minutes to freshen up and apply makeup. Anna coated some signature black liquid liner over both eyes and a little pale lip balm before spraying her favourite perfume and legging it out of her room, school bag clutched in her hand. She had nearly made it out the door when her mother jumped on her. \"Annabelle! Haven't you had any breakfast yet?\" She gave her only daughter a horrified look. Anna sighed and tried pushing past her but her insistent mother blocked the door. \"Annabelle, honey, it's your first day at school you have to have breakfast!\" Anna watched her mother's blonde hair bob up and down as her blue eyes burnt holes in her forehead. \"It's Anna , and maybe tomorrow.\" Anna mumbled, before stepping past her and blowing a kiss back to avoid any trouble when she got back. As she stepped out onto her new street, Anna breathed in the cool morning air. It was her second favourite season: summer. And the sun was blazing down and dappled the light grey pavement through the green leaves of the tall trees which lined both sides of the road. Anna hadn't known weather like this for almost a year, when she went to visit her Dad, in England. Anna was mad that her parents broke up, but was eternally grateful that her mother lived in the sunny state of California. They moved after receiving trouble from an aggressive neighbour and now here they were. Anna was so wrapped up in her thoughts that she nearly walked past the bus stop, even though there were at least fifteen kids standing around outside. She paused and stepped over to a tall guy in a leather jacket. He had long black hair and a pockmarked face. \"What time does the bus get here?\" She asked quietly. He glanced up at her petite frame and grinned, \"Should only be a couple of minutes.\" Coral stepped back. Good, enough time for a cigarette then. She lit up, relishing in the nicotine that swept through her veins and calmed her instantly. She probably wouldn't have been able to keep breakfast down even if she wanted to. Anna had reached nearly to the end of her rollie when the bus rolled up, in all its huge yellow glory. Anna was the last one to get on the bus because she wanted to finish her cigarette, but of course that meant sitting right at the front. Unlike her old school she didn't have to endure taunts and paper aeroplanes aimed at her but she was still bored as hell. When they finally arrived, Anna was nearly pushed out by a rowdy senior as he shoved past her to get to the rest of the jock team. Anna scowled at him and tried to not fall over as she ascended the stairs into the main entrance. She had just reached the top step when someone jumped out at her. She shrieked as a short boy with a shock of blonde hair, who only looked about eleven beamed at her, offering his hand in a welcome. Anna stood there frozen before saying slowly, \"Heeey there...\" The boy stuck his hand out further and Anna was forced to shake it. She tried not to pull a face at his sweat but she didn't succeed in hiding her mild disgust. The boy was not put off though. \"You're new, aren't you? I'm David, pleased to meet you!\" He said, rigorously shaking her hand up and down. Anna retrieved her hand and wiped it on the back of her jeans, hoping he wouldn't notice. \"I, errm, could you help me find my locker?\" She asked, trying to keep her tone polite. \"Of course!\" he answered in glee. Anna caught some blonde girls to her left giggling at the pair. \"Good.\" She said, gripping his shirt and hastily pulling him off down a corridor. They arrived at a dead end framed with light blue lockers. Anna sighed in relief to see that hers was one of the upper ones – that would make it much easier when retrieving books. Like for her first lesson – English. Anna sensed some awkwardness as David unloaded her books into her locker carefully so she decided to start some conversation. But just as she opened her mouth a tall gangly boy in a red and black bowling shirt accidently shoved her as he walked past. He mumbled an apology and called out to his friend across the hall, \"Hey, at least it'll be easy to find each other.\" Anna glanced up to watch their conversation, laughing internally a little. \"Yeah, I'll just look for the kid with the same shirt.\" His much shorter and beefier friend replied, slamming his locker shut. The tall boy struggled with his locker and a pretty Asian girl with red glasses went over to help. Anna redirected her attention to David. \"So...what year are you in, David?\" She asked, leaning against the lockers and watching him fiddle with her new deadbolt lock. \"Your year.\" He replied simply. This stumped Ana. \"Wait, you're sixteen?\" David jiggled her lock and gave it a satisfied smile, he then turned to Anna. \"No, I'm fourteen but I got moved up cause I'm smart, I guess.\" He blushed profusely, chancing a look up at her through his thin lashes. \"Aaw,\" She said lightly, ruffling his hair, \"That's cute.\" If it were possible David blushed even more. Anna smiled at him, he was sweet, and useful – she could hang around with him until she found some friends more suited to her...needs. She doubted she could get stoned in the parking lot with this one. David smiled back, and then his gaze shifted over Anna's shoulder and he froze. \"Filkins and Ronnie.\" He whispered, fear seizing his windpipe. Anna turned around her eyes fell upon two very large boys, men even, who were carrying a tiny boy who was shrieking at them desperately. \"Someone, please! What are you guys doing?!\" The one on the left with cropped brown hair, she guessed to be Filkins, and piercing blue eyes yelled at him, \"Shut up!\" \"Guys! Guys, what are you doing? Guys, that's not for me, that's for my books! I am not a book!\" \"Get in!\" The other boy with short, black wavy hair, presumably Ronnie, yelled at him. The boy continued screaming as the teens lifted him into an open locker. Filkins held the door back whilst Ronnie grabbed his arms and shoved him back into the metal coffin. Anna barely heard the other two boys from before whispering to one another. \"This is bad.\" \"No, this is good! At least we know we're not the biggest dorks in school.\" \"Maybe we should say something.\" Anna was sure she had misheard him. \"Survival of the fittest.\" His sensible friend answered. \"I gotta say something.\" He mumbled, then they started arguing in lower, more urgent tones. \"This is the dumbest thing I've ever done.\" He muttered. Anna felt him brush her side as he stepped forward, \"Stop!\" She pressed herself further into the lockers. What a moron. Anna watched as the two boys paused and then turned around slowly to face the rebel. Filkin's mouth turned up into a cruel grin as his predatory eyes locked onto the ones of his prey. The tall boy swallowed as his eyes widened in fear. A smooth, dangerous voice came from Filkins, \"Harry Potter, you should learn to keep your mouth shut.\" His smile faded and he glared at him. \"That's what I've been trying to tell him!\" His shorter friend said, his voice unmistakably rising a few octaves. Anna could hear the boy from before legging it down the corridor, shoving people out of his way, \"Run! Run, it's not safe here!\" \"Hey, check this out! Matching shirt geeks.\" Filkins grinned again, walking towards the shorter boy and grabbing his shirt, yanking him towards the other. \"Hey, these bitches really wanna wear the same shirt – so let's make them!\" He said loudly. There was a lot of shuffling around as Filkins and Ronnie nearly jumped on the pair, pulling and stuffing until finally they stepped back to admire their work. They had managed to shove the taller boy inside the same shirt as the other one, and now their faces were pressed together as were their bodies underneath the ugly shirt. Anna watched as they tried not to fall over, the red and black short straining over the pair. \"Haahahah, there!\" Ronnie yelled triumphantly, as the bell began to signal the first lesson. Filkins joined him in his malicious laughter. Filkins suddenly bent low to snarl in the shorter boy's ear, \"You better keep that shit on, cause if you try an' take it off – you're dead.\" Ronnie bent low as well to smirk right in their faces. \"And d'you wanna know what happens when one o' ya dies, ya both die! Cause you're Siamese Queers, bitches!\" He yelled, exploding with another bout of laughter. He hit them on the arm, nearly knocking them over before swaggering off with Ronnie in the opposite direction, still chuckling darkly. Anna took a moment before her breathing went back to normal. \"Who the hell were they?\" She said to David, just as people started to disperse. \"Filkins and Ronnie. Stay away from them, they're trouble.\" David swallowed again, \"Ronnie is seventeen and Filkins is eighteen, which means he's not-\" \"A minor,\" Anna finished for him, \"He's above the law.\" She whispered, horror stricken. \"Just stay out of their way and with a bit of luck you won't die.\" He answered cautiously, like they were right behind them, listening. \"Let's go off to English.\" Anna nodded. They jogged up one flight of stairs and walked straight in, along with all the other students. Anna's heart was still beating rapidly, remembering the mad glint in Filkins as he humiliated his opponent. She sat on the far right hand side, second from the back and David sat down next to her. A thin woman with half-moon spectacles walked over and frowned at David, \"David, you're not in my class.\" She said sternly. \"That would make a whole lot of sense,\" Anna said, knowing how rubbish she was at English and how smart David was. The woman looked at her as if she was about to say something but then turned back to David, \"You're across the hall in Mr. Peterson's room. Chop, chop!\" She said, clapping her wrinkled hands together. David bowed his head and looked at Anna apologetically. \"I'll meet you outside and walk you to your next lesson.\" Anna smiled, \"Yeah, alright then.\" He was ushered out briskly and that was the last she saw of him for a whole hour. Anna relaxed into her seat and arranged her stuff, looking through her textbook and doodling on the notes page. The second bell went nearly all the class where seated. The only seats left were the one in front and behind her. She looked absently around the class, wondering if they were avoiding her. She scowled and sat up straight, trying to put them out of her mind. The teacher, Miss. Robinson, no prizes go to who guesses why she was still a Miss, called out everyone's names and as soon as Anna's was called off she tuned out. Miss. Robinson's shrill voice cried out louder this time, \"Where on Earth are Terry and Ronnie?\" Anna's heart stopped – Ronnie? \"Well, Mr. Filkins and Mr. Lampanelli will just have to make up the time at lunch.\" She sighed and sat back down again. Filkins and Ronnie. Filkins. Ronnie. Fuck . Anna tried to concentrate and settle down as they started reading Macbeth for the first ten minutes, but she just couldn't manage it. The old style writing made her head hurt and she couldn't manage keeping up with the story at all. There was a light creak as the door swung open to reveal a very arrogant looking Filkins, and a lean and muscled Ronnie standing behind. Anna choked on her pen lid. \"Well, it's about time you showed up.\" Miss. Robinson huffed, putting down her book and turning to face them. \"You will come to my class tomorrow lunchtime to catch up on what you've missed. Now be seated.\" She waved in Anna's general direction. Her insides froze as Filkins's eyes fell upon the seat in front of her. They flickered up to her face and his head cocked to the side, curious. He moved forward silently and sat down in front, as Ronnie collapsed heavily behind her. She wondered how the seat could manage all that weight. Miss. Robinson carried on with her book, instructing the two to pick up theirs and start reading from page thirteen. Anna watched Filkins's muscles ripple slightly under his black hoodie as he stretched forward and then leant very far back on his desk, his arms and head hanging over her work. Anna leant back and her hair brushed up against Ronnie's chin which was much further forward than it would have been. Anna thought back to David's advice - how could she stay out of their way when they were going to sit right next to her? Anna stopped breathing as Ronnie inhaled behind her, probably smelling her hair. Filkins must have heard because he started chuckling to himself. Anna sat up straight and tried to concentrate which was hard when you were sandwiched between the two biggest bullies in school. She frowned. How could they be in her class if they were older? Her subconscious tapped her foot impatiently, well they probably got held back because they're so stupid. Anna let out a snort of laughter but managed to disguise it as a nasty cough. But not well enough. \"Something funny, gorgeous?\" Ronnie leant further forward, his head hanging over where her shoulder was. Anna stiffened, \"Erm, no. Not at all.\" Filkins turned around, \"You sure?\" He purred, propping his elbows up on her notebook. Anna nodded furiously, unable to tear her gaze away from his. \"Stop it.\" Ronnie growled from behind, grabbing her hair and tugging it back slightly, holding her still. \"Sorry.\" She breathed. The shrill of the bell snapped Filkins out of his staring contest with her and he sighed, standing up and exiting the room, followed closely by Ronnie who trailed a finger across her shoulder casually as he passed. Anna felt a shiver run down her spine. Not a good start to the day , she thought, grabbing her books and running out to meet David. He was standing right outside the door, waiting eagerly for her. Anna got stuck behind a group of girls and didn't see when Filkins pushed past David roughly, and then turned on him. Ronnie shoved him up against the wall and Filkins bent low to his eye level. \"I know you're waiting for her.\" Filkins grinned malevolently. David shook his head rapidly but Ronnie slammed a hand into his neck, tightening it around his throat. \"Don't lie to me, David. Leave her alone – cause she's mine.\" Filkins pushed Ronnie off and gave David a sharp punch on the shoulder. Anna waited for the rest of the class to exit before she walked outside. David was leaning against the wall, rubbing his shoulder soothingly. \"What's wrong?\" She asked timidly. \"Nothing.\" David answered quickly. Too quickly. \"Well, c'mon then.\" She said, her face brightening. \"Let's go off to Spanish.\" A/N: I've had this reoccurring dream for quite a while now and thought maybe I could share it with you? There's gonna be a chapter two but probably not a third – I don't know yet – review are welcome of course![Chapter 2] A/N: A very big thank you to Guest, who had spread around some intelligent questions. Some of which I can answer straight away, like...the football player – naaah, that isn't the type Anna goes for. Think more like Bender from the Breakfast club or J.D. from Heathers. Does she find a boyfriend? You'll probably find an unexpected twist at the end of the story – whenever that comes. And as for will she stick with David – find out her feelings towards him in this chapter. After her fourth lesson, Anna met up with David outside the library. She had struggled through Spanish, and double physics. But now, all that was left was her favourite lesson; Art. Anna had a little sketch book which sat under her bed, coming out to play every single night. It was filled with swirly black biro lines of dark wolves, barren forests, clear nights and full moons. Anna had a fascination with darkness, black cats, eighties horror films, guys with dark hair and kohl. Not those arrogant, muscled brutes that thought they ruled the school, Filkins and Ronnie included. Anna snapped herself outside of her thoughts, she shouldn't be labelling herself, let alone other people. Anna gave David a quick smile to stop him questioning her. They made their way along to the cafeteria and picked up a blue tray each. Anna glanced around and to her dismay she saw Ronnie and Filkins. They were up near the front of the queue pushing people out of the way and knocking cups and trays off their racks. She was suddenly glad to be at the back of the line. Anna chose macaroni cheese with a slice of garlic bread and David chose the curry with baked beans. They sat at the back of the hall with the rest of David's friends. Anna took a bite of her garlic bread and threw the rest back down on her plate moodily. David turned away from discussing math club with his friends to look at her, \"Hey, what's wrong?\" Anna turned her head, looking from him to his friends and back, waiting for things to finally click into place. David deflated, his expression crumpling. \"You don't like hanging out with us, do you?\" His lower lip trembled for a second. He had stumbled upon a gorgeous, older and kind girl who after all didn't like him anyway. Anna picked up her garlic bread and starting ripping pieces apart in her hands, she had lost her appetite. \"I just don't think I fit in.\" She muttered, giving the kids on the next table an envious glance. They were the kind of kids she wanted to hang out with. They were all attractive, free people with piercings and eyeliner and black nails. They had tanned skin and mischievous smiles and her insides ached just looking at them. They were perfect. The tall one she had spoken to at the bus stop was flicking his Zippo on and off under the table. Anna's fingers twitched. She briefly wondered if they were threatening enough as a group that Filkins left them alone. Anna turned back to David, \"You don't mind, do you?\" David sighed again, \"No.\" He replied forlornly. Anna grinned at him and gave him a quick peck on the cheek as thanks. David blushed the colour of beetroot and mumbled something back. Anna grabbed her bag and went over to sit at their table. She sat down and introduced herself. The others grinned and invited her on in to their conversation. She felt a rush of warmth go through her. She missed her old friends but these were quickly becoming good replacements. They sat discussing who were better, The Clash or The Sex Pistols. Their conversation turned animated and a boy flicked a piece of pasta at her. She gasped, and then flicked a piece of tomato spaghetti back at him. His name was Joseph and he was very tall with light brown hair and sparkling green eyes. He had thick black platforms and a red ring on his index finger. Grinning, he took a small handful of pasta and chucked it at her. Anna dodged but not well enough, the tomato skimming her bare side and leaving a orange mark. Anna laughed, \"You're in for it now, Joseph.\" She fisted her neighbour's macaroni and sent it flying at where Joseph's head was. Where it was . Joseph had of course ducked and the mass of yellow cheese had gone flying at the back of someone else's head. Anna sat there shocked before bursting out laughing. Her body convulsed with spasms of hysterical laughter which racked her body, nearly making her fall of her seat, and the worse she felt, the more she laughed. Anna looked up once more and the laughter stopped. It didn't slow down, or ebb away, but stopped all at once, as if the wind had been knocked from her. Filkins had turned around, his eyes a murderous black. Anna swallowed. Everyone sitting at the table chuckled lowly, not wanting to antagonise him further. He didn't stand a chance against them when they were all together, but he could sure pick them off one by one. Anna couldn't even mutter an apology before he sent a full cup of coke over her head. Anna raised her hands and wiped the brown liquid out of her eyes, smudging her makeup everywhere. She gave him a murderous gaze back and picked up her drink, sending it over in his direction with more aim this time. It hit him square on the nose and wiped that smirk off his handsome face. He was dripping with the liquid now, and a wet patch had emanated from his neck line downwards. Anna stood up slowly and Filkins walked over to meet her. They stood facing each other square on before lunging forward. Filkins knocked her to the food strewn ground first. They skidded back a few metres before stopping just short of David's table. His mouth dropped open and a weird gurgling sound came out. Anna groaned as her head smacked against the ground. Filkins reached for some food on David's table and brought it down on Anna's face, rubbing it in. She cursed and swung her fist around to hit him on the cheek. There was just enough power in that to stop him momentarily. Anna took the chance and jutted her knee up which sent Filkins doubling over in pain. There were jeers and shouts echoing throughout the entire dining hall. He rolled over on his side and Anna got to her feet, using the table to pull herself up. David handed her a napkin and she accepted, wiping the food off her face. She looked down at Filkins who was still rolling over on the floor, then up at Ronnie who looked completely lost. She took David's drink and poured it all over Filkins. And of course this huge charade hadn't gone unnoticed by teachers. They were beginning to crowd around and one pulled Anna slightly off to one side, away from Filkins. The Principal, goddammit , was striding over, his face red and impossibly angry. \"What the hell do you two think you're playing at?\" He bellowed. \"My office – NOW!\" Anna swallowed, literally on her first day she had landed herself in the principal's office. Deep trouble. But Anna was used to things like this, having acted of similar standard back in her old school. Anna grabbed another napkin from David's table and wiped the rest of the mash potato and whatever else off her face. She held her head high and walked straight past everyone, smiling as a wave of applause exploded around the cafeteria. It was silenced when Filkins got to his feet and looked around, singling out potential victims for the weeks to come. The principal, Mr Fowley, had changed his mind and ordered both of them to go get cleaned up before entering his office. Anna had rinsed the dirty parts of her hair and dried them in the hand drier, reapplied makeup and sprayed her perfume, hoping it would get rid of the smell of pizza. She stalked down the hall and nearly slammed the door against its hinges. \"You certainly took your time, Miss Reed.\" Mr Fowley gave her a less than savoury look. Anna grimaced and sat down next to Filkins. \"Sorry, Sir.\" She muttered. \"Now you, Terry, I'm not surprised to see in here,\" He frowned at Filkins before shifting his gaze over onto Anna, \"But, you , Anna, it's your first day here and already you're getting into food fights.\" When she didn't reply he added, \"I expected you to be old enough to know right from wrong.\" She gave him a sullen look and then began chipping her nail varnish off. \"I suppose you're going to tell me you weren't the one who started it?\" He grumbled. \"No, no...that was me.\" She said, looking up, \"But he's been misbehaving too.\" \"Doing what?\" He asked, interest piqued as he leant forward over his desk, resting his plump chin on clasped hands. \"He shoved a first grader into a locker!\" She exclaimed. \"Do you have any other witnesses? Because it's your word against his...\" Mr Fowley trailed off, scratching his lightly stubbled jaw. Anna huffed, looking from him to Filkins in disbelief, \"You think I'm lying?...\" Filkins let a smirk creep up onto his face. \"No, but in this school we don't take kindly to false accusations.\" He hitched his glasses further up his red nose. \"This is ridiculous.\" Anna muttered, leaning back in her chair. \"You will both spend one hour afterschool today in detention-\" He began \"Sir! I already have lunchtime detention today-\" Filkins sat up. \"Enough!\" Mr Fowley's eyes widened in a sudden burst of anger. \"You will both receive slips in your classes to where your detention is. There will be work for you to do and you will sit in silence, do I make myself clear?\" \"Crystal.\" They said in unison. Then they both looked at each other in surprise. Anna brushed it off and stood, exiting his office. ////////////////////////////////////// \"So, how much trouble are you in?\" David whispered to Anna. They were sitting at the back of the classroom in Art. The teacher, Mrs Landrieu, was fast asleep behind her desk, a paintbrush still encased in her spindly fingers. \"I've got an afterschool today,\" She unravelled a small yellow piece of paper, \"With...Mr Stevenson. Who's he?\" \"Oh gosh...maybe this really is your worst first day ever.\" He smiled a little afterwards, as if enjoying an inside joke. Anna cocked an eyebrow. \"Who is he?\" She put the piece of paper inside her jeans pocket and returned to doodling. \"He, apart from Mr Fowley, is one of the strictest teachers at this school,\" He gave a visible shudder, \"Can I tell you something?\" He asked, leaning over. \"Yeah sure.\" She replied. \"He scares me.\" David whispered in her ear. \"Ha!\" She snorted. \"What?\" He crumpled again, like when he found out she didn't want to sit with him at lunch. \"He's a teacher, how bad could he possibly be?\" ////////////////////////////////////// Anna jumped back in her seat as Mr Stevenson slammed his hands on her desk, leaning over her. \"Do I need to remind you again, Miss Reed, that you're supposed to be working in complete silence?\" He snarled in his silkily dangerous voice. His gray blue eyes pierced hers. Anna swallowed, shaking her head. \"Good.\" He purred, his lips curving up into a deadly smirk. Anna watched him retract his perfectly manicured hands from her desk and fold them away in the pockets of his perfectly pressed black suit. Anna sighed as he seated himself behind his desk, going back to work on his laptop. His defined features illuminated by the screen. She huffed again and got back on with her work. He probably still lives with his parents , Anna mused in a comforting afterthought. Earlier on, Mr Stevenson had specifically explained to her that the paper she had to do was an internal exam and would not reflect on any of her grades. It was purely to see what she already knew and where to go next. He had then told Filkins that the exam he was going to do in silence would be an external exam and would determine whether he would have to go to summer school which started in under three months. Strangely enough, they were sitting exactly the same English exam, but the consequences of failing were very different indeed. They were a mere five minutes in when Mr Stevenson announced to the two pupils that he was going to carry on with some audio type learning on his laptop. He plugged his ear phones in, looked over at them suspiciously one last time, and was dead to the world. Filkins looked over at Anna, \"Psst.\" She turned her head slightly to the other side. \"Psst!\" This time louder, \"What's the answer to number two A?\" The answer was a conjugated verb, and it was worth 3 marks, maybe the difference between a C- and a D+. \"Why would I tell you ?\" She shot back. \"Because,\" He grinned at her, \"I can make your life hell, doll face.\" \"Up yours.\" She spat, returning to her work. \"C'mon, Anna.\" He said, a desperate edge leaking into his tone. \"You should have listened in class, doll face.\" She gave him a crooked grin which didn't reach her eyes, which remained cold and uncaring. Filkins gave her a furious glare which made the hairs rise along her spine. \"If I fail, I'm coming for you.\" He promised. A/N: Left you all on a cliffhanger...please review! ;)[Chapter 3] A/N: Please review – only takes a second and gives me motivation! I don't know where to go from here so some suggestions would be good ;) Anna lay awake that night, tossing and turning in her sheets which were tangled around her ankles. She sat up in a huff and looked at her bed side clock – it was 3:49am. Sighing, she took a long sip from the glass of water on the table and stood up, before falling flat on her face, her ankles bound together. \"Uuuurrggh.\" She groaned through the fluffy carpet. Anna heaved herself up and walked down to the kitchen for a midnight snack. She returned to her room half full with cold pasta. Anna picked up her school bag and carried it over to her window, sitting down on the sofa/bed which was pushed up against the low window. She retrieved her pack of Marlboro Red and her little pink lighter and laid them upon the windowsill. She dumped her bag down, watching as her lip balm rolled out from an inner pocket. Anna opened the window as far as it could go and lit a cigarette, blowing bluish grey smoke which drifted over her front garden. She watched the window belonging to the house on the other side of street. Before long Anna had smoked all of her cigarettes and it was already morning. A sudden desperate thought came to the forefront of her mind, I hope Filkins passes his exam. Because if he didn't, she was well and truly screwed. ////////////////////////////////////// Anna joined everyone else at the bus stop, but unlike last time she pushed to the front amidst the annoyed hisses from the other kids. She pushed through and collapsed on the back row, propping her boots up on the seat in front of her and laying her head back. The bus ride seemed to take much less time. The tall boy with black hair from the day before wasn't there. Instead she was sitting on the same row as a very skinny cheerleader with a pink phone. Anna was the last to get off and reached the top of the stairs as slowly as possible. She kept looking over her shoulder, wary of the people who would push past her too quickly, keep staring a second too long. She was losing it already and it was only the second day of school. The day went as per usual, except that Filkins and Ronnie not in any of her classes thankfully. In the break in between fourth and fifth period, Anna made her way through the throng of people and leant her forehead against her locker. She exhaled slowly. When she finally opened her eyes again no one was there. The last echoes of the bell rung in her ear. A low groan escaped her lips as she opened her locker, storing her books inside, one by one. When Anna leant back to close her locker another hand slammed it shut from behind. The hand stayed leaning into her locker and Anna recognised the pale skin and black hoodie sleeve. She swallowed and moved to the left but another hand slammed down on the next locker. Anna slowly turned around, her back pressed against the blue metal. Anna forced her eyes up to meet the cool blue ones of Terry Filkins. Which consequently were only inches from hers. \"Hey there...\" She breathed, her voice trembling slightly. \"Guess what.\" He growled, his lips pulled wide in a grin. Anna shook her head slowly, oh god oh god he didn't... \"I got an F. Now I have to do Summer School,\" He moved closer, \"And guess who's fault that is...\" \"It's not mine!\" She suddenly said indignantly. \"Yes it is.\" Filkins was so close now his breath was tickling her lips. Filkins grabbed her wrists with brute strength and held them against the lockers behind her. He moved his head into the crook of her neck and inhaled deeply, slowly. \"Terry and Anna, stop that disgusting behaviour this moment!\" Terry wrenched back his head and released her hands. Miss Robinson was standing there, hands on her hips and lips pursed. Anna let out a sigh of relief. \"We were just having a chat, Miss Robinson.\" Filkins answered first. Anna nodded, unable to give even a fleeting glance at Filkins. \"Well get to class then, this is no time for talking!\" Miss Robinson huffed and walked off, looking at Anna one more time. Was that pity she saw in her eyes? As soon as she had rounded the corner, Filkins turned back to Anna once more. He pushed her into the lockers with his hands on her forearms. \"After school,\" He muttered, a dangerous glint in his blue eyes, \"Better be ready.\" And with that he winked and walked off. ////////////////////////////////////// Anna was left on the ground, having sunk down to her knees and curled up after he left. She only raised her head when someone came over and patted her shoulder. \"Are you alright?\" Anna lifted her head and peered at the girl through tear stained lashes. Anna raised an eyebrow. \"Sorry,\" the girl mumbled, \"Stupid question...well, whatever you're going through – you can always talk to the student counselling office.\" She brushed her fringe from her brown eyes and extended a hand. Anna hesitated before taking it and smoothing out her top. \"Where is it?\" She croaked. Anna cleared her throat and managed a weak smile. \"Down the hall on the right, past the poster for healthy eating and the new class president.\" She smiled at Anna. \"Thank you.\" Anna replied, turning and making her way down the hall. She turned in and leant on the little window ledge, knocking patiently on the glass window. Her hand fell in on the third knock as it slid open to reveal a boy and a girl around her age. The boy paid no attention to Anna, his interests lying on the screen of his computer. \"Hi, I'm Amy - what can we do you for?\" The girl leaned over the window, speaking in a low voice, like she was wary of people eavesdropping. Anna glanced around first to see if they were around. When she was satisfied they were not there staring at her, she turned back to the girl. \"I'm having some, erm...trouble with bullying.\" Anna trailed off, her voice getting quieter. \"Well, are you getting bullied by someone in your year?\" The girl asked. \"No, they're in the year above me.\" The girl exhaled slowly, thinking carefully, \"Are they girls - who are bullying you?\" \"No, it's two guys.\" Anna sneaked a glance up at the girl. Amy had visibly stiffened. \"Tell me it's not Filkins...\" \"Trust me, I'd love to,\" Anna paused, \"Please help me.\" \"I can't.\" She replied. \"Why not?\" Anna groaned with dismay, leaning over. \"I complained once about him...and ended up having three months of therapy for it.\" Anna gasped softly, what? She had to have therapy? \"Really? Was it that bad?\" \"You wouldn't believe me if I told you.\" She answered, taking her blonde hair and pushing it over her shoulder to reveal a thin white scar the length of her forefinger. It was placed just under her jaw, like it was caused by someone holding a knife to her throat. This left Anna lost for words. Was Filkins really a monster underneath his shallow exterior? \"He won't leave me alone.\" Anna murmured. \"There's nothing you can do...except...\" Amy answered, a small smile playing on her lips. \"What?\" Anna's lips quirked upwards in hope. \"Play him at his own game.\" She said simply. ////////////////////////////////////// Anna left at the end of her last lesson with a new found confidence, maybe she could do it. Maybe she could fight fire with fire, if Filkins was smart enough to tease her she was sure as hell smart enough to tease him back. She strode out of college, biting her lower lip to keep the smile off her lips. This would be interesting. Anna's stomach still dropped when she noticed him at the bottom of the road. Steeling herself, she closed her eyes momentarily before walking straight towards him. He tilted his chin up as she approached, her brown hair bouncing around her shoulders as she ran down the stairs. \"You want me?\" She asked as she reached him. Filkins nodded through half-lidded eyes. \"Then come and get me.\" Filkins grinned before moving forwards and placing a hand on the back of her neck. He moved in to kiss her and Anna was ready. Their mouths moved together in perfect sync, lips parting and testing each other. But as soon as he grabbed her waist Anna bit down on his tongue hard and kneed him where it hurts. She stepped back, breathing heavily and a little out of depth. What am I doing? I can't lead him on, that'll just make him more angry... \"What the fuck did you do that for?\" He yelled, clutching his mouth. Anna noticed she had attracted quite the crowd, and now they were all watching attentively for her next move. Anna jutted out her leg and kicked him in the chest, sending him back into a large bin. He landed and sunk in so his knees were over the edge. He was stuck. Anna stifled a giggle. \"Guess you just can't handle me.\" Anna said, trying to stop her voice from shaking with fear. She gave him a steely glare before walking off in the general direction of her home. She had just missed the bus but didn't care, walking would probably clear her mind of all this mess. Filkins didn't follow her and for that she was eternally grateful, she probably couldn't out run him and wasn't in the mood to. When Anna reached her house she closed the door and went straight to the fridge. She rifled through the vegetable drawer and found Mum's not-very-well-hidden bottle of 'secret' vodka. She unscrewed the lid and poured herself a generous amount into a clean mug and downed it in one. She then wandered upstairs, feeling empty and confused. She sat down on the middle of her floor with a thud, her eyes fixed on her lip balm which had fallen out her bag the night before. Anna didn't move for a long time, and she still didn't move when her Mother got home. She didn't eat anything for dinner and went to sleep early, many worries plaguing her mind. A/N: Sorry for the shorted chapter – hopefully next one might be longer...[Chapter 4] A/N: I know it's been a while but omg GCSE REVISION GUYS. Ronnie watched as Filkins threw a stone at a pedestrian, and then sped off in his black Mustang '69 before they could even turn around. They were bunking off, courtesy of the embarrassment from the day before and test he had in Workshop. They slowed at the corner where a very attractive blonde was crossing the street. Filkins leant out the window and gave her a wolf whistle. She turned and winked at him, offering a cute wave and continuing to walk off. So he still had it. So why didn't Anna want it? Yeah, she had kissed him, but then she had humiliated him in front of the whole school. Well, maybe not the whole school but he hated being made fun of. But he also admired her for standing up for herself, the kid had spunk. No matter how much he drank or shouted out he couldn't free his mind from the feeling of her heavenly lips on his. He had never experienced anything like it before. And he wanted more. Filkins gripped the steering wheel tighter when he thought back to that moment when the back of his legs hit that trash bin. The burning desire fused with hatred had singed his veins. He slammed his foot down on the accelerator and shot through two sets of traffic lights. Ronnie chuckled, leaning back and holding on to the top of the open window. They zoomed along the street, passing shops and houses and skate parks. They drove along to the beach and sat smoking with the windows rolled down for about an hour. \"Hey, I'm hungry.\" Ronnie muttered. \"Well, let's go get somethin' then.\" Filkins replied, flicking his stub out onto the pavement. \"I haven't got any money, have you?\" Ronnie turned his head in Filkins' direction. \"Nah.\" He answered as his gaze swept over the horizon. \"Well we better go back to school then. At least they have free food.\" Ronnie grunted. \"I already told you I'm not going back in there.\" Filkins growled. \"I'm hungry.\" Ronnie growled back. Filkins didn't have the energy to stare him down so he gave in, speeding rapidly off back towards the school. ///////////////////////// ///////////////// A beam of light glanced down on Anna's worksheet. She moved her paper so the corner was in the sunshine. She then proceeded to draw a skull, weaving in poison ivy along the jaw. David leaned over and murmured something along the lines of, we really should be getting on with the third question, but she ignored him. Anna felt a sense of dread deep inside her gut. With the passing of yesterday's events she didn't for one moment think that there wouldn't be repercussions. In all honesty Anna was immensely glad both Filkins and Ronnie hadn't been sighted this morning by either her or David. A slow ache sat deep in the back of her head from the half bottle of vodka she consumed yesterday. She usually didn't suffer from hangovers but this one was getting to her. At break Anna had nothing interesting to do, so she grabbed David and decided to follow Filkins for a little while, just to see what his daily routine was like. David kept reminding her that she was treading on very thin ice but Anna wanted to find out more about him. What made him tick. Also what made him angry, which she would duly take note of and try to avoid doing in the future. They kept a fair distance behind, Anna watching Filkins and David watching Ronnie with a very worried expression. The bell sounded out as they turned a corner. \"C'mon, Anna!\" David urged her. Anna didn't reply, but instead walked over to a first grader who was opening their locker and told them to walk away. She pretended to get something out, hiding her face but all the while staring at Filkins. She looked past them and saw the three terrified kids from the first day. \"Hey, look!\" Ronnie said, taking his sunglasses off and grinning, \"The Siamese Queers had a baby.\" \"I guess that makes them triplets now, doesn't it?\" Filkins added in a low voice. Anna could see he was playing with his food. It sent an unwelcome shiver down her neck. \"Well, actually, we still wouldn't be triplets, see, they'd be my parents and I'd be the baby-\" Emmett started. \"Don't get smart with me.\" Filkins cut across him, and Anna could imagine the dangerous glint in his eye, \" I said you're triplets and I think you need to get into his shirt, and be triplets.\" Anna watched as they cowered in front of them, not nearly as tall. It was like three children going up against two fully grown men. \"We can do that.\" Emmett said, desperately wanting to leave without getting seriously injured. \"You know what?\" Ryan pushed Emmett aside, \"Emmett, shut up, look, do you really have to do this crap, guys? C'mon, give us a break - it's the second day at school!\" Anna's heart beat a little faster, knowing they wouldn't have enjoyed being talked back to. She watched as Filkins and Ronnie simultaneously cocked their heads to one side. \"Hey, I like this kid,\" Ronnie growled, a smile still on his face. He shoved Ryan on the shoulder, Filkins and Ronnie walking them back into the lockers, \"Yeah...double-stuff's got an attitude .\" Anna heard their bags make contact with the lockers. The little office that Anna had asked for help in not long ago shut its blinds, not wanting to be involved in any way with what might happen next. \"Yeah,\" Filkins leant down over Ryan, Ronnie right next to him, \"We have to this shit, because it's hilarious.\" He stepped right to hover over Emmett, \"This school, is boring, watching you freak out,\" He moved onto Wade, \"Amuses me, and yeah...it's just the second day of school,\" Filkins moved back to Emmett who was rocking back and forward, \"So guess what, it's gonna keep coming,\" Filkins said to Ryan, \"And coming,\" He leaned right into Emmett, \"And coming!\" His hand shot out to grab Wade around the neck and hold him still. He brought up another hand and flicked him on the forehead, a smirk on his lips. \"Filkins!\" Anna shouted before she could stop herself. David ran away faster than she would have thought possible. Why the fuck did I just do that. \"Well, look what we have here.\" Filkins said as he turned to face her. Ronnie spun around as well. The other three sprinted off down the corridor. Anna turned but no one was there. The second bell rung and nearly everyone were already in their lessons. Anna was glad she could save the first graders but now she was the centre of the attention. Not exactly what she had wanted. \"Right,\" Anna started, closing the locker and edging backwards, \"I should really be off to my next lesson...\" She whipped around and started to speed walk to her next lesson. Filkins decided to let it go, just enjoying the swaying of her hips as she went out of view. ///////////////////////// /////////////// At lunch she joined her friends and went off to the library. Not her choice. They were crowded around the Folk Lore and Occult section. Anna chuckled when she found out there was one. As the others pored over books explaining the pentagram, Anna watched the kid, who was nearly shut in a locker, work on his laptop. She zoned out, following his little hands moving deftly over the keyboard. Suddenly, a figure came along out from an aisle and poured his drink all over the keypad. Anna broke out of her daze as her eyes shot up to see Filkins as he smirked. Steam rose from the laptop as he squeaked, eyes wide. Ana dived behind the bookcase and peered around the edge. \"What are you doing?\" Joseph murmured in a deep voice. \"Nothing.\" Anna replied, blushing guiltily. \"You're looking at Terry, aren't you?\" He said in a low, almost bored, tone. \"I, er- NO!\" She exclaimed finally. \"Then what are you looking at?\" \"I, erm, well I was looking at-\" \"You were looking at him, weren't you?\" \"Shut up, Joseph.\" She snapped. Anna glared at him before straightening and walking past him as casually as possible. Her 'friends' probably wouldn't notice if she slipped out anyway. She exited the library and met up with David outside who walked her to the canteen. She was at the end of the queue and had paid when Filkins was standing in front of her. He blocked her way as she tried to scoot past. \"What?\" Anna snapped. \"You wanna go out sometime?\" He asked, arms folded and looming over her. Anna's jaw dropped a little. What did he just say? She recovered quickly though and tried to answer his question with indifference. \"Not with you I don't.\" Anna answered, trying once again to side-step him. David was behind Filkins, looking at the ground as Ronnie leaned over him. \"Well what's wrong with me?\" His blue eyes burnt hers. Anna scoffed, did he really just say that? \"Well, apart from being incredibly stupid and ignorant, you're also arrogant, selfish, spiteful, narrow-minded and a bully .\" She finished, her cheeks slightly pink with the effort of ranting. Filkins looked taken aback for a second, \"You like getting high?\" He narrowed his eyes and let a small smile creep up onto his face. Anna answered unconvincingly, \"No.\" \"Come meet me outside my car after school, I'll set you up with some real grade A shit.\" He winked before walking past her, Ronnie following. \"But what if I don't-\" \"See you there.\" Filkins called over his shoulder. Anna huffed, gently pushing David along as they walked over to his usual table. She couldn't face Joseph and the rest of her new friends right now. Filkins strode away victorious, he had scored a date with the exact person he wanted all alone. Well, she may not think it was a date but Filkins had something in store for her that she would definitely not expect. A/N: Please review![Chapter 5] A/N: The last chapter was sitting on my computer for like three months aha sorry I completely forgot it was there. Enjoy this one though! The end of the school day came much faster than she would have liked. Filkins was waiting outside the front as promised, his front pocket bulging with what she could only assume as being a packet of dope. Oh yay. \"Shall we?\" He asked, his voice low and taunting. Anna took a deep breath and let it out slowly, eyeing him warily. She made a mental note to keep her eyes on him just in case he tried anything. \"Fine.\" She replied, taking the hand he offered. But instead of holding it gently like she had expected he yanked her close and threw the arm around her shoulder. He guided her over to his car which was sitting in the parking lot. \"I thought we were doing this round the back...\" She said, looking back over her shoulder at the familiar school which was slowly getting smaller the further she got from it. \"You think I'd spark up a joint at school?\" He scoffed, making her feel small, \"How stupid do you think I am?\" \"Don't answer that.\" He added, watching as she smirked. They got to his black mustang and Filkins flung the door open, startling Ronnie who was sat in the passenger seat. \"Get out.\" Filkins ordered. \"But I thought we were-\" Ronnie protested. \"Now.\" Filkins glared. He watched as Ronnie got out of the car, scowling. \"See ya later.\" He grumbled moodily before striding off, broad shoulders swinging above Anna's head. Filkins opened the door a little wider, indicating for Anna to take the seat. She looked around once more for David or someone else but she could see no one. Filkins gave her a nudge in the back. \"So where are we going?\" She asked, putting one foot up on the dashboard. \"Hey!\" He said, leaning over and shoving her foot off. He pulled out of the parking lot with surprising speed, the car's engine revving contently. They made it out of the school grounds without hitting anyone, although they got awfully close to a lot of eighth graders. And a teacher. The three boys, which were favourites of Filkins to terrorize, appeared at the bottom of the steps but Anna rolled the window up and leaned forward so he wouldn't notice. \"Back to my place.\" He said, the car surging forward. Anna couldn't help but smirk despite how nervous she was, \"Little cliché, don't you think?\" Filkins gave her a look. \"I know the perfect place.\" She assured him, a smile still on her lips even though her stomach was rolling like a rough wave. They drove around for at least ten minutes, Anna pointing in the general direction of where she wanted to go, and soon enough they were at the edge of an industrial park. \"Really?\" Filkins asked as the car slowed to a stop. \"Yeah, trust me no one ever comes out here.\" She said, having been here a total of three times. She had no idea if a gang met here weekly or anything because she had only been in her new house for two weeks. As Filkins slowed to a stop outside a beaten up chicken wire fence, Anna remained positively nauseas. They exited the car and Anna squeezed through a small hole in the corner which looked like it had been ripped back by a wild animal. Filkins followed after some help from Anna, seeing as he was much larger and caught his hoodie in the twisted metal. \"Why don't you take that thing off its boiling out here!\" She said loudly, spreading her arms out and spinning around once, squinting. Filkins had allowed himself a smile and rolled his sleeves up. When they were inside and comfortable, two floors up and backs against a concrete wall just underneath a large broken window. A light breeze wafted in, carrying an evening smell with it of car fumes and blossom. Filkins rolled a joint and sparked it up with a worn Zippo. It took them half an hour to finish it, every toke sending Anna further down the wall until she was slumped against him, head resting on his shoulder. Another half hour and the weed had taken full effect. \"Told you it was some dope shit.\" He said slowly. \"Yeah...\" She trailed off, eyes half-lidded and a smile on her lips. \"You know you smell really good.\" She added as he swung an arm over her head to hang off her shoulders. \"You smell good too,\" Filkins replied, staring at a spot somewhere past the wall. Anna nestled closer and pulled his face down to hers. She pressed her lips to his for a long two seconds and then pulled away, leaning her head on his thigh, \"Night, night.\" She said, and then fell asleep. ///////////////////////// ///////////// Anna leaned against her locker, lighter in one hand. She fiddled with the safety catch, thinking about the night before. Her bored eyes wandered along the corridor, watching as people unloaded books from their lockers. David nudged her and pointed over in the direction of the principal's office. Anna's eyebrows furrowed as she watched Filkins walk in, a scowl on his sharp features. He emerged seven minutes later, scowl turned smirk. \"Hey!\" She called out, and then realised she didn't know why she wanted to talk to him, maybe to mention what had happened the previous night. David quickly scarpered. Filkins stalked over, his smirk widening. \"What was that about?\" She asked, nodding over at Fowley's office. \"Some kids think I'm bullying them, mad isn't it?\" He said, landing a hand on the lockers behind her. \"Yeah.\" She agreed with a frightful sigh, her back pushed firmly against the wall. \"Wanna go for a smoke?\" He asked. It was nearing the end of the day and afterwards they could escape this hell hole. \"Sure.\" She replied, pushing off the wall and out of his breathing space. They made their way down to the bottom of the school, outside in the sun even though Filkins refused to take his hoodie off. They sat on the steps, joined by a few other kids who were worthy of his company. Twenty minutes on and there was nothing to do. \"Hey, you want a little rap sesh?\" Ronnie asked, giving Filkins a friendly punch on the shoulder. \"Sure.\" Filkins said, after looking over at Anna who looked a little on edge. Anna then watched patiently as Filkins threw a few words out, sounding and looking a little like Eminem. She then watched as the three boys came over. Furrowing her brows at their stupidity, she watched for their next move. \"What's up, what's up?\" Ryan muttered, pushing through some much taller seniors and standing in front of Filkins and Ronnie. \"What's up?\" Filkins said after a while, his mocking gaze slightly surprised. \"I wanna rap wit 'chu,\" Ryan said, smiling, \"Flip the script, Ron, hit that beat.\" He told Ronnie, who looked at him almost dumbfounded. \"Yo, this cool, Fil?\" He asked. \"Sure, whatever.\" Filkins replied, not wanting to lost face in front of Anna, although he wasn't so sure why he cared. As Ronnie started to beat box, Ryan started, \"Yo, call me whatever you want, but you knows I get busy, I'm so badass, I'm the king of Vice City, like the food of I'm Zen lock, like the back of my ben, I tell suckas, say hello to my little friend.\" And they the crowd echoed an impressed 'Oooh.\" \"Oh snap, this guy.\" Ronnie laughed. Filkins gave Ryan a malevolent glance, seeing an opportunity to humiliate him in front of everyone. \"Hey meatball, where's ya spaghetti, ya rapping's like a nightmare, but I don't see Freddy, ya best not even try to spit rhymes, dude, cause when ya speak all I ever see is chewed up food.\" \"Yeah, that's how we roll!\" Ronnie boomed over the louder crowd. Before he could crumble, Ryan jumped back in. \"Oh no, you didn't just go there, I got more skills than you in my one and only nut hair. So you better step up before insulting me and mine, cause if you decide to step up, I'm like a landmine - boom boom!\" He finished, arms outstretched, to which the crowd all cheered. More kids had joined at the back and there were now at least fifty onlookers. \"Oh my god, look, it's a punk ass rapid, he said what my word, I might have to bitch slap him, so surprised you're moving, as you're so damn fat, you're lucky I don't hit you with my wiffle wiffle ball bat.\" Filkins was nearly yelling now, his blood beginning to boil. \"That hurt my head with a bat, I'm the incredible Hulk, I'm like Costco, I'm serving ass-kicking's in bulk! You don't like my words, Mr King of the school, well guess what, you can suck on my family jewels, bitch.\" Ryan ended with his hands around his privates but Anna could see the excitement ebb from his face upon looking at Filkin's reaction. By this point the crowd had gone mental and Filkins looked like he was about to skin Ryan alive. With his hands. Ryan quickly exited the area and went out of sight. \"Right, let's go, before you regret something.\" Anna said, not wanting to be at the end of his anger but not wanting anyone else to be either, so she hauled him up the stairs to the right and along the walkway. Filkins peeked round the corner and say the trio ascending. \"Don't-\" Anna started but he was already gone, she watched him slide down the middle banister as Ronnie took the steps two at a time. As Wade spotted them he became silent and Emmett froze. Ryan instantly thought 'I knew this would backfire'. \"Think you're so funny?\" Filkins growled as Ronnie came up behind them, blocking any exit. \"Good,\" He continued, \"Cause you're not gonna laugh when you're dead. You're gonna get it now, worse than ever.\" He promised, already having a few things in mind. \"All of you.\" He added, his piercing gaze sweeping over each boy. \"Ryan,\" Wade hissed, \"Hold back technique.\" Ryan then grabbed both of Wade's arms. \"You don't like the fact that he's better than you, Filkins, you better back the hell off before I-\" And then Filkin's arm shot out without much effort, effectively flooring Wade and knocking both him and Ryan sideways. Emmett gasped as he watched Wade roll around on the floor. \"Thanks for holding him for me.\" Filkins said, walking away. Ronnie, still chuckling, leant over, \"Holy crap, you guys are retarded!\" He cried before laughing again and following Filkins. Anna, having seen the whole thing just turned and walked away. She knew she was wrong for trusting him to be a 'nicer' guy. A/N: Please review! ","Summary":" A/N: I think I'll leave this as a couple of chapters rated T, but if you like it and want more – ju"},{"Movie":"Dumbo","Title":"The Dumbo in Love","Author":"veronica.toon.7","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11804168","Passage":"[Chapter 1] Chapter 1: On First Sight So my first Dumbo fic. After many years of not seeing and then recently seeing some clips of the movie online, I fell in love with it all over again. And thus I decided to show my appreciation of the movie through my work. I predict this takes place after the movie, Dumbo still is the world famous flying elephant in the circus and he lives happily with his mother and everyone treats him much better than they did before. Also he also has some developed speech patterns. I own nothing. The movie Dumbo and all its content belongs to Disney. I don't own the cover image either. I only own my OC's, Gem and Dahlia. Enjoy the story! The circus. The bright lights, the scent of wet dust in the ring, the crowds anticipating with excitement for every new thing to happen. The smells of sweaty animals and performers as they perform fantastic tricks and the cotton candy, popcorn and snowcones they have to enjoy while watching. Trapeze artists swung above, clowns did their humorous antics for hilarity and all sorts of animals performed feats of trains abilities. But the most exciting part of this circus was none other than the elephants. And the star attraction of them all, the world famous flying elephant, Dumbo. The crowd watched in hushed silence as they watched the pyramid of pachyderms stack higher and higher. Some had already seen this trick before and were crossing their fingers as they hoped it wouldn't end like the first time it did. About a year ago, the stack of elephants had toppled down, bringing the big top down with it and caused mass hysteria in the audience, all because of one elephant's clumsiness by tripping on his own ears. But now this night would put ot all behind them. A voice called out in the audience as the climax came forth. All eye looked up to the ceiling and a spotlight turned on and shone at the figure soaring through the air. The crowd immediately roared with happiness as their favorite flying elephant soared through the air, decorated finely with a colorful yellow and red collar, pilot goggles and hat with a little flag waving in his little trunk. He circled around the top of the stack and everyone held his breath as he grew closer and closer. Suddenly, he alighted down. The stack wobbled a bit from the extra weight, but then... kept still. A fanfare played and the audience went onto their feet with applause as the pyramid of pachyderms was complete with the little flying elephant on top, waving his flag proudly above all the rest. It was such a fantastic act to see. The elephants in the stack and the circus performers were proud that their idea had finally come to a success, and no one was more prouder than the lone elephant and mouse standing beside the curtain, cheering Dumbo on. The two were the first to greet him when the curtain went down and the show ended. Timothy, the little brown mouse and Dumbo's manager, ran up to him and scurried into his hat, praising him for a job well done. Dumbo beamed with happiness and came rushing towards his other supporter, his mother, Mrs. Jumbo. She immediately outstretched her trunk and entwined it lovingly with his. \"You were magnificent out there, son,\" she said softly to him. He nuzzled into her warm embrace even further. He had grown a little taller over the past year and now came up to her knee in height. His ears still remained as large and functional than ever, though he still had to bat them harder to make up for his extra height and weight. She smiled gently at him. Then came the other elephants, the other ones in the act. If by instinct, Mrs. Jumbo shielded her son from them as the other walked past them. Now it wasn't like they mistreated the either of them now anymore, but in the past both of them, especially her son, had been ridiculed by the other lady elephants in the circus. The gossiped, looked down upon and most of all outright insulted him in the past and even now Jumbo still believed them to be a bad influence to hang around now, so they typically stayed to themselves. The small herd of them disappeared behind a curtain in the tent to where some hay was pitched for them. Dumbo, Mrs. Jumbo and Timothy had there own special part in the circus just for them, but since the other elephant's talking now was so loud and going onto an interesting subject, they decided to stay for a little while and listen. \"Oh my. What a performance. You know for a second there I thought for sure that the stack was going to fall down again and bring the big top down with it like last time,\" one of the ladies said, receiving much agreement with it. Mrs. Jumbo and Timothy narrowed their eyes at the topic while Dumbo looked shamefully down at his feet at the painful memory. \"Oh yes, same here for me too. You know, when I felt the weight from the top come down on my back, I was sure my legs were going to give way,\" said another. Her prefered choice of decor on her head and back was orange with yellow tassels. \"Yes, yes. Glad that's all over now. For the sake of all us proud elephants, let us hope that we never have to go through that ever again,\" said another. She was an older lady who preferred to wear bright magenta with gold tassels and big, light blue feathers in her costume. \"Agreed. Well girls, now I have a mouthful for you,\" said another younger one who wore a more vibrant lime with mint colored feathers and several gold tassels in her outfit. The other ladies murmured and leaned in closer to hear. \"Well, word on the street is that another circus is coming to town and since we can't reschedule ours there's going to be some competition trying to see who gets the most audience.\" The talking continued, Mrs. Jumbo stretched her trunk down to go over her son's back and Timothy scoffed. \"Pfft, as if they could beat us. We got the world famous, flying elephant on our side, what do they have,\" he said proudly. \"Well, why the competition, dearie,\" asked one. \"Hold on, I'm getting to it. They saw in the circus right next door they have a new elephant calf, Dahlia they call her. She's the daughter of a former one of our own elephants that they bought over, Gem.\" As several elephants started griping about her 'betrayal' to the other side, Mrs. Jumbo brightened up at the mention of the name. \"Gem,\" she whispered quietly. A image of her friend when they were calves playing together came into her mind. After the other circus bought her and took her away, she hadn't heard hide or hair since then. She wondered if her childhood friend still remembered her. \"Anyways, they're saying that her calf is the just the cutest, most adorable and talented thing there is. It makes me sick to think about it, any traitor to our circus can't have an offspring that is that praised.\" Murmurs of agreement followed. Mrs. Jumbo narrowed her eyes of the insults being given at her old friend. She started leaning her head down to Dumbo's head where Timothy stood. \"Timothy, do you think you could do me a favor,\" she asked softly. Said mouse turned up and gave her a crisp salute and a nod. \"Anything, Mrs. Jumbo. What do you need,\" he asked. Her trunk pointed to the curtain where the other ladies were behind. \"I think our 'friends' might need a reintroduction to you, don't you think,\" she replied. Timothy nodding, knowing very well where she was going with this. Mrs. Jumbo took her son's trunk into his and gently lead him away as Timothy went to work. As soon as the pair was out of the tent, the loud, frightened screams from the other elephants could be heard throughout the big top. \"Mother, where we going,\" Dumbo asked as he held onto his mother's tail as she lead him out into the great, big field outside the circus. \"Over there dear. Remember the other circus the ladies were talking about? Well, I have an old friend there who I haven't seen in awhile. I thought you and I would like to go visit her and her daughter,\" Mrs. Jumbo replied. Dumbo quickly let go of her tail and flapped his ears till he was above his mother's back where he landed and looked over her head into the distance. Sure enough, on the other side of the meadow he could see the big top, but like the one where they lived. Skylights blared and illuminated the sky above, even though the show was over. Something about the brilliance of the circus they were approaching told him they were going to find something really special indeed there. \"Gem,\" called out a soft voice in the night. A light grey elephant with forest green eyes and wearing a silver and red veil over her head and blanket looked up to the source of the voice. There, over the fence that kept she and her friends in for the night to graze, she saw another elephant with a calf on her back approaching. She narrowed her eyes to discern through the darkness who it was, but then widened with shock and hope. \"Jumbo dearie, is that you,\" she asked and immediately came over to the fence to greet her. Mrs. Jumbo nodded and came over to embrace her friend. Their trunks curved over each other as they pulled their heads in for a hug. \"My, my, my, it is you! It certainly has been so long since I've seen you last. You look absolutely mahvelous, darling. How've you been,\" she said as she pulled away but still held on to old her friend's trunk. \"Fine, thank you. Same to you I hope,\" Mrs. Jumbo replied, smiling widely. \"Oh wonderfully, thanks. Of course the other elephants here aren't much of healthy conversationalists, if you know what I mean by that, but they're still better then nothing. Thank you for asking anyways.\" She then caught sight of the calf on her friend's back. \"Oh, and who might this be?\" Mrs. Jumbo smiled widely and slowly used her trunk to place him down next to her. \"Gem, meet Dumbo, my son. Dumbo this is Gem, my good friend.\" He bashfully hid behind his mother's leg while Gem stared in surprise at him. \"Dumbo? As in the world's first flying elephant, Dumbo,\" she asked in shock. Mrs. Jumbo nodded proudly as Gem's face broke into a wide grin. \"Oh my word, Jumbo. I am so happy for you,\" she said as she reached out to hug her friend again. \"I always knew you were special, but this... this is just unbelievably amazing. You must be so proud,\" she said. \"I am. Now what's this I'm hearing about you having a famous calf of your own, hmm,\" Mrs. Jumbo playfully said. Gem quickly turned away and blushed. \"Oh Dahlia. My little daughter. Well she's not as famous as your son, but what can I say. She's just the most darling thing you've ever seen. Want me to go get her?\" Mrs. Jumbo nodded. \"I would love to see my best friend's daughter,\" she modestly replied. Gem's grin grew even wider if that was even possible. \"Nice to know you haven't changed a bit over the years. Still the same sweet and kind elephant I knew back in our childhood. Wait here, I'll go get her,\" she said as she took off a bit towards the tent, quietly not to disturb her fellow elephants and possibly cause a ruckus. She wasn't back a minute later, holding her trunk by her left front leg to another smaller trunk behind it. \"Dear friends, I'd like you to meet Dahlia, my precious daughter.\" Dumbo peaked his head a bit behind his mother's leg, just as Dahlia poked her head out. As soon as his eyes met hers, he felt his heartbeat accelerate in his chest. And I'll leave you there until the next chapter. Until then you can think of what Dahlia looks like. Thanks for reading, please leave a review with some feedback and I'll see you again next. Sincerely, v.t.7[Chapter 2] Chapter 2: My Feelings True Thanks for those who checked out my first chapter and thanks SennaFan4ever for reviewing. Now you'll get to find out what Dahlia looks like. I own nothing. The movie Dumbo and all its content belongs to Disney. I don't own the cover image either. I only own my OC's, Gem, Dahlia and Terrence. Enjoy the story! The first thing that Dumbo thought when he saw Dahlia was, \"She's is so pretty.\" She was the same light grey as her mom and it shone silvery in the moonlight. Her outfit consisted up a light pink tutu and a small silver tiara with a single red jewel in the middle on her head. She had a pink parasol in her trunk and she clutched in nervously as she looked at him. But what really made her gaze at her was her eyes, a calm, rich, beautiful ocean in each one. She was the most lovely thing he had ever seen. He nearly flinched when he felt something tap his back. He got over his shock and realized that Dahlia was tentatively holding out a pencil and pad of paper, asking silently for an autograph. He felt his cheeks begin to heat up in modesty as he took the pencil from her and scribbled his name in his best handwriting, er trunk-writing, to her before handing her back the pencil. She excitedly turned her pad around to look at it and smiled widely when she read what it said. From Dumbo. To my loveliest and biggest fan, Dahlia. She squealed in delight and began hopping around in joy. Dumbo watched amazed as she gracefully, yet happily bounded about. Dahlia was quite the graceful elephant. To surprise, she actually got onto her back legs a few times and even just on one as she prance, twirled and spun around. She finally stopped and went over to her mother to show her the autograph. \"Oh my,\" Gem breathed out as she took her pad from her and read the trunk-writing. She quickly turned it over and showed it to Mrs. Jumbo, who also gasped at it. They stared at the two calves down below. Slowly, two adorable expressions came onto their faces as they cooes down at their children. \"Oh my. This was certainly unexpected,\" Mrs. Jumbo whispered to her. Luckily, the two calves were too busy interacting through the fence to pay attention to what was being said about them. \"Certainly indeed. But my, doesn't the thought of the both of them look so cute,\" Gem asked. Mrs. Jumbo lightly swatted her trunk, but even the action could not betray the excited look of pure joy on her face. \"Yes, it is quite adorable,\" she admitted. The two gazed down as they saw Dumbo reach out and shake Dahlia's trunk in a friendly manner. The two mothers could had melted their with the adorableness they witnessed now. Nothing could spoil this moment. Except... \"Hey, Mrs. Jumbo. Completed the task you had for me,\" Timothy said as he suddenly appeared and stood on the tip of Dumbo's trunk. Unfortunately, he did not realize two other elephants that did not know him were standing right behind his back, or did he know that they were fine with him being.. \"A mouse! Aagh!\" In an instant, the two were running away, screaming frightfully of the little brown rodent. Unfortunately for them and the trio, their screaming also awoke the other snoozing elephants, which in turn alerted the other animals, and then the circus employees. Luckily for them, Dumbo, Mrs. Jumbo and Timothy all made it out of sight before they could be seen. \"Did you hear? I heard that there was a panic at the other circus last night,\" said one elephant to another. The others gossiped together while Mrs. Jumbo sat with her son some feet away, stroking her saddened son tenderly with her trunk while she laid by his side. Timothy was in front of him, apologizing like there was no tomorrow. \"Gee Dumbo. I don't mean to scare her and her mother away. I really didn't,\" Timothy pleaded. Dumbo sniffed and rubbed his eyes. \"It wasn't your fault, Timothy. I'm just sad that Dahlia and her mother ran away before I could say goodbye. They probably never want to see us ever again after that fiasco,\" he said as he covered his face with his trunk. Mrs. Jumbo stopped stroking his back and gently pried his trunk away from his face. \"Listen here Dumbo. If Gem is anything like I remember her and Dahlia is anything like her mother, then they won't be mad at all,\" she reassured. \"Your mother is darn right she is,\" came a sudden voice from behind the group. Eyes turned in shock and then widened at the sight of the elephant with the calve beside her smiling widely at the three of them. Dumbo grinned and bounded up to greet his friend and Mrs. Jumbo and Timothy slowly made their way to the two of them. \"I thought I wasn't going to see you two again,\" Dumbo said as he hugged Dahlia's trunk. Gem nearly snorted with laughter. \"Please young one, you may think our circus is exciting all the time, but once the lights go off and the people leave, it can get quite dull around there real fast. That might was the most excitement I felt since Dahlia was born,\" she explained. Her eyes then caught sight of the humbled mouse on Mrs. Jumbo's trunk. \"Ah, yes. You must be Mr. Timothy. Q. Mouse, Dumbo's manager. I am sorry for not recognizing you earlier and for causing a ruckus, but I suggest now we restart all over again.\" She stuck her trunk out close enough to him to grab it. \"My name is Gem, it is a pleasure to meet you.\" Timothy grabbed it and gave a hearty shake. \"Please to meet your acquaintance. Sorry for starting all that fuss, I hope you aren't mad and that you forgive me,\" he said as he rung his hat in his hands. Gem gave out a small chuckle. \"Oh ho ho. Water under the bridge. It's all fine.\" She then pointed down to her daughter. \"I hope you don't mind but since you were so kind to pay us a visit, we thought we might do the same.\" \"Well it is very kind of you to do so Gem,\" Mrs. Jumbo said. \"Yeah. Dumbo sure seems happy to see you and her,\" he said as he pointed to the two. A ball leftover from the clown's act was currently being occupied in a game of catch between the two. Occasionally, when Dumbo caught it he would bop it up and send it back with his ears, making Dahlia giggles. To impress him back, she would stand on two or one leg, twirl around once or twice with it and throw it back. On one such throw, Dumbo accidentally threw it too hard and it bounced and rolled away behind her and out the tent. Dahlia raced to get it, stepping into the broad daylight of the outside. She soon found it right by a grey pillar nearly, so she ran towards to get it. \"Dahlia,\" her mother suddenly screamed and when she looked up the pillar she could see why. \"Pop! The ball exploded as the pillar suddenly lifted up and smashed the rubber sphere underneath. On closer examination, she realized the pillar was actually a leg. A leg attached to a shoulder. Then that to a head. Then the head to a face where her eyes met with a pair of angry eyes. She squealed with fright and rushed backwards to run back to her mother, but yelped in surprise when she feet a strong, powerful trunk wrap around her body and pull her up. Dumbo was about to run forward to help her, when his mother and Gem's trunk came in front to stop him. Gem sighed, then took a deep breath and approached slowly and stoically towards him. \"Terence, I did not expect you to be here,\" she said in an almost monotone voice. He grunted and made a motion for her to follow him away from here, carrying Dahlia firmly in his trunk. Gem started after him, but turned around and looked at her friends one last time.. \"Who is he, Gem,\" Mrs. Jumbo asked in a small whisper. Gem sighed. \"Terence, he's Gem's father. Let me warn you stay away from him. He's not the nicest person to be around,\" she explained. She winced when he heard her name being angrily called and she quickly walked after him and her daughter, leaving the confused trio behind. \"Who was that? Was someone there,\" a lady asked as she and the other elephants peaked out from behind the current at them. Mrs. Jumbo sighed and nodded at Timothy, who hopped out to 'talk' with them. \"Ohhh,\" Gem groaned as she dipped her trunk into the grey plaster and started applying it to her face in the mirror. Terence had given her quite the conversation about they staying away from them. And by 'conversation', she meant that now had an ugly bruise on her face, several on her cheeks and trunk and a small scratch above her left eye. But it didn't nearly hurt as much as the things he told her. \"Renounce your past ties to that circus. I don't care if you were born there, I don't care of you have a so-called 'friend' there. You will renounce your ties to her and that circus this second and you will never see either of them ever again.\" She winced as his voice echoed in her brain. True he was her husband and father of their child, but there was no way that he was the boss of the either of them. Ever since Dahlia was born, he had had no relationship whatsoever with her and left her in the care of her mother. It sickened her to think that he thought that he had any control over them, but then again he was stronger and fiercer then the both of them. The only reason she hadn't gotten out of the circus before was because of him, and with Dahlia to raise here, she had a much harder chance to escape with the both of them. One bandage and a fresh coat of grey makeup later and you could barely tell she had ever been beaten before. Now putting on a face of determination, she started to move over towards her daughter, biting down the pain as she hobbled over. Her daughter was in the small corner Terence had let her stay. It barely had any room for her, between two crates and one small dog bed for her to lay upon. A dog bed! Had he no dignity for his race? Dahlia was shedding silent tears as she held the pencil, pad and autograph from Dumbo in her trunk. Gem slowly reached out her trunk and wrapped it tenderly around her daughter. Dahlia wasn't beaten, for she was still small and frail, but she still got yelled at by her father. \"Listen dearie, don't listen to a word your father says. That old pompous windbag wouldn't know a thing about love or loyalty if it came up and smacked him in the face.\" She heard her whimper and she saw her daughter point to her hat. A large tear was in it and a feather was missing. Gem sighed and straightened the remaining feathers up and took it off and set it down on one of the crates, knowing it would be found and repaired or replaced later. \"Dahlia, you know I love you and always wants what's best for you. And what I find is best for you right now is to see Dumbo this very minute,\" she firmly said. Dahlia lifted her head up and her eyes stared so hopeful at her. Gem smiled and she quickly brushed away the tears from her face and lifted her chin up. \"That's my girl. Now here's the plan, darling...\" Dahlia softly tip-toed on two of her feet as she made her way to the fence. Barb wire and an electrical current had been added to the fence from what had 'mysteriously' happened yesterday, but Gem had always been a thorough thinker. The trapeze act had left a small trampoline out, just strong enough for her to use. She set it down before the fence and hoped that the springs wouldn't squeak too much under her weight and alert anyone. After taking a deep breath and steeling herself, she was ready to go. One jump. Need more height. Two jumps. She could see the circus in the distance. Three jumps. Just a little higher. Four jumps. Freedom! Her legs wobbled once they hit the ground again, but she soon steadied them up. Before she knew it, she was zooming towards the circus, following the spotlights in the distance. She felt breathless as she accelerated towards it. She was almost there, she felt excitement course through her veins at the thought of seeing her aunt, Timothy and, most of all, Dumbo again. Her hopes were dashed though when she felt something firm wrap around her and pull her up, stopping her in he tracks. She cringed when she heard a painstakingly familiar voice speak to her. \"Where do you think you're going, missy?\" Interesting fact though, elephants can't run or jump, but since Disney made an elephant fly then I think I have enough say to make Dahlia able to do those things. And by now I think you've found out the conflict of the story. I plan to make this short, maybe four chapters or so, but don't worry they'll still be plenty of action in-between here and the end. Thanks for checking out the new chapter, please leave a review and I'll see you next time. Sincerely, v.t.7[Chapter 3] Chapter 3: The Things I Do I hope you enjoyed the last chapter. Now let's see what's happening with Dumbo and the others. I own nothing. The movie Dumbo and all its content belongs to Disney. I don't own the cover image either. I only own my OC's, Gem, Dahlia, Terrence and Trill. Enjoy the story! \"Oh, my little darling,\" Gem cried out, even though the others just ignored her. Terence had just come by the next morning and left just as soon as he came to tell her that he had found their daughter trying to sneak off and they had captured her and she was now in solitary confinement. Really, jail for her baby! Unbelievable, child abuse even! She couldn't even see her child, for the circus was paranoid of her helping her daughter escape. The thought of her baby sitting alone in a spare caged cart, chained from all sides and her feet to the floor and walls sent tears streaming down her face. Terence appeared to be like he couldn't care less, heck, he didn't care at all. She herself was put on house arrest, but surrounded by the other elephants to make sure she wouldn't try anything. She disliked them all anyways, they were vugular, mean, pompous and rude. What she had said to Jumbo was just being polite and lying through her trunk. She currently occupied a part by the tent where she had laid down and was sobbing, refusing to be consoled. Although it wasn't like anybody else tried to comfort her. It was this night that she wished she had never been bought by this circus and had remained by her friend's side. \"But life isn't fair,\" she reminded herself. \"Things happen for a reason.\" If she hadn't been bought by the circus, she would never had had her daughter. Her gorgeous, talented, beautiful daughter, now rotting away in a dreary, grey and cold cell, probably so scared, sad and frightened now. A new set of tears came forward and fell down her face. She was too absorbed by her emotions she did not notice something brown and tan flutter down beside her until it had spoken. \"Pardon me, Gem,\" came a small, slightly squeaky female voice. Gem looked up through a veil of tears towards a sparrow perched in a crate beside her. \"Trill,\" she whispered, afraid that the others would hear her. Thankfully, the songbird caught on and lowered her voice. Gem lifted her trunk up so Trill could perch on it and quickly turned her head towards the side of the tent. \"What are you doing here,\" she asked, focusing on her friend. Trill was a sparrow that worked for the circus newspaper. She was both a journalist and photographer, so she had both a camera around her neck and a pad and pencil on hand. A leather bag with several stamps put on it was also around her neck for holding everything. A hat that said 'Press' was jauntily draped over her hat. \"Well you know how my friend works the gossip column for the newspaper, right? Well she heard rumor from the paperboy who had heard it from the janitor who had heard it from the trapeze artist who had heard it from the animal trainer who had heard it from the ringmaster,\" she inhaled deeply, \"That Dahlia is now in solitary confinement. So I came over to see if it was true.\" She took a good look at her friend's red eyes and tearstained face. \"Judging by the looks of it, I guess it is true. I'm awfully sorry Gem.\" She fluttered up and landed on a crate as Gem used her trunk to wipe her face and eyes. \"It's not your fault. It's all there's. My little daughter, my baby girl, thrown into jail because they won't let her see Dumbo at the other circus.\" \"Your daughter knows Dumbo? As in the world famous flying elephant, Dumbo,\" Trill asked surprised. Gem nodded. \"The very one. His mother is my old friend.\" \"Interesting.\" Both were silent for a minute. Gem took a good look at her friend, her eyes landing on her camera. She thought for a moment longer before an idea sparked in her head. \"Hey Trill. Could you do me a huge favor, please,\" she asked. Trill looked up and crossed her wings in front of her. \"Depends. What's the favor,\" she asked. Gem smiled and pointed to her camera around her neck. \"Oh shut up, ya yellow-bellies,\" Trill yelled as she flew over the pen where the performing circus dogs stayed. Normally she would almost always ignore this part of the circus where they kept the large animals, but after getting a request from her dear friend and an offer she could not refuse, she had reason to come into this part. She had waited till it was nightfall to start searching and she kept to it until she felt a lone train cart sitting alone a few feet away from the others. A rope pen was around it and on the side of the caged window was a sign tied to it, saying 'Warning: Bad Elephant. Keep Away.' Trill simply shook her head disdainfully at the sight of it. She landed as quietly as she could by the window and peered through the bars. The inside was dark with only a few beams of moonlight barely lighting it. She squinted through the shadows until she saw a mass of chains connected to a figure shedding silent tears on the floor. She gave a few clicks and chirps to get her attention. \"Dahlia. Hey Dahlia, darling,\" she called. The barely yearling elephant looked up and in the faint light she could see the damage done to her. Her face was just as bad as her mother's without the makeup. An ugly purple bruise marred her left cheek, the other pink obviously done by a slap. Two little scratches stuck out like dark red lines on her trunk. Worst of all, the amount of tears streaming down her face was enough to send anyone's heart melting. Her only bright, blue eyes now seemed like faded, glass marbles, blurry and grey. \"Aww sweetheart, I am so sorry dear. But I believe I have something that might make you feel better.\" She pulled out her pencil and pad from her bag, opened the pad and began reading. \"This is from your mom's own mouth, dear. Ahem, 'Tell Dahlia I have a plan to help her see Dumbo again.' Stop. 'Fly to the other circus.' Stop. 'Find him and his mother and manager.' Stop. 'Explain everything to them.' Stop. 'Ask them for help.' Stop.'\" Dahlia pointed to the floor and Trill's eyes followed. She squinted a bit, but noticed something lying in tatters on the floor. It was two pieces of paper, once one, but split right down the middle. She could see writing scrawled on it, but she could not decipher it from this distance. She put her pencil and pad away and quickly hopped through the bars and retrieved it. She organized it and held it to the moonlight to see what it said. \" 'F-From Dumbo. To my b-bi-biggest, l-l-loveliest fan, Da-Dahlia!' \" She held down the papers for a second and stared gaping at them. It was an autograph, that was for sure, but the words were so powerful and meaningful that it brought a tear to her eyes. She quickly brushed it away and turned back to Dahlia. She neatly folded the torn paper and placed it in her journal bag for safe keeping. She came closer to her and petted her trunk gently. \"Don't you worry dear. As my word as both a journalist and photographer for the press,\" she firmly straightened her hat, \"And a messenger of the truth, I vow to you that you will be reunited as soon as possible with your friend.\" With a salute, a turn and a waggle of her tail feathers, Trill was out of the cage and flying high above the circus and then the field towards the other circus up ahead. With a mission on hand and a dedication to her work, she flew swiftly over to the big top. \"Gee whiz, Dumbo. I'm sorry you didn't see your friend yesterday. I was sure she was going to show up,\" Timothy said. Dumbo said nothing, bu stared down at the floor. Timothy sighed and ate another cashew from the tin of mixed nuts he had. He had offered some to Dumbo earlier but he had said he wasn't interested. All of a sudden both heard a pair of rapidly beating wings and they turned their heads up to the sky where they saw a bird panting as she descended. Instantly, Timothy hopped up onto Dumbo's head as the sparrow landed unsteadily on a crate nearby, breathing heavily to regain her composure, In a swift movement, Timothy slid down Dumbo's trunk and onto the crate beside her. The sparrow wearily looked up, but then perked up and grinned as she saw him. \"Timothy,\" she said enthusiastically. His eyes widened in recognition. \"Trill,\" he replied and extended his hands towards her wings grasping them both firmly and giving a hard shake. \"How've ya been, girl? I haven't seen you in awhile,\" he asked. She nodded modestly. \"Very well, thank you. I'm a journalist and photographer now and I'm quite enjoying it.\" She then paused, shook her head and then her expression and tone grew firm. \"But enough of me blathering on and on about myself. I come bearing a grave message from the other circus.\" Both pairs of eyes widened in shock. Timothy grasped her by her shoulders and shook her. \"Well don't just stand there, girl. Tell us, tell him. He's been anxious to hear what has happened over their all yesterday and today.\" \"Alright, alright. That's what I'm hear for,\" she said as she removed herself from her friend's grasp and took out her pad and pencil and unfolded the pieces of paper from her satchel. Both eyes stared surprise as they recognized the pieces of paper. \"Ahem. As of yesterday night, Gem has been placed on house arrest for aiding her daughter in trying to ler her to see you.\" She paused and swallowed nervously before continuing. \"And since her daughter had been caught trying to sneak away against both the rules and curfew, she has been placed in caged confinement until the next show or until the circus moves.\" \"Caged in,\" both males shrieked, sending Trill hopping back and losing a few feathers in the process. Dumbo looked about ready to cry and so did Timothy. \"Oh, poor little girl. Taken away from the only person that cared about her, just like you, Dumbo. Except now the roles have been reversed, she has been shackled and locked up, separated from her mother and the warmth and security that came with hee. That's just too sad.\" Dumbo sniffed and a pair of tears dripped down fro his eyes. Trill put on a solemn expression as well. \"Yes, but considering how much influence Dahlia's father has over the circus, it seems like almost everything that relates with the elephants falls under his will.\" She shook her head despairingly. \"He a menace to both the circus itself and his family.\" Then, as if struck by lightning, Timothy suddenly perked up, The expression on his face was akin to one in cartoons where a lightbulb appeared over the person's head once they got a grand idea. \"Hey, wait a minute. I just had an idea that's just crazy enough to might work,\" he suddenly said. Instantly, both pairs of eyes were on him. He had their full attention now. \"Are you sure this is going to work,\" Trill asked as she perched on Dumbo's head. The two watched from afar as Timothy scurried into the part of the circus tent where they could hear loud snoring from the sleeping man. \"It worked before, I just sure hope now it doesn't backfire,\" Dumbo said, crossing his trunk a few times for good luck. \"I sure hope so.\" If you've seen the movie lately, you can probably guess what's Timothy attempting to do again. What he's going to say to the ringmaster now will all revealed in the next and final chapter. Please leave a review and stay tuned or the final, concluding chapter of my story. Sincerely, v.t.7[Chapter 4] Chapter 4: To Show I Love You And now the finale. Thanks for reading you guys, but now this tale of romance and drama must come to an end. I own nothing. The movie Dumbo and all its content belongs to Disney. I don't own the cover image either. I only own my OC's, Gem, Dahlia, Terrence and Trill. Enjoy the story! \"Ladies and gentlemen! Children of all ages! It is with our most greatest pride and deepest pleasure that we welcome you tonight and present to you the joined acts of the elephants from both our circus and the Jacksonville circus. Now without further ado, I present our very own Dumbo, the world famous flying elephant and Dahlia, the world's most darling elephant,\" the ringmaster announced. The crowd alternated between looking at the top of and the ground of the Big Top between the two elephants. Dumbo was flying up above, dressed in a uniform of an aviator jacket, scarf and cap with flying goggles. He tried to keep attention as he rolled and flipped midair through several hoops and other obstacles, but his eyes kept drawing down to the dancing elephant ballerina beneath him. Dahlia was dressed in her signature pink tutu, repaired from the earlier fiasco, a small silver tiara and she was dancing and whirling on her hind legs while bouncing around a ball with her trunk. In the background by the stage entrance was Mrs. Jumbo with a hidden Timothy and Trill and the other elephants. On the opposite end of the curtain was Gem and Terence, peaking out as well to watch the show. Mrs. Jumbo, Timothy, Trill and Gem were all watching excitedly for them while Terence had his brows furrowed and his face contorted in disgust. Dahlia twirled on one leg as she stood on one of the square platforms that had been provided for her for her act. The striped ball was balanced on her trunk as she threw it up a few ties, finally throwing it high enough to be caught by her partner in the act. Dumbo dove down and flapped up just before he hit the ground, catching the ball as well. The audience clapped their approval. The game of toss continued for a few more minutes, until Dahlia caught the ball and set it on the platform below her. She then slowly started to move onto the ball, first placing her first front two feet onto it before slowly sliding her back feet onto it until she was standing on the ball. The crowd cheered in happiness. Dahlia smiled, though sweat started pouring down her face. She hadn't practiced this trick much and this was the first time she had actually performed it onstage. The audience suddenly gasped in shock as her legs started to give way and her balance on the ball started to slide. Dumbo looked down at where the audience was gasping at and then realized the danger she was in. Aside from being on a five foot-tall platform above the ground, there was also a pool of water surrounding her. If she lost her balance and fell off the ball and platform, she would fall in and not only injure herself from the height and the surface of the water smacking her, but she would also humiliate herself and receive more verbal, perhaps even physical abuse from her circus and father. Without even thinking, he began to descend again, but this time it wasn't to catch the bouncy sphere. Dahlia's wobbling became more and more unstable and a two of her legs actually came out from underneath her to steady herself. Finally, as it seemed like it couldn't get any worse, the ball suddenly popped underneath her, sending her down on the platform again, but right next to the edge where gravity took hold and she began going down headfirst to the ground. The crowd gasped in horror as the young calf started to descend. Dahlia shut her eyes tightly as the pool of water beneath her started growing closer and closer. She knew even if she escaped injury she would receive it elsewhere. Her father had been pushing her ever since she was born to perform and she had only practiced the trick twice before now. Her mother would forgive her, be there to comfort her even after all this, but when he father came... she shut her eyes tighter as he water came right below her. Her sky-blue eyes opened again in shock when she realized something was grasping her trunk and pulling her up. Past glare of the spotlight shone them, she could see the silhouette of an elephant with large ears flapping with his trunk wound tightly around hers. She smiled in excitement when she realized Dumbo had caught her and was pulling her up. The audience came to their feet and cheered and widely applauded as Dumbo set Dahlia back onto the platform and landed closely by her side. The two then stood up proudly before the crowd and, with their trunks still holding each other's, took a bow. The crowd cheered, some people aweing in cuteness. Gem, Mrs Jumbo and the others cheered as well, the two mothers even shedding tears of joy for their two children. Yet in the shadow of the curtain, one narrowed his eyes in rage. The two calves ran off stage after their act was done, practically skipping in excitement of what had happened out there. Their eyes caught sight of their parents in the back and they headed towards them. Dahlia suddenly shrieked in surprise and pain when she felt something reach out and constrict around her middle before lifting her up. A squeal quickly died in her throat as she suddenly saw the angry, red eyes of her seething father. She heard another scream of surprise and her mother and Dumbo's mother came into view. Suddenly, she felt something lightly hit her head and before it fell off, she caught it and stared at what it was. A peanut. She then felt her father's grip faltered and she wriggled out of his trunk as he yelped in surprise as she ran between her mother's legs. Dumbo sucked up in his trunk the peanuts from a nearby abandoned concession stand and began pelting the older elephant to free Dahlia. In an instant, some men started running in, some with ropes which they threw over his huge, bucking form towards some other men. Dumbo flew down and ran in-between his mother's legs like Dahlia and shut his eyes tightly to avoid watching the scene unfold. Gem and Mrs. Jumbo shut their eyes too and covered their ears over their faces for extra safety, Gem for fear and Mrs. Jumbo for her own experiences getting roped. Terence's trumpets filled the whole big top and behind the curtain some of the audience could be heard talking and gasping in surprise. Both ringmasters came in, both angry that the show was being interrupted and then fearful as they saw the big, bull elephant throwing a tantrum rivaled to Mrs. Jumbo's when she did so to defend her child. Soon the entire staff of workers came in, throwing more ropes and clasping on chains to his legs to get him away. Gem and Mrs. Jumbo had had enough and they quickly picked up their children and moved away from the scene unfolding. The next day after the next day, the Casey Jr. train had left the station for the next town, leaving behind the city and the other circus. In the back cart, the deluxe one made for the circus's star attraction, Timothy was sitting on a table with Trill and a bag of peanuts. They were both looking down and reading a newspaper, freshly printed that very morning. BULL ELEPHANT GONE RAMPANT. Terence, sire of the C.K. Circus's star attraction elephant, Dahlia, had gone into a full-blown tantrum the night both circus's had agreed to collaborate on a show that would feature both star elephants. C.K. Circus manager says he had no idea why the elephant would go rampant, but has agreed to sell to the Casey Jones circus both the calf and her mother to avoid further abuse to both elephants. \"Huh, would you look at that. Guess there really are happy endings in the circus,\" Timothy commented as he split open a peanut shell and handed one of the nuts to Trill. \"Would seem so. Of course, this probably would have ended a lot smoother and quicker if you had given the idea to let the ringmaster buy Dahlia and Gem before all this happen, provided I also gave proof that the circus had them both in hostile environments,\" the sparrow replied as she popped the peanut into her beak and began chewing on it. \"Yeah, probably.\" A grin then made its way onto his face. \"But you have to admit, this story really makes our circus and Dumbo look like real heroes. And hey, as long as they're very happy.\" He pointed his finger above them to the pair of elephants flying above them. Well it was more like Dumbo flying with Dahlia riding onto him, but Timothy was right; they were both very happy. Dahlia had a large smile on her face as she held on tightly to Dumbo as he flapped his ears. Dumbo also had a grin on his face, one that threaten to split it if it got any bigger. His ears might be holding them up, but right now he felt like his heart was light than air, and Dahlia's felt the same way too. Mrs. Jumbo and Gem made their way one by one out onto the back of the caboose and turned up to see their children. Their trunks waved up towards them, quickly receiving the same reaction. The sun was beginning to set behind the horizon, tinting the sky in a variety of vibrant and beautiful colors. As the sunset illuminated the world above, the train kept steadily chugging towards the sun and above it were the two, happiest elephants in the world. If you don't mind, I'd like you to check out the chapter titles altogether to see a hidden message about Dumbo's feelings for Dahlia. I'm sorry if the ending felt a bit rushed, but I was trying to keep it remotely close with the elements of the first movie's ending. I tried to keep it simple and besides, I don't think if this was really a film that Disney would allow much of Terence's rampaging scene, as they didn't show the end of Mrs. Jumbo's in the first, just the beginning, part of the middle and then the aftermath. I hope you enjoyed reading my story, thank you all for coming in to check it out and for sticking with me till the end. Please leave a review with some feedback on how I did and please feel free to check out some of my other stories. And have a Happy Easter!

Her first friends she befriended were the elephants, mostly the kind-hearted and motherly Mrs. Harriet Jumbo and her new baby son Dumbo. At first, the whole circus and the lady elephants picked on Dumbo, because he was born with big ears. Shortly after arriving in Georgia, Mrs. Jumbo went wild when a group of bullies started to pick on her son and tried to protect him, with Sandy getting injured from a worker and the mother elephant getting locked up in solitary confinement. Sandy decided to step in for Mrs. Jumbo and care for Dumbo, until she was free. The lady elephants and the circus workers, even her uncle were all cruel towards the baby elephant, even to the girl and spread rumors of her performing sorcery and witchcraft in her tent, due to her Wiccan heritage which gave her the ability to speak to animals. Her relationship with the Ringmaster was rocky as he did not listen to her honest words, and later on they got along well. Along the way, she and Dumbo befriend a mouse named Timothy, who stood up for Dumbo and Sandy by scaring the lady elephants for insulting them. The three of them made a plan to help Dumbo become a star in the circus and set his mother free. After facing many trials of bullying and humiliation, the three discover that Dumbo's big ears make him fly, and his performance made him a star in the circus, with Sandy conquering her fear of heights as she swung from the trapeze bars blindfolded and did not fall. While she's still an acrobat, she became Dumbo's personal trainer, and earn the respect from the other workers and animals from the circus, even kicking the clowns out. Dumbo became a star attraction and his mother was finally free and once more reunited, they never thought they could be so happy. Sandy now found a future as her career grew, and she taught the circus workers on how to act around animals better and on her Wiccan heritage. She made new friends that grew to love, adore, and respect her, even along with the Ringmaster and her two brothers, James and Robert. The circus was heading towards their next destination to the greatest city in all of the United States of America, New York City. Little did she know that there would be another event that would change her life again soon.[Chapter 2] Hi ya'll sorry this chapter took so long to write, I had to come up with ideas on how to plan it out, but I had written other chapters and create other characters and see how they'll play out with the sequel. I want to thank slydog148 for the support and lending me a hand. Enjoy the story and review! \"Hello, Sandy.\" \"Good day, Ben.\" \"Good day Ms. Williams.\" \"Hello, Joe.\" Sandra walked alongside the hallways of the train and every circus worker, performer, and clown greeted her kindly. She had never felt this content before in her life. Everyone was accepting her more than they did a year ago. She looked out to watch the rolling lush grass of valleys of the South zoom by and the sun shone in the clear blue sky. The rivers flowed through the ravines, making the scene extraordinary. She sighed in content and got mesmerized as Casey Jr. blew the whistle, making her smile. She looked up to see Dumbo flying in the air, with Timothy Q. Mouse riding in his hat, making her grin more to see her friends happy. \"Hi Sandy,\" a young voice said. Sandy looked over to see two girls walking briskly towards her. One petite girl had short brown hair that reached her shoulders, hazel eyes, with a light blue shirt, and the vest and skirt were dark blue with brown flats and a light blue headband. The second, a tall African American girl with her black hair tied up in a high ponytail with a red ribbon, a white shirt, and a red dress gave a smile with her dark red lips. \"Hi Paige, hi Rosie,\" she said pushing a blonde curl behind her shoulder. The girls have been hired two to four months after Dumbo became famous, and were at first reluctant to be around her, but grew to appreciate and accept her for her Wiccan heritage. The three developed a very strong friendship as time went on. \"Are you staring out at the view?\" Paige asked. \"Oh yeah, I thought I'd look at the view to give me some peace and relaxation. I also saw Dumbo flying in the air with Timothy.\" \"Of course,\" the brunette nodded. Paige was very shy, and was born the only daughter of two performers, Joshua and Esther Larkin; they were both fortunetellers and magicians. They were picked up from Maryland and became members of the circus. They were once traveling performers and both wanted to seek a better life for themselves and their daughter. Paige managed to find the courage to speak up and make friends with Sandy. When she met Timothy at first, she screamed in terror due to her fear of mice and began to avoid him. After a few months passed, Paige learned to be friends with Timothy and conquered her fear. Rosie, however, was outspoken and feisty, preferring to stick to her opinions. Despite being born African American, Sandy and Paige treated her as an equal. She grew up in Montana after her father's death and supported her mother, Margo and her two younger sisters, Daisy and Lavender by working on farms caring for the horses. Rosie loved horses and eventually learned to ride them, and grew a passion to perform with them. When the circus came to her town, the Ringmaster spotted Rosie with her horses and asked her if she could do a trick. She gladly agreed and performed. When she met Sandy, she stood guarded due to being discrimination that went through the United States. Then, she grew to be friends with Sandy and joined her with her horses. \"Are you excited to go to New York City?\" Rosie asked. \"Oh yes, it's been many years since I've been there the last time. It was when Poppa and Momma took me, James, and Robert as kids.\" \"Come to think of it, I've always wanted to see New York,\" the brunette added. \"I heard that the Empire State Building is one of the greatest buildings in the world.\" \"Yep,\" the dark haired girl added. \"I bet this will be the trip of a lifetime!\" \"Yeah, even the perfect opportunity to visit. Even Dumbo and his mother will be excited too. What do you say we pay them a little visit when we come to Oklahoma? Uncle Harold told me that we'll be having a little performance and there's a family planning to audition and some wanting to work. I would like to meet them myself.\" The girls agreed and continued their walk around greeting more of the performers and workers. They enjoyed every moment of everyone being very content. Sandy smiled to herself in her daydreams, \"If this is my lucky day, how can my life get any better?\"[Chapter 3] After a few hours, the train came to a stop in St. Louis, Missouri; and the performers, clowns, animals, and workers soon got to work. All of the men and workers greeted Sandy and her friends. The roustabouts were setting up tents to create the big top and resting quarters for everyone. Sandy, Paige, and Rosie entered Sandy's private car, where she had set up worktable for her herbs, incense, spices, and plants for when she performed her spells and rituals to connect with the Goddess and animals. She decided to teach her human friends more on Wicca, and they decided they wanted to learn to communicate with animals. Sandy communicated with the Goddess through a ritual, and the Goddess agreed, on the condition to only use it with close friends and family. Paige and Rosie sat on the floor and watched Sandy preparing a spell for them. \"Are you sure this will work, Sandy?\" Rosie asked with a raised brow. \"Didn't you tell us before you used some other method to let you talk to animals?\" \"And what if we're still not able to understand them if your potion fails?\" added Paige \"Trust me, girls, once I'm finished fixing up this potion, you'll be able to understand animals as well as I can,\" Sandy replied. \"I'm only using this method because you two aren't Wiccans like me.\" The blonde reached for some ginger, peppermint, garlic, lavender, and a mix of birch leaves to crush them in a mixture. She poured it in warm water and mixed with witch hazel to make it suitable to taste. She poured the potion in each cup and placed them on a tray. Sandra turned back to them and gave them a warm smile before taking their hands and holding them in her own. \"It will be okay. You're both going to feel so much closer to Dumbo and the other animals than ever before.\" She got back to her feet and retrieved the tray. She got down to her knees, placing down the tray and handed each cup to the girls. Paige and Rosie took their cups and watched Sandy moving her hands in the air, performing her ritual. When they first discovered Sandy was a Wiccan and performed rituals, they were skeptical until they got a dose of her potion. Paige and Rosie sipped the mixture and listened to Sandy speaking out in a commanding voice and took their hands each and held each other. \"Mother of Wiccans, I hereby grant the power of speech to animals upon my friends. Allow them to understand all life around them, as I have. May the animals have the ability to communicate with them, and will they.\" She dipped her fingers in a mixture of olive oil and balm. She slipped it gently on each of their foreheads. Rosie exhaled, feeling the balm on her flesh gently moving across. Paige shuddered at the cold mixture touching her skin. They felt their blood warming and a nature aura surrounded them, allowing them to become more aware of the natural world around them. They smiled, feeling the potion running in their veins and nodded. The girls continued their ritual and the natural sunlight shone down on them from the window. The girls mediated for a moment and hummed to allow them to be taken in the world of Wicca. Paige and Rosie opened their eyes and stood up watching Sandy. \"Did it work?\" Paige inquired. \"Only one way to find out,\" commented Rosie, \"let's visit the animals,\" Rosie added. \"Okay then, let's go,\" said Sandy. The girls exited from Sandy's private car and made their way over to the menagerie tent where all the animals were housed. They entered the area and to see the many animals the circus owned. There were zebras, giraffes, bears, ostriches, horses, tigers, lions, hippos, and especially elephants, all gathered around to see Dumbo play with their children. Needless to say, the young pachyderm had been all too happy that he was no longer the laughingstock of the circus and was accepted by his community. Mrs. Jumbo smiled down at her son and caressed him tenderly. Then she looked up and noticed Sandy and her friends entering the tent, making her smile even more. \"Oh look, everyone! Sandy and her friends have arrived!\" Harriet announced. The other animals looked back; glad to see the Wiccan they had become so well acquainted with entering the tent. Ever since Dumbo became the star of the circus and Sandy was deemed his personal trainer, they were all unsure of what to make of a human who could speak their language, but they came to accept her as a member of their community They smiled and politely greeted her, not noticing the astonished expressions on the faces of her two human friends. \"Hello Mother,\" she said. Sandy had come to call Harriet 'Mother' because she was a mother figure towards the girl the first day they met. The Wiccan had lost her birth mother to a poacher when she only a child but had grown to see Harriet as a loving substitute since joining the circus. In kind, Mrs. Jumbo adored Sandy as if she was her own daughter and accepted her into her family for protecting her son when she was imprisoned. The kind mother elephant pulled the girl into an embrace within her trunk. \"How are you today? Did you enjoy the ride here to Missouri?\" \"I did, thanks for asking. And there's something I'd like to share with you about Paige and Rosie.\" \"Oh really?\" Asked Harriet as she looked towards the two other humans. \"What is it you have to say about them?\" The two girls were still gaping as they turned their attention to the mother of their circus's star. After a short pause, Rosie was able to mutter, \"Oh my goodness, the potion does let us talk to animals.\" Harriet and all the other animals observing this exchange donned a look of surprise. \"They can...understand us as well?\" Harriet inquired in befuddlement. \"Since when?\" \"Since I made a potion for them that let's them understand the animal language as well as I do,\" Sandy replied with a smile. \"They said they were interested in how I'm able to talk to you all and I decided to share that gift with them.\" \"Hello Mrs. Jumbo,\" said Paige shyly as she held out one of her hands. \"Hi Harriet, hi Timothy,\" added Rosie as she noticed a familiar rodent scurry over towards them. \"Hello dears,\" Harriet said, smiling to the girl's human friends. \"Hiya Paige, hiya Rosie,\" Timothy said. Paige stepped back, remembering the time she met the mouse, she took a deep breath, held her hand out to him and allowed Timothy to step onto her hand. \"Hello Timothy,\" she said. The tent was filled with warm and happy greetings of the Wiccan, her friends, and the animals. A year ago, the circus animals lived separately among themselves and never bothered to interact with anyone outside their own species. However, following Dumbo's rise to fame and discovering Sandy's ability to speak to them, they grew curious about her gift and eventually the sense of community among the circus' animals grew stronger and led to them forming close friendships with each other As for Dumbo, his newly-achieved stardom had earned him friends among the children of his community, including his next-door neighbors. Sandy looked over with a smile to see the calf surrounded by his new friends. There was Godfry the hippo calf, a zebra foal named Dot, a kangaroo Joey named Alice, twin bear cubs Claude and Lolly; five tiger cubs, consisting of the boys, Talish, Tamila, and Taksheel, and the girls, Talika and Tamanna; and the monkey siblings known as Joan, Camille, Peter, and Donnie. They were all interested in learning more about Dumbo and his ability to fly. \"So Dumbo, how does it feel to fly?\" Godfry the hippo asked. \"Is it good?\" \"It's great! I can't tell you how amazing it felt when I first soared in the air,\" Dumbo replied. \"Why? How can you fly?\" Dot asked. \"Because it makes me happy about myself. Sandy always told me that no matter how different I look, I ought to be myself and hold my head up high.\" \"Okay,\" the zebra foal replied. Dot had a tendency to repeat 'why' many times, and no matter how hard someone tried to explain what, when, or who they really meant, she kept repeating until she finally understood. \"It must be amazin' to be able to fly, mate,\" Alice said with a grin. \"A shame I can't do that, but at least I can do the next best thing!\" The joey crouched down and jumped up as high as she could, then started hopping around the play area giggling to herself. Unfortunately, she failed to notice a pile of hay and some barrels in front of her as she hopped. \"Alice, look out!\" called Dumbo. Alice gasped as she landed in the haystack and knocked over the barrels, making everyone gasp in worry for the Joey. \"Oh boy,\" Talish said. \"Danger Prone Alice did it again,\" snarked Penny. \"Penny!\" her mother scolded. \"You know it's not nice to ridicule someone when they have an accident.\" Darwin and Sydney hopped over to the pile of hair where their daughter landed. They helped her out and gave a sigh of relief, and got her to stand up. \"Are you all right honey?\" Darwin asked. \"Yes Papa, I'm okay.\" \"You need to be more careful where you're jumping,\" Sydney added. \"Yes, Mama.\" As the kangaroo parents tended to their child, an eager grin formed on Dumbo's face as he saw his trainer and sister-figure and her friends approach where he and his friends were playing. \"Hi, Sandy! Hi Paige! Hi Rosie!\" he greeted and trotted over to the girls. \"Hello Dumbo,\" the blonde said. The girls greeted him and sat on a hay bale. The animal children came up to the humans, all eager to speak with the Wiccan who could speak their language. Paige hid behind Rosie, and the woman stood her ground. \"It feels weird that I can hear them, talking,\" Rosie said. \"Don't worry Rosie,\" the blonde said. \"You'll get use to it.\" \"Hello children,\" Sandra said. \"How are all of you today?\" \"Good Sandy, good,\" they said. \"I'm ok, Sandy,\" Dumbo said, climbing up to the girl's lap. \"I'm really excited that our summer tour has started! I can't wait to see all the places we're gonna be performing in!\" Sandy nodded in agreement and saw a giraffe calf walking up to Paige. Making the brunette back away nervously. The giraffe calf, known as Louise, was confused at the human's behavior. \" 'Cuse me, miss,\" Louise said. \"How come you're backing away from me?\" Paige placed her hand to her forehead and nearly stumbled before Rosie caught her and helped her sit on a bale of hay. \"I feel faint,\" she mumbled and put a hand on her head. \"Take it easy, Paige,\" Rosie said, fanning her hand to give her friend some air. \"I can't believe that we can hear them speak.\" Esther backed away, feeling nervous about the petite brunette almost fainting from understanding her. Sandy sighed, hoping that her human friends will get used to their new power. She noticed Godfry sitting in a tub large enough for him to bathe in. \"Oh, Godfry? Do you want me to grab your bath products for you since you're already in the tub?\" \"Oh no, Sandy,\" the hippo calf insisted. \"I can do it. I can do things myself, honest.\" \"Okay Godfry, if you insist.\" Godfry hopped out of the tub and headed over to the car where he and his mother stayed in. The girl sighed placing her hands on her hips. Godfry was known for being stubborn when people offered to help him, always turning them down and insisting that he could do it himself. As he fetched his bath products, he didn't notice Claude and Lolly rolling towards him as they playfully wrestled. They crashed into, Godfry making him yelp and fall into a nearby mud puddle. \"Claude! Lolly! What's the matter with you?\" he glared at the two cubs. \"Wasn't our fault!\" Claude protested. \"Sorry Godfry, it was an accident,\" Lolly added. \"We didn't mean to get you all dirty.\" \"Thanks to you, I have to take another bath again.\" \"Now Godfry,\" his mother, Louise came up. \"There's no need to be harsh. After all, it was an accident.\" Godfry took a deep breath and listened to his mother's advice. \"Yes, Mom.\" He turned to the cubs. \"Sorry about that.\" After Godfry finished cleaning up, the girls decided to play with the children. Dot and Alice playfully chased after Paige, still shy and not entirely used to understanding animals. They laughed as they pursued the petite woman and made her jump into a hay bale to hide in. Rosie got to her knees as Louise the giraffe calf and Claude and Lolly came up to her, and reached in to lick her face. The dark-haired woman giggled, and the cubs tackled her and rolled on the ground. Sandy looked over to see the brunette hiding behind a pile of hay, and she came up to her. \"It's okay Paige,\" she said, smiling. \"I promise, they won't harm you. They just want to get the chance to know you.\" The blonde guided the petite's hand over towards the muzzle of the zebra foal. Paige slowly flinched from the touch, but she took a deep breath and allowed herself to pet Dot. The foal licked the palm, and made Paige giggle. Alice rubbed her head against the brunette's leg, the brunette landed on her knees and started to play with them. Dot licked her face, and Alice snuggled on her lap. Louise kept her distance away, and almost took a few steps closer, wanting to get used to her surroundings. Smiling as she saw how well things were going between her human and animal friends, Sandy then turned her attention to a corner of the tent to see the only animal child in the tent not interacting with her peers. This animal was Penny, a young ostrich wearing a pink bow on top of her head and a resentful frown on her beak as she had her back turned from the activities. Unlike the rest of the circus animals, who were fascinated by Dumbo's ability to fly, Penny was nothing short of envious and bitter of how Dumbo could achieve what she felt only birds could do while she had to live her life in flightlessness. \"Oh Penny,\" Sandy asked as she approached the ostrich chick, \"aren't you going to go and play with the others?\" \"...Life's not fair, Sandy,\" she grumbled out loud. This made the girl's smile falter and her brows furrow in concern. \"It's not fair that Dumbo gets to experience the greatest gift a bird can have while I'm stuck on the ground. If my mom says that ostriches aren't meant to fly, why do we even have feathers and wings?\" \"Oh Penny,\" Sandy said, coming up to kneel beside her. \"Sometimes we are all different, and it makes us special. There's no shame in having the inability to fly.\" \"Sandy's right dear,\" her mother, Miranda added. \"Sometimes we have to accept ourselves for who we are and how the world made us.\" \"How can we be the same?\" Penny asked. \"We're all different.\" \"We may be, Penny,\" Sandy said. \"But deep in our hearts and souls, we're so much alike. That's what the Goddess taught me, all because, we are one and never let go of others.\" Sandy looked around and reflected of how friendship, family, and love truly means to her. She looked around and began to sing. \" Don't lose your way With each passing day You've come so far Don't throw it away Live believing Dreams are for weaving Wonders are waiting to start Live your story Faith, hope and glory Hold to the truth in your heart If we hold on together I know our dreams will never die Dreams see us through to forever Where clouds roll by For you and I\" Souls in the wind Must learn how to bend Seek out a star Hold on to the end Valley, mountain There is a fountain Washes our tears all away Words are swaying Somebody is praying Please let us come home to stay If we hold on together I know our dreams will never die Dreams see us through to forever Where clouds roll by For you and I When we are out there in the dark We'll dream about the sun In the dark we'll feel the light Warm our hearts, everyone If we hold on together I know our dreams will never die Dreams see us through to forever As high as souls can fly The clouds roll by For you and I.\" The animals all fell for Sandy's soothing voice and Dumbo curled up in her lap more. Paige and Rosie smiled and were feeling better with Sandy's presence. Penny gave a sigh, and though she preferred not to show her soft side, she decided to take Sandy's advice. Hello again, oh boy was this chapter long. It took me a while to add some characters and give them more development to their personality and flaws. Yep, I finally introduced Dumbo's animal friends from the original sequel; Dot the zebra, Godfry the Hippo, Claude and Lolly the Twin bear cubs, and Penny the Ostrich. slydog148 has been giving me good advice and helping me create the names of the animal characters of the kangaroos, the tiger cubs, and the giraffes. More will be developed soon, even some songs. Song, \"If We Hold Together\" is owned by Don Bluth and Diana Ross.[Chapter 4] During the day, Sandy, Paige, and Rosie continued to walk and encountered the area where the roustabouts were taking their break from setting up the tents. Timothy sat on Sandy's shoulder and Dumbo followed her and the girls. Many of the workers greeted Sandy and her friends. One African American man in his twenties, wearing a white shirt, a green scarf, brown suspenders, and brown shoes looked up and tipped his beret to her and her friends. \"Good day, Ms. Williams, Ms. Larkin, and Ms. Griffin,\" he said. \"Hello Roy,\" the blonde said, and her friends greeted him. Roy Dawson was hired three months ago and Sandy treated him as an equal along with Rosie. Though he was hardworking, he dreamed about helping more around animals, including training horses. Dumbo came up to him to sniff him. \"So Roy, how do you like the summer tour so far?\" Paige asked. \"It's fine Ms. Larkin,\" the dark-haired man said, stroking Dumbo's head. \"I sure love to visit NYC, always wanted to see Grand Central Park and the Empire State Building. It would be like seeing the top of the world.\" Roy looked up to Rosie, and noticed how beautiful she was, and gave a shy smile. Rosie noticed him looking at him, and returned a shy smile. \"How are you Roy?\" the woman asked. Roy completely blushed, not knowing what to say to her. \"Uh… well…. Fine, Rosie… just fine.\" \"I see,\" she giggled and smirked. Sandy and Paige could sense the two of them having feelings for each other, but Rosie always insisted she and Roy were only friends. They bid goodbye to Roy and they walked away to continue their exploration, with Dumbo catching up to them. \"Boy Rosie,\" Timothy said. \"It looked like Roy was looking at you differently unlike he has with the other goyles.\" \"Oh Timothy,\" Rosie said, blushing taking Timothy into her hands. \"There's nothing between me and Roy, ever since we met, we were only friends.\" \"Okay,\" Timothy added along with a smirk. \"Hey Sis! Hey Paige and Rosie!\" a voice called back. The girls turned back to see James and Robert catching up to them. Sandy smiled to see her brothers and they pull her into a hug. Sandy noticed Robert looking over at Paige and gave her a smile. Paige flinched back and hid behind Rosie. The brunette blushed fiercely as the boy's attention was turned to her. \"Oh Paige,\" Rosie said. \"Do you have a crush on Robert?\" \"Well….\" The brunette stammered. \"Probably.\" \"Probably?\" the dark-haired woman asked skeptically with a smirk. Dumbo came up to the girls and pulled on Paige's skirt. The brunette knelt down and stroked Dumbo's head, giving a warm smile to the calf. Then a hand covered her own. Paige looked up to see the blonde boy kneeling to her and gave a smile. She flinch back in surprise and her cheeks heated up with a red touch. Sandy, Rosie, and James giggled at the moment, while Robert gave them a glare. \"So boys,\" said Rosie. \"What's up?\" \"We came here, because Uncle Harold has a big announcement to make, and we wanted to let you know, so we can all hear it together,\" James said. \"I see,\" said Paige. \"I wonder who'll join the circus this year?\" asked Sandy. \"Will they be nice people?\" asked Dumbo. \"I'm sure they will be bud,\" Timothy said. \"Well, the announcement's in ten minutes, I think we'll be early in five minutes,\" Robert added. \"Well then, let's roll,\" said Rosie. The group headed over towards the center of the circus, and joined along with Roy, the janitor Joe and clown, Ben. The circus continued to grow since Dumbo's fame and hired more performers, animals, clowns, and workers. They looked up to see the Ringmaster standing up on the podium, and the circus performers, clowns, and employees gathered around to listen. In the crowd, were two adults dressed as fortune tellers, they happened to be Paige's parents, Joshua and Esther. Joshua was tall with fair skin, auburn hair with a mustache and beard, and blue eyes, and wore a white headdress on his head. He was dressed a green blouse, a brown belt, dark brown pants, black boots, a black coat with a blue gem. Paige's mother, Esther was a splitting image of her daughter. She wore a strapless purple dress with blue trimming, and a white blouse, an orange cape, golden jewelry of earrings, bracelets, rings, and golden headband with sapphires and rubies. The animals stood by to listen to the announcement, and kept their distant away so they wouldn't be chased off. Standing near the Ringmaster was an unfamiliar woman with her brunette hair styled in a low bun, tan skin, green eyes, and red lips. She wore an orange blouse, a dark-pale green skirt, and matching boots. She had her hands in front of her folded. \"Everyone, thank you for gathering here. For I have some new announcements to make. We have new members joining our circus,\" He pulled the woman up to the podium. \"First, I want you to meet Martha Baker, she's our new nurse.\" Martha gave a nod and a shy smile. \"Thank you Mr. Williams,\" she said. \"I'm very glad to be a part of the business and keep everything in order.\" \"Now for the next announcement,\" continued the Ringmaster. \"There's the Lakotos family. The parents, Ambrus and Elsa are from Budapest, Hungary. Their four children: Viktor, Josephine, Hans, and Anyu are part of a knife-throwing act, they've been performing it since Vaudeville. I've seen their part, and I believe that it's looks so extraordinary.\" Two adults, one man and a woman, assumed to be the parents of the siblings climbed up to the podium. Elsa wore a dark blue dress with her auburn hair curled up, and her husband, Ambrus was tall with dark hair, tan skin, and hazel eyes. He was dressed in a green shirt, a brown vest, dark pants, and brown shoes. He smiled and took his wife's hand. \"Thank you very much Mr. Williams,\" Ambrus said, his Hungarian accent was thick, but had perfected his English along with his wife. He turned to the crowd. \"Elsa and I are very happy to be apart of this business, this knife-throwing has been passed down in our family for many generations. I like to have our children be introduced when the show starts, and you'll see how well they do.\" \"Igen,\" Elsa agreed. \"They prefer to make an introduction on their act, and after that, they'll greet the performers and everyone. They will be willing to meet all of you.\" \"Thank you, Mr. and Mrs. Lakatos,\" said Harold. He turned back to the crowd. \"Our show will start in a few hours, so we all must get ready.\" Sandy looked at her friends and brothers, and they all smiled in interest. Dumbo and Timothy grinned, and indeed were very interested in the act of the Lakatos siblings. The crowd went their ways and headed back to their chores and get ready for training. Dumbo however, didn't quite understand how a family throwing knives would make a show spectacular. Timothy slid down his trunk and landed near his foot. \"Boy, the Lakatos family must be somethin'.\" Dumbo looked at the mouse, confused. \"What do you mean by 'something' Timothy? \"He means they must be spectacular at what they do if Uncle Harold thinks they're worth performing here at the circus. Sort of like you, Dumbo,\" Sandy said smiling. \"Like me?\" \"Of course, sweetie,\" said Mrs. Jumbo, smiling. \"Ever since you discovered you can fly, you haven't just been another attraction for people to marvel at; you've become someone people are inspired by. By using what's made you distinctive to help you make yourself special to others, you've inspired others to use what makes them different to help them define themselves in the world. The Lakatos family seems to want to do just that by joining the circus to show their knife-throwing talents.\" \"After all, everyone is special in their own way,\" said James. \"Speaking of special, it's time for all of us to ready,\" added Rosie. The group agreed and went their separate ways, feeling more excited than ever in their lives.[Chapter 5] Later in the evening, lights were glowing in the sky as many visitors entered the big top to watch the acts. The stars glittered like diamonds in the dark sky and the place was beamed with excitement. All the performers, clowns, and animals were getting ready for their acts. Inside one of the private train cars of the star attractions, Sandy and her friends were getting ready at their vanity tables, applying on makeup and jewelry, and pulling on their costumes. The blonde sat at her vanity and was dressed in her usual orange leotard costume and was applying on her red lipstick. She looked around to see Rosie pulling on her costume behind a dressing screen and Paige sat at her vanity in her blue bathrobe and pulled her short hair up in a bun. Sandy admitted it was nice to have friends be in the same room with her to dress up, talk, and get ready together. \"This is going to be some event,\" Sandy said, applying blush to her cheeks. Esther came in and helped with the costumes. \"How's it going dears?\" asked Esther. \"We're doing well Mrs. Larkin,\" said Rosie, popping her head from behind her dressing screen. \"Doing great thanks,\" added Sandy, putting on her earrings. Paige stood up from her vanity, completed with her hair and makeup. She walked to her closet and opened the doors to look for her costume. But she stood there, not moving a muscle. She spun around with her hazel eyes filled with anxiety. \"Oh no!\" she exclaimed. \"My costume is gone! I thought it was in the closet! I'm doomed!\" \"I have it right here sweetheart,\" Esther said, holding up the girl's costume. It was a strapless navy blue color with a translucent skirt and sky blue trimming on the neckline. \"Oh, thank you Mama.\" Paige said, giving a sigh of relief and placing a hand to her pounding heart. \"Don't worry, I noticed there was a rip so I sewed it up, and you're good to go.\" \"Thank you again.\" The petite brunette smiled. She gratefully took the costume from her mother and headed to her dressing screen. She removed her robe and hanged it up. She pulled on her costume and slipped it on. Her hands reached to the back to zip it up, but the zipper would not budge and she struggled. \"Mama can you help me with my costume?\" Paige asked. \"Of course, Paige,\" Esther replied. The woman stood behind her daughter and helped pull the zipper up gently. Paige turned back to her mother and smiled. \"Thank you Mama.\" \"You're welcome, darling,\" Esther said, kissing her daughter on the cheek. \"Showtime will be starting soon, so good luck to you dears.\" \"Thank you, Mrs. Larkin,\" said Sandy. Rosie came out from behind her dressing screen and was indeed ready. The woman was dressed in a green top with small sleeves that exposed her midriff and a translucent skirt, gold stud earrings, a yellow choker, grey tights, and green slippers. Her black hair was curled up and pulled in the back with a gold ribbon. Paige headed back to her vanity and placed on silver stud earrings, a light blue choker, her headband, and blue slippers. She came over and pulled out her sky blue parasol. Sandy gave a nod and they headed out of the private car. Dumbo and Timothy arrived and were ready as ever for the show, with Dumbo wearing a pilot's hat and goggles with his yellow and red ruffled clown collar around his neck and Timothy dressed in a blue coat with gold trimming, and his hat was the same color. Sandy knelt down to her knees, and smiled petting Dumbo's head, \"I see you're all set for your act, huh, Dumbo and Timothy?\" \"Yes, Sandy,\" the calf said. \"You said it Sandy,\" Timothy added. \"Dumbo's act with Samson the gorilla is ready. We've been practicin' a lot, and we got it down good.\" \"Yep, it's gonna be fun!\" Dumbo added. They continued their walk and headed towards the animal tent. Rosie stood a few feet away looking at her horses as they were nibbling on hay. The horses included, a palomino, a brown and white appaloosa, a white albino with black stockings on his legs, and a strawberry roan. They were Rosie's favorite horses and she managed to adopt them to train and care for them as if they were her own. \"Summer, Autumn, Winter, and Spring,\" Rosie commanded, holding out her hand to the horses. The horses perked their heads up and they each trotted over to their mistress. Summer went first, Autumn came next, Winter after, and Spring came last. They stopped and lined up in a horizontal row. Sandy and Paige came up and petted the horses. Dumbo walked up with Timothy in his hat, the calf reached up to pet Spring's muzzle and the mare neighed gently. \"Nice meeting you,\" said Dumbo. \"Thank you, little one,\" Spring replied. Paige came up to Autumn and held out an apple in her palm. The appaloosa reached over and ate the fruit, nickering in satisfaction. Paige smiled as the soft muzzle smothered her palm, and she gently petted his head. Sandy walked towards Winter, and stroked the gelding's head. She leaned her forehead onto the horse's forehead and smiled. Winter smiled at the gentle moment from the human. \"You're a kind soul Sandy,\" Winter replied in his tenor voice. \"Thank you Winter,\" the blonde said. \"You're very beautiful and have such wonderful grace.\" \"Thanks.\" The girls continued to groom the horses. In the meantime, Paige did some stretching of her legs to prepare her walk on the tightrope and all was quiet in the tent. \"Good evening girls,\" a voice said. The girls turned back and watched Roy entering the animal tent. The man looked over and examined Rosie carefully, and was awestruck by her beauty. \"How are Summer, Autumn, Winter, and Spring?\" he asked. \"It looks like they're doing just fine,\" Rosie said. \"I'll help you groom them, and maybe decorate them.\" \"I'd like that very much please.\" Rosie headed over to a chest and pulled out gold and green glittering tassels and twisted them into the mane of Winter. Paige decorated Spring with flowers, and Autumn had his mane decorated in leaves the colors of red and gold. While the girls continued to decorate Autumn, Winter, and Spring. Roy was checking over Summer to examine her teeth, patted down her legs and sides. He gave a nod, looking back at the woman combing her mare's mane with a comb. \"Ya know something Rosie, I like to know why you named each of your horses after the seasons?\" Rosie gave a smile, and stroked Summer's forehead, looking at Roy. \"Well, I just felt the seasons match their personalities and their colors, so I felt that each season gives them a special meaning.\" \"Well, either way, I think they suit them just well,\" Roy said smiling. \"Just as your name suits you.\" The two gave each other warm smiles. Chemistry began to build the two as they inched closer to each other. They looked fondly at each other as they inched closer. But their moment was interrupted when a whistle was blow in the distance, with the announcer calling, \"Performers to the spec-line, performers to the spec-line!\" \"Oh it's time!\" Sandy said. \"Everyone ready?\" \"Yep,\" Paige said. Rosie nodded and walked towards Summer, and took her lead rope, and gently pulled, and commanded, \"Walk on!\" The horses followed her to the big top. \"Autumn, move up.\" She took a quick look back, and gave an apologetic look to Roy. Roy nodded in understanding. Everyone began to make their way towards the big top, ready to make a memorable performance. Hello fellow readers, I apologize for the delay of the story. I have been busy with my schoolwork and TEAS exam, and I got accepted into a school for Veterinary Technician, though I'll have to make two choices on what I want to do with my life. Enjoy this story, and I'll post more and the Great Mouse Detective soon. Thank you. ","Summary":" The Sequel is finally here! First time writing a sequel, please read and review! I created a full c"},{"Movie":"Drillbit Taylor","Title":"New School","Author":"FilmFr34k","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8603585","Passage":"[Chapter 1] Too many schools, in too many places. That was my first thought of the day as I ran downstairs to eat breakfast. Schools were all the same no matter where you went, the same cliquey girls, the same jock guys the same place cloned thousands of times and spread out across all states. I shoveled the cardboard cereal flakes into my mouth before running upstairs to get dressed. So today I would go to a new school in a new city, and to be honest I couldn't be more nervous. The thought of a day full of countless, nameless faces wishing welcomes in my direction? Could I think of anything more painful? But before that I had to face the trauma of choosing what to wear. After over ten minutes of deciding, I gave up, and went in what I felt comfortable in. I wore my black three quarter length leggings, Sleeping With Sirens band t-shirt, thin camouflage jacket, grey reeboks and a black beanie hat. After all that pointless fussing I barely had fifteen minutes to straighten my hair and put on my minimal makeup. I all but ran towards to the bus stop and got there with seconds to spare as the yellow monstrosity pulled towards the stop. Shit. No time for a cigarette. I sat more or less at the front of the bus, boxed in by a sea of braces, glasses and acne. I plugged in my iPod and shut out the world as the calming voice of Kurt Cobain flowed from my headphones and into my ears massaging my stressed brain. I closed my eyes and imagined that i was in my happy, a place away from varsity jackets and pom poms. I felt the bus come to a stop and I opened my eyes to catch my first sight of McKinley High. I stepped off the bus and into enemy lines. I got several looks from curious onlookers. These were all expected. I ignored them and skilfully dodged an AV geek all fired up to give me the school tour. I preferred to do things my own way. The school building itself was large, I carefully picked out private spots where I could go while ditching class in favour of nicotine. The thing about being an outsider like me is having the natural sixth sense of noticing when someone is watching you. I felt that strange familiar burning instinct and looked up to see who the eyes belonged to.[Chapter 2] The curve of her lips. The straightness of her nose. The way her hair moved as one big sheet. It fascinated me. I didn't know who this girl was but I wanted to. She was beautiful, her dark brown contrasted with her pale skin and green eyes. She stood out, I liked it. She felt my hot stare as she looked up to catch my eyes gazing. I didn't look away, I didn't change my expression, I just kept scanning her. Most girls would of looked away in embarrassment but not this one, she held my stare refusing to back down. I was sat on the banister of the large, overgrown staircase in front of school. The icy cold stone it was made from seeped into my skin. I gave up resistance and stood up heading towards her. I wanted to know her name to know who she was. We were a couple of meters apart when I watched Tiffany drag her away. Tiffany was the biggest airhead in this school. An overgrown Barbie with the overgrown head to match. People at this school worshiped her popularity and good looks. I however saw what she really was: a stupid slut. She whisked the girl away to a gang of cheerleaders all screeching with hysterics. I never thought people could have opposites but after that sight I was certain they did.[Chapter 3] The giggling and hysterics broke through my bubble. Why was he staring? What had I done? I had been kidnapped by a herd of cheerleaders I caught words and phrases like \"O M G are you new?\", \"Your hat is so cute!\". I couldn't focus on them the boy in front of me stole all my focus and concentration. His short brown hair, his dark blue eyes framed with long eyelashes... He exuded an air of confidence. But more than that he was... Dangerous. He was still keeping my eye contact when a fully grown Barbie walked towards me. \"Hey! I'm Tiffany and welcome to McKinley\" she beamed at me. \"Um... Hi... I'm Rose... Er thanks\" I tripped over my words. I was out of my comfort zone here. This wasn't my scene and these weren't my type of people. They cooed at my scramble of words. I felt the boy's eyes still on me I watched him through my peripheral vision. Leant against a wall, I realised who this boy was. He ran this place. Tiffany stole my attention once more. \"Well if you need anything I'm here to make your time here as super fun as possible! Where's your next class I'll show you it\" she beamed once more. I knew where this was going, lower members of the heard were playing with my hair and discussing my clothes. They were grooming me into one of them I decided just to ditch them there and then. Who cared if they hated me? After going to five schools in three years I realised something. Don't waste your time with people you don't like. \"Yeah don't worry Tiffany, I'm sure I'll be fine\" I would of got away with it just fine if I hadn't let my eyes wander to the figure leant against the wall. Tiffany's mouth formed a small \"o\" shape. She leaned in close to whisper so only we could hear. \"See that guy you're looking at over there? You may think he's hot or something but he's bad news. He's called Filkins, and him and Ronnie spend there time skipping class and getting in trouble. They're scary! I heard that one time he cut off a kids arm with a samurai sword! Stay. Away. From. Them.\" by the end of her speech I had lost interest. He didn't scare me, even if he had cut off some kids arm! I locked eyes again with Filkins. I turned to face the bimbo, her eyes burning into me I only laughed. \"Tiffany, don't tell me what to do\".[Chapter 4] I don't know what she did, but it was good. The look on Tiffany's face said it all - pure shock at the disobedience shown to her. You couldn't help but laugh. The bell randy through the yard and the masses slowly sauntered to their first class. My eyes followed the black hat as it darted through the stream of faces. I thought of following her but thought better of it she'd be going to the office or something waiting for a school tour by some spotty freshman. Epiphany. I chased after her towards the school office. Who could be a better tour guide than me?[Chapter 5] I didn't look back as the group parted for me. I still felt the heat from Tiffany's hot glare but it didn't phase me. I didn't look at him either. It was right what Tiffany said, I did find him attractive. Very attractive. He made me feel uneasy, but in a way I liked it. I anticipated the sound of the bell and headed towards the main office. I was careful with my steps so not to make a fool of myself on my first day. I was also aware that the gabble of cheerleaders would still be watching. I slipped into the main entrance and straight into the path of a small, plump man. I recognised him straight away from our previous meetings as the school principle. \"Good morning Rose! Nice to see you on your first day! How are you feeling? Nervous? Excited?\" When you've had as many encounters like this as me, you learn that there's only one acceptable answer. \"Yeah both\" I smiled. There's no use getting into the whole story of how I really feel, but they're teachers and there's only ever one right answer with teachers. I side stepped around him and headed toward my final destination. The main office was eerily silent compared to the rest of the hectic school. The air conditioning hummed loudly overhead as I walked towards the desk where a tired looking receptionist worked. \"Fill these out\" she yawned as she threw a flutter of coloured paper towards me. It was the usual requirements, I flew through them in a matter of minutes. I handed them back to her in record time and she barely glanced them through before returning to her computer. \"I should probably get you a guide\" she mumbled to herself more than anyone else. \"Terry! What good timing you have! You couldn't give this girl a quick tour could you\" she called to the person behind me. Terry, I thought to myself. What kind of a geek had the set me up with this time. I rolled my eyes as I turned on my heels to face my guide. Instead of the thick glasses I anticipated I came eye to eye with those deep, dark eyes.[Chapter 6] I saw her lips tremble and stutter on what to say. I took away the awkwardness and spoke first. \"Sure\" I called to the receptionist behind her. I leaned close as I said it breathing in her scent of vanilla and apples. \"C'mon\" I smirked as I gestured my head towards the door. She followed me silently into the now silent hallway. We walked for a few more feet in this awkward fiend until I broke it again. \"So what do you wanna do?\" I drawled the word out lazily in a confident tone. She finally looked up at me, and let her body relax as if she'd been holding her breath for an hour. She looked up and down the hallway chewing her lip, then after an eternity replied. \"Right now, all I want is a cigarette\" \"I think I could do with one too\" I leant against the wall around the side of the school building. The tension diffused by the up of nicotine in our bloodstreams. I looked at the beautiful girl in front of me as she blew a stream of smoke from her coral pink lips. I waited till I had finished my cigarette to talk again. \"So you're new?\" stupid question! Of course she was new you dumbass! What did you think she just fell out of the sky!? Now it was her time to smirk, the confident smile flashed along her lips before she replied. \"Yep\" she started \"Brand new school\". She rolled her eyes and went back to her fortress of silence and continued taking drags of her cigarette. \"You don't talk much\" \"My parents taught me not to talk to strangers\" \"You could at least find out my name\" \"I know you're name, Filkins\" \"Then I'm obviously not a stranger\" I had her stumped there. I looked up and we shared a wicked smile. After a moment of her pondering my statement her eyes flicked back to mine. \"Doesn't count, everyone knows who you are\" now it was my time to roll my eyes. \"I have a bit of a reputation, what have you heard?\" if I said I wasn't worried I'd be lying. I didn't want her to get the wrong idea about me before she even met me. She dropped her cigarette butt to the ground and looked up at me through her eyes lashes almost bashfully. \"Not much... Just that how you cause trouble and that I should steer clear from you... Oh and you cut off some kids arm\" she bit back a laugh at the last part. Tiffany had really given me a good slashing. I made a note to cause her a bit of hell later on... I processed the girls words and pasted my words into an acceptable response. I laughed at my thought. \"Well, if you're supposed to stay away from me why are you here, talking to me?\" she giggled under her breath. \"I guess I've never been any good at doing what I'm told\" her voice was cool and soft and I swear I nearly fainted at her flirtatious tone. The bell rang again through the school and the girl picked up her bag to walk away. I grabbed her arm as she turned away and spun her round to face me. \"Meet me? At lunch same place?\" she nodded slowly in response biting her lip playfully. She gently pulled away again walking toward the main building entrance, I watched her go happily. Halfway there she turned back to call over to me. \"By the way! My name is Rose!\"[Chapter 7] I was slightly flustered as I walked back into the main building. It was a shock in comparison to the peaceful corner of the school I'd just left. I dodged students as if on a mine field until eventually reaching my English class. The door was heavy under my fingertips as I pushed inside. I got the usual stares as I walked towards the teacher's desk handing her my crinkled slip from the office. \"Nice to meet you Rose I'm Miss Zachey. You can do a little introduction about yourself in front of the class then we'll find you a seat how does that sound?\" Miss Zachey was blonde and young. She had a bright smile that really put you at ease but I still had to speak my mind. \"Honestly Miss Zachey\" she looked up at me again \"That sounds awful…\" Her face creased a little but then she just chuckled to herself. \"Go find yourself a seat at the back then\" She smiled at me once more, with teeth as unison as an army barrack. She was obviously a better judge of character than I'd thought. I spotted a desk in the back right corner. The perfect place for a girl like me to sit with earphones in and the volume on full blast. I stepped lightly to go unnoticed and slipped into the seat throwing my bag under it. I heard someone sit to my left as the wood creaked at the weight change. I could feel eyes on me but I didn't care, I was used to it. \"PPPST\" I heard someone utter from beside me. I ignored it. \"PPPPPST\" I heard again. \"PPPST! I know you can hear me\" It was a male voice. I turned my head to see a red varsity jacket shining out. The boy had blonde hair styled into messy peaks. His eyes were practically black and his other features were long and narrow. I guess he was attractive, but he wasn't my type to say the least. \"What you ignoring me?\" He spoke again. He smiled at me as his mouth gently moved uo and down chewing gum in a way he thought was seductive. \"No…\" I drawled. \"What's your name?\" \"What's it to you?\" \"If we're going to have a conversation I should probably know your name\" \"Who said we were having a conversation?\" \"Well are you talking to yourself?\" he winked at me. I scoffed slightly. \"The name's Brad\" he whispered over to me. \"Typical…\" I breathed. \"Rose\" I responded. \"Like the flower?\" queried Brad. I rolled my eyes. \"Yes\" I hissed. This boy was dumb and irritating. He had charisma on his side though. I guess some girls would be interested but yet again I'd been stuck with another tail that I didn't want or need. \"Wanna sit with us at lunch?\" He questioned me again. \"I have prior engagement\" \"It's first period\" \"I still have plans\" \"With who?-\" A knock at the door cut him short. ","Summary":" Too many schools, in too many places. That was my first thought of the day as I ran downstairs to e"},{"Movie":"Dumbo","Title":"Cherry and Atticus Meet Dumbo","Author":"PerkyGoth14","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11992294","Passage":"[Chapter 1] Darla and Amber were in the backyard, playing with Patch. \"Okay, Patch, let's see what you can do,\" Amber took out a hoop. \"Come here, boy, jump through the hoop!\" Patch smiled, he wagged his tail, ran up and jumped through the hoop like a circus dog. \"Good boy, Patch!\" Amber cheered. \"That was like in the circus.\" \"I wish I could be in the circus, it looks like a lot of fun.\" Darla smiled. \"Not a lot of circuses are fun...\" Cherry said as she was under a tree in the shade. \"Yeah, trust us, we've been through that experience before.\" Atticus said. \"Let me guess, this was way before you adopted me as your pet, right?\" Patch asked. \"Exactly.\" Atticus said. \"Was this before after the orphanage then?\" Darla asked. \"After,\" Cherry said. \"It was much after I found my parents, I believe it was at least a month or two after we were in Mount Olympus and Zeus rewarded Atticus with his strength.\" \"Ooh, story time!\" Darla was excited. \"Yay!\" Amber cheered. \"Well, then gather around as we tell you the story of how we were in a circus and also how we met Dumbo.\" Atticus said, sounding like a narrator. \"I know this was sometime after we found my parents and you stayed with us since we didn't know yours yet...\" Cherry added. \"It was just a normal day...\" Sometime Ago... \"Cherry, could you wake up Atticus for breakfast?\" Michelle asked. \"ATTICUS! BREAKFAST!\" Cherry yelled as she sat down to eat her morning meal for the first time in about a week. Michelle gave her daughter a look. \"Oh,\" Cherry chuckled nervously. \"You mean go to and wake him up...\" she then went to the guest room which was used as Atticus's bedroom after she moved back in and reunited with her parents, she then knocked on the door. \"Atticus... Breakfast...\" \"I'm coming.\" Atticus told her before getting up and stretching, accidentally making a hole in a wall close to him. \"Huh? That was weird, I must have gotten stronger overnight or something.\" Cherry went back to the kitchen as she sat in her seat. \"He's coming.\" Michelle gave a plate of cheesy scrambled eggs with strips of bacon and a pancake drenched in syrup. Cherry smiled and started to eat right away. They then heard the door from the guest bed room where Atticus was staying in, break off for some reason. Bud was about to join his wife and daughter to breakfast and rushed to the guest room. \"Atticus, are you okay!?\" He was surprised to see the boy holding up an entire door with his right hand from the door knob. \"I swear, I did not mean to do this, I don't even know how I got this strong...\" Atticus said before remembering the reward he got from Zeus. \"So it wasn't a dream.\" \"My goodness...\" Bud was a little shocked. \"I'll have to fix this after breakfast...\" Atticus stared at his hands as he walked down the hallway to Cherry's kitchen table. He looked very shocked and looked all around him. \"I know, Cherry's eating breakfast, such an odd sight...\" Michelle misunderstood his shock with a joking giggle. \"What would you like, Atticus? We got eggs, pancakes, and bacon this morning.\" \"Huh? Oh, um, all three please.\" Atticus told her. Michelle nodded and fixed up a plate for him. Cherry kept eating and looked to Atticus. \"You okay, dude?\" \"Cherry, that dream we had while we had fallen asleep at the museum, it was real.\" Atticus told her. \"You think so?\" Cherry asked as she then took a sip of her juice. \"Yes, because upstairs, I was able to take the door off it's hinges after opening it.\" Atticus told her. \"Hm...\" Cherry pressed her lips together. \"Yeah...\" Atticus nodded to her. \"You better hope Dad can fix it...\" Cherry shrugged. Michelle came back with a plate for Atticus. \"So, what's the plan today, you guys?\" \"Well, there's going to be a circus in town, maybe we could go to that.\" Atticus suggested. \"There's a circus coming to town?\" Cherry asked. \"Ah, I think my friend Tina told me about that the other day...\" Michelle smiled. \"That sounds like fun.\" \"Cool! I hope they have a strongman in their circus.\" Atticus said excitedly, noticing that he was bending his fork. \"Oops...\" \"I never did like those types, they always seemed so cocky and full of themselves...\" Michelle pouted, not noticing the bent fork. \"Guess we're going to the circus today.\" Cherry said. \"Just make sure you eat your breakfast first!\" Bud called as he used his tape measure around the door, planning on fixing it for the day. \"Honey, what are you doing up there!? It's time to eat!\" Michelle called out to her husband. \"Just checking out the door first!\" Bud called back, his inner workman being unleashed. \"You can never stop Daddy doing what he's doing when it involves craft work.\" Cherry sighed. \"So true.\" Michelle sighed. \"These pancakes are delicious!\" Atticus smiled after tasting one of the stacks. Michelle smiled. \"Why, thank you!\" \"You coming with us to the circus, Mom?\" Cherry asked. \"I can drop you off, but I'm afraid I got stores to report,\" Michelle replied. \"Hopefully when I finish, the circus will be over and then I can have you guys come back home in time for dinner.\" \"Okay.\" Atticus and Cherry said. \"Are there any clowns?\" Cherry asked, shuffling her hands. Atticus shrugged. \"Maybe...\" \"Guh...\" Cherry shuddered. \"Hopefully they don't hit me with a pie in the face or spray me with a flower.\" \"If any of them try anything, I'll give them a knuckle sandwich.\" Atticus said. Cherry let out a small chuckle as she continued to eat. After breakfast, Cherry and Atticus got dressed while Michelle got her work stuff together to take the two to the circus to spend their day while Bud was fixing up the guest room door and where hopefully it would be done today. \"Now, remember, stick together and no wondering off from each other.\" Michelle told them while driving the two of them to the circus. \"Yeah, Mom.\" Cherry nodded. Michelle came to a stoplight, then handed some money. \"Here's some money for snacks and of course, your tickets.\" \"Thanks.\" Atticus took the money and handed it to Cherry. Cherry took it and put it in a safe spot in her pocket. \"Have fun and don't get into any trouble.\" Michelle said. \"Okay, Mom...\" Cherry said then with a small smile. \"Don't worry.\" Michelle smiled as she kept driving until she would get to the stop. \"If anything happens, you can always call me.\" \"We know, Mom.\" Cherry said. Michelle nodded as she kept driving. Cherry and Atticus stared out the windows until they would be dropped off, wondering what the circus would await them. 'Maybe this circus will have elephant ears, the good kind.' Atticus thought to himself. \"Hmm...\" Cherry lightly hummed. Soon, Michelle rode them up. \"Here you go...\" she told her passengers. \"I'll see you guys later.\" \"See ya, Mom.\" Cherry siad as she unhooked her seat-belt and left the car. \"See ya, Mrs. Butler.\" Atticus said as he unhooked his seat-belt and left the car with her. Michelle waved to them and then drove off to get her work started for the day. Cherry and Atticus then went to join the people visiting the circus today. All they had to do to see the circus from inside was to buy their tickets. Before officially going in, Cherry and Atticus took a small look to see what was there to offer at the circus. There were animals in their cages that people passed by to see until a show would start in one of the tents. One gorilla snarled, he shook the bars of his cage so hard that he accidentally broke one bar off and tried to sneak it back in place before anyone would see. \"Cool, animals, can't wait to see what human performers they have.\" Atticus said. \"I hope it's not cliche like a bearded lady...\" Cherry said as they looked at the various caged animals who did not seem to be too bothered with the fact that they were in cages. \"Yeah, that would just be boring.\" Atticus said while now looking for human performers. There was a brown mouse in a red uniform who was wandering around the ground, being very careful not to get stepped on by any unsuspecting humans. Atticus continued to look around for any human performers, especially since one of them was his favorite act. Cherry hummed as she looked around, then noticed Atticus wasn't by her side, so she rushed over to him. 'Should be around here somewhere.' Atticus thought to himself while looking for the strongman's tent. \"Whatcha lookin' for?\" Cherry asked. Atticus flinched slightly since she came from nowhere, but settled down. \"Looking for the strongman's tent.\" \"I think I heard people saying his name was Atlas...\" Cherry shrugged. \"Perfect, so all we have to do is find him.\" Atticus said. Cherry and Atticus wandered to look for the strongest man in the circus. There was an elephant mother who was inside one tent and was resting until she woke up. She looked around with wonder, she spotted the two kids and smiled once to them. Cherry and Atticus gave friendly waves, wondering if they should ask her or not. \"Um... Excuse me, ma'am...\" Cherry walked over to the female elephant. \"Do you know where the strongman is?\" \"He's in the tent right over there.\" The female elephant told them, pointing her trunk to the left north west. \"Thanks.\" Atticus said. \"Yes, thank you, umm...\" Cherry replied, drawling out. \"Jumbo,\" the mother elephant told her. \"Mrs. Jumbo.\" \"Thank you, Mrs. Jumbo, see in the circus.\" Atticus and Cherry said to her before going over to the tent that the strongman was in getting himself ready. Mrs. Jumbo smiled to them and went back to resting. The strong man had tan skin and had wavy red hair. He was lifting a bar bell up and down, counting himself as he brought it up and down, he seemed to be straining, but not too much. Cherry and Atticus walked over to see him as he was preparing himself. 'He sure doesn't relax for a second.' Atticus thought to himself. The man roared and threw down the bar bell, then smiled smugly as he flexed his muscles, then looked to Atticus and Cherry. Cherry and Atticus plainly and simply smiled back. \"What do you children want and why are you here without a guardian or permission?\" the strongman demanded. Cherry stepped behind Atticus for protection. \"We just wanted to meet you, sir.\" \"Yeah, it's just that we've never seen a strongman before and wanted to see one live and in person.\" Atticus told them. \"Well, that was only practice, the real show will begin in the big top and the stupid strength test thing will be in it too to see if anyone can match my strength,\" Atlas scoffed before smirking before lifting up a fifty pound weight and started to lift it up and down with one hand. \"Like anyone will ever defeat me, I'm the strongest man in the world.\" \"Maybe you'd like to see what I can do?\" Atticus offered. Atlas looked to the boy and laughed out loud. \"Oh, you're very funny, little one... Nobody's stronger than me!\" \"Wanna bet?\" Cherry narrowed her eyes, slightly angry since a friend of hers was being picked on and she did not take kindly to that. \"Listen, I gotta keep up my strength,\" Atlas said, putting down the fifty pound weight and then picks up the 500 pound dumbbell weights and starts lifting them up. \"So, go and wait for the show to start before I use these on you two.\" Atticus wanted to show this guy his new strength, but decided to wait until the challenge. \"You can take him...\" Cherry said. \"I know I can...\" Atticus looked sharply determined. Cherry shrugged. \"Guess I'll watch... I can't even lift a live chicken.\" They both then left the strongman's tent and made their way to the big top. \"So, what will you do to show up that cocky jerk?\" Cherry asked. \"You know I will...\" Atticus said determined. \"I guess next you run away and join the circus after showing up that egomaniac...\" Cherry joked, showing her dark sense of humor again. \"If I meet another guy who's that big and strong and can hurt me just by snapping his fingers, I think I'll drop off the brink of sanity.\" \"Oh, please, the only way I would join the circus is if the ringmaster was evil and would be using my own strength against me.\" Atticus scoffed. \"You're better than that...\" Cherry walked with him to explore.[Chapter 2] More female elephants came to where Mrs. Jumbo was and decided to see her. \"I wonder why the others going to see Mrs. Jumbo?\" Cherry thought out loud. \"I don't know, maybe they're expecting like a baby or something.\" Atticus shrugged. \"Oh... Makes sense...\" Cherry nodded then. \"I guess she'll have a baby soon... Hmm... Wonder if we'll meet the baby... Never saw a baby elephant before.\" \"Maybe we will, maybe we won't.\" Atticus said. \"Oh, well...\" Cherry shrugged. A man with a black top hat was putting his hat on and going to a tent. \"Must be the ringmaster...\" Cherry guessed. \"Hope he's not like Uncle Al.\" \"Well, we'll soon find out in the big top.\" Atticus said. \"Let's take a look around until they announce.\" Cherry then suggested. With that, Cherry and Atticus wandered around the fair ground. \"You ready, big guy?\" the ringmaster asked Atlas as he smiled smugly in the mirror like he was in love with his own reflection. \"I sure am, boss.\" Atlas told the ringmaster with a smug smile. The ringmaster hid an eye roll over Atlas's narcissism. \"There's a lot of kids out there, go be their hero.\" \"I sure will.\" Atlas said with a smug smile. \"And remember, we are still having that challenge.\" The ringmaster told him. \"Right, like there's any doubt...\" Atlas laughed. \"True, but still, I know how funny it is to you, so that's why we do it to keep you happy and besides, we might get another member to the circus and where he or she will be your partner while a friend of his or hers will also come along, but we keep that part secret.\" The ringmaster said. \"Gotcha...\" Atlas chuckled. \"Oh, I almost feel sorry for those victims...\" \"Be ready in about five,\" the ringmaster told him. \"I'll make up a contract.\" \"Perfect, either way, it will be entertaining.\" Atlas said. The ringmaster gave a thumb's up and left to his own tent. \"This'll be a great closing show for this town.\" A lion was circling its cage as Cherry stared back and then it came up close and roared in her face, blowing her hair back. Cherry slid her glasses off, rubbed them against her shirt. \"Very good...\" she then pushed her glasses back. \"My turn...\" she then cleared her throat and roared viciously back at the big cat. The lion mewed weakly like a kitten and backed up. \"That's what I thought.\" Cherry glanced. \"You amaze me sometimes, Cherry.\" Atticus said to his best friend. \"I'm just full of surprises, you can never tell what I'm going to do next.\" Cherry told him. Atticus lightly laughed to this. Cherry checked the time. \"Come on... Come on...\" she then looked to the center where the show would be held and she was getting impatient. \"Get started already!\" As if on cue, people began to come right in and the show was going to start very soon. \"Finally...\" Cherry groaned. \"Come on, let's get a seat.\" Atticus told her. Cherry nodded and followed him. They both entered inside with the rest of the crowd and decided to sit on the bottom bleachers. The female elephants were getting in position as there was upbeat circus music now playing. \"Well, girls, it's time for the show to start.\" The first elephant told the rest. Another elephant giggled like an easily impressed child. \"Oh, I just know they'll love us!\" \"Why wouldn't they?\" The second elephant asked with a scoff. \"Now, girls...\" Mrs. Jumbo giggled to them, settling them out. \"We're all wonderful in our own special and unique way.\" \"Yes we are, thank you for reminding us that, Mrs. Jumbo.\" The first elephant told her. Mrs. Jumbo giggled as she stood with her fellow elephants. Soon a little while later, the ringmaster came into the center of the huge tent. The audience then ended their personal and private conversations until the show started and they all started to shush each other. 'And the show is about to start.' Atticus thought to himself. \"Ladies and gentlemen, boys, and girls, welcome to the Casey Junior circus!\" the ringmaster introduced. \"This is our final show in this town as we'll be packing up to leave first thing tomorrow morning!\" \"Aww...\" some of the kids groaned in dismay. \"However, we promise to come back to your wonderful town again very soon!\" the ringmaster continued with a friendly smile. \"Yay!\" The kids and adults cheered. \"And don't forget, we are still having our challenge to see who can match the strength of our one and only strongman Atlas and to see if one of you will be the lucky winner!\" The ringmaster told them. Atticus was really looking forward to that part. \"But first, may I introduce our lovely elephants?\" the ringmaster introduced. \"Our Matriarch, Mrs. Jumbo, Catty, Prissy, and Giddy!\" Each of the elephants came in as their names were mentioned and everyone in the crowd began to cheer as each elephant came in. Mrs. Jumbo seemed to stare off into space, but she did come when her name was called. 'She seems distant, she must be waiting for something, but what?' Atticus thought to himself. After the elephants, next was the rest of the circus before Atlas and the challenge. The elephants wowed and amazed the crowd with their performance. \"Good show, ladies, really good show...\" the ringmaster smiled to the elephants. Mrs. Jumbo gave a sweet smile while her fellow pachyderms looked rather smug about his compliment. The ringmaster then introduced the clowns. \"Of course...\" Cherry lowly scoffed. \"Oh, great.\" Atticus said with rolled eyes, even somehow finding these clowns annoying. Cherry leaned back and folded her arms. The clowns came in their tiny car and filed out one-by-one and did their lame juggling tricks and making most of the audience laugh at their pain and expense. Cherry visibly yawned and folded her arms. 'They're good, not great, but good.' Atticus thought to himself. \"Next...\" Cherry rolled her eyes. The clowns ended by shooting each other out of cannons and landed in cream pies which splashed over the audience. They then took their leave and the crowd cheered them off. \"Thank goodness...\" Cherry was relieved. \"Hopefully the next act is more entertaining.\" Atticus whispered to her. Cherry slowly nodded, feeling bored that they came to this circus. It seemed to take forever, but the ringmaster had finally introduced Atlas. 'Finally!' Atticus thought to himself. Atlas grinned to the crowd and waved to show off his strength until the little contest after his act. The crowd was amazed at what he could do like they had never seen anything like it before. Cherry was not all that impressed though, after Atticus got his strength, anyone else who was not a god or superhero who was that strong just bored her. Atlas did his act by lifting up a 500 pound dumbbell weight and where this did impress the entire crowd except for Cherry and Atticus. \"Ugh, I wish I had a fancy phone like everybody else...\" Cherry took out her flip phone and stabbed the buttons just to get on the internet which took what felt like an hour. After Atlas's act, it was now finally time for the challenge. \"Now, as you all know, whoever can match Atlas the strongman's strength or maybe even is stronger than him wins!\" The ringmaster told everyone while Atlas was flexing his muscles. \"Now who feels like he can beat or match his or her strength against the mighty Atlas!\" \"I'll take the challenge!\" Atticus's voice called out. The audience gasped and turned to Atticus, thinking he was silly or dumb for his request. Cherry pointed to Atticus. \"You dare challenge the world's strongest man?\" Atlas laughed. \"This'll be fun... Hopefully he doesn't cry when I beat him since I'm a grown man and he's a mere child...\" \"You better hope so...\" the ringmaster said to him, then called out to Atticus. \"Step right up then, young lad!\" Atticus then came up from the bleachers and went up to the strongman. Cherry lightly clapped. \"A round of applause for the brave and daring boy!\" the ringmaster told the crowd. Everybody else clapped for Atticus. \"You dare challenge me?\" Atlas laughed. \"You probably can barely lift your school textbooks let alone a dumbbell!\" Atticus ignores his comment and went over to the dumbbell, ready to lift it up. Atlas hid an amused chuckle, like he was expecting Atticus to fail and make a fool of himself. He really was a selfish and vain bully when it came to his own personal strength. Little did he know, he was the one who was going to be shown up and not Atticus. Atticus bent down and grabbed the 500 pound weight dumbbell and lifted it up with a few grunts even if it wasn't that hard. Atlas laughed at first, then the ringmaster nudged him, he then stopped laughing once he saw what Atticus had done. The audience oohed and awed in surprise and amazement. Atticus then bent the dumbbell into a loop which amazed everyone once again. Cherry quietly clapped, she had already seen this all before, so she wasn't as impressed, but she was surprised to learn that her and Atticus's adventure with Hercules was not a dream. \"Looks like you got some competition.\" the ringmaster chuckled to Atlas. \"Just get the contract ready.\" Atlas whispered to the ringmaster. The ringmaster took a brief leave. Atticus laughed as he used his new strength that was rewarded to him for saving Hercules and bringing him back to Mount Olympus. \"You from Krypton or somethin', boy?\" Atlas scoffed. \"No, just gifted with incredible strength.\" Atticus smirked. Atlas snarled and looked like he really wanted to hurt Atticus for showing him up. Atticus put the bar bell down and smiled to the crowd as they cheered for him. \"I know him!\" Cherry told the crowd, pointing to Atticus. \"I know him!\" Atlas began to try to straighten out the dumbbell as best as he could. \"Guess you're not so strong now, eh?\" Atticus laughed a little. Atlas glared to him. \"You're such a fool...\" Atticus straightened the dumbbell out for him before letting it drop to the ground. This made the audience thump slightly. \"Oh, my...\" one of the female elephants said to the Matriarch. \"He seems rather good for his size...\" \"So it seems...\" the Matriarch looked to Atticus long and hard. \"He must have been gifted with that strength somehow.\" Mrs. Jumbo said. \"Yes...\" the Matriarch rolled her eyes. \"I think he's cute!\" one of the female elephants giggled. \"Oh, brother...\" The Matriarch groaned. \"Mercy me!\" the ringmaster rushed to Atticus's side with a contract. \"You are brilliant, my boy! Your parents must be so proud of you!\" \"Oh, um, I-I don't know if I have any parents.\" Atticus frowned. This caused for everyone to gasp. Atticus shuffled his foot to the ground with his hands behind his back. \"He lives with me,\" Cherry walked over. \"I found out who my parents were and reunited with them, but I didn't want Atticus to be alone since he's my best friend and I offered to let him stay with us.\" \"Oh, how kind of you.\" The ringmaster smiled. \"Now why don't I speak with Atticus alone?\" \"I don't like this...\" Cherry said softly, she then walked away and accidentally ran into the elephants. \"Whoa!\" \"Oh, careful!\" Mrs. Jumbo helped her up with her trunk. Cherry patted herself down and smiled to Mrs. Jumbo.[Chapter 3] The ringmaster and Atticus then went into his tent/office. \"What did you want to talk to me about, sir?\" Atticus asked. \"I would like you to be part of our Casey Junior circus family...\" the ringmaster said, he seemed to have a rather fiendish smile for some reason. \"After all, you just said you didn't have a family of your own... So, I would like you to become a star attraction for us... Just think about it! We travel all around the country and people will pay big bucks just to see your super and special talent!\" \"I'm sorry, sir, but I couldn't just leave Cherry and her family out of nowhere.\" Atticus said. \"Hmm... Too bad...\" the ringmaster folded his arms. \"I thought we could make something of you... After all, you're an orphan and orphans are just as good as living on the ground forever... You'll get a lot of money, fame, and fortune, anything your little heart desires!\" \"I don't know...\" Atticus said. \"And besides, if you don't sign, then you'll be known to everyone as a freak.\" The ringmaster said. \"A freak...?\" Atticus whispered, feeling hurt by that term. \"Oh, yes, everybody knows if you're not apart of a circus and have special skills, you're a freak,\" the ringmaster told him. \"You don't want to go back home and have everyone think of you like that, now do you?\" Atticus began to think about that and sighed. \"Where do I sign?\" he then asked in defeat. \"Just initial here, here, and here, and sign at the very bottom next to the X.\" the ringmaster smiled darkly, holding out the contract to him and clicked the pen for him to use. Atticus grabbed the pen and started to sign the contract while regretting to do this, knowing that he wouldn't see Cherry ever again or her family. \"Excellent...\" the ringmaster smiled darkly. Atticus frowned since he was never going to see Cherry again and it made him cry, she may not had been actually, but she was like family to him. \"Now you'll just need a circus uniform like Atlas's.\" The ringmaster said. Atticus slowly nodded. Cherry couldn't help but listen in and she was a little angry. \"You can't take my best friend away from me!\" \"I can and I will, especially after he signed this legal contract.\" The ringmaster smirked evilly. \"NO!\" Cherry refused. \"I won't let you!\" \"I'm sorry, Cherry...\" Atticus bowed his head with his eyes shut. \"Unless you would like to join him.\" The ringmaster said to her. \"What?\" Cherry put her hands on her hips. \"Join the circus, or leave now and never see your friend again.\" the ringmaster tempted. Cherry thought it over and sighed, shutting her eyes. \"I know I'm gonna regret this...\" \"Perfect.\" The ringmaster smiled evilly before bringing up the contract for her to sign. Cherry frowned uneasily, but she skimmed over the words as she gripped the pen and was ready to sign it. \"You don't have to do this...\" Atticus said to his oldest friend. \"I must...\" Cherry insisted, feeling like a slave. She began to sign the contract as she finished signing the contract her mother came into the tent before gasping. \"Oh, hello there, ma'am, did you enjoy the show?\" the ringmaster asked, not knowing her. \"Cherry,\" Michelle rushed over. \"What's going on?\" \"Mom, I have to help Atticus...\" Cherry told her mother. \"They are now part of the circus.\" The ringmaster told her. \"Nobody's putting my baby in a circus or her friends!\" Michelle hugged Cherry then. \"We got a contract, lady...\" the ringmaster showed her that Cherry and Atticus signed the contracts. \"They are now legally mine.\" Michelle was about to tell him off and say that he couldn't do that, but saw that the contract was indeed legal. \"Mom...?\" Cherry lowly moaned. Michelle had tears in her eyes. \"I can't believe this...\" \"Sorry, but they are officially mine.\" The ringmaster smiled evilly before putting the contract away. \"NO!\" Michelle grew devastated. \"My baby...\" Cherry came to her mother and gave her one last hug. \"It's okay, Mom, I'm sure we'll be okay...\" \"Yeah.\" Atticus said. \"Before anything else, these two need to get into their circus uniforms, by the way, little girl, what are you good at?\" The ringmaster asked. Cherry shrugged. \"Finding the dark side in everything.\" Michelle was too emotional to say or do anything. \"Hmm, you'll have to be our animal tamer.\" The ringmaster said. \"I guess...\" Cherry held herself. The ringmaster came up to Michelle and pushed her out of the tent/office. \"Run along now, go back in the kitchen and start cooking for your husband, your daughter is mine now.\" \"Goodbye, Mom...\" Cherry said lowly. \"Goodbye, Mrs. Butler...\" Atticus added. Michelle sniffled, she then went back to her car and decided to just drive home since there was nothing else she could really do. \"Now you two, go into the dressing rooms and put these on.\" The ringmaster told them before giving the two of them the new clothes they would wear. Cherry watched as her mother's car drove off without them, she then sighed and followed the ringmaster as she was now going to be a circus girl with Atticus. Atticus's uniform was like a strongman costume only it was in his size and Cherry's uniform was a suit with a whip. Cherry did not like the bow tie, she stuck her tongue out at it, but she wore it anyway. \"Oh, the next town is going to just love you two,\" the ringmaster smiled darkly, then turned to Atlas. \"Uh, I hope you can find business with your life elsewhere, Atlas, it was nice knowing you...\" \"This is an outrage!\" Atlas snarled, storming off as he was basically fired from his circus occupation. \"Wait, um, why can't the circus have two strongmen, wouldn't that be good for show business?\" Atticus asked. \"Sorry, but it was in his contract, he's on the streets and I don't bend the rules for anybody!\" the ringmaster selfishly replied. But he then thought about what Atticus said and where he began to imagine all of the money that he would gain and how many people would come to see two strongmen instead of just one. Atticus merely shrugged. \"Excuse me...\" the ringmaster walked off then. Cherry came to see the female elephants. \"Mrs. Jumbo, are you okay?\" she asked the kindest out of all the elephants. \"You seemed to have your mind elsewhere during your act today.\" \"Oh, forgive me, young one, I just have a lot on my mind...\" Mrs. Jumbo smiled bashfully. \"I'm expecting a special delivery...\" \"Is it a baby?\" Cherry assumed. \"Yes, as a mater of fact, it is, I've been waiting for Mr. Stork to deliver it to me.\" Mrs. Jumbo told her. \"Guess he hasn't come yet, huh?\" Cherry asked. Mrs. Jumbo sighed. \"No, but I'm a little tired of waiting... I'm really excited and a little nervous, I just hope I'll be a wonderful mother.\" \"I'm sure you will, ma'am.\" Cherry encouraged. \"Oh, thank you and I hope your friend's kindness will be able to rub off on Atlas.\" Mrs. Jumbo said. \"I hope so...\" Cherry said softly as she looked back. \"Atlas seems like a real Gaston...\" \"Whom?\" Mrs. Jumbo wondered. \"Never mind it for now...\" Cherry said, then gently rubbed her trunk in a petting gesture. \"Well, I guess I could make a living at the circus and never see my parents again...\" \"I'm so sorry to hear that.\" Mrs. Jumbo frowned. \"I'll be okay...\" Cherry said softly. \"It'll be like when me and Atticus lived with Cinderella.\" \"Good to know.\" Mrs. Jumbo said. \"So, what happens after the final show in the county?\" Cherry asked. \"We clean up, get in the train, and get ready to go to the next town,\" Mrs. Jumbo explained. \"Maybe your friend could help set up tents and we have a parade on the first day of a new gig after we get some sleep after an exhausting travel.\" \"I see...\" Cherry shrugged. \"Oh, well, I always wanted to go around the world.\" While they were talking, the ringmaster was agreeing with Atticus's idea. \"Atlas, come back here!\" the ringmaster called. Atlas scoffed and walked over. \"What now?\" \"You're not fired, you and Atticus are going to be partners.\" The ringmaster said. \"Partners!?\" Atlas sneered. \"I share the spotlight with no one!\" \"It's that or nothing, buddy,\" Atticus folded his arms at the egocentric man. \"Be thankful, I saved your career!\" Atlas hated to admit it, but Atticus was right, Atticus didn't have to save his career. \"All right, but don't make me look stupid, kid!\" \"I won't.\" Atticus said. Atlas folded his arms. \"Right...\" he then nodded once. \"Well, let's get ready for our next travel on the train then!\" the ringmaster proclaimed. The ringmaster then left the two alone to tell the others. \"This is gonna be fun... I guess...\" Atticus shrugged. \"What have I got to lose?\" \"Just don't show me up.\" Atlas glared. \"I won't...\" Atticus rolled his eyes slightly. \"Sheesh...\" \"Good that we have an understanding,\" Atlas said. \"Now, come on, we gotta help bring everything down so then we can get to the next town and while we're getting to the next town, you are going to have to exercise a lot with me if you are going to have muscles to show your strength.\" \"Yeah, yeah...\" Atticus laughed, Atlas felt like a boorish older brother substitute, but he went along with it. Once everything was settled, it was time to load up the train and clean up to go to the next stop.[Chapter 4] The workers started to sing about their Casey Junior train. \"Is the song really necessary?\" Atticus whispered. \"Unfortunately, it is. Sad, but true.\" Atlas whispered back with a groan. Cherry sighed as they were now leaving the circus area, which also meant she was leaving her parents for the rest of her life. Atticus helped clean up and joined her in a box car. Once the train was all set up, they then took their leave. Cherry and Atticus looked to each other, then stared out the back as they were leaving their home and starting their new lives. Atticus was to be with Atlas but the big strongman allowed him and Cherry to spend some time with any of the animals. \"So, you actually ran away and joined the circus?\" Amber asked after the first part of the story. \"Wow, and I thought Mom's Madame Raya job was a hassle.\" \"So what happened next?\" Darla asked. \"We had a rather long ride, it lasted for a couple of days, but of course we stopped,\" Cherry explained. \"But, before we got to our new town, something wonderfully amazing happened.\" \"What?\" Darla and Amber asked. \"We met Dumbo.\" Cherry smiled then. \"Now we get to find out how you two met Dumbo.\" Patch smiled. \"We're getting to that...\" Atticus chuckled to his puppy. \"I hear baby elephants can weigh 200 pounds.\" Amber randomly said. \"I used to know an elephant...\" Darla rubbed her arm slightly. \"Anyway, please continue.\" Patch said. \"Well, we'll skip the ride until that day we met Dumbo.\" Cherry suggested to spare them the boredom of riding on train tracks for a rather long while. On Casey Junior Train... Cherry yawned and stretched, she got up steadily and decided to check on the animals, they were all still asleep, but the elephants seemed awake, so she decided to go see them. Atticus was awake as well so he decided to check on the elephants as well. Cherry yawned and rubbed her eye. \"Still tired?\" Atticus asked. \"Yeah, who knew train rides could be boring?\" Cherry mumbled. They came in and saw Mrs. Jumbo as she still looked a little lost and lonely. \"Looks like her special delivery hasn't arrived yet.\" Cherry said. \"So it is a baby?\" Atticus asked. \"Yeah, she said the stork should come anytime now though...\" Cherry folded her arms. Mrs. Jumbo sighed, she looked over to the human kids, and smiled simply to them, waving with her trunk to them. The two kids waved back to her. \"He must have gotten lost or something if he's this late.\" Atticus said. \"I don't know...\" Mrs. Jumbo said softly. \"I was just really hoping soon...\" \"Boy or girl?\" Cherry casually asked. \"I don't know that either, but either way, I will love the baby the way he or she is.\" Mrs. Jumbo said. They then over heard someone call out Mrs. Jumbo's name. \"Who said that?\" Cherry wondered. The other female elephants stuck their trunks out and called out to who was calling for the expecting future mother. And where to their luck, it was a stork who seemed to have something bundled up. \"Whew, at last!\" Mr. Stork grew relieved once he met the female elephants. \"Which one of you ladies is expecting?\" The elephants shook their heads and declined. \"Certainly not,\" the Matriarch singled herself out, then gestured to Mrs. Jumbo. \"Over there, of course.\" \"This would be the lucky one, sir.\" Atticus said while pointing to Mrs. Jumbo. \"Oh, of course,\" Mr. Stork flew over to Mrs. Jumbo, taking out a piece of paper. \"'Here is a baby with eyes of blue, straight from heaven, right to you'-\" Mrs. Jumbo extended her trunk to open the bundle. \"Or is it, 'straight from heaven, up above, here is a baby for you to love'?\" Mr. Stork felt confused then. \"Very catchy.\" Atticus said. Mrs. Jumbo reached to open the bundle again. \"Sign here, please.\" Mr. Stork handed a notebook. \"She's expecting a baby, not a package.\" Cherry told the stork. \"Rules are rules.\" Mr. Stork replied to her. Darla folded her arms. \"Do babies really come from storks?\" she asked her foster brother and older friend. \"Uhhh...\" Cherry and Atticus looked to each other bashfully. \"Let's save that question for later.\" Patch said. \"Yes... Let's...\" Cherry said. Back to the story... Mrs. Jumbo signed an X on the line, very anxious to meet her new baby, she then reached to open her bundle yet again. \"One moment please, this is still part of the service,\" Mr. Stork halted, then took out a whistle and started to sing Happy Birthday to the newborn elephant. The song was going great until Mr. Stork was stuck on the name since the baby wasn't named yet. \"Dear... Dear... Dear me, what's his name?\" Mrs. Jumbo had a name picked out already now that she knew she was going to have a son. \"Jumbo Junior...\" she said softly. \"Oh, Jumbo Jr, huh?\" Mr. Stork smiled. \"Okay, Jumbo Jr...\" he then blew the whistle and started his song over for the baby. It continued on as he began to finish the song. As he did, he accidentally got caught on a mail post, but was able to finish his song as the train left without him then. \"Oh, do hurry, dear.\" Prissy urged Mrs. Jumbo so they could meet the new elephant. \"I'm on pins and needles!\" Giddy squealed. \"Ah, this is a proud, proud day...\" the Matriarch smiled proudly. \"Now hurry up and open it, dear.\" Catty urged. \"Yeah, open it, I can't wait to see the baby elephant.\" Atticus said. Mrs. Jumbo unwrapped the bundle and let the sheet drop to show the baby. The elephant was rather small and was wrapped up in his ears and had shiny blue eyes, leaving everybody in awe at the sight of him. \"Hey, little guy...\" Cherry even cooed at the baby elephant. \"Hey there, little guy.\" Atticus cooed. \"Oh, he is a darling little baby...\" Giddy smiled. \"Adorable,\" the Matriarch praised. \"Simply adorable.\" \"Did you ever see anything so cunning?\" Prissy asked. The elephant baby smiled to the company he was given. \"You must be so proud.\" Atticus smiled at Mrs. Jumbo. \"I really am...\" Mrs. Jumbo was so happy to have finally meet and earn her baby boy. The Matriarch bent down and tickled the baby with her trunk. The baby sniffled as he felt something strange and finally, he let out after a long breath, he sneezed and his ears popped out, showing that they were quite large, even for a baby elephant. \"Bless-WHOA!\" Cherry was surprised. \"Well, that's surprising.\" Atticus said. The elephants were surprised, but in somewhat a bad way. \"Is it possible?\" the Matriarch asked. \"Isn't there some mistake?\" Prissy added. \"Just look at those,\" Giddy was about to say before whispering into the elephant next to her in her own ear. \"E-A-R-S.\" \"Those what?\" Catty asked before realizing and laughing. \"Oh, ears! Aren't they funny?\" she then picked up one of the baby's ears with her trunk in a mocking way. \"Hey leave him alone!\" Atticus told them. Mrs. Jumbo slapped Giddy's trunk. The other female elephants recoiled in shock like they hadn't done anything wrong. \"That's MEAN!\" Cherry was angry with the female elephants now. \"He's just a baby!\" \"Yeah! How would you feel if someone said something mean about you?!\" Atticus glared at the female elephants. \"Oh, my goodness.\" Prissy gasped. \"What tempers...\" Catty commented. \"Oh, what did I do?\" Giddy asked. \"Tell me, did I say anything?\" \"Pretty harmless remark.\" the Matriarch added in defense. \"You were being bullies to him!\" Atticus told them. \"I just said that they're funny, and they are funny.\" Giddy defended herself. \"They certainly are.\" Catty agreed. \"After all, who cares about her precious little Jumbo?\" Prissy scoffed. \"Jumbo?\" Catty replied. \"You mean 'Dumbo'.\" \"Why you!\" Atticus glared. The other female elephants just kept laughing while bullying and teasing the baby. Cherry held the baby elephant and glared to them, she may had been dark and depressing at times, but even she had standards. Atticus saw what was keeping the female elephants' top door open and began to whisper to Mrs. Jumbo of what to do to the bully female elephants. Mrs. Jumbo saw that and nodded, agreeing with him. She then moved her trunk up to the screw and unlatched it as her friends laughed at her baby and the door slammed shut, silencing Catty, Prissy, Giddy, and the Matriarch. Cherry stuck her tongue out firmly with a nod, then looked back to Mrs. Jumbo and the baby. \"You okay?\" \"Thank you for not laughing...\" Mrs. Jumbo sounded thankful. \"You're welcome.\" Atticus and Cherry smiled. \"Hey, Junior, don't be sad...\" Cherry knelt down next to the baby. \"Everybody gets bullied, but it was very unfair they did it to you and you were just born, but don't worry, when you get older, bullies won't bother you, and we don't think your ears are weird, we think you're special just the way you are.\" \"Yeah.\" Atticus nodded. \"You are both such wonderful children...\" Mrs. Jumbo praised them. \"Hey, just look at me...\" Cherry stood up straight then. \"I get hurt all the time, but I always come out on top.\" \"You get hurt a lot?\" Mrs. Jumbo asked in concern. \"Yeah... I don't get it either...\" Cherry shrugged. \"I just get a lot of bad luck.\" \"Yeah.\" Atticus said. \"Atticus! It's time to come back!\" Atlas's voice called out. Atticus sighed at that. \"Well, I better get going...\" \"Okay... See ya...\" Cherry waved to him. \"Be careful back there.\" \"I'll try.\" Atticus said before going back to Atlas. Cherry waved to him, then yawned and decided to go back to her boxcar and get some sleep until the train would stop.[Chapter 5] \"You wanted to see me?\" Atticus walked over to meet Atlas. \"Yes.\" Atlas nodded before bringing him over to the weights and then picks up a 500 pound weight dumbbell and throws it to Atticus to see if he would catch it and fall to the ground. Atticus gasped at that and caught the weight. It was a bit heavier than last time and where he did fall to the ground. \"Oops, looks like I painted over the extra zero.\" Atlas chuckled before wiping off the paint to see the extra zero. Atticus glared at him before getting up and started to lift it up with his feel strength before walking over to him and then began to tie the dumbbell around his chest and shoulders. \"Impressive, you're as strong as Hercules.\" Atlas said. \"There's a reason for that...\" Atticus laughed at his little inside joke with Atlas's assumption. Atlas began to try to break free and where he was able to. \"Well, so am I or at least half as strong as him, now let's see if you can do it.\" he then said while doing the same thing to Atticus. \"Hey!\" Atticus frowned at that. \"Try it, Muscle Boy, try it!\" Atlas laughed. \"Okay then.\" Atticus smiled before grunting as he began to use all of his strength to break free. He was able to break out of it and then crushed one of the ends of it. Atlas was both impressed and angered that a little boy could be just as, if not more, strong than him. But for some reason, he didn't let his anger get to him, something about this boy seem to only let him fill a void in him and where this kid could help him with his acts. And so he decided to bring out a box in between them and brought two stools. \"Take a seat, kid, we're going to arm wrestle to see if you are strong as me or stronger.\" Atlas said. \"You don't know when to quit, do you?\" Atticus sighed, rolling his eyes. \"If you're not up for it, I understand...\" Atlas laughed. \"Oh, I'm up for it.\" Atticus said before siting down. \"Now we'll see how strong you are against me in this.\" Atlas said, ready to arm wrestle with him. \"Ladies first...\" Atticus smirked, rolling up his one sleeve and held out his arm. Atlas gripped his hand in his and vice versa and the two started to arm wrestle. And where both were putting all of their strength into it and where it didn't seem to do anything to the other, but it did cause the box to crack and break apart. \"Are you sure that you're not strong as Hercules?\" Atticus asked. \"Yes, but for some reason, I suddenly had gotten stronger.\" Atlas told him. \"Hmm...\" Atticus hummed in thought. \"Could you skip ahead to when you got to the circus ground?\" Darla asked. \"Hearing you guys being bored on a train ride is kinda boring...\" \"Yeah...\" Amber actually agreed. \"Yeah, and Atticus, did you and Atlas become friends/brother figures?\" Patch asked his owner. \"Well, yes, we'll skip ahead to the circus grounds and as for the becoming friends/brother figures, you'll find out during the story.\" Atticus said. Patch frowned that he had to wait, but kept patient. The sun was starting to set as the train traveled down the train tracks. There was a small town as the clouds turned black and it started to rain. No matter though, the train stopped and they were at their new destination which meant it was time to advertise and get the circus ready. \"Sounds like we've arrived at our destination.\" Atticus said. Cherry yawned and stretched. Dumb poked his head out the window once he noticed that they had stopped, some rain dropped on him and he used his large ear as an umbrella. \"You better be ready to do some hard work.\" Atlas told him. \"I usually am...\" Atticus agreed. The circus workers got straight to work so they could be ready for their new crowd in this town. Atticus and Atlas began to carry out a huge tall pole that would be used to hold up the huge tent. The other animals kept sleeping their cages as Mrs. Jumbo and Dumbo went to help the circus workers set up. And where thanks to the weather, it wasn't easy for any of them. Dumbo wanted to help, he saw his mother helping, so he copied her moves the best that he could. From time to time Atticus and Atlas would have problems that needed the two of them to work together on. \"Together?\" Atticus asked. Atlast was hesitant at first, but he gave in. \"Together.\" They seemed have to work really well together and even used their combined strengths to get rid of a huge boulder that was for some reason there. The workers chanted as they did their part. Atticus and Atlas picked up the huge boulder and kicked out of the area and possibly out into deep space. Atticus and Atlas then high-fived each other and moved onto the next space. The other elephants came and did work as well. Oh, well, at least they weren't insulting Dumbo about his ears. Atticus made sure that the elephants didn't insult Dumbo about his ears while working together with Atlas. Dumbo kept wanting to help, but even though he was an elephant, he was till a baby and he was still too little to do anything. The bigger elephants just went to work as they set up. Atticus tied a little light around Dumbo's tail so the young one would feel useful and kept doing his part. Dumbo smiled up at him as a sign of thanks. Atticus smiled back, then went straight to work. He saw Atlas with two mallets one was for him and the other was for himself. They both then pounded poles to hold up the tent as the elephants helped them. Dumbo kept trying to help, being a baby, he just couldn't. With two strongmen or in this case one strongman and one strong boy it seemed to go much faster than anyone thought. Atticus panted at some points, but he did not quit. It felt like it took nearly forever, but the final tent went up as the rain was decreasing. It felt like all they did was grabbing ropes, hitching tents, and pounding hammers, which was what they did, but it was all worth it in the end. \"We're finally done putting it up.\" Atticus sighed, stumbling back. \"Whoa! You sure you've done hard work before?\" Atlas asked with a chuckle. \"Well, at least not hard work like that.\" Atticus chuckled. Cherry poked her head out. \"That looked exhausting...\" \"It sure was.\" Atticus and Atlas said in unison. \"Goodbye, old life, hello, Circus Brat...\" Cherry sighed. \"Don't worry, Cherry, maybe someday, we'll be back with your family.\" Atticus said. \"We're under contract...\" Cherry reminded him. \"I'm sure it won't be forever...\" Atticus soothed. Cherry yawned. \"I suppose so...\" \"You should get some sleep, it'll be a while until the parade starts.\" Atlas informed them. Cherry nodded, she then stopped and yawned with a small stretch. She saw Atticus fall asleep in Atlas's arms who for some reason didn't mind that and carried him inside for him to get plenty of rest before the parade. Everybody got as much sleep as they could get since there was an early morning start to draw in crowds. Before Atticus woke up, Atlas got the weights they would be using in their performance during the parade. The rain was clearing up and the people would be coming in any minute now. The ringmaster was making sure of this and he was thinking of the money he could make with both Atticus and Atlas in his circus. Cherry was sleeping by the animals, being their tamer and all. A few hours later, Atticus woke up to see Atlas outside ready. \"This is it, kid, your big circus debut.\" Atlas smiled to Atticus. Atticus yawned and stretched. \"Let the games begin.\" \"They will, but first, we'll need to get plenty of exercise before the parade starts.\" Atlas told him. Atticus nodded and warmed up with him. \"I'm ready.\" Atlas chuckled. \"I'm sure you are.\" The both of them began to exercise together so then they would be ready. Cherry woke up in her boxcar, then looked to the animals. \"Hey, gang...\" she weakly greeted after a yawn. \"Hello.\" The animals greeted. Cherry came over to check on them. \"Ready for the big day?\" \"We guess so...\" the gorilla said softly. \"We sure are.\" One of the lions replied with a yawn. \"It'll be okay,\" Cherry said softly. \"I know this is a big change, I know it is for me, but let's take it easy now.\" \"Agreed.\" A giraffe said. \"Okay, animals who are in the parade line, over here,\" Cherry organized, pointing in one direction. \"Other animals, get to your cages and carts over there that way.\" The animals began to go where the girl told them to go. \"That wasn't so hard...\" Cherry smiled. \"Indeed.\" The second lion nodded. Cherry went to see the elephants. \"Whoa, careful!\" a voice squeaked. Cherry looked around, then looked down to see a mouse on the ground. \"Oh, excuse me...\" she said apologetically to the mouse. \"It's okay, I get it a lot.\" The mouse shrugged. \"Haven't seen you before...\" Cherry said. \"I was just about to check the elephants.\" \"What are ya, some kind of tamer?\" the mouse asked. \"Animal tamer now,\" Cherry explained. \"You might wanna stay back, I hear elephants are scared of mice.\" \"Eh, I'll stay away from them, I'm just looking for some food.\" The mouse told her. \"Wish I could help ya... I gotta get going...\" Cherry said to the mouse, then went off. \"What a strange child... Aw, well...\" the mouse shrugged and continued to explore for food. Cherry came to the female elephants. \"You girls ready for the parade?\" \"We sure are.' Mrs. Jumbo smiled. \"Well, I know I am...\" the Matriarch sounded boastful. \"I'm so excited.\" Giddy smiled. Cherry nodded to them and walked off. \"Provided that little troublemaker with the big ears doesn't get in the way.\" Catty muttered. \"Oh, you're right, dear, he'd ruin the whole show.\" Prissy agreed. \"Quit bullying him or else you girls don't get peanuts while Mrs. Jumbo and her son do.\" Cherry warned them. \"Hmph!\" Catty huffed. \"How extremely unfair!\" Cherry rolled her eyes at that, then came to see little Dumbo, even though it was a crude nickname, she and Atticus had gone along with calling him it, but they always said it in a nice way so whenever the baby would hear that name, he wouldn't feel bad. \"You okay, little guy?\" she asked in a quiet and gentle tone of voice. Dumbo nodded with a smile. \"Hope you're ready, we're gonna have a lot of fun today, just you see.\" Cherry smiled. Dumbo smiled, taking her word for it and hoping that he really would have fun. Cherry smiled to Dumbo and went to see the other animals. Dumbo smiled to Cherry and followed her like a lost puppy without her knowing. Cherry began to have the feeling someone was following her and decided to look who was following her and saw who it was. Dumbo waved with his tiny trunk and large ears. \"Silly goose...\" Cherry snickered softly. She then brought Dumbo back over to his mother. Mrs. Jumbo was looking around as her fellow elephants were getting fitted for their outfits in the parade. She then saw Cherry coming with her baby. \"Oh, thank heavens!\" \"Sorry...\" Cherry said, bringing Dumbo back. \"Guess the little guy wanted to explore.\" \"Sweetheart, please trumpet the next time you want to explore.\" Mrs. Jumbo told her son. Dumbo silently nodded to his mother. Mrs. Jumbo smiled and patted him on the head with her own trunk. \"Oh, I love you so much...\" \"Mama.\" Dumbo smiled. Cherry went to the ringmaster. \"The animals are almost ready.\" \"Excellent, this is going to be a great show, I know it will be!\" the ringmaster grinned as he went over to his white horse. They saw Atticus and Atlas getting their part of the parade ready and were even having a fun time doing it. They learned to get along a lot better the more time they spent together. \"Okay, looks like we're ready on our part.\" Atticus smiled. \"Yep, just remember what I taught ya.\" Atlas agreed. \"I sure will.\" Atticus said before holding his right fist out to the strongman for a fist bump. Atlas happily fist bumped back.[Chapter 6] It was now time for the parade to start to help promote people into coming to visit to the circus. Cherry and Atticus got into their uniforms and followed to where they were supposed to go and gave waves to the people they passed. Zebras pulled a sleeping lion's cage as the band marched and played to entertain the crowd. A hippo pulled a very small organ and it also played a lively, but not very loud and flashy. It was suddenly loud and crazy as clowns came in and played their own music to win the kids over. Atticus and Atlas were doing feats of strength during the whole parade to show everyone what would be at the big top. The crowd seemed very drawn to both Atticus and Atlas. As they both began to break out of chains, they tied each other in along with bending the dumbbells into a loop and even around their own necks before straightening them out. The crowd was at awe and delight at that. The elephants were taking their walk, their trunks linked to their tails. Even Dumbo was along and had his own little float over his back, trying to keep up with his mother and the other elephants. But he had a problem with his ears as he tripped on one of them and fell into a mud puddle. \"Dumbo!\" Cherry gasped in worry. This made the people laugh at Dumbo's misfortune. Atlas was about to laugh as well, but for some reason, it didn't seem to seem funny to him as he began to feel his chest at the part where his heart was. He had developed feelings it had seemed! At least someone else was being supportive of the baby elephant now. \"I think somebody needs a bath...\" Cherry said to Dumbo since he was coated in mud now. \"I agree.\" Atticus and Atlas nodded. The parade continued on until it would be over so they could have people file into the big top. After the parade, Atticus, Cherry, and even Atlas were now helping Mrs. Jumbo with giving Dumbo a bath. \"Boy, you seem nice all of the sudden.\" Cherry chuckled to Atlas in a joking way. \"Yeah, I don't know why, but all of a sudden, I started to develop emotions.\" Atlas told her. \"Well, it's great that to know that you're not such a jerk anymore than from the first time we met.\" Atticus smiled at the strongman. \"I feel good now.\" Atlas agreed. Mrs. Jumbo sucked up some of the bath water in her trunk and sprayed it all over her baby. Dumbo was washed instantly from the digusting mud and he really loved the bath so far. The baby elephant even started to splash Atticus, Cherry, and Atlas who didn't seem to mind getting splashed by him and wasn't losing his temper at the baby animal. \"Heeeey!\" Cherry flinched from the splashes, but had a smile to show she wasn't truly annoyed. \"Heeeey!\" Atticus and Atlas flinched from the splashes, but had a smile to show they weren't truly annoyed either. Dumbo smiled, he really loved his bath. Mrs. Jumbo then took Dumbo out of the tub and put him back on the ground once he was all clean. Dumbo then shook himself dry like a dog to get the water off of himself. \"He sure seems to be having a lot of fun.\" Atlas smiled. Mrs. Jumbo and Dumbo then trumpeted to each other before playing a small game of Hide-And-Seek. Atticus smiled, though a little sadly, he never got to have an experience like that. \"Hey, kid, you okay?\" Atlas asked the boy out of worry. \"I-I'll be okay...\" Atticus said, then walked off. \"Excuse me...\" Atlas watched him go, then looked a little concerned. \"What's with him?\" Cherry sighed a little softly. \"Lost his parents a long time ago... We can't even find out who they are or who they might have been.\" \"It must be sad for him.\" Atlas frowned. \"Mm-hmm...\" Cherry slowly nodded. \"Well, I'd like to bring him into my family, but I haven't seen them in a while.\" Atlas said. \"Thanks for helping...\" Cherry shrugged. The ringmaster had let some visitors into the big top tent and a gaggle of kids rushed right over to meet the animals. \"Isn't that the funniest thing you ever saw?\" one boy laughed once he came with his friends to meet the elephants. \"Look at his ears!\" \"Is he seriously going to start?\" Atlas asked Cherry. \"I wish I had powers or something...\" Cherry snarled. The kid was making fun of Dumbo. Dumbo smiled, waving his trunk and his ears to be friendly. The kid laughed at him, then moved the sides of his shirts to tease the poor baby elephant. \"Hey, guys, look!\" one of the boy's friends laughed. \"Smitty's an elephant!\" Mrs. Jumbo decided that was enough, so she took her son away from these bullying human children, they were nothing like Cherry or Atticus. And where speaking of which, Atticus came back in to see what was going on. He gasped in shock and disgust when he saw the human kids kept teasing and bullying Dumbo. Smitty snuck up behind Mrs. Jumbo though and pulled Dumbo by his ears and started to blow in them. Atticus and now surprisingly Atlas were becoming angry with those kids. \"Stop that!\" Cherry scolded the kid who was tormenting Dumbo. \"I'm the animal tamer and I say you have to leave now!\" But unfortunately, the kids didn't listen to her. The kids kept bullying and harassing Dumbo. Mrs. Jumbo looked in horror, especially when the kids harmed her baby, she was both horrified and angry. Horrified for poor little Dumbo and angry with the children and wanted to teach them a lesson they would never forget. Atlas was the same and where he wouldn't be afraid of what he would do to the kids. The kids kept teasing and bullying poor little Dumbo, again for his ears. Mrs. Jumbo had enough, she showed a rare display of violence and even grabbed the one kid who picked on Dumbo the most and grabbed him by her trunk, put him over one of the ropes and gave him a firm spank on the bottom with her trunk. Atlas, Atticus, and Cherry began to play cards, not caring if those terrible kids got hurt. \"Pick a card...\" Cherry said like a magician as Mrs. Jumbo was going mama bear all over the horrible and rotten children. \"The middle one.\" Atticus said while pointing to the middle card. Cherry took out the middle card to show it was the three of clubs, then shuffled the deck. She then took out the eight of diamonds. \"Is that your card?\" \"No.\" Atticus and Atlas said. Cherry shuffled again and took out the queen of spades. \"Is that your card?\" Atticus and Atlas shook their heads. Cherry sighed, shuffling once more, then took out the two of hearts. \"Is that your card?\" Mrs. Jumbo was now scaring a lot of people due to her anger and frustration of how her baby was being treated by these horrible and awful humans. \"Yep, that's it.\" Atticus and Atlas smiled. \"Really?: Cherry asked, almost unbelievable, then shrugged. \"Erm... Ta-Da!\" Mrs. Jumbo screamed as the other animal trainers rushed to Mrs. Jumbo to restrain her. Cherry, Atticus, and Atlas turned to see that. \"Oh, no, stop!\" Cherry ran over. \"What are you jerks doing?!\" Atticus and Atlas asked as they helped stop the other animal trainers. \"This elephant has gone haywire, you kids stand back!\" one trainer glared as he tried to hold down Mrs. Jumbo. \"No, you can't do this!\" Cherry glared. The animal trainers ignored her and held down Mrs. Jumbo. The ringmaster told them to since Mrs. Jumbo's explosion was making customers flee away in terror. \"This is unfair.\" Atticus said. Mrs. Jumbo even knocked the ringmaster into the bath tub, which made him even more flustered. Dumbo wanted to go to his mother, but no one would let him. It was just a heartbreaking sight to see parent split up from child. \"She wouldn't have gone on a rampage if those brats hadn't started to torment Dumbo,\" Atlas told the ringmaster after he dried off. \"And by those brats, I'm talking about some of the costumers.\" \"She's a mad elephant and needs to be locked up!\" the ringmaster was too angry for discussion. \"She is locked up tonight and won't be let out until she learns her lesson!\" \"She was defending her baby!\" Atticus glared. \"You shouldn't separate a parent for doing their job!\" Cherry was very angry too. \"I'm sorry, but the topic is not open for discussion...\" the ringmaster sneered at them and stormed off to his private tent. \"I truly hate that man.\" Atlas glared. \"I'm sure he'll get his just desserts in the end...\" Cherry glared. Amber was now crying. Oh, poor Dumbo!\" she sniffled. \"That must've been so horrible...\" \"Trust us, it was...\" Cherry said in a soft tone. Darla took out a hanky, patting her eyes as she even cried and blew her nose noisily. Patch began to nuzzle Darla to comfort her. Darla looked down and smiled halfway, putting her arm around the Dalmatian puppy. Cherry and Atticus decided to give Darla, Amber, and Patch a minute before continuing the story.[Chapter 7] After about a minute or two; Darla, Amber, and Patch were ready for Atticus and Cherry to continue the story. \"Okay...\" Darla cleared her throat. \"We're better...\" \"Still, that must've been so awful...\" Amber frowned. \"I don't know what I'd do if someone took MY parents away from me.\" \"Well, it was really hard on Dumbo.\" Atticus said. \"We can imagine...\" Darla said as she hugged her knees. \"What did the other elephants do?\" \"Gossip...\" Cherry rolled her eyes. \"Should have known.\" Patch groaned. Mrs. Jumbo was locked up later that night. She was chained down and all she could do was cry since she was labeled as a mad elephant and she wouldn't be anywhere near her child. All Dumbo could do himself was cry miserably since he was without his mother and the other elephants just gossiped about it and thought Mrs. Jumbo got what she deserved. Atticus, Cherry, and Atlas were now coming over to Dumbo to comfort him. Dumbo sniffled as tears rolled down his baby blue eyes. \"I hope karma gets them...\" Cherry glared at the gossipy female elephants, but frowned lightly and patted the baby elephant on the head. \"It's okay, son, she won't be locked up forever...\" \"That's right, she'll be free soon.\" Atticus agreed. Cherry then remembered the mouse she met. She started to look around for him. \"Here, mousey, mousey, mousey... Here, mouse!\" \"Hey, kid...\" the mouse was there, he had found a peanut and was trying to crack it open. \"There you are!\" Cherry said to him. \"Um... I need a favor...\" \"Sure what can I do ya for?\" The mouse asked before opening up the peanut. \"See those elephants?\" Cherry pointed back at the gossiping elephants who mocked Mrs. Jumbo and poor Dumbo once more. The mouse looked over and nodded. \"I never liked 'em... Gab, gab, gab... Always gossipin'...\" \"I know, they need to be taught a lesson...\" Cherry knelt in front of the mouse. \"I think you can help.\" \"I think so too.\" The mouse said. Cherry saw him struggling with the peanut, so she helped him out and handed it back to the mouse. \"Thanks, kid.\" the mouse smiled. \"Sure.\" Cherry smirked back. \"So, is your little friend going to help us?\" Atticus and Atlas asked. \"Okay... Your time to shine...\" Cherry cupped the mouse in her hands as she snuck by the elephants who were grouped together. The mouse seemed to give her a thumb's up. \"Okay, just get ready to back up so you don't get squashed.\" Cherry then put the mouse down in the piles of hay that the elephants were eating and she ran back over to Atticus and Atlas. \"This should be entertaining.\" Atlas said. \"Who's the mouse?\" Atticus asked. Cherry was about to say, then looked puzzled. \"I dunno... I never asked...\" \"Well, I guess we should find out his name afterwards.\" Atticus said. The elephants gossiped, then noticed a disturbance. \" MOUSE! \" The elephants then screamed and ran away like cowards as the mouse decided to torment them for making fun of Dumbo and Mrs. Jumbo. \"Oh, yeah, this is very entertaining.\" Atlas smiled. The elephants were so scared, then even climbed up a few tent poles and screamed. The mouse then made silly faces which made them even more scared. He then made it look like he was leaving. The elephants saw this and slowly came down back to the ground. The mouse sensed them coming down, so he turned around again, facing them. \"BOO!\" This made them even more scared and decided to stay where they were. The mouse chuckled and then came back over to Cherry. \"Good enough for ya?\" \"Totally.\" Cherry smirked, picking up the mouse in the palm of her left hand. \"Oh, wait 'til I tell the little guy.\" the mouse chuckled, then looked around for Dumbo. \"Huh, where'd he go?\" Atlas asked as he saw that Dumbo wasn't where he was before. \"Dumbo, you can come out now!\" Atticus called. \"Oh, maybe I scared him too...\" the mouse guessed. Cherry looked around, then saw a tiny gray trunk popping out from a pile of hay. \"I think I found him.\" \"Yep, I recognize that trunk anywhere.\" Atlas smiled. \"Look, Dumbo, I'm your friend,\" the mouse tried to soothe the baby elephant as he hid away in the hay. \"Come on out, will you?\" Dumbo shook in the hay, not coming out. \"You're really not afraid of little old me, are ya?\" the mouse asked. Dumbo shook in the hay up and down to show he was nodding his head in agreement. \"You are?\" the mouse sounded hurt. \"Must've overdid... Don't know my own strength sometimes.\" \"Try using a peanut.\" Atticus whispered to the mouse. \"Hmm... Good idea...\" the mouse agreed, he then took off his hat to show another peanut and held it in his gloved paws. \"Oh, Dumbo~? Look at what I got for ya...\" Dumbo's trunk came out of the hay, trying to get the peanut. \"Ah-Ah-Ah!\" the mouse took it out of his way. \"Ya gotta come out first!\" Dumbo inhaled the peanut through the hay and ate it once he got it. \"Well, that just happened.\" Cherry muttered. \"What else could work?\" Atticus asked. \"I think he really misses his mommy...\" Cherry suggested. This gave the mouse an idea. \"Too bad you don't trust me, 'cuz I thought that, uh, well, maybe, you and me, we might get your mother out of the clink...\" Dumbo poked his head out of the hay for a brief moment. \"But, I guess you wouldn't be interested... So long, Dumbo...\" the mouse then started to walk off while whistling a tune to himself. Dumbo fully came out of the hay and picked up the mouse by his tail to keep him from leaving. \"Looks like he's interested now.\" Atticus smirked. \"That's more like it,\" the mouse smiled. \"You know, your ma ain't crazy, she just got broken-hearted... I mean, it's not your fault you got them big ears.\" This made Dumbo hide his face with his ears. \"Way to go, little guy.\" Atticus said sarcastically towards the mouse. \"Oops...\" the mouse felt dumb now. \"Aw, gee, Dumbo, I think your ears are beautiful!\" Dumbo poked his face out then in curiosity. \"Sure!\" the mouse encouraged. \"As a matter of fact I think they're very decorative. You know, lots of people with big ears are famous.\" \"Yeah.\" Atlas smiled. \"We could make you a star with your wonderful ears!\" Cherry encouraged. \"Yeah,\" Atticus smiled. \"Oh, right, what's your name mouse?\" \"The name is Timothy Q. Mouse, at your service.\" the mouse introduced, removing his hat and giving a bow. \"Nice to meet ya.\" Atticus smiled. \"Nice to meet you all too,\" Timothy smiled. \"You're the most unique and helpful humans I've ever met.\" \"Well, one of my neighbors has a mouse in her house, but he seems nice...\" Cherry smiled. \"Maybe you know him, his name is Jerry?\" \"Oh, you mean my cousin.\" Timothy smiled. \"Jerry's your cousin?\" Atticus asked. \"Oh, yeah, we go way back,\" Timothy chuckled. \"Haven't seen him in a while... He lives in your neighbor's house?\" \"She doesn't seem to mind, though her cat doesn't seem to like him very much.\" Cherry replied. \"That makes sense.\" Timothy shrugged. Dumbo was curious what it would be like to be a star in the circus. \"All we gotta do is build up an act,\" Timothy said to the baby elephant, standing on the end of his trunk. \"Make ya a star! A headliner! Dumbo the GREAT!\" \"Um, the great of what?\" Atticus asked. Everybody suddenly got down in despair. \"Hmm...\" Cherry scratched her head in thought. \"What could work?\" \"Hmm, maybe he could be part of our act.\" Atlas said. \"Something like that...\" Atticus agreed. \"But what...?\" \"Maybe the ringmaster could have a suggestion?\" Cherry shrugged. Timothy scoffed. \"He's never had an idea in his life!\" But then they saw a light coming from the Ringmaster's tent and then they saw him talking to someone. Cherry, Atticus, Atlas, Dumbo, and Timothy decided to, even though it was wrong, eavesdrop. \"Have I got an idea, what an idea...\" the ringmaster said as he was talking with someone who was in the tent with him. \"Just visualize... One elephant climbs up on top of another elephant, until finally all seven elephants have constructed an enormous pyramid of pachyderms! I step out, I blow the whistle, the trumpets are trumpeting, AND NOW… COMES THE CLIMAX! \" \"Uh, what is the climax, boss?\" The figure asked him, sounding like an idiot. The ringmaster chuckled, but then sounded doubtful once he spoke again. \"I don't know...\" Cherry slid her glasses off and rubbed her eyes wearily. \"I knew he never had nuthin'.\" Timothy scoffed. \"Oh, well, maybe it'll come to me in a dream.\" The ringmaster yawned. The lights were then turned off. \"Good night, Joe.\" the ringmaster said, going to sleep for the night. \"Good night, Boss.\" the worker replied. \"Climax...\" Timothy tried to come up with an idea based on what the ringmaster was saying. \"CLIMAX! Dumbo, you're a climax!\" \"Yep, that means a big finish.\" Atticus smiled. \"How do we tell the boss though?\" Atlas asked. \"Leave that to me.\" Timothy volunteered. \"You got it, little dude.\" Atlas said. Timothy then went off to the ringmaster's tent. \"You think this'll work?\" Cherry asked. \"Yes, yes, I do.\" Atticus nodded. Dumbo was curious and bewildered. Cherry gently patted the baby elephant's head to soothe him. \"It's okay, buddy, it's okay...\" \"Yeah, everything's going to work out just fine.\" Atlas smiled assuring the baby elephant. \"A-A-Atlas, A-Atticus, C-Cherry,\" Dumbo smiled. \" T-Timothy, friends.\" \"Did you say something?\" Cherry looked back at Dumbo. \"Did he speak?\" Atticus asked. \"I-I think he did...\" Cherry was unsure. \"Did you just talk, little guy?\" Atlas asked the baby elephant. \"Maybe we're hearing things...\" Cherry shrugged. Dumbo smiled as he came to Atlas, Cherry, and Atticus. \"Friends.\" Dumbo smiled. \"He did talk!\" Atticus heard it then. \"Dumbo, you can talk!\" Cherry smiled to the baby elephant. \"Uh-huh.\" Dumbo nodded with a smile. Cherry hugged the baby elephant with a small smirk. Atticus then shook Dumbo's trunk with his hand in a friendly gesture.[Chapter 8] \"I don't get it, if he could talk, how come he didn't before?\" Darla asked. \"It's because he was beginning to learn every word that everyone around him said.\" Atticus told them. \"Remember, Dumbo was a baby.\" Cherry reminded. \"Oh... I guess that makes sense...\" Darla shrugged innocently. \"So what happened next?\" Amber asked. \"Well, the ringmaster decided to try out the Pachyderm Pyramid that Tmothy told him about, though with Dumbo as the climax the night before...\" Cherry explained. \"It didn't go as well as planned... You won't believe how hard it was to train those elephants into doing it.\" \"What, did they stand on top of at the bottom?\" Patch asked. \"Let's just find out, shall we?\" Cherry replied. The next day at the circus, the ringmaster arranged the plan to win crowds after the 'mad elephant' scare. \"This plan is fool proof.\" Atticus smiled. \"Sounds kinda strange if you ask me...\" Cherry shrugged. \"Let's just hope this doesn't end in disaster.\" Atlas said. \"You say that and then it does...\" Cherry mumbled, she then went to gather the elephants together. \"Prissy!\" \"Here!\" Prissy waved her trunk. \"Catty?\" Cherry called. \"Here!\" Catty called back. \"Giddy?\" Cherry looked around. \"Giddy? ...Giddy!\" Suddenly she was blown from water and the water pushed her onto the ground. Giddy giggled at that. \"She's here.\" Atticus and Atlas said. Cherry coughed up the water and wrung her hair. \"Note to self: Find a way to get away with elephant murder.\" \"We'll try to remind you.\" Atticus said. Cherry then dried herself off and sorted out the elephants for the ringmaster. And where hopefully, this all would all go according to plan. Cherry was just sure this was going to have a major downfall, but she did as she was told. The ringmaster was eager to see how much money he could make off of this. And where he was now making a whole lot of money out of this. Once everything was arranged, the ringmaster opened up the circus and the audience came, very anxious and eager to see this 'Pachyderm Pyramid' up close for themselves. And where this act would be a performance none of them would ever forget. The ringmaster introduced the act to the public which annoyed the elephants and they wanted him to get on with it. \"To here him talk, you'd think he was going to do it.\" Catty scoffed. \"The stuffed shirt.\" the Matriarch agreed with a snort. \"I give you... The elephants!\" the ringmaster finished his introduction and bowed to the crowd. \"And to help them perform this act shall be our two strongmen; Atlas and Atticus!\" he then added. \"Oh, boy...\" Cherry sensed disaster. The ringmaster blew his whistle and summoned the elephants with his strongmen. Cherry pointed and signaled the elephants to get into their positions. And where the elephants each went to their positions and had a little help with the strongmen. \"Aren't we a bit clumsy?\" the Matriarch grumbled to one of her fellow elephants. Catty was coming next with Atticus and Atlas's help. \"Gaining a little weight, aren't you, honey?\" she said through straining and struggling. \"You're no cream puff yourself, deary.\" Giddy retorted. \"Will you girls just shut up and stay focused?\" Atticus whispered to the elephants. \"He's right,\" the Matriach firmly agreed. \"Quiet up there, tend to your work, girls.\" Catty got on top of the other elephant with Atlas's help and she reached out for Prissy. Prissy struggled as she was on top of the Matriarch who was very angered with her and called her a clumsy ox. 'Okay, next elephant.' Atticus thought to himself. Catty and Prissy were having trouble which made the Matriarch rather nervous. Atticus and Atlas were there to make sure none of them fell over. Timothy was hiding and secretly watching, he was relieved that no one was hurt so far. \"Whew, that was close.\" Atlas sighed quietly. \"I just know I'm going to get hurt during this...\" Cherry moaned. \"No, you won't.\" Atticus whispered to her. \"I can taste the pain already...\" Cherry rolled her eyes. The ringmaster grinned as the audience was in awe and anticipation of the elephant pyramid. Atticus and Atlas helped the best that they could, but the elephants look rather suffering through this painful process that was very painful to them. \"I'd hate to be in their situation.\" Atticus whispered. \"You and me both, kid.\" Atlas agreed. Cherry went to the back of the tent and came to see Timothy and Dumbo who had a tiny flag in his trunk to wave to the crowd. \"Hey, Timothy, is Dumbo ready yet?\" Cherry whispered. \"Just about, got your flag?\" Timothy asked the baby elephant. Dumbo waved his flag in response. \"This is it,\" Cherry smiled encouragingly to the baby elephant. \"I'm so proud of you and don't listen to what anybody says about you or your ears, you are special and independent.\" \"What's 'independent'?\" Dumbo asked. \"You believe in you and only you, no matter what anyone else thinks.\" Cherry explained. \"Ohh, okay.\" Dumbo said. \"Let's do a test run before the real thing.\" Timothy said. Dumbo nodded to his mouse friend and did a test run while the female adult elephants were joining together to form the pyramid. And where it would have gone great if Dumbo hadn't tripped over his ears. Cherry smiled encouragingly, then winced at the plummet. \"That was... Better...?\" she then grinned nervously. \"Almost ready now, Dumbo,\" Timothy told his friend. \"Don't forget to wave the flag.\" Dumbo smiled and waved his flag. \"Okay, okay, don't wave no more, I saw ya.\" Timothy stopped him. \"Hmm...\" Cherry lifted one of Dumbo's ears. \"You got an idea?\" Timothy asked. \"Maybe we should tie his ears up...\" Cherry suggested. \"Yeah, that'll work.\" Timothy smiled. \"Let's see... How does it go again...?\" Cherry tried to think as she held Dumbo's ears in her hands, attempting to tie them like a pair of tennis shoes. The ringmaster was making another announcement about the female elephants, about to introduce Dumbo while Cherry and Timothy tied his ears. \"That windbag,\" the Matriach grunted as the ringmaster went on, and on, and on... \"Why doesn't he come to the point!?\" \"I agree with you on this one.\" Atticus and Atlas whispered. The Matriarch still struggled, but she had a small smug smirk before it disappeared that the strongmen agreed with her. 'Hurry up already, bag of winds.' Atticus thought to himself, referring to the ringmaster. The audience wasn't annoyed like they were, but anxious to hear what the ringmaster had to say about the climax for the Pachyderm Pyramid. \"And now, I present the world's smallest elephant!\" the ringmaster eventually reached the point. \"Who will spring from this springboard in one spring, on top of the pyramid, waving his little flag for the climax, ladies and gentlemen... I give you... Dumbo!\" The curtains opened up to show the baby elephant with his ears tied over his head so he wouldn't trip anymore. But there was one thing Atticus, Atlas, Cherry, and Timothy didn't count on, Dumbo was scared and nervous. \"Dumbo, that's your cue!\" Cherry whispered loudly. \"Come on, Dumbo!\" \"Get going, what's wrong with you!?\" Timothy added. \"What's that elephant doin'?\" Atlas demanded. \"I hate to do this...\" Timothy whispered as he took out a sharp nail and let it poke Dumbo on his behind to make him move. Dumbo ran instantly from the impact as a drum rolled for him. \"Are his ears tied together?\" Atticus asked, noticing it. Cherry and Timothy watched as Dumbo ran with all his might. Unfortunately, Dumbo's ears were coming loose and he tripped over them again and he started to fly in the air towards the adult female elephants. Dumbo had crashed into the ball that the Matriarch was balancing herself with and the pyramid was starting to tumble down and fall flat on the ground. 'Oh, no, this doesn't look good.' Atticus thought to himself. The elephants were out of control and they were all about to fall on top of each other. The audience grew horrified, even more than when they thought Mrs. Jumbo was a mad elephant. \" OUT OF MY WAY, ASSASSIN! \" the Matriarch glared to Dumbo, blaming him for this accident. Atlas began to get Atticus out of the tent with Cherry and Timothy following. The elephants were now all tumbling down, this had to be the worst day of the circus coming to town. The elephants were badly injured from the collision. \"Ooh, that's gotta hurt.\" Atticus winced while running. The tent was collapsing and the audience had fled away in sheer terror. Dumbo poked his trunk out, waving his now broken flag, he was not hurt, thankfully enough. \"Whew, at least Dumbo didn't get hurt.\" Atticus sighed out of relief. \"We can never show our faces in this town again...\" the ringmaster said. \"We should change Dumbo's act.\" \"What do you have in mind, sir?\" Cherry asked. \"The only one who can make a career out of making huge mistakes and teach him a lesson through humility,\" the ringmaster said. \"A clown.\" \"What?!\" Atlas, Atticus, and Cherry asked out of shock. \"That'll teach him for wrecking the show.\" the ringmaster said. \"It's not his fault!\" Cherry said. \"Go take care of the animals,\" the ringmaster handed her a first aid kit. \"The elephant will be clown and that is final!\" Cherry and Atticus then looked to each other glumly.[Chapter 9] \"A CLOWN !?\" Darla, Amber, and Patch asked. \"Unfortunately, yes.\" Atticus said. Cherry put her hands to her eyes and shook her head. \"That man sounded like he was heartless.\" Amber said. \"Please tell me he gets what he deserves in the end.\" Darla added. \"Oh, he does...\" Cherry said before feeling herself smile as she covered her mouth and felt a laugh coming on as she remembered what happened at the end of her and Atticus's circus adventure. \"So, what happened next?\" Patch asked. \"Public humiliation...\" Cherry face-palmed. Cherry had tended to to the elephants' wounds and gave them bandages and ice from the injuries they received from Dumbo's little mistake. \"Look you guys, it was an accident, so stop blaming Dumbo, he's only a baby!\" \"It's still all his fault, he should have watched where he was going.\" The Matriarch told her. \"He didn't mean it!\" Cherry glared. \" I'D JUST LIKE TO SPANK THE DAYLIGHTS OUT OF HIM! \" the Matriach threatened before wincing in sudden pain. \"Oh, that won't be necessary, deary,\" Catty commented. \"They fixed him good.\" \"What do you mean?\" Giddy asked. \"What did they do?\" Prissy asked. \"Did they beat him?\" \"What is it, darling?\" Catty asked. \"Tell us!\" \"Come on, come on, I demand to know!\" the Matriarch demanded. \"Well, they've gone and made him...\" Catty sounded horrified. \"Dear, I can't say it.\" \"What?\" Cherry asked. \"What's wrong?\" Catty looked to her, then her fellow elephants. \"A clown.\" she finally told them. This shocked the elephants very dearly. \"A clown?\" Giddy asked. \"No.\" Prissy didn't believe it. \"Yes.\" Catty reassured. \"Oh, the shame of it all,\" the Matriarch said before raising her trunk with her fellow elephants. \"Let us take a solemn vow. From now on: He is no longer an elephant...\" All of her fellow elephants agreed to this, finding Dumbo's reputation he had for now, disgraceful. Cherry fluttered her lips, unsure of what to do or say to that. \"Why don't you go and join your friends?\" Catty said to Cherry. \"Get out of here.\" the Matriarch rudely added. \"Gladly...\" Cherry left the elephants, taking the first aid kit with her. \"What is with that girl?\" Giddy asked. The Matriarch snorted in disgust. \"Humans... They're so unpredictable and such drama queens.\" \"Agreed.\" Prissy said. Cherry put the first aid kit away. \"How are the elephants?\" Atticus asked. \"Despite being royal pains in the behind, they're doing fine right now.\" Cherry grumbled. \"Great.\" Atticus groaned. \"Yeah, my heart goes out to them...\" Cherry rolled her eyes. \"That's good to know.\" Atticus said. \"Yeah, yeah...\" Cherry muttered. \"Anyways, I better get back to Atlas.\" Atticus said. \"Poor Dumbo...\" Cherry cooed once she saw the baby elephant. \"This is going to be so humiliating.\" \"Sure is.\" Atticus frowned before leaving to get back to Atlas. Cherry sighed. \"You all right, kiddo?\" Atlas asked Atticus once he was getting himself set for bed. \"I'm just sad that Dumbo will be performing with clowns now.\" Atticus frowned. \"Could be worse, I guess...\" Atlas shrugged. \"How could it be worse?\" Atticus asked. \"I dunno... I'm trying...\" Atlas frowned himself. \"Well, let's just hope that nothing worse happens.\" Atticus said. \"Amen to that.\" Atlas agreed. Everybody went to bed for the night. The next day, Cherry was checking on the elephants and after she gave them their medicine for the day, she came to Dumbo and put clown make-up on him and tried to be quick. \"Oh, I hope those clowns don't come over here...\" Cherry whispered, feeling uncomfortable about doing this. \"I hope so too.\" Dumbo frowned. Cherry cooed to him as she applied the make-up. \"What exactly is going to happen?\" Dumbo asked. \"You're going to be a baby stuck in a burning building and the clowns are going to put the fire out and save you in the most hilarious way possible,\" Cherry explained. \"I don't think it's funny though, I never found clowns funny...\" \"It can't be that bad.\" Dumbo said. \"If you feel bad today, I am so sorry, but it's the ringmaster's orders...\" Cherry soothed. \"I don't like him.\" Dumbo said. \"Nobody does...\" Cherry said, taking off her glasses and made her eyes cross. Dumbo looked to that, he then lightly giggled and laughed, he thought Cherry looked funny that way. \"There's a smile.\" Cherry smirked, putting her glasses back on and blinked to put her eyes back in palce. \"How did you do that?\" Dumbo asked. \"I have a lazy eye,\" Cherry took off her glasses and pointed to her left eye. \"Watch closely...\" Dumbo squinted his eyes to take a closer look. Cherry's left eye then started to look around other ways while her right eye was focusing in one position. \"Cool.\" Dumbo smiled. \"Yeah...\" Cherry put her glasses back on and blinked a few times. \"Phew!\" \"Is that hard?\" Dumbo asked. \"It's just a deformity I have,\" Cherry explained. \"My eye can't help it, but my glasses help keep my eyes straightened out.\" \"Cool.\" Dumbo smiled. \"Yeah, I guess...\" Cherry said, then gently blew against his face so the make-up and paint could dry quicker. Dumbo flinched a little, but allowed Cherry to do her work. \"Are you finished yet?\" Dumbo asked. \"Almost, we just have to let you dry first.\" Cherry promised, then kept blowing. Soon, the make-up was dry and Cherry tested it. \"Okay, you're ready.\" Cherry then told the baby elephant. \"Thank you.\" Dumbo smiled. Cherry sighed sharply. \"Good luck out there...\" she then patted Dumbo on the head and took her leave. Dumbo had a bad feeling about this, he did not fully understand what was going to happen to him, but based on Cherry's reaction, it could not have been a good thing. There was time for a new show and a new spot and this time it was Dumbo's debut as a clown. \"Please, Mr. Fireman, save my poor baby!\" a clown who wore a mother elephant mask was running around like a wuss as Dumbo was in a fake burning building and at the top floor. \"This is embarrassing.\" Dumbo whispered. A firetruck drove on stage and a bunch of clowns ran out and making the scenario funny and goofy for the crowd. \"Ugh...\" Cherry was disgusted by the clowns. \"I... Hate... CLOWNS...\" \"I'm hating these clowns.\" Atticus growled. \"Same here.\" Atlas added in. Dumbo watched as the clowns used the buckets of water to splash each other while he was sweating from the heat and flames. \"I'm not sure how this works, but I know they're doing it wrong!\" he groaned. And where he was right. The clowns then splashed the water in Dumbo's face and one clown used the water to grow a plant. The audience laughed, but Cherry, Atticus, and Atlas refused to see the humor. \"These guys are annoying.\" Atticus said. One clown then poured water into the elephant mask which made the other clown struggle. \"Okay, that was funny.\" Atlas chuckled to that. One clown roasted sausage over the fire, another clown put out the fire, only to make it bigger, then realized that he used gas and not water, and more clowns with a trampoline and encouraged Dumbo to jump down. \"Oh, no, I think I know what their finale is.\" Atticus said with widened eyes. \"Same here, little brother.\" Atlas agreed nervously. Dumbo was very nervous about jumping down, but he had no choice, a clown hit him with a bat and made him fly down to the trampoline and when he landed, he landed through the trampoline and ended up covered in cream pie which made the audiecne roar with laughter. \"I was afraid of that.\" Atticus and Atlas winced. The ringmaster called for an intermission. \"Oh, poor Dumbo...\" Cherry sighed. \"Yeah.\" Atticus and Atlas added. The ringmaster laughed as he was given a lot of money from the crowd. \"I swear, all he cares about is money!\" Atlas sneered. \"I never noticed this before.\" \"Maybe he'll allow us to let Dumbo visit his mother.\" Atticus said. \"That feels unlikely...\" Atlas said, though he agreed, Dumbo must be missing his mother like crazy now.[Chapter 10] After the show, the clowns were going in the back to wash off their make-up and have an evening drink together. Atticus, Cherry, and Atlas then went into the ringmaster's tent to talk to him about Dumbo visiting his mother. The ringmaster grinned as he counted his money. Dumbo was too humiliated and upset to go with them, besides, if they could, it would be a nice surprise. \"Excuse us, sir?\" Cherry spoke up. \"What is it?\" the ringmaster nearly growled as he was interrupted during his favorite pastime. \"Since Dumbo has made you so much money, could you maybe allow him to go and visit his mother?\" Atticus asked. \"Hmm...\" the ringmaster thought about it. \"Which one's his mother?\" \"Mrs. Jumbo.\" Cherry said. \"Sorry, I've never been good with names...\" the ringmaster said then. Atlas rolled his eyes, he hoped Cherry and Atticus would forgive him for referring to the mother elephant as this, but it was the only way for their boss to understand. \"The 'Mad Elephant'.\" \"Ohh, well, if she can control herself during the visit, he can see her.\" The ringmaster said. \"I'm almost certain she will, sir...\" Atlas said with a cocky smile and rolling his eyes when his boss wasn't looking. They then left the tent to go tell Dumbo the good news. Timothy was washing off the make-up from Dumbo's face as the clowns were laughing and getting drunk. The mouse tried to convince the baby elephant that this was a good thing, even if it sounded like crude bullying to poor Dumbo who was so far spending his whole life being made fun of and his mother wasn't even there to comfort or support him. Atticus, Cherry, and Atlas then appeared just as Dumbo was being cleaned. \"See? They're drinkin' a toast to ya!\" Timothy encouraged the baby elephant. \"Yeah, you're a big hit! You're terrific!\" Dumbo sniffled and started to cry. \"Then why don't I feel so great?\" he then sobbed. \"Alley-oop,\" Timothy signaled. \"I gotta wash behind your ears.\" Dumbo sighed and lifted the mouse to so he could wash behind his large ears. \"You're a success.\" Timothy encouraged. \"We should tell him now.\" Atlas whispered. Atticus and Cherry nodded, going for the baby elephant. Timothy kept trying to cheer up Dumbo, but nothing would work. \"Hey, Dumbo, we have good news.\" Atticus smiled. \"Hmm...?\" Dumbo asked as he felt extremely upset, not even his best friends could cheer him up. \"Ya guys doin' what I think you're doin'?\" Timothy asked eagerly, feeling like he knew where this was going. \"Yep, we got permission from the ringmaster and he's allowed Dumbo to see his mother.\" Atticus smiled. \"Oh, that's great!\" Timothy cheered himself. With that, they went to the wrongful placement of Mrs. Jumbo as she was chained down and looked more miserable than Dumbo did without him than he did without her. No parent should ever be separated from their child. Especially a mother and a baby. \"I promise you Dumbo, she won't be in that cage for long.\" Atlas assured the baby elephant. Dumbo sighed sadly, but he had a small smile in hopes of seeing his mother again. \"Mrs. Jumbo...?\" Timothy called. \"I hope she's in...\" \"It's us, Mrs. Jumbo.\" Cherry added. \"Hey, Mrs. Jumbo, you awake?\" Atticus asked. \"We have someone here to see you.\" Atlas helped. Mrs. Jumbo was in fact inside, but she was having trouble coming out. She saw her baby's trunk and she waned to embrace him right there and right now, but couldn't. \"I'm sorry, dears... I-I'm afraid I'm stuck...\" she said, miserably and unfortunately. \"Can you stretch your trunk out to feel him?\" Atticus asked. \"I'm sorry, but that's all I can do...\" Mrs. Jumbo expanded her trunk and waved to them. \"It's better than nothing.\" Cherry agreed. Dumbo touched his mother's trunk, feeling very glad to have his mother's warmth again. Atticus helped the baby elephant up to the window of the cage. Mrs. Jumbo touched Dumbo with her trunk, filling the empty void they both have had for a long time now. Blast that ringmaster... Dumbo sniffled and started to cry, having missed his mother for oh-so long. Mrs. Jumbo, being a mother, could sense this, she then started to sing a lullaby to soothe his tears from separation anxiety. Atticus let go of the baby elephant as soon as Mrs. Jumbo got a hold on her baby and started to cradle him. Mrs. Jumbo sang 'Baby Mine' as she gently rocked Dumbo in her trunk. \"Th-That song...\" Atticus whispered. \"I... I feel like I know it from somewhere...\" He began to have a flashback, seeing his own mother having to sing that very same song. He could not make out the face, but he could see what appeared to be golden blonde hair. And where her voice seemed so familiar to him that tears started to form in his eyes. He shook his head and put his hands to his eyes as tears leaked out, missing his mother very much right now. Timothy softly sighed and some tears escaped his eyes as well. Atlas began to comfort Atticus as he saw the boy start to tear up. Atticus hugged Atlas as he sniffled as he thought about his mother. \"What happened to her?\" Atlas asked, assuming Atticus was crying because he thought of his mother from Mrs. Jumbo's lullaby. \"I-I don't know, I never even got to meet her or my father or sister/brother.\" Atticus sniffled. \"Sister/Brother?\" Atlas asked, confused. \"I'm sure I had an older sibling, I can't remember for sure though, but I'm positive...\" Atticus explained. \"I just remember someone older than me, though around the age of a kid who usually told me stories...\" \"Oh, I'm sorry, buddy...\" Atlas gave Atticus a hug. \"I'm sure I'll be reunited with them someday.\" Atticus hugged him back. \"I hope you do, buddy.\" Atlas comforted. Cherry had a smile on her face, but she was not happy or laughing, she was covering her eyes. \"Uh, is she okay?\" Atlas asked, confused of the sad moment and Cherry was smiling about it. \"I think so.\" Atticus said. \"What's so funny?\" Atlas said. Cherry shook her head. \"Uhh...?\" Atlas asked. \"Cherry, are you crying...?\" Atticus asked. \"Don't look at me!\" Cherry whined as her voice sounded cracked, that was a clear sign of sadness. \"She must miss her mother.\" Atlas said. \"Probably both her parents,\" Atticus guessed. \"They're pretty good parents.\" \"So, you live with them?\" Atlas asked. \"Cherry suggested it,\" Atticus explained. \"After we found Cherry's parents, she asked them if I could stay with them since I'd have nowhere else to go.\" \"That was nice of them.\" Atlas smiled. \"Yeah...\" Atticus said softly. Timothy looked around the area, he could see other mother animals with their babies. A zebra and her foal were nuzzled together in warmth and comfort, a giraffe mother lay her head against the hay as her calf lay against her, tiger cubs huddled to their mother, a monkey swung with her babies in hold, a hippo and her baby were under the water together, three ostriches slept with their heads in the ground, a kangaroo rocked back and forth with her joey comfortably in her pouch. \"Well, it's getting late, we should all get back.\" Atlas whispered. \"Yeah, it is quite late.\" Timothy agreed. Dumbo smiled as he rocked in his mother's trunk, too engrossed by her to notice anything else around him. \"Excuse me, I know you're enjoying this moment together, but it's getting rather late.\" Cherry said. \"O-Oh..\" Dumbo felt hurt that this moment had to end so soon. Cherry gently picked up Dumbo and set him on the ground so they could go. Timothy took Dumbo by his tail so they could go on which had Dumbo and Mrs. Jumbo's trunks unlink from each other. \"You'll be out of there soon.\" Atlas assured the mother elephant. \"I certainly hope so...\" Mrs. Jumbo sounded suffering, but she waved her trunk as her son was going away. Dumbo began to do the same thing.[Chapter 11] During the walk back to the other side of the circus, Atticus fell asleep in Atlas's arms. Atlas smiled to Atticus. \"He's a little cute when he's asleep...\" \"I'll take care of Dumbo and Timothy, you put Atticus to bed.\" Cherry suggested. \"Deal.\" Atlas nodded and went to put Atticus to sleep. \"Maybe a little drink will help cheer Dumbo up.\" Timothy smiled. \"Yeah, I always take a drink when I feel upset about something.\" Cherry agreed. Dumbo was starting to cry again, but not as much as before. \"Let's see if some water will help.\" Timothy said. \"It should...\" Cherry looked to the water. \"Ah, good, I think I'll have some too... I feel thirsty now that I think about it.\" \"I know how ya feel Dumbo, but you gotta pull yourself together,\" Timothy said to the sobbing baby elephant. \"What would your mother think of you if she saw ya crying like this. Remember, you come of a proud race. Why you're uh…a pachyderm, and pachyderms don't cry. What's cryin' get ya anyhow?\" Cherry rolled her eyes. \"I wanna be with my mama!\" Dumbo cried out. \"I know, little guy, I know and you will soon enough, I promise.\" Timothy assured him. Dumbo sniffled and then started to hiccup. \"Oh, no, he's cried too much...\" Cherry noticed. \"I know, now he's got the hiccups.\" Timothy said. \"All right, Dumbo, come here, let's get some water.\" Cherry said, lifted Dumbo's trunk up gently and put it in the water, she then took a clean plastic cup and scooped herself up some water. \"Thanks.\" Dumbo said. \"Here, take a trunk full.\" Timothy suggested. Dumbo started to suck up the water just as Cherry drank down her glass. \"Hold your breath.\" Timothy said. Dumbo held his breath and his face turned bright red. Cherry took another cup full of water and sipped it down before it would be sucked away from the baby elephant. \"Why, you're mother's gonna be so proud of ya,\" Timothy encouraged Dumbo to boost his self-esteem. \"I'm gonna be proud of ya too. Cherry and Atticus are gonna be proud of ya. The whole circus is gonna be proud of ya. Now, whatdaya think of that? Swallow it.\" Dumbo gulped down the water before he instantly hiccuped again. \"You okay?\" Timothy asked. Cherry smiled out of the blue and lightly laughed. \"What's so funny?\" Timothy asked. \"Talking animals...\" Cherry said in a slurred voice, then laughed louder before cracking up and falling on the ground and pounding it with her fist. \"Huh? What's in this water?\" Timothy asked before taking a look. \"Have a drink, old chum!\" Cherry laughed and accidentally slapped Timothy into the tub as she kept having her hysterical moment. \"Whoa!\" Timothy yelped. Cherry kept laughing hysterically for no reason. Timothy eventually emerged from the water and was going under the same spell as Cherry. What neither of them knew was that the water had been spiked while they were away. Dumbo was then overly smiling from the water he had ingested. \"Oh, my gosh...\" Cherry kept laughing and laughed so hard that tears came to her eyes. \"Uh... What was so funny, Cherry?\" Darla asked, interrupting the story. \"Yeah, what was in that water?\" Amber added. \"Uhh... Soda pop?\" Cherry seemed to lie. \"The truth, Cherry, what was really in the water?\" Patch asked. \"Well... You're getting older... But it was...\" Cherry gulped in mid-sentence. \"Alcohol.\" \"Alcohol!?\" Amber, Darla, and Patch panicked. \"We didn't know though,\" Cherry defended. \"We just thought it was plain old water, so we drank it!\" \"Yikes and that happened while Atticus was asleep?\" Darla asked. \"Pretty much,\" Cherry said. \"You guys didn't see anything 'strange', did you?\" Atticus asked since he was asleep during this part. \"We thought we saw pink elephants,\" Cherry explained. \"It was really screwed up.\" \"Pink elephants?\" Patch said confused. \"Just a disclaimer,\" Cherry put her hands together. \"When you go under the influence from drinking, you can tend to see things that aren't really there...\" \"So what happened?\" Darla asked. \"I don't remember much after the pink elephant thing.\" Cherry said. \"We found her with Timothy and Dumbo in a tree.\" Atticus added. \"But Cherry, you always told us you can't and won't climb trees.\" Patch pointed out. \"I should also mention when you get drunk, you do things you wouldn't normally do.\" Cherry quickly said. \"Ohh, please continue.\" Amber said. \"Um, Atticus, why don't you start this one off?\" Cherry suggested. \"I just remember pink elephants and the world's worst headache.\" \"Okay, so it got to happen like this...\" Atticus said. Flashbacks to Atticus and Atlas finding Cherry Timothy and Dumbo on their way up a tree. Atticus and Atlas had been looking around all morning for Cherry, Dumbo, and Timothy since they weren't back at the circus ground or anything. \"So, did you sleep okay last night, little buddy?\" Atlas asked. \"Yeah and I think I saw my family in my dream last night.\" Atticus smiled. \"What were they like?\" Atlas asked, smiling at his smile, that was a good sign. \"They were caring and kind, my father, he was brave kind and strong, well, not like god strong, but just strong fatherly strong and my mother, she was kind caring and beautiful and so was my older sister.\" Atticus smiled as a small tear slipped out. \"So you had a sister.\" Atlas said from that. \"Yeah, she seemed so cool...\" Atticus said softly with a sad smile. \"I... I wonder if they're even still alive... And... Why they gave me up.\" \"I'm sure they had a reason.\" Atlas assured him. \"I wish I could know...\" Atticus said. \"Don't worry...\" Atlas hugged him gently. \"I know how you feel a little...\" \"How so?\" Atticus asked. Atlas let go and sighed. \"I... I haven't seen MY family in years... Sure, you can think of the circus as a new family since you all got a lot in common, but it's not the same.\" \"Well, maybe when that jerk is humiliated, we could get the contracts and rip them up so you can see your family and so then me and Cherry can get back to her family.\" Atticus said. \"Oh, I don't know...\" Atlas frowned. \"Ringmasters are strict when it comes to contracts.\" \"Not that I've seen, but I'd love to see ours go through that.\" Atlas laughed rather wickedly, then looked up and his eyes widened. \"What the..?\" \"What?\" Atticus asked. Atlas pointed up. Atticus looked up and saw Cherry, Dumbo, and Timothy on high tree branches. \"How in the world did they get up there?!\" Atticus asked.[Chapter 12] \"Hey, boys!\" a crow called out to Atticus and Atlas, then pointed to the human girl, mouse, and baby elephant. \"Y'all know these visitors?\" \"Yes, we do.\" Atticus and Atlas nodded. \"We was just about to find out what they were doin' up here.\" another crow said. \"Leave it to me, boys.\" another crow, who seemed to call all the shots, volunteered himself. \"How did they get up there in the first place?\" Atlas asked. \"That's what we're tryin' to find out!\" the head crow said, then flew down to the three non-bird visitors. Timothy was curled up in Dumbo's trunk, fast asleep, until cigar smoke blew in his face which made him cough and instantly wake up. \"Ugh...\" Cherry rubbed her head. \"My head... Dumb pink elephants...\" \"Pink elephants!\" the head crow repeated to his fellow crows with a laugh. \"Pink elephants?\" Atticus said, confused. \"That's what she said!\" the head crow said. \"What's so funny?\" Cherry glared at the crows once she could see again. \"And what're you rats with wings doing all the way down here?\" \"What're we doing DOWN here!?\" the head crow laughed. \"Well, hear her talk!\" \"Ah, fly up a tree where ya belong.\" Timothy grumbled. \"Yeah.\" Cherry also grumbled, feeling more sour than usual. \"Say, look here, Brother Rat and Sister Monkey.\" the head crow said. \" BROTHER RAT/SISTER MONKEY!? \" Timothy and Cherry sneered. \"Now, listen,\" Timothy glared. \"I ain't your brother, she ain't your sister, and we ain't no rat or monkey, see!?\" \"That was a bit harsh, Crow!\" Atticus called out. \"Uh-huh,\" the crow ignored Atticus an looked to Timothy and Cherry. \"And I suppose, you two and no elephant ain't up no tree either?\" The other crows laughed. \"Listen here, we-\" Cherry was about to argue, then her face paled and she started to sweat and she slowly looked down. She then yelled out and lost her balance, but she grabbed onto another branch and hyperventilated. \" GET ME OUTTA HERE! \" \"Uh-oh, I forgot to mention this Atlas, but Cherry has a serious fear of heights.\" Atticus said. \"I can see that.\" Atlas commented. \"Let's just hope the branch doesn't break.\" Atticus said. Dumbo slowly opened his eyes. \"Don't look now, but I think we're up a tree.\" Timothy whispered to the baby elephant. Dumbo couldn't help but look down and instantly became frightened. \"Oh, this could end badly.\" Atticus said. Cherry was about to get up from the branch, but Dumbo and Timothy crashed down with her and the three of them ended up in the water together. The crows laughed at their misfortune. \"You three okay?\" Atlas asked. Cherry spit out some water, including a fish. \"Ugh... Sure... Never better...\" she replied in bitter sarcasm. Dumbo looked up to the crows and pouted. \"They're laughing at us...\" \"Ah, don't pay no attention to those scarecrows,\" Timothy coaxed. \"Come on, let's get back to the circus.\" \"Yeah, those crows are just jerks.\" Atlas glared at the black birds. \"So long, boys!\" the head crow laughed. \"Oh, and girly too, sorry Monkey!\" Cherry shook her fists, growling at the crows, then looked curious. \"Does anyone even know how we got up there?\" \"Nope.\" Timothy said. \"Hey, there, fellas, maybe you flew up!\" one crow suggested with a laugh. Cherry scoffed. \"Yeah, sure, we flew up, and then when I go home, I'll just wave my magic wand and all my homework will be done!\" That gave Timothy an idea however. \"That's it! Dumbo, you flew!\" \"You're actually thinking that Dumbo flew up into that tree?\" Cherry asked. \"Oh, boy, am I stupid!\" Timothy got hysterical. \"Why didn't I think of this before!? Your ears, just look at 'em, Dumbo! Why, theyr'e the perfect wings! The very things that held ya down are gonna carry ya up and up and up!\" \"I think he swallowed too much seawater.\" Atlas commented. Atticus nodded in agreement. \"Dumbo: The Ninth Wonder of the Universe!\" Timothy continued. \"The World's Only Flying Elephant!\" \"Well, his ears do seem big enough for Dumbo to fly.\" Atticus said. \"Don't tell me you're encouraging this!\" Cherry gawked at her best friend. \"Did you ever see an elephant fly?\" one crow with glasses asked. \"Well, I've seen a horse fly.\" one crow said. \"I've seen a dragon fly.\" the fat crow added. \"I've seen a house fly!\" the crow with a straw hat even added in. \"If you birds start laughing, I swear I will tear off your feathers!\" Atlas threatened. \"Okay, we won't laugh.\" the head crow said. \"Good.\" Atticus sounded relieved. \"We'll sing!\" the head crow said then. \"I suggest we shut their beaks,\" Atlas said. \"Because this song is not going to be enjoyable from these birds.\" \"You guys go up, I still need to recover from vertigo...\" Cherry took a breath. \"Phew...\" \"We'll wait.\" Atticus said. Cherry then sniffled and bent her nose back and scratched her nose. \"Okay, I'm good.\" \"Nosebleed?\" Atlas asked. \"Thankfully no.\" Cherry was relieved. \"Then what could it be?\" Atticus asked. \"Don't worry about it.\" Cherry said once she put her head back to normal since she wasn't going to have a nosebleed. \"That's good.\" Atticus sighed out of relief. The crows laughed about Dumbo being a flying elephant. Cherry growled, she squeezed her eyes shut and her hands shook into fists. \"I'M GONNA KILL THEM!\" \"I won't hold you back.\" Atticus said. \"You dirty birds are just like the rest of 'em!\" Cherry glared at the crows. \"What is WRONG with you!?\" \"Hey, monkey girl, lighten up!\" the head crow said. \"No, you lighten up!\" Cherry glared back, her eyes seemed to glow red from rage. \"Dumbo is only a baby! He's been bullied for every day of his life already just because he's a little different and he's been taken away from the only one who can make him feel better: His mother! Everybody just laughs at him like he's a big fat joke! How would you like it if you were taken away from the only person who understood you and you were made fun of for being different?!\" \"Yeah!\" Atticus added. Cherry came up to her best friend's side, still glaring at the bullying birds. \"Look at Atticus, when we were little kids, he was bullied for being a weak little bookworm, he had nobody else! I could've just ignored him like everybody else, but I didn't! And why? Because that's wat friends do, they help each other and you're not making Dumbo's problem any better! You crows should be ashamed of yourselves! Dumbo's mother was taken away from him just because she wanted to protect her only baby and what do they do? They locked her up and never let her come anywhere near her child and they forced him to become a clown! Oh, what's that? You're not laughing? Neither am I! Go ahead and laugh, see if I care, we are OUT OF HERE! \" This was a side no one had ever seen before; Amber, Darla, and Patch were even surprised when they heard this. \"You said all that!?\" Amber, Darla, and Patch asked in surprise. \"I don't like it when my friends get hurt.\" Cherry said with her eyes shut. \"Good to know.\" Patch said. \"Cherry, I've never known you could be aggressive when your friends are threatened.\" Darla said. \"It's okay, Dimples, you're safe.\" Cherry promised. \"That's good, anyway, please continue.\" Darla said. \"Tell us this though, did those crows learn their lesson?\" Amber asked. \"Yeah, I think I guilt tripped them.\" Cherry replied with a shrug. \"Yep because they then tried to help us out.\" Atticus said. \"The crows decided we were okay,\" Cherry narrated. \"So they gave us a plan to help us out back to the circus and how to make Dumbo an icon instead of a practical joke.\" \"What did they do?\" Patch asked. \"Well...\" Cherry and Atticus said. Flashbacks to the crows telling Cherry, Atticus, Atlas, and Timothy something about a 'magic feather' to help make Dumbo fly. \"A magic feather? Oh, please, there is no such thing.\" Atlas scoffed. \"Trust me...\" the lead crow said, taking out a black feather. \"We know what we're doin'...\" \"There's no such thing as magic.\" Cherry added. \"But it might help Dumbo believe that he can fly.\" Atticus smiled. \"Come on, guys!\" Timothy took the feather and ran with it. Cherry sighed and rolled her eyes, following after anyway. \"Dumbo, look, I have got it!\" Timothy showed the feather. \"The magic feather! Now you can fly!\" \"Yeah! Now we just gotta find a perfect spot for lift-off.\" Atticus said. Later in the day, they tried at the end of a cliff. Cherry, Atticus, and Atlas were coming by as the crows were getting to push the baby elephant off the cliff with the mouse. \"Let's hope this works.\" Atticus said, crossing his fingers. \"We have to try.\" Atlas said. \"Let's go, Dumbo.\" Timothy coached the baby elephant. \"Just start flapping your ears.\" Atticus said. \"Oh, I hope I don't mess this up too...\" Dumbo said to himself before squeezing his eyes shut and started to get ready to fly. Cherry, Atticus, and Atlas watched, concerned, hopeful, and worried for Dumbo. They got even more worried when dust clouds started to form while the baby elephant flapped his ears. There was coughing from the dust clouds as Dumbo flapped his ears like they were bird wings. Timothy set himself inside of Dumbo's hat. Cherry, Atticus, and Atlas coughed and were briefly blinded from the dust clouds as they stood with the crows on the edge of the cliff. After a while, they thought nothing had happened, but they were surprised when they saw what happened. \"Why, he flies like an eagle!\" the crow with glasses said. \"That's better than an airplane.\" the fat crow added. \"Brother, now I've seen everything.\" the lead crow was amazed. Cherry, Atticus, and Atlas looked with the crows and Dumbo was literally flying in the air with his ears keeping him and Timothy up in the sky. \"I don't believe it.\" Cherry said with widened eyes. \"Believe it.\" Atticus and Atlas said. The crows, instead of laughing obnoxiously, now praised Dumbo for his amazing and disgusting talent. \"Dumbo, I know you could do it!\" Timothy cheered. \"Wait 'til we get to the Big Town!\" \"Dumbo flew?\" Darla asked in disbelief. \"Come on, I know we're kids, but you don't think we're that gullible, do you? That's impossible!\" \"Yeah, flying elephants are just as possible as mermaid cities, talking animals, an alternate dimension of talking and singing ponies, and witches...\" Cherry agreed, though was obviously being sarcastic to prove that that had really happened. \"Touche.\" Darla groaned. Cherry patted her on the head. \"Just wait until you have your own adventures someday.\" \"I hope I have one someday.\" Darla frowned. \"That'll be fun.\" Amber smiled encouragingly. \"So, I take it that was when you guys got back to the circus?\" Patch asked the two story-tellers. \"Yes, and this is where it gets good.\" Cherry said to the puppy and two little girls. \"The humiliation of the ringmaster!\" Amber, Darla, and Patch cheered. \"Yes, the humiliation of the ringmaster,\" Cherry said. \"But first...\"[Chapter 13] Cherry, Atticus, Atlas, Dumbo, and Timothy then found a way back to the circus. \"Where have you all been!?\" the ringmaster glared to them. \"I've been worried sick over you!\" \"Trust us, you wouldn't believe us if we told you, but we can promise you is that tonight's performance is one no one will ever forget.\" Atticus smiled. \"Oh, that sounds very promising.\" the ringmaster smiled eagerly and selfishly again, his greed taking over him. \"You'll have to wait and see what is it.\" Cherry added. \"Oh, hurry up in there then!\" the ringmaster pointed inside the tent. \"Those folks will be here any minute and I want that elephant to be turned back into a clown pronto!\" \"Oh, he will, sir.\" Atlas smirked. Cherry went to take care of Dumbo. The female elephants were nearly healed and not as hurt as they were from the Pyramid of Pachyderms mess. \"I promise, Dumbo, after today, you never have to wear this crap on your face again.\" Cherry told the baby elephant as she applied the clown make-up on his face. \"Thank goodness.\" Dumbo smiled. Cherry gently blew in his face to let the paint and make-up dry quicker. \"This is going to be a show no one will ever forget.\" Dumbo smiled. \"You got that right, please try not to talk while I do this.\" Cherry warned. \"Sorry.\" Dumbo stopped then. Cherry kept working and once she was finished, she let him go, then put the feather close to him. Dumbo wrapped his trunk around the feather as a good luck charm. And where afterwards, they all got to their positions as crowds of people began to come in to see the circus acts. \"Wow, that's a huge crowd.\" Cherry's face paled once she saw there were a lot more people than usual coming to the circus tonight. The other acts went by and they seemed to go sooner than expected until it was time for the clown act. The mother elephant clown was going hysterical as the act normally went with Dumbo as the baby stuck in a burning building. Timothy was going to stay with Dumbo for emotional support, he had been a real pal and Cherry and Atticus would never forget him. \"Is it just me or is that higher than usual?\" Atlas asked. \"I don't know, but I'm glad I'm not up there.\" Cherry whispered as she stood by with a bull whip in case Dumbo would misbehave, but she knew he wouldn't. Dumbo looked even more nervous to be up this high, but Timothy kept coaching him and told him to hold onto the magic feather. \"Why do you have a bull whip?\" Atticus asked his best friend. \"Ringmaster made me,\" Cherry said. \"Just in case the animals get out of control, I know I'll never use it on Dumbo, but I have to keep it with me.\" \"I swear, I hate that man more and more.\" Atlas growled. Dumbo jumped off the platform and was starting to fall down instantly. The fall was rather strong and Dumbo was falling quicker than anticipated. So much that the feather came out of his trunk. \"Uh-oh, he lost the magic feather!\" Cherry got nervous. \"Oh, no, what now?!\" Atlas asked out of nervousness. \"All we can do is hope and pray that he can fly without it.\" Atticus said. \"Prayer doesn't work...\" Cherry mumbled due to her skeptical ways. Dumbo was very nervous, but eventually... The audience looked in shock and wonder as the baby elephant spread out his ears and he started to fly around. \"Wahoo!\" Atticus cheered. \"He did it!\" Cherry and Atlas cheered for the baby elephant. The clowns were scared and they hid in a barrel of water which made the audience laugh. Another clown ended up in a tub of cream pie. Dumbo then started to do some tricks while in the air that wowed the crowd even more. \"This is amazing! You know what would make this even better?\" Atticus asked. \"Public humiliation?\" Cherry asked. \"Yep.\" Atticus smiled. \"But how?\" Cherry's eyes grew shifty. \"I also think those elephants need their just desserts too.\" Atlas agreed. Atticus came up with an idea and began to whisper it all to Cherry and Atlas. Cherry and Atlas leaned in to listen. Since this was dark and sinister, Cherry had a rather malicious look on her face and she rubbed her hands together like a wicked villian. \"Let's do it!\" \"Then let's get everything into position.\" Atticus said. Cherry and Atlas nodded in agreement. \"Atticus is always the man with a plan...\" Darla commented. \"Jealous...\" Amber muttered, but still smiled. \"Some of us can have a plan from time to time.\" Patch said. \"You know what I mean.\" Darla retorted. Back in the story, Atticus, Atlas, and Cherry were waiting for the right moment. As soon as the moment arrived, the three of them put the plan into action. Dumbo was flying toward the ringmaster now. The ringmaster panicked and ran off, tripping over a ball and then fell into a barrel of water, headfirst. And where luckily he had the contracts that held Atticus, Cherry, and Atlas in the circus against their will. Dumbo had the mother elephant mask also placed on the ringmaster's butt which made the audience laugh. Cherry noticed paper and took it out to show her, Atticus, and Atlas's contracts. \"I'm no lawyer, but I think these contracts are beyond saving, which means, you don't own us anymore!\" \"Yep and where since you don't have copies of these, we can do this.\" Atticus and Atlas said before they both ripped the contracts to shreds. \"You can't do that!\" the ringmaster tried to get himself free. \"I'm sorry, sir, but you have no legal right or authority of us anymore.\" Atlas agreed, shockingly enough for the ringmaster. \"Yeah and after tonight, we are out of here and going back where we belong!\" Atticus told the ringmaster. \"You can't!\" the ringmaster protested. \"We can and will!\" Cherry said, determined and strong. Dumbo sucked up peanuts from the cart and beaned them at the female elephants. They may had been friends with his mother, but they were bullies to him, so he decided to give them a taste of their own medicine. And where they didn't seem to like this at all, but they did indeed deserve it. \"You're making history!\" Timothy praised Dumbo. The crowd loved Dumbo and thought he was great, no longer making fun of his large ears. And where this was indeed going to be history in the making.[Chapter 14] \"Ya guys wanna come with?\" Timothy asked. \"I can make ya as big as Dumbo!\" \"Thanks a lot, Timothy, but we're gonna go back where we belong,\" Cherry smiled. \"Take good care of Dumbo for us. We'll never forget you.\" \"Yeah.\" Atticus smiled. \"Okay, I will, take care, you three.\" Timothy smiled. \"Take care.\" Cherry, Atticus, and Atlas said, waving to their new mouse friend. Timothy smiled and scampered off to join Dumbo, returning to the circus since they belonged there. \"Come on, guys, I'll take ya home.\" Atlas told the kids. \"Thanks, Atlas.\" Atticus smiled. \"It's the least I could do after the way I behaved the first time we met.\" Atlas said. Cherry gave a nod. \"Sorry about that by the way when we first,\" Atlas chuckled sheepishly. \"Guess being in the spotlight brought out the worst in me...\" \"It does that to most of us.\" Atticus shrugged. Atlas then got a car before it tried to drive away with two criminals in it. \"What the!?\" Cherry noticed. \"HEY! What's the big id-\" One of the criminals was about to shout at Atlas before seeing that he was shouting at the strongman and started to become nervous. Atlas snarled and stormed over. \"Whatcha up to, fellas?\" \"Atlas, thank you so much for stopping those two robbers,\" A police officer smiled after arriving with another officer. \"They were about to get with $10,000 Dollars.\" \"Aw, it was nuthin'.\" Atlas smiled sheepishly. Cherry and Atticus came to Atlas's sides. \"What happened?\" Cherry asked. \"We've been trying to catch these robbers forever, but this guy helped us.\" the other officer told her. \"In return, you can have their car they stole.\" The first officer told them. \"Wait a minute, this is my car!\" Atlas glared at the robbers after seeing the license plate that once belonged to the exact same car he stopped. \"It is?\" the other officer asked. Atlas scoffed, though not at the cops, to the robbers. \"Yeah!\" \"Wow, what a major coincidence.\" Cherry commented. \"Yeah.\" The robbers said nervously. \"You can send them straight to the prison if you would like.\" The officer said to the strongman before placing both robbers in front of Atlas. \"Oh, I dunno...\" Atlas smiled shyly. \"What do you guys think?\" he then turned to Cherry and Atticus. \"Give them both an uppercut straight to jail!\" Atticus and Cherry told him. \"Sure...\" Atlas smiled darkly to the robbers. The robbers looked to each other with gulps. Without another word, Atlas did just that and sent them straight to jail where they belonged. And where they both felt pain in their jaws from the uppercuts. \"Well, I better get these two back where they belong.\" Atlas said, referring to Atticus and Cherry. \"Have a good day, sir.\" the first officer said. \"You too, kids.\" the other officer added. \"We sure will.\" Atlas, Cherry, and Atticus smiled. The officers nodded to them and let them go. Atlas went to his car and started it since the key was still in the ignition. \"So those guys stole your car?\" Cherry asked. \"They must have stolen it the day I signed that blasted contract.\" Atlas said. \"That sounds about right.\" Atticus said as he sat in the backseat, hooking his seat-belt. \"Where to?\" Atlas asked. Cherry gave him her home address. \"Both of you then?\" Atlas then asked just to make sure. \"Yes.\" Atticus and Cherry said. Atticus and Cherry waited eagerly and in anticipation as they were on their way back home. Since the circus ground was so far from home, the kids slept in the backseat at some points while waiting anxiously to get home. Atlas only woke them up when they had to stop at a gas station and would again, when they would be at Cherry's house. At one point Atticus got to sit up front with Atlas so then he could know where the house he is looking for is. Cherry normally would sit up front due to her carsickness, but due to being exhausted from this circus adventure she had with Atticus, she lay down in the back and was able to fall asleep. \"That's a good friend ya got there.\" Atlas smiled to Atticus. \"She really is, she's my best friend.\" Atticus said. \"You know, maybe until your family is found, maybe you could stay with me and my family.\" Atlas said. Atticus thought about that, it was a nice offer though. \"Ummm... I dunno... I've known Cherry for a long time...\" \"I'm sure you could visit her from time to time.\" Atlas assured him. \"Hmm...\" Atticus hummed. Cherry lightly snored as she hugged her jacket, using it as a blanket. They were about ten blocks away from Cherry's house. \"There's my house.\" Atlas smiled, seeing a red building. \"You live around Cherry?\" Atticus asked. \"Huh?\" Atlas looked to him. Atticus pointed to Cherry's house as they passed it. \"Huh, what're the odds?\" Atlas chuckled. \"Well, then, I guess if it's only ten blocks away from her house, then yes, I will accept your offer.\" Atticus smiled. \"I promise that you can visit her all you want,\" Atlas smiled back. \"I'd never split up two best friends.\" \"Thank you Atlas that means a lot to the both of us.\" Atticus smiled, referring to himself and Cherry. \"No problem, kiddos.\" Atlas smiled. Once they reached Cherry's house, she instantly woke up, already having the feeling they had finally arrived at her house. \"You up?\" Atlas asked. Cherry yawned and stretched and had a small smile since she knew she was home. \"Mm-hmm...\" \"It was really nice meeting you two,\" Atlas said to the kids. \"Now remember, if you're ever so humble, there's no place like home.\" \"Yep.\" Atticus and Cherry nodded. The three of them then went up to Cherry's house. Cherry knocked on the door and then ran behind Atlas with Atticus. Bud opened the door, he had a very stoic and blank look on his face. \"May I help you?\" he asked, his voice sounding like it was going to break. \"Would this be the house of Cherry Butler?\" Atlas asked. \"Yes, but...\" Bud said before he sounded emotional, he usually had a very low and deep voice, but if you knew him for a long tiem, you would tell when his voice would change emotions. \"But what?\" Atlas asked the man of the house. \"She... She doesn't live here anymore...\" Bud said, clearly devastated. \"Oh, then I guess we must have came to the wrong house.\" Atlas said, showing Cherry and Atticus. \"C-Cherry...?\" Bud asked. \"Daddy...\" Cherry called back. \"Cherry Girl!\" Bud cheered, then hugged his daughter nice and tight. \"Oh... I thought we'd never see you again...\" \"I've missed you and Mom so much.\" Cherry said. \"We missed you too...\" Bud smiled, letting her go so she could breathe. Atlas smiled at the reunion. Atticus was happy too, but was jealous. After the happy reunion, Atticus and Atlas told them about the strongman's offer to the boy to stay with his family until his family could be found and would still see Cherry once in a while. Atticus was getting his stuff out of the guest room though and packing up to stay with Atlas from now on. \"So then I'll see you around, right?\" Cherry asked while helping her best friend pack. \"Yeah,\" Atticus said. \"Anything, you're my best friend.\" \"Just kinda sad to see ya go,\" Cherry said. \"We've lived with each other side-by-side and now you're gone... We haven't found your family, but you're leaving.\" \"I won't be too far away, just ten blocks away from your house.\" Atticus assured her. \"You take care of yourself now...\" Cherry said softly. Cherry smiled in the hug, but then winced. Atticus had accidentally hugged tighter. \"Atticus!\" Cherry gasped, coughing slightly. \"Atticus, I know we're best friends, but could you loosen your grip? I don't wanna call a chiropractor every time we hug!\" \"Oops, sorry, I forgot how strong I am now.\" Atticus said, loosening his grip. Cherry rubbed her back. \"At least you can't get any stronger than this...\" she said with a weak chuckle. \"Bye, Cherry.\" Atticus said to her before going out of the house to meet his new family. \"Bye, Atticus...\" Cherry nodded and let him go. \"You'll like my family.\" Atlas smiled while they drove back to his family's house. \"I hope so.\" Atticus smiled in excitement. To Atticus's surprise, the moment they got inside Atlas's family's house; he saw three other strongmen and two women. \"I'm home!\" Atlas happily called to his family. \"Atlas!\" His family smiled, welcoming him back in with a dog pile/hug. Atticus stood back with a small smile. Atlas laughed as he reunited with his family. \"Who's your friend, little bro?\" The second strongman asked as soon as he noticed Atticus. \"This is Atticus, he's going to be staying with us a while,\" Atlas introduced. \"Atticus, this is my family: Those are my brothers, Brutus and Butch, and my sisters, Vera and Lotta.\" \"Nice to meet you all.\" Atticus smiled. \"And this is our father Hercules, named after the Greek hero.\" Butch said. \"Hercules, huh?\" Atticus smirked. \"You know him?\" Brutus asked. \"Yeah, you have no idea...\" Atticus laughed at his little inside joke. \"Hmm... Let's how strong you are, boy.\" Hercules smirked. \"You better not make another mess!\" Another female voice called out from the kitchen. \"Let me guess, that would be the mother, right?\" Atticus asked Atlas. \"Aren't all moms the same?\" Atlas chuckled. \"True.\" Atticus shrugged. \"Don't worry, Marianne, it won't be that bad.\" Hercules assured his wife. \"Good, because I don't want to clean up another mess...\" Marianne said before she saw Atlas. Atlas smiled to her. \"Oh, Atlas, you're home!\" Marianne sounded touched. \"I didn't think we'd see you again.\" \"You should thank Atticus that I'm back, without him, I wouldn't have ripped the contract, freeing me from that jerk.\" Atlas said. \"So, um, how long did you stay with Atlas's family?\" Amber asked Atticus. \"For a few weeks before the Fourth of July happened and during my stay with them, the guys would wrestle with me or even arm wrestle with me and continue to exercise with me.\" Atticus said. \"Did you still go to school with Cherry?\" Patch asked. \"Of course, but this was during the summer, so we didn't have much of school until I'd meet my family while we would visit James and Elizabeth.\" Atticus smiled at that memory. \"What a Fourth of July holiday... I got to reunite with my family and meet the girl of my dreams...\" \"Yeah, Mo, your girlfriend.\" Amber and Darla teased. Atticus deeply blushed. \"Yeah...\" \"Did Dumbo ever reunite with his mother?\" Patch asked. Cherry and Atticus were about to say something until a tiny mail truck was passing by, it appeared to have a mouse driver. The others looked curious, then followed after the mail truck, curious where it could be going. \"Maybe it's from Timothy.\" Patch smiled. The mail mouse stepped out just as Jerry came out curiously and the mail mouse handed an envelope for him. Jerry smiled, shaking paws with the mail mouse and took his envelope with an excited smile. \"Who's it from, Jerry?\" Patch asked. Jerry came over to them and showed them he had a letter from his cousin Timothy. Cherry and Atticus smiled to this. Jerry opened the envelope, he saw a flyer for the circus and an important headline that said 'Flying Elephant Reunited At Last with Mother'. \"Looks like Dumbo got to be reunited with his mother.\" Amber smiled. Jerry walked over to the group and looked through the letter from his long-lost cousin in the circus and hugged it as he knew Timothy was okay and well, making a bright and better future for himself. A mouse trap was scooted over to Jerry with a block of cheese on it. Jerry glanced at the trap, then pulled a 'Are you kidding me?' look on his face, then snatched the cheese and pushed the trap onto a gray and white tail, snapping it. There was a yell of pain heard and Tom came to chase Jerry. Jerry ran from Tom, but then stopped him and showed him the letter from Timothy. Tom read it and where he was surprised by this. Jerry smiled and held out his arms. Tom smiled back and held out his arms, giving Jerry a hug. The two shook paws and then Jerry ran off. Tom shook still, then glared as Jerry got away and chased the mouse again. \"Do those two ever learn?\" Darla sighed at the cat and mouse. \"Nope.\" Atticus said. \"I might as well join in to make sure nothing bad happens.\" Patch said. \"Oh, boy...\" Amber sighed. Patch then went after Tom and Jerry. \"You guys knock that off right now!\" \"Lunch!\" Emily called from inside. \"Oh, boy, lunch!\" Darla beamed and ran inside the house. \"Better get inside before the food's gone.\" Atticus said. \"Slow down, Darla, haven't you heard of 'guest's first'?\" Amber chased her best friend playfully. \"First is the worst, second is the best!\" Darla giggled. It took Patch quite a while, but he was finally able to catch up with Tom and Jerry and keep the Tom cat from hurting Jerry or even eating him. \"Enough!\" Patch growled. Tom and Jerry stopped their chase and fight, pointing to each other, trying to look innocent. \"You can talk now you know? Ever since we met Robyn.\" Patch said. \"Oh, right, well, anyway, he started it!\" Jerry said, pointing to the tom cat. \"I did not, it was all you, and you know it!\" Tom retorted. Patch sighed and rolled his eyes. \"What am I going to do with you two?\" \"Keep Tom from trying to hit me or keep him from trying to eat me?\" Jerry suggested. \"You two do not make it easy...\" Patch sighed. \"What would Pugsley and Frankie say if they saw you two right now, huh?\" \"They would remind us that we have to be friends.\" Jerry and Tom sighed. \"Right... If you guys can be friends with me, a puppy, as in a dog, then you two can be friends.\" Patch said then. \"Fine, we'll stop fighting, but it'll feel weird.\" Tom said. \"Come on then...\" Patch led them back home. Tom and Jerry then followed the Dalmatian puppy, they only gave looks to each other. \"And you can do your usually chases, but Tom, don't eat Jerry!\" Patch told the cat. \"No promises on that last one...\" Tom shrugged. \"TOM!\" Patch glared at the cat. \"I-I'll try...\" Tom shrugged again. Patch sighed. \"Fair enough... Now, where's Robyn?\" \"Out with her dad, but they'll be back for lunch.\" Jerry said. \"That's great.\" Patch smiled. \"Before I forget, me and Jerry will be staying at Robyn's uncle's house with Robyn while her dad is off to work for a while.\" Tom said. \"Robyn has an uncle?\" Patch asked. \"Yeah, who knew?\" Jerry shrugged with a small smile. Patch then remembered 'Aunt Figg'. \"Is he really her uncle or...?\" \"He's really her uncle and get this; he's a wizard.\" Tom said. \"No way!\" Patch couldn't believe it. \"Way.\" Tom and Jerry nodded. \"That's so awesome! Let's hope that he's nice.\" Patch smiled. \"I hear he can be strict when it comes to rules, but hopefully we all get along.\" Tom shrugged. Robyn came out to see her cat and mouse. \"Were you guys chasing each other again?\" \"Sorry, Robyn, old habits are hard to break.\" Jerry replied. \"Well, I hope you don't do that while we're staying at my uncle's house.\" Robyn said. Tom and Jerry looked to each other. \"I didn't know you had an uncle, Robyn.\" Cherry said. \"Oops, sorry about not telling you about him.\" Robyn said sheepishly. \"That's okay.\" Cherry said with a shrug. \"I better get inside for lunch.\" Patch said. Tom and Jerry waved to the puppy. Patch nodded, then went inside to join his family for lunch. Cherry now wondered what to do while Tom and Jerry left back to their new home with Robyn. She decided to just spend sometime with her family. \"So, you girls going to join the circus?\" Emily asked as a joke as she served grilled cheese sandwiches for lunch. Darla drank down her orange juice and looked to her adoptive mother. \"I think maybe if I get the chance, I'll become an actress again when I'm a little bit older,\" she then said. \"Being a child actor is exhausting.\" \"It sure looks like it.\" Amber said. \"Was it really all that bad?\" Patch asked curiously. \"I had a tight schedule,\" Darla told them, memorizing her day in the life of her fame and glory when she was beloved by all until the incident. \"6:45, wake up. 7:15, get dressed, eat breakfast, brush teeth, comb hair, 7:30, leave home, 8:00 until 12:50, film for a movie or meet important people, 1:30, eat lunch, 2:00, back to work, 5:30, come home for dinner, 6:00, take a bath, 6:30, get ready for bed, 8:00, go to bed, Repeat until next morning.\" \"Yikes.\" Patch said. \"Tell me about it...\" Darla groaned. \"No friends... No family... Just me and the spotlight... It sounded glamorous when I was a little girl, but now it's more like a prison than a luxury...\" Amber hugged Darla. \"You got us.\" Darla smiled to Amber and hugged her back. Everyone started to eat their lunch, enjoying the day. The End ","Summary":" Darla and Amber were in the backyard, playing with Patch. \"Okay, Patch, let's see what you can do,"},{"Movie":"Dumbo","Title":"Dumbo: An Acrobat's Tale","Author":"judygumm","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12191671","Passage":"[Chapter 1] Dumbo: An Acrobat's Tale Judy Garland as Sandy Williams Mickey Rooney as James Williams Freddie Bartholomew as Robert Williams Paula Winslowe as Katherine Williams May 21, 1941 Sandy Williams stood up holding onto the handle as she felt movement underneath her feet. Sweat was forming over her eyebrows and she brushed it away to prevent her bangs sticking to her forehead. The air was hot and stuffy, all she wanted was to get off this crowded bus and get in the free open space. Then the bus came to a halt, and the doors parted open. \"Stop for Homeland Florida City,\" the driver announced. This is it! Sandy thought to herself. She got off the bus with the other passengers, and she paid the driver and came to the sign. She turned back to watch the bus drive away towards the horizon. The girl sighed as she looked around, and headed down the dirt path towards her destination, the Circus Winter Quarters. She placed down her two suitcases and pulled out the map with the address, from her satchel. She looked over at the horizon, and picked up her heavy suitcases to trudge down the dirt path with thoughts of her future. I wonder why Uncle Harold asked me to join? I hope the workers there are kind, and I can't wait to see the animals. I heard that he has elephants, and they're my favorite animals. It'd be good for me to study them, just when I was in Africa with Poppa. She then heard the sounds of a train blowing its' horn, and then the animals; the sounds were of neighing, roaring, and most of all, the trumpet sound. \"I'm getting close,\" Sandra said. She walked briskly towards the sounds until she came to see an area surrounded by tents, buildings, and stables. \"This must be it.\" She took a deep breath and walked through the entrance and looked around. The men were packing up the trains with poles, and tents. They were also loading up the animals in the cars along with the musical instruments too. \"Excuse me,\" she said to a few men passing by her. \"I'm here to look for the Ringmaster, have you seen him?\" They passed by and ignored her. She shrugged in frustration and continued to look for her uncle. \"Hmmm, I guess not.\" She continued on her way until she saw a plump man with a mustache, a top hat, a red jacket, yellow pants, a shirt with a bow tie, black boots, and yellow gloves. He was busy barking orders to the workers. \"Ah, there he is,\" she smiled and walked towards him. But she stopped to smooth out her dark skirt and apron, and pulled back her mid-length sandy blonde hair back with a headband. The stiff dark vest tighten her ribs over her white shirt. She trudged herself towards the Ringmaster and stopped a few feet away from his back. \"Hello,\" she said. \"Uncle Harold?\" \"Yes,\" the Ringmaster said in an exasperated tone without turning around. \"May I help you?\" \"It's me, Sandy.\" The Ringmaster turned around and his stressed face turned into excitement as he saw his niece. \"Ah, Sandy!\" he cried and hugged her. \"Hello Uncle!\" she said as she hugged him back but his grip was very tight. It almost crushed her to death. \"It's so wonderful you're here!\" he released the girl and placed his hands on her shoulders. \"My how you've grown! Are you back from Africa?\" \"Yes,\" Sandy smiled. \"I went there for a semester to study elephants, wildlife, and hopefully I get my master's degree in Zoology.\" \"Ahh, that is impressive,\" he said. \"Look, I love to continue to talk with you, but I'm quite busy and we'll be departing soon.\" \"How long until we depart?\" \"In ten minutes, there's a room for you over at the front car, Joe could lead you there.\" \"All right, after I settle myself down, I'll visit the elephants.\" Sandy said. \"I've studied them and know how to be near them.\" \"All right, suit yourself.\" He turned to the workers and barked out the orders. \"Come on men, we haven't got all day! Joe could you lead my niece to her room?\" \"Yes, boss,\" A man in his thirties or forties in a blue suit with black hair and mustache came up and took one suitcase from her. He led the girl over to the car where the performers, acrobats, and clowns slept. \"Follow me, Ms. Williams,\" he said. As the blonde continued to follow him, she looked over to see the elephants being loaded in the car, but she saw one female elephant with a pink bonnet and blue blanket over her back. She looked up at the sky and sighed sadly. Then another elephant dressed in a feathered headdress, and a crimson blanket assumed to be the Matriarch pushed her into the car, but she got her rump stuck in the entry way. So six employees pushed the elephant into the entryway a couple of times and finally got her in and the door slammed into her face as she glared at them. Sandy gave a sigh and a chuckle at the elder elephant, she caught up with Joe into the performer's car, performers were walking all over and tried to settle themselves down in their bunks. They came to a stop, as Joe opened a door for her. The room was small and simple with a bed, a desk, a closet, a vanity, a dresser, and a window that shows the view. \"Here you are Ms. Williams, I hope you enjoy your stay.\" \"Thanks, Joe.\" Once the worker left, Sandra set her suitcases down on her bed and placed her neatly folded clothes in the drawers to organize them. In her other suitcase, she pulled out jars of herbs and plants, with books of spells and rituals for healing, along with many photographs, of her family, herself and on many adventures she went on. She opened the window to let in the warm breeze and inhaled the sweet scent of the flowers, along with the dirt. Soon, the train was ready to go. \"All aboard!\" the Ringmaster yelled from the red caboose. \"All aboard!\" \"All aboard!\" the train, Casey Jr. replied. \"Let's go!\" Then the train began to move, but with the heavy cars, he moved back hitting the cars and Sandy nearly toppled over and landed on her bed. Finally Casey Jr. began to chug away to move north to its' designated town. With the circus workers and performers sitting on top of the cars and stood near the doors, they began to sing a song as the train chugged and blew the whistle. Casey Jr.'s Comin' down the track Comin' down the track With a smoky stack (Choo! Choo!) Hear him puffin' Comin' 'round the hill Casey's here to thrill Every Jack and Jill Every time his funny Little whistle sounds Everybody hurries to The circus grounds Time for lemonade And cracker jack Casey, Jr.'s back Casey, Jr.'s back She hummed to the song, and walked through the narrow hallways, balancing herself as she clutched onto the sides with her satchel hanging around her waist with her other suitcase as she walked across the flatcars. She passed the workers, as they paid no attention to her. She saw the large orange stock car, housing the elephants. She discovered a door, and she pushed it leading to an open airy car with hay and lots of space. She noticed the elephants were behind the stable doors. She set down her suitcase and pulled out a jar of sea salt to create a sacred circle on the floor, only leaving an opening at the east side. With a bowl of incense, a wand, a plate with two candles: one pure white and the other black, matches, and a bowl of holy water for cleansing. She was ready to perform the ritual. She stepped into the circle, closed the east gate with the salt and began a prayer, \"Oh god and goddess, I have settled myself in the car with the other elephants, and they seem to give me no distractions. I am calm and have remained positive to you as you offer your acceptance of me.\" The girl heard the voices of the god and goddess coursing through her blood and the voices were kind and clear as day, she silently thanked them. She moves to the center of her sacred circle as she moved her arms up and over, taking deep breaths as the guardians of the watchtower watched her. \"Guardians of the watchtower, Spirits of the North, South, East, and West, hear me now and come me forth. Elements of nature; earth, wind, fire, water, and spirit come to me! Come into my temple and be in one with me.\" She faced the directions, as her arms move up with a call, \"Guardian of the South, lend me your fire; Guardian of the North, lend me your stability; Guardian of the West, lend me your love; and Guardian of the East, lend me your communication. Blessed being, summon thy soul to purify it, as I call to them for an audience.\" The young woman grabbed the box, and pulled out a tiny match. She carefully lit it, and pressed it on the wick of the candle as a tiny flame danced. She lit another and burned the bowl filled with incense. She moved the bowl gracefully in clockwise as she sniffed the sweet aroma, carefully not setting the straw on fire as she placed the burnt matches in another bowl. \"Bless, cleanse, concentrate, and purify this temple in the name of the almighty deities. That nothing dark, negative or evil shall enter this holy temple. Let nothing trespass into these pure walls. Then cast it out, for it is not needed in here. In the name of the almighty deities, so be it!\" She picked up her holy water and dipped her fingers in the cool liquid, allowing her hand to spread the droplets around the circle in a clockwise position. \"Bless, cleanse, concentrate, and purify this temple that it be made in the name for the gods and goddesses themselves. That nothing dark, negative, or evil enter these holy walls and be a part of it. In the name of the almighty deities, blessed being, so be it,\" she repeated. Sandra placed the holy water down, and felt the magic flowing through her body and brain. She stopped for a moment to look at the locket hanging around her neck. The blonde pressed a tiny button as it revealed a small black and white photograph of a woman with a gentle smile. \"Oh Momma, I will always follow your ways of being a Wiccan priestess as I call forth the gods, and goddesses. The temple is now ready, and no evil will trespass within these holy walls. I shall seek their audience as they come to bless me in the purest temple I have created.\" The girl closed the locket and moved her hands up into the air, allowing the herbs and incense to fly around her soul. \"Oh god and goddess, I thank thee for allowing to grant me audience with thee. I shall continue to perform the rituals in my time at the circus, to assure that I will cleanse any sin. I hereby conclude this ritual and release the spirits around me complete.\" She then kissed the sacred ground and made the signs of the cross. She completed her ritual by collecting her herbs, blowing out the candles, pouring the holy water into a jar, she collected the sea salt to fill up another jar, and placed all the items in the suitcase and closed it shut. She picked up her locket again and looked at the photograph and sighed. \"Oh Momma, I wish you were here,\" she said. The girl felt something gently stroking her mid-length hair and looked up to see the elephant sniffing the girl with her proboscis. It was the same one that stopped and sighed as she got on. \"Oh hello there,\" Sandy said as she stood up, patting the elephant's trunk. \"I guess you must've watched my ritual, and I mean no harm. I was only doing a purification spell.\" It didn't take the blonde long to hear the elephant look at her and spoke up with a gentle voice, \"A purification spell? Does it make you a sorceress?\" \"Of course not,\" the girl said giggling. \"I'm not performing witchcraft.\" The elephant's blue eyes widened as she backed up in surprise. \"Wait, can you understand what I'm saying?\" \"Why yes, it's in my blood, I can hear what animals are saying and I can understand and speak to them, because of my heritage. Please, I mean no harm.\" The girl held up her hands trying to calm down the elephant and she relaxed. \"Oh my goodness, if you have that gift, it must make you special, and I see you as no harm,\" the elephant smiled. \"Speaking of which, my name is Harriet. Mrs. Harriet Jumbo.\" \"It's a pleasure to meet you, ma'am. I'm Sandra Williams, but my friends call me Sandy,\" the blonde said shaking the elephant's proboscis. \"It's nice meeting you Sandy. Is this your first time joining the circus?\" \"Yes, it is, the ringmaster is my uncle, and he hired me to join the circus as an acrobat, and trapeze artist,\" the girl said and then frowned. \"But a while ago, I noticed you looked blue and were thinking, is their something bothering you?\" \"Oh dear no,\" the female elephant said. \"I was hoping the stork would come, and deliver me my baby today.\" \"You're waiting for a baby elephant?\" Sandy's eyes for filled with excitement and then turned to confusion. \"Wait a minute, you didn't conceive one with a mate?\" \"Yes, but it didn't arrive last night,\" she said sadly. \"I'm pretty much of a loner. I was hoping maybe it would come today.\" \"I understand, I never knew stork delivery actually existed,\" the girl petted the elephant's trunk. \"But no worries, it'll come, is it a boy or a girl?\" \"I don't know, but when it comes, I'll love it just the same.\" Mrs. Jumbo smiled hopefully. Sandy nodded in agreement. She opened her locket again, and took another look at her mother, whose smile matched her own. \"Who's this?\" Mrs. Jumbo asked noticing the photograph. \"That's my Momma, her name was Katherine. I lost her when I was very young, and her death was very hard on me.\" \"I'm sorry to hear about your mother, Sandy. I lost my mate, a few months ago. I truly loved him very much and saw him as my best friend. Before he died, he said that someday, our calf will be special, and the stork will bring him for us. With our baby, it will remind me so much of him.\" \"Sounds wonderful,\" the blonde smiled. \"Anyway, I hope you're a nice person,\" Harriet said, as her face darkened. \"I don't like to live near or have anyone that gossips about nonsense.\" She looked over towards the other side and pointed with her trunk, and the girl followed her direction. Sandra noticed that there were four other elephants that stood behind stable gates, including the one who pushed Mrs. Jumbo into the car. \"So this girl knows what we're saying?\" the Matriarch asked, giving a dirty look and a scoff. \"Well, I'm quite flabbergasted, it seems to me that she's cursed.\" \"Cursed, oh yeah,\" the elephant in a blue headdress and rug giggled uncontrollably in a high-pitched voice. \"And what is that awful smell?\" the elephant in orange with tassels asked as her trunk rubbed her head. \"It's giving me quite a headache.\" \"Where are those Guardians of the Watchtower?\" the other elephant in lime green asked. \"I don't see them anywhere, they must be a fragmentation of your imagination.\" The other elephants giggled at the comment and the girl gave them a look, as she crossed her arms. \"First off, I am clearly not cursed, and this is incense, I burn it for purification and spirituality, and cleanse my soul of the sins I may have done. Without it, I'd never be able to perform my ritual, and seek audience with the god and goddess in my mind. You may not see them, but I can hear them, and not see them physically.\" \"Well, why do it here than in your own car?\" the elephant in orange, Prissy asked. \"That way, no one, even my uncle will see me and think I'm crazy. This car of yours is a better place where I can get away from the distractions, and I needed more space to set up my temple, than my small room.\" \"Well, I certainly hope you don't make some hocus-pocus to create harm to us and the other animals to chase them out of their stalls,\" the elephant in green, Catty said. Mrs. Jumbo knew that those elephants should know better, and she came up and wrapped her trunk protectively around the girl and gave them a glare. \"Look ladies, stop teasing this girl,\" Harriet said sternly. \"I see her as a harmless human being, and besides, she's not at all like the other workers, clowns, even the Ringmaster. She's very unique, in her own way.\" \"She's right, but I'd never do such a thing. I'm about to turn nineteen in October, and now that I'm an adult, I make my own choices to keep me content. I also wish to live in peace,\" Sandra added. \"We'll see about that, and we may as well ignore you along with her,\" the Matriarch said curtly. The elephants all mumbled in agreement and turned away from them. Mrs. Jumbo led the girl away and turned to a different corner, to face away from them. \"Don't worry about them,\" she said quietly. \"The ladies: Prissy, Catty, Giddy, and the Matriarch know it's their own fault. They should know how to hold their tongues better, and shouldn't judge others, when they get to know them.\" \"Why do they always gossip?\" \"I don't know, but I think it's what they like to do in their pastime. I'd just ignore them, and don't mind what they say. They're not much to talk around them, but at least you're the only one I can talk too.\" \"Yeah, you said it,\" Sandy smiled. The two continued to talk throughout the train ride, to learn more about themselves, laugh at some good jokes, and tell each other stories. Sandy felt that this was the start of a different life that would change her forever. Hi there, I decided to polish up on the first chapter, and I like this a lot more than the original version. I decided that Sandy would perform a ritual, so people would understand more on her Wiccan heritage. I truly enjoyed writing the ritual and I hope you enjoyed![Chapter 2] Sandy sat near Mrs. Jumbo reading her favorite book Black Beauty, the story of a black stallion that goes through a life of kindness and cruelty from every master that owned him and earns a happy place in retirement . It too was her mother's favorite book, and passed it down to her. The blonde believed that it would be perfect in order to pass the time. Suddenly, she heard a male voice from outside calling for Mrs. Jumbo. She looked up to see the other elephants waving their trunks out of the sunroof and called for the voice to show him the place. \"Yoo-hoo!\" \"Over here!\" \"This way boy!\" \"In here! In here!\" Giddy cried. \"Yoo-hoo!\" Prissy called. \"This is the place!\" Catty added \"Oh, I guess he probably doesn't want to see me,\" Sandy said to herself. \"I better hide.\" She noticed a pile of barrels near the other corner behind Harriet. The girl grabbed her suitcase and rushed towards the barrels. She placed her suitcase behind, and jumped over the barrels, and peered through the edges to get a clear look. Soon, she saw the stork appearing from the window roof. He was wearing a blue delivery uniform and red hat, and he tipped his hat to the elephants. \"Whew, at last,\" Mr. Stork said. \"Which one of you ladies is expecting?\" A few of the elephants giggled and scowled at the mention of expecting a baby. The blonde giggled quietly, and kept herself out from the stork's sight. \"Not me,\" Catty said shaking her head as Giddy giggled. \"The very idea!\" Prissy said frowning. \"Certainly not!\" the Elephant Matriarch said sternly, she then pointed to Mrs. Jumbo and smiled. \"Over there, of course,\" The other elephants agreed with her and Mrs. Jumbo smiled shyly. \"Oh, of course,\" Mr. Stork said and he landed in front of the mother-to-be and placed a white bundle down. The girl still peered from behind, beaming with excitement, and she knew that she will have to keep this a secret for a long time. The bird took out a small book from his hat, placed the hat back on his head and cleared his throat as he recited a poem. \"Here is a baby with eyes of blue, straight to Heaven, right to you.\" Mrs. Jumbo thought it was over and her trunk reached over to untie the knot on the white bundle. \"Or….\" Mr. Stork interrupted. \"Straight from Heaven up above, here is a baby for you to love.\" The elephant reached for the bundle again to open, until the stork interrupted again. \"Sign here, please,\" Mr. Stork handed out a notebook. Harriet took a pencil and wrote 'X,' underneath the words, Received One Elephant. She gave her signed form back to the bird and he looked it over. \"Uh, yeah,\" he mused accepting her signature. \"Well… Oh, Mrs. Jumbo.\" The mother elephant was anxious than ever to open her white bundle. But the stork had to finish the final step of the service as he pulled out a harmonica. He touched Mrs. Jumbo's trunk with his foot to stop her. \"Uh, one moment please,\" he said. \"This is still part of the service.\" He blew into his whistle and began his song as he caressed and looked in the white bundle. The other elephants followed his singing and smiled. The girl still hid, and hummed along with the song. Happy Birthday to you, Ah, Happy Birthday to you, Happy Birthday dear…. Ah…. Dear….. Then Mr. Stork stopped in the middle of his singing, and the elephants glared at him. The girl raised her eyebrows at the bird. He turned to Mrs. Jumbo. \"Ah, dear me,\" he said embarrassingly. \"What's his name?\" \"Jumbo Junior….\" she said softly. \"It's a perfect name, Mrs. Jumbo,\" Sandy agreed. \"Oh, Jumbo Junior, huh?\" Mr. Stork smiled. \"Ahem. Jumbo Junior.\" He blew his whistle again to wrap up the song and landed on the window. Happy Birthday, dear Jumbo Junior Happy Birthday To-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo YOOUUUUUUUU! He was then grabbed by a mail post near a train station and continued to sing, as the train left in the distance without him. Mrs. Jumbo began to untie the white bundle, and she was very excited to meet her new baby calf. The other elephants kept encouraging her and were very excited to meet him. Sandy decided to keep hiding before, Harriet could allow the girl to see her calf. \"Oh, do hurry dear.\" Prissy said urging Mrs. Jumbo. \"I'm on pins and needles!\" Giddy cried. \"Isn't it thrilling?\" Prissy sighed. \"I'm all a-flutter!\" Giddy exclaimed. \"Ah, this is a proud, proud day.\" The Matriarch said filled with pride. \"Well hurry and open it, dearie!\" Catty urged. \"I'm just dying to see!\" Prissy said. \"Please open it Mrs. Jumbo,\" Sandy said. \"I can't wait to see him!\" Mrs. Jumbo unwrapped the last of the bundle and the sheet dropped to reveal her calf. The elephant was very small, so were his ears, and his eyes were blue as his mother's. Everyone was in total awe at the sight of him. Sandy had to hold in her excitement as she looked from behind the barrels. Oh my goodness, he's so adorable! She thought to herself. \"Look at him!\" the other elephants said. \"Look at him!\" The baby calf looked up to see his mother for the first time and she smiled back. She had finally met her baby son for the first time in forever. The calf smiled as his vision cleared at the sight of his mother, and looked over to see the other elephants complimented him. \"Oh, what a—\" Giddy said. \"Oh, look!\" \"Oh, you sweet little thing,\" Prissy said. \"He is cute, isn't he?\" Catty replied. \"Oh, he is a darling little baby,\" Giddy said. \"Adorable,\" the Matriarch said. \"Simply adorable.\" Jumbo Junior turned around to look at the elephants complimenting him. \"Did you ever see anything so cunning?\" Prissy asked. \"Isn't he a darling?\" Giddy said. \"Kootchy, kootchy, kootchy, kootchy, kootchy, kootchy,\" the Matriarch tickled Jumbo Junior's chin, as she was cooing him. The baby elephant then sniffled as if he felt funny, but after a long breath, he sneezed and his ears popped out. His ears were enormous, for his small size, as the size of an African elephant's ears. \"Oh my,\" Sandra said, holding in her gasp. All of the elephants gasped at the sight of them and complimented him in a cruel way. \"Is it possible?\" the Matriarch asked. \"Isn't there some mistake?\" Prissy said. \"Just look at those, those—\" Catty wanted to say the word, but she spelled it out to Giddy. \"E-A-R-S.\" \"Those what?\" Giddy asked, before realizing and laughing. \"Oh, ears! These!\" she picked up the calf's ear with her trunk and mocked them. \"Aren't they funny?\" Mrs. Jumbo glared at Giddy, and slapped her trunk, forcing her to release her son's ears. The elephants gasped at the mother elephant and she carried her calf to her side to protect him. Sandy gasped at what the elephants said to the calf. She stormed out from her hiding spot and glared at them, standing next to Mrs. Jumbo. \"Hey, you know better then that! Show him some respect! He was just born, and not in front of his mother!\" \"Oh, my goodness,\" Prissy gasped. \"What a temper,\" Catty added. \"Even that girl!\" \"Oh, what did I do?\" Giddy asked sarcastically. \"Well, tell me. Did I say anything?\" \"Perfectly harmless remark,\" the Matriarch replied. \"Oh for Heaven's sake, you're offending him!\" Sandy snapped. \"Even in front of his mother! That was rude!\" \"That doesn't matter!\" Catty said. \"We weren't rude, you're the one who is rude!\" \"Oh, shut up!\" Sandra snapped. \"Shame on all of you!\" \"I just said that they're funny, and they are funny,\" Giddy said, not feeling guilty. \"They certainly are,\" Catty agreed. \"After all, who cares about her precious little Jumbo?\" Prissy said sarcastically. \"Jumbo?\" Catty asked. \"You mean, Dumbo .\" \"Dumbo,\" the Matriarch agreed. \"Are you kidding me?\" the girl mused as she stood by Mrs. Jumbo, and she glared at of the elephants for mocking her baby and gave him that silly nickname. Dumbo looked from behind his mother's leg and gave a small smile not understanding why they were all laughing. \"Oh Dumbo, that's good!\" Giddy giggled. Sandy noticed the top door over the Matriarch, Prissy, Catty, and Giddy. She turned to Mrs. Jumbo and pointed at the door. Mrs. Jumbo smiled and as the elephants continued laughing, she pulled the screw and it slammed on the elephants' faces. That caused all of them to shut up. \"That should shut them up,\" she said. The girl sighed in relief that those elephants won't pick on Dumbo for now, just as long as he was on his mother's side. \"I'm so sorry about this Mrs. Jumbo,\" she said. \"This wasn't supposed to happen.\" \"Don't worry about it Sandy,\" the mother elephant said. \"But thank you for standing up for my son.\" \"You're welcome,\" Sandy smiled. Dumbo came up to the girl and sniffed her clothes. \"Hi little guy,\" she petted his head gently. \"Don't listen to them on what they say to you, I think your ears are very precious.\" Dumbo's eyes narrowed in confusion, and reached his trunk up to her face, looking for her trunk. Harriet chuckled, and gently placed his trunk into her own, and slowly pulled it away. \"Dumbo, this is Sandy, she's a human and she can speak to us,\" Mrs. Jumbo said. \"Don't you worry, she means no harm, and she's a Wiccan. I see her as a good human.\" The calf smiled at the girl, and took her hand into his trunk to shake it. She looked out of the window and noticed that it was getting close to sunset. She decided to turn in early for the night. \"I think I'm going to bed,\" the girl said as she fashioned a bed from a pile of straw and pulled out a blanket from her suitcase. \"Good night Mrs. Jumbo and Dumbo… oh I'm sorry, I mean….\" She recognized her mistake and attempted to correct herself. \"Don't worry dear,\" the mother elephant said. \"I'll prefer it as his nickname. You can always sleep with me, and I appreciate your company.\" \"You're welcome my friend,\" the girl smiled and watched as Mrs. Jumbo laid herself down on the straw, and tenderly hugged her little calf. Dumbo crawled up and lies on his mother's leg. She wrapped his big ears around his tiny frame as a baby wrapped in a bundle of blankets. She caressed him with her trunk and rocked him to sleep. \"Don't pay any attention to what others' say about you,\" Mrs. Jumbo said quietly. \"No matter what happens, even with your big ears, you will be my precious calf, and you are destined for great things my son, far greater that will make you a star. And I will always love you with all my heart, my sweet little Dumbo.\" Sandy smiled at the special moment between mother and son, it reminded her of when her late mother would comfort her and her two brothers when they felt sad or had an upsetting day. She read up a couple more chapters of Black Beauty and more of the readingmade her eyes lids grow heavier and heavier every second, and at last slumber claimed her.[Chapter 3] The train chugged across the bridge as the sun was setting over the horizon and he went through a tunnel. Casey Junior then trudged him self up a steep hill, pulling the cars behind him chanting to himself. \"I think I can, I think I can, I think I can, I think I can, I think I can, I think I can, I think I can, I…\" He finally reached the top of the hill and rolled down as he said to himself, \"I thought I could, I thought I could, I thought I could, I thought I could, whoo-woo!\" Casey Junior traveled down the train tracks and moved through a valley through the dark night, as dark clouds were forming in the sky. The train finally reached its' destination in a small town in Georgia, just as a storm was rolling it. Casey Junior came to a sharp halt at the animals were slammed forward in their cars. Sandy woke up with a start; she sat up, smacked her dry mouth, and stretched her sore muscles. She looked over to see Dumbo looking out of the window and it was already starting to rain, rain drops landed on his face and he covered his face using his ear as an umbrella. As soon as the train started to rest, the performers, roustabouts, clowns, and animals exited from the cars, with Dumbo holding onto his mother's tail as he walked out of the train for the first time. The performers decided to rest in the car to get their rest for the parade tomorrow, while the roustabouts and workers start advertising and setting up the tents. The Ringmaster suggested to Sandy that she should rest too, but she decided to help out the roustabouts and the elephants, feeling sorry that they had to work in the rain. She grabbed her suitcase and threw on a raincoat and exited the car. She watched the roustabouts setting up, and the elephants pushing the cages and wagons off the cars. Hike! Ugh! Hike! Ugh! Hike! Ugh! Hike! The roustabouts began chant and sing by throwing tent stakes and each group rhythmically started hammering the stakes into the ground. Sandy grabbed herself a heavy mallet, it dragged her arms to the ground, but with another ounce of strength, she picked up the mallet and began to work. We work all day, we work all night We never learned to read or write We're happy-hearted roustabouts Hike! Ugh! Hike! Ugh! Hike! Ugh! Hike! As the men worked hard to get the tents set up, the elephants also used their mallets to hammer the stakes in the same rhythm. With the rain pouring down, it was difficult to step up the circus even more. When other folks have gone to bed We slave until we're almost dead We're happy-hearted roustabouts Sandy worked along side with Dumbo and Mrs. Jumbo as they all work together to hammer a stake. Although Dumbo was still a baby, he was willing to help out, and he used a small hammer to help his mother and the girl, copying their moves. But he stopped and wanted to hit the stake harder, he made a swing to hit it, and he ended up bonking himself in the head. \"You okay there Dumbo?\" Sandra asked. Dumbo nodded and smiled, which gave her and the mother elephant relief. Hike! Ugh! Hike! Ugh! Hike! Ugh! Hike! The elephants kept working by carrying the tents on their backs, and it gave Sandy a relief that they did not tease Dumbo any further. Dumbo was still eager to help out, and the girl tied a little lantern at his tail, to help the calf feel that he would feel useful and do his part. He followed his mother and the Matriarch and Catty as they carried the rolls of the circus tent on their backs. We don't know when we get our pay And when we do, we throw our pay away (When we get our pay, we throw our money all away) The camels walked forward carrying poles in between their humps. They knelt down to the ground, so the elephants could pick them up. The creatures pulled the poles and set them upright, while Dumbo dragged a small one and fell backwards, but Sandy helped him out. We get our pay when children say With happy hearts, \"It's circus day today\" (Then we get our pay, just watching kids on circus day) The elephants rolled a large rolled up cover tent over with Dumbo following them, as the storm got more powerful. The thunder was the sound of the earth trembling and lightning flashed fiercely. Muscles achin' Back near breaking Eggs and bacon what we need (Yes, sir!) Dumbo helped his mother tied the tents up with the rope, as Mrs. Jumbo pulled the ropes through the holes, and Dumbo pulled the knots through the loop. He then ended up tying his proboscis in a knot, but Sandy helped him untie the knot and he smiled back at her as a sign of thanks and she smiled back. Boss man houndin' Keep on poundin' For your bed and feed There ain't no let up The elephants were harnessed like horses to pull up the tall, heavy, poles to set them upright. The girl's dress was getting soaked, and she didn't care about it, knowing she will freshen up once this is over. Must get set up Pull that canvas! Drive that stake! Want to doze off Get them clothes off But must keep awake Mrs. Jumbo grabbed a rope and pulled it hard with the other elephants, Dumbo pulled on her tail thinking it was fun. Then lightning flashed and thunder roared, and scared the calf into hiding underneath his mother. He looked out in curiosity, and hid again went it stormed again. Hep! Heave! Hep! Heave! Hep! Heave! Hep! Heave! Hep! Heave! Hep! Heave! Hep! Heave! Hep! The worker stood up on the cloth of the tent and rolled it down, to cover it, and the ropes were flinging. The elephants grabbed the ropes pulled it hard to prevent it from blowing away in the strong wind. Swing that sledge! Sing that song! Work and laugh the whole nightlong You happy-hearted roustabouts! The roustabout and workers threw each other ropes and tied the big top tent down. Sandy grew exhausted from working very hard and lifting up the mallet. Pullin', poundin', tryin', groundin' Big top roundin' into shape Keep on working! Stop that shirking! Grab that rope, you hairy ape! Once the roustabouts tied the rope to the harness to the elephants, they hauled up the final tent of the big top. At long last, the set up of the circus was complete as the roustabouts finished their song and the rain was lighter and the storm moved away. Poundin'! poundin'! poundin'! poundin'! Although everyone and the animals were exhausted from all the hard work, it was all worth it in the end. They all went to their own tents to get into their warm beds to rest and get ready for the parade. \"Well,\" Sandy said as she rubbed her hands on her apron. \"I'll see you in the morning Mrs. Jumbo. Good night Dumbo,\" she petted the baby elephant's head and kissed his forehead. Mrs. Jumbo nodded at the girl and her son sniffed her skirt. Sandra headed straight to her tent and there was a bed, a closet, her suitcase, a rug, a vanity, and her alarm clock on a small table next to a lamp. She hanged up her wet dress and shirt on a hanger in her closet to dry. She changed into her plain green nightgown and got underneath the covers of her bed and drifted off to sleep.[Chapter 4] The morning sun rose, and the sky was a clear blue, making it a beautiful day for the first day of the circus as the bog top was ready for opening day. In her tent, Sandy rose up early, and stood by her table in front of her herbs and began a chant. All she wore was a green bathrobe, and there were hair curlers in the back of her hair. Bring health to my body Heal mind and soul too Strength and well-being Make it all new She heated up a bowl of water, and poured the remnants of crushed peppermint, birch, and ginger into the heating liquid. She waved her hands over it as she sniffed the steam to heal her mind. By Earth and water Air and by fire May you hear this wish, Sources of life and light She placed the bowl down and came to another. The girl pressed her fingers in the soft lard mixed with boiled arborvitae leaves and rubbed the sticky herbal salve against her legs, with the leaf remnants sticking to her bare skin. Sources of the day and of the Earth, I invoke you here, Heal my body and mind. She inhaled the fresh scent of her herbs and they assaulted her nostrils as the steam warmed her face. Oh wondrous nature, Thou has been gentle with me Bring health within my internal soul And… \"Sandra!\" a voice spoke out, causing the girl to scream, and jump, and whip around. She saw her uncle standing there, looking at her oddly. \"Uncle Harold!\" Sandy covered herself in her bathrobe. \"Don't you know not to barge into my tent, while I'm undressed? I could've been naked!\" \"Oh for Heaven's sake Sandy you are in your robe and fully clothed,\" the Ringmaster reminded her. \"This time,\" she smoothed out her robe. \"But next time, I might not be so lucky.\" \"Oh never mind,\" the Ringmaster waved it off. \"So what are you up to before the parade starts?\" \"Oh before you came in, I was performing a healing ritual to soothe my sore muscles and fatigue before I perform.\" \"You're taking up your mother's Witch heritage?\" The Ringmaster raised his eyebrows at the mention of her mother being a Wiccan. \"Your mother was a strange woman, when I met her, she thought that plants could heal wounds. She reminded me of a witch.\" \"Oh Uncle Harold,\" Sandy rolled her eyes. \"It's Wiccan, not witch. People back then thought Wiccans were witches during the Salem Witch trials, but they were just misunderstood for goodness sakes. Even my ancestor was a Wiccan and passed it down to every generation in the family.\" \"All right,\" he said rolling his eyes and waving his hands. \"I get the idea, the parade starts in two hours, and I came in to check in to see how you are. I also expect you to be ready as soon as possible.\" \"Yes sir,\" she said sarcastically. \"Once I clean myself off, I'll be ready.\" \"Okay,\" he said giving the girl a small smile. \"I'll meet you out there.\" He exited the tent and left the girl alone, and she gave a sigh and washed off the remnants of the leaves from her legs. They felt smooth and slender to the touch from her fingertips. Not only did she perform rituals and healing with being a Wiccan, it also gave her the power to communicate with animals. Sandy sat in front of her vanity mirror as she began to remove the curls from her mid-length hair into tight but gentle curls and pinned them in the back. She applied her foundation, neutral smoky eye shadow, with her mascara and eyeliner, blush on her cheeks and finished the look by applying red lipstick on her lips. She sipped her chamomile tea to wake up and ease more of her muscle tension, after having a busy night from helping out with the roustabouts. The girl went to her closet and pulled out her yellow-orange leotard with an off-the-shoulder neckline, a sheer short skirt, sheer sleeves, and a green gem at the neckline. She removed her robe and slipped the leotard on, fitting her figure. She placed small bronze hoop earrings on her earlobes, wrapped a green choker around her neck, and pulled her green ballet shoes on. She stood up to leave her tent to head off for the parade, but she forgot something important. She turned back to find her headband, it was simple and tan, dressed with a few yellow and red feathers. She placed the accessory on her head and she smoothed out her hair. Sandy headed out of the tent and came to the elephant tent where the elephants were dressed in their blankets and headdresses to look elegant with the riders to sit on their heads. The girl saw Mrs. Jumbo getting her son ready, and he giggled as she dressed him and the other elephants stood away from them getting themselves ready. She smiled to see both mother and son bonding. She then heard the announcement that it was almost time for the parade to start. She got to where the rest of the performers were, warming up for the parade. The acrobats were, behind the clowns, and in front of the elephants, of course. Sandra did a couple of stretches and flexed her muscles to un-stiffen herself and look her best for the parade. The Ringmaster came up leading his white horse, and stood up straight with his stern face. \"All right everyone,\" he said. \"It's time to start the parade, and as soon as I come out, the band will come, then the zebras, lions, tigers and gorillas. The hippopotamus will pull the calliope, the camels and their riders next, then the clowns, the acrobats, and finally the elephants. Do your best, and make no mistakes.\" \"Yes sir,\" everyone replied. The Ringmaster mounted on his white horse and led the whole circus down the street into town. He waved and bowed to the crowd with his horse, impressing them with his charismatic way. The Marching band came next playing their music loudly to entertain the people. Then the zebras came pulling a caged wagon with a lion yawning. Then the tigers came lazily lying down in the straw of their cage. A gorilla roared and shook the bars of his cage, he broke one bar, but he quickly fixed it before he got caught. A hippopotamus came next pulling a calliope playing and yawned as the organ played with the steam powering it. The camels came being ridden by Arabian men, with canopies over their heads as the creatures were dressed in elaborate saddles and reins. The clowns came next and performed their silly, but stupid antics. They did their best to give the audience, and even little children, a good kick out of their performance. Sandy then performed down the street by walking on her hands, keeping her balance perfect as her bare palms touched the hot concrete. She got back to her feet, and did a few twirls and flips, along with the other acrobats. She pulled out a long green sash and waved it in the air as if she were a ribbon dancer. A tall male acrobat placed his hands on her her thin waist and tossed her up. She flipped high into the air, feeling her stomach churning and flipping inside of her. The girl landed on the acrobat's hands and stood up in a handstand position, she felt her muscles and bones shaking as if she could no longer handle the stance. The crowd cheered at her performance as she flipped to an upright position and the acrobat placed her down. Then at last, the elephants came, as powerful and wondrous creatures with men riding on top of their heads. Sandy did a few flips backwards in order to check on how Dumbo is. The baby elephant held onto his mother's tail. He wore a blue and gold headdress on his head and back, with a doll sitting on him. He was doing his best to catch up with his mother and the elephants. Dumbo then let got of Mrs. Jumbo's tail and looked to see more people for the first time, and he smiled at them. He ran forward, and he accidentally stepped on his ears, and the poor calf slipped and landed into a mud puddle. The audience started to laugh at Dumbo, and he felt embarrassed and looked up in shame. Sandy gasped to see Dumbo in total humiliation, and she ran towards him and knelt down. \"You okay, Dumbo?\" she asked as she helped him up. The baby elephant shook his head in shame. \"Don't worry,\" Sandra said, giving him a gentle smile. \"As soon as the parade is over, we'll get you cleaned up. That'll make you feel better.\" Sandy stood by Dumbo to keep him safe, until the parade was over. All the performers and animals returned to their tents, so the customers could come to visit them. Sandy came in the tent with towels and rags balanced on her head and carried a warm water bucket. She was back in her normal attire, and rather wear this when working around the circus, and had her makeup still applied. Mrs. Jumbo used her trunk to pick up the warm water buckets the girl brought her to fill up the tub and also added some lotion to create bubbles. Dumbo appeared and the mother elephants lifted her calf up and placed him in the tub. Dumbo was curious about this bath and Sandra knelt next to him and gently placed a wet soft rag onto his forehead and gently scrubbed the dirt off him. As she helped clean him, it brought back the memories from her childhood when she was growing up with her family. She remembered when her mother gave her and her older and younger brothers baths and played with them. She was then snapped from her thoughts when water was splashed in her face. \"Hey!\" she exclaimed and looked at Dumbo smiling as his trunk splashed the water. Instead of getting upset, she started to laugh, and the baby elephant grabbed her hand and tried to pull her in the water. \"I'm sorry Dumbo,\" Sandy chuckled. \"But I'm too big for the tub.\" Dumbo then got went underwater and was completely covered in bubbles. Mrs. Jumbo sucked the water from a bucket in her trunk, and she sprayed the water on her son's head. Dumbo appeared and shot water out from his trunk and covered his head with his ears as an umbrella as water poured. The mother elephant gently grabbed one of his ears and scrubbed her baby's face and Dumbo giggled. He looked up at his mother smiling, and she in return smiling to see her calf enjoying his bath. Dumbo blew into the water creating bubbles, and splashed it with his trunk. He went underwater and breathed out bubbles and turned himself around in a circle and was having fun. Mrs. Jumbo lifted him out of the bath and placed him down on the ground, and Sandy knelt by him and attempted to dry him. But the baby elephant shook the water off like a puppy, and nearly got the girl wet and she got to dry him. Dumbo leapt a few times and turned to his mother, he trumpeted to her and she replied to him by trumpeting back. Sandy attempted to trumpet to them, and her lips flattered at her attempt. The calf leaped a few times and hid behind his mother to play hide-and-seek, Mrs. Jumbo looked back to see her son hiding behind her back legs, and he peered from the back. She looked away with a mischievous smile, and Sandy grinned with them. Mrs. Jumbo stretched her trunk and playfully grabbed Dumbo's tail, and he squealed and ran around his mother's legs. He ran towards the girl and pounced on her. \"Oh!\" Sandy gasped as she landed flat on her face on the hay, \"Dumbo!\" she playfully scolded him, and he sniffed her face making the girl giggle. The baby elephant got off of the girl and went behind his mother and yanked on her tail. Mrs. Jumbo reached her trunk underneath her stomach to tickle her son, and Dumbo squealed in joy and he leaped across the room like a fawn, but he tripped over his big ears and landed on the ground. Harriet and Sandy gasped in fear thinking Dumbo hurt himself, but the baby elephant smiled to show them he was all right. Both the mother elephant and the girl smiled in relief. The mother elephant picked up her son and stroked him gently and they held each other's trunks in joy that shows a strong bond between mother and son, feeling safe and sound. Sandy smiled at the happy moment, she opened up her locket and stared at the photograph, remembering her mother's gentle smile, and tears were brimming in her eyes. She forced herself to hold them in as they brought back the memories of her late mother. She snapped out of her thoughts as Dumbo grabbed her skirt and smiled at her. She closed her locket, smiling back and wrapped her arms around his neck and gave him a gentle hug. Harriet noticed the girl's distress and stroked her back with her trunk, to comfort her as if this girl were her daughter. Then music began to play as they looked back to see visitors coming in to see the circus animals and the announcers spoke up as they came in and paid them. \"Jostling and juggling! Fifteen minutes!\" one said. \"Step right up and get your tickets,\" the second said. \"Hurry, hurry now.\" \"Hurry to the big sideshow! That's why go under the big top!\" \"Fifteen big attractions that you can't see anywhere else in the world!\" \"The greatest collection in the entire world!\" \"And the greatest comedies are featured and assembled for your entertainment.\" The visitors came in and looked at the elephants with fascination, and Dumbo looked back at them sniffing his little trunk. He looked back at his mother and she smiled at him gently while nodding to let him see them. \"I hope there will not be trouble coming,\" Sandy murmured to herself. Then a group of boys came over and they started to tease, laugh, and made funny faces at poor Dumbo. Sandy felt a wave of uneasiness flowing over her brain and flesh. Then a boy with orange hair, freckles, buckteeth, a green and white striped hat and shirt, a navy blue jacket and pants began to insult Dumbo. \"Ain't that the funniest thing you ever saw? Look at his ears!\" Smitty laughed rudely as he teased Dumbo further. The calf, however was too young to understand, thought it was a game and decided to imitate this boy. The boy used his jacket and flapped it, to pretend they were his floppy ears. \"Hey, guys, look it!\" another friend of the boy said. \"Smitty's an elephant!\" \"Mrs. Jumbo,\" Sandy said with a grim face. \"I'm going to get some water, I'll be right back. I'd also hide Dumbo away from those kids if I were you.\" Harriet grew worried that Dumbo was getting teased, and she agreed with the girl. The elephant wrapped her trunk around the calf's barrel, carried him, and turned away from the human children in order to hide him. Sandy sighed in relief, hoping that Dumbo would be safe and came near to a water pump and pushed the pump to fill up the bucket. As she filled it, she heard the boys complaining about the mother elephant hiding her baby away. \"Aw, let me see!\" one boy said. \"You can't hide him from us!\" another boy said. \"Yeah, his ears are still stickin' out!\" \"Come on! We wanna see him!\" \"We wanna laugh!\" \"Sure, that's what we came for!\" As she turned around with a full bucket, she saw Smitty entering the elephant pen and grabbed poor Dumbo by the tail, pulling him back. Sandy gasped, dropped the bucket, and growled as she came towards him. \"Hey, you can't be in there!\" she snapped at the boy. \"That's illegal! No visitors in the animal pens. Get out!\" Smitty didn't listen to her and kept pulling on Dumbo's tail. As soon as the girl reached the boy, she gripped him hard by the wrist and made him face at her glaring face as her long nails dug deep into his skin almost scratching it. She slapped him hard, and in return made him flinch in fear and winced as he tried to break free. \"Hey! What was that for?\" the boy asked as his other hand touched his cheek, where she struck him. \"For not listening to me! If you don't get out in five seconds,\" she warned as her nose was close to his face. \"You are in big trouble, young man! So get out! Out!\" \"Ah that's baloney,\" he rolled his eyes and then grinned. \"Hey guys, let's have fun with her!\" \"Oh no you don't!\" she warned as the boys entered and grabbed her arms. The poor girl attempted to break free, to stop that boy. But there were so many boys, and she could not break their grip. \"Hey, let me go right now!' Smitty came back to Dumbo and grabbed one of his ears and blew into it. Sandy looked up to see Mrs. Jumbo gasping in horror of seeing her son and the girl getting tormented. \"Stop it!\" she shouted, and broke free from the grip of the boys. \"Leave him alone!\" Dumbo ran behind his mother's legs to hide, but the boy grabbed the calf's ear and yanked on it until it hit his mother's leg, causing the poor baby elephant to fall over. All of a sudden, Mrs. Jumbo flew into a rage and grabbed the boy around the waist. She threw him on the rope, and started to spank him as he cried out in pain. \"How dare you hurt my baby?!\" she snapped as she spanked him with her proboscis. Even though the boy did not understand her. \"That's what you get for hurting my precious son!\" \"Hey! Cut that out!\" he cried. \"You're hurting me! Help!\" \"Serves you right for picking on a baby elephant!\" Sandy said curtly and kicked the boy's rear end out of the pen. Hoping this would be over, and Mrs. Jumbo would calm down. However, the mother kept going into her rampage and began throwing items and scaring the wits out of the crowd, bellowing. \"What's going on?\" the Ringmaster came in and saw everyone running out of the tent and the commotion the mother elephant was causing. Mrs. Jumbo threw a bale of hay at the other customers, Sandy did not run away, and she ran up in front of the elephant and attempted to calm her down. \"Mrs. Jumbo,\" she commanded and held up her hands. \"Steady girl, steady! Please calm down!\" \"Sandra!\" the Ringmaster bellowed. \"Move away! It's dangerous!\" \"Let me handle her,\" she snapped. \"I got this! Easy Mrs. Jumbo, easy….\" Then two circus workers pulled her away from the berserk mother elephant, and she struggled to break free. \"Hey let me go!\" she snapped as she was dragged away. \"No miss,\" one worker said strictly. \"Stay back it's not safe!\" \"Down Mrs. Jumbo, down!\" The Ringmaster cackled his bullwhip and it struck Mrs. Jumbo in the face and she dropped an empty bucket. \"Uncle! This is a huge mistake!\" she shouted. \"That's no way to calm her down!\" \"Surround her!\" Harold ignored his niece and ordered the circus workers as they ran towards the mother elephant with ropes and claw sticks. \"Tie her down!\" The workers threw their lasso ropes around Mrs. Jumbo's neck and she reared up to defend her calf hiding underneath her abdomen. Sandy struggled to get out of her trapped grip as her cold blood was drained from her arms as she watched her uncle whipping the elephant and the workers holding her down. Then the girl heard a squeal and saw another worker carrying Dumbo away from his mother. He cried out to her for help. \"No!\" she cried. \"Dumbo!\" When Mrs. Jumbo saw her son getting carried away from her, she attempted to save him. Sadly, a worker chained her leg to a stake dragging her back and her innocent and kind blue eyes turned into anger and rage of red. Sandy finally broke free from the workers' hard grip and her long legs carried her towards the elephant. \"Uncle! Stop it!\" Just as she was getting close to stop her uncle, another bulky circus worker ran towards the elephant with his bull hook and struck the girl at the back of her head. Sandy felt a shock of pain going through her skull as if lightning struck her, and she cried out as she toppled forward hitting the hard ground. She struggled to get up, but the workers and customers ran over her, kicked her in the face, and stampeded over her. Sandra laid still on the ground as she watched Mrs. Jumbo throwing her Uncle into the bath, and doused him. The sounds around her grew silent as she was brought to a world of darkness.[Chapter 5] \"Sandy…\" she heard a familiar voice in the darkness. \"Sandy…\" She groaned and slowly opened her eyes, her vision doubled up and her brain spun around in her head like a recording disc. She was wrapped up in warmth, and her head was resting on something soft and it was wrapped up. Her vision became as clearer as she saw her uncle sitting next to her bed dabbing a wet rag on her forehead. \"Oh, my head,\" she murmured as blows of pain were filling her skull. \"Oh, Sandy!\" the Ringmaster exclaimed in relief. \"I thought I'd lost you!\" \"Uncle Harold!\" Sandy shot up, but another wave of pain struck her skull, she winced and laid her back against the pillow. \"Oh what happened? Where am I?\" \"You're back in your tent and you were unconscious dear,\" he said. \"When my men were tying down that 'Mad Elephant,' one of them crashed into you. As soon as we took the 'Mad Elephant' away, I found you lying lifeless on the floor, and there was blood dripping from your head. I carried you back to your tent. The doctor treated you and your wounds, I was afraid you'd be in a coma, but he said you have a concussion and it's minor.\" Sandra's eyes widened in horror, remembering the fiasco in the animal tent and what happened to Mrs. Jumbo. She suddenly glared at her uncle with her eyebrows furrowing. \"Uncle!\" Sandy shouted. \"What were you thinking?\" \"Sandra, I am not in the mood to talk about this,\" he said sternly, while frowning at her behavior. \"Well, I for one, am! I can't believe this!\" the girl yelled. \"You and the workers tied down that poor mother elephant when she was just protecting her calf? That is insane! You should've let me calm her down, instead of you making it worse!\" \"Well it serves her right, one for starting a scare to everyone. Everything was going fine, until she ruined it! Were you out of your mind? You could've been killed!\" \"Look, I'm sure she didn't mean to start it.\" Sandy tried to reason with him. \"Well,\" he yelled. \"I'm sure she did it on purpose!\" \"Are you kidding me?\" she knitted her brows and crossed her arms glaring at him, her voice then etched with concern. \"But wait, what have you done to Mrs. Jumbo?\" \"Simple, I am putting that 'Mad Elephant' into solitary confinement,\" the Ringmaster said sternly. \"You're putting her into what?!\" Sandy gasped as her blue eyes widened. She felt that she was slapped in the face. \"I'm putting her in solitary confinement! She will stay there until she learns her lesson and becomes less wild.\" \"You wouldn't dare!\" \"Oh, I am doing it!\" he stated. \"Uncle Harold that's horrible! You're separating Mrs. Jumbo from her baby? That's a horrible thing to do, separate a baby from his mother! It wasn't her fault she started to act wild for no reason, because the ones you should be blaming are those boys! They started to pick on Dumbo, only because of his ears. Mrs. Jumbo was just hiding him away, until one boy came into the pen illegally and harassed him. I slapped him in the face and ordered him to get out, and he did not listen to me. Then those boys came in and restrained me. So, that way, he can continue to harass Dumbo. That's when it got a little out of hand!\" \"A little? Just a little out of hand?! Sandra, she threw me in a water bucket and soaked me!\" \"But she didn't mean to get very upset! Please can't you just let her go?\" \"The answer is no, nothing what you do or say will ever change my mind! You are also forbidden to go near that 'Mad Elephant!'\" \"But….\" \"No buts! My decision is final young lady, understand?\" \"Yes sir,\" she sighed in defeat. \"Did I get in trouble for hitting that boy?\" \"No you didn't,\" he said calmly. \"When the police came, I made up a cover story to prevent you from getting arrested. I told them that the 'Mad Elephant' was the one who slapped the boy and slapped you to unconsciousness. Be grateful that I saved you from getting arrested and those boys got punished too.\" He stood up, \"Well, I better get back to work and get an idea for a performance. You might as well get some rest. One more week, and you'll be back to performing.\" \"Oh, Uncle, there is one more thing,\" Sandy said and her uncle turned back. \"Until Mrs. Jumbo gets released, I will be looking after Dumbo. I hope you're satisfied and I am not impressed for you saying that Mrs. Jumbo attacked me! She'd never do that!\" \"Very well,\" he scoffed. \"Like I said before, be grateful to me that I saved you from the law.\" Once the Ringmaster left tent and was out of sight, the girl sighed in frustration. She threw the covers off and slipped out of her bed. She didn't care that she was in pain. She grabbed a small fleece and wrapped it around her shoulders. She looked into her vanity mirror and saw how injured her face was. Her blonde hair was messy, and it had a bandage that was wrapped around her forehead and the back of her skull was tender. There were purple bruises on her cheek and forehead. There was a cut near her eye that was bandaged carefully, and she winced in pain as she remembered the stampeding crowd trampling her unconscious body. She looked down to see more bruises on her chest and arms. However, she ignored it and left her tent; and trudged across the dirt path past the workers and performers. \"Selfish! Selfish! Selfish!\" she gritted through her teeth. \"He is such a stubborn goat! He's so stubborn!\" She kept walking, ignoring the others and the animals, but she stopped for a moment and thought about Mrs. Jumbo, and should find her prison. She walked around for a while until she came to a empty clearing and spotted a caged wagon, with the signs that read: \"Keep Out,\" \"Danger,\" and \"Mad Elephant.\" Seeing the sight of it, ripped her heart down the middle, the girl came closer and quickly looked around to see that she was alone. She climbed under the cord and came to the cage. \"Mrs. Jumbo,\" she whispered as she looked through the bars of the window, she spotted the elephant standing in the corner filled with sorrow. \"It's me, Sandy.\" \"Sandy!\" Mrs. Jumbo exclaimed, and she tried to come over to see the girl, but the shackles were wrapped around her thick legs and they made a clanging sound. \"You shouldn't be here, if you get caught, you will be in trouble!\" \"I know,\" the girl said. \"I'm really sorry about what happened that afternoon. I spoke to my Uncle, and begged him to free you, but he's so stubborn and wouldn't budge. I'm afraid I cannot change his mind.\" \"Oh dear,\" Mrs. Jumbo said sadly. \"Sandy I am so, so, sorry, this is all my fault. I shouldn't have lost my temper, and you got injured because of me. If it hadn't been for my outburst this wouldn't have happened.\" \"Look, this isn't your fault,\" she said firmly. \"You did what you had to do, protect your baby from those bullies. I don't blame Dumbo for it. It breaks my heart to see you locked up, and not seeing your son.\" \"Thank you dear, and I know,\" the mother elephant nodded sadly, and she looked at the girl with kind, but sad eyes. \"But could you promise me one thing?\" Sandy nodded. \"Promise me you'll look after Dumbo and protect him?\" \"I promise, of course I will,\" she nodded again. \"I'll protect him from danger and keep him safe and happy. I also promise to find a way to free you.\" \"Thank you dear,\" the mother elephant said. \"You must go before they find you here.\" \"You're welcome Mrs. Jumbo,\" she said. \"Don't worry about a thing. No matter what, you'll be set free.\" Sandra left the cage wagon and headed back to the circus to look for Dumbo. She walked by the elephant tent, as she got closer, she heard the elephants gossiping on her. \"Can you believe that little witch got injured?\" Catty said. \"I thought she'd be dead from the blow!\" Prissy giggled. \"It seems to me that she got in the way, and got what she deserved.\" The Matriarch agreed. \"Yes, that is true,\" Giddy nodded. \"Besides, she's the ringmaster's niece.\" \"You know girls, I've got something to tell you,\" Catty said. \"Tell us, is it about the girl?\" the Matriarch asked. \"Well, I heard that many of the workers have been spreading rumors and accusing that girl for sorcery and witchcraft,\" Catty said. \"Sorcery? Witchcraft?\" they gasped as Catty smiled in pride. \"How awful!\" \"Yes, and she is also a friend to that little F-R-E-A-K.\" The girl held in her gasp in horror, first they accused Dumbo for his ears, and now they think she's a witch. She was ready to storm into the tent to give them a piece of her mind, until suddenly….[Chapter 6] \"MOUSE!\" a voice cried and all the elephants screamed and ran around the tent. Sandy ran out of the tent to hide and peaked in to see all the elephants standing up on chairs, climbing up the poles, and were all cowering in fear like whiny little girls, even women who jump up on chairs to hide from mice. She looked at a pile of hay, and saw a small brown mouse wearing a matching, red marching hat and jacket making funny faces. Sandra stifled in her laughter to see those elephants getting tormented by the mouse, and admitted they deserved that. After all, they were very mean to Mrs. Jumbo and her little son, even her. \"So you like to pick on little guys huh?\" she heard the mouse asking as he pointed at them and then to himself. \"Well why don't you pick on me?\" The Matriarch shuddered, as pulled a tent sheet to cover her, and the mouse blew his finger in his mouth to creating a whizzing sound, causing Catty to clutch on to the pole tightly. He continued to make faces to scare them more as they climbed up higher and higher on the poles and ladders. \"A proud race?\" the mouse said sarcastically as he mocked them. \"Overstuffed hay bags!\" He then turned away to leave, chuckling and the elephants slowly climbed down hoping they would be safe. \"Boo!\" The mouse turned himself around and faced them again looking like a seventeenth century general and scared the elephants to climbing back up again. She then hid herself in the shadows of the tent, before the mouse could come out and see her. \"Still afraid of a mouse?\" he chuckled to himself. \"Oh boy, wait 'til I tell the little guy, where is he?\" She looked near a pile of a hay to see a little trunk sticking out, and recognized it as Dumbo's, and he was hiding in there. The mouse came up to him. \"Hey Dumbo,\" he tapped the trunk. \"You can come out now.\" Dumbo flinched and pulled his trunk into the hay. \"Golly, maybe I scared him too,\" the mouse said to himself, he turned to Dumbo and tried to get him to trust him. \"Look Dumbo, I'm your friend. Come on out, won't ya?\" Dumbo shook in the hay, back and forth, and refused to come out. \"You're not really afraid of little me, are ya?\" The hay shook up and down, as if the calf said, yes. \"Ya are?\" the mouse asked as if he was hurt. \"Must've over did it in there, don't know my strength sometimes.\" He came up with an idea, and took off his hat with a peanut balancing on his head, and held it in his gloved paws. \"Dumbo, look what I got for ya.\" Dumbo's trunk slowly came out and his proboscis sniffed the fresh scent and reached for it as the mouse backed away. \"Ah-ah-ah!\" he took the peanut away. \"Ya gotta come out first.\" But Dumbo sucked the peanut with his proboscis and snorted out the shell before eating the nuts. \"Too bad you don't trust me,\" the mouse said as he walked away kicking the peanut shells. \" 'Cause I thought that, uh, well, maybe you and me, and the goyle we might get your mother out of the clink…\" At the mention of getting his mother out, Dumbo poked his head out to see the mouse more clearly. Sandy's eyes brightened at the sight. \"But, I guess you wouldn't be that interested, so long Dumbo,\" the mouse walked off whistling the Casey Junior song to himself. Dumbo came out of the hay and stopped the mouse by picking him up by the tail. The mouse stopped whistling and turned to him smiling. \"Well, that's more like it,\" Dumbo leaned in towards him curiously. \"Ya know, your ma ain't crazy. She's just broken hearted, it ain't noboby's fault you got them big ears.\" When the mouse mentioned that, the poor calf covered his face with his ears. Sandy gasped and came out from the shadows. \"Excuse me,\" she said sternly. \"Are you offending him like the other boys and the elephants earlier?\" The mouse turned towards the giant girl towering over him and jumped back. \"Uh-oh,\" he said. \"Pardon me miss, but what I mean to say is, I just stepped in it that time.\" \"Is this an interrogation?\" \"It's called an honest mistake.\" \"You're not mocking him?\" Sandy was a little surprised by the mouse. \"Of course not, watch me,\" he said and he came towards Dumbo and spoke underneath his ears. \"Aw, gee Dumbo. I think you're ears are beautiful.\" Dumbo poked out his face as if he were not offended and to see if the mouse meant it. \"You don't mind his ears?\" the girl asked. \"Sure,\" he said to her and the baby elephant as he looked at them. \"As a matter of fact I think they're very decorative. Ya know, lots of people with big ears are famous.\" \"No worries Dumbo,\" Sandra got on her knees and stroked his head. \"Your ears are nothing to be ashamed of.\" \"She's right, oh, I guess we forgot to introduce ourselves,\" the mouse, said. \"Name's Timothy. Timothy Q. Mouse.\" \"I'm Sandra, Sandra May Williams,\" she said shaking his paws. \"My friends call me Sandy.\" \"Nice to meet ya,\" he said and hopped onto the girl's palm. \"Hey ain't ya the girl who got conked from the fiasco earlier.\" She sighed sadly, \"Yes, I got knocked unconscious from one of the workers. It was not fun, and my uncle didn't get me arrested.\" She turned to Dumbo. \"I'm sorry Dumbo, this wasn't supposed to happen, but I went to your mother and promised her that I'll look after you and keep you safe until she's set free.\" Dumbo smiled at the girl and stroked her cheek gently with his proboscis. \"We'll have to find away to set your mother free, if we could prove my uncle was wrong about you and her.\" \"Oh boy,\" Timothy said excitedly as he hopped off of the girl and ran on Dumbo's trunk. \"All we gotta do is build an act, make you a star, the headliner!\" he ran to the tip with a shout. \"Dumbo the Great…..\" He then paused. \"Uh-oh the great what?\" Sandy slumped her shoulders in disappointment, and Dumbo lowered Timothy and held the mouse's tail following him. \"Ya know Dumbo and Sandy, we gotta get an idea,\" he said. \"Not just any idea. Something colossal, like, uh….\" \"Have I got an idea!\" the light flashed on in a tent and the trio saw the Ringmaster walking in with one of the workers. \"What an idea!\" \"Hmmm, I wonder what Uncle Harold is up to this time?\" Sandy mused. She knew it was wrong to eavesdrop, but she decided to listen to his idea, she and her friends tiptoed near the tent and watched the silhouettes moving on the screen. \"Huh, he never had an idea in his life,\" Timothy said. \"Just visualize, one elephant climbs up on top of another elephant,\" the Ringmaster said undressing him self and putting on his nightgown. \"Until finally, all seventeen elephants have constructed an enormous pyramid of pachyderms! I step out! I blow the whistle!\" Sandy felt excitement building up in her soul at her uncle's idea of the performance. \"Yeah!\" Timothy agreed. \"The trumpets are trumpeting!\" \"Yes!\" Sandy agreed. \"And now COMES THE CLIMAX! \" then the moment was frozen as if the Ringmaster had no next step for the plan. \"Yeah? What is the climax?\" Joe asked like a dumb person. \"Hmmm, I don't know,\" the Ringmaster shrugged. \"Well, that was some idea,\" Sandy said sarcastically. She slumped her shoulders again in disappointment. \"I knew he had nuthin',\" Timothy grumbled sitting down. \"Aside from the climax, I hope your daughter is all right,\" Joe said. \"She had quite an injury, and it's a relief she survived.\" \"Oh no, Joe,\" the Ringmaster said. \"She's my niece, my brother's daughter actually. She's eighteen years old and indeed a strange one, than my nephews. Her late mother was a strange woman when I first met her back before the depression, and my brother was madly in love with her. Like him, she is mostly around animals all the time, and performs plant remedies. But as soon as Sandy recovers, she'll be back to performing.\" \"When will the climax come?\" \"Well, maybe it comes to me, in a vision, while I dream,\" Harold said as he got into bed. \"Good night Joe.\" \"Good night, Boss,\" the worker said turning out the lights. \"Climax,\" Timothy wanted to understand what the Ringmaster meant to say. \"CLIMAX! Dumbo you're a climax!\" Dumbo smiled at the thought. \"Are you sure this will work Timothy?\" Sandy asked. \"Sure, Sandy,\" the mouse said. \"Dumbo could run out from the tent and jump on a springboard and land on the top! That will be the PERFECT CLIMAX!\" \"I think I'm starting to understand,\" Sandy grinned and knelt down to Dumbo. \"But how are we going to convince my Uncle about this?\" \"Leave it to me!\" Timothy said. \"I have the perfect idea! Wait here Dumbo, I'll be back in a minute, Sandy and I are both gonna take care of your future.\" \"I'll come with you,\" Sandra lifted the mouse in her palm and they snuck up to the tent and hid behind ropes and poles. The girl knelt by her uncle's tent and set Timothy down. \"Be careful Timothy,\" Sandy whispered. \"My uncle may not be much of a heavy sleeper. But try not to make so much noise.\" Timothy nodded in understanding, and he crawled underneath the fold of the tent and hid when the man snored loud. He came out from his hiding place with a mischievous grin, Sandy watched from underneath as Timothy's shadow danced on the Ringmaster. Timothy stood on top of his box-chest, and snuck up to him. The mouse picked up a key and banged it against his pocket watch, creating a clanging sound. He got underneath a sheet, and pretended to be a ghost. He snuck up to the Ringmaster's ear. \"I am the voice of your subconscious mind, your inspiration. Now, concentrate,\" the Ringmaster snored and Timothy hid, before continuing. \"Remember? Your pyramid of elephants… are standing in the ring waitin' for a climax.\" \"Climax,\" the Ringmaster muttered in his sleep. \"You are now gettin' that climax,\" Timothy said. \"Climax,\" the man talked in his sleep. Sandy slowly started to giggle at Timothy's humorous convincing of the climax and talking to her uncle in his sleep. \"How's the reception?\" the mouse asked in the man's ear as he kept muttering. \"Comin' thought okay? Good.\" \"Suddenly, from the sidelines, comes your climax,\" Timothy raised his voice. Sandra gasped, thinking Harold will wake up soon. But the man turned over in his sleep, and the mouse jumped on the rim of his hat. \"Climax…\" \"Galloping across the arena. He jumps from a springboard, to a platform. At the very pinnacle of your pyramid, he waves a flag….\" He hung from the rim to shout in the man's ear and waved his hat. \"For a glorious finish!\" \"Finish?\" the Ringmaster turned in his sleep \"And who is your climax?\" Timothy spoke in the man's ear. \"The little elephant with the big ears! The world's mightiest, midget, mastodon! Dumbo!\" Timothy ran away and hid repeating Dumbo's name. \"Dumbo,\" he said behind the pocket watch. \"Dumbo,\" the Ringmaster said. \"Dumbo,\" Timothy repeated lowered himself from the chest. \"Dumbo,\" the man raised his hands. \"Dumbo,\" Timothy repeated hiding in his hung up trousers' pocket. Sandy backed away, and listened. \"Dumbo,\" Harold repeated and woke up. \"I got it! I got it!\" On cue, Sandy sprinted away from the tent before her uncle could see her. She reached her tent and found Dumbo sitting at the front. Timothy caught up and told him everything, the baby elephant smiled in excitement. \"Well, Dumbo, we convinced the Ringmaster, and boy is he in for a surprise,\" Timothy chuckled. \"Let's hope,\" Sandy said. \"Let's get some sleep. You guys could sleep in my tent.\" Sandy made a matchbox bed for Timothy and allowed Dumbo to sleep near her feet on her bed. The next week will be a very big one. Sandy finally meets Timothy, and they work together to make Dumbo a star and get his mother out of prison. They gave the Ringmaster an idea to make Dumbo the climax of his pyramid. The next chapter will have a flashback of Sandy's past, and we will find out what happened to her mother...[Chapter 7] The sun shone throughout the landscape, making the grass turn into the color of gold. In a small jeep, two people sat in it, a woman with blonde hair and brown eyes drove, wearing a white shirt, a dark vest, tan pants, and black boots, a simple necklace hung from her neck focused on her driving, while a younger girl with mid length blonde hair, wore a white shirt, a locket, a brown skirt, a red headband, and laced up boots. The girl stood up in the jeep feeling the wind blowing into her hair, and grinned as she lifted up her arms. \" Sandy could you sit down please?\" Katherine Williams asked as she drove. \"You don't want to get yourself hurt.\" \" Yes, Momma,\" the girl said and sat down. The day was more than perfect, and the sky was clear and blue as sapphires. The clouds were as pure and white as the fresh snow on Mount Kilimanjaro. In the distance, a group of zebras, giraffes, gazelles, and wildebeests were grazing in the grasslands as the wind blew in the breeze. Elephants were walking in the scene as graceful as they huddled close to each other in the herd. Sandy and her mother were the only ones riding in the family jeep, at the same time her father and brothers were back at the camp to spend time together to study the lions, cheetahs, and rhinos. They came to a stop to stretch for a while. The girl took out her camera and took many pictures to put into her scrapbook for journeying in the country. \" I can't wait to put these photos in my collection,\" she said proudly. \"Oh how I love Africa.\" \" I know dear,\" her mother smiled and placed her hands on her daughter's shoulders with kind brown eyes. \"Sandra, do you know how proud I am of you?\" \" Well, to be honest, yes and no,\" she replied. \" Dear, I always knew that you'd be destined for great things,\" Katherine kissed her forehead. \"You followed in my footsteps to accept your Wiccan heritage and learn the ways of speaking to the animals. I knew that the Goddess knew your blessings and bestowed your gift on you.\" \" Thank you Momma,\" Sandra hugged her mother, and she hugged the girl back. \"I love you.\" \" I love you too sweetie,\" Katherine said holding the girl close to her chest. \"No matter what, you'll always be in my heart.\" As if their loving moment was strong and will never stop, a squealing trumpet voice broke the silence. Both mother and daughter broke their hug and looked over to see where the sound was coming from. A baby African elephant was seen and he was struggling to break free. They came from out of the grass to see why he was stuck. His leg was caught in a wired snare, and it was tied to a small tree. \" Oh no,\" Sandy cried. \"This poor baby elephant! I have to save him!\" Before she could run out, her mother grabbed her hand and stopped her. \" Careful Sandra,\" Katherine warned her. \"It's a poacher's trap, it means that poachers are nearby. We have to avoid them at all costs.\" \" But Momma,\" the girl begged. \"There's no way I'm leaving that baby elephant caught in the trap and ends up getting killed as a trophy. I can't to let an elephant family lose a baby, and start to mourn it. What would you do if me or James, or Robert get caught? Would you save us, or abandon us?\" \" I'd save you and your brothers of course,\" her mother replied reluctantly. \"But let's rescue him quickly and head for home.\" Sandra and Katherine snuck up from the grass and slowly came to the poor calf. When he saw both the woman and girl coming up to him, he flinched in fear and tried to run again, only for him to trip over his feet. \" Don't be afraid,\" the woman said gently. \"I promise we mean no harm.\" \" We're going to set you free,\" Sandy said. Her mother stroked the calf calmly as the girl reached into her side bag and pulled out a pair of pliers. She clamped them down on the wires and pressed hard as she could to cut the cord. The wire was strong and sturdy, but after five struggling minutes, the wire snapped and broke in half. \" Yes!\" the girl was filled with relief. \"Run now, you're free!\" The calf smiled as he moved his back leg, her mother untied the wire wrapped around his leg and the calf jumped around freely. He looked back and trumpeted thanks to them. \" Come on Sandy,\" Katherine said. \"We must leave and head for home, before someone comes and….\" \" Not quite,\" a cruel British voice said. Sandy froze in fear and turned around with her mother to see a man glaring at them with an evil grin. He was dressed in a hunter's suit and held an enormous rifle in his hands. A poacher…. Sandy thought as she hissed at him. \" I see you've ruined my game and set my trophy free, thanks to you!\" he said harshly. \" Please sir,\" Katherine begged. \"Just let us go, and we won't go into your games again.\" \" Don't even think about hurting those animals, that elephant was just a baby!\" Sandy snapped. \" Shut up you little brat!\" the poacher snapped, causing the girl to flinch. \" Don't talk to my daughter that way!\" her mother yelled. \"If you want her, you'll have to go through me!\" \" Well, I guess I'll have to kill both of you,\" he loaded up his rifle and aimed it towards Sandy. \" Please, don't kill us!\" she cried. \" Sandy run!\" her mother bellow as she threw a rock at the poacher, without wasting a moment, both mother and daughter ran for their lives. \" Faster Sandy, faster!\" Katherine cried as the gunshots were shot in the air as loud as thunder. \"Keep running! Keep running!\" The girl ran as the adrenaline pumped through her veins as her legs carried her over the ground, she stubbed her foot on a branch and tripped. The impact scraped her knees and she struggled to get up to run again; but as she would speed up again. A hand grabbed her wrist and she faced the poacher. \" Now that I have you,\" he shoved her to the ground near a rock. \"I'll take you as my trophy.\" The man aimed his rifle towards her, with the barrel near her heart. The girl flinched in fear as she prepared for the shot to end her life, but suddenly the poacher gasped and Sandra looked up to see her mother struggling with the man. \" Get away from her!\" she shouted. \"Take me instead!\" The poacher shoved the woman to the tree and aimed his rifle at her. Then as if time froze and quickly sped up, three shots were fired towards Katherine. The girl screamed in horror of the terrifying moment. \" MOMMA! MOMMA! NOOOOOO!\" The blonde girl tossed and turned in her sleep, trying to fight off the nightmare. She shot up from her bed and screamed, and her eyes were widened as big as saucers. She looked around and remembered that she was in her tent. She took deep breaths and wrapped her arms around her legs. She dug her face into her knees and began to sob, trying to relieve the memory of the traumatic experience. \"Sandy? Are you okay there?\" a little voice said. She looked down to see Timothy standing on her foot, and his face was filled with concern. Dumbo woke up and looked at her curiously. \"Oh Timothy,\" she scooped up the mouse in her palms and hugged him close to her chest. \"It was awful.\" \"Was it a nightmare?\" he asked hugging her sternum. Dumbo came towards her and stroked her cheek. \"More than that,\" she said releasing him from the hug and petted Dumbo. \"It was a memory that really happened in the past. A very traumatic experience.\" \"Whoa,\" he said, as the girl placed him on her knee. \"It's okay, you can tell me anything, I'm here for ya.\" \"It happened when I was twelve years old, my mother and I were on a safari ride in Africa, having the best time of our lives. We then saw a baby African elephant caught in a snare, and it was set up by a poacher.\" \"Poacher? What's a poacher?\" \"A poacher is similar to a hunter, but he hunts for animals and fish illegally,\" Sandy's eyes darkened. \"They are merciless, unkind, and heartless savages, and they never care about the animals having a soul.\" \"Huh? I know it may be sensitive, but what happened to your mother?\" Timothy's eyes widened in compassion and pity. \"I wanted to free that baby elephant, but Momma warned me about poachers and it would not be safe, we did it reluctantly and set it free. Just as we were about to head home, a poacher appeared, the one who caught the baby elephant. He was upset at us for freeing his trophy. He decided to kill us, I managed to run away while my mother threw a rock at him and tried to shoot us. He then caught up with me and was about to kill me, but my mother fought him off, and then…. Then….\" Sandy burst into tears again and dug them in her hands. \"He killed her!\" she cried. \"That monster killed Momma in front of me!\" \"Oh Sandy,\" Timothy was filled with emotion. \"I'm so, so, sorry, I didn't know….\" \"I know, after killing my mother, he attempted to kill me again, but the rangers, even my family arrived. The poacher tried to get away, but they caught up and arrested him. I should've been relieved, but it was my entire fault, since that fateful day, I blamed myself for her death. If that baby elephant was not caught in the snare, my mother would've still been here today.\" \"Sandy, this wasn't your fault,\" Timothy said. \"You didn't know what was comin', you took a risk to free that elephant, and your ma saw your compassion on freeing it. Did your father and brothers blame you for it?\" \"No, they never did, and keep reminding me that it was the poacher's fault. Not mine.\" \"See?\" he said. \"That means that they truly love you, and know how strong you are to take a risk.\" \"Thank you,\" Sandy gave a small smile. \"Does your Uncle know about it?\" \"No, he doesn't. I made it up that she was killed in a car accident because I was too ashamed of the real truth. I don't know how he would react.\" \"Well, no matter what happens, maybe he will understand.\" \"I guess,\" Sandy sighed. \"Why did he kill your mother, and why would he try to kill that elephant?\" \"I don't know, maybe it was because he never understood what the meaning of life was. Back in Asia and Africa, poachers have hunted elephants for trophy, game, and their ivory tusks. They never learn of their mistakes of taking away an innocent life of an animal.\" \"Oh boy,\" Timothy shook his head. She reached over to her nightstand and picked up her locket. She opened it to show the picture of Katherine to her friends. \"This was my Mother, she gave me this locket as a present for my twelfth birthday, and placed a photograph of her in there. So whenever I wear this, I feel that she is with me, no matter wherever I go. She loved animals very much and dreams of being reincarnated into a gazelle, otherwise she would've chosen the wrong spiritual animal,\" she said. \"Oh your Ma is somethin',\" Timothy said looking at the photograph. \"I'm sorry again about her.\" Sandy sighed as she closed her locket, and placed it back on her nightstand. She looked back to the mouse, allowing him to walk onto her palm. \"It's okay. Aside from that, I hope the governments will protect these amazing creatures, and make sure they will not go extinct. I also want to open an elephant reserve to keep them safe and give them a better life, if I retire from the circus of course.\" \"You have a strong sense of animal feelings Sandy, it may not show to others, but I never met one that cares a lot about 'em. You're a strong, wise, and caring young woman.\" \"Thank you Timothy,\" she kissed his forehead. \"And thank you Dumbo.\" She stroked his head and the elephant hugged her arm, and the girl took deep breaths to relax and relieve her pacing heart. After a moment of comforting the blonde and helping her; she, the mouse, and the calf went back their beds and went straight back to sleep.[Chapter 8] The next morning, the ringmaster told the whole circus including his niece, about the elephant pyramid in hopes that it will ease the audience from the 'mad elephant' scare. Sandra smiled and prayed that this idea would work and hopefully release Mrs. Jumbo and make Dumbo a star. In order to distract herself from her head injury, she would read her favorite book, Black Beauty and perform her rituals. After resting for a week from the incident, the girl was ready to go back to performing. Sandy had Dumbo and Timothy by her side whenever she works and ties a sash around her waist for the baby elephant to hold onto, with the mouse sitting in her apron pocket. She walked to a water pump to carry more water to offer to the elephants, as she filled the bucket, she listened to the workers and clowns talking about her behind her back. \"Look, it's the witch along with the little freak,\" Jock the clown said. He was dragging on a cigarette and exhaled the smoke. He and the other clowns were sitting at their table drinking, eating, and smoking during their break from training. \"I heard that she performs some sort of ritual in the morning creating dark spells,\" said Charlie. \"I heard the boss said that her mother was a witch and curses dumb animals to obey her,\" Hank said. \"And he didn't can me from striking her when that elephant went wild.\" Sandy shot her head up and her eyebrows furrowed in annoyance. She took a deep breath to control her temper, as she rolled her eyes. So he's the one who bopped me on the head! She thought. \"Hey, be careful,\" Ben, another clown who was dumb but sympathetic, said. \"She can hear you from over there.\" \"Oh women, they ain't have feelin's and are too sensitive!\" Greg said. \"They are so dumb, just like dumb blondes and cookie cutters! Even elephants are all made out of rubber, and are good enough to be hanged on walls with other dirty creatures, are worth a fortune!\" From hearing that offensive joke, all the workers started to laugh loudly. Sandy growled in irritation and marched over to the table with a sharp glare as Dumbo followed her. She banged her fist on the table, silencing the clowns and employees from laughing. \"Shut up you hooligans! You dare to insult me and my mother!?\" she snapped. \"Well, there are a few things you should know about me! First of all, I am a Wiccan, not a witch, a Wiccan. Did you also know that the term 'witch' comes from 'Wicca?' A Wiccan only performs rituals for healing and prays to the God and Goddess. Second of all, I suggest you keep those words in your traps, and I'd stop spreading those stupid rumors around here if I were you. Last, but not least, and third of all, they are not true! If I hear another peep or a rumor from you blokes, you are gonna regret it when you face my wrath!\" After giving them another glare, she stormed away from them clutching the thin metal handle in her calloused palm as the calf followed her with his head down. She halted for a moment and turned back towards them. \"Oh and one more thing and you better listen you meatheads; poaching is illegal! Those animals are like us, they have feelings, emotions, and they understand us! If you kill an animal without thinking clearly, you are murderers!\" The clowns flinched back from her warning, and kept their glares firm. She slowly walked away, and despite the warning she gave them, the clowns and workers went back to their business and continued to laugh. \"I guess those elephants were right,\" she murmured. \"The whole circus is now spreading rumors about me.\" \"Boy, those dopey clowns weren't kiddin' 'bout ya,\" Timothy said as he climbed up to her shoulder. \"I wonder where they get them ideas.\" \"Who knows?\" Sandy said sighing. \"All they do is make up a bunch of silly lies and superstitions, but for now, it's best of me to ignore them.\" \"Well, let's hope,\" Timothy said. \"Don't listen to what they say about you.\" Sandy then felt a tug on her sash, she turned back to see Dumbo pointing his proboscis towards the 'Mad Elephant' wagon. The girl knelt to his height as she looked at him with sad eyes. \"I'm so sorry Dumbo,\" she said sadly, but kindly. \"I admit I want to take you to see your mother. But we are forbidden from going near her, if my uncle or the workers catch us, we'll be in big trouble or worse get punished.\" Dumbo sighed in disappointment as he looked down sadly, as tears poured down his face. The girl took out her handkerchief as she wiped away the calf's tears. \"I know how you feel Dumbo,\" she said. \"But as I've said before, I promised your mother that I will protect you. No matter what happens, I'll never let anyone harm you as long as I'm here. If I have the chance, I promise I'll take you to see your mother.\" Dumbo nodded at the girl and gave a sad smile. The trio continued to walk around and followed Sandy into the elephant tent. The calf hid behind her back to stay safe from the elephants and Timothy hid in the girl's pocket to prevent another scare. \"All right girls,\" she said sarcastically. \"Here is your water and hay.\" The elephants stood near her as the blonde filled their trough from her water bucket, and held their heads up in pride. \"It's about time,\" the Matriarch said rudely. \"We were waiting for over ten minutes!\" \"And Dumbo has slowed you down from completing your chores and goofing off!\" Prissy snorted. \"I am quite surprised that the Ringmaster has decided to let Dumbo be part of the our elephant pyramid climax by standing on the platform, I'm holding! This I gotta see!\" Giddy laughed. Sandy rolled her eyes at their mean comments on her and continued to give them hay and water. Dumbo cowered behind her in fear of the other elephants insulting her and him also. \"So how's your hocus-pocus going?\" Catty mocked. \"Have you turned anyone into frogs? Even Dumbo?\" The elephants began to laugh at the girl, as the workers did earlier. Sandra glared at them all and growled in anger. \"Why don't you all keep those harsh words to yourselves and leave me alone!\" she shouted as the elephants flinched back from her temper. \"I also demand that you leave Dumbo alone, and it was not his fault that his mother got locked up! So quit making rude comments on him, and don't spread anymore rumors on me!\" The girl stormed away from the tent as Dumbo held onto the sash and she took more deep breaths to calm down. \"Take it easy Sandy,\" she said to herself. \"Take it easy, take it easy, and take it easy.\" \"Pfft! Those elephants should be ashamed of themselves for pickin' on ya and Dumbo,\" Timothy scoffed as he crossed his arms. \"I don't know why they would act like that, but I guess that's the way they are,\" she looked down to see Dumbo's eyes filled with tears again. \"Never mind what the others say about you Dumbo, only listen to your heart and ears, they are your special gifts.\" She looked back at the elephant tent where the other elephants were still gossiping and her smile was spreading with mischief. \"Hey Timothy,\" Sandy whispered to the mouse. \"Do you think you can do me a favor?\" \"Anything Sandy,\" he said saluting to the girl. \"Do you think you can 'reintroduce' yourself to them again?\" she asked pointing to the tent. Timothy nodded and knew very well what she meant to say. Sandy knelt down to let the mouse walk towards the tent, and he disappeared. A moment later, there were screams and trumpet sounds all around the tent as the girl covered her mouth as she smirked. She saw the animal tamers running in to calm them down and hid so she could watch. After five minutes, the mouse came back with his head held high and smirked in satisfaction. \"I'm back Sandy,\" Timothy said proudly. \"I guess they deserved another lesson.\" The girl held out her hand and the mouse hopped onto her palm. \"Thanks Timothy,\" she said smiling, she then remembered. \"Oh, that reminds me, I better get to training for my performance.\" The three friends rushed to the girl's private tent, and took deep breaths. While Timothy and Dumbo laid on her bed, the young woman got dressed for her training. Minutes later, Sandy stepped out from her dressing room, wearing a teal leotard with a short translucent skirt, grey tights, and black flats. \"Gosh, Sandy,\" Timothy said. \"You look great!\" \"Thanks Timothy,\" she said blushing. \"I'll be back in a few hours, you and Dumbo can rest in my tent.\" The girl ran out of her tent, she headed straight to the practice ring and looked around to see the performers, clowns, and animal trainers training themselves and other animals to get ready for their performing acts. The girl looked up to see the trapeze bars hanging above the platform, along with the acrobats swinging in the air. She began to do her warm-ups by stretching her arms to reach to her toes, reaching over to her sides to loosen her ribs as they stretched apart. The girl noticed the tall ladder that stood up high to the platform and slowly walked towards it. She gripped on the metal bars and slowly began to climb up, as she got a little higher, she looked down and slowly felt uncomfortable. Her vision suddenly doubled up, her legs shook, and her heart began to beat faster in her chest, and breathed faster. Without urging herself to fall, she immediately climbed back down and took deep breaths to calm herself down. In order to distract herself, she looked over to the ropes and thought they would be a good start. The blonde grabbed one rope and began to climb up as she were a spider crawling up its' silk. Her calf wrapped around the rope as she nimbly pulled herself up until she came up to a comfortable height. She grasped the noose on the rope as she placed one foot on it and let her other leg and arm out as she gave a slow spin. After spinning around for a few moments, she slowly placed her left foot in the knot and let her other right foot on the rope. She gave a graceful swan pose as she slowly spun around. She breathed in and out from her lungs as she slowly moved her arms in an exotic way. \"Not bad,\" a voice said. The girl looked over to see Harold coming towards her watching her poses on the rope. \"How do I look?\" she asked as she slowly grasped the rope and spun around. \"Very exquisite, but maybe you could take in the spinning a little more,\" the Ringmaster stated. \"Why don't I help you out?\" \"That's kind of you, but I think I got it,\" Sandy said. \"Oh no, I insist,\" Harold said as he grabbed the rope. Sandy gripped the rope and got into a tight pose with her legs together. \"Take a deep breath, give it all you got!\" the Ringmaster spun the girl around on the rope, faster and faster. The faster she spun, the tighter she gripped the rope as she kept her pose straight. \"I'm getting dizzy!\" she cried. \"Let me worry about the dizziness!\" the Ringmaster called. The rope was twirling faster and faster, her vision began to double up as her brain started to hurt. Harold began to slow the rope down, and the girl slid down, trying to remain balanced as she stood still. \"Are you alright there Sandy?\" he asked. \"Yeah, I guess I'm all right,\" she tried to walk, but she toppled back sitting on the ground. \"On second thought, I'm probably gonna sit here for a while from the spinning.\" \"Of course. Speaking of spins, how come you're not on the trapeze bars?\" Sandy felt beads of sweat forming over her brows, as she felt her stomach tingling uneasily inside. \"Well…I was going to that, but I got dizzy all of a sudden, probably from that concussion…. I thought that maybe I start out with the ropes, just to be a little safe.\" \"Very well, I do hope that once your dizziness wears off, you'll be up to the trapeze bars in no time.\" \"Oh… of course… sir,\" she stammered. \"Thank…. you.\" \"You're welcome,\" the Ringmaster gave the girl a small smirk and walked off. The girl gave a sigh of relief that she was alone. After regaining her balance, she completed more ground exercises and came back to her tent. She grabbed her dinner that was only a salad, some fruit, a tin of peanuts and a glass of water, with tea. She looked in to see Timothy and Dumbo playing together, just as the day when she was playing with him and his mother. \"Hey guys,\" she said. \"Oh hey Sandy,\" Timothy said. Dumbo came up to her and stood up on his hind legs. Sandy knelt down and gave him a kiss on the forehead. \"How was training?\" \"Not bad, but at least I'm getting a good start. I brought some food, I thought you'd like to share some with me.\" \"Thanks Sandy,\" Timothy said. He and Dumbo came up and Sandy gave them some fruit, peanuts and she ate her salad. She looked around her tent to see the photographs of her family and the adventures she went on. \"You have quite a collection of pictures there Sandy,\" Timothy said, staring at the photos. \"Oh thank you, I always bring my photos with me whenever I travel. It brings me back the great memories to remind me that I did great things in the past and how they helped me move forward. It makes me happy to see my family and friends in these, no matter where I go.\" \"Sounds swell to have your family to think of, I wish my family was here too.\" The trio continued to eat their meal, as they slowly lost interest in the conversation. Sandra watched as the sun set below the buildings, allowing to feel the spring breeze come into her tent, and listened to the radio playing music. She gave a sigh, as spring was her favorite season. She pulled out her book and read to the part of when Black Beauty and Ginger were forced to hold their heads up high by the bearing rein, and Ginger lost her temper to rebel. Sandy remembered that her mother would read this book to her all the time, and became her most favorite book. \"Say Sandy,\" Timothy spoke up. Sandra looked back down to watch the mouse crawl up on her chair and sat on her lap, breaking the shell off the peanut. \"Yes, Timothy?\" she asked putting her book down. \"I know that we've met last week, but there's somethin' I've been wonderin', how did you become a Wiccan? And what brought you to the circus?\" Timothy asked as he chewed a peanut. The girl gave a sigh and began her story. \"Well, I guess my story is long and complicated; my mother was a Wiccan Priestess and my father was Catholic, they've known each other when they were younger and lived in New Hampshire. They were close friends and went to school together, and as they grew older, they fell in love. Well, my father's family doubted on him about marrying a Wiccan, since they are both from two religions, they learned to respect each others' beliefs and practices and were able to let them go into marriage. Later on, my brothers and I were born. We followed our parent's beliefs and practices to be both Catholics and Wiccans. For Wiccans, we follow a certain code in the Rede that states, 'An if harm done, do what thou will.'\" \"Huh? You're an extraordinary person Sandy, having two parents from different religions and followed 'em both? What is a purpose for them Wiccans?\" \"Well, on my mother's side, every generation has brought down the Wicca religion and it's in their blood and mine. Wiccans are the co-creators of life, we are the manifestations of the One, and all hold the power to access the Creative Force, to exercise it in reality. However, many of them have the innate ability to work magick and they were conceived and born as magickal beings. In fact, I was born a magical being when I came into the world, and when I turned two, I discovered that I can communicate with animals verbally. I was shocked at first, and I later came to accept this gift. \"Even my brothers can speak to animals too, and we were all given a practice to serve in this world, we have the power to heal ourselves on every level, live a fulfilling and glorious life, the power to heal the world, and to experience and liberate the Divine within. My purpose here on this Earth is to bring love, peace, and heal the soul and spirit of life.\" \"Gosh, I never knew Wiccans have so much to do in their lives, I should pay a little bit more attention to religions and beliefs,\" Timothy said smiling. Dumbo came towards the girl and laid his head in her lap, she stroked the baby elephant gently and gave a comforting smile. \"About what brought me to the circus is that my uncle offered me the position of an acrobat because, when I wasn't studying elephants in Africa, I'd go to a school where they train circus performers and I came to swing on the trapeze bars when I was a teenager, however I got into an accident, so I did other performances. My uncle saw me perform and thought I'd be a great performer. At first I was hesitant, but I gave in. Maybe that's what brought me here to this circus, to protect Dumbo and other from evil and harm. So what brought you to the circus Timothy?\" \"Well, I've been livin' in the circus for three years and even though being in one ain't easy. I've got used to runnin' around and lookin' for peanuts. Until I met you and Dumbo, you guys are kinda like me, strange but special.\" \"Timothy, there is something that is always at the back of my mind, why did you stood up for Dumbo?\" \" 'Cause when I was a youngster, I used to think about looks and how they're odd. But my Ma told me never to make fun of people's or animal's appearances and look beneath their insides. I never found anything wrong with Dumbo, and I thought I'd stick by his side, even yours.\" \"Well, thank you for standing up to those elephants,\" Sandy said. \"I do hope things will change soon, for the better.\" Happy New Year everyone, it took me a little while to write this chapter. I did some research on Trapeze swingers and on the Wicca Religion. Magic in the religion is actually called, \" magick.\" The rope dance Sandy did is from another circus movie I watched from 1956 is called \"Trapeze\" and it's an interesting movie. Next up, will be the Pyramid of Pachyderms.[Chapter 9] Opening night for the Pyramid of Pachyderms came and the whole tent was crowded as many visitors were excited to see this new act with the elephants. As the show started, Sandy was back wearing her circus outfit and watched from behind the curtain with Timothy and got Dumbo ready for his climax. She listened and watched as the Ringmaster introduced the act to the audience with the elephants circling around him and the small red ball. \"Ladies and gentlemen!\" The ringmaster announced. \"We will now present for your entertainment... the most stupendous, magnificent... super-colossal spectacle. On this tiny little, insignificant ball... We will construct for you a pyramid, not of wood, not of stone...\" As he spoke, the elephants were growing impatient with his speech and wanted him to end this chattering soon. They did not want to do the pyramid, but they had no choice but to obey him. \"To hear him talk, you think he was going to do it,\" Catty whispered. \"But a living, breathing….\" He continued as the Matriarch agreed in irritation. \"The stuffed shirt.\" \"Pyramid of ponderous, pulsating, pulchritudinous pachyderms!\" he said smoothing down his rolled up collar. \"I give you the elephants.\" He blew his whistle and the elephants stood on their hind legs, they walked in a line and prepared to climb up as music played. The Matriarch climbed up on the ball and nearly toppled, but she remained balanced. She reached her trunk back and pulled Prissy up on her back, and she landed on the older elephant. \"Aren't we a bit clumsy?\" she complained as she moved Prissy up. The younger elephant pulled Catty up and went under her to prevent the green wearing elephant from falling as her rear end landed on her face. \"Gaining a little weight, aren't you honey?\" Prissy complained. \"You're no cream puff yourself, dearie,\" Catty replied. \"Quiet up there! Tend to your work girls!\" The Matriarch snapped. Catty balanced herself and her trunk reached towards Libby and pulled her up by the tail. She swung around and hit Prissy nearly toppling her over and stepped into the Matriarch's eye. \"Keep your foot out of my eye! Clumsy ox!\" the elder elephant snapped glaring at Prissy. Libby balanced on Catty, and she nearly slipped causing Prissy to almost smothering the Matriarch with her rear as she huffed. \"Steady girls!\" Libby pulled up Giddy by the neck as she held the pedestal in her trunk, and she accidentally let go off the elephant, causing the audience to scream in fear. Libby caught Giddy by the tail and pulled her up again. While the elephants were building the pyramid, Timothy and Sandy kept watching as the elephants build the pyramid higher and higher. The girl felt her eyes spin as she looked up and everything began to double up. She shook her head and snapped back to attention. The blonde looked down to see the mouse on the ground with his head out. \"Boy, that was a close one,\" Timothy said as he turned back. \"Yeah,\" Sandy agreed. \"So far, so good.\" Dumbo watched his friends as he wore a blue headdress and held a little flag in his proboscis. The white flag had a 'D' stitched in. \"They're almost ready now, Dumbo. Don't forget to wave that flag,\" Timothy said. The calf waved it and smiled. \"Okay, okay, don't wave it no more, I saw ya.\" \"Okay Dumbo, here's what you got to do, you must run out from this tent and jump up on the springboard, and you'll jump up to the pedestal.\" Sandra stated. \"You think you can do it?\" The baby elephant nodded hesitantly. \"I know you're nervous, but it's time to ignore those who pick on you, and only listen to your heart. I'll always be proud of you, even your mother.\" He smiled and nodded again in understanding. \"That's my boy! All right, now show me just how you're gonna do it,\" Timothy said. Dumbo stepped back a few paces and began to practice his run. \"That's it! Atta boy! That's the stuff, come on!\" Timothy encouraged. As Dumbo ran, he tripped over his long ears and toppled forward. \"Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh! Dumbo!\" the mouse cried. \"Oh, those ears. We gotta do somethin', quick!\" \"I have an idea Timothy,\" Sandy said. She turned to Dumbo. \"I'm sorry Dumbo, I really hate to do this, but…\" Back in the ring, all of the female elephants have finally completed the pyramid, and stood up in balance. Their positions they were in were painful, as the Matriarch balanced uneasily at the bottom, while Giddy held the pedestal and got dizzy from being up so high. The ringmaster made his next announcement. \"Ladies and gentlemen, you have now seen the impossible, accomplished in front of your faces. Seven jungle giants each one weighing not six hundred pounds!\" \"That windbag!\" the Matriarch grunted as sweat formed on her forehead. \"Why doesn't he come to the point!?\" \"And now, I present the world's smallest little elephant!\" the Ringmaster continued as he reached the climax and the spotlight shone from the springboard to the top. \"Who will spring from this springboard in one spring, on top of the pyramid, waving his little flag for the climax, ladies and gentlemen… I give you… Dumbo!\" The curtains opened up to show the calf with his ears tied over his head in a knot, to prevent him from tripping. Poor Dumbo was nervous and terrified. The audience began to laugh, which made the girl glare at them, and she had no choice but to do tie up Dumbo's ears. The baby elephant backed up in fear. \"Come on Dumbo!\" Sandy whispered loudly. \"Get going!\" \"What's the matter with you? Dumbo! That's your cue!\" Timothy said, as he tried to push Dumbo out, but the calf kept backing up, as the audience laughed. Timothy pulled out a pin from his shirt and poked Dumbo's rear, and off he went! \"Timothy did you have to?\" Sandy glared at him. \"Sorry, Sandy, it was the only way.\" Timothy shrugged. They watched as Dumbo run towards the springboard along with the drum roll to jump. As the baby elephant kept running, the knot came loose and poor Dumbo tripped over his ears, flew into the air and crashed into the red ball. The Matriarch was beginning to lose her balance as the other female adult elephants came tumbling down. Sandy got out from the small tent and ran towards Dumbo, who got up from his fall and immediately he was scared. \"Oh no!\" the girl gasped as she watched in fear. The ringmaster's eyes widened in horror and fainted from shock, and Timothy hid underneath the curtain of the tent and watched with one eye opened. The audience and performers screamed as the elephants began to spin and tumble as the Matriarch ran on the ball as the elephant on top jumped over the tightrope. The eldest elephant ran and chased after Dumbo and touched his back. She removed Prissy's rear end and shouted at him, \"OUT OF MY WAY! ASSASSIN!\" Dumbo was frightened by the Matriarch's shouting and tripped over his ears again, and she crashed into him, causing all the other elephants to fly over the big top, pulling down the platforms, poles, trapeze bars, and tightropes. Sandy screamed as she ran grabbing Timothy in her hand and fled from the collapsing big top with the crowd as the lights went out. Fortunately, no one was hurt or killed, including the Ringmaster and the other workers. The girl took deep breaths as she held Timothy in her palm. Her eyes were widened in horror and her breathing was fast paced. She snapped from her thoughts and realized someone was missing. \"Wait a minute, where's Dumbo?\" she cried. \"Oh boy, he must be in the Big Top!\" Timothy exclaimed. \"We gotta find him!\" Sandy and Timothy immediately began to search across the tent \"Dumbo!\" Sandra called, running across the fallen tent. \"Dumbo? Where are you?\" She saw something crawling from underneath the fold and opened a patch and waved the broken flag. It was Dumbo! \"Oh Dumbo! Are you okay?\" she asked kneeling next to the elephant. Dumbo came out from the patch, and he nodded as he shaking in fear clutching the flag. \"It's all right, you're safe.\" Sandy hugged Dumbo in her arms as she comforted him. Shortly after the tent collapse, the Ringmaster made the decision that it was best for the circus to pack up and move to the next city in Mississippi. Sandy walked in the halls of the train, she looked out to see the rain pouring down from the dark, gray clouds, and it was enough to make anyone gloomy. As she was about to enter the room where the performers and workers sat to eat, drink, relax, and smoke, she heard the men talking that sparked her interest. \"Oh, I can't believe the Pyramid of Pachyderms was a flop!\" Jock said. \"I know, and it ain't good that the boss, had to pay for all the damages, thanks to Dumbo!\" Greg said. Sandy glared at them, and they did not see her. \"I wish I could whip that brat good and hard! He deserves a big punishment!\" Hank shouted. \"Actually Hank, it won't be necessary,\" Charlie said. \"I heard that the Ringmaster decided to make that elephant a clown.\" A CLOWN? The girl thought, as a wave a shock froze her blood. She lost in her train of thought as she stormed out towards the men. \"What in the Goddess's name did you just say?\" she snapped. The clowns and workers stared at her, not even knowing she was eavesdropping. \"Oh crud,\" Hank said. \"You didn't hear it, have you?\" \"Don't act stupid! What did you just say?\" \"Well, the boss decided to make Dumbo a clown, it's a position for making mistakes and teach him a lesson of humility,\" Ben admitted. \"You have to be joking!\" the girl shouted. \"Look broad, it ain't your business to hear out our conversations, and beef the boss about it and make him blow the fuse!\" Jock snapped. \"Don't call me that! I'm giving him a piece of mind!\" she shouted as she stormed away from the men and went straight towards Harold's office, and was ready to snap. She opened the door and glared sharp daggers at him. The man looked up and saw the angry look on the young woman's face. \"Uncle Harold what is the meaning of this?\" Sandy placed her hands on her hips. \"What do you want?\" he asked, not even caring. \"I was just minding my business and heard from the workers saying that you're making Dumbo a clown! Is this true? It can't be worse!\" \"Yes, I am making him a clown!\" The Ringmaster snapped. \"That should keep him out of trouble, ever since he came here, he caused nothing, but financial ruin and destruction!\" \"Please show him mercy! Show pity!\" she begged. \"He's gone through enough pain, and his mother has had enough of being locked away!\" \"That's enough of your whining!\" he shouted. \"I don't need your silly compassion and excuses anymore! I'm going final on my decisions and one worker told me that you've visited that Mad Elephant.\" \"What?\" her face turned pale and eyes widened. \"You know better than to disobey me!\" \"I was only checking on her and promised her I'd protect her son!\" \"You should have listened to my rules, and know what I think is best for you! That elephant could have attacked you again! You're a human, not an elephant!\" \"I know Mrs. Jumbo, better than you!\" she argued. \"Your witchcraft and rituals are a bunch of gobbledygook and it has brought a curse on me and the other animals, even the workers!\" \"ME? Bringing a curse to this circus?!\" she shouted. \"That is the most stupidest thing I have ever heard of in my entire life! Ever since I got here, everyone has been spreading nasty rumors on me for my rituals and healing! They even accused me for sorcery and witchcraft!\" \"All of those spells are a bunch of mumbo-jumbo! If you don't stop performing those rituals, I will get rid of your herbs and spell books! Dumbo is better off being a clown!\" \"Uncle Harold, you can't seriously mean this right now!\" \"The elephant will be a clown and that's that! As for you, I should have known that I shouldn't have hired you. You are a complete worthless, good-for-nothing half-breed brat of a witch! Now leave my office and give me some peace!\" he shouted in rage. Sandy felt those words stung her like pins and needles, that was the harshest and thing anyone has ever said to her in her life. If it were the worse, the meanest! \"Oh Harold,\" Sandy whispered as she held back her tears. \"How could you?\" The girl ran from the office and slammed the door hard, creating a vibration in the room. She ran past the performers and workers and wanted to head back to her cabin before anyone sees her cry. Suddenly she bumped into a worker, and it was Joe. \"Oh, Ms. Williams, I'm sorry I didn't see you comin'….\" Joe said, and he noticed the tears threatening to fall from the young woman's eyes and teeth gritted. \"Honey, what's the matter?\" \"Shut up, shut up, SHUT UP!\" the girl shouted and making the man flinch. She clutched her hand into a tight fist and threw it towards him, and he jumped out of the way as she punched into the wall, creating a hole. Joe trembled in fear from her temper, and stared at her face in horror. \"Just leave me alone!\" she yelled and ran past him. She went into her room, which was the farthest from the others. She slammed the door, got to her knees, throwing her face into her arms on her bed, and began to cry. She looked up and glared angrily as she folded her hands for another prayer. \"Curse you Harold! Curse you elephants! Curse you clowns! Curse everyone on this train! You dare to lay more abuse on Dumbo and now to me because of my sorcery? Well, I pray that the God and Goddess will find ways to end this forever and punish you as well!\" she shouted at the top of her lungs letting out her anger. She buried her face into her arms and cried, filled with more sadness. An hour passed as she continued to sob on her bed. She heard small footsteps coming towards her and nudged her on the shoulder. She looked up to see Dumbo filled with misery and regret; even Timothy rode on his hat and looked at her sadly. \"It's all my fault Dumbo and Timothy,\" she said, wiping away a tear. \"I made it all worse.\" The blonde threw her arms around Dumbo and sobbed into his shoulder. The baby elephant petted the girl's back with his trunk as tears rolled down his eyes. Timothy came up to Sandra's shoulder and patted her cheek. \"Don't take the blame Sandy,\" he said with a sad frown. \"If anything, it's my fault too. I'm the one who came up with the idea. I should've thought about the consequences.\" Before Sandy could say something, she heard footsteps coming near her room, and gasped. \"Someone's coming! Hide!\" She whispered frantically. Dumbo and Timothy hid underneath Sandy's bed and she quickly lies back on her bed pretending to be asleep. Back in the office, the ringmaster was still fuming over the argument he had with his niece. But in his heart, he felt a change of guilt and remorse; he looked down and sighed in shame at what he called her. \"Maybe I was too hard on her,\" he murmured sadly. \"How could I have hurt her feelings?\" He calmed down for an hour and thought about what he said, and realized how cruel he had been. I better check on her and apologize. Harold stood up and left his office, he passed a few of the performers and the workers, and came up to Joe. \"Excuse me Joe, have you seen Sandra?\" he asked. \"Well, she passed by half an hour ago, and I noticed that she was upset. She was almost ready to cry,\" the worker said. \"She was crying?\" Harold's eyes widened, as Joe nodded. The man gave a heavy sigh. \"We had a bit of an argument and I was extremely harsh at her. I'm going to apologize.\" \"Good luck, boss.\" Joe said. \"By the way, she punched through a wall.\" The Ringmaster looked over to where the wall was and saw a small hole in there, his eyes widened, never thinking that Sandy would be strong to punch a wall. He took a deep breath and looked at his worker firmly. \"I'll get someone to fix it,\" he said. The ringmaster walked towards the small room, and gently knocked on the door. He heard no answer, so he slowly opened the door and saw his niece lying in her bed, and she was wearing her dress and was sleeping. Her messy blonde curls were spread out on her pillow and her face was stained with tears. I did that to her, he told himself. He knelt by the bed and studied the girl's face carefully. Her bangs were hanging in front of her forehead with sweat, and the man brushed the strands from her face and ran his hand through her mid-length hair. He tenderly cupped his niece's cheek in his palm. \"I'm so sorry Sandy,\" he whispered as his gloved thumb gently dried away her tears. \"I did not mean what I said. I was upset and stressed out; I know I shouldn't have called you a half-breed to my own flesh and blood. I hope you can forgive me.\" He stared at the girl for a moment, and slowly his hand moved her bangs away to clear more of her face. He leaned forward and pressed a gentle kiss to her cheek and forehead. He noticed the locket that hung around her neck, he slowly picked it up and opened the locket to reveal a black and white picture of his late sister-in-law smiling. His eyes widened. He always wondered why the girl would wear that locket around her neck, and now he finally understood how special it was to her. \"Oh Katherine,\" he whispered. \"I hope you could forgive me for what I'm doing to your daughter. Every time I look at her, she reminds me so much of you when we were younger. I just feel heartache, when I was in love with you, but I came to realize that we wouldn't be happy together. I wanted to you to be happy and had to accept the fact that you and my brother were meant for each other. I do love Sandy, and I really miss you.\" He slowly kissed the picture firmly, and sighed. He gently released the locket and slowly closed it. He slowly stood up and watched the girl carefully. He looked around her room to notice the photographs of her family, including his brother, sister-in-law, and nephews. He gave a sigh, knowing how much she loved her family, and noticed that he was only in one photograph. Harold shook his head, and decided to head out of the room. The man bumped into her table and a book fell off landing on the ground, he knelt down and picked it up. The cover had a black horse running across a field, with a white star on his forehead. The title was written in read letters called Black Beauty. He knew it was his sister-in-law and niece's favorite book, though he didn't like reading very much. But however, it interested him so much, that he decided to borrow it for a while. He placed the book inside his coat, to cover it. He looked back to the sleeping girl, and leaned towards her. \"Sandra I hope you don't mind if I borrow your book. I promise to give it back as soon as I'm done,\" he whispered. \"I wish there was something I could do to make things right.\" The Ringmaster slowly closed the door, and went back to his car from having an exhausting and emotional day. As soon as he left, Sandy opened her eyes and her eyes widened in surprise. Dumbo and Timothy came out from under her bed and sighed in relief that they weren't seen. \"Is it just me, or did he show compassion?\" she asked. \"He was in love with my mother?\" \"Beats me, maybe he ain't so bad after all, but wait he loved your mother?\" Timothy asked. \"I know, I have to make things right with him, sooner or later. Seriously, he thinks I remind him so much of Momma? No wonder he acts bitter, but... no. I won't bring it up, I wasn't meant to hear it, otherwise I'd probably make it worse, so I won't say anything. I guess he borrowed my book, but I'll find something to manage, even my drawings.\" She turned towards the baby elephant and took his trunk into her own hand. \"Dumbo, I'm going to make sure we get you out of clown business and see your mother, but right now I'm exhausted,\" she said yawning. \"Me too,\" Timothy yawned. \"C'mon Dumbo, let's get some shut eye.\" Sandra changed into her nightgown, and pulled out another blanket to wrap it around Dumbo's little frame and he fell asleep. \"Good night my friends,\" she said. The young woman pulled over the covers and fell into a deep sleep, as it rained harder and harder. The storm allowed her to enter the land of dreams, not knowing what the future would bring her.[Chapter 10] Sandra was swinging fast on the trapeze bar as the spotlight shone on her, nearly blinding her, but she ignored it. The wind blew into the golden curls of her hair, she felt the adrenaline and blood coursing through her veins as she swung and released her hands from the bar. She flipped a quadruple somersault in the air and caught the other artist's hands. The artist swung her back and forth, he released the girl and she flipped, catching the bar. She swung and did many flips and swung back to the platform, and gave a pose. The audience gave an outstanding applause for the girl as she smiled in joy. Back on the ground, a worker was walking clumsily after drinking two beers. He stumbled over towards the cannon, where the man was to be shot and land in the net. He then grabbed the lever and set it off, causing the cannon man to fly out to the big top. Back at the top, the girl decided to swing for fun as she looked below at the audience, grinning with confidence and pride as she watched them applauding her. As she took in the sight around her, the blonde heard a boom from the ground, and something was flying towards her. \" Look out!\" a male voice cried. Sandy turned around just in time to see the cannon man coming towards her screaming and crashed into her, she grasped onto the bar holding on tight as her hands turned white. She looked above to see a wire snapping, and gave a jolt, giving the girl a scream. The audience below her screamed and gasped in panic. When the girl looked down, her blood froze to ice and her vision began to double up. \" Help! Someone help me!\" Sandy cried as her blood went cold. She looked back up to see the other wire break and without warning she fell down. She shut her eyes as her heart pounded harder and harder in her chest. She felt the rapid jolt of her landing on the net, making her stomach twist and turn in knots as she flew up and crashed onto the ground. Her head hit the hard earth as she saw blacks dots forming in her vision. As the crowd gathered around her, she tried to get up, but a sharp pain stung her leg, as it was an ugly shade of purple. The girl heard a ringing in her ears as everything went silent and black. Sandy woke up and gasped, taking deep breaths to decrease her heart rate. She looked out to see the sun crawling out from her train window and she looked over to see Timothy and Dumbo sleeping peacefully. She gave a sigh and looked up at the ceiling as the sun brightened up her room. Something told her that things are going to get worse and give Dumbo a worse fate. For the next few days, the circus arrived in Mississippi and began to set up the big top. After a few days of reconstruction, the circus was ready for another performance. Sandra avoided seeing her uncle, she was not ready to forgive him yet, and when she was asked to perform in the trapeze act, she refused to go up as she felt another wave of dizziness. The girl insisted to stick to her rope dance and it was settled. Sandy stood very still at the center of the ring, the music began to play and she began her performance. She crawled up the silk, as nimbly as a monkey. She did a few spins and twirls as she made poses. She gripped onto the noose as her legs give way out along the rope moving her legs and hands in an exotic way. She completed her dance as she ended it with a few twirls and a split. As the crowd kept cheering for her, she felt that nothing could go wrong. But suddenly, two clowns snuck up behind her and tied a rope around her waist. They signaled to the clowns near the switch and began to pull. Sandy was yanked up in the air, she was starting to go up higher and higher. \"What in the name of God?!\" she cried. \"What's going on here?\" The blonde heard laughter down on the ground and saw the clowns laughing at her hysterically, as she rose higher and higher. \"Oh, we tricked you good!\" one clown shouted. Sandra suddenly felt blood rushing into her face as she looked down, and everything started to double up. She immediately covered her eyes as the adrenaline pumped through her heart and veins. \"Oh no! Please put me down! I can't look down! Someone get me down!\" \"Hey, witch!\" another clown called. \"You know how high you are? We'll see how you like being tortured like your blood relatives as witches.\" \"Please let me down! Uncle help me!\" The lever stopped pulling her up and she was high at ninety feet. Sandy felt her emotions building up as she closed her eyes. The crowd and the clowns started to laugh as the girl was dangling in the air by her waist. \"This is not funny!\" she snapped. \"Put me down this instance! Do you hear me? Put me down! I demand that you do it right now! I'm dead serious I hate heights! Uncle Harold help me!\" One clown almost released the rope, and she let out a scream. \"AH! Stop it!\" Back on the ground, the clowns grabbed some food, pies, and water balloons and aimed them at her. \"What are you doing, you're gonna shoot food at me?\" \"Ready, aim, fire!\" Andy called and they started to pelt the stuff at the girl. A tomato was smashed in her face, then banana peels, orange peels, apple cores, and raw meat were tossed onto her dress. Larry grabbed a hose from the fire truck and shot water at the girl, soaking her. \"Humiliate the witch!\" As Sandra was lowered to the ground, she was ten feet in the air. Three clowns held spray guns and squirted glue all over her completely covering her whole body. A cannon was shot and it sprayed feathers making her look like a bird. \"Cluck like a chicken!\" Jerry yelled. \"Or it's gonna get worse!\" Sandy then clucked and more her arms as if she were a bird and the audience howled with laughter. The poor girl felt her body shut down at the sight and of the humiliation. Suddenly she fell and splashed in the pool as water filled up her nose. The clowns presented her, and the audience started to applause. Sandy got out of the water, with tears threatening to fall out of her eyes, she ran away from the clowns. She ran pass the performers and her uncle. She threw open her tent and closed it, she sat at her vanity, buried her head in her arms, and burst into tears. \"Sandy there ya are,\" Timothy climbed up to her vanity and wanted to comfort the girl. \"That was some show there.\" \"Timothy,\" Sandy said without looking up. \"I'm not in the mood.\" \"I get you're upset and all, but….\" \"But what?!\" Sandy shouted as she snapped her head. \"LOOK WHAT THEY DID TO ME?! I GOT HUMILATED AND MY UNCLE DID NOT DO ANYTHING TO STOP THIS! IS HE STUPID OR SOMETHING?\" \"Whoa, whoa,\" Timothy jumped back from her outburst. \"Take it easy there!\" \"I'm sorry Timothy,\" she sighed in remorse. \"I don't know what's wrong with me or this circus! I'm not worth this.\" \"I don't want to interrupt your sadness, but Dumbo's on after intermission.\" \"I'll be out in a little while,\" she said. She grabbed a quick cold shower and changed back into her normal outfit and followed Timothy back into the big top and watched, as the main event of the show was about to start. Sandy peered behind a curtain and saw Dumbo standing on a high platform of a cardboard house. He face was covered in white and pink make-up, along with a baby's bonnet and diaper, and he held a rattle in his proboscis. The poor baby elephant looked very ashamed. Suddenly the house burst into flames and the girl gave a scream as she watched in horror. She then saw Jock wearing a pink and blue dress and an elephant and started to run around the ring, screaming in a high-pitched voice, \"Please! Help me save my poor baby! Whoo save my child!\" An old-fashioned fire engine drive into the ring, carrying at least ten clowns dressed as firemen. As it came to a stop, all of the clowns ran around the ring and began to perform their stunts to entertain the crowd. One climbed up a mini ladder and toppled forward, another clown winded up a ladder with all of the clowns and pulled it back in as the firemen clowns fell down. Another clown grabbed a hose with a red fire hydrant, and one popped out and squirted him with his water gun. More clowns threw buckets of water at each other and even threw it in their mouths instead of on the fire. Poor Dumbo was trying his best to stay put as sweat was building up from the heat and flames. \"This is stupid! I really hate those clowns!\" she growled underneath her breath. \"Me too,\" Timothy agreed standing on her shoulder, shaking his head in guilt. One clown watered a flower and it grew big! A line of clowns came running up the ladder with buckets of water and started to splash it in Dumbo's face as they slide down, causing the audience to howl with laughter. Sandy could not bear to see this and hated this humor and abuse. One clown carried a huge red barrel with water and Jeff with the big blow up suit used a tiny plunger to drip it on the fire, and ended up getting splashed. The calf stood up on the platform as one clown came up and fanned him to keep him cool. \"Save my baby!\" Jock howled as he climbed up the ladder where the fire chief stood and the blue suited clown filled Jock's mouth with water from his flower, causing the actor to gargle the water and fall down. One clown balanced himself on a ladder roasting a hot dog, another clown put out the fire, only to make it bigger. It turned out he was using gas, and the young woman's eyes widened in horror. \"He wouldn't dare!\" she thought. As the finale came, four clowns held a trampoline over a pool of cream pie. They called Dumbo out to jump. The poor calf tried to back up, but a clown hit with a paddle from behind and made him fly into the trampoline and was covered with cream pie. The audience howled with laughter and applause as the clowns presented Dumbo. The calf only felt more shame, disgrace, and humiliation that made him drive to tears. The show was over, Dumbo walked over to Sandy and Timothy as they were full of sadness and regret. They brought him back to the girl's tent and she grabbed a bucket of water with sponges and a bar of soap. She looked up and watched the silhouettes of the clowns coming in for a break and heard them talking. \"Whew! Boy, oh, boy, did we wow 'em out there!\" \"What a performance!\" \"Are we good?\" \"Thirteen curtain calls. Thirteen!\" Joey cried. \"Yeah, sure brought down the house, all right,\" Andy said as he took off his clown mask at his vanity. \"Oh, Mama, did we panic 'em. Ask me, Joey. Go ahead. Ask me,\" Johnny said as he got off of his twin. \"You said it. We rolled 'em in the aisles,\" Joey said, high fiving his partner. \"Boy, oh, boy, what an act.\" \"Oh, 'what an act' is right,\" Jeff agreed as he deflated the clown suit. \"Stupendous, I call it.\" \"They'll have more respect for us clowns now,\" Jock said as he took off the mother elephant costume. \"Yeah, yeah, you bet,\" another agreed. \"Here boys, this calls for a real celebration! Come and get it!\" Arnold picked up a bottle of champagne and pulled out the cork and offered the drink to the clowns with their cups. \"Poison am I thirsty?\" one said. \"I could use one of them myself.\" \"This one's on Dumbo and Sandy!\" Glen said. \"Yeah, Dumbo and Sandy!\" they agreed and began to drink. While the clowns talked loudly and drank, Sandy knelt and washed a crying Dumbo gently with a soapy sponge cleaning off the cream pie and makeup, her heart was crushed from all the abuse this calf was put in. Timothy helped clean the baby elephant with a toothbrush from a bar of soap. \"See, they're drinkin' a toast to ya,\" Timothy said. \"Yeah, you're a big hit.\" Dumbo sniffed as a tear rolled down his cheek, and Timothy caught the tear with his brushed and scrubbed on the soap. \"Yeah right,\" Sandra murmured sarcastically. \"Why, uh, you're terrific,\" he scrubbed the calf's trunk. \"Oh, you're colossal, stupendous.\" Dumbo continued to sob in sorrow and pain and wiped his tears. \"I'm so sorry Dumbo,\" the girl murmured as she took out her handkerchief and gently wiped his salty tears. \"Come on, alley-oop, I gotta wash behind your ears,\" Timothy said. Dumbo raised him up on his proboscis and the mouse landed on his head and tried to cheer the calf up. \"You oughta be proud, you're a success.\" Poor Dumbo did not feel any better by the mouse's words and continued to sob out of his baby blue eyes. \"Timothy please, you're making it worse,\" Sandra said. \"It's no use, everything we try to make him a star, we always make it worse. It's hopeless!\" \"Look a peanut,\" Timothy ignored the girl. \"Come on eat it! Got lot's of vitamins.\" Dumbo was so depressed, that he kept sobbing and pulled on the grass with his proboscis. \"Give you, uh, a lot of pep.\" She looked back at the tent to see the clowns talking loudly about their performance and drinking, and talking about Dumbo and her. Sandra felt something inside of her core snap, as if a spark of fire was lit, and stood up. She threw the sponge into the bucket, took a deep breath and looked back at her friends. \"Dumbo, Timothy. Could you guys excuse me for a moment?\" \"Of course,\" Timothy said, he had a bad feeling something awful was going to happen. The elephant calf nodded at her, but at the same time, he didn't completely understand her. Sandy headed straight to the clowns' tent with a fire burning up inside her. She threw open the tent fold and glared at all of the clowns and workers. Everyone stared at Sandra as her face turned bright red with her perfect white teeth gritting hard and her thin eyebrows furrowing in rage. \"What do you want witch?\" Jock asked rudely dragging another cigarette in his mouth, and he was wearing a tank top and the bloomers from the mother elephant costume. The girl walked towards Jock and slapped him hard across the face, causing him to fall out of his seat. Her sudden assault caused the clowns, roustabouts, and performers to flinch, jump, and gasp in fear, as her slap was the sound of thunder cracking. She began screaming as she punched another clown in the nose and fell out of his seat. She grabbed a chair and threw it towards one worker, and kicked over a table knocking over their makeup, cigarettes, cigars, cards, food, and drinks. She continued her rampage until everything was destroyed and glared at all of them. \"HOW DARE YOU?!\" she shouted. \"HOW DARE ALL OF YOU HUMILIATE ME?! AND HOW DARE ALL OF YOU HUMILIATE DUMBO?! How could you embarrass me in front of the circus?! That was just disgusting!\" \"Well….\" Ben said. \"We were just playing a little joke.\" \"A joke?\" Sandy screamed as she clutched Ben by the throat, choking him as his face turned purple. \"That was NOT a very funny one! It was so sick! Did anyone ever tell you it is rude to make fun of a person that has a certain phobia and give him or her a panic attack?!\" She released the clown harshly as he landed on the ground and he trembled in fear. \"Of course not! You could've killed me!\" \"What's going on in here?\" The circus performers and roustabouts turned their heads to see whom the voice belonged to, and it was none other than the Ringmaster. His eyes widened in horror to see the clowns' tent in a wreck, he looked straight at the girl with her face redder than ever, with brimming red eyes, and it was pinched in anger. \"Sandra, what is the meaning of this?\" \"Uncle Harold, I wouldn't have ended up humiliated in front of the whole circus if it weren't for the clowns and mostly YOU!\" She shouted now going at the high point of her temper as she pointed at him. Harold's skin turned pale to hear his niece blaming at him, and he gasped. He never knew this girl could have a temper, well his temper. \"ME?\" he was completely offended. \"What did I do?\" \"I'll tell you what you did,\" Sandy said harshly. \"Your clowns decided to pull me up in the air and humiliate me, and worse of all, it gave me a panic attack! And you did not do anything to stop it, before it got any worse, I could have been dead!\" \"WHAT?! I didn't tell them to do anything!\" the Ringmaster shouted. \"It wasn't MY fault!\" \"Well, I just had enough of your selfish crap! You never listen to me, you don't care about me, you're a stubborn bull, and the only thing you care about is money, your self, and you can be so stupid and heartless! You can go on acting the goat as long as you like! You also dare to insult my Wiccan heritage and my mother, and for those who insult me, or call me a witch, go to Hell! Well guess what? I have acrophobia, which means I have an enormous fear of heights!\" Harold's face turned to shock to hear the ultimate truth from the girl and his jaw dropped. \"What?\" he stuttered, \"Acrophobia?\" \"That's right, I had a bad accident that happened three years ago when I fell from the trapeze bar and broke my leg! Ever since that fateful day, I have been completely terrified of heights! This is the reason why I keep refusing to go up to the high platform, and swing with the other performers. The fact that you train all of the animals and performers here is one damn good thing, but the horrible thing you ever done, was when you separate that baby elephant, Dumbo from his mother when she got angry, that was unforgivable!\" \"For God's sakes, she is NOT a 'Mad Elephant'!\" she continued. \"She was just trying to protect her baby from those boys picking on him, and you made it completely worse by whipping her! Tying her down! And locking her up in solitary confinement, that is considered animal abuse! It was inexcusable Uncle Harold! This reminds me of the evil poachers back in Africa, all they do is capture and kill innocent animals for their fur, skins, and most critically, ivory tusks from the elephants. And the most horrible thing one ever did in front of me was killing my mother!\" \"But Sandy…\" the Ringmaster stammered. \"How… could this…? This… be… what?!\" his eyes widened and face grew paler at the mention of her mother. \"Your mother was killed… by poachers?\" \"That's right Harold! Those poachers are nothing but cruel, cold-hearted, and evil monsters like you and those blithering idiots! Ever since Momma died, I continue to blame myself for going on the safari ride in Africa, and if we haven't gone, my mother would have still been alive today! I've always wanted to say this and I'm gonna say it now! Screw you Uncle Harold, and screw all of you! I hope you eat my ashes and die! I am fed up with all this nonsense,\" she stormed towards the exit of the tent and faced them again. \"And one more thing, I will no longer participate in this circus, I'm going home!\" The girl left the tent and ran faster and faster as her feet would carry her, far away from the circus. She ignored the voices begging her to stop, but she ignored them all. Since the clowns didn't care about her. All of the emotions that were building up inside of her, and were released out of her system, as she ran further away into the meadow towards the woods, farther away from the circus. She tripped over a root and tumbled down the hill and came to a stop sobbing in the earth, not caring that her face and clothes were covered with dirt. I failed myself. I failed Dumbo. I failed Timothy. I failed Mrs. Jumbo. I failed my family. I failed my ancestors. I am such a coward![Chapter 11] After a long twenty minutes of crying of shame and failure, a breeze blew and she looked up to see leaves swirling in the air like cyclones as the spirit of a gazelle leapt gracefully. The girl got to her knees to watch the pale animal leaping and disappeared. \"You are long ways past the circus,\" a familiar voice said. Sandra spun around to see the spirit of a woman sitting on a fallen tree trunk. Her blonde hair was tied in a bun and she wore safari clothes, her brown eyes were filled with stars, Sandy's eyes widened in shock as she stared at the calm spirit. \"Momma?\" \"Guess, I've chosen the right form of an animal.\" \"Momma!\" Sandy cried. She ran towards the spirit of her mother as the woman wrapped her arms around her daughter. The girl sobbed as her emotions were released into the chest of her mother. \"Oh Sandy, my sweet daughter.\" \"Momma, what are you doing here?\" \"The Goddess gave me permission to visit you at the darkest hour, and I was allowed to see you. My, how you've grown.\" Sandy separated herself from her mother's arms and looked at her with tears staining her face. \"I'm sorry Momma, I tried, but I couldn't. I miss you so much.\" Katherine gave a warm smile as she wiped away her daughter's tears with her slender fingers. \"Oh sweetheart, it's not your fault. I shouldn't have put so much pressure on your shoulders, and I wish I could have stopped that humiliation. As long as I'm here in your heart, you'll never be alone.\" As the girl hugged onto Katherine, she heard footsteps coming near. She gasped and ducked behind the trunk with her mother. She stayed hidden as the footsteps got louder and louder as they stopped. \"Did you hear that?\" a male voice asked. \"It thought it sounded like it was our sister,\" another voice added. \"But how could she be here James?\" \"I don't know, maybe it was our imagination Robert.\" Sandy looked over the trunk to see two men standing near, and her eyes widened in surprise. One was tall with brown hair and brown eyes, while the other was of mid-height with blond hair and brown eyes. They slowly walked away from her hiding place. \"Wait! James? Robert?\" she spoke up. \"Is that really you?\" The two boys stopped and turned around to Sandra standing up from the trunk. \"Sandy!\" her brothers threw their arms around their sister and gathered in a group hug. She released herself from the long hug and looked at her brothers. \"What are you two doing here?\" \"Well, we were touring in Mississippi to spend a little brother to brother time together,\" James said. \"Well, this is a pleasant surprise. By the way there's someone here,\" Sandy pointed over to where Katherine was sitting. \"Momma?\" the boys' jaws dropped in shock. \"Oh my sons!\" Katherine hugged the men, as the girl joined in the hug along with their mother. Once their hug was over, the woman looked to see how her three children have grown up well. \"Mom, we missed you so much, what brings you here?\" James asked. \"I came here, because your sister is at her darkest hour.\" The boys turned to look at the blonde girl with a tear stained face and red blood shot eyes. \"Sandy, what wrong?\" Robert asked. \"Have you been crying?\" \"I just had a very upsetting night, I was humiliated in front of the whole audience because of the clowns and Uncle Harold!\" \"What?\" James gasped. \"What did they do?\" \"I'll explain everything.\" The girl spoke out the whole story of how she arrived at the circus, met Dumbo, Timothy, and Mrs. Jumbo; how Mrs. Jumbo was protecting her son from bullies and got locked away in solitary confinement, and she got injured. She mentioned about the rumors the clowns and workers were spreading about her performing witchcraft; how the Pyramid of Pachyderms failed and her argument on the train with the Ringmaster, and did all she can to explain it. \"And after my performance, the clowns decided to trick me, and they hauled me up to ninety feet to scare me half to death! Not only that, they throw food, water, and garbage at me! The whole audience started to laugh at this stunt, and even worse my phobia started to set in.\" \"Oh Sandy, I am so, so sorry, I cannot believe what they did to you,\" the older boy's voice was filled with sadness and guilt to hear his sister filled with pain. \"If only Father, Momma, Robert, and I were there, we would have spoken to Uncle Harold about this and prevent it.\" \"What did you say to Uncle Harold?\" the blonde boy asked. \"I stood up to the clowns and Harold, accusing them for abusing a baby elephant and me. After my confrontation, I decided to quit and go home, I'm completely useless and I can't protect this baby elephant anymore.\" She turned to Katherine continuing. \"Maybe I don't deserve to be a Wiccan, like you Momma and I'm the one who ended up getting you killed.\" \"Oh Sandra, for goodness' sakes, you are not responsible for my death. I risked everything to save you and this is what you say after six years? Never say that!\" \"Sandy, have you forgotten who you are?\" James said sternly. \"Like Mom said, Dad, Robert, and I keep telling you it's not your fault. No one blames you for what happened. Don't let this act get to you, and make you weak. Because to us, you are the strongest, toughest, and beautiful sister Robert and I ever have.\" \"Really?\" Sandy sniffed. \"Of course we do. Momma always taught us to hold our heads up high and proud, and ignore every insult that everyone says about us.\" \"Your brother has a point dear, but if you feel this is the wrong answer, we understand. If you are ready to go home, your father and family will be waiting.\" As Sandy turned around to walk away with her choice, and she suddenly stop. She heard voices waving in and out of her minds as wind currents were flowing gently through the tall grass. She knew that leaving the circus might be a bad choice. It caused her to stop and think about Dumbo and Mrs. Jumbo. \"Why do you hesitate?\" James asked. \"I…. I don't know,\" she sighed in confusion. Katherine stood up as the wind surrounded her and began a soft verse. I know a girl from Mother Earth, Who stands apart from the crowd? She truly loves her heritage and her people, She makes her whole family proud. The spirit of her mother placed her hand on her daughter's cheek as the girl gave a small smile, guided gracefully along the trees and stroked a few branches and picked up a broken one. She came up to her daughter and held her hands as the golden stars glowed above in the indigo sky with the silver moon. Scars may appear fresh in our minds, But they can heal As they lead you to where you are. Do you hear this voice inside your head? It's always the God, the Goddess, And most importantly, your mother. More tears glistened in Sandra's eyes as she watched Katherine drew a circle in the air creating swirling orbs as forms of animals came dancing around, along with the God and Goddess forming the Earth. They are our guiders. They tell us that in the circle of life, The One manifests in the world, The movement of the circle is the spiral, Nothing lives forever, Nothing dies forever, The ripples return, and nothing is hidden, Most importantly life is after death. My life is recycled by nature I shall come back as a living form. \"You've come so far Sandy, but there is one question, do you do know you are?\" Robert asked. Sandy thought for a moment, she climbed up to a log and looked at the stars and sang gently. Who am I? I am the girl, who loves nature, And the girl, who loves her heritage, They call me. I am the daughter of a Wiccan Priestess. We are descended from Wiccans, Who found their way to spread the Divine. They call me! As if her voice echoed in the heavens above, more spirits of her ancestors came down as the first priest of her ancestor, Bedwyr dressed in Medieval robes of pure white smiled and bowed at his descendant. He flew up into the skies as many of her ancestors, men and women dressed in Medieval to the present flew over her making her remind of who she is. I have journeyed across the land, I have come so farther All the ancestors have been inside me The call they have given is inside me! It's like the breeze flowing and rising. I will be strong, kind, and have courage. That's what makes me, For who I am…. I know myself! I am Sandy! Sandy had a smile growing on her face with the courage receiving from her family and felt the spirits flowing around her as they lifted into the stars and each exploded as she touched one. She floated back to the earth as a new energy flowed in her blood, which was from the magic of her ancestors. \"You're right Mother, now I'm starting to understand. I think it's time for me to face my fears, not to let those clowns get in the way.\" \"That's the sister we know!\" Robert exclaimed. \"I knew that you have the heart to forget those who despise and humiliate you, and I'm proud of you for the woman you've become and accepted your Wiccan heritage. My sons, I'm also proud of you for the men you've become and been there for your sister after I died.\" Katherine gave her children another hug and Sandy wished her mother not to leave as more tears streamed down her face. \"Take care of each other.\" \"We will Mom, we promise,\" James said. \"I love you Sandy, and I love you James and Robert,\" she said. \"We love you too Momma,\" they said. Katherine stepped back from the children and she transformed back into a gazelle and run back up to the night sky, dissolving into stars. Sandy released a breath she has been holding and wiped away her tears with her head held high. She turned back to her brothers. \"Well, Sandy, are you ready to face your fears?\" James asked. \"Yes I am. Would you like to come with me?\" she asked. \"Back to the circus I mean, and that way I won't be alone.\" \"Of course,\" Robert said. \"Anything we'll do to keep our sister safe.\" Sandy threw her arms around her brothers again and sobbed once more, as love, family, and hope surrounded her again. \"No matter what, we'll always stick together,\" James said. \"Thank you so much guys.\"[Chapter 12] For those who are interested in knowing more about Sandy's brothers, James is 20 years old, and Robert is 16 years old, Sandy is almost 19, since she was born on October 22, 1922. Both of her brothers are half-Wiccans too. Sandy's father is in Africa studying the elephants. Overall, I'm now at the Baby Mine scene and we will also learn why the Ringmaster is bitter around Sandy. After an hour of walking she returned to the circus, along with her brothers and they avoided from getting seen by the clowns and the workers. James and Robert escorted the middle sister to her tent and she looked back at them. \"Get some sleep sis,\" James said as he held her hands. \"You're exhausted. We'll deal with Uncle Harold.\" \"We promise that things will get better,\" Robert added. \"Thank you James and Robert,\" Sandy agreed and gave them one more hug. \"Good night.\" \"Good night sis,\" they said and once they were out of sight, she did not go straight back to her tent, she went to look for Dumbo and Timothy. All of the crying and anger left her physically and emotionally exhausted. She could see stars in her vision as she took every step. \"Sandy!\" the girl looked down to see Timothy and Dumbo coming towards her with worried expressions. Dumbo was wearing a red clown collar with yellow lining and a yellow hat. \"There ya are, everyone's been lookin' fer ya. I was afraid we'd lost you, you put on quite a show in the tent.\" \"I know Timothy,\" she sighed. \"I'm sorry, I just had to let it out, and I shouldn't have lost my temper back there. I stood up for myself and mostly for you Dumbo, but I changed my mind about leaving, after some convincing from my brothers.\" \"Your brothers are here?\" Timothy exclaimed. \"Yeah, it was a surprise and they're going to talk to Uncle Harold. Things are going to be all right.\" \"I don't blame ya honey,\" he said. \"By the way, I was wonderin' if we could visit Mrs. Jumbo for a lil' while.\" The girl gasped in surprise. \"Mrs. Jumbo! I almost forgot about her, but yes, let's see her! Follow me, I'll show you where she is.\" The three friends walked together through the maze of tents and they came out from the corner to see the mad elephant wagon. Sandy remembered going to visit Mrs. Jumbo the night she got locked up. She shook the memory out and walked towards it with Dumbo and Timothy. \"There we are, cozy little place ain't it?\" Timothy said sarcastically. Sandy took a quick look around to make sure no one was near. \"The coast is clear, let's go.\" Dumbo walked underneath the cord as Sandy climbed over it. The calf stood up on his hind legs as he leaned up against the wagon. Timothy climbed up on the trunk and came up to the barred window. \"Mrs. Jumbo!\" he called and then murmured to himself. \"I hope she's in.\" He whistled to the mother elephant standing in forlorn and depression. \"Mrs. Jumbo, we have someone who's here to see you,\" Sandy said. Mrs. Jumbo looked up and she saw her baby's tiny trunk reaching into the barred window, Sandy wrapped her arms around the calf's barrel and lifted him up to help him see his mother through the window. Mrs. Jumbo gasped in surprise and smiled to see her son again in clear view. \"Dumbo! Oh my little son!\" she cried and tried to reach over to the window, but the heavy shackles dragged her legs down. \"Try to reach out to him ma'am,\" Sandy encouraged her. The mother elephant reached her trunk out towards her baby and patted his head. As soon as their trunks intertwined, Dumbo forgot all about the abuse and bullying he was put in and was surrounded by the warmth from his mother as she rubbed his head softly. The soft feeling of her proboscis comforted him as tears leaked out from his baby blue eyes. He clutched onto his mother's trunk so close, he buried his head and face into her trunk and began to sob uncontrollably. Mrs. Jumbo felt her son's emotions getting released and with her motherly instincts, she made a sling for her son and he climbed in. Slowly, the mother elephant began to swing her baby back and forth gently and sang a soothing lullaby. Baby mine, don't you cry Baby mine, dry your eyes, Rest your head close to my heart Never to part, baby of mine As Sandy watched the beautiful moment between mother and son, tears began to form in her eyes once more, giving her another memory of when her mother would comfort her when she would run home from school crying after being taunted by bullies. She noticed Timothy swaying back and forth, falling in love with Mrs. Jumbo's nurturing singing voice. The girl and the mouse looked over to see all the mother animals with their babies. A zebra nuzzled her foal close for comfort and warmth. A mother giraffe lies her head against a bale of hay as her calf laid against her neck snoring softly, tiger cubs were huddled near their mother, and a monkey swung her babies in hold as she held them close. Little one when you play, Don't you mind what they say, Let those eyes sparkle and shine Never a tear, baby of mine A mother hyena and her babies laughed in their sleep as they curled up together. A hippo and her baby slept under the water together with bubbles flowing to the surface. Three ostriches huddled together with their heads in the ground, and a kangaroo rocked herself back and forth with her joey sleeping in her pouch. Timothy was moved with emotion that tears came out from his eyes. Calm your head to your toes You're so sweet, goodness knows You are so precious to me Cute as can be Baby of mine Baby mine Baby mine. As the lullaby ended, Dumbo was getting more comfortable as he snuggled against his mother's trunk as she rocked him gently. Sandy remembered that the circus workers would be out at night and looked at Timothy and gave her a nod. She came up to the calf and tapped his shoulder. \"Forgive me Dumbo, I'm afraid we have to leave.\" Dumbo squealed sadly as Timothy gently pulled on his tail. \"I know you don't want to leave, but we'll be in trouble if we don't.\" Dumbo nodded in understanding, as the blonde helped him down, while his trunk was intertwined with his mother's as they slowly pulled apart. Sandy came up to the wagon and took Mrs. Jumbo's proboscis in her hand. \"Have faith Mrs. Jumbo, you'll be free soon.\" \"Thank you my friend,\" Mrs. Jumbo smiled. \"Take care of my son.\" \"I will,\" the girl said as she came to where Dumbo was waving back to his mother and she in return waved back to him. The girl, mouse, and calf walked back to the circus grounds to turn in for the night. The blonde knelt next to Dumbo and stroked his back tenderly. \"Don't worry Dumbo, you'll be back with your mother soon, I promise.\" She said giving a nod. Mrs. Jumbo sighed sadly as she waved to her calf and the girl as they walked back to the circus grounds. The heavy shackles pulled down her thick legs as the tiny wagon enclosed her. Suddenly, a cool, but warm breeze suddenly blew into the wagon, as a spirit of a gazelle leapt gracefully around her, and send chills down the elephant's spine. The gazelle landed on its' feet and in a bright flash transformed into a woman. \"You are almost close to freedom,\" she said giving a kind smile to the elephant. Mrs. Jumbo cowered in fear, afraid that this human ghost would hurt her. \"Don't be afraid, I mean you no harm,\" she said. \"Who are you?\" Mrs. Jumbo asked finding her voice. \"You have been such a wonderful friend to my daughter, and filled in my role.\" \"Wait, are you Sandy's mother?\" Katherine came towards the elephant and stroked her trunk gently. She looked up and smiled. \"That, I am.\" \"Oh my, I never thought I would meet you, Sandy mentioned a little bit about you. How did you come into this cage?\" \"I'm actually a spirit. After I died, my spirit went to the afterlife and sooner or later, I will comeback reborn as a gazelle.\" She looked down at the elephant's deep cuts and scars on her legs, and came towards her. \"Oh no, it's nothing really,\" Mrs. Jumbo said flinching her legs as the heavy chains dragged her down. \"Now, now, I insist,\" the woman placed her hand on each of the cuts and created a bright warm glow. As a few seconds passed, Katherine pulled back her hand and the cuts on the elephant's legs vanished, Mrs. Jumbo's eyes widened in surprise. \"My cuts are gone! Thank you!\" \"You're welcome, it was all I can to repay you for being friends with my daughter.\" \"Oh please, it was nothing, your daughter is very special. I'm sorry I had to put her through so much, if I hadn't lose my temper for protecting my son, this wouldn't have happened.\" \"I don't blame you for what happened. When you defended your son from the bullies, my brother-in-law, and the workers, it reminded me off the elephants back in Africa and Asia on how they protect their children from predators, hunters, and poachers. I saw the fear in my daughter's eyes as it brought back the memories of the day I sacrificed my life to save her from a poacher.\" \"Forgive me for asking, you were killed by a poacher?\" \"Yes my daughter and I freed a baby elephant that was caught in the snare and the poacher who caught it, appeared. He tried to kill Sandy, but I took the shots and give up my life to save her. As a mother, she knows when to risk her life to protect her child.\" She gave a pause. \"You want to know what's surprising Mrs. Jumbo?\" \"No what?\" the elephant raised her eyebrows. \"My daughter and your son are the same, in their own unique and sad ways.\" \"What do you mean by sad?\" \"When your son was picked on and got bullied by others at the circus, my daughter too was bullied and taunted in her childhood. It was all because other children mock her Wiccan heritage and love for animals. Almost every day, she would come home crying to my husband and I, as we did everything to comfort her. We tried to help her find few friends, but somehow, she's always alone. As soon as she got older, she started to make some friends that were Wiccans too.\" \"Oh I'm sorry to hear that, but now that you mentioned it, I noticed that Sandy has never shown her broken side. She always holds her head up high and protects my son from danger. I just wish Dumbo could be accepted and no one notices his ears.\" \"No matter what, your son will soon be accepted.\" Katherine smiled and gently wrapped her arms around the elephant's trunk. Mrs. Jumbo smiled and hugged back the woman as tears leaked from her eyes. \"Thank you Katherine, I promise I will be there for your daughter.\" \"You're welcome Mrs. Jumbo, and may the God and Goddess look down upon you.\" Katherine stepped back gracefully as she floated through the bars and transformed into stars once more and was at rest. Mrs. Jumbo sighed and had another ounce of hope that she's close to freedom. James and Robert made their way through the maze of tents, and found their way to the ringmaster's tent. They entered and found him sitting at his desk with a bottle of whiskey and a small glass. \"Hello Uncle Harold,\" James said with a stern voice. Harold snapped from his thoughts as he looked up to see the two young men, and his eyes widened in shock. \"James? Robert? What are you doing here?\" \"Well, before you ask us more questions, we're here to talk to you.\" \"Oh, of course, where are my manners? Want to have a drink?\" Harold pulled out two glasses to offer to his nephews. \"Oh no thanks,\" James said. \"And none for Robert too, he's not at the legal age to drink yet.\" \"Of course, have a seat.\" Both the young man and the boy sat in the chairs and kept their gazes firm at the ringmaster. \"So what brings you boys here? How did you manage to find my circus?\" \"Well, we were on a camping trip and went for a hike. We discovered our sister in the woods and she was very upset. She told us what happened about the humiliation and the confrontation with you and those blokes. What is the matter with you? Why didn't you stop this humiliation?\" James demanded. The ringmaster flinched back at the eldest boy's firm voice. \"She told you everything?\" \"Everything,\" Robert agreed. \"Why didn't you save our sis?\" \"It… it… it… was because… well I'm gonna be honest… I admit, I was in my office planning out my performances and I heard laughing over in the big top. I went over to see what was going on and found Sandy running past me all covered in food, glue, and garbage. I wanted to follow her, but the clowns dragged me and I had to put Dumbo on in the clown act. Soon after, Sandra snapped and attacked my clowns and it brought me back to when I locked that 'Mad Elephant' in solitary confinement. I came in to see what the entire ruckus was, and she then starts blaming me on everything for ruining her life, Dumbo's, my way of treating the animals and her pride and decided to leave the circus. I guess she'll never forgive me for what I did.\" \"Look Uncle Harold,\" James said. \"Sandy may have a hard heart and a ferocious temper, but it's not too late. We encountered her and gave her some convincing and along with our ancestor's and our mother's spirit, she changed her mind.\" Harold's eyes widened in surprise at the mention of his niece not quitting. \"She did?\" \"Yes, she decided she will not run away and she'll face her fears and the clowns.\" \"Well, I'm glad she's not going down a wrong path. But I have a little secret to tell you, why I was harsh around your sister.\" Harold said. \"What is it?\" James asked. \"I was…. I love…. I can't say it.\" \"Come on Uncle Harold! Spit it out!\" Robert snapped. \"Robert!\" the eldest boy elbowed his youngest brother with a glare and looked back at the Ringmster. \"I was in love with your mother.\" \"WHAT?\" the brothers exclaimed. Their eyes widened in horror and color drained from their faces. \"You loved Momma?\" James asked. \"How come you've never told us or Poppa?\" Robert added. \"Because, when Robin and I were young lads in 1916, we spend a lot of time together. When we came to a festival, we both spotted a young woman dancing in a circle. She was filled with grace, as she never toppled over in her dance. Robin and I feel head over heels for her, and after her dance we introduced ourselves to her. She was warm and kind and beautiful. Birds and woodland animals always surrounded her and my brother and I were very skeptical that she can speak to them. Eventually, Robin believed her and she showed him the ways of how her people lived, and he showed her our ways too. I did admit my love to Katherine, however she said that she always sees me as a friend and knows that we may not make it out. I accepted her choice to marry your father and knew that I want her to be happy.\" \"So that's why you were cold-hearted around Sandy almost all the time, all because she makes you think about Momma.\" Robert concluded. \"Yes, every time I look at Sandy, she reminds me so much of Katherine.\" The Ringmaster confessed. \"I have heartache whenever I look at her. I didn't want to get in the way of my brother's marriage. I came to realize if your mother never married your father, you two and your sister would have never been born. I guess it was the way it was meant to be.\" \"It seems that way Uncle, but you can't let the memory and love for Momma to cloud your mind. You have to clear it up and think of our sister as a good thing, and after all she is following our mother's footsteps to continue our family legacy. You have to make things right with her and put the pain in the fire,\" James explained. \"For Heaven's sake, you're right. I have to see her,\" the Ringmaster got up and was about to leave, but James grabbed his hand to stop him. \"Not tonight, see Sandy tomorrow. She's exhausted, and let her sleep.\" \"I guess so,\" the Ringmaster said. \"Don't worry Uncle, everything's going to work out in the end, and you'll two make peace.\" Robert said giving a small smile.[Chapter 13] Back in the clown tent, the clowns were laughing hysterically as they continued to drink and chat in order to forget the Ringmaster's niece's tantrum. They were all drunk and continued with their peace. \"Here ya are. Pour it in me slipper, Johnny.\" Arthur said as Johnny poured champagne into his big shoe. \"Boy, I can't get over the way we rolled 'em in the aisles.\" Larry said. \"Just wait'll we hit the big town.\" Joey added. \"This gives me an idea,\" Jeff said, standing up on the table. \"Let's raise the platform the elephant jumps off of and we'll humiliate that witch again.\" \"Yeah! If they laugh when he jumps twenty feet they'll laugh twice as hard if he jumps forty feet.\" Gary said, adjusting the strong to a guitar as he lies in a hammock. \"If we haul her up to ninety feet, she'll get more laughs!\" \"Yeah, that's right. That's right.\" The clowns agreed. \"Simple mathematics.\" Ken replied. \"Let's make it eighty feet.\" Ed said. \"Don't be a piker, a hundred and eight.\" Dennis replied. \"Make it three hundred.\" \"A thousand.\" The clowns agreed to the idea. \"Hey, be careful,\" Ben said as he bathed in a rusty tub, his neck was very sore as bruises formed from when the girl strangled him. \"You'll hurt the little guy and remember that girl's tantrum and who she is, she's the Ringmaster's niece. We really did hurt her feelin's.\" \"Aw, go on. Elephants ain't got no feelings and women are weak and stupid,\" Tomas said, not feeling any sympathy for the victims. \"No, they're made of rubber,\" Mark said. \"Women are dumb and should be seen, not heard. Even her being a witch creating spells and all that jazz brings bad luck to us. Let's make her climb up to the platform and she could take a tall dive and that'll shock her out of her wits. We could around surround fire around her and she could just like ol' witches.\" \"This idea is sensational!\" Joey said. \"Let's go tell the boss.\" \"Hey, hey! Let's hit him for a raise,\" Jock agreed. \"Yeah, sure. This is worth real dough,\" Rodger added. All the clowns paraded out of the tent as they begin to sing a song to earn a better salary. Oh, we're gonna hit the big boss for a raise Yes, we're gonna hit the big boss for a raise Oh, we're gonna get more money 'cause we know that we're funny We're gonna hit the big boss for a raise! As the clowns left the tent, one of them danced backward and wobbled the table. From the shaking, the bottle of champagne toppled over and landed in a water barrel from outside. Eventually it began to drug the water. As they were about to enter the Ringmaster's office, two young men stopped them that both had their arms crossed with sharp glares. They both blocked the entrance. \"Excuse me boys,\" Jock said. \"But you're blockin' the way, we need to see the boss.\" \"Oh no, whatever you had in mind for our sister, it's not gonna happen,\" Robert said. \"Hold it, you're the witch's brothers?\" Hank asked. James charged towards Hank and punched him square in the jaw. The impact caused him to land on the ground and he looked up with blood dripping from his face. \"How dare you call our sister a witch?!\" James snapped. \"You all should be ashamed of yourselves for mistreating our sister. You ruined her reputation and confidence! You are the ones who brought disgrace on her and our family.\" \"Aw disgrace, that's nonsense! That witch deserves to be tormented, and we have another idea to humiliate her. We're gonna put her in the middle of the ring and surround her with fire!\" Joey said. \"You wouldn't dare!\" Robert warned. \"Oh we're gonna do it!\" Jeff argued. \"Well, first of all, Sandy has gone through enough abusive treatment from you blokes. Even when you think it's funny to torment a person on their fears, which in reality is really not!\" James went on. \"We're not joking, but our sister has been bullied at lot at school, all because the kids insult her for her love of animals and being half-Wiccan. My brother and I share the same blood and gift as her. We were her only friends at the time.\" \"Friends, huh?\" Mark sneered. \"Since you're the brothers of that witch, that makes you warlocks, right?\" He called to two of the other clowns. \"Boys! Let's show these warlocks what we think of their kind.\" The two clowns quickly seized the brothers, and were just about to make off with them, when a voice boomed. \"What's going on around here?\" The Ringmaster had emerged from his tent, and he certainly looked displeased with the sight he saw. \"Oh, hey boss,\" said Joey, a little nervous on seeing the Ringmaster. \"We were just coming here to present you with a brilliant idea we just cooked up, but these two roughs just stood in our way.\" \"Unhand them at once!\" Harold thundered. \"These two are my nephews, and I will not tolerate such rudeness towards them!\" The two clowns holding the brothers reluctantly let them go. The Ringmaster turned towards Joey again. \"Now, what is this 'brilliant idea' you clowns want to present me with?\" he asked. \"Actually, it was I who came up with it first,\" Jeff stepped in. \"We decided that since Dumbo's act has earned us so many laughs from the audience, if we can raise the platform even taller, we'll earn even more laughs from them.\" \"More laughs means more money, Boss.\" added Joey. \"And we got an even better plan for that witch Sandy as well, Boss,\" Mark agreed. \"Let's make her climb up to a taller platform and then force her to take a tall dive that'll shake her out of her wits. Then we'll light up a ring of fire around her, so she could burn up just like witches do in the Dark Ages.\" While the clowns were detailing their ideas, the brothers, despite their indignant looks, remained strangely calm, because they were secretly aware of what their uncle would react soon. \"So what do you think of our plans, Boss?\" Joey asked when his companions were done talking. \"It's brilliant and lucrative, isn't it?\" The Ringmaster stepped forward to the three clowns with a sweet smile on his face. \"Well, I must say that I am certainly proud of you all…\" he said, and the clowns began to beam delightfully…until \"YOU BLOCKHEADS!\" the Ringmaster shouted as he delivered a punch on Mark's face, and then sent another one on Jeff, causing them to fall to the ground, which shocked Joey (as well as the rest of the clowns). The Ringmaster glared at the clowns with the angriest expression on his face. \"First you carry out that humiliating performance on my niece without my knowledge or permission, and now you have the nerve to approach me with an even brutal and dangerous one, simply to earn more laughs!? WHAT WERE YOU BLOKES THINKING?\" He bellowed at them. \"We, we didn't mean… boss,\" Tomas tried to protest. The Ringmaster wasn't done with them yet. \"That proposal of yours could have gotten Sandy seriously hurt, or worse! And if that fire of yours had gotten out of control, it would have end up setting fire to the entire main circus tent, causing even more damage and possibly creating an even worst disaster than the Elephant Pyramid one. HAVEN'T YOU BLOKES EVEN THOUGHT OF THAT?\" \"Hey, take it easy, Boss,\" Arthur protested. \"It was just a suggestion.\" \"Well, I should've been there to protect Sandy from you blokes, and I'm starting to know I've made huge mistakes for her, the elephants, and myself,\" he stated. \"If you're gonna hurt that girl again, you'll be very sorry for that.\" \"Look, Boss, we'll let the girl off, if you could let us have our way with Dumbo again,\" Larry suggested. Harold gave a thought and looked at his nephews and he gave them a nod. He looked back at the clowns and gave them a stern look. \"All right\", he said. \"Considering that your idea of raising the platform for Dumbo has some potential, I will approve of it, as your last chance here in this circus. And I will only raise the platform to 100 feet, because that's as tall as the main circus tent will allow. Understand?\" \"Yes, Boss,\" the clowns said in unison. \"One more thing\" The Ringmaster added. \"If you ever, ever, have the nerve, or even the thought, of hurting and humiliating my niece and her brothers again, I'll have every one of you dismissed from this Circus! For Good! Is that clear?\" \"You have our word,\" Joey stated. \"Come on, let's hit the sack and prepare for tomorrow.\" Once the clowns were out of sight, Harold turned to his nephews as he took a deep breath. \"Well, I may have not convinced them, but I hope I talked some sense into them,\" he admitted. \"You did well Uncle Harold,\" James said putting a hand on the man's shoulder. \"We'll make sure Sandy is safe and happy,\" Robert agreed. \"Let's hope,\" the Ringmaster then yawned. \"Meanwhile, let's get some sleep. I'll find a place for you boys to sleep.\" The boys thanked the man, and he led them to a tent next to him, and all of them fell into a deep slumber from an emotional night.[Chapter 14] The trio continued to walk around the circus to head back to Sandra's tent, and they were all exhausted from the fiasco tonight. While Sandy had more hope in her soul, Dumbo was still broken and driven to tears from being separated from his mother again. \"I know how you feel Dumbo,\" Timothy said as the baby elephant wept holding onto his tail. \"But you gotta pull yourself together! What would your mother think, if she saw you cryin' like that? Remember, you come of a proud race. Why you're a pachyderm, and pachyderms don't cry. What's cryin' get you anyhow? Nothin' but the hiccups.\" As they stopped, Dumbo began to hiccup. \"There, see?\" Dumbo wiped his tears and hiccupped again. \"Let's find some water, it'll get rid of the hiccups,\" Sandy suggested. \"Well, ain't nothin' but a little water won't cure,\" Timothy agreed seeing the water barrel near the clown tent. He lifted up Dumbo's trunk to lead him to the water. \"Oops-a-daisy. We'll have you fixed up in a jiffy,\" Timothy said. The calf hiccupped pulling the mouse back. \"Come on.\" The mouse guided the baby elephant towards the barrel and climbed up to the rim. \"Here take a trunkful,\" Dumbo splashed his trunk into the water barrel, and begin to suck up the water. Sandy picked up a nearby cup on the ground. She scooped up the water and placed it to her lips. The water was clear, but oddly enough, it tasted of bitter stale apples and white wine. In an instant, she was curious about the liquid and scooped up another cup to drink more. \"Is it just me or is this water poisoned?\" she murmured as she drank, she listened to Timothy giving Dumbo another pep talk to boost his confidence. \"Listen, little fella. We may have had a lot of hard luck up till now. But you, me, and Sandy is gonna do big things together. Hold your breath.\" Dumbo held his breath as his face turned bright red. As Sandy swallowed her drink, the liquid burned her throat, and a wave of warmth spread throughout her body. \"Why, your mother's gonna be so proud of ya. I'm gonna be proud of ya too. Sandy's gonna be proud of ya. The whole circus is gonna be proud of ya. Now, what do ya think of that? Swallow it.\" Dumbo gulped down the water and hiccupped. His face was filled with ecstasy as he smiled while lowering himself down as a bubble was exhaled from his proboscis. \"Ho-ho. They can't keep us down.\" The mouse continued. \"Timothy, do you think I'll be able to conquer my fear of heights?\" Sandy asked as she drank more water. \"No worries Sandy, but you're gonna do big things too. Your mother's gonna be proud of ya. Your uncle's gonna be proud of ya too, even your brothers, father, and the circus is gonna be proud of ya too. Even me and Dumbo.\" \"I guess so…\" \"Oh, I guess you had one little one left over,\" Timothy muttered. \"Dumbo, Sandy, we'll bounce back so hard….\" \"HIC!\" Dumbo balanced his hat back on his hat as more bubbles came out and one of his floppy ears covered his head. Timothy started to notice Dumbo acting strange. \"Hey! What's the matter with you?\" he asked. Dumbo sneezed as more bubbles were blown from his trunk as he was falling under a controlling spell. Sandy finished her drink and began to act strange. \"Ohhhh,\" Sandy slurred and her head was light as a balloon. \"All of a sudden, I feel very funny.\" \"What kind of water is this anyhow?\" Timothy asked as he leaned in. He then toppled forward, landing in the water barrel. He swam underneath with his singing muffled underneath the surface. Once he resurfaced, he was under the same spell as Dumbo and Sandy, and he began to laugh hysterically. He swayed from side to side and waved to Dumbo, giggling lightly. The baby elephant waved back as he hiccuped more bubbles. Sandy's vision began to double up and she stood up on her toes as if she were a ballerina and danced clumsily. The blonde laughed hysterically, as if a demon possessed her body and moved certain limbs. She burped as bubbles came out of her mouth. \"Oops, excuse me,\" she said covering her mouth. Timothy swayed on the bucket as he hiccupped and leaned on a bubble. The bubble popped as he fell, only to be brought back up by another bubble. \"Balloonies,\" he said, he looked over to see his reflection on another bubble and hugged it. \"Hiya, George.\" The bubble began to float up as Timothy slid down and was caught by another and floated up. The bubble popped as he hiccupped and rested himself on two bubbles whistling. They popped again as Timothy fell and was encased in another bubble and hummed a tune, he hiccupped again as his head was caught in another bubble with his hat on top of it, making his head larger as he whistled. The bubble popped and Timothy slid down Dumbo's trunk squealing, \"Whee!\" As he was about to land, Dumbo blow out an squiggly bubble and the mouse slid down in high-pitched laughter and landed on the ground. Sandy continued to dance in high ecstasy as she sang off-key as she kicked off one of her shoes. She slipped on the ground with her sides hurting from all the laughter and her stomach churned harder. She watched as the squiggly bubble turned into a round sphere. \"That's a pretty schstrick schlick.\" Timothy commented. \"Oh yeah, just like a perfect ball!\" Sandy squealed. \"All right. Let's see ya blow a square one, pal!\" Timothy said. Dumbo took a deep breath and his trunk formed into a rectangle, and blew a rectangular bubble, forming a cube. \"Wow, that's impressive!\" Sandy cried bubbly. \"Say, that's very, very clever,\" Timothy agreed as he clumsily backed up. \"Now blow a great big one.\" Dumbo's chest puffed up and blew out a really large bubble from his proboscis. It grew larger and larger, until it floated into the sky. Suddenly, the bubble changed its' shape and formed into an elephant, in the color of pink. It walked a bit and looked back at the pair, Dumbo's eyes widened at the sight. Sandra stared at the elephants with shock, as her mind was very blank. \"That's a pretty sh- Hey!\" Timothy said, as he grew scared at the sight. The pink elephant blew out another elephant from his proboscis, and he blew out another one. \"Dumbo. Sandy,\" Timothy cried as he zoomed up Dumbo's face and hid underneath the yellow hat and peered out. \"You see what I see?\" Dumbo, Timothy, and Sandy stared as the quartet of the elephants formed their trunks as trumpets and blew into them, until they were all together forming a large hole of a horn. After an explosion, a marching band of pink elephants appeared as it was just like the parade Sandy was in on the first day of the circus. Most of the pink elephants playing horns would take turning growing tall and shrinking as they walked over each other. One fat elephant ranging the bells, keeps stepping on a little pink elephant as it played a horn, and he got annoyed with the big one. As it walked over the other elephant, the little pink elephant kicked him and the big one turned into three big elephants. As they shrank, the little one grew holding two bog golden cymbals, slammed them on the three, forming more little dark pink elephants that marched around as the bright one walked on them. Sandy, Dumbo, and Timothy stared as the elephants surrounded them in a circle, the blonde tried to escape, but more elephants chased her back as they grew larger as balloons and exploded with a crack as loud as lightning. Dumbo looked from behind his ears in fright as Timothy looked around. Then the elephants formed a line, as they came through a window and down the stairs and began to sing and dance; Look out! Look out! Pink elephants on parade Here they come! Hippity-hoppity. They're here, and there. Pink elephants ev'rywhere! A circle of pink elephants surround a bed as they were walking upside as an elephant sleeping in the bed looked up and trembled in fear as the bed floated as in the darkness. Look out, look out They're walking around the bed. On their head! Clippity-cloppity. Arrayed in braid. Pink elephants on parade! Two white elephants popped up and down, and looked at each other. It only caused them to jump away in fear and hide. Two more elephants, one yellow and blue holding umbrella's slithered past each other pulling two striped elephants as they mixed into each other and struggled to separate and them exploded. What'll I do? What'll I do? What an unusual view. I could stand the sight of worms And look at microscopic germs But Technicolor pachyderms Is really too much for me! An elephant danced as five others jumped out. The first was purple and yellow spots; the second, with light and dark blue curved stripes; the third, with horizontal hot pink and dark pink lines; The fourth had green and blue vertical lines, and the fifth, fully pink. I am not the type to faint When things are odd or things Are quaint But seein' things you know there ain't Can certainly give you an awful fright What a sight! A monster came walking as every arm, leg, foot, hand, and torso were of elephant heads, and Sandy backed up on her toes as it came near her. She stared at it as the blue heads came to her, then the yellow pushed through. His eyes turned into the pyramids of Egypt that swigged and stood still. . Chase 'em away! Chase 'em away! I'm afraid, need your aid Pink elephants on parade! Hey, hey, hey Pink elephants! Pink elephants! Pink elephants… As the singer's voices faded away, a pink elephant in the form of a camel walked slowly past a pyramid as it turned into a musician playing the fife. The camel-elephant transformed to a serpent as it slithering, with its' sharp fangs baring. It changed it's shape to an elephant belly dancer as it swung it's hips from side to side and faded into a green eyeball and disappeared into air. A quartet of yellow elephants came up blaring the trumpets as they pulled up a curtain with two masks of comedy and drama. The curtains tore apart as an elephant couple danced in sync and grace, as they swung each other, the female climbed up the male's trunk as in a graceful swan dive, dove into the water. A pink elephant rowed its' self into a boat and looked through a telescope, and saw a white elephant popping out of the water making a pose like Venus spraying water from her trunk and squirted at him. She then ran in swift steps as she skated on the black surface with spins and twirls along with her partner and they couple skated away into the darkness. Then two elephants came down skiing a hill as they covered themselves in the snow and shivered from the cold. The elephants emerged from the snow and transformed from blue to red. A lighting bolt was zapped in between as the danced around with it, and got detached from the short elephant. The red elephant rubbed the lightning bolt on his rear end as he danced madly. As the tall elephant threw the lightning bolt at the smaller one, it exploded and more pink elephants appeared and danced to a jig with their partners in content. It was a wave of madness as they turned into various vehicles zooming past Sandy, Dumbo, and Timothy. There came a huge explosion as everything went black and the girl's eyes were filled with lead as she passed out in deep slumber.[Chapter 15] Dawn broke into the golden sky as pink clouds shone as a new day came and lighted on the tall tree. In the tree, a group of four crows perched at a branch and something caught their interest. \"Well, looky here, looky here!\" a small crow in a red sweater, with a blue hat and pink glasses named Specks said. \"My, my!\" Preacher said. He wore a gray vest and hat with glasses at the tip of his beak. \"Why this is the most irregular!\" \"Well, I can't just believe my eyes!\" another crow named Dopey said in a blue and red striped shirt and straw hat rubbed his eyes. \"They ain't dead, is they?\" Specks asked. \"No. Dead people don't snore,\" a fat crow named Fats wearing a red vest and blue hat asked. \"Or do they?\" The birds continued to mutter among themselves as their leader, Jim Crow came. He wore a purple and red-violet striped shirt, a blue vest, pink spats a brown bowler hat with a blue feather, and held a cigar in his beak. \"Uh, wh-what's all the ruckus?\" Jim asked as the crows flew away to make room, and he paced back and forth between the branch. \"Come on, step aside, brother. Hmm, what's cookin' 'round here? What's the good news? What's fryin', boy?\" \"Jim look down there, brother,\" Specks said. \"And prepare yourself for a shock,\" Fats added. Jim Crow looked down to see a baby elephant sleeping on a tree branch, with a mouse sleeping in his trunk. On the next branch was a human girl. She was curled up in a fetal position as she slept soundly, with her shoes missing and her hair curls in a mess. \"HA! Well, hush my beak!\" Jim exclaimed as he flipped on the branch. \"Go ahead, wake 'em up, brother,\" Specks said. \"Yeah. Find out what they're doin' up here,\" Dopey said. \"Yeah,\" Preacher added. \"And ask them what they want,\" Fats suggested. \"Okay, boys. Leave it to me,\" Jim assured them. He flew down to the sleeping trio, and landed on the calf's belly. He leaned over to where Timothy was snoring in Dumbo's curled up trunk. Jim inhaled his cigar and poof out smoke from his beak, waking up Timothy. The mouse coughed as he lazily sat up and smacked his dry lips. He stared dumbly at the bird raising his eyebrows at him. \"Ohh! Those pink elephants,\" Timothy groaned as he rubbed his head. \"Ho! Pink elephants? Mm-mmm!\" the leader exclaimed. The other crows began to crack up at the thought. \"What's so funny?\" Timothy asked. \"What are you boys doin' down here, anyway? \"What are we doin' down here?\" Jim exclaimed. \"Well, hear him talk.\" He called to his brother crows, who laughed again. \"Go on. Fly up a tree where you belong,\" the mouse said as he lies back down to sleep. Jim inhaled more of his cigar and created a smoke hole on the mouse. \"Say, look here, Brother Rat,\" Jim said. \"Brother Rat?\" Timothy snapped as he sobered up. \"Now listen. I ain't your brother and I ain't no rat, see?\" \"Uh-huh, and I suppose no you, and no elephant, and no girl ain't up in no tree, and on such tall heights either,\" the leader said. \"No! No, me and no tree ain't up no- Huh? Tree?\" Timothy's eyes widened as he looked up and down, and gasped. His distraction got interrupted as he heard a moaning on the next branch. Sandy sat up as her skull was filled with arrows that shot through her brain and beatings in the bones. Her eyes were sunken in and her lips were blue. She removed the hair from her mouth and cleared her forehead. \"Oh my head….\" she murmured. \"But man, what a night! I certainly have a headache from all the pink elephants. Even from that dancing.\" \"Huh? A dancin' girl?\" Jim cracked up in hysterical laughter with the other crows. \"Well I guess the sister girl is awake too.\" \"Hey, what's a bunch of buzzards like you doing here?\" she asked as she rubbed her eyes. \"Hey Sandy, I wouldn't look down if I were you,\" Timothy warned. \"Don't look down? Why?\" She asked skeptically. \" 'Cause you're up in them heights girl,\" Jim said. \"What?\" the girl raised her eyebrows. She reached her foot down on the ground and realized that she could not feel the grass or her carpet from her tent. \"What the? Where's the ground?\" Jim Crow looked at her with a smirk and pointed down with his wing. Sandra's eyes slowly traveled downwards. She froze and gasped. She was high up in the tree and the drop was deep. She screamed in horror; she worked herself into a panic attack as she gripped the tree branch with all her might and shut her eyes tight. \"AHHHHHHHH! Oh no, not again!\" she cried. Sandy's panicking had somehow affected Timothy too, as after seeing her gripping her branch, he crawled across Dumbo's trunk to his face while Jim continued to smoke his cigar in pride. \"Dumbo! Dumbo! Wake up Dumbo!\" the mouse laid his back on the elephant's face as his blues eyes opened. \"Don't look now, but I think we're up in a tree.\" In curiosity, Dumbo looked down and instantly jumped up in fright. He bounced on the branch and grabbed onto it with his proboscis, holding on for his life. Without warning, the branch snapped and the poor baby elephant toppled down each branch with the mouse. \"Dumbo! Timothy!\" Sandy screamed as she tried to catch him, and with one hand, her fingers began to slip, as she clutched on. Unfortunately, she lost her grip and began to topple down the tree. She crashed from one branch to the next, as her mouth was full of leaves, the branches scratched her face, and soon splashed into the pond landing on her butt. Sandra sat up, and coughed out the water and rubbed her inflamed nose to soothe it. She looked over to see Dumbo with his legs up in the water. He then sat up and held the branch with his proboscis, he lifted it up to see Timothy holding onto it and was soaking wet. The girl brushed the leaves and branches out of her hair as she stood up from the pond. The crows flew down to a fence and began to laugh at the trio's misfortune, thinking it was hilarious. Timothy glared at them, as he dried himself off. \"Aw, don't pay no attention to them scarecrows, come on guys, let's get back to the circus,\" Timothy said. The blonde clutched her skirt to twist it and squeeze out the water. Dumbo walked out as he shook himself dry and clutched onto the mouse's tail to follow him. \"So long boys!\" Jim called. \"Even you girl!\" \"Oh shut up you buzzards!\" Sandy snapped as she shook her fist at them, blew a raspberry and turned away catching up with Dumbo and Timothy. She crossed the branch that was a bridge and slowly walked behind her friends. As they walked, they all thought about how they got up the tree. \"Hey Timothy, how the heck did we get up that tree?\" \"Hm, I don't know,\" he shrugged. Timothy looked back to see the tree with broken branches and it brought up different theories in his mind. They continued to walk as they kept thinking. \"I must've climbed up there and passed out. But I wonder how Dumbo was able to get up there?\" Sandy asked. \"Now let's see, elephants can't climb trees, can they?\" he asked and then shook his head. \"Nah, nah, that's ridiculous.\" \"Maybe you jumped up?\" Sandy asked and shook her head. \"Nope, elephants can't jump, it's way too high.\" \"Hey there fellas, maybe you all flew up,\" Jim called. \"Maybe we flew up. Yeah maybe we….\" Timothy suddenly froze and his face beamed to excitement. \"THAT'S IT! Dumbo you flew! Boy am I stupid? Why didn't I think of this before? Your ears. Just look at 'em, Dumbo. Why, they're perfect wings! The very things that held ya down are gonna carry ya up and up and up!\" Sandy jumped back to watch the mouse motion to the calf's ears and jumped up and down as if he were flying. \"You mean, that Dumbo flew?\" Timothy ignored her as he went hysterical. \"I can see it all now! Dumbo: The Ninth Wonder of the Universe! The world's only flyin' elephant!\" Timothy shouted in joy. The girl thought about it and grew skeptical, and she rolled her eyes, thinking it was another stupid idea. \"Are you sure about this Timothy?\" Before the mouse could answer her, the crows hollowed in laughter on the fence. They all thought it was a silly idea to hear about an elephant flying. They all spoke out their thoughts. \"Did you ever see an elephant fly?\" Specks asked. \"Well, I've seen a horse fly,\" Preacher said. \"I've seen a dragon fly,\" Fats added. \"I've seen a house fly,\" Dopey said. The crows all hollowed in laughter, the girl groaned as they acted were acting stupid and rude to Dumbo. \"I've seen all that too!\" Jim exclaimed as he tapped his cigar. He began to sing as a showstopper and danced on the fence. I seen a peanut stand, heard a rubber band I seen a needle that winked its eye But I be done seen 'bout ev'rything When I see an elephant fly The leader flew down and landed in front of the trio. Timothy glared at him as he placed his hands on his hips and tapped his foot in annoyance. (What d'you say, boy?) Fats sang. Jim sang as he continued to do a scat dance and walked towards Timothy making him back up against Dumbo's leg. He danced forward tipping off his hat and moving his cigar with a smirk. Timothy grunted in irritation as he threw his face into his hands. Sandy rolled her eyes and crossed her arms. I said when I see an elephant fly I seen a front porch swing, heard a diamond ring I seen a polka-dot railroad tie But I be done seen 'bout ev'rything When I see an elephant fly Specks imitated a trumpet on his beak, as his puckered his hat over it. Straw Hat and Preacher scat on the fence and danced together in a swing, side by side with the rhythm of jazz. The two crows took turns singing along with Fats. I saw a clothes horse, he r'ar up and buck And they tell me that a man made a vegetable truck I didn't see that, I only heard But just to be sociable, I'll take your word I heard a fireside chat, I saw a baseball bat And I just laughed till I thought I'd die. Jim came up to Dumbo, and held onto his trunk and sang into his nose. He released it and pulled onto Sandy's skirt dragging her feet on the ground. He released it and leaped in the sky. But I be done seen 'bout ev'rything When I see an elephant fly He danced along with Specks singing the bebop, which was faster paced as they danced in a circle. Sandy gave them a glare thinking the song was not funny at all. The more Sandy and Timothy heard it; it made them so angry and poor Dumbo never felt so embarrassed in his life. Jim and Specks joined in with others on the fence as they finished the song and flew up in the sky. Well I be done seen 'bout ev'rything When I see an elephant fly (With the wind) When I see an elephant fly[Chapter 16] As soon as the Crows finished their song, they all started to laugh in hysterics. Timothy glared at all of them, he stormed over and jumped on top of a tin can and was ready to give them a piece of his mind. Sandy came over to where he stood and glared at all of them too. Enough was enough! \"All right you wise boys!\" he shouted as he threw his hat down. \"This has gone far enough now!\" \"All of you!\" Sandra snapped. \"Shut your beaks!\" \"Quiet gentlemen,\" Jim Crow said as the laughing stopped. \"Reverend Rodent and Sister Sassy is gonna hot rash you!\" \"You oughta be ashamed of yourselves,\" Timothy said. \"A bunch of big guys like you, pickin' on a poor little orphan like him.\" He gestured to Dumbo and continued. \"Suppose you was torn away from his mother, when he was just a baby! Nobody to tuck you in at nights, no warm, soft, caressing trunk to snuzzle into. How would you like to be left in a cold, cruel heartless world? And why? I ask ya, why?! Just because he's got those big ears, they call him a freak! The laughing stock of the circus! Then when his mother tired to protect him, they threw her into the clink, and on top of that, they made him a clown! Socially, he's washed up!\" As he spoke the words, the crows immediately began to feel emotion and were driven with tears and remorse. Even though Sandy noticed that, she decided that they needed another sad story to hear. She then stepped in to tell them hers. \"Not only that, but I was humiliated last night thanks to those stupid, dumb clowns! When I first came to the circus, they and the workers began to spread rumors, and accused me of being a witch, and performing rituals of witchcraft! But I am a Wiccan, and I perform rituals for healing, herbal medicines, and speak to animals. When I was just a little girl, a poacher killed my mother, when we freed a baby elephant in Africa. He showed no mercy or regret for his actions. I continue to blame myself for her death, and felt I brought shame on my family.\" The crows flinched and were driven to more tears on hearing the death and sacrifice of a mother. She allowed it to sink into them, before continuing. \"Everyone thinks my Wiccan heritage is a bunch of nonsense and has no meaning, but to me, it is not, and it does have a meaning! I was called a half-breed, because I was born from two different religions and no cares that I accepted both of them as a balance! Even when I once fell from the trapeze bar when some stupid drunk idiot blasted the cannon causing the man to crash into me, the strings on the trapeze bars broke and I landed on the ground breaking my leg! Since then, I've been afraid of heights. Those stupid clowns decided to haul me up in the air, and they threw food, paint, and glue at me! They ruined my reputation, and it was a horrible thing to do, not only to me, but to Dumbo!\" \"Yeah, she's right. Ah but what's the use of talkin' to you coldhearted birds?\" Timothy shouted as he kicked his hat. \"Go ahead, have your fun. Laugh at him. Kick him, now that he's down. Go on! We don't care!\" Timothy blew his nose, hopped off the can and walked back to Dumbo with Sandy following him with her head down. \"Come on Dumbo,\" he said. The baby elephant grabbed onto his tail and followed him sadly. The girl once more lost hope again for Dumbo. \"Hey brother, sister, wait a minute,\" Jim said as he jumped off the fence and walked towards them. \"Uh, don't go away feelin' like that.\" Sandy turned back with a look of gloom on her face, and gave them a look. She looked back to see Timothy storming off. Jim caught up with the mouse and stopped him by wrapping his arm around him. \"We done see the light, you guys is okay,\" he said. \"Please, you've done enough,\" Timothy shoved him away and tried to leave. \"We're not the mood,\" Sandy warned him as she towered over the bird. \"Well, but we's all fixin' to help you. Uh, ain't that the truth, boys?\" he asked. The rest of the crows flew down and agreed. They gathered around the leader as he guided Timothy to them. The blonde looked over. \"Wait, you want to help Dumbo fly?\" she asked. The crows nodded at her, and her eyes widened. \"You wanna make the elephant fly, don't ya?\" Jim asked as he, the mouse, and his friends gathered in a circle. \"Well, you gotta use a lot of 'chology,\" \"Um, don't you mean, psychology,\" Sandra said, correcting him. \"Yeah,\" Jim said. \"Now, here's what you do.\" The crows gathered in a circle with Timothy as the leader whispered some instructions. Sandy stood by Dumbo as they tried to listen, but they could not hear him. Specks was trying to get into the group for the discussion, unfortunately, he could not get in. Jim plucked a feather from the back of Speck's tail and handed it over to Timothy. \"Use the magic feather,\" he said. \"Catch on?\" \"The magic feather?\" Timothy said taking it, and then understood. \"Yeah, I gotcha.\" He turned over to the calf and the girl and ran towards them in excitement. \"Dumbo! Look! Have I got it! The magic feather! Now you can fly!\" Dumbo held the 'magic feather' in his proboscis and did not understand what this meant. The girl raised her eyebrows in suspicion, thinking this is another trick. \"Are you sure this is going to work Timothy?\" Sandy asked skeptically. She placed her hand down, and the mouse stepped onto her palm. She brought him up to her eye level. \"I'm afraid this may not work and I don't want to see him hurt. Mrs. Jumbo may not forgive me if anything happened to her baby.\" \"Don't worry Sandy, this may boost up Dumbo's esteem, and we'll find a place where he could take off to fly. I promise, this maybe his only chance to become a star attraction,\" he said. \"Yeah, Brother is right Sister Sassy,\" Jim said as he flapped his wings. She held out her other hand to let the bird sit on her finger. \"Here's what ya gotta do, go to the bottom of the cliff. Stay there and watch us, I promise we ain't gonna hurt a hair on him.\" \"Well, all right, I'll be watching,\" she said. \"Promise me you won't hurt him?\" \"We promise,\" he said earnestly. Later on, they all came up to a steep cliff. While Timothy, Dumbo, and the crows stood at the rock that jutted out at the edge of the cliff. Sandra climbed down the steep path and carefully she did not fall. She came out to a field to watch as the crows pushed and encouraged Dumbo to flap his ears while Timothy balanced on his trunk. She watched as Dumbo was hesitant to jump off the cliff, but from the look in his eyes, he was determined to do it. The girl stood there and watched with concern, hope, and worry for the baby elephant. Dumbo began to flap his ears up and down, as he flapped them harder, and it created a huge cloud of dust that blocked the girl's view. The dust soon cleared up as the girl coughed out the dust from her lungs. She looked up to see her friends, up on the cliff. \"Oh, it's no use,\" she said. \"I guess that was just another one of their….\" She then saw a shadow passing over her, she looked up and gasped to see Dumbo flying in the air, with Timothy riding in his hat and the crows flew with him cheering. \"DUMBO! YOU'RE FLYING! YOU'RE FLYING!\" She cried in joy and ran across the field to follow him, and ignored the rocks and branches that cut into her feet. The crows flew around Dumbo complimenting that his flying was not so bad, but amazing! \"Uh, why he flies just like an eagle!\" Specks exclaimed. \"That's better than an airplane,\" Fats added. \"Brother, now I've seen everything!\" Jim said. The crows sang their song again, but this time it was much kinder than the one from earlier. They flew downwards as Dumbo followed them with confidence and a happy smile. But I be done seen about everything When I see an elephant fly (With the wind) When I see an elephant fly! The crows ended their song as they landed on the wire of the electric poles and flew off when Dumbo landed. His weight pressed on the wires, but he managed to balance on them, and the crows perched on his ears, while Jim sat on the calf's hat. Sandy came to the edge of the poles and was out of breath from the run. Her grin grew wider and wider in excitement of Dumbo's ability to fly. \"You did it Dumbo!\" she called. \"Dumbo, I knew you could do it!\" Timothy screamed in excitement as he balanced on his trunk and held the magic feather. \"Wait'll we get to the big town!\" \"Boy, them city folks is sure in for a surprise!\" Jim Crow said as he laughed. Dumbo flew down from the power lines with his head held high and Sandra threw her arms around him. \"I'm so happy for you Dumbo! I always knew that your ears make you special! Your mother was right, she knew that you will be a star!\" \"You're darn right she is!\" Timothy agreed. \"Now that we know Dumbo can fly, it's time for me to face my fears,\" she gasped. \"Oh no, my brothers! My uncle! They must be wandering where I am!\" \"Oh yeah you're right!\" Timothy said. \"Good luck fellas!\" Jim said. \"Ya'll have it in ya! You show 'em what ya got!\" \"Thanks guys! We don't know where we'd get the idea, if it weren't for you!\" she said. The crows cheered and laughed in joy. \"C'mon, we better head back to the circus,\" Timothy said. \"Right, we'll see you later!\" The girl, the mouse and the elephant began their long walk back to the circus and they were all filled with confidence and pride for the performance tonight, with that, Mrs. Jumbo will be finally free. But, Sandy had to do a few things with her uncle. She looked at the side of the road to see a pile of brown dirt. \"Oh that reminds me, I need to get some dirt,\" she said. \"Why would you need dirt Sandy?\" Timothy asked. She knelt down to scoop handfuls up and used her skirt to carry them. Once she had enough, she cradled the dirt up in her arms and looked at her friends. \"To throw it at someone I have to deal with once we get back.\"[Chapter 17] When morning returned to the circus, James and Robert went to Sandy's tent to check on her and discovered she was not in her bed. The brothers searched around the whole circus area with no luck, Sandy, Dumbo (and Timothy) were anywhere to be seen. \"Sandy?\" Robert called. \"Where could she be James?\" \"I don't know,\" the dark haired boy replied. \"Why don't we check the elephant tent?\" The boys came into the larger tent and there were the other elephants huddled in a circle eating their hay. The peered behind the curtain and heard the ladies gossiping. \"Well that was some performance last night,\" Prissy said. \"I can't believe that the clowns would haul that girl up in the air. And she let out an immature tantrum in the tent!\" \"After all, she is a worthless wench who deserves to not be a Wiccan or whatever and curse the whole circus,\" the Matriarch agreed. \"Even Dumbo got his medicine and brought disgrace here.\" \"Oh yes, that's right,\" Giddy said as the other elephants agreed. \"Well, last night I heard the girl laughing hysterically with the little freak, and even the mouse that scared us,\" she shuddered at the mention of mice. \"She's weird and such a s…\" The men's eyebrows furrowed in anger and disgust as the elephants insulted her sister. They decided enough was enough. \"Will you stupid heads shut up?\" Robert snapped. The elephants' ears perked up and turned towards the two young men storming over towards them. \"Wait, you boys can understand us?\" Prissy gasped. James and Robert stopped and gave them a dirty look. \"As a matter of fact, yes,\" James replied sternly. \"We can understand what you're saying and we have the same gift and blood as our sister from our mother. Which makes us Wiccans.\" \"We'd like to know if you've seen our sister?\" Robert added. \"As a matter of fact, no,\" the Matriarch said. \"But is your sister the dumb blonde witch, who can understand and speak to us?\" \"In fact, yes she is our beloved sister and she is not a dumb blonde,\" Robert replied bluntly. \"Shame on you for insulting our sister, and what is blocking your thick heads from accepting her and that baby elephant she considers as her friend.\" \"Oh really? Does this mean that Dumbo could be your friend too?\" Catty mocked. \"Oh yeah? Then what gives you the right to insult our sister?\" the blonde demanded. \"Well, the brat deserves to be seen and not heard, her disgrace brings shame to the whole circus and decreases its' own dignity,\" the elderly elephant responded. \"Well, then, since you won't respect and accept our sister, we're not going to give you any hay for the rest of the day,\" James said. \"What?\" Prissy gasped. \"What gives you the right to not give us our hay?\" Catty glared at them. \"By our uncle, the Ringmaster,\" Robert snapped back. \"He has placed us in charge of you elephants in addition to our sister. And since you refused to show any respect for the three of us, it's time you get some punishment for that.\" \"You can't do that,\" Giddy whined. \"We'll starve if we don't have our hay.\" \"Sorry, but we can and we are,\" James snapped. \"Besides, it's high time you overstuffed haybags lose some weight, so missing a couple of meals won't starve you to death.\" He turned to his brother. \"Come on Robert, let's look for our sister.\" As they left the tent, they heard the elephants continue on their complaints along with their rumor discussion, but the young men ignored them and continued their search. They came near the clown tent and discovered an almost half-empty water barrel, an odd item caught Robert's eye. He reached and grabbed a bottle of champagne, and his eyes widened in horror as he saw a cup near by along with a shoe. \"Oh no!\" The brothers grew worried and went to the Ringmaster's tent. They told him about Sandy's disappearance and how they could not find her, showing the bottle. They all made a plan, soon the three of them, along with Joe and Ben (the only clown sympathetic to Sandy and Dumbo) traveled across the countryside to search for the girl and the elephant with a dog smelling her scent. Hours passed as they continued to walk on the dirt path, and talked. \"You know, I still don't understand why Sandra got so upset and lose her temper in the first place?\" Harold said. \"I think she was trying to stand up for herself and that baby elephant,\" James said. \"You know how sensitive she gets when people act cruel around animals.\" \"Yes, I know, but I don't know where she gets her temper and makes people cower from her.\" \"I have to agree with James, she mostly scares people if they flinch from her shouts. She must have your temper, and would never shout at animals and abuse them like you do!\" \"Why you!\" the Ringmaster glared as he was about to attack his youngest nephew. \"Robert! Uncle Harold!\" the elder Williams boy warned. His stern voice caused both the man and the young boy to break apart. \"I'm sorry James, I just really don't know Sandy that well,\" the Ringmaster sighed as they continued to walk on the dirt path. \"You know Uncle Harold. None of us really ever asked Sandy what she wanted.\" \"What do you mean?\" Joe asked. \"I thought she got what she wanted.\" \"I mean, none of you never listened to her about her ideas and what she saw. But you were all stubborn and have blocks on your empty heads,\" the brunette said. \"He's right, you know,\" Robert added. \"Yes, but even still, she didn't have to be so…\" suddenly the Ringmaster's hat flew off with a smack. He turned around to his workers. \"Joe, Ben, did you throw something at me?\" \"No boss, it wasn't me,\" Joe said as Ben shook his head. He turned around and another smack came to his face, he brushed it off realizing it was dirt and spat it out from his mouth in disgust. He cleared his eyes to see the girl, with the baby elephant coming towards him. She was holding handfuls of dirt in her hands, she stopped and she gave him a glare, her curls were messy and she lost both of her shoes. Sandy, Timothy, and Dumbo had walked along the path to track their way back to the circus, with the blonde girl having found her shoe on the ground and held it in her hand. She heard voices nearby, and she stopped to see her family and other circus workers trudging along the path and heard the discussion. The mouse hid in the calf's hat so the men would not see him. She picked up a clump of dirt she carried in her skirt, and tossed it over towards her uncle, only for the dirt to fly over and hit his hat. She watched him turn back, and when he turned to the front, she threw more dirt, hitting at him directly in the face. His gloved hand wiped away the soil and he spat it out and looked up at her. She saw her brothers and the men watching her as she stormed to them, and made a hard halt. \"What? Stubborn? Angry? Cold-hearted? Well, maybe I am all of those things, okay?\" \"Sandy! Where have you been? Your brothers and I were worried sick about you!\" The ringmaster came over to throw his arms around her in relief. Instead of pushing him away, the blonde girl put an arm's distance between herself and him. She gave him a firm expression on her face. \"Look, I'm really sorry about that fiasco last night Uncle Harold. I shouldn't have lost my temper and beat those clowns. I just needed to blow off some steam. I know I shouldn't have stormed off when I was so angry.\" \"That's all right, I admit the clowns did deserve it. But there was this one question that came up from last night that really confused me, did your mother really died in a car accident? You said last night that she was killed by poacher.\" Sandy's widened, she didn't realize that mentioned part of the truth. She sighed sadly knowing it was time for her to tell her uncle what really happened. She looked up at him with guilt in her eyes. \"Actually, the story of Momma dying in a car accident was a lie. I knew this day would come, when I would have to tell you, the sad, and shameful truth. One that I thought of you not listening.\" \"Tell me what happen, and I promise I'll listen this time.\" She looked up to see her brothers, Timothy, and Dumbo nodding encouragingly at her. She sat on a log and looked at the men and spoke in a narrative voice. \"Well, it all started back in the summer of 1935; when my parents, James, and Robert were in Africa for another vacation and research….\" The girl explained the story thoroughly and took deep breaths to calm her, and continued. The ringmaster listened carefully and took in every detail to hear. Even Joe and Ben listened too as she explained about the day of the safari ride and where she got to the baby elephant caught in a snare. \"As soon as Momma and I freed that baby elephant, the poacher arrived. He was the one who caught the baby elephant we just set free. He was angry with us for releasing his game. My mother and I tried to escape, but he caught up with me and tried to kill me. Momma shoved him away and fought with him, and she sacrificed herself and took the shots that ended her life.\" The Ringmaster's eyes widened in horror and his eyes were watering from hearing the tragic story. Joe and Ben were in tears to hear the ending of a mother's love for her daughter. \"Oh Sandy, I can't believe that your mother was killed that way! Why would someone so cruel kill her?\" The Ringmaster asked as he wiped his eyes. \"I don't know,\" she sighed. \"All I know is that he doesn't respect life for animals and that they have no souls.\" \"Why didn't you, your father, or brothers ever tell me?\" \"Because, it would've given me heartache and more shame not on myself, but for others, even you. I've never forgiven myself for that, and it would kill me if you knew or found out. I felt that you didn't deserve to know and would've blamed me for it. I felt that I failed my own family, disappointed them, and gave disgrace on my mother's bloodline.\" James and Robert came up to her and the eldest brother placed his hand on her cheek and said, \"Sandra, I know we've spoke this over a million times and you know well that Momma's death was not your fault. Our ancestors would never blame you as long as you carry the gift and blood of your Wiccan heritage. They'd always be proud of what you did for animals and people in need.\" Sandy smiled and she wiped away a tear from her eye, and looked up in the sky, remembering how the spirits of her ancestors and mother encouraged her not to give up. Then, she looked back at the men, and wiped away the sweat from her bangs. The Ringmaster sniffed her, and his nose tinged in revulsion. \"Sandy, have you been drinking last night?\" \"Me, drinking?\" the girl's eyes widened and scoffed. \"No, of course not! I don't drink alcohol.\" \"Oh yeah, that reminds me,\" Robert said. \"How did you end up in the countryside? Last night you disappeared and we looked all over for you this morning, did you run away?\" \"No, I didn't. All I remembered last night, that Dumbo, Timothy, and I were drinking out from Dumbo's water barrel. I know I went against the rules, but I took Dumbo to visit his mother for a little while to cheer him up. Dumbo was having the hiccups from crying so we stopped by the water barrel for a drink. I joined in with Dumbo and Timothy, but it tasted really funny, and I started to see pink elephants, even acted crazy while I was dancing.\" \"Pink elephants?\" Ben raised his eyebrow in confusion. \"It felt so weird, as if I were in a nightmare and by the next morning, I was high up in a tree, got scared, and fell into the pond. Which, I will never do it again.\" \"You climbed up a tree?\" Harold's eyes widened. \"Yes, I probably ran with Dumbo, climbed up the tree and passed out,\" she said nodding. \"I think this may explain the taste, Robert and I found this in the water bowl.\" James held out a bottle of champagne and the girl's eyes widened in confusion. \"There was champagne in the water and someone must have knocked it in. That's what made you and your friends drunk,\" Robert said. \"I was drunk?\" Sandy gasped in surprise. \"No wonder that water tasted different and I was seeing things and I think I know who did it.\" \"Oh yeah, I remembered when we went to the boss, one of them clowns backed up into a table and knocked the champagne into the water.\" Ben said. \"We all went to bed after the boss stood up for you, he's never given us a lecture before.\" He faced Sandy with an apologetic tone in his voice. \"I'm awfully sorry, of how I treated you, Sandy. I did felt sympathy for you when you lashed out at us.\" Sandy turned to the clown, whom she almost killed and saw the purple marks on his neck. She sighed in shame. \"I'm sorry I strangled you Ben, I probably would've killed you and broke your neck from last night,\" she said. \"Please forgive me.\" \"It's all right, I probably deserved that and I forgive ya,\" he said. \"Thank you,\" she smiled and turned to the Ringmaster, he has guilt written all over his face, his face was growing with emotion. \"I'm really sorry Sandy, I was an irresponsible, selfish, man. I know I was trying to run the circus as best as I can, but I have no excuse to treat you or Dumbo with cruelty. Oh, about the argument we had on the train, I apologized to you while you were sleeping, and I was mad at myself for hurting you. Can you forgive me?\" \"Actually I knew that,\" she said. \"Wait, you were awake?\" He asked and looked at her with serious eyes. \"Well, when I heard the footsteps coming near, I immediately got into a position and pretended I was asleep. I didn't want anyone to hear or see me cry, I heard you speaking to me as I had my eyes closed, even when you kissed me on the forehead and cheek and looked at the locket of my mother. I noticed you borrowed my book, Black Beauty. I wasn't too upset, I decided to let you borrow it for a while, until you were done. Oh, that reminds me. Is this true? Were you in love with Momma?\" The Ringmaster's face was drained in shock, he nodded his head and took a deep breath looking at her. \"Is this the reason why you were harsh at me, and never to my ideas, because I reminded you so much of my mother?\" she asked. Harold gave a heavy sigh, \"Yes, it was stupid of me to act harsh at you. Because the woman I loved once, didn't loved me, and only loved your father. She told me that she accepted me as her friend, I realized, that I should let her go, and let her follow her heart. I hadn't fell in love again since. Are you angry about this?\" The blonde pressed her lips in a straight line, thinking about the truth. She took a deep breath and looked at her uncle. \"I'm not angry, I'm just disappointed. I come to realize that you were doing the right thing. Things would have been different if Momma made a different choice. But let's agree that we've come to an understanding. I will forgive you soon. Anyway, Dumbo has discovered a new ability for tonight's performance, and it'll be one to remember for tonight,\" she continued. \"I see,\" the ringmaster said. \"What about you? You haven't swung the trapeze bars yet.\" \"Actually, I'm going to do it Uncle Harold. Sandra Williams is going to fly the trapeze tonight!\" she said with confidence. The ringmaster's smile grew wider and wider, he knew that his niece would have the courage to face her fears, and even her brothers knew their sister would be strong enough against the stupid clowns. \"Oh and about my book, have you finished reading it?\" Sandy asked. \"Oh, I'm sorry for borrowing your book without your permission. It looked so interesting, I thought I should give it a try. That book was really, really amazing. I could see why you and your mother loved this book. I came to realize that it has so much emotion, pain, but joy in there. I think I'd better recommend this book to others.\" \"I see,\" Sandy chuckled. \"I'm sure they would love to read it.\" \"Are you ready to head back Ms. Williams?\" Joe asked. \"Yes, Joe, I am,\" she said. \"But once we get back to the circus, I'm getting rid of all the booze. I don't want any more animals or performers to get drunk. I could also use your help.\"[Chapter 18] Soon, the group came back to the circus, along with the girl holding her head up high, and she ignored the clowns who gave her dirty looks. She arrived back into her tent, with Dumbo curling up on the bed to take a nap and Timothy decided to do the same. Once her animal friends were settled, she got herself freshened up by washing her face, and combing her hair. The blonde turned to her brothers, and gave then a nod. \"Come on boys, let's go dump some bottles.\" Sandy, James, and Robert went into the clown's tent and found the crate where it contained all the alcohol, beer, and champagne. She gave her brothers a nod, and all the siblings grabbed each of the bottles, hurried out of the tent and uncorked the caps and poured the liquid down the city drain. The sounds of the liquid pouring from the bottles, shuddered her ears. But it was for the best. With a couple of bottles left, Sandy suddenly stopped and a mischievous grin grew on her face. \"Hey James, Robert, I have an idea.\" \"What is it sis?\" James asked. \"Remember how we used to pull pranks around the circus and how we did this one to the clowns and when our uncle fell for it too? He got so mad at us!\" \"Oh yeah,\" Robert said smirking at the memory. \"Are you thinking what we're thinking?\" Sandy gave a nod. The siblings gathered around in a circle to discuss their plan on the clowns. Once the discussion was over, they grabbed the large empty bottles and took one each to go to different spots in the circus. The clowns came back into their tent after training, and they were all looking forward to perform their next show and humiliate Dumbo once more. Not only that, they were all looking forward to having a drink of beer. \"Boy, it's a shame we won't be humiliating the girl again, but it'll be swell that we'll humiliate the freak when he jumps off the highest platform we created,\" Dennis said. \"Yeah, that girl's worthless, but we'll get over it,\" Gary added. \"Come on ya'll let's have a drink,\" Arthur said. One of the clowns uncorked one of the big three bottles, and poured the liquid into each of the glasses and all took a swig. None of them noticed that the alcohol was switched and tasted very salty. \"Hmmm… this booze tastes funny,\" Jock said. They continued to drink more, and suddenly made their stomachs quench. \"Wait a minute,\" Ken sniffed the liquid and his eyes widened in horror. \"Is this pee?\" \"What?\" All the clowns were immediately grossed out, they begin to gag and spit out the urine in disgust. \"Oh gross!\" Jock cried gagging. \"Who would do that?\" Outside of the tent, Sandy, James, and Robert peeped in to see the clowns falling for their prank. They decided to urinate in bottles and trick the clowns into drinking it, with a little champagne to get back at them. They could barely hold in their laughter as the clowns drank their urine. When they discovered the clowns got pranked, and reacted angrily in disgust, they head into the tent trying to contain their laughter with straight faces. \"Well, well, well, it looks like you fell for our classic prank,\" James said folding his arms. \"So it was you three!\" Hank exclaimed. One of the clowns opened the crate and it was empty. He gasped in horror, and he marched up to the siblings and gave them a glare. \"All right you brats, where is our booze?\" Ed asked. \"My brothers and I got rid of it,\" Sandy replied. The clowns all gasped in horror, as their faces turned red. \"Why would you do that?\" Jock asked angrily. \"Because, one of you purposely, got me and Dumbo drunk by drugging his water. So my brothers and I dumped all the alcohol down in the drain hole near the city street.\" \"How could you? The boss would've prevented you from doin' that!\" Jock shouted. \"We need that to keep us hyper!\" \"Actually, the boss, or our uncle allowed us to do it. After discovering how you drugged our sister and that baby elephant, the boss has given an order that all alcoholic beverages around the circus grounds will be banned from now on,\" Robert said. \"So you might as well get use to it!\" \"You've gotta be kidding us!\" Ed snapped. The clowns growled in anger and left their tent in a huff, and stormed over to the Ringmaster's tent and saw a sign that was up in front of them. And true to the siblings, there was the decree. I, Harold Williams, hereby decide to ban all alcoholic beverages for three months until everyone could not drug any more animals and performers. My niece and nephews have drained all the alcohol down the drains in the cities and will prohibit the stash for everyone's safety. The clowns came into the tent with blood turning hot with all the anger. They came face to face with the ringmaster as he sat at his desk with his head held high. \"Hey boss, we just saw this decree that your kids got rid of our booze! Are you serious right now?\" Jock asked. The ringmaster stared at them and was all surrounded in silence. He kept his face from along with a glare. \"Yes, I am very serious! I am very disappointed at all of you!\" he snapped. \"How could you get my niece and Dumbo drunk? They could get sick and die! I'm now listening to her and decided to go with her request.\" \"Oh really? Well, she and her brothers tricked us into drinking urine and it was disgusting!\" Hank shouted. \"Was it necessary to prank us?\" Ken asked. \"We need our booze!\" \"Absolutely not! I am going straight on this decision and you'll have to deal with it. No more drinking around in this circus! No more getting animals and performers drunk and that's that. Understood?\" The clowns all groaned in frustration and stormed out of the tent in dismay. Back in Sandy's tent, the siblings were all cracking up at their successful prank on the clowns and were all rolling on their sides. \"Oh those clowns had it coming!\" James cried. \"Yeah, I can't believe they fell for it,\" Robert added. \"At least, Uncle Harold didn't yell at us like we did before,\" Sandy said as she sat up. \"Aside from that, I have to face my fears when I fly tonight.\" The brothers' faces smiles then turned into frowns of concern. \"Sandy are you sure you can swing from the trapeze bars?\" James asked. \"It's been a while since you've done it.\" \"I mean you've did other acrobatic acts like rope dancing, performed with performers and all that jazz,\" Robert added. \"Yes, I know I haven't got that much practice. But Momma said that the training is in my heart and soul, so I'm going to prove myself and show them who I am.\" \"She's darn right,\" Timothy said popping out from her bed. \"In fact, your sis has got them guts!\" \"GAHHHH!\" the brothers jumped back in fright. \"Is that a mouse?\" James tried to step on Timothy, but the girl pushed him back, forcing him to land on the ground. She grabbed Timothy and held him close. \"James! No! Don't hurt him! He's my friend!\" Sandy glared as she held the mouse protectively in her palms. \"You're friends with a mouse?\" Robert asked skeptically. \"Yes, this is Timothy I've told you about earlier.\" The brunette slowly relaxed and regained his composure. He came up to the mouse as his sister held him out. \"Oh, so you're Timothy, I'm sorry if I tried to step on you. I didn't mean it.\" \"That's okay. I'm sorry if I spooked you.\" \"Oh don't worry about it, I sometimes get very jumpy. I see that you've been a good friend to Dumbo and our sister.\" \"Oh, she's the most unique human I've ever met, I've never judged her and Dumbo. I'd never leave their sides, as long as I'm here.\" \"Hmm… you don't seem bad at all,\" Robert added. Sandy smiled as her brothers learned to trust Timothy and became fast friends with him. Even they didn't judge Dumbo for his ears and see him as a normal elephant. It was around the early evening as music began to play, almost announcing the show was starting. \"Look guys, show time is starting in two hours, and I have to get ready. So you boys could help Dumbo with his make-up. Once he does his surprise stunt, he'll never have to be a clown again.\" James, Robert, Timothy, and Dumbo left the tent, leaving the girl all alone. She took deep breaths as her herbs flowed around her, with the voices of her ancestors and the divinity to give her the courage to face her fears. The brothers helped Timothy by applying the clown make-up on Dumbo, and they noticed all the other female elephants coming into the big top, and they were all healed from their injuries, and had boastful faces. They ignored them, and focused more on the baby elephant, and Timothy was getting more excited about the plan and stunt. \"Well Dumbo, tonight's the final night, and you won't be a clown again,\" Timothy said. Dumbo smiled in relief and nodded. \"So what's the plan for Dumbo?\" James asked. \"It's a surprise, and if I told ya, ya wouldn't believe me,\" Timothy said. \"This we gotta see,\" Robert added. The makeup soon dried, and the hat was placed on the calf's head. He was about to step out to go to the high platform, and the mouse whistled back. \"Don't forget the magic feather Dumbo,\" Timothy said. Dumbo nodded as the mouse placed the good luck charm in his proboscis, making the baby elephant hold it firmly. After the weeks of suffering abuse, it was time for him to stand up to those who were cruel to him: the clowns, the ringmaster, and the lady elephants. \"Good luck guys, we'll be watching from the curtains,\" James said. \"Go kick some rear end, Dumbo,\" Robert added. Dumbo trumpeted and used his little trunk to grab James and Robert's hands, making the young men smile for them and watch as he walked out with Timothy riding in his hat, waiting for the moment to change the circus forever. Hello fellow readers, I'm sorry this took so long. I had to think of a way to write the chapter of Sandy getting back at the clowns, and how to end this. I'm almost done with writing the story and I might write two more to complete this story, and I'm also going to update on chapter 1, to make it sound better. I will make a special announcement at the end of the story to know what story will be next. So stay tuned for more![Chapter 19] The sun was setting below the city buildings, and the lights of the circus begin to light up the sky with music playing. Sandy sat at her vanity as she applied her make-up and got her hair done. She stood up from her seat as she took one more final look, smoothing out her outfit, as it was washed, dried, and cleaned from the humiliation last night. She stepped out from her tent and headed towards the big top, and she entered with her head held up high. She went over to the list to see the order of acts and learned that her trapeze act is before Dumbo's clown act. Oh my, she thought. I'm right before Dumbo. She looked up to see the trapeze bars getting set up and felt her intestines twisting inside her, and her heart hammered against her sternum. She folded her hands for a quick prayer. \"Oh Goddess, I hope that I won't fall from up there, as I did before. Guide me through the air and don't let anything or anyone bring me down.\" She looked behind the curtains to watch the performers and animals performing their abilities. The smell of candy apples, popcorn, and cotton candy filled the air, hoping to satisfy the empty stomachs of the customers. She backed up from the curtains, and forced herself to take breaths. Breathe in, breathe out. Breathe in, breathe out. Breathe in, breathe out. She felt a tap on her shoulder, and she whirled around to see James and Robert standing before her. They gave her reassuring smiles, and took her hands. \"Good luck Sandy,\" James said. \"You can do this.\" \"Whatever you do, do not look down, and do your best, the Goddess will watch over you,\" Robert added. \"You're right guys,\" Sandy said, smiling. \"I can do this!\" \"Good luck, you got this,\" the brunette added. After a few acts, the trapeze act was announced. Sandy walked out from the curtains and headed towards the ladder. She stopped for a moment as she took another deep breath. She gripped onto the handles of the ladder and began her climb to the big top, she felt her stomach churning inside her body as she told herself, don't look down, don't look down, don't look down, and don't look down. Her palms were sweating as she gripped tightly onto the bars of the cold metal ladder, and goose bumps were forming on her bare arms, legs, and slipper-covered feet. As if time was frozen, she made it to the high platform. Her legs shook and conked her knees together. She stood up straight and closed her eyes to take a deep breath and grip more on the bars of the platform. Inhale, exhale, inhale, and exhale. The drums rumbled, echoing throughout the big top as the trumpets blared, announcing the next act. The spotlight was shone onto the Ringmaster, as he took off his top hat to make his speech. \"Ladies and gentlemen, for the most spectacular night of all, one of the trapeze artists will swing for the first time. She may be a young woman, but she's the strongest, smartest, and serious, with the courage to fly and vowed that she won't let anything bring her down. Give a hand to my niece, Sandy Williams!\" The spotlight shone onto the girl, as the light nearly blinded her. She held up her hands for a pose, making a smile, as the crowd cheered for her. There was absolute silence as the drums rumbled. She saw the trapeze bar hanging five inches above her, and she took another deep breath. Without wasting a moment, she gripped the trapeze bar tightly and took another deep breath. She jumped off the platform and swung in the air as the breeze blew into her flesh. From the moment she swung, she jolted a little bit, praying she wouldn't fall down, like last time. She gripped harder onto the bars as her fists turned white, and felt her heart beating into her ears. She swallowed back, and allowed her long legs to swing forward and back, as the angle and speed was building up faster and faster. Once she gained enough speed, she crouched her knees into her chest and wrapped them onto the bar. She allowed the bar to swing back and forth, as she felt the adrenaline pumping fiercely through her blood. She threw her arms out, to feel the air. She swung towards the other trapeze artist as he swung back and forth. Once he swung close, the blonde released her knees from the bar, as the other trapeze artist gripped her hands. He swung her back and forth and she held on with her muscles growing tired. She swung back up, and was released from the grip and she flew up, turning herself towards the bar and grabbed it just in time and swung back to the platform. She landed on the platform gracefully and stood up as the crowd cheered for her. One more time. The trapeze bar swung back to her, as she performed her act smoothly, and the more she swung and fly, she got better and better at her act. She was feeling ecstasy and she never looked down, and felt arms holding her up, never pulling her down. With another swing, she swung back, and allowed her waist to balance on the bar. She swung high and reached the other trapeze artist, and continued to swing and flip. She felt sweat building up on her brows and face and fought them back. She flipped over by the hands of the artist and he released her, allowing her to fly back to the bar. She swung back to the platform, finishing the trapeze act. The audience below her cheered for her, and she watched the trapeze artist swung around and released his grip, allowing himself to land on the net with a few jumps, and balanced himself, getting off. Sandy knew that this was the moment, and this was what she had to face. She jumped back onto the trapeze bar and swung and flipped over. She released the bar and allowed the adrenaline to flow freely through her blood, and landed on the safety net, bouncing a few times, and took a few deep breaths, sitting up and looking upwards. \"I did it,\" she said to herself. \"I can't believe I did it!\" She slowly climbed down from the safety net and allowed her feet to touch the soft ground. She ran off to where her brothers stood and they were grinning in joy for her. She jumped into their arms, and where embraced in an everlasting hug lifting her up in the air. \"You did it Sandy!\" James said. \"We're so proud of you!\" Robert added. They released her from their hug and smiled at her, knowing what great courage she had. She completed her trapeze act without falling, and nothing brought her down. Sandra gave a heavy sigh of relief as a cool rain, washing away all the weight off her shoulders. \"Well now that's over, Dumbo should be coming up soon and he's going to do the most epic act in all of circus history, that they'll never forget, and Mrs. Jumbo will be finally free,\" she said. \"Hey Sandy,\" the girl turned around to see Joe and Ben coming towards her, and were happy for her. \"Congrats for flying!\" \"Thanks Joe, by the way, there's one thing on my mind, and can I ask you this?\" \"Sure?\" he said unsure. \"Where are the keys to the circus and animal sections?\" \"Oh the keys! The boss has 'em hanging from his pocket. Why'd you need 'em?\" \"Once Dumbo does his act and gives you the surprise, I'll need the keys to unlock the solitary confinement wagon, the one Mrs. Jumbo is in.\" \"Oh gotcha,\" he said, nodding. \"If only you can convince him,\" Ben added. \"Oh he definitely will,\" she said giving a mischievous smile. The trumpets blared announcing the clown act, Ben left to take his place with the others preparing to perform. Sandy, James, Robert, and Joe watched from the curtains to see that the building was a lot taller than the previous one from last night. Sandra felt her gut clutch in fear, staring at the high building, but shook the fear out from her head, knowing it was now it never. Jock was back in his mother elephant costume and was screaming hysterically again and ran around like a maniac. \"Oh baby, whoa!\" The clowns went around their original routine, and four clowns came up to the cream-pie with the trampoline and held it out. They beckoned the baby elephant to hop down. Dumbo stood up on the high platform, no longer afraid of them, was ready to fly with the magic feather in his trunk. Timothy stood at the end of the calf's proboscis, with his tail wrapped around the feather to prevent himself from falling at the high platform. \"Look at that house. Dumbo, you're standing on the threshold of success,\" Timothy said. \"Don't look down. It'll make you dizzy.\" Dumbo balanced himself, knowing this is his chance to prove himself, and this time, no one will tease him anymore. \"Boy, are they in for a surprise. Ho-ho. Got the magic feather?\" Dumbo winked back at him, meaning yes. \"Good.\" The musicians began to tap the drums, making a rumbling sound throughout the big top. The mouse climbed into Dumbo's hat, and he too was ready to be at his best friend's side. \"Okay. Contact! Take off!\" Timothy said as the trumpets blared. Dumbo jumped off of the plank and flew down towards with his ears out, preparing to soar. The fast pacing wind blew so hard against him, and the magic feather in his proboscis flew out. \"Uh-oh. The magic feather!\" Timothy cried. He tried to grab the magic feather, but he was unable to catch it. He knew that he had to admit to the baby elephant about the truth. After looking up, he slowly climbed down the calf's frightened face as he soared down to his death. Timothy halted himself at the end of the trunk, feeling scared. Down, down, and down he went, coming closer and closer to the ground. \"Dumbo, come on. Fly! Open them ears!\" The mouse cried looking at him, throwing his arms in the air. Dumbo could not believe it. The magic feather did not work. He did not know what to do! \"The magic feather was just a gag. You can fly.\" Timothy exclaimed, looking down quickly. \"Honest, you can. Hurry! Open 'em up! Please!\" Back from the curtains, Sandy looked through the binoculars as she watched Dumbo leaped from the plank and flew downwards, James and Robert watched along. Her hands clutched the binoculars as she continued to watch and realized that the feather flew out from his proboscis. \"Oh no!\" the blonde cried. \"He's lost the feather!\" \"What feather?\" James asked. \"When Dumbo, Timothy, and I got drunk and passed out in a tree, we met these crows, who said nasty insults to Dumbo, and Timothy and I gave them a lecture. They changed their minds and decided to help us, by giving Dumbo the 'magic feather' as a good luck charm, to encourage him. So he could fly.\" \"Makes perfect sense,\" Robert remarked. \"I don't know what to do, he's going to get killed, if he doesn't open his ears!\" \"I guess all we could do, is pray,\" James said. \"Even though praying may not help,\" the blonde boy muttered, receiving a glare from his older sister. \"You better believe it, buster,\" she said, poking her finger at his chest. \"How do you pray?\" Joe asked dumbly. Before Dumbo could crash into the pie, he realized that his friend was right, he flew all on his own before, and he could do it again with or without the magic feather. Dumbo opened his ears and soared above the clowns and cream pie, shocking them. The ringmaster stumbled back, his face turned from shock to amazement as he pointed towards the baby elephant soaring above the amazed and stunned audience. \"Whee! We did it! We did it!\" Timothy exclaimed cartwheeling towards Dumbo's hat. \"Let's show 'em, Dumbo. Power dive.\" Dumbo flapped his ears harder, and decided to show what he can do! He swooped down towards the clowns, they all ran for their lives as they all jumped into a water barrel, with Jeff in the fat suit jumping after them, uncorking a cork, with the water draining. The calf swooped towards Arnold a clown, that stood up on a ladder with a bucket of water; he lost his balance and fell into the cream pie splashing over the clowns, and resurfaced glaring at them. The audience hollowed in laughter at the clowns getting a taste of Dumbo's medicine. \"Now, loop the loop,\" Timothy announced. Dumbo flew upside down and swooped down to more clowns that weren't harmed, they all ran towards the fire truck, jumping in and drove it around as the calf soared above them. He over towards Jock dressed in the Mother Elephant outfit, running in terror, but Dumbo caught up to him and pulled off his mask, and the clown tripped in the dirt and looked in horror. The ringmaster gasped seeing the flying calf coming toward him, and knew what was coming, he turned around to run, his foot stepped onto a ball and tripped, diving into a water bucket with his rear end in the air, and Dumbo dropped the elephant mask on him. The whole audience laughed at his misfortune. The clowns riding in the fire truck drove straight towards the house that was on fire. It crashed through the wall, and the clowns scattered around with their bottoms on fire. Dumbo swooped down towards an employee selling peanuts, and sucked them all up in his proboscis while the employee ran with the cart. The lady elephants all looked up in shock to see the calf they picked on was flying in front of their eyes. Dumbo saw his chance, and fired the peanuts at them, they all screamed as the peanuts pelted on them. \"You're makin' history!\" Timothy exclaimed. Back from the curtain, Sandy watched as Dumbo opened his ears and began to soar all over the big top. She jumped up in joy and excitement. \"Oh my goodness he did it! YES!\" she screamed. James and Robert's jaws dropped in shock, but they soon turned to cheers and laughter as they watched the calf giving payback to the clowns, their uncle, and the elephants. Joe stared at the sight dumbly, never occurring to him that Dumbo could really fly. The siblings all laughed at their misfortunes, thinking it was hilarious. They heard their uncle curse in the water barrel, trying to get out as the elephant mask fell off from his rear end. \"Looks like our uncle has learned his lesson,\" James said smirking. \"Let's help him out,\" Robert added. The siblings ran out to the arena where Harold was stuck in the barrel, trying to get out. The boys grabbed the man by the legs and struggled to pull him out. Sandy saw the keys, hanging on a ring by his pocket, and knew one of them lead to the one place she could think of. \"If you don't mind brothers,\" she said. \"I'm going to take the keys.\" \"Be our guest,\" the blond boy smiled. The girl grabbed the keys, and clutched them into her hand. Without wasting a moment, she sprinted out of the big top, running past the performers as they stared awestruck, ignoring them all. She ran past all the tents and the menagerie. She turned a corner, and rushed towards the solitary confinement wagon, almost out of breath. She saw Harriet looking out from her barred window, with a surprised look on her face. The girl halted as she panted, and gripped the keys harder. \"Sandy! What are you doing here?\" Mrs. Jumbo asked in shock. \"Getting you out of prison, of course,\" the girl said, placing the key into the lock and began to twist it around. \"What about my son? Is he all right?\" Sandy managed to unlock the lock, and opened the door, entering the prison and checked for injuries on Mrs. Jumbo's legs. She noticed that there were no scars and cuts on them, and she could sense that someone did this for her. \"More than all right,\" she said, kneeling down and placed the keys into the locks, managing to unlock them. \"He's a star now, and he's finally proven himself. It's time you deserved your freedom.\" \"Oh wonderful! Please get me out of here!\" \"Please be patient ma'am, I'll get you out in a jiffy.\" Soon enough the shackles were released around the thick legs. Harriet slowly walked out from her prison and stretched herself, relieving her stiff muscles from standing in a small space. She trumpeted happily to feel the fresh air blowing on her thick skin. \"I'm free, I'm finally free!\" she exclaimed. \"Where's my baby?\" \"Come on, he's in the big top and he's no longer being laughed at!\" the blonde said. Harriet knelt down to her knees until she was at the girl's height. Sandra climbed up until she sat up on her back. The elephant stood up and hurried towards the big top hearing the cheering crowd. Dumbo soon landed in the center of the ring, making a pose, and the crowd cheered wildly in a wondrous ovation as the calf took a bow. James and Robert managed to get Harold unstuck as he was soaked above his torso and shivered fiercely. \"Well, well, it looks like Uncle Harold is about to get hypothermia,\" James said, teasing the man. \"Now you won't tease Dumbo again?\" Robert added with a sly smile. \"On second thought…\" he sighed in frustration and let out a scream. \"I need a vacation!\" Many people, including children began to gather around the baby elephant no longer laughing at him, but were now praising him. The calf never felt this happy in his entire life. There was a loud trumpet call, and he turned towards the entrance to see his human friend sitting on top of a familiar elephant. It was his mother! He trumpeted in happiness and rushed towards his mother. \"Oh Dumbo, my sweet son!\" Harriet exclaimed. She wrapped her trunk around her son, and caressed him gently. Sandy smiled from above, happy to see Dumbo finally reunited with his mother. \"Hear this everyone,\" Sandra called and everyone turned their eyes to her. \"I always knew that we would all come clear on what happened in Atlanta, I defended this baby elephant who flew in front of all of you from a boy who harassed him and I tried to protect him, even Mrs. Jumbo. She wasn't acting wild, because it wasn't for no reason, just because she was not a 'Mad Elephant.' It was because she was a loving mother defending her son from bullies and ended up getting locked away. It was unfair, but I promised her to protect her son and be on his side, no matter what happens. After all that hard trials and mishaps and bullying we went through, my mother and brothers encouraged me to never give up, and accept who I truly am. I am a Wiccan, and I can understand animals. I am very proud of it, and no matter what anyone says that it's a curse, it's a choice I made to follow my heritage that's in my heart and blood! We should all accept for who we are on the inside. Dumbo's finally free and now his mother deserves it too.\" The whole crowd cheered for her speech, and she felt a wave of emotion to finally be accepted for who she was. She watched as the lady elephants and Ringmaster coming towards her, with regret in their eyes. Mrs. Jumbo's eyes darkened at the sight, keeping her face with a sharp glare. \"Mrs. Jumbo, I was wrong to punish you for what you did. I should've listened to my niece and understood her, but I was stubborn and strict. I had no excuse, I'm sorry,\" the ringmaster said, with regret and guilt in his voice. Mrs. Jumbo slowly smiled and reached her trunk out, taking his hand into her proboscis. Harold's eyes widened in surprise, thinking the mother elephant would snap at him again, but instead gently trumpeted to him. \"I think what she means to say is, that she forgives and accepts your apology,\" Sandy said. Harold gave a sigh of relief, knowing that things will get better. The lady elephants grew emotional at the apology between the girl, their friend, and the man. They all broke down in tears, and came up to them with their heads down. \"Oh Harriet, we're very sorry for the way we treated you and your son,\" the Matriarch said, her voice no longer filled with pride, but it was full of sadness and slowly looked up to the girl. \"We shouldn't have think negatively of you two, even the girl.\" \"Sandy dearie, we should've acted more kind to you,\" Prissy added, wiping tears from her eyes. \"I guess those gossips weren't worth it, even badmouthing you and Dumbo,\" Catty said. \"You are a very unique Wiccan.\" \"Can you ever forgive us?\" Giddy asked wailing. \"We promise to be nice to you in the future and we'll never ever tease you again. Honest!\" Sandy looked over to Mrs. Jumbo, and thought about it for a moment. Dumbo peered from behind his mother, and nodded towards them. \"Well, despite all of you being cruel to my son and Sandra, we'll accept your apology,\" Harriet said. \"Or else, I'll turn you all into frogs!\" Sandy added. \"What?\" the Matriarch cried \"Oh no!\" the other ladies cringed at the thought of being frogs and sobbed harder. Sandy threw back her head and laughed hard. \"Oh I'm just kidding! I can't turn you into frogs,\" she said grinning. \"I was only teasing you!\" The lady elephants soon stopped crying and their eyes widened at the joke. They all sighed in relief. \"Very funny,\" Catty said sarcastically, as a small smile curved from her lips. Mrs. Jumbo lowered herself down to allow Sandy to slid off her back and she threw her arms around Dumbo, and Timothy came up to her shoulder. Never feeling happier than ever. \"I'm so proud of you Dumbo, I always knew you were special, and the Goddess will bestow you with good luck,\" she said pulling him into the hug. \"You're like a little brother to me.\" \"Sandy…\" a childlike voice said from the calf. Sandy's eyes widened in shock, and she backed away in surprise. Timothy held onto her shoulder, as he regained his balance as his huge eyes widened. \"Dumbo? Did you just speak?\" Timothy asked. \"Sandy,\" the calf said again, with his voice more clearly. The blonde gasped in surprise, her eyes beaming with excitement and jumped up and down. \"On my gosh! He said his first word! He said my name! He said my name! He said my name! He said my name!\" she cried in excitement running around with her arms up in the air. Sandy's family backed away in surprise, never expecting to see her so excited. James and Robert smiled along with her. The ringmaster's eyes widened in surprise, but he smiled and chuckled. Dumbo smiled in joy and turned towards his mother, and held her trunk into his own. Allowing her to caress him tenderly, knowing that he will never be separated from her again, as long as they live. \"Mama,\" he said to her. \"Oh Dumbo,\" Harriet said, pulling him close, with her heart melting in joy. \"I love you so much! I'm so proud of you son, I'm sure your father would be proud of you too.\" Sandy stopped running around, and came towards her brothers as they threw her up in the air to hug her. She released herself from the hug and look towards her uncle. She slowly walked towards him, as his face was filled with emotion. \"Oh Sandy, you were right all along, I'm very sorry again for how I treated you. I hope you can forgive me. I came to understand that the only thing that matters and a great honor is to have you for a niece.\" She smiled as tears welled up in her eyes, and threw her arms around her uncle. He allowed himself to hug the girl, knowing that he truly loved her, and he was now showing it. \"Of course, I forgive you,\" she whispered. \"I love you, Uncle Harold.\" Hello everyone! Yes I'm back! I'm sorry this took me a long time to write this, I was running out of ideas and have to find a way to write this as a realistic, and having Mrs. Jumbo set free. I finally found the perfect time to write this! I'm starting to rewrite a few chapters, and get it more improvement. All is forgiven and we'll find out what happens in the next chapter. A big reveal will come up in the final chapter, because once you hear this, you'll be itching to read this![Chapter 20] Soon after Dumbo's flight was announced, he instantly became world famous. His name was written in many newspapers, with the titles, \"Wonder Elephant Soars to Fame!\" \"Ears Insured for $1,000,000,\" \"Dumbo Sets Altitude Record,\" and forming airplanes called \"Dumbobombers\" for the Allied Forces over in Europe. Best of all, Timothy becomes his manager by signing a Hollywood contract, and Sandy becomes his personal trainer and was accepted by the circus performers and the animals for her Wiccan heritage. As for the clowns, (except for Ben and a few who reformed) most of them quit while others got fired because they were now afraid of Dumbo and were all disgraced. Sandy and Dumbo forgave all of the others for treating them terribly, and were all finally accepted. The circus was renamed as Dumbo's Flying Circus in honor for Dumbo becoming a star attraction. Casey Jr. pulled the train, with a flower wreath wrapping around his face. He grinned in pride as lively music played from the calliope. (The Crows) I seen a peanut stand, heard a rubber band I seen a needle that winked its eye The lady elephants were leaning out from the window of their car and pointed their trunks towards him singing and smiling. They were all very happy for Dumbo. (Matriarch, Catty, Prissy, and Giddy) But I be done seen 'bout ev'rything When I see an elephant fly Mrs. Jumbo sat in the back of a new private silver train car where the Ringmaster replaced from his old red caboose, that way his star attraction and his mother would have an agreeable home. He also provided Sandy her own private car, that was in front of Dumbo's so she could visit them, which was shared for her brothers and the ringmaster, along with guests. Sandy stood by her brothers dressed in lighter clothes than her dark ones. She wore a buttoned down short-sleeved purple shirt, a green knee-length skirt, a white belt, green high heels, purple studded earrings and a beaded blue necklace, with a blue flower in her hair. James wore a sky blue shirt, a light green necktie, a blue vest with golden buttons, dark blue pants, and black boots. Robert wore a lime green shirt, a sky blue necktie, a dark green vest, white pants, and black boots.The siblings watched the mother elephant waving her handkerchief in the air. Dumbo was flying in the air wearing pilot's goggles, flapping his ears and the crows flew behind him singing. (The Crows) \" Oh my, When I see… When I see… When I see an elephant fly \"Mmm, look at him go!\" Jim said. Dumbo flew upwards into the air and allowed his ears to float downwards towards Mrs. Jumbo and she extended her long trunk out to him. The calf kissed his mother's forehead and wrapped his ears around her face; and she wrapped her legs and trunk around her son, caressing him lovingly. Timothy came up to his trunk and smiled for his best friend. \"I'm so proud of you buddy,\" he said. \"Thank you Timothy,\" Dumbo said. He looked up to his mother and smiled happily, whispering, \"I love you Mama.\" \"I love you too Dumbo, no matter what happens, we'll never be separated again,\" Harriet said, warmly. In the back, Sandy, James, and Robert all smiled at the moment between Dumbo and his mother. The blonde looked up at the sky and noticed her mother's spirit was floating in the air, smiling at her children proudly. The girl waved her handkerchief in the air, as tears of joy ran down her face and smiled back at her mother. Katherine floated upwards toward the shining rays of the sun, and was at rest. James and Robert looked up to see their mother smiling as her spirit disappeared. All of the siblings hugged each other and the holes in their hearts for their mother have healed, finding closure. The siblings looked back to watch Dumbo, Timothy and Mrs. Jumbo waving their handkerchiefs back to the crows. Jim, Fats, Specks, Straw Hat, and Deacon landed on top of an electric pole, and waved their hats and wings goodbye to the elephants, mouse, and humans. They continued to watch the train disappearing into the beautiful sunrise and sang the very last notes. (The Crows) \" When I see an elephant fly!\" \"Happy landin', son,\" Preacher said. \"Yippee!\" they all exclaimed. (The Crows) \" When I see an elephant fly!\" \"I wish I'd have got their autographs,\" Jim said disappointed. \"Oh, man, I got their autographs,\" Fats said, reassuring Jim. \"Well, so long, glamour boy and honey bun!\" Jim called out. \"Thank you guys!\" Timothy called back. \"So long!\" \"Thank you!\" Sandy cried. Sandy grinned never feeling so happier in her life, and know that she will always be there for Dumbo and Harriet, and became a member of their family. She even started to call Mrs. Jumbo 'mother,' since she was treated like a daughter. She knew that this would be the happy ending they all deserved, but the adventure gave her the idea that friendship, endurance, confidence, and support were the important morals to her and Dumbo, as they seek to find acceptance and earned it. All of this was a happy ending, but this however was a new beginning. The End! All right fellow readers and writers, here is the big reveal that will be announced right now. I'm going to write a sequel! Yes, a sequel to Dumbo! Now I may not be good at writing sequels but I have a plan and I'm going to try to base it off on the original cancelled sequel \"Dumbo II\" with a few changes and the idea from the . I will have the deleted characters; Penny the Ostrich, Dot the Curious Zebra, Claude and Lolly the bear cubs, and Godfy the independent hippopotamus, and the original main antagonist, the Animal Control Officer. However, he will be a secondary antagonist in my version with a much eviler antagonist, and new friends for Sandy and a possible love interest. Thanks to all who have read my Dumbo story and stayed tune for \"Dumbo II: A New York Adventure.\" Merry Christmas, Happy Holidays, and Happy New Year to everyone!

I noticed that there were little to NO fanfics for Drillbit Taylor (at least none that weren't slash). 2. It's a pretty good film in my opinion, and deserves more love. 3. AND after reading countless fanfictions myself, I thought I'd contribute. 3.2 ALSO, I'm not very good at writing 'lovey dovey' stories, though I'll admit I do like them. So after reading a few *cough*hundred*cough* romance fanfics I thought: 'Well shoot! I could do that and better!' Granted, my confidence slowly dwindled as I wrote the story, but I'm not a quitter! ('-')/ Please note that this story is already finished, I just have to post. Updates will be once a week, and will (eventually) differ between Maggie and Terry/Filkin's point of view. No, I'm not the best writer in the world, but hopefully it's competent. Enjoy ;) Disclaimer: I do not own Drillbit Taylor. Chapter 1: Arrival ~ The bus ride was long and bumpy as Maggie Lovelace waited to arrive at her new school. Her parents had moved across town. For what reason, she had no idea. All she knew was that they had moved to the suburbs, and now she had to attend a new school. It was a nice place, or so she had heard. Maggie stared out her window, observing a flock of birds fleeing a tree. ' At least we moved before the school year started, ' She thought to herself. Looking away from the birds, she turned her attention towards the road, watching as the yellow paint streaks flew by in a continuous line. As she stared mindlessly at the blurred pavement, she became lost in thought. Ha, mindless! In thought! ...Er, never mind. With nothing else to do, she thought about people (her parents in particular), her new house, her new school...her new everything, really, and compared her 'old' life with her 'new' one. As she weighed the various pros and cons of a new school, she came to the conclusion- Bump. Maggie was hurled a good 6 inches from her seat as the bus hit a rather deep crease in the road. Shouldn't buses have seatbelts? I mean, really, they're moving all these kids and their lives are in the driver's hands and there aren't really any seatbelts and if they got into a crash, then- Wait. She was getting off track. Where was she? Ah, yes. As she weighed the pros and cons of a new school, Maggie came to the conclusion that- Bump. Gosh, did this place have to have so many potholes?! Anyway, she came to the conclusion that- Bump. URGH! The conclusion that- Bump, bump. That MAYBE a new school wouldn't be so bad after all- BUMP. Maggie jerked in her place as some retard behind her gave her seat a good kick. Jerk. Now, where was she? Oh yeah. Never mind. She couldn't help but stand and stare at the two long flights of stairs leading up to Mckinley High. But it wasn't because she was in 'awe' of how awesome it was. It certainly didn't look new. In fact, it looked...kind of run-down. In her opinion. Her old school was better. Better looking, anyway. She couldn't say about the teachers or the cafeteria food. Yet. Finally done with critisizing the cosmetics of her new high school, Maggie climbed the steps, walked inside, and made her way to the Principal's office to get settled in. 'Well that was painless,' she thought to herself. Maggie maneuvered around the sea of, dare she say, 'eager' students as she made her way to her locker. The Principal had been pretty nice. Accomodating, even. Heck, he was probably a great guy. A little snobbish in his looks, buy hey, you can't have everything. Maggie paused, turning around to observe how far she had come, though with all the other students in the way it didn't make much difference. Principal Doppler had asked her if she needed help, but she had told him (rather confidently at the time) that she could find her locker on her own. Now she wasn't so sure. Just as she contemplated asking someone for help, the ocean of students parted like the Red Sea and gave her a clear view of her new locker. Finally! Moving closer, Maggie couldn't help but notice its color: Blue. Light blue. Light, happy, sky blue. The lockers at her old school were red. Faded, dark, rusty, depressing red. This was definitely an improvement. As she finished putting her things away, Maggie closed her locker and stared at it for a minute. Maybe it wouldn't be so bad. Maybe everything would be just fine. The students seemed nice, maybe she'd make a friend or two- Maggie grunted as she was pushed into her locker by a couple of students. Never mind. A/N: You can probably guess who the two 'students' are :P I wish I could say that this is my first story (well, it is on Fanfiction) but, it's not :/ It's actually my second, the first was for Naruto. Though I wrote it so long ago that it's pretty much a laughable piece of decroded crap, so I'm not even going to BOTHER posting that thing. Maggie, of course, is an OC, and if you're curious as to what she looks like, you can do this: art-gem. deviantart /art/Coloring-experimentation-363706546 Copy the above link, paste it into the address bar, and put '.com' right after the 'deviantart' part. Oh, and delete the spaces. This chapter is equal to one page in Microsoft Word, and it's pretty short, I'll admit. But it IS the shortest chapter in the ENTIRE STORY, so don't you worry about that, dear reader. I pride myself on proper spelling and I proofread this baby 3 times, so if you find any, ANY kind of typo, you let me know and I'll zap that thing :D Until next week :)[Chapter 2] A/N: in THIS chapter: Maggie meets Ronnie and Filkins, saves Emmit, gets stuck with a mysterious book bag, and issues a challenge. Disclaimer: do not own Drillbit Taylor. Chapter 2: Meeting~ When Maggie finally got her bearings, she turned around, ready to deck whoever shoved her. Her intentions were halted, however, when she took in the scene before her. Two men...well, guys- students -promptly shoved a small...child(?) into a locker. Was he a student? He seemed too young to be here. 'Maybe he has a medical condition or something' she thought to herself. The two 'students' continued pushing and shoving the young boy until he was completely inside of the locker, laughing and smiling all the while. Delinquents. \"Come on, guys, this isn't funny! Books go in here! I am NOT a book! \" Their unfortunate victim yelled. Sadly, the boy's cries for help went unheard by everyone save herself. Well, okay, they could hear. They stood in a small crowd observing the spectacle so she was sure they weren't deaf. They just didn't do anything about it. And that was so not cool. Bullying had always been a sensitive topic for Maggie. She hated it, and she simply couldn't stand by and let some punk with daddy-problems rough up some innocent bystander. At her old school, she would become friends with the victims and (when possible) deck the tormentors. Simple as that. This, however, was a special case, of which there had only been two in Maggie's life of 17 years. Once in the 9th grade and once on a playground at a park she couldn't remember the name to. This happened to be a special case because the situation almost surely ruled out her usual two options for things like this: friendship for the victims, and hurt for the tormentors. Friendship was most likely not an option because...well, just look at him! Maggie took one good look at the boy, who couldn't have been more than 12, and took in his appearance as best she could without the bullies getting in the way. He had on baggy blue jeans (faded, of course), a light blue button-up shirt (a bit too dressy), wore braces (yikes), and he had a shaggy bowl-cut hairdo (…). Oh, and a somewhat crooked nose. Not that appearances mattered to Maggie. Because they didn't. They really didn't. Not too much, anyway. It was his age, or lack of age, really, that made her realize that she (most likely) wouldn't be making friends with him. He was much too young. He didn't belong here. Heck, he probably got on the wrong bus or something. This was a High school, and from the looks of it, he hadn't even gone through puberty yet. And then, of course, there was option 2: going all-out on the bullies and beating them to a pulp. It wasn't that she was incapable, of course, because she totally was. She'd done it before. The one that appeared to be the leader of the two was fairly skinny, and although she could tell he had some definition in those spindly arms of his, she could easily knock him out with a good uppercut...or something. It was the other one, the minion, so to speak, that made Maggie keep her distance. He was, in a word, big. He wasn't fat or anything, he was just...big. He was at least 6'2\", and he had a beard coming in, making him look automatically older than any other kid in the entire school. Maybe even some of the teachers, who knows. But despite all these perfectly logical reasons not to engage in open combat on the first day of school, Maggie suddenly became aware of four very important facts: 1. This was going to be the craziest school year of her life. 2. The leader (let's call him Dave for now, she didn't like that name) was the one who pushed her. 3. Napoleon Dynamite was an awesome movie. And 4. She needed to help that kid. Just as she had made her decision, 'Dave' and (...Bob. He looks like a Bob) 'Bob' slammed the locker shut, locked it, and walked away laughing, leaving their victim crying - no, yelling. Crying was less dignified - behind them. The second they left, Maggie sprang into action. She sauntered over to his locker and stared up at him through the metal slits. \"Are you okay?\" She asked, brow furrowed in anger and worry. \"Oh, yeah. I'm fine. I just got stuffed into a locker on the first day of school, haha. No big deal.\" He laughed out nervously. She couldn't tell if he was joking or being sarcastic. \"Well, do you want help?\" She asked, trying to get across the point that she wasn't there to mock him. He stared at her for a couple of seconds before replying in a somewhat relieved tone, \"Oh, it'd be great if you could get me out of here!\" \"Okay,\" Maggie breathed, looking down at the lock. \"What's the combination?\" She asked, looking back up at him. \"It's 12-21-15! Hurry, just... get me out of here!\" He shrieked out frantically. Maggie put the numbers in and opened the door for him to get out. When he hopped down and dusted himself off, he only came up to her chest. And she was short. Standing at 5'4\", she was probably the shortest girl in the whole school. 'Well not anymore,' she thought happily. ... Oh, wait. He's not a girl. Never mind. \"I'm Emmit, by the way.\" He said nervously as he picked up his books. Emmit swallowed hard and his eyes darted in every possible direction, probably scanning for an oncoming attack. Jumpy kid. \"I'm Maggie,\" She replied with a small smile, though she didn't bother to hold out a hand for him to shake. \"Oh, I like your name!\" He smiled dorkishly, showing off his braces. \"Yours, too.\" She lied. ...Bully victims need support. A few seconds of awkward silence passed between them. Maggie thought about walking off to find her first class, but her curiosity got the better of her and she asked, \"How old are you?\" Emmit stared at her for a moment before answering in that skittish voice of his, \"Oh, I'm 14.\" What?14?! No way. He didn't look more than 12. At Maggie's failure to hide her dumbfounded expression he quickly added, \"I skipped a grade.\" Oh. That made sense. Another awkward silence. Emmit was the one to break it. \"Um, hey. Do you, maybe, wanna-\" \" Hey!\" Emmit looked past her, his face paling considerably. It didn't take a genius to figure out who he was looking at. Maggie sagged her shoulders and threw her head back, aggravated, and turned around. There they were, the two jerk-offs from not 5 minutes ago. And they were stalking towards her. Great. 'Dave' barged his way through the crowd, 'Bob' following close behind. He didn't have to do much pushing; most of the students moved out of the way as soon as they saw him coming. Apparently they were used to these two. Dave, shoving a random student to the side, paused for a moment to look at Maggie. Once he took in her defiant expression, his face almost immediately turned from irritated to angry. His brow furrowed, his lips pursed, and his eyes widened. It was almost comical, if not for the fact that he was totally fuming. Of course, personal space meant nothing to bullies. He was in her face in a second. \" What the hell do you think you're doing?\" Dave demanded, his face hovering angrily above hers. Maggie didn't miss a beat. \"Helping a fellow student.\" Maybe it was the way she said the sentence with such obvious simplicity, as if talking to a child, or maybe the way she coated her words with a bit too much fake sweetness, or maybe it was just her face, but Dave became even angrier. \"Well stop helping,\" He said curtly. Dave then glanced above her head, finding Emmit. He pointed a finger past Maggie at him. \"You,\" He said menacingly. Emmit jerked in response. Dave pointed at the locker. \"You get back in there.\" He ordered. Emmit didn't have to be told twice. He immediately clambered back inside his locker, fitting into it as best he could, and slammed the door. Dave turned his attention back to Maggie. \"And you,\" He said, now pointing at her. \" You, \" He began, poking her in the collarbone, \"can go back, \" - poke - \"to whatever hole you crawled out of,\" - poke - \"and just ,\" - poke - \"STAY there.\" This time he shoved her. Into the lockers. Into Emmit's locker. By the time Maggie recovered and she opened her eyes, Dave was in her face again. He had lowered himself to eye level with her, and had also been kind to rest his arm on the locker to her right, blocking her escape route. How lovely. She started to turn her face away in defiance, but stopped when her face nearly collided with Bob's. Apparently he was denied attention as a child, because he was so close his whole face took up her vision. She couldn't even focus her eyes on him, he was so close. But two things were obvious: He enjoyed irritating people. And his breath was awful. It smelled like he had eaten tomato soup with onions, then decided on decaying teeth for dessert afterward. Needless to say, Maggie turned her head back to Dave. \"And the next time you decide to,\" Dave held up his hand and air-quoted, \"'help',\" he feigned a concerned expression, \"just remember: I'm in charge here. And what I want,\" he paused for effect, \"I get. And if I wanna shove the World's Smartest Midget into a locker,\" he leaned closer, his face getting blurrier and blurrier, \"I will.\" He breathed out the last word, fanning peppermint all over her face. A welcome change, compared to Bob. Apparently satisfied with their 'reasoning', Dave pushed off the locker, lightly hitting Bob's arm with the back of his wrist. \"C'mon, Ronnie, let's go.\" And with that, they were gone. It was then that she noticed how much attention they had attracted. The students, now bored with the lack of action, gradually resumed their previous tasks. \"Well that was scary,\" said Emmit, who had been watching the entire time through the slits in the locker. Maggie, ignoring the fact that she had just made a spectacle of herself on the first day of school, rolled her eyes, pushed off his locker, and opened it up. Emmit hopped out and dusted himself off. Again. Maggie picked up his books – at least she assumed they were his books – and handed them to him. \"Are you gonna be okay?\" She asked. He looked up. \"Oh, yeah. I'll be fine.\" He replied, already cheerful now that Bob and Dave were gone. Well, Ronnie and Dave. \"I would've hit him for you, but, that'll have to wait another day.\" She said it jokingly, but Emmit could tell by the dim fire in her eyes that she was completely serious. He laughed anyway, though, catching on to the fact that she was obviously trying to lighten the mood. \"Thanks, let me know when you do.\" \"Alright.\" She agreed. Maggie began walking away, but turned around to ask: \"Are you sure you're gonna be okay?\" Emmit smiled. \"Yeah!\" He shrieked out. Clearly embarrassed, he tugged at his collar, clearing his throat. \"I mean, um...yeah.\" Sated but not satisfied, Maggie simply answered with a disbelieving \"Okay.\" And with that, she turned around and resumed walking to her first class. When she was a little more than halfway down the hall, she looked back once more. Emmit was still standing there, but he was talking to someone. Two someones. A skinny kid with glasses and curly hair, and a – erm – ' chubby ' short kid with a bit of an afro, though you could tell it was just really curly. ' They're both wearing the same shirt,' She thought absent mindedly. She could only imagine how humiliated they were, especially with it being the first day of school and all. Emmit was sure to be mocked if he started hanging out with those two. 'Well at least he's making friends,' Her conscience countered. As Maggie turned to leave, she bumped into a fellow student - a female student, to be exact - though at the time all she really saw was a mess of blonde and black. As she picked up her books, Maggie couldn't help but notice this girl's appearance. She had straight blonde hair with the tips dyed black that came down far past her shoulders, and her left – well, her left, Maggie's right – eye was covered with black emo bangs. She had pale skin, an oval face and a long, thin nose. Unlike Maggie, she wore makeup, but not obsessively so. And her clothes. They were so...odd. She was wearing a loose oversized black t-shirt with wolf's eyes printed on the front, and a purple-and-black plaid pleated skirt with a chain hanging off it. They weren't too odd, she supposed, but her tights were the real eye-stopper. They were...she didn't even know. They were just a mesh of bright neon yellows and reds and purples and blues and...were those bunnies? Anyway, the tights combined with the black combat boots she wore made her look quite odd. But oh, well. Who was she to judge? Noticing the girl's obvious self-consciousness, Maggie quickly averted her eyes, trying her hardest not to ogle and keep her attention on her books (which had fallen to the floor). It was tough, but she was successful. As they both finished picking up their things, the young girl abruptly walked off. Weird. Maggie noticed the girl's book bag on the floor. She must have forgotten it. Looking up to call for her, Maggie realized she was nowhere to be found. Sighing, she bent down and picked it up, searching for a name tag. Alexandria. Hm. Taking one last look around her and, finding no Alexandria, Maggie slung the bag around her shoulder, letting her own drag on the floor from her fingertips, and started towards class. Maggie walked into History class feeling pretty confident. That is, until she saw the students. Two in particular. Sitting four seats away from where she stood by the teacher's desk, behind the ONLY empty seat (apparently she was the last one to make it to class, how convenient) was Dave. And next to him (of course) was Ronnie, but only Dave paid any attention to her. Mr. Dunbar asked her to introduce herself, and she did as she was told, though she was none too enthusiastic about sitting with her back turned to Dave for an hour- \"Mr. Filkins, would you please help Ms. Lovelace into her seat?\" Mr. Dunbar asked. -Sitting next to Filkins for an hour. This was not happening. She could not let this go down. Turning to Mr. Dunbar, she asked in a sweetly innocent voice, \"Um, actually, I was wondering if I could sit next to,\" she briefly scanned the seats, finding her little friend from not 15 minutes ago. \"Emmit?\" Mr. Dunbar glanced over at the boy in question, and Maggie waited with bated breath as he replied, \"I'm terribly sorry, Ms. Lovelace, but the seats are assigned. Sorry, but you'll have to sit by Mr. Filkins.\" He gave her a sympathetic look, but that was about it. Great. There was no getting around this. Sighing silently in defeat, Maggie trudged down the first aisle of seats, stopping next to hers. It was the third from the back, and third from the front. In the middle. Yay. Filkins had already gotten up and pulled out her chair for her, an innocent 'nice-guy' expression on his face, smile and all. A look which was obviously reserved for teachers and grown-ups. So he was one of those. He gestured for her to sit down, and she was so irritated at this point that she didn't bother holding back the eye roll she felt coming on. She set down her bags (judging from all of the odd looks she received they probably thought she stole the extra one) and sat down. She spared herself no dignity as she twisted around in her seat to stare back at Filkins, who was smiling innocently at her. Maggie's eyes narrowed to slits, sending him the clear message that she would be on her guard. Filkins, however, squinted his eyes as well, changing his angelic smile to a devilish smirk. Maggie sent him one final death glare before turning back around in her seat. Mr. Dunbar had already started his lesson. Something about the Civil War. While trying to focus on the teacher, Maggie thought about what had just occurred. A challenge had been issued. Though no words had been spoken, it was a mutually silent agreement, she was sure. And she was so going to win - Tug. Maggie's head jerked back as she felt a firm tug on one of her long, brown, wavy strands of hair. ...Never mind. A/N: Oh-KAY, SO! Not really much to say about this chapter, except that I feel like I use italics too much :/ I was gonna wait until tomorrow to update, but I was bored and couldn't wait :P And yes, just to be clear, those two 'kids' that Emmit was talking to? Yeah, they were Ryan and Wade, from the movie. They'll make numerous cameos throughout the story, so keep an eye out. ...Or not. I don't care. Whichever you prefer. Oh, and just in case there was any confusion (though I doubt it), 'Bob' was Maggie's temporary nickname for Ronnie and 'Dave' was for Filkins. As I said before, I'm not the best writer, it's really just a hobby to pass the time. I'm good at spelling and grammar (I know the differences between there, their, and they're and all that jazz) and basic structure, but not much else. SO, if you have any pointers for me, fire away. Also, I've decided to update twice a week now, because I was looking back at all the chapters I wrote and it would be horrendously slow if I were only to update once every week :/ So yeah, I'm gonna update twice a week now. 'Till next time ;)[Chapter 3] A/N: In THIS chapter: Maggie detects a pattern, Terry finds out where she lives, we meet Maggie's parents, and sit through an awkward dinner. Disclaimer: do not own Drillbit Taylor. Chapter 3: Target ~ After about a week of bullying from Filkins, Maggie began to notice a pattern. In History class he pulled her hair, in English he would try his best to trip her on her way to her seat without being noticed by Ms. Zachey, in Science he would constantly kick the leg of her chair, which ultimately led to her trying to write as much as she could within the 1.5 seconds it took him to swing his legs back and forth. How he got this past any of the teachers she didn't know. And then there was Math. Luckily for her, nothing bad really happened to Maggie during Math. During being the key word. It was what happened after that that had her dreading the end of class. See, Filkins chewed gum during Math class. So, when everyone was done with their work and heading out the door, he would always – always – manage to stick gum somewhere on her person. Sometimes she'd find it on an arm, sometimes inside her hoodie. Once she found some insider her back pocket. She'd never know how he pulled that one off. But this time, however, he'd put it in the one place no decent girl wants to be messed with. He'd stuck it in her hair. Needless to say, she always checked herself when she got out of class. Which, of course, leads us to where Maggie is now, which is in her kitchen. Sitting on a stool. Waiting, thinking, as her mom cut her hair. 'Stupid Filkins,' She thought bitterly. At least her mom knew what she was doing. She was going to be a hairstylist or something, but she dropped out when she met Maggie's dad. Her dad was a dentist, so her mother was a stay-at-home mom. That is, up until recently. Her mother Claire didn't have a job or anything, but she was definitely out of the house more often. Whether it was shopping, out with friends, or going to bingo (older women went to bingo, right?), Maggie's mother was hardly ever home when she got back from school. Luckily for her, this was not one of those cases. \"Okaaay,\" Claire sang enthusiastically. \"All done!\" Maggie got up from her seat and strode out of the kitchen, through the dining room, around the stairwell and into the bathroom. As she looked herself over in the mirror, she couldn't help but notice how much shorter her hair was from behind, at least compared to the front. Her hair, which was normally wavy, now had tighter curls in the back. But she didn't mind. She had asked her mom to leave the front alone, after all. Besides, now that it was shorter, maybe Filkins would be forced to stop yanking her hair out in History class…okay, well he didn't yank it out, but it was still annoying as heck. Still, he'd have no one to blame but himself. 'Done in by his own stupidity,' She thought triumphantly. As she finished observing her mom's handiwork, Maggie strolled out of the bathroom, and, taking a left around the corner (she had to remember these things as it was still a new house), into the living room. It was Friday, and Maggie planned to spend her weekend Filkins-free. She had recently discovered he lived about six houses up from them. Or maybe it was down. Whatever. She had never actually seen him, but she recognized the black Mustang in the driveway and, more importantly, the license plate number. Hey, you can't be too careful. Ding-dong. Maggie rolled her eyes at their cliché doorbell. She thought about getting up to greet her dad (he usually got home by now) but decided on lying down, snuggling deeper into the couch, and switching over to the cartoons. She heard the door open, heard her mother's formal greeting, and – hey! That wasn't her dad's voice! Maggie listened intently to the conversation going on not 10 feet from where she sat. Rested. Lay... never mind. \"So you're a friend of Maggie's?\" She heard her mother ask. That's funny, because last she recalled, she didn't have any friends. Maggie's head shot up from behind the couch so she could get a better look. Filkins. \"Uh yeah, we met on the first day of school and just kinda hit it off.\" Hit was right! Filkins had on his usual 'innocent' persona he wore when he was around grown-ups: soft eyes, boyish smile, slightly raised eyebrows, and (here's the kicker) dimples. Utterly disgusting. Filkins caught Maggie staring and, grinning slightly for effect, gave her a small wave. \"Hi, Maggie.\" Why that son of a – \"We're going to be having dinner here in about 30 minutes, so why don't you stay?\" Her 'mother' suggested. No. \"Well that would be wonderful, Mrs. Lovelace!\" No no no no no no no. \"Aww, you're welcome!\" She could only watch in disgust as her mother, the woman that gave birth , love and LIFE to her, hugged the Devil's Spawn. She couldn't help it. Her jaw dropped open. And Filkins, still hugging her mom, stared right back at her, grinning like the he-devil he was. Dinner. She was going to be having dinner with this…this… tyrant! Filkins-free weekend. Ha. Maggie silently seethed as she calmly flipped through the channels on their High Definition Television. After her mom invited Filkins into the house – let him taint these oh-so-sacred walls – he wasted no time in sitting next to her on the couch. Her couch. NOT his…ugh, never mind. It was fine, after the first 30 seconds (a record for him). They sat in silence next to each other, both pretending to watch the t.v. screen as Claire prepared supper. Yes, for those glorious 30 seconds, everything was fine. Until he touched her. Apparently the flubber thought it was perfectly fine to suddenly just rest his hand on her knee. Like it was the most normal thing in the world. Yeah, right. At first, Maggie retaliated by simply grabbing his hand – as hard as she could, mind you – and shoving it back towards him. She could think of another place she'd like to shove it, of course, but that wasn't a possibility with her mom around. But Filkins, as expected, didn't give up after a single failure, so of course he moved his hand right back where it was. Maggie, however, didn't give up so easily either, so of course she shoved him away. And…of course, he moved it back. And she shoved him away. And he moved it back. And she shoved away…and he moved back…and she – you know what? Screw this. Grumbling under her breath, Maggie shoved him away one final time before moving clear across the couch and, more importantly, away from him. She held a death-grip on the remote as she switched to cartoons, making sure to find a show she just knew he would hate. If he had to be here, she sure as heck wasn't gonna make him comfortable! Her quiet victory was cut short as Filkins, hands now in the pockets of his jacket, quickly but casually slid one leg, then his entire body across the length of the couch until they were practically hip-to-hip. 'Great,' she thought. 'Just great.' He even rested an arm around the back of the couch for good measure, no doubt successfully creating the illusion that they were 'good buddies'. Suck-up. \"Maggie! Terry! Dinner time!\" Her mother called. Maggie waited for Filkins to get up first, which took a good 10-15 seconds. She was SO not going to turn her back on him. As she followed him across the stairwell and into the dining room, Maggie realized that she finally knew his first name. Terry. Huh. To say dinner was awkward was an understatement. Maggie's father had called to say he was stuck in traffic and to eat without him. Which, of course, led to the awkward silence she was in now. She sat, fortunately, across from 'Terry', rather than next to him like she expected her mother to suggest. Unfortunately , however, she was sitting next to her mother, who was no doubt planning to chew her ear off for being so 'rude' with him. Whatever. Thankfully, her mother ended the silence. \"Terry, would you like to say grace?\" Maggie's mouth nearly fell to the floor. Thankfully, she had more control than that. Grace? GRACE?! She always said Grace, there was no way in Hell that HE was going to say Grace! Oh, wait…never mind. Terry, of course, with that faux-genuine smile on his faux-genuine face, replied in his faux-genuine voice: \"Why, of course, Mrs. Lovelace.\" And he bowed his head, along with Maggie's mom, who nudged her when she didn't do anything due to the utter shock of being cast aside for this douche bag. She finally bowed her head, pausing when she saw 'Terry's' hand extended out to her. She glanced over to see that her mother had already taken his other hand. Not only was he going to say Grace, he was going to initiate a Prayer Circle too?! That conniving little – \"Maggie.\" Her thoughts were interrupted by Claire's voice, her tone clearly irritated that she was holding them up. Maggie hesitantly took the hand that was offered to her, and since her eyes were the only ones still open, she was the only one who caught the triumphant smirk that adorned Terry's face as he squeezed her hand firmly, almost painfully. Buttwipe. Finally, they commenced. \"Dear Lord,\" He began, \"we would like to thank you for this,\" – he paused for effect – \" wonderful feast,\" – Maggie rolled her eyes beneath her lids – \"that Maggie's wonderful mother prepared for us.\" Her mom 'awwed' and blushed in that bashful way of hers. Maggie's eyes may have been closed, but she could totally see her mom wearing that 'oh, stop it' expression. It made her sick. Terry continued with Grace. \"But most of all, dear Lord, we'd like to thank you for Maggie.\" Say what? \"For her kindness\" – okay – \"tolerance,\" – damn straight – \"durability,\" – pfft. Wouldn't he know – \"strength,\" – Hell to the yes! – \"and love,\" – something he had obviously never experienced, she was sure…wait, where was this going? – \"But most of all, for her endurance.\" - … - \"For her astounding ability to take hit,\" – she knew it! – \"after hit,\" – okay, that's quite enough – \"after hit ,\" – NOW he was pushing it – \"and get knocked down,\" – she clenched his hand as a warning – \"and get right back up,\" – that's better – \"even though she knows she's just going to get knocked right back down again.\" – Operation: Death Grip underway – \"And so we thank you, dear Lord, for all of Maggie's amazing qualities.\" This had better be the end of it. \"In God's name we pray.\" Ugh, YES. \"Amen.\" \"Amen,\" she and her mother uttered. \"That was beautiful, Terry.\" WHAT?! Surely she would've seen through that! \"You must know Maggie very well!\" She winked flirtatiously. Maggie was going to puke. She was going to puke and she hadn't even eaten yet. 'Very well'?! He didn't know anything about her! She wasn't anything like that! …ESPECIALLY not that last part! URGH… …Well…okay…maybe a little…a lot…alright, he had her right down to the feakin' T …er, never mind…but he still didn't know her! \"Thank you, Mrs. Lovelace.\" Terry replied, smiling. \"Oh, call me Claire!\" Her mother said, nose crinkling as she smiled back. A very long, awkward silence followed. Maggie stared at Terry, ready to jump into action the second he tried something. Terry stared back, hands fisted together under his chin, no doubt plotting some evil scheme. And her mother, mirroring Terry's pose, stared at the table. \"…Oh- kay…\" Claire said a bit awkwardly. \"Let's eat.\" The rest of dinner went fairly smooth. Terry kept his hands and feet on his side of the table, her mom didn't verbally berate her, and Maggie spent most of her mealtime stabbing at her mashed potatoes and pretending it was Filkin's stupid face. The only hard part about supper was having to sit through overhearing her mom asking question after question after question about Terry. Even worse, having to hear him answer. \"So, how are you?\" \"I'm doing okay.\" \"Do I know your parents?\" \"No, they're off on a business trip to China.\" \" China? Wow…well, I'm sure they're wonderful people.\" \"They are.\" \"Mhm, so do you have a lot of classes with Maggie?\" \"Yep, all subjects.\" \"Wow, you must be pretty smart, then, huh?\" \"I try, haha.\" \"You know, Maggie was just below the valedictorian at her old school.\" \"Is that so?\" \"Mhm! She was in Honor's classes and everything! Never could get a boyfriend, though…\" And this is the part where Maggie puts her foot down. \" Mom! \" She all but whined. \"Well, it's true!\" Claire countered. \"You know, Maggie's never really had a problem with acne or weight, so I never really understood why she never brought a boy home.\" She said to Terry, pointing her fork at him. Oh, he was loving this. She just knew it. Maggie sunk in her seat in shame. She wished dad would get here… \"Reeeaaallly?\" Terry asked, shifting his gaze from Claire to her. \"I never would've guessed.\" He finished in a tone that was meant to be surprised, but came to Maggie's ears in a way that clearly translated to: Loser. \"Yep.\" Said her mother, lacing her fingers together and staring at Maggie lovingly. Aaaaand cue the awkward silence. … … … \"Oh-KAY!\" Claire clapped her hands together, and both Maggie and Terry jumped slightly. \"Who's ready for dessert?\" Maggie helped her mother clear the table, making multiple trips to and from the kitchen. Terry offered to help but Claire had blown it off and said, 'Oh, you don't have to worry about it!' Pssh. Finishing her last trip to the kitchen, Maggie waited by the sink for her mother. When she came trotting into the room, she immediately asked: \"So, what's for dessert?\" \"We,\" Claire paused to start the dishwasher, \"are having,\" she sauntered over to the counter space behind Maggie, placing a hand atop the cover of a cake platter, \" this!\" She dramatically pulled off the cover to reveal a strawberry shortcake, but a fancy one, not the lame kind you make real quick when you need something fast for guests that are coming over soon. She had to say, it looked…pretty nice. \"Now,\" Her mother began, slicing off 3 pieces for Maggie, Terry, and herself, \"Take these in there. But remember, Terry's our guest so he gets the first piece.\" As she finished putting the last piece onto an empty plate, her mother gasped. \"Oh! I completely forgot. Hold on, I need to ask Terry something.\" And she all but ran out of the room. Now was her chance. Taking a quick glance at the doorway to see if her mother was coming back, Maggie grabbed a pair of scissors lying on the counter and held out a few single strands of hair. She then proceeded to cut her hair, slicing it off into tiny pieces, making sure to let it sprinkle onto Terry's slice of cake. It was actually a salon technique called 'dusting'. Her mother taught it to her, of course. The point was to cut off split ends without losing any hair length. When you were done cutting, it would look like a small pile of dust on the floor, or, in this case, strawberry seeds. ' There, almost done.' She thought. ' Just one final touch…' Glancing once again at the doorway, Maggie leaned over Terry's slice of cake, waited for her saliva glands to speed up, and let her spit drizzle onto the strawberry icing. It was transparent icing, like the jelly inside toaster strudels. He wouldn't notice. When she was done, she grabbed a spoon from the nearby utensil drawer and used the back of it to spread it around. She then licked the spoon clean – hey, it was her spit – and tossed it into the sink. It was then that Claire walked back in, laughing over something Terry had said. \"Okay, he's not allergic to strawberries!\" Like that was the most important piece of information in the entire universe. \"Okay, honey, I'll take these in.\" Whoops. Time to intervene. \"No, mom,\" Maggie said, taking Terry's and her plates from her hands. \"I'll do it.\" Apparently she had said it a bit too enthusiastically, because her mother eyed her suspiciously before letting her go ahead of her. When she walked back out into the dining room, Terry was leaning back in his chair, hands resting on the table, his innocent mask in place, looking expectantly at her. She should've guessed he'd stay for dessert. Mooching food-grubber. As Maggie set his plate down in front of him, she made sure to hide the smirk that was begging to come to her face. Instead, she frowned, furrowed her brows together, and glared at him. She couldn't have him thinking she sabotaged his food now, could she? And besides, he was obviously getting a kick out of her playing 'waitress'. He wouldn't suspect a thing. ' Let them eat cake,' She thought smugly. Once the silverware was in place, Maggie and her mother sat back down. \"Okay, everybody,\" Claire announced, \"Dig in!\" And so they ate. For a while there was no conversation, just the sounds of eating and munching and forks hitting plates. Of course, with Terry that didn't last long. \"This cake is really good, Claire.\" Maggie couldn't help but smile ruefully as she bit into her piece. Luckily, it went unnoticed. \"Thank you, Terry! I found a recipe in my family's cookbook.\" Came her reply. \"I don't think it's sweet enough, though.\" She added. Yeah, she'd have to agree there. It was good, but kinda bland. \"No, I think it's perfect.\" Terry said, taking another bite. \"I think it's really sweet.\" He swallowed. \"And flavorful.\" Yeeeaaah, she'd eaten a few Jolly Ranchers before dinner. \"Oh. Well thanks, Terry, I'm glad you like it.\" Her mother said. ' So am I…' Maggie thought evilly. When Terry (finally) decided to leave, Maggie was elated. SO elated, in fact, that she held the door for him to leave. \"You could stay longer if you want.\" Her mother offered. \"No, I'm afraid I can't, Mrs. Lovelace. I gotta get back.\" Wow. He wasn't putting up a fight or anything. Just as he was walking out the door, Terry turned around and held his arms out. \"Bye, Maggie.\" He said in an irritatingly sweet voice. In Maggie's opinion, forcing someone to hug their sworn enemy was one of the worst things you could do to a person. And it was happening to her. \"Maggiiiieee,\" Her mother urged in a sing-song voice through clenched teeth. Hesitantly, ever so hesitantly, Maggie stepped forward. When Terry motioned with his arms, blatantly refusing to meet her half-way, she took another step forward, and another and another, until she was standing awkwardly between his arms. She took one last breath before her oxygen supply was depleted as his arms clamped down around her stout frame. She half-expected him to whisper something threatening in her ear, but he didn't, which surprised her. No, he just hugged her extremely tight, and let go. Maybe it was because her mom was around. He waved goodbye to her and her mom, and, finally, left. \"Well, he was nice.\" Her mother commented. \" No. He i sn't,\" Maggie corrected under her breath. Unfortunately for her, her mother had heard her. The thing about Claire was that she seemed to have superhuman hearing. Even if you were whispering clear across the room she could somehow still hear you. \"What do you mean?\" Her mother inquired, walking into the kitchen to clean off their plates. Maggie followed her through the dining room, and as her mom began to wash the dishes, Maggie told her about everything he had done, both to herself and to other kids, like Emmit. As she finished ranting, her mother just stood there, shell-shocked, holding a plate while she dried it off. Her expression suddenly went from shocked to stone-cold. And then she forcefully dropped the plate she was holding, letting it shatter to the floor. It wasn't uncommon for Maggie's mom to break things, at least not when she was upset. Whenever she was angry, Claire would break whatever happened to be in her hands, which was usually a dish of some sort. And after she broke something she would always go on a rant. So of course, Maggie knew what was coming now. \"Perfect,\" Her mother began angrily. \"I just let a delinquent into my house. And you know he'll come back. What if he comes back when we're not home? He could rob us! And you know that piece of cake wouldn't have gone to waste! And did you say it was HIM that put that gum in your hair? I'll go over there right now and kick his –\" \"Hi, honey! I'm hooome!\" Aaaand that would be her dad. He was funny like that, showing up at the best of times. \"Honey?\" Robert called. Maggie and her mother waited for him to find his way into the kitchen. \"Oh, hey. There you are.\" He walked up to ruffle his daughter's hair and kiss his fuming wife. Eventually he started to get the feeling that there was something wrong. \"Aaaarre you guys okay?\" He asked. Maggie looked at the floor and her mother sighed. No, everything was not 'okay'. \"Oh hey; cake!\" After her dad got home, Maggie trudged upstairs to her room and plopped down on the bed. She didn't bother shutting the door; she knew at least one of her parents would be up to talk to her soon about 'Terry'. It was kind of ironic, really. At her old school, she was always the one to defend those that were being bullied; and now she was being bullied herself. Haha. Ha. Ha. Maggie glanced to her left, where she had tossed Alexandria's bag in the corner. She still hadn't been able to find that girl...Was she avoiding her or something? Was she sick? Did she move? Did she get hit by a car? Did she just not care about it? Did she- Okay, that's enough of that, Maggie stopped herself. She'd look – no, she'd FIND – her Monday. As she lay on her back staring at the ceiling, Maggie's mind naturally wandered to other things. Things like food, and…t.v. And school. And…urgh… Terry. As she recapped the evening's events, Maggie was amazed to find that he didn't really do anything 'wrong' per se…Except the hand thing, but that wasn't really 'hurting' anything, just annoying. As she went through all of the possible reasons he hadn't tried anything, her mother walked in. \"Hey.\" She greeted, sitting down on the bed. \"Hey,\" Maggie sighed, not looking away from the ceiling. \"…Look,\" her mother started. \"I know I probably don't have to tell you this, but I'm gonna tell ya anyway .\" She took a deep breath. \"NOW, I know that kid's a total bully, but I'm sure you two have SOME things in common.\" She paused, letting Maggie take it in. What? She wanted her to try and be 'friends' with that jerk? Her mother continued. \"And I'm sure you could find some common ground with each other.\" She suggested. Maggie turned her head to give her mother a look that said 'are you serious?' \"Now, now, hear me out,\" Claire put her hands up. \"You should try to be friends with him. Try, that's all I'm saying. And when you gain his trust-\" \"Mom, I don't think you-\" \" When you gain his trust,\" Her mother continued, \"Crush. Him.\" Maggie stared at her in disbelief. She needed confirmation on this. \"Are you serious? \" Her mother leaned back, nodding her head. \" Hayl tuh dah yay-us!\" She exclaimed, earning a laugh from Maggie. \"He took my food! I spent 3 hours putting all that together; we coulda had leftovers!\" She paused to laugh herself, \"And plus, with all that crap he did to you? Of COURSE we expect you to get that little bastard!\" Maggie was surprised. \"Soooo you talked this over with dad?\" \"Yep.\" Her mother replied, putting her hands on her hips and holding her head high, smirking triumphantly. \"And we both agreed…that you should kick his ass.\" They both chuckled. \"Hey, if you don't, I will.\" Claire warned playfully. \"Besides, I asked him his age, and he's 18. Isn't that great? Even if you did get into a fight he'd be the one in trouble because you're a minor. So, ha!\" He was 18? Wow, he must've failed a grade…but then, how was he in all her classes…? Probably born late into the year, her mind reasoned. Maggie sat up, swinging her legs over the top of the bed to face her mother. \"Uh…thanks, mom. That…actually really helps.\" She smiled. Her mother scrunched her face up playfully. \"You go, baby.\" And with those final words, she went downstairs. Maggie chuckled again. It always cracked her up when her mom cussed. Whether it was because it sounded so right or it sounded so wrong , she wasn't sure. Her parents always did the exact opposite of what 'normal' parents would do, and God knew she was glad to have them…or rather, she was glad they had her …or whatever. As she fell back down onto her bed, Maggie contemplated what her mother had told her. Be friends with him? Nah, it was too late for that. Beat 'em up? Sure, but she hadn't told her mom about Terry's 6'2\" friend 'Ronnie'. But then again, he hadn't tried anything today, so maybe being friends wasn't so far-fetched. Maybe it would happen. Heck, maybe they could be great friends. Maybe – Maggie's expression turned from thoughtful to disgusted as she pulled out a piece of gum from the back of her head. Never mind. A/N: Yep, Terry's a jerk. But don't worry, Maggie'll eventually win him over...or something like that. I'm starting to realize why so many writers on here never finish their stories, all this typing is tough! This chapter alone ended up being 11 pages long D: But don't worry, I WILL finish this, and unlike most people that say it, I MEAN it :D Oh, and when Claire broke the dish? Yeah, I got that from watching Twilight :P I wasn't originally going to have Terry come over on Maggie's weekend off, because that's so cliché, but then I got the funny idea of him saying Grace. Plus, this whole story's pretty much cliché, so what's one more notch in the stick? Oh, and in case you couldn't understand ' Hayl tuh dah yay-us', it roughly translates to: Hell to the yes. Yes? XD I know Maggie's mom is a little weird, but I just didn't want her to be like all the other 'stereotypical' moms. I still don't really like how her character turned out though :/ Now, I'm not really a fan of cussing, but to stay true to the movie's universe, it's gonna be in there, especially when we get to Filkin's POV. Just saying :P ' Till next time.[Chapter 4] A/N: in THIS chapter: Maggie's weekend goes great, she finally manages to track down the mysterious 'Alexandria', and Maggie gets a special 'assignment' from principal Doppler. Disclaimer: Do not own Drillbit Taylor. Chapter 4: Assigned ~ The rest of Maggie's weekend went great. She half-expected Filkins to show up Saturday and Sunday, but apparently he had better things to do. 'Good for him,' she thought snootily…wait, was that even a word? Never mind. Today was Monday (obviously) and Maggie was determined to track down the elusive 'Alexandria'. She searched the halls as she walked to History class, but just like the last 5 days of school, she found nothing…well, she found a penny, but that wasn't important. Deciding to wait until lunch (she'd have to come across her there, if nowhere else), Maggie walked into Mr. Dunbar's class. Terry was there, of course, rolling a pencil between his lips, looking pretty bored. She nearly laughed when his face immediately brightened the second she walked in the door. It was like watching a human light bulb. Maggie mentally mocked him for his apparent boredom as she made her way to her seat. Oh, no, I don't have anyone to mess with! When she sat down, she noticed something was amiss. Where was Ronnie? \"Okay, class, today we're going to talk about Custer's Last Stand,\" Mr. Dunbar began. Maggie had already learned about this at her old school, but listened anyway. At least, she tried to, but with Mr. Dunbar's poor presentation, she quickly lost interest. …Hey. She just realized something. Terry wasn't pulling her hair. It must have been too short for him to reach. Sweet. Maggie fancifully imagined him trying to make a grab for her hair, only to emerge unsuccessful due to his own doings. As she began losing herself in LaLa Land, she was (unfortunately) brought back to reality by the Devil Himself. \"Hey,\" he whispered, leaning over his desk to reach her. \"Here's your pencil back.\" He reached over her shoulder to place the offending object on her desk. Confused, Maggie looked it over. Yep. It was her pencil, alright. And it had teeth marks in it. And it was wet. And she didn't have a spare. Smirking subtly, Filkins leaned back in his chair. Maggie stared at it for a second before hesitantly picking it up, rolling it in the folds of her jacket to dry it off. She couldn't wait until lunch. Despite the ever-present feeling that time had slowed down, lunch finally came. As Maggie moved along the lunch line, she spotted Emmit 3 spaces down. He was rambling happily about who-knows-what as he placed a pudding on his tray, apparently talking to those two kids from before. She had learned their names were Wade and Ryan, but that Ryan liked to be called 'T-dog'. She idly wondered where he got that from. It sounded cool, but not original. Hmm… Maggie grabbed a chocolate pudding, paid for her food, and turned to find a seat. It was nice out, maybe she would eat outside. Just then, she spotted Alexandria. YES! FINALLY! She watched as the tall blonde quickly walked out of the cafeteria. Okay, that's it. She was eating outside. As she began walking in Alexandria's general direction, Maggie stopped when she saw Ronnie. She watched as he practically stalked out into the sunlight, obviously following the poor girl. Was that why he wasn't in class? Was he bullying Alexandria? Maggie quickened her pace, trying to keep her food from tipping over in the process. It didn't take her long to find them. I mean, come on, how many giants hung out with blonde emos? Maggie observed them from afar. From the looks of things, they were just talking, but it must've been a touchy subject, judging from the way Alexandria was leaning away from him with an expression that made it seem like it was physically painful to be talking to him. Ronnie, not surprisingly, sat next to her with zero space between them. She thought about intervening, but someone beat her to it. She watched as Terry, of all people, stalked up to Ronnie and cut his and Alexandria's 'conversation' short. The two exchanged a few short words and Ronnie looked to Alexandria before hesitantly getting up and following Terry. Now was her chance. Maggie sauntered up to the blonde, who noticed she was coming toward her and immediately looked down at the table and angled her body away, pretending not to see her. Maggie ignored this and walked up to her. \"Hey,\" she greeted cheerily, forcefully setting down her tray and sitting across from her on the bench. She had spent an entire week tracking this chick down. She was not getting away. Alexandria didn't answer. Maggie had expected this, so she cut straight to the chase. \"I have your bag.\" She said, and the girl's blonde head looked up at her. \"It's in my locker. You should probably come get it since I can't fit my nun-chucks in there anymore.\" Alexandria just stared. Clearly, she didn't get the joke. \"...I'll give it to you after class.\" Maggie said, awkwardly taking a sip out of her juice box. After a few moments of staring weirdly at her, Alexandria nodded. \"Okay.\" Maggie nodded back. \"Okay.\" And they ate their food in silence. After Maggie had suffered through all of her classes (and Terry) she walked to her locker only to find Alexandria already there waiting for her. How did she know where her locker was…? Maggie walked up to her locker, put in the combination, carelessly swung the door open, and, heaving out the book bag, handed it over to the blonde standing, somewhat cautiously, next to her. \"Thanks,\" she said in an airy voice. \"No problem.\" Maggie replied. \"Um, Maggie?\" She turned around at the sound of her name, coming face-to-face with Ms. Zachey, her English teacher. \"Principal Doppler would like to see you in his office.\" She smiled. Principal Doppler? But she didn't do anything… \"Okay, thanks.\" Maggie smiled politely. Ms. Zachey nodded before walking off. Turning back to Alexandria, Maggie sighed. \"Well, I gotta go…\" The girl nodded. \"Okay.\" \"See you around\" Maggie said, backing away. \"Bye.\" Alexandria gave a small wave. Maggie smiled before turning around and walking off…in the general direction of Principal Doppler's office. She'd find it eventually. When she made it to the Principal's office, Maggie didn't know what to expect. She hadn't done anything wrong, that much she was sure of. It had to have been something else. She just couldn't figure out what. So, when Maggie pushed the door open to find her Math teacher standing alongside Principal Doppler and Terry sitting comfortably in one of the two seats facing Doppler's desk, she couldn't be more confused. When she didn't come in immediately, Doppler addressed her and said, \"Maggie, please, sit down.\" Looking from the Principal to Terry, she hesitantly let go of the door handle and sat in the chair next to her archenemy, not bothering to look at him as she did so. \"Mr. Richardson here tells me that you're very good at math.\" Doppler began, motioning towards her Math teacher, who waved. \"Yeeeeaaah…\" Maggie replied hesitantly. What was going on, here? Doppler continued. \"And I'm also told that you were second only to the valedictorian at your previous school.\" \"That's right.\" Terry must have told them that. \"And, as you may know, Terry here is…not doing so well.\" \"Oh…kaaaay…\" \"What I'm getting at, here, is this: if Terry,\" he pointed at Filkins, \"doesn't get his grades up, he's gonna be suspended.\" Well shoot, that was music to her ears! \"So…what do you need me for?\" Though she feared she already knew the answer. \"I'm going to assign you to him for the rest of the semester. That should be plenty of time for him to improve his grades.\" She was flabbergasted. \"Wha- what?! \" \"I want you to be his tutor.\" The only thing missing from that sentence was 'duh'. Maggie whipped her head around, her hair smacking Filkins in the face, and looked at him in disbelief. Filkins, who was now nursing his left eye, looked innocent as ever. This was a losing battle. Good thing she didn't care. \"Principal Doppler, I really don't think I'm fit to –\" \"Nonsense, you're the best we have here!\" he complimented. \"Besides, I looked into your file and I noticed you don't have any after-school activities; plenty of time to whip this young boy into shape!\" He said cheerfully, eyes crinkling. Maggie was silent for a few moments. She weighed her options, only to find that she had none. Principal Doppler rested his hands on his desk and leaned over, waiting for her answer. \"…So whaddaya say?\" Sucking up every ounce of pride and dignity and self-worth she had, Maggie answered, \"I…I would love to.\" Man , that was hard to get out. She even smiled for good measure. \" Excellent!\" Doppler exclaimed as he smacked his desk, causing her to jump. Maggie was no idiot. She knew she was cute. With her pale skin, curly brown hair, and soft blue eyes, she knew she could charm the teachers, just like Terry could. In fact, she had been asked out plenty of times, and had even been invited to sit with many-a-popular clique, but she had always turned them down. She just wasn't like that. \"Alright,\" Principal Doppler announced happily, \"You can go.\" Maggie got up and walked to the door, only to be stopped by Filkins, who opened it and held it for her. She scoffed at him and passed through, followed closely by a smirking Terry. Just before they reached the school's entrance, Maggie turned around, Filkins nearly knocking into her. \"Look,\" she said, irritated. \"I don't know what you're thinking –\" \"Pfft. Obviously.\" He interrupted. Taking a breath to calm herself, Maggie resumed. \"But I plan on following through with this. You're GOING to pass, whether you like it or not.\" She finished coldly. Filkins laughed. \"Oooh, you're not gonna fail me, are you, Ms. Lovelace?\" He mocked, waving his hands in front of him. \"I don't think I could take it.\" He held a hand over his heart. Maggie simply rolled her eyes. \"It's not funny.\" She said icily. He merely tried to keep from smiling. She rolled her eyes again. \"I'll be in the library tomorrow after school.\" She explained. At his nonchalant expression, she added, \" Be there.\" And with that, she walked out to catch the bus, her threat still hanging in the air. A/N: JUST so you know, the part when Maggie was joking with Alexandria and she didn't get it? You know, 'It's in my locker. You should probably come get it since I can't fit my nun-chucks in there anymore ' ? Yeah, that was a quote from Napoleon Dynamite. Just saying. In case you were wondering (because I know I do) this chapter was the equivalent of 5 pages in Microsoft Word :D 'Till next time.[Chapter 5] A/N: in THIS chapter: Terry actually shows up for tutoring (omg!), Maggie and Terry have a little spat, and Terry blows off steam...oh, and we finally get to see Terry's POV. Disclaimer: I do not (nor ever have) own(ed) Drillbit Taylor. Or TapOut. Or Teflon. Or Happy Meals. Or google :P Chapter 5: Pause~ When Maggie strode into the library after school the next day, she didn't expect to be there long. She greeted the librarian behind the main counter to her left, then proceeded to find a place to sit. It was a fairly nice school library. There were about 10 or so large rectangular tables in the middle of the room, with seats all around each one, and book aisles placed around the sides and back. There was hardly anyone there (why would there be when you could just use google?) Maggie walked up to the nearest table, sat down, and started to set up. She didn't expect him to come - hence the 'not expecting to be there long' - but she figured she might as well. At least she could blame him if she was ready to go and he didn't show up, and rightfully so. Pulling out her workbook, textbook, and some scrap paper from her book bag, Maggie placed them messily about her side of the table. She then took out a few pencils and erasers. Great. Now all she had to do was wait... And wait... And wait... And wait... ...and wai- okay, he's obviously not coming. As Maggie bunched up her pencils and started to put them away, Terry walked in. He didn't bother to greet the librarian as she had - didn't even acknowlege her presence, really - as he waltzed in like he owned the place. He took his sweet time making his way over to her, too. Flubber. When he finally reached her, he grabbed the seat next to hers, recklessly (and quite loudly, she might add) spun it around, and sat down, resting his arms and chin on the back of the chair. He even angled it towards her to appear as if he was actually going to pay attention. Wow. \"I've been waiting for-\" Maggie whipped her head towards the clock above the library's entrance. Call it OCD, but she had to have the exact time. \"47 minutes.\" She finished, glaring accusingly at him. Terry stared boredly at her. \"Got held up at the principal's office.\" She scoffed at him. Didn't surprise her. Not one bit. Running a hand through her hair, Maggie sighed, annoyed. \"Whatever. So, you ready? Where are your books?\" Terry stared at her, brows furrowed. \"Pfft. You're the tutor. Didn't you bring 'em?\" She nearly slapped him upside the head. Seriously! He was so insufferable! She was just itching right now to cross the small distance between them and just... hurt him. Physically hurt him. Badly. He was doing this on purpose, he just had to be. He was trying to get on her nerves. Well, she was one step ahead of him. So, rather than lose her cool, Maggie replied with a grin, \"As a matter of fact, I did. \" She was so glad she was smart enough to have considered this beforehand. Gingerly, she reached down and dug an extra notebook out of her bag, reveling in Terry's somber expression as his eyes followed the no doubt foreign object as it was placed on the table. \"Anything else?\" She smirked. \"Yeah, you got any gum?\" He asked smartly. Under normal circumstances, there would be no way in Hell that she would let him anywhere near a stick of gum, but she figured it might help him pay attention if he was happy. Sort of. Sort of happy. Not all the way. Rolling her eyes, Maggie dug into the pocket of her jacket and tossed him a piece of mint-flavored gum. \"Okay, you ready?\" \"Yyyyep.\" \"Alright, what are you stuck on?\" As the seconds passed, Maggie wondered if he was even going to answer, when suddenly he leaned back, repositioned himself in his chair so he was more comfortable, and, in a heaving sigh, answered, \"Converting.\" Well that certainly didn't give anything away. \"Okay...converting what?\" \"Slope-intercept.\" He sighed again, but more dramatically this time, running his hands through his hair. Jeez, he hadn't been here 8 minutes and he was already acting like a spoiled child. Maggie sighed again. This was gonna take a while... Over the next few days, as she attempted to explain one of the simplest (in her opinion) facets of geometry, Maggie learned a number of things about Filkins: First, he had some sort of psychological need to be at the head of the table (which she had blindly but luckily chosen). Second, he also felt the need to write with pens (which she had luckily brought), as he 'didn't like the scratch of pencils'. Third, he couldn't keep his mouth closed for more than 6 minutes at a time. She knew, she had timed it. Fourth, he was seemingly incapable of keeping his entire body still; he had to move something. And so of course it wasn't long before he took hold of one of her many strands of hair and, rather than paying attention, began randomly twirling it around his fingers. She would have objected to this, she knew he was just doing it to annoy her, but kept her mouth shut on account that he wasn't actually hurting anything, and that it would be best not to remind him of the utter absence of pain on her end from his actions. And fifth, he had... trouble ...concentrating. She had to repeat every sentence at least twice around him. And it was downright annoying. They ended up staying for an hour and a half today before decided to call it quits. \"Okay, I think that's enough for today.\" She sighed, frustrated. She was obviously more exhausted than he was. She stared at all the random scribbles on the page in front of her, her cheek resting in her palm, and thought about all the progress they hadn't made. She tried to think of a way to get him motivated, all the while oblivious to Terry as he boredly flipped and twirled and twisted that same strand of hair he had started with an hour and a half ago. She was slowly brought back to reality by a repeated tugging on said strand. Sighing once again, Maggie swatted his hand away, packed up her things, and stood up. She didn't bother waiting for Filkins as she exited the library, called her mom, and waited outside on the school steps for her to pick her up. It went on like this for a little less than a week. Maggie would set up at the library in the same spot every day after school, wait for Terry, try to explain something to him as he chewed bubblegum and messed with her hair, get frustrated, pack up, leave, and get ready to do it all over again the next day. It was very 'wash, rinse, and repeat'. She wasn't sure how much more of this she could take, and today would be no different. Or so she thought. It started out like it always did; she set up, waited for him to come and sit down and give her a reasonable but totally untrue excuse as to why he was 20 minutes late, blah blah blah. But just as she was about to open her mouth and get started, he asked, in a quite negative tone, \"What the hell's up with your hair?\" WOW. He actually noticed a cosmetic change? lol, maybe he's- she cut that thought off before it even started. ...Hey. So he could focus long enough to notice she'd put her hair up, but not long enough to do a simple math problem? Pssh. \"I put it up.\" She replied in a 'duh' tone. His brows knit together. \"Why?\" Oh my gosh. Was that even a question? \"Because it's a distraction, and you need to focus.\" She said, impatient. He scoffed in response. \"Well you should take it out. It looks awful.\" It wasn't the words themselves that caused Maggie to nearly choke on her own spit. It was the way he had said them, like it was as common as asking about the weather. He didn't regret saying anything, didn't feel sorry. And he certainly didn't apologize. He just stared at the table, looking bored. Like nothing had even happened. ...Well. Two can play at this game, sir. \"Well, you should take that rod out of your ass. Maybe you'll be nicer.\" It took everything she had not to laugh at his shocked expression as he twisted his head to look at her. Weren't expecting that now, were you? In spite of the utter pride she felt at being able to beat Filkins at his own game, Maggie also knew that what she had just said could not be reversed. It could only escalate from there. \"You know what, why don't you-\" \"Shh!\" He was interrupted by the librarian. Terry gave the old woman a glare before turning back to Maggie. In a hushed voice, he shot back, \"Why don't you slip into something more comfortable? Like a coma. \" See? \"Why don't you get a refund for your birth?\" She whispered back. There was no going back now. \"Well you must have been born on a highway, because that's where most accidents happen.\" It was on. \"You know what, you're so immature I bet you needed a ladder to reach puberty.\" \"You're calling me short? Please, you could bungee jump off a curb. \" \"You wanna know why these tutoring sessions have been taking so long? Because your brain is like Teflon; NOTHING sticks! \" \"You know, I actually thought about you all day yesterday.\" \"Oh, really? \" \"Yeah. I was at the zoo.\" \"Coming from the guy who's about as smart as an ape.\" \"You know what, how'd you even get in here? Did someone leave your cage open?\" \"Did someone leave your head open? 'Cause I think your brain just fell out.\" \"You know, I'm honestly curious, did it hurt when you fell from the Ugly Tree and hit every branch on the way down?\" \" Me? Ugly? I would love to see things from your point of view but I just can't seem to stick my head that far up my ass.\" \"Get off my planet, savage beast!\" \"Touchy, aren't we? You want me to run over to the store real quick and grab you a tampon?\" \"If I wanted a bitch I would've bought a dog.\" \"And if I wanted a prick I would've hugged a cactus.\" They were standing up now, both invading each other's personal space and trying their hardest to glare the other down. Their 'whisper fight' had escalated in both seriousness and volume, earning a rather loud \"SHH!\" from the librarian, but they didn't acknowledge her. Terry spoke again. \"You know what, if you were on fire, and I had a glass of water in my hand? I would drink it. That's how much I hate you right now.\" He snarled, but Maggie only smirked. \" Someone's a few fries short of a Happy Meal.\" He laughed mirthlessly. \"Speaking of food, what'd you have for breakfast this morning? Bitch Flakes? \" \"No, I passed them up for Sucky Charms.\" \"Why don't you just move away to Smallville? \" \"Why don't you move to China with your parents? I'm sure they'd love to see you.\" She paused, pretending to think. \"Oh, wait.. .no they wouldn't .\" Maggie knew she had struck a nerve. But like most people who are angry and caught up in the moment, she didn't give it a second thought as the words left her mouth. Terry stood only a few inches away from her face, fuming. His shoulders heaved, his nostrils flared, and if she weren't so angry herself, Maggie would have been frightened. \"...You know what, screw you. I'm outta here.\" He backed away a few steps before turning around and stalking out of the library, leaving her to stand staring after him, glaring holes into the stupid TapOut logo on his stupid jacket, rooted in her spot. Maggie stood there a few moments, relieved he was out of her face, and likewise, that she was out of his presence. When she looked up, she saw a skinny girl with a messy auburn bun half-hiding in a nearby aisle, staring at her wide-eyed. She immediately looked away as soon as they made eye contact, vanishing into one of the aisles. Guess they weren't as quiet as she thought. After sitting back down and mulling over what had just occurred between Terry and herself, Maggie finally decided to pack up and leave. As she pulled out her cellphone to text her mom, she couldn't help but think about how silly it all was. How stupid. And pointless. And dumb... She let out one final huff as she left the library. All because of a stupid bun. After he had left Maggie in the library, Terry made his way out to the school's parking lot. He decided to leave his Mustang, as he thought it was far too cramped to air out his anger at the moment. Instead, he opted to walk home. He could use some fresh air, anyway. Pulling his hood up, Terry stuffed his hands into his pockets and started walking. Along the way, he mulled over everything that had happened between Maggie and himself, and, being as stubborn and angry as he was, mentally cursed her for the first 5 minutes home. I mean, damn! All he said was... ...wait, what did he say? He couldn't remember. Arguments did that to you. ...Well anyway, it wasn't anything that called for... that. ' Bitch,' He thought bitterly. He huffed out a puff of air, watching as it appeared in front of him in the form of a cold and unforgiving cloud that practically smacked him in the face because he was walking so fast. He slowed his pace. It was nearly October, and though the days were still fairly warm, the nights got pretty chilly...did he just say 'chilly'? Chicks said chilly. Maggie said chilly. He growled, irritated with himself. Cold, he corrected. It got pretty cold out. Not chilly. He continued walking. ...Oh, now he remembered! He said she needed to put her hair down because it looked terrible up. Or something like that. Which of course, was a lie. If he was being completely honest with himself she actually looked pretty decent with that little half-bun-thing-whatever-it-was she had going on. He just liked it better down...er, so he could pull at it and irritate the crap out of her, of course. ...Wait, liked it better down? Liked?! Kill that thought. He didn't like her. And she didn't like him. I mean sure, she was cute and all, but he'd be damned if he was gonna fall for the school midget. I mean God, she was just so annoying! With her little know-it-all attitude and her stupid munchkin face, not to mention her 'holier than thou' act. Besides. Even if he did - and he was admitting to nothing - she definitely hated his guts right now, anyway. And knowing women, probably for a few weeks after that. Whatever. By now, Terry was only a couple blocks away from home. Wow. That walk didn't do anything to help his anger issues. Just then, he noticed someone walking his way. A teenager, around his age, probably headed to or from a party by the looks of it. It was Friday, after all. As they came closer, Terry recognized him as one of his classmates. And whaddaya know, he was pretty scrawny. Not as scrawny as that Wade kid he and Ronnie had been messing with, but still. He was skinny. And Terry was mad. Perfect. He needed to blow off some steam... Maggie stared out of the window of her parent's BMW as her mother drove her home. Nothing too interesting, just a bunch of street lights, trash cans, barking dogs, and the occasional night-prowler. Oh, and Prince. That was what they were listening to. Well, what her mom was listening to. Maggie just sort if tuned it out. When they were about 2 blocks away from their house, Maggie noticed an oddly-shaped trash bag lying on the sidewalk. But it looked weird. It wasn't made of plastic and it was far too big. In fact, it was almost like... 'No way,' she thought. Her eyes widened as she realized it was a person. A man. Wearing a black hoodie with some kind of logo written on the back. In fact, it looked very similar to...her mouth fell open. It was the TapOut logo. The same one she had tried to glare a hole into at the library. It was that idiot Terry. Maggie had noticed that Terry's car was still in the parking lot when they left, but she didn't think anything of it. As her mom finished the lyrics to 'Uptown', Maggie contemplated what to do. On the one hand, it served him right to finally get a dose of his own medicine. On the other, it was pretty cold out. He could catch pneumonia. Could. Besides, his heart was already frozen anyway. He would be fine. Her mother pulled into the driveway, shut off the radio (thank God) and got out, Maggie following closely behind. Claire struggled a bit in the dark trying to find the house key, but eventually they made it inside. When they walked in the door, Maggie relished in the happy atmosphere and warm glow the lights illuminating the stairwell and living room gave off. And the heat. Heat was good. Her happiness was soon replaced with guilt, however, when she thought back to outside. Back to Terry. As she watched her parents bustling around the house in an attempt to track down purses and watches and jackets (it was Friday, and they always went out on Fridays) she debated her options. \"Now, there's leftovers in the fridge if you wanna re-heat 'em. Oh, and don't forget your homework!\" Her mother said as she put on her 'special occasion' jacket. Though Maggie was distracted, she didn't miss a beat in answering. \"Okay, mom.\" Her dad came over to ruffle her hair, his left arm hanging outside his jacket. \"See ya later, baby.\" He grinned before removing his hand to feed it through the sleeve of his dress coat and following his wife out the door. \"We'll be back by 10!\" Claire called. That was code for 'around one'. Her parents never could go out and just eat at a restaurant. Like normal people. No, they had to watch a movie, or go shopping, or 'conveniently' run into old friends and talk for 3 hours. Or all of the above. Maggie would have rolled her eyes at that statement under normal circumstances, but the situation was too dire. \"Bye,\" She called back to them, just before her dad shut the door. They were such night-prowlers... Anyway, back to business. Maggie stuffed her spare house key in her pocket, took out her hair tie, ran into the kitchen to see if anything was left on (her mother could be so forgetful), and, when she heard her parents leave, bolted out the door. A/N: I think this is my favorite chapter. Really, I do. Or maybe just one of my favorite scenes. The library one, anyway. Oh, and JUST in case you were confused by the 'Lol, maybe he's-' thing , the word that came to Maggie's mind was 'gay'. Just saying. Lol. I also hope you enjoyed all those snippy comebacks ;) ALSO, I proofread this thing a bunch of times, but I also made a bunch of changes. So if you spot any typos, please tell me. Sadly, we will be venturing into some seriously cliched territory in the next chapter. In my opinion. But that's as bad as it gets, I promise...well, I can think of another scene, but I'll leave that up to you to decide when we get there. Besides, all fanfictions need a few cliche moments to bring the characters together (again, in my opinion), so bear with me. 'Till next time.[Chapter 6] A/N: In THIS chapter: Maggie takes care of a less-than-grateful Terry. Disclaimer: I do not own Drillbit Taylor. Chapter 6: Care~ Maggie ran as fast as she could, feeling like she couldn't get to him fast enough. He was only two blocks away (funny, she could have sworn it was three) but it seemed like forever. Yeah, it was kinda silly, running like crazy to try and 'save' someone you hate- well, hate was a strong word... immensely dislike , but hey, blame her maternal instincts. I mean, she still hated- disliked him, but come on, she didn't want him to die. Yet. She finally reached him. It was Terry, alright. Wearing that same stupid hoodie with that same stupid TapOut logo, lying in the same stupid position she had seen him in on the way home, and who, by the way, was still unconscious. She knelt down and touched his hand. It was cold. Very cold. Not good. Maggie then moved her hand up to his hood, pulling it off his head. Oooh, that looked like it hurt. She took in the black eye, split lip, and nasty gash that adorned his forehead. 'Seems like an improvement to me.' she chuckled to herself. Now she faced another dilemma. What was she supposed to do now? She hadn't really thought that far ahead. Should she take him to her place, or his? She could only imagine her parent's reactions if they came home to find a bloodied and bashed delinquent on their couch. The very same deliquent that she 'hated'. Her mind was made up. She would go to his house. Rolling him onto his back, Maggie searched his pockets for house keys. Bingo. She then proceeded to stand behind his head, bend down, hook her ams underneath his, and hoist him up as best she could. It wasn't that hard. If he were Ronnie she couldn't have done it, of course, but he wasn't Ronnie. Ironically, it seemed faster on the way back. But maybe it was just because she was hurrying as fast as she could to get out of public. Anyone would probably think she was trying to hide a body, or kidnapping, or a crazy ex-girlfriend. Or something. When she made it to the front door of Filkin's house, she had to admit, it felt...wrong. Like she was breaking the law or something. Well...she supposed she kind of was breaking and entering, but she was practically saving a life, here! Surely that made it okay! Maggie released an arm from underneath Terry's, trying every key on the goshdarn ring until she got to the one that worked, all the while Terry hanging awkwardly off her other arm. As she expected, it was the last key on the entire ring that opened the door. Flinging the door open, she tossed the keys carelessly inside and put her arm back underneath Filkin's armpit before her other arm gave way and she up and dropped him. Dragging him inside, Maggie immediately began searching for a place to put him. Dang, this place was nice. She stopped to observe how clean the place was, especially considering he was a guy living by himself. Spotting the staircase in front of her, Maggie considered taking him up to his room, but opted for the couch. It was closer. She placed him on the very nice (and expensive looking) sofa in the living room as gently as she could. Man, he was freezing. Yet another dilemma came up: where were the blankets in this place? Maggie spent the next 9 minutes running around like a headless chicken, opening up cupboards and closets and boxes and baskets, feeling as wrong as ever snooping around someone else's house, searching for blankets. In her frustration, she went back to some of the places she had already looked. Of course, she didn't find any. Maggie realized that by now he was probably already warmed up (at least partially), but she was also so irritated and stubborn that she was at the point of no return. She was going to find a blanket. Whether he needed one or not. And so, she searched and searched and searched, and searched some more. She was in Filkin's room, about to give up, when she saw it: a blanket. Sure, it was his bedsheets, but a blanket is a blanket. Why hadn't she thought of this before? As she looked over the covers, Maggie noticed how dirty they were. There were crumbs and food and...and some sort of stain that she didn't want to think too much about. It was probably just food, but...ugh. Grabbing a handful of sheets, Maggie forcefully jerked them forward, only to have them get cought on a snag in the box spring. She yanked again, harder this time, but to no avail. Of course, Maggie was too stubborn to just walk over and simply un-snag the sheet from its place, so she yanked again. And again. And again. She gave one final yank and the covers broke free, the force of which caused her to fall on her butt in a tangle of sheets. Dully registering a rip! sound as she hit the floor, Maggie paused for a moment in shock. Then, in a panic, wriggled as fast as she could out of the wretched fabric cocoon she had trapped herself in. ...Eeeewwwww, they smelled. 'Gross.' She stared at the bundle of germs at her feet. She didn't care how annoying or intolerable someone was, no one deserved to sleep in those things. Reluctantly picking the covers back up, Maggie put them back onto the bed, trying her best to make it look as though she were never there. Aside from the obvious tear, of course. Heading back downstairs, Maggie returned to Terry, who was still laying unconscious on the couch. Man, she had really worked up a sweat. And for someone that didn't even know what she was trying to do, too. Pfft. Maggie paused as she began to take off her oversized jacket. Wait. She was hot. He was cold. Dammit. Pulling her jacket back on in an angry huff, she strode over to where Terry lay and, swallowing her pride, got down on her knees. Slowly and awkwardly, she wrapped her arms around Filkins, half-laying on him, getting a chill as soon as they made contact. 'I hate myself,' She thought angrily as she lay her head on his chest. After about a minute or so the awkwardness faded, and with nothing else to do, Maggie observed her surroundings. There was a coffee table in front of her with a pile of mail, an empty glass, and some futuristic-looking car magazines resting on it, and just beyond that a flat-screen t.v. that rested on a sleek black stand against the wall. She couldn't help but notice the Xbox 360 Elite resting under the t.v. stand along with an open case of Grand Theft Auto IV. 'Figures,' she thought, rolling her eyes. Aaaand that was about it. From where she was sitting, anyway. Growing bored, Maggie focused on Terry's heartbeat. It seemed kind of fast, but maybe guy's hearts were just faster? He was warming up, and that was the important thing. Then a thought hit her. Pulling out her iPod Touch, Maggie opened her first-aid app. She skimmed over symptoms and warnings for pneumonia. A bit drastic, yes, but she might as well. I mean, she didn't know how long he was out there. Is the patient resting? Yes. Does the patient smoke? Maggie lifted her face up and sniffed his breath. Nope. Is the patient drinking plenty of water? Well no, but she'd see to that once he woke up. She tapped yes. Is the patient coughing up mucus? Ew, she wasn't about to check. She tapped no. Does the patient have cancer or AIDS? Did it count if the person was a cancer? She toyed with the idea of saying yes for a second before tapping no. Does the patient have a fever? She slapped a hand to his forehead. Nope. Is the patient being kept warm? Maggie chuckled to herself, raising her eyebrows suggestively even though no one was around to see. She tapped yes. The screen brought her to the conclusion that he was just cold, and (probably) didn't have pneumonia. Aw, dangit, she joked silently to herself. Putting her iPod back inside her pocket, Maggie sighed. And that was when she realized that Terry was awake. When Filkins woke up, he was in his living room. Funny, he didn't remember going to sleep there. In fact, he didn't even remember getting home that night...oh well. He closed his eyes, still tired - and oh, so very sore - and attempted to go back to sleep. Dang, these were some warm covers... ... ... Terry's eyes shot open as everything that had happened that day hit him like a ton of bricks. As he was having this epiphany, he noticed off-handedly that his blanket sighed... Wait. Wait wait wait wait wait... Blankets didn't sigh. Or breathe. Or wrap their arms around you...OHMYGODHOLYSHIT! Terry violently shook his 'covers' off of him and backed so far into the couch he nearly fell off its arm. As his eyes focused, he found that the perpetraitor was...Maggie?! Okay, question time. \"What the hell are you doing here?!\" He interrogated, yelling in panic. Maggie, who was half-sitting, half-laying on the floor a mere 4 feet away, seemed just as shocked as he was, save for the blush in her...wait a second, why were her cheeks flushed? He briefly looked himself over, thankful to find all of his clothes still intact. He looked to her, eyes squinting. \"What the hell did you do?\" He accused. \"Nothing, I didn't do anything!\" She held her hands up. Terry looked around, finding everything exactly where it should - why the hell were all the cupboards open!? He looked back at her, eyes wide, brows furrowed, and said, \"Why the hell is everything open?\" Her face blanked. \"It's not what you think-\" \"The hell it isn't! You been stealing stuff?\" \"No, I-\" \"Empty your pockets, you little theif-\" \"For your information,\" Maggie yelled over him, standing up. \"I was trying to find some blankets to warm your cold ass up!\" When he didn't say anything she added, \"I mean, what kind of idiot doesn't have blankets in their house?!\" Terry looked at her for a second, then scoffed at her stupidity. \"They're in the dryer, you dope!\" \"And how was I supposed to know that?\" \"Um, you use your brain!\" \"Well SO-RRY!\" \"You know what? I don't need you here. Get out!\" Terry got up to toss her sorry ass out, but stopped when he realized just how much everything hurt. He cursed under his breath as he clutched his side, noticing Maggie smirking like the little minx she was as she crossed her arms. \"What were you saying about...not needing me?\" \"Shut up.\" He barked, struggling to get up. He tried to stand up to his full height, but ended up tripping over his shoes and falling forward as Maggie rushed to catch him. \"Look, you need to lay back down,\" she said, helping him back onto the couch. \"Hold on.\" She instructed. \"I'll get you some water.\" And she disappeared, no doubt heading for the kitchen. Terry hung an arm lazily over his head, trying to block out the light. He started to sigh, but stopped when he felt a sharp pain in his right side. He heard rustling coming from the kitchen, the sound of running water, a crash followed by a \"DANGIT!\", and the sound of a drawer opening, no doubt in search of a towel. Terry smirked to himself. Maggie came in a few minutes later with a glass full of water and a sour look on her face. He immediately noticed the soaked spot on her pants, making it seem as if she wet herself. \"Aww, did little Maggie have an accident?\" He cooed. \"Shut up,\" She barked, setting the glass on the coffee table with more force than necessary. \"...Hey, where did you say the dryer was?\" She asked. Terry took a sip of his water. \"I didn't. \" She huffed in annoyance. \"Okay, well where is it?\" He had a smart retort on the edge of his lips, but due to the fact that he was temporarily crippled, kept it to himself. \"In the basement.\" He sighed boredly. And with that, she left once more. He expected her to come back like the annoying little flea she was and ask where exactly the basement was, but she didn't. In fact, she wasn't gone 10 seconds before he heard the basement door creak open. She must have done more snooping than he thought... Terry set his glass back on the table, putting a nearby coaster under it. His parents would kill him if they came home and found a bunch of cup rings on the stained wood. He turned his head, eyes landing on his 360. He was already bored and you can imagine how invitinng GTAIV was looking right at the moment, but the controller and t.v. remote were waaaaaayy over there, and he wasn't about to call for Maggie like some quadriplegic at a rest home. So, he just stared at various objects lying around the house for an eternity, waiting for Maggie to emerge from the baseent. She better not be messing with anything down there... Just then, the girl in question appeared, a bundle of blankets in her arms. \"Here.\" She said, holding out two blankets - a pink one and a blue one - for him to pick. \"Pff, I don't care.\" He said indifferently. Rolling her eyes, Maggie picked the pink one, probably in an attempt to embarrass him, and none-too-gracefully spread it over him. As she walked away, he noticed something very different about her. \"...Where the hell are your pants?\" She turned to look at him, hand resting on the corner of the wall. \"In the wash.\" She said simply. Now he was mad. \"You mean to tell me that you wasted an entire cup of Tide on your pants?! Do you know how much that stuff costs? It was only water!\" Maggie laughed. \"Relax, I'm doing a load of your stuff, too...Why? Am I making you uncomfortable?\" She pouted in a baby voice, rubbing away at a fake teardrop. Terry buried his face in the covers, acting as though he were trying to get warm instead of hiding the damned blush in his cheeks. \"Pssh, please. I've seen better legs on a table.\" He muttered, trying to appear uninterested. Maggie chuckled evilly before swinging around the corner. \"And by the way,\" she said, peeking back at him. \"It was pop.\" Maggie sat on the washer in the basement, swinging her legs back and forth as she waited for her load to be done. The basement was a lot smaller than she thought it would be...oh well. She could manage. She hummed a random tune as she thought back to what had just happened upstairs. It was so fun messing with Terry. She could see why he did stuff like that to other kids at school...Er, well, not stuff like that , but you know...stuff to make other people uncomfortable...eh, never mind. Honestly she didn't see what the big deal was. Her jacket was oversized, so it covered her butt and everything. She had seen girls at school with shorts that covered less than that. No big deal. Still, it was priceless to watch Filkins act all squeamish about it. Haha! ... EEERRNT! Aaaand that would be her laundry. Well, his laundry, but whatever. Maggie hopped off the washer, opened the door, and began to throw everything into the dryer. Terry was so bored out of his mind calling for Maggie was seeming like more and more of an option. But just as his resolve was about to crumble she came prancing around the corner, ignoring him completely, and skipped upstairs. The hell? His mind reasoned that maybe she needed to use the bathroom and that she wasn't screwing around with his stuff, but his poor attempt at self-comfort was soon shattered as she came back downstairs, this time with pants on. His pants. \"What the hell?!\" He yelled, making her stop halfway down the steps. She said nothing, merely finished tying off the bow she had made in his sweatpants. \"...Were you in my dresser?\" He glared at her, though he already knew the answer. She laughed. \"No! I can't fit in there!\" Why that little smart-ass... Unfortunately he didn't have anything in his arsenal of comebacks that fell under the category of 'dresser', so Terry stayed quiet, staring at her in disbelief. The nerve of that girl! \"Come on.\" She said suddenly, making a move to go back upstairs. \"What?\" He asked, confused. She rolled her eyes. \"Come on,\" she repeated. \"You wanna get your face cleaned up, don't you?\" Oh, yeah. His face. He knew he had been beaten up, but he didn't know how bad. Though judging from how bad he was feeling he wouldn't wanna go looking in a mirror any time soon. Terry pushed the blanket off of him and attempted to get up, grunting as the sharp pain returned in his side. What was that? Maggie looked at him sympathetically, and he automatically hated her for it. \"Do you need help?\" She asked with a hint of concern. \"No.\" Came his curt reply. Oh, it hurt. Just not to the point where he was doubling over in pain or anything, and certainly not to the point where he was about to ask for help, let alone hers. He slowly made his way to the staircase, grabbing onto the railing as soon as he reached it. With each step he took, Maggie took one step backwards, probably making sure he wasn't gonna tumble over or anything. This angered him, because...well, he wasn't handicapped, for God's sake! In the hallway that lie at the top of the stairs, the bathroom was the first door on the right. Terry went in and, putting the lid down, sat on the toilet, Maggie following close behind. She turned on the light, went over to the cabinet that rested above the sink, took out his parent's first-aid kit, and knelt down in front of him, resting it on the shower ledge. He had a feeling he wasn't going to enjoy this... \"Okay, you ready?\" Maggie asked. When he said nothing she took that as a 'yes'. She then proceeded in taking a sterilized wipe to his face, cleaning off some of the grime. She made sure not to be gentle; he got himself into this mess, and she'd be damned if he didn't feel the pain. She inwardly smirked to herself when she saw him wince. As she cleaned off his face, she realized that she probably should have done it as soon as she had brought him in, not an hour and 43 minutes later. More risk of infection, but she wasn't about to tell him that. After she was done, she tossed the wipe into a little trash bin that sat beside the toilet. She then grabbed a bottle of salve, opened it, and squoze some out onto her finger. Just as she was about to put some on the gash on his forehead, Terry jerked his head away and grabbed her wrist. \"God damnit, I'm not a baby!\" She sighed, looking at him disapprovingly. \"I know that, you idiot. Look, of you wanna be the one to do this, then by all means, go ahead.\" She started to get up, but he tightened his grip on her wrist and jerked her back down. \"...Are those things even clean?\" He asked, tone sour. She looked down at her hands, realizing what he was talking about. \"Well of COURSE I washed my hands, are you nuts?!\" Actually she hadn't, but he didn't need to know that. Terry eyed her skeptically before muttering \"Whatever...\" and releasing her wrist, allowing her to continue. Maggie got back to work, putting salve wherever it was needed, which luckily wasn't much. She then moved on to the alcohol...oh, wait. Was she supposed to do that before or after the salve? Terry must have caught on to her uncertainty, because he said, \"Do you even know what you're doing?\" Holding her chin up, Maggie confidently replied, \"YES.\" And she dabbed some alcohol onto a cotton ball, and quite forcefully placed it on his forehead. He started to wince, but cut himself off, obviously trying to be 'tough'. Whatever. She wiped his face off again, and put a couple of butterfly bandaids on the more serious cuts. When she was done, she gathered up everything she had used and threw it all away. She was about to close up the first-aid kit, but Terry stopped her. \"Wait.\" He said. He then proceeded to take off his hoodie, grunting in pain as he did so, and lifted up his gray sleeveless undershirt, revealing a shard of glass stuck in his side. \"Is it bad?\" He asked, not looking at her. Was it bad? There was a giant piece of glass jammed into his rib, of course it was bad! Maggie knelt back down, moving her hands toward the wound. She hovered over the shard of glass, but decided not to touch it. Upon further inspection she noticed a trail of fresh blood oozing over the old, dried, crusted one. He must have reopened it when he came up the stairs or something. And it looked like it was in there pretty deep...well shoot, she wasn't trained for this! Maggie opened and closed her mouth, searching for what to say. \"I...I think-\" \"Just say it!\" He snapped. \"I think you should go to the hospital.\" She finished. Terry shook his head. \"No. No, you can do it, just-\" \" No, I cant,\" she said, getting angry. \"You don't... see, how deep it is. It could get infected-\" \"I dont care, just take it out!\" He ordered. \"No!\" Taking her hands away, Maggie stood up and attempted to leave the room, only to be stopped as Terry latched onto her wrist and forcefully spun her back around. \"You are going to help me, you little witch,\" he said threateningly as he brought her eye-to-eye with him. \" Whether you like it or not.\" He finished through clenched teeth. Jerking her hand out of his grip, Maggie gave him a glare before sitting back down next to him and opened the first-aid kit again, searching for something to take the glass out with. She found a device that looked like a cross between tweezers and tongs. Perfect. She grabbed them and held them near the shard, taking a breath to steel herself. \"Here,\" she said, offering her hand out to him. He looked at her quizzically. \"For the pain,\" she explained. \"You're gonna want something to grab on to. Trust me.\" Reluctantly, he took her hand. She turned her attention back to the wound. Taking another breath, she asked, \"Ready?\" \"Yeah,\" he replied, taking a breath himself. With slow movements, Maggie grabbed the shard gently but firmly with the twongs (or whatever they were called) and pulled. Terry grunted loudly in pain, gripping her hand tightly. Seeing his distress, she immediately ceased her movements, breath hitching as she looked up at him. \"No,\" he said, loosening his grip ever so slightly. \"Keep going.\" Looking back at her progress, Maggie decided it would be best to get it out as quickly as possible. Squeezing the twongs tighter, she adjusted her grip on Terry's hand, wrapping her fingers around his almost as tightly as he had, and in that moment she knew that it dawned on him what she was about to do. Leaving no room for protest, Maggie gripped the glass even harder, and yanked it out. \"AAAH!\" He screamed, and the pain in her hand was unimaginable. She held the offending object up to her face for further inspection. It came out pretty quick. It must not have been in there as deep as she thought. It looked like some type of beer bottle, and as she looked closer she could make out part of a logo. \"Is that it?\" Her gaze snapped to Terry, who was staring at the piece she was holding. \"Yeah.\" She said. It was then that she noticed how hard he was still gripping her hand. Man , that hurt! Squirming uncomfortably, she tried to not make it obvious; after all, he was the one who had just had a foreign object surgically removed from his body, not her. Terry, however, now that he had calmed down, noticed her pained expression and let go of her. A bit of an awkward silence followed, but not for long. Tossing the shard in the trash, Maggie cleaned and dressed his wound. She rinsed off the twongs and put everything away. As she finished washing her hands, she picked up Terry's hoodie, shaking off any excess dirt. She was about to go downstairs and toss it in the wash, but he snatched it back. \"Give me that.\" He said, annoyed. Her brows knit together. \"You mean you're still gonna wear it?\" \"Yeah, why not?\" He asked as he pulled it back over his head. \"It's got blood on it!\" She exclaimed. \"So? I've had worse things on my clothes than blood.\" Well that left a lot to the imagination. Rolling her eys, Maggie turned to leave. \"Thanks.\" She froze in her spot. Did he just...? She finally turned around to face him, eyebrows furrowed in disbelief. \"What?\" She asked, mostly to herself. Terry breathed in deeply, probably in annoyance, and repeated, \"I said thanks.\" She looked down at the floor, feeling a little confused. \"You're welcome.\" She said quietly, and turned to go back downstairs. Terry really didn't see what the big deal was. All he did was say thank you. Was that a crime? Was it so inconceivable that she had to turn around and jump to the hostile side of the fence? She practically saved him a few thousand dollars at the hospital, he'd be an ass not to thank her! Oh, wait. That's pretty much what she thought he was... Terry thought about heading to his room and crashing - he was dead tired - when Maggie appeared in the doorway again. \"Hey, do you like...want something to eat?\" She asked, looking somewhat embarrassed. What, she was gonna start living here now?! Did she think she could just waltz into his kitchen and touch all his stuff? Because if that was the case then she could just go- \"I was gonna make sweet and sour chicken, but I wasn't sure if you wanted something else...\" She trailed off, sounding a bit more irritated. Sweet and sour chicken? As in Chinese food? As in a piping hot, steaming meal? That he didn't have to make? Well no one had said about a full-blown dinner, here. This was a totally different ball game. \"...That's fine.\" He answered begrudgingly, trying to hide his eagerness at getting some food in his belly. \"Okay.\" And she left. Thinking he was finally alone, Terry began to sigh, but she was back 2 seconds later. \"Oh, and what do you want for dessert?\" Was she serious? She was gonna make dessert, too? Well damn, maybe he should keep her... \"Because I was gonna make that angel toffee cake you've got in there, but I didn't know if you'd want it or not.\" Angel what , now? If he wasn't mistaken, he didn't have anything like that in there. But if she was offering... \"Yeah, whatever. That's fine.\" He said, rubbing his eye as he waved her off. Maggie nodded and disappeared, but not before walking up to him and handing him an ice pack. \"For your eye.\" She explained. Terry held it in his hands for a few moments before raising it up to his black eye. He stayed that way for about 30 minutes. He was seriously considering going to bed right now. He was sore, he was tired...Maggie could wake him up when the food was ready. Getting up from his spot on the toilet, Terry walked over to the mirror to look himself over. He had two butterfly bandaids on his forehead, and one on his cheekbone. His black eye was down to a light purple, and he could only imagine how bad he looked when Maggie had found him. That kid had clocked him pretty good. How was he supposed to know he was a member of the boxing club? All he wanted was a way to blow off some steam- His train of thought stopped in its tracks as an unfamiliar smell wafted into the bathroom. Oh, God, was that dinner? It smelled so good... That's it. He was definitely not going to sleep. Terry went downstairs and, wincing a little as he bent down, turned on his 360. He popped in GTAIV and plopped down onto the couch, wincing yet again. Dammit, since when did he get so fragile? He glanced behind him every now and then, even though he could only see the corner that rounded to the kitchen, to check and see if dinner was ready. He had just finished hijacking a car when Maggie came in. \"Dinner's ready.\" She announced in a somewhat irritated tone. Finally! Hitting pause, he dropped his controller onto the couch and followed her to the dining room. When he got there he stopped in his tracks. He had to say, he was impressed. There was a pile of chicken on his plate, mixed with some veggies and...was that pineapple? Anyway, there was chicken, a can of soda, and a little bowl of what he could only assume to be rice. He didn't even know he had this stuff in his kitchen. \"I already ate,\" Maggie said, pulling his chair out for him. \"So dig in.\" She went back into the kitchen as he sat down and stuffed his face. When he was done, he sat back in his chair, savoring the feeling of being full. Maggie came back out and took his soda can and rice bowl. She came back to take his plate, but he grabbed onto the other end, stopping her. \"What are you doing?\" He asked for the hundredth time that night. \"I'm taking your plate.\" She said, annoyed. \"No, I mean why are you doing this?\" She knew what he was talking about. She would never be this nice to him on any other day. Something was up. \"Look, it doesn't matter-\" \"Yes it does. Now why are you acting all nicey-nice?\" \"I'm trying to be nice to you, you idiot!\" \"I know! And that's the problem! WHY are you being so nice to me?!\" \"Because, you've just been through a traumatic experience-\" he scoffed \"-and you could use a little 'nice' for a change.\" She finished, an invisible vein throbbing in her forehead. Was she serious? She was breaking her neck trying to be nice to him just because he was a little beat up? Damn, this girl was something else, haha! This was hilarious, he'd have to get hurt more often! Masking a smirk with an untrusting scowl, Terry said nothing, and stayed silent. But, actions speak louder than words, and he was about to do something that would speak volumes. Deciding to test her patience, Terry let go of the plate. Maggie stumbled backwards, twisting a bit, before reeling and falling on the floor. Seconds passed. Shock set in. Silence followed. Emotions ran high. Hiding a smile, Terry watched as she slowly stood back up, collected her dignity, and, taking a moment to calm herself, begrudgingly walked back into the kitchen. She hadn't said a word. Wow, she was serious about this. She came back a couple minutes later with a plate full of that angel-toffee-whatever. Damn, he wasn't sure if he could eat it. \"It's not as cold as it should be,\" she said, setting it down a bit forcefully in front of him. \"But it's still good.\" And she left again. Ignoring her now unmasked sour attitude, Terry stared at the cake in front of him, unsure if he should eat it or not. She may have poisoned it. He wouldn't put it past her. Ah. Screw it. He'd had a really shitty night. He deserved this beautifully-created delicacy made by the hands of his arch-nemesis. After he was done eating, Terry went back to his game. He was just about to press play when a though hit him. What time was it? Rather than twist his head aaall the way around to read the clock waaaay on the other side of the room, he hit the dashboard button on his controller. 12:22 A.M. Wow. Just then, Maggie called out to him. \"I'm leaving.\" She announced. Terry turned around to face her. She was standing by the door with her hand on the knob. Her hair was down, and he noticed the sweatpants she had been wearing had been replaced with her own. \"Okay...\" he said, trying to sound like he didn't care...uh, because he didn't, of course. \"Okay...\" she repeated, and opened the door. \"Wait,\" he said, getting up. He winced as he did so - his movements were far too quick for his injured body. She paused, staring at him. \"You're not gonna...\" dammit. He decided to rephrase. \"You better not tell anyone about this.\" He threatened. \"I won't.\" She said shortly. \"Not if you actually start paying attention.\" She finished smugly. He knew what she was talking about. Their pathetic excuse of tutoring sessions. There was the quiet, calculating, unfriendly, blackmailing bitch he knew. \"Pfft. Yeah, whatever.\" He replied. She made to leave again. \"Hey...why'd you help me?\" He asked. And no, he wasn't trying to keep her there longer. He wasn't. He was genuinely curious about this. It was what he had been trying to come up with an answer for ever since he noticed she was in his house. When she finally answered, it seemed rehearsed, like she had been asking herself the same thing, but her words still held their sarcastic edge. \"Because unlike some people, I actually care.\" And she left. Terry stood there for a second, considering her words. He sighed, turning off the 360. He didn't feel like stealing cars or pimping hos anymore. As he made his way to the kitchen for a quick drink (milk sounded good) all sorts of thoughts went through his head, most of which centered around Maggie. How was Monday going to go? Would she keep her mouth shut? Was there any more of that cake? Maybe he shouldn't be so hard on her. After all, she did practically save his life, right? And where were his keys? Maybe she wasn't so bad after all. Maybe he should soften up. It'd be pretty damn nice having a gourmet meal every night... She wasn't bad-looking, either. She was actually pretty cute, even beautiful. He was actually surprised when her mom had told him she'd never had a boyfriend. He wondered if- WOAH. He was not about to just entertain the idea of them...together? Was he? She must have put a hallucinogen in that cake... Still, she could probably be a cool...friend. Or something. I mean, how many girls did he know that would (let alone could) nurse a bloodied almost-stranger back to health? None. So she had to be kind of cool... As his personal opinion of Maggie rose higher and higher, Terry walked into the kitchen. His stitches nearly burst open when he saw the mountain of pots, pans, mixing bowls, cups, utensils, and plates sitting none too gracefully in the sink. And to top it all off, she hadn't cleaned the counter space. There were piles of flour, sugar, whipped cream, milk, and- was that hair?! He gaped at everything that was waiting for him to clean up. Bitch... A/N: Yep. And the corny-ness continues :/ lol jk. That'll be it. For now. Lol. XD In case you didn't quite catch what happened as to why Terry was all beat up (or you just skimmed, like I tend to do) he pretty much got his face smashed in by the kid he saw in the last chapter :D ...Wait, that's nothing to smile about :( If you've never had sweet and sour chicken, you should try some. Really, you should. You wouldn't think that chicken and pineapple go, but they really do. And yes, angel toffee cake is very real. In fact, if you haven't had any, I recommend the recipe from the website tasteofhome. It's REALLY good. For anyone and everyone that's interested, I will be updating on Mondays and Fridays until this story is finished. And it WILL. BE. FINISHED. Oh, and I feel kinda bad since I haven't said this yet, so let me take a moment to say thank you to everyone who has bothered to review and fave, and especially to all those who don't have an account that look/read. It really annoys me when a fanfic author drops a story just because they aren't getting the amount of reviews they wanted. What about all the people who love the story that don't have an account? I have been there, too, and because of this I will not EVER abandon a story for such a silly reason. So rest assured, for this boat shall sail on! :D Okay, rant over :| 'Till next time! Tell me if you encounter any of the incredibly deadly typos! (points if you get the reference)[Chapter 7] A/N: In THIS chapter, Maggie decides to get some friends, hang out at a skate park, go to the movies, and enjoy Terry's absence. Disclaimer: I do not own Drillbit Taylor. Chapter 7: Intermission~ Maggie shut the door to her house, locking it. She still had an estimated 23 minutes before her parents got home, so she took her time going around the house locking windows, closing blinds, and turning off lights. When she was finished, she headed upstairs to her room. Knowing that when her parents got home they would turn all the lights back on when she was trying to sleep, she shut her bedroom door. Sighing, Maggie hopped under the covers of her bed, letting the night's events sink in. She still couldn't believe that Terry had been beat up. It was almost too good to be true. Even more, she couldn't believe she had actually helped him. She had seen him in a heap on the sidewalk and everything else was just instinct, she suppposed. Her and her stupid bleeding heart. She just cared too much. Dammit. Strangely enough, Maggie didn't have a very nice weekend. It just felt like she didn't... do anything. Sure, she helped around the house, watched her favorite shows, and messed around outside, but it all felt so... the climax of the events two days prior made everything seem dull in comparison. She needed a change. \"Maybe you should go out with some friends,\" her mother had suggested. \"I don't have any friends, mom.\" She said. \"Well get some!\" Her mother replied. Yeah. She should. But everything wasn't that simple. Maggie wasn't the type to just walk up to someone and say 'hi'. And besides that, people didn't usually go near her anyway. She had a pleasant face, but her demeanor tended to put people off, so they stayed away from her. She had always told herself she didn't need any friends (which was true, she could manage just fine without them) but wanting friends was an entirely different matter, and she was seriously starting to consider her mother's advice. Inevitably, however, by the end of the weekend, Maggie had made up her mind. She would NOT come home tomorrow without a friend. When Maggie made it to her first class the next day, Terry was nowhere to be found. She couldn't say she was surprised. Who would want to come into class with a shiner like that? She did feel a twinge of panic race through her for a split-second when she thought of all of the insane possible reasons he didn't show (besides the black eye, of course), most of which centered around that gash in his side. Did it get infected? Did he have to go to the hospital? Was he lying on his death bed? Was he already dead? Was it all her fault? Had she inadvertently killed him? Of course, once she noticed that his car was no longer still sitting in the school's parking lot she realized that he had to have been fine and she was just being silly. Dead people didn't take their cars to Heaven. ...or Hell. Whichever. She wished she could play the saint and say that Terry's presence was missed, but that would be a lie. In fact, she enjoyed every second of it. It was unbelievably nice being able to fully concentrate, to not have her hair pulled, to not have to worry about being tripped, to not have to be so stressed...yep. She could definitely find a friend today. Without all of the distractions, Maggie was in a very good mood by the time lunch came around. She sat in the corner - alone - like she usually did, though she knew that was no way to make friends. But just as she thought about moving to a more populated area, someone sat down at her table. Wow. Maybe it was a good way to make friends. Maggie immediately recognized the person. It was that girl! The same girl who had been eavesdropping on her and Terry's little 'spat' in the library, the skinny one with the auburn hair. \"Hi.\" She greeted, earning a nod from Maggie. The girl paused before introducing herself. \"I'm Rachel.\" Huh. Okay. \"Maggie,\" Maggie replied, reaching across the table to shake her hand. \"Cool,\" Rachel said, looking at the table. She seemed quirky, but shy, and Maggie had a feeling this could work. \"I saw you with Filkins the other day,\" said Rachel, obviously ashamed at having just admitted she had been spying. \"I know.\" Maggie replied simply. Rachel continued. \"It's just that...why do you hang out with him? I mean, he's... mean .\" she finished lamely. Well that was unexpected. Usually potential friends didn't ask you about the people you 'hung out' with, let alone why. Unless she was mistaken. Nevertheless, Maggie wasn't offended. She knew Rachel was just curious, not condemning, about her social circle (or lack thereof). She answered immediately. \"Oh, um, I don't, it's just that...\" she sighed, deciding to start over. \"Principal Doppler told me to get his grades up before the end of the semester, so I've been... tutoring him.\" She finished, annoyed at the memory. Rachel nodded in understanding. \"Oooooh, okay. So you don't, like... like him or anything, right?\" Did she say understanding? She meant confusion. \" No .\" Maggie replied, her voice coming out more hostile than she intended. Rachel, however, seemed unaffected. \"Oh. Okay.\" They ate for a few minutes in silence, but Maggie had the distinct feeling Rachel had something to say. It wasn't long before her theory proved correct. \"So, do you want to, like...go out sometime?\" Maggie's head shot up. Where did that come from?! Upon seeing her slightly horrified expression, Rachel held her hands up in defense. \"NOT like that! I mean just...out. Like outside of school? Like, the mall, or...do you wanna be friends?\" Jackpot. We have a winner. If Maggie weren't such a quiet keeps-to-themselves kind of person she would have done a backflip and sang 'yes' loud enough for the entire cafeteria to hear. In another universe, that is. Instead, she set her expression to neutral, and waited a few short seconds before replying, \"Okay.\" Rachel's face brightened. \"Great! Um, here, I'll give you my number!\" She said excitedly, reaching over the table to grab Maggie's cellphone. As she was putting in their numbers, a boy came up and sat down next to Rachel. \"Hey, Rachel,\" he greeted, patting her on the shoulder. He looked over at Maggie as if just noticing her, though Maggie had noticed him staring from across the room for about 5 minutes. \"Who's this?\" He asked, interested. \"My new friend Maggie.\" Explained Rachel, still messing with their phones. Silence... \"Oh, this is Danny.\" Rachel introduced, handing Maggie her phone back. Maggie stared at the two of them, and they did the same to her. They seemed pretty close, but she couldn't tell if they were related, a couple, or just really good friends. My, the lines have blurred. \"So, are you two...\" Maggie gestured with her hands. Almost immediately they scooted away from each other, their expressions turning from inquiring to awkward. Rachel chuckled, trying to lighten the mood. \"Oh, no, we're just friends.\" She explained. \"We've been best friends for like...ever, haha.\" Maggie nodded. \"Oh, okay.\" She looked over at Danny, who was still staring at her. She hated it when people did that, just stared and said nothing. But she kept her thoughts to herself. Instead, she focused on his appearance. He had short, dark brown hair, which was spiked in the middle, almost like a mohawk, except it wasn't nearly long enough. He had a pretty pleasant face - sun-kissed skin, nice smile and all that - and he seemed like an easy-going guy, and judging from the way he was dressed he looked like a member of the skater clique. She really wasn't liking the way he was looking at her, though. She would have asked him what his problem was, but he was Rachel's friend and she didn't want to blow her first (and possibly only) chance at friendship before graduation. Instead, she focused on eating her food. He obviously wanted to say something, but she really hoped he wouldn't. She had enough 'dude problems' as it was. Just then, Maggie spotted Ronnie. He was busy scaring some kid out of his seat to make way for him and...was that Alexandria?! She craned her neck for a better view, but Danny blocked her vision. \"So you new here, or something? I don't remember seeing you last year.\" Maggie looked at him, her face everything but expressive. \"Yeah. I just moved here at the end of August.\" She had said the words blandly, but Danny, God bless his soul, actually seemed interested. \"Cool, cool...so where you from?\" He asked casually, drumming his fingers on the table. \"Across town,\" she replied, being as vague as possible. She had known him for all of 2 minutes. He didn't need to know her business. Danny, however, apparently wasn't satisfied with this answer, and pressed further. \"Wwwwhere across town?\" He asked, leaning over the table, a mischievous grin on his face. The nerve of this guy! Rachel 'tsked' and promptly jabbed him in the ribs. \"Oh, don't mind him, Maggie. He's just nosy .\" She jabbed him again. Danny just smiled and rolled his eyes. Maggie had only a few moments of solace, however, before he asked again. \"So where were you?\" She couldn't stop the sarcastic reply that flew from her lips. \"In LaLa Land, on the other side of the rainbow. My mother's a faerie and my dad's a surgeon. He goes by Dr. Lollipop. Have you heard of him?\" Danny stared at her with a surprised (shocked, even) expression, his eyebrows shooting for the moon. For a second she thought she had blown it, but Rachel suddenly burst out laughing. \"Ahahahahahahaaaa! Maggie, you are SO funny!\" Well that was new. Since when was she funny? Most people thought she was sarcastic, grumpy, pessimistic, or all-of-the-above. This was certainly an unexpected - though not unwelcome - turn of events. She looked at Danny again to gauge his expression, surprised (though not outwardly so) to find him trying to stop from laughing as well, his mouth twisted into an awkward kind of smirk. The rest of lunch went by okay. Rachel would ask her a question every 30 seconds (how old are you, what kind of music do you like, what's your favorite color, etc.) and Maggie would give the shortest answer possible, though she made an effort to be as politely 'elaborative' as she could, all the while trying to ignore the fact that Danny wouldn't quit staring at her. Eventually Danny left, saying he had to get to class, but not before saying, \"Bye, Mags.\" Okay, when did she say it was okay for him to give her a nickname? The second he left, Rachel leaned over the table and whispered excitedly, \"Oh, my, gosh, Danny totally likes you!\" Maggie knit her brows together. \"What? How could you know that? He doesn't like me.\" Rachel waved her hand away in an 'oh, please' manner. \"Oh, please.\" Told you so. \"He is totally into you! And who could blame him, you are totally gorgeous...I bet your cafeteria dessert that he'll ask you out by the end of the semester.\" She smiled, waving her pudding spoon at her. The end of the semester would be in January. It was October now. That gave Rachel roughly 2-and-a-half months to be right. Well shoot, anything could happen in two months! Still, she felt as though it were highly unlikely. \"Okay,\" Maggie agreed, reaching out to shake her hand. Rachel withheld said hand. \"Ah, ah. You pinky-swear on bets.\" She held out her pinky. Maggie paused. She did not do pinky swears. That was something prissy girls did. 'Do you want to keep your friends?' Her conscience asked. 'Do it.' And so, blushing lightly in embarrassment, Maggie extended her pinky towards Rachel's. \"Deal!\" Rachel grinned, entwining their little fingers. \"I gotta get to class with Danny, but I'll see you around, okay?\" She said, picking up her things. \"Okay.\" Maggie replied, watching her go. She sat there a moment before getting up to go to class herself. Maybe this friend thing could work out after all. Terry wasn't there the next day, either. Though, Maggie barely had any time to acknowledge this fact as she had her plate full. Full of Rachel, that is. It hadn't even been a day and she was texting her nonstop. The second she stepped in the door to her house Rachel called. Maggie wasn't much of a conversationalist, but they had somehow managed to be on the phone with each other for 2 whole hours. In those 2 hours, Maggie learned a lot about Rachel. She liked to make bets, for one thing. They were always harmless in the sense that she never asked anything crazy if she won, but they were bets nonetheless. She also liked spending time outside, or at least, out of the house. In fact, she had invited Maggie out to the movies within the first 10 minutes of their conversation. Maggie accepted, but somewhat regretted it when it became known that Danny would be there. It wasn't that she didn't like Danny, it was just that she didn't particularly enjoy all of the obvious attention he was giving her. She half-expected Rachel to give him her number, but she assured her that she would never do that without her permission. Maggie was skeptical of this, but didn't inquire any further. Thankfully Rachel didn't take any offense to Maggie's lack of phone-talking skills. She had plenty of questions to balance her short answers anyway, and even after they were done talking on the phone, Rachel would almost immediately text her for another hour with a billion more. Maggie never really understood the concept of 'lols' and 'omgs', but she was starting to see the appeal. And Tuesday was no different. After her first few classes, she met up with Rachel at lunch, followed soon after by Danny, who tried to spark a conversation with her even before he sat down. \"Hey, Mags, how you doin'?\" He asked cheerfully, setting his tray down next to Rachel's. Rather than give another snide comment, Maggie decided to (try to) be nice. Though that nickname was already starting wear on her. \"Fine.\" She answered, smiling slightly. Rolling her eyes, Rachel traded her cupcake for Danny's tater-tots. \"Told you I could get her to smile.\" Danny said, giving Rachel a dazzling grin. Rachel rolled her eyes. \"I didn't say you couldn't make her smile , I said not within the first week,\" she explained. Danny happily bit into his cupcake. Ignoring their antics, Maggie looked over to find Alexandria sitting with Ronnie again. They had been spending a lot more time together lately. How suspicious... Danny once again broke her chain of thought. \"So Rachel tells me you're goin' to the movies with us this Friday,\" he smiled. \"What do you wanna see?\" She actually hadn't thought about that. \"I dunno, what is there?\" Danny leaned back off the table and began counting fingers, his expression thoughtful to the point it was funny. \"Let's see, we got...\" As he went through the list of names, Maggie realized she didn't really want to see any of them. How was she supposed to choose between a rock and a hard place? Rachel somehow picked up on her distress and said, \"Don't worry about it, Maggie. I've already decided what we're going to see.\" Danny scoffed. \"Lemme guess: The Notebook 2: Gayness Reloaded?\" Rachel punched his shoulder. Hard. \"That movie was not gay, it was sweet! And no, It's a comedy,\" she huffed, cheeks burning. \"Whatever,\" he chuckled, shaking his head. Maggie stared at them, amused. They were so close that she found it hard to believe they weren't related. \"Okay, so we'll pick you up after school on Friday. Got it?\" Rachel asked. Maggie blinked, snapping out of her daze. \"Oh, um...yeah.\" The bell rang. As Rachel and Danny started to get up, Maggie (for some unknown reason) felt the need to ask, \"So, who's driving?\" Danny and Rachel looked at each other, smirking in sync. \" Danny is,\" said Rachel slyly. Danny took out his keys, jingling them in the air. Rachel chuckled. \"You drive?\" Maggie asked. \"Oh, I GOT my license!\" He snapped his fingers in a feminine fashion. \"Oh, stop it.\" Rachel chastised, putting a hand on his shoulder. \"Pssh. Whatever.\" Came his nonchalant reply as he tossed his keys into the air. \"Bye, Maggie!\" Called Rachel as she ushered Danny out. \"Yeah, bye Mags,\" He called, throwing his keys in the air again. \"Bye,\" Maggie called back. This had to be the most talking she had done in all her life. Wednesday came and went, a near exact repeat of the day before. Terry was still a no-show. Rachel talked her ear off at lunch. The only thing different was that Danny had invited her to a skate park. She was inclined to say no, but she had never been to one before and she needed a new experience. She knew he wouldn't have been crushed or anything if she had declined - he was too easy-going for that - but in all honesty it was kind of hard to deny the boyish glint of hope in his eyes when he had asked her. Besides. Rachel would be there. It wasn't like she wouldn't have someone to talk to. Or rather, talk to her. Never mind. So, rather than laugh at the fact that he was asking her to go a skatepark, of all places (she knew he looked like the skater type!) she simply said yes. She could only assume she had made the right decision. After about 10 minutes of being at the skate park, Maggie was (overall) glad she decided to come. She had to admit, it was thoroughly entertaining to watch all of the flips and tricks they did (not to mention the occasional blunder). She didn't feel socially awkward either, thanks to Rachel. During breaks, Danny would bring a couple of his skater friends over to her and Rachel to talk to. Maggie didn't add much to the conversation, but she was content with listening anyway. This one guy kept talking with Danny and Rachel about how angry he was with his girlfriend for cheating on him, but Maggie couldn't catch all of the details because a half-skater, half-emo by the name of 'Jacob' kept trying to talk to her. She got the distinct feeling he was flirting with her, but she couldn't be sure. Not until Danny and his friends went back to skating and Rachel sauntered over to tell her all about it, that is. Maggie felt that she was over exaggerating a bit, but Rachel disagreed. \"Guys don't talk to you unless they like you.\" She said. Well shoot, if that was the case then nearly every guy on the planet liked her! Maggie was seriously beginning to doubt her friend's romantic compass, but held her tongue on the possibility that she was so crazy she was right. After about 2 hours of hanging out at the ramps, Danny and Rachel dropped Maggie off at her house, said their goodbyes, and headed home themselves. As expected, her mother hit her with a barrage of questions the second she walked in the door. When did you get friends? How was the skate park? Was that a boy I saw? What are their names? When are you going out again? Maggie had kind of just called her mom after school and asked if she could go out with friends that day. Her mom, so flabbergasted by all of this new information, had just said yes. Maggie had been so time-consumed with Rachel's...well, Rachel-ness, that she'd completely forgotten to tell her parents about her new friends. Whoops. She had a lot of gaps to fill. The movies were okay. There were so many people there that night that Rachel went ahead of them to save seats, leaving Maggie with Danny at the concession stand. She had a feeling this was no accident. Danny paid for an insanely priced large popcorn, and, noticing Maggie staring at the candy display, a pack of gummie bears. She tried to decline, saying they could just buy some after the show for a dollar, but he acted like it was no big deal and bought them anyway. When they got to their theater, Rachel had saved them the last 2 seats. And they were side-by-side. Which meant that she would have to sit next to Danny. Now she knew this was no accident. So in the end, she ended up sitting on the end of one of the first few rows, next to Danny, who sat next to Rachel, who sat next to some fat guy. Danny, being in the middle, held the popcorn. Rachel had no problem digging her - probably unwashed - hands into the bag, but Maggie stuck with her gummie bears. It was an okay film. She recognized a few of the actors, but their names escaped her. The story was good enough (for a comedy) and it made her laugh, so it was good enough for her. By the time she had gotten through her gummie bears, Maggie looked over to see that Rachel and Danny had devoured the entire bag of popcorn on their own. Wow. They could eat. When the movie was over, they got rid of all their trash and went to the bathroom. As they walked out to Danny's (well, his parent's) truck, Rachel ranted. \"I didn't think it was that good. I mean, it was so cliche! And I couldn't get over the way that one guy looked!\" \"Aw, can it, Rach. So what if it was? It made me laugh, so it works for me.\" Danny said jokingly, hands digging in his pockets for his keys. Rachel sighed. \"It just wasn't as 'original' as they said it was, that's all.\" \"You mean like your face?\" \"Shut up.\" Upon noticing Maggie's quietness, Rachel asked, \"What did you think of it, Maggie?\" Her head shot up at the sound of her name. \"Oh, um, I liked it.\" She said, and both Rachel and Danny's heads turned in her direction. \"Oh. Well I'm glad you liked it,\" Rachel beamed. \"See, Danny? Don't I know how to pick 'em?\" He gave her a funny look. \"You just said it sucked-\" \" Don't talk back.\" She interrupted, jabbing him with her elbow. Maggie silently chuckled to herself before climbing in. The ride home was pleasant. Rachel sat in the middle, so Maggie didn't have to endure the awkwardness of sitting next to Danny. As they pulled up to Maggie's house, Rachel spoke. \"So we'll see you Monday?\" \"Yeah, I don't see why not.\" Maggie replied. Rachel smiled brightly. \"Great! See you!\" Maggie hopped out of the truck. \"Yeah, see you.\" She waved. \"Bye!\" Danny and Rachel chimed simultaneously, waving as they drove off. Maggie turned around to walk up to her house, only to be greeted by her mother standing in the doorway, an excited look on her face. Maggie trudged inside, knowing full well that she wouldn't want any details left out of her trip. A/N: Aaaand that's it. I know you were probably expecting Terry to be in this chapter, but come on! Maggie ain't got no friends! :( Terry will be back in the next chapter though, so don't worry. Plus, believe it or not, this chapter actually served a purpose :O Rather than being a pointless, silly filler chapter, Danny and Rachel do actually help progress the story (omg!) as you will see in the next few chapters. I updated early because I'll be too busy to do this tomorrow, so enjoy :D Any typos or screw-ups, just tell me! 'Till next time![Chapter 8] A/N: In THIS chapter: Filkins comes back, and Maggie has to deal. Disclaimer: I do not own Drillbit Taylor. Chapter 8: Resume~ After a week of no Filkins, Maggie knew her 'vacation' was coming to an end. When she sat next to Rachel on the bus the following Monday, it was impossible not to notice the black Mustang speeding ahead of them on the way to school. Trying to ignore the slight dread she suddenly felt, Maggie turned her attention to Rachel, who was talking about something funny her cat did, though found herself focusing less on the words and more on her mouth as it was moving so furiously. When the bus stopped in front of the school to drop them off, she spotted Filkins standing by his car, showing Ronnie what seemed to be a sword. She had heard rumors about Filkins using a katana, but she didn't think they were true. She wondered if his black eye was gone. It probably was, otherwise why wait an entire week before coming back? Thinking of moving closer to get a better look but deciding against it, Maggie trotted off to class. For once, she arrived at History before Terry. She had been idly playing with the tendrils of her hair when he walked in. He didn't look at her as he made his way to his seat, his usual 'tough guy' persona in place. So that was how it was going to be. She knew things would be different once he came back, and in her week of reprieve she let her mind wander to the possible changes she would face now, if any. And somehow she knew it would end up being something like this: He would act as if nothing happened (even though they both knew this was untrue) and she would, too. They would both go about their daily routines, same as before, and ignore the elephant in the room. Or hippo. Or maybe a rhino, or some other large animal. But much like using whiteout on a misspelled word (accidental, but forever permanent), it didn't change the fact that it was still there, whatever 'it' was. She knew it would always be different between them (if only on a subconscious level), even if it appeared as if nothing had changed to everyone else. It would be their little secret. He wouldn't say anything, and neither would she. Though she still wondered if he would be less mean to her. She knew it was absolutely silly - outrageous, even - to think that he would stop messing with her completely. But she still hoped that helping him that night had made him at least think. I mean surely it counted for something - She winced as Terry pulled her hair. Hard. This changes nothing, he seemed to say . Nope. Still the same. Interestingly enough, Maggie experienced no further harassment from Filkins. Which, to say the least, surprised her. This, however, could only lead to something big, something more sinister. Or something. Lunch came by and Maggie sat with Danny and Rachel as usual, but she couldn't contribute much to the conversation because she was so on guard for Terry, expecting the worst. She was able to calm down when she spotted him a few tables away, sitting with Ronnie - but where was Alexandria? Deciding to forget about it (for now), Maggie turned her attention back to her uneaten lunch. When Maggie went by the library to set up after school, Terry was already there waiting for her. He was in his usual seat, in his usual position - sitting backwards in his chair, arms resting on the back - seeming irritated but bored. He didn't seem to notice her presence, or maybe he just didn't acknowledge her. Maggie walked up to him, sitting down in her seat. She wasn't sure what to expect from him as she pulled out the textbooks and scrap paper and pens. She knew what was agreed upon , but she hadn't expected him to follow through. No, she expected him to twist her words around, to fidget and wriggle and bend, until he could get out of their deal completely. But you never know. Maybe he was serious about this. But then again... She needed to test the waters. Maggie didn't want to be the one to have to speak first, but she knew Filkins wasn't about to oblige her any time soon. \"Okay, you ready?\" She asked, looking at him. He turned his head lazily to look at her. \"Yep. Explain away,\" he sighed, gesturing towards the textbook. She didn't allow herself to be surprised at his willingness - he still had plenty of time to zone out. As she showed him how to do various problems in the textbook examples, she became inwardly surprised to find that he was actually paying attention. He would even ask a question when he 'didn't know what the hell she was talking about', and his frustrated outbursts were completely overlooked by Maggie, who was so blown away by the fact that he was even listening to her that she calmly (though happily) tried to explain in better detail what he was stuck on. It felt as though this were a temporary miracle and that she only had a small window of time before his brain capacity shut down again, possibly forever. As they say, a mind is a terrible thing to waste, so Maggie worked as quickly and clearly and painlessly as possible with Terry, which ended up being 2 hours and 7 minutes. \"Alright, I think I'm done...\" Terry sighed tiredly, leaning away from the table and stretching. \"Quitting so soon?\" Maggie joked. He gave her a look. \" No , I just need to recover from the mindrape you gave me,\" he replied smartly, resting in his seat. Maggie sighed, tired herself. \"Whatever,\" she muttered, putting everything away. Filkins just smirked boredly at her. Once she put everything away, Maggie picked up her bag and began walking out of the room, pausing to look back at Filkins, who was still in his seat. \"You gonna show up tomorrow?\" She asked, curious. Terry put his hands behind his head. \"Bitch, please, I'll be here.\" She smiled, rolling her eyes to cover up the elation and utter relief she felt at the last part of his answer. She turned around and left. In the 2 weeks that followed Terry showed drastic improvement in his math skills. By the end of the first week - the first! - Maggie was able to make up a sheet of example problems and have him solve them - and get them right! Well okay, not all of them, but most. And since they were actually doing something instead of sitting there being frustrated with each other, their relationship (if you could even call it that) began to improve. He had, over time, stopped messing with her during classes, though he still tugged her hair. At first she was grateful, but then she noticed he had started to mess with Emmit and his friends (Wade, especially) more often, being much more brutal with them than he had ever been with her. She felt terrible, and she knew that something had to be done. She had been on her way to the restroom one day when she saw Wade and Ryan coming out of the boy's side with wet spots on their pants. She knew who it was even before she had heard the howling laughter coming from inside the men's room. This angered Maggie greatly. It made her blood boil and her veins run hot, but she kept silent. Now wasn't the time. For the time being, all she could do was assess the damage. During the time-consuming weeks that she had been spending on Filkins, Maggie hadn't been able to spend much time with Rachel...oh fine, and Danny, too. The only time she really saw them was at lunch. Rachel had started riding with Danny to school, so she didn't see her on the bus anymore, and the hours she would spend tutoring Terry meant she couldn't really go out with them after class, and they were both busy on the weekends. Despite all these things, however, their relationship didn't really suffer. Rachel would still text her like crazy (though Maggie's replies became less frequent when Terry got annoyed, stuffed her phone in his pocket and told her to focus) and she would still call. Maggie was thankful to have her as a friend. Unfortunately for her, everything was going so well and perfect at the moment that Maggie knew it had to be close to its end. And she was right. She just didn't know when. A/N: Yep. It's all downhill from here :P The reason I keep mentioning Alexandria is because I'm thinking about making a RonniexOC story. Even though I don't actually have anything written for them, I've thought about it heavily during the time it took me to write this. SO, I just figured I might as well set the groundwork for their relationship in case I ever decide to get back to it. You can tell me your thoughts if you want. Oh, and Danny will serve a very special purpose in the next chapter, *evil snicker* 'Til next time![Chapter 9] A/N: I am posting early because I have a (somewhat) important question for any and everyone who reads this, which can be found in the bottom Author's Notes. In THIS chapter: Maggie meets her new 'teachers', Maggie does the math, Danny gets into some trouble, Rachel comes to a realization, Maggie gets sick, and Terry passes. Disclaimer: I do not own Drillbit Taylor. Chapter 9: Pass~ It all happened on a Friday. It started out normal, of course, like most days do. Maggie had gotten up, got dressed, eaten a good breakfast, brushed her teeth, and rode the bus to school. She thought something was 'off' when she noticed her History teacher had been replaced. Her 'new' teacher was some fat guy with a beard and long hair. He looked like a hillbilly. His looks, however, weren't what made Maggie suspicious of him. It was his teaching method, if you could call it that. For a history teacher, he didn't know much about history. He took 2 minutes talking about the Civil War, then 5 minutes talking about Marilyn Monroe, and then asked how they were related. How are you supposed to answer something like that?! To top it all off, Maggie had (as well as the rest of the class) witnessed him flirting with one of the students. Blatantly, openly flirting! Needless to say, she was glad when the bell rang. Her other classes weren't much different. Nearly all of her teachers had been replaced at some point, even Ms. Zachey. And they were shady, too. Especially the blond one. Maggie had seen him around campus talking with Ryan and Wade, and he seemed as though he had it in for Filkins and Ronnie. She wondered what the connection was. The blond one (Mr. Taylor, as she had later come to learn) had 'filled in' for just about every class Maggie had. Today, he was substituting for their gym teacher. It was by far the easiest gym class she had ever had. Mr. Taylor only made them do 2 laps, 5 pushups, 10 situps, and a quick game of dodge ball before he made them sit back down. At this point, Mr. Taylor announced that he was going to 'demonstrate new exercises'. \"Okay, you little rugrats, I'm gonna need some volunteers,\" he shouted across the vast space. \"Okay, let's see...\" As he began to pick said 'volunteers', Maggie speculated that he must have had someone (or someones) in particular in mind, as he would point to a few random students, only to change his mind on each one. \"Okay, you, you, you...no, not you...you can sit back down...you,\" he pointed at Maggie. \"Nah, you're too damn cute...\" he moved on to the next would-be volunteer. Maggie turned around to give Rachel a 'what-the-heck' look, only to find she was already staring at her, eyebrows rising up and down suggestively. Oh, no. Not her too. It seemed like anyone who didn't have a crush on Filkins had a crush on Mr. Taylor, and it was really starting to annoy her. Maggie gave her an 'are-you-crazy' look before turning back around. After many minutes of deliberation, Mr. Taylor ended up choosing Ronnie and Filkins, but Maggie had a feeling this was no coincidence. Her feeling was proven correct when said boys were put through the workout of their lives. Maggie and the rest of the students sat back for nearly an hour watching Mr. Taylor make Filkins and Ronnie do as many squats, crunches, lifting, medicine-ball-throwing, laps, and rock-climbing exercises as their muscles would allow. Less than halfway through they were both sweating so much it looked like they had just come inside from a rainstorm. Maggie looked behind her to see Rachel wiggling her eyebrows suggestively at her (again) and giggling. Maggie just rolled her eyes and looked back to Terry and Ronnie. Sweaty guys were so gross... Lunch was the most normal thing that happened that day. Maggie moved through the line, got her food, and sat with Rachel. Danny wasn't there. Rachel explained that he got detention for 'daydreaming' in class. Must have been one of the 'new' teachers. As Maggie ate her food she was pleasantly surprised to find that it was still the same; same taste, same texture, same consistency. 'At least the lunch lady hasn't changed,' she mused to herself. As Rachel rambled on about Mr. Taylor and how there was totally something going on between him and Ms. Zachey, Maggie caught a glimpse of Ronnie and Terry making their way to another student's (soon to be theirs) table. They looked like they were back to normal, though they were definitely worn out. 'And grumpy,' thought Maggie as she witnessed Filkins practically throw a kid out of his seat as he and Ronnie took their table. Maggie thought about everything that had been going on today. The 'new' teachers, the 'talk' that Mr. Taylor had with Ryan and Wade just before school, the intense 'workout' Filkins and Ronnie had been given by Mr. Taylor, and the fact that all of the substitutes started showing up only after Mr. Taylor. Everything seemed to center around him... Maggie did the math: Ryan and Wade get bullied by Filkins and Ronnie, Mr. Taylor shows up and discreetly thwarts any further attempts to bully Ryan and Wade, other teachers start showing up... She could only come to the conclusion that Wade and Ryan had made some kind of deal with 'Mr. Taylor'. She didn't know how deep it went, but if you payed any attention like Maggie did, it was obvious that they were in cahoots together. Maggie was so wrapped up in the Taylor Conspiracy that she didn't notice that Rachel was talking to her. \"Are you listening?\" Maggie jerked her head up. \"Huh? I'm sorry, what?\" Rachel's attempt at being stern melted away into a giggle. \"I SAID, what did you think of Mr. Taylor? Pretty cute, huh?\" ...Was she seriously asking that question? \"Um...yeah, sure I guess.\" Rachel gasped, shocked. \"You guess?! Oh, come ON, Maggie! That blond hair, those eyes...\" \"That nose ...\" Maggie added, taking a sip of her juice box. Rachel gave her a look. \"...That was mean.\" \"Well, it's true!\" Maggie defended. Rachel rolled her eyes. \"Oh, whatever.\" The lunch bell rang. \"Look, I'll see you after school, okay?\" Said Rachel, getting up to take her tray in. \"Actually, I have studying with Filkins again tonight.\" Maggie replied, getting up as well. She paused at the look on Rachel's face. \"It's the last one! I promise!\" Her friend merely sighed. \"Okay. Well no matter. I'll just text you until your eyes fall out of your head!\" She gave a lighthearted laugh. Maggie smiled. \"Yeah,\" she laughed, and they both made their way to their classes. When Maggie had finished with her classes, she headed for the library, dealing with Rachel's bombardment of texts as best she could on the way. There was someone sitting at their usual spot when she got there. Normally she would have just moved to another table, but Terry had a psychological need to sit at that particular one. She speculated he had OCD... Maggie walked up to ask them to kindly move - it was an emo that occupied their spot - but as she got closer she found there was no need. He saw her coming and almost immediately rose from his seat, and, wordlessly, sulked off to somewhere else. At first she was surprised and just thought that he was done using the table, but when she thought about it she realized that he moved because of another reason entirely. He was scared of her. She knew that it was common knowledge to everyone else that she and Filkins frequented the library together, at this particular table, in these particular seats, at this particular time, but she assumed that it was also common knowledge that she was there against her will; she was being forced to do this! She wasn't friends with Filkins! She wasn't like him! And she certainly wasn't a bully! I mean, sure, she had noticed that people tended to stay away from her even more than they already did, she occasionally got the evil eye or the dirty stare, and she definitely wasn't making any more friends, but... Crap. Maggie sat down - ew, the seat was warm - and thought about what all of this really meant. If she wasn't mistaken (and she highly doubted she was) then the reason people were avoiding her (and even scared of her) was because of all of the time she was spending with Terry. The more she thought about it, the more it made sense. No one but Filkins had ever messed with her. Sure, Ronnie had pitched in that one time on the first day of school, but she thought that he quit razzing her because he was spending more time with Alexandria. Now she realized it was probably because Terry had told him not to. It was one of those sick situations where no one but the top dog could mess with the unfortunate victim they've 'claimed', whoever that may be. Now she was mad. She wasn't gonna lie, she was kinda sorta starting to enjoy Filkins' company, but if being 'kinda sorta friends' with him meant never being able to go near anyone for the rest of her school-life (save for Rachel and Danny) then forget that! She was gonna have to put a stop to this. Break it off, kill the switch, nip it in the bud, whatever. But if she really wanted to put a stop to the ridiculously silly idea that she was 'off limits' or 'untouchable' to anyone but him, she was going to have to quit hanging around him. Luckily for her, that shouldn't be too hard since this was their last tutoring session (Terry had a test coming up). Maggie began getting everything out. As she was angrily putting the pens on the table she noticed a friendly face enter the library. Danny. She smiled at him, some of the anger melting away, thinking that maybe she could get through the rest of the day without a hitch. Up until she noticed that he intended to come up and sit with her. \"Hey, whatcha doin'?\" He asked smoothly, pulling out Terry's chair and angling it towards her. Oh, no. He could not be here. Not now. Not when Terry was practically just around the corner. \"Oh, um...look, now's not a really good time, so-\" \"No biggie, I won't be long.\" \"Well, no- it's just that-\" \"Look. I got somethin' I've been meanin' to say-\" \"No, you don't understand-\" \"So let me just get it off my chest, and I'll be out of your hair. 'Kay?\" This wasn't good. Terry would be here any second, she just knew it. But she also knew that Danny probably wasn't going to leave until he said whatever it was that he wanted to say. At a standstill, Maggie visibly struggled with herself for a moment before making her decision. \"Okay, what is it?\" She said hurriedly. Danny took a deep breath. \"Okay,\" he breathed, leaning closer. Oh, no. This was it. He was asking her out. He was going to ask her out. Just like Rachel said. Dangit. But maybe she was wrong. Maybe it was something else entirely. \"I know we haven't really spent a whole lotta time together,\" Danny began. Or maybe not. Maggie wanted to lean away, to rewind so that she could pick a different course of action, but it was too late. \"But, I still really like you and I think you're pretty cool,\" he paused, scratching the back of his head. \"I guess, what I'm basically trying to say is...\" Great, now she was gonna have to deal with the guilt of rejecting him... Detecting movement in her periphery, Maggie looked to her right, just in time to see Filkins entering the library. And he didn't look happy. She immediately turned back to Danny. He needed to leave. His confession would have to wait. Just as he began to speak, Maggie cut him off. \"You need to leave.\" Danny stared at her for a moment, at a loss for words. \"Uh...what?\" She wasted no time in replying. \"You need to get out of here. Now, go!\" Filkins was stalking up to them now. Panicking, Maggie tried to usher Danny out of his seat, but to no avail. \"Who the hell are you?\" Terry demanded, totally ignoring Maggie. Danny finally acknowledged Filkins, his utter obliviousness to his clearly pissed off behavior throwing Maggie for a loop. \"Oh hey, I'm Danny.\" He greeted in a laidback tone, holding out a hand for him to shake. And it all went downhill from there. Terry had had a really bad day. He had banged his car up pretty good chasing those Siamese Queers (Ryan and Wade) so he had to ride to school with Ronnie and his mom, he had been humiliated in gym class, he had a pounding headache, some asshole took the last chocolate pudding at lunch, and all he had to look forward to at the end of the day was Maggie . So yeah, he was kinda pissed when he saw some skater punk sitting in his seat; talking to Maggie, nonetheless! He couldn't believe the gall this kid had, being so laidback and civil. He obviously didn't get the message he was trying to send. Well. He'd just have to be more clear. \"Get the hell outta my chair.\" He ordered. \"Woah, bro. All you had to do was ask.\" Said 'Danny' as he got out of his seat. \"There you go,\" he said, gesturing towards his spot. Filkins scoffed, shoving past him with his shoulder. \"So Maggie, like I was saying...\" Was this punk serious? Was he just born with the inability to take a hint or something? Terry turned back around to give him a death glare, but apparently he was too focused on Maggie to notice. \"You wanna go out sometime?\" Danny finished. That was it. Terry grabbed Danny by the shoulder and shoved him away. \"Did you not hear me when I said get out?\" He bit out harshly. Danny copped a laugh. \"You...didn't say get out...\" Terry was getting more annoyed by the second. \"I'm saying it now: leave .\" He snarled. He heard Maggie get up behind him. \"I'll give you my answer Monday,\" she told Danny. Terry whirled around to face her, disbelief written on his face. \"You're not actually considering going out with this retard, are you?!\" \"So what if I am?\" She said defiantly, suddenly angry with him. He scoffed a laugh. \"He's a...\" he struggled to find the right word, \" dweeb! What do you mean 'so what'?\" \"Well at least he's nice to me.\" She countered. Terry forcefully grabbed her by the arm, and they glared at each other. \"Hey, leave her alone!\" Danny stepped in, grabbing Terry's shoulder and spinning him back around to face him. Now he was really mad. Finally snapping, Terry glared at him for a moment. And then proceeded in promptly smashing his face in. Maggie could hardly believe her eyes. What was his problem!? Why was he acting this way? Why was a raven like a writing desk?! She was so surprised by the sudden outburst of violence that all she could really do was stand there. Even more surprising, Danny fought back, something she just couldn't picture his non-confrontational self doing before this point. She watched on in utter shock as Danny and Filkins wrestled to the floor of the library, beating the snot out of each other...well, trying to, on Danny's part. The library was so quiet and the fight was so loud it felt like they were in an opera house, with every little sound amplifying and reverberating off the walls, practically broadcasting to the entire student body: 'Hey, everybody! There's a fight at the library!' Maggie was so distraught over the scene before her. She felt so many things at once: she was mad at Filkins for being an ass, she was sad for Danny because he had gone through all of that trouble only to have his face punched in, and she was furious with herself for letting things go this far. She wanted them to stop, but she knew they were so blinded with rage (well, Terry was) that her yells would fall on deaf ears, and she wasn't stupid enough to try and break them apart. She had seen what happened to a chick that tried that at her old school, and it wasn't pretty. So in the end, Maggie just stood there, feeling helpless. She looked to the librarian, who ran out of the room, hopefully to get the principal and not to hand in her resignation form. A crowd had gathered at the entrance, watching in horror, shock, amusement, and delight. Maggie spotted Rachel, who was looking from Danny to her in shock and confusion. Finally, principal Doppler arrived with 2 other teachers - along with the librarian - in tow. With some difficulty they pulled Filkins off of Danny, and Maggie ran up to help Danny to his feet. She locked eyes with Filkins as they dragged him away. It was one of the few moments in her life that seemed to happen in slow motion, and she didn't understand a millisecond of it. She spent the entire weekend trying to figure out what on earth had just happened. Rachel called her Saturday and asked her to tell her every possible detail she could remember. But everything had happened so fast...no. That was no excuse. She could remember. She just didn't want to. When she finished spilling her guts, Rachel was silent, something she normally wasn't. Maggie started to check the phone chord to see if the line had been severed, when Rachel suddenly gasped. Guess she was just piecing everything together. \"Ohmygosh...\" she said, as if she had just had an epiphany. Okay, Maggie was confused. \"What?\" She asked. \"He likes you.\" Rachel replied. \"Who, Danny? Yeah, we went over that-\" \"No! Terry! Terry likes you, ya dummy!\" Say what, now? \"No he doesn't.\" \"Yes he does! Ooooh my GOSH, I cannot be-LIEVE I didn't see this before!\" \"You can't be serious.\" \"No, really! That's why he teases you all the time!\" \"Teasing? You call pulling and pushing and shoving and verbal abuse teasing?\" \"Oh, come on, when's the last time he's physically hurt you?\" Yesterday. \"...Never mind. Look, it's just a way for him to show how intense his feelings are.\" Rachel said as a matter of factly. \"...You're disgusting.\" Maggie said, scrunching her nose. \"Just you wait,\" Rachel laughed. \"He'll be head-over-heels for you by the end of this year!\" \"Whatever.\" Muttered Maggie doubtfully. Rachel laughed again. \"I gotta go. Bye Mags!\" \"Bye.\" \"Oh, and by the way; I know all about you and Danny. You owe me a pudding.\" Click. ...What?! 'Danny must have told her,' she thought. Sigh... When Maggie came back to school on Monday, everything felt...awkward. Everyone seemed to be on the hush-hush, even the teachers. In fact, pretty much everyone was acting as if nothing had happened. Weird. She was glad to see Danny's face was okay. For the most part. He (amazingly) didn't have a black eye or broken bone, just a bunch of cuts and scrapes and bruises. Considering the fact that, from where she was standing, it sounded like Terry was beating him to a pulp, she found it astounding that he was even able to come into school the next day. Danny just laughed and said it sounded a lot worse than it felt, but Maggie had her doubts. She didn't see Filkins at all that day, but truthfully, she didn't want to. When school let out and Danny casually asked for her answer, Maggie was at a loss, but only for a second. She thought about saying yes in that second, if only because she felt sorry for him after going through all that trouble to ask her, but she was no liar, and Danny was no sensitive crybaby. She said no. He took it very lightly, saying it was perfectly fine and everything was cool, and Maggie knew he was telling the truth. She smiled, and so did he. And all was well again. For the most part. Maggie stayed home Tuesday. Her mother had called the school to say she was sick. It was true. She didn't know how or when, but she got sick. 'Probably that bathroom stall,' she speculated as she sneezed all over her phone. Rachel had been texting her all day. How she accomplished this during class, she would never know. She was better the next day. 'Just a bug,' her mother had told her. She was welcomed back with overly eager arms Wednesday as she was nearly crushed by Rachel's welcome-back hug. Filkins wasn't there that day either. She wasn't mad at him anymore, only curious. After school, Maggie went to the principal's office. Not because she was in trouble, but because she just had to know about Terry. The unmistakable fire of curiosity was burning her insides, and she was just itching to douse it. It really didn't matter to her either way; he could do whatever he wanted for all she cared. But it was kind of like a question with no answer. We all know there is no real reason why a raven is like a writing desk, but we still wonder; Why is a raven like a writing desk? Like so, we all know there is no real reason as to why Terry is a total ass, but the decent people of the world with a sympathetic ear still wonder: why is Terry an ass? Why is he constantly missing school? Where could he possibly have to go that's worthwhile? And so we wrack and search and pick our brains until we can come up with our own answers. Luckily, Maggie wouldn't have to go through any of this, as the answer to her question was just behind the door she was currently opening. \"Miss Lovelace! What brings you here?\" Principal Doppler asked, smiling as he propped his elbows on his desk. Maggie wasn't one to beat around the bush. \"What happened to Terry?\" She asked, a bit too bluntly. \"You mean Mr. Filkins?\" Judging by his tone, Maggie realized that she needed to switch tactics. Softening her expression, she asked politely as she could, \"Yes, do you know what happened to him? I haven't seen him since Friday.\" Maybe he got suspended. That would be nice. But, unfortunately, far too good to be true. \"Terry is...a troubled young man,\" Doppler replied, straightening the plaque on his desk. Hey, maybe it wasn't too good to be true. \"But, as much as he deserved to be suspended, we did have a deal.\" Never mind. \"What do you mean?\" Maggie asked, tone innocent. She was honestly wondering how many loads of utter bull he had to shovel to get out of this one. \"Well, we both agreed that if he could get his test scores up, he was off the hook. You were there, don't you remember?\" Oh. ...Wait. There was a test on Tuesday. Maggie was sick. She missed that test. Dangit. \"Soooo, what are you saying?\" Maggie asked warily. Doppler lifted his head to look at her, eyebrows raised. \"Terry took his math test yesterday.\" \"...And?\" \"He passed.\" A/N: Yep, Terry passed. Thanks to Maggie's supreme tutelage, he was able to squeak by into yet another school year. I finally brought in some characters from the original movie plotline. I know it's a bit late for that, but oh well. I'm going to continue following along the basic story, going all the way up to the party :D You can't really tell by the way this chapter ended, but Maggie is not happy. You'll see what I mean in the next chapter. It has been brought to my attention that some would prefer if I just typed up the rest of the story and did a batch post, so it'll be finished faster and you can just read to your heart's content. If others also think I should do this, I will. It'll just take me a while before I can post the whole thing XD Otherwise, I'll just continue the way I have been :) Any questions or comments, just ask in a review or pm or whatever. 'Till next time.[Chapter 10] A/N: In THIS chapter: Maggie gets mad, has a heart-to-heart talk with her mom, and starts to see things a little differently. Disclaimer: I do not own Drillbit Taylor. Chapter 10: Blind~ He passed? Filkins passed? And he didn't even bother to tell her?! That...that...that asshole! And after all they'd been through! After Doppler had told her this interesting bit of information, Maggie left. It would have seemed silly to be mad over something like this to an outside observer, but it was perfectly appropriate to Maggie. So he was just going to avoid her now? Was that it? Rough up her friend and then leave? Never talk to her again? She at least wanted an apology! As far as she was concerned, Terry was the one acting like the child, not her . The more she thought about it the angrier she got. Man, people like that really burned her insides! Maggie wasn't one to just give away friendship willy-nilly, and for him to come along and just leave her high and dry, leave her hanging, kick her to the curb, drop her like a hot tamale, cut her loose, forget about her- Wait. Deep breaths. Calm down. Breathe... Maggie huffed in annoyance. She should be happy, really. After all, he did beat up Danny. She shouldn't want to see him ever again. Not after that. Like, ever. At all. For the rest of her life. But, as much as she hated to admit it, she did want to see him again. Or at least be able to talk to him. Sure, she was angry, but most of all she was disappointed. Things were going so well - SO well! - and he had to go and screw it all up. It wasn't like she hadn't seen this coming, she supposed. She knew she and Terry weren't exactly 'friends' (when did she start calling him by his first name?) but she liked to think that they were getting along. ...Well...okay. More than just getting along. By now she would have liked to consider him a friend. Would being the key word. Now, after all that crap he pulled yesterday at the library - beating up her friend, being a total ass in general - she pretty much threw that fantasy out the window. She almost felt sorry for him when she thought more deeply about it. Maybe it wasn't really his fault. Maybe it was just a part of who he was, and there was nothing she or anyone else could do to help it. Like, maybe he wanted to be good, to make friends, but there was just something in his DNA that made it impossible for him to do so. Kind of like a natural born killer. Or someone who tried to do good, but no matter what they did, things would never work out for them. Or something. Then again, those people didn't usually enjoy the torment they put others through. Toss that idea. No, Maggie decided, he was just an asshole. A jerk. A player. A tool. He was just one of those types of people that loved to hurt and annoy and torture people. He would never have friends, and he would never want them. And there was simply nothing that could be done about that. Maggie sighed. How could she let this happen? I mean seriously? On the car ride home, it only took about 3 minutes for her mom to shut off the radio, pull off to the side of the road, and ask her what her deal was. Being the antisocial girl that she was, Maggie resisted in spilling any more beans than she already had, but this was her mom. Not some I-wanna-be-your-friend-so-I-can-stab-you-in-the-back Terry . So she spilled. Might as well. She only had a few beans left, anyway. \"Sigh, okay. You know that guy at my school? The one who messes with me all the time?\" Maggie asked. Her mother thought for a second. \"...The asshole?\" \"Yeah, him.\" Maggie confirmed. \"Well, I helped him pass his math test and-\" \"Wait, wait, wait...you mean to tell me you helped this weasel? Why?!\" \"The principal told me to help him,\" she explained. \"Anyway, it seemed like we were getting along-\" \"Wait.\" Her mother interrupted once more. \"You mean to tell me that you actually started to consider him a friend? You didn't crush him?\" Maggie blinked. \"Well no, but-\" \" No! See, I told you never to do that!\" Claire whined. \"GAH, you're no help at all!\" Maggie threw her hands up. They had been silent a few minutes when her mother said, \"Do you like him?\" The question caused Maggie's jaw to drop to the floor. The very notion made her lurch in her seat. The idea! The audacity of some people! \"Wha- what? NO!\" Claire sighed. \"I had a feeling this would happen,\" she chuckled. Maggie couldn't believe what she was hearing. \"Are you crazy?! That's insane!\" \"Aw, don't give me that crap,\" her mother waved her off. \"I can see it in your eyes.\" She started the engine back up. She began to sing. \"Maggie's got a boyfriend...\" \"Shut up,\" Maggie demanded. \"Denial is the first step to love.\" \"Denial's the first step to everything,\" she muttered. Her mother just laughed as she got back on the road. Maggie loved her mother, but sometimes, she had it all wrong... The only time Maggie saw Filkins after the 'library incident' was in class. It was the only place he couldn't avoid her. Not that it mattered, though. It wasn't like she could talk to him or give him a piece of her mind unless they both showed up early, which Maggie was never able to do. And man, it was so annoying hearing everyone talk about how much 'chemistry' there was between them! First Rachel, and then her mom...even principal Doppler made a comment about it! Even Danny! Her last hope! After the library fiasco, rumors started to circulate around school. Before she could really even comprehend what was going on, Maggie became the victim of gossip. The few people that had witnessed what had happened that day were probably to blame; sure, they had seen the fight, but they didn't know the whole story. And so, in a matter of not weeks, not days, but hours after Terry had punched Danny, the entire school had assumed it was over a girl. In this case, Maggie. Maggie had nothing against these people for thinking the way they did (after all, everyone has an opinion) but it truly amazed her how so many people could see something that just wasn't there. ...But then again, maybe she was the blind one... Nah. A/N: I know this is kind of a short chapter, but don't worry. They'll get longer in the next couple of chapters. Now that I've thought about it I think I will do a batch post. It'll take a while to type everything up, but once I do I can just post it all at once, and then you won't have to go back and re-read everything in order to understand what's going on XD I think that once I have all of the chapters finished I'm gonna post a chapter a day. Or maybe not, I'm still deciding. Gah, I don't know what I want! (╯°A°）╯︵ ┻━┻ 'Till next time. 😃[Chapter 11] A/N: In THIS chapter: Maggie has to deal with meddlesome rumors, and develops a theory. Disclaimer: I do not own Drillbit Taylor. Chapter 11: Theory~ With all the talking that was going on, it was hard for Maggie to keep her head straight. 'Filkins' this, and 'Maggie' that. She almost believed the rumors herself. Thankfully, Rachel respected her and shut up about it during lunch. It didn't stop her from trying to steer the conversation in that direction every now and then, though. Danny was laidback as usual, and he wasn't one for gossip, so she didn't have to worry about him. However, as the weeks progressed, Maggie became paranoid. She was almost certain that every whisper, every text, every note passed, every giggle was about her, the girl Filkins was sweet on. It was very annoying. Maggie finally snapped on the last day of October. At lunch, nonetheless. Slamming her juice box on the table, she asked Rachel, \"What is it that makes everyone think that we belong together? It's the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard!\" Rachel seemed almost happy with this outburst, like she was finally allowed to talk about the one big secret that she promised never to tell. \"Well, you know, it's just...obvious, is all.\" She replied, trying to sound indifferent as she sipped from her straw. Maggie made a loud 'tsk', resting her fist on her chin and knitting her brows in thought. \"...Like what?\" She asked, unintentionally snapping at her friend. \"Oh, you know...boys tease girls they like...they mess with their hair...they go out of their way to spend time with them...let's see, what else...oh! And they talk to them! Lots and lots of talking.\" She winked. Maggie couldn't believe this. She was taking everything out of context! Tease? Try bully . Mess with hair? Try pulling. Painfully. And spending time with them? Yeah, so he could make it into the next grade! ...Or, you know, make it out of school...never mind. Maggie looked to Danny for help. \"It's true.\" He said, taking Rachel's side. Maggie banged her head on the table. \"Whatever...\" Rachel patted her shoulder. \"We haven't even been spending any time together for 2 whole weeks,\" Maggie protested, but she knew - with Rachel's way of thinking - she was grasping at straws. \"Cheer up, Mags! All couples go through this. Your time apart just means that you're both trying to sort out your feelings for each other.\" Was that supposed to make her feel better? \"Everyone knows avoidance is the 3rd step in love!\" Rachel continued. \"What's the second?\" Maggie asked, her voice muffled by the table. \"Pig-headedness.\" Rachel replied. Maggie grumbled as she continued to eat her meal. The bell rang. \"I really don't think you know what you're talking about...\" Maggie shook her head as she got up. \"And I think you should pay more attention.\" Rachel shot back smugly, following suit. \"Pfft. Fine! I will! And I guarantee you I won't find anything!\" \"Alright, good!\" \"Yeah!\" \"Okay!\" \"Fine!\" \"See you after class!\" \"You too!\" Maggie sat with Danny after school, who was waiting for Rachel on the entrance steps. She playfully nudged his shoulder. \"I can't believe you sided with Rachel .\" She said lightheartedly. Danny tilted his head from side to side, pondering his answer. \"Yeah, well...not everyone would kick the shit outta someone for sitting next to their friend -girl.\" He said easily. \"Speaking of which, I don't wanna get in trouble...\" he scooted away from her. Maggie rolled her eyes. \"Oh, stop it, you sound like Rachel.\" Danny chuckled. \"No, you sound like Rachel. 'Oh, stop it! '\" They laughed. \"...You just caught him on a bad day, you know.\" She said after a few moments of silence. Danny scoffed. \" Every day's a bad day with him. And the fact that you can even tell the difference says a lot.\" He implied, touching her shoulder and giving her a funny look. Maggie gave a tight-lipped smile, trying to contain the laugh that threatened to escape her mouth. \"A lot ,\" he said again, hoping for a reaction. She pursed her lips. \"A LOT !\" He repeated, adding a goofy look. She couldn't take it anymore. Maggie burst into a fit of laughter, along with Danny. \"Okay, okay, so it's not entirely crazy to think that he...we...you know. But what if I liked someone else? What if I liked you, for example. What would you say?\" She asked, traces of laughter still evident in her voice. Danny looked out at the parking lot, crossing his hands behind his head. \"I would say...go for it... and that you have excellent taste.\" He replied, turning his head to give her a dashingly handsome expression. She laughed again. \"Okay. What if I liked Filkins?\" \"I would say be careful but go for it.\" \"What if I liked Emmit?\" \"I would say good luck explaining the age-difference to your parents but go for it.\" \"Ronnie?\" \"I would say I hope he doesn't crush you but go for it.\" \"David?\" \"Who, the emo? Sure, if you're up for running a 24/7 suicide hotline.\" \"Ryan?\" \"Go for it.\" \"Wade?\" \"Go for it.\" \"Jacob?\" \"Okay, now we're just getting weird.\" They laughed again. \"Hey guys, whatcha doin'?\" Rachel chimed in from behind, trotting down the steps to meet them. \"Ah, nothin',\" Danny dismissed. \"Just Maggie's taste in men.\" He finished, smirking at said person. Rachel's face brightened. \"You mean she finally admits that she likes him too?!\" Danny squinted his eyes and held his hand out, tilting it from side to side. \"Eh...hypothetically.\" Her shoulders sagged. \"Oh...well, are you ready?\" Danny stood up. \"Yep. You riding with us, Mags?\" Maggie blinked. \"Oh, um...\" \" Yes , she is , Danny. Is that a problem?\" Rachel cut in, placing her hands on her hips. \"No, I just wanted to make sure-\" \"Make sure what? That you didn't have to move some of your junk out of the way first?\" Rachel challenged. \"Ooh, BURN!\" Danny exclaimed, giving her a high five. \"I'm impressed,\" he complimented, praising her verbal put-down. \"Thank you.\" she smiled brightly. \"Come on, Maggie! We'll make room for you!\" Maggie didn't bother deciphering the strange turn the conversation had just taken. Instead, she unrooted herself from her spot, and followed Rachel to the truck. After being dropped off at her place, Maggie went straight to her room. She did her homework, ate, and got ready for bed. She stayed up half the night just thinking about Rachel's words. 'Pay attention,' she'd said. Pfft. She paid attention. She paid plenty of attention! Just...not to herself. So, that night, Maggie paid attention to everything that had happened between Terry and herself (everything she could remember, anyway), starting with the beginning of the school year. She replayed every look, every shove, every comment, every conversation, every gesture, and every passing in her mind, looking for little things, subtle signs (particularly the ones Rachel had mentioned) that her friend was right and that she, sadly, was wrong. The more she remembered, the more she analyzed, the more she 'paid attention', Maggie came to the unfathomable conclusion that Rachel may have been right. That in a strange, crazy, twisted way, she did in fact know what she was talking about. Maybe Filkins really did like her... Not that it would matter. It wasn't like she liked him. Sure, he was pretty cute, but liking someone solely for their physical features (which they had no control over) was overrated. And yes, she thought he could be pretty funny, in his own sarcastic, ironic, twisted way, and she had to say she was impressed with his conversational (or rather, argumentative) wit; he could hold his own in a fight with words, she'd give him that. And even though she didn't really mind being around him anymore (she blamed principal Doppler for that one), she still couldn't say she liked him...well okay, she could...ah, who was she trying to kid? She did like him. Just...not like that. ...Agh, this was screwing with her head. After considering the various possibilities that this newfound knowledge presented, Maggie formed a fairly sound theory surrounding Filkins. She just had to test it. It wasn't foolproof, but it would definitely work. And she was so going to find out whether he liked her or not, and put an end to all of this nonsense once and for all- \"Honey! Time for bed!\" -tomorrow. She'd find out. One way or another. Tomorrow... A/N: Yet another early, out-of-sync update. I don't expect anyone to remember this, but 'Jacob' was the guy at the skate park back in the chapter 'Intermission' :P Anyway, the next chapter will FINALLY have some MaggiexFilkins interaction! As in, not talking, lol XD IMPORTANT: I have decided that I WILL, INDEED do a batch post. Therefore, I will not be updating for awhile, as I still have to type up 6 more chapters (I've already finished a few) so don't expect an update on Friday. I might, but I doubt it will be that fast. When I'm done perfecting everything, I will post all of the remaining chapters at once so you guys can read straight through without having to worry about forgetting what happened in the last chapter. See you in an estimated (hopefully sooner) 2 weeks :D 'Till next time! 😃[Chapter 12] A/N: Woo, I'm back! 8D I just BARELY made the deadline I set for myself (2 weeks) so I'm happy, lol. You'll probably want to go back and read the last chapter so this all makes sense again, though. Just saying. In THIS chapter: Maggie's tired, and gets to test her theory. Disclaimer: I do not own Drillbit Taylor. Chapter 12: Test~ Maggie was very tired when she woke up the next day, though she couldn't really complain; she had stayed up half the night, after all. By the time she got to school, everything was a blur. But she knew she had groggily gotten out of bed, got dressed, eaten, brushed her teeth and hair, grabbed her book bag, and hopped the bus to get there...at least she thought so. I mean, she didn't really remember...ah, never mind. As Maggie sat in history class, she was only vaguely aware of Filkins behind her. Of course, this meant that she wasn't paying any attention (why did that sound so important?) to the lesson currently being taught. But no matter, it didn't sound too important anyway. She could just copy Rachel's notes if things got really bad. Maggie put all of her energy into staying awake and, when class ended, shifted that energy into feeling happy that lunch was here. She went through the lunch line in a daze, grabbing this and that, not really aware of her surroundings, and somehow found herself seated in between Danny and Rachel. She didn't touch her food, instead opting to sleep on Danny's shoulder until lunch ended. She was jerked awake by Rachel, who was telling her that lunch was over. Probably, anyway. She couldn't really focus on her voice at first. \"Hey, you okay? You've been dead as a tree since you sat down.\" Rachel asked. Maggie rubbed her eyes. \"Trees are alive,\" She mumbled in reply. Rachel rolled her eyes. \"You know what I mean. Anyway, what's up with you?\" Maggie looked at her, still tired. \"I stayed up all night thinking about-\" she stopped, suddenly aware of her mission today. That was it! She remembered what she had to do! \"Okay...thinking about what?\" Rachel questioned after moments of silence. Oh, right. \"Uh, I was thinking about your stupid theory,\" she replied, yawning and getting up. Her friend's face lit up. \"I am sooo proud of you!\" She clapped her hands together. \"But uh, yeah. Like I said, lunch is over, we gotta go, aaaand we'll talk later. Okay?\" \"Okay,\" Maggie agreed, now wide awake. She watched as Rachel practically skipped off to class, Danny not far behind. Now that she remembered why today was so important, Maggie shifted gears. It was time to get serious. The day seemed extra slow for some reason, probably because Maggie was in such a hurry...maybe, she didn't know. She kind of just put herself on auto-pilot for the rest of her classes while she retreated to the back of her mind to think about how she was going to execute her plan, vaguely aware of Terry's lingering presence. Should she just ask? Nah, he'd just deny everything and call her crazy. Should she ask Ronnie? No, he would probably just look at her like she was a weirdo and avoid her, and possibly tell Terry, and that would blow everything. Not good. Maybe she could dig through his locker when no one else was around? Eh, guys didn't keep diaries. Hmm... A sudden idea came to her that was so straightforward, so simple - she daresay it was madness - that it could most definitely work, and that was the important thing. Better than all her other ideas, anyway. She just needed to get him alone. The cogs in her mind began furiously formulating a plan of action so devious, none would see it coming! As her brain whirred at full speed, Maggie inwardly chuckled to herself at the thought of such an innocently oblivious Terry, unaware that she was planning what very well could be his downfall, not 3 feet behind her. This was gonna be good. She looked everywhere. She started with detention (naturally) and ended up wandering out to the parking lot. His car was still there, so he couldn't be far. She would have asked Ronnie, but he was already gone. Plus, judging from the heated conversation she had seen him having earlier that day with Alexandria, he probably wouldn't have been in the mood to talk anyway. So, Maggie ended up wandering the school grounds, checking all the places he could possibly be. No dice. She needed to rest, to think. She began making her way to the library. As she rounded the corner to her destination, she paused in the doorway. There he was! Filkins. His back was to her, and upon further inspection, she noticed something. He was sitting in his chair. The one they used for studying. At their table. She couldn't see his face, but his posture looked almost...depressed? Maggie watched as he scared some kid out of trying to sit in the seat next to him. Her seat... Dangit, Rachel did know what she was talking about. 'Nothing's been proven yet, though,' she reassured herself. She watched as Filkins abruptly got out of his seat, slinking off into a random book aisle. Now was her chance. Being as quiet as she could be, Maggie sauntered up behind the nearest aisle, peeking around the corner to spy Filkins turning a corner. She followed, looking in between the open spaces in between books to make sure he wasn't looking behind him. He made a left, heading for the back. Maggie hid around the corner. She peeked around to catch his profile glaring angrily at the rows of books propped against the wall in front of him. This was just too perfect. It was quiet, there was no one around, they were alone... No time for cold feet now. Ignoring the mild butterflies in her stomach, Maggie emerged from her hiding place, marching up to him. He looked over at her, brows furrowed - in irritation or confusion, she wasn't sure - but he hardly had the time to recognize her, let alone comprehend what was happening, as she cupped his face in her hands (gently, of course) and kissed him. She kept their lips pressed together for 5 agonizingly long seconds before pulling away to gauge his reaction. When she did, she almost wished she hadn't. Filkins' expression was so...warped? His mouth hung open, his eyebrows crinkled, his eyes bulged, and he had backed as far away as he could from her, which happened to be against the book-lined wall behind him. Maggie couldn't tell if he was angry, shocked, disgusted, surprised, or all of the above. So, she waited for him to speak, her cheeks flaming all the while. And waited. And waited. ...Wow. Was he seriously not going to say anything? She gave him one last chance to say something - anything, really - and when he didn't, she rolled her eyes angrily, let out an irritated sigh, and left. A/N: Yes, it finally happened XD It took 12 long chapters but they finally kissed. Lol. We have to deal with the awkward aftermath now, of course, but don't worry, there'll be more to come. Much more ;) 'Till next time. 😃 ...Oh wait. Ha, there's no need for that anymore XD[Chapter 13] A/N: In THIS chapter: Maggie vents, Terry contemplates, Maggie dreads, Terry confronts Maggie, Maggie gets mad, and Terry is too young for all this...I think that's about it :/ Disclaimer: I do not own Drillbit Taylor. Chapter 13: Revert~ After getting home, Maggie called Rachel to vent. She told her everything, from the stalking to the leaving. Every last detail. \"Your theory was wrong. He doesn't like me like that.\" She told her. \"Well, did you think that just maybe he was so shocked he didn't know how to react?\" replied Rachel, ever the optimist. \"I mean, if someone cornered me in a library and kissed me senseless, that's how I would've reacted.\" Maggie sighed. \"Yeah, but you're not a guy.\" \"True, but I still think you came on too strong.\" This really wasn't helping...well, it was, just not in the way she wanted it to. She had called to get all of her frustration out, which she supposed she did, but now she was trying to get her head together, something she couldn't really do with Rachel putting all these random thoughts on the table. She needed to think. \"Uh, look, I gotta go.\" Maggie said, hoping she hadn't inadvertently cut her friend off in the middle of a sentence. \"Okay. Let me know when you get your head together.\" Rachel replied easily. Click. \"Right...\" Maggie said to herself. Filkins lay on his bed, repeatedly tossing his keys into the air. His head was so screwed up right now. Really, he didn't know what to think. I mean... what the hell was that?! Did she just wake up one morning and decide she was gonna scare the shit out of him? Terry thought back to the 'incident'. He only saw her face for a split second, but she looked...determined? Why? 'Maybe it was a dare,' he reasoned. But then again, she didn't seem like the type of person to do that stuff...at least, nothing that drastic. It had to be something else. She had done it on purpose, that much was certain. I mean, how many people 'tripped' and fell on your lips? Really? She hadn't looked too happy, either. Maybe she did it because she was mad at him? But then, why would you kiss someone you were mad at? That just didn't make any sense. But then again, girls were weird, so maybe it did make sense? Gah... Terry stopped tossing his keys. This was the reason he quit hanging around her! She made his head hurt from thinking so damn much... He sighed, resting an arm over his eyes. Come to think of it, all this stuff started happening right after his math test...was she pissed because he quit hanging around her? He would think she'd be happy. I mean, he didn't bully or mess with her anymore. Wasn't that a plus? Er, not that he cared about her happiness or anything. Just saying. Let's see, what else? Filkins mentally replayed everything that had happened in the past week, looking for clues that might explain Maggie's crazy-ass behavior. Of course, he found nothing. What was her problem? Terry thought back to yesterday, just before he had decided to go to the library. On his way out of the men's room, he had overheard a couple of chicks talking - well, gossiping - about some other girl in the women's bathroom. He hadn't paid much attention at first, but he was fairly certain he'd caught something along the lines of this: \"Can you believe her?\" \"I know! What does she think? That he'll stop messing with her if she sleeps with him?\" \"Yeah, I know, right? What a slut. And besides, if anyone deserves to have him, it's me .\" \"Totally. He may be a bully, but he's way too cute for her .\" ...Or something like that. More or less. Anyway, back to the issue at hand. Terry thought about what those girls - more or less - had said. Were they talking about Maggie? He knew rumors had been floating around recently, mostly about him and some other...oh, God. Putting 2 and 2 together, he realized that all of the rumors and gossip over the past few weeks had been about him and Maggie . Terry sat up at this epiphany, the cogs in his brain still turning. Wait. Maggie? And him? Together?! Where the hell did they get that idea? It's not like they'd ever been caught doing anything... 'Tutor sessions,' his brain reminded him. Oh. Right. Damn. Okay, so apparently the entire student body had it in their heads that he and Maggie had the hots for each other...or something. But surely they knew by now that Terry Filkins didn't do girlfriends. Didn't want 'em, didn't need 'em. Too much trouble. Not to mention all the work and upkeep. Just... no . And he could only imagine all the shit that Maggie was going through right now. Whatever reputation she had was surely trashed by now...hey. Wait a second. Was that why she kissed him? To sully his badass reputation by weighing him down with a 'relationship'? But if that were the case, why would she do it in a library? Where no one was around? But it couldn't be anything else. There was no other reason he could think of, so that had to be it. Now he was mad. How dare she! Did she honestly think she could win against him? He could break that pretty face in a second! Wait, did he just say pretty? ...Damnit! Terry got up from his bed, heading outside. He needed some fresh air. Once he got outside, Terry sat on his small concrete porch. His intention was to let all of his anger and frustration pass. So, he sat and waited. For 2 hours. ...Damn, this really wasn't working. Terry, fed up with all this 'fresh air', got up and went back inside to get ready for bed. He didn't want to sound like some stupid little kid, but...damnit, it was all her fault! He wouldn't be in this situation if she hadn't pulled that little stunt in the library. Now he was all confused because of that little...that little... temptress! Oh, that bitch was gonna pay. And he couldn't wait until Monday rolled around. Terry turned out the lights and climbed into bed. He needed a break from all these feelings. He sighed. Chicks didn't make any sense... Maggie lay in bed, trying (and failing) to get some shut eye. Although, seriously, how could she sleep? She had just kissed the high school bully, the 'big bad' of McKinley High, and walked away like it was nothing! Sure, no one was really around to see it, but still; big deal. And she was still trying to make sense of it all. Just as she was about to make her final decision and decide that Filkins just didn't like her that way, Rachel came along and jumbled her way of thinking. Sometimes, Maggie felt like a grown-up trying to put together a 1,000 piece puzzle, and just as she was about to put in the final piece, she would come along and mess everything up. But maybe that was a good thing. Maybe Maggie's linear way of thinking needed scrambled every now and then...eh, never mind. She thought back to the 'incident' and Terry's reaction to it. She supposed that walking up to someone and kissing them out of the blue would startle them. Rachel made sense there. But Maggie thought he would at least say something, like, 'What the hell is your problem?', or, 'Are you crazy?' Or even a simple, 'I don't like you,' would have been nice. Well, not nice, but it would have helped in sorting her thoughts out. And she really didn't want to admit it (although she wouldn't lie if anyone asked) but she was actually kind of disappointed in his reaction. Was she really that repulsive? Certainly not. Maybe Rachel was right, maybe he really did like her and he was just too flabbergasted to say anything. Maybe she had sent him into shock...nah. He'd recover. Though, she had to say, she wasn't looking forward to Monday. I mean, he didn't know what she was doing. For all he knew, she was just trying to humiliate him. That's probably what he thought, too. Bastard. But amidst all this, it wasn't the possibility of impending doom or humiliation from school in 3 days that disturbed Maggie; she could handle all that. It was the fact that she cared - actually, genuinely cared - about what Filkins would say about 'it' to her. She cared about his opinion of her, she cared about what he thought, cared about what he would say. And that scared the crap out of her. Despite everything she did to slow it down, Monday finally came. Maggie was very anxious, but her expression and the way she carried herself gave no hints to such things. She made her way to history class, keeping an eye out for Filkins on the way. When she got there, she saw that his seat was empty. Weird, he was always there before her. She wasn't stupid, though. She knew this wasn't a good sign. She wasn't entirely sure what it meant, but she knew it wasn't good. As Maggie made her way to her seat, a couple of snobby blondes gave her a dirty look. O- kaaay . That was weird. She settled into her seat, and waited for the teacher to begin. Just then, Filkins walked in. His hood was up and his head was down, but she was almost certain she saw a faint smile on his lips as he walked past her. Maybe she didn't have to worry. Maybe he wasn't mad at all. Heck, maybe Rachel was right. Maybe- Maggie bit her lip to keep from yelping as her hair was nearly separated from her scalp. Never mind. She couldn't believe it. She hadn't known what she was expecting, but it wasn't this. Over the past 5 days, Maggie had undergone the worst school week of her life. Not only had Filkins proven himself to be a true asshole , but he had given her the worst bullying of her life. She wasn't gonna lie, she was still glad she wasn't Ryan or Wade (or Emmit, for that matter) but it was still pretty bad. In fact, it made the first 2 weeks of school look like a picnic. A crummy, cloudy, hot, ant-ridden picnic, but a picnic nonetheless. Everything was 3 times as bad as it was before. Instead of pulling on her hair, he literally yanked it out. Strand by strand. By the end of the second day, Maggie put an elastic band in for fear of losing all her hair. Instead of giving her an evil mischievous look when they passed each other in the halls, he would shove her to the ground and kick her books out of reach. Instead of glaring at her from across the cafeteria, he would sit a few tables away, eat, then dump his leftovers on her lap. He even broke her iPod! Needless to say, Maggie started bringing an extra change of clothes to school. She was considering a waterproof book bag as well, as he had tried sabotaging her work on more than one occasion. It was getting harder and harder to see things from Rachel's point of view. It was Tuesday now. She was only in the second week of torture and her patience, her passiveness, her tolerance, her very being had worn thin. Apparently she was all wrong about him, her and Rachel both. Filkins wasn't halfway decent on the inside, he wasn't a good friend, he didn't care about anyone, he wasn't nice once you got to know him, he didn't like her, and he never would do, think, or say any of those things...why was that so disappointing? Maggie never was one to cry, and she sure as hell wasn't about to start now. Not over Filkins, not over bullying, not over school, not over anything. If anything, she was just...mad. She was mad about...well, everything. School, life, herself...but mostly Terry. He was the source of all this. After school had ended for the day, Maggie headed back to the crime scene: the library. Half because she needed to cool down before she had to ride home with Rachel and Danny, and half because she half expected Terry to be there so she could give him half her mind. It may have looked perfectly innocent, but Maggie felt that the entire area needed to be sealed off with caution tape. She was standing in the same spot she and Terry had been in at the time of the 'incident'. If she could only go back in time, she never would have done it. ...Well, scratch that. If it made him uncomfortable in any way, and managed to screw up his brain by the time he got home, she would gladly do it again, if only to exact revenge. As she was caught up in her thoughts, a voice broke the silence. \"Reminiscing, are we?\" Maggie turned. Filkins . She could have shot a snarky comeback at him, could've punched him square in the face, could've just walked away, really. But she didn't. She was too determined to get to the bottom of this. Ignoring his question, Maggie said, \"What's your problem?\" Filkins lazily strolled closer, hands stuffed in the pockets of his hoodie, and scoffed a laugh. \"What do you mean?\" Maggie's brows knit together, already frustrated with him. \"You know what I mean. You've been a total asshole with a capital 'A' for the past week and I wanna know why.\" He was standing in front of her now, that stupid fake smile plastered on his face.\"I think you know why,\" he added in false tenderness, \" Maggie .\" She looked up at him, staring him down...well, trying to. \"What, you mean that kiss? Look, if that's what this is about, then don't worry. It was...\" she paused, searching for the right words. \"Strictly educational.\" Terry momentarily threw his head back. \"Ha! Gimme a break! What's educational about sucking face with your study-buddy?\" He leaned closer to her, carelessly invading her private space, his expression changing from amused to mocking. Of course he had to be a smartass about everything. \"You know what, you probably couldn't get it through your thick skull anyway,\" Maggie spat. She tried to leave, but Filkins sidestepped her, blocking her exit. \"Oh, no, please. Stay awhile.\" He shoved her back against the wall of books, cornering her. \" Try me,\" he said, no longer smiling. Maggie resisted the urge to roll her eyes. Great. At least he wasn't beating around the bush. He seemed to want to get some answers just as much as she did. He must have been just as confused as she was. She sighed in place of her eye roll. Here goes nothing. \"My friend told me you liked me. I'm sure you've heard the rumors.\" When he said nothing, she continued. \"I didn't believe her, but I wanted to find out for myself, so I kissed you.\" Silence... Apparently he expected her to say something else, even though there was nothing more to say. \"...That's it. End of story.\" She said. It was silent for a good 20 seconds, so Maggie took that as her cue to leave. \"You know...\" Or not. Terry wrapped a hand around her neck and guided her back to her previous spot. He was surprisingly gentle. \"I honestly can't believe you'd be that deluded.\" He finished, a ghost of a smirk on his lips. His hand was still on her neck, applying just enough pressure to keep her there. Maggie, however, didn't give a shit. She looked him straight in the eye, and said, \"And I can't believe I ever considered you a friend.\" Whatever smile that was playing at his lips had vanished, and with nothing more to say, Maggie wrenched herself out of his grip, and left. Terry stood there, stunned as he watched her retreating figure. He looked to the floor after she had gone, processing everything that had just happened. He was broken away from his thoughts when he heard a cough. Turning around, Terry saw a small audience had gathered at the end of the aisle. Apparently they weren't as quiet as he'd thought. On the drive home, Filkins couldn't help but feel like he had seriously screwed something up. Maggie had considered him a friend at one point. And he had to go and throw it all away, like some douche ...he hated to say it, but he felt bad. ...But he shouldn't feel bad. He should feel happy! Or at least better than this! I mean they weren't friends or anything. The only reason they spent time together in the first place was just so he could keep from being suspended! Come on! But he did feel bad. And it made him feel bad that he felt bad in the first place. At least he knew the real reason behind that kiss now; she had only done it to prove a point to her friend - probably that chick she hung around with at lunch all the time - and that she didn't like him and had no interest in him whatsoever, and wanted nothing to do with him now...why wasn't this helping? Terry turned on the radio, hoping to find something to distract him from his thoughts. I thought we were just hanging out, so why'd you kiss me on the mouth- Click. I only wish you weren't my friend, then I could hurt you in the end- Click. All this time you were pretending, so much for my happy ending- Click. I know I hurt you, deserted you, and now I see it clear- Click. At the same time I wanna hug you, I wanna wrap my hands around your neck- Click. You showed your ass and I saw the real you, thank God you blew it, thank God I dodged a bullet- Click. But then I spent so many nights thinking how you did me wrong- Click When did your heart go missing- Damnit, seriously?! Every station?! Sighing in frustration, he turned it off. ... ... ... ...I mean, it wasn't like she meant anything to him... ...Right? After Maggie left, she was even angrier than before she had walked into the library, so of course her mother was on her case by the time she got home. She told her everything, as usual...well, almost everything. She left out some parts, like the neck grabbing and whatnot. She expected her mother to jump to her side of the fence, like she had before. But, surprise-surprise, she did the exact opposite. \"You sure you don't like him?\" Claire asked, smirking. Was that a serious question? Maggie opened her mouth to say yes, but she was cut off. \"Don't bullshit me, honey. Do you like him or not?\" There was nothing malicious in her voice, her mom just wasn't one to beat around the bush...like Maggie! Wait, no, that wasn't good... Sighing, Maggie contemplated her reply. Her instinct was to say no, but would that be a lie? She was pretty sure she didn't like him. Really. And she sure as heck couldn't imagine a life with him, even in an alternate universe. But then again, that still didn't stop people from wondering or fantasizing about what it would be like if that certain person were a part of their lives, no matter how absurd the very notion was. ...Ah, dang it. People didn't get disappointed about people they didn't care about. Seriously. Who was she trying to kid? Well, might as well be out with it. Struggling a bit, Maggie found the courage to swallow her pride, and answered, \"...Ugh, fine! Yes ! Yes I like him! Happy?\" Her mother smiled laughingly. \"Ha! Yep, that'll do!\" Maggie huffed in embarrassment. \"...That's it?\" She asked. \"What's it?\" Claire asked, stirring the vegetable soup she was making. \"Where's the all-powerful wisdom? Aren't you supposed to give me some sort of advice at this point?\" Maggie asked. Her mother blinked. \"Oh, yeah. That.\" Maggie rolled her eyes. \"Call me crazy,\" her mother began. \"But I think there was just a simple miscommunication.\" \"So you're saying you me want to,\" she air-quoted, \"'talk' to him?\" \"Might as well,\" her mother replied. \"I mean, from what you've told me it's not like things could get any worse for you, right? Hahaha!\" Maggie failed to see the humor as her mom repeatedly jabbed her in the ribs. \"...Sorry.\" she apologized. \"Ugh, you're insane ...\" groaned Maggie as she threw her head back. \"Whatever. Just be sure to patch things up next time you see him.\" Ugh, she was never going to her mother for parental advice again... Terry ended up speeding the rest of the way home. No matter what he did, he just couldn't stop thinking about Maggie, and the more he thought about Maggie the angrier he got, and the angrier he got the more he wanted to kill something. He screeched to a halt in his driveway, turned the car off, slammed the door, went inside, and threw his keys as hard as he could across the room. Luckily they didn't hit anything but the wall, but he would like to think that he would've felt better if they had. He walked into the kitchen and leaned over the counter, trying to overcome his growing urge to just break something. When he thought about it, it really didn't make any sense why he was mad. So she didn't like him, so what? It wasn't like he was heartbroken or anything. Sure, she was pretty...well, pretty. She was pretty pretty. And yeah, she had a nice smile. And a cute laugh - not one of those fake irritating ones that most girls do around a guy they like. And she had a strong (but soothing) voice, and he wouldn't particularly mind if she ever went on a rant, because he actually liked the sound of her voice. And he liked her fiery personality - it had been a while since someone actually had the guts to stand up to him like that. And she had nice skin. And hair. And soft hands. And nice, white teeth. And rich blue eyes. And... Dammit. Maggie lay in bed, rolled over on her left side, staring at the clock that sat on her nightstand. As she mindlessly watched the second hand go round and round, she heard a loud screeching - like that of tires - outside. 'Wonder who that could be,' she thought sarcastically. After her little pep talk with her mom, Maggie had to say that she actually felt a bit better about the whole thing. She never would have guessed that admitting to something you've been in complete denial of for so long would lift such a weight off of one's shoulders, especially something you weren't even sure existed. Now there was the whole 'reconciliation' matter to attend to. Her mom had made it sound so painlessly simple, but she knew it was far more complicated than that. She couldn't just walk up to him and say, 'Hey, man, I know we had a big fight the other day, but I want you to know I wanna wipe the slate clean. Oh, by the way, I like you'. She sighed. Besides, she didn't even know for sure if he liked her or not. It sure didn't seem like it. She continued to meditate on the subject of Filkins as she watched the second hand on her clock rotate 62 times. An hour and two minutes later, Maggie decided that she wouldn't say anything about it at all. Filkins could go about his day doing whatever it was that he did (that didn't include messing with her, of course) and she would continue being the quiet wallflower with unrequited feelings. No big deal. ...Wow, that sounded pathetic. But she wasn't gonna be a baby about it and sulk for the rest of the year, either. No, she was gonna be the same as she was before all this stuff happened. And everything was gonna be just fine, or she wasn't Maggie Lovelace! Terry was freaking out. How could this happen?! When the hell did he start to have feelings? And for her , nonetheless! He could admit that she was good-looking and all that - that was just a fact. But when it came to actually liking her, and not just her looks, he was at a loss. He tried to imagine life without her, and upon realizing how bland it would be (even with the Siamese Queers) he thought back to when she had kissed him and how much he actually wanted to do it again, and that was about when his self-induced panic attack started. Terry sat down on the living room couch, trying to keep himself from completely flipping out. What was he supposed to do now? Tell her he actually did like her and expect everything to be hunky-dory? Was he supposed to just walk up and say, 'Oh, hey, I know we had a big fight the other day but I want you to know I wanna wipe the slate clean. Oh, by the way, I like you.'? Hell no! Maybe he didn't really like her. Maybe it was just all the rumors and gossip and lack of sleep getting to his head. That was more than possible. Yeah, he was probably just confused. But that still didn't explain all the damn moths in his stomach...wait, why didn't that sound right? He thought about digging his phone out and calling Ronnie for some advice- er, trash talk, but figured he wouldn't answer. They hadn't really been spending a lot of time together, anyway. Mostly because of - as Ronnie had put it - 'lady problems'. Filkins had laughed when he'd first said that - lady problems - but he totally understood now. Only difference was, Ronnie had fixed his girl problem - every time Terry turned around Ronnie was hanging with some blonde chick - and he was still a mess with Maggie. He spent an hour (maybe more) trying to come up with a solution to this problem, but in the end he just ended up angry at himself for being so stupid. They had school tomorrow, too. Should he just act like nothing happened? Go back to bullying her? Somehow he doubted that mentally abusing her every day would help beat the sense back into him , OR make him feel any better, for that matter. In the end, he decided it would be best to stay away from Maggie. He didn't want to hurt her and that was pretty much the only excuse he had for going around her. Plus, she confused the crap out of him. If she was out of the way, he might - MIGHT - have a chance at getting his head together. He still needed a way to deal with his anger issues, but that was where the Siamese Queers came in. Terry sighed a long, deep sigh, before turning out the light and passing out right there on the couch. He was too young for this shit... A/N: MAN, this was a long chapter to type! Hopefully it seemed shorter due to all the breaks and segments I split it into, though. Anyway, now that Terry and Maggie both have their feelings sorted out, it's only a matter of time before we get to see them together :D Two chapters, in fact ;) Songs mentioned in order of appearance (in case you were curious): I Don't Give A Damn - Avril Lavigne Snuff - Slipknot My Happy Ending - Avril Lavigne M.I.N.E (End This Way) - Five Finger Death Punch True Love - P!nk Best Thing I Never Had - Beyonce I Will Survive - Gloria Gaynor When Did Your Heart Go Missing - Rooney[Chapter 14] A/N: In THIS chapter: Filkins mysteriously stops messing with Maggie, there's a fight at lunch, Maggie helps out Alexandria and Ronnie (and Emmit), and Maggie and company are invited to a party (*wink wink*) Disclaimer: I do not own Drillbit Taylor Chapter 14: Invitation~ When Maggie went to school the next day, she didn't know what to expect. All she knew was how she was going to act; she could say nothing for Filkins. On the way to school, everything seemed normal; Terry's car was parked in its usual spot, so she knew he couldn't be at home freaking out. When she walked into history class, Terry was already in his sea- hey! No he wasn't! Maggie stared at him as she made her way to her desk even though he wasn't looking at her. She sat down, continuing to stare. Okay, something was definitely wrong here. The seats were assigned, he couldn't just move! Just then, Mr. Donald (the hillbilly substitute) walked in. \"Oh-kay, class. Some of you may notice that most of you brats aren't in your regular seats. Well, that's because I looked at the charts this morning and I thought: well, that is just, plain, stupid! So, as of today, we are no longer assigning seats.\" What!? You can't just 'unassign' seats! That's preposterous! Someone in the class voiced Maggie's silent opinion. \"You can't do that!\" Mr. Donald zeroed in on them. \"And who are you, little miss 'I-know-everything'? Do you make the rules here? Are you a teacher? No, didn't think so.\" The girl was speechless. Mr. Donald raised his hand in the shape of a gun, pointing at her. \"Chk. Cop a squat, little girl.\" And class awkwardly began. At her next class, Filkins did the same thing. He sat as far away from her as he could manage, but upon further inspection Maggie noticed that (apparently) 'far away' meant right behind Emmit. Apparently all the 'teachers' thought assigned seats were 'stupid'. Noticing that their teacher hadn't shown up yet, Maggie took the chance to save her friend from certain doom. \"Hey, Emmit.\" She said as she walked up to his desk. Emmit looked over at her. \"Oh, hey! How are you?\" Ever the gentleman. \"Fine, fine,\" she answered, purposely ignoring Filkins. \"Um, hey. Do you...wanna trade seats?\" Filkins twitched in her direction. Emmit seemed blind to this. \"Oh, no. I'm fine.\" He replied, smiling. \"Are you sure about that?\" Maggie emphasized, giving a quick glance to the seat behind him. Emmit's face looked questioning, but he turned around to see what she was talking about. His face paled as he came face to face with Filkins, who gave him a sickly sweet lopsided smile. Emmit immediately turned back around, embarrassed at being caught. As predicted, he took Maggie up on her offer. \"Um...yeah. We can trade.\" He said, nodding furiously as he gathered up his books in a heap and scampered off to Maggie's previous spot. Disaster avoided. Maggie sat down - gross, it was warm - making sure not to look at Filkins. She heard him getting up out of his seat to move somewhere else, but the teacher walked in, so he sat back down. She wondered if the reason he wasn't in his usual place (somewhere behind her, that is) was because he wanted nothing to do with her anymore. And if that was the case... Behaving in an almost too-casual manner, Maggie experimentally let her hair down. All throughout class, Filkins never touched her. Not once. Never did she feel a pull, tug, yank, or brush on her hair. It was actually pretty nice, but oddly enough, she was kind of disappointed. And she wasn't sure if that was a good thing. Everything went fine all throughout the rest of her classes. Up until English came. Unfortunately, on the way into the classroom Filkins had already beat her to the seat behind Emmit's, and Mr. Taylor was already starting class. Dangit. After about ten minutes of near-pointless lecturing, Mr. Taylor had all of the students read from their textbooks as he lounged at Ms. Zachey's desk reading who-knew-what. And everything was nice and quiet. Too quiet. Maggie spared a glance over in Terry's direction. He had a wad of chewed up bubblegum in his hands, stretching it out as he leaned forward to place it in Emmit's hair. She watched in silent horror as Filkins' bubblegum-laden palms slowly eased toward the back of Emmit's head. Her arm was itching to shoot up and grab Mr. Taylor's attention, but just as she was about to, he was already getting up from his seat. \"Mr. Filkins,\" he said, lifting his feet off of Ms. Zachey's desk. \"Would you please come up here and read...\" he looked at the cover of the book he was reading. \"Contemporary Romance Poems of the Renaissance?\" Filkins begrudgingly slid out of his seat and stalked up to the front of the class, and Maggie couldn't help but wonder were he'd hidden that gum. As it turns out, Contemporary Romance Poems of the Renaissance was a collection of short sex novels. As you can imagine, Filkins was laughed at by pretty much everyone in class. Everyone but Maggie, that was. It wasn't that she didn't find the whole scene humorous - in fact, it was hilarious - but she knew that when he was humiliated, Terry would go out of his way to hunt down whoever had dared open their mouths in front of him. This whole class was doomed. Despite the odd turn of events the day had taken, lunch was when things got really weird. It was an uncharacteristically nice day out, so everyone was eating outside. Maggie, Rachel, and Danny had sat down and were eating peacefully when Wade walked up to an Asian girl and her friends that were sitting a few tables away. She couldn't tell exactly what was being said (what with all the chatter going on around her) but it looked like he was asking her out. She looked like a nice girl. She'd probably say yes. Things were looking pretty good. Until she saw Ronnie and Filkins walking towards Wade with shaken-up soda cans in their hands. Just as the girl was about to reply to whatever Wade had said, Filkins and Ronnie threw their sodas onto their table, watching in glee as they were soaked in brown liquid. Terry sauntered up to Wade laughing, putting an arm around his shoulder and saying something that was no doubt a sarcastic wisecrack. The girl -Brooke! Now she remembered! - said something to Filkins, probably telling him to leave them alone. By now, all of the chatter had died down, allowing Maggie to hear clearly what Filkins said back. \"What'd you say, ho?\" Well that wasn't very nice. Apparently Wade didn't think so either. As Terry was walking away, Wade grabbed him roughly by the shoulder and spun him around to shout in his face. At this point, everyone had gotten out of their seats to crowd around the two young boys, including Danny and Rachel, who drug Maggie out of her seat to go join them. They were still kind of far away, and she certainly couldn't see much because of all of the other people - and her shortness, but that's besides the point - but she heard Terry shout, very clearly, \"Everybody listen up! Party at my house tonight! I want you ALL to come see me beat the shit outta these nerds! It's gonna be hilarious!\" Maggie struggled to see, but alas, she was too short. She heard Wade reply, equally loud, \"Oh, you're on, 'brother'! And I will see you there!\" The crowd diminished to only a few people, revealing Ryan and Emmit running up to Wade. Filkins must have left, because he was nowhere to be seen. Danny returned to their table, Rachel dragging her along. Well. She knew where she wasn't gonna be tonight. After school let out, Maggie made her way down the front steps to the parking lot to wait by Danny's truck so she and Rachel could ride home together. As she cleared the first flight of stairs, she noticed Emmit sitting on the bottom steps. What was he doing here? \"Hey,\" Maggie greeted as she sat down beside him. \"Hi.\" Emmit replied, smiling in his usual dorky way. After a few seconds of silence, she cut straight to the chase. \"So where's Ryan and Wade? I thought you guys were going to the party tonight.\" Emmit scoffed. \"They are. I am staying right. Here.\" Say what? Those guys were practically velcroed to each other! ...Er, and not because of the what happened on the first day of school. Never mind. \"W-what? Aren't you guys friends?\" Another scoff. \"I thought we were. That is until Wade signed our death warrant!\" ...Oh. She was starting to get it now. \"Wait, so...you're not going to help them?\" She asked, smiling slightly in disbelief. Emmit stuttered in his response. \"W-well, I...just don't...wa-wanna get killed, is all. I-I'm not abandoning them, haha.\" He stared nervously at her, eyes darting from her to the ground. Maggie raised her eyebrows at him. \"It sounds like you're ditching them in their time of need to me.\" \"Yeah, well...well I... oh whatever.\" Emmit got up and walked off, hurrying over to his mom's car. \"Just think about it!\" Maggie shouted, cupping her hands around her mouth. As she watched them drive off, she felt a presence behind her. She twisted around. It was Alexandria. She looked very awkward, like she'd been standing there for awhile but was too afraid to say anything. \"Hi.\" Maggie said gently. This seemed to snap her out of her trance. \"Oh. Hi.\" A pause. \"...Can I sit with you?\" The blonde asked, putting an unsure foot forward. \"Sure, I don't see why not.\" Maggie replied, moving her book bag out of the way. Alexandria sat next to her. A good three feet away. She felt stupid for moving her bag. And so, the two engaged in an awkward silence. Well, awkward for Alexandria. Maggie was perfectly content with waiting for the other girl to say whatever it was she wanted to say. She knew she wouldn't have to wait long. ... ... ... \"...Can I ask you something?\" See? Maggie couldn't stop the sarcastic comment that just begged for this moment. \"You just did.\" The blonde blinked. Apparently she didn't get the joke. \"...Yeah, go ahead.\" Maggie encouraged, covering her blunder. Alexandria exhaled deeply before beginning. \"Okay. Well, I noticed you spend- spent , a lot of time with Filkins...\" \"...Okay. So?\" \"So, I thought you'd be the best person to ask...\" Ohhh, okay. Now she got it. \"About Ronnie?\" Maggie finished. Alexandria looked down. \"Yeah.\" Silence. \"...Well, so what's the problem?\" Maggie asked finally, glancing at her. \"Well, he told me that he loved me, and-\" \"Wait wait wait wait wait wait wait . Liked? Or loved?\" Maggie interrupted. \"Loved,\" the blonde clarified. \"But the problem is that I already have a boyfriend. He's really nice...\" she trailed off. Maggie broke the silence before it got awkward again. \"Well...so, do you love him?\" The other girl began fidgeting with her skirt. \"Yeah. I think so...\" \"And what? You're worried about...?\" \"Matt.\" The girl clarified. \"Matt, right. So, you're worried about Matt having his heart smashed in two-\" she stopped herself at the look of unabashed discomfort at her 'violent' description. \"But the way I see it, if he can't respect that you like someone else and leave on good terms, he wasn't worth it anyway.\" She finished, looking out at the parking lot. Alexandria was quiet a moment. \"Hm. Thanks.\" She smiled slightly. Wow. This girl didn't make a lick of sense. She must have been one of those people that needed to have the answers to their problems told to them by someone else, even when said answer was right in front of them. Maggie really couldn't understand people like that, but whatever. Alexandria stood up from her spot next to Maggie, smiled, and just as her father pulled up, walked out to the curb, and left. Maggie hadn't been alone two minutes when Ronnie bounded out from the school entrance and flew down the steps. He skidded to a halt at the curb. Was he looking for who she thought he was looking for? Maggie was impressed at how quickly he was able to come to a stop; she hadn't even known he was there until he had flown past her - he must've skipped half the steps - and he was so huge that she couldn't comprehend how the force of all that weight could come to such an abrupt stop. He didn't even notice Maggie until he had spun around in a total 360. Giving her a double-take, Ronnie's face lit up in what appeared to be hope, and putting a step forward, said, \"Hey. Hey, you're that girl, right?\" Gee, what a great way to start a conversation. When she didn't answer right away, he asked, \"Hey, you seen Alexandria? Maggie wasn't quite sure she should tell him. She figured Alexandria was safe at home, wherever that was, but she also figured that if she really wanted him to know where she was, he wouldn't be asking right now. But at the same time, if the young blonde loved him - or whatever - then it shouldn't really be a problem. Besides. She wasn't a liar. \"Yes.\" Maggie replied after the longest while. He must have known about her sarcasm - probably from Terry - because he asked, \"... Recently , right?\" Maggie nodded. \"Yeah.\" Ronnie was almost immediately in her face, desperation clear in his features.\"Where'd she go?\" He asked urgently, shaking her slightly. Maggie was a little surprised (or maybe shocked, she couldn't tell) but she answered nonetheless. \"She's on her way home with her dad.\" Ronnie's head jerked forward, almost headbutting Maggie, as he cursed to himself. \"Dammit!\" He hung his head, still clutching Maggie's arms. Awkwardly, she stiffly reached a hand up to pat his head comfortingly. Suddenly, his head jerked up. \"Did you talk to her?\" She was going to say yes, but she really didn't want to breathe in his tomato/onion breath, so she merely nodded. \"Well, c'mon, what'd she say?\" He asked, shaking her again. \"She said-\" Maggie paused to gently push at Ronnie's chest, creating some breathing space between them. \"She said that she needed some advice about you-\" his eyebrows lifted. \"And Matt.\" Aaaand down they fell again. \"Look,\" she said, gripping his shoulders firmly. \"She likes you. A lot. I mean, all you have to do is go to her and she'll say yes. Just...be gentle, okay? You're a giant, so you probably just scared her off.\" Maggie didn't even get a chance to widen her eyes as Ronnie, now bursting with happiness, grabbed the sides of her head, and with a force that probably should have snapped her neck, pressed his lips to her forehead. He pulled away a split second later, smiling like an idiot. \"Thank you so much! You have no idea what you-\" he stopped and wrinkled his brow, staring at her as if he had only just recognized who she was. \"...Hey.\" he said slowly. \"Hey, wait a sec. You're that girl!\" Hadn't they already established this? \"Uh... Maggie ! Yeah, that's it, Maggie! I'm s'posed to be mad at you!\" Maggie stared in utter confusion. What did she do? \"You know, you put Terry through a lot of shit.\" Oh, really? Is that what he said? \"Yeah, man, he's been acting all fruity lately...\" Realizing he still hadn't let go of her head, Ronnie awkwardly released her. \"And I just know -\" He attempted to point a finger at her, but his hand got tangled up in her hair. He awkwardly (but comically, she had to admit) untied his hand from Maggie's unruly locks. She'd forgotten to brush her hair that morning, so what? \"I just know you had something to do with it!\" He finished, putting his all into looking serious. Eventually he stopped pointing at her and ran a hand over his mouth, frustrated. Maggie idly wondered if she should move up a couple of steps so he didn't have to hunch himself over like a giant Neanderthal to be eye-level with her, but her thoughts were interrupted when Ronnie acknowledged her again. \"You know Terry's party's tonight, right?\" He asked. Didn't the whole school know? Ronnie continued. \"Well I plan on goin' tonight, and YOU better be there.\" What?! \"What?!\" Maggie furrowed her brows and shook her head. \"You heard me,\" Ronnie smirked, giving a short nod. \"Wha- why?\" She asked, still unable to process. \"What do you mean 'why'? Because it's your fault!\" She opened her mouth to argue, but he beat her to it. \"Hey! He didn't start flakin' out 'till you came along.\" That was true. Sort of. Ronnie stood up, looking around. He exhaled, resting his hands on his hips. He finally started to walk away, but he turned around to face her again. \"Hey,\" he called to her, pointing as he walked backwards. \"...you better fix this.\" He gave a lopsided smile before twisting back around and walking off. Maggie sighed. Did everyone need counseling today? \"Hey, Maggie, do you think I should go out with Jason?\" 'I rest my case,' she thought sarcastically as she twisted around to greet Rachel and Danny. Maggie huffed, hiding a smile. \"What took you guys so long?\" \"What?!\" Exclaimed Rachel once they got in Danny's truck. \"You want to go to Terry's party tonight? Why? You hate him!\" \"I don't hate him.\" Maggie said. Rachel stared at her with her mouth hanging open, a strange twinkle in her eye. Danny sunk in his seat, trying to be invisible. Silence... \"...Look, Emmit and his friends are gonna be there.\" Maggie said finally. \"I want- have - to protect them.\" Corny as it sounded, it was true. She felt it was her duty to at least try and keep them out of harm's way. Or something. Rachel was finally able to close her mouth, though that knowing twinkle never left her eye. Silence... \"Oh-KAY...\" Danny said, starting the truck. \"Well, uh...\" Rachel found her voice. \"It's 2:46 now. The party starts at 9:00. What are we gonna do until then?\" Maggie came prepared for this one. \"Movies.\" Apparently Rachel was prepared for it, too. \"That still leaves us with like, three hours to blow. What about after that?\" \"Food.\" \"And after that?\" \"Skatepark.\" \"Yes!\" Danny exclaimed. Rachel ignored him. \"And after that?\" \"Shopping.\" Danny groaned. \"And after that?\" \"Party.\" Rachel smiled, showing off her pearly whites. \"Okay, then. Let's do it.\" \"Alright!\" Danny said, putting the truck in gear and driving out of the parking lot. Maggie looked out the passenger side window, but not before catching an all-too-knowing look from Rachel. A/N: WOW. That was a long chapter. 13 pages, in fact. Well, 6 and a half if you were reading a book, but whatever. The party's next, and it is a VERY, long chapter. But you shouldn't mind, since the whole thing's pretty much just a heap load of MaggiexFilkins goodness, haha XD I'm splitting it up into 3 different parts anyway, so you should be fine ;) In case you were wondering, 'Mr. Donald' is Don, aka Danny McBride from the movie. Just saying. Anyway, don't waste any more of your time. Go ahead and click that next chapter![Chapter 15] A/N: It's finally here! This chapter is INSANELY long, so it's split up into 3 parts. Let the partay begin :D In THIS chapter: Terry gets buzzed, and Maggie catches him doing something he's not supposed to (lol whatever you're thinking, just stop ). Disclaimer: I do not own Drillbit Taylor Chapter 15: Party pt. 1~ Terry maneuvered around countless people as he attempted to make his way around to the kitchen. There were a lot of people there already, and it was only 9:30. The night was still young. He only recognized about half the faces as schoolmates; everyone else was a stranger. Apparently everyone and their cousin wanted to see him beat the shit out of those two nerds. He wasn't really sure why he had done what he did; challenging Wade and inviting the whole school to his parent's house - he'd be surprised if something wasn't broken already. It was stupid, he'd admit, but it was too late now. Once he thought about it he supposed he'd done it because he just needed to pummel something...or in this case, someone. He needed an outlet with everything that was going on right now: school, Maggie, Ronnie...well, when he put it that way it didn't seem like much at all, but it felt a lot bigger than that. Especially Maggie; he didn't know what to do about that one. One minute they were almost-friends and everything was going great, the next he quit spending time around her for three measly days and they were back to being arch-enemies, and the next she turns around and kisses him, says she doesn't like him, goes back to hating him, and leaves him to fall for her! Like a chump... He was so damn confused... Terry finally made his way to the kitchen; he wasn't really hungry, but one of the seniors had brought their brother who brought his college friends who brought beer, and he needed some serious stress-relief. Nabbing a can from the tub of ice on the counter, he poured some into a paper cup - not sure who brought those - and took a swig, and then another. And another. And another. He emptied the can pretty fast, so he poured himself another shot and took another swig. And another. And another. And another... And...hey, why was everything starting to spin? Feeling a little dizzy, Filkins set down his beer (someone else was sure to come along and steal it later) and walked back out towards the front of the house where everyone else was. Normally, he'd be talking with Ronnie right now, but he hadn't seen him all night. It was possible he was already there and he'd just missed him, but until they crossed paths, Terry was out of luck. Besides, he was probably too busy with that emo chick anyway... Let's see, what do you do when you're buzzed and bored? Terry glanced around, his gaze settling on a blonde in a miniskirt and tube top leaning against the wall by the staircase. He was pretty sure they had class together, but who's ever really sure when you've had a drink or two? He wasn't drunk enough to miss the seductive smirk she was sending his way, though. And really, he was so buzzed, so frustrated, so out of it, that he just didn't care anymore. He needed something to do, and she was there. He was at her side in a second. Besides , he told himself. He deserved a chance to just forget everything for a while... After movie-watching, eating, skate-parking, and shopping, Maggie and her friends pulled up to Filkins' place. \"You're sure about this?\" Rachel asked just as Danny put the truck in park. Maggie nodded. \"Yep.\" When they all hopped out of Danny's pick-up, they took a moment to take in their surroundings. Nearly all the lights in the house were on, and the entire building practically vibrated with life. There were cars parked everywhere, a few even in the front yard, and the ground beneath them shook with every beat of the near-deafening music that was playing inside. It was so loud that the tune couldn't even really be recognized; it was just a blend of vibrations and beats. \"Into the belly of the beast,\" Danny joked. Rachel scoffed, leaning into Maggie's ear. \"I'll take care of Danny, you just do what you need to do.\" She whisper-shouted over the noise. Maggie gave her a questioning look. She had already told her that she was there for Emmit and his friends, not Terry. But there was no use fighting it now. In fact, it would be quite absurd. She was here to help Emmit, but a part of her was also here for Terry. Who was she to question Rachel's all but obvious knowledge? So, letting Rachel have her say, Maggie nodded at her. And with that, they went inside. During the five minutes that Terry and Brittany (or was it Chelsea...?) had been making out, he lost complete track of time. Had it been minutes? Seconds? Hours? He must've been more wasted than he thought. But whatever. Brittany had served her purpose. Maggie was the farthest thing from his mind. For the first five seconds. The truth of the matter was, the more he kissed Brittany, the more he couldn't stop thinking about Maggie. If anything, he was even more frustrated now than he was before he'd decided to entertain 'Brittany' or 'Chelsea' or whatever the hell her name was. He was about to call it quits when he noticed her unresponsiveness. Pulling away from her neck to see what the problem was, Terry noticed her gaze wasn't focused on him. Expecting to turn around and find an angry ex-boyfriend, Terry's face paled as he was met with something much worse. Standing not ten feet away, and looking less than happy, was Maggie. Maggie didn't know what to think. Rachel had dragged Danny off to talk with some skaters the second they walked in the door, but Maggie definitely wished they were here now. She hadn't been there two minutes before she caught sight of Terry making out with some blonde chick. She was so shocked that she just stood there, mouth snapped shut, staring. And it wasn't long before Blondie noticed, either, because she stopped kissing Terry and stared right back, her expression somewhat quizzical, as if Maggie was some rare species of bird she couldn't quite remember the name of. Terry had buried his face in her neck by the time he noticed his partner's distracted behavior. And that was when he pulled away, followed her gaze, and locked eyes with Maggie. She was feeling so many different emotions at one time, and they were all morphing by so fast - disbelief, shock, sadness, hurt, anger, confusion, irony - that Maggie wasn't quite sure what to feel. But she knew one thing for certain. One thing that stood rationally above all the warring emotions inside her: she needed to get out of there. She turned toward the front door, but found her path was blocked by Ronnie and Alexandria. He had an arm around her, the other holding a drink. His face lit up as he immediately recognized Maggie. \"Hey, Mag! Long time, no see!\" He grinned, raising his cup. Maggie would have said a polite 'hello', but the urgency she felt in her brain telling her to leave as quickly as possible won past it. She looked at him for a split second before changing course and heading upstairs, not bothering to look back. Terry's breath stopped as he stared at Maggie, and he got a terrible feeling in his stomach as he saw her hurt expression. He hadn't felt this guilty since he'd broken his mom's China all those years ago. He knew they couldn't have been staring at each other for more than a few seconds, but it felt like years as he anxiously waited for her to do something, anything. And finally, she did. Terry watched in a daze as Maggie's face turned from hurt to angry, to very angry, and turned to leave. He was able to snap out of it when he saw her talking to Ronnie, saw she was leaving. Immediately he sprang into action, head spinning a little as he left Brittany's side to chase after Maggie, who was heading upstairs. He was stopped by Ronnie, who put a hand on his chest and pulled him back just as he began to climb the stairs. \"Hey, what the hell did you do?\" Ronnie accused, yelling over the loud music. Terry looked back at him for only a second before wrenching his friend's hand off of him and continuing up the steps, pushing and shoving as he did so. The hallway was packed with bodies. From wall to wall there were drinks, couples, conversations, jokes, pranks, and dancing. And Maggie was so short it was like trying to find a midget in a moshpit. Great. Filkins wormed his way to the end of the hallway, looking for Maggie. Where was she? Deciding she must have gone into one of the rooms, he reached for the nearest door (which happened to be his parent's bedroom) and jerked it open. He was met with one of the jocks from school and some other chick he didn't know making out on his parent's bed. They immediately stopped what they were doing and started apologizing, but Terry didn't hear as he slammed the door shut; he didn't have time for this. Turning around in the hallway, he headed for the next closest door: the closet. With more force than necessary he wrenched it open, finding nothing but a bunch of blankets and cleaning supplies. He shut the door, banging his fist against the frame as he rested his head against it, exhaling. ...Hey. Wait a second. She's been here before. She knew her way around. And she certainly wouldn't hide in a closet. And upstairs there were only two other places she could be: the bathroom, or his room. Opting for his room - since it was closer - Terry shoved past anyone blocking his path, which was pretty much everyone. Once he reached his destination, Terry jiggled the handle, only to find that it was locked. Lucky for him, he had the key in his back pocket. He fumbled getting it out, but eventually reached past all the lint and bubblegum wrappers and dug it out. Holding the key in triumph, Terry steered his hand toward the lock... And then some asshole bumped him. The key fell out of his hands, skidding across the wood floors to who-knows-where. He was about to turn around and knock the lights out of whoever had had the gall to get in his way, when suddenly the door opened. Maggie emerged from his bedroom, head down, face solemn. She looked like someone who had just been humiliated and didn't want to look anyone in the eye. She opened her mouth to say something - probably to ask him to move - but stopped when she looked up, seeing who he was. She stared at him for two seconds - two very long seconds - before kicking into gear and trying to push past him. Filkins, of course, had other plans. He moved to block her way, grabbing hold of both her wrists when she tried to shove him. Acting fast, he pushed her backwards into his room, shutting the door with his foot. He let go of her to lock the door and flip on the lights. When the room flooded with brightness, he inwardly wished he would have cleaned up a bit, but the thought passed as quickly as it came. Maggie was standing at the foot of his bed, her back to him. It was silent for a few moments, Maggie because she obviously didn't want to talk to him, and Terry because he didn't know what to say. \"...Maggie?\" He called, uncertain. She moved her head at the sound of her name, but nothing more. It was the first time he'd said her name (without the sarcasm, that is) and all he got for it was a turn of the head. How encouraging. Dammit, he wasn't good with delicate situations! After she had run upstairs, Maggie immediately began looking for a place to hide. At first she tried the bathroom, but of course with a house full of people it was locked. So she tried the next closest thing: Terry's bedroom. Luckily it wasn't locked. Maggie went inside, locking the door. She didn't bother turning on the lights; she knew where everything was. She walked up to the bed and sat down, putting her head in her hands. She attempted to sort out everything that had just happened. She knew she shouldn't really be upset. It wasn't like they were together or anything. He could do whatever he wanted. It was his house, after all. But that fact failed to help the sinking feeling in her stomach, or the anger she felt towards her own stupidity, or the sadness and confusion. She sighed. She was such an idiot, thinking he liked her. But at least she knew now. At least now, everything was perfectly clear. And she could handle that. She'd have to. And even though she felt like it she was not going to cry. Not over something as stupid and trivial as this. Maggie was jerked from her thoughts as she heard the door handle jostle. Probably a couple of teenagers looking for a little 'privacy'. Whatever. She had overstayed her welcome anyway. She got up and walked over to the door. She bowed her head as she opened it; though she knew no one would probably recognize her, she still felt ashamed at what had just transpired downstairs. When she opened the door, she stared at their - correction, his - shoes. Huh, just one person. No couple. Maggie looked up, curious as to who this single person was. And imagine her dismay when her eyes met none other than the one person she didn't want to see. Terry . There was about two seconds of silence between them before she finally came to and tried to move past him. She knew that it wasn't going to work, of course, but it was worth a try. After struggling a bit, he grabbed her and pushed her back into the room, shutting the door. Great. She was stuck in a room with her archnemesis. Maggie's heart further plummeted as she heard the lock click. Knowing what was coming next, she turned her back to him as the lights flicked on; he was the last person she wanted to be around, let alone see. Tension immediately filled the air, threatening to just choke them both and get it over with. She really, really, really didn't want to talk right now, and she hoped he'd get the message. \"...Maggie?\" Guess not. A/N: Okay, I'm cutting off here for part 1. It's super long (the longest chapter in the whole story, in fact) and stopping it right here is equal to 8 pages! And we're only 1/3rd of the way through! As I said in the Author's Notes at the top (and in the Author's Notes in the previous chapter) this chapter will be split into 3 parts. Now move that cursor (or finger/stylus, depending on what you're using) and click the next part :D[Chapter 16] A/N: Part 2! :D In THIS chapter: Terry makes a confession, Maggie thinks, and Wade gets a shot. Disclaimer: I do not own Drillbit Taylor Chapter 16: Party pt. 2~ Not knowing what else to do, Terry took a step closer. She still wasn't looking at him, and he knew that wasn't a good sign, but he had to explain, to make her understand. But really, what could he say? That he was sorry? And that he expected everything to be suddenly better? Things just weren't that simple. Not with girls, anyway. Terry took another step, and Maggie, knowing she wasn't getting out of their little private 'talk', angrily whirled around to face him. When he saw her cold but clearly hurt expression, he knew this wasn't going to be easy. He really screwed up. And he might not - scratch that, he probably wouldn't - be able to fix it. But he still had to try. \"Maggie, look, I-\" \"You have lipstick on your face.\" He stared at her for a second before remembering 'Brittany' and wiping furiously at his mouth. That shit was near-impossible to get off. Embarrassing moment aside, Terry tried again. \"Maggie, I just want you to know that-\" She cut him off. \"You don't have to tell me anything. It's your life, you can do what you want. No need to explain to me.\" She brushed shoulders with him as she walked towards the door. Did she seriously think he was gonna give up that easily? Suddenly aggrivated, Terry turned around, stalked up to her, and spun her back around to face him. He grabbed hold of her arms and shoved her against the door, holding her firmly in place in case she tried to fight him again. \"Now, listen ,\" he hissed. It was just like her to cut him off. \"No, you listen. It's. Fine.\" She bit out. Now it was his turn to cut her off. \"No, it's not! What I did-\" \"What you did is none of my business. Now let me go.\" Pssh. That was an easy one. \"No.\" \"Yes.\" \"No.\" \"Yes!\" \"No!\" \"Yes!\" \"N-\" \"YES!\" This was getting nowhere. Terry let go of her, exasperated, turning around and throwing his hands in the air in frustration. The girl was just so damn stubborn. It was like trying to reason with a rock. After a few seconds of silence, Maggie spoke. \"...Look. I don't blame you, so there's no need to apologize.\" She added, \"or whatever it is that you wanted to d-\" \"Maggie,\" Filkins interrupted. \"Just shut up.\" He knew it wasn't the smartest thing to say given the current situation, but he was already fed up with the pesky excuses she was making. He hated it when people danced around the issue, avoided the problem. And, of course, Maggie took only the highest offense to his choice of words. \"Excuse me?\" Oh, great. She was quiet for a few moments, obviously letting her anger boil over. And then she opened her mouth. Here it comes. \"You know what?\" No, what? \"I won't shut up.\" That's what I thought. \"I can't believe I was stupid enough to come here.\" Maggie, please be quiet. \"Everything would have been just fine if I would've just stayed home.\" Shut up. \"At least then I wouldn't be stuck here with you.\" Shut up, shut up, shut up. \"You are such an asshole.\" Ouch. \"But then again, you already know that, right? How could you not ? You...\" Terry covered his ears with his fists, trying to tune Maggie out, but she just kept going on and on and ranting and ranting and he just couldn't take it anymore. She wasn't gonna let him get a word in edgewise, he knew that much. So, Terry did the only thing that came to mind at the time that he knew would shut her up. Without giving it another thought, he whirled around, crossed the distance between them, grabbed hold of her face, and kissed her. ...Well, that worked. He pulled away after a few seconds, his face still close to hers...why did this feel like some sort of reversed, twisted de ja vu? Terry looked at Maggie; her eyes were still closed and her mouth was ever so slightly open. God , he wanted to kiss her again. Call him crazy, but right now he just felt like forgetting about the party, about those two nerds, about Brittany, about everything, and ditching everyone and just running off with her. In fact, it didn't seem impossibly unreachable at this point. They were alone... He was interrupted from his fantasy when Maggie's eyes finally opened. She blinked a few times, a bit dazed. A thousand thoughts ran through him as she did this. Would she be angry? Would she leave? Would she hit him? Would she be happy? Sad? Furious? Would she tell him off? What should he do? Should he back away? Say something? Say nothing? Was it time to panic? Was it over? Had he screwed it up even worse? At this point Maggie had looked up at him, so he was able to put his panic on hold. That didn't stop the sudden onslaught of anxiousness that washed over him, though. It felt like he was being kept in a choke hold the entire time she was staring at him. And the longer she stared, the longer she waited to say something, the worse it got. She was doing this on purpose, he just knew it. Not that he didn't deserve it, but still. He wondered if she knew she was searing a hole in his skull. He stopped breathing, his hands were starting to get sweaty, his heart was beating so fast he thought he might have a heart attack. Inwardly he was biting his nails down to stubs, he was so nervous. Everything weighed on this moment. Nothing else mattered. Not any of their past conversations, fights, or time spent together. It all came down to this. He wished he could just drop dead. Maggie blinked, then blinked again. And then she opened her mouth. \"Why you son of a-\" He silenced her with his lips again, pushing her further into the door. They were too close for her to beat on his chest like most angry girls would, so it was only natural that Maggie, in her current enraged state, settled for digging her fingernails as hard as she could into the back of his neck. As you can imagine, it hurt. Terry ceased kissing her almost immediately, but still refused to let her go, instead resting his forehead on hers. They were both breathing harder than normal, but judging from the pure hatred radiating off Maggie, he suspected for different reasons. His eyes were closed, so he couldn't see her face, but he took a wild guess and supposed she was absolutely livid. After regaining her breath, she attempted to speak. Coincidentally, at the same time Terry did. \"I hate you-\" \"I love you.\" Well that was awkward. Did she really hate him? Was this a doomed effort? Should he just give up? Silence followed as they both contemplated over what the other had said. Terry began to idly stroke the sides of her face with his thumbs when Maggie spoke. \"...What?\" He froze. Oh, great. Did she seriously expect him to say it again? It was hard enough admitting it the first time! He began pulling away, but she grabbed hold of his wrists, keeping them on either side of her face, in attempt to make him stay. \"What did you say?\" She asked again, more conviction in her voice. Well...he had nothing to lose now. Might as well have it out in the open. Terry pulled away again. Or not. Maggie kept her grip on his wrists, squeezing tighter, almost painfully so. \"If you said it once, you can say it again.\" She said, tone deadly serious. Here goes nothing. \"I love you,\" he repeated, struggling. She said nothing for the longest time, merely staring a new hole into his skull. He quickly became fidgety, wanting nothing more than to duck and hide for cover. It felt waaayy too out in the open. When did this room get so big? Finally cracking under her penetrating stare, Terry ducked his head, resting in the crook of her neck, hiding there. God , this was embarrassing. At least no one else was here to witness this. He wasn't entirely sure it was time to break out the L word, but it didn't make it any less true. He was in love with Maggie Lovelace. And that scared the shit out of him. He could almost hear the wheels turning in her head, and he was almost certain that her next question was going to revolve around orbit 'Brittany'...or whatever. And depending on his answer, it could make or break whatever it was that was left of what they had. She began to ask the dreaded question. \"What about-\" Terry, however, was so antsy and impatient that he interrupted her almost even before she began. \"It should have been you.\" Feeling better now that he had gotten that off his chest, he sighed, and said it again, lower this time, in her ear. His contentment (and any other positive emotions he had at the moment) were quickly squashed, however. It was so quiet after that that even the pounding music seemed to die down. A minute passed of mutual silence, then another. Maggie spoke again. \"Why should I believe you?\" Good question. Why should she believe him? He'd done nothing but treat her like shit and he was supposed to just say 'I love you' and expect her to fall at his feet? Too bad it didn't work that way. So why should she trust him, you may ask? Well, because...because... Dammit. He sighed, irritated with himself that he couldn't find a better answer. \"You shouldn't .\" He said finally. \"But I'm asking you to...please.\" he struggled to add, and he buried his face deeper into her neck, embarrassed as hell. He wasn't used to groveling like this. He felt her breath hit his shoulder as she exhaled deeply. Was that good? Seconds passed, and she said nothing, dashing his hopes. Great, she was probably thinking of the best (or worst) possible way to reject him. He'd swallowed his pride and laid his heart out like a chump, and she was about to butcher it with the knife she'd kept secretly behind her back...not to say he hadn't done the same thing to her not 20 minutes ago. As Terry waited for an answer, the air around them grew tense. He didn't dare leave the safe haven that Maggie's neck provided. As much as he wanted to know, he also didn't want to know, and he didn't dare pull away to look at her face. Who could blame him? Every guy was afraid of rejection, whether they showed it or not. Terry's hands gripped her shoulders harder, unsure of when they'd moved from her face, as he felt Maggie inhale. And now, ladies and gentlemen, the rejection you've all been waiting for... Suddenly there was a loud series of knocks on the door, causing them both to jump apart. \"Hey, Terry, you in there?\" It was Ronnie. Terry wasn't sure whether to thank him or choke him. He glanced at Maggie. She was standing a few feet away, facing away from him. Definitely thank. He unlocked the door, opening it just enough to see his friend. \"Hey, man, those two nerds are here.\" Said Ronnie. Terry looked back at Maggie, who was staring at him expressionlessly. Exhaling, he looked back at Ronnie. \"Sure, let's go.\" He needed a break from all this tension. And besides, there had to be over a hundred kids down there, all waiting for him to kick those queer's asses. They were all expecting a good show. He couldn't disappoint them. And so, Terry followed Ronnie out, shutting the door behind him, not looking back at the distraught brunette he'd left behind. Once he was gone, Maggie sat back down on the side of the bed. She could honestly say she hadn't expected him to say he liked her, least of all love her. She wanted to believe him, of course, but seriously, why should she? She shouldn't, he'd said so himself. But then again, a true liar probably would have assured her that she could, should, and would believe him, so she supposed he was being honest there. Unless he was so cunning, so devious, that he had told the truth to tell a lie...was that even possible? Nah. Terry wasn't that creative. But that girl... Maggie tried to think of a valid reason a man would get... intimate , with a woman when he truly did love someone else. Needless to say, it was hard to think of one. Maybe he was drunk , her mind told her. People do all kinds of crazy things when they have booze. True, but if that were so, he sure seemed to snap out of it real fast. Her inner musings were interrupted when she heard a loud crash coming from downstairs. Oh, no. Another crash. Ryan. Wade. Emmit! I haven't had time to think about anything today, she complained to herself, jumping up from the bed and running out the door. She found everyone in the front yard. Maggie pushed her way to the front of the crowd. They had formed a circle around Filkins and Ryan and Wade and Ronnie. She studied the scene before her: Ryan had Ronnie in a bear hug, Emmit was lying on the ground, and Wade was trying his best not to get beat to a pulp by Filkins. She briefly searched around the ring of spectators for Danny and Rachel, but couldn't find them. Maggie bravely stepped forward, ready to rush to Wade's aid, when Terry noticed her. He looked at her, chest heaving, body sweating, for the longest second she'd ever experienced. And that was all it took for Wade to get an opening. She watched as Wade's fist connected with Terry's jaw, sending him to the ground in a heap. The crowd gasped, then cheered as they all surrounded Wade to congratulate him on his victory. And that was when they heard the police sirens. A/N: We get to see a bit of Ronnie's POV in the next chapter. Just saying. Anyway, not much to say here, so find the 'next' button and click away! :D[Chapter 17] A/N: The final part to Party. Plenty of MaggiexFilkins goodness. Enjoy ;) In THIS chapter: Maggie takes care of Filkins (again), Ronnie stops by, Terry wakes up, Maggie fixes things, Terry's happy, and Maggie stays the night. Disclaimer: I do not own Drillbit Taylor Chapter 17: Party pt. 3~ Everyone was in a panic as they fled the scene. Wade and Ryan dragged Emmit off across the street, Ronnie grabbed Alexandria and ran to hide behind the house, and Filkins was still lying there in an oblivious heap of defeat. Cars pulled out and drove off faster than Maggie thought possible. She hustled herself over to Terry's side as quickly as she could manage, covering his body in attempt to keep him from being trampled. She spotted Rachel and Danny by the truck, waving frantically for her to join them. She shook her head. She wasn't going to leave him like this. Rachel looked at her, a bit confused, but Danny dragged her over to the passenger door and forced her inside, giving an understanding nod in Maggie's direction as he made his way around to the driver's side, got in, and drove off. The sirens were getting closer. Maggie knelt down and leaned over Terry, looking at his face. He was out cold. Wow, Wade had done a pretty good job. She looked up, just in time to see the flashes of reds and blues and whites of the police cars. She watched as they sped closer... ...And drove right past their house. Hm. Everything was so quiet now. There was nothing left but matted down grass, scattered red solo cups, and a potentially ruined $500,000 home. If the neighbors hadn't called about the noise, she wondered what the problem was. Perhaps someone was getting robbed...or something. Maggie turned her attention back to Terry, and sighed. She rolled him over onto his back, then heaved him up onto her arms and dragged him into the house, chuckling at how familiar this felt. Once inside, Maggie was able to assess the damages. She was surprised she hadn't noticed it on the way out; the railing to the staircase had been broken off - it now rested on the floor by the couch. A lamp was laying on the floor with its shade ripped off. The glass to the cabinet that sat next to the television was now in shards on the carpet. The 360 lay smashed by the stairs, and there were cups and plates and food everywhere. I'll deal with you later, she glared at a plastic cup that was sitting upright on the floor, taunting her, as she dragged Filkins over to the staircase. Maggie dragged Terry up the stairs, scoffing when one of her shoes slipped off. She moved up a few more steps before deciding to take off the other one. She got more traction with her feet anyway. When she reached the top of the first flight of stairs, she realized how hot she was. Dragging bodies was a lot of hard work! She didn't know how serial killers or the mafia managed to pull this stuff off. Setting Filkins down for a moment, Maggie took off her jacket and tossed it in the corner behind her. She picked him up again and made her way up the second (and last, thankfully) flight of stairs, and waddled into his room, kicking away an old pair of boxers as she did so, and shut the door. \"Are you sure it's safe?\" \"Relax, the cops are long gone.\" After hiding out in the neighbor's yard behind Terry's house, Ronnie had convinced Alexandria to come back around to the front of his friend's place. \"I just wanna check on him,\" he assured her. Alexandria stood on the porch, watching timidly as Ronnie opened the door and stepped inside. \"...Terry?\" He called, looking around. \"Hey, man, you in here?\" He glanced at the broken stair railing before turning back around to face Alexandria. \"Wait here.\" He told her, and she nodded. Ronnie started to go up the stairs when he felt a lump underneath his sneaker. He moved his foot aside and looked down. It was a shoe. A girl's shoe. 'Maggie must still be here,' he thought. Continuing up the stairs, he noticed another shoe, and when he reached the top he saw a jacket crumpled in the corner. Confused, Ronnie glanced up the hallway towards Terry's room and- OH MY GOD WERE THOSE BOXERS?! Suddenly getting the feeling he shouldn't be here, Ronnie ran back down the steps and out the front door. When Alexandria leaned over in an attempt to peer inside he grabbed hold of the knob and deftly closed the door. \"...We'll come back later.\" After laying Terry down on his bed, Maggie sent her mom a text saying she was staying at a friend's house for the night. She knew her mom was far too perceptive for such an obvious lie, but it was worth a try. And lo and behold, not 30 seconds after she'd hit send, her phone started ringing. Rolling her eyes, Maggie pulled out her cell phone and answered, stepping out into the hallway and closing the door. She didn't want to wake Terry. The first thing Terry noticed when he woke up was that his head hurt. A lot. The second thing he noticed was that he wasn't outside like he should have been, but in his room. The third thing he noticed was the time; he rolled over onto his side to look at his clock - 10:30. The fourth thing he noticed was the sound of voices. Well, a voice. The fifth thing he noticed was that it was Maggie's. He listened intently to the muffled hums of her voice even though he couldn't make anything out of it, but judging from the tones of her voice she was talking to her mother. He could only imagine what she had to say about this. Maggie walked back in a few moments later. He didn't bother feigning sleep - she would know anyway. She shut the door, pausing when she saw him staring at her. \"You're awake.\" She said. Yeah, no shit. Terry didn't answer, just swung his legs over the side of the bed and sat up. He rubbed his head, wishing it would quit throbbing. \"There's some aspirin and some water on your bed stand.\" Said Maggie, still standing by the door. \"Well, don't you just think of everything ,\" he replied sarcastically, popping the pills in his mouth and downing the water. Now that his brain was unscrambled, he remembered why he didn't want to be around her. Had she seriously stayed just so she could reject him? Getting up, Terry shuffled over to the door, stopping when Maggie stood in the way. \"I gotta take a piss,\" he said impatiently. She stared at him for a second before stepping aside, a grim look on her face. He didn't really have to use the bathroom, and he knew that she knew. They both knew. They would have to deal with it sooner or later. He was only delaying the inevitable. After doing his business, Terry walked back to his room, shutting the door harder than necessary when he saw she was still there. \"You need to leave,\" he said shortly. She didn't respond, but immediately took on an obvious air of defiance. Becoming aggravated, he tried again. \"You can't be here.\" He didn't want to be so cold, but it seemed to be the only way to get through her head. He just couldn't deal with her right now. He'd just been knocked out cold by an absolute nerd, the house was a wreck, his head hurt, his parents were going to kill him, his school reputation was all but ruined ... He just needed her to leave. He couldn't handle a rejection on top of everything else. Exhausted, Terry walked back over to his previous spot on the bed - the one that wasn't close to Maggie - and sat down, rubbing his temple to try and make his headache go away faster. He heard an irritated sigh behind him. \"You're doing it wrong.\" Terry ignored her, instead creasing his eyebrows and squeezing his eyes shut as he rubbed harder. He was so focused on blocking her out that he didn't notice when she walked over to his side of the bed and pulled out the chair from his desk to sit in front of him. \"Here, let me.\" She grumbled, annoyed. His eyes shot open as he felt her fingertips replace his own on the spots he was poorly attempting to massage. He opened his mouth to ask her what the hell she thought she was doing, but she beat him to it. \"I don't want to hear it, so just can it.\" Terry closed his mouth, muttering a low, \"Whatever...\" Maggie rolled her eyes. \" Man , you're so stubborn.\" \"Whatever,\" he said again, resting his head on her collarbone. After the pills had set in (and 10 minutes of Maggie's TLC) Terry's headache subsided. Actually, it had started feeling better after about five minutes, but he wasn't about to tell her that. Still, he couldn't shake the feeling that he was just prolonging his fate. Why else would she have stayed if she wasn't gonna stick him with an answer? And he definitely didn't want to go to sleep feeling like a loser. Best to stop before it even started. \"Hey,\" he said to get her attention. God, he sounded pathetic... \"Yep?\" She replied, still massaging his head. Terry sighed, trying to muster up even a semblance of coldness. \"You should go.\" \"Why?\" She asked, sounding innocent as ever. Did she have to make everything harder than it already was? \" Because ...\" when he couldn't think of a legitimate reason (other than the truth, of course), Maggie spoke, in a very deceptively soothing voice, mind you, \"I'm not leaving.\" Dammit, woman! Cursing under his breath, Terry grabbed her hands, stilling her movements. He leaned back to look at her. \"I'm serious.\" He said, trying to sound authoritative. \"So am I.\" She shot back. He hung his head, frustrated. \"What's your problem, huh? Why don't you want me here all of the sudden?\" She asked curiously, craning her neck to try and catch his eye. \"Well I don't know if you've noticed, but I've had a really shitty day.\" He told her, getting angrier by the second. \"That's not an answer.\" He threw her hands back down in her lap and stood up. He needed some serious breathing room right now. \"It's good enough, now go.\" He ordered. Maggie rose from her seat. \"No, it's not.\" \"Yes, it is.\" \" No , it isn't!\" \"Just leave.\" \"No!\" \"Get out!\" \"Why won't you just tell me?!\" Terry was silent, looking away from her and running a hand through his hair. He moved further away from her, standing by the door. He let out a breath before answering. \"Look, we obviously don't like each other, so let's just-\" \"Who said I didn't like you?\" This girl was going to be the death of him. Maggie was puzzled. Really, she was. How could he think she didn't like him? Why the heck would she stay and take care of him if she didn't like him? She thought the answer was obvious. \"Terry?\" Man, that felt so weird to say. \"Who said I didn't like you?\" She asked again, her tone impatient as she stepped closer. He said nothing, instead looking briefly at the ground as he swung the door open and waited for her to get out. Maggie looked out into the hallway, then back at him, and took a defiant step backwards. She was so not backing out on this. Realizing she wasn't going to leave, Terry swung the door shut and tossed his arms up in the air, taking a few steps toward the corner of the bed opposite from Maggie, who in turn moved to stand in front of the door so he couldn't toss her out so easily. Silence enveloped the room as Maggie tried to figure out what was making him act so weird . 'Well, you did tell him you hated him,' her brain reminded her. Oh. Right. Duh. She would have slapped herself, but the situation demanded she not make a fool of herself. Okay, so she knew the problem now. She could fix this. Maggie knew that if she took too much time trying to explain he would just cut her off and shove her out the door. Besides, she wasn't very good with stuff like this. She'd take way too long fumbling over her words. So, she settled for the one word that might actually register in his brain at the moment. \"Yes.\" Terry whirled around to face her, confusion evident on his face. Good, she had his attention. Now was her chance. \"I was going to say yes, you know. I do believe you, and I'm...\" she sighed. \"I am willing to give this a try.\" His expression changed from confusion to...shock? She couldn't quite tell, but she took it as a good sign. \"But if this is gonna work, you have to promise me that you'll stop-\" She was cut off as his lips collided with hers. She vaguely registered a thud as her head hit the door. Wow. That was easier than she thought it would be. So painlessly simple...but she still had to finish what she was going to say. Maggie placed her hands on his chest and pushed him away, just long enough to catch her breath and (try to) finish her sentence. \" Stop bullyin-\" But he was already kissing her again. She moved to push him away when she heard the unmistakable sheen of a knife being pulled out. Maggie momentarily froze as she felt a slight tugging at her ponytail, and then a snap! as the elastic was cut and her hair came tumbling down. By the time she regained her confidence his hands were already threaded in her hair. Oh, just forget it... Terry was in Heaven. Well, not really, but close enough. He completely forgot about the wrecked house, his busted jaw, Brittany, and every other bad thing that had happened to him that night. It may have sounded corny, but he honestly couldn't have been happier at the moment. He felt all light headed, like he was full of air. In a word, he felt high. Just, you know...not on drugs. He would never tell Maggie, but her hair was incredibly soft. If they made pillows made from it, he'd buy one. Seriously. He couldn't keep his hands out of it. And damn , she tasted good! He didn't want to sound weird, but, if she were a jelly bean, she'd definitely be Cherry. Or maybe Strawberry...he didn't know. Either way, she tasted a thousand times better than Brittany . She tasted like the black jelly beans, the gross kind nobody likes...at least, compared to Maggie. He was way too preoccupied to focus on anything other than kissing her senseless, and he didn't mind one bit. Terry wound his hand further around Maggie's head, tangling his fingers deeper into her hair, and rested his other hand on her hip. He kissed along her jaw line, trailing kisses down her neck. He had to say, he was amazed at how soft and smooth her skin was. It was almost ridiculous. He settled his lips on her throat, the vibrational hums of her strumming vocal chords telling him that she was talking. He knew she had something she wanted to say, but in all honesty, talking was the last thing on his mind right now. He didn't ignore her, per se, but he didn't exactly listen either. But then she said something that caught his attention. He wasn't sure, exactly, but he was certain that he'd heard the words 'stay' and 'night' in the same sentence. And that was bound to get any guy's attention. \"You say you were staying the night?\" He asked, kissing her ear. She seemed a little miffed that he had ignored her initial question (whatever it was) but she answered nonetheless. \"Well, that's kind of what I told my mom, so yeah.\" Hell yes. \"...Why?\" She asked, suddenly suspicious. Terry didn't respond to that. Instead, he just ducked his head and grinned into her neck. He was now the happiest man in the world. \"Hey, you know it's like almost 11 o'clock, right?\" Shit. \"You need to go to bed.\" She said as-a-matter-of-factly. \" Hm-mmm ...\" he protested, trying to kiss her again. God, he sounded like some whiny teenager...oh, wait. He was one. \"No. You need to rest.\" She argued. She was right, but that didn't mean he wanted her to be. \"Look,\" she said, pushing him away from her. \"I'll handle everything downstairs. You just relax.\" He couldn't stop the suggestive smirk that spread across his face at her accidental double-comment. Realizing her blunder, Maggie's face reddened as she rolled her eyes. \"You know what I mean.\" Terry laughed, turning toward the bed. She turned to leave, but paused when he turned back to her. \"...Did your mom seriously say you could sleep over?\" She made an 'eh', expression. \"Well, she kinda still thinks you're unconscious.\" \"Oh.\" She brought a finger to her lips. \"Shh, don't tell!\" She smiled mischievously. He grinned. \"And don't get any ideas, I'm sleeping on the couch.\" Damn. She made a move to leave again, when Terry added, \"Oh, hey, there's some stuff in my mom's dresser if you need some sleep-clothes or whatever.\" \"Thanks.\" And she left. And so, as Maggie worked her magic cleaning up and...whatever else it was that she was doing, Terry got ready for bed. He closed the curtains, changed into a pair of pajamas (he didn't bother changing his shirt), turned off the lights, and hopped into bed. As soon as his head hit the pillow, he realized how tired he was. And he'd also noticed that his headache was coming back. Must have been from all the stress of fighting with Maggie earlier...or something. Oh, well. Terry rolled over onto his left side, but it didn't help any, so he flipped over onto his back. That only made it worse. In the end, he found that the most comfortable position for his headache to be on his right side, facing the digital clock resting on the night stand at the other end of his bed. He hated sleeping on his side. It was just so annoying. But whatever. He could handle one night. No big deal. Terry sighed, and with nothing else to do, attempted to sleep. He woke up some time later, only to find that his headache was still there. Or had he? He wasn't entirely sure he'd slept at all. It sure as hell didn't feel like he'd gotten any rest. It was still dark, so it couldn't be too early...what time was it anyway? Terry lifted his head in the direction of his nightstand. Why couldn't he see the clock? It was completely black, almost as if something was blocking it- The bed shifted as someone (or something) climbed in beside him. He nearly jumped out of his skin in fright. But it was dark. And he was cooler than that. A second later he remembered Maggie. And you can be dead sure he was glad he had simply frozen rather than shoot up out of his own bed. Unsure of whether he should acknowledge her presence or pretend to be asleep, Terry just lay there, watching with blind eyes as she slipped under the covers with him. \"Your house is weird.\" At first he didn't understand, but then it hit him and he couldn't help to stifle a laugh. \"Are you scared?\" He laughed, teasing her. She froze, and he felt her movements cease. \"O-oh, you're awake?\" Woops. He blew his cover. Then another thought hit him. \"...Wait, you talk to yourself?\" He said, laughing all over again. His response came in the form of a pillow to the face. \"Okay, God!\" He chuckled, and lay his head back down. \"...Is your headache better?\" Maggie asked after a while. Technically yes, but it's not like she could know that. \"Not really.\" He replied, letting out a 'pained' breath. Hey, he was gonna get all he could for this. About ten seconds after he'd said that Maggie wordlessly wrapped her arms around his neck and pulled him closer. He had the feeling that it was meant more as a comfort for her than him, but he wasn't about to complain. \"Did widdle Maggie have a nightmare?\" \"Shut up.\" She halfheartedly smacked his head. Terry silently chuckled, snaking his arms around her waist and burying his face in her hair, nuzzling her neck with his nose. He could definitely get to sleep now. A/N: Whoo, it's finally done! :D Er, the chapter, not the story. Ha. I WAS going to split this chapter in half, buuut I decided not to :P I hope there was enough MaggiexFilkins 'interaction' for you, lol...hey. I just realized something. If you combine their names, you get Flaggie. Or Taggie. Or Merry. Or Milkins, lol! XD Anyway, this chapter (or rather, this part of the chapter) was really hard for me to write. I'm just not good at all that kissey-kissey stuff. lol. I hope it wasn't too corny, but if it was don't worry. It doesn't get any worse than that, lol. Though really, I suppose I should be more concerned with Terry being OOC, but whatever. Well, by now I figure if you've read this far you're probably pretty tired, so bookmark this chapter (or whatever) and come on back tomorrow. And if you're not tired, then go right ahead and click the next one, because I'm sure you're curious as to what happens in the morning ;)[Chapter 18] A/N: In THIS chapter: Terry solves a 'misunderstanding', Maggie hides from Ronnie, and they attend their first class together as a couple. Disclaimer: I do not own Drillbit Taylor Chapter 18: Morning~ Maggie woke up the next morning feeling happy and content, despite the fact that she'd opened her eyes to the annoyingly bright numbers of the digital clock that rested on the nightstand a mere foot away from her face. It was 4:52 A.M. She stared at that dastardly timekeeping device for approximately four minutes before rolling over onto her other side to check on Terry. He was lying on his stomach, one arm hanging off the side of the bed, the other slung lazily over her side. His face was inclined towards hers and his cheek was smashed into the pillow he was using, and upon further inspection Maggie saw he was slightly drooling. She would have laughed but she kept silent. She didn't want to wake him. Besides , she thought to herself, he looked cute this way. She could take a picture and blackmail him if they ever broke up. 'Nah,' she decided. 'That would be going too far.' Besides. She didn't bring her camera. Sliding out of bed, Maggie was careful not to interrupt Terry from his sleep. Quietly shuffling over to the door, she stopped to gaze at him, smiling to herself as he shifted his head to the other side of his pillow. She committed the insane uncharacteristic cuteness of the scene before her to memory before turning and heading out the door. She had work to do. Terry groggily opened his eyes, creasing his brow as his vision cleared to reveal a dirty pile of clothes he'd thrown in the corner who-knows-when. He attempted to raise his arm to get the sand out of his eyes, only to find it was numb from hanging off the end of the bed for so long. Dammit. He shifted onto his back, raising his other arm to his face to cover his eyes, and groaned. Then he remembered Maggie. Still closing his eyes, Terry rolled over onto his right side and haphazardly flung his still numb arm across the bed, expecting his hand to meet Maggie's waist. Imagine his surprise when said arm met nothing but air and flopped carelessly back onto the mattress. The hell? He blindly moved his hand across the sheets until he almost fell off the other end of the bed. Finally opening his eyes, Terry was greeted not with Maggie's beautiful face, but with the bright red numbers of his alarm clock. 6:02. Shit, he needed to get ready for school. Sitting up, Terry briefly tried to make sense of what happened the night before. Was it all a dream? He rubbed his jaw. Hell no. What about Maggie? Had she really stayed the night? He smelled his shirt. Yep. Then where the hell was she? Terry's face blanched as a thought suddenly struck him. That bitch! She'd packed up in the middle of the night and left! Was this her form of rejection? To accept him and make him feel better, only to pull the rug out from under him later? When he least expected it? ...Wasn't that supposed to be the guy's job? Now he was mad. Really mad. Violently tossing the covers aside, Terry stalked out of his room and headed for the bathroom. He paused to peer down the stairs. Maggie's jacket and shoes were gone. Bitch... After doing his business, Terry all but flew down the staircase and rounded the corner to the kitchen. He was so- He paused in the doorway as his eyes landed on none other than Maggie. -pissed? \"Rough morning?\" She asked, breaking an egg into the bowl she was using. She was fully dressed, jacket and shoes and all, and she had taken the time to make breakfast. \"Uh...\" Terry sat down at the table, speechless. Great, now he felt like an ass. \"...Kinda.\" He stared at her as she scrambled the eggs. \"That sucks. Here's your egg.\" She replied, setting down a steaming plate of eggs, toast, and bacon. Terry was so blinded by the mouthwatering smell that he hadn't noticed how forcefully his food was placed on the table. \"And here's your milk.\" She set - *cough* slammed *cough* - his glass of milk down beside his plate. Okay, he did notice that one. And did he detect a hint of malice in that pretty voice of hers? \"Oh, but wait. Aren't you forgetting something?\" She asked with mock concern, turning back around to face him as she leaned against the doorway. Yep. Definitely malice. But just for the hell of it, Terry decided to play along. \"I dunno...what?\" \"Gee, I don't know...THIS?\" Maggie jerked down the collar of her shirt, revealing a giant hickey. Well okay, it wasn't giant, but it was definitely there. Wait...so that wasn't a dream... Coming back to the issue at hand, Terry asked (very smugly, I might add), \"Whoa, what happened to you?\" \"You happened to me.\" She replied angrily, turning around and all but stomping back into the kitchen. Whoops. She was pissed. And the day hadn't even really started yet. Setting down his toast, Terry got up from his chair and, silently laughing, followed Maggie into the kitchen to smooth things over. After leaving Terry's bedroom, Maggie had gone (naturally) to the bathroom. And imagine her surprise when she looked in the mirror and found a giant bruise on the left side of her neck. Well okay, it wasn't giant, but it was definitely there. She wouldn't have been so mad about it if she had just been awake when it happened. She didn't think he was the type of person to...'do' stuff like that. At least not without her consent. But then again, he bullied her to the point of snapping without her consent, so what was a hickey to him? Really? She sucked her teeth. Bastard. Giving one final glare at the mirror, Maggie headed downstairs to clean up. She was able to get most of the trash - cups, plates, wrappers, glass, etc. - the previous night, so she now only needed to stuff everything into trash bags and dispose of the waste from those petty teenagers from the night before. There were some things that couldn't be fixed, however. At least, not by Maggie. She left the broken piece of railing where it lay on the floor. Hey, she was no repair man. She also left the 360 alone, although she did have the decency to move it onto the coffee table where it wouldn't get stepped on. After filling two whole bags with utter trash, Maggie set them against the wall beside the front door. It was 5:49 by the time she finished. Heck, she might as well clean the carpets, too. She remembered where the sweeper was from the time she had torn the house apart looking for a gosh darn blanket. And so, after getting out the Filkins' Shark, plugging it in, and sweeping to her heart's content, Maggie was disappointed to find that she had only used up 16 minutes of her time. She didn't have to get ready for school for another 22 minutes. Well, now what? As if to answer her question, Maggie was hit with a sudden case of incredible hunger. Guess she was making breakfast... Maggie hadn't been cooking for three minutes when she heard an upstairs door slam. Someone wasn't a morning person. She briefly contemplated poisoning the eggs but decided against it when she heard feet stomping down the stairs. So, Maggie kept her cool, Terry sat down...well, you know what happened. Which, of course, leads us to now, where a fuming Maggie stood in the kitchen with a totally-guilty-but-not-going-to-admit-it Terry behind her. \"Do you honestly expect me to believe that you did this in your sleep?\" \"Do you honestly expect me to believe I'd lie to you?\" \"...\" \"...Don't answer that.\" Maggie rolled her eyes and threw her hands up. Unbelievable. \"Besides, I mean it's not like you can't cover it up with a scarf or something, right?\" Maggie turned around to give him an 'are you serious?' look. \"Are you kidding me? Scarves are...that's like the biggest hickey-hiding cliche ever! I might as well prance around school without one!\" Of course, it was just like Terry to unrealistically simplify things. \"So just wear your hair down, no one'll notice.\" Taking out a switchblade from his pocket, Terry reached behind Maggie's head and cut the hair tie she was wearing. There was an audible snap! as her hair came tumbling down. He fluffed her hair, tossing a few strands over her shoulders, and strategically positioned the frontmost locks in front of the offending mark. When he was done, Terry took a step back, stroking his chin to admire his work. \"See?\" He gave her a thumbs up. Maggie's face soured. She grabbed his hand and turned his thumb down. \"See?\" She demonstrated her point by moving her head slightly and easily shaking her hair out of the way. Terry's face fell into a 'darn it' expression, clearly searching for a new solution. Suddenly, his face lit up. \"Your jacket! You can just wear your jacket all day.\" \"Earth to Terry: I already wear my jacket all day.\" \"Uh, Earth to Maggie: I freakin' know that. Here,\" he zipped her jacket up. \"See?\" Maggie looked down. Well, she tried to. Of course she couldn't see her own neck. Reaching up, she felt for the bruise, relieved to find it was covered by the hood of her jacket (but just barely). Terry smirked at her, obviously basking in his own genius. Maggie rolled her eyes. \"Whatever...\" \"What, no kiss?\" She walked past him to the stove. \"Seems to me you had about a hundred 'kisses' last night.\" She said smartly. \"Well in my defense I did have a really weird dream last night.\" Her face twisted angrily. \"Just finish your breakfast.\" \"Will do.\" \"And get ready for school. We have to leave in 15 minutes.\" \"Yes, mommy.\" If Terry's car was nice on the outside, it was even nicer on the inside. It had leather seats, iPod dock, cup holders (something Maggie had wished for whenever she and her family went out for fast food), and the carpets were the cleanest she had ever seen. Terry had run back inside for his book bag, so Maggie took the opportunity to play with the adjustment settings on her seat. Hey, she had to be comfortable. As she moved her seat up and down, she didn't notice Terry had come back out of the house. She jumped and froze when the back door of the car suddenly swung open and he tossed his bag in the back seat before joining her up front. Great, now she was uncomfortable. \"Uh, shouldn't I sit in the back? I mean, don't you and Ronnie usually drive to school together?\" She asked, not about to tell him she had been screwing around with the chair controls. He scoffed. \"Please. He can catch a ride with his mom.\" She widened her eyes and looked away. \"O-kaaay. Long as you're sure.\" Terry started the car and turned on the radio. He scoffed again, laughingly this time. \" Yeah, I'm sure.\" And he pulled out of the driveway. The drive to school was silent, aside from the radio. But it was a comfortable silence, the kind where you just enjoy each other's company. Maggie had sent her mom a text saying that she was riding to school with Terry. She was surprised (but at the same time wasn't) when she replied back saying it was fine. She even added a smiley face. Hiding a smile, Maggie glanced at Terry. He was focused on the road, brows furrowed in concentration, eyes squinting in the morning light. His mouth was set in a thin line, and although it probably wouldn't look like it to an outsider, he was practically beaming. Throughout the entire ten minutes they'd been driving, Maggie could literally feel the happy vibe he was (unintentionally, no doubt) giving off. If she had some form of specialized super-vision she was sure he'd be radiating Happy. And that was perfectly fine with her. After a while, Maggie turned away from Terry, deciding to focus her attention on the trees outside her window. As they pulled up to a stoplight, she turned her gaze to the car next to theirs. It looked kind of familiar...her suspicions were cleared when Ronnie's head popped out from the passenger's seat, apparently saying something to his mom. Maggie tried to hide herself, but it was too late. Ronnie stopped mid-sentence when he recognized who was sitting in his spot in Terry's car. Maggie's eyes widened. Ronnie's jaw dropped. And then the light changed. Terry, being the reckless driver that he was, sped ahead and passed them, and Maggie, being the curious girl that she was, looked in the side view mirror at the Lampanelli's car. Ronnie still had the same expression on his face. Sinking in her seat, she spared a glance at Terry. He didn't seem to notice that he'd just passed his best friend. Oh, well. It was probably for the best. When they pulled into the school parking lot, everything seemed perfectly normal. No one was staring at them, giving them weird looks, or treating them any differently. But then again, they hadn't stepped out of the car yet. Maggie wasn't worried about being judged or cast out or condemned or whatever for being with Filkins - she could honestly care less about what they thought. But she wondered if it was the same for him. If it was, he didn't show it. Still, it wouldn't hurt to ask. When she thought about it, she supposed he was sacfrificing a lot to be with her. His 'bad boy' image would practically shatter the second they walked up those steps together, not to mention the sure teasing and heckling he was bound to get from everyone saying he was 'whipped' or whatever term they used up here. But then again, she supposed his reputation was already tarnished from last night. And not to mention the fact that the whole school pretty much saw them as already being together. Still...yeah, she'd better ask. \"So, you sure you wanna go in together?\" He gave her a look. \"Yeah, why the hell not?\" Well that was settled fast. She must have been making a weird face, because Terry started to give her a what-are-you-doing-what's-your-problem-are-you-high look. Fixing her expression, Maggie moved to get out of the car. \"Wha-hey! Wait a sec!\" Her efforts were halted when the door locks disappeared. She should have known he wasn't gonna drop it. \"What do you mean 'am I sure'? Why wouldn't I be?\" Sighing dramatically, she turned back to him. \"I don't know, maybe because we'll be the talk of the entire school?\" That got him thinking. She sighed again, lightly this time. Men were so dense sometimes... For the first time all morning, Terry actually stopped to think. Maggie was right, they would be talking about them. He hadn't thought about that, but like he said, he hadn't been thinking all morning. And so, to appease his girlfriend of nine hours, Terry thought. For about five seconds. \"Pfft. Who cares? Besides, if everyone knows you're with me, they won't mess with you.\" \"No one really messed with me before...\" He grinned at her. \"Well they really won't mess with you now.\" Assuming the conversation was over, Terry turned to open the door. \"Wait.\" Suppressing a groan, he turned back to Maggie. \"What?\" \"I need to tell you something-\" \"You're pregnant.\" \"W-what? No! We haven't even-\" \"Hahaha, yeah, I know. But your face? Priceless.\" \"...\" \"...\" \"...This is kind of important, you know-\" \"I know. Please, continue.\" \"Would you stop that? I can't even-\" \"Stop what?\" \"I-\" \"What?\" \"Interrupting me! GOSH...\" \"...\" \"...What?\" \"You really need to work on your people skills.\" \"Just forget it.\" Laughing, Terry caught Maggie's arm before she could leave. \"Hey, c'mon. I was just kidding. Now what is it?\" He watched, amused, as she crossed her arms and let out a huff. And she said he was immature. \"...Okay, I'm not even gonna bother asking if you remember last night, so I'm just gonna say it: if we're gonna be... if this is gonna work...gah! You need to quit bullying people!\" She finished, exasperated. Wow, was that it? He was expecting a time limit on how long they could spend together a day or something stupid like that. Or, you know... some type of boundary. He sure wasn't going to give her any ideas, though. The only reason he even bothered with the two nerds (well, two and a half if you counted the short one) in the first place was because he was bored and there was little to nothing else to do in this Godforsaken town, but with Maggie here now he was sure to be occupied. This was an easy battle. \"Look, if the only reason you're with me is because you're trying to play martyr and protect those geeks, then we might as well end this right now-\" \"No! That's not why I'm...grr! Look , we both know it's not right, and it has to stop. Besides, it's not like I'm asking you to...\" she thought for a moment. \"Stop playing Grand Theft Auto.\" \" That's crossing the line.\" She rolled her eyes. \"You know what I mean. So are you gonna cut it out or what?\" Throwing his head back, Terry groaned, \" Fiiiine , God!\" \"I'll do it. But only because you asked. Got it?\" \"Yep.\" Maggie smiled, pulling him in for a quick kiss. Terry wrapped his arms around her, spotting Ronnie staring quizzically at him a few yards away with a 'what's going on' expression as he looked over her shoulder. Smirking, Terry sent him a victory smirk and gave him a thumbs up. Easy win. Sure enough, when Maggie and Terry got out of the car, all eyes were on them. Maggie ignored the stares. Terry didn't. He sent death-glares to just about everyone on campus as they ascended the concrete stairs leading up to the school's entrance. By the time they got to class, everyone was talking about them, and Maggie humorously wondered if they would make the headlines of the school newspaper... \"Hey, did you hear me?\" She was pulled from her thoughts by Terry. \"Huh? What?\" \"I said I'll drive you to school from now on, so you should tell your mom.\" \"Oh, um...yeah.\" \"...Are you okay?\" Maggie looked oddly at him. \"Um, yeah. Why?\" He lifted a hand to her forehead. \"You're not sick or anything?\" \"Um, no, why?\" He removed his hand. \"Because you're zoning out like a weirdo.\" He grinned at her. She gave him a look. \"Whatever.\" Maggie rolled her eyes and went through the doorway leading to History, Terry laughing silently behind her. The 45 minutes it took for Mr. Dunbar to give a lecture on the Revolutionary War went by surprisingly fast for Maggie. It didn't seem like everyone was gossiping in hushed whispers, or conspiring against her, or all joining forces to create an air about the room that was as tense and awkward as possible. When she had first walked into the room, she half expected there to be a spotlight on her, beating down on her form with an unforgiving brightness as it followed her all the way to her seat, while she, in vain, attempted to spot and recognize all those who chattered and gossipped and laughed behind the glare... Okay, maybe that was a bit too dramatic. But she expected someone to say or do something! There was no glare, no gossip, no laughing, no ridicule, no spotlight...and that made Maggie all the more suspicious. She didn't care, of course. She didn't care what everyone else thought about her and Terry. Why should she? She would be graduating. And when she did, she would step out into the world, with or without Terry, and she would never see them again. Probably. So why should she worry about what a bunch of kids she didn't even know thought about her? Exactly. She and Terry had seated themselves in their usual spots - second row from the back, Maggie in front and Terry behind - and no one had said a word. Like it was just another day. The only one to even glance in their direction was Ronnie. Maybe the news hadn't reached them yet. But anyway, aside from the lack of reaction from her classmates, Maggie made it through Mr. Dunbar's I'm-really-boring-but-i-want-to-try-and-be-cool-to-the-students lecture quite quickly. She sat, listened, jotted down notes, and resisted rolling her eyes when Terry's fingers found their way into her hair before they had even sat down. She simply couldn't understand his fascination with it. She was showering the second she got home. Or, you know. When Terry got her home. Whichever... Oh, never mind. A/N: I hope this was split into enough parts that it didn't make you just wanna skip :P I know when I'm reading I can't psychologically handle a chapter that's thousands of words long with no breaks, so I just end up skimming XD Anyway, yeah. The next chapter has some action in it, some violent action :D So click ahead and ride on! ( '-')/[Chapter 19] A/N: In THIS chapter: Maggie trips up, Terry punches someone (again), and principal Doppler gets involved. Disclaimer: I do not own Drillbit Taylor Chapter 19: Lunch~ By the time they had made it to lunch, Maggie started to feel the peer pressure. It was no surprise - it was lunch! Lunch time was practically every school's central hub for gossip. No big deal. Maggie acted as if she couldn't hear the two girls whispering behind her as she and Terry moved up the lunch line. \"I'm gonna go find us a seat, okay?\" Terry asked, turning to face her. \"Sure, that's fine.\" Maggie gave him a slight smile as he walked off. She then turned her attention back to the day's food selection, unsure of what to pick. Quickly swiping a sandwich and the last vanilla pudding, Maggie brisquely walked out of earshot of the two girls behind her in search of Terry. She found him sitting on the other side of the room, quite a ways away, away from everyone else. Ronnie and Alexandria had just begun to seat themselves next to him, and even though he was far away, Maggie could tell Terry was irritated, if only slightly. Gripping her lunch tray firmly, Maggie let out a breath of determination as she began to make her way to Terry. She hated it when she had to dodge and weave around people and food and bags and feet just to get a darn table. She might as well try and maneuver a minefield. She quietly took note of various cliques as she passed each table: skaters, emos, geeks, theater-goers...Maggie inwardly smiled to herself as she neared her destination. Almost there. Just a few more seconds, and she could pat herself on the back for a job well done. Her happiness, of course, was short-lived. Maggie's right foot caught on someone's shoe, her eyes widened in shock, her tray flew up in the air, her food went flying, and she fell. She put her hands in front of her face to try and catch herself, but as fate would have it, she still landed on the floor. Fortunately, her food tray landed a few feet away, so at least she wouldn't have to change clothes. It was then that she noticed the sudden silence in the room. And then laughter. Terry was at her side in an instant. Maggie ignored the jeers of chuckles and laughter as Filkins helped her up, instead focusing on who she had tripped over. She wished she hadn't. As she lifted her head, Maggie's eyes immediately landed on the 'jock' table. And upon further inspection, she noticed the person sitting on the end, the one closest to her, was none other than one of the football 'Stars' of McKinley High: Brian. He wasn't the best player, of course - that was Brad. But he was up there. \"Watch where you're going, shorty.\" Oh. And he was a jerk. Maggie would have stood up to him, but she knew that he was just your average jock and that he wouldn't be worth it. So she let it go. \"What did you say?\" Terry didn't. She moved to pull him back, but he was already in Brian's face. This wasn't going to end well. \"I said your little girlfriend needs to mind her step,\" came Brian's cocky reply. Maggie was expecting Terry to just hit him at this point, but his next words surprised her. \"Are you gonna apologize?\" Brian scoffed, giving him a funny look. \"Pfft. Excuse me?\" Terry's blood pressure was rising by the second, she just knew it. Time to intervene. \"Terry, look, it's fine, let's just-\" he put a hand up to silence her. \"No.\" He said, still looking at Brian. \"Are you gonna say sorry or not?\" The entire cafeteria was so silent Maggie could hear the school clock. The second-hand made an audible 'tick' before Brian replied, \"I ain't gonna say shit .\" And then all Hell broke loose. Before Maggie even knew what was happening, Terry had punched Brian in the face so hard he stumbled back. The football prodigy grabbed the edge of the table for support, but it slid out from under him and he ended up making contact with the floor. His fellow teammate Brad tried to help him up, but Brian shoved him away as he attempted to stand on his own, swaying ever so slightly as he did so. He took a step toward Terry when Ronnie stepped in to help his friend. \"You sure about that, buddy?\" He warned, pushing Alexandria protectively behind him. A few of Brian's buddies got up to help him when Principal Doppler showed up. He didn't look happy. Everyone froze. Tick. Tick. Tick. Tick. \"Office. Now.\" \" What . On Earth . Were you thinking?!\" Terry exhaled, resting his fist on his cheek in boredom. This was nothing new, but it sure was getting old. He absent mindedly stroked the plush fabric of the armchair he was sitting in as he waited for Doppler's verbal berating to end. Maggie sighed in the chair next to him. She looked as though she couldn't take much more either. Principal Doppler had brought in everyone that had been 'involved', which apparently meant, Maggie, himself, Ronnie and Alexandria, and the entire jock table. Ronnie and Lex were let go almost immediately, as it was determined that they didn't actually do anything. The football team was let go one by one, and eventually, the only ones left were Brian, Terry, and Maggie. \"Look, principal Doppler, I wasn't hurt or anything, it was only an accident.\" Maggie turned to Brian, knowing full well he'd play along to save his own skin and get the hell out of there. \"Right?\" Brian pushed himself off of the windowsill he was leaning against. \"Uh, yeah, sir. It was just an accident that got way out of hand.\" Asshole. He saw him purposely jutt his foot out to trip Maggie. Terry gripped the armrest. He felt like punching him all over again. Principal Doppler looked down at his precious plaque, deep in thought. That dude really needed to get a life. Adjusting the position of his gold-encrusted name, Doppler looked back up. \"...Alright. You're free to go.\" Maggie and Terry rose from their seats, and began to follow Brian out. He was mere milliseconds away from freedom when Terry felt a hand on his shoulder. \"Not you, Mr. Filkins.\" Damn. Maggie turned around to look at him from the doorway, uncertainty in her face. \"Down worry,\" he said as Doppler led him back to his seat. Terry winked at her. \"I'll be out in a sec.\" Time to lay on the charm. Maggie was leaning against the wall with Ronnie and Alexandria, swinging her book bag back and forth as she - they - waited for Terry. She scoffed laughingly to herself; the sly little snake charmer was probably smooth-talking his way through this this very second. Lo and behold, not five minutes later, Terry emerged from the principal's office, looking happy as a clam. They pushed off the wall to meet him. Ronnie caught up to him first. \"Hey, man, how'd it go?\" Terry smiled. \"Let's just say that I'm off the Doppler Radar.\" Ronnie's jaw dropped, and he stood frozen in place as Terry grabbed hold of Maggie's hand and walked ahead. Ronnie snapped back to reality when Alexandria tugged on his sleeve. He caught up to Terry and Maggie a second later. \"Wha-what do you mean? You don't have to worry about Doppler anymore? How the hell'd you pull that off?\" Ronnie attempted to interrogate Terry for a full minute before giving up. Terry stopped when they rounded a corner. \"Okay,\" he began, dropping the 'good boy' act. \"Today pretty much ruined any academic-\" \"Scholastic,\" Alexandria quietly corrected. \"Whatever. Today pretty much ruined any scholastic drive I had for school, so I'm ditching.\" Ronnie was speechless yet again. \"Wh- wha- but-\" \"Terry, you just barely got off the last time!\" Maggie interjected. \"Yeah, exactly!\" Ronnie exclaimed, finally having found his voice. \"What makes you think you're gonna get away with this?\" Maggie asked. \"That's right!\" Ronnie joined in. \"Do you seriously think you're not gonna get caught?\" \"Yeah, do you?\" \"You won't be able to charm your way out of it this time.\" \"Nope, no charm.\" \"You'll be suspended.\" \"Yep, suspension.\" \"And then you'll be held back a grade!\" \"Held back!\" \"And then your parents will be involved!\" \"You're screwed!\" \"Ronnie, that's enough.\" \"Sorry.\" Terry rolled his eyes at the both of them. \"Pssh. Please . This isn't my first time at the rodeo.\" He smirked, making his way towards the exit. \"You comin'?\" He asked, nodding his head in their direction as he held the door. Ronnie shook his head. \"No. No way, man. I got in enough trouble last time.\" Terry rolled his eyes. \"Fine, wimp out.\" Ronnie took Alexandria's hand. \"Whatever, man.\" And they walked off to their next class. Terry sighed. \"You comin'?\" Maggie smiled and took a step back, shaking her head. \"I really better get to class...\" He groaned, throwing his head back against the door. \"I'll see you after class,\" she called as she turned to follow Ronnie and Alexandria. \"I'll pick you up after school.\" He called back. Maggie turned back to give him a small wave and smile before jogging to catch up with her fellow classmates. A/N: This chapter is kinda long too, so I'm splitting it into 2 separate chapters :P ...Well. Actually this is an extremely uneven spot to split it up, but you'll see why in the next chapter...I think. Lol. Terry gets sweet in the next chapter, so be sure not to skim, at least not the last half :)[Chapter 20] A/N: In THIS chapter: Terry cruises, eats, and browses, and Maggie gets a surprise. Disclaimer: I do not own Drillbit Taylor. Or GameStop. Or Dead Space. OR Left4Dead :P Chapter 20: Gift~ Terry hopped into his Mustang and started the engine. He wasn't really sure where he was going, but he knew one thing: it wasn't school. He'd probably just cruise around town, maybe get a bite to eat. It was kind of funny, actually. He had come here in the highest of spirits, the best of attitudes, and if he was gonna learn anything it might as well have been today. But then that jock-head went and ruined it all. Just like that. Asshole. Terry shook his head as he pulled out of the school parking lot. He really needed to calm down. He turned on the radio, noticing the time. Well, he had a good three hours to do so. Part of him felt bad for leaving Maggie behind. Should he have stayed? Terry waited at a light as he contemplated the answer. Nah. She'd understand. The light turned green, and he made a left turn, on the way to town. He decided to chill for awhile. What's more relaxing than being surrounded by hundreds of people, looking at stuff you can't buy for three hours? Terry felt for his wallet as he drove. Well, maybe the 'can't buy' part wasn't completely definite... When Terry arrived at the mall, the first thing he did was eat. He hadn't swallowed a bite of food at lunch, thanks to 'Brian'. He scarfed down a sub, but he was still hungry, so he got himself a pizza. He ate a bit slower this time, since he still had a good two hours to blow. After he was done, he tossed the remains of his meal into the nearest trash can and headed to the closest store, which happened to be an antique shop. Needless to say, he wasn't in there long. Terry then proceeded to skip from store to store, finding nothing he really liked enough to get. He thought of Maggie as he passed a girly store. Maybe he should get her something...? He took another look at the store, taking in all its pink and sparkly glory. ... Hell no. Terry liked Maggie -loved her, even - but this was just too much. He drew the line at Wanda's Wonders. Besides, Maggie was too mature for all that 'girly' crap. He needed to go somewhere a bit more sophisticated, like...Victoria's Secret. He spotted his desired destination. Oh, look, they were having a special! The motion sensor beeped as Terry walked in. Wow, there were a lot of people here. And quite a few of them were men...eh, shopping for their wives, no doubt. He hadn't been browsing for more than two seconds before a perky young saleswoman approached him. \"Hello, how are you today?\" She beamed. Terry, a little taken aback, replied, \"Uh...good...\" He started to walk away when she spoke again. \"Are you looking for anything in particular? Maybe for a certain someone?\" She winked, as if it were some big secret. No, he was here for himself. Duh . \"Uh, yeah actually. What do you got?\" Her face lit up. \"Well, everything in our store is 40% off today, and we have a very wide selection of lingerie,\" ha! Maggie would never! Still...40% off...\"bath salts,\" nah. \"Makeup,\" he'll pass. \"And jewelry.\" A necklace wouldn't be a bad idea, but Maggie didn't wear jewelry. Or did she? He'd never seen her wear any... The saleslady continued. \"We also have-\" \"Uh, look, do you have anything...conservative?\" She blinked. Terry tried again. \"Uh, you know...subtle? I'm just looking for a simple gift.\" Cheap was more like it. Her eyebrows lifted. \"Oh, well have you seen our Pink collection? That's about as subtle as it gets.\" Aaaaaand he was supposed to know what the hell that was? \"Um...sure, where is it?\" \"Right this way!\" She smiled, motioning for him to follow. The woman led him to a small shelved area near the back of the store. There were rows upon rows of various articles of clothing, from socks, to sweatpants, to tank tops to jackets, all of which had the word 'Pink' on them. \"Is this what you wanted?\" The sales lady asked. \"Yeah, thanks.\" He replied, eager for her to leave. She smiled, and upon hearing the motion sensor beep again, walked off to greet another victi- er, customer. Terry stared at his options, running a hand over the different fabrics and briefly skimming the sizes...wait, sizes?! Crap, he didn't know what size she was! He had heard of this from other guys; dude walks in, wanting to get something for his girl, buys some clothes, walks away happy, feeling pretty proud of himself, and then when he gives said gift to girl, and she gets her panties in a wad because he got 2 sizes too big. Or too small. Yeah. That was not going to happen to him. Terry loitered around the clothing section for a few more minutes so that it didn't seem like a complete waste of time to the saleswoman eyeing him like a hawk, before finally deciding to leave. He was almost home-free when the same sales lady flagged him down again. \"Did you find what you were looking for?\" she asked cheerily. Terry suppressed a sigh as he turned around to face her. \"Uh, you know...I just didn't see anything she woulda liked,\" he replied as nicely as possible. \"Okay. Have a nice day!\" She called. He gave her a tight-lipped smile as he walked out. He was so done with this place, lingerie be damned. He checked his watch. 2:43. He still had time to hit one more place. As he looked up, a video game store caught Terry's eye. Bingo. \"Back already?\" Came the amused voice of the GameStop employee, Chad. Terry had recently bought the latest Grand Theft Auto from here, and he was no stranger to the workers. This place was one of his usual stops, and he daresay he was a regular here. \"Actually, I wanna get something for my girlfriend,\" Terry explained. Chad gave a sly smirk. \" Oohh , I see. So what does she like? Adventure? Strategy? FPS?\" He was going to go with his gut on this one. \"Uh, she's really into action games. You know, the violent kind, kinda scary?\" Chad smiled perversely. \" Ohhh , I know what you need...\" He led Terry over to a shelved corner, briefly searched for what he was looking for, and handed him a game. Terry looked it over. \"Dead Space?\" \"I know it might not seem like it, but you'd be surprised at how many chicks dig this game,\" Chad explained. Upon seeing Terry's doubtfulness, he backtracked. \"OR, if you wanna play with your lady, then I recommend this.\" He handed him another game. Left4Dead. \"Zombies are all the rage right now, and if she doesn't like it, I don't know what to say.\" On a whim, Terry decided to go with Dead Space. \"Nice,\" Chad praised, ringing him up on the register. \"$23.95.\" Terry shoved the money into his hands. \"Alright, here ya go,\" Chad handed him his bag. Terry snatched it up and walked off. \"Come back soon!\" He just kept walking. Once he was out of there, Terry stopped by a fast food place to buy Maggie a burger. While he was waiting in line he checked the time. 3:30?! Had he seriously screwed around that long? It was gonna take him at least a other fifteen minutes to get back to school! Maggie was probably wondering where the hell he was at, maybe even thought he'd ditched her! The line moved quickly, and Terry hastily ordered and paid for his food before practically dashing for his car and speeding back towards McKinley. Maggie sat on the school steps, cradling her face in her hands. She had sent her mother a text about Terry driving her to school, and she had agreed he could take her to and from McKinley, but they could only go 'out' once a week. It seemed like a good setup. Now, of course, with Terry nowhere to be seen, she wasn't so sure. She was gonna be mad if he'd forgotten about her, and she really didn't want to have to call her mom back and ask her to pick her up. It certainly wasn't going to look good to her parents when she got home an hour late on the first day. No, sir. But it was nearly an hour after school. It was cold, and the sun would be going down soon. Maybe she- Maggie's doubts were lifted as she saw a black Mustang pull into the school parking lot. She sighed, getting up and dusting herself off as she grabbed her book bag and trotted up to him. The window rolled down to reveal Terry's smug face. \"Miss me?\" He grinned, reaching over and opening the passenger door for her. Maggie rolled her eyes, smiling as she got into the car. \"You do realize it's been an hour since school let out?\" Terry sucked on his teeth. \"Which, is exactly why...I got you this,\" he dove his hand into a brown paper bag as he drove with his wrist, digging out a burger and tossing it to her. Maggie caught it with ease, briefly inspecting it before unwrapping it in her lap. \"Three whole hours for a burger, huh?\" She feigned suspicion as she sunk her teeth into the double-stack. \"Yeah, but you still love me, right?\" Maggie took out her phone, still chewing as she replied, \"We'll see.\" Terry glanced, if not a little nervously, at her - more specifically, her phone - before turning his attention back to the road. \"Who you textin'?\" \"My mom. I'm telling her I'm at your place right now. You know, since you're an hour late?\" He put a hand up in defense. \"Hey, that sales lady was very persistent-\" \"Sales lady? I thought you were getting me a burger.\" She smirked. It was silent after that. ... ... ... \"...Well I didn't say that was all I did...\" \"Mhm...\" She took another bite. The sun was setting by the time Terry pulled into his driveway. They were both unbuckling themselves when Maggie accidentally dropped the wrapper to her burger. \"Woops.\" As she leaned over to pick it up, she noticed a bag peeking out from underneath her seat. \"What's this?\" She asked, reaching down to pick it up. Terry knew exactly what it was. It was the GameStop bag. Panicking, Terry moved his leg over and forcefully kicked it further under the seat. \"What's what?\" Maggie looked at him, flabbergasted. \"Wha-what?!\" \"What?\" \"The...thing!\" \"What thing?\" \"The thing you just shoved under the seat!\" \"Maggie, all I see is the floor.\" \"...You're unbelievable.\" \"Damn right you love me.\" Terry brought Maggie inside, and he was finally able to appreciate how clean the place was, aside from the broken railing. Maggie had done a pretty damn good job. Now he was really glad he'd bought her that gift. It was the least he could do, considering she didn't even live here. \"You're welcome.\" Maggie said simply, as though reading his mind. She walked past him to the kitchen, no doubt to throw away her trash. Terry walked into the living room and over to the television. In the 4.5 seconds it took him to get there, his world shattered. There, laying on the coffee table, broken, battered and bruised, was the Xbox 360 Elite. Damnit. He'd totally forgotten. So much for Grand Theft Auto... \"Something wrong?\" Asked Maggie as she walked into the living room. Upon seeing the object his attention was focused on, she slowly backed away. \"Right...sorry.\" And she left him to mourn in peace. After a few moments of silence, Terry went out to his car to retrieve Maggie's gift from under the seat, stuffed it in his jacket, then went in search of Maggie. He found her in his room. She was standing at his bedside, a bundle of sheets in one hand and her phone in the other. \"You know, you really should make your bed...\" she said absent mindedly as she pressed buttons on her phone. Terry walked up and snatched the covers out of her hand. \"Gimme that...\" he mumbled. \"That was my mom,\" Maggie said, gesturing to her phone. \"I should probably go...\" she motioned to the door. \"...Oh.\" he said, dropping the sheets. \"Yeah,\" she said, giving a lopsided smile. Awkward silence... \"Uh, hey. I'll walk you out.\" Terry offered. That was something boyfriends did, right? ...Right?! Maggie shrugged. \"Okay.\" Right. Terry stepped in front of Maggie to open the door for her. \"Well, I'll see you tomorrow, then...\" Holy shit that was lame. Of course he would see her tomorrow, they went to the same school. \"Duh,\" she mocked, rolling her eyes. They both laughed. Dammit, he felt like such a nerd... \"Bye.\" Maggie waved, stepping in front of him to leave. Feeling the need to un-dorkify himself, Terry decided to do something spontaneous. Before she even had one foot out the door, he grabbed hold of Maggie's sleeve, spun her around, and (a bit more forcefully than intended) kissed her. It was kinda clumsy and a little awkward, but it had the desired effect. Maggie's eyelashes fluttered as she opened her eyes, surprise evident on her face. \"Uh...wow, um...\" As she stuttered for something to say, Terry slipped the GameStop bag into her book bag. \"Bye,\" he smirked. She smiled back, somewhat nervously, as if she wasn't sure what he was going to do next. \"...Bye.\" And she left. Maggie plopped down on her bed, exhausted from the day's events. So much had happened...it was then that she noticed the absence of someone. Two someones. Maggie took out her cellphone, debating on whether or not to call up Rachel. In the end she decided not to. She was worn out, and Rachel could be a bit of a motor-mouth. Besides, she'd see her tomorrow. Setting her phone on her bed stand, Maggie sat up to move her book bag. As she moved to place it beside her bed, she heard something fall out of the side pocket. Curious, she reached down to pick it up, thinking it was a notebook. She was quite surprised to find not a notebook, but a bag. A GameStop bag. Hey...it was the same bag she'd found under her seat in Terry's car! Maggie dug inside the bag, pulling out a single game: Dead Space. Huh. Not a bad pick. As she began to ungracefully tear off the packaging, a thought struck her: How did he know she had a 360? ...Oh, well. She tossed the thought aside, continuing to work on the case. Once the plastic was off, Maggie opened the it up and stared at the disc. As much as she wanted to play it, she needed to do homework. And sleep...she'd mess with it later. She set the case down next to her phone, smiling when she thought of Terry going out of his way to buy something for her. She'd have to thank him tomorrow... Terry stood in his bedroom, thinking of Maggie. He wondered if she'd found his gift yet. Probably. Well, he hoped she liked it. If she didn't, he was going to march right back up to GameStop and punch 'Chad' right in the face. Maybe. In the midst of his angry musings, a panicked thought suddenly hit him. What if she didn't even have a 360?! What if it was a PS3? Or a classic Xbox? Or worse... a Wii?! What if he'd just bought a game for a console she didn't even have?! She'd think he was insensitive and incapable of shopping on his own, and then she'd say he didn't pay enough attention to her... In the middle of his panic attack, Terry was hit with another thought: wait a second. Maggie wasn't like that. She'd understand. She knew it was the thought that counted. He had nothing to worry about. It was too late now, anyway. Letting out a breath of exasperation, Terry grabbed a handful of his bed sheets. He really should make his bed... A/N: Yeah, this is probably my least favorite chapter in the whole story. Not because of the idea or what happened or anything, but because I just couldn't quite get it to how I wanted it. Idk. But anyway, I hope you enjoyed a sentimental Terry, even if it was kinda sorta really OOC ^^ I don't know what kind of sales Victoria's Secret has, if any. I've never shopped there, and I'm not even entirely sure the Pink brand belongs to them, so I apologize if I was inaccurate there :P Danny and Rachel return in the next chapter, and we're back on to the funnies! ( '-')/[Chapter 21] A/N: In THIS chapter: Maggie reunites with Rachel and Danny, Rachel asks questions, Terry gets annoyed, and Maggie and Terry share a moment. Disclaimer: I do not own Drillbit Taylor. Chapter 21: Moment~ The next day started out much the same as the one before. Maggie woke up, got dressed, ate, brushed her teeth, and headed out to walk the short distance to Terry's house to wait for him to come outside and drive her to school. He sped ahead of everyone on the way there, and she took note that he seemed to always drive at least five miles over the speed limit. They walked up the steps leading to the entrance together, and sat near each other just like they had before, and Maggie hoped (for everyone's sake, really) that the gossip and hype of yesterday had died down, and that she could be left to study and listen in peace. Unfortunately, she was only half right. Although she didn't have to deal with the stares and jeers of the day previous, Maggie still had the distinct feeling that they were talking about her behind her back. There was still gossip, it was just hushed, whispered. Whether they did this because they felt sorry for her and wanted to give her some space, or because they were afraid of being punched out by Filkins, she didn't know. But she was still happy for the quiet- \"Oh my gosh, it's her!\" Never mind. Lunch came around, just like the day before, only there was no tripping or punching involved. She sat with Terry and Ronnie and Alexandria, just like the day before, and- \"Maggie!\" And that's where the similarities end. Maggie blinked, mouth full of pudding, her head snapping upwards at the sound of her name, hair whipping about her face. \"Ow, wha- hey!\" Oh, and Ronnie's. Her eyes scanned the area, looking for the source of the voice amidst the hundreds of faces in the cafeteria. She had searched for about 1.2 seconds before her eyes landed on Rachel, one hand waving wildly about the air, the other holding her food tray, while Danny stood apologetically behind her. Swallowing, Maggie gave her a half-wave, smiling back. She watched bemused as Rachel excitedly grabbed Danny by the arm and began dragging him over to their table. As they bobbed and weaved in and out of other student's way, Maggie turned to Terry and nudged him, gently, in the ribs, letting him know they had company coming. Even though she was sure he knew they were her friends, Terry certainly didn't bother to hide the obvious look of disdain on his face as he eyed their new visitors- Danny gave a friendly nod in Maggie's direction as they sat down. Or the obvious glare sent Danny's way. As expected, a somewhat awkward silence ensued. And, as also expected with Rachel at the table, said silence lasted for about two seconds. \"Ohmygosh, WHY haven't you talked to us since the party?\" This was going to be a long day. Not for Maggie, of course. She was used to, and even enjoyed, Rachel's constant, sometimes incessant babble. No, it was Terry she was worried about. He wasn't an introvert by any means, and he could always hold a conversation, but he wasn't one for unnecessary words. Or, in this case, unnecessarily annoying questions. This, of course, didn't stop Rachel from asking said annoying questions. \"So you guys are together now?\" An annoyed sigh came from Maggie's right. She'd better do all the talking. \"Yes.\" \"When? The night of the party?\" The sound of a plastic spoon stabbing mashed potatoes. \"Yes.\" Rachel gasped. \"Did you stay the night?\" The spoon snapped. \"...Yes?\" Another gasp, this time longer and more drawn out. \"OH. MY. GOSH.\" By now, Maggie could practically feel Terry silently seething beside her. She could have sworn she saw a vein pop somewhere in his forehead, but that could have just been her peripherals messing with her. One thing was certain: she was treading on extremely dangerous ground now. At this point she wasn't sure who he would be angrier with; Rachel for asking such personal questions, or her for giving such personal answers. Either way, this ship was sinking. Fast. And this conversation needed to change course even faster. It was very obvious how uncomfortable everyone was getting. Leave it to Maggie to save the day. Just as Rachel began asking another (most likely intimate) question, Maggie cut her off. \"Um, Rachel, do you wanna come over after school?\" Rachel seemed to consider this, and Maggie knew she had successfully sidetracked her. \"Mmm...okay, sure.\" The entire table breathed a sigh of relief. The rest of lunch seemed to consist mainly of small talk between Ronnie and Danny, Rachel sending knowing looks towards Maggie, Terry sending murderous looks towards Danny, and the ever present sounds of chewing. More or less. Either way, Maggie was immensely happy she was able to successfully change the topic of conversation. Disaster avoided. She still didn't want to have to deal with Terry, though. She could tell from his rigid posture and forced expression of indifference that he was still brooding from earlier. And she knew she was going to catch some kind of heat for it, whether she liked it or not. So, of course she was hesitant in getting up from her seat to trot off to their next class when lunch ended. But she couldn't escape. She prolonged it as long as possible; she was the last to get up, the last to throw away her trash, the last to turn in her tray, and the last one out of the cafeteria. But she found herself out in the hallway with Filkins all too soon. She sighed deeply to herself. She really would prefer to deal with this when he wasn't angry, but Terry was too stubborn for that. Oh, well. Rolling her eyes, Maggie steeled herself. Bring it. Oddly enough, Terry never brought it up. He didn't speak at all, actually, the entire time they walked to class. Was he still mad? Had she just dodged a bullet? Was this unexpected silence good? Was it bad? Did it mean he was thinking? Did it mean he was trying his hardest not to blow up on her? ...Did it mean anything?! As Maggie began going into hyperdrive, they reached the door leading to Ms. Zachey's english class. Just as she reached out to grab the door handle, Terry stopped her. She was sure he was going to say something - he obviously looked like he wanted to - but he didn't. After a few seconds of watching him struggle to open his mouth, Terry gave up. He sighed, exasperated, and muttered a lame, \"Here...\" he shook away her hand and opened the door for her. Maggie couldn't help looking at him strangely as she stepped inside. To say Filkins was restless during english was an understatement. He was downright hyperactive. He was...whatever word meant 10 times as much as restless did. He just couldn't keep still. Whether it was drumming his fingers on his desk an infinite amount of times, tapping his feet on the tile floor repeatedly, or hitting the end of his pencil against his notebook over and over again, he just couldn't manage to just sit his ass down. He did that when something was bothering him, become restless. But never like this. He was usually able to hide it better, too. But he was so obvious in his actions that Ms. Zachey actually called him out on it. \"Mr. Filkins, do you have to go to the bathroom?\" The nerve of that woman! A few of the students were brave enough to snicker, so Terry answered Ms. Zachey's question with his famous don't-piss-me-off tone, reserved specifically for occasions like this. \"No, Ms. Zachey. I'm just really looking forward to meeting up with some of my friends after school.\" That shut them up. \"Okaaaay...\" Ms. Zachey replied suspiciously, walking back over to the blackboard. And class went on. Unfortunately, it went on horrendously slow for Terry. ...Gah, he just couldn't stop thinking about what happened at lunch! The gall of that...that...Maggie was his girlfriend, Goddammit! No matter what he did, he just couldn't keep his mind from wandering back to that Godforsaken cafeteria. And whenever he did he thought about that little nitwit. And he got angry. Very angry. And when he got angry, he seethed. He couldn't help it. It was just the way he was. Terry was glad to be sitting behind Maggie. He really didn't want her to see him like this. Granted, it was a bit late for that. But he was practically coming apart at the hinges, here! He was ready to Hulk out and start flipping tables and...shit like that. As he sat in his chair trying to calm himself, Terry was seriously wishing he would've just told her what the hell was bothering him. It would have been so much easier. But nooo, he had to think of her feelings and bring those into play. He had to keep his mouth shut because he didn't want her to 'worry' or 'get mad'...or...any of those other things girls did. Terry let out an angry huff, looking up to stare at the clock. 12:30. Damn. And so, throughout the rest of McKinley High's school hours, Terry (for lack of a better word) brooded. He looked at the apples sitting on the teacher's desk, which made him think about food, which made him think about lunch, which made him think about cafeterias, which made him think about what happened at lunch which made him think about a certain one of Maggie's 'friends' which made him think about how annoying they were which made him think about stupid, dumb, oblivious, clueless, ignorant, lame, dorky, retarded people which made him think about how angry he was which oh God yes, was that the bell? The second class was over, Filkins was out of there. He didn't bother waiting for Maggie; he needed to cool down a bit, anyway. He was sitting in his car, deep in thought, when she finally caught up to him. She tapped on the passenger side window, and he almost jumped out of his skin before recovering and unlocking the door to let her in. Though she seemed perfectly happy, he could tell that she was going to ask him about what he was going to say earlier. Not that he minded. He had to get this shit off his chest, anyway, it was practically eating him alive. They sat together in silence, comfortably at first. But it soon turned awkward. And by 'soon' he meant about five seconds. Well, screw this. If she wasn't going to talk, he was. Turning towards Maggie, Terry was the first to speak. \"I don't want you hanging around Danny ,\" he said the name with disgust, \"anymore.\" She looked at him like he had just come out of nowhere. Opening and closing her mouth for a few seconds, it took her a bit to reply. \"I-I...wha-what? why?\" She finally managed to stutter, sounding completely confused. Now it was Terry's turn to stutter. \"I...you...wha- are you shitting me? He was eyeballing you like a freaking hawk at lunch! How could you not notice?!\" Maggie turned away, staring at the dashboard in thought. She turned back to him. \"Wait, so this isn't about Rachel?\" Now he was confused. \"Who?\" She gave him a look. \"Rachel? The girl that wouldn't stop talking?\" Oh. Her. Was that her name? \"What? No. Why would it be?\" \"Well, at lunch. She was asking all those questions and...\" Terry put in his key to start the car, looking away from her. \"...and...you know...she said-\" His head snapped back in her direction. \"What? What did she say?\" Upon realizing just how clueless he was on this subject, Maggie promptly shut her mouth. \"Nothing,\" she said hurriedly, buckling her seatbelt. Oh, hell no. Now he was interested. \"Maggie.\" She ignored him, instead focusing on tightening her seatbelt. \"Maggie.\" Still nothing. What the hell was it? Had he really been so focused on breaking Danny's neck that he didn't notice whatever this 'Rachel' person said? Reaching over, Terry snapped his fingers in front of her face. \"Maggie!\" That got her attention. Now back to business. \"What did she say?\" \"Nothing! It's nothing, just forget about it.\" \"Hell no! Now what did that little-\" He never got to finish his sentence, because the next thing he knew Maggie's lips were pressed softly against his. After a few seconds, she pulled away, a small smile gracing her features. All thoughts of Rachel flew out the window. \"What was that for?\" He asked, confused. She smiled laughingly. \"For the game , you idiot.\" She playfully slapped his arm. \"Thanks.\" She finished sincerely. So she did like it...sweet. \"Oh, well...\" God, he hadn't said this in years, \"you're welcome.\" She stared at him lovingly, and he couldn't help but think of how sweet she was when she was sentimental. And that's when the thought of Rachel flew right back through the window like a boomerang and hit him right in the head. \"Now what did she say?\" And just like that, Maggie's smile dropped like a sky-diver with no parachute. Turning away, she threw her hands up. \"OH, my GOSH!\" \"What? I just want to know what the hell she said! Why is that such a big deal?\" \"We had a moment.\" \"A moment?\" \"Yes, a moment. We were having a moment and you ruined it.\" \"Oh. What a shame.\" \"Jerk.\" \"Secret-keeper.\" \"Underachiever.\" \"Overachiever.\" \"Just start the car.\" \"Just tell me what she said.\" \"I'll tell you later, now let's just go!\" \"...\" \"...What?\" \"...I got nothin'.\" She laughed, and he started the car. A/N: Just so you know, the next chapter takes place on the same day as this. Just saying.[Chapter 22] A/N: In THIS chapter: Rachel interrogates Maggie. Disclaimer: I do not own Drillbit Taylor. Chapter 22: Sleepover~ When Maggie got home that day, Rachel was already there waiting for her. The moment they finished eating dinner, Rachel all but dragged Maggie upstairs to her bedroom so she could spill her guts to her. After she had explained everything and answered all questions known to man about such things, Rachel didn't dare hide her excitement. \"OH, my, gosh! I cannot believe you spent the night at Filkins' house!\" She gushed. \"How is he?\" Maggie's eyes widened. \"Um...I'm not sure what you mean...\" \"Oh, don't be such a pervert,\" Rachel waved her off. \"I mean how is he? You know? To be around?\" Oh. She could answer that. \"He's nice...enough. I mean, he's a little rough around the edges, but-\" \"Eek!\" \"He's a good person...deep down, anyways.\" \"Eek!\" \"...Could you...stop that, please?\" \"EEK- sorry.\" \"Girls! Time for bed!\" Maggie's mother came in, a large hamper in her arms. \"Rachel, your parents forgot your sleeping bag, so you'll have to share the bed with Maggie.\" Maggie's head whipped in Rachel's direction. \"Sleeping bag?\" Her friend just smiled. \"Yeah. Didn't you hear? I'm sleeping over!\" She winked. Maggie had to strain to keep from visibly deflating. She liked Rachel, but...URGH! She thought she was over with all the questions! \"I thought you could use some girl-time,\" her mother smiled wryly. Oh, so she was in on this too, huh? She should have known. \"Oh...\" was all she could muster in reply. Silence... \"Well, have fun, girls.\" Maggie watched as her mother picked up a few stray articles of clothing lying around in her room, tossed them into the hamper she was carrying, and left, shutting the door behind her. That night was spent gossiping, talking, giggling (on Rachel's part) and snoring. And as she stared at the clock on her nightstand, watching the minutes tick by, Maggie was sure she wasn't going to get a wink of sleep before school. A/N: A really short chapter, I know. Surprising, isn't it? Well that's because this was actually a part of chapter 21, as was the next chapter. I just wanted to shorten it. So the next chapter will be another shorty, but it's not really important, so if you'd rather just go ahead and skip to the finale, go right ahead, you won't miss anything ;)[Chapter 23] A/N: In THIS chapter: Maggie has a surprise run-in with the boys, MaggiexFilkins becomes old hat, and the school eventually moves on. Disclaimer: I do not own Drillbit Taylor Chapter 23: Acceptance~ The rest of the week was a blur, but on Friday something mildly interesting happened. Maggie had just come out of the bathroom when she noticed someone (well, someones ) approaching her. It was Wade. And Ryan. And Emmit was trailing not far behind. She wondered what they wanted, if anything, so she stood and waited as they caught up to her. As they came to stand in front of her, Wade spoke. \"Thanks...for...getting rid of Filkins.\" \"Pssh. Shackin' up with him's more like it...\" Ryan interjected, earning a swift elbow to the ribs. Emmit stepped forward. \"What my friends are trying to say, is that we're truly grateful ,\" he gave Ryan a look, \"for getting Filkins off our backs.\" Maggie smiled. \"You're welcome.\" She could have said more, but she didn't. She could have told them they had their whole lives ahead of them, that they could have - would have - stopped Filkins if she had never even been there, moved here, never existed. She could have told them that it was silly and that they didn't have to live in fear of an 18 year old boy, but she didn't. Instead, she just smiled. And so did they. No more words were needed. As the week ended, Maggie also noticed the absence of Mr. Taylor and the mysterious substitute teachers. No one mentioned them, no one gossipped. There wasn't even any talk among the staff or faculty, or the janitor. It was almost as if they'd been wiped from the face of the Earth. Rachel told her at lunch that day that Mr. Taylor (along with the other substitutes) had disappeared altogether, without so much as a resignation. Ronnie told her that he had seen him down by the beach on the way to school, and that he was homeless. And then, of course, there was all of the general speculation among the rest of the students. She probably never would know the hows or whys of this school. As the days passed, and as she spent more and more time with Filkins and Ronnie and Alexandria (who she was now good friends with) she began to notice the change in the rest of the students. They no longer regarded her as a loser or a slut. And after a while, she didn't have to deal with hostile stares as she walked down the hall to her locker, or clutch her books extra tight so the little bastards didn't 'accidentally' knock them out of her hands. Nope. After about a week or so of being together, she and Filkins were old hat. Hey, did you hear? Filkins is going out with someone! Oh, yeah, I heard that. With that short girl? Where have you been , man? And so on, and so forth. And course, this could only mean one thing, and one thing only: they were becoming accepted. And that was alright with her. A/N: I thought it would be kinda sorta sweet to have the boys (Wade, Emmit, Ryan) have one last interaction with Maggie, if only to say thank you. Anyway, don't let me keep you. Go ahead and click/tap/push that button for the ending! :D[Chapter 24] A/N: This chapter takes place on ThanksGiving , even though if you do the math I'm sure we're far past that date XD Ignore it and just read lol. Disclaimer: I do not own Drillbit Taylor. Or Charlie Brown. Chapter 24: Thanks~ The Lovelace household buzzed with life. People talked, gossipped, chattered, and joked. The sounds of laughter, and clattering plates, and utensils hitting the tablecloth as mothers and daughters bustled to and from the kitchen to set the table. The smells of hot, steaming, mouthwatering food as all of the different armoas filled the house. It was ThanksGiving, and Maggie couldn't be happier. She loved seeing all of her distant relatives, catching up on the latest news of the family. She didn't usually participate in any of the conversation, but she loved hearing and observing her mother and father as they interacted with everyone. Mom's conversations: Hey, guess what? Aunt Jodie's having a baby! Really? No way, I thought her and Gordon were getting a divorce! Well, things are better now. From what I hear, things are going great. They're going to Maui next week, you know . No! Dad's conversations: Hey, Rick, how's it goin'? It's going good, man, thanks for asking. I finally got that motor running. Really? I thought you said that thing was a piece of junk and you were getting rid of it. Wife changed my mind. She said I needed a hobby after my hip replacement. Oh. Yeah, I hear ya. Surgery's a real downer. And so on and so forth. Maggie loved seeing all of her aunts and uncles and grandmas and grandpas and cousins. And it wasn't because they always brought gifts, either. They hardly ever saw each other, so it was always twice as exciting to see what was happening in everyone's lives, and Maggie always kept track from year to year. But this year was different. Not because cousin Annie and cousin Marilyn were best friends again after three long years, or because Uncle Earl couldn't make it this year, but because she had Terry. Yes, they were still together after all this time, and Terry was on good enough terms with Maggie's parents that they let him stay over for ThanksGiving. She hadn't had the chance to spend much time with him today, though; Maggie's aunts (well, great aunts) practically dragged him away the second he walked in the door. And that was a good half-hour ago. For all she knew they were still fawning over him. As expected, he got on perfectly well with the old ladies. With his boyish face and general 'angel' persona, it wasn't long (like, 5 seconds) before Terry was pulled away to chat within the inner circles of the elders of the family. Maggie had no qualms with this, instead finding it rather cute (not to mention funny). If anything, she was glad. At least now she wouldn't have to explain all of the drama and inner workings of her weird family. Maggie sat on the couch watching Charlie Brown's ThanksGiving, enjoying the all-around happiness and warm glow the house was wrapped in. She loved this time of year... Just then, she felt a pair of arms slowly encircle her neck, hugging her from behind the sofa. \"Hey, dinner's about to start,\" Terry said, kissing the side of her head. \"You finally manage to get away from your fan club?\" She laughed, looking behind him at the group of old ladies gathered around the corner, watching in delight. \"Well, you can't have me all to yourself. My people await.\" He joked, sending a charming smile at aunt Edna. Maggie sputtered in laughter. \"Okay, dude, that's quite enough. I think you're a bit high on your horse, there.\" Terry kissed her ear. \"You know you love me,\" he teased. He stood up, Maggie following. \"C'mon,\" he said. \"Supper's ready-\" \"EVERYONE! SUPPER'S READY!\" Her mother all but screamed. He shrugged. \"See?\" Maggie chuckled and rolled her eyes, taking his hand as he led the way to the dining room. As everyone seated themselves to say Grace, Maggie looked around the table. Everything was so perfect. All of her relatives were here - save for Uncle Earl - everyone was in fairly good health, everyone was happy, and now she had someone to share it all with, if only for a little while. She was honestly surprised they had made it this far together. Everyone was, really. Her friends, her parents, her school. Everyone. Even herself. She had often wondered how long it would last. Would it be a week? A day? A month? How much more time did they have together? Would they still be with each other by the end of the day? Of the month? Of the year? What if this was all they had left? What if something happened the very next day that split them apart? What if his parents didn't approve? Of her? Of them? She would worry herself over these little things at the end of every other day, just as she was doing now. But she didn't have to worry, her mind told her. You both have a good thing going right now. So what if it ends today? Tomorrow? Next year? At least by then you will have both lived this out to its fullest potential, and you can lean back on all the great memories later. That counted for something, didn't it? Her rational mind was right, of course. They were still in high school, for Pete's sakes! They shouldn't be worrying about long-term relationships! They should both just ride it out for as long as they can, and enjoy it while it lasts. But that didn't stop her from worrying, anyway. As Maggie stared at the tablecloth under her dinner plate, she felt someone grab hold of her hand. She looked up to meet Terry's eyes. He was smiling at her. He squeezed hand, quelling any fears that had been previously playing in her head. Aunt Darla, who was sitting to her left, grabbed hold of her other hand. Everyone bowed their heads. Yeah, she reasoned with herself. There was every reason to worry. But there was also every reason not to. She had to focus on the happy. On the now . And right now, everybody was happy. \"Terry, would you like to say Grace?\" Never mind. End. A/N: Woo! It's FINALLY DONE! :D I wanted to keep this chapter under 1,000 words and I DID IT! As long as you don't count these Author's Notes, lol. I hope this ending was good enough for you. If not, then I apologize, but don't expect it to change cuz I can't think of nothin' else lol XD Anyway, I hope you enjoyed this story, at least a little bit ^^ But then again if you didn't, then how the heck did you get all the way up here?! XD Oh, and if I missed anything or screwed something up (not just in this chapter but in the story as a whole) PLEASE tell me so I can fix it. I WILL have perfection! (*-*)/ Again, thanks to everyone who: 1. Looked 2. Faved 3. Followed 4. Read 5. Reviewed 7. Checked this out 8. Didn't check this out and accidentally clicked 9.

Suggestions are open! 'Til next time! ","Summary":" A/N: Top reasons I'm writing a Drillbit Taylor fanfiction as my first story: 1. I noticed that ther"},{"Movie":"Dumbo","Title":"Dumbo","Author":"Wyatt W. Buell","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13041741","Passage":"[Chapter 1] Coming Home Holt Farrier was waiting for the news of when his time in the war would be over. After all he knows that his time in the war is over but sadly even though he made it, he had to give up a body part: his right arm. Even though he had to lose the arm at least he's still alive surprisingly. Just then the general calls him in and what would happen next would never be the same for Holt. \"Lieutenant Holt\" the General then said \"Yes sir\" he then replied \"Your time here is over and I just want to say take care and don't do anything stupid when you get home.\" he then said \"Yes sir\" he then replied And so the next he knew he was about to head home to his children Milly and Joe. He also hoped they would be okay after being gone for so long. When he boarded the plane, he knew that since this was it, he thought he will never do this ever again. Once the plane left all he could think about being there for Milly and Joe. He also thought that since he was going to see them again, he had to make them a promise to be there for them. When the plane finally landed, Holt then saw his kids and knew if he wanted to make things right now was the time. Once he was off the plane, he then went to his kids and hugged them but even though he lost an arm his kids embraced him. They knew that since he wanted to make it up to them, he would make sure to be there for them. And they were totally fine with that. But Holt then knew something was wrong and what he didn't know was that Katie his wife was dying. So the next thing you knew they go to the hospital. And from that point forward life for Holt would never be the same.[Chapter 2] The Promise When they got to the hospital, the doctor was there waiting for Holt. \"Holt thank god you made it.\" he said to him \"Yes doc I made it what's going on?\" he then asked \"Well i'm afraid Katie has cancer and she won't be here for long. So I suggest that you go see here before it's too late.\" the doc then replied And so Holt Milly and Joe went to where Katie was and since she was too weak to get up, she had to the bed. \"Hello Katie.\" Holt then said \"Holt it's you I thought I would never see you again.\" seh then replied \"I'm sorry I couldn't be with you.\" he then said \"It's okay because I know you had to fight for what's right and i've been like this for 2 months.\" she then said \"So what did the doc say?\" he then asked her \"Well ever since my cancer came he said I won't be here any longer and also that my cancer has no cure that means this will be the last time i'll be here.\" she then replied \"Man if only there was a way to make you proud.\" he then said \"Actually Holt there is a way.\" she then said \"How? Tell me.\" he then said \"You must take care of Milly and Joe when I die.\" she then replied \"Okay because in hindsight I have to make it up to them and I will always be there for them no matter what.\" he then said \"Oh and Holt?\"she then asked \"Yes Katie anything.\" he then replied \"You're not a bad father and when i'm gone take good care of our children.\" she then said \"I will.\" he then replied And so Katie died on that very day and Holt then knew that since he made the promise he will make sure to keep that promise that he can't break.[Chapter 3] R.I.P Katie Farrier And so the funeral for Katie was about to begin and for Holt he then knew this was going to be the worst day of his life since he lost his right arm. Now most of the family came because they wanted to remember and honor Katie's memories. Most of the family will always remember her for her sweet nature being funny and always being there for those who she was with. For Holt she was the one wife that'll never be replaced at all for her kindness generosity being funny and also being there for him when he needed her the most. He will always be thankful for having her and even though this may be it at least he knows her spirit will always be there for him Milly and Joe. Also he remembered her promise that he kept and now it was clear to him that he must be there for them. And it was clear that he took the role quite seriously and always help them when they need help the most. Now you would think that life for them would get a bit easier right? Well not in Holt's case and boy does life throw him some curveballs.[Chapter 4] Struggling With Life Ever since Katie's funeral, life for Holt Milly and Joe would bet a hell of a lot harder. Milly and Joe wouldn't be able to go to school anymore because the school they go to just shutted down over disputes with the school board. As for life at home well Holt wasn't able to cover the debt for their house. Oh and even worse they could be evicted if they don't the debt covered. So let's just say life for them wasn't that easy. But what they didn't know was that help was about to take them to their home: a circus. They just didn't know it yet.[Chapter 5] Meet T.J. The very next day, Holt was about to talk to the bank about the house when all of a sudden a knock came from the door. Holt then answered the door to see who it was and once he answered the door and when he saw who it was he never knew that a black man was here for him Milly and Joe. \"Hi. Are you by chance Holt Farrier?\" he then asked him \"Why yes I am. And who are you?\" he then replied and asked him \"I'm T.J. and i'm here to let you know that you and your children will be coming with me to a circus.\" he then replied \"Wait why us?\" he then asked her \"Well it's because since we heard about what happened to Katie, we decided to help you guys and since one of our elephants is going through the same like you, we were wondering if you could help us.\" he then replied Holt then knew that since there was nothing else to, he then decided to agree to do it. \"Alright, we'll do it.\" he then said \"I was hoping you would say that.\" T.J. then replied And so with their stuff all packed they then left Kentucky for a new life and what they didn't know was that life for them was about to get a whole better.[Chapter 6] Welcome To The Circus Once they finally arrived in Florida, they then came to the circus and for Holt Milly and Joe they've never seen anything like this before. There was the big tent and plenty of cars with animals and of course the clowns and the acrobats. So in a way this circus was quite interesting. While they finally started unloading a man was waiting for them and it was The Ringmaster and he's the one who founded this circus. \"Holt Farrier how the hell are you.\" he then said \"I'm fine. I can't believe you wanted to help me and my kids.\" he then said \"Well ever since we heard about Katie's cancer I decided to do what's right: let you guys be a part of the circus.\" he then said \"Man I guess you really do care because I thought you wouldn't at all.\" he then said \"Yeah I would ignore this but I then realized you would be struggling with life. So I decided to let you and your children be there.\" he then said \"Well that's good to know.\" he then said \"Oh and that's reminds me when your done unloading I would like to talk to you in my office if you don't mind.\" he then said And so they continued to finish up unloading their stuff. Since this was their new home they might as well get used to it. Now what they didn't know was that they would help make a certain elephant a star. They just didn't know it yet.[Chapter 7] The Talk With The Ringmaster When Holt finally got done unloading he then went to see the Ringmaster. While on the way, he saw many of the animals the circus including the elephants so it was clear to him this was going to be quite interesting. Once he finally came in, he then said \"uh sir you called?\" \"Oh Holt i'm glad you came in because I wanted to talk to you about something.\" he then said \"What is it sir?\" he then asked \"It's Mrs. Jumbo.\" he then replied \"Okay and what's going on with her?\" he then asked \"It's just she hasn't been the same. Ever since she lost Mr. Jumbo in the war she's been struggling and I really don't know what we should we do about her. That is until you and your kids came and that was when I had an idea.\" he then replied \"What's your idea?\" he then asked \"I was wondering that now that you and your kids are here I was hoping you could help Mrs. Jumbo and yes I know losing Katie hasn't been so easy. But i'm sure Mrs. Jumbo will be like a mother to your children.\" he then replied \"Well we've been through a lot and since you did mention Katie sure we'll do it just because we didn't come here to be useless.\" he then said \"I was hoping you would say that and i'm glad your doing this because I really didn't know what would've happened if you never came.\" he then said And so they made an agreement to help Mrs. Jumbo and they were about to help a future star. They just didn't know it yet.[Chapter 8] Meet Mrs. Jumbo The next thing you knew Holt then got Milly and Joe. \"Wait holt what the hell do you think you're doing?\" T.J. then asked \"Well Ringmaster said that we need to be there for Mrs. Jumbo.\" he then replied \"Oh really?\" he then asked \"Yes really.\" he then replied \"Then I gotta see this.\" he then said And so the next thing you knew they were going to go see Mrs. Jumbo and hopefully it would work. Once they were near where she was, Holt went first to make sure it was okay with her. When she did see him, she really wasn't going to hurt him. She then came near him and saw what he went through and she saw the pain the fear and the loneliness in him. So it was clear to her that she to had him and his children. She then wrapped her trunk around his shoulders and it was clear that she would be there for them. For Holt he then knew she was the one he's been looking for.[Chapter 9] All Aboard 2 days later, the circus was about to load for the next show in Atlanta. The workers were getting everything all set and ready to go. All of the animals were getting loaded and they were all set. Now when it came to the elephants getting loaded was well quite a struggle. Most of them would get in easily but the Elephant Matriarch was about to come in when she got stuck. So most of the workers had to get her in and it was well quite a struggle but once they were finally able to get her in the door then shutted behind her. Once everything was all set, the ringmaster then said \"All Aboard! All Aboard!\" And so Casey Jr. then started it's trek and what would happen on the way would change everything forever.[Chapter 10] The Arrival While Casey Jr was on it's way, Mr. Stork was with the special delivery for Mrs. Jumbo. When he did see the train he then flew in to see if she was there. Of course he had a bit of trouble finding the right car but then some trunks were luring him in so he then found the car and then came in. So when he did come he then delivered the special for Mrs. Jumbo it was truly a proud moment. She then unwrapped it and it was a cute baby elephant who at first looked normal. But it then sneezed and the next thing you knew it had large floppy ears. The others would pick on it but Mrs. Jumbo was really not into it. So she then closed the top door and the next thing you knew it was peace and quiet at last. With the noise gone she then wrapped her baby around and rocked it with her trunk. Now that Dumbo was here she then knew life will find a way.[Chapter 11] Setting Up The Circus When Casey jr finally arrived in it's destination it then pressed on the brakes and it finally stopped. And so the elephants and the workers went to get the circus tent all set for the show. The elephants were to unload from the train cars and make sure the other animals were all set. Now as for Holt Milly and Joe well they were asleep during then. But not for T.J. he was working his ass off getting everything all set. Oh and it was raining but that didn't stop them at all but instead they kept going. And once they were all set their hard work really did pay off in the end. With the circus tent and all of the cars all set, it was all set for the big show.[Chapter 12] The Circus Parade By Morning with the circus tent all set the circus was about to do a parade. Now T.J.'s work earlier on meant that he could relax with Holt Milly and Joe. Meanwhile the rest of the circus and even the clowns were about to do the parade. Once the crowd gathered the parade could really begin. The crowd by the way the ringmaster came in on a horse and they laughed at the clowns. Now when the elephants came they were amazed by their size and they couldn't wait to see them in the show. As for Mrs. Jumbo she was trying to make sure Dumbo would be okay. But most of the folks saw him and he saw them and was so distracted by that so he fell in the mud. Most of the crowd would laugh at that but thankfully it was just an accident.[Chapter 13] Bath Time So when the parade was done and the circus was back, Mrs. Jumbo then gave Dumbo a much needed bath. She would make sure he was all clean and taken care of. Let's just say it would be quite special for him. Now when he was all dried up, he then started playing around and it would help Mrs. Jumbo a whole lot.[Chapter 14] Play Time He would run around and would play hide and seek. Now she would play along and for the first time since she lost Mr. Jumbo she was finally happy at last and it was truly a miracle indeed. Of course he did trip but thankfully he was okay. It was clear to Mrs. Jumbo that Dumbo was like a blessing to her because she needed some much needed company. And he was the answer.[Chapter 15] Don't Mess With The Elephants Just then a group of boys came to see the animals themselves. And T.J. was in charge to make sure they wouldn't mess with Dumbo at all. Now when they got near it, one of them almost did but T.J. stopped them and they were warned not to do it again. And thankfully they didn't ever mess with them ever again. Now as for Holt Milly and Joe they thought they could help Dumbo. But sadly one incident involving the family would change everything.[Chapter 16] Holt Learns The News It all began when the mail came and while most of it was nonsense was a letter for Holt. So Holt then grabbed it and opened it and he didn't know it yet but it would involve his family. While he was reading it he had tears in his eyes and T.J. then knew something was wrong. \"Holt you okay?\" he then asked Holt didn't even respond but he then gave T.J. the letter and when he read it, he didn't know what to say at all. \"Hey ringmaster you might want to read this.\" he then said to him The Ringmaster then read the letter and then said \"Well that's just great.\" \"So what do we do now?\" T.J. then asked \"We'll talk to Milly and Joe about this and maybe we'll figure this out. But in the meantime you go be with Holt.\" he then replied \"Yes sir.\" he then said And so he then gave Holt a bear hug and Holt embraced it. Now as for Milly and Joe when they learned of the news they also joined in on the hug. For those of you who were wondering what the letter said it was about the rest of the Farrier family and the fact that they are gone. So in a way life for them wasn't going to be easy for now that is.[Chapter 17] Meet Timothy Mouse When Mrs. Jumbo heard about the news she then decided to go comfort Holt Milly and Joe and poor Dumbo was all alone. Meanwhile the other elephants were in a circle eating hay and talking about this and that. Just then Timothy Mouse was eating the peanuts hearing their talks and getting annoyed by them. \"Man, can a mouse eat peanuts in peace?\" he then asked Then one of the elephants points to Dumbo being a F-R-E-A-K. They would also imagine what mother would ever like him just for his ears. Then Timothy then saw his ears and then said \"I don't there so bad. I think they're cute.\" Now Dumbo tried to go near them but they would completely ignore him. So he sadly walked near a pile of hay. \"Aw poor thing. Boy I oughta show those elephants who they're messing with.\" he then said[Chapter 18] Scaring The Other Elephants So he then went in their circle and when one of the elephants saw it was a mouse they then ran for it. They ran to get away from it and it's clear that they're afraid of mouses. So Timothy made sure to teach them one hell of a lesson. And boy they would definitely not mess with a mouse at all.[Chapter 19] Timothy Meets Dumbo With the other elephants taken care of, Timothy then went to go see Dumbo for himself. Now Dumbo was under the pile of hay so it was clear that he didn't want to come out. But Timothy would find a way to get him out of there. He would at first try to talk to him but he wouldn't respond. So he then grabbed a peanut or two and he hoped it would work. And it did not only would Dumbo come out of his hiding spot but he would actually be with Timothy. Just then Mrs. Jumbo went to go see if Dumbo was okay and when she saw who was able to bring Dumbo out of his hiding spot. So she decided to see who it was and she wasn't afraid of mouses.[Chapter 20] When Timothy Met Mrs. Jumbo Just then Timothy saw that Mrs. Jumbo was right there and he thought he was in trouble but really he wasn't. She then grabbed him by her trunk and wanted to see what he was like up close. \"My my what a cute little mouse you are.\" she then said \"Oh thank you no one has ever said that to me.\" he then said \"I think my son really likes you.\" she then said \"Really? Well i'm glad he does. So what's up with him?\" he then asked her \"Well he has those ears which I think they're not so bad I just wish they could be used for something special for this circus.\" she then replied \"I think those ears should be used to entertain the crowd.\" he then said \"Oh and how so?\" she then asked \"I'll find a way.\" he then replied And so he went to go see the ringmaster and what would happen next would change everything.[Chapter 21] A Crazy Idea And so Timothy then went off to go see if he's able to tell the ringmaster about his crazy idea. When he was finally in his tent, he then hid under a bed sheet and acted like a ghost. Now the ringmaster was already asleep by that point so he could only hear but not see. Timothy then said \"I may have the star you've been looking for.\" Now he did hear it but then he knew Dumbo could be the star. So when Timothy left The ringmaster had a crazy idea. So crazy that no one would ever believe that it would be possible.[Chapter 22] Pyramid Of Pachyderms When the show was already set the ringmaster then announced that with the circle of elephants all around him he then revealed what they were about to do. They would be stacked on top of each other and then Dumbo would jump to the top. Or so how the plan goes. Once the whistle came they then began the stacking and the Elephant Matriarch was on the bottom. Meanwhile the other elephants kept stacking on each other and boy from the way it's sounds it must be that crazy to have that many elephants in one. Let's just say it would be quite interesting. Anyway with the pyramid all set Dumbo was to go but he almost backed up. So Timothy poked him and off he went. But what they all didn't know was that disaster was about to come and it wouldn't be good.[Chapter 23] The Pyramid Falls While Dumbo was running his ears came loose and that would be quite a problem. Suddenly he tripped and knocked the ball where the elephants where. And the next thing you know is the whole pyramid falls. The crowd then ran for it while they could. Meanwhile most of the others ran for cover and boy they were lucky. Now Dumbo however was running for it and he then tripped and all of the elephants were all over the place. Most of them knocked out parts of the tent. Heck even the elephant matriarch took out the center pole and the whole tent fell to the ground. Dumbo then knew he was in more trouble than ever.[Chapter 24] It's Dumbo's Fault Now when Casey Jr was loaded it wasn't such a pleasant trip at all. Most of the elephants were in major pain because of what Dumbo did and they would never forgive him. In fact they were all in stitches and they were still mad at Dumbo for the Pyramid. So it was clear that they weren't happy at Dumbo at all.[Chapter 25] Poor Dumbo Meanwhile Mrs. Jumbo was worried about his son because he didn't mean to it was just an accident. She also worried that he would have to go through a horrible punishment. And she hoped he would be okay after all of this. \"God please be there for my son.\" she then said Now he and Timothy were asleep and they hoped they would be okay. So in a way they hoped it wouldn't be a harsh punishment.[Chapter 26] Dumbo The Clown Now the ringmaster would force Dumbo to be a clown and boy were most of the folks at the circus happy about it even Holt Milly Joe and T.J. weren't pleased about it. They think he doesn't deserve this at all. But he completely ignored them and so Dumbo would be a clown. When the circus show was on, Dumbo would in a burning building and one of the clowns acted like his mother but really he isn't. The other clowns would be like firefighters and they held a trampoline for Dumbo to get on. But when he fell thought he was splattered with cream. Now most of the crowd thought it was funny but Dumbo didn't think it was funny at all. In fact it was quite possible the most miserable thing ever according to him. So it was clear that he didn't deserve this at all.[Chapter 27] The Clean Up When the show was done, Dumbo then went to go get cleaned up by Timothy Mouse. While he was cleaning him up, Timothy then said to him \"Oh Dumbo I know this isn't what you wanted after the pyramid incident. Personally you don't deserve this at all.\" But Dumbo couldn't say anything and tears were flowing from his face. So it was clear that he was completely embarrassed. \"Oh Dumbo i'm sorry for this if only the ringmaster would understand that it wasn't your fault and that you didn't mean to do on purpose.\" he then said to him Just then Timothy had an idea and one that could actually work. \"Say how about we go see Mrs. Jumbo?\" he then asked him He then shook his head and that meant yes so they went ahead with that. And what they didn't know was that by seeing Mrs. Jumbo it would actually help Dumbo a whole lot.[Chapter 28] Family Bonding When Mrs. Jumbo was able to see her son she then knew he needed her more than ever. \"Oh Mrs. Jumbo.\" Timothy then said Now Holt Milly Joe And T.J. were also there because they wanted to see if Dumbo was okay. He then came to her in tears and she wrapped her trunk around his head and then said \"Oh sweetie i'm sorry you had to do this and you don't deserve this at all.\" She then gently rocked him around slowly. Now Holt then hugged his kids and they embraced him because for the first time since Katie his wife passed away it meant something more. Oh and T.J. also hugged Holt because now he could feel the pain that they've been through. Even Timothy got tears in his eyes because he knew this was quite a moment for him since he really didn't have anyone else to be with. Meanwhile the other circus animals were asleep with their babies by their side. So in a way this was quite an emotional moment for everyone. Once it was done Dumbo and Timothy would then go off and what they didn't know was that they're about to see the most fucked up thing ever imagined. But they didn't know it yet.[Chapter 29] Pink Elephants On Parade Now before Dumbo and Timothy were near a bucket the clowns were talking about how hilarious it was for them to get Dumbo covered in cream. But one of the clowns accidently knocked over his champagne and didn't even know about it at all. So when Dumbo and Timothy were near the bucket they decide to take a drink. Now at first it tasted a bit funny but once Timothy was accidently in it he was then drunk. So when he thought Dumbo could blow a big bubble he did and once it was blown it was an elephant. But then it turned pink and the next you knew it was Pink Elephants On Parade. Now not much is known on where Dumbo and Timothy would end up but let's just say it would quite the most fucked up trip ever.[Chapter 30] Where's Dumbo The next morning, most of the circus was up and getting ready for tonight's show. But there was one problem: no one knew where Dumbo was at all. Because most of them didn't even get to see him last night. So it was clear he must've flyed away from the circus. But what they didn't know was that Dumbo was alive and he would prove everyone wrong. He just didn't know it yet.[Chapter 31] The Crows Meanwhile a group of crows were seeing an elephant and a mouse high on a tree branch. They honestly have never seen anything like that ever. Just then Dumbo and Timothy woke up and fell off of the tree branch and into a puddle. The crows then laugh at them thinking that was funny. Now Timothy didn't think that was funny at all so the both of them couldn't believe they were here in the first place. Timothy then thought that Dumbo must've flyed here but with not enough evidence that's what he believed. So now they had to find a way to get back to the circus before the show. But the crows actually may have a solution.[Chapter 32] The Magic Feather Just then one of the crows would offer Timothy the magic feather and at that point it would change everything. Timothy then grabbed it and then knew it could help Dumbo a whole lot. So with help from the crows Dumbo then started to flap his ears so that he could fly. The dust would form all around him what would happen next would change everything.[Chapter 33] When I See An Elephant Fly Just then and out of nowhere, Dumbo was finally flying and it was a miracle indeed. With the crows flying with him it felt like anything was possible now that he could fly at last. So when was on a cable line it was clear that he could fly. He just had to prove that to everyone.[Chapter 34] The Miracle And so when they were able to be back at the circus that night before the show, he would have to do that stunt again. But when he was about to jump he did but as he fell he lost the magic feather he had to fly without it. So when he flew the crowd couldn't believe it at all because they've never seen like him before. Hell even the ringmaster Mrs. Jumbo Holt Milly Joe and T.J. also couldn't believe it at all. As for the clowns well they tried to drive away from it but they the crashed into a burning building and were on fire themselves. Heck Dumbo actually got his revenge on the other elephants by spewing peanuts at him. So it was clear it was the most amazing thing they've ever seen.[Chapter 35] Happily Ever After And so the word of Dumbo flying spread like wildfire and now the whole world was now fascinated by the flying elephant. Now as for the circus everyone was very proud of Dumbo for the amazing trick he did. They then knew he was truly a real flying elephant. For Holt Milly and Joe their bond got a whole lot better and T.J. would be a part of their lives. And as for Mrs. Jumbo she was truly grateful that Dumbo could do this and Timothy would be them no matter us. It goes to show that a miracle can happen if you believe in yourself. THE END.
