The second one kinda toned it down a bit, but the first one was so insane that you kinda have to respect it. Also, it was a part of my childhood. I watched it a lot when I was younger. I kinda see it differently now, but I still admire it for taking a concept and running with it. Also, I've discovered that I really like The Russian. HE should've been the main villain instead of Tinkles, even if it made no sense for him to have all those weapons and bombs in his stomach. Seriously, I love the way his character was. So cool. Anyway, here we have a story that deals with a huge point of contention I had for both movies: if cats and dogs can talk, why don't they just work with the US Government! So, yeah, this story addresses that. It also tries to tap into Kitty Galore's untapped potential, as well as showcases characters that I really enjoyed from both films. So, let's get to it! Cats & Dogs: The Revelations of the Institute Chapter 1 (Revised Version) Kitty Gets Institutionalized Location: Upper Michigan, abandoned salt mining complex The Sun beat down hot on the desolate looking area, with not a worker in sight. This was to be expected, as the salt mine had been abandoned for quite some time. However, if any human had been there at this time, they would have been in for quite a surprise. There was a light brown standard poodle of all things walking in the area. The dog hardly seemed lost, although he wore a plain looking collar and a simple metal tag that bore the name Shamus. In fact, the poodle seemed to be walking along with a predetermined purpose as he made his way towards one of the tool sheds that could be found on the premises. The dog named Shamus pulled open the door, entered the shed, and closed the door behind him. Then, he walked over to a bare spot on the far wall and put his right forepaw on it. There was beep that only a dog's ears could pick up, and Shamus removed his paw, and then he spoke: \"The solution is. . . get institutionalized .\" A trap chute opened right underneath Shamus' paws, and the poodle allowed himself to slide down a short ramp that led into a cylindrical elevator car. As the chute closed and resealed itself, and the door to the elevator car closed, Shamus remained sitting as he rode down at a swift pace deep into the ground. Location: Below Upper Michigan, formerly abandoned salt mine, currently Animal Institute of Revelations, aka A.I.R. Depth: 4000 meters (13,123.36 feet) below sea level As Shamus rode down the glass elevator, he could get a clear 360 degree view of the entire complex. It was a multi-stories wonderland of polished chrome and stainless steel. It was a vaguely cylindrical underground structure, having been built outward to fill up and expand to preexisting cavernous salt mine. Cats and dogs of a multitude of breeds were walking through corridors and across bridges on every level of the complex. Exiting and entering rooms, giving each other brief greetings before quickly going off to get back to their important work. As he passed through the middle levels of the underground complex, Shamus could spot cats and dogs on break; eating together in the cafeteria, swimming in the pool, or chasing Frisbees or lazer points courtesy of some automated machines. \"It never gets old, seeing it all like this,\" Shamus said to himself in satisfaction. Eventually, Shamus reached the bottom floor, and he exited the elevator just in time to see a female bicolor tuxedo cat approach him with a measured gait. \"Cateri, you certainly know me well,\" Shamus said, a pleasant smile on his face in response to the black and white cat's arrival, \"Whenever I leave, you're always here to meet me at the very second I return.\" \"It helps that you are always so punctual,\" Cateri replied with a pleasure that matched the poodle's, \"One could set their watch to your activity. I trust the reason for your departure has been decided in your favor.\" Shamus nodded and said, \"It certainly has. The guard dogs have agreed to our terms. Our surface agents are welcome to harvest reasonable amounts of valuable scrap from their junkyards as long as they get the anise seed we've been growing over in Bioscience. This will greatly help our long-term cause, as well as our imminent goal. . .\" After this, Shamus' tail twitched nervously, and he leaned slightly forward towards the cat as he asked cautiously, \"That is, I certainly hope that goal will be achieved imminently, that is to say. . . well. . .\" Cateri's yellow-green eyes stared deep into Shamus', which caused the dog to step back and shake his head strongly. \"Oh, stop it Cateri! I mean it, do you always have to play coy with me like this!?\" Shamus said in frustration. \"I am just waiting for you to finish your thought,\" Cateri said almost apologetically. Shamus sighed, and he asked plainly, \"Have our agents brought her in?\" \"Yes,\" Cateri replied simply. \"Exemplarily!\" Shamus said, clearly thrilled by the news, \"So the new Era is certain to be in our time! Come now! We can't leave our newest member waiting!\" In a room filled with various crates and barrels, a single pet carrier lay by itself as Cateri and Shamus approached it. The poodle led the way, and he stepped confidently towards the front of it. Bending down slightly, he peered inside and said, \"Hello there, Ms. Clawyu.\" The cat was lying facing away from the door, and she tensed up when she heard the name. Then, she uncurled herself from her resting position, and then faced what she perceived to be her captor. The hairless animal, possessing the appearance of a sphynx cat, fixed hate filled eyes upon the poodle and hissed out venomously, \"You dare use that name on me ?\" Shamus' eyes were filled with pity as he replied, \"It is your true name. But yes, I am aware that you now go by another name. . . Kitty Galore, I believe. However, you really shouldn't abandon your own name just because life has been hard on you. A name is very important, in my opinion, at least.\" Kitty Galore thrusted her snarling face against the bars of the pet carrier and said, \"Don't you dare pity me! You will never feel the way I feel; or see the way I see!\" She then backed away from the bars and huffed and puffed for a moment. Then she said coldly, \"You know what? That's it. I'm done speaking with you. Just ship me off to Alcatraz so I can break out and kill you all later, because I will, no matter what you do.\" \"We are not sending you to Alcatraz,\" Shamus said in a definite tone. Kitty Galore scoffed and said, \"Oh, fine then! I suppose you'll keep me here at D.O.G.S. for a bit so you mutts can admire their handiwork? I'm sure that guard dog got an award for making me fall into that vat of hair remover!\" Cateri finally stepped out from behind Shamus, making her presence known to the criminal, and she said, \"This is not the Canine Intelligence Service headquarters.\" Kitty Galore was surprised to see the tuxedo cat, but quickly got over her surprise and said in disgust, \"Oh, so I'm at M.E.O.W.S.! Great! More insults about how hideous I am from my own kind!\" \"You are not at the headquarters of Mousers Enforcing Our World's Safety,\" Cateri said with the utmost seriousness, \"Neither of the organizations you have mentioned neither authorized nor are aware of your capture.\" \"Then where the heck am I!?\" Kitty Galore demanded. \"A.I.R.,\" Shamus replied simply. Kitty Galore blinked and gave him a thousand-yard stare. \"What?\" \"Animal Institute of Revelations,\" Cateri rattled off. \"What?\" Kitty Galore repeated, this time sounding more annoyed than confused. \"Answer me this, Ms. Clawyu,\" Shamus said, \"Why do we animals not talk to the humans?\" Kitty Galore hissed a bit, but answered nonetheless, \"Because then the humans would know that brilliant minds like mine exist, and thus the humans would actively get in the way of any of our attempts to take over the world!\" Shamus immediately burst out laughing at this. Kitty Galore's eyes widened in surprise at first, then she shoved her face against the bars again and demanded, \"What's so funny!?\" Shamus pawed at his face as he fought to get his laughter under control. Then he finally said, \"Oh, you poor cats. . . you rant and rave about taking over the world, but you fail to realize that the endless nuances involved in running a world-wide government, even a tyrannical dictatorship, would quickly drive you insane. No one mind could handle it, yet you always want all the power for yourself. Even if you did allow others to rule alongside you, it would inevitably end in backstabbing and double-dealing-.\" Cateri interrupted him, saying, \"Shamus, you are digressing. . . again. \" Shamus' tail dropped, and his ears drooped slightly as he admitted, \"Oh yes, you're right. I must train myself to stop doing that all the time. Anyway, back to my original point. You say that animals don't talk because it would cause human to watch out for cats like you, making it harder for you to carry out your criminally insane schemes. But! What you're not seeing is that this very fact would be a reason for the dogs and cats who oppose you to talk to humans. Think about it! Had they simply contacted the US Government, you would have been promptly apprehended by a heavily armed SWAT Team. And what about the average pets that aren't part of any secret organization? Why don't they ever cry out for food in human language? Or verbally tell their human families how much they love them? Has all this simply never even briefly crossed your mind? Pretty odd, considering your superior intelligence, which I admit you do genuinely possess.\" With every sentence uttered by the light brown poodle, Kitty Galore's eyes grew wider and wider as she began to carefully consider the points he was making. Her mind chased its tail in a circle as it tried to work it all out. \"But, no. . . it's because. . . wait, they could have. . . they would have. . . but no! That's just. . . that can't be right! But it makes sense. . . but. . . how? HOW!?\" Shamus gave a curt nod and said, \"Well, it's been a pleasure talking with you, but I believe our time is about up, and I don't ever break my schedules. Right now, it's time for Kitty Galore. . . to leave.\" Suddenly, the pet carrier was being filled with a thick yellow gas, and Shamus and Cateri quickly took several steps away from it. \"What!? No!\" Kitty Galore shouted right before she went into a coughing fit due to the gas. She fell flat on her stomach and wheezed out, \"Not. . . like this. . .\" Then, she slipped into unconsciousness. As the ventilation system cleared out the gas, Shamus turned to Cateri and said with a thrilled gleam in his eye, \"It's time for the brains in Bioscience to show off what they're truly made of!\" The unconscious, hairless cat was placed on a medical table. Several cats and dogs in white lab coats were gathered around her. They quickly went to work, first taking a blood sample from the cat, and then inserting plastic tubes into her nostrils, and fitting a third specially shaped tube around her mouth. A special paste was put over her eyelids to keep them shut. A Labrador retriever took the blood sample to large metal tank with a smaller chamber connected to it. She put the blood sample into the smaller chamber, and the machinery processed the blood, extracting DNA and sequencing it, and then transferred the results into the large tank. Kitty Galore was lowered into a large glass cylinder, which was then filled with a cloudy liquid serum that came from the large metal tank. She was completely submerged in the substance, the tubes in her face allowing her to breathe. The Labrador retriever studied the data displayed on a nearby screen, and then breathed a sigh of relief. Then she turned towards the other scientists and said, \"This is a great moment for the Bioscience Team.\" At this moment, Shamus entered the lab, and he gazed at the figure suspended within the chamber. The Labrador tossed her head towards the poodle and said, \"And here he is, always showing up at the pivotal moment!\" \"That's what I do, Dr. Rona,\" Shamus replied without taking his eyes away from the chamber. \"Call me Jess,\" she replied. \"Right,\" Shamus said absentmindedly. Then, he turned to the scientists and said, \"Now. . . we wait.\" The cat found herself lying on her back on a comfortable surface. She managed to crack her eyes open, but the bright light of the room kept her from opening them up all the way. \"I see the calculations, and thus my schedule, were correct. You are awake,\" came the voice of Shamus. The cat hissed as she rolled over and got up on her paws, her eyes still closed against the brightness. Eventually, she managed to get her eyes used to the light level after blinking them a few times. She then looked around to see that she was in pet sized room that was pleasing to the eyes, albeit more on the functional side, and she was standing up on a rather nice cat bed. However, she quickly focused her attention on the poodle standing in the doorway, and she said in a dangerous tone, \"What did you do to me?\" Shamus just smiled and said, \"See for yourself. Although I'd figure you'd feel the difference first.\" The cat looked confused by this answer at first, until she realized that she did feel slightly different. To be more precise, she felt rather warm. Warmer than she had ever felt in a while. She lifted her right forepaw and placed it on her chest, and her eyes went wide at the softness she felt. Slightly scared to look, she forced herself to move her down, and the sight of pure white fur caused her to cry out in shock and direct her vision straight ahead at Shamus. Shamus pointed at the wall the cat bed was set up against and said, \"There's a mirror right there, if you have any doubts.\" The cat nervously turned to look towards the mirror Shamus had indicated. Her mind a complete blank, she forced her legs to move herself towards the mirror. She shut her eyes tightly as she approached, and then opened them with every ounce of her courage to see a healthy-looking white Persian cat staring back at her. Her heart pounded as she brought her forepaw up to brush against her face. Her mind ran in circles as she took in her new yet old appearance, \"Fur. . . fur. . . fur. . . I have fur. . . I actually have fur. . . I have my fur. . .I have my fur back!\" She let out a loud cry of raw emotion and threw her face against the mirror, sliding down off the glass as she meowed and shouted and made various joyful noises. This went on for a few moments, until it finally faded out in soft purring. Shamus was very patient, doing his best to fight the urge to get the cat's attention. \"Be patient. . . give her time. . . remember, we need her, so we best keep her as stable as possible. \" Eventually, the Persian cat got up, and shakily turned towards Shamus. \"H-how did you-?\" she asked, her voice trailing off. Cateri stepped into the doorway, making her presence known once again, and said, \"At the Animal Institute of Revelations, much research is done concerning the welfare of animals. The restoration of lost fur is one such avenues of research that has seen some major breakthroughs.\" Shamus nodded and said, \"Indeed! You would've been amazed if you could've seen the reactions of everyone in Bioscience. They're all so proud of what they've accomplished! They've really given you quote the makeover, haven't they, Ms. Clawyu?\" Ivana Clawyu didn't so much as wince at the sound of her old name. Rather, she simply stared into space for a moment, and then asked tentatively, her eyes darting from Shamus and Cateri and back, \"But. . .why me? Why help a known criminal mastermind?\" She arched her back and peered at the cat and dog before her, and she said, \"My body might be restored, but I assure you that my mind is a sharp, cold, and calculating as ever. Nothing could ever take that away from me!\" Shamus chuckled a bit, and he said, \"Indeed, Ms. Clawyu. And your question is quite the pertinent one, isn't it? Well, our actions concerning you involve one of my brighter ideas. I have long figured that rather than request someone's services and offer to give them something they desire after they are done, it would be better to give them what they desire upfront and then count on them to show their gratitude for the gift they were given.\" Ivana immediately understood what Shamus was getting at, and she nodded and said, \"Oh, I see.\" She smiled knowingly as she stroked her chin with her right forepaw, \"So, you want something from me, do you? Well, I should've known. But what really kills me is that you're right.\" She took a good look at the fur on her foreleg and said, \"After what you've done for me, I don't think I could say no. Quid pro quo , after all.\" \"Hold on a moment, let me make it clear that you could say no, if you wanted,\" Shamus clarified, \"In that case, we'd simply relocate you far away from here in a way that would keep you from finding your way back or disclosing the location of this facility to anyone. I'm sure a cat like you could find a nice family rather quickly.\" Ivana appeared to think this over for a moment, then she fixed her eyes on Shamus and asked, \"What exactly do you want from me?\" Shamus sat down and said, \"First things first. You know how I talked about how cats and dogs just refuse to speak to humans? Well, according to our research, cats and dogs seem to have a subconscious mental block against speaking to humans. Now, certain animals with strong enough wills can bring themselves to overcome this mental block. Mr. Tinkles in one such animal. To a lesser extent, certain animals are able to circumvent this block by speaking indirectly, like through a microphone or some such device. However, we at A.I.R. believe that this mental block can be completely eradicated by simply revealing our ability to talk in a way that is powerful, blatant, conspicuous, unavoidable, and undeniable. Such a massive. . .\" Shamus smirked before saying the next word, \". . . revelation to mankind of our greatest secret will force us to abandon our own inhibition, and we will finally be free to communicate with the species we've grown to care for. When all three species are one, once we exchange technologies and ideas for the common good, the hearts and minds of humanity will be opened to the idea of other soul-bearing creatures besides themselves, the worst of our races will be more easily brought to justice, and there will most certainly be world peace, utopia , in our planet's future. I already have the content of our message written down. All we need is a method of broadcasting it, on repeat , to the entire planet.\" Ivana's eyes widened with realization, then she smiled widely and said, \"I see. . . you want me to build another transmitter and satellite.\" \"Precisely,\" Shamus replied. Ivana chuckled and rubbed her forepaws together. \"Oh boy, this promises to be fun!\" she said, but then she paused and asked, \"Although, I have to wonder, why are you so determined to get cats and dogs talking with humans?\" Shamus let out a low growl of frustration, and he said, \"Because those fools at D.O.G.S. and M.E.O.W.S. have only made things worse for all three of our species! Keeping our intelligence quiet! Failing to unite dogs and cats! Turning a blind eye to human conflicts! Disgraceful! I blame them for all of these power-hungry criminal cats!\" Shamus then panted for a moment, and then leaned over to Ivana and said gently, \"Those cat agents treated you horribly after your accident, didn't they? I am so sorry you had to go through that.\" Ivana felt an ache deep within her, and she let out a shaky breath and nodded silently. Shamus nodded back and continued, \"Had they shown you more compassion, you would never had gone bad and tried to carry out your plan of global terrorism. What's more, if cats and dogs were allowed to speak freely, your family would have realized who you were and not thrown you out! Clearly you are proof that A.I.R.'s goal is one that must be achieved at all costs!\" A light sparkled in Ivana's eyes. She unsheathed her claws and waved a forepaw around deviously as she declared, \"Oh, it will be achieved. It will be. Kitty Galore may have failed, but neither D.O.G.S. nor M.E.O.W.S. will be able to stand against the return of Agent Ivana Clawyu!\" Cateri stepped forward and said, \"You will not be alone in your endeavors. You will be aided by two specially selected and highly qualified partners.\" Shamus nodded, \"Indeed. These two individuals have also been done wrong by D.O.G.S. and M.E.O.W.S., but A.I.R. will gladly give them a second chance, as they have given you. And if all goes well, you won't have to wait long to meet one of them. He is a cat by then name of Diemetri Kennelkoff. Although I do believe he often goes by the name of. . . The Russian. \" ","Summary":" Author's Note: While many see the Cats & Dogs films as bad, I have to admit that at the very least "},{"Movie":"Cats & Dogs","Title":"Doggy on sugar","Author":"The Super Shepherd","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11646448","Passage":"[Chapter 1] Butch was laying on the couch in the rec room of HQ.

Butch was confused by what just happened. Then Juliet and Deathwish came in the rec room panting like they ran a marathon. \"What's going on here?\" Butch asked. \"Long story. Shadow took Diggs candy and he begged us to help him get it back. After we did, we gave him the candy and he ate a lot. Two boxes of cookies, dozens of lollipops, and all kinds of other stuff.\" Deathwish said. Butch chuckled at this. The rookie was apparently high on a sugar rush. \"What do we do?\" Butch asked. \"We're trying to catch him, but he's so high on sugar his stamina is endless. Don't tell my brother. He'll get mad.\" Juliet said as they went back to chasing Diggs around HQ. Butch went into Shadow's room to find him on a human computer. \"Shadow.\" Butch said. Shadow looked at him. \"What is it?\" He asked. \"There's a problem with your boyfriend.\" Butch had caught Shadow humping Diggs in the forest and he was cool with I. Although he wish he could've unseen it. \"What did he do?\" Shadow asked. \"Um...Juliet and Deathwish helped him get back the candy you took from him and now he's on a sugar rush.\" He said. The wolf let out a tired sigh as he got up and they left to find Diggs. When they found him, Diggs was jumping around like he was a circus dog. Shadow and Butch smiled since this was so adorable. Then Juliet and Deathwish came in the rec room. \"Butch. I told you not to tell Shadow.\" Juliet said. When Diggs heard Shadow's name he looked at the wolf and smiled stupidly. \"Wolfy!\" He exclaimed as he hugged the old wolf. \"Why'd you take my candy?\" Diggs asked in a childlike voice. \"Cause whenever you get your paws on sugar you act like a child.\" He said. Diggs started running around again. \"If you can catch me you get the...\" Diggs was cut off by Shadow catching him and holding him in his arms. \"Hey. No fair. You're faster.\" Diggs complained. \"So how are you gonna calm him down?\" Butch asked. \"I'm gonna use his adrenaline for our activities.\" Shadow said with a smirk as he winked.

Much like my other stories that will involve Shadow and the Pack. I don't own Shadow or the Pack. Nightfury991 does. He let me use them. It was a cool day for Diggs at his dog house. Diggs wasn't in the best mood right now. He's grieving over someone he lost, someone he loved, someone he'll never see again. Then suddenly his collar started buzzing. \"Might as well answer.\" He though since he had nothing better to do. \"Hello?\" He asked. On the other line was the one canine he didn't like, Shadow. \"Hello, I overheard Lou saying he's gonna ask you to come to HQ. Why don't you be a good little pup and come before the head has to call you.\" Shadow said. It didn't anger Diggs at all that he called him 'pup'. So the dog got up and activated the pod. He wasn't excited this time. He was still depressed. When he activated the paw scanner the door open, then he walked through. He saw Butch waiting for him and Shadow once again with a female. This was beautiful husky. She giggled and bashed her paw against his shoulder. \"That's the four one this week. Why won't he pick one already?\" He thought. He already knew the answer to that. Back then when was 15 he worked in a German government that was basically antiterrorism. He learned many thinks. One was one to get Intel without getting caught. Which is how he found out that Shadow was actually gay and only became a hit with the females just to impress people. \"Shadow.\" Butch said. Shadow looked at the husky and whispered something in her ear before he walked towards Butch and Diggs. He was slightly confused when he was the sad look Diggs was trying hide. \"Why is he so sad?\" He thought as he walked next to Butch to Lou's office. \"Now Diggs we brought you here to discuss the cats and dogs alliance and advancements.\" The older dog explained. Diggs just simply nodded. When they got to the Head's office they saw the rest of the Pack and some other agents and of course Catherine. \"Hey Diggs.\" She said. Diggs faked a smile and said. \"Hey cat.\" He was good at acting. 1 hour later the meeting was over as everyone went home. Diggs didn't go home. He was heading somewhere else. Shadow checked a computer and it showed he was going to Germany. \"Why Germany?\" He asked himself. Curiosity got the best of him as he got in another transport pod. When he arrived in Germany he tracked down Diggs and found him in the cemetery. \"Why here?\" He thought as he walked in and looked around. Then in the distance was a statue. In appeared to be the statue of a wolf. It marked the grave that Diggs was in front of. Shadow was even more confused when Diggs looked like he was on the verge of crying. His eyes began tearing up as he whispered something Shadow was able to hear. \"Shadow, Juliet. I'm sorry. I'm sorry you never got to meet your father.\" He said as tears began falling from his muzzle. \"Father? He knew our father? How?\" He asked himself I'm his mind. Diggs began sob as he said. \"I'm sorry my love. It's all my fault you're gone. I could've...I'm sorry Alexi.\" Shadow eyes widen in shock. \"He dated our dad? Time to get to the bottom of this.\" He thought as he walked closer to Diggs. Seeing him like this broke his heart. \"Diggs.\" Shadow called out softly in a gentle voice. Diggs wiped the reader off his face and tried to act natural. \"Shadow. What are you doing here?\" He asked tried hold back his tears. Shadow looked him in the eye and asked. \"What happened? How do you know my father.\" Diggs couldn't hold it any more so he burst into tears. Shadow wrapped his arms around him and stroked his fur as he let Diggs cry into his chest. They may have not been close, but Shadow seeing Diggs in pain. 10 minutes later Diggs stopped crying, but he still had his face buried in Shadow's fur. \"You can tell me Diggs. It's just us.\" He said with his arms still wrapped around him. Diggs began to explain. \"When I was 2 years old I had no parents, no family, no one to take care of me. Then one day your father Alexi found me and took me in. At first I saw him as a father figure, but when I understood what love was I fell in love with him. When I was 12 we got together. When I was 13 he let me join The Super Shepherds organization. And antiterrorism government form to protect humanity from what they could not defend themselves against. In 1995 they began to accept any other breeds and other canine that proved they had what it takes to be a Super Shepherd. When I was 15 I was injured from a previous mission and could not be a part of your father's mission to ensure a kill on Iraq. A wolf and German Shepherd hybrid that was leader of the most powerful terrorist in history know as the Dark Shepherds. I begged them to let me go with them, because Iraq was the most dangerous German and I didn't wanna risk Alexi's life. He convinced me that he would make it. But I snuck out with a sniper and decided to atleast try and support them. Alexi killed Iraq which caused the fall of the Dark Shepherds, but at the cost of his life. I remember everything and what he said.\" FLASHBACK \"Nein, nein, nein. Don't talk like that you're gonna be fine.\" Diggs said. He wasn't gonna give up on him. Alexi looked at him and said. \"Diggs...I know this is gonna be impossible for you to do, but I want you to live a happy eternity. I want you to find new love. Someone that's immortal.\" Diggs didn't want that at all. \"Nein. Please. I can't lose you.\" He said as his eyes began tearing up. \"I can't lose you either, but promise me that you will be happy without me. Promise me you'll find new love.\" Alexi said. \"Anything for you Alexi.\" He said as he began crying. They shared one last kiss before Alexi said with all the strength he had left. \"Goodbye Diggs. I will always love you.\" END OF FLASHBACK \"He made me promise that I'd find new love. I let the government cause I didn't wanna see one of my mortal friends die right in front of me.\" Shadow felt pity for Diggs. He last the one that raised him and the one that he loved the most. \"I've learned that like me you're immortal and I can't lose you.\" Diggs said as he held onto Shadow. \"Why?\" Shadow asked. \"Because I love you. Every time I see you I see Alexi. Like you're a young verison of him. I'm sorry I snapped at you when we met. Ever since alex died I've been protective of friends and family.\" Shadow looked at him and said. \"It's okay Diggs. I understand. And I love you too.\" Diggs looked up at Shadow and when he did the wolf pressed his muzzle onto the dog's. On the hill was a large black wolf that resembled Shadow. \"I'm happy for you Diggs. Thank you for keeping your promise.\" Alexi's Ghost said as he went off to heaven. ","Summary":" In this story Shadow and the Pack never betrayed Dog HQ at all.

This is Galore we're talking about here!\" the German Shepard yipped, his bushy tail wagging with his determination. \"It's only a matter of time before she tries to take over the world again!\" \"Unless some one does something to break the cycle,\" his partner interjected. \"Like what?\" he barked. \"Like you keeping her behind bars?\" \"Oh, hush up,\" Catherine remarked, her own slender and gray tail swishing with her growing agitation with him. She unsheathed her claws and quietly kneaded the snow beneath her gray paws. \"I'm saving her. You'll see.\" \"Saving her?\" he barked again, his fur rising. \"You must be insane,\" he declared, \"'cause what I'm seeing is the criminal who's supposed to be free is still behind bars!\" \"She wouldn't stay any other way,\" Catherine argued. \"This is going to save her life!\" \"We already saved her life,\" Diggs yipped. \"This is just tormenting her!\" \"Hush! She's coming!\" Catherine commanded, whirling around and placing a paw over his mouth. He shook against her hold, but she clung to him determinedly. His brown eyes widened. \"Who's coming?\" he questioned, his voice muffled beneath the cover of her paw. \"The human,\" Catherine told him. \"The one I told you about, remember?\" He tried to talk, but her paw kept him quiet. He whimpered, pleading for her to let go of him, and at last with another stern reminder, she released him. \"Now be quiet. Don't make another sound or we might scare her off.\" \"I still think it's a bad idea,\" he told her. \"Any one takes one look at Kitty Galore's ugly mug, they're gonna - \" Catherine turned around again just as the door of the house they'd been watching opened and covered her youthful partner's mouth once more with her paw. \"I said be quiet!\" she hissed, her emerald eyes narrowed up at him. \"And Kat O'Hara's not like that! You'll see! She's going to give Kitty what she needs: a real chance to start over!\" A crooning voice with an Irish lilt broke through their conversation. \"Ach, me Goddess! What have we here, me darlin'?\" Both animals stuck their heads around the corner of the far building and watched as the redheaded woman hurried down her snow-covered steps. \"What bloody bastard left me a poor, wee soul out in this freezin' cold on Christmas Eve?\" Diggs laughed. \"You did,\" he whispered, and Catherine held his jaw more tightly closed in her paws. Kat picked up the carrier they'd set onto her bottom step and gazed into the crate. Diggs bristled against Catherine's hold, yearning to tell her, \"Here it comes,\" and being unable to get so much as a single word out from the way she clenched his mouth shut. \"Ah, 'tis okay, sweetheart,\" Kat crooned into the carrier's door, and Diggs' brown eyes grew wide. What? he thought, aching to yip with his surprise and flapping his body about like a fish out of water as Catherine persisted in keeping his mouth trapped shut in her paws. Can't she see her? And then, before his startled eyes, the woman took the cat out of the cage. Kitty slapped at her, her claws bared, but Kat dodged her claws, held her close, and hugged her, every last hairless inch of her. Tears welled into Diggs' eyes, and he finally stopped fighting Catherine and just watched the miracle of rare human kindness unfold before his amazed eyes. \"'Tis okay, darlin',\" Kat's gentle and soothing voice assured Kitty, and though she whispered, the officers could still hear her Irish voice clearly in their pointed ears. \"Ye're safe now. There's nae more need fer ye tae be fightin'. Yer'll have yer every need met from here on out an' all th' luvin' ye can hold. Come inside, an' we'll get ye a nice saucer o' milk.\" \"Milk?\" Kitty mewed weakly. Her naked tail swished in the icy air. It had been so long since she'd had milk! Her green eyes glared up at Kat. \"Are you going to make me dress up?\" \"Nae,\" Kat assured her, gazing down into her eyes with unlimited love. \"Nae unless ye want tae.\" Both Kitty's and Diggs' mouths fell open so shocked were they at the realization that Kat understood what Kitty was meowing; Catherine just smiled a grin of joy and knowledge. \"You can understand me?\" Kitty asked in surprise. \"Aye, every word, darlin', an' ye need tae understand this,\" Kat told her, gently stroking her pink skin, \"ye're beautiful jest th' way ye are, an' nae one's e'er gonna change tha' or hold it against ye again. I won't let 'em.\" Diggs' surprise grew as he heard Kitty begin to purr, and then the human woman and the ex-convict were gone, disappeared into the warmth of both heat and love inside Kat O'Hara's home. \"See?\" Catherine questioned, finally releasing him and looking up at him with a huge grin. Her green eyes sparkled. \"I told you Kat O'Hara's different! We'll never have to arrest Kitty again! She won't want to take over the world now that she's happy and loved!\" Diggs slowly walked up to the house, his mouth still hanging open. \"Wow!\" he breathed, his tail wagging. \"I never thought some one could actually look at that cat and not be disgusted!\" He barked. \"She's so gross, what with being naked and all!\" \"Diggs,\" Catherine scolded, her furry lips twitching with her humor, \"that's not very nice - \" \"Not nice, maybe,\" Diggs said, wagging his tail, \"but true!\" He barked again, then picked up the carrier and gave it to another approaching agent. The wind shifted, and he turned back to the small house with surprise. \"Whoa!\" \"What is it?\" Catherine queried, watching him from her green eyes rounded with puzzlement. His tail wagged again. \"I've never smelled so many different scents in one place! There's cats, dogs, fish, birds, raccoons, tigers, panthers, lions, monkeys - \" He yipped. \"It's like a zoo in there!\" His tail wagged even harder. \"And there's even animals I haven't smelled before!\" \"She's coming!\" Catherine spoke with sudden urgency and, grabbing her partner by his collar, dashed around the side of the house. She leaned against the wall just as the front door opened again. Diggs' ears perked up as he listened to Catherine's heart pounding inside her furry chest. He cocked his head to one side, heard the woman muttering in Gaelic about whoever had been heartless enough to abandon Kitty in the cold and had even waited around to reclaim their carrier and promising a fate worse than ten thousand deaths upon their heads if ever she found them, and watched the emotions flickering in Catherine's emerald orbs. His tail wagged cautiously as Kat went back inside and shut the door behind her. \"You miss it, don't you?\" \"What?\" \"Having a family.\" Yet she had become a part of his family, even sharing his claim on his humans. \"Having your own, I mean,\" he clarified, \"like before.\" Like before she'd come into his life, before she'd become a secret agent, before her life been transformed by whatever hardship had made her so stoic and serious and furiously adamant against companionship when they'd first met. Catherine started preening herself, but he'd long ago realized that she'd resort to bathing when faced with a conversation in which she would rather not partake. \"It's okay,\" he said and licked her gray, furry cheek before she could stop him. His tail wagged so hard that his entire behind shook with the motion. \"You do have a family,\" he reminded her gently, \"even if you have to share it.\" \"Diggs, I - \" \"Catherine, what are you standing under?\" \"What?\" she questioned. Her green eyes narrowed again, and he could tell she was trying to determine rather she should be suspicious or just curious. \"Look above you,\" he yipped. She did, and her eyes grew as round as saucers as she found that he'd used an extension from his collar to hang mistletoe over her furry head. \"Diggs, I - \" \"You do have a family, Catherine, right here,\" he told her quickly again and then pressed his nose to hers before she could stop him. His nose slipped slightly, and he pressed his furry lips forward to touch hers. They both shivered inside not from the cold but rather from the delicious tingles that raced through them both from their simple, shared kiss. Then Diggs' tongue slipped from his mouth, and Catherine jumped away from him before his slobbering, pink tongue could lick her smooth fur again. \"Diggs!\" she exclaimed, her eyes wide and slightly wild. \"Cats and dogs - \" \"Are wonderful together,\" he finished before she could say what she was really thinking. He knew there were a thousand reasons why they shouldn't be together, but they were marvelous together. They had proven that first as reluctant partners and then as friends, and he knew they'd be purrfect lovers too. He wagged his tail at her. Stretching out his front legs, he leaned down onto the snowy ground and looked directly into her face. \"You know we are,\" he told her. \"Besides,\" he yipped, \"I already saw our Christmas miracle. Now I'm just trying to get a little Christmas fun.\" She laughed. His eyes gazed adoringly up into hers, and finally Catherine's green orbs began to sparkle in return. \"Fine,\" she said, walking forward and closing the distance between them. She rubbed herself against his face and purred. \"Just don't blame me if you wake up the morning after Christmas to find your face slandered all over the newspaper. You'll be famous if you date me.\" \"I'm already famous,\" he yipped, \"but there's nowhere else I'd rather spend Christmas or any other day or night of the year than right beside you!\" She rubbed her body down half the length of his side, then slapped him gently in his handsome, furry face with her slender, beautiful tail. Her tail ran across his face and underneath his nose before twitching at him in a come-hither gesture. Yet she was off flying before he could go after her. He laughed and took off after her with his own jet pack. Soon, they were playing tag in the starry, Christmas sky far above the city and all the beings, human and animal, cat and dog, cruel and kind, beneath them. There were only the two of them in the sky until a red sleigh zipped by them so fast that they almost didn't see it. \"Catherine,\" Diggs yipped, \"was that who I think it was?\" \"Yes, Diggs,\" Catherine purred. \"Yes, it was.\" \"That means there'll be treats waiting at home!\" He barked excitedly. \"Come on, I'll race you home!\" Her happy laughter followed him as he flew through the night sky, and his smile grew even wider. \"Diggs?\" she called to him. \"Yes, kitty cat?\" \"Merry Christmas!\" \"And merry Christmas to you too!\" he barked back, and as he led the way to their home and their waiting family, he schemed over how he would get her back underneath the mistletoe again. This was definitely going to be the happiest Christmas ever, and he would prove to his beloved Catherine that cats and dogs really were meant to be together after all!

I noticed that there aren't many stories about Cats and Dogs, so I decided to help by contributing. So here you go. I do not own Cats and Dogs. Worrying for Love By Tealfeather Diggs paced the hallway, back and forth, as sweat dripped from his skin soaking his fur. His tail wagged from left to right, shaking him in the process, as his eyes frantically looked around. The normally cool and relaxed German Shepard, who can go through any problem that faced him, was panicking in the inside as worry and fear flowed through his veins. Trying to handle the situation he stopped dead in his tracks and took in long and deep breaths, hoping that it could help him calm down. But he growled in frustration, for it didn't help, and started pacing once more. \"She's going to be fine.\" He told himself, before repeating it. \"She's going to be fine.\" He then glanced towards the double doors in front of him and kept a steady gaze upon them. His eyes were locked towards them, as if he was having a staring contest. His brain was telling him that he should go in, but he knew that he shouldn't. 'I would only disturb them.' He thought. 'Besides, they know what they're doing. Right?' Shaking his head, he continued pacing once more. \"I shouldn't have let this happen…\" He muttered to himself. \"…I should have been faster.\" His eyes were filled with nervousness as he feared what will happen to his feline friend once those doors open. He usually never worried this much when any member of the team was injured, for he knew that the medical team could handle it, but for some odd reason he felt his heart breaking apart during those precious moments of not knowing of his friends condition. He paused once more as he stared at the wall. His memories suddenly brought him back to the moment that caused this. The moment he wished he would never see again. The moment that he wished to forget. It was normal mission, like any other. Diggs and the rest of the team was assigned to arrest a well-known cat terrorist, who had plans to break apart cat and dog cooperation by bombing an annual convention. But the intelligence branch manages to find him first before he could have done it and sent their team to capture him. At first the plan went according to plan, the target was trapped inside the warehouse, that he used as his base of operations, and was about to be arrested when suddenly out of nowhere a loud bang echoed around them. Diggs looked around him, but he couldn't see anything through the smoke that now surrounded the room. But once it started to clear he could see a gigantic hole, leading out towards the darkness of the noght, on the wall and the cat terrorist escaping through it. He then saw Butch raising though the hole, followed by Catherine and Seamus, and soon followed. \"Hey kid…\" He head Butch call to him. \"…I want you and Catherine to stay close on his tail. Me and Seamus are going to try and cut him off before he get too far.\" Diggs nodded in response as he watched the two break left before going out of sight. He then looked at Catherine, who had a small grin on her face. \"First one to catch him wins.\" She said before racing off. That was one thing he liked about her. Ever since their first mission together, Catherine tended to show a lot of competitiveness, especially towards him. Of course he didn't mind to have a little competition and he always wanted to show himself off towards her. Ever since Kitty Galore their friendship has blossomed and the normal cat hating dog was transformed to a dog that started to like cats. But for some reason he liked Catherine a little bit more. \"Hey wait for me!\" He called as he shifted to full gear to try and catch up to both their target and her. He swerved left and right, to avoid the obstacle in front of him, as he kept his eye trained on both cats. He could see that Catherine was getting closer to the terrorist cat, so he tried to go faster. But to no avail, Catherine was just more agile and faster than him. With one giant leap, he could see her fly through the air and fall right on top of their target. They rolled over for a while, but soon stopped in the middle of an asphalt rode. \"Got you.\" He heard her say as she kept him pinned down. But the terrorist cat just smiled and shook his head. \"But no for long.\" He said, before pulling something out of his belt, using his paw, and throwing it. There was a temporary blinding flash that forced Diggs to close his eyes and look away. The next thing Diggs saw was the terrorist cat running away and Catherine swaying dizzily in the middle of the road. He watched her as she tried to regain her balance and rub her head in pain. \"Are you alright?\" He called out as he started walking towards her. \"Yeah I think I am…\" She said. \"…now come on we need to…\" She wasn't able to finish her sentence when suddenly out of nowhere a loud horn came from behind. Diggs looked towards his left to see a pair of headlights heading towards him. He paused for a while not knowing what to do as his heart pause. He then heard a loud thud before the air was filled with Catherine's wails and yowls of pain. Diggs snapped out of his flashback and felt a small stream of tears leak from his eyes. He blamed himself for that accident and knew that if he reacted immediately, then Catherine wouldn't be in this situation. \"This is all my fault!\" He wept turning away from the doors. \"If I didn't just stand there then…\" \"Ehem.\" He suddenly heard a voice from behind. So he wiped the tears from his eyes, with his right paw, and turned to face an orange she-cat, that was wearing a white cap with a red cross in the middle. \"Ummmm….yes?\" He said, trying to sound normal. \"Agent Diggs?\" She asked. \"Yup that's me.\" He said trying to smile. The cat nodded and said: \"Alright, I would just like to tell you that Agent Catherine is doing well. The medical doctor has said that she might still fell some discomfort, but other than that she will be alright.\" Diggs felt relieved hearing this and wanted to scream into the sky in joy. But he kept his composure and remained calm. \"C…can I see her?\" He asked, cause even though he knew she was alright, he still wouldn't sleep well until he saw her himself. \"Of course…\" She said before turning around and heading towards the double doors. \"…follow me.\" So Diggs followed her through the doors and into a long white hallway. He passed through many door and could see through the windows many suffering cats. He suddenly realized how great a prize both M.E.O.W.S. and D.O.G.S. has to pay just to keep the world at peace. They soon stopped at a door that had the label #45 on it. He watched as the she-cat nurse open the door and heard her say at the patient inside: \"Agent Catherine you have a visitor.\" She then turned around to face Diggs and motioned for him to enter. As he was half way through he could hear the nurse whisper to his ear. \"I'll leave you two alone so you can talk.\" Diggs gave a small smile and nodded as he entered and closed the door behind him. His gaze soon fell upon the Russian blue cat who was lying, weakly, on the bed at the center of the room. Her fur was ruffled and slightly messy, while most of back side was wrapped with bandages. It hurt him to see her like that and he wished that the accident never happened. He slowly approached her without saying a word, for he didn't know what to say. As he approached she lifted her head and looked at him. Her eyes were half closed, showing that she was still weak, but Diggs could see the strength hidden within her as she tried to show no pain. \"Hi.\" She said weakly, before giving a small and weary smile. \"Hey.\" He said trying to smile back, as he now stood in front of her bed. \"You alright?\" She was about to nod her head, but felt a stiff pain and decided against it, Instead she put her head down and said: \"Yeah…just some pain in the bones and stinging, but other than that I feel fine.\" Her voice tried to hide the pain within, but Diggs could sense it. It hurt him to see her like that and he still blamed himself for it. He wished he could do more to help her, but wondered what it could be. His consciousness was building up inside him and he knew that he needed to apologize. \"Hey…Catherine I need to tell you something.\" He said as she lifted her head to listen. He took it as I sign to go on and said: \"I just want to say that I'm sorry. I'm sorry in putting you through all this and it pains me to see you like this.\" By now tears were streaming down his eyes and he started to cry, but he manages to continue. \"I think that I should have done more to help you. I think that I should have raved out there and pick you up. But I didn't, I just stood still and watched it unfold.\" \"So Catherine I'm just asking if you could forgive me, even after what I didn't do to protect you.\" He said before looking directly at her eyes, pleading. \"Awww….Diggs.\" She said as he motioned him, with her tail, to come closer. Which he did, by moving to the side of the bed and putting his face near her. \"You know that it wasn't your fault.\" She told him. \"It was just an accident and no one was to blame.\" \"Yeah, but…\" Diggs was about to argue, but was immediately cut off by Catherine. \"Diggs…\" She said firmly. \"…I don't want to hear you blame yourself again.\" Diggs nodded and looked down, feeling that he disappointed her. Her expression then softened as she, stiffly, moved towards him and rubs her head against his. She gave out a loud purr before saying: \"Besides, you're a great friend to me and I could never be angry at you.\" \"Really?\" He said looking at her. They were now face to face, their noses only a few inches away. This made Diggs slightly nervous, but he didn't try to show it right in front of her. \"Definitely.\" She said before moving her head forwards, making their lips touch together and Diggs blush. Although he was shocked and didn't expect that to happen, he didn't stop her and enjoyed every second of it. So what do you think? I hope you liked it and you can help me know by reviewing.

I was riding with my partner Shane Larson as we were heading to a car dealership to respond to a hostage situation. My name was Detective Richard Diggs of the SFPD and now was the time to finally make a name for myself in the force. My fellow officers think of me as a hothead and an arrogant asshole, but they have never had to fight to get what they want like I have, and they're just jealous about how good I am at my job. \"Time to make you proud...dad,\" I thought as Shane and I screeched up to the scene in his pristine 1970 Mustang Mach One, blaring \"Bad to the Bone\" by George Thorogood and the Destroyers, a complete cliche from a buddy cop movie. The engine and the music cut off instantly as we jumped out and rushed over to our commanding officer, Captain Flemming. Checking out the scene on the way over, we could see many officers and a SWAT team standing by, aiming at the mascot for the car dealership, a guy dressed up in a cartoonish Uncle Sam costume, who was busy yelling and smashing up a car window with a sledgehammer with one hand and holding what looked like a remote control with the other. \"Give us the situation, Captain,\" Shane said as he and I pulled out our standard issue Sig Sauer P226s. \"We got us a first-class nutcase here. Four hostages inside, all used car salesmen...I've got mixed feelings about this shitshow,\" Captain Flemming muttered as I focused on the perp and realized that the remote control he was holding must be the detonator to the bombs that were currently wired all over the outside of the building. \"Hmm...if that crazy son of a bitch pushes that button, this whole lot explodes and many people will die...I need to get the angle on him,\" I mumbled as I cautiously moved around to the side and took cover between two cars. Seeing the man ranting and raving as I approached at the front of the cars, I stayed crouched between the cars and aimed my gun across the hood of one of the cars. Just then, Shane spotted me and his eyes widened in horror. Suddenly time slowed down and everything moved in slow motion as, out of the corner of my eye, I saw Shane making large gestures with his arms and mouthing, \"Get out of there! What the hell are you doing?! Get out of there now! I said get the hell out of there!\" The sudden motion caught Uncle Sam's eye and he turned around to see what the commotion was. At the same time, the men trapped in the building assumed that Shane was gesturing at them and took the opportunity to bolt out of the building while Uncle Sam had his back turned to them. Upon hearing the men escape the building, Uncle Sam whipped back around, dropping his sledgehammer and pulling a 38 revolver out of his clown pants. As he was raising it to aim at the fleeing salesmen, one of the SWAT officers shot him in a kneecap and his gun and the detonator both went straight up in the air as he went down like a crazy red, white and blue sack of potatoes. I launched myself toward him, hoping to keep the gun away from him and/or catch the detonator. The gun was skidding across the pavement and I could see the detonator coming back down, so I lunged for it and made the perfect grab in midair and rolled right back up into a standing position, feeling pretty badass as I held the detonator high above my head in victory. I was confused about why Shane, the Captain, the other officers, and the crowd of people in the background were whipping around and fleeing the scene in a panic. It was at this moment that I realized that I was holding the button down and the building was going to explode at any second. I lunged behind the wreckage of the car Uncle Sam had been attacking, landing on the wreckage of Uncle Sam just as the building exploded around us. Unbeknownst to me, I was being watched by someone who had sinister intentions planned for me. \"What do you think?\" one figure asked eagerly. \"Hmmm...so much capacity for destruction...he would make a fine soldier for my new army...yes, he'll do. Soon, that human will be in my paws and he'll enjoy his new life as my first experimental loyal soldier...\" the main figure declared as it started laughing menacingly. \"Suspension?! You're not serious!\" I exclaimed in disbelief while I was currently being yelled at by Captain Flemming. \"You're an uncontrollable wrecking ball, Diggs! You blew up a car dealership, for Christ's sake! The city is filing a lawsuit and the Chief is all over my ass because of you! I don't know what to do with you anymore, Diggs!\" Captain Flemming retorted. \"I didn't ask for that crap to happen! Please don't do this to me...this job is all that I have left,\" I pleaded quietly and Captain Flemming sighed. \"Look, Diggs...I know it hasn't been easy since your father passed away 20 years ago and that you grew up in the system, but you need to learn to work with others or you're not going to move forward in life...hand me your badge and gun, Detective,\" Captain Flemming instructed. I was angry at first until I relented by handing over my badge and gun, pissed that I was going through another bad situation in my messed up life. I left the office and passed a K-9 Unit, hearing the dogs snickering at me as I went by. \"Looks like Wrecking Ball Diggs did it again,\" I heard one of the German Shepherds mutter quietly. \"That human is such a Goddamn menace...it's a wonder why he hasn't been fired yet,\" the other shepherd remarked quietly. \"I hear that the Captain in his division owed his father for saving his life...\" the first shepherd responded as I clenched my fists in response to them mocking me. Growing up, I've always been able to hear animals talking like people and I thought I was going crazy at first. But as time passed by, I've learned to ignore it and focus on other things. I headed to the men's locker room and entered the room, heading to my locker and getting my stuff. \"So...the Captain must've laid into you pretty good if you have that look on your face,\" I heard a familiar voice speak, and I closed my locker to see Shane leaning against the wall with his arms crossed. \"Apparently, due to the lawsuit and insubordination, I've been suspended...just another day in my shitty life,\" I grumbled irritably as I went to leave. \"Well, it's not like you are actively avoiding it either,\" Shane pointed out and I rolled my eyes. \"Sure, let's blame Richard Diggs for everything wrong in the world,\" I said sarcastically and added, \"It's not like I'm not used to it.\" \"Rick-\" Shane tried to say, but I held up a hand. \"Just...go be with your wife and kid or Wrecking Ball Diggs will screw everything up again,\" I cut off with a bitter frown as I passed him and left the locker room. I passed many officers who were staring at me in disapproval, but I didn't care about what they thought of me as I left the building and went to my car. While I was driving home, I thought about my dad trying to raise me after my mother died in childbirth, then passing away 20 years ago when I was young, and how I had bounced around from foster home to foster home when no other family had been found. I eventually arrived at my house and got out of my car, heading to the front door. As I was unlocking the door, I suddenly felt something tiny and sharp hit my neck. I yelped as I frantically grabbed the small object and pulled it out, looking to see that it was a dart of some kind while my vision became blurry. \"Wha...oh...shit...\" I slurred as I struggled to reach for my off duty weapon and fell face first to the ground. I was losing consciousness and could see a figure approaching me, then I gave up the fight and blacked out. I didn't know what was happening, but there were times when I was half awake and dozed off again. When I had finally regained consciousness, I noticed that I was fully nude and strapped to a metal table that was inside a dimly lit room with a big mirror on one wall that reminded me of the interrogation rooms at the station, so it was probably one way. \"What? What the hell is this?! Hey! Let me out of this damn thing!\" I demanded in outrage and the lights suddenly turned on. I yelped at the bright light and slammed my eyes shut, hearing the sound of an intercom turning on. \"I see you are awake...good. That means we can get started,\" a voice spoke and I struggled against my restraints. \"Who the hell are you?! Do you have any idea of how much trouble you're in?! I'm a police officer and kidnapping is a federal crime, so let me go or you'll find yourself in deep shit!\" I threatened harshly, and I felt dread when the voice chuckled. \"Oh, I don't believe anyone will be looking for you since you officially died in a house fire that was caused by a gas leak. Once we took you, we made sure to make it look like you died in an accident so that no one will start looking for you. Long story short, nobody is coming to save you so you might as well get used to your new home,\" the voice explained cruelly. \"You bastards! You can't do this to me!\" I roared in fury while I tried to get free. \"I wouldn't struggle if I were you...it would make the procedure that much harder and more painful for you,\" the voice warned as a mechanical arm with an injector lowered down to my right arm. \"What the hell is that?! What the hell are you going to do to me?!\" I exclaimed in fear. \"It's just a little...experimental compound that'll bring you into a new form of existence. Hold still or things will get worse for you,\" the voice threatened as the needle lowered and sunk into one of the veins in my arm. There was a cooling sensation at first as the unknown substance was injected into me, but it turned into a white-hot agonizing feeling and I convulsed from the sheer unimaginable pain that ran through my body. I screamed in agony as it felt like my blood was on fire and my body kept twitching from the pain...I didn't know what I felt next, but I heard the sound of my bones breaking and my internal organs making strange noises. I felt my head getting compressed while my neck and face got longer, my ears grew, my torso crunching out, my legs and arms snapping and shortening into an unknown shape, my hands and feet extending and stretching, and my spine growing out from my rear as my skin itched badly. I looked to see what was happening to me and I screamed in horror when I saw the torso, legs, paws, tail, and fur coloring of a German Shepherd. It was all too much for me and I rolled my eyes up into the back of my head while I fainted from shock and denial. The unknown figure watched as the former human passed out and was approached by an assistant. \"The compound has been successful, but we have a problem...\" the assistant stated and flinched when the figure glared at him. \"If there is one thing I despise, it's problems. What the hell happened?\" the figure demanded. \"Well...we tried to implement the loyalty programming into the subject's mind, but it failed because his responses to our orders have been...sporadic and unpredictable. He shows extreme resistance to our programming methods,\" the assistant explained. \"Why?\" the figure questioned. \"He is unusual...atypical. He possesses an iron will, unlike anything we have ever seen before,\" the assistant stated. \"If he cannot follow our orders, then he is useless...get rid of him and do it quietly. We can't afford to have those mutts discovering our plans,\" the figure ordered coldly. \"Yes Sir,\" the assistant agreed and had a couple of security guards take the former human out of the room. The figure gritted his teeth and punched the wall next to him, unhappy that the project was a failure but he reassured himself that there would be other opportunities. I groaned as I was regaining consciousness, waking up to find myself in some alley. \"Ugh...where the hell am I? Oh God, this has to be a nightmare,\" I thought as I looked at a puddle of water and saw a German Shepherd looking back at me. \"Shit...this is real...what the hell do I do now?\" I whimpered and added, \"I just need to survive and see if I can find the bastards who did this to me, then I'll force them to change me back and prove to everyone that I'm not dead.\" Nodding to myself, I made sure to stay away from areas that were populated by humans and moved out to fulfill my new purpose.

Diggs often goes then to see friends like Catherine, Peek, Lou, but the reason he really comes here is for Butch. Butch and Diggs are good friends and spend time together. Diggs loved spending time with his mentor. Butch taught him everything he knows about being an agent. But the real reason he likes being around Butch is because he has a crush on the older dog. He hasn't told him because he's afraid that if he told Butch he was gay he would be rejected. He fantasies him and Butch living together, holding paws and often kissing. He was looking around for that handsome devil until he found him talking to Sam. \"Hey Butch.\" Diggs said. Butch looked in his direction and said. \"Hey Diggs. Good to see you.\" They sat in front of each other to chat. \"How's it going?\" Diggs asked. \"Great. I'm getting off work. I have a full week to myself.\" Diggs saw this as an opportunity to spend more time with Butch and build a stronger bond. \"Can I spend the week with you?\" Diggs asked. \"Of course. You're my best friend.\" Butch said. Diggs wanted him and Butch to be more than friends, but at least they're close. \"Great. Where do you wanna go first?\" Diggs asked. Butch thought for a bit before he came up with an idea. \"How about we go to the lake?\" Butch asked wondering if Diggs was interested which of course he was. \"Sure, let's go.\" He said before they walked to the transport pod. They got in and started the pod. \"So Butch. What's it like being an agent?\" Diggs asked since he was a rookie and didn't know much about the experience. \"Well...it's fun most of the time but sometimes missions are easy and missions are very difficult.\" Butch explained. Once they got to the lake they sat in front of the water and began to enjoy the view. \"Beautiful right?\" Diggs asked. \"Yeah. It's really nice.\" Butch said. They just sat there for 10 minutes until Diggs broke the silence. \"Butch I have something for you.\" Diggs said. \"What is it?\" Butch asked looking at Diggs. \"It's a surprise. First close your eyes and you'll know when to open them. Butch closed his eyes while Diggs walked in front of him. This was extremely risky but he had to take a chance. He leaned forward and closed his eyes before it happened. He kissed the Anatolian Shepherd and to him it felt like a lustful heaven. He gets startled when he feels two arms wrap around him and Butch start to kiss back. He became relieved that Butch wasn't mad. Butch started to deepen the kiss, he gently pushed Diggs on his back. He pushed his tongue inside Diggs mouth and licked Diggs fangs. Diggs moaned in the kiss then pushed his tongue forward while tasted Butch's saliva. He felt Butch grab his ass and squeeze it causing him to moan again. They kept this up for five minutes until they parted and nuzzle each other. \"I love you Diggs.\" Butch admitted. Diggs felt shocked. He knew Butch loved him when he started kissing back but when Butch said he loved him he felt like his heart was glowing. \"I love you too Butch. More chapters coming up. I'll updated whenever I get the chance. See ya.[Chapter 2] Hey guys sorry I haven't updated in a while. I've been tired and needed time for ideas on the chapters for stories that needed updating. Here's the new chapter. Diggs couldn't believe what happened at the lake. He couldn't believe Butch kissed him. He wanted to spend more time with his new boyfriend so he decided to take Butch to the beach. The beach was a good idea. Warm, relaxing, and lots of fun. They decided not to rush so they walked all the way from the lake to the beach. After a few hours of walking together they reached the beach. They enjoyed the sight of the beautiful horizon. It was almost sunset, but that didn't mean they were about to leave. \"Race ya to the water!\" Diggs said before he made a run for it. \"You're on kid.\" Butc said as he sped up towards the rookie. In ten seconds Butch reached the water before Diggs could. Hey yelp and jumped back when the cold water nearly froze his paws. When Diggs arrived next to him he couldn't help, but laugh. \"Not funny.\" Butch complained. \"It was...\" He was cut off by Butch tickling his stomach. He laughed before he rolled onto his back and Butch kept tickling him. Diggs was laughing so uncontrollably and Butch was tickling him so much he might pee. \"Butch! Butch! Stop! Ha ha! Please!\" Diggs begged as he started laughing louder. Butch grinned at this. \"Tell me you love me.\" Butch said still grinning. Diggs was laughing so hard it was almost impossible to talk. \"I - Ha ha! I love you! Ha ha!\" He finally managed to say. Butch smirked and gave his rookie mercy. Diggs stopped laughing and got up to his paws. \"Was that funny?\" Butc asked as if he was gonna do it again. \"No! No more please! I'm sorry!\" Diggs said. The German Shepherd did not want to go through the torture again. Butch smirked and licked rookie's cheek. They walked around the sand, then they decided to go in the water. Diggs splashed the older dog and laughed. Normally Butch wouldn't really find it funny, but he did now and besides he could never be mad at Diggs. So he splashed the German Shepherd repeatively and these splashes were bigger. Diggs was now completely wet when Butch finally stopped. He shook himself off before he walked over to Butch and nuzzled the older dog's neck. Butch enjoyed the rookie's affection. He licked the top of Diggs head and licked his nose. \"Hey you two get a room!\" They heard. They looked and saw Lou, Catherine, Sam, and Peek. \"Lou grow up.\" Butch said. Lou laughed. \"Come on you used to do the same with Ivy.\" He said. The name Ivy got Diggs's full attention. \"Who's Ivy?\" He asked. Butch looked at his lover and licked his nose. \"She's my ex. But don't worry kid. She's got nothing on you.\" Butch said before he rubbed his head against Diggs's. \"She used to called him livesnap.\" Sam said as Catherine and Peek laughed. \"That's so funny.\" Catherine commented. \"I think it's cute.\" Diggs said as he nuzzled his boyfriend's neck. Butch of course blushed when he was called that. \"Not as cute as you Diggie.\" He said as he kissed the younger dog. How it was Diggs's turn to blush. They started making out enjoying the kiss. It was like no one else was here. Unfortunately that wasn't true. \"Hey get a room!\" Catherine said. \"Oh shut up kitty cat.\" Diggs said before he continued kissing Butch. They had nothing against gay love, but of course they were immature and decided to say stuff like get a room or when's Butch gonna claim you. I know that in the movie Catherine seems like Diggs's love interest, but I prefer this kind of love. No offense to those of you who are straight. What I meant is I prefer writing stories with this kind of pairing. And if you look you can see that Butch kinda has like a sad look when he kicks Diggs off the team in the sixth scene of the movie. More chapters coming up. ","Summary":" It was just a normal night at Dog HQ.

Atticus was fast asleep until he felt licking at his face and he woke up to see his puppy smiling at him and ready for him to wake up so they could play together since there wasn't school today. \"Okay, boy, okay, I'm up.\" Atticus laughed. \"Yay!\" Patch cheered and jumped off the bed. Atticus rubbed his face as he pulled back the covers and he yawned and stretched. \"What shall we do today?\" \"What about-\" Patch was about to ask until thunder and lightning was heard outside of the room which made the puppy pout. \"Looks like we can't go outside.\" Atticus said. \"No, but you can help me clean up my workshop!\" Drell came in with a huge smile. \"Aw, Drell, it's Saturday...\" Atticus complained. \"I wanna spend time with Patch!\" \"Yeah, we wanna spend the day together!\" Patch added. \"Uh, no buts, I have custody of you all when I want and or need to, now get dressed and get in the closet, Atticus!\" Drell replied, then realized what he said. \"Wow, that sounded wrong... Anyway, let's go!\" Patch whimpered as Atticus went to leave. \"I'll be back soon, boy.\" Atticus promised as he comforted his puppy. \"Alright.\" Patch frowned. \"Come on, Atticus, Skippy threw his back out.\" Drell told Atticus. Atticus sighed and went with Drell into the Supernatural Realm. Patch sighed before he decided to go into the tunnels of the Pound Puppies. \"Couldn't this have waited a different time, Drell?\" Atticus glared slightly. \"Nonsense!\" Drell opened the door to show a flooding mess. \"This'll take you seconds!...An hour if we're lucky.\" \"What happened in here?!\" Atticus glared. \"It hasn't been cleaned in a while,\" Drell replied. \"I have a date, so, I'll see ya.\" Atticus soon used his magic and where the flooded water disappeared and how the flooded water started was fixed. \"I wanted you to do it without magic.\" Drell said. \"Oh, too bad, gotta go!\" Atticus went to run away. Drell then made the mess reappear and handed him a broom. \"Get cleaning.\" \"Okay, Drell, that's it!\" Atticus snapped. \"I'm not cleaning up your mess; I'm going to spend time with Patch and that is final!\" \"You think you can talk back to me?\" Drell laughed. \"You make me laugh.\" Atticus growled and tackled down Drell and fought with him and then walked away, dusting his hands as he went to see his pet to make up for the rude incoming morning. Drell muffled as he was tied up and the broom was in his mouth. Skippy came in the room with a smirk. Drell glared up at him. Skippy soon held out his hand for some money. Drell spit out the broom and glared. \"I'm tied up!\" Skippy then knelt beside Drell and took money out of his pockets. \"HEY!\" Drell glared. \"Hands off, Pixie Boy!\" Skippy then untied him and took off. \"Skippy, gimme my money!\" Drell glared. \"Yoo-hoo!\" Skippy called and ran with the money. Atticus soon went back to his house to make it up to Patch. \"Atticus, take out the trash!\" Emily called. \"Sure, Mom, in a minute!\" Atticus called back. \"Not a minute, now!\" Emily replied. Atticus sighed and he then went to take out the trash. A while later, the sun had gone down, Atticus finally came back to his room to hang out with Patch, but saw the puppy was already asleep on the living room couch. He frowned softly and then sat with the dog and hugged him to sleep too. Skippy frowned as he saw that Atticus had been too busy for Patch today so he decided to use a little magic and turn Atticus into a dog so they would spend time together. Atticus was too exhausted to even notice the change, but he would know once he would wake up first thing tomorrow morning. \"Skippy, we need Patch to be ready for tomorrow-\" Drell said before he saw that Skippy changed Atticus into a dog/teenage dog which was the same as Patch. \"We might also need to involve Atticus.\" Skippy looked over curiously. \"You know...\" Drell folded his arms. Skippy shrugged with a sheepish smile. Drell face-palmed. \"You were with Angela, weren't you?\" he then asked, knowing what usually ruined the mute man's train of thought. Skippy then blushed and shuffled his feet shyly. \"Oh, brother,\" Drell sighed. \"So did you change him into his wolf-dog hybrid form?\" Skippy nodded with a smile. \"I bet you did...\" Drell sighed with an eye roll. Skippy then curiously took out Cherry and Mo's files if they should be included or not. \"This won't need to involve them,\" Drell said. \"Because Mo is going to be with a cousin of hers.\" Skippy then shrugged and nodded. \"Plus, you know how Cherry is around dogs.\" Drell then reminded. Cut to Cherry in a room filled with dogs... \" CATS! \" Cherry yelled out as the dogs barked loudly. Back to the warlocks which made them shudder in disgust. \"Anyway, we'll keep Cherry out of this one.\" Drell said. Meanwhile... Cherry woke up and suddenly sneezed. She then looked around, shrugged, and then went back to sleep. The next day, Drell was in the Fudo household as Atticus and Patch were about to wake up. Atticus yawned and then woke up to see Patch was awake, but the puppy was snarling at him. \"Whoa! What's wrong, boy?\" \"Who are you?!\" Patch snarled. \"Get out of here before I tear you apart!\" \"Patch, it's me, Atticus!\" Atticus replied. \"I-\" he then looked down to his hands to see paws, he then rushed to a nearby mirror and yelped as he was a wolf dog and not a human, and where he soon had a suspicion who did this to him or at least two. \"Drell?! Discord?!\" He soon yelled out. \"This is so not funny!\" Drell walked over while sipping a soda. Atticus growled and tackled Drell on the ground. \" WHY DID YOU TURN ME INTO A DOG?! \" \"So you and Patch could spend some time together!\" Drell shivered nervously. \"You could have done this to me when me and Patch were awake, you know!\" Atticus growled. \"It was Skippy's idea, you can maul him if you want, he won't say anything!\" Drell said nervously. \"Just warn me next time.\" Atticus growled before he got off him. \"He wanted to surprise you!\" Drell shivered. Cherry came over through the front door without even knocking. \"Hey, Atticus, I got a weird feeling at my house, can I stay here for a few-\" she then saw Drell which made her scream and run out the door. \"Should I know why she was wanting to stay here for a few days?\" Atticus asked. \"How should I know?\" Drell shrugged. \"She's your best friend, not mine.\" \"Atticus, is that really you?\" Patch asked. \"Yes, Patch, it's me.\" Atticus replied. \"Hmm...\" Patch narrowed his eyes. \"Say something that only Atticus would say.\" \"Yeah, how do I know you're really Atticus and not some slobbering, mangy mutt?\" Cherry asked as she slowly came in that time. \"Easy, I can tell both of you what I used to be afraid of,\" Atticus said. \"Which would be the ocean and also thunder from thunder storms and I can also tell you that when I was a little kid I was lonely before I met you, Cherry.\" \"Sounds legit to me.\" Patch agreed with Atticus. \"Hmm...\" Cherry hummed. \"Also, you have a huge crush on-\" Atticus started. \"OKAY!\" Cherry covered his muzzle. \"It's you!\" Atticus simply smirked as he knew that would get her. \"No one needs to know more about that-EW! You hand licker!\" Cherry then said and pulled her hand away as it was now covered in dog slobber. \"Anyway, you two are going to be needing to go to Pound Puppy HQ.\" Drell said. \"Care to lead the way?\" Atticus requested to Patch. \"I'd love to.\" Patch smiled. They soon went to the Pound Puppy tunnels. Atticus was very excited and amazed to be experiencing this with Patch. \"Well, I was gonna stay here, but since I know you're here, I'm gonna be locking myself in the basement if anyone needs me.\" Cherry said. \"Who would need you?\" Drell rolled his eyes carelessly. Cherry soon saw Forte which gave her an idea of where to stay at. \"Bye.\" she said before zipping away. \"Not gonna miss ya!\" Drell called back. Patch sang the digging song to himself as he led Atticus to Pound Puppies Headquarters. Once they made it to the Pound Puppies HQ, Atticus was amazed. \"Welcome to HQ.\" Patch smiled to Atticus. \"Man, this place is awesome!\" Atticus couldn't believe what he was seeing. \"Thanks,\" Patch said before he saw Cookie. \"Uh-oh... This might be bad.\" \"Hi there, baby, are you all right?\" Cookie cooed. \"Yeah, I'm fine, Cookie, is there something wrong?\" Patch replied. \"Actually, yes, and it involves a family that is in need of a new dog.\" Cookie said before growled as she didn't recognize Atticus. Atticus seemed nervous of Cookie's jaws of death, they seemed so much more intimidating at this height. \"Cookie, it's okay, he's with me.\" Patch tried to settle down the female boxer. \"Really?\" Cookie smiled. \"Is he a friend of yours?\" \"Well, they do call us nature's best friends.\" Patch chuckled. \"Well... All right,\" Cookie smiled before glaring. \"But if he gives you trouble, remember-\" \"I know, I know, your teeth.\" Patch remembered. Cookie smiled at him before giving Atticus a warning glare. Atticus gulped and nodded respectively. \"So, um, what's this about a dog and a family?\" Patch changed the subject. \"Come with me, and I'll tell you along the way.\" Cookie said. Patch nodded, then gestured to Atticus. \"Him too.\" \"Yes, him too.\" Cookie nodded. \"Thanks, Cookie.\" Patch smiled. Patch and Atticus then followed the female boxer to see what all the fuss was about. Atticus couldn't help but stop and stare at certain parts since he never thought he would be in the Pound Puppies Headquarters. Luckily, he had Patch with him so he would be able to keep up. \"Please try to stay focused.\" Patch whispered to Atticus. \"Sorry, buddy.\" Atticus replied sheepishly. They soon went to Lucky who would have the information. \"Hiya, Lucky.\" Patch smiled to his father figure. \"Hey, buddy,\" Lucky smiled back before he soon saw Atticus. \"Oh, who's your new friend?\" He then asked. \"You wouldn't believe me if I told you until I explained.\" Patch said. \"Try me.\" Lucky replied. \"It's Atticus.\" Patch then said. \"Weird, isn't that your owner's name?\" Lucky asked. \"No, I mean it's Atticus.\" Patch replied. \"What about Atticus?\" Lucky asked. \"Ugh...\" Patch face-pawed. \"How do I explain this?\" \"I was turned into a dog by magic.\" Atticus said. \"Yeah...\" Patch smiled sheepishly. \"Oh, Patch...\" Lucky chuckled. \"If we haven't met, I don't think I could believe in such a thing, but I do of course... Um, anyway, back to business.\" \"Oh, yes, of course, what's up?\" Patch then asked. Lucky soon showed them of why they were called to the Headquarters. Patch and Atticus came to his sides as Lucky pulled up a screen to show a bloodhound named Buddy who had been taken away by some cats. \"How humiliating,\" Patch shuddered. \"I don't recognize him in the shelter though?\" he then said about the dog. \"That's because he was from a different shelter.\" Lucky said. \"Ah, I see...\" Patch nodded. \"He wasn't taken by just any cats, he was taken by agents from Mr. Tinkles,\" Lucky then said, but the name made Patch and Atticus snicker immaturely. \"His name might be funny, but he is a force to be reckoned with.\" The male border collie then added. \"Sorry about that, Lucky...\" Atticus then said as Patch kept laughing until he was then nudged to stay focused. \"What is he?\" Patch asked. \"Some corrupted cat like the Kennel Kittens?\" \"I'm afraid more advanced and serious than that, he has plans to make every human on the face of the Earth allergic to dogs.\" Lucky explained. \"That's terrible.\" Patch frowned. \"That's crazy.\" Atticus added. \"Believe me, I know, they already have that bloodhound and they won't rest until they're on top of the domesticated animal food chain.\" Lucky said firmly and serious. \"But how will he even get humans allergic to dogs?\" Patch asked. \"That's what Strudel and the squirrels are trying to figure out,\" Lucky replied. \"Luckily one of the dog field agents Butch is going to help.\" \"What's his breed?\" Atticus asked. \"Sheepdog like Niblet, he's very wise and mentoring.\" Lucky smiled. \"Cool.\" Patch smiled. \"You'd like him,\" Lucky smiled back. \"In fact, I've heard some Intel on a puppy who reminds me a lot of you when we first met, he's going to be recruited by Butch.\" \"Cool.\" Patch smiled. \"Gah! Itchy...\" Atticus groaned. \"How do I do this again?\" \"Back hind leg.\" Patch told him. Atticus then used his back hind leg to scratch, then smiled in relief as he continued. \"Oh... That's so much better.\" Fleas started to be knocked off and killed by each scratch. There were tiny squeals and screams of death. \"Ah...\" Atticus felt so much better now. \"Man, I can see why fleas are so annoying.\" \"Now you see why we always need to take our baths.\" Cookie said. \"Oh, I know that.\" Atticus said. \"I think you could use one right about now.\" Patch smirked. \"Nope, got all of the fleas.\" Atticus smirked back. \"Uh-huh, better give you one just in case.\" Patch pushed a button. The floor then opened up and put Atticus in a tub filled with soap and water. \"Come on, seriously?!\" Atticus complained. Patch laughed. \"Sorry, Atticus, but it's bath time!\" \"Oh, you are gonna get it.\" Atticus glared to his puppy. \"Uh-oh.\" Patch smiled nervously. \"Lucky, excuse me a moment.\" Atticus said before rushing out of the tub, shaking himself dry, and ran over to his puppy. Patch screamed and laughed as he ran from Atticus. \"Those two truly do act like brothers.\" Lucky smiled. Patch laughed as Atticus held him down and started to tickle him.[Chapter 2] After a while, Atticus and Patch soon left to go to the family who needed protection. Lucky and Strudel gave them a lot of information and the two took note of what they had to do, and where one of the most important things was to not get too emotionally attatched to any of the family members. It would be hard, since dogs were usually full of love and emotional attachment to humans, but Atticus and Patch understood and they agreed upon the rules and regulations. They soon headed off to the house what they didn't know was the same house as where Mo's biological uncle and aunt and cousin were and where she would be staying for a while. \"Good luck, you guys.\" Lucky called. \"Thanks, see you real soon.\" Patch smiled to his father figure in the Pound Puppies and then dashed off. \"We'll be back as soon as we can!\" Atticus added as he joined Patch. The others waved the two off as they went to have an adventure together. \"Well, we wanted to spend some time together.\" Atticus smiled as he walked with Patch. \"Yeah, but I don't think this is what we had in mind.\" Patch said. \"Oh, well, it's better than nothing.\" Atticus shrugged. \"Let's go stop... Mr. Tinkles.\" Patch said seriously before laughing at the name again. \"Whoever gave him that name was not evil.\" Atticus said. \"I'm sorry, I know this is serious, but I can't help but laugh at that name for a cat.\" Patch replied. \"Dr. Evil's cat's name is Mr. Bigglesworth.\" Atticus then smirked. \"Never mind, that's much worse.\" Patch said. Atticus and Patch laughed together as they went on their journey. A while later, Atticus sniffed the ground to see if he could get a scent. \"Your sense of smell should be stronger now.\" Patch said to Atticus. \"Yep, it is, and I smell different kinds of dogs.\" Atticus said. \"Good!\" Patch smiled. \"This way.\" Atticus smiled back as he followed the track to where the other dogs led his nose to as one of the dog smells began to lead them to a house. Patch followed Atticus. Atticus sniffled slightly and then sneezed. \"Hay.\" \"Hay fever?\" Patch smirked teasingly. \"Ha ha, very funny.\" Atticus smirked back. The two kept walking and seemed to pass a barnyard. \"That's strange, the scent is going inside this barn.\" Atticus said. \"There must be other dogs in there, I bet that's where the one puppy Lucky told us about is.\" Patch replied. \"Should we check it?\" Atticus asked. \"Yes, just to be sure.\" Patch nodded. Atticus and Patch both soon went into the barn to be sure. They poked their heads inside to see a group of puppies together in the hay. \"Ohh, so that's why you said hay.\" Patch said. \"Hay is for horses.\" Atticus smirked. \"Ha, ha.\" Patch forced out a laugh. The two of them soon went inside. The puppies were grouped together as the two came inside. \"It'll be hard to find out which one is the one we're looking for.\" Patch said. \"No offense, but these dogs all look the same to me...\" Atticus replied. \"I think I might have found the one we're looking for.\" Patch said as he saw one of the pups not with the rest. Atticus smiled to that. Patch came to the lone pup as the others were merged close with each other. The lone pup was starting to drag a sack of oats. The other puppies seemed to be complaining about this. The lone pup then pulled on a rope with his mouth and made a flour sack rise in the barn. \"What are you doing?\" Patch asked the lone pup. \"When I pull this rope, the sack will fall on the pitchfork and send me out the window and on the way to freedom, so step back.\" The lone pup replied and then told his siblings. \"What is it with you?\" Another pup scoffed. \"You guys don't want freedom?\" Atticus asked. \"Sure, we'd like it, if it wasn't for one of HIS hair-brained schemes.\" Another puppy mocked. \"Hair-brained schemes?\" Patch asked. \"Oh, forget them, I want adventure,\" The lone pup spoke up for his own beliefs. \"Not wait for someone to take me to some boring house.\" \"You don't know, it might actually become your greatest adventure yet.\" Patch said. \"What's wrong with a family that loves you?\" One pup asked. \"Not to mention, free food, a warm place to sleep.\" Another pup added. Another pup turned over from the hay and then stood on all fours. \"And you can go to the bathroom wherever you want!\" The other four puppies glorified this like it was the best thing ever. \"You do realize you will have to go to the bathroom outside onto a tree, right?\" Patch asked. The pups then dropped their excitement. \"Schmucks...\" Patch grumbled under his breath. \"Don't you wanna do something exciting?\" the lone pup asked his siblings with a smile as he craved adventure. \"You remind me of myself of when I was a young pup.\" Patch smiled down at the lone pup. \"Really?\" the lone pup asked with a smile back. \"Oh, totally,\" Patch replied. \"I was just like you when I lived with my brothers and sisters.\" \"Cool.\" The lone pup smiled. \"I wanted to be like Thunderbolt,\" Patch smiled back. \"What do you wanna be? Like a police dog?\" \"No, something like a Russian space dog!\" The lone pup beamed in excitement. \"Or sample the Great Bones of Europe!\" The lone pup's brothers didn't seem to be interested in either of those. \"Oh, forget it, see you puppies later.\" The lone pup said as he pulled on the rope with his mouth and set himself on the pitchfork to get out of this place for good. Patch soon began to do some calculating at which direction the pitchfork was pointing to. \"Oh, boy, I can't watch.\" one pup said before closing his eyes and then opening one anyway. \"This oughta be good.\" another pup added in sarcasm. \"World, here I come!\" the lone pup called as he pulled on the rope. Patch was soon finished with his calculations and where the result was not good. The flour sack landed on the fork and sent the lone pup flying in the air. \"Oh, no! Watch out for that-\" Patch tried to warn. CRASH! The lone pup had missed the window and fell down from his fail. Patch then groaned and winced. \"That's gotta hurt.\" Atticus winced. \"Back from your adventure so soon, Scooby Doofus?\" one pup smirked. \"You guys aren't being supportive.\" Atticus said. The lone pup poked his head out from the hay only for a bucket to land on top of him. \"You okay?\" Patch asked the lone pup. \"I guess so...\" the lone pup replied softly and sadly in humiliation. They soon heard something like a chainsaw. They turned to where the sound was coming from and there appeared to be a buzz saw from underneath the wooden floor. The lone pup poked his head out from under the bucket and saw his brothers staring at the floor until a perfect circle was cut and it fell from its standing after the saw had successfully cut it. \"That's interesting.\" Patch said. The four other puppies went to check out to see what caused that, but a Doberman rushed out instantly. \"All right! Into the hole!\" the Doberman barked orders. \"Let's go! Top-secret operation! Into the hole! Double-time! Into the hole!\" Patch and Atticus soon hid the lone pup under the bucket so then the doberman wouldn't see him. The other puppies were forced to move however as the Doberman instructed them to. \"I've seen better hustle on a dashboard Chihuahua,\" the Doberman called like a sharp drill sergeant and the lone pup watched from under the bucket while Atticus and Patch stayed out of this. \"Wag it!\" \"We have to make sure the lone pup doesn't get spotted by the Doberman.\" Atticus whispered. Patch nodded as he looked nervous around the Doberman. A mini van was pulling up to the barn as there was a sign that read 'PUPPIES TO A GOOD HOME'. A woman came out and the farmer greeted her as she came across the barnyard as the chickens were gathered together. A familiar teenage girl came out with the woman. \"Howdy, over here!\" The farmer called to the two. \"Watch your step, dear.\" The woman smiled to the teenage girl. \"I'm not afraid to get a little dirty, Auntie.\" Mo said. \"Of course you aren't.\" the woman chuckled. Back in the barn, Atticus and Patch watched as the Doberman let others of his breed out from the hole which made them concerned and curious. \"He does realize that the family need a beagle or a bloodhound, right?\" Patch whispered. \"I... I don't know, Patch, I stopped questioning these things a long time ago.\" Atticus sighed. The Doberman talked with the puppies like they were soldiers in the army and he was their sergeant. \"Wow...\" Patch and Atticus said. The lone pup looked interested as the adult Doberman told them about their mission and adventure. After they saluted and called back to him, the Doberman went back under the hole while the five pups were lined up liked trained army men. \"These are the cutest beagles you've ever seen.\" the farmer told the woman and Mo. \"Mo...\" Atticus whispered once he saw his girlfriend. \"Looks like we found Mo and her biological aunt.\" Patch whispered. \"Biological...\" Atticus whispered back, he was often very curious of Mo's birth family at times. \"And for Gabriel's sake, don't forget to wag those tails!\" the Doberman whispered sharply to his soldiers before he went back into hiding. \"Come on, girl.\" Mo called down. Angel came to Mo's side and she sniffed around for fellow puppies. \"What do we do?\" Atticus whispered to Patch. \"Stay still...\" Patch said, but then noticed Angel was there. The farmer, woman, and Mo took a look at the Doberman puppies and Angel looked confused which even made her utter out a questioning whimper. \"I thought these were beagle puppies, Aunt Carolyn?\" Mo said to the woman in confusion. \"I thought so too.\" The woman said. Patch and Atticus soon got an idea as they rushed to the bucket to get it off the lone pup. The farmer and Carolyn knelt down in front of the Doberman puppies at first. Patch soon got the bucket off the lone pup so he would be noticed. The lone pup whimpered and then came over toward Carolyn. \"Ooh, Aunt Carolyn, this one's looking at you.\" Mo pointed as Angel came to see the lone pup up close. Angel seemed to have a look as if she knew this one was the one for Mo's cousin. She came close to the lone beagle puppy and then smiled. The lone pup looked nervous, then looked up to Angel, tilting his head at her. \"Hey, it's all right, I don't bite.\" Angel chuckled. \"That's a relief.\" The lone pup sighed. Angel smiled and walked out with the beagle puppy. \"Oh... Hey, you look adorable...\" Carolyn cooed as she picked up the beagle puppy and smiled brightly to him. \"What did I just do?\" The lone pup asked. \"Hello! You are coming home with me,\" Carolyn smiled as she hugged the puppy and walked away with him. \"Come along, Mo, I'm sure this is the perfect one.\" \"Come, Angel.\" Mo whistled for her puppy. Angel soon came to her before looking to see Atticus and Patch. She tilted her head, wondering if she really saw what she saw. \"Do you think your cousin will love him?\" Carolyn smiled to Mo. \"I just know that it'll take some time for him to adjust to him.\" Mo said. Angel came closer to the back. \"Angel, come!\" Mo warned her puppy. Angel soon sniffed the back of the barn and where she saw Patch and Atticus who both smiled sheepishly. She then hid a smirk as she recognized them instantly and something inner had told her that the wolf dog was in fact Atticus only transformed. Mo soon came over to Angel to see what was taking her. \"Angel, we don't have time for-\" she was about to say. Angel then snarled as she bit on Mo's pant leg to pull her to the back of the barnyard. \"GIRL!\" Mo scolded slightly. \"This isn't like you, this-\" she then looked to see the pair in the back. \"Patch...?\" \"Um, hi, Mo, what are you doing here?\" Patch smiled nervously. \"I could ask you the same question.\" Mo smirked as she picked up Angel in her arms who also had a smirk. \"We can explain.\" Atticus smiled nervously. \"Atticus, that is you...\" Mo replied. \"I thought I recognized those dreamy blue eyes.\" \"How did you get turned into that dog form?\" Angel asked. \"We'll explain later at Mo's cousin's house.\" Atticus said. \"Okay, come on, just be careful.\" Mo warned them as she went to her aunt's car with Angel. Patch and Atticus followed quietly and carefully. \"Our lives sure are exciting.\" Angel said. \"You're telling me.\" Mo chuckled to her puppy. Angel was put in the back while Atticus and Patch hid there and Mo rode up front with her aunt. \"Do you think Scott will be surprised, Mo?\" Carolyn asked. \"I'm sure he will, Auntie.\" Mo smiled. They soon put the lone pup into a box. \"Ooh! I know!\" Mo said as she then took Angel's ribbon from Elizabeth and decided to tie it around the box to make it look like a real special surprise. \"Perfect.\" Carolyn smiled. Mo smiled back as they soon drove back to the house. ","Summary":" It was a typical Saturday morning.

Huh. H.Q. could build something so much better! Max thought unimpressed. As Max watched the humans board the rocket, he noticed a small cat slip in behind them. The cat was wearing a spacesuit that had the Cat H.Q. symbol on it. Max began to bark frantically, trying to warn his owner. \"Quiet down Max!\" His owner shoved him off the window of the space station. Max saw his chance! A human worker had just come back from afternoon coffee break! He dashed out the door, tripping the human and making him spill his coffee and donuts. He raced outside but it was too late. T- 3, 2, 1, lift-off! The cat smirked at Max as the spaceship blasted off into the sky. Max dashed around the corner of the building. He pulled up the computer on his H.Q. Doggy Deluxe collar. \"Lou, this is Agent 1002M, we have a serious problem. I repeat, we have a serious problem.\"[Chapter 2] \"Wee-oh! Wee-oh!\" It was six o'clock in the morning and I woke with a start. \"Ah, it's just a firetruck.\" I had been dreaming that cats had taken over the world! It's one of my only fears. I'm Zap. I'm a Black Newfoundland Dog. I work for a secret organization that fights evil cats and saves the world. I'm also a stray and I live in Wolf Alley, San Francisco. \"I woke up just in time to go to H.Q!\" I said out loud as I slipped on my Doggy Deluxe collar. My collar is chock full of useful gadgets and transportation systems. I padded over to a corner in my dumpster and pressed the wall. A paw scanner came up, I scanned my paw and WHOOSH! The floor dropped and I found myself in a Rocket Sled. My seat belt came on and the roof slid over me. I pushed down a lever and the sled sped away at 900 hundred miles per hour! \"Whoo hoooo!\" I shouted sticking my head out the window. But as soon as the ride started, it stopped. The door opened spraying steam everywhere. I walked up to a sliding door that had a paw scanner next to it. A bulldog's face was above a paw print to scan your paw. \"Good morning Agent Zap.\" the bulldog said in a mechanical voice. \"Please activate paw scan now.\" I scanned my paw. \"Access granted.\" the door opened. Our H.Q. is the center of all the H.Q's. It is located under San Francisco and it's full name is Dog World Headquarters. It has training stations, bathrooms, restaurants, shops, a science lab called Covert Ops and more! There is an elevator leading to different floors, walkways and offices. I got in the elevator and it took me to the highest floor where our boss, Lou Pawz the beagle works. When I went into the office, most of the team was there. Lou was at his desk and Butch the anatolian shepherd, Diggs the german shepherd and my best friend Rocky the rottweiler were sitting in front of him with Catherine and Alley, two cats from M.E.O.W.S. (Mousers Enforcing Our World Safety) where the good cats work. Seamus the pigeon was also there. \"Good morning agent Zap. We have a mission for you and this part of the team. An agent from N.A.S.A. reported seeing a cat get on a rocket ship and another agent saw a cat sneaking around San Francisco. We need you to get out there and see what's going down.\" Lou reported. We walked out of Lou's office and decided to split up into groups. \"I'll take the big city!\" I volunteered. \"Comin' with, dude.\" Rocky said. \"I'll go too.\" Butch barked. \"We'll cover the neighborhoods surrounding.\" said the rest of the team. \"Sure.\" said Diggs rolling his eyes. \"I just have to be with the cats and bird.\" he grinned. \"Let's go guys.\" I woofed. So we headed off to the big city. When we got there, We started to look around. \"Anyone hungry?\" asked rummaging around in dumpster. \"Yo, what do you have?\" Rocky asked, drooling. \"Agents!\" Butch scolded. \"We got to stay on the job!\" \"Aww, but its so delicious!\" I said with a mouth full of beef. \"Come on.\" Butch said, walking away. I sighed, but followed him and Rocky did the same. But we didn't know, someone was watching us.

I wanted to let you know, this story is a remake of a story I started writing a while ago. I have improved a lot since, so I wanted to redo it and make it better. It has the same basic plot line as it did before; you may have read it; it had the same title. I have now deleted so it will not take up space. So anyway, I just wanted to let you guys know that, so here is the new and improved version of Cats and Dogs: Special Edition! Prologue The rancid air hit the roof of a lone dog's mouth with such a force that it put him off balance. He was a country dog; there was no doubt, and he was not yet used to smells of the city. A lean dog, he was, with pointed ears and a gray and white body. His long muzzle was pointed high into the night air, as he sniffed around for whatever he was looking for. The dog's ears were on alert as well. In fact, his whole body was on the ready, but for what it is unknown. He was rigid, standing there, sniffing and listening. Sniffing and listening. Crack! The dog nearly jumped into the air at the faint sound. He whirled around to try and find the source. But as soon as he did, he his head being bashed with something hard and heavy from behind, and he collapsed onto the ground. The dog was dizzy and disorientated, and the last thing he saw, were the shadows of two slender felines standing over him, and then, everything went black.[Chapter 2] Chapter One The first thing I smelled that morning was the delicious smell of a grocery bag, chock full of meats and maybe a sandwich or two. I rolled over on my bed of shredded and stained blankets, sniffing the air. I slowly opened my eyes, looking around to try and find the source. Breakfast had come to me this morning. My eyes soon fell upon a white plastic bag, with red letters running down its side. That was the first thing I noticed. But of course, another dog was already there. He had black fur and brown points. His muzzle was blunt, but it looked strong, as his entire muscular body did. I was still half asleep, and I wouldn't have recognized the dog except for the dead give away. He was wearing a black and red baseball cap. It sat backwards on his head. I smiled and heaved myself up from my bed, trotting over to the bag. The name's Bolt. Zap Wolf Bolt, and I'm a canine agent at Dog World headquarters, where we fight off the worst of the worst evil felines. My team's got the best skills on this side of Main Street. \"You always beat me to it.\" I remarked, standing beside the dog. The dog pulled his head out of the bag, and he was holding a piece of fried chicken in his mouth. \"You're just lazy.\" He teased. \"Rocky, you'd do almost anything for a bit of food.\" I said, pawing at a bit of bread and beef that was on the ground. \"It's not like we're in a life or death situation here. If we ever ran out of food, we could get some at H.Q.\" \"Yeah, well I'm not taking any chances.\" Rocky barked with his mouth full of meat. \"Especially when the idiot humans are careless enough to leave an entire bag of chow out here for the takin'.\" His head had soon disappeared in the bag again. I gulped down a hoagie full of all the essentials, and sat down to bite a bit of dirt from my paw pads. It had rained a little bit, and the mud in the alleyway was deep. A rustling came from behind me; I turned around to see a brown dog with long hair jumping out of a dumpster. Ivy. \"Hi Zap!\" She barked cheerily, with an old pack of french fries in her mouth. \"Hey Ivy.\" I replied, lapping up a bit of water that had collected in a garbage can lid. Ivy ate the fries in three seconds and then jumped up onto the lid of a dumpster. She yipped loudly and knocked open the top. The head of a gray dog popped up. She had short hair and floppy, long ears. It was Shades. She yawned. \"I was trying to sleep Ivy… \" Shades growled. \"I didn't get to bed until late last night with you howling like Headquarters had fallen!\" She dragged herself out of the dumpster and over to a dust patch where she dropped down a rolled in it. \"How do any of you sleep?\" \"We're good at blocking out the noise.\" Rocky answered, shaking his fur clean of dirt. I grinned and left the pack. I had to get my trainee, Sage, the little Newf puppy up and ready to go for the day. She was a Landseer, with a black and white coat and amber eyes. But of course, the rookie hadn't quite gotten used to the whole 'getting up early to go to work' thing yet. The pup lay on an old pillow that was up against the corner. I went over to her and jostled her awake. Sage rolled over to face me. \"Time to get up already?\" She softly said with a little yawn in her voice. \"The early dog gets the scraps, kid.\" I said. \"When you're an agent, you gotta be on alert. You could get called in at any minute.\" \"Thanks for the lesson boss.\" Sage got up and reluctantly followed me over to the food. Our day had officially begun.[Chapter 3] Chapter Two We finished eating our breakfast early that morning, and we were ready to head to H.Q. Sage and I walked over behind a rusted dumpster. The green paint had chipped away to reveal the metal base in some places. I grinned at Sage. She gulped nervously. She knew what was coming; we were leaving for H.Q., and she hadn't gotten used to our form of transportation yet. I turned to the brick wall behind me, and placed my paw on top of it. A bright light went down the brick as it scanned my paw, and as soon as it finished, I felt the floor dropping beneath me. When I looked again, I saw I was in a tunnel lit with light blue lights. I was sitting inside one of the H.Q. Rocket Sleds, a streamlined vessel that took the agents into the headquarters. Sage sat next to me, looking a little dizzy. She shook her head to focus, and as soon as she did, I pressed down a lever in front of me. The Rocket Sled quickly turned on, flames blasting out the back of it. We sped away as I pushed the lever up all the way to the top. Sage sat quietly, her paws covering her eyes. I grinned, opening the window slightly and letting the wind rush through my fur. Soon enough, our transportation slowed as it pulled into port. The door opened, steam spraying everywhere, and I hopped out. Sage soon followed me, clearly glad the ride was over. We both walked up onto a platform near a metal door that had the D.O.G. icon on it- a paw print and a badge. A small computer screen stood on a standard next to the door. \"Good morning Agent Zap and AIT Sage. Please scan your pawprint now.\" An electronic voice said. We did as it told us, pressing our paws onto the screen. \"Access granted.\" The metal doors in front of us split open, revealing the grand headquarters inside. Sage and I stepped through, looking around the area. However many times I had entered through those door, I was still amazed. The main floor had the same icon as the door. Dogs of all kinds rushed across it. On the left side of the main floor, there were three tunnels that lead to different parts of H.Q. On the right wall, there was the tech lab, the gym, the cafeteria and the bathroom. If you looked up, you could see giant screens that broadcasted news across H.Q.. There were also several different floors that you could access with an elevator. The entire area was lit with soft lights. I looked to the left of me to see Rocky and the rest of the strays coming into H.Q. from the Rocket Sled ports. They walked over to where Sage and I were. We all planned to go to out boss, Lou's office. \"Lou probably wants us for a mission, ya know, since Kitty Galore is launching her plan.\" Rocky said. I nodded. \"Sage, we better head up there too. Remember Lou wanted to talk to you about going on a real mission?\" Sage's eyes immediately lit up. \"Yeah! I hope he lets me go with you guys!\" I smiled. All of us headed towards the elevator. We clambered on and headed up to the top floor. When we reached the top, we got out and went down the hallway to Lou's office. The sliding glass doors parted and I saw Butch the Anatolian Shepherd standing in front of Lou's desk. \"Ah, good morning agents.\" Lou gave us a nod as we came into the room. \"I'm glad you arrived. The threat of Kitty Galore is getting worse, so I'm sending Butch in to pick up the new recruit. Rocky, Shades and Ivy, I want you to deliver this package to our undercover agents. They'll need it for their missions in the field. The delivery area is guarded by dangerous henchcats, so you'll need to be careful. Zap, Sage, I want to talk to you.\" We all could sense the urgency in Lou's voice. We knew that we had little time to track down Kitty and stop her before it was too late. The other agents dispersed and went off to their missions without a word. Sage and I stayed behind, standing in front of Lou. \"Sage, I have been evaluating your progress and I believe that you are indeed ready to go on a real mission. The mission we send you on will most likely be a simple delivery or pickup mission. You'll be sent with Zap of course.\" Lou explained to us. \"For now, there is a training mission much like the one you'll be sent on being set up in training room A. You two can head on down there and do that so you can keep up on your skills.\" \"Yes sir.\" Sage and I both said. We exited the grand office, the glass doors sliding closed behind us.

Then his baby was born and he felt such happiness he though he was going to burst, though Ben did try to tell him it would be just like that, one moment you're a man, a husband even, and then you're a father, that was the most important role in your life. He should've believed his President. Then he decided to remain in service, protecting Ben from all the shit the world had to throw at him, at the US, and it felt... It felt right, it felt good, like he was contributing to making the world a better place, to making his daughter's future a little bit brighter because her country was that much safer with him having Ben's back. Life was as it was, despite everything. He looked after Ben, went back home and looked after Leah and Lynne, recycle every day. It was easy enough, it was fine. And then his dumbass of a charge asked him to teach him a feel moves. Trumbull had been in the room, and his snickers were not appreciated in the least, Mike knew what face he was making, alright, he didn't need the Vice President to mock him on top of that, Ben's puppy dog face was enough. God, he was guarding a man who could stare down terrorists who wanted to slice his head off, and yet the same man could look at him like he was a hungry dog who just needed a hug. Lord help him, because he was weak, and he found himself nodding while grumbling for the Vice President to kindly got fuck himself and for the President to stop looking so smug. \"I don't see why you need me to teach you anything\" – Mike complained as his fellow Secret Service agents stood around the boxing ring, trying not to snort at him, the utter assholes. Ben got on the ring with little effort, though his form was nothing to write home about. \"Hey, it's been a while since I had to throw a punch, and... Recent events have showed me the importance of keeping it up\" – he cleared his throat awkwardly, and Mike nodded firmly. Yeah, 'recent events', alright. \"You could literally have any trainer in here to get you in shape, sir, why me?\" \"You're the best guy for it, aren't you?\" \"No, I'm not, I've never taught anyone\" – he definitely heard a string of snickers around him, but when he glared at the agents, they were all appropriately stone faced. \"Pull the other one, you've trained half the agents in service here\" \"You're mistaken, sir\" \"Just accept the fact that you're the guy I respect and trust to have my back, okay? Hell, I trust you to have my kid's back, and that's saying something, so please stop whining and come teach me how to take a punch already\" \"Okay, but if anyone comes after me to tell me off for giving the President of the United States two black eyes, it's on you. Sir\" \"I've told the make–up people they better research how to cover bruises, if that's your only concern, Mike\" \"It's definitely not, sir, but, I doubt you'll hear me out, since you haven't so far\" \"Mike. Just come and punch me, can you do that?\" With a deep sigh, Mike looked over Ben's form, clearly lacking after years in politics, and wondered how he would ever get the most powerful man in the world to back down without bruising his pretty face and his ego, neither of which he wanted to get anywhere near to. \"Don't even think about it\" – Ben said with a frown. \"Sir?\" \"You can go easy on me, I mean, I don't need full on Mike Banning to come bash my head in, but just... Come on, man, I'm not that rusty\" \"Fine\" – Mike rolled his eyes and after a few moments stalking him, he threw the first punch, a soft one just to get Ben started. It connected. Mike made a sound his colleagues would describe as 'a kitten being denied milk' later on (completely without him asking too, jackasses, the lot of them) when Ben widened his eyes and was thrown back several steps. \"Oh shit. Sir! Sir, are you alright?! Do you need a medic?! Sir! Sir, please!\" \"Mike, Mike. I'm fine, really\" – the blond adjusted his jaw and snorted – \"That was you going easy on me, huh? Man, can't see how much it's gonna hurt when you come at me at full force\" \"That's not happening, sir\" \"We're in the ring, you nearly clocked me with a love tap, call me Ben, seriously\" Mike sighed and focused on the task at hand again. How to, er, love tap Ben and still not hurt the stubborn man? He was used to fighting guys who either could take it, like agents, or guys he didn't care if they could take it, like his enemies. Ben, on the other hand, was a whole other beast, and it was a very annoying one to even think about. The President of the United States was staring at him and motioning him to hit him. God damnit. They moved gently, slowly, with Ben taking the initiative and trying to get at Mike, but he was too slow, too weak, and Mike simply dodged without even thinking about it. Ben grinned bashfully, fully aware of his shortcomings, and Mike felt a little bad. The man was a born leader, he had a bright mind and an even stronger spirit, he didn't need to prove himself, not to him, not to anyone. Except they had both faced down scum down in London, had fought tooth and nail for their lives, so maybe the same nightmares that kept Mike awake at night sometimes also haunted Ben, and maybe... Maybe Mike could help him get through them by assisting him, by training him. Not to a sharp edge, that would take too much time and energy, and Ben had neither to spare, but Mike would make sure Ben could take a punch and deliver one back. His smile made Ben falter, though. Even the other agents moved in place, looking a little nervous. Oh fine, so Mike had a Reputation now, so what. \"It's okay, Ben\" – he tried for reassuring – \"Let's go again, and this time? Come at me like I've told you your mother likes to charge ten cents a 'dance'\" – the blond snorted and nodded. \"Alright\" – he said simply, and his eyes shone with amusement and enthusiasm. Ben was his to protect, but maybe it was time he taught Ben how to protect himself, even if Mike had no plans to let him get the chance. Outside the ring, that is. One day, Ben would get a taste of Mike's real punches, and it wouldn't do for the President of the United States to show up to his meetings looking like he'd walked into every single wall and door on his way over, now would it?

Considering London, one—or several—of them just might. Helped along, no doubt, by high explosives. \"Mike…\" \"I had a feeling it might be one of those days, Sir.\" One of those days. Where it seemed the whole world would come crashing down. Like the day he was traveling to a Christmas party/fundraising dinner for his reelection campaign. Like the day after the first Fourth of July of his second term. Like the day terrorists had ripped half of London apart killing visiting heads of state, and then ripped apart the other half trying to kill him. And now it was one of those days again. \"What do we do?\" Because three things Asher had learned as President were: One, the Job was too big to know everything yourself so you had to trust others to know what you didn't. Two, there wasn't enough time to do it all yourself so you had to trust others to do the stuff you couldn't. And Three, when everything fell apart and Hell decided to visit earth, you could trust Mike Banning to run, drive, shoot, knife, blow-up, ass-kick, and karate-chop his way out. \"No tactical nukes?\" he asked, trying to inject some levity in a very un-funny situation. \"Not in the Beast, Sir. Not since Cerberus was activated,\" Mike said absently as he considered the buildings around them, consulting the various contingency plans and maps he had memorized and Asher dimly recalled being briefed on. That was another thing Asher had learned as President. You weren't always briefed on stuff so you knew what was going on. You were briefed so that you knew that others knew what was going on. For all Asher could tell, Mike Banning was consulting the same multicolored oddly-shaped dice Asher had used to play with in college. \"I know a guy,\" Mike said finally. \"Like Jacqueline Marshall?\" \"Jax is one of the good guys, Sir.\" \"Meaning this guy isn't.\" Banning got that look. \"Let me put it this way. The last time we spoke he said it was a good thing you lived halfway across the country because otherwise he might have to kill me to kill you.\" Asher gave him a look of his own. \"Relax. He wants to kill you himself. Not let these assholes do the job for him.\" \"That's not a comfort.\" \"It wasn't meant to be.\" \"I just hope the locals know to stay inside and keep their heads down.\" Mike's head did that thing, not quite a swivel, not quite a nod, where he was staying alert but also obviously considering something. \"It's Detroit,\" he said finally. \"Meaning?\" \"They either know to stay inside and keep their heads' down, or they are completely inured to it.\" ","Summary":" Disclaimer: Not owned by me. \"Since when is there an armory in the Beast?\" \"We've always had a w"},{"Movie":"Olympus Has Fallen","Title":"Après la haine","Author":"Glasgow","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12389973","Passage":"[Chapter 1] Un coucou aux aventureuses qui passeront pas ici :) Il était donc dit que je succomberais à nouveau rapidement à ces personnages tellement chers à mon coeur. Et pourtant j'ai bien d'autres fics en cours de rédaction, auxquelles je m'étais promis de consacrer mon temps... Mais bref, ce fandom manque tellement de fics en français que je me sens l'envie, avec mes modestes moyens, de réparer cette injustice. Ce petit texte se situe directement après les évènements de La chute de Londres, dont j'ai toujours trouvé la fin trop brutale, trop rapide. Je me rattrape ici, mais à ma sauce donc vous devinez à quoi vous devez vous attendre ^^ Une bonne lecture :) ooOoo Enfin enfermé dans sa cabine, à bord d'Air Force One, qui venait de décoller en urgence de l'aéroport anglais de Stansted, Benjamin se laissa tomber assis sur son lit. Il avait faim, il avait soif, mal partout et besoin d'une douche et de vêtements propres, pourtant il était pour l'instant incapable de faire le moindre mouvement. Dire qu'il était épuisé aurait été un euphémisme. Il se sentait complétement vidé et n'était pas sûr d'être à nouveau capable de se lever, encore moins de reprendre ensuite une vie normale. Les douze dernières heures avaient été tellement intenses, autant physiquement que mentalement, qu'il devait encore digérer. Le peu d'énergie qu'il lui restait était dédié à cela désormais. Vivre avec et continuer, encore une fois, comme s'il était condamné encore et encore à voir les gens qui l'entouraient, qui étaient là pour lui, être tués… Bien des gens étaient morts aujourd'hui à Londres. Des innocents qui avaient été au mauvais endroit, au mauvais moment, d'autres tués volontairement parce que leur mission était de le protéger lui, il avait perdu une amie également. Il avait tué plusieurs hommes lui aussi, encore qu'il doute qu'ils méritent le nom d'hommes, mais cela demeurait perturbant. Sa relation avec Mike avait irrémédiablement changé durant ces quelques heures également. Mike avait veillé sur lui évidemment, volant à son secours chaque fois qu'il semblait n'y avoir aucun espoir. Mais après tout n'était-il pas payé pour cela ? L'agent avait ceci dit outrepassé ses attributions lorsqu'il l'avait embrassé. La suite avait été tellement intense qu'il n'avait plus guère eu le temps d'y penser, mais à présent cela le travaillait plus que tout le reste. Probablement une façon de se concentrer sur la seule chose qui n'avait pas été dramatique, pour s'éviter de perdre la raison. Il se connaissait assez pour savoir que le reste lui reviendrait bien assez tôt en pleine figure et qu'y faire face serait difficile. Cela avait été pareil après l'attaque des Nord-Coréens. Grâce à Mike, il se voyait offrir un petit délai non négligeable. Cet homme savait décidément prendre soin de lui de bien des manières. Voilà qui s'appelait prendre son boulot à cœur. Le Président se passa une main lasse sur le visage, grimaçant en effleurant une pommette enflée et un nez qui heureusement ne semblait pas cassé. Son médecin viendrait l'examiner bien sûr, ils étaient tous tellement inquiets, mais ils avaient été si pressés de décoller et s'éloigner au cas où une menace quelconque demeurait, que personne n'avait pensé à refuser quand il avait demandé à rester un peu seul. La solitude était le meilleur moyen pour penser et il avait tellement de chose à penser. En se concentrant un peu, il pouvait presque sentir la caresse des lèvres qui avaient effleurées les siennes… ooOoo Ils couraient dans les tunnels surchauffés du métro depuis ce qui lui semblait être une éternité quand Mike lui avait accordé une pause. Occupé à reprendre son souffle, Benjamin avait laissé la panique le gagner, ne se contrôlant de justesse que parce que c'était un exercice auquel il se prêtait quotidiennement. Ce fois, ce fut Mike, entre sa propre colère et sa compréhension à son égard, qui parvint à l'apaiser, après lui avoir fait la promesse, et pas de gaieté de cœur, de l'exécuter en cas de capture imminente. Même si c'était un extrême dont il préférait se passer, il avait apprécié cette promesse, signe qu'il pourrait compter jusqu'au bout sur son ami, quelque soit la situation. Les propos ensuite avaient été moins cohérents. Il déplorait les dizaines de morts, encore une fois par sa faute, se flagellant pour les actes de fous. La suite, il ne l'avait pas vu venir. Mike n'avait pas dit un mot, s'était contenté de l'embrasser brutalement. Un baiser sans douceur, sans concession, la conclusion logique de mois d'un flirt en apparence bon enfant, d'heures où la tension n'avait cessé de grimper, l'adrénaline inondant violemment les veines. Cela avait eu le mérite de faire taire Benjamin. Et s'ils n'avaient plus abordé ensuite le sujet, lorsqu'ils s'étaient remis en route lui n'avait eu de cesse d'y repenser. Un bon contrepoint à la folie qui se déchainait autour d'eux. A la réflexion, c'était peut-être bien là la seule raison de la conduite de Mike. Pas d'attirance de son côté, pas d'envie, juste une façon de lui changer les idées, si les choses venaient à empirer. Et empirer, elles ne s'étaient pas privées de le faire. Face à Barkawi, à sa propre mort qu'il n'avait aucune raison de ne pas penser imminente, Benjamin était demeuré étrangement calme, lançant des piques, réagissant à peine aux attaques. A l'esprit, il n'y avait eu que son fils et Mike, les deux qu'il regrettait vraiment devoir quitter. Mike une fois de plus était arrivé à temps, l'avait sorti de là pour ne s'éloigner ensuite qu'une fois à l'abri dans cette cabine. Et Ben en venait à regretter qu'il ait justement fini par le quitter. Pour parler, autant des pertes à déplorer que de ce qu'ils avaient partagé dans ce souterrain. Pour pouvoir l'embrasser à nouveau également. Parce que s'il y avait songé parfois ces derniers temps le soir seul dans son lit, ce n'était toujours qu'un fantasme sans guère de fondement. Aujourd'hui ça n'aurait pu être plus tangible et la distance qu'avait ensuite gardée Mike avait été un retour sur terre douloureusement tangible lui aussi. Evidemment, les évènements qui avaient suivi n'avaient guère été propices à une conversation à cœur ouvert, c'était ce qui le rassurait. Mais la suite apparaissait terriblement nébuleuse et il n'avait aucune idée quant à la façon dont il réagirait en le revoyant. ooOoo Les yeux fermés, la tension refluant lentement malgré les questions en suspens, Benjamin sursauta quand on frappa à la porte. - Entrez, lança-t-il d'une voix qui n'avait pas encore retrouvé toute son assurance. Mike, puisque ça ne pouvait être que lui, fit son apparition, verrouillant derrière lui, ce qu'il ne faisait jamais mais les dernières heures avaient de quoi rendre parano n'importe qui. Il s'était douché, comme en témoignaient ses cheveux encore humides, et changé. S'il avait bien les traits tirés, il ne donnait guère l'impression d'avoir traversé l'enfer. Benjamin ne s'en sentit que plus épuisé et plus sale. Ses vêtements étaient tâchés de sang, et pas que le sien, son visage marqué, tuméfié et couvert de poussière. Mike cependant ne sembla pas s'en offusquer en s'asseyant près de lui, le fixant avec inquiétude. - Pourquoi portez-vous encore ces vêtements, Monsieur ? Benjamin haussa les épaules, grimaçant quand cela réveilla la douleur. Son corps entier semblait le faire souffrir. - Aucune idée. Je crois qu'il me fait un peu de temps… pour réaliser, tenter de comprendre… - J'espère que vous ne recommencez pas à culpabiliser. - Bien sûr que si. Comment pourrait-il en être autrement ? A plus forte raison que davantage que tous ces morts, que personne ne devrait oublier, c'est à un autre sujet foutrement plus personnel que je pense. Et j'ai honte de ça étant donné les circonstances. - Après ce que vous avez traversé, je pense que vous êtes en droit de vous montrer un peu égoïste. Vous pensez à Connor j'imagine. Maintenant que nous sommes dans l'espace aérien international, qu'on ne risque définitivement plus rien, je vais demander qu'on l'appelle pour vous, qu'on vous le passe. - Mike, l'interrompit Benjamin d'un ton sans appel, vous le faites exprès pour vous amuser ou vous n'avez définitivement pas de cœur ? - Monsieur ? Quel putain de comédien, constata Benjamin qui était incapable de deviner ce qu'il avait en tête. Rien ne lui serait décidément épargné. Ne lui restait qu'à foncer, il affronterait ensuite les conséquences le moment venu. - Ce baiser, tout à l'heure…, commença-t-il donc. - Oh. Foncer tu parles ! Le Président se retrouva à cours de mots à peine avait-il commencé. Mais au moins avait-il provoqué une réaction, quoi que pas celle attendue. Mike en effet arborait à présent un sourire amusé. Il comprit enfin à ce constat ce qui lui avait échappé jusque-là. - Vous le faisiez exprès, dit-il, hésitant entre le soulagement et l'exaspération. Ne pas en parler juste pour que je sois celui qui met ses tripes sur la table. - Pour ma défense, je n'étais pas certain de la conduite à adopter, plaida l'agent. Ce que j'ai fait… je n'avais rien prémédité. Ça m'a pris comme ça. Et je n'étais pas sûr que vous ne me le reprocheriez pas ensuite. Ça m'a juste semblé… être la meilleure chose à faire sur le moment. - C'était la meilleure chose à faire. Quoi que j'aurais préféré que ça ait lieu dans un contexte moins dramatique. - Ben ? - Quoi ? Ça te surprend si je te dis que ça faisait un moment que j'espérais ce genre d'initiative de ta part ? Apparemment, c'était pourtant réciproque puisque c'est la première chose qui t'est venue à l'esprit alors qu'on risquait nos vies. Mike ne releva pas le tutoiement soudain, ce pourquoi Benjamin lui fut reconnaissant, même si lui-même n'en avait pas dit davantage concernant l'emploi de son surnom, alors qu'habituellement, quand le contexte s'y prêtait, il devait le supplier de l'appeler ainsi. Non, Mike se contenta de rester silencieux un moment à le fixer. C'était aussi bien, Benjamin lui-même en était à ne plus savoir quoi dire. Il avait fantasmé dessus bien souvent, mais se trouvait à présent bien démuni à présent que ce baiser était entre eux, flottant là comme une présence intemporelle mais bien réelle, créant un malaise qui n'aurait pourtant pas dû être. Des gens s'embrassaient par milliers chaque jour, des premiers baisers étaient échangés dans le monde entier en permanence. C'était quelque chose de simple, alors pourquoi devait-il en être autrement du leur? Justement parce que c'était le leur. Benjamin n'était pas dupe, jamais il n'aurait dû être attiré par l'autre homme, à cause de sa fonction, à cause de leur amitié, ça n'avait pas lieu d'être. Ce n'était pas raisonnable, c'était comme vendre son âme au diable, ça n'en valait certainement pas la peine au vue des conséquences inévitables. Il savait tout cela, pourtant il ne voulait rien d'autre que recommencer, encore et encore, jusqu'à ce que le monde, ce monde tellement fou et terrifiant, ait cessé de tourner et qu'il n'ait lui-même plus un souffle de vie. Pour un instant, ou une éternité, il voulait être tout sauf raisonnable. Parce que c'était Mike. Parce que c'était lui. Qu'importe la raison au fond, tant qu'il pouvait se sentir vivant, sans songer à autre chose qu'au plaisir échangé. En ce sens, il s'approcha de son ami, mais avant que leurs lèvres ne se touchent, à l'ultime seconde, comme s'il venait d'avoir une révélation qui n'aurait pu tomber au pire moment, Mike s'écarta, le laissant tout bête avec une douleur au creux du ventre. - Laisse-moi d'abord t'aider, souffla Mike. Joignant le geste à la parole, de quelques mouvements doux il entreprit de défaire la cravate du Président. Celui-ci resta immobile, se contentant de hocher la tête. Il avait désespérément besoin qu'on prenne soin de lui. De par son métier, son statut de veuf, il était toujours le seul qui s'occupait de tout et tout le monde, sans rien demander en retour. A qui l'aurait-il pu de toute façon? Cette fois encore il n'avait rien demandé, Mike se contentait de savoir exactement ce qu'il voulait. Les mains s'attaquèrent ensuite à la chemise qui était bonne à jeter, ouvrant lentement chaque bouton, découvrant une peau marquée par les dernières heures. S'il savait faire mal avec les poings ou en tenant une arme, cette fois Mike n'était que tendresse, caressant, effleurant, prenant tout son temps, comme si cet instant, leur instant, était le seul rempart à la folie du dehors, qui ne tarderait pas à reprendre ses droits. Quand il fut torse-nu, frissonnant dans la fraîcheur de la cabine, à moins que ce ne soit simplement le contrecoup ou une réaction à la tension qui montait entre eux, Mike le prit dans ses bras. Mais au lieu de goûter la sienne comme il l'attendait tellement, sa bouche fut dans son cou, contre sa mâchoire, sur son épaule, savourant sa peau, provoquant plus de frissons encore. Ainsi vulnérable, Benjamin se sentit plus sale que jamais et regretta la douche qu'il aurait pourtant eu le temps de prendre. Mike ne fit cependant aucune remarque à ce sujet, se contentant de l'embrasser partout, comme pour apaiser, soigner, ce corps durement malmené. La douceur après la violence, les caresses après la douleur. Mike effaçait de ses lèvres les insultes prononcées, de ses mains les coups portés, redessinant avec passion le corps qui avait souffert pour espérer soulager l'esprit. Et Benjamin, qui aujourd'hui avait bien failli mourir plus de fois qu'il ne pouvait le compter, ne s'était jamais senti aussi vivant que maintenant. L'étreinte était rassurante et il s'y perdit volontiers, appréciant pour une fois de n'avoir rien à décider, rien à faire. Pour quelques minutes, il n'était plus le Président, plus une cible à abattre pour bien des fanatiques, il n'était plus rien d'autre qu'un homme qu'on désirait, qu'on chérissait. Mike n'aurait pu lui offrir plus beau cadeau que celui-là. Il avait joué cette scène bien souvent dans sa tête, se désespérant parfois qu'elle ne soit qu'un fantasme, ce soir pourtant il était heureux d'avoir patienté jusque-là. Le moment n'aurait pu être plus parfait. C'était eux deux contre le reste du monde, comme cela aurait toujours dû être. Mike termina de le débarrasser de ses vêtements, sans un mot, sans obtenir une quelconque résistance, puis l'allongea, toujours avec cette même douceur qui ne le quittait plus. Et enfin sa bouche retrouva la sienne, et ça n'aurait pu être plus naturel. Benjamin était nu, exposé comme jamais, mais aucune gêne entre eux, rien d'autre que la plus belle entente. Langue contre langue, corps contre corps, dans une harmonie parfaite. Benjamin ne demanda rien, n'exigea rien, se contentant de répondre à chaque baiser, chaque caresse, impatient quant à la suite, curieux de découvrir jusqu'où irait Mike. Et Mike alla jusqu'au bout. Lui faisant l'amour lentement, amoureusement, mettant dans chacun de ses gestes comme de la vénération. On l'avait tellement détesté aujourd'hui, tellement insulté, que Benjamin s'était demandé parfois au milieu de toute cette haine s'il ne méritait pas effectivement de mourir. Effacé tous ces doutes désormais. Avec Mike sur lui, en lui, lui murmurant des mots d'une beauté qu'il n'aurait pas cru mériter, gémissant son plaisir en même temps que le sien, il n'avait plus de doute. C'était là qu'était sa place, dans ces bras accueillants, sous ces mains apaisantes. Tous les autres pouvaient bien le détester, tant que Mike était là, alors lui avait sa place. Il frôla les étoiles, enfin apaisé, trouvant dans la jouissance la plénitude qui lui avait tant manqué, ne faisant rien pour retenir le cri qui montait en lui, parce qu'il savait que c'était ce que Mike voulait. Son extase trouva écho dans les gémissements de son amant et ce fut tout naturellement qu'ils restèrent ensuite blottis l'un contre l'autre, le plaisir refluant lentement. Cette journée décidément avait été riche en surprises. La dernière était bonne au moins, songea le Président en emmêlant ses jambes à celles de Mike. S'appuyer sur lui, encore et toujours ne compter que sur lui... Dépendre ainsi de quelqu'un était terrifiant. Totalement excitant également. Cette étreinte ne changerait rien quant à la suite, Benjamin n'avait pas la naïveté de croire le contraire, pas dans cette vie. Ce n'était pas plus mal. Mais pour quelques instants, il avait aimé ne plus être celui qui avait toutes les cartes en main. Parce que Mike n'abusait pas de ce rôle occasionnel, aussi bien en lui sauvant la vie qu'en lui faisant l'amour, il lui restait dévoué, le respectait... Ben lui était reconnaissant pour cela et tellement plus. Et ce soir, entre deux baisers, il avait oublié les tourments de la journée, les prochains à venir, Mike lui avait offert ceci, quelques minutes d'apaisement. Le plus beau des cadeaux. Qu'il demeure probablement unique ne le rendait que plus précieux. THE END.

Series: Hope, Family, Promise and Love - Part 1 in the Series Rating: PG-13 Warnings: Canonical death wrote in a semi-graphic way. Spoilers: Set during the first 15 minutes of the film. Author's Notes: So, Olympus Has Fallen... yeah, I have huge feels about that movie (even though it's a \"shoot 'em up\" action movie). I remember watching it getting major slashy-feels between Mike Banning and President Ben Asher, so this story and the ones to follow it in the \"Hope, Family, Promise and Love\" series are a direct result of all those slashy feels. I have another character study ficlet that is going to be posted tonight and I am getting started on a multi-chapter story that is the main focus of this series called \"After the Fall\" that will hopefully start with posting soon. If you haven't watched the movie, you are seriously missing out... from the slashy tones to the absolute BAMF Mike Banning character played by Gerard Butler... well, it's definitely worth a watch. :) Maggie Asher had known for a while that her husband and Secret Service Agent Mike Banning were in love. It wasn't something that she abhorred or felt threatened by, truth be told… she was a little in love with Mike herself, at least in the platonic sense. Rather than it being some tawdry love affair or shameful secret, it was the glue that helped them to make a quasi-family together, even if it was a little bit left of normal. She remembered when she first had the inkling of something forming between Ben and Mike… when they looked a little too long, when they touched a little too firmly, when that spark shot into their eyes whenever they had a moment to just be Ben and Mike instead of the President and the Agent in Charge of his security detail. After that she kept an eye out, looked closer at how they interacted with each other and over time it began to blossom and grow. You might wonder why she was so comfortable with the idea that her husband and his unofficial best friend were in love… well, the truth is that Ben and Maggie had always had an open relationship or rather the idea of one. Political aspirations put that concept on the backburner, but they'd talked about it; about their attractions to other people and the possibility of more down the road. When things went to that next level when feelings were involved it just felt natural to talk to Ben about his feelings for Mike, about what that meant for all of them. Nothing happened between them of course and probably nothing ever would. One of the biggest reasons being that Ben was completely oblivious about how Mike felt about him and vice versa… God love 'em, but those men were a bit slow on the uptake when it came to feelings and emotions. But another reason, the biggest hurdle besides the obliviousness that is, was the fact that Ben and Maggie knew the price Ben paid for the presidency and something as polarizing as a married president in love with his male Security Detail agent and in a polyamorous relationship with both of them would cause irrevocable harm to the goals Ben had for his time in office. The thing was… the love between them all was a natural progression to the agent's entry into their lives; after all, Mike fit into their family like no one else ever had… like there was a Mike-shaped hole waiting for him to fill that they'd never realized was empty until he arrived. When Ben won the presidency and was assigned a Detail, Mike headed up the Secret Service Detail that would guard their family. Like some fated destiny, Mike's arrival was like an explosion in their lives that gave them all a little bit of something they'd always needed. For Maggie it was a sarcastic friend who seemed to always have a moment for witty banter, for quiet conversations about life and an investment in seeing that her family stayed happy and safe. For Connor it was a loving father figure who was there for him when Ben's duties kept him away for long hours into the day and the night. For Ben it was a strong man to lean on who provided a solid soundboard, who knew him at his best and his worst, who understood Ben in a way that no one but Maggie ever had before. Seeing Ben and Mike together, talking and laughing, a soft loving look in their eyes made Maggie feel like nothing and no one could hurt her family. It put warmth in her heart and in her life, like they would never be as happy as they were when they were all together, laughing and sharing each others' company. Of course, all good things come to an end and in this case, that end came in the form of a falling tree as snow swirled around their convoy one wintery night. One snap of a limb and the world flipped. Tires squealed, bodies slammed against hard metal and glass. She cried out as she felt her head strike the cold window beside her… warm wet blood seeped from the wound as she stared dazedly out the window witnessing the expanse of the frozen river just below them, half of the limo teetering precariously over the edge of the crumbling bridge rail. Maggie knew she should be moving, trying to get out of the limo before it tipped too far and slid over the edge of the bridge into the river, but her body wouldn't move like she wanted it to. She heard yelling as agents swarmed the car, trying to pry open the doors and get them free, but if Maggie could have talked she would have told them it was too late… she could feel death coming for her. She'd never been an overly spiritual person, but at that moment she just knew her time was up. \"Connor…\" Maggie pleaded as she was finally able to roll her head to the side and gaze at her husband. Her baby, her boy, her fear for him trumped anything else. She wanted to whisper to Ben to take care of their son, to make sure he knew that Maggie loved him, but like her body her voice wouldn't cooperate. Ben's door was shoved open and Mike began to try and pull Ben out as the limo teetered even more. Ben wanted to save Maggie first, her brave strong man who never thought of himself but of others. And Mike, she really did love that man… he'd be good for Ben when she was gone, Mike was determined to do his duty no matter his feelings and get Ben out. \"The seat belt, it's stuck,\" Ben told Mike as he tried to get Maggie free, ripping with as much force as he could, but the jammed clasp wouldn't release. \"Sir, get out of the car… I'll take care of her!\" Mike yelled, but Ben kept trying. Maggie caught Ben's eyes, blood starting to blur her vision, and she tried to put all of her love and hope for their family's future in her eyes as they locked onto his. Ben stared back at her with pain in his eyes as the yells got more frantic and the groan of metal started to drown out their words. The limo groaned and rocked as the weight of the front end gave in to gravity, slipping farther over the edge of the bridge. \"Take Maggie,\" Ben told Mike as the Agent pulled a knife from his pocket. If Maggie had ever seen a man more in despair of doing what he knew he needed to do, she couldn't remember. Mike's eyes looked from Maggie to Ben and then back to Maggie with the same kind of pain as Ben's in his eyes. The kind that ripped you to shreds and left a hollow shell as the inevitable came to fruition, when you knew you were going to lose someone you loved and couldn't do anything about it. Mike, he knew what was coming too and wanted to save her from her fate, but all three of them knew he couldn't… there wasn't enough time. Maggie took one last look at the two men she loved and wondered what her death would do to them. Would her death draw them closer together or would it rip them apart? Would the weight of raising Connor without her cause Ben to pull away? Would the fact that Mike couldn't save her make Ben's love for him shrivel and die? Maggie hoped not. If there was one shred of goodness left in this life she hoped they would be together like they wanted to be, like they had all wanted to be. From one moment to the next Maggie saw Mike whisper a broken \"I'm sorry\" and then Ben's seatbelt was cut and Mike pulled him from the limo just before it tipped over all the way. Maggie wouldn't say that her life flashed before her eyes before she died, but she would say that her family's future did. She saw pain, regret, anger and fear… but she also saw hope, family, promise and love, so much love… and that was what she focused on as death came calling.

Rating: T Spoilers: Olympus Has Fallen (2013) Notes: For Addison R, written as a treat in Yuletide 2015. Originally posted to the AO3. Benjamin Asher knew it said something about him that he had never once looked at his second soulmark - the one that curled in a tight spiral on his side - and thought it named him anything as mundane as the leader of a company or the chief officer of a club. It had been a little disheartening when he'd realized he probably wouldn't meet the owner of the strong, declarative handwriting until he was a middle-aged adult, and that by that time practically every person he met was going to utter those words. On the other hand, it was encouraging to know that destiny had given him such a lofty goal to reach. Some people's soulmarks said things a lot less flattering, and they ended up spending a lot of effort trying to make them not come true. Ben was glad he didn't have that problem. He respected those that chose otherwise, but he couldn't imagine viewing his own as anything other than inspiration and guide. He hoped that destiny had been just as kind to the person who would one day greet him as 'Mister President'. His first soulmark, on the other hand, was much less mysterious: a simple 'Hi, Ben, I'm Maggie' that had appeared in a band around his left wrist when he was only thirty-eight days old. But just because it was easier didn't make it any less foundational to his world. Simple logic said that he would meet her first ... but also that whatever they were to each other would be vital to reaching the goal that had written itself on his skin a year and a half after her name. Ben had been taught that soulmarks only meant those so connected were deeply and uniquely compatible in some way; most people chose to explore that within the bounds of romance, but not all, especially in cases of multiple soulmarks or those that appeared late, tied not to a partner's birth but the date of a significant life change. His mother had had one of those. Knowing that, he kept Maggie's name covered with a watch band to keep well-meaning friends from introducing him to every Margaret they knew; he wanted their first meeting to be as unpressured as it could be. It never occurred to him that the bearer of 'Hi Maggie, I'm Ben' might feel any differently; might not be content to wait for him to appear in her life before pursuing her own goals. Waiting to decide on a school or an occupation might have been more practical in past centuries when people were born and lived and worked in the same small town all their lives, but it wasn't very convenient in the modern era, especially if you ever wanted to get anything done. Finding a Benjamin Asher in her student directory at Dickinson College had felt like a validation of the best kind. A sign that not only might Margaret Whitmore be one of the lucky ones whose first match was easy to recognize, but also that he would lead her to her second: the one whose 'Doctor Asher', curled boldly around the back of one ear, had sent her parents to a lot of sessions in her childhood about raising kids with more than one soulmark and how it might influence their lives. She got her hands on a copy of Ben Asher's schedule the first chance she got and tracked him down. The amazed, bashful grin she received when she introduced herself was, for her, only a confirmation of what she'd known all along: how very much she had been blessed. Maggie wasn't in any way ashamed of her second soulmark, but given what it said, she'd decided it might be better to let the subject come up naturally, rather than showing it off from day one. Ben was earnest and idealistic and the dimple in his chin had just begged to be kissed right from the start; but she hadn't wanted to bring it up and then have him think she was telling him it was okay to shortcut the wooing process. She deserved all the romance she was due. He discovered it on his own several weeks after their first date, when he reached to tuck her hair behind her ear ... and sucked in a sharp breath at the words under his fingertips. He looked stunned, and not in the way she'd expected; she stiffened under his touch, searching his face with a frown. \"Ben?\" she prompted him. \"Is something wrong?\" He jerked his gaze back to her face at that, mouth softening in a wondering smile. \"Kind of the opposite, actually. Look.\" He dropped his hand and pulled back, untucking his shirt with both hands and yanking it up his torso to expose a patch of skin over his ribs. Maggie reached out instinctively to the tight spiral of writing, so different from the carefully formed scrawl of Ben's words up the line of her pulse, or the curls and swooshes of her soul around Ben's arm. She may have never seen it before, but she was intimately familiar with the dramatic lettering. She brushed her fingertips over the dark letters, then gazed up in astonishment to meet Ben's gaze. \"So that's why...\" The corners of his eyes crinkled, and he caught her hand, kissing her fingertips as he let go the hem of his shirt. \"That's why. The only thing that's ever concerned me was how to balance you both.\" \"But they aren't just yours,\" Maggie marveled. What were the odds? \"They're mine, too.\" Mike Banning had known he'd be a third wheel from the very beginning. When you're born with \"So you're our newest babysitter\" written jaggedly across your abdomen and \"I apologize, he really needs to get some new lines\" slashing across your palm, it's pretty obvious that a) there's likely to be a significant age gap between you and your soulmates, and b) they'll already be together when you meet. Even the rarity of knowing he was part of a trio of reciprocal soulmarks - about as common as identical triplets, according to the studies - wasn't enough to make his so-called destiny feel any less like a booby prize. He made a practice of avoiding the families with little children in his parents' neighborhood, and when he graduated from high school, he chose the furthest possible career from child-care worker that an eighteen-year-old could dream up. He wasn't alone in choosing that path, either; the motto of the 75th Ranger Regiment felt especially apropos. Sua sponte : 'of their own accord.' It wasn't until he finished out his twenty, joined the Secret Service as the most appealing of the options open to him afterward, and worked his way up to a post on the President's Protective Detail that he realized exactly what he'd set himself up for; why the words had never faded. It was a good thing Congress had finally passed legislation making soulmarked matches a protected class, though it was going to be a challenge, proving he could still do the job. He chuckled in amazement as the First Lady back-handedly chastised her husband for his response to Mike's greeting, then clasped her hand and said, \"No need, ma'am, I think that one will do.\" It wasn't easy, at first, them keeping a respectful distance while Mike learned his duties. It was less easy, later, striving to maintain that distance while they were in public. To take off the boxing gloves when it was time to put on the suit; to keep his eyes on the crowd and not the pair on the stage; to tease her about earring choices and then get into a separate car where he had to be Agent Banning to the boy he'd rather treat like a son. But it was worth it. If the limousine had fallen from that icy bridge ten seconds sooner, before he could cut the second belt and pull them both to safety- If he hadn't been escorting Maggie to a nearby presentation when a C-130 roared down over the National Mall- If he'd been any slower handing her off and sprinting through the surface streets before the ground attack took the White House and the building was locked down- In the aftermath, Maggie curled up between him and Ben, one hand over Ben's wound and the warmth of Mike's bruised body at her back, and trembled in the joined clasp of their arms. Mike ran a comforting hand down her side and pressed a kiss against the words behind her ear. \"I truly am sorry about the house,\" he said, hoping to cheer her up, as he'd done for Ben. \"It's going to be a real bitch to clean.\" She snorted, then turned over, Ben shifting behind her to hook an arm over her waist as she moved. \"Are you volunteering?\" she asked, smiling through her tears. \"Because I can think of a few more important things for you to do.\" -x- ","Summary":" Title: now ask me a serious question Author: Jedi Buttercup Disclaimer: The words are mine; the wor"},{"Movie":"Olympus Has Fallen","Title":"Guarantees","Author":"stranger12","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12378135","Passage":"[Chapter 1] London Has Fallen – Guarantees What if Mike failed? Connor wouldn't stop clutching to him and sobbing. Mike held him close as his fellow Secret Service agents milled around them, all too alert after the recent events in London. \"Mike\" – one of his colleagues said softly, but Connor just held on tighter. \"I'm sorry, I–\" – he shook his head, unable to leave Connor alone for even a moment. The other agent nodded understandingly. Mike knew he would eventually have to let the kid go, they would both have to go their different ways, but for the time being, they needed each other. They stayed there for something close to an eternity, until Mike couldn't physically do it anymore, and Connor seemed to finally have ran out of tears, though when he separated from Mike, his face was swollen, red, and the grief, pain, regret and anger in his eyes were far too clear. Mike wished he could hug it all away, but he knew that it was all a part of Connor now, just like it was a part of him. It just seemed so unfair that a child would have to carry the burden of death, and be presented with it at every turn when someone wanted to be cruel – and Mike knew well enough how cruel the world could be, and what shitty people populated it. \"You call me anytime, okay? Anytime. Day and night, I don't care, just call me\" – Mike made Connor promise before he was spirited away to live with his grandparents. The boy– The young man, because despite his young age, he had nearly seen his mother die in a snowy road, and then had to see his father– Connor had survived losing both his parents, and Mike didn't know how he could be so strong as to keep his head up high in the face of an uncertain future. \"Take care, Mike\" – Connor said, and it was a stab to the gut how like his father he sounded, quietly reassuring and commanding. One day, if Connor so wished, he would be a leader of men, just like his father had been. Had been. Was. Dead. Mike quit the Secret Service. Newly minted President Allan Trumbull tried to change his mind, stating that without him, Ben and Lynne would have died long before they did, Lynne was outside of his control, and he had done everything he possibly could to save Ben – but Mike was only human, and he should not blame himself for not single handedly rescuing Ben. Leah told him the same, especially during the nights where he stayed up late not because of their daughter, but because of the shadows lurking in his nightmares. She tried to kiss him and tell him it wasn't his fault, Ben wouldn't blame him, Connor didn't blame him. What he didn't tell Trumbull or Leah though was that he blamed himself, and that was too much to face most days, not to mention nights, when he felt like he was back in London, lurking in corners, fighting for his life, for Ben, for Connor, for America. It was his fault, he had failed, Ben was dead, Connor was an orphan, Lynne was dead, and he couldn't possibly face being a Secret Service agent again, pretending he could protect people when everyone could look up the video of Ben's last moments to know how bad Mike was at his primary function. Afterwards, Mike decided he was done with getting paid to have people's backs. Leah looked conflicted about it, because if anyone in the world knew how committed he was to being a protector, it was her, but she knew he needed a change, she understood that whatever had happened in London with Ben (which he had still not been able to tell her the details of) had scarred in a way that nothing else had, not choosing to save Ben over his wife, not the attack on White House. As much as Leah had never shot anyone, stuck a knife into someone and tortured them for information, she had lost countless victims, and she got that. But she could never understand the rage, the shock, the utter loss when Mike could do nothing but watch as Ben closed his eyes just before he lost his head. The fury with which Mike slaughtered Ben's killers was something he had never felt in his life, and as he stood over their broken bodies afterwards, he couldn't believe he had been such a monster. The people who'd killed the leaders of the world, who'd killed Ben in front of the world, were monsters, but Mike couldn't quite allot himself into too different a box than them. Little Lynne was the only thing that kept Mike sane most days. Connor called him everyday, he wrote him letters and e–mails, but he was off in Illinois with what was left of his family, trying to adjust to a world without either of his parents, where terrorists weren't men in masks plotting to spread fear, where they were his father's ruthless killers instead. Connor was coping, and Mike was sure eventually he would forget all about him, but Lynne? Lynne was his baby, Leah and Lynne were now his sole charges, so to speak. \"Mike? Babe, come to bed\" – Leah sleepily called out from the door. He glanced at her and nodded vaguely. \"Sorry, go to sleep, I'll be a minute\" – she looked at him but said nothing. He wondered if he would be able to hang on to Leah, to Lynne, to his sanity. He had not been able to save Ben, and some nights when he closed his eyes, he saw it happen again and again, though the worst were when Ben turned around and yelled at Mike, blaming him for the entire situation. No wonder Leah didn't want to fight him anymore on his depression, he was sure he'd scared her plenty of times when he woke up screaming each and every time Ben screamed at him in his nightmares. \"I'm sorry\" – he said into the night. The night didn't respond. ","Summary":" London Has Fallen – Guarantees What if Mike failed?

Fandom: Olympus Has Fallen Pairings/Characters: Benjamin Asher, (pre-slash) Mike Banning/Benjamin Asher, (past) Maggie Asher/Benjamin Asher Summary: Sometimes... sometimes... oftentimes, Ben dreamed of the life he might have had, had Maggie not died. He dreamed about finishing out his presidential term, of completely leaving the political office, of endless days spent with Maggie and Connor... and Mike. Series: Hope, Family, Promise and Love - Part 2 in the Series Rating: PG Spoilers: Set post-Olympus Has Fallen. Author's Note: I have had big plans in the works for a while for a long multi-chapter story that revolves around the evolution of Ben and Mike's relationship... it's equal parts romance, fluff, drama, intrigue and smuttiness, but I haven't quite got there yet. I know, I'm a tease... But I swear, it's going to happen. However, to get myself into the grove of writing in this new fandom, I wrote another short character study ficlet that centers around Benjamin Asher. I'm hoping that this is just the precursor to the longer, plotty story that this series centers around, but until the longer story \"After the Fall\" is written and posted, here is a short little interlude to wet your whistle. Sometimes... sometimes... oftentimes, Ben dreamed of the life he might have had, had Maggie not died. He dreamed about finishing out his presidential term, of completely leaving the political office, of endless days spent with Maggie and Connor... and Mike. He dreams of the promise of what might have come had they been given the chance to let the love between them all unfold and become the family he knew they had been meant to be. But that promise was ripped away, sheared off by an icy winter storm that not only ripped Maggie from their lives, but ripped away the possibility of finally letting his heart guide his actions in the love he felt for that man, for his best friend, confidant, protector, councilor, the other love of his life. It was funny how how he could have two great loves of his life and lose them both on the very same night. One to death, and the other... to the pain, anger, frustration, despair and turmoil that came from Maggie's death. After that night, Ben struggled to even get out of bed and meet his obligations as the leader of the free world. He struggled to not crumble in the face of his overwhelming grief because of the things he had lost that night. It was Connor who kept him going, even in the moments where losing Maggie felt like his heart had been ripped to shreds, was continuing to be ripped to shreds with each new day. That grief and despair, that anger and frustration, Ben took it out on Mike because he was the only one left, because he didn't go for Maggie first... because Ben was so thankful that Mike wasn't dead as well. It was that thought that really started it all; that moment shortly after the limo careened down into the icy river below with Maggie inside... for a moment Ben was grateful that at least Mike was standing beside him, holding Ben in his arms, while Maggie had no doubt been dying right that very second as his mind voiced that treacherous thought. How do you live with that kind of guilt? That anger? Watching the woman that you loved died before your eyes and seeing the face of the man you loved standing beside you and being thankful for that. Ben couldn't look at Mike after that without feeling the grief, that anger and guilt, and not letting it overflow. Mike was sent away, reassigned they said, and Ben was relieved. For eighteen months Ben lived with that wealth of emotion caught in his throat, stuck in a cycle of relief, anger, grief, guilt and longing. Then came the day that Mike came back into his life... the day that the White House was taken hostage and Mike did everything he could to get Ben and Connor out alive. It was like all that anger, pain and guilt bled away and what was left, well, that was love. Ben remembered why he loved that man, remembered why he could rely on him, why he could rest assured that there was no one else in this world who could protect their family like Mike Banning could. ... and that was what they were, family. One born of love, of a promise that even though it was tarnished and not quite what it once was, it was still there... still waiting for the two of them to realize it's potential. To accept that in this world where nothing was ever guaranteed that when you find love, you should always hold on to it as tightly as you can. ","Summary":" Title: Sometimes...

I'm the head of his God-damned detail!\" Mike demanded of the woman who barred his way. \"Yes, but he's the President and HE said 'no'!\" argued the short, stout, almost-ancient head nurse who wasn't at all impressed that Secret Service Agent Mike Banning was well-armed. Just then the door opened and an exasperated looking doctor stepped out \"It's OK, Enid.\" He said as he placed a hand on her shoulder. Immediately the nurse dropped out of her belligerent stance and into 'at ease'. Then nodded to the doctor and walked back to her station. \"Agent Banning?\" \"Yeah, that's me.\" \"He'll see you now.\" \"About damn time!\" he muttered as he stalked through the door. As soon as he saw the man in the bed he started: \"Ben, what the Hell is going on here? No one in this damn place is cooperating…\" as he scanned the room he spotted the person sitting next to the hospital bed. \"Director Jacobs!

Have a seat.\" reassured Ben Asher as he waved to a chair. \"Mr. President, Madam Director, I take full respon-\" \"Agent Banning, sit down.\" insisted The President of The United States. Mike sat down. \"Thank you. Now, I held you off until the Director got here; I've held her off until the doctor was finished.\" At that Ben looked just as exasperated as the doctor had. \"Now that you're both here I'll tell you my side, I will tell it once and it won't leave this room.\" Both Agent Banning and the Director of the Secret Service nodded. \"First of all; Mike's team, your agents Lynn, did everything right. I'm the one who didn't cooperate; the shooter was aiming at Mike, not me. I threw off Agent Smith and knocked Mike out of the way. How was I supposed to know all those TV shows and movies would be right and I'd get shot? Again.\" \"With all due respect Mr. President, we know all that. What I don't understand is, why?\" said Jacobs. \"When all Hell broke loose at the White House, Mike didn't stand around wringing his hands wondering what to do. He went in and he made Conner his first priority.\" Asher couldn't go on for a moment for the remembered terror of those hours until he knew his son was safe. \"Do you have children, Director?\" \"Yes I do, Mr. President.\" \"Then you understand?\" he asked, holding her eyes with his until she nodded. \"Yes, I do, Mr. President.\" \"Do I have to make it official, Lynn?\" \"No Ben, you don't. I'll have a word with Agent Smith and the hospital staff. Thank goodness there were no reporters or witnesses. Things will go back to normal, I'll see to it.\" \"Thank you, Director Jacobs.\" \"You're welcome, Mr. President.\" She stood and left, taking Asher's thanks as the dismissal it also was. Ben waited until the door had closed before looking at Mike, what he saw was a shifting mixture of anger, confusion, indignation and awe. \"Before you start with 'I was just doing my job', let me remind you that at the time we weren't you job. And that was my fault.\" Both men paused to remember that horrible night on an icy bridge. \"Before I was President, while I am President and after I retire from this office, I am first and always Conner Asher's father. And I will happily take a bullet for the man who saved my sons life.\" \"Ben, I-I don't know what to say.\" \"Shake my hand, brother.

He slept fruitlessly and woke up several times during the night. He didn't even want to sleep. He looked over at Margaret who was softly sobbing in her sleep. Gently he ran a hand through her hair. He knew he had to wake her up. Neither of them wanted to do this. Ben felt like this was all his fault. He and Margaret had quarreled over something that looking back today seems so insignificant. He had been proud and refused to let it go. DAMNIT I SHOULD HAVE LET IT GO , he thought to himself, then this wouldn't be happening n ow. Today was not an average day. President Asher would attend no meetings. He would give no speeches. He was going to no parties. He was not administering any harsh chastisements which he normally refused to do anyway. If only he hadn't been arguing with Margaret the driver wouldn't have been distracted. If only he had been quicker. He could have grabbed Conner out. Tears poured down his eyes like the rain that was fast falling on the window. Numbly he took a shower as Margaret showered in the other room. Numbly he got dressed and went downstairs. His daughter, Caroline was home from college to attend the funeral and offer them support. It was going to be so hard for her too. She was very close to Conner and the idea of losing him was horrifying to her. Tragically it happened when Conner was so young. ... It was raining at the funeral as well. President Asher listened to the preacher talk about how GOD has the perfect plan. GOD never gives you more then you can handle. Oh yeah? He would rather be whipped half a thousand times and have alcohol and salt poured in his wounds then this. He would pour the salt in himself if it would bring Conner back. The preacher said that Conner was a beloved son- got that right. He was a beloved brother. He was a loyal friend. He was a good soul. Duh. But Conner was so much more. He remembered how Margaret went into labor with Conner not even knowing she was carrying him. He was in the middle of doing something and she went into labor. Conner was born at 12:24 in the morning after 12 hours of labor. He would never forget how Conner had a way of pulling at his heart strings. Caroline did the same thing. No matter how naughty they had been Margaret and him could never bring themselves to chastise them or even scold them. Still they were wonderful and well behaved children 90 percent of the time. It was a good sermon but the preacher didn't capture the heart of Conner. That heart was no longer beating but it was affecting everyone who loved him. There was no mention of how Conner used to come into the oval office even in the middle of a meeting when he got home from school just to give his old man a hug. Asher sobbed throughout the funeral. This was his baby. After the funeral everyone who was a friend of his came up to him. They asked him how he was doing? \"MY SON IS DEAD,\" he screamed, \"HOW THE HELL DO YOU THINK I'M DOING?\" \"I know what you're going through,\" his friend Mike said. \"Was he saved?\" That question came from his college friend. \"Yes,\" Ben said, \"He was saved. That's why he's in a ******* casket?\" He was starting to get a headache. His son was dead. He just wanted to curl up and let that reality take affect then sleep until he died so he wouldn't be hurting anymore. Nothing would bring his boy back. Days passed. It seemed like time stood still. Slowly he started to heal. He chose to honor Conner Benjamin Asher instead of mourn him. \"Conner may be dead,\" Benjamin said ending a speech, \"But he isn't gone. He's in our hearts.

The Anatolian Shepherd knew what he had to do...he had to listen to his heart. \"Those two are lovely together...don't you agree?\" She said pointing to the two with her wing. \"I admit...they do look cute together\" She smiled while looking at them, Catherine then looked straight forward as they flew to Hawaii Heres what I don't understand, I just watched the movie yesterday and I haven't found a single clue that Catherine is Diggs's potential love interest. More chapters coming up. Remember to review and tell me what you think. Also I'm making no money off of this movie.[Chapter 2] This is my second chapter of the movie Cats & Dogs:The Revenge of Mr. Tinkles Rated: T Pairing: Diggs/Butch (Slash) Night came fast followed by a terrible storm coming, clouds started to turn to gray and lightning started to rumble. Catherine looked up at the sky and warned Butch. \"Butch...watch out!\" She yelled. \"It was too late, him and Diggs were already in the clouds \"Diggs?...Butch? said Catherine but no answer for either one of them, they were too far away form the bird and the cat. In the clouds, Butch was fighting the strong wind, the noise of the lightning woke Diggs up in shock. \"Butch...what's going on\" He said looking around. \"Hold on!\" He said screaming. The rookie didn't bother to ask so he tightly held onto his waist. Butch then served to the left and right trying to avoid the storm but it was too strong and it soon clouded his eyes. \"I can't see a thing in this cloud\" He sad trying to regain his sight but the storm got worse by making thunder and rain come down. \"Butch...I think we're lost\" He said sounding scared. \"What makes you say that?\" He said. \"I hear water\" He said using his they were flying through the clouds, one of the clouds struck lighting in between them making them split apart. \"Butch!\" He said drifting away from him. \"Diggs...grab my paw\" He said flying towards him and tried to grab his paw but the wind was too powerful which made it harder to join paws and the deadly storm went on like this all night until it cleared up and by morning Butch was laying on a board panting until he noticed Diggs with his eyes closed. \"Diggs!\" He said scared. He began to swim towards him but he slowly drifted into the water almost drowning. Diggs!\" He yelled as he dove under water. The German Shepherd was almost about to drop to the floor but caught by his collar with the help of Butch's teeth, Bursting out of the water, he pulled him up to the surface and made his way to source then once up to source, he struggled to get Diggs to the sand and got beside him then placed a paw on the rookies cheek. For the very first time Butch felt a tear coming down his face, not that he was dead but he cared too much about him to let him get hurt, he closed his eyes but he didn't know it until he felt a loving lick on the cheek by Diggs and slowly started to come out of his depression and looked at his possible mate. Diggs smiled at Butch, he did as well. \"Diggs...your alright?\" He asked like he was his old girlfriend. \"I wouldn't say alright\" He said before smiling. \"We'll I'm just glad your okay\" He said before nuzzling him, he nuzzled back and the German Shepherd smiled and got up then shook himself off. \"Wait your not...\" He said then froze in the start to the sentence and instead lowered his ears, his head and turned around. \"I'm not what?\" He said standing beside him. \"Never mind\" He said before walking forward. Diggs followed him and gave him a passionate nuzzle and they shared this moment together until Butch broke it, he pulled away. \"We have to stay focus!\" He shouted and continued walking forward. \"Wait...what about the others?\" He said thinking about how hurt they must be. \"We'll do without them\" He said walking into the forest, this made his pupil growl and got in front of his mentor, he finally put his foot down. \"Butch...we need them\" He said in a growling stage. \"What are you talking about?\" He said also in a growling stage. \"Think about it...if we stop Mr. Tinkles...what are we going to do then?...we're stranded on the island so don't tell me that we don't need them\" He said before panting hard. The Anatolian Shepherd didn't expect this from Diggs, he was stunned and surprised at this. He just smiled at Diggs...he was definitely everything he every wanted in a love interest: sexy, daring, good-looking, sweet and loyal. \"What are you smiling at?\" He said keeping his teeth showing. \"Your right\" He said after giggling. \"I am\" He said stopped showing his teeth. \"Yeah...I like that in a guy\" He said but that was support to stay in a thought bubble why did he say it...now he had to see if his pupil feels the same way about him but it took like a second for him. Diggs blushed, walked up to him and licked his cheek then Butch blushed bright red like he just ate some hot peppers. \"Well what do you wanna do while we wait?\" He said getting bored of the hot sun beating down on him. \"We could look for a tree house to live in until Catherine and Seamus come. The German Shepherd smiled, he and Butch walked closely together perfectly announcing they are now a couple. It took nearly 45 minutes and they couldn't find a single cave not even a house but they came across a waterfall and beside it was a hut close up against a wall made of wood and leaves. Diggs then looked at his lover then ran and jumped into the water then laid on his back, this time he was safe cause the water was like 3 feet deep. \"Come in...the waters fine\" He said to Butch while kicking his feet back. Butch was always a serious type of dog but he deserved this little vacation...he needs to relax so he smiled and jumped in with his mate. Diggs was underwater then Butch came up to him and stopped right up to his face then popped out of the water, the mentor licked the rookies nose then looked at each other. Their smiles went away and just wrapped their paws around one another's shoulders then stared deeply into each others eyes then it happened. Finally they kissed and to Diggs it felt like lust and heaven, to Butch it felt like milk and kibble which all dogs love kibble and milk, they soon parted then nuzzled. Diggs remembered something so he putted away. \"Diggie..what's wrong?\" He said with a pet-name he had given him as a start of their loving relationship as one. \"Your collar...it's in the water\" He said looking at it. \"Yeah...it's water-proof\" He said before licking his cheek. \"Wow...why didn't you tell me?\" He said. \"Obviously cause I haven't gotten it wet. Diggs giggled and laughed. \"I love you Butch\" He said burying his head into his fur then getting off. \"Me too Diggs\" He said before they shared another passionate kiss. They took a 50 minute-swim then they got out and shook themselves off. \"That was nice\" He said happily. \"I must admit that was pretty relaxing\" He said smiling. Diggs licked his lovers cheek then both of them walked into the hut and inside it was warm and safe, they laid down next to each other and cuddled, both felt very warm next to one another. \"Diggie\" He said with his eyes half closed. \"Yes\" He said turning his eyes to him. \"I have a confession to make to you\" He said. \"What?\" Diggs said listening with both ears. \"I'm kinda jealous of you\" He confirmed. \"Why?\" He said. \"I wish that...I could just have a little joy in my life like...having a family\" He explained his fantasy future. \"What about Catherine at the others...Aren't their your family?\" He said giving a theory. \"That's my family but not my true family...I mean they don't spend time with me plus their always busy\" He said while laying on his back. \"I know what you mean\" He said resting his head on Butch's neck facing the wall. \"Sometimes I wish I could just have a normal life like you\" He shed a single tear. Diggs was depressed now cause he didn't like his mentor to be sad but had an idea in mind. \"If it's not much trouble after we stop Mr. Tinkles...why not stay with me\" He said smiling once more. Butch's tail started to wag once he heard those worlds then Diggs laid a paw on top of his. \"You.. really mean that? The Anatolian Shepherd said all nervous. \"Yes\" He said before they cuddled more. Remember what Diggs said that he can't swim plus to clear things up with Diggs & Shane's relationship, the police had allowed him to adopt Diggs and promises that he would take care of him and treat him with respect, Still don't know the reason why the police won't allow him to adopt Diggs in the first place. There's more chapters on the way and r emember to review this.[Chapter 3] This is my third chapter of Cats & Dogs: The Revenge of Mr. Tinkles Pairing: Diggs/Butch (Slash) Rated: T The two canines were sound asleep when all the sudden, Butch's ears perked up and got up then peeked out the door, looked left and right then heard the sound again \"Catherine? He said and turned to the water. There they were, their friends were safe so his tail wagged and looked back at his possible mate and went back. Digg was dreaming of the life he will soon have with Butch, the Anatolian Shepherd looked at him peacefully. \"He looks so cure when he's sleeping\" He smiled then paused to see that his attitude has changed and the solution was finding true love meaning since his break up with Ivy, he swore he would never find love again. \"Diggie\" He whispered near his ear but when he didn't respond, he licked his cheek and stood back once he saw movement. The German Shepherd grunted as he opened his eyes. \"Doggie come on, I just heard something outside\" He said. Diggs looked at him, smiled and rolled on his stomach and stretched his body while yawning then was fully awake, he nuzzled his neck afterwards. \"Diggs, please we're on a mission...we can play when where're done\" He said trying not to blush. \" Affirmative\" Diggs said sound like a serious agent. Butch sighed, walking up to his possible mate and gave him another lick on the cheek\" Come on. our friends are waiting\" He said smiling then ran out the hut happily barking. The German Shepherd did the same as well. (0) Catherine shook herself off causing the water to soak Seamus\" Aww man, you couldn't have waited until I moved\" She said. \"I'm sorry but I'm a cat and cats don't like to get wet\" She said proving her paint before beginning to lick her paw until the two heard Butch and Diggs barking. The cat and bird screamed seeing that their still alive. The two canines stopped on front of the other two with tails wagging. \"Your both alright\" Catherine said in cheerfulness \"we thought that storm killed you. \"Yeah, ain't no way I'll survive without you two\" Seamus said putting on a gangsta voice. Diggs giggled then Butch killed the mood by sniffing the ground for Mr. Tinkles causing the three to stop \"You alright Butch? Diggs asked worrying about him. \"Mr. Tinkles is not here\" Butch said to the three until they heard the sound of maniacal laughter making Diggs ran beside his lover but the others just looked up. \"Well...isn't this a little reunion\" Mr. Tinkles said with Calico by his side, both had jet packs on. \"Mr Tinkles! Butch growled \"Just what are you planning? Diggs said stepping forward. \"So...your the rookie my assistant has told me about\" Persian cat said before HA!. Mr. Tinkles I presume\" The German Shepherd. Diggs, it's always nice to see a familiar face\" Calico said making him growl as well. \"I'll make you cough up all kinds of hairballs\" Seamus threatened and started to fly up but Catherine caught her by the tail. \"I feel lightheaded, Calico...we are leaving, I'm late for my nap\" He said smacking his lips before flying off. \"I'll send ya a postcard when we had taken over the world\" Calico said causing Diggs to bark in anger then he flew off. \"We can't let them get away!\" Diggs said started to run to the water but Butch stood in front of him forcing him to stop. \"Wait, there's no way off this island' he looked down \"we have to try a different tactic. He used a special communicator installed on his collor \"Signal D.O.G\" He commanded and it activated then over to the headquarters As Lou was considerably apologizing to Louise about leaving him when he found out he was a guy was the biggest mistake of his life, Butch came up on screen. Come in Lou\" He said but the beagle was too busy \"Sweetie, you shouldn't be here. \"Alright I'll go but promise me you'll come home an afterwards cause the kids really miss you\" He said and both rubbed noses before the poodle walked out, exiting the HQ. Once he was gone, Lou cleared his throat to talk to his former mentor \"Sorry about that Butch, what do you need? He said. \"We're stranded on an island and we need someone here fast, Mr. Tinkles and Calico are getting away\" He said before signing off. Lou turned his chair around and barked loud so every dog could hear , they turned to the Top Dog. \"Listen up, we have an emergency; Butch, Diggs are trapped and we need to rescue him so I need two dogs to go to his location. \"He said in a demanding voice. Sam and Rex gracefully volunteered by going up to the Top Dog. \"Awaiting your command Doom machine\" The Sheepdog said and Lou hopped out of his chair and assorted the two to the jet packs. Butch sighed as he looked at the ocean and Diggs walked silently by his side \"Butch, is everything okay? The German Shepherd said. \"Yeah but it'd not that important right now\" He said not looking at him, dodging a bullet. \"Butch, we're in a relationship so you can tell me\" He said placing his head under his neck. \"Well, I got to be honest with you and don't be offended what I'm about to tell you but I wasn't quite up to becoming your mentor, I was actually looking to retire from the agency. The Anatolian Shepherd had get out a tear run down \"I'm sorry if it sounded like I'm being selfish\" He said. \"I'm kinda shocked by this but what does it matter anyway, you'll be living in a home soon\" He said lifting his head up catching Butch he nuzzle his back. The two shared the rest of the time in that single position. I remember in the first film that Lou told a part of his backstory when he went out with a poodle then broke up with him but since Lou is now an agent, I assumed that he had gotton back together with that same poodle and had puppies together which reminds me of his appearance. He's a poodle obviously named Louise and has a Sweetish-French accent from Poland. Please give me a peanut-butter cookie for throwing comedy with Catherine and it'll be much appreciated.[Chapter 4] This is my fourth chapter of Cats & Dogs: The Revenge of Mr. Tinkles Pairing: Diggs/Butch (Slash) Rated: K+ Diggs and Butch were still nuzzling while the waves rushed up to this feet and Diggs pulled away. \"This is great, having my mentor as my personal boyfriend\" He said happily. Butch needed to get in harmony with his emotions like loveable Diggs here. \"So, Lou said that there was something between you and Ivy\" He said causing the Anatolian Shepherd to just turned and made his way on the sand then sat down on his butt. The German Shepherd looked worried, did he say the wrong thing? He slowly walked towards him with his tail between his legs. The Anatolian Shepherd looked at the jungle when his mate had came up to him. I didn't mean to make you sad, was it that bad? \"Forget it, just drop it? Butch demanded. Diggs came to his side and licked his cheek which his mentor turned to him, showing depression. \"Please, Lou mentioned that you love belly rubs\" He smiled. \"Butch sighed and scoffed \"That was a long time ago when I was still in my youth and now\" he looked at his mate \"I'm just old\" He claimed. Diggs whimpered and knocked him down then put both paws on each side \"Diggs, what is the meaning of this? He asked in anger until the German Shepherd nuzzled his neck for only a minute and raised his head up \"For what it's worth, you look young to me\" He licked his cheek, got off of him and sat on his side Within an instant, Diggs belly rubbed Butch's tubby with his left paw which the Anatolian Shepherd closed his eyes \"I haven't felt like this in a long time\" He said calmly as he had felt the softness & tenderness. Seamus flew over to see how the two lovers were doing and if the rescue team had arrived but what she saw was beyond those points. \"Seamus, has the rescue team arrived? Diggs asked while constantly rubbing on his mate's stomach. \"Nope and I was hopping you knew\" She said and was about to fly back to the cat \"before I leave, GET A DOG HOUSE\" She was gone in a flash. Butch opened his eyes \"She's right...now is not the best time to be fooling around\" he rolled and got up from the sand then sat in front of the water, overlooking the waves while feeling the wind brush through his double coat. He sighed when he heard his life-partner came and sat by his side. Diggs scooted a little closer in order to feel his fur against him. Butch knew that they were in a relationship now so he rested his tail with his. \"What a Labador I'm turning out to be\" He said as a sentence with no answer. Diggs looked at him as his spoke \"I haven't been in a relationship in so long\" He restrained himself and took a deep breath. \"How did you enjoy the belly rub, did you like it? The German Shepherd asked. Butch gulped when he said that cause it was Ivy's special thing, he turned to him and looked at the sweet innocent face, those eyes and perfect smile. \"I wanna say that it was sure better then Ivy? He said, throwing shade at her on account on him finding a new mate. Diggs smiled and sighed in relief as he rested his head against Butch. He thought again about living with him, seeing him in his prime though, he could spend all of him time to let loose and play with Diggs, not having to worry about dangers. There's bad news however, even if Kitty and Mr. Tinkles are gone, Diggs is still young so he'll have to step in Butch's shoes and take on missions and the worst part of it is that while Butch is without his companion, every second that is spend, he'll worry about him. He cares way to much for the German Shepherd to think of such things like what if it get hurt?. He doesn't want to see his lovable sweetheart wounded. He was scared more then he was with Lou. Seamus and Catherine ran up to the two who was just sharing this peaceful moment together \"Butch, the rescue team is here\" Catherine said and he turned to her. \"Great, we'll head back to headquarters and rethink a new plan to stop Mr. Tinkles and Calico\" He said before he and the others went to the team but the determined Anatolian Shepherd looked at the depressed dog so he went back. \"I promise, once we get rid of the pair\" he said after seeing Diggs looked up with his puppy-dog eyes \"we can settle down and finally relax\" He claimed, making him smile and licked his cheek then ran to the others. Diggs wagged his tail, got up and ran to catch on up to the group. Seems like Butch is more then ready to settle down with Diggs and despise his age, the German Shepherd thinks that his mate is perfect. Patient935 mentioned that Mr. Tinkles has a love/hate relationship with Calico and he's right though Calico maybe secretly in love with him and Mr. Tinkles is blocking that love by treating him like dirt. Gimme a cookie for Seamus's reaction. Next chapter is planned with my continuing on the relationship between the pupil and mentor cause it was so sweet when Diggs rubbed his belly and Butch shading his former girlfriend, Ivy. ","Summary":" This is my very first Movie of Cats & Dogs: The Revenge of Mr. Tinkles Rated: K Pairing: Diggs/Butc"},{"Movie":"Cats & Dogs","Title":"Cats, Dogs, and Dangers","Author":"Reverend I'm a Jesus Freak","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8901647","Passage":"[Chapter 1] Hello, people of Earth. Wait, I've used that openeing before. Um. Hello people with internet access! I am here to start another fanifc. I'm expanding the range that my fanfics take, ergo, this Cats and Dogs fanfic. ENJOY! Diggs and Butch were chasing after a criminal that had just stolen some highitech parts from a military lab in California. They couldn't see exactly what kind of animal it was, but that thought it was some kind of canine by its size. \"when did dogs become the bad guys?\" \"Whenever they decided. Enough chat.\" They seen him jump onto another buillding. \"Why couldn't you have brought your jetpack?\" \"It didn't seem nessacary! Time to jump!\" They both barely made it. \"I'm getting too old for this.\" \"Hey, do you hear screaming?\" \"Whoever it is, we don't have time for it!\" \"But, it sounds like it's getting closer.\" No sooner than he said that than they had something land on them and stop their pursuit. They got up and they had lost sight of whoever they were chasing. \"Great. He got away.\" Diggs turned toward whoever it was that had landed on them. He was a black lab. \"Who are you?\" The lab got up and replied. \"My name is DB. That fall...hurt. Who were you chasing?\" \"We couldn't tell. We think it was a canine by the size.\" DB sniffed the air and his expression turned to a mix of anger and worry. \"What did he take? I need specifics.\" \"Do you know who it was?\" \"Yes. His name is Diablo. He is my arch nemesis. Well, one of them. But, he is the most dangerous. Now, what did he take?\" \"It was some piece of machinery from a high-tech labratory here in California.\" \"Do you know the specifics?\" \"we weren't told the specifics of what he took.\" DB sighed. \"How can we find out?\" \"Lou is looking for the specifics. We need to head to HQ to see if he's found anything out. You say you have multiple enemies?\" \"Yes. Four of them are the four most dangerous and those four are a team.\" \"That makes it easy.\" Butch shot Diggs a glare, but DB just chuckled. \"Anyways, Diablo is their leader and the only one that is my equal. Mastermind is the brains of the group, but he also is their least trained fighter. Avenger is their distraction and youngest. Traitor is the one for breaking and entering. They all have one thing in common.\" \"What's that?\" \"They all used to be a part of my life. Traitor was one of my mentor's, but wanted to be the best, so he caused a lot of death, but that just made me better than him. Avenger used to be a friend of mine and he trained along side me. Mastermind used to work for me. I'll tell you about Diablo later. Now, let's head to you HQ.\" D.O.G. H.Q. Lou was in his office looking over the file to see what Diablo had taken. His door opened and he seen Diggs and Butch come in with a black lab. \"Welcome back, you two. Who do you have with you?\" \"Name's DB. I accidentally stopped their chase of that criminal that stole something from the high-tech facility. His name is Diablo and the most dangerous of my enemies. He is the leader of the most dangerous of my enemies.\" \"Thank you for that information. I take it they brought you here because you can be a great help to us, correct?\" \"Right on the nose. Question, though. Why are you wearing such an ugly sweater?\" \"This was a gift fr-\" DB cut him off. \"please give it back. It will save our eyes and your humility.\" Diggs stifled a laugh. Lou just glared at the smiling lab. \"Well, i've found what he stole.\" They turned to the screen and there was a microchip. \"I'm not sure what it does, though.\" DB stared at it. \"Hm. I've seen that before. But, where?\" He was looked up, trying to remember. \"Maybe after getting something to eat, I can remember better. Know where I can get some fried chicken?\" \"Why would getting something to eat help your memory?\" \"Well, Butch, it will help stimulate the electrons in my brain, making the elctrical impulses flow better, which would help memory.\" \"Why fried chicken, though?\" \"It's my favorite food. That's why.\" \"Alright. Get him some fried chicken. We need any intel he can get us.\" \"i know where a great KFC is.\" DB imediately tackled him. \"WHEREWHEREWHEREWHEREWHERE!?\" \"Get off and I'll show you.\" DB did more than get off him. He dragged him to the vehicle and got it going to Diggs's dog house. \"He must really love fried chicken.\" KFC DB had begged some fried chicken from the KFC workers and was happily eating it. \"You know you could have taken it much slower to get here. It wasn't going anywhere soon.\" Diggs was still dizy from DB's actions. DB swallowed his chicken before replying. \"I know, but I really love fried chicken. But, not as much as coffee. You don't want to be on the recieving end of when someone spills a little bit of my coffee. Trust me.\" \"How bad is it?\" DB just stared at him. Before he could answer, Catherine came in. \"Hey Diggs. Who's your friend.\" \"My name's DB. He was showing me where a KFC was for fried chicken. I met him when I accidentally stopped a chase he and Butch were in.\" \"My name's Catherine and how did you stop there chase?\" \"I fell on them.\" \"How di-\" \"I fell on them because of...\" He chuckled a little. \"Ya know what. I'll explain that later. When I'm about to leave. You won't believe me until then.\" \"Okay. So, who were you guys chasing?\" \"Well, it was an enemy of DB here.\" He pointed with his paw to DB, who had gone back to eating. He looked up at the mention of his name and he had a leg stiking out of his mouth. \"DB says his name is Diablo and that he leads a group of people that are his enemies.\" \"Ya, so we shouldn't be surprised if we see the rest of them. Also, I think I remember where I seen that microchip and what it is used for.\" \"Really? Let's go!\" \"Agreed.\" \"Come on, Catherine.\" The three headed back to D.O.G. H.Q. D.O.G. H.Q. The three of them rushed into Lou's office. \"Hello, again. Do you remember where you seen that microchip?\" \"Yes. Bring it up.\" Lou brought the microchip up on the screen. \"Okay. I seen this on the table of a secret organization that is far advanced in their technology. I doubt you've even heard of them. Anyways, that microchip has been used in the production of some of their explosives. He probably stole it from the labratory because it was just recently made there and easier to steal than from the organization.\" \"So, you're saying that with this, he could create a bomb?\" \"Yes. But, if he doesn't have very many of them, he couldn't make a very big explosion. How many did he steal?\" \"He stole three. That's when Diggs and Butch came in. How big of an explosion do you think he could make?\" \"Well, the explosion could wipe out a building, but that's not what I'm concerned about. I'm concerned about why he was only able to take three. He'd be able to go in there and take fifty of them and leave before you even knew what happened.\" \"What are you saying?\" \"I'm saying I think he was using himself as a distraction this time and after Diggs and Butch gave chase, the other three went in after some more microchips, which would explain why he didn't kill Diggs and Butch, like he could have. We need to get to the labratory and check it out.\" \"Alright. I'm going to see if it's alright with Tab for you to work with us on this assignment. Go ahead and leave with them. I'll fill Butch in on the information and have him meet you there.\" \"Alright, let's go you two. We can't wait around.\" DB ran out with Diggs and Catherine hot on his tail. Labratory It was sunset by the time they got to the labratory and Butch was already there. \"you got here fast.\" \"I was close by. I was told not to enter until you three got here. How are we gonna enter?\" \"How about through here?\" He turned to see DB had entered without setting off any alarms and was sticking his head out his entrance. They all entered and started searching for clues. \"Hm. I smell Diablo, Traitor, Mastermind, Avenger, and...\" He took another sniff of the air. \"It couldn't be.\" He took another whiff of the air. \"I refuse to believe it!\" \"Refuse to believe what?\" \"I smell my apprentice. Well, he's sort of an apprentice, but that's beside the point. He could have tried to stop them.\" He sniffed the air some more. He followed the trail to a closet door. He opened it, and out fell a badly beaten golden retreiver and a badly beaten rotwieler. \"We need to get them to a hospital.\" He picked up the golden retriever, while Diggs and Butch took the rotweiler. Veterinarian hospital DB was worridely pacing outside the hospital. \"What is wrong?\" \"The golden retreiver is my apprentice. How he was able to take down Avenger will remain a surprise to me. What I'm curious about, though is why they left Avenger. He must be a message for me, but what?\" He snuck into the hospital to see that they had finished the surgery. He snuck into the recovery room. He seen that Avenger was awake. He jumped up to his bed. \"why did they leave you?\" Avenger chuckled. \"You did exactly what they thought you would. You tried saving my life.\" \"What are you guys planning?\" \"We are planning something bigger than you could imagine. I have a message for you. Watch your back.\" DB jumped down, but His apprentice was still asleep. He laid down wher ehe wouldn't be seen. The others came in. \"DB? Where are you?\" \"Over here.\" \"What are you doing?\" \"i'm gonna make sure they don't hurt my apprentice. He was there to give me a message. Watch my back. He also said they are palnning something bigger than I could imagine. They're going to pay for what they did. I just hope that he'll wake up.\" \"We're going back to HQ to tell Lou what happened. We're going to go back to the lab later to check for more clues. You can stay here to watch your apprentice. See ya.\" The two dogs and cat left DB to watch his apprentice. His eyes never left the bed that his apprentice was in. Okay. Good? Bad? In between? Like fried chicken? Wait. That doesn't match what I had said before. Why'd I put the last one in there? Well, review and tell me your thoughts and check out my poll.[Chapter 2] Second Chapter. Enjoy. DB was still in the same spot until morning. He heard a small groan from his apprentice. H ran and jumped onto the bed. \"Are you alright?\" \"D-DB? Is. Is that you?\" \"Yes. You were hurt bad by those guys.\" \"I was sent there by...agh...by the second in command because he had heard that they were starting to catch up, so he wanted me to see how close they were to us. But, the others came in. I was able to get all three of them good. Avenger got the worst of it from me.\" \"i know he did. He's here.\" \"What?\" \"they left him to give me a message. Watch my back. He also said they were planning something bigger than I could imagine.\" \"With how many of the microchips they had in that lab, they could destroy all of North America, if they took them all.\" DB went wide-eyed. \"Did they say what their plan was?\" \"You kidding? They don't give away any of their plan until they are about to unleash it.\" \"Good point. You need to get some rest.\" His apprentice stared at him. \"I've had more than enough rest.\" He started to get up, but DB pushed him back down. \"You taught me to fight through pain.\" DB sighed. \"That is when you are fighting or when you're needing to keep moving. when you don't have to keep moving, the lesson is to stay put. I thought you would have learned that from when I got injured in from missions. I stayed in bed until I was ready to start moving around. You are not ready to start moving.\" Butch came in and noticed DB on the bed. \"How's he doing?\" \"He's up.\" \"Who is that?\" \"That's Butch. He was there when we found you.\" Butch jumped up onto the bed with the two of them. \"You were pretty banged up, but so was... what was his name again?\" \"Avenger. He knows. He also says that with how many of those microchips he seen, they could destroy all of North America if they took them all. Do you know how many of them were taken?\" \"All of them.\" \"This is bad. What's worse is that if they examine them, they could start making there own with all the other materials they have stolen.\" \"We haven't heard about any robberies involving gold, silver, platinum, or anything else that's used for making microchips.\" DB sighed. \"I know you wouldn't. But, you'll understand when I'm about to leave.\" \"So, what's your apprentice's name?\" \"How long have you two known each other?\" \"Only a day. What does that have to do with anything?\" \"Well, I always give his name out within a certain period of time. He was afraid I had forgotten about him. His code-name is Digger, for reasons you are not allowed to know.\" Butch just stared at him. \"That sounds like something a human would give their pets.\" \"But, it isn't. We gave him that code-name, again, for reasons you are not allowed to know. We need to find out where those guys base is.\" \"We have a plan for that.\" \"What? Stick a tracking chip on Avenger's collar and seeing where he goes?\" DB and Digger started to laugh. \"That is actually our plan.\" DB just shook his head. \"He would notice if he had a tracking chip on him and would be sure not to go to the base or near the others. He would just distract us.\" \"Well, how about having someone follow him?\" \"He'd know if he was being followed and, if it was either me or Digger, or someone else that could take him down, he would just stay away from the others. If it was someone he could take down, they'd be dead.\" \"He's right. I would kill anyone you sent to track me.\" They all turned to see Avenger standing. \"You're to weak to fight us off.\" \"but they aren't.\" Just then a piece of the roof fell. A wolf and a cat came down. \"Mastermind and Traitor. How nice to meet you both. How about you both leave?\" \"How about, no!\" DB quickly flipped off of the table to avoid an attack form behind. He landed on the wolf. \"Thanks for the landing, Mastermind. Also, nice try, Diablo.\" Butch jumped off the table and looked at Diablo. He looked a lot like DB, except he had messier fur and two tufts on his head that were in the shape of horns. He also looked as though his fur was darker. Butch just thought it was a trick of the light. But, Diablo looked evil none-the-less. \"He looks a lot like you, only evil.\" \"Exactly what he is. Diablo, what is your plan?\" Diablo chuckled. \"You won't know until it is too late for you to do anything about it.\" He had a Spanish accent. \"Collar, laser.\" A laser came out of Butch's collar, but Diablo just dodged it. \"Nice try, but better luck next time.\" Diablo knocked DB off of Mastermind and they left with Avenger. \"Let's grab Digger and get out of here.\" Digger stood up and began walking. \"how are you able to walk with how beaten up you were?\" \"I've had training.\" The trio left and headed for D.O.G. H.Q. D.O.G. H.Q. The trio entered the headquarters and all eyes were on Digger. \"Why is everyone watching me?\" \"Because you are beaten up and shouldn't even be walking. Just follow me to Lou so we can fill him in.\" They walked to Lou's office and Diggs and Catherine were sitting in there. \"how is he walking!? He seemed beaten half to death when we found him!\" \"I know. All he said to me was that he had training.\" \"Well, what news do you have?\" \"Um. The group has enough of those microchips that they could destroy all of North America.\" \"Diggs, Catherine and Butch went back to the crime scene an-\" \"and they didn't find anything. I figure they would clean it up after we took Avenger and Digger out of there. I'm gonna go back myself, alone. I'll see if I can find any clues.\" \"What if you get attacked?\" \"They wouldn't expect me to go there alone with them all being here. They also wouldn't expect me to go there with you guys, since you wouldn't be able to take them out.\" Suddnely, the alarm sounded, saying, \"INTRUDER ALERT! INTRUDER ALERT!\" Lou pressed a button, showing another black lab. and surrounded by other dogs and some defense devices. \"Shut down the defense system. I know him.\" \"Alright.\" \"Defense system shut down.\" DB walked out to the black lab that had entered. He was still surrounded by other dogs. \"What are you doing here?\" \"looking for you. That's what.\" \"Well, at least you're here. We're gonna need your help.\" \"let me take a wild guess. Your enemies are here.\" \"Correct.\" \"Who is ths guy? He looks just like you. Is he your brother?\" \"No. His name is Wayward Son.\" \"That is a strange name for someone.\" \"I could easily take you down, so don't push me.\" \"You try to, i'll take you down. Sorry about that. If I wasn't here, he would have said some sort of insult along with saying an insult.\" \"I have a question. How did you get in here?\" \"I broke in fairly easily.\" \"I could break in easily myself. Off of that subject. You and me are gonna have to go to a lab and look for clues left by my enemies.\" \"I've already been there. I seen them clean it up. I looked for clues they may have missed, whether on purpose or accident.\" \"why would they leave clues on purpose?\" \"They like to play little games with us. What do you have?\" \"I know where their base is.\" \"Where?\" \"Directly beneath the labratory.\" \"That does not sound like them. Why would they have it beneath the place that they robbed and then run away from it?\" \"i'm not sure. Maybe they wanted to get our attention.\" \"Well, let's go there and kick some tail.\" \"No. It's some kind of trap.\" \"How do you know?\" DB smirked. \"I know these guys. Any other clues?\" \"Yes. I found faint traces of coal on the floor. It was too little too have been missed on purpose. So, I'm guessing that they tried to clean it up so we would miss it, but they were unable to clean it all up. So, they are staying in a building with coal.\" \"My thoughts exactly. Where are some buildings with coal?\" \"There are four in L.A.\" \"Too close. Try a four mile radius outside of L.A.\" \"Three more showed up.\" \"Hm. They would try to make it more discreet than that. How many bardges are filled with coal near L.A. Start with the ones that are not going to be leaving soon.\" \"Twenty.\" \"they're on one of those bardges. They would want us to search all of them, allowing them time to escape. So we need to find out which one they're using as a base.\" \"Why can't we just use video to see which one they enter?\" \"They would make sure to enter one, but use another as a base. That is a common thing the organization does. We can use it to rule out which one is their base. Course, how many are not under survelance?\" \"Only one.\" \"Rule that one out as well. Rule out the one that is the easiest accessable, as well. Along with the hardest one to access.\" \"so, four down, sixteen to go. This could take a while.\" \"It's farther than you would have gotten without me. We need to go out and ask some questions.\" \"Let's see if Seamus has seen anything.\" \"That dumb bird?\" \"Well, Wayward Son. It actually would be a good thing to ask him because if he were to follow them, they would consider him too small of a threat to take him out, so his stupidity would protect him. And, don't say what you're thinking. Let's go.\" Alley-way The group walked into the alley that Seamus stays in. \"He lives in a place this filthy?\" \"There aren't a whole lot of clean alley-ways. So, ya.\" \"Hello there. Long time no see. Who are your friends?\" \"Hello, Seamus. This is DB and Wayward Son. We are here to see if you could give us some information.\" \"what kind of information?\" \"Have you seen a dog that looks similar to me and Wayward Son, but he has messy fur and it looks like he has horns on his head because of two tufts of fur on his head. He would have been travelling with a wolf, a cat and a rotwieler at some point.\" \"Hm. Could he have met up with them on a boat instead of traveling with them?\" \"Yes.\" \"Well, then yes I have.\" \"Could you take us to the boat that they meet on?\" \"Sure. Follow me.\" He took off and the rest followed below. They came to the river and Seamus pointed to a certain barge. \"That is the boat they've been meeting on.\" \"You know, Seamus. you're limited intelligence has saved your life.\" \"What do you mean?\" \"i mean they figured that you were too stupid to be a threat.\" DB then sighed. \"We're being watched by Diablo.\" \"Si.\" They all turned around to see Diablo standing on a roof. \"you should have headed the warning, DB.\" \"What do you mean?\" Diablo chuckled. \"That is never a good sign.\" \"Hey, um you got a little thing sticking out of your rear end here.\" \"Don't pull it out. Let Wayward Son have a look at it so he can tell if it is safe to remove.\" \"Um, what if I've already taken it out? Do you want me to put it back in?\" \"No. I don't. You shoul-\" DB soon fell over. Diablo left and theothers carried DB back to D.O.G. H.Q. to see what is wrong with him. Well, that ain't good. Wonder what happened to him? Continue reading![Chapter 3] New chapter! I had a long day of shopping with my parents, so I'm ready to start typing a story for your enjoyment. Wayward Son was sniffing the dart that had been shot at DB. \"So, what did the dart do to him?\" \"Well, the poison on there smells like a kind that the organization uses to knock out a target just long enough to get them into a base for interogation, which takes, at most, three hours. But, there is another scent on it. I'm not able to place it. Think you could run a scan on it to see what chemicals are used?\" \"Sure.\" Peek then took it off to a lab to test it. \"How long should it be before he gets an answer?\" \"Thirty minutes at the most.\" \"I'm gonna rip those guys to shreds for what they did to DB!\" \"Digger, calm down. We will get him. I know you look up to DB and you look out for each other, but you are still in no condition to fight and you don't want to see them get more crimes done, but you need to remain calm so you can think and act rationally.\" \"ACT RATIONALLY!? Rationality is not going to do much to get them with how they are doing this! They obviously LET Seamus follow them to their 'base of operations' so they could lead DB there to take him out and then the greatest threat would be gone, so the only way to get them is to do stuff they wouldn't expect, and one thing they would expect is acting rationally!\" Wayward Son just stared at him. \"You've never shown this much anger before. And, that is actually the most you've ever been able to decipher about their plans without DB's help. This is good. You are right about acting rationally, as well. I'd say they would also expect us to think-\" \"That they've switched bases! So, they would go somewhere else to make us think that, in case they were to be followed, then go right back to where they were! Let's pay them a little visit. We're gonna need stealth.\" Digger then let out a small smirk. \"what are you planning?\" \"Lou, can I have complete access to the science lab? I have something I want to build to help with taking them out.\" \"alright. As long as Peek is in there with you.\" \"Fine by me.\" He runs into the lab. \"i wonder what he is planning on making?\" \"does he often invent things?\" \"Yes. Though, they usually need to make at least five versions of it before it will work.\" \"So, it won't work?\" \"He's probably going to just build something that has already been perfected.\" thirty minuted later Peek came out with a pice of paper. He set it down on a desk. \"This is the list of chemicals on the dart. Also, you will like what Digger is making. I'm gonna go help him.\" Peek then ran back into the lab. Wayward Son walked up to the piece of paper and began to read to himself. He looked up with a worried expression and looked towards DB. \"Not good.\" \"What?\" \"I need to get an antidote made. Do you have any chemicals here?\" \"Um, yes. They're in the lab.\" \"alright, I'll take what I need from there, then go out and get the others that I need.\" He then ran into the lab. A siren went off. The screen changed to have a picture of Mr. Tinkles. \"I need help!\" \"Why should we help you, you lunatic?\" \"Because, I can give you information on those four freaks and I need protection from them!\" \"what kind of information?\" \"They are currently using my mansion as a base and they are planning on causing an explosion that will effect more than what we see! I'm not sure what they meant by that.\" Wayward Son comes back out with a mixture. \"you guys had everything I needed. Also, I know what they meant by that. Also, they will now go after Kitty Galore to ask her what they asked you. You are not the first to be asked that question. But, you are the first to refuse.\" \"i refused because I didn't trust them.\" \"There's more to it than that, but that is unimportant. Alright, give him this the same way he was given the other in the same place and he'll be fine in a day. I'm gonna go get him. Do you want me to bring him here?\" \"Yes.\" An explosion was heard on the screen. \"OH NO! THEY'RE HERE!\" \"Don't worry. They won't kill you. Just take you prisoner.\" The connection was then cut. \"Well, guess we need to wit until we know where exactly they plan on staying, if anywhere permanent.\" The screen then activates again, showing Diablo. \"Hola. You shall all fall because of my hand! Your organization will crumble and you will all remember my name. Also, I knew Wayward Son would find the antidote. I just needed you all distracted long enough for me to get the next phase of my plan finished.\" The screen then went blank. \"Should have known. He has his second phase completed.\" Digger and Peek came out with big smiles on their faces. \"I've gotten it completed. They won't kno what hit 'em.\" \"what did you build?\" \"Come and see.\" They followed him to the lab and Wayward Son smiled. \"we will have victory. i also see you've put some enhancements to it.\" \"Thank Peek. He came up with the idea.\" \"Well, once DB wakes up, we will go and fight them. Digger, it's time for you to use your best skills. I know that Diablo has a laptop.\" \"I'm on it. I'll let you know where it is every minute.\" \"Good. Now, we wait.\" \"Wait!? Shouldn't we go after those guys?\" \"No, Diggs. They would expect us to come after them, so they would have a trap ready for almost anything. We also don't know if they are still at that mansion, so we will wait for DB to wake up. In the mean time, lets get some fried chicken.\" \"you sound just like DB, there.\" \"i know.\" KFC Wayward Son is eating the chicken that he stole. \"Why did you steal that?\" \"I don't like begging. Besides, i made sure to leave some money close enough to the cash register that they would think it came out of there and put it in.\" \"So, why did you want fried chicken?\" \"I was hungry.\" Just then, the ground below them opened up and they fell into a base area. \"I also knew they would booby trap the KFC.\" \"so, you planned to have yourselves be captured.\" \"Yes, Diablo. But, we aren't captured.\" \"Looks like it to me.\" \"We are free to move, Traitor. Now, attack!\" Well, there's the chapter. Review please.[Chapter 4] Well, I'm ready to write another chpter for this! Enjoy. Wayward Son rammed Avenger, pushing him to the ground. Then, he tackled Traitor to the ground. Butch stopped an attack from Diablo, only to get his nose broke by Diablo kicking him with his hind legs. Diggs and Catherine had their hands full with Mastermind. Mastermind bit onto Diggs snout and held him there while Catherine tried to get at him, but Mastermind was able to either dodge or block her. Diggs hit Mastermind in the throat to get him to let go. As soon as he did, Diggs rammed into him, allowing Catherine to get her claws onto his back. He let out a growl and rolled onto the ground, forcing her off. He then grabbed her by the tail and threw her into Diggs. Butch was pushed against a wall by Diablo. Diablo backed up and then rammed him again. Butch fell to the ground. He had the wind knocked out of him. Diablo grabbed him by the scruff of his neck and threw him into Wayward Son, who was still pinning Traitor. \"This is pathetic. You are supposed to be spies with excellent training in fighting, but you didn't even last twenty minutes. Too ea-\" He was interupted by the wall exploding. \"What is that!?\" Out of the hole came a vehicle that looked a little like a four legged spider with a sonic gun in the front, top, rear, and two on the bottom. It also had a gatling gun on the cockpit of the vehicle and tank barrels on either side of it. \"How do you like this? It's like the Big Brother on steroids.\" \"We're going to have to get a few of those and make them as common as the Big Brother.\" \"How did you build that?\" \"you'd be surprised what you can make at their H.Q. Peek, wanna fire the forward gun?\" \"Thought you'd never ask.\" Peek pressed a button and the sonic gun on the fron began to blast and another wall came down, revealing the microchips. \"I'll take care of those microchips.\" Digger pressed another button and he gattling gun started firing. It slowly mad eit's way towards the microchips. Diablo rushed towards the microchips, only to be pushe dout of the way by Wayward Son. \"Hey guys, take a position in the vehicle!\" \"Alright. Let's go!\" Butch took the rear gun, while Diggs and Catherine took the two bottom guns. The gatling gun finally reached the microchips and destroyed them. \"NOO!\" You will all pay for that.\" \"No they won't!\" \"DB!? You shouldn't be up yet.\" \"you know I would never let you fight these guys alone. Now we can beat them without this really cool machine. Guys, make sure this place is completely destroyed.\" Peek and Digger started shooting the gatling guns and forward gun. Wayward Son jumped onto the top of it and went indie to control the two tank barrels. DB got up to the top gun. DB began to fire and have it turn, making sure to make the ceiling collapse. \"Let's go!\" The vehicle began leaving, but not without Wayward Son firing as much as he could. The y eventually got to the H.Q. When they got out, they were greeted by a round of applause from the dogs. On the screen was Tab. \"Congratualtions on your fine work.\" \"I don't think we really did all that great.\" \"what do you mean? You seen the ceiling of that place collapse on them. You never seen them leave.\" \"Well, Lou, we didn't see it collapse on them. we seen it collapse. They could have gotten out. It also seemed a little too easy. They would have tried to destroy the machine, not just sit there and try to save the microchips. Diablo would have also been able to push Wayward Son off fast enough to get to the microchips in time to save them, if he wanted to.\" \"He's right. They seemed to want us to win.\" \"Now that I think about it, you guys are right.\" \"So, this isn't over?\" \"It's over for you, but it's still a long way to go for us. We won't stop fighting them until they are dead.\" \"how do you know they are done here?\" \"they usually make an easy win for us when they are about to leave and mess with someone else. I have no idea what they are planning on doing with everything they have stolen.\" \"What have they stolen?\" \"Well, the microchip, things ot be able to make the microchips-those I understand- some peach tree petals, some metal, a few guns that were made by the organization, and paper. i presume the paper is blueprints for whatever they're builing.\" \"Why did they steal petals from a peach tree?\" \"i'm not sure. Course, there could be some stuff I haven't seen them steal, which they easily could have with all those times they've gone off the grid for prolonged periods of time. If you see them again, make sure to find a way to contact us.\" \"where are you even from?\" A portal opened up from nowhere, surprising everyone. \"A different dimension. The villains are from the same place. Also, Diablo was my inner evil, but because of Mastermind, he no longer is.\" They all left, leaving the agents confused. Unknown location A screen went blank. \"They now know we let them win.\" \"Oh well. We still have Mr. Tinkles prisoner.\" The two walked away. \"We are one step closer to having everything we need to fulfill our plans.\" \"He was wrong on it being the last they have heard of us.\" A door opened up, revealing a big room lined with different, seemingly unrelated objects. Diablo set a microchip on a shelf. \"We need to make mor eof those microchips, collect a few more items, then force DB to finish the job.\" \"Si. We will not fail.\" The End? Okay. this is done. Pease let me know how I did. I know this isn't a very long story, but I had almost no ideas on how to continue this after the first chapter. It was like all the ideas I had for this were gone. Well, review. I don't care what you say as long as you review. ","Summary":" Hello, people of Earth. Wait, I've used that openeing before. Um. Hello people with internet access"},{"Movie":"Cats & Dogs","Title":"Cats and Dogs: Michael's story","Author":"vburro08","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11247706","Passage":"[Chapter 1] Hello fellow fanfiction fans, vburro08 here. This is my first fanfic ever, don't know yet if it will be my only fanfic(that is a distinct possibility). Reviews, positive or negative, are welcome. DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN CATS AND DOGS OR ANY CHARACTERS FROM THE SERIES! ONLY MY OC'S. Butch, Lou, and all other characters from the Cats and Dogs films belong to Warner Brothers Home Entertainment. As his assistant watched, Dr. Jeff Goldberg slowly heated a beaker over a Bunsen burner. Bringing the chemical inside the beaker to a boil, he then reduced the heat under the beaker. \"What are you working on now, Dr. Goldberg?\" asked the assistant, brushing his hair away from his eyes. \"Something that could possibly revolutionize the pet allergy section of pharmaceuticals, Michael\" answered the scientist, carefully watching the boiling liquid. \"How so, Doctor?\" Michael asked, curious. \"This compound that I'm working on could possibly cure dog allergies in humans, permanently. That would be a major breakthrough in the medical industry! Not to mention it would be great news for people who suffer from dog allergies. Now, this is only a part of the overall experiment\". \"What do you mean?\" \"There's another scientist, a Dr. Brody in California, who's working on this as well. We've talked a few times, comparing notes, that sort of thing\". \"He sounds like a pretty smart guy\" said Michael. \"He is\" said Dr. Goldberg, removing the beaker from the burner. \"He's a bit odd, but very bright, very dedicated to his research\". \"He sounds like a first class scientist\" Michael commented, watching the scientist bustle about the lab. \"He is\" said Goldberg, reaching for some other chemicals that he kept on a shelf. Noticing that Michael was rubbing his eyes, he smiled. \"You look a little tired. Why don't you go back to the house. I'll finish up here\". \"Thank you\" said Michael. Rising from the table, he stretched, yawning. Walking toward the outer door of the lab, he paused to swipe his keycard in the lock. As he stepped outside, he took a deep breath, exhaling slowly, enjoying the light breeze blowing on his skin. Walking toward the house he and the doctor shared, he paused and waved at the security guard, Sam. \"Good night Sam\". \"Good night Michael\" came the cheerful response, and he continued towards the house. He hadn't gone more than a hundred yards when an explosion ripped through the air, shattering the stillness of the night. Michael was thrown to the ground, shaken, but alive and unhurt. Turning toward the source of the noise, he was horrified to see the lab engulfed in flames. He ran toward the building, calling for the blaze, he was temporarily forced back by the intense heat. He could hear the shouts of the hired security team, but they were too far away to help. That left only him. Looking around, he soon spotted a pair of heavy duty work overalls and steel-toed boots, along with a yellow utility helmet. It would have to do. Donning his makeshift fireman's gear, he forced his way into the burning building, despite the flames and heat. \"DOCTOR! DOCTOR GOLDBERG, WHERE ARE YOU!?\" Hearing a weak call for help, he turned toward the sound, blindly searching for the caller. \"Keep calling, I'll find you!\" he shouted. Suddenly, he was grabbed from behind and hustled outside. When he tried to re-enter the building, he felt several arms encircling his body. Struggling proved useless, as the men were stronger and more determined than he was. Afterwards, he couldn't remember very much of that night, just snippets here and there: questioning the doctor about the experiment, saying good night to Sam before heading toward the house. And always, the explosion, the heat, searching frantically for Dr. Goldberg, hearing his frantic cries for help as the flames consumed him. After being treated for minor burns and cuts he'd sustained from the explosion and his failed rescue attempt, Michael was released from the hospital and taken to police headquarters to give a statement, before heading to a friend's house for some rest. Days went by, then weeks. The police searched through the debris, but found nothing to indicate foul play was involved. Gradually, the investigation into the explosion at the lab was shelved for want of evidence. In spite of this, Michael refused to give up, and continued to search for the truth. One day, as he was reviewing the footage from the security cameras, he saw something neither he, nor the police had noticed before. It seemed inconspicuous, yet to Michael, it was like he had seen it himself. The screen showed the security guard, Sam, apparently dropping a small package of some sort near the side of the lab. Minutes later, there was a bright flash on-screen which soon resolved into flames. But when he took the tape to the police, the officer he spoke to wasn't interested in reviewing the footage. \"We've got better things to do than wasting our time chasing after leads that won't go anywhere\" he said, pushing the tape back toward Michael. \"Face it, kid. Accidents happen\". \"But this tape proves that it wasn't an accident\" Michael said vehemently. \"Look, kid, I'm sorry about what happened to your friend\" said the officer. \"But there's just no evidence of foul play. We would have found it by now if there were\". Rising from his seat, he took Michael by the arm. Furious, Michael shrugged it off and stormed out of the police station. When he arrived back at the house he was staying at, he saw the light blinking on the answering machine. \"That's odd\" he muttered, setting the tape on the kitchen table. \"Mark never lets the machine get it when he's around\". Looking around, he soon spotted a note taped to the refrigerator door. It read \" Dear Michael, I'm sorry I have to leave, but my dad suffered a heart attack in Florida. Mom has asked that I come and be with them during this time. I don't know how long I'll be gone, but I know you can handle things at the house for me while I'm gone. I'll call as soon as I know something. In the mean time keep up the investigating. I know you'll find something the police didn't. I have complete faith in you in this matter. Your friend, Mark\" Below was the number for a hotel near Miami that Michael knew. Turning to the answering machine, he pushed PLAY. It was a message from Mark, letting him know that he'd arrived safely at the hotel and would call as soon as he knew anything. Turning off the machine, Michael heard the click of the mail slot, signifying the arrival of the morning he sorted the mail, leafing through assorted bills and sympathy cards, he came upon a blank, unsealed envelope. Curious, he lifted the flap and extracted a 3x5 inch card. Typed on the card was this message. \"If you want more information on the explosion, be in the alley behind Tony's restaurant at 11:30 tonight. Come alone.\" It was unsigned. Curious, he examined first the card, then the envelope to see if he could learn anything about the sender, but found nothing out of the ordinary. \"Well, I guess I'll just have to wait 'til tonight to find out more\" he sighed, sliding the card back in the night, he went to the restaurant mentioned in the note. It was a nice place for steak and beer, and little else. Checking his watch, he saw it was almost time to meet the sender, whoever they were. Hearing a noise behind him, he turned and looked, staring into the shadows. \"You made it\" came a voice to his left. \"For a moment there I thought you wouldn't show.\" \"Who are you?\" Michael asked, trying to get a glimpse of the speaker. \"All in good time, Michael\" came the answer. \"First tell me what you know about what happened.\" \"If you're the one who sent the note, then you already know that\" Michael answered. \"Not everything\" came the reply. \"For instance, I don't know what caused it, or who.\" \"That's easy enough to answer\" said Michael, frowning. \"It was a bomb planted near a wall that caused the explosion. As for who planted it, it was the security guard, Sam.\" \"Very well\" said the voice. \"What else do you want to know?\" \"Your name, for a start\" Michael said, laughing a little. \"Fair enough\" the voice replied. \"My name's Butch. I've been assigned to this case by my boss. From what we can tell, the doctor was working on a cure for dog allergies when the explosion happened. As for what I am, you'll just have to see for yourself.\" \"What do you mean by that\" Michael asked. There was no answer, but he soon heard nails clicking on asphalt. \"You're a dog!?\" he exclaimed, puzzled. \"Glad to see your ears are still working\" said an Anatolian shepherd, as he stepped into the light. \"And yes, I am a dog thank you very much.\" \"But how…\" Just then, indistinct noises began coming out of the dog's collar. Holding up a paw to hush Michael, Butch listened to the radio, his expression annoyed at first, then changing to one of concern as he glanced at Michael. \"We have a problem\" he said, signing off. \"My boss just told me there's a group of about five cats headed our way, ETA thirty seconds.\" \"Can't you handle them?\" Michael asked. \"I mean, they're just cats for crying out loud, what's so scary about that?\" \"Because three of them happen to be the best cat assassins in the world\" said Butch, heading toward the alley opening. Suddenly, the entrance was blocked. Two Siamese, two ginger toms and an American short-hair stood there, glaring at Butch who stepped protectively in front of Michael. \"Hand over the human, dog!\" snarled the short-hair. \"It won't happen, so why don't you cats just get out of our way and leave us alone\" Butch growled, bristling. Letting out a yell, the gingers charged Butch. \"Run for it kid!\" Butch yelled, meeting the cats head-on. As the fight progressed, it was clear that neither of the combatants was an amateur, for the cats and Butch each had years of experience fighting the other species. Soon, however, the cats had Butch backed into a corner. Looking for something that would help, Michael spotted several rocks and a length of steel chain on the ground nearby. Picking these up, he ran back toward the fighting animals. \"HEY CATS!\" Hearing Michael yell at them, the gingers turned around, only to get hit in the face by flying rocks. Shrieking in rage, and pain, one of them hit Butch in the head, stunning him. \"We'll deal with you later\" he growled. Turning, they joined the other three cats surrounding Michael. \"You're going to regret doing that human!\" one of them spat as they circled, waiting to strike. Michael said nothing, waiting for them to move. One of the cats leaped towards him, claws extended, only to be effortlessly knocked aside. Another tried his luck, with the same result. After that the short-hair pulled out a small knife. Grinning, he waved the weapon teasingly in front of him, only to be sent flying through the air by a punt, courtesy of Michael's left foot. Then, the Siamese cats struck. Pulling out shuriken, they sent them flying toward Michael, advancing as they threw. Michael used the chain to block them, then threw some rocks in return. By this time, the other cats had rejoined the fight, and were throwing everything from glass shards to throwing knives. But, no matter how hard they tried, or what they threw, Michael blocked every shot. Finally, they ran out of things to throw. \"Well now\" said Michael, dropping the chain. \"Looks like its hand-to-hand combat from here on out.\" \"That suits us fine\" the short-hair yowled. Jumping on to trashcans and dumpsters, the cats leaped at him simultaneously, only to collide with each other in mid-air. \"What the-\" \"Where'd he go!?\" Just then, they heard a mocking whistle, but when they turned in that direction, they heard it coming from the other side of the alley. By the time they figured out what was happening, it was too late. A heavy rope net had dropped down seemingly out of nowhere, trapping the cats until Michael could tie them up with twine. \"Well, that takes care of that\" he said. Turning to check on Butch, he found the dog standing, staring at him in shock. \"Where'd you learn to fight like that?\" he asked, walking up to the net. \"My dad insisted that we learn to defend ourselves when I was a kid\" Michael said. \"It's paid off a number of times in my life.\" \"I'll say it did\" Butch said, walking closer to Michael. Pressing a button on his collar, he said \"H.Q this is agent 127 reporting: All assailants have been neutralized. Package is secure.\" \"Well done, Butch\" came the response. \"We're sending a vehicle to your position, ETA 2 minutes.\" \"Butch, we've got trouble\" Michael said, tapping on his cell phone. Glancing at the screen, Butch saw a large group of heavily armed cats. \"Where are they?\" he asked. \"About three blocks from this location\" Michael answered. \"They'll be here soon.\" \"H.Q this is agent 127 requesting immediate evac. I'm tracking a large, heavily armed group of enemy agents approximately two blocks west of this location. ETA 30 seconds.\" \"Roger 127. Be advised, we cannot assist at this time. Suggest moving to rendezvous point Charlie to await extraction.\" \"Roger H.Q., moving to Charlie, ETA 20 seconds\" said Butch, trotting towards the alley entrance. Michael jogged along with him. \"Where's rendezvous point Charlie?\" Michael asked. \"It's a warehouse down the street from here\" Butch answered, looking around for enemy the group approaching them from the left, they quickly left the alley and headed for the warehouse, being careful to stay in the shadows. They soon arrived at the warehouse, only to find the building surrounded. Motioning for Butch to follow, Michael went into an alley beside the building. \"If I remember correctly, there's a set of doors that lead down to a cellar that houses all the broken merchandise that comes in\" Michael whispered. \"It's not the most ideal entrance, but I don't see many other choices right now.\" \"I know the one you're talking about,\" Butch whispered back. \"That's where we have a transportation hub. We can use that to get to H.Q if the cats aren't down there.\" \"You saying I'm coming with you?\" Michael asked. \"Right now, we don't have much of a choice\" Butch replied. Peering through a broken window and not seeing any movement, Butch lifted the latch, and prepared to throw open the door. \"Wait\" Michael hissed, pointing down the alley. A pair of cats were just walking by. Butch nodded his thanks, waiting until they passed before opening the doors. They reached the transport hub without further incident. \"Okay kid, I'm just gonna do a quick systems check, then we're outta here\" said Butch, flipping various switches on the rocket-sled's dashboard. \"Better hurry, Butch\" said Michael. \"My scanners indicate enemy movement outside.\" \"It's done. Hop in and hang on\" Butch said, jumping into the driver's seat. Pressing a button, he activated the thrusters, and soon, they were on their way. Glancing over his shoulder, Michael saw another rocket-sled coming up behind them. When he mentioned it to Butch, the dog looked back, then shoved the throttle wide open. In spite of his efforts, the pursuing sled drew closer with each second. Unstrapping himself from his harness, Butch readied himself to jump on to the other sled. Michael reached out and tapped his shoulder. \"There's no need for heroics Butch\" he called. Rummaging in his back pack, he pulled out a small coin and showed it to Butch, before tossing it at the pursuing sled and pressing a button on his watch. Seconds later, they were watching the other sled grow smaller and smaller. Then, there was a small flash, and a distant bang echoed through the tunnel. Anticipating Butch's question, Michael smiled. \"It's my own gadget\" he said, pointing to a handful of what looked like ordinary pocket change. \"I took an old spy technique and tweaked it a little. The one I just used has a small engine that generates an Electro-Magnetic Pulse. After it fries whatever electronic it lands on, it self-destructs three seconds later.\" \"It sure fried that thing\" said Butch, strapping on his harness again. They continued on their way and reached D.O.G headquarters without further incident. Stepping out of the rocket sled, Butch approached a door in the wall, beside which rested a paw-scanner. However, before he could lower his paw, a hidden door slid open, revealing a pair of scowling mastiffs. \"Agent 127! What do you think you're doing?\" one growled softly. Turning slowly, Butch asked \"what business is it of yours, Kowalski?\" \"You know the rules, Butch\" said the other. \"In order to survive, this agency has to be kept secret from humans. That means no bringing them here, no revealing the rocket sleds, and especially, no talking to them\". \"You do realize I can hear everything you say, right?\" Michael asked, smiling a little. They had, of course, been speaking in regular dog language, so when they heard Michael speaking to them the same way, their eyes widened. Turning toward Michael, they eyed him warily. \"Butch, did you know about this?\" Kowalski inquired. Butch shook his head. \"You do realize that we'll have to report this to the Chief, right?\" asked the other. \"I realize that, King\" said Butch. Turning to face Michael, he said \"Sorry kid, but you'll need to wear a blind fold for a little while\". \"I'd be surprised if I didn't\" Michael said, climbing out of the sled. Turning around, he allowed them to place a blind-fold over his eyes. Author's note: well, there you have it folks! please let me know how i'm doing via review, and whether or not I should continue this story.[Chapter 2] Hello again fellow ficcers. My apologies for all the dialogue in this chapter, though i hope you find it as good as the first. In this chapter, we're introduced to the chief of D.O.G hq and find out some of what Michael did during the months following the explosion. DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN CATS AND DOGS, ONLY MY OC'S. CATS AND DOGS IS THE PROPERTY OF WARNER BROTHERS HOME ENTERTAINMENT. After the blindfold was in place, they led him throught a series of doors and hallways, with many twists and turns. After the blindfold was removed, Michael looked around him, squinting against the harsh, flourescent lighting. \"What is this, some kind of holding cell?\" he asked. \"We prefer 'Containment Chamber', but yeah, it is\" said Butch, giving him look that meant \"no more questions\". Catching the unspoken message, Michael nodded, sitting on the floor of the cell once the dogs were outside. Closing the cell door, they headed down the hallway, leaving through a door that Michael assumed was the one they'd come through earlier. Hours went by. Michael spent that time reviewing what he knew about the case and trying to make sense of it, but questions remained. Who would want Dr. Goldberg dead? Why would they? And how did Sam get involved? The more he tried to make sense of it, the more puzzling it became. Hearing the door opening, Michael looked up to see Butch and the agent called Kowalski entering the cell. \"The boss wants to speak with you\" said Butch. Stepping out of the cell, he waited for Michael to exit, then closed the door. The boss turned out to be a corgi named Sutton. \"Have a seat, gentlemen\" he said, as they walked in. \"Sutton!?\" Michael asked, staring at the corgi. \"Whatever happened to hello?\" the corgi asked, grinning at the human. \"You know this human, chief?\" Kowalski asked. \"Obviously\" Sutton said. \"It's been a while since we last saw each other\". \"Yep, it sure has\" Michael chuckled, sitting on the floor. \"So, how's married life treating you?\" he asked. In reply, Sutton pulled out a picture of himself, along with seven small puppies, all grouped around a smilling female corgi. Michael stared at the picture, a gentle smile on his face. \"That good, huh?\" \"Yes\" Sutton responded, gazing tenderly at the picture. Stowing it in his desk, he instantly assumed a more serious look. \"I assume you're here to ask for some help solving your friend's murder\" he said. Frowning, Michael nodded. \"First things first. I'm guessing you have evidence to back up your suspicions\" Sutton said, eliciting another nod. Michael then dug into his bag, and, pulling out the security tape he'd brought with him, he handed it to the corgi, before pulling out a VCR that grew to full size at the press of a button. \"You've completed the shrink-ray I see\" Sutton noted. \"This is the first prototype that I've made that's actually worked for both shrinking and enlarging something without destablizing the atomic structure of that particular item\" said Michael. \"The VCR also doubles as a projector, so any time I want to watch VHS tapes and don't have a TV to hook into-\" \"You just find a blank wall and activate the projector\" said Butch. \"You got it\" said Michael. \"So, if you had the shrink-ray all this time, why didn't you use it in the alley?\" Kowalski asked, frowning. \"Because I haven't tested it's effects on animals or humans yet\" Michael said. \"If I tested it on a living subject, and they died as a result, that wouldn't be very good for me, now would it?\" \"Guess not\" Kowalski said, shrugging. After the tape was over, Sutton leaned back in his chair. \"Well, I have to admit, it does seem like Sam is guilty. But you're sure that he acted alone?\" he asked Michael. \"No, I'm not\" said Michael, earning a startled gance from Butch. \"Why?\" Kowalski inquired. \"I've gone over the payroll accounts. Sam was only working part-time at the lab, and that was the only work he had, yet bank records indicate he made at least three $50,000.00 deposites during the past two months\" Michael answered. \"Could it be a competitor?\" asked Butch. Michael shook his head. \"I checked online with state police across the country, as well as their banks, and while many of them did have withdrawals of 50,000 or more, none of it could be traced to Sam's account\". \"What about family?\" asked Sutton. Again Michael shook his head. \"That was the first thing I checked. Sam didn't have any living relatives, or siblings.\" \"So we don't know who paid him, or how to go about finding them\" Butch sighed. Michael grinned at him. \"We don't know who paid him, we do have a way of finding out\" he said. \"How?\" Kowalski asked. \"The deposits were all wire-transfers\"Michael said. \"So we trace the numbers on the transfers and we've got our guy\" said Butch. \"Not exactly\" said Sutton. \"If we trace the numbers on the transfers, we get the bank account. Finding out who owns the account will a little harder than that\". \"He's right, Butch\" said Kowalski. \"My current master is a banker. They aren't exactly forthcoming when it comes to giving out information on who their clients are\". \"So how do we find out who Sam was working for that night?\" Butch inquired. \"I sent an e-mail to a friend of mine who specializes in back-tracing wire transfers\" said Michael. \"He said it would take some time, but if I could get him Sam's account number, he'd probably be able to trace the money back to the account it came from. In the mean time, I had some of my street sources trace his movements 48 hours prior to that day. It seems that he'dalready made the bomb the week before, and was waiting for the right time\". As this was taking place, on the other side of town, two cats were hunched over a glowing computer screen, their eyes riveted on a small, red dot. \"I think it's stopped moving boss\" said Calico. \"Excellent\" chuckled Mr. Tinkles. \"Now that we know the location of the formula, we can have the ninjas move in and capture it!\" \"Capture what, boss?\" \"THE FORMULA,YOU IDIOT!\" Tinkles yelled, swiping at Calico with his paw. \"Oh, right, that\" Calico muttered. Giving an evil chuckle, Tinkles pressed a red button on the console, watching in satisfaction as the screen lit up. A CLIFFHANGER, HA! What happens to Michael and the others? will they be okay? and what was that red dot anyway? to find out, you'll have to wait until the next post! A HUUUUUGGGGEEE thank you to Robert Plant of Led Zepplin and patient935 for the reviews. I hope you like the way I had Tinkles and Calico come in to the story. Until next time, vburro08 out.[Chapter 3] Greetings fellow fanficcers. vburro08 here with another chapter to Cats and Dogs: Michael's story. In this chapter, we'll find out what happened when Tinkles pressed the button. Also, did he really think it would be that easy? DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN CATS AND DOGS, ONLY MY OC'S. CATS AND DOGS, AND IT'S RELATED CHARACTERS, ARE THE PROPERTY OF WARNER BROTHERS HOME ENTERTAINMENT. Tinkles pressed the red button, an evil chuckle escaping as he watched the screen turn bright red. However, his look of sneering triumph soon turned to one of comical outrage as the words NICE TRY MORON scrolled across the screen. \"WHAT!?\" he yowled. \"WHAT IS THAT SUPPOSED TO MEAN!?\" IT MEANS YOU'VE FAILED JERK! came the reply on-screen. \"How's he doing that, boss?\" \"It doesn't matter how, what matters is that HE FOUND THE BOMB!\" Tinkles yelled. Back at D.O.G. Headquarters, Michael closed his laptop, a satisfied look on his face. \"You look like the cat that ate the canary\" said Butch.\"You mind telling us what's so funny?\" \"Oh, nothing\" Michael replied, trying to look innocent and failing. \"Michael, I know that look\" said Sutton. \"What gives?\" \"Well, I found a small bomb in my bag when we got through fighting the cats in the alley and deactivated it, then I sent a message to the guy who created it, that's all.\" \"Do you know who created the bomb?\" Kowalski asked. Michael shrugged. \"No clue. But I was able to send the message through a wireless transponder the cats had on them\". \"Why would they have one of those on them?\" Kowalski asked. \"It would enable them to communicate with their boss more easily than traditional radioes, plus, if it were discovered, they'd be able to shut it off before the transmission could be traced to the receiver\" Michael answered. Shaking his head, Sutton smiled.\"I'm hoping the message was at least amiable in nature\". \"Now why would I send something that was anything but amiable?\" Michael asked. \"I refuse to answer that question\" Sutton replied in a bemused tone. \"I thought you'd say that\" Michael chuckled. He smiled a moment longer, imagining the reaction of the recipient of his message, whomever it might be, before frowning and returning to the business at hand. \"How about we start with what we know and work our way from there\" Butch suggested. \"Good idea\" Kowalski agreed. Sighing, Michael started from the beginning, leaving nothing out. Other than a question here and there, he wasn't interrupted. When he had finished, it was past 1 a.m. and they were all rubbing their eyes. Seeing this, Sutton suggested that they all get some rest. \"After all\" he said \"We'll think better when we're not so tired\". Michael nodded. \"I agree. We get some rest and return to this deal tomorrow when our heads are clear\". The next morning, Michael was jogging in a local park near town when he saw Butch talking to a large sheepdog. Curious as to what was being said, he moved closer. Looking up from their conversation, Butch saw Michael coming towards them. \"Morning\" he said, as Michael drew nearer. \"Morning yourself\" Michael said, coming to a stop. \"Sam, this is Michael. Michael, Sam.\" \" Any progress on the case so far?\"Michael asked. \"Nothing. You get anything?\" Butch asked. Michael was about to answer in the negative when he heard his start beeping. Pulling it from his pocket, he read the text, smiling. \"What's the news?\" asked Butch. \"Just got the word on the account numbers from the checks. The account was registered to a Calico Tinkles here in California\" Michael said. \"Calico Tinkles? What kind of human has a name like that?\" Butch asked. \"No idea\" Michael said, shrugging. \"Calico?Isn't that some kind of cat?\" Sam asked. \"It is\" Butch answered. \"So we're either looking for a calico cat named Tinkles, or a human who's so crazy about cats they changed their name to match a cat breed\" said Michael. \"Who's to say that it 's not two cats that put their names together to open a bank account?\" Butch speculated. \"Why did you say the account was registered in that name?\" Sam asked. \"Because the day after the bombing, the account was closed. Almost all data on it was erased, and the bank records were wiped clean\" Michael said, frowning. \"However\" he continued \"there was still some residual data left in the computer's mainframe\". \"Still, the fact that whoever did that was able to hack a bank's firewall is a little disturbing\" Butch stated. Michael nodded. \"But at least we know more now than we did yesterday\". Glancing at his watch, Michael frowned. \"I've gotta go fellas. If you find out anything interesting, let me know. I'll do the same with you\". \"You got it\" Butch said. Well, that's it for now. As always, please read and review. Until next time, this is vburro08 signing out.[Chapter 4] Hello again fellow fan fiction afficionados,vburro08 here with the next installment of Michael's story. More action to follow in this chapter, as Michael continues to search for answers. Will they be what he expects? or will some unexpected twists pop up? only way to find out is to keep reading. DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN CATS AND DOGS. CATS AND DOGS AND THE CHARACTERS FROM THE MOVIE ARE THE PROPERTY OF WARNER BROS. HOME ENTERTAINMENT. I ONLY OWN MY OC'S, AND THEY MAY NOT BE USED WITHOUT MY PERMISSION. For the next two months, Michael gave the case every moment he could spare. From questioning street sources, to reviewing camera footage from the night of the explosion, he did anything and everything he could to solve the mystery of Dr. Goldberg's death, and Sam's possible involvement. But it seemed as though every time he was close to a breakthrough, it would turn into nothing, and he was getting frustrated. One afternoon, he went to talk to Butch. \"It feels like I'm staring right at the answers, Butch, but for the life of me, I can't see what they are\" he said one afternoon. \"I know the feeling\" Butch said. \"Be patient, Michael. The answers will come at the right time\". \"I hope so\" Michael said with a sigh. \"They will\" Butch reassured the depressed human. Just then, a car came barreling around the corner. Skidding to a stop, it's hood pointed at the bewildered duo, the car sat in the middle of the road. Sunlight glinting of the windows made it impossible to see who was driving. Suddenly, the driver accelerated, heading straight at Michael and Butch. \"LOOK OUT!\" Michael yelled, shoving Butch out of the way, before jumping clear with inches to spare. His hands swept down for the revolvers he'd started wearing, and the guns came up spewing flame and lead. The rear windshield shattered and a side mirror broke off, but the driver was already too far to see. \"You alright kid?\" Butch asked. \"Just fine\" Michael answered. Feeding fresh cartridges into the empty chambers of his guns, he holstered them and turned to look at Butch. \"Well, now we know we're on the right track\" he stated. \"How?\" Butch asked. \"We didn't get the license number, or even see who the driver was\". \"I didn't need to see the driver, just the car\" Michael said, heading toward home at a jog. \"Why's that?\" Butch was clearly puzzled. \"Because that car belongs to Sam Williams\". \"Your security guard?\" Michael nodded, still jogging.

This is my first fanfic ever, don't know yet if it wil"},{"Movie":"Olympus Has Fallen","Title":"Brothers never die","Author":"sharingstories2","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11957527","Passage":"[Chapter 1] Conner always knew that Mike was brave and heroic but he also knew that came with problems. He was ten when Mike Banning saved his father from a car crash but was unable to save his mother. He wasn't stupid he knew it wasn't Mike's fault but he didn't understand at the time why his mother had to die. Yet again it appeared neither did his father as he requested Mikes transfer. He was twelve when his home and country came under attack. He was twelve when Mike Banning pretty much single handily saved the white house, his father and Conner himself. After that Banning was once again the head of his Fathers safety. Everything would be fine with Mike Banning by their side. For the next three years Mike became a close friend to the Presidential family, his job came first mind you but out of all the agents he was the closest to the president and his son. Mike joined Ben in teasing Conner when he hit puberty and got his first girlfriend, or when Conner got into a spat with his father. Throughout some of Conner's hardest years Mike was there. So yes Conner knew the problems that came with knowing one Mike Banning. Yet despite knowing this he never thought he would see the day where he saw Mike Banning die. The day started off normally or as normally as it could being the President's son and all. Conner got up, argued with the secret service that no, his cereal was not poisoned and got changed. He spent the day doing homework and later got changed into a tux, getting ready for the date with his girlfriend. His father came in to his room and smiled. \"You look so grown up!\" he said. Conner smiled, he knew his father had to pull strings to let him have this date with only a handful of agents. \"Thanks dad\" the president pulled him into a hug. \"Your mum would be proud with you \"pulling back Asher wiped a tear. \"Now there are only twenty agents so you should be safe and Mike will never be more than a few seconds away. If you need him just yell and he will come running okay?\" Conner nodded. \"Come on dad I'll be completely safe, you know Mike and the others would die before anything would happen to me or Charlotte\" President Asher nodded. \"Okay, come on in Mike\" the agent in question came in and ran over the security detail on Conner and his girlfriend when a shout of \"Red Hearts\" came through the radio. Mike grinned \"Well I guess it's time to woe your girlfriend.\" Charlotte herself was impressed that her dear boyfriend had managed to call off the armed search and had hugged him. \"Hey Con\" Conner smiled \"Hey Charlotte\" they stared at each other as Ben coughed. Both teen looked down blushing. \"Hello again Charlotte\" The girl smiled \"Hello Mr President\" Mike laughed at the two of them \"Charlotte, I don't know if you remember me-\" \"Your Mike Banning, the head of the security detail\" Mike smiled shook the teens hand \"That is correct. I am in charge or Conner's protection tonight but I just want you to know, we will respect that you are both teens and this is a date. We are only there to prevent hurt coming to both yourself and Conner.\" The girl smiled and nodded. Mike turned to the president. \"We will be leaving now Mr President I have left Paul in charge of your safety tonight and rest assured I will keep your son safe.\" Ben Asher nodded and everyone moved out. The date that Conner had set up was a picnic (and yes he made most of the food himself) and a walk through the gardens. He was impressed that Mike had said yes, it had taken a while but after he had done surveillance Mike had said that he knew no one would be here or they would at least be told to go the other way. . \"You know you didn't have to go through all this trouble, I would have been fine doing something that would have been approved right away.\" Conner laughed \"I like you a lot and I don't want you to be confined by my father's job, besides Mike wouldn't let us do this if it wasn't safe. He wouldn't risk his job.\" Charlotte laughed, her blonde hair fell across her face making her look innocent. \"I've seen the way you two act, this isn't a job to him, sure he's going to protect you to the best of his ability but you are much more than just an assignment. You are his brother Con, he wouldn't let you do this when it's obvious that it's a lot less secure if he didn't think of you that way.\" Hidden behind a tree Mike laughed at the two who were now chasing each other and playing something that looked like tag. He remembered being young once and was glad that Conner was being youthful for once. His laugh attracted another agent. \"It great isn't it that our jobs can ensure the happiness of others\" he said \"Yeah it is\" the other agent was about to reply when someone shouted through the radio. \"INCOMING FIRE, I REPEAT INCOMING FIRE\" Mike jumped up and ran towards Conner and Charlotte. \"GET DOWN\" he screamed at the moment that heavy fire rained down on the couple and the agent. Mike wasted no time in grabbing the both of them and taking them to cover, only for a bullet to pierce the side of his Kevlar and knock him down to the ground, he grunted and turned the teens. \"You two need to get out of here, take my radio and run to the safe point\" Conner stared at him before kneeling down beside him. \"We're not leaving you\" he said, he face reflected his stubbornness. Charlotte knelt down beside Conner and Mike. \"Conner, I need you to take your shirt off, we need to stem the bleeding\" Mike stared at her \"Sorry kid but your crash course in the ER won't save me\" as he said this, he grabbed a knife and launched it at an oncoming figure. \"You two need to go\" Conner shook his head \"You're one of us' remember that?\" he asked, pulling out his very own secret service badge. \"I'm not leaving\" he repeated. The ceasefire outside was mute to Conner who was sobbing into Charlottes shoulder. Mike pulled Conner closer, his body felt on fire with every touch. \"I love you kid, you and… and y-your f-father are my Brothers\" Conner shook his head \"Don't say that, don't act like you're gonna die!\" Mike smiled grimly \"Just… just promise you'll tell Leah… tell her I loved her and that it was painless\" Conner nodded and sobbed harder. Mike turned to Charlotte who looked at him helplessly. She liked Mike he was the only one that welcomed her, she knew she would always be a security risk, she was an outsider but Mike was always friendly and stopped everyone from searching her for guns or something. \"You take care of him you hear? He's a great kid Charlotte\" \"I know, I will\" and then with one last push of effort Mike saluted and closed his eyes. Conner banged Mike's chest and screamed for him to wake up, he only stopped when Charlotte laid a hand on his shoulder. \"He's gone Conner, he's gone\" and then Conner collapsed in her arms. He stayed there until the others found him, he stayed with her as they saluted the man that had been through hell with him. He only parted from Charlotte when his father arrived at the hospital with Leah. With her child. He knew it wasn't the best time but he did it anyway, he walked over to the woman and hugged her. \"His last words to me where to tell you that he loved you and your child\" Leah nodded and hugged Conner tighter. When the funeral came Conner stood at the podium and looked over the crowd. The entirety of Mike's family was there, along with the president and Charlotte who smiled at Conner glumly. \"Mike Banning was one of the most selfless people I have met, he was as you know the head of my father's detail but he was much more than that. He was a comrade, and friend, a husband and father. Mike Banning was one of my closest friends and it won't just be his heroic acts that I shall remember him by. It shall be the way he would tease me mercilessly over my relationship or how he would make me hot chocolate just because he thought I was upset, or how he would wake me up at the crack of dawn because 'Conner you haven't ran all week and that ends now'. I shall remember Mike not as another person who was just there but as a man who was my brother.\" He saluted \"To Mike Banning the greatest man I knew\" there were tears as everyone reciprocated. Conner turned to Mike's coffin and let alone tear roll down his face. Conner never thought he would see the day that Mike Banning fell because to him Mike was his brother and Brothers never fell.[Chapter 2] Dear readers.

Rating: T Author's Note: I saw the movie the other day and couldn't resist. I like Aaron Eckhart. Not much fan fiction here. I decided to contribute. (Title change from 'The Tutor'.) E. Pluribus Unum Chapter I A fist flew through the air followed by a strong upper cut that impacted soundly into bruised muscles. There was a gasp of agony. The sound of a man hurt but slowly recovering from the assault. Slinking back the man quickly regrouped, boxing gloves up and coated with the sheen sweat of his adversary. The man struck out…a strong jab… sadly missing his opponent. The phantom punch connecting with wind not a face. Mike Banning watched with intense curiosity as Asher geared up for another attack. His eyes were squinted and his face scrunched in fierce determination. He read him easily. He dodged a third blow to his face. Another to his kidney. Asher was out of practice and poorly out of shape. The man was soaked like a wet beach towel and he was dragging in air like patient on life support. Banning twisted his lips in disappointment. There was no challenge here. Not like it had been. Once there was a time when Asher could meet Banning blow for blow. Punch for punch. Some matches ended in a draw and with the two men laughing and patting each other on the back. Knocking back cold beers as they recounted the sparring match. It was ridiculously simple now. He effortlessly picked apart Asher's aggressive tactics landing a punch to the face and one the lower left quadrant of his abdomen. Asher let out a pained grunt and Banning came to a screeching halt. He watched Asher swing his arm to protectively cradle his stomach. A pinch of blood staining his white t-shirt. Banning munched at one glove with his mouth, pulling it off he walked over to his friend. \"Why'd you stop?\" Asher panted out, glancing up at him in question. \"How bad is it?\" Asher shook his head, mouth thinning into a tight line. \"It's nothing.\" \"I think you may have ruptured your wound.\" \"Don't worry about it?\" Banning reached out with his naked hand, but Asher evaded him. \"Ben, it's my job to worry. I got it pounded into me at the academy.\" He lightly smacked at Asher's arm, knocking it away. \"Let me see.\" He peeled the sweat damp shirt up, exposing the stomach, inspecting the damage. His brain worked as memories suddenly compiled. A day of mayhem. Of infamy. A day in Hell. Asher had suffered a gunshot wound. It had gone through cleanly but the effect was so terrifying he'd gone immediately into a thing like death. In all the intensity, madness, and heart racing anger Banning thought he'd lost him. His efforts all for naught. It was only after he decoded Cerberus that he felt a heavy hand on his shoulder. He spun round ready to strike but came into eye contact with a friend. Banning examined injury. It was circular, almost in the form of a severe car cigarette lighter burn. It had crusted into a purplish black welt but a sliver of blood was now oozing from underneath the scar. The surrounding skin was a deeper shade of red fading out to a somber hue of feverish pink. \"You've erupted the scab, it's not too bad. We'll have Dr. Johnson take a look at it.\" Asher grimaced pulling his shirt down. \"No, don't bother calling him. I'll just put some peroxide on it and it will be fine.\" Bowing the rope to the box ring, he climbed down, and started ripping his boxing gloves off. \"Ben, you know its protocol. I have to report this. Every nick and every scratch you get has to be reported and then documented in your medical chart. You know this.\" \"God damn it Mike I said I'm fine! I'm not a damn china doll that going to shatter into a million pieces.\" Asher chucked his boxing gloves to one side. They bounced off the wall and slid to the floor in a heap. He glared. \"You're still pulling your punches.\" \"I was just trying to ease you back into it Ben,\" replied Banning. \"I don't need to be eased into anything. I almost died two months ago. I think I can handle anything life throws at me, including a punch from you.\" Mike flashed a smug grin, folding his powerfully muscled arms over his chest. \"Oh, you think so.\" \"I know so,\" Asher laughed. \"Let me wash up and then we'll grab some breakfast.\" He reached over and plucked a towel from the bench and made his way to small bathroom. His short jaunt was detoured by the appearance of secret service agent. \"Hey Randy, how's it going?\" asked Asher. \"Quite well, Mr. President, sir.\" Randy, Randolph David O'Bryan, was a lean, strapping red-hair man with bright green eyes full lips and a charismatic smile. His high color and cheeks lightly dusted with freckles suggested a strong genetic tie to the old country. He nodded towards Mike, his eyes taking on a gleam of reverence and respect. A sudden awe at being in the presence of the country's greatest hero. Mike's face took on a disheartened frown. He was getting tired of it all. Tired of the glamor and fame rescuing the President had commended him. He was no hero. He was just a man. A man well trained who happened to be in the right place at the right time. And thanks to the media splashing his image on virtually every magazine in the entire world…he could never go undercover. \"Randy,\" Mike shrugged into a thick dark blue hoodie. With his heart beat slowing down, the room was becoming uncomfortably chilly. \"Is Martha keeping those biscuits for us?\" \"Warm and buttery,\" he replied. \"Just as you like it sir.\" \"Don't sir me. I'm not the one in charge,\" said Banning. \"But I am,\" Asher approached Randy, a towel roped around his neck. He checked his wristwatch. \"8:30. It's a bit early. I didn't think I needed a security detail to go to the bathroom.\" \"I'm sorry sir, but Vance just received a call from Headmaster Anderson. It's your son, Connor, he was in another fight.\" ()()()() Established in 1809, St. Michaels School for boys was funded and its land bequeathed by Eleanor Watson, a wealthy socialite who later died with issue. The house itself was a magnificent design of masonry and post Medieval architecture resting on 12 acres of rich, spacious land. With rich history tying it the Presidency and deep fundamental religious ethics, St. Michaels was the perfect place for Connor to blossom not only academically, but morally as a human being. At least, that was how Margaret always factored it. Honestly, the whole idea of Connor entering a private school, especially one with faith based principles left Asher somewhat ill. But that was before the accident. And before he witnessed the destruction of one the most secure buildings in the world and the death of hundreds of brave and noble men. After the horrifying ordeal, Asher prayed for the first time in his life. Prayed for a new beginning for his country and his son. But soon the boy began to act out. Violently. Fistfights. Snide remarks to his teachers. His grades had plummeted. He sought out a Child Psychiatrist for his son. Told him he thought about pulling Connor out of school. Just for a little while. Perhaps scraping together some close quality time with his son would mend their bond and ease the pain inflicted in the last two years. The doctor informed him it was a bad idea. That the nurturing wisdom and spiritual guidance of St. Michaels was the best place for his son to be. All would be will he stated. Except all was not well. Connor was not well. \"8:30. A new record.\" Mike swiveled in his seat at the front of the limo. A monster of a vehicle surrounded by a convoy of heavily armed guards, agents, and D.C. officers. \"Sorry, sir?\" \"Nothing,\" the President sighed. Asher let his eyes drop from the scenic route blurring pass his window. At 10:45 EST the Presidential motorcade departed the Dumbarton House to make the journey to St. Michaels. On the way he caught a glimpse of the White House. Construction workers. Crane lifts. Dump trucks littered the front lawn. Endless neon signs and police officers were stationed out front. Some directed traffic while others blocked bystanders and hot shot paparazzi from taking pictures. \"She looks good,\" said Mike. Asher nodded his head in agreement. \"Yes she does,\" he said softly. \"How many more months before we can return?\" \"The foreman hopes to be done by New Year's but,\" Banning hesitated. \"There was a lot of structural damage and…and a lot of flowers.\" \"I know,\" Asher returned his gaze to the dizzying world going by. \"I know.\" He remembered it being a rainy afternoon in Washington D.C. when dozens of families upon thousands of people came to place flowers on the front lawn. It was impossible to light candles as the day wore into the night. Yet there were flowers such as he had never seen. It took the cleanup crew a good week to carefully gather up all the withered arrangements once construction commenced. At the same time, Asher and his entire administration was packed up and relocated to the Dumbarton House. He could only chuckle inwardly at the irony the day the motorcade stopped in front of the Federal style house. History recalled Dolley Madison, the First Lady, having to flee to this particular place when the British invaded in 1814. \"How's the monument coming along?\" \"It's almost complete sir. They'll put the marble in once the White House is finished.\" \"Good. I'm glad to hear that. It's probably my first and last piece of good news for the day.\" Banning heard the meaning in Asher's tone and studied the President for a moment. \"It's probably nothing sir.\" \"Probably? Are you sure about that?\" Asher slanted his gaze. \"Connor… 'Sparkplug'… he's a good kid.\" \"Who's taken a keen interest in practicing MMA moves on his fellow students?\" \"I didn't teach him any of that,\" Mike coughed, tugging at his tie which had grown rather tight around his neck. Asher snorted. \"You didn't have to. With YouTube… the internet… there's a beehive of information just at his fingertips.\" He sighed reclining his head against the soft leather. \"You all right sir?\" \"Yeah,\" Asher slowly closed his eyes in an attempt to catch up on some sleep. \"Wake me when we arrive Mike.\" \"Will do sir.\" ()()()() President Benjamin Asher counted over forty anxious faces pressed against windows the instant his limo pulled to the main doors of St. Michaels. Another ten students stood gaping in shocked disbelief by the water fountain. \"They act as though they'd never seen you here before sir,\" Mike said, moving to the head of a diamond position. Since the attack security had been elevated and executed with extreme prejudice. \"They haven't,\" replied Asher. \"This is the second time I've been here. Margaret was always the one…\" He cleared his throat at the memory of his dearly departed wife. Although the sorrow and anguish had abated, the sting of remembering had not gone away; maybe it never will. He noticed the tension rise in Mike's shoulder and acknowledge the guilt and burden he still carried. It had been his call. And Margaret died. The sane part of his brain believed the special agent had made the right choice but his heart…now and again…still condemned him. Especially on nights when he was lonely and his bedroom was all too quiet. Their friendship was far from what it used to be yet since that horrific day it was on the rebound. \"Mr. President, my god this is an honor,\" came a short stubby man with receding hair, a fat face and round black rimmed glasses. He introduced himself as Wendell Simmons, one of the administrators at St. Michaels. \"I am sorry we have to meet under these circumstance and my condolences regarding your wife, Margaret Asher. She was a fine lady and…\" \"Where is my son?\" Asher demanded cutting through the horseshit. He stared down angrily at the now trembling Simmons. Adjusting his glasses, Simmons cleared his throat. \"Yes sir, right this way.\" He swung around in his markdown shoes to lead the group to Headmaster Anderson's office. They marched down the hall, footsteps in unison. \"Beside me ace,\" Mike barked in annoyance, knocking the little man to the side. He meant no disrespect but he needed his line of vision clear at all times. A full 180 degrees. \"Yes…my apologizes…\" he narrowed his gaze; recognition coming to view. \"My word, are you not…?\" \"Armed and dangerous,\" Mike barked, his expression one of grim reservation. One or two agents stifled a laughed as Simmons swallowed and fiddled with his glasses. Skipping ahead he led them soundlessly to a spacious chamber fitted more into a private study rather than a waiting room. Entreating the President to wait, and going up toward an impressive wall made of mahogany, Simmons knocked and spread the double doors wide at the sound of a beckoning voice. \"Headmaster Anderson,\" he announced in all grandeur. \"The President of the United States.\" Asher entered with Mike alone following him, guarding, watching him like a hawk. Several steps inside Asher froze at the sight of his son Connor seated in front of an antique cherry wood desk. He looked mauled but definitely not beaten. His dirty blond hair was unruly; bits of leaves and twigs stuck out of the strands. The right sleeve of his blue blazer was torn at the seams. Dirt and debris dusted the whole of his clothes. His bottom was split and the skin of his face was flushed red. \"Connor…I thought…\" \"Please take a seat Mr. President,\" Headmaster Anderson interrupted and with a gnarled left hand indicated for the Asher to take the seat next to his son. He was an elderly man of seventy, beady grey eyes, a beak shape nose with a permanently endowed frown at the corners of his mouth. His hair was all but gone except for the few strands which were tapered and well groomed at the back of his skull. And unlike Simmons, he never had need of glasses, surprising for a man of advanced years. \"Let me start by addressing that in all my years at Saint Michaels, I have never seen such behavior displayed. It is true we have the everyday ragamuffins conjuring pranks on each other and the teachers, but such open show of brutality…\" His gaze pinned Connor before traveling to the President. Asher shifted uncomfortably in his chair, feeling as though he was back in the fourth grade facing Amanda Wheeler, the school principle. \"What happened?\" He asked cutting the onslaught and glancing down at his son. \"Ricky, just wouldn't stop picking on me,\" grumbled Connor. \"Yes,\" Anderson warbled. \"The Harrington boy. Master Davis informed me the boy had been molesting Connor quite frequently.\" Asher railed, \"You knew this kid was bullying my son and you did nothing about it.\" Headmaster Anderson straightened in his chair and his eyes came close together. Benjamin Asher may be President of the United States but he was not about to let the man intimidate him. \"His parents have been notified about his conduct and he will be punished accordingly. Nevertheless, your son's behavior in the last few short months have taken a downward spiral. Outbursts, incomplete assignments, and total lack of respect for authority.\" Anderson held up his hands. \"I understand the loss of his mother, the recent tragedies, has had a traumatic affect Mr. President, but your son cannot continue walk around with a chip on his shoulder. There is code of conduct here that we follow to the letter.\" \"I understand Mr. Anderson and I promise you,\" Asher assured. \"This will never happen again.\" \"I would like to believe that.\" \"You will. He WILL change.\" He looked at his son hard and was irritated to see the boy was hardly fazed by the conversation. He was slouched in the chair, staring dazedly out the window. Asher knocked the back of his hand into Connor's arm. \"RIGHT! This will never happen again.\" Connor sighed, rolling his eyes. \"Right.\" \"You're sorry,\" Asher stressed through gritted teeth. \"I'm sorry.\" Like a subservient altar boy, his son bowed his head, thrusting his bottom lip up in a pout. \"'Repentance is not so much remorse for what we have done as the fear of the consequences.' And there are consequences Young Master Asher. A three weeks suspension effective immediately and the completion of assignments you have failed to hand into your teachers.\" \"What?\" Connor jumped in his seat and looked at his dad pleadingly. \"Isn't that a little harsh?\" \"If I had my will Mr. President the boy would be expelled but that would be bad for Saint Michaels and bad for you.\" Anderson said coolly. Asher sank back into his chair in a dawning realization. \"Oh, I see.\" He did see. Was it always politics? \"No. You do not. You are lucky Richard Harrington's parents are not pressing charges.\" Anderson rose with some difficulty but eventually got to his feet. \"Now if we are all finished here I have duties I must attend too.\"[Chapter 2] Summary: Two months after the attacks in Washington, Asher tries to piece the country, his life and what's left of his family together. Rating: T Author's Note: I saw the movie the other day and couldn't resist. I like Aaron Eckhart. Not much fan fiction here. I decided to contribute. (Title change from 'The Tutor'.) E. Pluribus Unum Chapter II The weather was changing and not for the better. The sharp spike of pain rushing up Danielle Mason's right leg was proof she was in for another long and crippling winter. Fingers clenching the bedding from the intense discomfort, she reached immediately reached for salvation. The bottle of Vicodin HP sitting on the night stand on top of Dan Brown's newest thriller… Inferno . Doctor prescribed one pill be taken every 4-6 hours. Danielle popped in three. She needed a strong kick to her leg muscles this morning. If not she wouldn't make it pass noon. At that hour, as if on a timer, pain reared its ugly head and she would be hobbling like Igor. Earnest to do his master's bidding. The car accident had taken its toll and three years of her life. Three years of agony and anxiety. Three years of surgery and intense physical therapy that brought sweat and tears to her eyes. And it had taken another year to walk with some measure of grace. Danielle grimly remembered the first evening she dared take a step beyond the safe reach of her walking stick. It was at Gary and Mary's wedding anniversary and for all her grief the couple lived in a turn of the century white stone mansion. The mansion had a grand staircase. Grand and spiral. \"Heaven's Ladder,\" Mary said with a beam of luster glowing in her eyes as she admired the flawless marble. Flawless revealed its true nature when the strength in her right leg gave out while trying to climb up pass the third landing to the reception on the roof. Right in front of everyone, Danielle toppled three steps, bruising her bottom as well as her pride. Utterly embarrassed, after three glasses of wine, she made excuses and took an early exit. A regret she come to face for Mary had made the announcement that night that she was going to have a baby. It had hurt to miss the announcement, but not as much as the brutal chill cutting into already aching muscles provoked by the fall. Now winter was here again and the thought made the muscles ache down to the bone. With a grunt she pushed the downy quilt forward. Battling the pain dead on, inhaling deeply, she came to a sit, swinging her legs over to the side of the bed. The muscles in her bad leg throbbed. She bit her bottom lip. A second felt like an eternity as she sat there waiting for the pain to abate. When it did, she hobbled to her feet, clutching the chair she ritually sat two feet from the bed to catch her balance. Counting ten second, she collected her strength, throwing her head back to the right to pop the kink in her neck. Reluctantly, she took her walking stick (an antique gold head finish that once belonged to her grandfather) she limped to the bathroom…showered…though it took some time. One hour and a cup of coffee and an onion bagel later she was bundling into Gucci coat bought at an amazing discount at one of their couture stores. Okay, so it wasn't on a discount rather than the store clearing out last season's undesirables. And it didn't hurt she had a doctorate in Child Psychology, ensuring a semi-sizable bank account. Keys and walking stick in hand she left her small, but comfy condo. Outside nature was undergoing a glorious transformation as the leaves of oak and elms trees standing like quiet sentinels along the sidewalk changed from a rich green to a multiple array of colors. Vibrant reds. Brilliant Oranges. Soft Yellows. It was for this turn in season she remained in the north; remained in Washington D.C. and battled the cold. Dealt with the aches and pains that made walking difficult. Call her foolish but Danielle simply loved watching the change in season ever since she was a little girl. It was a nice change. Quickly scrambling for her keys, the cold biting in her leg, she got into a black Lexus SUV. She checked to make sure she had her briefcase. A leather Samsonite flap over. The previous day she'd forgotten it along with all her notes and files of each of her patients. But she had been distracted. Mary had phoned her early in morning completely in hysterics. Something about Gary not coming home after an argument about Nick their son. Gary had scolded her for being too smothering. Complained how she constantly picked up their son whenever the 18 month old cried. 'The boy needs to toughen up,' he'd said. She told him he was being ridiculous, Nick was still a baby. The scream fest had escalated until Nick started crying. Mary went to fetch him. Gary obstructed her path. It was then the truth of how she was neglecting him as his needs came out. Mary said something that sparked his immediate departure. Tearful she'd called Danielle. As much as she loved her friends, she was a child psychiatrist not a marriage counselor. She wasn't trained for these little dramas nor did she want to get involved. It was the worst thing any friend could do especially since she wasn't married. Danielle did her best to calm marry down and promised the pair would meet for lunch and talk. Grateful, Mary ended the call, only to leave Danielle in a tizzy as she fool around her condo snatching up purse and keys; leaving her briefcase behind. \"Yep, it's there,\" she said to herself after a quick glimpse in the back seat. Switching on the car, revving the engine, and pulling away from the curb. Taking the US 1 alternate, she drove deep into the very heart of Washington D.C. Her office was in a building that was right smack on Pennsylvania Avenue where several prominent buildings were located in the area. Most mornings it would take her twenty minutes to reach the building. However, since the 4th of July, traffic was backed up. There were check points at every turn. Several roads were closed. Police officers and soldiers were on point. It was a certifiable nightmare. Then again, so was that day. She parked in the public parking at the handicapped spot. Was given a red ticket and a look of suspicion by the one of the security guards. Smiling kindly, she took her ticket, and left while working hard to stifle her temper. She wanted to be offended but she couldn't. After what happened no one was above questioning. At a glimpse to her watch Danielle saw that it was a quarter to nine and with difficulty quickened her steps, gripping her walking stick as she entered the lobby of the building. It wasn't odd to find it jammed with people in line waiting for the elevators. Local security were scanning badges and x-raying personal effects. \"For Christ sake's we were here yesterday assholes,\" a guy muttered behind her. Danielle looked over her shoulder and smiled tightly. Harry Mills was a lawyer for a law firm below her floor. \"It's the price we pay for freedom Harry.\" \"What freedom?\" he snorted with derision. \"Blame Asher for the Disneyland lines we have to endure every day. If he was half the President I thought he was we wouldn't be in this nightmare in the first place.\" Danielle cut her eyes sharply at him, her soft lips pressing together tightly. \"If I were you Harry,\" she lowered her voice. \"I wouldn't talk too much shit about Asher. Not at this time. Not when they have mean looking ball-busting Marines standing right over there.\" She gestured with her eyes at the two men decked in battle hardened gear with machine guns locked and loaded and gripped tightly in their hands. Coiling like a worm on a hook, Harry shrank into himself lowering his eyes to the floor, his face paling white. A light bead of sweat pebbled his brow inciting a satisfied grin on Danielle's face. 'All talk and no action,' she thought taking a step forward as the line progressed. Ten minutes later she arrived—finally—on the 22nd floor greeting familiar faces in her sluggish journey to her office. To her surprise there were two very distinct men dressed in dark tailored suits standing like sentinels just outside her door. They stood eyes front with dour expressions on their faces. Tentatively, she slowed her pace, the rhythm of her heart increasing as assumptions roamed in her brain. Sensing her presence their gazed snapped to her like the crack of a whip. \"Dr. Danielle Mason?\" one of them spoke with such resounding authority that the pit of her stomach tightened. Her throat caught momentarily and she coughed to clear it. \"Yes?\" \"May I see some identification?\" \"Of course,\" she fumbled inside her purse and retrieved her driver's license. \"Is there a problem?\" \"No problem,\" the man took it and examined it closely, feeling the edges to if it had been tampered with. He then lifted his wrist and spoke into the receiver. \"It's her. We have a green light.\" Rotating, the men stepped two feet from the door. He handed back her license. \"You can go in.\" 'I have to ask permission to enter my damn office,' she thought grimly. Limping in to the small waiting area, Danielle encountered other men in suits, and a very panicky Ann sitting at her reception desk. \"Ann,\" Danielle frowned. \"What the hell is this? Where is Mrs. Harker and Bobby?\" \"We asked Miss Taylor to cancel all of your morning appointments Dr. Mason.\" Danielle turned and was immediately floored. Special agent Mike Banning stood before her strong, intimidating. The country's hero was standing right in her waiting room. It didn't take a genius to figure out who was in her main office. Her pulse quickened and she fumbled with her bag and her briefcase. \"I'll—I'll take those Dr. Mason,\" Ann skipped to her feet, gathering the bags and coat into her arms. Mike swung sharply and led Danielle into her office. It was a spacious and warm environment designed to induce a feeling of home and well-being in her young patients. There were even toys and an artwork station set up in the far left corner to allow for expression and divulging of inner emotions. \"Give us a moment will you Mike.\" Danielle followed the voice to a lone figure standing in front a ceiling high window. Her stomach twisted and her heart fluttered against her ribcage. The leader of the free world was in her office. \"Holler if you need me.\" Asher twisted around and outside light coming through the window darkened him somewhat. There was a comical look on face as he stared a Danielle and a light chuckled rolled in his throat. \"Oh, I doubt she'll do me any harm.\" \"Never underestimate your opponent, Mr. President,\" Danielle stated rather stiffly. \"And never take what they offer you.\" A gleam hitched Mike's right eyebrow and he had to bite the inside of his cheek to keep from laughing. He ducked out the room, closing the solid polished oak behind him. For several minutes Danielle and Asher stared at each other. Gauging. Seizing up other. \"You weren't announced.\" Danielle said. \"Technically, I'm not here,\" Asher replied and looked her up and down again. \"You look good Dani. I like what you've done with your hair.\" \"Cut the crap Ben,\" she snorted, rolling her eyes, squeezing the head of her walking stick. \"I look like hell.\" \"How long has it been? Eight years?\" \"Ten,\" she corrected. Asher looked baffled. \"God! Has it been that long?\" \"What do you want Ben?\" she demanded cutting through the horseshit and false pleasantries. \"Same ol' Dani,\" he snickered stepping casually towards her. \"You haven't changed a bit?\" \"It's good to know one of us hasn't,\" she replied and felt a small amount of pleasure at the way Asher's face dropped like stone. There was a clear meaning in her words. One that proclaimed that all was not forgiven. \"You're still angry with me,\" he said softly. \"No. Just annoyed,\" she moved to her desk, far more easily now. The Vicodin had kicked in relaxing away the ache that would normally be killing her from standing up so long. \"I had appointments and you felt the need to break them.\" She glared at him almost viciously. \"Tell me why? And then you can leave.\" \"I need your help Dani.\" His face was pleading. \"I need your help with Connor. He's—Christ I don't know. Ever since hell had broken loose he hasn't been the same. Fighting in school. His grades are dropping. He lashes out at everyone including Mike and he used to adore the guy. I don't know what to do.\" \"Have you taken him to see a specialist?\" \"The best but…\" Asher's shoulders slump in defeat. \"They're not helping. One schmuck says to do this another suggest we go a holiday. We went to beach just like I promised but it hasn't helped. He's retreating I know he is. Doesn't ever care to go up to his mother's gravesite anymore. This shit that went down at the White House…it broke him.\" \"So now you expect me to pick up the pieces,\" Danielle said somewhat bothered by Ben's notion that he can just breeze into her life after so many years. \"I'm not expecting anything Dani. I was hoping you could see him…just once a week…no pressure. Please. I want my son back.\" \"Why me?\" \"Because…I know you…and I trust you. I don't really trust these guys. These assholes just want the prestige of seeing the President's son. For now they have to be quiet but I know that once I'm out of office they'll write a book about Connor.\" \"And violate patient confidentially…lose their license.\" \"Not if they retire.\" Irritated, Danielle looked away. \"Ben, this is highly irregular. I haven't seen you since you cut me out your life and suddenly you want me to put what's left of your world back together.\" \"I didn't cut you of my life,\" he disputed, his temper rising. \"No. You chose money and power over love and simplicity.\" \"I saw an opportunity and I took it.\" Her lovely face twisted mockingly. \"Of course. It's hard to run a campaign on a modest budget. Maggie…her family money…connections secured all the finances.\" \"I didn't marry Maggie because she was rich.\" \"Then why did you marry her?\" she inquired staring deeply into his eyes. She'd forgotten how beautiful they were and how the swirling pools of blue made her weak in the knees. A moment of hesitation flashed across his face and she scoffed. \"You can't even answer.\" \"I loved her,\" he eventually said. \"But not the way you loved me,\" she gazed at him critically. \"Don't worry I understand. I wouldn't have made a model First Lady.\" Her eyes dropped to the surface of her desk as an anguish she thought had long been buried surfaced. \"You wouldn't have won with a sistah on your arm.\" Asher balked his mouth popping open like a cod fish. His brow wrinkled as he scowled. \"That's not true. I never took the fact that you're black into consideration the whole entirety of our relationship. And even when we decided to call it quits.\" \"But the country might have. Although American's speak of progress and forward thinking, we both know they're not ready to see an interracial First Couple. It's all facts and figures Ben and getting the right amount of votes.\" \"This isn't about us Dani, this is about Connor.\" He strode toward her desk, hands shoved deep in his pockets. Week kneed, Danielle braced a hand on the table. God, how he looked handsome. In fact, he looked even better now than back when they were dating in college. \"Will you help me?\" It was tempting. So great a temptation Danielle could almost taste it. This was a monumental career move most people would kill for. She could name three colleagues who'd jump at the chance to personally supervise Connor Asher's recuperation. Not to mention the social and political connections. But Danielle wasn't them. She had no desires for glory and prestige. She achieved all of her goals. All she wanted now was a quiet, mainstream life. \"I'm sorry Ben,\" she apologized, \"but I can't.\" Asher frowned. \"Why?\" Exhaling, she shook her head. \"Because I don't need the press picking through my personal life, that's why?\" \"It would be strictly confidential. You can see my son one a week. I'll arrange everything. No one will be the wiser.\" \"I—I'm sorry. The answer is still no.\" \"Why?\" \"Because I have numerous patients to attend to. It's unfair to make your son a priority when I have invested so much time with them.\" \"Look, if this has something to do with us—\" Danielle scoffed. \"This is nothing to do with us Ben! And if it was would I still be talking to you. I would've asked you to leave the second I laid eyes on you.\" She settled into the cushioned chair behind her desk and commenced opening files. \"Now, I have some patients to attend to. Hopefully you haven't canceled the rest of my day.\" By her tone, Asher understood, and took his cue to leave. Just as his hand rested on the door knob, he heard her voice all to him. \"Ben.\" He paused turning slightly. \"I'm sorry about Maggie. Truly I am.\" \"Thanks,\" he said quietly and left.

I was just wondering if you would...\" he blushed a little bit and he looked away, shy. \"If I would what, Diggs?\" Catherine asked. \"If... you would like to, um...\" \"What is it, Diggs?\" Catherine asked, getting a little anxious. \"Uh, you know what? I'll talk to you at lunchtime, okay? Bye,\" said Diggs and he took off. Catherine was wondering what Diggs wanted to say to her, but she had to wait until lunchtime. Later, it was lunchtime. All the agents at D.O.G. HQ all sat down at a large table eating their lunch, which were in their paper sacks. Diggs was eating his lunch, then Catherine comes in with her lunch bag and sets it down, and then she takes a seat next to Diggs. \"Hey, Diggs,\" the female cat said to the German Shepherd.

Just spit it out.\" \"...If you would like to share your lunch with mine.\" Catherine was flattered by this and she said, \"Okay. Here you go,\" as she gave him a little of her own lunch. \"Thank you,\" Diggs smiled and he ate some of her lunch as well as his own. But what Diggs really wanted to ask Catherine was if she would like to go out with him. Will he ever say it? What will Catherine think of it? Stay tuned for the next chapter![Chapter 2] Lunchtime was over. Lou then came out from the corner and said, \"Diggs! Into my office, immediately!\" Diggs turned and ran into Lou's office as he was told. \"What is it, Lou?\" Diggs asked. \"I just got an urgent message from Mr. Tinkles!\" \"Oh, no! Not that cat again!\" Diggs said. \"And he's escaped from Alcatraz Island!\" Diggs gasped and said, \"Well let's see the video!\" Lou pressed a button that activated a big screen that went in front of them. Then Lou turned it on and the screen showed Mr. Tinkles talking through a video camera at the beach. \"Hello there, fellas! This is Mr. Tinkles speaking! What I am about to say will be bad for you all! I have now escaped from prison! And I am coming there to get you once and for all! Mwahahahahahahaha... *cough cough cough*\" \"Aah! Boss! I got sunburned! Help, please! Get the lotion!\" Calico was heard. Tinkles sighed and said, \"Now... ahem. Tinkles, over and out!\" the cat said as he turned the camera off and the big screen went away. \"Man! He sure is crazy!\" Diggs said. \"And we've gotta stop him before he gets to us!\" Lou said. \"No worries, Lou! I'll go get the others right now!\" Diggs said, running out of the office. He first saw Catherine not too far away and ran up to her. \"Catherine! Catherine!\" Diggs said, out of breath. \"What is it, Diggs?\" Catherine asked. \"I've got bad news for you!\" Diggs exclaimed. \"Mr. Tinkles has broken out of jail and he's on his way to exterminate us all! For good, this time!\" Catherine gasped, \"Oh, my! We've gotta do something!\" \"Yeah! Let's go find Butch and Seamus! Then we'll be on our way!\" Diggs said and the both of them ran to find Butch and Seamus.[Chapter 3] It was the exact same day at D.O.G. HQ. Diggs and Catherine finally found Butch and Seamus. \"Butch! Butch! Seamus!\" cried Diggs and Catherine. \"Whoa, whoa! Hey, hey! Calm down, you two!\" Butch commanded. \"Now what is it that you want and why are you in a hurry?\" \"I... I just saw a message by Mr. Tinkles in Lou's office! He said he was coming back for us and was planning to exterminate us!\" said Diggs, trying to catch this breath. \"Yeah, and also, he escaped from prison!\" Catherine said. Upon hearing this, Seamus got a panic attack. \"What?! Oh no! This is bad! This is bad! We must do somethin'! We must do somethin', quick! Quick, I tell y'all! Quick!\" Seamus shouted, tumbling and crashing about. Butch rolled his eyes at this and groaned. \"Well, come on, team. Let's go get this feline.\" And so, Diggs, Butch and Catherine all left to stop Tinkles, leaving only Seamus behind. \"Come on, people! We must do somethin' to put an end to this cat! Right now!\" he shouted. Then Butch yanked Seamus away with them, and a startled Seamus screams.[Chapter 4] After Diggs, Catherine, Butch, and Seamus left D.O.G. HQ to go stop Mr. Tinkles, it got dark. At Sophie's house, Mr. Tinkles and Calico are standing out the door after having a hot day at the beach. \"Hey boss, are we gonna work on the plan now?\" Calico asked the Persian, who answered and said, \"In a minute, okay? We just got back from that hot beach! We have to rest and cool down first! Then we get to work!\" \"Oh. Okay. Let's go then,\" said Calico and he and his boss walked into the house. Back at D.O.G. HQ... Right before the agents left the place, Diggs stopped them. \"Wait! I forgot something\" he suddenly realized and ran back to Lou's office. As well, Lou walked out of his office and yelled, \"Diggs! I forgot to tell you something!\" \"So did I!\" said Diggs. \"There's one last thing I must tell you where Mr. Tinkles is.\" \"Oh, yeah, that's what I was gonna ask you.\" \"Tinkles is located at his mansion. You must stop him!\" Lou said. \"Okay, thanks! Bye!\" Diggs said as he ran back to where the agents were. Butch and the others saw Diggs running back. \"What took you?\" asked Butch. \"Oh, sorry. I- I just went to ask Lou where Tinkles was located and he said at his mansion.\" \"Oh. Okay, good. Let's go then!\" Butch said and they jumped into a roller coaster-like vehicle and the seatbelts were locked onto the agents, then Butch pulled down the lever to take it back to Diggs' home, and the vehicle sped away.

Smile slipping smoothly into place as the President's personal secretary trotted into the sitting room. Her brightly colored tree frog daemon clinging loosely to the shoulder pads of her dress as she greeted him with a harried nod. \"Agent Banning? The President will see you now.\" They followed behind as she knocked on the door at the end of the hall - touching her hand to her headset. Politely ignoring Ursha when she sneezed. Highlighting the dust motes that were dancing overhead like miniature star-systems whenever they caught the light. \"The First Lady has been overseeing some renovations to the residential wing before they move in. Something about a complete kitchen remodel. We're going to have learn to live with the dust for a while yet, I'm afraid,\" the woman commented, keeping her eyes on him as Ursha shook herself. Looking down at her lioness paws in clear distaste as a fine coating of drywall dust tacked across the plush red carpet. Marking the way they'd come like breadcrumbs in a fairy-tale forest. \"When'd you get so fussy?\" he sent her silently, making no effort to hide his amusement. Knowing she'd be able to sense it anyway as her tail whipped across the back of his legs in retaliation. \"You have shoes on,\" she pointed out, definitely miffed. \"Whiny,\" he goaded. Needing the reckless part of the distraction right up until the woman opened the door and the man himself fixed him with a welcoming smile. \"Agent Banning, come in.\" The President greeted him warmly. Coming around the desk to shake his hand as a trio of officials and their respective daemons collected a sea of file folders and let themselves out, closing the door behind them. It wasn't the first time he'd met President Benjamin Archer, but it was the first time he'd spent any real time with him - notably alone. He'd served as part of the protective detail for the family during the last leg of the election circus. Familiarizing himself with them and their habits as his application quietly made its way through the system. He knew the White House like the back of his hand, and considering he liked the First Family, it'd seemed like the logical step. He knew his skill set. He knew what he brought to the table. And frankly he was confident he had what it took to keep them safe for the next four years. Hopefully eight, if the opposition kept on the way it was going. He'd fought wars in countries he'd barely been able to pronounce that were less scary than some of the shit coming out of their mouths lately. \"I wanted to be one of the first to congratulate you on your promotion. I have to say I was pleased to see you in the ring when it came down to the director's final recommendations. I appreciate the solidarity by the way. Not being the only newbie around here. I know you're familiar with how things work around here, but the vetting process is tough for head of security. Even for a person with your qualifications. It's a whole different ball game where you're the one calling all the shots. Believe me, I know.\" \"It's an honor, sir,\" he answered, pleased that he could do so honestly. \"You probably know the place better than I do. We're still getting settled in. Maggie sends her apologies, something came up at Conner's school.\" \"Not a problem, sir,\" he returned crisply, hands posed palm on top of palm in front of him. Already aware of the First Lady's whereabouts. He'd assigned Roma and Arcus - his black and tan Doberman Pinscher daemon to head her protective detail for the day. Hell, he was barely experiencing first day jitters. So far they were on schedule and the team rotations he'd chosen were meshing above expectations. But what did catch him off guard was when Ursha settled in beside him. Sitting upright and pretty instead of her usual careless lounge. The one almost everyone took for nonchalance and laziness until she flipped the script and showed them otherwise. The President's eyes flicked down, taking her in. The action itself nearly making him choke when she only preened in response. Licking her muzzle as her golden fur tinted the air in a muted bath of Midas-gold. Getting the distinct impression he'd missed something as the moment only grew in significance instead of tapering off. He sent her a mental question mark. Something tangible and clearly more of a what the fuck are you doing? sort of feeling, that she just returned with warm amusement. It was one the first things a child learned. People didn't acknowledge other people's daemons. Especially people you didn't know well. It was something that required intimacy and sometimes even then it wasn't universal. Daemons could and did interact with one another without compunction but often remained aloof unless they knew each other. Otherwise the reality of human-daemon interaction was clear. It was borderline taboo and for good reason. Your daemon was your living soul. It was the deepest and most honest representation of who you were. And therefore, had to be protected at all costs. This was a statement. A line the man was drawing in the sand right off the bat. The only question was why. \"She's lovely,\" the President commented, catching him off guard as the man openly gestured towards his daemon. Registering her surprise along with his own at the breach of social protocol as the tuft of fur between her shoulders prickled into hackles \"Ursha? Am I right?\" He nodded stiffly, trying not to let the inevitable shiver that came with someone calling her by name show as the man watched him closely. Unsure of what to do with the frisson of uncertain intimacy the feeling provoked. Ursha however only chirped, low and honey-tongued in clear approval like flattery got you everywhere and this was a concept she was buying into now as the President smiled genuinely. Crinkling the laugh lines around his eyes as his daemon finally looked up from her place below the window. Massive head leveling even with him for a long moment before settling on her haunches. Able to feel the vibrations as the ripples of her immense weight traveled through the floorboards under their feet. \"You don't see many lion daemons,\" the President commented after a moment. Gaze shuttered and calculated as he watched him with keen eyes. Missing nothing and probably picking up far more than he was comfortable with sharing. His smile went tight. Remembering how gorgeous Ursha looked when her muzzle was flecked with blood and grit. Sharp claws hooked and extended as she took out an enemy combatant running - lips pulled back in a guttural snarl. Mirroring him in every way, just as nature had intended as he slammed the other over a natural ridge in the terrain. Breaking their windpipe with the sharp of his palm before kicking the wheezing flesh over the edge and signaling to his team the all clear. His eyes flicked over to the man's daemon before answering. \"Perhaps as often as one sees a politician with brown bear for a daemon, sir.\" Interest and something that felt remarkably like recognition flashed as the words aired out. Two people seeing something of themselves in each other. Hell if he knew how it worked. All he did know was that somehow, on some level, the man had made him. And instead of keeping the realization close to his chest, he made sure the man knew it. \"You know, when Kumi finally settled both my parents were furious,\" the President mused. Head tilting over at the muted television in the far corner of the room, currently playing a commercial for whitening toothpaste. \"Politicians don't have daemons like that. They have ones that are small and easily hidden - ones where you can keep who you are close to your chest. At the time I was just glad to be able to stick it to them anyway I could. Self sabotage sure, but mostly it was my way of punishing them for having my life planned out for me since the cradle.\" The crazy part was that it fit. The man's daemon? He'd done his homework. The Asher name was well known in business and politics long before President Asher had come around. But out of all of them, he seemed to be the black sheep of the family. What with his sweet nature and sleepy, lumbering bear daemon. But he'd never been completely fooled. He'd seen the switch more than once before. Where the easy-going attitude dropped and the man's teeth came out to play. Asher didn't belong in the snake pit. He was above it. Better . And that wasn't loyalty or patriotism talking either. Asher understood the games they played, but he never fully put his chips in. Because unlike the rest, he actually had principals he stuck too. \"First year of university I ended up falling in love with politics anyway. And it wasn't until the year I ran for senator that I realized Kumi really was the equivalent of wearing my heart on my sleeve - at least when things got cutthroat. See, Steiner- the guy I was running against at the time, he didn't take me for the one person everyone else did. Seeing Kumi as she so often is,\" the man imparted as the daemon in question chose that exact moment crack a yawn. Showing off rows of sharp teeth and a black and pink speckled palette. \"Not what she is, what we are .\" A survivor. An enemy only when provoked. Smart. Industrious. Problem-solving. Placid. And absolutely lethal if the occasion called for it. But instead of putting any of them to voice he simply nodded and stuck with a canned answer. \"Don't poke the sleeping bear.\" The President nodded back. \"The thing is though, I'm glad. Why not be who you are? Unless you have something to hide? Kill the myth that you have to be dirty somehow to be in politics. That you can't come in with good intentions and keep them for the duration.\" \"Well, it worked. Didn't it?\" he pointed out. Rewarded when the man smiled again. He'd been at home when CNN had called it. Asher had won the popular vote by a couple dozen landslides and just squeaked through when it came to the Electoral College. It'd been the first time he'd been in a good mood for months. \"Yeah, I guess it did, didn't it? What about you?\" The day Ursha settled had been the same day he'd walked the four and a half miles to the military recruitment kiosk at the mall. The officer in charge had taken one look at him and his daemon and signed him up on the spot. The handshake had been firm, studded with gun-callouses and old scars and he'd liked the feel of it immediately. Wanting it for his own as the officer's German Shepard daemon hesitantly wagged her tail at Ursha's demure lounge across the tiles. He thought about how he'd known that morning when he'd woken up, half smothered under a swatch of living fur she still had to grow into, that this was the form she'd decided to settle in. He'd just known. More than that, it'd felt right. This was who they were. Now they had to deal with it. He didn't realize he'd drifted off until he looked up and found the President watching him quietly. \"Neither of us had a chance did we?\" the man offered, not rueful but not exactly smiling either. Experiencing a sober sort of solidary between them before the corner of his lips tugged upward. Unknowingly framing the next few years in it's image as Ursha leaned into him, stretching out with her paws before slowly slinking down across the carpet. Eyes never leaving Kumi's curious stare as the President's daemon watched from what was left of the sunbeam below the west window. \"I'm not the hiding sort, Mr. President,\" he remarked by way of answer. \"Neither am I,\" the man replied. Giving him the impression that he'd just passed some sort of personal test before the President was speaking again. \"I think we understand one another then. Don't you?\" He inclined his head. \"Yes sir.\" Ursha huffed from her place on the floor at his feet, kneading gently at the carpet like she was right at home. Ears flicking alert, as unflappable as always, as the President tried, but failed to stifle an amused sound in response. \"Kiss ass,\" he sent her silently. Knowing exactly what she was doing as the President's daemon watched all three of them through half-mast eyes. Knowing he should be mortified by her boldness even as a comfortable thrum of yes, this hushed through him. Because privately he was right there with her. Feeling Ursha's amusement and growing interest in the President and his daemon quickly start to mirror his own. His hand ghosted his ear-piece as Roma and the rest of the First Lady's detail checked in over the radio. \"ETA, thirty-five minutes. In possession of Sparkplug. Sparkplug's detail following.\" \"Now that all that's out of the way,\" the President started, rubbing his hands together as his expression changed from serious to an almost boyish smile. Giving him a clear once over before catching his eyes again. \"I hear you like to box, Agent Banning.\" He nodded, not bothering to hide the smile this time as Ursha's tail flicked back and forth in clear interest. Getting a clue as to where this was all headed as the man made his way around the desk with the air of a man who knew exactly how awesome his shiny new toy was. \"Because it just so happens that so do I. And they're setting up a brand new ring in the secondary training room right now. I thought you might want to come take a look at it. You know, in the name of national security.\" He smiled again. The expression professional-thin but growingly warm in a way he'd already figured might just be habit forming. Thinking it was pretty safe to say that the man had officially set the bar right up into the stratosphere as far as employers went. Effectively ruining him for any other job as the President led the way out the door with a clear bounce in his step. \"Absolutely, sir.\" Hell of a first day on the job.

Anthropotheism Chapter Two It wasn't until Agent Banning had escorted them back to his office and left him with the vague promise of a boxing session later that week that he turned to his daemon with a raised brow. Waiting until the sound of the man's footsteps faded down the hall before blowing out a pent-up breath and scrubbing his face with his hands. Not quite able to buff out the lasting dimples of the grin the man had left him with. Something about him having to leave his title in the locker room when they did - otherwise the director would probably have him assassinated for actually hitting the President of the United States. \"What do you think?\" he asked as Kumi butted into the back of his knees. Sending him sprawling back into his chair a bit more roughly than he'd intended. Patting her head with a pleasant high as he drummed the fingers of his free hand across the over-polished wood in front of him. \"He smells like blood. They both do. His. But mostly other people's,\" Kumi answered, slow to start - just like she always was - but with a conviction he'd always taken strength from. \"That's the person we've chosen to protect our family.\" \"What does that say about us?\" he mused, thoughtful. Remembering the thickness of Banning's file. How it'd felt weighty somehow. Significant. And how not all of it was glowing. The man was a force of nature. Rough around the edges and unapologetically human. He couldn't deny he'd liked that right from the start. \"That we're smart,\" she replied, angling her head so he could scratch under her ears. Huffing gutterally as he smiled into the thick of her fur. Inhaling the familiar smell of her. \"We're going into this with our eyes open, Ben. That's more than most can say. We know the risks. They know them better. We got into this because we knew we could do some good. That's worth the risk. Changing things for good reasons, not the same old bad ones. We might come from old politics, but that isn't who we are. It isn't what we're going to be. We're going to be better, for everyone.\" He nodded. Banishing the usual ghosts as he looked around the Oval Office. His office. For the next four years at least. The campaign trail might be finally over, but now he had a hell of a lot of work to do and a hell of a lot of promises to keep. Because he intended on keeping them. All of them. \"Though, I think we're a bit too old and too married to be flirting,\" she added, making his head to jerk up like he'd been burned. Feeling the sharp of her point before parrying it with one of his own. \"That wasn't what that was,\" he sent her quickly. Speaking to her directly through their bond this time instead of out loud. \"Oh? Not even a little bit?\" she mused silently, sending him an image of the two of them from her perspective. Forced to be level with the way he seemed to never stop smiling. Orbiting around the man as Agent Banning's lip quirked. Doing a bad job at hiding his admiration as he examined the newly installed boxing ring with the air of someone who'd spent more time in one than out. Someone that loved the sport for what it was. Skill against skill. Strength against strength. Someone who knew the best thing that could happen in the ring was the gift of a fair, evenly matched fight. And he had the feeling Banning had that in him in spades. \"It wasn't,\" he firmed out loud. Hating her a little bit when his daemon said nothing. He loved Maggie. That had been something else. A different sort of chemistry. An innate understanding and resting respect. Something that could turn from professionalism to friendship oh so easily if he let it. And he fully intended to. The man had seen and done so much, yet there was still something young about him. Whole. \"Not that I think you should worry, he wouldn't recognize flirtation from the President of the United States even if you danced in front of him naked, slathered in pink glitter and knee high rainbow socks,\" she said dryly. Wondering if he was imagining the shallow tint of regret lurking in the back of her tone before she was off again and he'd lost the thread before he'd really gotten his fingers around it. \"He was caught off guard when you mentioned her. His assumptions shifted. I think you took a risk, but it paid off. He won't underestimate us again, though. Not like the others. But that's what you wanted, isn't it?\" He nodded. Burying his hands deep in her shoulder scruff. \"I don't want him to,\" he admitted. \"I needed to know if he could bend even in a place where it could hurt the worst possible way. The Secret Service tends to churn out a certain type. We need someone that can operate inside that column, but also go beyond it if they need to. This is the man who will be protecting us. All of us. Protecting Conner and Maggie. We need better than the best and I think I found it.\" She sighed, moving until her head was resting in his lap. Eyes more or less closed as they took a moment just for themselves. Admittedly there hadn't been a lot of that lately. The last leg of the campaign trail had been brutal. Long hours. Sleepless nights. Functions. Parties. Dinners. Press conferences. Debates. Speeches. Public appearances. The list had never really stopped, or even slowed down. Tack on being a husband and a father and- well- something had to give, he supposed. \"Just be careful.\" she hummed after a moment. \"He might be more than you can handle. There is nothing wrong with being what you are, but she didn't settle as one of nature's perfect predators for no reason.\" \"I'm counting on it,\" he answered, remembering the depth behind Ursha's piercing stare. \"I need someone that will keep me on my toes. Someone that won't cave because of what we are- rather than who we are. Besides, we could all use some excitement once and a while, don't you think?\" She huffed at his grin. \"Don't say I didn't warn you,\" she snorted, amused this time. \"He's going to chew you up and spit you back out again on that ring. I'll bet he'll even hit you back.\" He cuffed her ear playfully. Surprised she'd given in so easily. Kumi was far less magnanimous than he was. Always a little more hesitant, a little more guarded. \"High praise,\" he murmured. Watching his mobile light up from where he'd placed it face down on the desk. If Charlie was calling him on his cell, rather than the landline, it could wait. \"Even though you're supposed to be on my side.\" She sniffed at him, one meaty paw coming up to rest on his thigh in that way she had. Creasing the press of his trousers. \"But deserved,\" she returned simply. Sending him a handful of flashes featuring Banning and Ursha ghosting the sidelines during the campaign trail and state dinners he'd attended as a senator at the White House under the previous president. Watchful. Distant. And almost nothing like the careful warmth he'd displayed downstairs when it'd just been the two of them. \"He will die for us,\" she warned quietly. \"They all will,\" he returned soberly, staring blankly at the door that led out into the hall. Knowing that Banning and the rest of his detail were close by. Idling and watchful. \"That's what frightens me.\" She shook her head. \"No, not like him.\" He said nothing. Trying to own the resulting silence before she offered the olive branch - just like she always did. \"I do like them,\" she amended, like it was important she said it out-loud rather than just letting him feel it. \"Both of them.\" \"I know,\" he replied, frowning at himself as he buried the strange, forbidden urge he'd fought the moment Banning had first entered the room. The one that'd twitched through his fingers as he'd wondered what it would feel like to let his fingers brush down the slim, lithe of Ursha's spine. Wondering if her fur would be soft or coarse and what kind of sounds he could pull out of the man's lips when he did. It'd been the kind of thought that'd scared him the moment it'd fully sunk in. Making him shudder all over again as the impropriety of it splashed over him like freezing-cold water. Mentally backpedaling from the firm of such a forbidden thing. To hold someone's heart in his hands. The very core of them. It was a desire that he hadn't felt even once before that very moment. Not even with Maggie and Testen. Kumi didn't say anything else on the subject as they sat there together. Fielding the same thoughts. The same desires. The same guilt and regrets. She didn't have to say a word. But in a handful of hours he would have to open that door and look Agent Banning in the eye. And for some reason that prospect has never seemed more intimidating than it did in that moment.

This story has been stuck in my head for a while and I thought, why not write it? So without any further adieu I bring you my latest Secrets of the Past. I do not own Cats and Dogs. Secrets of the Past By Tealfeather A Russian blue cat sat on a small chair with a table in front of her. Her beautiful gray fur was gently blown by the air-conditioning system as her paws fell upon at the keyboard in front of her as she typed the latest report from her previous mission. In front of her and across the table was a very bored German shepherd sat lazily on a chair in front of her. His head pointed up towards the ceiling as his eyes tried to look for anything interesting. Giving a sigh once in a while, he would then shift uncomfortably in his chair, making loud squeaking noises to the annoyance of the cat, as his body rubbed against the leader. \"Catherine…why is it always boring here?\" The dog groaned. \"Well I'm sorry Diggs…\" Catherine said as she looked away from the monitor. \"…I though watching me type was enough to entertain you.\" \"Entertain me!\" Diggs exclaimed. \"More like bore me to death!\" \"Don't blame me…\" She said as he started to type once more. \"…it wasn't my idea to bring you hear. Last time I checked you went here by choice.\" Diggs was about to complain, but it was true. But who could blame him, he just wanted to visit the headquarters of the number one feline security agency, where only few dogs have been. Actually there has only been one dog who has been there and that was him. He though the idea of visiting his feline friend and companion's headquarters was an exciting idea, since she visited their all the time, why not do something different for a chance. But after scaring some of her co-workers a couple of times and staring at the fish in the water dispenser, he found that this visit proved to be boring. Especially after watching the normally competitive and action loving cat that he knew type for almost an hour now. \"Well..uhhh…you know…umm…\" He then sighed, not being able to think of what else to say. \"Just finish your work so we can leave.\" \"Perfection takes time.\" She said with a slight sing song voice and Diggs knew that it meant that he was going to spend a lot more time being bored to death. So he looked up once more and closed his eyes hoping that he could drift off to sleep and wake up once she was done. But a loud alarm and the flashing of a red light down the hallway removed any sign of sleeping from his body. As his heart started to pump adrenaline throughout his veins. With one look at Catherine before looking towards the door, the two unlikely companions burst out of the room and down the hall towards the central hub, where a growing crowd of cats were already gathering. \"What happening here?\" Catherine asked one of the cat, who only shrugged in response. Suddenly, the large screen on the wall came to life, as the head of M.E.O.W.S. Tab Lazenby, entered the room to see a flame colored cat with green eyes pop up from the screen. \"Hello, former friends.\" The cat said with a slight his in his voice. He gave them all a wicked smile as he scanned them all from his view as all the cats, and one dog, stared at the screen, watching him curiously. \"Most of you may not know me…\" He said after a few seconds. \"…and I doubt if there are still any who do. So let me introduce myself.\" \"Some villains have fancy names that make them sound more glamorous than they really are, so let me spare you all from that. You can all call me Flame, plain and simple, and what I want is just as simple. Revenge against M.E.O.W.S.\" There were a couple of shocked gasp from the younger members of the agency, but the older more experienced ones remained silent, for they were already used to threats like that, and listened to what else he wanted to say. \"Revenge from all the things this agency has done to me. They have taken my inventions and ideas and through them like trash.\" He hissed. \"I tried to show you the future, but I guess I was just to ahead for my time.\" \"How do you expect to hurt as for your revenge?\" A bold agent said. \"We barely know if you're a threat to us, let alone capable to destroy this agency to its foundation.\" \"Oh I was hoping someone would ask that…\" He said grinning. \"…you see, I may not be able to hurt the entire agency as a whole, but I at least would be able some of you with this.\" The camera then panned to the left, to show a dozen squealing kittens, trapped inside a glass containment room. All of them had terrified looks on their faces as they tried to get our, by banging the glass with their paws, to no avail. Their cries for help echoed through the speakers as Flame moved the camera away from them. \"Each one of these precious kittens belongs to one of your agents. I could hear them beg for help, but none will come. Let this be a symbol of M.E.O.W.S inability to protect your families.\" He said grimly. \"I lost my own daughter because of them and now I will give you a taste on how it feels like.\" With that his face disappeared from the screen as it went black and turned on to stand-by. Cries of protest and anger soon filled the room, as angry cats unsheathed their claws and bared their fangs at what they just saw. Some of the cats, who saw their kittens trapped there, wept and hoped that they were alright. But most were angry and demanded for the arrest of that maniac cat. \"We must find him and put him in a cage!\" One screamed to the top of his lungs. \"Yeah!\" Agreed the others, who were just as angry and eager for a fight. \"Silence!\" Tab yelled, and soon everyone closed their mouths, turning the room into a quiet area filled with cats that held their anger. \"I know that you are all outraged, because of this…this maniac, but I all ask you to remain calm. We are still agents and professionals and thus we must deal this in a professional way, quick and effective.\" As Tab continued to talk and order the cats in his agency, behind the mass of cats Catherine and Diggs looked at each other with a sense of shock and awe. \"I don't like this…\" Catherine said. \"…we haven't had a cat this crazy since Kitty Galore.\" \"Yeah…\" He said nodding. \"…but you know what puzzles me?\" \"What?\" She asked, curiously. \"Is it just me or those M.E.O.W.S turn a lot of cats evil. Cause first we had Kitty and now we have…\" But before he could finish his question, it was answered with a slap to the cheek, by a paw with unsheathed claws, causing a great deal of pain to the German Shepard as an annoyed Russian blue walked away. So that conclued the first chapter. How was it, let me know in the reviews and as always see you in the next chapter. XD[Chapter 2] Hey, I'm back with another chapter. So if your reading this this must mean that you enjoyed the other chapter, so I hope you will enjoy this one too. Also before we start I just want to answer a question from patient935. The answer to your question is that Tinkles and Calico are behind bars once more, but I might change that if I can use them later in the story. Anyways, onward to the story. I do not own Cats and Dogs Secrets of the Past By Tealfeather Chapter 2 Diggs, Catherine, Butch and Seamus positioned themselves next to the western wall of an old cat food warehouse as two dozen M.E.O.W.S. agents flanked them on both sides. The warehouse itself was a wore down, rusty building that took its toll throughout the years. It had many broken windows and the walls were filled with moss and other kinds of dirt. Thanks to the tracking skills of agents, from both M.E.O.W.S. and D.O.G.S, they manage to figure out Flame's base of operations and immediately form a strike force to take him down. Since this was mostly M.E.O.W.S. problem, they had the lead role in the operation, with the dogs, composed of Diggs and Butch, as support. The main entrance of the warehouse was tightly defended by heavily armed cats. So they decided to enter from another area. Quietly ender the cover of darkness, the cats attached explosives to the side of the wall, so that they can blow a new entrance and catch them by surprise. \"You all ready?\" Butch asked as he watched the cats put on the finishing touches on the explosives. \"You bet.\" Diggs said. \"Yup.\" Catherine replied. \"Let's do this.\" Seamus said excitedly. Butch nodded to his team, before turning his attention once more to the other cats with them, who were now taking cover as they got ready to blow the bomb. Soon a loud explosion echoed through the air as bits of wall and dust flew off, some far away to the night sky, leaving a large hole from where the wall used to be. \"Go! Go! Go!\" Butch ordered as he charged into the hole, followed by the others, while the other cat agent followed suit. As Diggs entered the warehouse, he felt a sudden weight on top of him. Looking behind him could see a gray cat on top of him; with he's claws unsheathed and stabbing him. He growled in both pain and frustration as he tried to shake him off to no avail. \"You're not going to get awa…\" The cat on top of him was saying, but was suddenly cut off, as a ball of gray fur pounced him off of Diggs. Diggs turned his head to see what just had happened and saw Catherine rolling around with the cat, as she tried to keep him down. \"You alright there, Diggs?\" She asked, as she slammed her paw at the cat, knocking him cold. \"Yeah.\" He said nodding, and she nodded back before racing off to find another victim. Diggs always wondered how Catherine manage to fight of anyone without a sweat. 'Maybe its because of all that training in M.E.O.W.S.' He though remembering the time he watched the intense training regime of their cat agents. But his thoughts were suddenly cut off when something white and orange caught his eyes. Looking closely he could see another cat heading straight for him, at full speed. So he immediately got low and waited for him to approach. He could see the cats sharp claws unsheathe as the cat leaped into the air to attack him. But just as the cat was about to touch him, Diggs swung his right paw at the cat, sending him flying across the room. As he watched the cat fly off, his eyes saw a large glass containment area, near the place the cat fell. For a couple of seconds he starred at it before finally remembering something. In the video of Flame, which he saw earlier at M.E.O.W.S. headquarters, he remembered that the kittens were put into some sort of glass containment cell. So he started to move towards ir as quickly as possible, as he swerved left and right to avoid obstacles and battling cats. He put full power in his legs, as he raced through the warehouse, for he knew that the life of those kittens may be at risk if he didn't get them out. But, just as he was about to reach it, he was suddenly forced on the cold concrete floor. The next thing he knew, he had a net over him and had trouble getting up. The net was too strong for him and no matter how hard he tried it kept him down. It was like the harder he tried, the tighter the net went. \"Now where do you think you're going?\" A familiar voice said from behind. Diggs could hear the soft paw steps of the source of the voice as he walked right in front of the trapped German Shepard. Looking up, which proved to be a difficult task with the net on top of him, Diggs found himself face to face with the very cat they were ordered to capture, Flame. Flame looked at him directly in the eyes, as Diggs though that the cat was staring at his very sole, with his own cold and intimidating green eyes. \"Looks like you got yourself in a predicament...\" Flame said grinning. \"…and for what? To save some kittens. I must say that this is the first time a saw a dog charge through a battle to save the off spring of their natural enemy. So I would give you props for that, and as a reward your death would be swift and painless.\" He then raised his paw, to show Diggs his unsheathed claws. Moving it slowly towards Diggs throat, he gave the trapped dog an almost maniac like smile. His claws were just about to reach Diggs's skin when suddenly, out of nowhere, Catherine pounced on Flame pinning him to the ground. She then kept both fore paws on his chest as she looked towards Diggs. \"Are you alright?\" She asked, with concern. \"Yes, but I think that was cutting it a little to close for my comfort.\" Catherine nodded, but gave out a surprised squeak as the cat under him pushed her off and pinned her to the ground. Diggs felt panic overcome his body and tried to get out of the net. He needed to save Catherine and he didn't know what he would do if something happens to his friend. But shockingly, Flame wasn't attacking her. He just kept her pinned down under him as the Russian Blue squirmed and struggled to get him off. She then stopped, once she noticed he wasn't attacking her, and looked up towards him. For a moment both of their eyes met, and Flame just kept still as if he couldn't believe what he was doing. His expression softened, to Catherine's surprise, as he looked at her and Catherine wondered what was wrong with him. \"Catherine!\" Diggs cried out, which caused Flame to snap out of his trance. He then looked towards Diggs, who was still struggling under the net, before looking back at Catherine. \"I'm sorry that I have to fight you…\" He said with a soft voice. \"…but I promise you that I will fix this all and that we would all be happy together once more.\" This confused Catherine and made her wonder what he meant. 'Have I met him before?' She though, but immediately shoved the thoughts away as she saw him raise his paw. \"Forgive me, but I cannot risk you chasing after me.\" He said before swinging her paw at her chest, causing her to screech in pain. He then got off of her and turned his attention back at Diggs. \"I would like to stay and chat, but it seems that the situation has become unfavorable for me.\" He said looking back at the battle he's minions were losing. \"But before I go, let me leave you all with a parting gift.\" He then padded towards a large lever near the glass containment and pulled it, before racing away. Suddenly screams of panic came from the kittens inside as a thick black gas filled their containment area. It was later replaced by cough as the kittens breathed the heavy gas before they fell on the ground, unmoving. Diggs eyes went wide open as he saw this, thinking what kind of monster can do such a thing. He felt his heart break at the sight and fought back tear, knowing that there were still other things he had to worry about. Catherine, who was enduring a great deal of pain because of the wound, curled up into a ball and tried to lick it to ease the stinging. She ever imagined that a wound could be that painful and though that his claws must have dug really deep into her skin. Diggs felt anger and worry throughout his body as he saw Flame run away from the battle and watch Catherine yowl in pain. For some reason, he always worried about Catherine during missions and was always concerned when she was hurt. But this was rare, for Catherine being Catherine was agile and somehow manages to help her avoid injury. This skill not only impressed Diggs, but other too, because it was rare and almost impossible for one to leave a battle unharmed. So seeing Catherine get injured surprised him and made him realize that Catherine too can be injured. But he shocked that aside, knowing it was improper to think of things like that during that moment. What he needed to focus on was to help her and capture Flame. But other than growl at the retreating cat, he knew that he could do no more, for the net kept him pinned down till someone removed it from him. \"You're going to pay for this.\" He said as he watched the flame colored cat jump out of the window, and escape, as his cat minions started to surrender one by one. \"You're going to pay for what you have done to those kittens and Catherine!\" \"Hey are you alright kid?\" He heard someone say behind him as the net on top was suddenly removed. Standing up, Diggs looked behind him to see Butch throwing the net of to the side. \"Yeah…I think I'm fine.\" He said, as he calmed down from his earlier outburst. He then remembered what happened to Catherine and looked back towards her, who was still curled up, before padding quickly towards her. \"Catherine!\" He called out as he stood next to her. \"Are you alright?\" \"What do you think?\" She hissed back at him, and Diggs was slightly embarrassed for asking an obvious question. \"Sorry.\" Diggs said his ears down in embarrassment. \"Here let me help you.\" He said before flipping her over, her back on the floor, so that he check on her wound. What he saw was something her did not expect. \"What's wrong?\" Catherine, who was still in a great deal of pan, asked. \"Is the wound really that bad?\" \"Well Catherine…\" He said, still in disbelief. \"…I don't think you're going to believe what I'm going to tell you.\" So that's that and another chapter concluded. If you liked it let me know in the reviews and as always see you in the next chapter.[Chapter 3] Hello everyone and welcome to another chapter. I would like to thank patient935 for your constant reviews. So this chapter may get a little crazy, because of me and weird ideas, but I hope you like it. I don't own Cats and Dogs. Secrets of the Past By Tealfeather Chapter 3 \"Will someone please tell me what wrong?\" Catherine yelled in annoyance as she was placed on top of a stretcher and moved through a long hallway towards the operating room. It had only been half an hour since she was injured, and after Diggs checked her wound, she was immediately brought back to headquarters, while everyone who checked on her injury gave her weird and confused looks. 'I didn't think that the cut was that bad.' She thought to herself as she was brought back to HQ. Although the injury itself hurt a lot, it didn't felt like one of those life threatening ones, so it made her wonder why everyone around her was panicking. What annoyed her even more was the fact that they weren't telling her anything. Throughout the trip no one, even Diggs or the rest of the team, told her the severity of her injury. Even if she pleaded to them to tell her, her efforts were just met with silence. She tried to judge how bad it was by the pain, but that proved to be just as difficult as asking them. Now she was being brought to an operating room, so that doctors can check on her wound and hopefully help her. Soon the saw the white walls of the hallway disappear as they brought her into the operating room. The then transferred her into a bed in the middle of the room as medical doctors prepared tools and instruments for an operation. Watching this made her slightly worried, which was rare for her, and nervous. She never been under the knife before and wondered if it was painful. But luckily for her, she will experience none of that pain, for one of the nurses attached a mask on her connected to a long tube. They then opened the tube and soon some sort of gas entered through her mouth and nose and into her lungs. She then felt tired and could feel her eyes close slightly. The last thing she remembered was that everything went dark. She woke up to find herself lying on a soft bed inside a large room. The wound, which by now was wrapped with bandages, still stung a little, but not as much compared to what she felt earlier. Looking around the room, she could see that it was plain and other than a small table had no furniture at all. As her eyes looked from left to right, it soon fell upon a black and brown German Shepard, who was standing near the door and looking at her with concerned eyes. \"Hey…\" He said, trying to remove the look of worry in his face. \"…feeling alright?\" \"Yeah…\" She replied groggily, thank to whoever knows medicine they gave to her. \"…I have a slight headache, but other than that I'm fine.\" \"Good…\" He said with a faint smile. \"but I suggest you prepare yourself for another headache. Cause what I'm about to show you is pretty heavy and hard to understand.\" \"Why what is it?\" She asked with a curious look. \"This…\" He said as he picked up a piece of paper, which he put on the floor earlier, and padded to her bed. He then put the paper down in front of her so that she could see. \"Ummm…Diggs, what is this supposed to be?\" Catherine asked, slightly confused, as she looked at some sort of metallic device that had tubes like veins and pipes that looks like bones. To her it looked like a mechanical version of the insides of a living being, but she still wondered about its relevance and why Diggs showed it to her. \"Well….\" He said hesitantly. \"…remember last night when I told you that you're not going to believe what I say.\" \"Yes…\" She said slightly annoyed as she remembered it. \"…and you never did tell me why. In fact I remember everyone giving me weird looks. So can you please tell me what was wrong?\" \"Well…Catherine…\" He said, shifting his paws. \"…the picture I showed you is you.\" Catherine eyes went wide as she stared at him in disbelief. Did she here him right or was she just imagining it. Yes, she must have, because what he just said didn't make sense. Seeing the confusing look in her eyes, Diggs knew that she didn't believe him. So he decided to explain it further. \"Catherine I know it may sound crazy, but you have to believe me. That picture was taken when doctors grew curious and opened you up when they were trying to patch you up from the wound. To the shock of all of us, we saw…that. Metallic insides that just looks like a high-tech car engine.\" \"No…\" She said shaking her head. The sense of shock was still in her and she failed to believe anything he had just said. \"…none of that is true and I can prove it.\" With a swift move she stood up on all fours and begun removing the bandages with her claws. 'Wait Catherine no!\" Diggs protested, but it was too late. She had already removed the bandages and saw the site that she denied only a few seconds earlier. Looking down at her wound, she could see that most of it was already stitched. But there were still parts where the stiches weren't as tight and right through them she could see some metal inside. \"B…but…but that doesn't make sense…\" She stammered as Diggs remained silent. \"…normal cat aren't supposed to be made of…of metal.\" She said now almost about to burst to tears. Diggs was surprise to see this, because the normally rock like Catherine was bursting with emotion, with tears streaming down her eyes. He wanted to say something to comfort her and was about to before stopping as he realized that he could say nothing to help. But luckily for him, someone entered that might be able to explain it all. \"That's because you're not a normal cat, Catherine.\" A white and black tabby said from the door. \"At least not in the inside.\" \"Tab?\" Catherine said looking up as she wipe off her tears with her left paw. \"W…what are you doing here?\" \"I'm here to explain things.\" He said as he entered and sat himself next to Diggs. \"I think I owe you this anyways after what you've been through. But I got to say no matter how much I prepared myself; I never actually found the perfect way to do this.\" \"What are you saying?\" Catherine asked as she put the bandages back on before lying down, facing him. \"Oh yes…\" He said with an apologetic look. \"…I should have gotten straight to the point.\" He then looked at her directly in the eyes and said: \"You have been wondering why you are what you are, right?\" She only nodded in response. \"Then I'm going to tell you. But I must warn you that what I'm about to say may shock you even more.\" \"Don't worry Tab.\" She said trying to smile. \"I think after this that there is nothing left that could shock me.\" \"I hope so…: He muttered to himself before continuing. \"Alright then, the story starts with a well-known agent named Flame. I'm guessing you have me him already?\" \"Yeah, that's the guy that gave her that injury and…killed the kittens.\" Diggs growled, but Catherine remained silent as she remembered what Flame told him. It had puzzled her that night on what he meant and it still puzzled her now. \"Well yes, but before he was a renegade he was the greatest engineer and scientist this agency had.\" Tab informed him. \"He manages to create new gadgets and inventions the help make M.E.O.W.S. become one of the most modern agency in the feline world. You can almost say that he was ahead of his time.\" \"Then what happened?\" Catherine asked. \"Tragedy happened Catherine, tragedy happened.\" He said with a grim face. \"For you see, Flame had a daughter, if you remember he mentioned it in his revenge video, that he took care by himself. His lover had left him for another leaving the two alone.\" \"He loved his daughter with all his heart and did everything to protect her and keep her happy. But eventually she grew up and once she did, she decided to join the agency too. At first he rejected the idea, fearing that she would get hurt, but once he saw how good she was he couldn't say no.\" \"But one faithful day, his world turned upside down. His daughter was sent on a dangerous mission to capture a well-known terrorist. Flame knew that it was a bad idea and tried to tell the agency not to send her, but they reassured him that they will bring her back in one piece.\" \"But they didn't, do they?\" Diggs concluded. Tab shook his head. \"No, and once Flame saw his daughters lifeless body, he couldn't help but lie on the floor and weep.\" \"At first he didn't do anything, but cry and cry, blaming itself on himself, because he allowed her to go. He just wished that he could talk o her once more and bring life to her now cold and dead body. That's when he got the idea.\" \"Only three day after her death, he took her body and locked himself in his laboratory. Inside he created different kinds of devices that acted like organs, from lungs to hearts, and put it in her. He basically turned her to a cyborg, skin in the outside machine in the inside.\" \"But M.E.O.W.S. didn't like the idea. They said that it was equivalent to making zombie and it was against nature itself. Flame tried to plead with them, saying that it was for his daughter. But they didn't listen. Instead they arrested him and kicked him out of the agency, leaving him to gather all his anger till the day he would get revenge, which is now.\" \"So what happened to his daughter?\" Catherine asked. \"Well you see M.E.O.W.S didn't like the idea of having an almost finished cyborg in their base, so they ordered one unfortunate agent to dispose of her…and that was me.\" \"You!\" Diggs exclaimed. \"Yes, me.\" Tab said. \"So I did what I was ordered to, like a good agent will. But the only problem was that I couldn't. When I looked her, I saw that her tail was twitching and that's when I learned that she was already activated, just not fully.\" \"That's when my consciousness kicked in, for I considered her as living being, no matter if she was half machine.\" \"So what did you do?\" Catherine asked. \"The only thing I thought was right. I took her away and hid her from M.E.O.W.S, and I got to say that was not an easy task. I took her to a nearby family, that I knew was kind to cats, and just as she was about to wake up, left her in front of their door. I watched as they took her in and smiled knowing that I did the right thing. Once in a while I watched her behind the shadow and always kept an eye so tha…\" \"That's an interesting story and all, but what does that have to do with me?\" Catherine interrupted him. \"Because Catherine…\" He said with a serious look in his eyes, as if he was going to attack her. \"…you are Flame's daughter. \"What!\" She screamed, at him, surprising Diggs and making him jump up in shock. Catherine felt her heart stop as she heard that. 'No this can't be…' She thought. '…I can't be his daughter.' But her dismissive thoughts fell apart once she realized something. Some of the things he said seemed familiar. Like the fact that she woke up in front of her current owners house before they took her in and the fact that she didn't have any more memory before that. \"I'm sorry Catherine, but it's true.\" Tab said. \"B…but…how…n…no.\" She stammered as she found it difficult to speak. \"I'll give you time to take it all in.\" Tab said as he turned around and started heading for the door. But just as he was about to leave a loud explosion echoed around them, as the entire room shook. This caused both him to trip from both the force of the explosion and shock. \"What was that?\" Diggs asked in alarm. He started wondering if there was an accident inside the base or if something else had happened. \"I don't know…\" Tab, who was trying to get back on all fours, said. By now the sound of alarms rang all around as cat raced through the hallway as fast as they can. \"…but whatever it is I don't think it's good.\" So I hope you all enjoyed that chapter, and do you know how you can help me know if you did. By reviewing. XD So please do, and as always see you in the next chapter.[Chapter 4] Since I'm feeling generous right now, I decided to give you all another chapter. So I hope you all enjoy this and feel free to review. Also patient935, yeah your right. \"Daddy issues\" XD I do not own Cats and Dogs. Secrets of the Past By Tealfeather Chapter 4 Tab looked at Diggs with a sense of urgency riddled all over his face. \"We need to get to my office and check the security system.\" He told the German Shepard, who nodded in response. The dog then stood and started to approach Tab. Catherine followed suit, but was stopped as Diggs blocked her with his tail. \"You're not going anywhere.\" He said. \"What?\" She complained. \"But why?\" \"Your still injured, Catherine. I don't think you are in shape if something goes wrong.\" \"That is ridiculous.\" Catherine said as she rolled her eyes. Although she knew that he was just trying to protect him, he didn't have to treat her like a kit. She was a full grown cat who can handle on her own no matter what and she didn't want to take orders for him, especially right now, when there could possibly be a dangerous situation in the base. \"Tab back me up here.\" She said, looking at her boss. But he only shook his head. \"I'm sorry Catherine, but I think I got to agree with Diggs. We can't risk in you getting hurt again.\" He said. \"So I suggest that you stay in here, while we handle the situation.\" Catherine was frustrated as she heard this. Not only was her partner saying that she was not fit to fight, but also her boss, not that was just outrageous. \"Don't worry Catherine…\" Diggs said as he followed Tab out of the door. \"…we'll be back as fast as you can say catnip.\" With that said he disappeared through the hallway, leaving the Russian blue alone in the room. With a sigh, she lay down, once more, on the bed and buried her face on the mattress. What else was she to do while she waited for them? \"I hate getting injured.\" She said gloomily, promising herself that this will be the first time and the last time that she will get herself hurt in a mission. Minutes pass as she starred at the wall, doing nothing. The ticking off the nearby clock annoyed her, but she did nothing about it, for it was her only form of entertainment. \"Uhhhh…\" She groaned. \"…..this is boring. Why can't anything exciting hap…\" She wasn't able to finish the sentence, when someone suddenly entered the room. At first she thought it was Tab or Diggs. But instead she saw an unfamiliar looking cat on the door way. Since there was a loud explosion, earlier, and a cat, who wasn't a member of M.E.O.W.S., in her room, her instinct concluded only one thing. They were being invaded. The unknown cat looked at her for a brief moment, but once he saw her prepare for a fight, he immediately got low and prepared to pounce. But it was too late, for Catherine already leaped off of the bed and flew across the room towards him. Slamming her unsheathed claws against him, she was sure that she gave her a wound that he will never forget. But as she turned around to face him, she was shocked at what she saw. She had expected to see blood to drip from her victim, but instead so no blood at all. Instead, she saw a large wound on the cheek of the cat that she attacked and through that she could see his metallic, machine like insides. \"No…\" She stammered as she backed away in fear. \"…that's not possible. I thought...\" She suddenly bumped into something, making her jump and turn around in surprise. \"Hello my princess. I knew that they would put you here somewhere.\" An orange cat said. Catherine starred at him for a moment and couldn't believe how he got here. Right in front of her was the very cat who killed the innocent kits and was her so called father, Flame. \"You.\" She hissed at him as she took a pouncing position. \"What are you doing here?\" \"I came here for you.\" He said plain and simple. \"For me?\" She asked raising an eyebrow. \"B…but why?\" Flame just shook his head, with slight disappointment. \"Well it looks like you still don't have memories about me.\" He said with a slight frown. \"But no matter, we can fix that once we get back to my lair.\" He then turned around and exited to the hallway. \"Come on now Catherine.\" \"What makes you think I'm going to follow you?\" She said facing him, while giving glances behind her once in a while to make sure that the cat there won't catch her by surprise. \"Oh, Catherine, still the same stubborn little girl I left. How I missed that.\" He said with a small smile forming in his face. \"But you don't have much of a choice my dear.\" He suddenly pulled out some sort of device from a backpack that he was wearing. It was a long cylindrical device, which looked like a small ball pen, which had a small button on top. \"But you leave me with no choice.\" He then took the device with his paws and pushed the button. Soon Catherine blacked out and fell on the ground. \"Catherine!\" Diggs shouted as he walked into the room, with Tab behind him, where they left her only to find it empty. He looked left to right to find any sign of her, but the place looked like that she had never been there at all. Checking under the bed, gave the same result and he wondered what had happen to her. He knew that she would have been bored inside the room, but he never though that she would risk herself by going out and get herself injured further more. \"This can't be good.\" He said as he tried to think of a place where she could have gone. \"She must have gone for a while now, judging by the scent, but to fight. I know she likes to serve M.E.O.W.S., but she had gone too far this time.\" \"I don't think she left in her own will.\" Tab said as her lay crouched near the door. \"What?\" Diggs asked confused. \"What makes you say that?\" \"Because of this.\" He said as he took a tuff of orange fur, using his paws, and raised it towards Diggs. Diggs studied the hair, thinking that it looked very familiar. 'Where have I seen this be…' But he cut off his own thoughts as his finally realized where the orange fur came from. It came from the worst cat he knew. That cat he swore he would catch and bring to justice, because of the crime he has done. \"Flame!\" Diggs growled, as he thought of ripping that cat apart. Well there you go. So I hope you enjoyed it, and please review and as always see you in the next chapter.[Chapter 5] Hello and welcome to Secrets of the Past. I hope you are all enjoying this story and you can let me know by reviewing. So before I waist anymore of your time, lets go to the story. I do not own Cats and Dogs. Secrets of the Past By Tealfeather Chapter 5 Tons of precious memories flooded into Catherine's head as she was strapped on a mattress with a strange helmet on her head. It ranged from happy and fun to sad and lonely, but no matter what memories they were it made her feel that a gap in her has been filled, and that something that has been missing for years has been found. Memories long forgotten have finally returned to bring realization to her. 'Is this how my life was before?' She thought. 'Having a loving father and enjoying myself from mission to mission.' The idea of Flame being her father still shocked her, but as the lost memories entered her it made her realize that what he did happened because he loved his daughter, and that was her. \"So…\" Flame said as he unstrapped her from the mattress. \"…do you remember me now?\" Catherine stared at him for a while, their eyes meeting each other. After the memories have returned, she could feel a surge of emotions flow through her. She didn't know how to react to this, but finally realizing that she was face to face with her father was too much for her. \"You really are my father.\" She finally manage to say as tears streamed down from her eyes. \"Yes.\" He said, slowly nodding and trying to control his emotions. He had waited a long time for this day and he couldn't wait to spend time with his daughter. Suddenly Catherine did something she didn't expect to do in a million years. She raced up to Flame and buried her face on his chest, as tears streamed down from her eyes. Flame was caught by surprise at first, but soon calmed down from the initial shock and started nuzzling her. \"I missed you.\" She said. \"I missed you too.\" He purred. \"So what do you do here?\" Catherine asked her father as she looked down the railing to find a large number of cats standing still in attention. They cats were all gathered below them in a large open room inside the facility they were in. Each one of them looked like ordinary cats, but knowing her father everything was always more than it seems. \"Well as you can see…\" Flame, who was sitting beside her, said. \"…I am building an army of cyborg cats. Cats who are ten times stronger and better than the average cat.\" \"B…but why?\" She asked, fearing that she already knew the answer. \"Well for revenge my dear.\" He said, with anger in his voice. \"Revenge for everything M.E.O.W.S. has done to us. They ruined my career and denied me of being untie with you, and they are going to pay for that.\" \"But that was a long time ago, and we are already together.\" Catherine said, hoping she can convince him otherwise. \"Why do you need to harm anyone else, if you already have me back? Wasn't that what you wanted?\" \"Yes…\" He said nuzzling her. \"…I do have you back. But that isn't enough to repay the years that you were gone from me.\" \"But it's not right. Do you think that killing them and their love one will return those years that we were separated?\" \"No…\" He said staring at her, with eyes that she swore were glowing with evil. \"…but it will make them experience the pain I felt.\" With that said he pads away, leaving Catherine to just stare at him in disbelief, as he padded to another room. Although she knew and accepted that he was her father, she still couldn't accept his evil nature and through that if he couldn't stop planning his evil deeds, then she would have to stop him. She was just about to turn around and head the opposite direction, wanting to give him time to cool off before talking about the subject again, when suddenly a large explosion rocked the facility. The sound ripped through the walls, as the cats below her looked around in alarm. Catherine frantically looked around to see smoke coming from the wall down to her left, and as it cleared away, agent from both M.E.O.W.S. and D.O.G.S. stormed out and started attacking the minions of her father. From her view the battle looked intense as cats and dogs fought each other in a desperate fight. Although the agents were well trained and experience they prove to be no match for the cyborg cats. The only advantage the agents had were sheer number, which helped them fight the cyborg cats. \"Catherine!\" A familiar voice said from her left, and she immediately turned around to see a brown and black German Shepard. \"Diggs!\" She called out in joy. Never, in her entire time knowing him, had she ever been this happy to see him. Because although she loved the idea of being with her father, he's evil plans scared her, for she was trained to fight of the very evil her father was planning. So seeing Diggs again made her heart burst in joy. Diggs then raced towards her, but was suddenly stopped, when a gigantic claw grabbed him on the back and raised him high up. \"No! Diggs!\" Cartherine cried out as she watched her friend being brought up and into the side. Diggs looked down at the enraging battle below and saw the high drop that he would encounter if he fell. \"I should have killed you when I had the chance.\" Flame, who emerged from the darkness hissed. \"Father let him go!\" Catherine cried out. \"Wait what?\" Diggs exclaimed in surprise, as he hung from the claw. \"You're calling him father now?\" \"Diggs…\" Catherine hissed. \"…you're not helping!\" \"Oh, yeah…\" Diggs said embarrassed. \"…sorry.\" \"Please just let him down.\" She said once more. \"I'm sorry…\" Flame said as he held the controls to the claw, with his paws. \"…I cannot do that my dear.\" She shook her head in disappointment and sighed. \"Then I guess you leave mw with no choice.\" She said before pouncing towards him and knocking him down. This caused the controls to slip from his paws and land inches from them as she fell right on top of him and kept him pinned down. Flame looked at her before looking back at the controls. So he quickly grabbed it, but before he could press the release button Catherine dug her claws in his shoulder causing him to hiss in pain. \"Don't you even dare.\" She hissed. \"Why are you doing this my child? Are you really going to hurt me.\" He asked her. \"I don't want to hurt you.\" She said looking down. \"But your plans of killing just for revenge are against my morals.\" \"So what?\" He said looking at her, anger in his eyes. \"Are you going to capture me so they can put me back in a cage? You do know I escaped before and I can escape again.\" \"Yes I do…\" She said as she dug her claws deeper into him. \"…and there is only one way to ensure that you won't escape again.\" At first he gave her a confused look, not understanding what she meant. But as her claws dug deeper realization finally hit him. So I'll give you one last chance, let Diggs go and surrender.\" Catherine said as she tried to fight of tears. She didn't want to do what she was planning, but if she wanted to save Diggs and M.E.O.W.S. then that was the only way. \"No I won't.\" He cried out. \"Besides you can't do what you're planning. You are my daughter, my child. You can't kill your own father, the one who cared for you and loved you.\" \"I'm sorry…\" She said tears. \"…but you lost your daughter the day you built me.\" She then dugs her claws dip in him, causing him to scream in pain as he trembled before her. Catherine felt tears stream down her cheek and she hated every second of what she did. \"I'm sorry for your lost, Catherine.\" Diggs said as they walked through the facility, while agents rounded up the cyborg cats, who by now were surrendering after the loss of their leader. \"It's alright, Diggs.\" She as she walked near him. \"Although he was family, his intentions were still wrong.\" She then looked down at the ground before giving a sad sight. \"It's just sad that the only family member I had was someone so unfamiliar. Sure I got my memories back, but I never really got to spend time with him as the present me, you know what I mean?\" \"Yes…\" Diggs said nodding. \"…I think I do.\" He then pressed his head against hers, to Catherine's surprise, and said: \"Besides, your family to me.\" Catherine purred and smiled. \"Maybe you are.\" She said rubbing her head against his, making them bought smile. She knew that what he said might be true. For every time she nodded someone by her side, Diggs was always there to help her and make sure she was alright. She might have not really realized it before, but Diggs was family to her no matter what. They stayed at this for a while, eyes closed and enjoying each other's presence, as cats and dogs worked all around them, trying to list down all the prisoners and casualties. But after a while of keeping each other warm, they soon broke off and blushed. \"So…uhhh…yeah…feeling better now?\" Diggs asked. \"Yes…\" Catherine said nodding. \"…definitely.\" \"Well, good.\" He said smiling, before he heard someone call for him. \"Hey Diggs…\" It was Butch. \"…get over hey will yah.\" \"I guess I have to go now. I'll see you soon, Catherine.\" Catherine nodded and smiled. \"See you soon too.\" She then watched him pad away, his tail swinging left to right as he passed through busy agents working. But one cat was having trouble looking for a certain orange feline. \"Has anyone seen the body of Flame?\" Catherine heard him say. \"You know the leader of this evil organization.\" His question was only answered with shrugs as the other agents went back to their work. Hearing this put a small grin in Catherine's face as she looked up towards the shadows, to see a dark figure with a pair of green eyes looking at her. They stared at each other for a while, before Catherine gave a small nod. The figure nodded back and soon raced away from the area. The End So that concludes Secrets of the Past. Loved it? Hate it?

This story has been stuck in my head fo"},{"Movie":"Olympus Has Fallen","Title":"First Daughter","Author":"Nina.4444","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9687809","Passage":"[Chapter 1] First daughter Chapter 1 Five. The warm sun was shining brightly as she lay stomach down on the soft, lush grass beneath her. Her eyes were narrowed focused entirely on the small winged creature perched delicately on a flower just blossomed. She let a steady breath escape from between her lips and suddenly brought her hand down only to gasp with delight. She was careful to grip the net tightly and her brow creased with concentration as she deposited the beautiful butterfly into the bug catcher. Her lips stretched wide and she spun around on small legs, knees stained green before taking off towards her father. She slowed as she got closer and sighed when her wide eyes caught sight of the phone in his hand and the frown upon his face. Knowing it was a bad time she turned, dejected and began to trudge back through the grass, \"Awesome catch grasshopper\" the small girl grinned looking up at the man who had spoken as she passed him, \"It's a butterfly\" he grinned this time and crouched down to take in the bug that in all reality was a common moth, \"What's your name?\" he met her childlike eyes through the concaved plastic which made it appear as if the moth was in fact perched on her nose, \"Mike\" as she shook his hand like her father had taught her to do she didn't see the several men around them, all dressed the same way as her new friend was, frown disapprovingly, \"Do you want to see the worms I caught Mike?\" Six. \"And…all… the …..animals …..went….home….toget… -\" \"Together\" a deeper voice hinted kindly and she frowned focusing on the word, \"to….geth…er\" he gestured a thumbs up towards her at the staccato syllables and she grinned triumphantly, \"Good reading grasshopper, you're getting even better\" he remarked from where he stood just inside her door, \"Thanks Mike….sweet dreams\" he smiled at the girl closing her door after returning the sentiment, little did she know that he would be trading sleep for wandering the halls of her house to ensure that no real life monsters, scarier than the ones he used to check under her bed and in her cupboard for, weren't attempting to break in. Cakldjflksjdlk klasjdflkj ljasdlkfjskdfj Seven. \"Abigail where are your shoes!\" \"I don't want to go\" she was happily colouring in, her name autographed on the bottom of the large sheet of paper with a backwards b but nonetheless, \"I know honey but this is an important night for your father you need to be there for support\" she frowned at her mothers words, \"We went to one last night annnnnd another party the night before that one, they don't even have good party food Mum\" Fifteen minutes later her feet were itching inside her stupid new shiny pink shoes and all the ink had been washed from her small fingers, her masterpiece lying abandoned on her desk. She folded her arms across her chest as she sat on the uncomfortable couch and did her best to protest against the unavoidable party, \"Well that's not a happy party face now is it Abs?\" she pointedly looked at the floor refusing to peer up at the man she knew belonged to the familiar voice, \"I don't want to go to a stupid party\" she remained oblivious to the small smirk on his face at her stubborn features he'd seen too many times to count. The couch dipped beside her, \"Are you sure because I'm pretty certain that there's a man that you might want to see going\" confused, and momentarily forgetting her dismay, she looked up towards him only to follow his gaze towards the grand tree that stood in the corner of the large sitting room that she had decorated herself. Her eyes widened, \"Santa!\" Mike simply shrugged and raised his eyebrows, eyes sparkling with knowledge, \"And maybe we'll even be able to find some fairy bread somewhere\" he whispered and she grinned widely as he tapped his nose, their secret spy signal, \"That's more like it, now why don't you go and see if your mum and dad are ready to go?\" as she skipped away she missed the man murmur to one of the men that lined the walls of the room to contact the caterers and make sure there was the promised favourite party food. Eight . She stormed down the halls stomping towards the side of the house that she rarely ventured into. Three men followed her like usual but she paid little attention to them wrapped up firmly in her fury. Different faces turned towards the small girl who was obviously on a mission some in amusement, some in shock and some with curiosity. It was only when she reached the large room she came to an abrupt stop and raised her hand, \"Ah miss Abigail?\" one of the men from behind her said but his words did little to stop her fist from hitting the glass several times until her father, sitting at the head of the table looked up in shock. Her father stood and the doors slid open with a whoosh allowing the girl to march in passing people she had no idea were of the upmost importance, But to everyone's surprise she marched directly passed her father coming to a stop in front of another man who stood behind the large table. Her own fathers lips quirked up slightly when she placed her hands on hips, still fully clad in her spotty pyjamas, and looked up at the newest member of his own security detail, \"Good morning Abby\" Mike said from where he stood amongst the presidents new security. \"They said you weren't looking after me anymore\" her eyebrow arched in a way identical to her own mother and he knew without needing to ask that the young girl was referring to the new trio of men that she would've met outside her door that morning, \"Abby\" he was saved from answering the girl who was all but tapping her foot in anticipation of his response by her father, \"Mike is going to be looking out for me and mum now Abs, he's very good at his job don't you think\" hesitantly dragging her eyes away from his she peered at her father and nodded slowly, \"Well now that you're going to have a little brother or sister your mum needs some extra people looking out for her\" Abby sighed loudly forcing her father to work to stop smiling at his troubled daughter who was only slightly placated by the thought of a little brother or sister, \"But Dad they're boooooring\" she whispered loud enough for only the surrounding people to hear and fortunately not her new security who stood just outside the conference room. \"Abby!\" her Mothers worried voice came from the door and within minutes she was led from the room only having time to leave an unhappy glare towards both her father and Mike. As her mother, whose stomach was slightly more rounded than normal, apologised to the group of people she missed the amused glance shared between her father and Mike. When Abigail Rose Asher went missing three weeks later, three weeks of stubbornly sulking and refusing to talk to both her father and Mike whenever she was close by, the entire white house went into lockdown. \"Sir\" Mike said causing the distressed president to turn towards him thirty minutes after she'd gone missing, and ten minutes after it had been reported. The two men shared a glance and Ben sighed, \"Go find her Mike, please\" the man nodded before moving away from the group and down the hall to check the first most likely hiding spot Abby had hidden in. Seventeen minutes later he'd found her, alerted the president, and slid down the wall beside the girl who was hidden in the wall of the Lincoln bedroom. \"Hey grasshopper, you've got the place pretty worried you know\" he nudged her and she curled into herself her eyes narrowing, \"Are you still not talking to me?\" he asked a moment later when all he received was silence, \"Come on Abs, it's not that bad, we can still hang out\" she glared at him this time and he chuckled at the ferocity. He let them sit in silence for several minutes before trying again, \"How'd you escape your security then?\" he asked and her eyes sparkled and before she was even aware her mouth had opened the words had flown out, \"Second hallway, fourth staircase, hid in the store cupboard on the fourth floor, then went backwards and the long way around to here\" he grinned, \"Clever girl\" \"You still found me\" she said with a little fire, \"I'll always find you Abs\" Seventeen. The door opened, she could've sworn she'd heard it, and she pushed the small boy further behind her. The small gun was gripped in her hands, they were shaking too much. Point and shoot that was it. Point and shoot. How had they found them, had they found them? Was she hearing things? She could hear her heartbeat, and the blood rushing through her head, her brothers shallow breathing, was she breathing? Blood, there was blood everywhere. On her hands, in her hair, staining her shirt, everywhere, she could smell it, taste it. Foot steps. Her heart stopped, her lungs screamed for air as she only gripped the gun tighter her eyes wider than they'd ever been. Point and shoot. It happened too fast, everything was too fast. It was too silent, then someone had rounded the corner, the gun had been removed from her fingers and Connor had pushed at her back. No. She pushed him backwards, her red stained hands meeting resistance as she tried, \"Mike….Mike!\" the boy had skirted around her and thrown himself into the arms of the man forcing her to blink several times, shake her head and swallow the lump in her throat. Her legs seemed to give out beneath her and she backed into the wall sliding down it, \"Hey..hey are you okay, are you alright?\" she watched Mike, the man she hadn't seen in over a year, address her brother who nodded dried tears on his little face. He raised a finger and placed it over his lips and Connor nodded as she felt herself hold her breath once more, not wanting to make a sound. He let go of the young boy who sat on the small step and reached for her, \"Abs\" his face darkened with worry as he took in the blood that coated most of her, \"You're hurt?\" he asked seriously but she shook her head, feeling more scared than she'd been in her life ever, and yet more relieved than she could ever remember being. His hands lay on either side of her face so he could meet her eyes, \"It's not mine\" she whispered her voice hollow and his eyes softened before he planted a kiss on her forehead and leaned back, \"I see this is still your favourite hiding spot\" she wasn't sure who he was addressing but Connor nodded. She watched from where she was as he pulled out a phone from his pocket and held up two fingers, \"Two seconds\" he pressed the button and whispered I've got sparkplug, and grasshopper her rapid heart slowed at the old name she hadn't heard him say in years, maybe they really would survive this? I'm bringing them out He looked back up at them both, \"What about our Dad?\" Connor asked and Mike looked at him, \"Your Dad's going to be fine, okay. Nothing bad is going to happen, we're going to get him out of here too\" Mike whispered with so much conviction that she felt herself believing the words as well. Connor nodded and then turned to her and she forced herself to smile nodding at her little brother. It was then that she caught Mike tense and gestured for them to be silent once more before arching his head to his right and pocketing the phone once more and pulling out another gun much smaller than the one that hung around his neck. Several moments later he pulled Connor up to stand just in front of him and then offered her his hand, helping her up before pulling her closer to them. He looked at the two of them before pointing a finger towards the door on the other side of the hidden hallway and she understood it to be where they were going. 1…2…. The first gun went off and it felt like it pierced her heart, she was wrenched forward by a large hand on her back and ran alongside Connor and Mike towards the door. The noise shattered her eardrums and she pushed her brother through before her as they all fell to the ground. \"You okay?\" she gasped to her brother who nodded, \"You two okay?\" Mike asked, his gun still trained on the door and she nodded as Connor replied, \"Okay let's get out of here then\" They were crowded at the door on the opposite side of the room, Connors hand held firmly in her own while Mike peered out the door, \"You guys know where the basement in this wing is\" they both nodded silently, \"Okay we're going to sneak down there okay\" she nodded once more and they moved forward as he did. He ushered the two of them out the door, his eyes skirting up and down the hall while she and Connor moved down it. Soon enough they were at another door that Mike opened soundlessly and they pushed in. They moved down the stairs, the agent training his gun on every corner until he knew it was empty while they escaped to the other side. \"Okay kids, eyes sharp, I need you to watch my six okay\" Mike said and they both spun around, Connor slightly behind her. Abigail felt a sharp pain in her side and flinched slightly, gritting her teeth, \"Damn it\" she heard Mike curse from behind them and turned to see him surveying the destroyed ladder that ran up beside a pipe, that she knew came out in the grounds of the white house. She followed his gaze to air vent and began nodding even before he looked back towards them. When he did he caught her eyes, \"Connor can fit\" she murmured and he nodded peering into the vent before raising a hand to his ear, Jacobs..okay I have sparkplug he's coming out in a ventilation shaft in the north west corner ground floor, have a green party waiting. The fire escapes been destroyed I'll find another way to send grasshopper through It was at that moment, both hearing his words, that Connor looked up at her eyes wide but she shook her head silencing his words. It was obvious Mike got the answer he was looking for as he pulled the cover off the vent. \"Abby has to come with us Mike\" Connor said causing the agent to look back at him, \"Abs and I are going to go get your Dad, alright\" he said as he discarded the cover and crouched down before Connor, \"Now you can do this, you remember the chimney climb I taught you on the garden wall\" Mike asked and she smiled, blinking furiously to stop her eyes watering, \"He's a pro at it now\" she commented and Connor nodded while Mike smiled, \"Well that's all it is okay, one foot against the front wall one foot against the back, all the way to the top\" he said encouragingly and Connor nodded looking at the vent before looking back at them. Abby resisted the urge to wrap her arms around her brother, he was fine, he was going to be fine, he didn't need to know how petrified she was. \"Mike I'm scared\" \"Me too\" Mike said raising a hand and pinching Connor's cheek affectionately, \"But you're going to get through it and when you get out you can tell the guys everything that's happening okay, that way we can get your Dad out quicker\" he fished in his pocket for something and she swiped a tear and cursed it as she saw the badge he presented Connor, \"You're one of us now\" she grinned at him when he looked up at her after Mike clipped it to his waistband, \"You have to look after my sister\" Mike nodded, \"I will, we're all going to be fine, I promise. Now we're counting on you kiddo let's go\" Connor wrapped his arms around her waist and she responded gripping her brother tightly before pushing him backwards, \"You can do this Con I know you can and I'll be out with Dad and Mike soon ok\" Connor nodded up at her and then Mike hoisted him upwards and into the vent, \"There you go now push on up okay\" \"Go Connor\" Abby said standing next to Mike so she could see in the vent, \"We'll see you on the other side\" Mike said and Connor nodded at them both. She watched as her brother climbed and felt another tear roll down her face as she pulled back so he wouldn't see. Sparkplug is on his way up. It was then that there were voices from behind them, from the hall, and she felt like wanted to vomit all over again. Mike grabbed her waist and pulled her to the other side of him, \"Connor hold on for a minute\" he pushed her towards the wall and pulled them behind some of the boxes there that would conceal them from the doorway. She swallowed the rock in her throat and held her breath waiting, praying, begging the noise to fade. Mike caught her eyes for a second and squeezed her hand as she closed her eyes for a moment and nodded at him that she was okay. She looked at the vent, her heart thundering, they would know. It was too obvious. The cover still lay on the ground. They would know where Connor was, she began to panic obviously sensed by the man in front of her who turned slightly and shook his head, placing a finger over his mouth. He nodded knowingly and she let herself lean back, body on fire, but knowing he wouldn't let anyone hurt Connor. There was a creak on the stairs and her stomach lurched her fingernails gripping the stone wall behind her. Footsteps. One two three four five…..coming closer, closer to them, closer to the vent. From behind Mike she saw a man, a gun strapped to his chest as he marched towards the vent. He spoke only three words before Mike lunged forwards his arm wrapping around the mans neck pulling him backwards away from the vent, away from Connor. She was frozen, stuck to the stone, her feet nailed to the ground. They struggled, Mike dragging the smaller man backwards. The sound of choking filled her ears and she watched wide eyed. The mans hand tried to reach him, but he couldn't, couldn't shake him off. She'd seen these men fight, the one Mike held in his grip. They'd killed her security, killed the women and men in the kitchens, killed Connors security, killed all the bodies lying dead on the ground. Then there was a horrible crack and she gasped. Her legs did give out then and she sunk to the ground as they did. Silence. The lifeless man was dropped to the ground and Mike stuck his head back into the vent, \"false alarm, go\" he's coming up Jacobs Mike stood near the crates for a moment, eyes and gun trained on the door. A moment later she could've sworn she'd heard the squeaking of a grate. She couldn't' take her eyes off the man though, his eyes seemed to be staring at her, piercing her. She heard Mike sigh in relief and then he was in front of her. \"Abby….Abs look at me\" his hands were on her face again, forcing her to look at him and she blinked. \"Abby focus…Abs they've got Connor he's okay, he's out, he's fine alright\" she nodded dazed, \"Abby focus, hey focus, take a breath\" she sucked in air at his words not realising she'd been holding her breath once again. Her eyes moved back down to look at the man, dead on the floor, had Mike cracked his neck? She could hear the sound, she would never forget the sound. She shook her head Connor was safe. It was all that mattered. Safe. He blocked her view and she looked back up at him, \"You and I can deal with everything else when we get out of here\" he said crouching down until he was at eye level with her, \"You need to focus Abs, if we're going to get out of here alive I need you to stay with me\" she nodded as he wiped the blood from her face and she tried not to remember whose it was. It was only as he pulled her from the floor and she gasped slightly he turned back to her. Without asking his eyes found her side and he tugged up the torn material to see the piece of glass in her side. \"Abs\" \"I….I didn't…..it all happened so fast…Connor.. and they were shooting and I…-\" \"It's alright kid you did great, Abs you've done good\" she sucked in a deep breath as he pulled it out, gripping his shoulder tightly, \"Still as tough as you were when you fell from the wall when I taught you the chimney climb huh?\" she smiled at his words as he tied a piece of material, from god knows where, tight around her stomach, \"I'm glad you found us Mike, thank you for coming back\" she whispered and he looked up at her, \"I told you I'd always find you didn't I\" Saw this movie last night, loved it, wrote this :) hope you like, please review if you think i should keep going (don't know if there's really an audience for this) Thanks[Chapter 2] First Daughter Chapter 2 \"We have to find my Dad\" he looked up at her voice, her words were laced with worry and he cocked his head sideways to consider the young woman, \"We have to get you out of here first\" he replied and she shook her head, \"There's not time and you and I both know that there's hardly going to be anywhere else I'm going to be able to get out, and I'm not exactly small enough to be hoisted into a chimney or an air vent\" she fired back and for a moment he saw the young girl who'd stood in front of him, hands on her hips, demanding that he be put back on her detail, after all no one else would play hide and seek with her and there was nothing like hide and seek with a willing secret service agent. They were sitting in a small room they'd snuck down to, several rooms from where Connor had madehis climb to escape. He'd taken her hand, both of them still on high alert, listening for sound, any sound. He'd pulled her beside him, closest to the wall and they walked quietly until they'd reached the room they were now hidden in, one with plenty of storage things for them to lay low in. \"What are we going to do? I know that I'm probably just going to get in your way but I ….. well I could just…-\" \"You're with me Abs\" Mike said firmly knowing well before she did where her train of thought was leading. \"So what are we going to do?\" she asked, \"First I want you to tell me everything you know, what happened, where you were?\" she swallowed and he kept his eyes on her. They were sitting across from each other, her boxed in against the wall behind some shelving and him so that he could hide but have one eye on the door. Her voice was but a whisper in answer, \"In the grounds\" he watched her as she remembered the events as if they were playing on her pupils like a movie. \"Around the back. Connor was upstairs playing some game. I went down, it was nice out took a book, did some school work. We were supposed to be out of the way for the Korean prime minister coming\" The sun had warmed her entire body. She'd walked for a good fifteen minutes down to the area she loved. Into the gardens. She'd set herself up there, offering the guys the food she'd thought ahead to bring, \"Then I heard this bang, it was a while away but the guys on the roof were yelling something and Mack, and agent Jackson and agent Riley my new security guys they wanted us to go inside. Nobody was that worried though and then it was just…everyone was everywhere. More guys starting running out to us, everyone had guns all of a sudden something came out of the roof\" she put a hand to her head massaging her pulsing temples, \"Why weren't you evacuated?\" Mike asked frowning, \"We were too far away from the gates but that was their plan, I wanted to get to Connor and Dad and everyone but they just kept pushing me to the gate. And then we heard the plane it got closer and closer and then suddenly there was just….screaming. And fire, and smoke and screaming. And guns, so much shooting, we had to change direction I had no idea where we were\" her words were breathy, They could see the smoke from where they stood. She could see more and more agents piling onto the roof. Everything was left behind, from her books to her shoes that she'd abandoned. Mack was running ahead of them, gun trained upwards. Jackson and Riley on either side of her pushing her faster, further, \"Everyone just started dying. The plane was above us and there was dirt everywhere, we couldn't see\" \"Then the …\" she stopped for a moment to swallow a lump in her throat, \"The ….\" She caught his eyes trying to find the words, \"Take a breath abs\" \"The monument came down …..it just…the plane hit it I think, it was on fire and it just fell it was so loud. The plane …I don't know where it went, it must have crashed I…\" The smoke was thick and Jackson had almost forced his body over her own. They were still running. She coughed, heaving in a breath, everything tasted like smoke, tasted like blood. They moved passed a body…..a man, his white shirt stained red. Riley pulled on her arm but her head couldn't compute what they'd said. The building had been shot at….. parts were crumbling before her eyes….Connor. \"It all happened so fast…..but we thought it was over...it was so quiet after …it was….\" She looked up at Mike who nodded encouragingly, \"They decided to go in, get Connor and me down together in a safe house. Then there was this huge bang\" Mike remembered the bus explosion, he'd been standing outside the gates, \"And then everything really started\" he remembered being thrown into the air, the men who looked like tourists heading for the gate, blowing it apart, his ears ringing, everything ringing. The world spinning. \"Everything just started exploding around us\" he remembered the grenades, the bazookas. \"The fences just…weren't there and then Riley….I don't even know what happened to him but Jackson threw me sideways and then we were running even faster. We had to go to the house there was nowhere else to run. We couldn't see anything, everyone was screaming again\" Jacksons grip on her arms were vicelike but on the other hand she knew they were probably one of the only thing holding her upright. She craned her head back peering through the smoke as more agents surrounded them and it was then, just through the smoke, through the bodies she saw a group of people, masks over their head. A skeletal mask turned their way one with a smiling jaw that would be engraved in her mind forever and she was hurled forwards again, Mack pulling her forward. The gun shots were close. Her legs felt heavy, as if she were running but getting nowhere, as if the ground was moving against her. \"We ran for the back house, the green house bit. We got behind the concrete wall. I couldn't hear anything there were too many people. One of the security guys had been shot, I tried to fix it but I….it was too much blood and then they pulled me away from him and he just…\" she shook her head, She looked up and swallowed a scream as she was wrenched away from the building and hurled to the ground. There was a heavy body atop of hers but when she looked up once more the concrete had been obliterated and was just dust on the ground, dust and bodies. She was pulled up again and they ran…again…her lungs were screaming. It sounded as if there were missiles going off above them and the ground was cracking open to swallow the world. \"They were all just dead. \"Jackson grabbed me and was pushing me inside and then he fell….he was heavy, and there was so much blood, they shot him in the throat and the thigh, must have caught an artery because…so much blood. He was heavy, I pushed him off me and tried to run inside there were people everywhere, screaming. Another agent saw me, he was inside and he ran out and he just …they just shot him, he was just gone….because of me\" \"Hey\" he whispered fiercely, sitting up on his knees so he could crouch closer to her, \"You listen to me that's our job, alright, we took this job, this is not your fault, Abs that was not your fault\" \"But if he hadn't been coming bac—\" \"Abby everybody's dead\" at his blunt whisper she froze knowing…knowing it was true. She'd stepped over the bodies herself, carried Connor over them. \"Not one of those deaths are your fault do you understand me\" she held his gaze for several moments before nodding slightly, \"I got up to Connors room but he was coming down the hall, we started running towards the panic room, Connors security were still there and Mack and some others and then….then the windows… they just shattered. Someone tackled us to the ground and Connor was under me and Micks face…\" she shook her head once more, \"What happened next Abs?\" he asked distracting her from the image he had no doubt was violent and gruesome, \"There was so much glass everywhere, and smoke\" Mike looked down at her feet, still bare and bleeding. He wondered if she would feel the pain then but she was yet to say anything. He supposed it was the shock and the fact that her mind had many other things that demanded its attention each second. There was no room to feel pain, he understood that. The agent noted the need to find her some shoes. She left Mick behind, what was left of him anyway. Connor's eyes had landed on another ghastly sight and he'd frozen leaving her to grasp his arms and drag him forward with all her strength. Two men were shouting for them further up the hall and she pulled Connor. With every movement her side screamed with pain but there was no time to check, not when more glass was exploding around them. Not when the walls were crumbling, not when people around them were dropping and not getting back up. The walls were stained and speckled with red, with dripping handprints, and were peppered with holes. Finally they made it to the end of the corridor although how they had she'd little idea. Connor was pulled into the arms of another man while she was collected by two others and they began to run once more. She wanted to stop, she had a burning stitch and her side was screaming…and wet. It was quiet for several moments, seconds, how long she didn't know. It was still loud but in the distance, as if she were underwater, as if she were drowning. She could hear the men around her, ones she'd not seen before, speaking fast and purposefully into their sleeves. And then all of a sudden the masks entered her vision. At the end of the hall two of them were in front of them and the shooting started. Both she and Connor were thrown backwards and hit the ground hard as the others all but created a wall in front of them. A wall that would ultimately fall. One of the men continued to push them backwards, \" RUN\" he roared towards them and followed just behind them. Too soon though he fell his hand hitting the back of her leg on the way down. She gripped Connors hand hearing heavy footsteps behind them and then suddenly she was tugged sideways by her little brother. They escaped into a room and then Connor was quick to pull a cupboard open and they slid behind another wall. She'd not known about this one. Her chest was heavy as she kept her brother behind her. They were going to die. \"We stayed in there for…..I don't know…it felt like forever. There was banging everywhere, things exploding, yelling. We just stayed there. And then all of a sudden it got really hot, really hot\" she said and Mike nodded at her, \"I opened the door and the room was on fire, we had to get out\" We headed towards the south wing and went through the kitchens. We agreed to go to the Lincoln bedroom\" She'd pushed Connor behind the pantry as she peered around the entrance. There were bodies everywhere. She locked eyes with one of the men whose body lay over another woman she recognised to be Amanda who worked in the kitchens. His eyes widened as he laid eyes on her and he reached towards her. She moved swiftly across the room towards him, \" Abigail you need to get somewhere safe\" his voice was rough, he was gasping for air. She nodded, \" Take your brother try to get to the safe house, don't stop for anyone okay, someone will find you I promise. Don't try to go outside though okay, stay inside, stay hidden\" she nodded as she placed a hand over his chest, \" I'm okay...I want you to go now\" she nodded her eyes unfocused, unfocused on him too focused on the blood that was escaping him….painting her hands. \" Abigail\" his voice called her back but it wasn't until there was a hand on her back that she startled spinning around…Connor. His eyes were wide and trying to stay focused on her face. She stood in front of him, moving her own body to block out the ghastly view he was too young to see. He pointed to the door where they had come in and fear began to poison her blood as she realised what he was so scared about. \" Go the both of you go now\" the agent behind them ordered and she nodded towards him grabbing Connor and running. Two corridors later they heard the single deafening shot and his cry of pain. \"We got to the bedroom….there were already people dead in there…two agents and one of the guys in a mask\" Mike watched her carefully, despising the haunted look of her eyes, \"I stayed at the door watching for anyone while Connor opened the wall\" her voice was so quiet he almost had to lean forward and he watched her hands begin to shake, her shoulders tensed and raised. \"I thought they were all dead Mike\" she looked up at him her eyes wide, in the moment once more and he shuffled forward and placed a hand on her knee, \"What happened Abby?\" \"I was watching the door – Her eyes were trained on both halls, they could come from anywhere. Her eyes, her ears strained to see, to hear anything at all that a fierce headache was beginning to erupt in the temples of her head. She turned to see Connor struggling slightly, his nerves getting the best of him, \" Quick Con\" she encouraged and he nodded his eyes never leaving the latch. It was as she turned back t o the door she caught the slight movement. The man on the floor slumped against the wall, a sheen of blood behind him staining the white wall causing her stomach to flip. His head hung forward, mask still firmly hiding his face and a pool of blood, almost black on the carpet beneath him…but his hand…his fingers twitched and her heart stopped. She watched the gun that lay listlessly in his hand raise and point….for a millisecond her eyes followed its path and her heart jumped out of her throat while colour erupted behind her eyes. She fell to her knees, feeling the glass embed itself in her skin before her hands reached for the closest agent….reached for the gun in his hands, the gun….her fingers closed around it and there was no time. No time to second guess, no time to panic that she was holding a gun in her hands, a real one, no time to think about how she was holding it, no time to line up a shot accurately, no time to think, no time to breathe, only time for her fingers to find the trigger and pull. Two shots went off. Her eyes welled within seconds making the room, everything become blurred. \" Abby…Abby\" Connors hysterical voice was the only thing to breach her silent mind. She looked to him and she could see his shock. Past him her eyes found the hole in the wall….from his gun. She looked down at her hands, still painted red, now holding a gun, clenched between her fingers. Her eyes flicked up only to see the man now slumped further down – the pool of blood growing, his fingers weren't moving. Her breath caught in her throat, \" Abby come on…please\" Connors voice of reason pulled her up. She didn't let go of the small gun, taking it with her as they climbed into the wall. As she pulled the latch back behind her, her eyes caught sight of the man once more…the disgusting mask still in place but not hiding his vacant eyes. A shot of anger fired through her veins as the loathing set in – at him….at him for making her pick up the gun, for making her pull the trigger, for daring to point one at her brother. Her eyes narrowed as she fixed the wall in place and for the moment she allowed her anger to soothe her shock, her panic, her fear, and distract her from the impossible question of what to do next. She looked up at Mike whose eyes were on her own. There was no anger anymore, not in her, it was just heaviness now. \"You saved his life Abs, you saved Connor\" from his tone Abby decided that Mike had enough anger for the two of them, though she knew it wasn't aimed at her. She gripped his hand for one momentattempting to take comfort in his words. She respected the man, trusted him…with her life…with Connors and her Dads. Hell, as weird as it sounded he'd practically been her best friend since she was 5. Her only friend. \"Abs remember what I said about you and I getting through this okay…we'll deal with everything when we get out of here but for now we need to stay focused right\" she nodded pulling herself back into the present. \"I'm fine\" he smiled, \"You always are\" \"What's the plan then?\" she asked her hand still gripping his own. She watched his eyes flicker continuously from her face to the door and back again, \"Well since they've taken our eyes away\" he said gesturing to the fact that they were sitting in the darkness, \"Lets go take away theirs and see if we can find out where these assholes have set up\" he stood nodding at her and then turned as he readied himself to pull her to her feet a serious look on his face, \"Don't you repeat that word Abigail, it's a bad word\" he said as he used to years before when she came up only to his waist, she rolled her eyes and pushed him slightly only to have him grin cheekily at her. \"Alright Abs listen up\" his voice was still a whisper as he looked down at her, \"I want you to take this okay\" he said and she realised he was holding the gun he'd taken off her what seemed to be hours ago now. She frowned, \"I'm going to do everything in my power to make sure you don't have to use it Abs, but if it comes down to it and someone's pointing a gun at you I don't want you to hesitate ok\" she looked up at him and swallowed the lump in her throat, \"Abs I need your help okay…to keep you alive and to get all of us out of here\" she nodded at him but was still unsure of how or what she could possibly do to help him, \"Ok\" \"I want you to stay behind me and don't look up at the camera's okay…I know you know where most of them are that will help us out\" \"Oh and you don't, secret service?\" She asked disbelievingly and he smiled, \"Alright then let's go. And Abs\" he turned back to her seriously, \"If something happens to m-\" \"Mike don't\" she interrupted him, shaking her head which was quickly held still by his large hands, \"Abby if something happens to me, take your gun, shoot anyone and everyone – don't give them a chance to hurt you. I want you to get to a bunker or a safe house or somewhere and hide. Take my phone and they'll talk you through everything\" the scowl that contorted her features only deepened at his words, \"You priority isn't to save my life right now Mike, you have to stay alive so that you can save my Dad and at this rate probably the whole of America\" she stated fiercely. He simply chuckled lightly, although there was little humour, \"No pressure then right kid?\" Thank you so much to everyone who followed and favourited the story.

Thank you for reading![Chapter 3] First Daughter Chapter 3 They moved silently down the hall. He'd instructed her to keep her head down, avoid the camera's, and they'd pulled her hair inside her jacket. The lights had gone down making it near impossible to tell who was who. Her lungs stung with each breath of smoke and blood. She stayed close to him, barely steps away, as he led her through the white house – through the building she spent a good portion of her time in - of her life in. Her knees felt shaky as she held herself up on them. Her heartbeat still loud in her ears. Her knees felt shaky – but not as much as her hands – her fingers clenched tightly around the small pistol as if it would stop them from trembling. Her eyes were down, only catching Mike's continuous glances up and down the hall from the corners of her eyes. She would have preferred to have looked up…studied the ceiling. Closed her eyes. Down was blood, and unmoving bodies. Down was red smeared walls and stained carpet. Down was empty vacant eyes and white mottled skin. Mike patted down the bodies they moved around, and over. She simply focused on getting over them without tripping over and without looking into their eyes or trying to identify them, or deciding if she knew them, or had seen them. She realised Mike had stopped and her heart accelerated once more. He crouched by another body, secret service, bloodied white shirt on bloodied cream carpet. She caught the movement of his shoulders tensing and his head bowing just slightly. His hands were spread on the mans chest and she closed her eyes for just one moment before looking up and down the hall – paranoia now a reality and a necessity. She recognised the fallen man as a long time member of her Dad's detail. Her chest seared as she thought of her Dad once more – hopefully safe, safe in the bunker. There was no way to get in after all. No way to breach the bunker…right? And they would have gotten him there, surely? Still...only hours beforehand she wouldn't have believed any of this nightmare was a reality. Mike's breath quickened, and became laboured and she watched him glance up at what she knew to be a security camera above them before back towards her. It was darkness that surrounded them but she could see the fire in his eyes, the anger, the betrayal. He stood and reached a hand towards her. She grasped it quickly and squeezed tightly…unsure if it was support she was offering or taking. They moved fast through the halls and she realised that her former secret service had decided his destination. It was much easier to move with him as her anchor. They moved down another hall, one she'd rarely ventured, and it wasn't long before he pushed her into a slight crevice in the wall. He placed a finger over his lips and she nodded wide-eyed. There was a dim panic setting in, was he leaving her there? Hadn't he told her it wasn't an option he would consider? Hadn't he said no? \"Wait here a moment\" he said, his voice less than a whisper, so quiet she didn't dare answer vocally. He squeezed her shoulder before gripping his gun tighter and moving into a room down the hall. A moment later came another sound that she could add to the array that would never be forgotten, never be erased from her memory. No gunshot….she supposed he'd opted for something quieter. It was a horrible metallic sound, steel sliding into a body. She could hear the mans muffled cries with each stab and her entire body stiffened almost contracting with each cry – as if it were her that the knife was sliding into. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven…. He couldn't survive surely. It was only then that she remembered that the aim was for him to not survive. There was no better option, no best case scenario. It was kill or die. A fight for survival at the most basic….kill for survival. By the time he returned she found the blood on his hands….similar to that on hers. She averted her eyes to his face and he cocked his head sideways questioningly. She simply gripped his hand others blood mingling and he pulled her towards the room. She noted two more guns tucked into his pants – she could still feel her small pistol clenched between her free fingers. It was only as they rounded into the room that she realised what her eyes had fixed upon. They were wider than ever and she simply reached forward to pluck it out of his pocket. Within seconds Mike had spun back around but she simply turned away from him to stare at the small squares in her hands. Two faces smiled up at her. Two faces, Two children. Connor and Abigail Asher. Her and Connor. Her and her brother. The president's children. Questions built fast, too fast for her mind to catch up… Had they been after them? Why did they want them? Ransom? Bargaining? What would they have done to them? Would they ever have gotten back? What would her Dad had to have done to get them back? Would they have died anyway? Would they have killed Connor first…or her? Would they have hurt them? What would she have done? Mike spun her around and gently pulled the photos from her shaking fingers startling her from her thoughts once more. She started up at him and he curved his spine to look into her eyes, \"He's safe Abs…you and I know that. He's safe he's okay, he's out. And you're going to be fine, we're going to be alright – that's all that matters right?\" she almost had to lean forward to hear his words but she nodded – dazed but feeling his words slowly sink in. Her brain slowly interpret them as if they were another language. She allowed her body to lean heavily against the wall as he pulled away. Her eyes skittishly moving between Mike and the door. What if more of them came, what if they were watching them now. Mike was moving fast yet silently, her eyes were wide but she couldn't work out what he was doing. She focused on the screen above Mike's head and her eyes widened even more as she looked at the small windows on the screens she knew belonged to the many surveillance cameras planted around the house. She looked at the damage, the devastation, the bodies. \"They've taken away our eyes so let's take away theirs, hey?\" She looked at the man beside her only then realising she'd managed to take several steps towards him to see the screen better. She nodded and watched as the screens began to go black one by one. She felt a wave of satisfaction wash through her –even if it was just for a second – a small victory. \"Okay let's go visit your Dad's office then\" she felt her throat tighten, but nodded. She felt safe in this room, she'd be happy to just shut the door and stay there forever. It was better than alternatively wandering through the halls waiting to run into someone. Connor's face flickered into her mind and then her Dad – she had to get to him, or more to the point help Mike get to him. She couldn't hold him back, couldn't slow him down. She had to do it for Connor – he couldn't lose his Dad, not as well. Her little brother had barely known their mother – Abby's eyes prickled for a moment as her blood turned icy. She knew the part she'd played in causing her brother to lose his mother so young, she'd done that, so now she had to make sure that he would at least still have his father. She was pulled from her thoughts as Mike moved, tugging her by the hand. She followed behind him her neck craning to look over her shoulder – her heart in her throat. I'm baaaaack. Hope you guys enjoyed the update -sorry it's a bit short.

He and Melissa had happened so fast -but maybe, intentionally fast. He remembers his state of mind after that final fight with Jo; he wanted to prove he didn't need her, much less want her. So he'd walked out, took his truck, and drove. He stayed at one of the many crappy motels in the area, drowned his sorrows, and resigned himself to the fact that he needed a change; as it was, his life clearly wasn't working. Within two weeks, he had the divorce papers drawn up. A month after that, he'd met Melissa… and a change she was. A blessed, beautiful change that Bill couldn't let go of. Looking back, he knows why she caught his eye. She was strong and smart -he at least had enough sense to realize those qualities were mandatory in a partner- but more importantly, so, so different from Jo. Melissa was an open book who communicated well and wanted a normal life. She wore her heart on her sleeve and hated passive aggressiveness. She was simple, and being with her was easy. Their first fight was over something so stupid he doesn't even remember what it was about. When his voice had started to raise a few decibels, she'd lowered hers and actively calmed him down; they resolved the issue within minutes. His first fight -and subsequent fights- with Jo had all been massive blowouts in which she'd eventually storm away, leaving him fuming. She'd always come home and never apologize, which meant usually he would. Which, looking back, Bill supposes they were both at equal fault for their spats -something he came to realize from Melissa. Because for as headstrong as Jo is, he knows he can be equally so. That was always part of the problem: neither wanted to admit defeat or surrender. Which is why it wasn't a surprise when he'd found her and her team and she hadn't signed the damn papers. Then again, when he'd given them to her in December, he'd half expected her to sign them immediately as a way of telling him she'd be fine without him, that she didn't care about him enough to fight for their marriage -and Lord knew they fought over everything else except to stay together. But she loves him, always did, and he can see that now. It makes him feel like a pompous ass, because he was truly miserable to be with in the end. The grant money was running out, and they hadn't made any recent progress in their research. Jo was nervous; that much was obvious, and even then, he was never that oblivious to her feelings. She'd even gone as far to admit she was nervous. That alone should've been his first clue that he should've taken a deep breath and been the supportive husband she rarely let him be. But no, he had to go and say some truly awful things about her research plans, her work, and even herself as a person. He isn't proud of it, and on days like today when she's smiling and laughing with him, he hates himself for what he did. In his mind, she'd been hurting him with the way she pushed him away -and he doesn't think her intention was ever to hurt him, which makes him feel doubly guilty- so in a moment in which she was letting him in, letting herself be vulnerable, he'd gone in for the kill. He'd immediately regretted his tirade as soon as he was done; all the nights that she'd woken up in a panic from a nightmare had flashed through his mind. In the dark of night, he'd always longed to comfort her and if he couldn't ease her pain, then at least be there with her until it subsided. But she'd always tell him she was fine and to go back to sleep. During the early months of their relationship, he would try to coax her into telling him what her mind tormented her with, even though he had a pretty good idea. She'd shake her head, tell him she didn't remember. It was a big fat lie -and she can't lie for shit- but he never called her out on it. But as the months drew on, she still never told him, and eventually he gave up asking. He would pretend to have fallen back asleep when he'd feel her curl into a ball facing away from him, and cry silently. Even when things got really bad between them, the nights when her dreams were so horrible they drove her to tears, his heart never stopped breaking for her. Maybe that should've been his first clue that he, too, loved her and always would. He remembers the night she told him about what happened to her dad. They'd been dating for five months and he wanted to propose. Problem was, every time he brought up meeting her parents (she'd met his, after all) she'd come up with some excuse not to. Naturally, Bill was upset. He wanted to do things the right way and ask her father for permission to marry her. Jo didn't know this. Like most things, she was oblivious to his plans. So finally he pushed and pushed because he didn't want to wait any longer. Instead of a romantic candlelit dinner and a carefully planned declaration of love, he blurt out how he'd really like to marry her, he's had the ring for a month, but can't ask her dad till he meets him, so could she please arrange for that because he was getting mightily impatient. Per usual, his words were laced with sarcasm, but he truly did mean each and every one of them. She'd gone quiet, misty eyed in a way he hadn't expected, and looked absolutely dumbfounded that he was thinking of marriage. They'd both been so caught up in the passion, in the work, but she'd always been short sighted, focusing on the present while he liked to plan. He'd known she and her mom weren't on the best of terms but surely they could all handle a few hours together for the wedding. He remembers the hopeful, boyish grin he'd flashed at her, prodding her to say something . And so she stuttered and sputtered, floundering to come up with an appropriate response. He'd gotten nervous, because while they certainly demonstrated their love for each other on a nightly basis, a proposal was never a sure thing. And so she'd said yes, followed by the explanation for the riff with her mother: After her father's death, her mom slowly lost it. First, she had tried to pack six year old Jo up and move clear across the country to New Hampshire in an attempt to make sure she'd never lose Jo the way she'd lost her husband. Jo had protested, but her mother ignored her pleas. Turned out, it didn't matter; she couldn't afford to move 1,700 miles away. So, they'd stayed put, but Mama Thornton spent her days anxious and terrified of when the next storm would hit. To cope, she'd regularly have a drink to help her sleep at night. By the time she was 8, her mother's drinking had become more than the occasional nightcap. By 12, Jo couldn't remember a time when her mother wasn't drunk. It was also around the time she started getting into fights at school. All of her report cards -that her mother never read- stated that she was a brilliant young lady, but if she could just get her temper under control, the sky would be the limit for her. The first time her mother slapped her, she finally told the school what was going on. When given the choice between getting to keep her daughter or her liquor, Mama Thornton handed Jo, the daughter she was once so terrified of losing, over to Meg without a fight. Under her father's sister's care, Jo managed to learn how to resolve her problems without resorting to violence, and graduated fifth in her high school class. Bill had felt like an ass, of course, because he'd badgered her incessantly about her parents. He remembers how she'd tried to be nonchalant about it, so as to spare him the pain of knowing how much she was hurting. For once, they didn't fight that night. Instead, she continued to talk. She'd asked him not to tell anyone on the team because she believed they would look at her differently. He'd wanted to argue and tell her that no one would, but he chose to simply kiss the top of her head and assure her that he didn't think any less of her. He was quite proud of himself for having said the right thing when she smiled. Six months after their wedding, they'd gotten a phone call saying her mother had died of liver failure. It was sudden -she'd seemed relatively healthy at the wedding, which she'd actually stayed more or less sober for- and for once in his life, Bill felt completely helpless. His own parents were happily married and in great health. They had her body cremated and flown to their current state of residence so that her ashes could be scattered on the same land that her father's body had never been recovered from. For a few months, Jo was quieter than usual, and it had worried him. She insisted on visiting Aunt Meg every other weekend, even if it meant missing a storm. At first, Bill took it as a good sign, that she was finally shifting her priorities to her family. But then she started snapping at the team over the smallest of things, and Bill took it upon himself to try to fix it. If there was one thing he couldn't stand, it was when someone got their head bitten off for a minor transgression. Their implosion was inevitable. They never took any time off, hell, they'd even worked through their honeymoon, though they enjoyed the work itself. But the arguments shifted from personal to professional, then both at once. He left Jo, he left the team, and tried to make a new life for himself. Perhaps it was selfish of him, but he has mostly forgiven himself for that. After all, he did come back. In February, he had gotten a report from Dusty about how things were going; the team itself was getting by without him, but they missed him. Jo insisted she was fine, but lashed out more frequently than she usually did. For Bill, he'd thought that was the deal breaker. If she had given any voluntary indication that she loved him more than she loved her damn tornadoes, he would've gone back. But apparently, she didn't. And so he stayed with Melissa, even as doubt started to creep into the back of his mind about their relationship. It was the little things, like how she always asked him to kill the spiders, or how she was happy to go with the flow, or the way she cried during sad or romantic movies -he tried to be patient, he really did, but he could never understand why she'd insist on watching those movies (that he had no interest in seeing) if all they did was make her sad. She had a hard time understanding his sarcasm, and she took forever to get ready, even for something as simple as going for brunch -God, and the way she called him Billy . He knew he'd wanted a change but, well, it was a lot . There were moments when he found himself wishing Melissa was tougher, wittier… wished she would get mad, challenge him in some way. As the months drew on, the change he so desperately sought started to weigh on him. Still, he'd proposed to her, promised her a life together, and he was hell bent on staying committed to her (he used to ignore the little voice that said it was because Jo could never fully commit to him). He's just glad that he and Melissa escaped without too much heartbreak. Mostly, though, he's grateful that his early midlife crisis showed him that he can't live without Jo. Having been successful at getting Dorothy to fly, they've fought less, mainly because Jo has stopped being quite so neurotically obsessive. She's content to run the lab (he'd given in to her on that, since she's the one with the Ph.D.) while he analyzes the data, although it really is a group effort of everyone on the team. They still chase for fun, but their main focus is on the data -and themselves. Holidays and their anniversary are not to be spent chasing. When they're about to argue, they go into separate rooms to write down their thoughts for no more than fifteen minutes then come back together to talk it out civilly. The team doesn't know what to do with the newfound quiet, leading to Dusty blasting his music louder than usual. No one complains, though, because they're all so grateful to have the Hardings back to the way they were before the almost-divorce. Bill likes to think of themselves as a twister: beautiful, powerful, and destructive all at once. And just as the conditions will always come together to create a perfect storm, he and Jo will always come back to each other to unleash all they have to offer –all of the chaos and uncertainty- onto each other, and onto the world; for after the storm comes a peace and tranquility unlike any other. Something always brings me back to you. It never takes too long. A/N: hello readers! I seriously appreciate anyone who's taken the time to read this piece –I haven't published anything in exactly a year and a half, as of today, and I've been working on writing this for close to six months. This was originally supposed to be a one-shot, but I'm considering adding additional stand-alone chapters (that could also be loosely related to this first one) because I just love this movie and these characters, and I have so many thoughts about it/them.

Enjoy It's been 3 years since Dorothy went up into the tornado and recorded some of the most influential scientific data of her time. During the first year after their success, Bill, Jo and their team of storm chasers worked on not only analyzing that data that Dorothy supplied, but they also started making modifications on the instrument, which they called Dorothy 2,that would be heavy enough for the tornados to pick up yet small enough to make it more portable. Unable to come up with a good design within the year long time frame that they had, Dorothy 2 was put on the back burner. With their data analysis coming to an end, the team decided to take a break, clear their minds, and come back and attack Dorothy 2's design full force. Jo did not sign the divorce papers, in fact, she and Bill decided that they would instead work on solving their differences. After their near death experience, they realized that they not only make a great team, but they were also perfect for each other and not ready to give up the fight. They eventually had a child, Mathieu, who is now 3 years old. In the spring of 1999, Jo and Bill decided it was time to get the team back together and see what kind of solutions their loyal friends came up with for Dorothy 2. Their meeting place: Aunt Meg's newly built home in Wakita, complete with tornado shelter. Bill and Jo were the first to arrive with little Mathieu in tow. Aunt Meg was on the porch, eagerly awaiting their arrival. \"You're late!\" Meg exclaimed. \"Now hand over that little fella. I haven't seen him since he was born!\" she said, taking Mathieu and hugging him tightly. \"Are any of the others here yet?\" Jo asked. \"No,\" Meg responded as she hugged Mathieu tightly. \"But Dusty called and put in his order for lunch!\" she laughed. \"Speak of the Devil..\" Bill said, looking toward the end of the road. They could hear \"Highway to Hell\" blasting from the vehicle that was barreling down the road. They all waited on the lawn for Dusty to pull up in the driveway. The beat up old bus barely stopped before he jumped out and almost tackled Bill to the ground with a giant bear hug. \"Duuuuuudes! I can't tell you how excited I was when you called!\" Dusty yelled, moving on to give Jo a hug. \"What happened to that Swedish chick, Dust-man?\", Bill asked. \"She seemed nice.\" \"Well, it turns out that she just needed someone to marry to stay in the United States. But c'est la vie!\" Dusty laughed. \"Mother nature has always been my favorite lady. I think I'll stick with her from now on!\" \"Oh Dusty, I'm so sorry. I know you really cared about her.\" Jo said, with a sympathetic look. Dusty shrugged and smiled, obviously wanting to get away from the subject. \"So. That must be Mathieu.\" He said, nodding toward the sleeping child who was still in Meg's arms. \"And Aunt Meg, fantastic to see you as always sweetheart.\" He smiled and hugged her gently, as not to wake the sleeping child. \"Oh Dusty, it's been way too long\" she smiled, giving him a kiss on the cheek. \"So Dusty, there's something we would like to ask you before everyone else gets here.\" Bill said, as he grabbed some papers out of the blue dodge truck. \"Oh yeah? Go for it, dude.\" \"We want you to be Mathieu's God father\" Jo said quickly, as if ripping off a band-aide. \"You want me to what now?\" Dusty said, laughing uncomfortably. \"Dusty, we need to you do some research. Dusty, we don't think you should be part of the team anymore. Those would be 'normal' things to say to me at this point. But you want me to what!?\" \"We want you to be Mathieu's God father. We couldn't think of anyone else fit for the job, Dusty.\" Bill said, looking at him hopefully. Dusty stood there quietly, which was unusual for him, and looked at the ground, trying to make sense of what his two best friends were asking of him. \"We call him Dusty.\" Jo said, smiling at him. Dusty looked up at them bewildered. \"What?\" he asked quietly. \"Mathieu Dustin Harding.\" Bill said. They were all silent for a moment. \"I think you broke him, Bill. In all the years we've known him, Dusty has never been speechless.\" Jo laughed. \"My friends…It would be an honor to be the God father of the son of The Extreme and the most bad-ass woman I know,\" Dusty said as he dropped down to one knee and bowed before them. \"Dusty, get up. There is no need for theatrics.\" Bill sighed. \"So who's his God mother? Is she hot?\" Dusty asked with a chuckle. \"Wait and see for yourself\" Jo said, winking at Dusty. \"She's on her way. She's one of the new additions to our team.\" \"Can't wait.\" Dusty smiled. \"In the meantime...how about some grubbage? Aunt Meg?\" \"In the oven. It will be ready shortly.\" Meg laughed. The four adults and small child made their way into the house and immediate gravitated toward the kitchen where the smell of roast beef excited their olfactory senses. Dusty immediately grabbed a plate and took the roast out of the oven to dig in. \"Can I grab anyone else a plate\" he asked politely, in hopes he wouldn't seem too desperate for a home-cooked meal. Both Jo and Bill nodded their heads. Dusty put three plates together with roast beef, mashed potatoes, Aunt Meg's famous gravy, and some broccoli and delivered them to the dining room table. \"So about this new contraption. You guys have a prototype already?\" Dusty asked with a mouth full of roast beef. \"Yeah, Jo, Savannah, and myself have been working on it for a while. We made her a little smaller for better transportation for us, and quite a bit heavier so the tornado can pick her up without a problem. The smaller size makes us able to carry more, as well, which is pretty neat.\" Bill explained. \"The devices inside are also quite a bit smaller and more aerodynamic so we should be able to get better readings.\" Jo added. \"If you called I woulda come out and..\" \"I know Dusty. We just wanted to give you guys some time off.\" Bill interrupted. \"Excuse me. I was knocking on the door, but no one answered so I let myself in. I hope that's alright.\" a small redheaded young woman said as she made her way into the dining room. \"Savannah! You know better than to knock!\" Meg exclaimed \"I haven't seen you in years! It's so nice to see your face. I'm very excited to see you working with Jo again!\" \"How many times do I have to tell you, Aunt Meg,\" Savannah sighed. \"Call me Storm.\" \"Yes ma'am.\" Meg laughed. Savannah \"Storm\" Swanson while petite, often controlled a room with her large and often explosive personality which complimented her bright red, shoulder length hair very well. \"Storm, I'm glad you made it! We're still missing quite a few people, but let me introduce you to Dusty.\" \"Pleasure to make your acquaintance.\" Dusty said, taking her hand and kissing it lightly, getting a small bit of gravy on it. Storm quickly snapped her hand away and wiped the gravy off her hand. \"This is who you named your child after?\" she asked with a disturbed look on her face. \"Dusty is a little...unusual, yes\" Bill explained. \"But he knows his tornados and he's been a friend of mine since before college.\" \"He can be a little..eccentric.\" Jo added. \"I'm right here guys…\" Dusty said. Storm rolled her eyes as she grabbed a plate of food for herself and took a seat next to Jo, who was trying to get Mathieu to eat some mashed potatoes. As they ate and chatted about random things, people started to trickle in. Haynes and Beltzer were the next to arrive, freshly married and excited to get to work. Rabbit and Allen were the next to arrive, brand new laminated maps in tow. Finally, Preacher showed up, blaming the Hand of God for his tardiness. Once everyone made it safely to Meg's house and filled their bellies, the team started work on their plan to send the new and improved Dorothy 2 up into the air. ","Summary":" ~~A/N.

Because it is an older story, the characters might be a little OOC. t was December. Jo and Bill had just split up, and Jo was driving down the highway in her Yellow Jeep pickup with Dark Blue stripes on the side. Alot of things went through Jo's mind, and tears were flowing down the sides of her cheeks. How would she tell all of her friends, her team, that Bill had left them all? She no longer could stay with Bill at his house, so she was on her way out to a farm on the countryside of Oklahoma to stay at. She saw that her fuel gage on her truck was almost empty, so she exited the freeway, and she pulled into a truckstop. She filled up her truck with fuel, and then she went to pay the cashier some cash. She didn't leave after that. Instead of going to the truck, she went for a long walk. It was cold that evening, and Jo had forgotten her jacket in her truck, but she didn't care enough to go and retrive it. She didn't care at this point. All she wanted was some piece to get through what she had just went through. She heard that earlier that day, there had been a couple of storms, but she didn't bother to go and chase them. It was winter, and she didn't chase in the winter,as storms were very rare. She was also very depressed. Jo then heard the cars on the road pass her by, but she didn't care. She then sat down, and she looked up at the Gray, Dull, sky. She would shut her eyes, just for a moment... A couple minutes later, Jo got up, and she walked even further away from the truck stop. She didn't know how far that she would walk, but again, she could care less today. She heard a car stop, and she turned around. It was a familer Black chevy Van that she was used to seeing when the teams would challenge each other, and try to see who would get to the storms first. She stood there puzzled to why it would be stopped there like that, but then she saw someone familer step out of the Van. It was Jonas! Jo thought what could he possibly want, and she started to walk away, but Jonas soon caught up with her. \"Hey, Jo. What are you doing walking on the side of the road like this? Shouldn't you be at home?\" He asked her. Jo tried to hold back her tears. \"Why would you even ask me that? I thought you only cared for yourself.\" Jo scoffed. Jonas was shocked by her response.\"Jo? Because I was concerned when I saw you walking on the side of the road, and that is not normal for people to do that. When I saw you walking on the side of the road, I thought I would see how you were doing.\" Jonas assured her. Jo was surpriesed by what he had just said, but she wasn't buying what he was saying. \"I still don't get why you would even care.\" Jo told him, shoving him aside. Jonas saw Jo walk away from him, and she was shivering cold, he could tell. Jonas started to take off his coat he had wore for the evening. He caught up with Jo again, and He told her, \"Jo, you look very cold, and walking in the freezing cold is not good for your health. Here, take my coat. \" Jo was shocked by what Jonas just did, because that was just not like him to do something like that. She took his coat, and she put it on. \"Thank you, Jonas. That was very sweet of you.\" She smiled. Jonas smiled back. \"No problem. Jo, um I was wondering if you would want to have some Coffee with me.I can pay for us.\" Jonas asked, shyly. Jo thought to herself that he was still shy at asking her things, which she thought was good for a change, instead of him being arrogant. \"Sure, I'd love to.\" She replied. Jonas and Jo walked back towards the truck stop, and Jonas had signaled Eddie to pull up at the truck stop. The two had gotten there coffee's, and they found a spot alone that they could have their coffee. \"So Jo, tell me why you walked so far from the truck stop, when you have your own car, and you could of drove away.\" Jonas asked her. Jo hesitated to tell him. She thought that it was none of his buissness to ask her about that. \"I just wanted to take a long walk. There is nothing wrong with doing that.\" Jonas knew that She was hiding something from him. \"Alright. I believe you.\" He started, \"But why would you do that?\" He raised a brow at Jo, and Jo knew she would'nt get out of it, so Jo answered him. \"Me and Bill split up, and he had handed me divorce papers that I have to sign. I really don't want to sign them right now, but I have to sign them as soon as I can he told me.\" Jonas looked at her.\" I'm very sorry to hear that you and Bill split up.\" Jo sighed. \"It's fine. I'd be better off without him anyway. I still can't believe that he is gone! We had so many good memories together, but then, I don't know, something happend and we kept on fighting...\" Jonas put his hand on hers. Jo didn't say a word, but she was stunned. \"I know. At least you have a place to go, right? Have you told anyone else about this?\" Jo looked up at him. \" Yeah I have a place to go. A farm out in the countryside. I've told no one yet, accept you and my aunt Meg.\" Jo looked up at the sky, and saw that daylight was fading, and she had miles to drive still. She got up and threw her and Jona's coffee away. She then hugged Jonas. \"Thank you so much for being there for me today.\" She told him. Jonas heart had skipped a beat. He had never expected Jo to hug him. Jonas smiled at her. \" Anytime. Jo, just don't you ever feel afraid to talk to anyone, You just need to open your heart.\" She looked into his eyes. \"I will.\" Then before she could leave, Jonas pulled her close. He planted his lips firmly on hers, none of them saying a word. He then went towards his van, and left. Jo climbed into her truck, and she started to drive away. She thought to herself, blushing, that maybe Jonas wasn't as bad as she thought he was. Jonas had a goodside to him, and she had noticed it...

Because "},{"Movie":"Twister","Title":"Black Sheep","Author":"Castalle","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11463480","Passage":"[Chapter 1] Bill stared, mouth agape as the truck plummeted earthward, a sinking pit growing in his stomach as he was reminded in the worst possible way of just how powerless any of them were in the face of nature. He winced, expecting the worst, and was nearly rewarded with it. The truck slammed into the ground, disappearing beneath the tall corn. \"God...\" Jo whispered, flinching upon the impact. Bill stared at the receiver in his hand, hurling it into the dashboard, cursing loudly. Part of him wanted, then and there, to call the entire thing off. Jonas' team no doubt was in the vicinity, and he could only hope they hadn't seen the recent carnage firsthand. \"We tried.\" Jo said quietly, staring at the dashboard, doing her best to keep her eyes from wandering back to the distant impact site. \"There's nothing we could do.\" Helping Jo up, Bill glanced over the massive damage path that the twister had left in its wake, the mile wide trail that spread out across the plains digging deep into the ground. The remnants of the corn field that had been torn apart were nearly two miles from their location now, and seeing the tall stalks sent a sudden reminder to him, jolting him into action. \"Beltzer – car!\" he shouted, glancing back at Jo quickly, \"It's Jonas, I can't just leave them out there-\" Her confusion quickly turned to sympathy, the woman shaking her head, \"Bill, I don't think either of them could've survived that crash.\" \"I know, Jo, but...\" he glanced again at the distant field, \"We can't just leave it there. Shit, I wish Melissa was here with her phone – hey, Rabbit,\" the navigator turned at the sound of his name, walking towards Bill, \"Get your way to the nearest place with a working phone, get emergency crews out here.\" It didn't take any time for Rabbit to turn and call for Sanders, running to his truck and climbing in. Beltzer honked twice, grabbing Bill and Jo' attention as he motioned for them to hurry up. Bill began jogging towards the van, noticing Jo beside him. \"You don't have to come along.\" he said, climbing into the back of the van, turning sideways in the cramped space, \"I don't know how bad it's going to be.\" \"Well – you said it first Bill, we can't just not do anything.\" Jo responded, squeezing into the back of the van, pressing her back against Bill's chest to fit in and slide the door shut. Both of them were nearly thrown back as Beltzer took off without any warning, turning out of the ruined field and heading to the nearest road. The ride was silent for the most part, none of them finding anything to say as they got closer and closer to the crash site. Bill attempted to put his mind on the new data and models they could start developing, but the images of mangled cars and bodies forced him to gather up his courage for the grisly sight that was no doubt awaiting them. The telltale sound of corn stalks slapping against the sides of the van drew his attention momentarily, then created a deep knot in the pit of his stomach, the sounds indicating they were nearly there. He heard Beltzer mutter something under his breath, and glanced up, seeing the mangled, twisted wreckage sitting in the corn field. \"Oh – jesus..\" Bill mumbled, staring at the heap of metal that had once been a vehicle. The long cell tower was still sticking out of what must have been the front window at one point. The tower piece extended back through the wreckage, giving Bill a vague indication of which part of the catastrophe he was staring at was the front. \"You see any signs of his team?\" Beltzer asked, climbing out of the van. Bill and Jo were close behind, getting out and walking towards the wreckage. \"Not yet. You think they're going to come by or try to call somebody?\" Bill asked, moving towards the wreck, slowly walking around it, finding the front cab that had almost been bent in half. \"Who knows.\" Beltzer mumbled, squinting as he followed Bill. He squatted down at the shattered window, most of which was on the ground. Leaning forward to get a better look inside the cab, he jerked his head back quickly, standing. \"Might want to hold off on that, Bill.\" Bill could tell just by Beltzer's tone that whatever waited for him wasn't going to be easy. Of course, he hadn't expected it to be in the first place – but he knew Beltzer had been through some bad storms and seen more than his fair share of ugly scenes. Glancing at Jo, who shook her head lightly, Bill considered her advice. It was against his better judgment that he knelt down to the front of the car, placing a hand on the protruding tower piece and leaning into the cab. Regret came quickly, Bill bringing a hand over his mouth and nose as he felt his stomach lurch and turn over at the sight. Whatever was left of Eddie's stomach, chest, and everything else above the belt was going to have to be scraped out of the cab interior. The stench alone made Bill cringe and turn away, coughing several times before regaining his nerve and squatting down further to look deeper into the cab. A hanging arm caught his attention, and he hoped and prayed in the brief seconds he stared at Jonas' watch, that it was still attached to a body. Luckily it was, and the crumpled form of the doctor could be seen, shoved up against the ceiling of the twisted cab, his body thrown so violently upwards that it had been wedged between the bottom of the driver's seat and floorboard. Bill could tell that one or both legs were broken, twisted unnaturally in the small space they'd been forced into by brute force alone. Jonas' head was likewise hanging down, hidden by his upper arm until Bill had shifted slightly. Reaching towards Jonas' neck, he carefully searched for a pulse. Eyes widening after a few seconds, he turned his head, shouting to the other two. \"He's alive! One of you go out by the road to flag down the ambulance!\" Beltzer turned, rushing back to his van, speeding off back the way he'd came. Jo covered her mouth with a hand, dropping down on her knees to crawl down beside Bill. Keeping her eyes firmly averted from the splattered remnants of the driver, she crept in, reaching out and taking Jonas' hand in her own. \"Jonas,\" she said loudly, \"It's Jo, hey – are you there? You need to try and open your eyes alright? Jonas?\" The man's lips twitched and Jo quickly motioned for Bill to join her, the two braving the horrific carnage that coated the inside of the truck. Bill reached for Jonas' wrist, grasping it firmly, glancing at Jo before speaking as well. \"Jonas, it's Bill, just hang in there alright? Help's on the way, you just keep breathing, help's coming and it's gonna get you out of there. We're right here with you.\" The two stayed hunched beneath the bent cab for what seemed like almost an hour until they heard echoing sirens. Jo crept out of the truck, turning and rushing down the cornfield, waving her arms towards the approaching ambulance. Bill finally released Jonas' wrist, crawling out of the cab and moving away, letting the paramedics take his place as they observed the damage, speaking among each other quietly. Jo moved back to Bill's side, crossing her arms as they watched. One of the Paramedics stood up and walked over to them, while the other crawled further into the wrecked vehicle. \"Well we'll need the fire department to cut him out of there. Ya'll should head on out, we've got it from here – sorry you had to come upon that.\" She said, taking out a pair of latex gloves and pulling them on. \"What hospital will he be taken to? We're uh,\" Bill scratched the back of his neck, sighing, \"We actually used to work together, way back when. I'd like to visit him.\" \"We're gonna have a medevac take him to Tulsa, to the Hillcrest medical center. Probably gonna be another hour till the chopper gets here though, the weather being what it is still.\" \"Alright, thanks.\" Bill gave the wreck one last quick look before taking Jo's hand in his own, beginning to walk away from the scene. \"It's about an hour from Muskogee to Tulsa, once I'm all moved back, I want to check up on him.\" Jo brushed some hair out of her face, looking up at Bill. \"You're not feeling responsible about this, are you? If anyone's guilty for what happened, it was Jonas. He wouldn't listen, Bill. Talking to that man is like talking to a brick.\" \"I know, but this is still just...god it's just awful. Poor Eddie, he didn't even have a chance.\" \"They both knew what they were getting into. They've been doing this almost as long as we have. Everybody knows the risks when they get in the car.\" \"Are you really not that upset by all this?\" Bill asked, frowning as he looked down at Jo, \"It sounds like you're trying to convince me not to be upset.\" \"No, Bill, I just know how you are, I know you're going to find some way to feel responsible after the fact. But of all the things you can try and blame yourself for, this isn't one of them.\" Bill nodded halfheartedly, the two reaching the edge of the cornfield where Beltzer's van was waiting for them. \"Did Melissa get home?\" Jo asked, climbing into the back of the van. \"I don't know, I'll call tomorrow. More than likely she had to take a bus, lord knows how many of those are running with weather like this.\" \"Well, Bill, if there's something you want to feel guilty about I'd have to say it'd be dragging that woman along.\" Bill opted not to respond, but he knew Jo was right on the subject. The two huddled against each other as Beltzer drove them away from the corn field, the rest of their team's vehicles waiting for the van to pass, following along behind it once it had sped by. \"Yeah...yeah, sure.\" Bill said quietly, the phone wedged between his ear and shoulder as he scribbled quickly into a notebook, \"I'll be up in a few days to get my stuff, I just have to get insurance quotes...all that stuff, from the truck and whatnot. Thanks for all of this.\" Hanging up, Bill looked over to Jo, who was seated on the other end of the motel bed. \"You're not mad at me, are you?\" he asked, placing the phone down. Jo shook her head, looking down at the laptop that was balancing over her thighs. \"Bill, I'm not mad. Where's this sudden guilt stemming from?\" \"Christ I don't know.\" he mumbled, laying down on the bed, \"Things just happened so fast and now it's like – I have to sort it all out and try and find a way to make this work, and get my old job back.\" \"Well you know the department will be glad to have you back. Preacher's retiring soon and Joey is going to move on for his doctorate after next semester. We're so understaffed that I'm almost half a semester behind on grading papers, you can come on as my TA for a while then move up to assistant professor if you feel like it.\" \"You think so? Sounds like you all are pretty desperate.\" \"Well...\" Jo mumbled, typing quietly on the laptop, \"With this data that means a lot more grant money is going to start rolling in, and a lot more interest in the science. In a few more semesters we might not have to worry.\" \"That'd be nice.\" \"Mmmhm.\" Jo was quiet for a while longer before speaking again. \"How's Melissa? Did she get back safe?\" \"Yeah she's at the motel we stopped at for the night. I know she'll be glad to get back home.\" Jo quietly continued to type, pulling her glasses on and squinting at several lists that came up. The phone rang, causing both of them to jump slightly. Bill reached over, picking up the receiver. \"Yeah? Oh – when? Okay...\" Bill nodded several more times, listening, until hanging up. He looked over at Jo, starting to write on a fresh piece of paper. \"Alright, they flew Jonas in about 2 hours ago, said he's going to be in surgery until tomorrow. I can get in to see him in a few days.\" \"Before you know it, it'll be like old times.\" Jo chuckled, looking up from her work, \"You know he won't be happy to see you.\" \"Is he ever happy, is the real question.\" \"Probably was when he was stealing our work...\" Jo mumbled.

It came for her as penance, the punishment due her for every little infraction she has committed thus far in her young life…for all the little temper tantrums she's had, for all the eyeball rolls and weary sighs of injustice she has uttered when commanded to clean her room or help out around the farm, for pinching Katie Mulroney in kindergarten because Katie called her an idiot for wanting to play 'meteorologist' at recess instead of playing 'teacher'. It came for her because she is imperfect and flawed, not always the good little child promised by her thick blonde curls and bright blue eyes and freckles across her nose. But most of all it came for her because she wanted it to. She has always been fascinated by severe weather, ever since watching The Wizard Of Oz on tv and seeing the sepia-toned tornado sweep Dorothy's house off to another world that was full of eye-blinding bright color, and she revels in thunderstorms instead of being afraid of them like most children would be. She loves watching the wind whip the rain and the hail, sending it clattering against the roof of the farmhouse and the big metal silos, seeing the lightning streak across the sky with the thunder chasing behind it, and instead of crushing on David Cassidy, she crushes on KWTV's Gary England and can accurately imitate the shrill tonal beeps and sonorously serious announcements put out by the National Weather Bureau in Norman, Oklahoma. So when her father had mentioned earlier that afternoon that it was good tornado weather, she suddenly didn't mind the sweat that beaded upon her skin or the stagnant air that was almost too thick to breathe or the fact that the barn cats and hens seemed to be in a particularly foul mood that day, she felt her pulse quicken and she looked to the milky blue sky with elation, noticing the billowy pink-white thunderheads that marched upwards in the distance and she wished …oh God did she ever wish…that she'd actually get to see a real live tornado. And as the saying goes, be careful what you wish for, for it might come true. And it did. It came for her because she wanted it to, and her stomach twists as she thinks how just moments ago she avidly stared out of the cellar's small windows at the debris flying past, her blood thrilling at the violence of the twister, wondering what the inside of it looked like and what it felt like to be within it, communing and becoming part of it, and then… Instead of taking her, it took her father instead. And that is something she will have to live with for the rest of her life. Her mother sobs softly at her side, curled up into her own world of hurt and sorrow and loss, and as Jo's fingers knead Toby's fur like worry beads, she watches the rain and hail pour in through the missing shelter door, listening to the wind prowl about the open cellar in a keening mournful howl, a discontented beast still searching for prey to consume, driven to keep devouring whatever lies before it until it is fully satiated. She is painfully aware of the vacuum of silence that surrounds them…not of the noises that are, but of the noises that aren't, namely the reassurance of her father's booming voice, for any time they've had to hit the cellar, he's been the one to keep them all calm by telling silly jokes and stories in order to distract them from the danger outside. She cannot bring herself to look at the gaping hole where the cellar door used to be, for she knows that if she looks at it, she will see her father spinning up into the blank, black air, hand still clutched to the handle of the door, his mouth open in a soundless scream that was swallowed up by the roar of the wind and echoed back in her own screams. She leans forward and picks up one of the hailstones that has bounced across the red clay floor like a spunshot beebee, cupping the half-dollar sized orb of ice in her palm, feeling as frozen as it is, her emotions sucked out of her in the vortex that passed by outside, and she thinks she should be crying, raging… something …besides feeling like her insides are as iced over as the hailstone, her shock layering over her like the coats of frozen water covering the stone she holds in her palm. She studies it…her father always told her that the larger the hail, the more intense a storm would be, for bigger hailstones meant that the droplet of rain had been carried around and around inside of the storm, freezing and refreezing as it circulated until it finally was too heavy for the storm to carry and fell to earth. The outer layers of the stone are as clear as window glass, but the center is opaque and mysterious, hiding the secrets of the storm that spawned it, and she throws the stone hard against the dirt floor in an attempt to break the secrets, but all it does is shatter into shards and retain the mysteries of its birth. She fixes her gaze on a fat brown spider that lazily spins a web in the corner of the shelter, the spider untouched by the tragedy surrounding it, Mother Nature's blind ignorance to the suffering of others. She watches it as it bobs and weaves, waltzing as it constructs its home, the knowledge of arachnid architecture implicitly innate in its instincts as it delicately spins a strand here, twists a strand there, carefully building a death-trap of breathtaking beauty. And she is suddenly seized by a dark throttling hatred as she watches the spider's industry, for if she cannot have a home, neither shall the spider, so she picks up a hailstone and throws it at the web, the icy missile tearing a jagged hole through the lacy patchwork, sending the spider scurrying for safety behind the shelf of jarred preserves. \"Jo!\" her mother cries, startled out of her own misery by her daughter's violent action. \"What are you doing?\" \"It's not fair!\" Jo replies, pointing to the damaged web. \"That stupid spider can spin its dumb ol' home wherever it wants and no stupid tornado is gonna get it, but what about us? Where can we go that a tornado won't chase us?\" \"Oh, honey…\" Her mother wraps her arm Jo, pulling her tightly to her, and Jo can feel the warm rain of her mother's teardrops falling onto her head. She huddles in her mother's grasp, listening to her mother weep, her own emotions still frozen solid, and even when an hour later, rescuers arrive to remove them to safety, she feels as vacant and empty as the vortex that devoured her father. And that lack of emotion frightens her, for she's afraid she will forever be frozen, trapped like a fly within the amber of death and destruction. She and her mother return to the farm by daylight to see what is salvageable and they find that it is even worse than they expected, the two of them staring stunned at the wreckage of their lives that lies strewn before them, for there is nothing left…nothing left of what used to be a thriving farm except the shattered, scattered shards of buildings; nothing left but the shattered, scattered shards of what used to be a family. Being broken is the new normal that has been foisted onto her young self in less than 24 hours, being broken is the new normal she will have to live by from here on out. And she hates it. She stands next to her mother in their gravel driveway, a little blonde ragamuffin wearing too-tight sandals and a too-big sundress that came from the donation bin at the emergency shelter, listening to one of the neighbors telling her mother how sorry he is for their great loss, and she rolls the word around on her tongue, tasting it, trying it on for size…she is not unfamiliar with the concepts of death and loss, for death is what happened to one of the barn cats when her dad accidentally ran it over and loss is what happened to her pink coral bracelet when it fell into the bathroom at school, but she has never truly applied those terms to something as broad and devastating as losing her home and her father in one fell swoop, and she still feels hollow and vacant inside at all the sorrow surrounding her, unable to muster up anything but a faint echo of sadness whenever someone hugs her and tells her it's going to be all right. Because she knows it never WILL be all right, not now, not ever. Instead of being Jo the weather nut, she will now always be Josephine Mae Thornton, the little girl whose father was sucked right up into a tornado and seemingly disintegrated into the storm, becoming one with it, for his body will never be found. Her eyes search the wreckage of their farm for anything familiar…the big oak tree that held the tire swing her father hung up for her, the big red and white barn, the huge metal silos, the clapboard farmhouse and whitewashed chicken coop, the pole buildings and windmill and big John Deere tractor…but it looks like God took a giant egg beater to everything they owned, for the oak tree lies across the crumpled hulk of her dad's truck, its bark and leaves and limbs flayed from it in obscene nudity as its stump points an angry, jagged finger at the cheerful sky. The white clapboard farmhouse and outbuildings and barn lie in sharp shards of splintered wood and shattered glass and scattered shingles, puffs of pink insulation filtering through the air like glistening cotton candy, the foundation of the farmhouse swept clean. The big windmill is toppled onto its side, the tornado a giant Don Quixote that has taken it down in its quest to devour all before it, and her father's John Deere tractor dangles grotesquely from the jagged stump of another nearby oak as if the twister neatly hung up its toys after playing with them. Everything that made their farmhouse a home…the appliances, the furniture, the pictures on the wall, the clothing in the closets and the boxes of Christmas decorations in the attic, her stuffed animals and other toys…are all spun shattered across the yard, lying warped and waterlogged in the sunshine, mudspattered relics of a prehistoric period that existed up until 8 o'clock last night before the twister rendered it extinct. The air smells of freshly churned dirt and damp mustiness and broken wood, the scents permeating her sinuses and lodging forever in her memory to remind her that THIS is what violence smells like, what death and destruction smells like. And she knows she brought all of this hellish carnage down herself, by wishing that she could see a tornado. Guilt gnaws at that vacant hole in her heart, settling heavily into her gut, and she is unable to stand there any longer and listen to the neighbor's consoling words to her mother, knowing that she has been the cause of everything, so she shifts away, going to stand at the edge of the gravelled drive. She spies something glittering at her feet and she bends down to pick it up…it is the little black onyx pendant on a silver chain that her parents gave her for her birthday last year. A smear of red dirt mars the stone's black surface and she rubs a thumb across it to polish it up, and then… Then it all hits her and she breaks, shattering into pieces like that hailstone last night, like the farmstead before her, falling to her knees in the wet dirt, sobs ripping themselves out of her lungs as huge tears roll down her face, her fists clenching tight and pounding into the ground, her mourning as visceral and violent as the tornado itself as she cries and rages in six-year-old impotent fury over the loss of her home, of her father… And like Scarlett O'Hara promising on radishes that she will never go hungry again, Jo Thornton promises on that blue sunny sky that she will hunt that beast that took her father, the seed of anger and vengeance sprouting within her soul and becoming the driving force of her life as she vows to find the monster. And slay it dead. The little green rental car bumps up the rutted gravel drive and she parks it, getting out. She pushes her sunglasses to the top of her head, the wind whipping her blonde hair about her face as she stares out over the once-thriving farmstead that was smashed into splinters a couple of decades ago. Not much remains of it, save for the slab of foundation for the house and the flooring for the barn, and while the neighbor her mother sold the property to still farms the nearby fields that her father once farmed, nothing has ever been rebuilt on the property. She has come home to this place several times over the years since his death, for she has never felt comfortable mourning at the cemetery where her mother buried a bodyless casket and planted a granite headstone atop it to mark Ed Thornton's life, and she has often come to tell him her various triumphs and sorrows…that she got into the University of Oklahoma, that she'd gotten grants to research tornadoes, that she was marrying fellow chaser Bill Harding, that she was divorcing Bill…but this time, she is here with proof that she never forgot that blue-sky promise she made all those years ago, for yesterday… Yesterday they made Dorothy, the tornado interceptor module she and Bill had built to try to record information from within a twister, fly in a huge F-5. \"We did it, Dad, we did it,\" she says softly, her fingers wrapping around the black onyx necklace at her throat. \"You'd be so proud of us, we finally made Dorothy fly.\" She hesitates, a lump forming in her throat, tears brimming in her eyes and blurring her vision. \"I kept my promise, Dad, and while it's not exactly slaying the beast, Dorothy has helped us learn the best information yet about tornadoes, and that hopefully will help us increase the lead warning time on severe storms so that people have a better chance of surviving.\" And as she turns her face to the bright blue sky, feeling the warmth of the sun against her skin, she knows her father has heard her… And he is proud of her.

I reach a hand over the left side of the bed, and I'm not surprised to find my fiancée, Jo, isn't there. I sit up in bed and turn on the light. It's another summer storm, a mild one from the sound of things, but it doesn't matter, Jo will be standing at the dinning room window watching it pass by, just like she does every time a storm goes through. I pull a shirt on and stand up and head towards where I know she will be waiting. I move silently, as much as I wish I understood why she watches the storms the way she does, seeing her standing in front of the wide window, the lightning illuminating her body, her white sweat pants and tank top glowing with each flash, makes me wish the storm would never leave. The closer I get, I can tell something is wrong, the lighting flashes again and I see a trail of tears run down her face. I step close behind her and wrap my arms around her waist. She doesn't jump in my arms, doesn't say a word, she simply places her hands on top of mine and we both watch the storm pass by our tiny house. The longer I stand there, the more tears I feel fall from her face onto my arm, I just hold her tighter. The longer I stand there, the worst the storm gets, the weather radio sounding out its loud alert sound, a tornado watch for our county, but we just stay in the same place. The storm blowing outside. A few more minutes pass, the storm still raging outside, she breaks the silence. \"I never told you how my father died did I?\" she asks, I just lean my head down and rest it on her shoulder, it's a rhetorical question, we both know she, or her family for that matter, never told me how Joshua Evens had died. \"It was a night like tonight, a typical Oklahoma thunderstorm. I went to bed with just the rumbling of the thunder in the distance. Between the time I fell asleep and woke up, it got worse, I woke up a few seconds before Momma came and just told me to get up. She pulled me into her arms, carried me out of my room, the thunder was loud, but it sounded the same as always, until we got outside. I remember dad saying something about it being a big one, and that we had to get to the cellar, when I realized we were leaving the house I called for Toby, our dog. It was a blur for me when we got outside, Momma gave me to daddy and they just took off across the yard, the wind and the thunder were terrible, I had never been through anything like it before or since.\" Then we were back in silence as a huge clap of thunder sounds in the air, lighting flashing in long, finger like streaks across the sky, a bright, blinding white light. \"Once we got to the caller,\" she just randomly continued telling her story, \"it really happened fast, but at the time it seemed like forever. Our cellar was old, build before my family moved there, and dad hadn't ever really done anything to it to update it. But as the tornado went over our farm, the door started shacking, it was a worse sound than the thunder.\" I feel more tears fall on my arm; she started to shake so I held her a little tighter. \"He just stared grunting, he was trying to hold the door closed, but it just shaking. There was a small window and I saw it. I saw it and it was fascinating to me, all the swirling debris and…the way it looked when the lighting flashed, it was unlike anything I has seen before. But my mom was shaking as she held me; I can still feel how fast her heart was beating. Before I knew what was happening, daddy said he could hold it anymore, and just like that he gone. He was sucked up out of cellar, gone, in the blur of wind, thunder, lighting, and screams. I never saw him again.\" I just stood there, taking in everything she said, all of the pieces of a puzzle falling into place. Her obsession with storms, why she was always watching them as though they were living being. Why every time someone brought up her dad her face changed into the same expression she wore when she saw a storm roll through. I couldn't imagine living through that. All I knew about her father's death prior to now, was that Jo was five, and it wasn't an easy one. As much as I wanted to know what had happened, I could always see the pain it caused her when someone talked about her father. But now, I felt like I learned more about Jo in the past five minutes than I had in the tow years I had known her. Before I could say anything she started talking again. \"They found his body two days after the storm went through, twenty miles away from our house. I later found out he…\" her voice broke as more tears fell from her face, \"…he was wrapped around a bunch of branches in a tree. It took me a long time to get him flying out the cellar out of my head. I had nightmares for years, each time I storm would come through I would run and keep my head hidden from the windows. But when I got older, I didn't want to hide anymore. I wanted to look at one of those things; I wanted to prove that I could do it. The next time one came through when I was nine, I watched it. I watched it fly over our house, taking the roof and windmill with it, and I was determined to not let anyone felt what I felt, I refused to feel like I did ever again. I guess the rest is history.\" As her story drew to a close, so did the storm outside, the thunder was fading, the lightning was barley flashing. But still we stood there, I knew we would stay there until Jo couldn't see one cloud of the storm, and now I knew why. I turned her in my arms and gave her a kiss, one I tried to fill with sympathy and understanding. But the longer we kissed, the storm was barley moving, and for the first time since I had met her, Jo went to bed while a storm was still visible in the sky outside our house. Hope everyone like it. In the movie, Jo's father's name is not told, so I just made one up. I have no connection to the movie Tiwster in anyway, other than having a copy of it and enjoying it everytime a storm rolls through my little slice of life.

And I decided to write a fan fic about Jo and Bill. I just love the fact that they actually get together in the end, and the movie didn't just tease you into thinking they would. I'm saying this fic takes place when Jo was in the shower at Aunt Meg's house, because it was so obvious that she was thinking of her and Bill's relationship while she was in the shower. ;) Plus I like to use shower time as thinking time, too. x.x.x Aunt Meg Was Always Right x.x.x \"Bill is back,\" they all were saying. They made it their enthusiastic mantra, they kept repeating it continuously, shattering something inside her each time they did. Because she knew he wasn't really back. Still, his return did something to change the winds. The sky grew darker as if the storms were coming to celebrate his presence with the rest of the gang. When he said her name, and she looked back and saw him after so long being apart, she could feel her heart twisting up inside of her chest, just like the tornadoes she so loved to chase. He was such a good man, everyone could see it. So why couldn't she see it? How had she let him slip away from her? She knew she could never find another man like him. There was only one man on this earth made for her, and that was Bill. Those other men lost her when she went off on one of her scientific tangents. Other men didn't even care about the fascinating structure of an anvil-shaped stormhead. Other men didn't appreciate the wonderful green hue that the sky would take on minutes before hail started. Other men didn't want to watch the radar on her laptop for hours on end. But Bill did. He was the only one who shared her passion for Mother Nature's most beautiful storms. He was the only one who understood her obsession, and condoned it. He was proud of her, and he admired her - at least in the realm of stormchasing, he did. The Extreme. Jo smiled fondly and rolled her eyes at Dusty's heroic nickname for her former husband. As much as he denied it, Billy always was extreme in everything that he did. But he had a foul mouth on him, that was for sure. And a temper that could make any twister flee in terror. But he had been hers once upon a time. And she had to have him back. Seeing him with another woman sent sparks of envious electrical currents up Jo's spine. Her eyes saw power flashes in the distance, and her stomach raged like a storm cloud brewing on the Oklahoma horizon. Melissa was not right for Bill. Hadn't he seen that? Jo recalled Melissa's earlier words in the diner before they left. \"You're still in love with him, aren't you?\" A woman had a sensitivity about her that allowed her to see the feelings of her fellow females. Jo had been stunned that Melissa had read her emotions so easily. And to make it more ironic, all she and Bill had done was argue since they'd been together that morning. It was something about their arguments that made them attracted to each other. Everyone had said that, even darling Aunt Meg. \"You have this fire in your eyes when you fight with him,\" she would say, back when Jo and Bill were still married. And Jo selfconsciously looked in the mirror once, immediately after she and Bill had been fighting, just out of curiosity - just to see if Aunt Meg was right. Aunt Meg was always right. Aunt Meg often said that Bill would be back in Jo's life. She was right about that. She even said that Bill would come back to be with her one day. So if Aunt Meg was always right, why did Jo still feel like Bill wasn't here to win her back? Even now she could hear his hard laughter in the downstairs kitchen, no doubt reminiscing with the rest of the crew at the table. Good , Jo thought. Maybe their wild stories would scare Melissa away . . . But deep down she knew the thought was in vain. Melissa was a solid woman, that much Jo could see. But Melissa was also dependent on Bill, which frightened Jo. Jo had never showed her dependence on Bill out of pride. She now feared that this was what had been missing from their relationship all along. That because he could not see that dependence in her, he thought she might as well just get along without him. But she truly was dependent on him, and that never had been more clear to her than just after they parted ways. Filing for divorce was the hardest thing she'd ever had to do, and she was still, to this day, in denial about their breaking apart for ever . . . Jo sighed and let the water run rinse through her hair once more before turning the faucet down. She stepped out of the shower and dried herself off, gathered her clothes and changed quickly before standing in front of the mirror, her thoughts an updraft of confusion. Aunt Meg's reflection appeared behind hers just as she fastened her necklace. And Jo anticipated that whatever Aunt Meg had to share would be worthy of her attention. After all, Aunt Meg was always right. ","Summary":" Just watched Twister for the first time in like, 10 years.

This story is dedicated to Philip Seymour Hoffman \"Dusty\", R.I.P. To most people, Spring means seeing plants, leaves, and all kind of new beginnings. Some people imagine other things. Like rain, hail, and pure bad weather. Storm chasers are some of those people. Beltzer, Haynes, Dusty, and two new chasers are on the hunt again this Spring! \"Well, you all are a little excited,\" Haynes said to Beltzer and Dusty. Looking over at them, she could tell by now. There were only a few days left of Winter and they were ready to go. They were packing everything up, while getting mentally prepared. \"We heard it's going to be an active one again this year!\" Beltzer said, with a huge smile on his face. \"Yeah, can't wait dude!\" Dusty shouted, with his hands in the air. Meanwhile, a state away, two other chasers are getting ready also. \"So, where are we headed this year?\" Sandra asked her fellow chaser Kelly. \"We're going to Oklahoma. There's supposed to be a lot of action this year.\" \"Alright, sounds good.\" So, the next two days they made sure everything was ready. \"Hey Dusty, are you taking your new bus?\" Beltzer asked. \"You know it!\" he answered with a chuckle. \"I'm sticking with my \"Blue Storm\" van,\" Beltzer told him. \"Well, I'm headed to bed everyone,\" Haynes said with a yawn. \"Alright, I think we should get some sleep also ,\" Beltzer suggested. So they all went to sleep, anticipating the next day. Morning came and they were all up early, except for Dusty. Beltzer went to wake him, tapping on his door. He got up slowly and opened the door. \"I thought you would be up before us man,\" Beltzer said. \"I was so excited last night and couldn't fall asleep dude,\" Dusty replied, rubbing his eyes. \"Well, get ready and let's go.\" As they checked everything again, the other two chasers were on their way out also. \"I can't wait for this!\" Kelly said. \"Yep, this is always my favorite time of year,\" Sandra replied. They grabbed all of their things and loaded up their truck. They started their journey after eating breakfast. With Beltzer and Haynes in their van, and Dusty in his new bus, the \"Barn Burner 2\", they headed out. Beltzer and Haynes couldn't help but hear the music Dusty had coming from his new speakers. \"The new bus sounds awesome Dusty!\" Beltzer said from his CB. \"Thanks man!,\" he shouted back. They continued on, until they got to their favorite diner Hot Pit Barbeque and stopped for some lunch. Finally in Oklahoma, Kelly and Sandra decided to stop for lunch also. Sandra wanted to rest for a little while. So, they came across the only place they had seen since they got in town. \"Let's try this place,\" Sandra suggested, as they pulled into the parking lot. The place was a diner, named Hot Pit Barbeque. \"Hey, it looks like people here are starting the chase also,\" Kelly mentioned. She had noticed the van and bus parked outside, with storm chasing equipment on them. \"Hell yeah, they're one of us!\" Sandra said. They got out of the truck and walked in. The waitress seated them and took their order. Looking across the diner, Kelly noticed Beltzer, Dusty, and Haynes. Looking out the window at the sky, then down at their laptops. \"Hey, I think I've found our storm chasers,\" she told Sandra, with a smile. So she looked over at them and replied with \"Yeah, looks like you have!\" \"The guys are pretty cute too!\" Sandra whispered, staring at Dusty and Beltzer. The waitress brought their food and they talked about the guys that sat across the way. \"Go talk to them,\" Kelly whispered. \"No, you go talk to them!\" Sandra said, with wide eyes. \"Alright, we'll both go talk to them,\" Kelly suggested. \"Just follow behind me,\" Kelly whispered. \"Sounds good to me.\" As they headed their way, Beltzer looked up and noticed them. Haynes paid no attention, caught up in the radar. \"Dusty, don't look now, but there's something coming our way,\" Beltzer said. He looked up anyway, of course. He saw Kelly and Sandra making their way over. \"No way man, those chicks are coming our way? Sweet!\" he whispered back. \"Quick, look busy!\" Beltzer said. \"You all are too predictable!\" Haynes said, with a soft laugh. A few seconds later, Kelly and Sandra arrived at their table. The guys looked up with a smile and said hi. \"Hey, how are you all today?\" Sandra asked. Before they could answer, Kelly added \"Yeah, we couldn't help but notice the van and bus outside. We figured they were yours.\" \"Yeah, we're chasers,\" Beltzer said. \"That's awesome, so are we!\" Sandra commented. \"Sweet!\" Dusty couldn't help but add. \"So, do you mind if we sit down with you all?\" \"Sure,\" Haynes answered. \"Sorry, they're not used to meeting other chasers.\" \"Yeah, we apologize.\" So they sat down at their table to join them. They all introduced themselves and talked for a little while. Then they all paid for their food and went outside. \"I'll be in the van,\" Haynes told Beltzer. \"Alright, be there in a minute.\" \"So, do you want to hang out for a while?\" Beltzer asked Kelly and Sandra. \"Sure,\" Kelly replied. \"Yeah, that's awesome!\" Dusty added. So, they all got going. With Beltzer and Haynes leading the way, Dusty and the girls followed. \"Damn, Beltzer is hot!\" Kelly said, with excitement. \"He's alright, but I like Dusty a little better.\" They wondered where they were headed. Sandra grabbed the CB and asked them. \"I'm not seeing anything on the radar yet,\" Haynes replied. \"Yeah, I think we need to get some rooms for the night,\" Beltzer added. \"Alright, we'll be following,\" Sandra agreed. They pulled over at the next hotel they came across and parked. So, the girls got a room together, and the guys got one right next to them. With a few more hours of daylight, they found out that there wasn't any promising weather for the rest of the day. So, they all went in the girls' room to hang out a while. \"What a dud of a day,\" Dusty said, with a sigh. \"Well there's always tomorrow,\" said Beltzer. They all sat down and got to know each other, telling chasing stories also. Then they ordered room service for dinner, as it turned to dusk. \"Well, I'm going to head to bed,\" Haynes said. \"Alright, goodnight,\" everyone replied, as she went over to the bed. To give her some privacy, they all went over to the guys' room. Kelly and Beltzer sat on one bed and started talking. Which left Sandra and Dusty on the other bed, sitting in awkward silence. Not really knowing what to do, Dusty asked \"Do you like comedies? I've got a few, if you want to watch one.\" \"Well, my favorite one would have to be The Wedding Singer,\" Sandra replied. \"Awesome, I definitely have that one!\" So, he got it out of his bag and put it in. They sat against the headboard of the bed and started watching. Dusty, being the slick, but respectable guy he was, slowly inched over torwards Sandra. Beltzer and Kelly didn't want to be rude, so they leaned back and watched also. Sandra looked over at Dusty, as she noticed how close he'd gotten. \"I'm sorry, am I too close? I'll back up if you want,\" he whispered. \"No, you're fine,\" she whispered back. She then slowly reached over and placed her hand on top of his. They both looked up and smiled at each other. Meanwhile, Beltzer was also working his own magic with Kelly. His plan was a little different though. He had already sat down next to her, when Dusty turned on the movie. So, he just gave her a little nudge with his leg against hers. She then looked over and nudged him back, with a quick smile. Then he gently put his arm over the back of her neck and shoulders. They stayed that way for the rest of the movie. When the movie came to an end, Beltzer suggested that they get some sleep. \"Yeah, It's getting late,\" Sandra agreed. \"Alright, well have sweet dreams,\" Dusty said, with a smile. \"Dude, I think Sandra is into me!\" Dusty told Beltzer. \"Oh yeah, what makes you think that?\" Beltzer asked. \"Uh, I moved over next to her and didn't get hit or cussed out!\" he replied. \"Then she put her hand on mine, for the rest of the movie man!\" Beltzer just stood there, with a little grin on his face. \"Alright, I have to say congrats to you!\" Dusty thanked him and asked about Kelly. \"Well, I had a little luck too!\" Beltzer replied. \"That's awesome man!\" Dusty chuckled. \"Yeah, I sat down next to her, in the beginning. Then halfway through the movie, I put my arm over her shoulder,\" he said proudly. \"She just smiled at me, so I guess she's into me too.\" \"That's sweet man! I guess we should get some sleep.\" When the girls woke up, they went over to the guys' room. They quickly answered with a \"good morning,\" and a grin. Haynes couldn't help but notice them smiling differently, but didn't know why. \"What's going on you all?\" Haynes asked curiously. \"Nothing bad, just happy to see you all,\" Dusty smiled. Haynes just answered with a quick \"ok,\" not knowing if she should believe it or not. The guys started to gather up their things, so she pulled Kelly and Sandra outside. \"So, what's going on with them?\" Haynes asked. \"I think they're just a little excited about getting to know us,\" Sandra replied. \"What happened when I left the room last night? Do I want to know?\" Haynes hesitantly asked. \"We just watched a movie and talked a little,\" answered Kelly. \"So, that was it?\" she asked. \"We sat next to each other too. That was as far as it went though,\" Sandra added. \"I knew it! Those guys had the look on their faces! I know them too well!\" Haynes laughed. \"I kinda figured they were into you all.\" They went back to their room and packed up their things. After they were ready, they loaded the truck and van. Soon after, the guys came out with their things. \"You all are slow,\" Haynes said. \"I thought women were the slower ones,\" she smirked. \"Well, Dusty had to find his other sock,\" Beltzer explained. \"Alright, well we should get going.\" They first headed for a gas station. Beltzer and Haynes led the way, then Dusty, and then Sandra with Kelly. When they pulled in, they filled up and went inside for some snacks. \"So, where are we going?\" Dusty asked. \"Looks like there's going to be some awesome weather over in Bartleville today,\" Haynes replied. \"Alright, lead the way boss!,\" Dusty shouted, turning up his music.

I loaded her in the back seat of my old dodge truck \"I'm going to be right back I'm going to find out if I can find anyone else.\" I closed the door and she laid there, I climbed out people were helping people out of there newly leveled houses. I helped an old lady into an ambulance \"was anyone else in there with you?\" I questioned her she nodded. I continued to dig till I heard whimpering and loud screams of pain like someone was getting torturing a person. I dug some more till I felt a small forearm. \"Hello anyone down there\" \"Yes help us\" as someone said that from inside the sky was getting grey then green again I shook that idea out of my mind Surly it wouldn't hit it twice I helped the little one who seemed to be passed out she had a knot on her head slightly bleeding I took off my shirt and ripped a long piece then tied it semi tight on her bump The brother looked at me weird \"You hurt\" I questioned he was definitely older than I was \"I'm fine\" he said he turned his back and limped to his now turned upside down on its hood brand new truck I noticed his flannel shirt was ripped as a wound probably from debris it had to be at least a good 2 inches deep and 5 inches long blood was trickling down his back and collected on his shirt I noticed a hole I dug it bigger than went in to see if anyone else was stuck. I then proceeded to check out the destroyed house roof missing insulation everywhere. \"Anyone else in here\" I felt a tug on my jacket a girl my age trapped under huge amounts of ruble small amount of blood dripping through her cut lip I gripped the ruble and lifted I got a good inches I heard she was gasping for air a sudden surge of energy shot through me to my aching muscles I gripped it again tighter and then lifted the stuff until it landed a few feet away from her \"Hey you ok\" She didn't respond just like the first house it creaked and buckled under stress me having to dive down lower I felt a sharp piece of metal scrape my forehead temple to temple I carried her out and soon as I did the place we were in collapsed into the dirt I noticed the sky wasn't grey anymore it was black pure and I felt cool wind blow by my hurt forehead I then jumped over the side of my pickup landing unsteadily on the bed I climbed on the roof I had a megaphone in the bed \"hey everybody listen the storm is recharging what that means is it's getting stronger so if you have hurt sick people put them in the bed and if you have a truck any kind put as many people you can than get out cause by the way those clouds are looking we don't have much time\" They agreed I saw about 28 pickups slowly edge forward and behind mine every bed full of hurt and injured. We drove to the next town to the hospital A doctor who had just lit a cigarette then puffed and inhaled his strained face loosened a bit until he saw the trucks \"What Happened?\" \"That tornado that hit Amarillo these are the hurt\" I said handing him one of the people it was the girl the bleeding had stopped and she had woken up at this point \"ok come here I got you\" she squirmed in my grasp I put her on the stretcher It was like an assembly line people being placed on stretchers guys like me putting people on carts and then nurses grabbing the stretcher new and occupied It was done lots of people going in and out of the hospital and then I got a serious headache Blood was stinging in my eyes I wiped my head on my forearm it came back glistening in blood I was dizzy but tried not to show it I grabbed the side of the open door and shook my head The girl that was waiting with the knee injury \"you coming or not\" She scooted carefully trying not to move her knee I gripped her knees and put my hand over her back and carried her and we waited in the hospital line \"So what's your name\" I asked the actually pretty girl in front of me the other one I saved \"Hey she ok\" \"yep she just napping she has a few fractures in her ribs other than that she's good I didn't introduce myself last time names Mack\" \"Hi Mack I'm Cody one of the storm chasers for the weather in Amarillo Texas did you guys live there\" \"yeah we did that house was in our family for a long, long time but now I guess it's time to move on and build a new one\" A hint of sadness hit his face expression the hospital you could hear crying laughing at jokes being told but mainly crying and hugging and screaming off those getting treated I felt something wet hit my forehead it was one of the doctors I knew from my childhood he had wrapped a bandage with cream on the inside of it to keep it from getting it infected \"hey Cody how's work\" \"Chasing storms is an awesome job I love it\" I said My friend chuckled as he saw I was carrying a girl like a wounded hound \"who you got there?\" \"um I don't know I hadn't asked her that yet\" \"my name is Crystal\" 2 weeks later I helped Mack put the final touches on their new home it was twice the size of the old one we all pitched in to help sense we were the only ones who were helping red cross was sent then they had to go back because of lack of supplies and then turned back hadn't seen them since then \"oh hey sugar can you hand me\" I said to crystal pointing to see a hammer I dropped \"here you go you strong man\" I smiled and laughed at that and then noticed I was the only one of the guys who had on his shirt the others had lost it during the heat wave that hit it's been 120 all week I was sweating like a hound you look at me and think I got water dunked on me I finally lost the shirt and tore it to make a headband I then slung the tshirt in the trash I noticed a girl with wild hair on a roof with the shingles \"what you doing up there\" I said that kind of freaked her out and she tumbled she was on the edge I darted forward and she landed ontop of me \"and I stick the landing\" \"well…almost…can you get off my cheast I cant breath\" \"oh sorry im so sorry I'm Brittany\" \"I'm guessing you are the kind of girl who don't like those expensive dinners and wear dresses all the time are you\" \"On occasion not always I'm more of a tomboy\" \"That explains a lot actually, weird you get the hair\" \"Oh I dye it\" \"Oh cool\" I went back to work and so did she 9 months later the city was back and bustling with people I have my ideal friends im now going out with the girl I saved with all the animals crystal Life is good until when you hear the screaming of a siren then everything got silent Oh no not again What will happen to the folk in Amarillo will another one hit and destroy their work or is it just a warning you have to read to find out chapter 2 coming sometime this week Bye you guys.

Basically, the movie Twister, with a twist. Now, I don't care if people read this or not, but if you do, review, let me know what you think. One of the only reason that I wrote this, other than the fact that Twister is my favourite movie, was because I noticed that there were hardly any fics in the Twister section. Thirty-six year old Bill Harding sighed under his breath as he concentrated on driving his red, Dodge Ram down the dirt road he and his fiancée were on. \"Um, honey, are you sure she's gonna be here?\" his fiancée, Melissa Reeves, asked. Bill glanced over at Melissa. \"If I know Jo, she's already dragged her entire department into the field. Ah, hell, a day like today, it's to be expected. She forgets everything except her work.\" Bill had an anxious look on his face that didn't escape Melissa's notice. \"You're nervous about seeing her, aren't you?\" Still watching the road, Bill looked at Melissa. \"Nervous? No. Why, do I look nervous?\" \"No. Well, yeah, you do, a little,\" Melissa admitted. Bill shook his head. \"I just want to get this over with. Now it was Melissa's turn to be slightly nervous. \"But she said she signed the papers, right?\" \"Yeah, that's what she said, but that's not the only reason I don't really want to be there.\" \"You don't think she signed them?\" Melissa didn't know what the other reason was, but she didn't want to add to his worry by asking. \"No, I think so. Give me a kiss,\" Bill grinned. Melissa leaned over and kissed her fiancé. A woman of thirty-four years, Jo Harding, knelt on top of a blue van, wiring a Doppler radar. \"Okay professor; hang on there, I think I fixed it. I've got it,\" Beltzer, a member of Jo's team, called from inside the van. Jo tried turning on the radar, only to be met with sparks. \"Oops.\" \"Oh, fuck, this thing is useless,\" Jo said, exasperated. \"Sorry, Jo,\" Beltzer replied to Jo's outburst. Suddenly, the radar began working. As Jo ordered for a reading, I was watching, an amused look on my face. I loved sitting back and watching my mother work, she got so caught up in it, that she didn't notice anything else. \"Hey, Kari, come here,\" a familiar voice caught my attention. I walked over to Dusty, who was waiting eagerly for me. \"What is it, Dusty?\" I asked. \"I've been practicing that song,\" he announced. \"Listen.\" Then he began singing with the song that came on the radio. \" If I mistreat you girl, sho' don't mean no harm...\" It was then that my mom called me over. I gave an apologetic look at Dusty, then walked over to my mom, listening to Rabbit chew Laurence out about rolling the maps. \"All I'm saying is don't fold the maps,\" Rabbit was saying. \"I didn't fold the maps,\" Laurence insisted. Rabbit wasn't backing down. \"Yeah, well Kansas is a mess, there's a big crease right through Wichita,\" he then began rolling the map up. \"Roll the maps.\" I continued walking to my mom. \"What is it?\" I asked. \"I wanted to ask you one last time. Are you sure you don't want to stay with Aunt Meg, or a friend?\" Jo asked. I shook her head. \"No, I want to come along, I have every summer since I was eleven mom, you can't stop me.\" Jo sighed. She knew she couldn't change my mind, I was too much like my dad, and even my inquisitive blue-grey eyes matched his exact colour. From behind me, I heard a truck drive up, then a moment later, Dusty yelling \"The extreme.\" I didn't turn around. I would try and ignore the man for as long as possible. Deep breath, Kari, I thought to myself. \"Hiya Joey,\" Bill said, coming up to where Jo and I were standing. \"Kathryn.\" I couldn't ignore him now. \"It's Kari.\" \"Hey Bill, glad you found us,\" Jo didn't acknowledge what I had said in my icy tone. \"How are you both doing?\" Bill asked. I didn't answer, I was still mad at my dad. But Jo answered. \"We're good, have you seen the sky?\" Bill glanced at the sky. \"Yeah, she's, uh, she's really talking.\" \"Hey, welcome back Bill,\" Laurence said, walking by. \"I'm not back,\" Bill called after. He turned back to Jo. \"So you want the papers?\" she asked, trying not to let him know that she was hurt. \"I did drive all the way out here for them,\" Bill replied. I sighed, and was about to walk away when Jo asked her a question. \"Kari, where are they?\" \"The glove box, mom,\" I answered before walking away. I heard the truck door open, then shut, and my parents arguing some more. Without thinking, I automatically walked over to Dusty, surprised to find that he was talking to a woman with short dark hair and a wary expression on her face. \"Hey, Kari,\" Dusty took a moment from his speech to smile at me. To me, Dusty was like an uncle. I smiled back then looked at the woman. \"Uh, hi, I'm Kari,\" I held my hand out to the woman who took it and shook. \"Hello, I'm Melissa, it's nice to meet you,\" Melissa smiled. I took a step closer to Dusty who began talking again. \"The suck zone- it's the point- basically at which the twister sucks you up, but it's not that technical therefore obviously, but\" Here, Dusty was interrupted. \"Hi, I'm Jo Harding.\" Melissa looked up at the blonde haired woman who stood before her. \"Oh, hello,\" she stood up quickly. \"Nice to meet you.\" \"Bill just told me the happy news,\" I could tell that Jo was faking the happy tone she was using, but now was curious about what news that Bill had told my mother. \"Which?\" Melissa asked. Bill jumped in. \"Us, marriage, uh, Jo, Melissa.\" I froze, staring at Bill. \"You're getting married?\" Bill looked at Jo, wondering what to do. \"Um, yeah, Melissa and I are getting married before I start my new job.\" I decided to skip over the get mad at him for getting married. If he was married then I didn't have to deal with seeing him anymore. \"Fine. What new job?\" \"That's right, that's right, right, right, right. Weatherman,\" Jo said. \"What?\" Bill sounded offended. Jo acted innocent. \"What?\" Bill shook his head. Then, filling the awkward silence that had fallen, a cell phone rang, and Melissa pulled it out, answering it right away. \"Hello, Dr. Melissa Reeves, here. Uh-huh.\" \"Just wanted to say hello,\" Jo said to Melissa. \"Uh-huh,\" was the reply to the phone, then Melissa looked at Jo. \"You too.\" I walked away, heading towards Bill's new truck, behind me, both my parents followed. \"New truck?\" Jo asked. Bill nodded. \"That's right.\" \"Oh boy. New job, new truck, new wife,\" Jo said sarcastically. \"It's like a whole new you.\" \"Jo-\" Bill started, but I interrupted. \"Mom, have you told him yet?\" Jo looked at me. I was standing close by, clearly annoyed as Jo was, it showed in my eyes. My blonde hair, matching Jo's, was pulled into a bun and held in place with a pencil. I'd dressed in a simple pair of jeans and a blue tank-top that Jo recognized as one of her own. \"Told me what?\" Bill asked. \"Dorothy. She's here.\" \"Show me,\" Bill didn't hesitate. While Jo led Bill over to her truck, I walked over to my own. It was a little battered and old, but that's what happens being a storm chaser, so I didn't mind. I sat in the driver's seat, staring over at where my mother was showing Bill and Melissa, Dorothy. Everyone had gathered around. Then suddenly, Haynes ran over to them, and announced something. Obviously they had located where a tornado may be, because everyone ran back and began packing things up in a rush. I shut the door, and started up my truck at the same time as everyone else. I pulled out behind Dusty, last in the line. I watched as Bill and Melissa pulled up behind me. \"Hey Bill, glad you're back,\" Rabbit's voice came in through the CB radio. \"I'm not back,\" Bill replied. I listened in. I didn't normally talk back unless asked a direct question. \"Rabbit?\" Jo's voice came over the radio now. \"Yeah, boss?\" Rabbit replied. \"Can we do better than the 30?\" Jo asked. It took a moment for Rabbit to answer, checking his maps. \"No. Not for a while. It's best to stay on it until we pass Rogers creek.\" \"Copy that,\" was Jo's answer. It was then that I looked out my window, noticing the black Windstars driving up. The first one held another scientist, Jonas Miller. I gave him the middle finger as he passed, earning myself a dirty look. \"Jo, I think we got fleas,\" Beltzer said over the radio. \"Jo, come back,\" Bill said next. It took Jo a moment before she responded. \"Hey there, change your mind?\" She was talking to Bill. \"Yeah, what's Jonas doing here?\" Bill asked. \"I don't know but he's probably asking the same thing about you,\" Jo answered. Then, suddenly, one of the Windstars swerved towards my truck. I jerked the wheel to the right, avoiding being hit, but ending up with a flat tire. \"Shit,\" I swore. Bill pulled over in front of me, and got out. He opened my door, and glanced at the truck before saying anything. \"Want a ride?\" I hesitated before I could answer. \"Sure,\" I said finally. I grabbed a bunch of things and threw them in my backpack, including my keys. I locked the truck, and shut the door. I followed Bill back to his truck where I climbed into the backseat. It only took us another five minutes to reach an auto repair shop. I went straight inside and asked the guy to tow my truck back here and fix it. He agreed, and I would return for it in a few days. Walking out of the repair shop, I saw Bill being held back by Dusty, and Rabbit. I knew what they were arguing about, but by the time I had gotten over to them, it was over. Melissa had run over to him before disappearing into a diner. Bill walked over to a pile of dirt and picked some up. I followed him. \"What are you even doing here?\" I asked, making him jump. \"I'm just here for the divorce papers, Kathryn, that's all.\" I shook my head. \"You left us four years ago and only filed for divorce last year and you didn't even press the fact until now, why?\" \"It's none of your business, okay? It is between me and your mom,\" Bill answered, annoyed. \"It is though,\" I replied. \"When you get divorced, the court will either place me with you or mom, and because of mom's job, it's more likely I'll get stuck with you and what's her face,\" I replied, not noticing my voice slowly getting higher. \"Kathryn Sienna Rose Harding, you don't talk to me like that, I'm your dad, you have to respect me, and her name is Melissa, and I expect you to be polite to her,\" Bill's voice had already taken on a yell. \"My name is Kari, and if you bothered to call me at all in the last four years, you'd know why!\" Tears were now running down my face as I turned away. I couldn't stand being around my dad anymore. As I walked away, the memory of how I started telling people to call me Kari got started. The memory just made me cry more. \" Hey, Kari, what kind of cookies are you and gramma making?\" The teasing voice made me stiffen before turning around. My big brother was standing there, a couple of his friends standing with him. \"I don't like being called Kari, Ethan,\" I said, not answering his question. Instantly, Ethan stopped, he walked over to me and draped his arm around my shoulders. \"One day, Kari, you'll love it,\" Ethan smiled at me, and I couldn't help but smile back. \" Chocolate chip is what we're making,\" I answered his question. Ethan just grinned at me then ran off. I had only been ten at the time, my mom and dad still happily married. It was two years later that my life got worse. Melissa had walked back out of the diner, just a couple minutes after my mom. She walked over to Bill, who told her something then ran over to Jo. Melissa walked back to the truck, waving at me to come over. I did so. \"Looks like we're riding together for a bit,\" she said, forcing a smiled on her face. I just nodded, and climbed into the passenger side. We pulled out, being the last in the line again. This time I was listening closely at the radio. Melissa was content to leave it that way. Melissa's phone rang again and she pulled it out. \". Melissa Reeves here? Oh, oh. Yes, Donald, you've caught me in my car!\" I kept track of what Melissa was saying. Her patients were needy. \"Donald, this feeling of inadequacy is normal for you, Julia doesn't resent you. We talked about this before. She did not marry your penis. Oh, okay, she didn't only marry your penis.\" What kind of doctor was she? I wasn't going to ask though, that would be rude. After a couple minutes, she hung up. \"Are you a therapist?\" I asked. \"Yes, why?\" \"Are you my dad's?\" Melissa looked surprised, but she kept her eye on the road. \"N, why do you think he needs one?\" I just shook my head, then I looked up though the window. \"Shit, shit.\" I grabbed the radio. \"Hey, mom, Bill, are you guys going to wrap this up soon?\" \"Why?\" cam Bill's frustrated voice. \"Oh, nothin. I was just wonderin' if we're gonna chase this tornado, or if you just wanna catch the next one,\" I replied. I heard Bill swear, then my mom was on the radio, talking to Beltzer. \"Beltzer, is it on the ground?\" I didn't pay attention to the reply; I was too busy staring out the window. The next few minutes passed quickly. \"Oh, my god,\" Melissa whispered, as the tornado disappeared. I watched too, then looked at where I had last seen my mom's truck. \"Hey, where's mom's tru-\" I never got to finish my question because a yellow truck appeared out of nowhere and fell on the road in front of us. Screaming, Melissa swerved out of the way, slamming in the brakes. She slowly climbed out of the truck, shaking. I also climbed out, but I wasn't scared. \"You just missed the truck. Awesome! It was awesome!\" Dusty was yelling. \"Melissa!\" I heard Bill, and watched as he ran over to her, pulling her into a hug. \"Oh, god. Billy.\" I snorted at the name. Bill looked at me, an annoyed expression on his face. I walked over to my mom's truck. It was totalled. Jo also walked up, she looked disappointed. She glanced over at Melissa, and like she was talking to a little kid, she asked, \"You okay?\" but never waited for an answer. Bill answered for Melissa, but I didn't hear him. \"What was it like?\" Dusty was asking my mom. \"Windy,\" she answered before turning to me. \"Are you okay, Kari?\" I nodded. \"Yeah, I'm fine.\" Just then Jonas' team rolled up past them. Dusty ran after. 'Jo pulled out a backpack, and began loading her things into it. \"You got full coverage on that truck?\" \"Liability only,\" Bill answered, knowing what Jo was up to. \"Liability only?\" Jo gave the truck a look. \"It's a very pretty truck.\" Melissa smiled, \"Thank you.\" Bill shook his head. \"Don't even think about it. No way.\" Twenty minutes later Bill's truck had Dorothy 2 loaded up and Melissa and I were in the backseat while Bill drove and Jo sat in the passenger seat. \"This is the caboose, this is the caboose! I'm waiting for orders, Boss!\" Dusty said over the radio. Both Bill and Jo reached for it, then hesitated, then reached again. \"Go ahead,\" Bill said. \"No, it's your truck,\" Jo argued. I got annoyed quickly. \"Someone just take it.\" Jo grabbed it. \"Dusty, the battle zone should be northeast of 81.\" \"Copy that,\" Dusty replied. Melissa spoke up. \"Wait a minute. Battle zone? Billy what are we doing?\" \"We're going again,\" Bill answered. Now Melissa Dusty, the battle zone should be northeast of 81. was alarmed. \"Again? But you almost got yourself killed back there!\" \"No, that was just a close call,\" I answered. \"You're gonna cross 15 on Oklahoma412. 412.\" Rabbit came in on over the radio. \"Okay, copy that. Haynes, what's on the mesonet?\" Jo replied. Haynes answered right away. \"Winds continuing to back, VIL's are at…..uh, 60.\" \"Okay, good. Let's go get it guys.\" We kept heading in the same direction. Jo leaned over to look at the speedometer. She rolled her eyes at the needle which was currently on 50. In answer, Bill sped up. The truck pulled up alongside Jonas' van. \"There's your pal,\" I muttered sarcastically. Suddenly, Bill slammed on the brakes. Right away, my mom started asking, \"What are you doing?\" \"Look at the updraft, the angle! It's gonna shift it's track!\" Bill stared intently out the window. \"Are you sure?\" I asked. \"Oh yes. It's defiantly a sidewinder! It'll move left,\" Bill answered me. \"Is that bad\" Melissa asked. Bill looked out the back window \"Wasn't there a road back there?\" \"You're right, go, go, go,\" Jo said. Bill turned the truck around quickly, and turned down the road that we had passed earlier. Melissa's phone rang, and she answered it quickly. \"Hello? Donald, now's not a very good time for me, okay? What...all right, put Julie on. Okay.\" I rolled my eyes. \"We're close,\" Bill commented. Jo grabbed the radio. \"Rabbit, tell me what road we're on, where does this take us?\" Melissa's conversation kept my attention from my mother. \"I know it feels unnatural but with Donald's motility, you're not gonna have this baby the old-fashioned way. Even if you stand on your head.\" Both my mom and I gave Bill a funny look. \"She's a, reproductive therapist,\" Bill explained. \"Laurence? Laurence come in, we've got to get ahead of this storm, what's on the satellite?\" Jo was talking into the radio again. \"I can't talk to you right now, I'll have to call you back,\" Melissa said into her phone. I was paying her little mind now. \"Twister south, skipping south, shifting to south, we have a, F2, ladies and gentlemen, possibly F3. You with me? It's a very, very large rope on the ground. Very large. Right on the ground.\" Laurence came in. I stopped paying attention to everything else. My attention was fully consumed looking out the window at the tornado which was currently sucking up water from a lake. I stared until the rain hitting the window blocked my view. I watched the twister separate into two. \"We've got sisters,\" I commented. Melissa's phone rang again, but I didn't listen. We were on a bridge now. I watched as a cow flew in front of us. \"Cow.\" Another cow few in the opposite cow. \"Another cow,\" Jo said this time. \"Actually, I think that was the same cow,\" Bill replied. A couple minutes later and the three twisters were on us. Twirling the truck around. I heard Bill yell for us to hold on. I geld tightly to my mom's seat in front of me. It only lasted a couple minutes before the tornadoes disappeared, and Bill and Jo jumped out of the truck. I climbed out after them, leaving Melissa in the truck. I heard them yelling, but I didn't join in. A minute later, the rest of the team pulled up, all jumping out and cheering. I tuned in when I heard Rabbit speak. \"Hey, you know what, uh, Jo, somebody couldn't help but notice how close we are to Wakita!\" Rabbit said, smiling. \"No,\" Jo answered, a smile on her face as well, she was still excited. \"Yeah, and Aunt Meg wouldn't mind a pit stop, right?\" Sanders spoke up this time. Again, Jo said, \"No.\" Dusty spoke up next. \"Red meat, we crave sustenance!\" \"Guys, we're not invading my aunts,\" Jo hollered. \"Food,\" Dusty said, grinning. Everyone else, including me, took up the chant. \"Food. Food!\" I knew we would get our way, because half an hour later, we were pulling up at my great-aunts house. I was the last to climb out of the truck. \"Kathryn, how are you, my dear?\" Meg asked, giving me a huge hug. \"I'm good, aunt Meg,\" I replied, smiling. As I pulled away, Meg was already turning her attention to the team. I hurried inside, announcing I get the first shower. It only took me ten minutes and I felt much better. I ran a bush through my hair once I was dressed, and left it down to dry in curls. Walking downstairs, I was greeted with the smell of home-cooked food. I'd missed a lot. They had just turned off the tv, and I heard Jo say, \" He really is in love with himself. I thought it was just a summer thing.\" I leaned against the wall, listening. \"He's gonna rue the day. Dude, he's gonna rue the day he came The Extreme, baby,\" Dusty's loud voice drowned out everyone else. \"Hear, hear,\" Laurence said. \"I'm talking immanent rueage. Immanent rueage,\" Dusty continued. Then Melissa spoke up, \"I was just wondering, why do you call Billy 'the extreme'?\" she asked. \"Cause Bill is the extreme,\" Dusty answered. Everyone started laughing, but Melissa and I. \"Bill is the most out of control son of a bitch in the game!\" Preacher spoke up. Bill looked over at Jo. \"No, I think I came in second.\" Dusty began speaking again. \"I have seen the extreme in high gear.\" Jo shook her head. \"You guys need to get some new stories. I'm going to clean up.\" She walked away from the table. With a smile, she walked past me to go up to the shower. I didn't listen to the story, I already knew it. I started listening again when Bill said something to Melissa. \"Honey, this is a tissue of lies. See there was another Bill, an evil Bill- and I killed him,\" Bill said, a smile on his face. Now I spoke up. I didn't mean for everyone to hear though. \"Yeah, right. I'm sure you did.\" Bill and Melissa gave me a look as I walked to the front door, and then outside. I sat on the deck, not wanting to be around Bill and Melissa anymore. Now the storm chasers were talking about the tornado. \"No, that was a good size twister, what was that, an F3?\" Preacher asked. Bill shook his head. \"Solid F2.\" Melissa looked at everyone. \"See, now you've lost me.\" \"It's the Fujita scale. It measures the intensity of a tornado by how much it \"eats\",\" Bill explained to Melissa. \"Eats?\" \"Destroys,\" Bill clarified for his fiancée. \"The little encounter we had back there was a strong F2, F3 maybe,\" Laurence interjected. Beltzer joined in. \"I hope we see some 4's today.\" Haynes agreed. \"That'd be sweet.\" Bill nodded. \"4 is good. 4 'll relocate your house fairly officially.\" Melissa had another question. \"Is there an F5?\" everyone at the table grew silent. \"What would that be like?\" Preacher answered her. \"Finger of God.\" Melissa looked around the table. \"None of you have seen an F5?\" Bill took a breath. \"Only two of us.\" Everyone but Melissa glanced at the ceiling, where Jo was upstairs, and to the front door, where Kari was. Everyone came rushing outside, disrupting my thinking. \"I'm sorry to eat and run,\" Jo was saying to Meg. \"It's alright, dear.\" Jo glanced at me. \"Last chance, hon, do you want to stay here?\" I debated for a minute, then shook my head. \"I'm coming with you.\" Meg smiled at me, and I smiled back, but my mom didn't look impressed. But before she could say anything, I waved good bye at Meg and ran to the truck, climbing in the backseat. When my mom got in, she was in the driver's seat, whereas Bill climbed in the passenger seat. He grew a bit upset at the sight of me. \"Kathryn, what are you doing?\" \"Bill, she's coming with us,\" Jo jumped in before I could answer. \"And you're letting her?\" \"Well, there's no arguing with her, she's too much like you.\" Bill gave up, there would be no winning this one, plus it was too late anyway. We turned onto a dirt road, and Bill clipped a receiver onto my mom's shorts. \"Oh, excuse me,\" I heard him say. Jo didn't mind however. She enjoyed having him around. Bill grabbed the radio. \"Okay, Rabbit, what have you got?\" \"Okay, Bill, turn left here toward that farm.\" \"You sure about that?\" Bill asked. \"Uh, yeah. Trust me. Rabbit is good, Rabbit is wise,\" Rabbit answered. I rolled my eyes, he'd picked that up when I'd called him a smart ass a couple years ago. \"This is a field, Rabbit,\" Bill said into the radio. Rabbit answered right away. \"I know, keep going, beyond it, right through that brush,\" Bill didn't say anything, so Rabbit continued. \"You see that brush right in front of you...\" \"Yeah, we see the brush, what's beyond that?\" Bill was getting frustrated now. \"Beyond what?\" Rabbit asked. You could almost hear the smile in his voice. I grabbed the radio from Bill. \"The BRUSH! A brick wall, a bearded lady, what?\" \"Oh, the highway, the highway,\" came the answer. I handed the radio back. \"Where is the road?\" Jo grabbed the radio this time. \"Any minute,\" rabbit replied. Suddenly, we drove out onto the road, right next to Jonas Miller. \"You're insane Jo! What are you trying to do, get somebody killed?\" Jonas' voice filled our truck. \"Oh really Jonas?\" Jo was getting angry now. \"It was so nice of you to stop back there and make sure we were all right!\" Bill was pulling the radio away, and she began yelling. \"I T WAS VERY CONSIDERATE OF YOU,HOW COULD YOU SEE TEN PEOPLE ON THE SIDE OF THE ROAD AND NOT STOP?\" \"Okay, okay, try and keep the channel clear,\" Bill attempted to sooth my mother. \"Dirtbag,\" I heard her mutter under her breath. I stared out the window at the sky. \"We have to get off this road,\" I said. Bill looked at the sky. Right away he knew I was right. \"What, this is no time to second guess,\" Jo started. \"She's right, we have to get off this road, make a right turn, trust me,\" Bill said. \"Do you want to drive?\" Jo asked. I was getting frustrated now. \"Just turn,\" I yelled. Jo turned. Suddenly across the radio, Laurence was announcing that the tornado had touched down. I didn't see it. \"Where is it?\" Jo asked though the radio. \"Looks like it's coming down route 33,\" Laurence answered. \"We're on 33, mom,\" I said. \"What's the path?\" Jo asked. \"It's going 35 mph,\" Joey said. I was getting annoyed, I couldn't see it. \"Where are you guys lookin'\" Rabbit asked. \"Where, where, where,\" I muttered. \"Direction, Rabbit?\" \"North, northeast.\" All I could see were storm clouds, no tornado. I leaned forward in my seat, trying to see. I stopped listening to everyone try and find the tornado and concentrated on finding it myself. Then it began hailing and I couldn't see anymore. \"Kari, get her ready,\" Jo called to me. I slid the window open and slipped through the small space easily, the hail hurt when it hit me, but I still flicked on all the switches. \"Okay, she's on,\" I said, sliding back in. \"Okay, this is good, stop here, Jo,\" Bill ordered. \"Wait, we have to get closer, just a bit closer.\" A tricycle hit the windshield, making me jump. \"No, mom, this is good.\" Jo stopped the truck and both Jo and Bill jumped out to get Dorothy. I slid back out the window to help. When I noticed that it wasn't going to work, I began to et worried. Suddenly, I telephone pole swooped down and hit the machine, causing all the sensors to scatter over the road. It was gone the tornado was gone. I climbed out of the truck. \"It's coming back,\" I heard Bill yell, but my mom still went to the sencors, picking them up. Bill pulled her to the truck, and I climbed back in. He drove the truck backwards, but after a couple minutes, Jo jumped back out and started to pick up the sensors again. Bill got out, me right behind him. \"Forget it, Jo, forget it.\" \"Help me, help me,\" Jo screamed. \"What are you doing?\" Bill yelled back. \"Help me!\" \"The pack in wasted, Jo, it's over.\" Jo refused to believe this. \"What's the matter with you? We can still do this!\" \"Jesus Christ, listen to yourself, you're obsessed,\" Bill yelled, but not as loudly as before. \"You've never seen what that thing can do, so don't talk to me about-\" Jo cried. Bill was starting to get slightly annoyed, but he didn't show it. \"I just saw it-\" \"You've never seen it miss house, and miss that house and come after you,\" \"Christ Jo, is that what you think happened?\" Jo shook her head, and turned to walk away. \"I don't know.\" I stood by the truck, watching. \"Jesus, Jo, why can't you just forget it?\" \"You don't understand, okay? You'll never know.\" \"When's it gonna be enough, huh? How close do you have to get-? Jo, things go wrong, you can't explain it, you can't predict it! Killing yourself won't bring your dad back. I'm sorry he died, but it was a long time ago. You gotta move on. Stop living in the past and look at what you've got right in front of you!\" Bill had grabbed Jo's arm and pulled her back. \"What are you saying?\" Jo asked, her voice now low. \"Me, Jo, me and Kari,\" Bill pulled her into a hug. I walked over and joined the hug. Just like old times, only minus one person. \"I'm sorry, dad,\" I whispered. We were at a drive-in movie. The Shining. I didn't really care for the movie, so I was helping my mom get coffee for everyone. \"Excuse me, can I have eight coffees to go please?\" The woman working nodded. I saw my mom reach in and grab a pen. She was going to sign the divorce papers. I went and sat at a table, my eyes looking at the movie playing, but not absorbing it at all. I could hear thunder in the background, and see some lightning, but not enough to worry me. Yawning, I shut my eyes for a minute. I listened for my mom's voice, but I couldn't hear what she was actually saying. Then Dusty's voice rang out over top of everything. \"JO! BILL! IT'S COMING! IT'S HEADED RIGHT FOR US!\" \"It's already here,\" I heard my dad yell. \"EVERYBODY UNDERGROUND NOW\" People were already running toward a large warehouse of sorts. My mom didn't listen to Bill as he ran off, probably to Melissa. I got up and walked to her side. She was staring at the tornado. \"Mom, come on,\" I said, tugging at her hand. Suddenly, she snapped out of whatever was holding her there, still holding my hand she turned and ran to the snack bar. \"GET UNDERGROUND, TAKE COVER RIGHT NOW, LET'S GO!\" She pulled me along with er to where Bill and Dusty were standing, waiting for us. I pulled my hand away when I noticed Laurence hiding in his car. \"Come on, take my hand,\" I yelled, reaching towards Laurence. He shook his head. \"I can't.\" \"Take my hand,\" I insisted. He did, and I help him climb out, then we both ran for the warehouse. Everyone had gathered into the pit inside, all sitting on the floor, holding onto those dearest to them. I ran towards my mom. We held onto each other's hands tightly. The whole warehouse began to shake, and the windows break. I heard Bill yell something, but I didn't hear what. A high pressure air hose came loose, and Preacher grabbed it, only moments later, a hub cap flew down cut across his forehead. My mom let go of me and crawled over to him, placing her hand over the cut. Melissa was only a couple feet away from me, and she was screaming. I put my hands over my ears to block her out. With my hands over my ears, I couldn't block my head, and a beam fell down, and sliced across my head. I could feel the warm blood oozing out, and it made tracks down the side of my face. Bill left go of Melissa, and crawled to me. \"Its okay, Kari,\" he said, putting his hand over my injury to keep it from getting dirty. I couldn't reply, because all that would come out would be a moan from the pain. This wasn't the first time that I'd been hurt because of a tornado, actually, it wasn't even the second. But the worst was when I was fourteen. In a few minutes, the tornado was gone. People were already getting up and leaving the warehouse to go check damages. Bill helped me get up, and walk outside. My mom hadn't seen me get hurt, and when she saw me, her face went pale and she rushed over. \"Kathryn, oh, my god, are you alright?\" I nodded, a little annoyed that once again, my full name had been used. Bill disappeared while my mom got a wet cloth and pressed it against my head. I held it there while she cleaned off my face. \"That's all I can do unless you want to go to a hospital,\" my mom told me. \"No, I want to stay with you,\" I answered. My mom just nodded, and began cleaning up the wet cloths. I walked over to Dusty who was sitting in his van, watching weather reports. \"Can you tell where it's headed?\" I asked. My mom came up behind me, just before Dusty answered. \"It's backing northeast…um, Jo? It looks to hit Wakita head on.\" \"I'm goin'. I'm goin', let's go, let's go!\" my mom began to head for the truck. Everyone began getting frantic. \"Where's the phone?\" I asked. \"The lines are down, I already tried, Kari,\" Beltzer answered me. I turned and headed for the truck, passing Bill and Melissa on the way. \"You know, I can't compete with this. I don't even know where to start!\" Melissa had a fake smile on her face. \"Wait, don't do this now, please. Please,\" Bill pleaded. I didn't wait around to hear anymore. I climbed into the backseat of the truck, choosing the middle seat so I could see better. My mom climbed in next, along with Bill. It only took us around an hour to get there, maybe less because my mom was speeding. When we drove into Wakita, it was a familiar memory for both me and my mom. \"They had no warning,\" I whispered. \"Oh, my god,\" my mom said, jumping out of the truck, and running towards aunt Meg's house, which now looked like a one story house. I climbed out after her, and ran to the base of the house. My mom was climbing up, looking for a way in. \"Meg?\" Bill climbed up after her, and they both disappeared into the house. I stood still waiting for them to return. Every time the house buckled, I flinched. Finally, an they came out, each helping Meg walk. \"Somebody get an ambulance,\" Bill yelled. I don't know who ran to get it, but a moment later, it was there, with Meg inside. \"Is she okay?\" my mom asked when Bill ran back to the house to get Mose, Meg's dog. \"We'll probably keep her overnight, just to be safe,\" a paramedic told us. Meg snorted. \"Overnight? Forget it. I'm all right.\" \"You're going to the hospital,\" I told my aunt. Meg gave in. \"Okay, I'll go, but I'm gonna drive myself.\" Rabbit looked a bit disappointed to be the one to tell her, but someone had to. \"Honey, your car in is a tree around the corner.\" I sat on the step of the ambulance, staring at the ground. I saw Dusty's feet, and looked up. \"Jo. I'm sorry, uh, I was listening to the radio, and, I mean, I don't even know if you wanna know, but I, it's happening, the NSSL's predicted an F5,\" Dusty explained. To give them a bit of privacy, I walked back over to Meg's house, staring at the sculptures. I thought hit me. \"What is it?\" Haynes asked me. \"I know how to make Dorothy fly,\" I answered. Bill looked at the sculptures. \"Of course, that makes sense.\" I turned and looked at everyone. \"Okay, we need every aluminum can you can find. Along with duct tape, and cutters.\" Now it was Bill's turn to order something. \"I want the last Dorothy's on the back of my truck.\" All the sensors in Dorothy now were all equipped with pinwheels, to help them fly. I sat in the middle seat in the front so I could help my parents better than sitting in the back. We drove quickly down the empty road that the twister was following. When Bill stopped the truck, we all jumped out to get Dorothy down on the ground, and ready. We all got back into the truck, and got a good distance away to watch. Dorothy was moving back and forth across the road. Bill and my mo had both gotten out to watch, but I stayed put. I watched as a tree branch knocked over Dorothy, and the tornado headed straight for us. They both jumped back into the truck, and Bill tried to drive away, but a large branch slid under the truck, holding us in place. \"Get us off this thing,\" I yelled. \"Come on,\" Bill was stepping on the gas pedal, hard. \"Bill, kick it! BILL! Let's go! Right now! Hurry!\" my mom yelled, right in my ear. Then with Bill still trying to get us off the tree, I heard something. \"What was that?\" I asked. There was a pregnant pause before someone turned to see. Something metallic was flying towards us. My mom was still yelling at Bill to get us off the tree, when I saw what the flying object really was. A tank truck. The truck snaps forward, pushed my the tank truck, which laded in front of us, exploding. Bill drove right through the flames. \"Son of a bitch!\" Bill said, to no on in particular. \"Jo, Bill, Kari? You all right? Fact, can you guys hear me? You okay?\" Dusty's voice came in, crackling over the radio. I grabbed the radio to answer. \"We're okay.\" Now Dusty's voice turned excited. \"Did you see that explosion?\" \"Yeah, we saw it,\" I answered, no humour in my voice. \"This one, she's still moving northeast on 80, you copy?\" Rabbit's voice came in. Bill looked at me, then my mom. \"This is it.\" \"Last one,\" my mom said. \"Last time,\" I finished. Then our attention was turned to Jonas. He was driving up along the road, parallel to the tornado. \"They have position, they could make it,\" Bill commented. I shook my head. \"Not unless they've anchored the pack.\" My mom grabbed the radio. \"Jonas? This is Jo. Can you hear me?\" Jonas sounded annoyed when he answered. \"Not now, Harding.\" \"Jonas, listen to me. The pack is too light, the twister will toss it before it reaches the core, you have to anchor it,\" Jo said quickly. \"Oh, sharing valuable information, Jo? I'll consider that, thank you,\" Jonas replied flatly. \"Jonas, listen to me! Don't be a-\" Bill looked at my mom. \"What? Do you see them?\" I took the radio from my mom. \"Jonas, what's your position?\" \"Oh, howdy, Kari. We are heading northeast running parallel and about to pull ahead of it on the left, why?\" Jonas didn't seem thrilled to hear my voice. Now Bill took the radio from me, he was staring out the window at the tornado. \"Hang back a minute, we've got a pretty good view from back here. She could shift her track, and if she does, she's gonna come right at you! D'you copy?\" Jonas ignored my dad. \"Jonas, listen to me. This is not-\" Bill was getting a bit frustrated. \"Get off this frequency, Bill!\" with that, Jonas turned off his radio. \"Mom, she's shifting,\" I whispered. I was right, the tornado changed direction, heading straight for Jonas and his crew. \"Jonas, I'm telling you…. Eddie, I know you can hear me! Turn around now! Get out of there!\" Bill yelled into the radio. But there wasn't any answer. We watched as all the black Windstars were pulled up into the air. A radio tower crashed into the windshield of Jonas' car. When it fell and crashed into the ground, I flinched. My dad threw the radio onto the dash, clearly pissed off. \"We tried. There was nothing we could do,\" my mom tried to sooth him. \"Yes there is,\" was my dad's reply. Then the radio buzzed to life and Beltzer's voice crackled in. \"Bill, Jo, ground speed is increasing. Get ahead of it as fast as you can or she's gonna bury ya!\" Bill started driving. \"Debris! DUSTY, WE HAVE DEBRIS!\" Jo yelled. Cars, tractors, road signs were falling every where. My mom was directing Bill on driving. \"Right!\" The truck swerved right, while I held on tightly. \"Left!\" The truck swerved to the left, narrowly missing a tractor. \"Right!\" We missed yet another flying object. \"Left!\" Then, I yelled. \"Duck!\" just as a tyre hit the windshield. \"What now?\" Bill asked. I shook my head, while my mom spoke out loud. \"I have no idea.\" Just then, a house rolled onto the road, right in front of us. \"Oh, my god,\" I commented. \"I think we're going in!\" Bill yelled. The truck crashed in through the house. It only lasted for a minute or two before we were clear. \"Maybe we should get off this road.\" \"I think you may be right,\" Jo replied. I looked out the windows. \"Kari, can you get her ready?\" I heard Jo ask me. I opened the back window and slid out. It only took me a couple minutes to turn on all the switches. I slid back into the truck, and climbed into the front seat with my parents. \"She's ready.\" Bill set the cruise control, then looked at us. \"Ready? On three.\" \"One,\" my mom forced her door open. \"Two,\" Bill had his door open. \"Three,\" I said. My mom jumped out, and I followed right behind her. We all stood there, watching the truck being picked up by the twister, all cheering when Dorothy flew. \"Oh, no, run!\" Bill yelled. He grabbed onto my mom's hand and pulled her away. We set off running away from the twister. My mom and dad just a couple feet in front of me. \"The barn!\" I heard someone yell. We ran up a hill towards a barn, Bill forced the door to open and we ducked inside. \"Oh, my god, who are these people?\" I cried, looking at all the sharp pointy objects hanging from the ceiling. \"I don't think so,\" Bill replied. We got out of the barn and ran for the next closet building. An old pump house. I tried opening the door, but it wouldn't open. Bill got it though; he pushed me inside before pulling Jo with him. \"These pipes go down at least 30 feet. If we anchor ourselves to it, we should stand a chance.\" Bill said, grabbing some rawhide straps. He connected three of them to the pipes, and we all wiggled out way into the, holding onto the pipe. The walls, and roof only lasted a couple more minutes, and within a couple minutes, the twister was right above us. Looking at it, it pulled me back to my worse memory. Mom was away for a couple weeks doing her job. Aunt Meg was sick, so Ethan and I had to stay with gramma. I had just settled into bed when gramma rushed into my room. \" Hurry, Kathryn, we need to get to the storm cellar, the news says we've got an F5 headed this way, I'll get your brother.\" I grabbed my teddy bear, and followed my gramma out of my room. I waited at the top of the stairs for them. Ethan held my hand as the three of us ran out to the storm cellar. I climbed in first, then Ethan, and lastly gramma. She shut and locked the doors, but I could see that it wouldn't hold. Ethan was closest to the door, gramma always said he was just like grampa. When the tornado hit, we weren't prepared. I was curled up I in the furthest corner, I didn't expect the door to be pulled off, and Ethan and nothing to grab and was sucked up with it. Gramma tried grabbing him, but she got too close and was pulled up too. I was in the corner screaming. When it was gone and I crawled out of the cellar, the nearest neighbours came running over to me. It was Les Arnolds, and his wife and daughter. They wanted to be sure that gramma was okay, but they froze when they saw me crying. When I saw mom a couple hours later, she was in shock. I had to live with aunt Meg for a couple months before I convinced mom I could be home-schooled, and I could go with her that way nothing like that could happen again. The twister slowly faded away. This time, taking none of my family away. I heard music playing as the crew pulled up. \"That was amazing!\" I wasn't listening to my parents argue, instead, I got up and looked at the sky. It was completely blue, not a cloud in sight, and there was a rainbow across the sky. What a beautiful way to end the day, I thought. ","Summary":" I've had this on my laptop for quite a while now, and I finally decided to post it. Basically, the "},{"Movie":"Twister","Title":"Twice the Trouble","Author":"Kittiesrock25","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7842143","Passage":"[Chapter 1] Twice the Trouble A/N: Oh, I love Twister … and I wrote this fic for it! Please enjoy my lovelies….:) Disclaimer: I do not own Twister or any characters except Brandi. A lone red truck drove down the dirt road, standing out in the summer's air. The windows were down and fresh air rolled through the inside, cooling it's passengers. A man and woman, around thirty, sat in the driver and shotgun seats, holding hands as the man drove in silence. \"Um, honey,\" the woman said, breaking the silence, \"are you sure she's going to be there?\" Bill, the man, gave her a knowing smile and glanced back at the road. \"If I know Jo, she's already dragged her whole department into the field. Ah, hell, a day like today, it's to be expected. She forgets everything except her work.\" Bill frowned, remembering the failed marriage between and the woman formerly mentioned. That was exactly why it ended. They just didn't communicate anymore, and the whole thing fell apart. If he was truthful, he still felt something, deep down, as much as he denied those feelings. He wanted to put Jo behind him and bring Melissa into his present. \"You're nervous about seeing her, aren't you?\" Melissa pressed, giving him a look. He chuckled. \"Nervous? No. Why? Do I look nervous?\" he replied. \"No,\" she lied, and then sighed. \"Yeah. Well, a little.\" he groaned and gave her a look. \"I just want to get this over with,\" he sighed, eyes now glued to the dusty road ahead. Melissa pressed farther still. \"But she said she signed the papers, right?\" \"That's what Brandi said,\" he replied, not really about to believe his ex-sister-in-law who hated his guts, but not about to worry Melinda. \"You don't think so?\" \"No, I think so. Give me a kiss.\" Melinda leaned over and pressed her lips to his. ~~~~~_/~~~~~ A couple vans and trucks sat in a deserted field, faced in the direction of an ever-darkening sky. From time to time, a clap of thunder rumbled or a lightning bolt flashed, but the group of people did not seem to intend to leave, actually observing the approaching storm carefully. One man named Beltzer was sitting inside the truck as a woman stood on the top, fumbling with a large machine. \"Okay professor, hang on there,\" he yelled through the roof as he banged on it, \"I think I fixed it. I've got it.\" the woman on the top of the car, a blonde with casual work clothes attempted to turn on the machine but all that happened was a spray of sparks flooding the air. The frustrated Jo cursed aloud. \"Oh fuck. This thing is useless!\" \"Sorry, Jo,\" Beltzer called from inside. Suddenly the machine flickered back to life, and Jo banged on the roof with her foot. \"Wait, wait, wait. Beltzer! That's good. Give me a reading!\" Beltzer clambered out of the truck and walked over to a laptop connected to the Doppler Radar, the machine that was giving them trouble. \"Okay, boss lady, hold your horses,\" he groaned at the impatient blonde. \"Which way do you want it, Jo? Jo looked up at the sky, observing thoughtfully before answering. \"Looks like the dry line has stalled. Give me a sector scan west, northwest, look at mid-levels for rotation and increase the PRF,\" she replied, not looking back. Over in his bus, Dusty kept his eyes on the weather forecasts and videos of old-time singers, with the sound blasting through the horn on the top of the bus. He grinned as he belted out the words. \"If I mistreat you girl, sho' don't mean no harm...\" though off-key, Dusty kept singing through the whole song. Over by their truck, Lawrence and Rabbit were arguing as a woman a couple years younger than Jo and almost an exact twin to her with brown hair watched, amused. \"All I'm saying is don't fold the maps!\" Rabbit insisted, glaring at the other storm chaser. \"I didn't fold the map!\"Lawrence defended, holding his hands up, but Rabbit kept fuming. \"Yeah,\" he said through teeth, \"well Kansas is a mess, there's a big crease right through Wichita-\" he took the map he was holding a rolled it, and held it out for Lawrence to see. \"Roll the maps.\" Brandi walked over, arms crossed over her chest. She stopped in front of them with a smirk. \"Don't you boys have anything else to do?\" she asked. \"Go! Get to work!\" they nodded with grins. Even though Brandi was younger than them, she meant business and she was not a force to be reckoned with. Before Brandi could order them around anymore, a red truck, Bill's red truck, pulled into the field. Nobody except Brandi recognized it, from when Bill told her he had always wanted a red truck. Her eyes widened and her mouth dropped. What was he doing here? \"Son of a bitch!\" she muttered, and stormed away towards Jo. Bill got out of the truck, grinning as Rabbit, Dusty, and Sanders came to meet him. They were all grinning as they saw their old friend again. \"What do you know, the storm chasers,\" he commented as they greeted him. \"Hey, I don't believe it! Who is that handsome devil!\" Rabbit exclaimed, and Bill nodded to him. \"Gentleman,\" he replied with a grin. \"The Extreme! IT'S THE EXTREME!\" Dusty shouted in a goofy tone. He laughed out loud. And Bill joined in. \"Oh man, don't start that shit,\" he groaned and Dusty laughed again. Dusty rolled his eyes at Bill's outstretched hand. \"Oh manly hand shakin' Zeus. How you doin', man?\" he asked, hoping to catch up on Bill's life. He had left several months ago, two days after he filed from divorce from Jo. The truth was they all really missed him. Except for Brandi. \"Doin' great, doin' great,\" he replied, and Dusty let out another laugh. \"Oh bad!\" Melissa climbed out of the car, silently watching the exchange. Dusty came off a bit... odd to her. Something wasn't right with him. She shook her head as Bill beckoned her over. \"Dusty, I'd like you to meet Melissa,\" he introduced, placing an arm around her shoulders. She smiled as he continued. \"Melissa, this is Dusty. Dustman's been chasing with us ever since we started.\" he spoke proudly. Melissa stretched out her hand and Dusty took it with a firm shake. Bill then got to business. \"Listen man, where's Jo?\" Dusty pointed over to Beltzer's truck. \"She's over by Doppler. Broke down again, running out of grant money.\" Bill nodded, with an ounce of remorse as he thought about this shutting down. He then turned to Melissa, ready to get this over with and cut ties with this part of his past. \"Honey, why don't you hang out here for a little while, I'll- I'll be right back.\" Melissa smiled at him. \"Okay,\" she replied. He turned to Dusty. \"Dusty, why don't you explain to Melissa...why you are the way you are!\" they grinned and chuckled as Dusty started to lead a distracted Melissa away. \"Come on. Man. Jo's gonna wig when she sees he's back,\" he commented, more to himself than Melissa. Bill, hearing this, groaned and gived him a stern look. \"I'm not back,\" he said and kept walking. Preacher, another man on the team and an old friend of Bill's came up to him and smiled. \"The prodigal son returns,\" he commented. Bills smiles and keeps walking, clapping a hand over Joey's shoulder, who is looking at a weather instrument and taking notes. \"Hey Joey,\" Bill greeted and continued to walk. Joey stared after him, surprised. \"Hey Bill,\" he called after him, staring with wide eyes as he reached Beltzer's van. Bill could already see Brandi's disapproving and angered eyes upon him. He tried to ignore it as he set his sights for Jo, who had noticed him but not acknowledged him as she continued her work with the Doppler. Oh no, Bill thought, this would be trouble. So, like? Not like? Well... I have all chapters written out, so more to come soon! This is property of Twister, the main storyline and much of the script. Obviously, I tweaked some things.

However, this time, instead of yelling the snack-bar girls to run over to the closest shed, which was a few metres away, she stood still, staring at the sky, thoughtfully. This used to happen whenever an upcoming tornado caught her off-guard, when she wasn't with the rest of her fellow Twister-chasers on their pick-ups, with the adrenaline flowing quickly and wildly during the chase. Now, even if she was among them, she felt lonely, and alone at that precise moment. And it was in those moments, when she was alone and the wind blowed strongly, that the strong, risky and intrepid woman turned into a little, defenseless girl that stares at the sky, knowing that things aren't well... but not knowing what's wrong. Feeling like the little girl she had once been, she stared at the whirlpolling winds, feeling that something's wrong. Her adult self would start telling everyone to get to a safer place, but now, the little girl within took control over her. And so she stays, staring at the sky... \"That day the wind must have been funny, too\", a voice speakes in her head. \"A few moments before it happenned, though. The rest of the day must have been really dull and quiet\", her adult-self corrected her own self, bitterly. No one had warned them. They couldn't do anything against it. She barely escaped. Her father couldn't. The twister had come right towards her, and ended up taking her father away from her. \"It came after me. It evaded so many houses, but not mine!\", the voice whined. She felt the strong breeze bumping into her. It remided her of that day. If only someone had warned them... only five minutes could have made the difference. With those five minutes, her father could have gotten into the basement safely, and she wouldn't have had to see how that twister caught him and took him away... \"Jo!\", Billy's voice resounds in her head. She stares at both sides, confused. Slowly, the spell breaks, and she starts to gain her adult-self consciousness again. Time starts flowing in the right way, and the little girl gives her place to the risky woman. \"Jo, come on!\" The spell's finally over. The little girl's now faded into the woman, who still yearns for her father, and doesn't want others to suffer what she did. Something has to be done about twisters. Someone has to warn the rest of the people, unaware of what's coming. It's time to get in action...

M.E.O.W.S. was accepted to celebrate with them because they helped. The war was hard to win. A lot of agents died. Tab, leader of M.E.O.W.S., was the one who made the agency. Before this happened, Liberty, Tab's wife, had a litter of four kittens. When the war was over, Tab, Liberty, their half-grown sons and daughters, and some agents, went to celebrate DOG HQ. One of their sons, Midnight, had a secret. His brother, Leopard, bully's Midnight because he likes to. That was Midnight's secret. The reason why he doesn't tell his mother or father, because Leopard threatened Midnight, that if he ever told Tab or Liberty about this, he would kill him. When they were at DOG HQ, Leopard said to Midnight somewhere in DOG HQ was gold. Midnight and Leopard explored a different place in DOG HQ that no dog used it yet. When Midnight explored the place, Leopard jumped out of nowhere and attacked Midnight. Midnight earned a lot of scars from the attack. When Leopard was ready to do another attack, he hesitated. Midnight managed to pin him down. Leopard shoved him and Leopard jumped. Midnight went under him and bit his hind left leg hard. Midnight heard a growl. It was Tab. When they stopped fighting, Tab punished Midnight for doing this. Midnight noticed that Tab saw only the part where he pinned his brother down and saw the whole thing. Tab went to talk to Liberty. Midnight was spying on them. He overheard that Tab doesn't need him because what he was doing. Midnight became angry. He felt like he wanted revenge. Then he had an idea. Midnight tricked some dogs that there are evil cats up in surface, down town. When they were at the surface, dogs started to attack innocent cats and some humans. Midnight created a huge fire and the dogs were too busy to notice. Midnight challenged a small grey cat but then a huge Siamese attacked him. He was the father of the little cat. When Midnight gave up his challenge to the huge cat, he ran to the forest. Midnight still wanted revenge so he ran after him. There was a fence blocking the Siamese's way and there was no escape. Something came to Midnight's mind. The only way to ruin the little cat's heart is to kill the father. Midnight attacked the Siamese. When he pinned him down, he clawed his throat and his heart. Blood squirted on Midnight's pelt. The Siamese lost all of his lives and he was dead. Midnight licked the warm blood and he felt proud from what he did. When it was over, he went to Tab and Liberty. When he entered the room, happiness showed in his eyes but in their eyes, he saw horror. Tab banished him to somewhere that he would be locked up forever. Midnight said that one day he would have his revenge. When he went to jail, the DOG HQ leader punished the dogs that were tricked and betrayed M.E.O.E.W.S. as an enemy because of Midnight. Many days past, Midnight thought of what he did. Leopard created this monster. This blood-thirsty monster waiting to kill. If Midnight found Leopard, he would say thank you for creating this monster and kill him. One day, he disappeared without a trace. No one ever heard of him ever since, until now. PRESENT A scary robot dog was walking in the shadows. There were blood stains on him. His name is Scrouge. He stopped walking and sat down. \"It's almost done, sir\", said Scrouge. A black cat walked out of the shadows. It was Midnight. \"Good. When it's done, start it up and test it on DOG HQ. The world will be mine to rule\", said Midnight. There it is. If your wondering what Leopard looks like it's by his name. He looks like a leopard. This story in the past. Not even when Diggs was in DOG HQ. It would be easier to understand if you read my story called Catherine's Life. BYE![Chapter 2] Diggs opened his eyes. Sunshine was coming out the window. He was at his owner's house. His owner is named Shane. When Diggs was younger, he was in the kennel. His former owner never came back to him. He had a hard life until Shane came. Shane took him as a police dog and they were partners ever since. But whatever Diggs do in any mission is messing it up. He kept going back to the kennel which he doesn't like. But Diggs is no ordinary dog. He's an agent working for DOG HQ. Kitty Galore tried to take over the world but there was one problem. Cats and dogs have to work together. Working with Catherine was a tough thing and they always argue a lot. When Butch, his best friend and partner, put him out of the team because of his doings. Diggs thought no one would go against Butch about letting him go. When Butch and Seamus, the dumb bird, left him, Catherine didn't. She saw that Diggs hurt his paw. Catherine invited Diggs into her home. Diggs told Catherine about his past. Catherine was sad to hear it but she gave him advice about him being a cop dog. The next moment he sees M.E.O.W.S. The next thing he knows is that he defeated Kitty Galore. DOG HQ and M.E.O.W.S. were at peace. Diggs and Catherine were partners. Seamus flew away to somewhere that Diggs doesn't know. When Diggs remembered Catherine's advice, he was becoming a better cop dog. DOG HQ and M.E.O.W.S. agreed that they would make another agency called NEST PATROL. There's supposed to be agents of their own in the agency. The agents are supposed to be strong and smart agents. Lou and Tab picked Diggs as a leader of NEST PATROL. Everything was hard for him. Diggs began to change. He's not being fun and his voice changed to rough. There will always be DOG HQ and M.E.O.W.S. Diggs looked at the window. Morning already, thought Diggs. He noticed that he having a hard time of sleeping. When Shane's wife had a baby, it was crying a lot at night. Diggs struggled to get up on his four paws. It was time for him to take a little visit to DOG HQ. When he got to DOG HQ, he noticed that Tab was there, too. He's been paying a lot of visits lately. He's deputy, Steve, was with him. Steve is a white tom. Diggs sat down and took a long look of DOG HQ. He heard footsteps. He looked on his left shoulder and saw an old white dog, Butch. \"Good to see you again. How are NEST PATROL and you being a leader?\" rasped Butch. Diggs took a long sigh. Everything was happening so fast. Theirs even more things in his life that needs to be told. \"NEST PATROL is fine but me as a leader?\" said Diggs. \"I don't know if I'm a good leader or not.\" \"You'll be just fine. When Lou became leader, he was nervous if he was good or not. It turns out to easy to him now,\" said Butch. What Butch said isn't helping Diggs at all. He was still worried if he wasn't right to be a leader. He saw Tab looking at him. Tab was on the 2nd floor, on the edge of Lou's office. Making eye contact, Tab looked worried. Butch saw what he was staring at. \"I forgot to tell you that Tab wants to see you. He's got some news for you,\" rasped Butch. Since there was peace, Tab was happy and has been visiting us. He remembered the last time he talked to him. He seemed proud and nice. Whatever he says is always wise. He's been teased by other dogs that he's fat but he's not. Diggs felt angry at the dogs who teased him. Diggs got up and walked till he reached the stairs. When he was on the 2nd floor, Tab walked over to Diggs and greeted him. \"Hello Diggs, it's been a long time since we talked. I've got some news,\" said Tab. \"It's about Catherine.\" Diggs' belly tightened. Catherine was a good friend and it's been a long time seeing her ever since he became leader. \"She was patrolling the surface with some cats to find any enemy's. From what happened, you need to come the us,\" said Tab. Tab, Diggs, and Steve walked in the DOG HQ hospital. Tab turned to Diggs. \"The reason we brought you here is….,\" said Tab. He didn't finish the sentence. Tab bowed his head with worry. Diggs want the urge to tell Tab want happened but he doesn't want to be rude. Diggs turned his head to Steve. Steve was worried, too. Diggs had heard about him in stories. He heard that he is full with pride, courage, and bravery. He was strong cat and he protects who he loves. He is the same as Tab. \"Come with me,\" said Steve. Steve walked and Diggs followed. He noticed that Tab was following, too. They walked into room 5. When the door opened, he saw two wounded agents and Catherine. There were battle scars all over her. A girl dog was putting something on her wounds. She was standing on all four paws and breathing. Her eyes were closed, struggling from the pain. There was a trail of blood down her mouth. Diggs was relieved that she was alive, not dead. Diggs walked over to her. \"Catherine, are you okay,\" said Diggs. Her struggling stopped and opened her eyes. She seemed happy to see him. \"Hi Diggs. I know it's a bad time to see me like this. Two robot cats jumped us. The other cats lost a few lives but I still have all mine,\" said Catherine. Diggs turned around to see Tab and Steve talking about something but he didn't care. After the defeat of Kitty Galore, he felt like DOG HQ and M.E.O.W.S. are hiding some dark secret from him and a few agents. \"Catherine, describe what they look like,\" said Diggs. Catherine's eyes widened by what he said. \"The first one looked very scary. I can't describe it. He had blood stains all over him like he killed something more than once,\" explained Catherine. Maybe if he saw that robot, he might be frightened as her. Diggs had the urge to tell Catherine more. \"The second one was…,\" said Catherine. Her voice trailed away. Diggs got worried. \"Who was it,\" urged Diggs. Catherine looked at Diggs. They made eye contact. \"The one you killed a long time ago,…Paws,\" said Catherine.[Chapter 3] Diggs was surprised at her answer. He turned away and saw Tab and Steve. Tab and Diggs made eye contact. While that happened, the dog that was tending Catherine's wounds, left. Tab looked away. \"I'll leave you two to talk it out,\" said Tab. Tab and Steve got up and left. Steve stopped before he left and looked back at Diggs. \"Good luck,\" said Steve. Diggs stared at him. Suddenly a surge of anger flowed in him but tried his best not to show it. How could he say that now when my enemy has come back, thought Diggs. Diggs started to cool down. \"Good luck doesn't change anything,\" replied Diggs. Steve dipped his head and continued walking. The door shut and everything was quiet. Catherine and Diggs made eye contact. Diggs looked at the two injured agents that were on the hospital beds. Their wounds were covered in bandages and they were breathing heavily. How come they get a lot of wounds and they loosed lives, thought Diggs. He turned his attention to Catherine. Catherine only has few wounds and still has all nine lives, thought Diggs. Catherine stared at Diggs. \"I know what your thinkin-,\" said Catherine. Diggs interrupted her without letting her finish. \"Your keeping something from me, are you,\" growled Diggs. Catherine was silent. Diggs started growled at Catherine. He decided to put Catherine in a test. Diggs leaped at Catherine. Catherine went under and aimed from his belly gently. Diggs was unbalanced and hit the floor. He got up ready to take the next leap at Catherine. Catherine ran at him like a bolt of lightning. He felt a power surge hit him. He fell on his back and Catherine was on top of him. Catherine was goanna do death blow on him but didn't. She was frozen. \"How can a young agent like that learn those moves,\" growled Diggs. Catherine stared at Diggs and got off him. He got up and sat down, waiting for an answer. \"I'm an assassin,\" said Catherine. Diggs was surprised at her answer. \"You mean you're working for the evil cats,\" said Diggs. Catherine looked at him in surprise. \"No. M.E.O.W.S. wanted two assassins. Tab trained me to be an assassin. Now, I'm one of them,\" explained Catherine. Diggs needed more information. He got up and walked to Catherine. \"Why did M.E.O.W.S. want assassins,\" questioned Diggs. Catherine looked at Diggs. \"They wanted something to protect them like guardians. Mike and I were the chosen ones. You remember Mike do you?\" replied Catherine. Diggs remembered the day that Catherine introduced Mike in front of him. Mike was a young Siamese tom. He was very nice, honest, and truthful. She said the Mike was his old partner. Diggs nodded. He was surprised that Mike was the assassin, too. \"I think we need to go to M.E.O.W.S. to tell everyone you're okay,\" said Diggs. Catherine nodded. Catherine and Diggs got up and walked out of the DOG HQ hospital. All of a sudden, a golden retriever came running toward them. She looked worried. Diggs recognized her. Her name was Carly. When Diggs, Catherine, and Diggs' apprentice, Charlie, went on a journey to find their home. A lot of dangers came. Catherine was nearly drowned in the river and fall down a water fall. Diggs hadn't had enough strength to save her. They found Catherine the next day, still had all of her nine lives. When they were on the other side of the city, all they need to do is to find the Golden Bridge to get to their main home. Along the way, they found a female golden retriever and a male dark chocolate brown dog. Their name was Carly and Rocky. Carly had nothing on her and Rocky had a black collar with round, small, shiny, object. It also has the same thing from what he is wearing on his left paw. He also had a scar on his eye although his eye is fine. Diggs fell in love with Carly. Carly said she doesn't trust humans because of Rocky. She said when Rocky was pup, he was a Christmas present. When a boy went to a present, his father wanted him to have him but he said no. So, the father put him in the streets. Diggs had to show that they can trust humans. There was a fire in a home and Diggs went in to try to save a boy. He got the boy out of the house and Catherine saved an innocent kitten. There was still one more person in the fire and Rocky knows want to do. Rocky and Carly ran in the burning building and got an adult male out. The humans said thank you to the dogs. Rocky and Carly was trusting humans and Rocky offered them to show them to The Golden Bridge. Diggs was telling them about DOG HQ and how they protect the earth from evil cats. Rocky and Carly offered to join DOG HQ and Diggs said yes. Along the way, they were jumped by dogs. Charlie was injured very badly. They made it through but then Charlie fell in a big hole. Diggs got in the hole and Charlie was dead. Diggs and Catherine finally found their home. DOG HQ has accepted Rocky and Carly to be agents and Diggs mentored them. Carly didn't felt like she could be an agent. She sees one dead agent and she wanted to help the poor dog. She offered to be a hospital dog instead of an agent. Carly was the top hospital dog and Rocky is now a good agent. Diggs saw Carly rushing toward them. \"I heard about Catherine. Is she okay,\" Carly said with worry. Diggs felt very happy to see her. Maybe I should keep Catherine's secret about her being an assassin, thought Diggs. \"She's fine and she still has all of her lives. Catherine and I are going to M.E.O.W.S. to tell them Catherine is okay. There are two other agents that are injured. I think you should check on them,\" said Diggs. Carly nodded. She walked over to the hospital station. Diggs and Catherine finally got to M.E.O.W.S. and a male Siamese appeared. It was Mike. He ran to Catherine, worried. \"Catherine, are you okay?\" Mike questioned with worry. Catherine nodded. Diggs looked at Mike. \"We're goanna tell M.E.O.W.S. that Catherine is okay,\" said Diggs. Mike stayed with them. Somehow, Diggs still smelled worry on him. Why could he be so worried about Catherine, thought Diggs. Diggs saw Tab talking with another agent. Catherine was looking at them. \"Guys, I'm goanna talk to Tab alone. You two stay here,\" ordered Catherine. Diggs felt being stupid by following Catherine's commands even though he is a leader. He saw Catherine walking to Tab. She said something and they went in Tab's office. Diggs looked at Mike. \"I know you're an assassin. Catherine told me,\" said Diggs. Mike wasn't surprised at all. \"I knew one day, Catherine will tell you,\" said Mike. Diggs saw a male dark grey cat walking toward them. He stopped in front of them. He looked at Diggs with a challenging look. \"You think you can be friends with him? Good luck,\" he laughed. The dark grey cat walked away from them. Diggs knows that the cat mentioned Mike. He looked at Mike. \"It seems like you don't have many friends,\" said Diggs. Mike nodded. \"His name is Ash. He's like a bully to me. He also has a best friend that doesn't like me. His name is Knight. He's Tab's son so I wouldn't challenge him if I were you,\" explained Mike. Diggs was surprised to hear that Tab has a son. He saw Tab and Catherine walked out of Tab's office. Tab called a meeting. Cats gathered around in the center of M.E.O.W.S. Diggs and Mike joined them. Tab, Catherine, and Steve were on a ledge so Tab can look at the cats and speak to them freely. \"To let all cats know that Catherine is okay but we need to increase our portals ever since Catherine was attacked. Remember; don't leave your partner behind. A secret has been revealed. Diggs, the strong leader of NEST POTRAL, knows that Catherine and Mike are assassins. I guess DOG HQ would like to know that, too. Tomorrow, some of our agents will go to Lou and tell him,\" addressed Tab. There were some worried whispers around him. He saw a dark grey cat that looks the same as Ash but has a battle scar on his on his eye. The cat looked at Diggs with a challenging look. \"Diggs the strong leader of NEST POTRAL. Don't look so strong to me,\" he growled. Diggs felt like he wanted to accept the challenge. Diggs growled back. \"Knight, stand down,\" growled Tab. Knight didn't say a word. Diggs looked up at Tab. \"I think it would be better if I talk to Lou alone,\" said Diggs. Tab nodded. Diggs heard laughter behind him. He turned around to see Ash and Knight. \"I think I'll find it funny. Once Diggs tells Lou about Catherine and Mike being assassins, Lou would bite his ears off,\" hissed Ash. Diggs felt anger follow in him. He got up and turned to them with a challenging glare. Tab yowled to order Ash and Knight to stop but they ignore him. \"Come on, Ash. Let's teach him a lesson of not being here,\" growled Knight. Diggs accepted the challenge. Here we go, thought Diggs. Knight ran toward Diggs and jumped.[Chapter 4] Knight ran toward Diggs and jumped. Knight's claws slid out and Diggs jumped. Knight managed to put his paws on Diggs' cheast and push him to the ground. Diggs had a grip on Knight's leg and pushed him off. Diggs got up and took a few breaths. Diggs hesitated and Knight ran toward him. Knight clawed him at the side of his face. Diggs felt the sting of pain and he tasted blood in his mouth. It was Ash's turned he ran jumped. Diggs went under Ash's jump and griped on his leg. Diggs pushed him down on the floor. Diggs let go of Ash's leg and Ash got up. Knight ran to his side. Knight jumped and Diggs bit him in the chest. Diggs tasted warm blood. Knight shrieked of pain. Diggs got worried. He let go of him. He saw Knight standing and he was okay. He was relieved he was okay or he had to face Tab alone. Diggs felt pain his back. Ash was on his back and was hurting him with his claws. Knight pinned Diggs down and Ash got off of him. Knight slid his claws out and raised his paw. He was goanna do a death blow on Diggs. \"Say goodbye Diggs,\" hissed Knight. Suddenly, Mike ran toward Knight and pushed him off of Diggs. Diggs got up. \"This is my battle!\" growled Diggs. Mike turned to him. \"I won't let you suffer from this!\" yowled Mike. Mike turned around and attacked Ash. Knight jumped and pinned Diggs down, again. When did I become weak! , thought Diggs. Diggs got him by the leg and pushed him off. He lets go of his leg and pinned him down. Diggs snarled. He looked at Tab. Tab looked angry. Diggs decided to keep Knight pinned down till the battle is over. He turned his head around to see Mike pinned down by Ash. Diggs saw a big deep scare on Mike's shoulder. Ash raised his paw ready to a death blow. This time Catherine came in the battle scene. She was running toward Ash faster than ever and pushed him off. Ash hit the floor and got up. Catherine slid out her claws and clawed him right side of his face. Blood came down on Ash's face. Catherine jumped at him and pinned him down. Suddenly there was a loud yowl. It was Tab. Diggs got off of Knight and Catherine got off of Ash. Tab stared at Knight and Ash. \"I had enough of this. Ash, get some hospital cats and Knight, get in my office,\" growled Tab. Ash turned around and went to find some hospital cats. Knight passed Tab and walked on walked on stairs to his Tab's office. Tab looked at Catherine and Mike. \"Mike, when your wound is treated, go get some rest. Catherine, when the hospital cat checked you, go to your home and rest,\" ordered Tab. Tab finally calms down. Catherine and Mike stayed where they are. Tab looked at Diggs. \"When I'm done talking to Knight, come to my office,\" said Tab with a calming look. Tab turned around and walked to his office. Diggs walked up the stairs and he saw other cats going back to their business. Diggs sat near the entrance of M.E.O.W.S. Two hospital cats where checking Catherine and Mike for any wounds. When they were done, Catherine walk to the entrance. The door opened for Catherine and she went through without even looking at Diggs or saying good bye. Diggs saw Mike walking to Diggs. Mike sat down next to him. \"Where's your home?\" questioned Diggs. Mike didn't look at Diggs. \"I don't have a home with humans. My home is here,\" said Mike. Diggs somehow liked what he said. Sometimes when Diggs keeps visiting DOG HQ, he feels like it's his home. Diggs was kind of sorry for Mike for not having a proper home, where humans feed him and love him. \"Thanks for helping me when nobody else can,\" said Diggs. Mike looked at Diggs and nodded. \"I think you were lucky to be Catherine's partner,\" Diggs went on. Diggs saw happiness in his eyes. \"Yes, she was a good partner. She has far more skills that I've ever seen. She was trained by Tab and I was trained by Steve,\" said Mike. Diggs was pleased from what he was saying. \"It's good for you and Catherine to be trained by them. They are both strong and wise. Now you and Catherine must carry on from what you have learned,\" said Diggs. A dusty brown tom came up to Mike. He looked at him hard. \"You better get some rest,\" he ordered. Mike got up and went in to room 8. Diggs looked at the cat. \"Who are you?\" questioned Diggs. The tom straightened up quickly. \"Name's Tony. I'm one of the senior agents, sir,\" said Tony with stern in his voice. Diggs remembered that when a deputy dies, one of the senior agents get to be picked by a deputy. Diggs looked at Tony. \"Tell me, Tony. Is Catherine and Mike a senior agent even they're an assassin?\" questioned Diggs. Tony stared at him and then responded. \"Yes, sir,\" replied Tony. Diggs felt like he was one of his agents but he was not. \"Good. You can carry back to your duties,\" ordered Diggs. Tony dipped his head, turned around, and walked. Diggs saw Knight going out of Tab's office. Diggs walked to Tab's office. The doors opened and Diggs walked. He heard the doors shut behind him. Tab was sitting in his desk. Tab looked at him. He didn't say a word. Diggs was the first one to speak. \"I'm sorry that I attacked one of your sons and broke your code of not fighting in the agency,\" said Diggs. Diggs felt like he was an agent, not leader. Once, DOG HQ hears this, they're sure to be laughing at me because they're think I'm stupid, thought Diggs. A leader apologizing to another leader does feel kind of stupid. \"I accept your apologize but that wasn't what I wanted to hear. I'm sorry for my agents acting this way. My agents will never fight an agent or leader. I will punish them for breaking my code and fighting a leader,\" said Tab. Diggs accepted his apology. \"I think it would be best if you talk to Lou alone. Let's hope it would be okay. I think you do know that Steve trained and I trained Catherine,\" Tab went on. Diggs nodded. \"It's strange that I see your spirit just like them. Diggs, you have strength and truth like Mike and you have trust and loyalty like Catherine,\" said Tab. Diggs was very pleased. If I do have strength, why didn't I put a lot of hurt into those cats who attacked me, thought Diggs. Diggs looked through the glass door to see the agent doing their duties. He looked at Tab. Maybe it's because they are Tab's agent and Tab would be angry if he killed one of his agents, thought Diggs. Diggs got up on his four paws. \"I think I should go to DOG HQ,\" said Diggs. Tab nodded and responded back. \"I think you should check that wound on your face when you get to DOG HQ,\" said Tab. Diggs nodded. Diggs padded out of his office and went back to DOG HQ. Diggs went through the entrance of DOG HQ. Dogs were doing their duties and some agents gathered a portal. Diggs went to the hospital station. He walked to a hospital dog. \"Can I see Carly, please,\" Diggs said firmly. The hospital dog nodded. The hospital dog turned around and went to get Carly. A minute past, he saw Carly walking up to him. Carly was surprised to see a wound on his face. \"You better come with me,\" said Carly. Carly put something on Diggs' face. A surge of pain hit Diggs. Carly turned around and put her stuff together. Diggs stared at Carly while she was doing her work. \"Carly, I was in a battle,\" said Diggs. Carly stopped what she was doing. She turned her head to Diggs. \"I know. Catherine told me on the…whatever the thing was on the collar,\" said Carly. Diggs notice that she didn't know what was in her collar yet. \"She ignored me when she left,\" said Diggs. Carly walked up to Diggs, staring at him. \"The reason why she ignored you because you are drawing apart from her of being friends,\" said Carly. Diggs stared at Carly in disbelief. \"I don't understand,\" said Diggs. Carly turned around and stared at the floor. \"When Catherine saw you battle those cats, she told me that you might have died. She told me something's in her life was hard for her. So whenever you or any of her friends fight, she will think they would die. She can't handle it, Diggs,\" explained Carly. She went back to putting her stuff together. \"What am I supposed to do?\" questioned Diggs. Carly stand there for a while, thinking. Finally, responded. \"I guess you can try to say sorry. If it gets rough, I think of another reason,\" replied Carly. Diggs entered Lou's office. Lou was at his desk, relaxing. Diggs sat in front of his desk. Lou looked at Diggs. \"What do you want?\" questioned Lou. Diggs was thinking in his mind. What if I mess up? What if Lou would be mad at me? What if Lou wants war with M.E.O.W.S.? All this questions was going through Diggs' head. Then he noticed that Lou was waiting for his answer. \"I have news. M.E.O.W.S. was keeping a secret but I was the one who revealed the secret,\" said Diggs. Lou stared at Diggs. \"I'm listening,\" said Lou. Diggs looked at the floor. \"The secret is that Catherine and this other cat, Mike, are assassins,\" said Diggs. Lou still stared at Diggs. Diggs looked at Lou. He doesn't seem to be mad, thought Diggs. \"That's good news. With assassins on our side, I'm sure DOG HQ and M.E.O.W.S. will not lose a battle between evil cats,\" said Lou. Diggs sighed a relief. Lou stared Diggs. \"What would you think I would do? Start a war? No, M.E.O.W.S. is our friends. We will never betray them,\" said Lou. Diggs was pleased from what Lou said. \"Where did you get that battle scar?\" said Lou. Diggs stared at Lou. \"A few of M.E.O.W.S. agent start a battle with me. Then Mike and Catherine came to help me. Tab stopped the battle,\" explained Diggs. Lou stared at Diggs in disbelief. \"That I didn't like to hear,\" said Lou. Diggs had a little worry in him. \"Don't worry. Tab and I had a little talk. He punished the agents who attacked me,\" said Diggs. Lou was silent for a few minutes and then responded. \"I'll have a talk with Tab and then call a meeting to tell the agents. Meanwhile, go to your home and get some rest,\" said Lou. Diggs nodded. \"You are dismissed,\" ordered Lou. Diggs turned around and walked out of Lou's office. Diggs was at his house. Shane was doing his cop duties and his wife was taking care of the baby. Diggs got on a couch and laid there. Diggs was thinking of what happened today. Finally, Diggs closed his eyes and went to sleep. So, there it is. I hope you like it. But I got one thing to say. WHY WOULD ANYBODY DO A STORY FOR TAB! He is my third favorite character. Can someone make me happy and make a story of Tab. :([Chapter 5] Sorry, for the long wait. Feel free to PM me with any probelms with the story. Or complentments[I spelled the word wrong]. Anyways, here's the story. Diggs woke up. His sleep was normal. He didn't dream of anything. Then he remembered about the gathering that Lou mentioned. Diggs got up on his four paws. He looked out the window. He noticed that it was dark outside. I probably slept a few hours, thought Diggs. He walked to the kitchen to have a good look at the clock. It was 2:10 AM. I probably need to go to HQ, thought Diggs. Diggs walked to the back of the house and went through the dog flap. A cool air hit Diggs. Smell of streets and people surrounded Diggs. He wondered how he can deal with himself being a leader. Diggs walked through the DOG HQ door that was opened. He was surprised to see all the dogs in the center of DOG HQ. He knew why. Lou called a meeting. Diggs walked down the stairs and went to the center of the clearing. Lou appeared in front of the gathered dogs. The dogs fell silent. \"I have news. Ever since we trusted M.E.O.W.S., they had a secret,\" addressed Lou. There some worried whispering around Diggs. Well, I guess the talk with Tab was long, thought Diggs. \"Diggs, leader of NEST PATROL, was the first to reveal it,\" said Lou. Now, there were more whispers. There were some \"I don't think we should trust him\" and \"Should he really be a leader\". Diggs was thinking about that last whisper. Should he really be a leader? Lou raised his paw for silence. \"Agent Catherine and Agent Mike are assassins,\" said Lou. There were some hostile yowls and growls. Lou raised his paw again. There was silence. \"We should attack them,\" someone yelled. Diggs growled a warning. \"We are not attacking them,\" growled Lou. \"They are our allies. Agent Catherine and Agent Mike are our allies, too\". Diggs turned around, about to leave when Lou dismissed the agents. All the agents scattered and went back to their work. Diggs continued walking to the entrance of DOG HQ. \"Diggs, wait!\" screamed someone. Diggs stopped where he was. He turned his head around and saw Carly. Carly catches up to him. \"Carly, what do you want?\" questioned Diggs. Carly looked down. \"I want to see your agency,\" replied Carly, shyly. Why is Carly shy, thought Diggs. Then a second thought came to Diggs that might have answered his question. Maybe because she thought it was stupid, thought Diggs. \"What about your duties?\" questioned Diggs. Carly looked up. \"I'm taking a day off,\" answered Carly. Diggs wasn't really planning on going to NEST PATROL. But he thought it would be a good idea to stop by to see how the progress is going. \"Alright, you can come\", answered Diggs. Diggs and Carly walked into NEST POTRAL. The door closed behind them as they continued to walk. Carly almost seems nervous. Diggs could even smell it on her. \"Wow, NEST POTRAL is almost like DOG HQ,\" said Carly with satisfaction in her voice. She was right. There were two floors on each side. The right side, on the bottom, had the Lab and Training. On the top was, of course, Diggs' room. On the left side, on the bottom, was the Hospital. On the top was rooms for were dogs and cats can take a break. At the back of the agency were computers where dogs and cats can get reports from agents on the surface and also keep an eye on the surface. In the center, a white dog was gathering some agents for a portal on the surface. Diggs walked to the white dog while Carly followed. The white dog saw his leader coming and he sighed a relief. Diggs stopped in front of him. \"Thank goodness you're here! All the agents were giving me questions about you and the agents had a lot of work to do, I can't even get them on a portal! I… Well, who is this? Was this the 'cute' dog you were talking about? ,\" question the white dog. Diggs growled but he did feel a little embarrassment inside him. Carly chuckled. \"Who are you, exactly?\" questioned Carly, trying to hide her laughter. Diggs sighed. \"Carly, this is Max, my deputy. He is next in line to become leader. He likes to make jokes sometimes but he can be very serious. Max, this is Carly, my friend. She is the top hospital dog in DOG HQ,\" explained Diggs. Max dipped his head in greeting to Carly. \"I want you to tell the portal to keep a good eye out on the surface,\" ordered Diggs. Max looked concerned. \"Why? What happened?\" questioned Max. Diggs took a big sigh. \"M.E.O.W.S. was ambushed by robots. The good news is the agents survived but the bad news is Paws has returned,\" answered Diggs. Max looked surprised. \"Is that so? I'll go tell the agents,\" said Max. Max turned around and walked to the agents that he gathered for the portal. Diggs sighed. \"Hey, Diggs, I'm goanna explore while you do your business,\" said Carly. Carly turned away from Diggs and set out to explore the agency. Diggs now knew what to do. Diggs walked to where the computers were and walked up the stairs. The agents who were on the computers turned around and meet Diggs' eyes. Diggs dipped his head and the agents proceed to their work. Diggs walked to the edge of the stairs. He saw all the agents doing their job, protecting from who they love the most. Diggs felt that he could smile from that thought. Diggs let out a bark and said, \"All dogs and cats please come from the center for a meeting.\" All the dogs and cats stopped their work and went to the center of the agentcy. All of the agents started to talk to each other, wondering what's going on. Diggs lift his paw then all the agents went silent. \"A secret has been revealed from M.E.O.W.S. Agent Catherine and Agent Mike are assassins,\" said Diggs. A few agents were concerned. \"We will do nothing to M.E.O.W.S. As long as we have assassins on our side, we will show the cats who want to slave the humans that we're not weak,\" said Diggs, firmly. All the agents murmured an agreement. \"Today, I went to visit DOG HQ and heard that a couple of agents were ambushed. The agents survived but Paws has returned,\" said Diggs. There were some hostile growls from a few agents. Diggs raised his paw and the agents went silent. \"When you go on a portal, keep an eye out for anything suspicious. Until then maybe we don't have to worry about anything,\" ordered Diggs. Diggs called a dismiss and they scattered. All the agents went back to work. Diggs went to a black dog which was on the computer. \"I want you to scan the surface to see if there might be a trace of Paws or anything like that,\" ordered Diggs. The black dog looked in Diggs' eyes and respond, \"Yes, sir\". Diggs turned away. There were an awful a lot of chatter. Then an orange she-cat came running out of nowhere and went to Diggs. \"Sir, I wish to speak with you. This is urgent,\" said the orange she-cat with a stern tone. Diggs looked at her warily. \"And who are you?\" questioned Diggs. The she-cat looked like she didn't have time for this. \"I'm one of guards at the jail cells,\" said the guard. \"Well, tell me what happened,\" said Diggs. The guard looked around warily. \"Are you sure this is for all ears, sir?\" questioned the guard. Diggs looked around and saw some dogs and cats wondering what's going on. \"Just tell me what happened,\" urged Diggs. The guard looked at Diggs with a cold looked and responded, \"Fine, Kitty Galore has escaped.\" CLIFFHANGER! Sorry, it's short. School is a pain in the butt. I hate projects.

D: ","Summary":" Long ago, when M.E.O.W.S. was made, DOG HQ celebrated because the war was over. M.E.O.W.S. was acce"},{"Movie":"Olympus Has Fallen","Title":"London","Author":"queenpearl","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12731075","Passage":"[Chapter 1] Wilson's death came as a shock to everyone and it hit the president particularly hard. And whatever afflicted him, afflicted Angel. There was no question that she and Asher shared a special relationship, one more unique than that which existed with her previous owners. Perhaps it had to due partly with the fact that they saw each other as equals. Angel was the GOAF and rightfully so while he was the CiC. He could order her to do something and she would follow it without question. But if she told him something relevant, he would listen. Except for this time. \"Sir, I don't like this one bit.\" Angel growled. \"There are 40 world leaders attending this funeral and to have all of you there in one place...\" \"This is a state funeral for our closest ally plus Wilson was a friend of mine. He deserves my presence at the very least.\" Asher replied. They stood just outside Angel's hanger at Andrews Air Force Base as the 747 took on the fuel she needed for the journey. \"If he was such a close friend, I'm sure he'd understand if you chose not to go.\" She said. Asher sighed, rubbing his forehead before turning to his plane. \"Angel, can you find me one good reason why I should not attend?\" He asked. Oh Angel could think of hundreds but not of which were relevant. They were all conjecture, for now at least. Her silence was his answer. \"Thought not. Look, while I'm in the air I have you. When I'm on the ground I have these guys.\" He gestured to the secret service agents that surrounded them both and the unseen snipers adorning the rooftops. \"I couldn't be safer.\" Sighing, she nodded. \"I know that sir it's just, I've got a bad feeling about this.\" \"You always have a bad feeling about foreign trips Angel.\" He chuckled, patting her nose gear. She huffed. \"I'm serious!\" \"And so am I. It'll be fine Angel. Trust me.\" He assured. \"Of course I trust you. It's the others I'm worried about. A last minute trip like this without the proper time to plan... at least let me move our schedule up a bit without announcing. Surprise is always the best defense element.\" She begged. Asher didn't feel that his time of arrival was all that important but when Angel got worried like this, flying always made her ill and he doubted people would appreciate bile tainted jet fuel landing on their rooftops. So, if it made his plane feel a bit better... \"Alright, fine. Plan however you want. Just get me to Stansted, Angel.\" He asked. She nodded. \"Can do sir.\" She replied, her worry subsiding for the time being. Her instincts however, were still telling her to be afraid and she knew better than to ignore them. Asher's decision to give his plane her head a bit worked for just as long as the flight lasted. As soon as they were on the ground, she was right back to her old pestering self again. \"At the very least double your security. Pull some of my detail away, I don't care. You're more of a target than I am and I'm not as defenseless as you are.\" \"I'll ignore the underhanded jab at my innate human frailness if you just shut up!\" Asher groaned as he stepped down the stairs. She huffed and he could see that he'd offended her but he had more pressing issues to deal with. Asher headed towards his car but Angel wasn't quite done yet. \"Sir, if you would please just...\" He rounded on her. \"GOAF, attention!\" He roared and Angel instantly snapped to. He walked up to her nose. She wasn't looking at him, her gaze was fixed on something far out in the distance in the standard \"thousand yard stare\" that was mandatory in the military. \"I've read and reread over every report my security detail has provided me with. There is nothing, nothing! They haven't accounted for.\" \"They can't possibly have...\" She tried. She'd never interrupted the president before which showed just how seriously she felt about this situation. Unfortunately, Asher was too angry to notice. \"Quiet!\" He roared. \"Now I've heard enough from you. We'll continue this discussion about your insubordination later.\" And with that he angrily left in his vehicle. Angel sighed, kicking the tarmac beneath her in frustration. \"You okay Angel?\" Mike asked her. He, like everyone else in earshot, was stunned at what he'd just witnessed. \"It's not like you to question the commander in chief.\" \"Commander Ingalls,\" She sighed, addressing him by rank and she gave him a glare that told him he should do the same. \"In my years of service there is one thing I've learned and that is to trust my instincts.\" \"You think this might be a trap?\" He asked. \"I know it's a trap! It smells like a trap. It feels like a trap! And I've just let our commander in chief walk right into it.\" She growled. \"You tried to warn him. At this point it's his own fault if he gets killed.\" Mike said, trying to keep her from berating herself too much. It worked, just a little bit too well. She rounded on him, teeth bared. \"Our job is to protect the president.\" She growled. \"Now you get your planes fueled up and ready to leave. And contact the Marine flight and have them keep constant areal surveillance over the Cathadral. I'm going to deal with security.\"[Chapter 2] Angel was up on her wheels and rolling the instant she saw the smoke from the first explosion. She didn't need to know where it was, only that she knew the president would be en route and he needed her to get him out of London. Something she couldn't do if she wasn't properly fueled. She didn't bother to wait for the fuel trucks to come out to her, she went to them. \"Two of you hook up to me, now!\" She roared. The driver's scrambled to comply with Angel picking up their trucks and positioning them properly underneath her wings when they weren't fast enough. As they pumped fuel in on both sides, Angel lowered her head, opening the receptacle door on her nose. She needed to get more fuel in faster and this was the only way. It was risky because there was no VTO sensors to stop the tanks from overflowing which could lead to a fuel spill but Angel had bigger problems. She could hear gunfire now and it was getting closer. Never a good sign. \"Come on, come on!\" She grumbled. While attached the fuel trucks she couldn't move and she couldn't deploy her weapons. The risk of hitting the volatile fuel load was too great. She was a sitting duck. She could see Marine One in the distance but the joy was short lived. \"Marine 3 is down!\" reported the lead helicopter. \"Shit!\" Angel muttered. \"What is your status Marine One?\" She asked. \"5 minutes out but taking heavy fire. More incoming!\" Angel watched as the two remaining helicopters popped flares and dived to get out of the way. Thankfully the missiles went for it and Angel recognized just what kind they were. \"Marine One, they've got Stingers. Continue evasive action!\" She ordered. \"Tell me something I don't know, ma'am. Fuck, we need back up and we need it now!\" Angel gave a nod to the lead British fighter plane that had come over. \"The fighters are scrambling now but they won't reach you for another 5 minutes.\" \"We won't be here in 5 minutes ma'am.\" \"I know that! Jesus fuck! How the hell did these bastards pull this off?\" \"No idea. All I know is Marine 2 and I are out of flares and we've got more incoming. Marine 2, prepare for sacrifice.\" Angel could hear the somber tone in both helicopter's voices. \"Copy that. Clear skies partner.\" Marine 2 turned broadside, taking both incoming missiles. It was a quick, noble death. One that Angel seared into her mind. She would see to it he got a Medal of Honor for his actions. Then she saw the next wave of missiles. \"Marine One you've got another missile on your six. You're exposed. Get the fuck out of there!\" \"Believe me, I'm trying! I'm trying!\" He outran it for as long as he could but eventually it closed, striking his tail rotor. \"Fuck, I'm hit! I'm going down. There's a park right below me, I'm gonna try and land there.\" \"Copy Marine One, I've got a lock on your signal. We'll get the president out of there.\" \"Semper Fi ma'am.\" was the reply and the radio went dead. The smoke Angel saw rising up through the trees told her what couldn't be said. \"Someone get me a goddamn drone on station. I need to see what's happening!\" She roared. \"Drone's coming up in a minute ma'am.\" Angel activated her internal screen. It was a few tense moments before the president and Banning finally emerged from the wreckage. \"Thank the Ancients.\" She breathed. \"President's still alive.\" She allowed the cheering to last for only a minute before she barked sternly \"This isn't over. We still need to get him out of this.\" \"I don't think here is the best place for that anymore Angel.\" Mike said, nodding to the swarm of motorcycles currently racing towards them. They matched the ones seen on the drone feed. \"Those goddamn sons of bitches!\" She swore. \"Get airborne the lot of you!\" She cried. She was stunned when no one moved. \"Did you not hear me, get those wheels off the ground, now! That's an order.\" \"Not until you do, ma'am.\" Mike spoke up. \"What?\" She looked at him. \"Pardon me ma'am but you're the president's ride out of here. If you don't get airborne, none of us do.\" She blinked, stunned. \"I still need 5 more minutes before I can taxi out to the runway. Can you buy me that time?\" She asked. \"Oh please,\" One of the fighter jets who's name plate identified him as Ryan, rolled his eyes. \"If you're gonna request something from us, make it a challenge at least. Let's go lads!\" Still attached to the fuel trucks on both wings and through her nose, Angel could do nothing but watch as Mike, his C-130s along with the British fighter planes engaged in combat. She had no doubts they'd buy her the time she needed. Except, they'd buy it in blood.[Chapter 3] Angel had her eyes fixed on the little numbers on the truck's gauges as they went up, telling her exactly how much fuel they'd put into her so far. She figured she'd need a minimum of 25,000 gallons or 168,000 lbs of fuel for the trip home. She preferred to have a little bit extra but that would have to wait if she wanted to get out of here alive. \"Come on, come on!\" She growled. 10,000 galleons, 20,000 gallons, 24,000 galleons. \"That's close enough.\" She growled and closed all her valves, tearing out the hoses from her wings. Fuel sprayed everywhere until the fuelers got the hint and let go of their deadmans. A shot rang out close by, grazing her cheek. Angel reared, dislodging the hose in her muzzle rather violently. It swung out and Angel tasted a bit of blood but she paid it no mind. She pulled back from the terminal, facing the far fence and put full power to her engines. Forget the taxi to the runway, she needed to get airborne now. She used the taxiway. At just over 8000 feet, Taxiway 3 wasn't the longest one but it was the closest to where she was at. Even so, 8000 feet was going to be a challenge for a 747 that currently weighed over 600,000 lbs. She could lift off at around 7500 feet at the weight if she pushed it but there was a series of large trees and light poles at that end of the airport that she needed to clear. She looked behind her and met Mike's gaze as the C-130 turned to her. \"Go! Angel go! Go now!\" He roared. Angel didn't need to be told twice. With full power already on her engines she released the only thing holding her in place, her breaks. She took off down tarmac at speed, swiftly approaching 100 knots. The last 70 knots seemed to take an eternity and Angel didn't bother to call out V1, she passed that a ways back. But with just 500 feet of runway left, she finally hit V2 and lifted off with the grace and style only a Boeing plane could produce. Her tail had hardly cleared the ground when she issued the command for gear up. She hadn't even confirmed a positive rate yet but there was no way she could clear those trees with her wheels still down. The weight of the retracting gear threatened to pitch her nose up and stall her and it took all of her skill to keep her trim tabs aligned and her nose pointed at just the right Angle of Attack. Her four Pratt and Whitney turbines strained to keep 600,000 lbs of aircraft aloft. Her eyes were fixed on her altitude indicator. 10 feet, 20 feet, 40 feet... \"Come on, come on!\" She gritted her teeth, eyeing that approaching wall of doom. This was gonna be close. With no room to spare, Angel swore she felt leaves brush her horizontal stabilizer, the 747 raced skywards for the clouds. She could hear a cheer go up from the aircraft below. Mike and his unit had taken care of the bad guys just as he said they would. Angel wanted to circle back around and see the casualties for herself but she had a job to do. Leveling off at 10,000 feet, out of missile range, she used her radar to scan the ground. She still had the drone, control of which had been given to her from Central Command to control. They would now see what she saw. \"Okay.\" She muttered. \"Let's get a lay of the land.\" She commanded the drone to scan the streets. It could get far more detailed pictures of the ground than she could from this altitude. Her radar was good but only for large objects. Things like humans would barely register if they did at all. Analyzing the incoming data, it didn't take her long to identify a pattern. \"Looks like their command structure is closer to the center of the city.\" She mused. \"Command, give me a sit rep.\" She ordered. \"The man who's behind this is named Barawaki.\" Angel recognized Trumball's voice. \"Barawaki, I should've known.\" Angel silently berated herself. \"He's an arms dealer who operates through shell companies. Can you identify any in this area?\" \"There are 11 known entities he controls in London alone.\" \"Does that include this one?\" Angel directed the drone over a half finished building. She normally would've gone right over it but her instincts were telling her to check it out. \"That is supposedly owned by him but it's not scheduled to be completed for another year. However, it's power output in the last three weeks is double that of the surrounding buildings.\" Trumball said. \"Quite unusual for something that has nothing living or working in it.\" Angel mused. \"This is their command building. It's got to be. I'm keeping the drone on station while I make the call to our friends in parliament. It's time they got their tails in gear and helped us.\" Minutes later, Angle was on the phone with the Prime Minister. \"We've got Delta Force en route. If you can send in the SAS to double the force that would help our chances greatly.\" She said. \"This is asking a lot of us GOAF Boeing.\" Clark replied. \"Our military isn't what it used to be.\" \"Look!\" Angel growled, deciding to drop the courtesies. \"These bastards attacked your capital! They murdered your Prime Minister and they're currently after the only world leader left alive! Now we've been your ally for over a hundred years. We've been at your side for almost every conflict in that time. Return the favor for once!\"[Chapter 4] Having enough of the cloud cover obscuring her view, Angel descended to below 3000 feet. What she saw, filled her with dread. Below her the president was blindfolded, handcuffed and being carried inside the fortress of the half finished building. Banning was nowhere in sight leading Angel to assume him either incapacitated or dead. She fervently hoped the former but she couldn't risk waiting around for him to show up. If she was going to save Asher, she had to act now. One last pass, moving in and out of the clouds and keeping engine thrust low to reduce the chances of being seen or heard and Angel had her lineup. She eyed the large opening at the top of the building that marked the elevator shaft. \"Okay, here goes!\" She raised her nose up high, stalling herself out. For a moment she lay suspended on her back, then she completed her loop, diving nose first at the building. Bullet fire streaked out and Angel leaned more into the dive until she was nearly vertical. The target she presented was irresistible but practically impossible to hit despite the terrorists' continuous trying efforts. With a roar she descended into the shaft. One great thing about half finished buildings was they were full of wide open spaces like the one Angel flew through now. Most elevator shafts were narrow but this one was designed to take multiple lifts at a time making it nice and open, perfect for what she had in mind. The sound of voices made her adjust her course and she flew out the nearest opening, near the bottom of the shaft. She ended up on the second floor, instantly running over the guards in her way. One rolled under her just in time to avoid being squished and Angel rounded on him, ready for a fight. \"Whoa, Angel! Friendly!\" He called. She stood down. \"Banning you 9 lived son of a bitch! I was hoping you'd show up.\" She said. He pat the side of her nose, taking notice of her damaged refueling nozzle. \"Angel,\" He began. \"I know. But I had to get off the field fast. Unfortunately the bad guys decided to crash the party.\" She said. \"Now where's the president?\" \"I heard he was on this floor. Sick assholes are going to execute him on live TV.\" \"You don't say, I've got a feed coming in now.\" Despite her better judgement, she opened the file. Sure enough, there was Asher with a sword to his neck. Angel's breath hitched. She opened the door so Banning could climb inside her cockpit and watch as well. \"Those...\" Angel tuned out the rest of his sentence although she was in complete agreement with it. \"I do solemnly swear...\" Asher's voice was steady and his gaze held no hint of fear despite his impending death. Angel started moving. \"That I will faithfully execute the office of the President...\" Angel hissed as he received a punch but he got right back up and continued. \"of the United States.\" Clearly his killer had heard enough and readied his blade. Asher stood there, calm as a cucumber. The killer brushed the blade along the back of his neck, not noticing the 747 sneaking up behind him. A low growl was the only warning he got before Angel lunged, throwing him into the wall. His partner got his grenade ready, lobbying it across the room to her. She ducked, covering Asher with her bulk. The explosion rocked her but she held firm. Turning her gaze to the still green camera light she said \"The United States has never and will never negotiate with terrorists!\" She growled and smashed the camera, ending the video. Unknown to her, a massive cheer rose up throughout the world as people praised \"the President's Angel\"!

But that makes for a lot of action, so I think it works. It's been a long time since I've written for this site, but I hope you enjoy. Focus is on Ben Asher but Mike will feature too. -0-0-0-0- After the taking of the White House, and the fall of London, Benjamin Asher was certain of one thing: he couldn't rely on perfect timing or Mike Banning forever. At some point, his luck would run out. In the shadows when no one was looking, the façade of the perfectly in control Commander-in-Chief was gone. He woke up more often than not, sweating and heart racing as he felt the blade of that crude sword against his skin. He could hear the swoosh of it cutting through the air in that London building. His torso still bore the scar from when Kang shot him in Washington, and now he couldn't even watch an action movie with Connor without the sounds of gunfire jolting him. Logically, he was justified to have these flashbacks. The memories would tear anyone apart. But he wasn't just anyone. And he didn't want those terrorists having such a lasting impact on him. He knew he was kidding himself to think they didn't leave psychological scars. Having Mike around helped, but he knew it was just a matter of time before the man retired. Mike was just as close to death each time, and he knew with a child and his wife, he couldn't expect him to keep laying his life on the line. Even if Mike would do it anyway…. It was four months ago when he realized something had to change. The fireworks from the 4th of July celebration had been expected, but somewhere in the long presentation of beautiful colors and loud explosions, he'd blacked out. Only Connor and two Secret Service agents noticed, but he came to quickly enough to call off any overt reaction from them. If he was honest with himself, he knew the sound had triggered the memory of flying debris scraping against his skin as that warehouse in London exploded. This all didn't include how clammy his hands got every time he boarded the Marine One helicopter. So enough was enough. He swore the nighttime Service agents to secrecy, as much as they could obscure or normalize his movements. He didn't want Mike to know, or else the man would never feel like he could retire. Ben started training. The Secret Service had excellent self-defense and hand-to-hand combat trainers. For an hour each night, he was in his private gym at the White House, spending more times with his face pressed to the floor mats than he'd care to admit. But he learned. Once a week, he varied it up by going to the Secret Service's shooting range. Handling guns, caring for them, shooting, learning what affected his aim, where the best places to hit were and how they would affect an enemy…. These were the lessons he learned. In hindsight, training can only prepare you for so much. Ben knew that after his limousine vaulted in the air on impact from an RPG. -0-0-0-0- It was supposed to be a goodwill tour of Russia. Diplomatic relations with the country were strained. Four days in the country were supposed to be spent in negotiations, meetings, a gala, and visiting several beauties of the country. Ben had endured little movement in the trade negotiations as well as peaceful solutions to problems in the area. The gala had been boring but Ben put on his best performance of civility. People flocked to him, which made his Secret Service detail nervous—even if everyone had been screened. Ben shook hands like a good world leader, laughed at jokes that were meant as veiled insults and threats, and managed to leave the gala ahead of schedule. As he lay in bed that night, in the most secure suite available in the country at a hotel with bullet-proof glass, Benjamin tried a simple exercise of counting down from 549. It was the number of days left as President. It calmed him. When he first started this nightly routine, the number of days lasted longer than his wakefulness. Not now. Ben couldn't shake the feeling he wouldn't survive his presidency. Day 3 of the Russia trip included a convoy to a decommissioned nuclear test site; always a hot topic of conversation, and apparently an example of what more progress could be made in countries with similar nuclear powers. The Russian-equivalent of the Secretary of State accompanied him for the day's trip. \"I think you will find the site eye-opening,\" the statesman said. Ben couldn't remember his name at the moment. \"I'm sure,\" Ben said. His eyes focused on the green trees whipping by the limousine. The car, along with the armed escort ahead of it and behind it, sped through the countryside. Ben couldn't remember how long it'd been since they'd seen a house or business. Isolation was a good rule of thumb for nuclear sites, active or not. His Secret Service driver, Costas, and Agent Wilmington, sitting next to him, didn't see the RPGs coming until it was too late. Ben saw multiple streaks of light and smoke coming at the convoy. He had just enough time to yell out \"RPG!\" before one hit the limo. The limo vaulted off the ground, the entire vehicle shuddering from the impact. Screams filled the vehicle but Ben didn't remember making a sound. He grasped the seat belt with his hands, anchoring himself better as the car flipped upside down. Ben felt the jolt of the car's roof hitting the ground. It rattled his bones, and pain flooded his body. He could already smell smoke, but he registered that the car hadn't stopped moving. It was skidding on its roof. Suddenly something slammed into the limo from behind. Instinctively he knew it was one of the escort vehicles. The sound of another explosion reached his ears, maybe even a third if he thought about it enough, but without seeing exactly what was going on, the noise blurred everything. Gunfire was next. Ben blinked rapidly, trying to clear his vision. The Russian statesman, Wilmington and Costas weren't moving. He heard bullets hit the car. His hand reached for the seat beat buckle. He pushed at it until he fell free. Ben looked out the cracked window. He could see ahead on the road, where multiple SUVs were approaching. The gunfire flashed from those SUVs. They're attacking. You have to move for cover. Behind him, more SUVs approached. Another explosion finished off one of the president's many escort vehicles. None seemed unharmed. Ben swallowed dryly. Normally he would hear lots of shouting by now, someone frantically pulling him from the car or rushing to \"secure\" the President. No one was doing that this time. No one is able . And Mike hadn't come on this trip, for once staying back home for a family-related reason that escaped Ben at the moment. Ben took three breaths, his mind racing during that time. The road was off limits. He'd die or be captured there. But the forest was clear enough. The attack was coming from the SUVs. They could only go so far in the forest. Ben crawled to Wilmington. The unnatural angle of his neck told Ben Wilmington wasn't with him anymore. Ben searched the man's jacket until he found his holstered gun and two extra clips of ammo on his belt. He continued searching for a phone, but suddenly a bullet found its way right through the limo's interior. It slammed into the seat next to Ben. He yelled out and recoiled; he couldn't help it. Shouts from outside the vehicle called his attention. They weren't in English. And they didn't sound scared either. Ben pocketed the two clips of ammunition. \"They're coming,\" Ben said aloud. It grounded him into action. The back of the limo was facing the forest treeline. The back window was cracked, but not completely broken. He kicked it; even cracked, it held fast. He tried again, three times, four—it wavered but held. Ben aimed Wilmington's gun at the back window. With a quick flip of the safety, he followed with a shaky squeeze of the trigger. The sound hurt his ears, but the bullet weakened the glass. It partly gave way. Ben kicked it twice more, and the glass fell away as a semi-intact panel from the limo. Ben grabbed his wool dress coat that had been set aside in the limo. He crawled through the back window. He kept the gun tightly in hand. Once free of the vehicle, he risked a look around from the cover the limo provided. His detail was decimated. Only a few men made it out of the escort vehicles, but they were motionless on the ground. The Russian security was killed as well. He heard the SUVs screech to a stop. Whoever the attackers were, they were here, ready to claim their prize. Ben shut out all thoughts other than RUN! He kept low to the ground and hurried towards the forest. He knew he had to put distance between himself and the attackers, and not stop. He braced himself for a bullet to gun him down. But he made it to the treeline unharmed. He risked looking back from behind the cover of the trees. What he saw made him realize this was another attack that he was unlikely to survive. Twelve men, maybe fifteen even, spread out over the fiery scene. They were heavily armed, and each wore black tactical gear and coats. Where there were bodies of their victims, the attackers shot them in the head. Ben felt sick. There was no chance of survivors. They converged on the limo, their chatter and shouts growing louder. Ben turned away and moved deeper in the forest. They knew he wasn't there. He had gotten away. Now the chase began.[Chapter 2] a/n: I know this isn't a hugely followed movie fandom, but hopefully there's more interest in this story to come. Reviews are greatly appreciated! Chapter 2 -0-0-0-0- The coat was a little excessive at the moment as Ben ran through the forest, but he needed his hands free. Spring was coming soon; the air was cool enough to hint at winter, but it wouldn't be many weeks before it warmed up. Ben worried about the night though. He didn't hold any delusions that he would be to safety by night fall. Shouts were coming from his path behind him. They were far enough away that Ben knew he wasn't going to be seen yet, so long as he stayed ahead. And that meant moving. Each step jostled the aches and bruises he had. He had allowed himself fifteen seconds to look over himself to ensure he wasn't bleeding, other than a cut to his temple where he'd hit it in the explosion. That was no big deal. But the bruises were starting to bother him more. The adrenaline was wearing off. The forest's trees were tall. They blocked out the light so much that Ben had to check what time it was. Nearing 2 pm, local time, he saw as he checked his watch. But the sunlight was hard-pressed to break through the branches. Ben's foot caught on a tree root, and he pitched forward. The gun fell from his hand as he tried to brace his fall. He cried out as his body hit the ground, including some rocks. Ben heaved on the ground, trying to catch his breath. He rotated his ankle—tender, but it was fine otherwise. He started to roll to his side but the movement created a flare of agony. His hand went to the spot on his ribcage, above his left hip. The pressure resulted in a stinging pain as well. He snaked his hand under his coat and suit jacket. His fingertips felt something warm and slick—his own blood. The rocks had gashed his side. \"Get up,\" he whispered to himself. He bit down on his tongue as he forced himself to his knees. His eyes searched the ground for the gun. \" This way !\" someone shouted. It was far too close for Ben's liking, so much so that he almost didn't register that it was Russian the person spoke. He'd been taking up basics in the language lately. Frantically, he ran his fingers over the leaf-covered ground, feeling for the gun. \"Come on, come on!\" he hissed to himself. He risked a look in the direction of the shouts, and saw a flash of movement. Just then his hand hit the solid grip of the gun. Ben grabbed it, forced himself to his feet, and took off. He angled sharply to the left, hoping the sudden shift in direction would throw off his pursuers. -0-0-0- Mike Banning sat by the hospital bed of his daughter. Her breathing was improving now after a cough turned to RSV, but the lack of control in the situation made Mike crazy. Leah hid it well, perhaps because her nursing background let her know this was potentially serious, but they had caught it in time and were treating the illness. How she could be calm while he was playing the part of the paranoid parent…. His phone rang. He frowned at the caller ID. It was the director of the Secret Service. Mike stepped out into the hallway. \"Director Clemmens,\" he greeted. \"Agent Banning. There's been an attack on the President's convoy in Russia.\" Leah assured him their daughter Lynne would be well taken care of, especially considering Mike was just going into town. Leah kissed him. Mike gently touched Lynne's face as she slept. He hurried out of the hospital, fearing for Ben Asher and feeling guilty for not being with him at this moment. -0-0-0- Okhotnik . That's what they called him. It meant \"Hunter,\" more a title but it had grown from his purpose to encompass his character. Hunter was fine with that. His prey was running more efficiently than he expected, although he suspected he was wounded to some degree, based on the tracks through the forest. He expected the American President to be panicked, sloppy. There were no survivors of his or the Russian security team, so the man was alone. Hunter stood and gestured to the north. Quietly—he finally got the team to stop shouting stupidly and giving away their position—the men dispersed in that direction. But he did not follow. Where are you going, Asher? Did the American even know? No. He was confident in that. So where would he think it wise to go? \"He doesn't know the land,\" Hunter whispered aloud. \"He doesn't know what is safe and what is not.\" Hunter pulled up a map on his GPS. He zoomed in the area, searched for possibilities…. Where would he go? Hunter smiled thoughtfully at a few options. -0-0-0- Mike stared at the satellite image that was displayed on the wall before him and many people well above his pay grade. The entire convoy … all dead. Except one. \"How do we know they – whoever they are – don't have the President?\" someone said. \"Because we'd know by now,\" Vice President Trumbull said as he entered the room. Everyone stood out of respect. He noticed Mike and nodded in his direction. Mike had never felt so out of place in his life. He shouldn't be here, in this room, hearing what was going on through outdated information. He should be on the ground, the last line of defense for the President. \"How soon until we get a drone in the sky?\" Trumbull asked. \"Russia is pushing back about drones in their airspace—\" \"I don't care,\" Trumbull interrupted. \"We don't know if they're involved or not; if there's a rebel element in their government or not. Our priority now is our Commander-in-Chief.\" Mike appreciated the man's take-charge attitude. His eyes went to the screen. \"Agent Banning,\" he heard by him. Mike snapped his attention to Trumbull. \"Mr. Vice President,\" he responded. \"Your analysis?\" Mike looked back to the display on the wall. \"Can we zoom out and see what's around the area?\" he asked. Trumbull nodded to a 3-star general, who snapped his fingers at an aide. Within moments, the image zoomed out and showed a satellite image of the area on a wider scale. Mike's eyes took in every detail he could. To the east was the nuclear site; the south was a city, but the road to it and the towns to the west were blocked by the carnage and the enemy's attack. \"The forest—that's where he is.\" \"If he's alive,\" a general commented. Mike smirked. \"He's alive.\" Without any judgment, Trumbull asked, \"How do you know?\" Banning smiled and pointed to the intact vehicles boxing the convoy in. \"Because their vehicles are still there.\" The smile dropped. \"They're looking for him on foot.\" Trumbull frowned. \"Any idea of his odds against the attackers?\" Mike thought about the will to survive he'd seen from the President firsthand; the extra mile or ten he'd go; the man's sense of honor and duty…. Agent Danforth, on the President's normal routine night detail, came to Banning's side. Mike could see he had something to say, but he waited. \"Just a moment, sir,\" Mike said to Trumbull. Mike followed Danforth to the hallway outside the secure briefing room. \"What is it, Danforth?\" \"You should know what the President has been up to lately. It might help anticipate his movements,\" Danforth said. \"And improve his odds.\" -0-0-0-0- The sky was overcast. Rain started to fall, but it was filtered through the trees and fell in lighter spats. Ben shook his coat, sending a spray off him. His hand was pressed against his side as he walked. Walked. Occasionally it was a half-jog. The longer he went without hearing the men chasing him, the more nervous he got. His bizarre life-and-death experiences taught him that. Quiet didn't equal safe. Noise didn't equal safe either. Nothing was safe. Maybe he was cursed. What other president went through this, this many times?! Had he cheated death that first time? Was his time more than up, and some cosmic scale was trying to rebalance? Death was inevitable; maybe fudging the timing wasn't allowed. Ben's fingers regripped the handle of the gun. His hand was achy—he was gripping it too hard, but he feared losing his hold on the weapon. Something whistled through the air. It was quiet enough, but Ben froze. He knew that sound, but what— A bullet sank into a tree near Ben. Silenced gunfire whistled through the air. Ben ran. The bullets hit around him, to his left, and also behind him. Ben cut to the right. The bullets followed, chasing him, driving him— They're not trying to kill me yet, he thought. Where are they trying to get me to go? Suddenly he had his answer. Four men came out from behind cover of rocks and trees, in his path. Ben skid to a stop. Shoot! The word came to mind as naturally as the voice of his Secret Service instructor who'd taught him once a week what to do when a target presented itself. Target . That's all they were…. Almost as soon as his body stopped moving forward, Ben's right arm came up, the gun aimed at the first of the four men. Ben squeezed the trigger twice. Chest first. Though the Secret Service would aim to kill, Ben's trainer taught him to just get the target down. Head shots would take too long to master. For now, it was more important to eliminate the immediate threat. Two more shots, and the four men before him were suddenly just two. Ben saw the two left standing fire at him. Ben went to his knees. His left hand came up to support his right, and he fired twice more—one shot per man this time. He couldn't risk getting shot. He blinked. The four men were down. He couldn't marvel for too long at the fruits of his training. He granted a half second to smirk, pushed away the knowledge he had killed them, and turned for cover behind a tree. Pursuing him were six men—no, eight. They were concealed and leap-frogging from cover to cover. Ben thought about his ammunition. Six shots. That left six bullets in his current clip, and he had two more clips of 12 each, so 30 bullets left. From this distance and with the cover they had, Ben wasn't delusional enough to think he could push his chances. He had to run again. His side was throbbing. Adrenaline was doing nothing to help mask it anymore. Ben figured he just might be out of adrenaline for the rest of the week anyway. The bullets being fired from the men behind him stopped, but he could hear the rustle of damp leaves as booted feet pursued him. Each time he glanced over his shoulder, they were getting closer. Ben needed a miracle. It came disguised as the ground suddenly ended before him. His path came to a modest cliff's edge, overlooking the forested valley below. Ben dug his heels in, trying to stop. The slippery leaves foiled his efforts. Ben fell over the edge.[Chapter 3] Chapter Three a/n: Thank you for the reviews—if you enjoy this, please send a nod as it is very encouraging. Thank you for reading! -0-0-0-0- Mike paced as the drone circled the forest. Diplomatic relations be damned, the Vice President ordered the drone in place. They hadn't found President Asher yet. But they did find the attackers. And as he suspected, they were searching the woods for someone. The tension in the room was palpable as they watched the drone's viewpoint. Flying ahead in the direction the men were pursuing, the drone on infrared picked up one heat signature. Someone in the room stupidly announced it was the President, about twenty seconds after everyone else already knew that. Mike let it go, focusing on the pace of the heat signature. He's moving too slow. His mind reeled at what Agent Danworth told him. Why had President Asher kept his training a secret? Why was Mike kept out of the loop? Those were questions for another moment. \"Trouble,\" he whispered. Trumbull glanced at him before seeing what he saw. Four heat signatures were ahead of Asher. \"Ambush?\" Trumbull asked. Mike gave a single nod. He swiped a hand over his face. What he wouldn't give to be there now, to get Ben out of this and take down the latest of psychotic attackers. \"Is the drone weaponized?\" Mike asked. Trumbull shook his head. The priority had been the nearest drone to get eyes on—and a weaponized drone really could cause a diplomatic nightmare, though Mike was trying hard not to belittle those details. Russian military units were supposedly en route to the forest, but their ETA wasn't going to help President Asher anytime soon. The room went silent as the inevitable happened. Some aide had the drone zoom in more clearly and switch back to live video without infrared; the trees were not as thick where the President was. Mike wasn't sure if he could watch everything play out in real-time. Until President Asher shot the ambushers. There were a few gasps of amazement but Mike just stared. The ambushers didn't get up. And the President—whom they could see more clearly now was indeed the President—kept moving. His pace was labored. And when the President suddenly came to a dropoff, Mike nearly lurched forward as if to catch him. Every person in the room stared at the President's figure as it fell, bumped, hit and slid down the drop-off until it came to a stop. The President didn't move. Trumbull barked at the room. \"Send his location to the rescue force now! \" -0-0-0-0- Ben heard the thud when he landed. His mind took him back to London, the huge gas explosion from the building he'd been taken to. Ben didn't remember jumping into that elevator shaft. He was fairly certain Mike pushed him that direction, and then gravity did the rest. The falling…. Falling, falling. London bridges falling down…. Olympus fell…. Ben's eyes were tightly shut, and he was vaguely cognizant of his memories of then and his fears resurfacing. He squeezed his eyes close harder, willing the memories to go away. Open your eyes. With a gasp that tried to compensate for the air being knocked out of him, Ben opened his eyes and came back to the current nightmare he was living. Nerves flashed the awareness throughout his body that he was injured and in pain. Ben moved one leg, then the other. He rolled to his side. His limbs screamed to just rest, but he could move, and that's what mattered. His hands were empty though. \"No…\" The whispered word came out from his lips. He patted around him and checked his pockets, but his gun was gone. That got him to move. The cliff that he'd fallen from was high enough that the gun could be well out of reach. Ben had no idea how long he was out after his fall. He suspected not too long, but he didn't have time to find the gun, even if the cliff would slow down his pursuers. Ben glanced around quickly in case he could spot it in a last-ditch effort, but it was gone, hidden among the leaves, in crevices of rocks, or who knew where else. He turned ahead. Forest encompassed every view. His sense of direction was off, but that didn't matter so long as he didn't go backwards towards the attackers. He moved ahead and towards the left. Whether that was west, south, north, or east, he did not know. Above him on the cliff's edge, Hunter watched. He knew exactly what lay ahead of the American President's path. It gave him a few options…. He could just end it right now and shoot the man, but he'd been instructed to capture him if possible. Injury was completely acceptable, death if no other alternative, but Hunter felt the capture was feasible. Plus, he enjoyed the pursuit. -0-0-0-0- \"He can't trust the Russians,\" Mike said. \"We don't know if they are complacent in this attack or not,\" a general said. \"That's not what I meant,\" Mike said. Trumbull nodded for him to continue. \"The President will assume he can't trust the Russians. He's operating on less intel than we have, but he knows he was attacked, inside the country, on a route and itinerary that was supposed to be under wraps. Even if the Russian military team reaches him…\" \"The President will fight against them,\" Trumbull filled in. Mike nodded. \"Or hide from them.\" Director Clemmens sat forward in his chair around the table. \"He knows the agents who stayed back at the airport and the hotel. If they're with a rescue, the President would trust them.\" \"Yes,\" Mike agreed. \"Assuming we can trust the rescue they're with.\" Trumbull looked to the Secretaries of State and Defense. \"We're working on that.\" An aide came in and whispered to the general. Mike watched the general's reaction. It wasn't good. The general cleared his throat. \"Mr. Vice President, a storm is moving into the forest,\" he said. Mike looked quickly to the drone feed. It was getting shaky, and the transmission was getting noisier. \"The drone is experiencing some malfunction because of it.\" \"What are you saying?\" Trumbull demanded. Mike stared at Ben's blip on the screen. They'd switched back to the infrared since the tree canopy was thicker now. The blip disappeared just then. \"We're losing visual on the President. Just until we get another drone in place.\" \"Satellites?\" Trumbull asked. The general shook his head. \"The storm is making it difficult to see clearly.\" The screen suddenly went blank. Mike's stomach dropped. -0-0-0-0- Ben didn't try to run anymore. He was doing well to be walking. He was weak and the rain was falling heavily now. Flashes of lightning did nothing to help his nerves. It was dark, and some part of him wondered if the lightning would help illuminate where he was to his pursuers. He hadn't heard them much since his fall, but he knew that didn't mean they weren't on his trail. He kept trying to analyze his situation, to hone in on whatever threads of information he had, like knowing at least some of the attackers were Russian. But that's as far as he got from remembering their shouts he heard in the forest. His focus disintegrated into a circuitous spiral of doubt and fear. He kept thinking about what he could do right now; sadly, his training sessions with the Secret Service agents didn't include anything on bare essentials survival in a forest. He had his trainers focus on self-defense, hand-to-hand fighting and guns. The knowledge that he was out of his depth now screamed in his mind. His body shook. His coat was heavy, the wool weighed down by the rain. He was drenched. His legs shook too, and Ben caught his balance by grabbing at a tree trunk. He looked up at the sky, watching the drops come down at him like tiny bombs. Connor , he thought. He seized on that wonderful thought. He didn't want to think about his son worrying, but that was an inevitable by-product. Again, Ben's focus went to the past…. When he came back from London, Connor had been waiting at the White House. Till 3 in the morning, his son had told him the awful experience from his point of view. Being surrounded by agents and a few friends who were there to be supportive…. Being told he shouldn't watch the video feed but being unable not to. Fearing that his dad would die in front of the whole world…. Ben told Connor he shouldn't have watched, but then Connor admitted he didn't want to miss it if Ben said goodbye to him. A bright flash of lightning jolted Ben from his memories. The following clap of thunder made him jump too. Cold, wet, sore and still bleeding from the gash in his side, Ben was afraid of three things. First, that he wouldn't see Connor again. Second, that he wouldn't survive the odds against him. Third, that he didn't have the courage to keep trying. Tears leaked from his eyes. All it would take is to let his knees buckle. If he hit the soaked ground right now, he wouldn't get up for some time. His legs shook harder. Ben wiped a numb hand over his wet face. He blinked away the moisture and his vision cleared briefly. He stilled. There was a light ahead. Was it? Ben stared ahead at the source. The light was small, fairly distant still. But there was a shadow by it, a large, dark shape against the light. A cabin of some sort. Shelter! Ben found a flood of hope rush through him. He steeled his legs and pushed himself away from the tree trunk that had supported him. He could make it to whatever he was seeing. He could. He had to. -0-0-0-0- Anatoly tried to hide his fidgeting. His gear was all ready. This would be his first mission in the Russian army that might see action. He could feel the tension around him; though his superiors wouldn't admit it, they were nervous. Some whispered that they feared the Americans' response to losing the American President on Russian soil. Already too many hours had passed without deploying a search. He wondered what was causing the delay. He felt honored though, at 19 years old, to be included on such an important mission. They would search for President Asher, find him, and bring him to safety. He followed his team to a large truck and climbed in the back with the other soldiers. The truck revved to life and pulled out. -0-0-0-0- It was a modest cabin, and that even might be exaggerating, but to Ben it looked like paradise. All he wanted to do was knock on the door and go inside out of the rain and cold. He knew better than that. He was too vulnerable physically at the moment to let his guard down. He watched from behind a tarp-covered pile of firewood. Suddenly the door to the cabin opened, and out stepped a woman. Ben shrunk back out of sight. His heart hammered in his chest. He strained to listen for anything. Footsteps came closer to him. Were they? The rain was messing with his senses. But then he heard the crunch of ground under her feet. Ben tensed. The tarp with the wood was peeled back, flinging water onto Ben. He shrank away before he could stop himself, and the woman gasped as she saw his movement. Ben flinched away. So did she. She scurried away from him quickly, until her back was up against the cabin and started yelling at him in Russian. \"No, no, wait!\" Ben cried out as loud as he dare. \"Please!\" He held his hands out for her to see, hoping to calm her down. The woman quieted, but her eyes were wide with fear. \"I won't hurt you,\" he said. He stood slowly, bracing his hands on the wood pile to help himself to his feet. His legs buckled, but he caught himself from falling with a gasp. The woman eyed him warily. \"Do you have a phone?\" he asked. \"Phone?\" He brought his hand to his ear, mimicking a phone. The woman shook her head. Ben tried not to let his disappointment show. He was unsure of what was next. He didn't want to frighten her, but he needed help. His appearance couldn't be helping her fears of him. He wondered if she spoke English, or if she recognized him—which he doubted. She seemed simple, and living out here had to reflect a limited exposure to the world. She pointed at him. Ben frowned as she kept pointing and saying a word he didn't understand. Her eyes were on his side. Ben looked down. His coat and suit jacket underneath were open and showed a bloody pink stain over his dress shirt. She sees I'm injured, Ben thought. He nodded to her. Hesitantly, she stepped towards him. She held out her hand to him, waving her fingers in a \"follow me\" motion. She went to the cabin and waited for him. Ben swallowed. He could cry if he didn't think it would startle her more. He had little pride left at the moment, but he followed her into the cabin. She kept her distance from him as he stepped inside, until she saw the puddle his coat was leaving on the floor. She gestured to it, and Ben tried to shed it, but the weight of the coat and his injuries had him struggling. The woman came closer and tentatively gripped the coat. Ben nearly stilled, a bit unsure of her proximity and risking scaring her, but she pulled it from him. The difference in weight was tremendous. Ben felt forty pounds lighter. He also felt colder, if that were possible. His eyes flickered to a fireplace where small flames danced over well-charred wood. It was the most beautiful thing Ben had seen all day. The woman left with his coat and disappeared into what looked like the only other room of the cabin. Ben pulled back his suit jacket to get a better view of his side. The once-white dress shirt was torn. The bleeding was minimal now, he thought, though he could see the blood had gone down to his hip and soaked into his suit pants. He flinched when a towel came into view beneath his gaze. The woman had come back in so quietly. She held out the towel for him, gesturing to his hair. He took it from her, looking her over in the dim light of a lamp. She was dressed in a rain jacket, a flannel shirt and thick pants that resembled some sort of canvas material. Her hair was light brown, her skin bearing just a few wrinkles that made him guess she was in her 30s. Her eyes were a warm brown as well. \"Thank you,\" he said quietly. Ben gingerly ran the towel through his sopping hair. He glanced at the floor around him. It was quite wet. \"Sorry,\" he mumbled, gesturing to the floor. She nodded at his side. \"Hurt,\" she said simply. Ben was surprised at the English word but he acknowledged her observation with a nod. She reached for him, grasping at his suit jacket. She circled him to free it from his shoulders. Ben held still but let her take the jacket. She set it aside on a chair by a small table. Ben shivered. She frowned as she saw this. He looked away from her, not liking being so helpless in front of a witness. He draped the towel around him like a blanket, groaning slightly as the pull his movements created in his side and overall bruised body. The woman shook her head at him. \"What?\" he asked. She pointed to his shirt, then to a button on her own shirt, followed by pointing again at his own. She motioned like he should take off the mangled shirt. Slowly, he worked his numb fingers to pull away his tie completely and start at the button at his neck. He kept his eyes down as he unbuttoned it. If not for his horrendous day, the moment would seem entirely too intimate. She left the room again, and Ben unbuttoned the rest of his shirt. He pulled it off his left arm easily enough but struggled with the right arm. The woman came back with a cloth and a small tin box. She set it on the table and gestured for him to come closer. Ben obeyed. She took the dress shirt by the right sleeve and worked it off his arm. He was left in an undershirt and his suit pants. She took him by the hand and led him to the fire. Ben's legs felt rubbery with each step. He couldn't ever remember feeling so weary before. Ben gingerly knelt down to be closer to the fire. The woman picked up the tin box from the table and opened it up. Ben saw a few meager first aid supplies. She knelt by him, and after hesitating a moment, she lifted up the undershirt from his side, raising it to his chest. Ben tried to hold still as she gently felt around the edges of the wound. Ben shut his eyes, trying not to groan aloud. She dabbed at it with the cloth. Ben felt her fingertips over his skin, and his tired mind jumped to the memory of his wife. Maggie's beautiful, kind face, smiling at him… Since her death, he hadn't even considered loving anyone else. It was entirely too complicated in Washington anyway. But the ministering touches of this stranger had Ben wanting some closeness. He missed it. He bit his lip as the woman wrapped his wound with some gauze, the pressure driving shards of pain through him. Ben drove his prior thoughts from his mind. \"What's your name?\" he asked. He couldn't think of the words in his limited Russian. She looked up to him. He tapped his chest and said, \"Ben. I'm Ben.\" He pointed to her. Understanding dawned in her eyes. \"Yula.\" Ben smiled softly. \"Thank you, Yula.\" She finished bandaging his side and pulled his undershirt down over it. Yula gestured to the fire. Ben sat back closer to it. He closed his eyes at the warmth, letting it wash over him. His remaining clothes were still wet but this was the closest to comfortable he'd felt since the attack. Yula put a tea kettle on the stove. It honestly looked like a wood-burning stove. Ben marveled at that briefly. He watched as she picked up a blanket and brought it to him. He reached for it, but Yula opened it and laid it over his shoulders. He felt her hands rest against his shoulders for a moment. Ben shifted his body closer to the wall by the fireplace, leaning back. His eyes grew heavier as he watched Yula ready a cup of something. He vaguely was aware that he was hungry, but he was more exhausted. His eyes slipped shut. He felt a cool hand against his cheek. That's the last thing he remembered before falling asleep. -0-0-0-0- \"President Asher, you must be aware of the speculation about you,\" Cynthia Halstrom, news personality and anchor extraordinare, asked him during a post-London primetime special. \"With not just one but two attacks on you, being held hostage twice, even assumed dead and nearly executed….\" Ben still remembered the desire he had to kick her as she paused dramatically. He hated these interviews, but politically, he needed to reassure everyone—politicians, citizens, world leaders—that he was fine and a fully-functioning Commander in Chief again. \"…Well, how do you cope?\" Ben had done all he could to stay seated with an appropriate, reassuring smile on his face. \"There are always risks,\" he had said that day. \"And I'm not unsettled about any danger because I'm working for something greater: this country.\" \"But you still have quite a bit of time left in office,\" Cynthia said. Ben clenched his jaw but then tried to relax it. The camera would pick up on those clues. He tried to remain as impassive as he could. \"Aren't you afraid it could happen again?\" He had smiled and said he and the country were stronger than ever and he knew no matter what, the country, its freedom and democracy would continue on. The interview concluded not too much longer, but he had felt the bile churning in his gut. As soon as he was clear of the interview room, Ben had stopped by the nearest bathroom and lost everything in his stomach. Was he afraid it could happen again? Of course he was! And after two impossible scenarios that no one actually thought would ever happen, he had seen how vulnerable he was. He startled himself awake. Instantly he remember his predicament, but for now, seeing the cabin around him and sensing the comforting presence of Yula, he calmed down. Yula smiled at him. Ben's head ached. He blinked, trying to clear his mind. He looked to the window of the cabin. It was still dark outside. Yula gestured to his side, where a mug of tea waited. \"Thanks,\" he said. He took it and carefully sipped at it. It wasn't very hot anymore but warm enough. He remembered Yula making the tea, so he couldn't have been asleep for long. He didn't want to, but Ben knew he had to think about what to do next. The cabin was an obvious choice to search if his pursuers caught up with him. He had to get to Moscow, back to what was left of his detail and out of this country. A phone would certainly help but he struck out here. One thing at a time, he thought to himself. \"Do you have a car?\" he asked Yula. He mimed holding onto a steering wheel. Yula shook her head. For her benefit, he hid his frustration. \"Is there anyone close by who has a phone or car?\" he asked. Yula frowned. She didn't understand him. \"It's okay,\" he said. He had to move again then. The problem was he didn't trust his body to last, not without more rest at the least. Ben sipped the tea and let it soothe his throat. He finished the mug quickly. Ben started to stand. His torso ached, and glancing at his arms, Ben saw a variety of bruises from the day's falls. His legs felt slightly stronger but they ached as well. He tried to ignore his feet all together; dress shoes were horrible for a normal day, but running over uneven ground? Disaster. Yula frowned at him but didn't interfere when he stood. He checked out the window. Everything was dark outside still, the only light coming from her little cabin. The rain had stopped. Ben turned to Yula with a smile. \"My coat?\" He reached for his suit jacket and held it up as an example. Yula frowned and shook her head. Ben gingerly put on his suit jacket, but Yula stopped him, pulling it from him. She shook her head again. \"I need to go,\" he said. She frowned again. She reached out and touched his undershirt. He felt the cool press of the fabric against his skin. He assumed she was pointing out he was still damp. She gestured to the room. Ben wasn't sure what she meant. Yula grabbed his hand and led him to the room. It held a simple bed and a shabby dresser. She pointed to the bed and pushed him towards it while she opened a drawer from the dresser. The back of Ben's legs hit the edge of the bed, and he stumbled. The room was tiny; he ended up letting himself sit on the bed rather than fall off balance completely. Yula pulled out a gray long-sleeved knit shirt and handed it to him. She turned her back on him, as if to give him some privacy. Ben rubbed the dry fabric between his fingers before setting it aside and removing his undershirt. He groaned sharply when he tried to raise his arms. He recoiled. Yula turned to face him, looking… amused? Before he could be sure, Yula grasped the bottom of his shirt. Her fingertips grazed his skin, and Ben couldn't suppress a ticklish shiver. She said something in Russian softly, then lifted the shirt up. Ben obliged by carefully raising his arms. The undershirt came free. Having the damp undershirt off felt like a step in the right direction for warmth. Yula slowly took the dry long-sleeved shirt from him and unfolded it. Ben reached to help put it on, but Yula said something and put a gentle hand on his chest. Ben stilled at the contact on his skin. He looked away, his heart rate picking up. He wasn't sure if she was being caring or… seducing him? She raised the shirt over his head and helped pull it on him. Her fingers touched against his skin again when she pulled it done to cover his chest. Her hand rested on his right side. Ben cleared his throat. \"Thank you.\" He pushed himself off the bed and stood, not meeting Yula's eyes. -0-0-0-0- \"Any sign of him?\" Trumbull asked. \"Negative, sir.\" Mike paced a small corner of the room. Despite the searches of the replacement drones and satellites, they couldn't find the President in the forest. They couldn't find the attackers either now, and that disturbed Mike even more. \"The Russian rescue team is combing the forest but their odds will be better in daylight,\" a general reported. Mike didn't point out that a lot could happen between now and daylight in Russia. And every hour the President remained missing, the world was in turmoil. Trumbull already suspended trading with the markets, and the news coverage was rampant with speculation. The White House Press Secretary was constantly denying rumors that President Asher was dead. Mike clenched his jaw tightly. No one this side of the Atlantic ocean knew if the President was alive either. He just had to hope. That was all he could do. -0-0-0-0- The truck he rode in ambled down a dirt road, not much more than a path. In the distance, Anatoly could see a cabin in the slight pre-dawn glow. He and his team had stopped at a few other cabins and homes tucked away in this remote area, but this was the further-most from civilization. Anatoly was the first to hop out of the truck when it stopped. He followed the team's leader to the door of the cabin. The leader raised his hand to knock but stopped as engines could be heard. Anatoly looked back to the road, where an SUV could be seen coming towards them. Anatoly frowned. Who else would be out here? -0-0-0-0- An old painting on the wall rattled from where it hung. Ben frowned, first thinking it was an earthquake until he heard the source of the sound: \"Engines,\" he whispered. He brushed past Yula and went to the main room of the cabin. Through the window he saw a military truck, as well as soldiers. \"Russian military,\" he muttered. Could they be trusted? But his heart nearly stopped when he saw a dark SUV drive up behind the truck. The soldiers faced the SUV. Three men from the SUV came out and talked to the soldiers. But Ben recognized the SUV. It was identical to the others that ambushed his convoy. The three men, in perfect synchronization, pulled handguns out and fired at the soldiers. \"No!\" Ben shouted. He stared, horrified. A young soldier fell to the ground. Ben stumbled back. Think, think! He had to evade them, or fight back. He looked to Yula. Her hands covered her mouth in horror. \"Hide,\" he whispered urgently. He grabbed her hand and motioned for her to go to the bedroom. He went over to the kitchen and searched for any sort of weapon. He pulled a knife from a butcher block. He remembered a small window was in the bedroom, away from the front of the cabin. If he could just get out without being seen, maybe he could lose them in the woods again. He hurried to the bedroom. Voices shouted outside the cabin. Yula stood aside as Ben went to open the window. The glass was a solid pane—not something that opened and closed again. He swore under his breath. If he broke the glass, they would certainly hear. Ben didn't have many options. He turned to find something to break the window with. \"Drop the knife, Mr. President.\" Ben froze in his place. The words clearly came from Yula's mouth, which would have shocked him enough, but the gun in her hand clarified his situation. She looked upon him with just a slight measure of satisfaction, but mostly he saw her disciplined stance with the gun. She was one of them. He had walked right into a trap, meant to lull him into feeling safe. She nodded again at the knife. Ben dropped it on the bed. \"Out,\" she said simply, nodding towards the main room of the cabin. Ben slowly moved that way, his eyes staying on hers. The cabin door was kicked in and the three men from outside screamed a variety of orders at him. Ben stared at Yula, his eyes boring into hers while the men seized him and yanked him from the cabin. The cool air that hit him outside made him focus. He thought back to his night-time training sessions and drilled his elbow into one of his captors. The hold on him lessened, and he quickly pressed the advantage to throw off one of the others, but the third captor came forward and kicked him solidly in the chest. Ben fell to the ground, gasping. His mind screamed at him to get up, to fight, to find a weakness he could exploit. Yula joined the three men in a circle around him and grabbed him by the hair, forcing his head to look up at her. \"Don't embarrass yourself,\" she said clearly. Gone was any hesitation in her language. She spoke English perfectly well, though he could hear an accent that was European, if not Russian. \"You are weak.\" Ben's eyes flashed at the words. But before he could resist further and defy her assessment, a sharp needle was shoved into his neck.[Chapter 4] Chapter Four Hunter smelled the salt and wrinkled his nose. He didn't much care for the ocean. Perhaps it was his nickname, but he preferred to be in hidden areas, boxed in by foliage and trees. Not out in the relative open of the sea. The boat rocked under his feet—not a lot, as the boat was a sizeable cargo freighter. But the slight motion was there. He was ready to leave. Payment had been confirmed in his bank account now that he had delivered the American president here. He could just hop onto the zodiac motor boat waiting for him, but he felt compelled to see Asher. He descended into the bowels of the ship. A guard stood outside a container in the lower hold of the ship. Hunter did not acknowledge him; there was no need. He opened the small container by its creaky door. The president lay on a dirty mattress, his right hand manacled by a chain that was welded to the side of the container. He sat up like a startled rabbit, causing a flash of pain to cross his face, no doubt from his slight injuries. \"Who are you?\" the man asked immediately. Hunter held up a hand to silence any further questions. \"It does not matter.\" He sat on the ground, out of his captive's reach but completely comfortable. \"You won't see me again after today.\" \"What a shame,\" Asher said, the bitter sarcasm heavy. \"You are upset. Is it because you fell into my trap?\" Asher glared at him. \"I could have sent my men to keep chasing you through the forest, but a scared animal eventually seeks shelter,\" Hunter said. He was gloating, but he indulged it. This was the highest profile job of his career—not that he would advertise it. \"All I had to do was send my people to any home you might come across.\" Ben looked away, and Hunter knew he was twisting the knife nicely. \"Yula is convincing, isn't she?\" Hunter said. \"If it brings you comfort, you'll see her again. She is… how to say it? A believer.\" \"Of what?\" Asher asked. Hunter smiled. \"You'll find out.\" Hunter smoothly rolled up to his feet and stood. \"Why didn't you kill me?\" the president asked urgently. Hunter considered how much to tell him, if anything. He settled for simply saying: \"You are worth more alive.\" With that, Hunter smiled as if they were old friends, and left. He wondered how long before the president broke or died. It did not matter, he supposed. Their paths would not cross again. -0-0-0-0- He could dwell on how stupid he'd been to fall for Yula's act, but he was starting to spiral down into panic and despair, and he couldn't have that either. Ben knew he needed defiance, clear and simple. But the question that kept going through his mind was whether or not he would be executed. Was he destined for yet another attempt via live stream or something similar? He didn't know how he felt about that if it became a reality. The container that served as his cell held no way to escape that he'd found in the short time since he'd been in it. It was, to describe it perfectly, a metal box. It did nothing for his pride. He was caged and chained, like an animal. \" A scared animal,\" the man had taunted him. He heard voices outside the container. He braced himself as the door squeaked open again. Yula and two men stood in front of him. Ben hated their smug looks. Somehow, they were more predatory too. Ben recalled what the other man had said. Yula was a \"believer.\" Ben feared he was about to find out what level of fanaticism she held. \"You come with us,\" she said. The two men unshackled him from the chain but quickly secured his hands with handcuffs in front of him. They each gripped an arm tightly and walked him out of the container. Ben's heart raced. He tried to take in his surroundings. It was very dim where he was, underground. Or underwater, as he'd heard ships' horns and felt the push of water. There was a flight of stairs that the men half-carried him up. Ben's legs were working better now, thanks to the forced sleep and rest he had gotten courtesy of the drug he was injected with in Russia. A side effect was also a throbbing headache. Where am I? Ben had no idea if he was in Russian waters, or international, or what. The ship didn't seem to be moving yet, but once it did…. If anyone were trying to find him, he would be very hard to track down in open waters. Sunlight reached him, and with it Ben felt his spirits lift. Yula led him and his escorts down a crew cabin hallway, and he was shoved into a cabin. His eyes instantly went to a camera setup. His stomach dropped. Yula nodded to the two men on either side of Ben. They forced him to his knees, though Ben tried to kick out and stop it. The man on his right drew a gun and pressed it against his temple. Ben stilled, but his heart still raced. Yula flicked on the camera. She nodded to one of the men, who pulled out a piece of paper and started reading. \"To the United States of America, we have your president.\" Ben couldn't look at the camera, ashamed to be in this position again. The man with the gun seized Ben by his hair and yanked back, forcing him to look at the camera. \"We demand the immediate removal of all American troops from every foreign nation, territory and land, and stay out of international airspace and waters.\" Ben's eyes widened. I'm dead . There's no way Trumbull or Congress or anyone could or should even consider that demand. That left him with no future. \"Failure to do so will mean your president will suffer, repeatedly.\" That didn't sound promising. But it gave Ben a glimpse of his purpose to these terrorists. He was going to be used to demoralize, humiliate and shame the country. He knew what to do. Ben's heart swelled with both anguish and resolve. He had to write himself off now. One of his captors punched him across the jaw. Ben's head whipped to the side, and the suddenness jarred him. But he quickly straightened up and faced the camera. \"Based on your response, you will see the condition of your president again tomorrow.\" Ben clenched his jaw. He raised his hands as if to swipe at his jaw. He quickly held up two fingers with his right hand, and five with his left. He stared hard into the camera. Yula saw the motion and nodded at the men. His captors hit him again. The force of it drove Ben to the ground, and he was yanked by the collar of his shirt—the same gray one Yula helped him change into—until he was kneeling again and facing the camera. Yula was moving to the camera, ready to switch it off. Ben looked pointed at the lens. He swallowed, his mind recalling that late-night conversation with his son after the London attacks. He wouldn't disappoint his son this time. He quickly said: \"I love you, Connor.\" He was hit again as Yula turned off the camera. Ben braced his fall slightly with his handcuffed wrists. Yula knelt by him and grabbed him by the hair. \"You think you are clever?\" Ben's breathing was out of sync from the blows he'd suffered, but he managed to smile defiantly at Yula. She slugged him in the stomach, favoring his injured side. Ben groaned loudly. She yanked his head back again. Ben yelped at the conflicting forces. Yula peered closely at his face. \"Your life is over. We will keep you alive. We'll use you however we want. Treat you however we want….\" She slid a finger down the side of his face. \"And you will dream of a rescue each night. Only to wake up to this.\" She hit him again, this time across his cheek. She smiled at him as her two cohorts lifted Ben to his feet. Ben could feel her eyes on his back as he was led back to his cell. -0-0-0-0- Mike's fists were clenched so tightly that he feared he might lash out and hit something as the livestream played out. At the end of the message, as a last sucker punch knocked down President Asher, the feeling of total failure encompassed Mike. Vice President Trumbull and generals and analysts began buzzing with talk back and forth as soon as the feed ended. Analysis about where the feed came from, clues from the video's background, speech patterns of the man talking and so forth were thrown about the room. None of these mattered. \"Mike,\" Trumbull called. Mike forced himself to look at the Vice President. Trumbull drew close to him and led Mike to a corner of the room. \"Sir?\" Mike inquired, more out of habit and duty than anything else in that moment. \"They have him, but we're not giving up,\" Trumbull said. It was supposed to be comforting. Mike shook his head. \"But he is,\" Mike said. When Trumbull looked confused, Mike sighed. \"His hands. Did you count the fingers?\" \"Seven.\" \"No,\" Mike corrected. \"Two, and five. He's telling us to invoke the 25th amendment.\" \"That's temporary, and we all know it,\" Trumbull said. Mike appreciated his optimism, but the reality was different, and something apparently everyone in the room needed to face. \"What he said to Connor was a goodbye,\" Mike explained. His heart ached at the thought. \"And telling us to invoke 25? He wants us to write him off.\" Trumbull stared at Mike. \"He knows we can't do that.\" \"He knows we can't give into their demands,\" Mike countered. \"It's not about him. He's always known that.\" Mike felt tears prick at his eyes and he blinked them quickly away. \"Do you know what he ordered me to do in London? He told me to kill him if it meant stopping Barkawi from using him for propaganda. He was ready to die.\" Mike looked to the screen, where the video was played again, being analyzed frame by frame. \"He just told us his life is forfeit.\" -0-0-0-0- a/n: Thanks for reading!

All credit goes to the rightful owners. I only own my OC and any little things I might add on.** Camp David, Christmas Day \"I'm so happy you came with us, honey.\" I looked up from my heels, that I was currently putting on, and looked at my mother. I smiled at her and stood up, \"How could I miss being with my family on Christmas, mom. Plus, I forget about school which always helps with the stress.\" \"I know, honey. Sometimes it's so hard to believe that your nine-teen and going to the University and we're not there to take care of you any more,\" she replies hugging me. \"Yeah, you and dad might not be there, but there sure as hell are the secret service instead.\" My mother smacks me playfully for using 'hell' in a sentence. I laugh at her and continue to fix my dress for the fundraiser we are suppose to attend. \"Got you something.\" She goes over to the dresser and picks up a small wrapped box. \"Oh, mom. You didn't have to.\" I say to her, taking the box in my hands. \"I know, but I wanted to. Now open it.\" I do as she says and slowly open the silver wrapping. Once done removing the wrapping, I open up the black box. I gasp at the beautiful silver flower in side. \"It's so you'll always have something to remember me. I got a flower because that's what you are; and well everyone calls you that.\" I hug her once more and she helps me put it on. \"Thank you so much. I love it!\" She just smiles and walks away. I looked down at the beautiful necklace and play with it. I see mom pick out a black dress from the closet and show it to me. I nod my head and put my two thumbs up indicating that it was the perfect dress. There was a light knock on the door before it opened revealing my father. \"Well, I'll go see what Connor is doing and leave you two alone.\" I walked towards the room's door but was stopped by an arm in front of me. I turned to my father and smiled. He leaned in and gave me a kiss on my forehead, then tugged me in for a hug. \"Eww, dad! You're sweaty!\" both him and mom just laugh. I walk out of their room and go search for my annoying little brother. The clicks of my heels is all I'm able to hear in the isolated hallway, until I near the living room were gunshots and explosions can be heard. I smile knowing Connor is playing that stupid video game knowing mom wouldn't be happy about it if she found out. I smile and give a small nod at the secret service men in the room. I make my way to a window and take a peek outside. If I squint my eyes and focus really hard, I could make out the shapes of men walking around the cabin. My gaze travels around and I see the snow falling in big amounts. \"What are you doing?\" \"Just looking. There's seems to be a snow storm or something,\" I reply to my younger brother, who refuses to look away from the game. I walk away from the window and take a seat next to him. \"You know, if mom catches you playing this she'll kill you, right?\" \"I know.\" I just shake my head at him, but none the less grab the extra control and play as well. I really do enjoy spending time here. It make me feel like we're just a normal family and not the first family. Well that's of course if you don't count the secret service who are constantly surrounding us. A few minute later Mike comes and sits down next to Connor. \"Ah, the real blood bath starts when your mother catches you playing this. And when she sees you playing with him and not stopping it, \" He directs the last part to me. I just stick my tongue out at him and he just laugh turning around to turn the TV off. \"Ugh..You suck.\" \"I agree with Connor on this one, Mike. I was winning.\" \"Yeah, yeah whatever. Now come on.\" Mike has always been such a good friend. He isn't like the rest of the secret service personal. He actually interacts with us and has a laugh. Not just be all serious all the time. He actually taught me a few fighting moves. At first he was reluctant, but I convinced him to do it by saying that it's better for me to know how to defend myself because you never know when I will need to. I haven't been training with him now that I've been living at the University, but I still practice. Mike stood up along with Connor and headed towards the entrance. I heard my mother and father coming so I followed their example and stood up as well. \"Nice necklace.\" Mike whispered, gesturing to my new gift. \"Mom gave it to me,\" I smiled. \"It suits you.\"We turned to face my parents when they reached us. One of the maids helped me put on my winter coat as my father talked about Connor wearing his hat. Mom made her way over to me when she finished putting her coat on. \"Never forget to smile.\" She always told me this whenever we were going to go to a banquet, fundraiser, dinner, or a speech. It was more of a tease sort of thing, since I was always smiling. I'm just that type of person. Out of the corner of my eye, I saw Connor walk up to dad. I smirked already knowing what he wanted.\" Can I drive with Mike?\" Dad turns to look at Mike and then back at Connor, \" You're gonna have to ask him. He's the boss.\" Connor make his way to Mike and asks if he could ride with him. We all know that Mike will cave in; he always does. Though he likes to tease Connor and pretends to think about it. \"Okay, alright. What about you, Cass?\" \"I'm okay. I'll ride with mom and dad,\" shake my head. I turn my head to Diaz one of the secret service guys and say, \"Guess you're riding with us, Diaz. Connor here is taking your spot.\" I pat Connor's head and he just swats my hand away. Diaz just laughs at us but doesn't say anything back. My little family all gathered in front of the main door and I could hear Mike in the back letting everyone know that we were ready to go. It's been about ten minutes now since we left the grounds of Camp David. Dad was concentrated with some papers he had out and mom was looking out the window at the falling snow. I was sitting in the longer seat on mom's side. I had a magazine out and was flipping through the pages not really reading it, just looking pictures. \"Gosh, it's really coming down.\" I put the magazine down and lean towards my mother's window. \"It doesn't look too good,\" I reply sitting back down. Dad just hums in response not paying attention. Mom looks at me and rolls her eyes at dad, which causes me to giggle a little. \"I'm thinking about shaving my head.\" Dad once again just hums at my mother. I smile and decide to give it a try. \"Hey dad? I got a tattoo of a flower on my lower spine. You know? A tramp stamp.\" Mom looks at me trying to hold her laugh in. We turn to look at dad, but all we got was, \"That's good, honey…\" I shake my head and pick up the magazine again. A few moments later I hear my mother's voice again. \"Merry Christmas Mr. President.\" I look up to see mom handing him a wrapped present just like she did to me earlier. Dad takes it from her and unwraps it. \"My God! It's my grandfather's watch...How did you find this?,\" he says in disbelief taking it out and looking at it. \"Just have my ways.\" Dad leans in and give mom a kiss. This is so disturbing and should not be happening in front of me. \"Please stop! I'm still in the car!\" \"Then don't look and put on your seat belt, please. Oh, and don't think I didn't hear you about that tattoo.\" I roll my eyes but listen to my father's orders and put my seat belt on. Mom laugh's at the last past and says that he was listening after all. Dad then gives mom her present and they talk again. I just mind my own business; giving them some privacy. Out of nowhere, the SUV in front of us hits the Beast's front making us whip lash and the car spin. The snow and black ice that is created by it make everything a lot worse. I then hear a big boom and cement breaking. The Beast is still spinning around when it suddenly hits something hard making me hit the back of my head really hard against the side of the limo. Everything is blurry for a while and I have this ringing in my ears. My head is hurting badly and I know that I'm slumped forwards being restrained by my seat belt. I groan and blink my eyes trying to get my vision to clear up. The only thing going in my head was; What happened? \"Cassidy! Honey do you hear me?!\" I could faintly hear my father's voice through the ringing. I groan to let him know that I hear him. \"It's going to be okay\" I then hear my mother's weak voice asking for Connor and myself. I turn my head a little and see that the left side of her head is bleeding. \"Mom?\" I whisper. \"Honey, it's going to be okay,\" her weak voice replies back. I then hear the guys making some commotion in the back side of the car and Mike's voice saying to not move. Dad is yelling at him that mom was hurt and that I might be too. I look to the front and out the front window to see that we were dangling of the side of a bridge. I turn back when I hear the door open. Mike had managed to get my father's door open. \"Sir, get out of the car. I'll take care of them.\" \"No! Take Cassidy first!... Honey undo your seat belt. Can you do that?\" My yelled back before turning to me. I gave him a weak nod and reached down to undo my seat belt. I could hear Mike telling my dad that he needed to get out of the car. My mother's door was trying to be pulled open by some of the other men, I guessed. I undid my seat belt and looked at my dad and Mike. \"Daddy?\" My father and Mike shared a look before Mike nodded and reached out a hand towards me. \"Slowly now, Cass.\" I grabbed on to his hand and slowly made my way towards him. On my way out the car I looked at my mom, who was now unconscious, and called out for her, \"Mom?\" \"She's going to be okay, honey. Now go with Mike.\" I listened to my dad and Mike pulled me out of the Beast. I was handed over to another bodyguard who held on to me since I was still weak and couldn't stand on my own. I looked at the car and saw a couple of the guys trying to keep the car from going of the bridge with my parents inside. You that thing that happens to you when everything becomes slow motion and there's no noise at all? Well that's exactly what happened to me in the following moments that would be embedded into my mind for the rest of my life. Mike pulled my screaming father out of the car just as it went down and off the bridge. I stood there not moving until it dawned on me that my mother was still inside. I jerked forward trying to made my way to where the limo once was with my mother in it, but was held back my the bodyguard. All I could do was scream. Scream for the fact that my mother was gone. **A/N: This is a new fanfic I'll be working on, but I still need to get some reviews to know people actually enjoy it :) Anyways, if you want to know what Cassidy's outfit is, just head on to my profile. The link will be under the story info. Thank you![Chapter 2] 18 Months Later People say that things get better and easier as time goes by. Though it's nothing like that. It's like they try to make you feel better when they know you're far from it. It's been over a year since that night, a year since I lost my best friend, a year since this nation lost their first lady, but most importantly; it's been a year since I've lost my mother. I can't really remember what happened after that night. Everything is just a blur. Perhaps it was due to the fact that I was grieving too much and trying to be strong at the same time. I was trying to be strong for Connor, but it was hard. About two months after her death, I decided to take up the duties of the first lady in honor of my mother. I left school and focused on the duties. Dad even said that my mom would have been proud of me. That only made my ambition of taking up the duty increase. I have become some what accustomed with things now. Just yesterday we went to a small celebration/dinner with some military families to celebrate Independence Day. Now here I was in the White House's gym boxing with a bag at 7:30 in the morning. I took up practicing again, since it help take my mind off things. But whenever I walk in and start my routine, I can't help but think about Mike. After my mothers death, Mike was removed from the presidential detail into working in an office at the Treasury. It was a grudge my father had over my mothers death. I've tried explaining to him that Mike's priority was to save him, but he still believes on should have been saved instead. I've given up on trying to convince him otherwise. 40 minutes into practice, I decided to stop. I need to take a shower and then meet my father in his office for a meeting. Reaching the residential area of the white house, I stopped by Connor's room. Quietly opening the door, I found him reading a book. With a smile, I close the door once again and head over to my own room. I begin to strip from my sweaty workout clothes as I near my bathroom. Taking a quick shower, I hurry and dress quickly. Satisfied with my chosen outfit, I head to the oval office. Taking turns and steps, I finally arrive. \"Good morning Miss. Asher, your father is waiting.\" Greets my father's secretary. \"Good morning Marie,\" I smile walking to the office door passing a couple of secret service men standing guard. Raising my hand into a fist, I give two good knocks. I open the door and step in. I notice that I was just a bit early. \"Hey honey, how are you?\" My father asks standing from his chair and coming towards me. Meeting him halfways, I give him a hug before answering, \"Okay, I went to workout earlier.\" \"You know, Cassidy, if you're not up to the meeting we're going to have in just a few moments, you could just rest.\" I was happy at times like these when my father knew I just wasn't up for something. But I had to be here for this, it was my duty now. \"It's okay, dad. I'll rest later.\" He stared at me for a few seconds before nodding his head in agreement. The door to the office opened and the rest of the meeting members piled into the office. Greeting both my father and I, they took a seat. The meeting had begun. I had zoned everything out throughout the meeting. I kept my gaze on the floor as I played with the necklace my mother had given me. It was almost towards the end of the meeting and an hour or more into the meeting when I decided to pay attention to what was being discussed. \"Minister Lee is going to want you to issue a joint statement, Mr. President,\" The speaker of the house, Allen Trumbull, said to my father, \"Threatening military action to get the North Koreans to stand down from the border and stop their missile tests. Which I think we should give them.\" I looked over to my dad to see him contemplating Mr. Trumbull's words. He gave me a quick look before averting his gaze to the Secretary of Defense, Ruth McMillan. \"Ruth?\" \"Provided that the North Koreans are rational...which is dicey, at best. We bluff. They call it. Then what?\" She says looking between my father and the speaker of the house. \"Who says we'd be bluffing?\" The speaker asks. The room becomes silent for a moment, no one really sure how to answer that. The main thing we should be worried about, is not causing a war. With this in mind, I look over to my father. Looking at me, I mouth to him ' No war'. He nods his head and speaks, \"Personally, I like to try and avoid war….Charlie?\" We all turn to the Vice President for his response, \"I think I agree with Ruth on this one, .\" \"Thank you for sitting in, ,\" my father addresses . With that the speaker of the house stands and exits the room. My father then asks Ruth when Minister Lee will be arriving. She lets him know that he will be here at 7 in the evening. I stand up and walk over to my dad, \"Do I have to be here to greet the minister?\" \"Yes, Cassidy. You do.\" He sits down behind his desk and starts going through some papers. When he notices my silence he looks up at me, \"You don't want to be there do you?\" Giving him a guilty smile I answer, \"Not really. I just want to take a small break. Plus, I have some paper work I need to go over.\" He let's out a sigh and holds the bridge of his nose. He sits like that for a while thinking. \"Okay, you can take the rest of the day off. I'll just give Minister Lee your apologies for not showing up. I'm sure he'll understand.\" \"Thank you so much. I owe you one!\" I walk around his desk and give him a kiss on the cheek. I pull away and head towards the door, when his voice stops me, \"That doesn't mean you can avoid the paper work. It only means you're free from meetings.\" I groan and walk out the door hearing his laughter behind me. ~O*L*H*F~ I walk through the White House on my way to the little office I have for myself. I greet people here and there as I pass them by. Arriving at my office I greet my secretary Linda before heading in. I sit behind my desk and gather all the paperwork I need to look over. Deciding I will be more comfortable in my room, I stand up with the papers in my hand and walk out. \"I'll be up in my room working on these, okay?\" I let Linda know. She smiles up at me and nods her head. Once I'm in my room, I decide to change into something more comfortable. I grab a pair of jeans and a black tank top. Finally comfortable, I begin to go over the things for the rest of the after noon. At around 6:30 in the evening, I decided that I was done for the rest of the day. I neatly place all the things away and stand from the desk I had been working on. I stretch my arms above my head head and let out a groan. I know very lady like, huh? I grab my iPod and listen to some music. Walking over to my bedroom window I look out side to the main lawn. Police officers walk around the lawn with dogs while others walk around with guns. A little more ahead, behind the black gate, I see a group of tourists stepping out of a bus. Knowing they're here to get a look at what I call my home, I walk over to my bed and flop myself on it. Hiring up the volume on my music I close my eyes and get lost in it. Not even five minutes later, I hear the faint sound of commotion. I remove one of my earphone and walk to my window to see people in a panic. I scrunch my eyebrows in confusion at seeing them running away from the White House or out of it. Placing the iPod on a side table I hear a loud engine. Looking up I see a huge plane flying really low and towards our direction. My eyes widen as it gets closer and closer. Then, the unbelievable happens; it begins shooting at the White House. With a loud scream I throw myself to the ground and crawl away from the window as the sounds of shooting are heard. I couldn't help but to panic and be scared, I have never experience something like this. Then realization hits me, Connor is still out there somewhere in the White House. I stand up grabbing a pair of shoes and then heading out of my room in search of my little brother. I just hope he's okay. A/N: first of all, I would like to say how freaking happy I am at the follow/fav's this story has recived. As well as all the reviews and reads.

Enjoy! {Ch.3- White House War } ⬩⬩⬩ White House Presidential Emergency Operation Center(P.E.O.C) 120 ft underground⬩⬩⬩ President Arsher was quickly being escorted down to the emergency bunker. Following behind him were his trusted advisors along with the minister. Though, he was putting a strong face as to not show any fear to his advisors and others, the president was filled with nothing but fear. He feared that his son and daughter could possibly get hurt. He didn't want to think about the possibility of losing them, especially not after his wife. They were all he had left. \"Find my son and daughter?\" The president ordered to a secret service man, as they reached what looked to be a metal door. Another member of the secret service, approached a panel on the wall and pressed his thumb on a scanner then proceeded to add a code making the big metal door open. \"Sylvia, Find Sparkplug and Silver Flower immediately,\" the guard said through a piece in his wrist using the code names, following the President's orders. The president, along with his advisors and the prime minister, were under lockdown inside the bunker designed to protect the president, during situations as the one that was occurring outside in the streets of Washington D.C.. It was a very well secured place that contained all the necessities the president would need. It even had a control room, where the country could be ran by. Members of the secret service were both in and outside the bunker guarding; in full alert. As soon as the president entered the operation room, he was asked if he was okay. The president dismissed them with a nod and got straight to business. Through monitors, the president watched as the attack of the C-130 on Washington and the White House itself. A voice from one of the speakers came through saying they had a shot. It was one of the two F-18's pilots. \" Wolfhound 6, fire at will. I repeat, fire at will ,\" said the voice over of the PPD Command. \" Acknowledge .\" Everyone in the room were hearing the conversation being said by the pilot of the F-18 and PPD command. They watched as the one of the F-18's sent a missile towards the C-130 hitting it. They continued to watch as the plane's right wing hit the washington monument, causing half of it to come crumbling down towards civilians. The plane itself also crashed down a few hundred yards away, erupting into huge flames. Inside the operation room, a secret service agent walked up to the president. \" ? We have confirmation that the bogey is down,\" he informed. \"Thank you, Jones,\" the president thanked. Walking back towards the operation table,where two men sat in controlling the monitors, he began to order. \"Activate Compound One. I want open lines to the Pentagon,Homeland Security and NSA.\" The men quickly got to work in reaching the desired offices. The president then walked over to the Vice President and quietly said, \"Charlie, coordinate with the Air Force and the FAA. Find out if there's a lone aircraft.\" Vice President Charlie Rodriguez quickly agreed and got to it. As soon as the President was alone, he walked over to the Secretary of Defense, Ruth. \"Ruth, where the hell are my son and daughter?\" ⬩⬩⬩ Streets of Washington D.C.⬩⬩⬩ Outside of the White House people had settled down a little now that the plane was gone. Though they were still filled with confusion and fear. A crowd had gathered in front of the White House to try and see what was going on. In the White House lawn, men had held guns pointed at the White House. This just added to the crowds confusion. Mike who had been out on the streets trying to get to the White House, after seeing the plane attack, now stood watching like the rest. At that moment a police vehicle exploded causing chaos among the pedestrians. They began to scream and shout as they hurriedly tried to get away from the burning car. The secret service men immediately got into action. They all pulled out their weapons and readied themselves. However, do to his training and connection with the first family, he stood much more aware of his surroundings. This allowed for him to quickly point out two men with backpacks as they approached the gates of the White House. The way that they seemed collected, made Mike instantly aware of the thought telling him they were trouble. As soon as he called for the attention of one -trying to better figure them out- the man began to pulled something knowing what it was this stranger was pulling out, Mike went with his first him down. It was better than waiting and maybe him himself getting hurt by whatever it was the stranger was pulling out. The now dead man's partner in crime immediately pulled a string from his backpack upon seeing his friend get killed. It was a bomb. He was blown to pieces as well as creating a hole was in the gates. As this caused a distraction, members of the secret service were being attacked by the people who disguised themselves as part of the protection group. Some were even disguised as tourist. They began to open fire against both the secret service on the lawn and those who were running out to help from within the White House. Some put on masks to help cover their identities better and followed suit what the others were doing. Guns were being fired, people were fighting and the men with masks, fired launchers to explode the entry booths to the White House. All in all, chaos had erupted in the White House's front lawn. Mike laid on the floor, with a ringing in his ears, caused by the suicide bomber, trying to contact somebody through his , due to the explosions-from the man earlier- it was failing to work properly. ⬩⬩⬩ P.E.O.C.⬩⬩⬩ Back in the P.E.O.C, the president walked up to the prime minister and sincerely apologised for the happenings. He felt horrible at the fact that such events were happening while someone as important as the prime minister was there. He wanted to know what in the hell was happening out there in the streets. Just then, one of the secret service man walked up to the president grabbing his attention. Upon seeing the look on the man, the president stepped away from the prime minister and led them away to talk privately. \"There's critical message. The White House is under ground attack,\" informed the man. The president looked at the man with surprise and fear. It was a little hard to believe what he had just been informed. The White was one of the most secured and armed places. To hear that it was under attack was just shocking. Now he really wanted to know if his children were safe. This was his fear. Knowing that there was ground attack and not knowing if his children were safe scared him more than anything. One thing was sure, he was going to make sure his kids were brought into the bunker and continue his job; be the president of the United States of America. He needed to make sure that all this was taken care of. ⬩⬩⬩ Cassidy's POV⬩⬩⬩ I sloppy run down the hall as I try putting my shoes on in the process. The sound of the plane shutting had stopped followed by a loud explosion. Hearing the explosion made me immediately drop down to the floor, not knowing what had happened. Stayed there waiting for more to come, not hearing anything, I quickly tied up my shoes and stood up. Slowly walking into an open room, I made my way towards the window that looked upon the front lawn. Slowly peeking through it, a loud gasp left my lips as my hands flew up to cover my mouth. Out in the front lawn laid the bodies of dead security guards and secret service men. Shutting my eyes tightly, I took in a deep breath. When I opened them again, my gaze landed on a fire in the distance that had smoke rising from it. It seemed to be the plane from earlier and most likely the cause of the huge explosion. Looking further ahead, I saw the top of the Washington monument crumble down. I continued to stare with wide eyes. How could something like this happen? Another explosion had me screaming and jumping back from the window, but not to far where I could no longer look out side. Taking a look from where it came from, I noticed a burning tour bus. People screamed and pushed as they ran away from it in panic. I continued to watch as police officers guided them away. My eye just kept going side to side not completely focusing on one specific thing, just watching all these people run. However, they stopped in a group of men who stood in front of the gates looking far from panicked. Instead of running away, the walked towards the gate holding on to their backpacks. I looked around to see if anyone else noticed these men, but no seemed to. Though there was a man slowly making his way towards them. \"Mike…\" I quietly breath out, realizing he was the man. What happened next was all so fast. Mike shot one of the men and the other pulled on something causing the another explosion taking the gate and himself with it. This then somehow ended up creating havoc in the front lawn when the guards and secret service men began firing at the South Korean prime minister's guards. I didn't know what was going on! It was like a war happening in the lawn of the White House! A/N: I would like to say that I am SO sorry for not updating in a REALLY long time. I've just been so caught up on writing my original story and it has just taken up my attention from any of my fan fics. But I will continue this story do not worry :) Also thanks for all the new favs and follows! Until next time![Chapter 4] A/N: So I just wanted to say that about a week ago, I saw the trailer to London Has Fallen ! I'm so excited because this means there will be a second part to this fan fic. But we will have to wait abit since the movie comes out some time next year. But if you have seen the trailer, let me know what you think! P.S. I'm sorry for the long wait... Review replies are at the end. Part One... Having seen enough of what was happening outside, I made my way out of the room I was currently in. I needed to find my little brother and then find someone to tell us what the hell was going on. I quickly ran towards where I had last seen Connor; his room. As I ran down the hallway, I heard the sound of someone running. Not soon later, an agent of the secret service appeared. \"Ma'am we need to get you into the bunker, now!\" He ordered as he reached me. \"No we need to find my brother first!\" Reluctantly he agreed. We made our way towards my brothers bedroom, only to see it was empty. I began to call his name and look in every place possible for him. My heart hammered in my chest at not knowing where he was. I knew he must have been scared, I knew I was. \"Ma'am we need to go. I'm sure another agent came for him, but we need to get you into the bunker or out of here as soon as possible.\" Nodding my head, I followed behind him. It was most likely that another agent came for Connor while all this commotion. Yeah, that must be what happened… I ran behind the agent as we made our way down a flight of stair that lead to the main entrance of the White House. He had his gun drawn out and ready to use if it he had to. It was at times like these I wished I had a gun myself. The sound of gunshots and men could be heard throughout the entire first level of the White House; more so as we neared the main entrance. I didn't know why we were taking this route, but then again, everything around me was in chaos. After a few more seconds, we finally reached the main entrance. It seemed like everything was happening here. The agent that was with me, stepped forward with his gun drawn and pointing ready to shoot. Agents were all running out the doors and shooting. However, as soon as they stepped out, they were shot down quickly. \"Come on! We need to get you to a different exit!\" The agent with me yelled, as he placed an arm around my shoulders and trying to use his body as a shield to protect me. I kept my head down as we passed by the entrance doors. Taking a small peek, I could see other agents trying to get the doors closed. \"We have Silver Flower here! We need to get her to safety!\" The agent with me yelled at some of the others. One of the agents standing by the door made his way towards us. As soon as he was next to us, an explosion from the entrance threw us all back. Both agents covered me as the force of the explosion was throwing us into the air. My body hit the hard-cold surface of the polished floor, which now seemed to be covered in debris. My body ached from the impact and the weight of one of the agents that landed on top of me. I let out a groan as I tried to move from underneath the agent. I looked at him and noticed he wasn't moving, that's when I felt something wet on my side. Looking over him, I noticed a piece of wood embedded into his back. The blood was flowing out of his wound and trickling down to my side. I knew he was dead. Looking around me, I saw the other agent a few feet away. I didn't know whether he was dead as well or just knocked out. \"Get in, get inside!\" the voice of Mike drifted into my ears, causing me to push the dead agent off of me. Once he was off, I rolled over and got on my knees facing the entrance. Gunshots continued to ring as I saw Mike and two other agents try to make their way inside. Mike was the first to enter with another agent right behind him. Unfortunately, before he could make it in, he was shot. The other agent stood outside shooting back, while Mike hid behind a wall and joined. Just as the agent turned to come in, he was shot. I watched as Mike tried to help him in, but it was no good. The agent was shot again. As Mike fell back to avoid being shot, I made myself known. \"Mike!\" His head quickly turned towards my direction. His eyes widen at the sight of me. \"C-Cassidy what the hell are you doing here?\" He asked, as he rushed to my side, helping me stand. \"An agent was taking me to an exit, so that I could get to safety, but…\" I trailed off as I looked around. \"What's happening, Mike?\" Mike placed an arm around my waist helping me. \"We're under attack.\" Was all he said, as we quickly made our way across the room and towards a flight of stairs. We stopped when we heard men . Looking through the railing of the stairs, we noticed men with covered face and guns come in. The began to shoot at the bodies that laid on the floor. My eyes widened in fright. Mike pulled on me to let me know that we had to keep on moving. We ran down the hallways trying to get away from the men. \"We need to get you somewhere safe. Once we do that I need to get you the hell out of this place.\" Mike said. \"What about Connor and my father. We can't leave them here!\" I exclaimed in a hushed tone. Mike didn't saying anything as he pushed open a door, and pulled me into the room. Closing the door and locking it, Mike then proceeded to take me to the furthest corner. \"Mike!\" I yelled, trying to get him to answer me. \"Conner and my dad?\" Mike walked closer to me and grabbed my face in his hands. Looking right at me, he quietly spoke, \"Look, Cassidy… I'm sure they are both safe, okay? Right now, I need to find a way to get you out of here.\" As he finished saying that, gunshots and yelling was heard through the door. With wide and scared eyes, I looked towards it. \"Hey, hey...look at me. Look at me, Cassidy\" Mike ordered. I could feel tears gathering in my eyes, as I returned my gaze to him. \"I'm going to keep you safe, but I need you to be strong. Okay?\" \"Okay.\" I nodded my head. ~O~H~F~ Once the sound had stopped, we slowly made our way out the door. Cautiously, we walked down and isolated hallway, all while Mike had me behind him. Turning a corner, we came across a hallway with the dead bodies of both agents of the secret service and our attackers. \"Okay, look, we need to search them for weapons and see if any of them are alive.\" Mike instructed, bending down towards the first body and quickly patting him for any weapons. I made my way over to the next body and did the same, noticing it was an agent. As I was doing this, I couldn't help but feel pain. These men gave up their lives to protecting my family, the White House, and giving all they had to try and stop this attack. Looking over to where Mike was knelt at, I noticed him next to Agent Roma's dead body. A look crosses Mike's face as he looks down at one of his good friends. My gaze then shifts to a small round object above Mike's head. A CCTV. This could help us. \"Mike?\" I whisper yell. Mike looks at me and I point at the CCTV. \"If we get to the surveillance room, we can have a better vantage point.\" \"That's my girl!\" Mike smiles, as he comes over to me and we make our way towards the surveillance room. Walking down a couple of more hallways, we make to the White House Surveillance room. After Mike told me to stay back and keep quiet, he slowly made his way towards the opened door with a knife. Making a little noise, he waits for whoever was in there to come forward. As soon as the man does, Mike stabs him a couple of times. I wait in my hiding place for Mike to call me over. When he finally does, I see him knelt down next to the dead man. Walking closer, I notice two pictures in his hands. Connor and I... A/N: Once again let me know what you think!

I'll try to update as quickly as possible, please review! The sun goes down Filling the air with color Winds lift you up to god, lift you up to god You fall to your knees, and embrace the storm And you no longer care, if it's cold, if it's warm You live for the danger, like your passion and your anger You don't let go You like to be twisted, by the force You like to be shaken by the wind It had been one hell of a day. More like two, but for one team of exhausted storm chasers, the days seemed to meld together. And every one of them knew they weren't going to be getting much sleep for a long time after tonight. By successfully launching Dorothy IV into the twister, the team had made history today. They had also created months' worth of mind numbing work for themselves, sorting through all the data they received. But for tonight, they were going to bask in the glory of success. And eat. A lot. And for a certain two storm chasers, there was a very long discussion that needed to be had. Dusk found Bill and Jo Harding outside an old diner, watching the light fade. The team had decided that, since none of them had slept in two days, they'd stop at a motel for the night. They snagged the three remaining rooms at a local motel, and headed to the diner across the street for dinner. The rest of the group was still inside, eating just about everything in sight. No one could blame them, after everything they had just experienced, but Jo and Bill had no interest in food. They were leaned up against the Barn Burner, wrapped in each other's arms, and watching the light fade. Neither were sure where this night would lead, they just knew they didn't want to move from each other's arms. You'd rather be wrapped up In the arms of the storm Chasing down the demons[Chapter 2] Disclaimer: I still don't own Twister. And I don't own the song either. This one's by Frou Frou. Chapter Two: So listen up - this sun hasn't set I refuse to believe that it's only me feeling Just hear me out – I'm not over you yet It's love on the line can you handle it Jo was afraid to blink. Wrapped in Bill's arms, she feared that if she closed her eyes, he'd simply disappear. She didn't know what she'd do if he suddenly decided it had just been the excitement of succeeding with Dorothy, and went crawling back to Melissa. But still, she knew one of them had to bring it up. They were both tense; waiting for the other shoe to drop. But, at the same time, both of them were silently waiting for the other one to bring it up. They knew they needed to talk through this. And they were both hoping, beyond all hope, that they could work things out this time. Jo steeled herself, and with a deep sigh, picked her head up from Bill's shoulder. \"Bill?\" \"Hmm?\" Jo hesitated. \"…Are you back?\" Bill pulled back to look her in the eyes. \"Do you want me to be back?\" Rolling her eyes, Jo frowned up at Bill. \"I've wanted you back every day since the day you left, and you know that!\" \"Okay, okay! I know, and I'm sorry. It's just…I don't know, Jo. Sometimes it seems like fighting is what we do best.\" Smirking, Jo winked at him \"Well actually, there is one thing we do better…\" Bill took one glance at the look on her face and burst out laughing. He couldn't help but think about how much he had missed having her in his life. Sure, they fought, but they both knew full well that they were soul mates, if there was such a thing. Melissa was amazing, and truthfully, he probably would have gone through with the marriage, but they both knew it never would have lasted. They were nothing alike. But Jo…Jo was special. Jo had this constant fire burning in her eyes. At times, he resented her passion, her obsession with the storms that would always come first; But that passion, the fire, was the reason he was drawn to her. \"I'm scared, Bill. I don't think I can stand to lose you again…\" Jo lowered her eyes to the ground, feeling incredibly self-conscious. She wasn't used to showing her weaknesses, but maybe that had been part of the problem the first time around. And she was willing to do anything to make it work this time. Gently lifting her chin, Bill smiled slightly. \"I'm scared too. But seeing you again, it was like coming up for fresh air. It's like I've been drowning for months, and seeing your face brought me back to the surface. I've forgotten how to breathe without you, Jo. And I know it's not going to be easy, but I'm not going anywhere. You aren't going to lose me again.\" So listen up Look at me straight Just hear me out Don't make me wait I'm not myself I can't take this Love's on the line Is that your final answer? A/N: I'm not sure where this is going. This chapter was going to be much more argumentative when I started it, but it turned out rather fluffy. It's not over yet, folks. Bill and Jo's problems aren't going to magically disappear! As always, read and review, let me know what you think, & constructive criticism is always appreciated!

The 747 took a sip off her tea. She couldn't stand coffee. It made her jittery. \"Always nice when its quiet isn't it?\" He asked and she chuckled. \"A pity that's about to change. I was just beginning to enjoy my vacation.\" She said. If only she knew how right she was... The C-130 was painted in Air Force decals but she was anything but. Born in Korea she was stolen as a baby and brought across the DMZ. She knew nothing but her North Korean masters and had served for decades in the US Air Force undercover before working her way to Mike's unit at Andrews. Now she would fulfill her destiny. She noticed the F-15s off her wing as she approached the Potomac. \"Attention unknown aircraft this is the fighter off your starboard wing. Request you redirect to vector 280 immediately.\" He made the call 2 more times. That was one thing she loved about Americans. They preferred to shoot later. She preferred it that way as well but her destiny and theirs no longer converged and now they were enemies. They needed to be treated as such. A quick burst of anti-aircraft fire took care of the fighters but she heard one call for help before he crashed. She had only minutes before more came after her from Andrews. She turned sharply, her nose aimed straight for the iconic white building in the center of DC. The men on the rooftop, though brave, never stood a chance. They all fell under her relentless cannons. An F-15 fired a missile but her angel flares did their jobs and the missile was rendered useless. The fighter himself was shot down microseconds later. His partner or perhaps his mate, screaming revenge, let loose with her own volley and this time her flares weren't fast enough. The C-130 cried out as her tail was struck. Trailing smoke and with her number 1 engine on fire, part of her wing burned off, she banked hard, scraping paint with the Washington Monument before crashing in the south lawn of the White House. The ground enveloped her in darkness and she went silently, at peace for her own destiny was fulfilled.[Chapter 2] It took mere minutes for word of the attack to reach Angel's ears. Mere seconds later, the Commander of the US Air Force was issuing orders from the ground at Andrews Air Force base. The cargo planes were sent to collect all the medical supplies they could to drop over GW hospital which would be overrun by the influx of injured by now. The fighter jets were loaded up with all the fuel and ammo they could carry and sent out on patrol to ensure no more aircraft violated the airspace. Angel also sent up 2 Nightwatchers to circle the White House. The third sat next to her on the tarmac. Angel would describe her relationship with her father as military vibes only. There was no personal relationship between the two. Echo had mated with her mother under Boeing's authority. There was never any love to be lost to start with. A part of Angel wished there was. At least she'd have a shoulder to cry on if things turned for the worst. Even so, just having him here brought a sense of comfort to the blue and white jumbo. Her radio crackled. \"Have you confirmed the president in secure?\" She asked. \"He's in the bunker ma'am but it looks to be a hostage situation. Shall I find a way to break in ma'am?\" \"Negative. That bunker is nuclear shielded. There's no way to get inside without killing the president. Continue surveillance.\" \"Understood ma'am.\" Angel sighed. \"Looks like an inside job. President's trapped in the bunker.\" She told Echo. \"We'll get him out ma'am.\" He assured. His tone was flat and calm as ever. Not too unlike her own although inside she was a tornado of emotions. She was terrified at how easily someone managed to get past American defenses. She had been a fervent believer in her own military. To eliminate a threat, secure the president and set up a perimeter in 15 minutes seemed impressive on paper. Until she discovered the hard way that there was someone out there who could overcome all her defenses in 13. Another part of her was angry. Angry at the terrorists who had done things. Fuck, she would blow them beyond hell before this was over. But she was also angry at herself. Angel would not consider herself insecure. She always had complete confidence in her abilities and those in the people around her. But now she wasn't so sure anymore. She wasn't even sure if she was giving the right orders. The terrorists had managed to do what had seemed impossible, what if this was only the beginning. What if they knew what orders she was giving and had planned accordingly. What if her orders caused more unnecessary deaths... It was a dangerous train of thought to be on at a time like this but Angel couldn't find it in her to stop it. Echo looked at his Commander with concern as she bowed her head. \"How could this happen?\" She whispered quietly, almost to herself. The look in her eyes was that of despair and a rage pointed squarely inward. Like looking in a mirror. She was starting to second guess herself. Question every order she gave. That was not something they could afford to deal with at a time like this. It was not something Echo could risk dealing with. He gave her a nudge. That and the beep of an incoming transmission brought Angel's head back up. She narrowed her eyes at the monitor as it displayed a face distinctly Korean. \"Ah, Angel. The President's pet. I've already spoken with the Pentagon but you are who I've really wanted to talk to.\" He said. \"Who are you?\" She asked, drawing herself up. Echo moved away though the Nightwatch had his eyes fixed on the television screen. They were blue, like Angel's and currently narrowed. He had his teeth gritted together, just barely hiding a snarl. His wings twitched as he felt the missile cylos hidden within get ready to deploy. \"The man who controls the White House.\" The Korean replied. \"What do you want?\" \"I want all your air assets out of the DMZ by daybreak tomorrow or I will execute every hostage in this room. That includes the President, the Vice President, the Chief of Staff, and the Secretary of Defense.\" Angel did her best to hide her fear. But it wasn't their impending deaths that had her worried. This terrorist had the three people required to set off America's nuclear defense system. Designed to abort a missile in mid-flight, Cerberus could be used in a terrorist attack to detonate the missiles while still in the cylos. Equaling the destruction equivalent to a nuclear strike. The Korean seemed to know what she was thinking. \"Ah yes, you are well aware of who I hold hostage Angel. Comply with my commands, and I will not release the three headed dog from his chains.\" He gave her a smile that made her blood run cold, then the transmission ended.[Chapter 3] As soon as the transmission ended the whole hanger erupted in chaos. There were people trying to get a voice analyst to help identify the man. A psychoanalyst and a few other analysts that Angel didn't know how to pronounce let alone understand what they did. By the time things died down enough for Echo to move, he noticed Angel wasn't beside him anymore. He looked around for the blue and white jumbo, finally spotting her in the far corner of the hanger. Once again she was firing off orders rapidly. \"Mike, get those C-130s in the air. The hospital needs those supplies.\" Angel ordered. The C-130 nodded. \"Alpha, contact the FAA and have them shut down Dulles airport to civilian traffic, we need to keep the airspace clear.\" \"Yes ma'am.\" The modified F-18 made a beeline for the nearest telephone. \"Brigs, I need you and your unit fueled and ready to get airborne within the hour. We're gonna have a lot of thirsty planes up there.\" She told the KC-135. \"I'm on it ma'am.\" He replied. As the gaggle of aircraft around her began to decrease, Echo could see the change in her. The more orders she gave, the more tired she became. Finally he was able to make his way over to her. \"Have you heard from Fox and Bravo?\" She asked, referring to the other Nightwatchers currently circling DC. \"Bravo's making his way to a tanker. Fox is remaining on station until he comes back.\" He replied. She nodded. \"Good. We're gonna need their intel if we have any hope of getting the White House back.\" \"Snap out of it Commander.\" He growled suddenly. Shocked, she snapped her head up, eyes meeting his. \"Excuse me?\" She asked. \"You're second guessing yourself, Angel.\" He continued. \"And I can't have that, from anyone.\" His eyes narrowed. \"Even you.\" She glared and for a brief moment it was clear how much father and daughter were alike. But after a minute, Angel nodded. \"You're right.\" She sighed. \"But what if I am doing the wrong thing?\" She asked. \"Those terrorists were able to breach our security and take down what we had in less than 15 minutes. How can I be sure they don't have something else up their sleeves?\" \"You don't know.\" Echo replied. \"But right now we need the chance to fight more than we need results. And you're the only plane who can give us that chance.\" She considered his words for a minute. That was another thing they shared. No matter what their state of mind, they always thought things over carefully. \"Okay then.\" She said. \"Let's theorize here. How do these men get through our defenses? They're built to be impregnable from the outside.\" \"Then it had to be someone from the inside.\" Echo replied. \"Okay, now it's not so much who that matters right now. Whoever it was is either dead or in the bunker and will be dead before the sun rises.\" She growled. \"Now we just need to find a way to get inside.\" \"Got another call coming in. It's from the President's sat phone.\" A brief surge of hope filled Angel. \"Put it through.\" She ordered. A voice, not the presidents came across the line. The man identified himself as Banning, a former secret service agent. Angel had met him several times. She knew he could be trusted. \"Commander.\" Echo whispered beside her. \"I think we've just found our way inside.\" Angel nodded once, in complete agreement. She opened the channel on her end. \"Agent Banning you're speaking to GOAF * Angel Boeing.\" \"Ma'am.\" Banning greeted. \"These terrorists are lead by a man named Seng.\" Angel felt Echo stiffen at the name. It sounded familiar to her as well but she couldn't place it. \"They're very well trained and organized. They want the Seventh fleet and all military personnel out of the DMZ.\" \"I am aware Agent Banning. Seng has already ordered me to remove my air assets from the region.\" \"Do not comply with his commands.\" Banning said. Angel bristled momentarily at the unexpected order but forced her control surfaces flat. \"Agent Banning if you think...\" She began. \"I know I can't order you but I'm asking you, General. You cannot give this man what he wants. He won't stop here.\" \"If you give a mouse a cookie...\" Angel sighed. \"He's gonna want a glass of milk. Precisely.\" Banning finished. \"You have 30 minutes Banning, then I'm giving the order.\" \"Understood ma'am. The Pentagon's sending reinforcements to assist me.\" For some reason this information chilled Angel's soul and she couldn't remember why. But then it came to her. \"Banning hold on!\" She growled and raced to the nearest computer terminal. She couldn't get inside the White House but the last information received showed exactly what she feared. She returned to the screen. \"Banning you have to call off those reinforcements.\" She growled. \"The last info given from the White House before it went dark indicated that Hydra 6 was still online.\" Echo looked at his daughter, his own dread matching hers. \"What's Hydra 6?\" \"That's classified.\" The quip came out automatically before she could stop it. \"Classified my ass. Now are you gonna tell the only son of a bitch who has a chance to help you what the fuck's going on or not?\" Angel knew she should be mad. She knew she should chew him out for his insubordination but he had balls and she was impressed. Besides, he did have a point. \"It's a powerful anti-aircraft weapons system about 100 times that of Phylinx. You have to call off that attack or there will be mass casualties.\" \"Copy. Oh...\" Banning cut out but moments before he did Angel and everyone else in the room heard the unmistakable sound of approaching helicopters. ... * GOAF stands for General of the Air Force[Chapter 4] Angel felt nothing but dread as she watched the live video feed. She could see the Apache helicopters, loaded with SEAL commandos fly over the fence. She saw the gunmounts on the rooftop appear and activate. She saw the tracers streak through them like they were made of paper. She watched one helicopter go down, then two, then three... She heard the order for a retreat and couldn't recall if she had given it but she swore she heard her voice through the feed on the lead Apache's radio. He repeated her order and they began to fall back. Angel was just beginning to breathe a sigh of relief when two of the helicopters made it safely back over the fence. Then all that changed. A lucky hit to his tail rotor and the lead helicopter entered his death spiral. The relief turned to dread. His voice filled her ears. \"Mayday! Mayday! I'm hit! I'm hit! I'm going down! Mayday! Mayday!\" She was so glued to the screen she couldn't even flinch when he crashed onto the roof, his main rotors spinning him around twice before his gas tanks ignited. Only now did Angel flinch back at the flash of light that filled the screen. It suddenly felt unbearable in here. The tornado of emotions had become a hurricane and she couldn't stand it. She couldn't stand being in this hanger with all these people counting on her, depending on her. When all she had done so far was send them to their deaths. Once outside she let her frustration show. The trees bore the brunt of her rage as she engaged in a boxing match with them. One truck blasted by engine exhaust, two trunks blown to smithereens, a third toppled over. Angel turned around to strike a forth and pulled her punch last second. The forth trunk wasn't a trunk at all. \"What, are you doing here?\" She hissed out. Echo shrugged. \"I saw you make a run for it. Figured you needed a good vent. And trees are hardly worthy opponents.\" He said, getting into a fighting stance. She growled and lunged at him. He dodged nimbly to one side, giving her a light swat across the flank as he did so. Snarling she pivoted and came at him again and again he dodged. \"You're mind is clouded my daughter.\" He said. \"You can fight twice this good even when you're ill.\" \"Do not call me that!\" She snarled. \"You have no right to call me that! You never did before. You never even cared!\" She slammed their heads together, pushing with all her might to gain some leverage over the male 747. Echo pushed back just enough to hold her in place though he easily could've flipped her. \"Perhaps your right. I don't. But you are my child Angel and I care for you just the same.\" He said through a pant. Angel was strong, nearly as strong as he was and it was taking a lot of effort to keep her from gaining any ground. Thankfully, her anger and therefore her resistance faltered and she collapsed to the tarmac in front of him. He lowered himself down beside her. \"You will never forgive yourself. Even when other's forgive you. War is a hard thing and in some ways it is harder on the commanders than those on the ground. For they have to live with the consequences of their choices. You were chosen to be GOAF because we knew you could live with it. It's hard. I know. I cannot claim to understand but I do know. But the Air Force needs its Commander. We need you Angel.\" Angel looked at him, eyes filled with tears but she hadn't let a single one drop. \"That lead helicopter's name was Sanford. I knew him from my days in the Academy. He taught me how to fire my missiles.\" She said. \"I'm sorry.\" Echo replied, rising to his wheels. She did the same. By the time they had turned their noses to the hanger, the tears in Angel's eyes had vanished and her gaze had hardened. \"I don't care why they attacked this country. I don't care how many threats they make. By dawn, they will be dead. I will have seen these bastards to have paid for their every transgression with their own blood.\"[Chapter 5] Banning had managed to reach the bunker. That was the first good news Angel had received all day. The bad news was he was too late. Kang had perished along with the president. She still recalled what that sick bastard had said to her just before he died. \"I see your Seventh Fleet is withdrawing but not your air units. You didn't give the command Angel.\" \"I've been giving too many other commands to try and send this down the slow chain.\" \"Too bad. Since I didn't get what I wanted. You won't get what you want. Say goodbye to your master Angel.\" \"What do you want sir? I'll recall the forces...\" \"No Angel!\" It was Asher's voice now. \"Don't you negotiate. Don't negotiate, ahh!\" \"Sir? Sir?!\" Angel was angry. She was scared. She was sad. She was horrified. But most of all, she was numb. Just a cold, bone chilling feeling that spread throughout her body, seemingly paralyzing her. And she never felt a thing. Angel got an insistent pinging on her private radio that finally snapped her out of it enough to answer. It was one that few people knew and so naturally she was curious and a bit suspicious. \"This is GOAF.\" \"Angel, Asher is not dead.\" Angel recognized the voice as Banning's but was so surprised she completely forgot the slip in protocol. \"You have 15 seconds, go.\" She growled. \"Angel, listen to me. Kang's not going to go out without a fight. He's not that type.\" Happiness fluttered in her for a moment before she stifled it decisively. She couldn't risk getting her hopes up just yet. This wasn't over. Not by a long shot. \"If the president is still alive and so is Kang. Then they cannot leave the White House grounds.\" \"I'm on it.\" Banning said and signed off, leaving the anxious VC-25 with nothing to do but wait. It was an heart wrenching 10 minutes before Banning got back on the phone again. \"Kang's been taken care of but we have a bit of a problem. There's a countdown running and I don't know what it is.\" Angel feared she did. \"Check the status of Cerberus, Mike.\" She ordered. \"It's running ma'am. All three codes have been entered.\" \"Son of a bitch!\" Angel swore. It was rare for her to cuss out loud, even rarer still to be heard doing so. But Mike made no comment. He knew how warranted and how understated the vulgar was. \"Banning, that countdown is Cerberus.\" \"And what's Cerberus?\" Angel was tempted to give another 'I'm classified' quip but there was no time. \"Cerberus is a highly highly classified system. It's a fail safe for our nuclear stores. If a missile was inadvertantly launched it's Cerberus that would abort it mid-flight. But if that abortion goes off with the missile still inside the cylo...\" She heard Banning swore this time. \"How do I turn this thing off?\" \"I'll talk you through it. Go to the console that says 'Mid-flight.\" \"Got it, next?\" \"Hit the abort sequence button.\" She heard the computer's automated voice system say the sequence had been initiated. \"It's asking for a code. What's the code.\" Angel read it off in rapid fire, correcting herself after the Hashtag moment. It was a tense moment as the timer went below 5 seconds before it stopped at 3. Everyone breathed a sigh of relief and then the cheer went up. Angel's was perhaps the loudest of all. \"Thank god. Thank god. Thank god.\" Was all she could think. After a single night that felt like a year, the attack was over. It was business as usual at Andrews within minutes. The Nightwatchers circling the White House were called back though the airspace remained close and fighters still patrolled the perimeter. It would be quite a while before Dulles was opened again. Mike and Echo both went to greet their respective units as they landed and began their own debriefings. Now that the crisis was over, Angel had little to do. She gave a few more orders to tell the special units to stand down, then made her way out onto the tarmac. She wobbled a bit on her wheels. She was more tired than she thought. Then again, so was everyone. Quite a few C-130s had fallen asleep during the attempted briefing before their CO saw the futility of his action and gave up. Mike was currently sleeping next to his unit, propellers twitching. The Nightwatchers were beginning to settle down at the far end of the tarmac, not far from Angel's hanger. As she prepared to go inside, Echo rose from his place beside them and approached her. \"All's well I take it?\" He asked. She nodded. \"The rest of our units are on their way back to base. The cleanup is beginning as we speak but I've left that in the hands of the FBI and NTSB. They can take that from here.\" She replied. \"You did well.\" He praised her. \"I think, no I know I couldn't have done it without you. My focus isn't what it should have been. I'll need to work on that.\" \"I know you'll do fine in your training. You always have.\" \"I was wrong you know.\" She said, looking at him. \"You do care. And I was a selfish fool to think otherwise.\" \"Angel, my sweet Angel.\" He pressed his muzzle to hers. \"Your mother would be so proud of you. As am I.\" \"Thank you.\" She whispered, unsure of what else to say. He nodded and started to head back to his unit. \"Echo?\" She called after him. He paused, turning back to her. \"Yes, Commander?\" \"Angel.\" She corrected, giving him permission to call her by name. \"Could I stay with you tonight? I just- I don't feel like sleeping in there alone.\" He smiled warmly at her. \"Of course.\" The two taxied back to Echo's unit. Angel settled next to Foxtrot while Echo laid down on the outside. She shifted over to him, curling up in a tight ball at his side, their wings interlocking. She was asleep before she'd even finished settling. Gently, so as not to disturb her, Echo brushed his muzzle along the back of her hump. \"Sleep well, my beautiful daughter.\" The warmth along Foxtrot side was unfamiliar but not unwelcome. Still, as the sun rose his curiosity won out. He opened his eyes to see his commander with the GOAF curled up at his side. Angel rested peacefully at Echo's side with the older jumbo's head resting across her hump, his own body curled around hers protectively. The pair sleeping day away as only a father and daughter could. ","Summary":" July 5, 2013 \"So how was your fourth?\" \"The usual.\" Angel sat side by side with her lead C-130 "},{"Movie":"Olympus Has Fallen","Title":"Ben and Banning: Derailed","Author":"QuestRunner","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12140832","Passage":"[Chapter 1] Banning sprinted across the tarmac with the President in tow. He kept a secure grip on his superior's arm, looked both ways before crossing the street, and hauled a gasping Ben into the shadows. \"Stay sharp, Mr. President. We only have two more miles until we reach our destination. Do you copy?\" Banning watched as the Head of State wiped sweat from his brow and tried to catch his breath from the exertion. He gripped Ben's shoulders tightly. \"I said, do you copy?\" \"I can't...breathe...hold on...\" \"Answer me, sir! Are you okay? What's your status? It's a simple yes or no!\" He cussed and spat into his comm. \"We've got a situation with Southpaw. I repeat, Southpaw unresponsive.\" \"I'M FINE,\" Ben snapped icily. Banning tapped his comm in affirmation. \"Disregard. Code Green. Southpaw alert.\" He clapped his comrade on the shoulder dramatically. \"I'm gonna scout the area. Whatever you do, don't move until I get back and can escort you through the safest path.\" \"Mike, it's okay-\" \" Stay here, Mr. President! That's a direct order!\" \"Well, then I veto that order!\" Ben huffed, but his words went unheeded as Banning tore through the streets. He ran a hand through his hair in agitation as his security agent disappeared through an alleyway and out of view. Once his breathing returned to normal, the President started to stomp away from his hiding place when Banning suddenly returned, not a hair out of place. \"The next mile is clear, sir. Only friendlies in sight.\" \"Did you just run a sub four minute mile?\" Ben asked incredulously, glancing as his watch. His stoic, possibly Scottish partner waved the words aside. \"No time for that now. Look, we only get one shot at this. We'll make a break for our rendezvous point. Can you make it there, Mr. President? Once we leave this spot-there's no turning back.\" Without waiting for an answer, Banning dragged his fuming charge onto the pavement and ushered him through a series of twists and turns along the path. By the time they reached their destination, Ben could barely stand and flopped into a cushy armchair in exhaustion. Banning cartwheeled to his side and checked his pulse. \"Stop it!\" Ben scowled and slapped his hands away. \"I'm fine, I just need some water.\" \"Southpaw requested water. I repeat, water,\" the agent commed, much to his comrade's annoyance. Before he had time to blink, a cold water bottle was pushed in his hands and he unscrewed the top with vigor. Banning swiped the bottle and took the first sip. \"HEY!\" \"It checks out. Good news, sir. It's not poisoned. You can drink now.\" \"It was SEALED.\" \"If it's not the Presidential Seal, it doesn't count.\" The President threw his hands up in exasperation. \"When are you gonna stop walking on eggshells around me and start treating me like an adult?!\" The door next to Banning's armchair opened and a regal figure entered with a grin. \"When people stop trying to kill you, Mr. President,\" Vice President Trumbull said with an eyebrow raise, hypnotic voice aside. \"Which is never. So, how'd your morning run go in the park? I see you made it back to the White House in one piece.\" Ben made a face as he chugged the cold water from his now tampered water bottle. He poured some in his hand and ran it over his head and shoulders in an effort to cool down. \"Ugh, barely. I swear if Mike isn't trying to save me, he's trying to kill me.\" A few nameless secret service agents patrolling the perimeter of the East Garden Room raised their guns steadily on Banning's chest while the Scottish agent brought his hands up in surrender. \"IT WAS A JOKE!\" Ben roared, dismissing the over-eager agents with a frown. He took another swig of water to calm his nerves, and hacked when the liquid went down the wrong pipe. Banning was at his side in an instant, attempting to perform the Heimlich maneuver. \"You're choking, Mr. President!\" \"No, I'm not!\" Ben howled as he pushed the Scotsman aside and squeezed himself behind Trumbull so he could use the Vice President as a shield. Trumbull had seen this song and dance a thousand times; he turned calmly, clasping his superior on the shoulder. \"Come now, Mr. President. We're all just looking out for you. Don't forget your personal boxing match with Banning at 1400 hours.\" Ben looked up in horror as if he had just realized another beat down was on the agenda for the day. \"No! I refuse!\" Trumbull regarded him with a look of pity. \"Ben. You've been zip-tied in your own panic room, shot at, survived an Air Force One plane crash, nearly died in a car accident and became a YouTube sensation...most of that all in one day. Forgive us for being a little...overprotective.\" \"You're right,\" Ben relented, offering his friend an apologetic smile. \"But I'm just saying that my forty-four predecessors didn't include boot camp as part of their daily regimen.\" \"Spark Plug is making his way to the kitchens, presumably to steal more ice cream. I need agents Rogers and Stark to intercept and detain. Commence Operation Spark Plug,\" Banning said as he glanced at surveillance footage on his government issued tablet. \"Give me that!\" Ben snarled and tugged the device from Banning's hands. \"You're tracking my son while he's going to get ICE CREAM?\" \"Affirmative, sir. It's his third bowl this week. At this rate, we're going to have to-\" \"Don't say it!\" Trumbull ordered, but the operative held up his hand. \"He has a right to know.\" \"The right to know WHAT?\" the President spat. Banning ran a hand over his stubble with a sigh. \"Remain calm, sir. I don't want to alarm you, but at this rate, we're gonna have to switch to low fat ice cream. It's for Spark Plug's own good. Our prime directive is making sure you and your son are healthy and safe.\" \"Okay, that's it! Out, everyone out,\" Ben commanded, ushering the agents and Vice President out the door. He stopped the lead agent in his tracks before he could stand at attention outside the room. \"Not you, Mike. We need to talk. This is getting out of hand.\" The President sighed in thinly veiled irritation as Banning checked the floors, walls and ceiling three times for bugging devices before he was satisfied. \"Perimeter's secure, sir. Not that it wasn't before - IT WAS - but you can never be too-\" \"Careful, yeah,\" Ben finished, kicking off his sweaty running shoes and allowing himself to sink into a rather comfy high backed chair. He rarely got the chance to just relax these days, even with Connor, and it felt good to be out from the scrutinizing public eye for a bit. Even if he did have to spend this precious time lecturing his best agent. He closed his eyes for a second, which was as much short lived as it was a mistake. \"MR. PRESIDENT!\" Banning hollered, slapping Ben in the face to bring him back to consciousness. His sense of peacefulness shattered in an instant. \"This is EXACTLY what I'm talking about, Mike!\" he snapped. \"I know this presidency has been tough what with the kidnappings and attempted murders, but I survived! I'm not made of glass! You could say I'm made of...bourbon and bad choices.\" \"Sorry sir, force of habit. If you think this is bad, you should see the kid's room,\" Banning replied, referring to his baby daughter. After a brief moment of silence, Ben said with a smirk, \"You bought the Kevlar mattress, didn't you?\" The Scotsman nodded wryly. \"Don't forget the twenty security cameras, two metal detectors, forty one baby monitors and an eye-scan entry for the baby's room. We're bulletproofing the walls next week.\" \"Jeez, that kid is safer than the American President,\" Ben said with a laugh. He could feel his earlier annoyance ebb away as his mind slipped into more familiar territory of families and kids. It felt good to laugh - to genuinely laugh - after the hell they'd been through the past...how long had it been? Three years? He shook his head in disbelief. \"Babies are tough. Tougher than you think. And you're gonna regret having forty one baby monitors when your little bundle of joy wakes up screaming in the middle of the night.\" Banning let out a hearty guffaw. \"Yeah, it hasn't been a picnic. When did Spark Plug start sleeping through the night?\" The President shrugged. \"Connor? Don't remember. I never kept track of that stuff. Maggie always-\" he stopped, and cleared his throat awkwardly. \"Well, which brings us back to the ice cream. Connor and I sorta made it our thing after his mother...since she wouldn't allow him to have any. It's meaningful to him. To us. Like our daily jokes. So just let him eat the damn ice cream.\" The secret service agent froze, blood rushing to his face. \"Oh, Mr. President, I didn't mean-\" \"I know,\" Ben said, clasping his friend on the shoulder. The door opened with a flourish and a young female aide pushed some hefty papers into the President's hands. \"Your itinerary, sir. For your upcoming overseas conference.\" Ben started to throw the plans toward Banning as he wanted to take a shower before handling important papers, when he suddenly seized in fear as he glossed over the words. \"I-I'm to be shuttled by car...at night...to catch my flight with Air Force One...?\" he deadpanned, ending the statement with a question. His night travel had ceased significantly since Maggie's accident, other than London, and he hadn't been on a plane since they crash landed and poor Lynne...He looked to Banning with pleading eyes. Change the plans! he thought vividly. He'd never told Banning of his fears but knew he'd understand. He breathed a sigh of relief as the agent snatched the papers and skimmed through its contents with a sigh. \"I'm sorry, Mr. President, but these travel plans won't work. You'll be too exposed on the road and an Air Force One flight is exactly what they'll be expecting, no matter how early you arrive to the conference.\" Banning gave Ben an encouraging smile before passing the documents back to the startled aide. \"But you'll be with him the whole time, Agent Banning. Surely the bulletproof vehicle and secured flight are the safest options. Vice President Trumbull himself approved the itinerary-\" \"Then we'll have to change it. I'll speak with the Vice President myself,\" Banning said and made a show of disappointment. \"My apologies for this delay, sir. I'll get it squared away by lunchtime.\" Ben silently thanked his comrade for his understanding. He feigned agitation and waved the head agent away. \"I'm counting on it, Mike. We can't afford for any mistakes. This conference marks the birth of a new country, Libertalia, and with their natural resources, we need them as an ally.\" After Banning and the aide left his side, he retreated to his quarters for a shower and changed into a dark suit with an American flag pin adorning the lapel. The moment he descended the stairs, Trumbull intercepted him and steered him toward the briefing room. \"Come with me, Mr. President. We've changed your travel plans for the upcoming public appearance.\" Ben visibly relaxed and let out a breath he hadn't realized he'd been holding. \"That's fortunate. I'm glad everything's in order.\" Trumbull sighed deeply, slowing his steps. \"For now. But your aversion towards certain modes of transportation can't be completed ignored, either.\" The President stopped in his tracks. Trumbull knew. Probably the entire White House staff knew of his fears, his weakness – \"Allan,\" Ben began, but his Vice President cut him off. \" \"We had to come up with a compromise. Will you be okay with that, Mr. President? Because Banning's going to go into hysterics if you have a REAL panic attack.\" Panic attack. Ben thought the words made him sound frail. Not made out of glass indeed, he thought dismally even as his chest constricted at the thought of speeding along a dark snowy road or cowering in fear on an aircraft. \"And, the plan now?\" Trumbull smiled encouragingly. \"A morning armored escort drive to Air Force One, where you will be flown to a portside city in Libertalia. It's only a two hour flight. You will then take a train the rest of the way. I know you're more comfortable by boat, but getting you there via sea was out of the question. In the end, we decided it would be more inconspicuous for you to take the train directly to the conference. There will, of course, be a show of Air Force One landing at the embassy, to create the illusion of your arrival.\" Ben thought this course of action through and nodded slowly. \"This could work. Thank you, Trumbull.\" The Vice President huffed in amusement. \"Well, I'll take all the thanks I can get, lest you forget how busy I am every time you go off the radar - but it's Banning you should thank. He put the scenario together and is planning to work double overtime to accomplish it.\" \"HE'S WHAT?!\" Ben screeched, eliciting concerned glances from the secret service agents scattered every few feet. \"It's just travel arrangements! It's-\" \"It's a potential life or death situation. Everything is. From your morning runs to the Prime Minister's death. But, as you don't fully grasp the concept, I'll repeat it - you've created more work for your security team and especially Banning, who didn't even take his full leave after his baby was born. I'm not saying the work is unnecessary, given your past experiences. No one is. But I want you to at least consider this for future excursions.\" Trumbull's melodic, non-judgmental voice rang through Ben's ears. He felt terrible. He was a selfish, horrible person. Why did anyone even vote him back into office? He stormed the briefing room and glared intimidatingly at Banning. \"I appreciate your assistance, Agent Banning. As of now, I'm reinstating your leave as it has come to my attention you cut it short. You're dismissed.\" There. Now the idiot could spend time with his family. Ben felt slightly better. \"Okay, for one thing, my leave was extended against my will and I chose to assert my 6th amendment right so that I could continue my services,\" Banning said defensively from his position bent over a series of maps. \"The right to a fair and speedy public trial by jury?\" Ben inquired, exchanging glances with Trumbull who just shrugged. The agent slammed his palm against the table. \"No! I mean the amendment that allows me to work where and when I want, especially if that means protecting the most important man in America.\" He tore his eyes from the maps, filled with detailed sketches of the President's newest travel arrangements, and ran a hand through his hair. \"The truth is, I can't trust anyone else for this undertaking, sir. I know that I can keep you safe and do a damn good job of it, too. Honestly, who else would be skilled enough to foil your assassination-TWICE.\" Ben couldn't argue with that logic - and, frankly, neither could Trumbull - so the new travel itinerary was approved and implemented per Banning's watchful eye, and within a week the President was on a train headed to the heart of Libertalia. Despite his initial dread, the plane ride had been happily uneventful and Ben had managed to...well, relax wasn't quite the best description. But he had remained quite calm during the ascent, which he was significantly proud of, given the turbulence. When he realized they were speeding over bodies of water and tropical landscapes rather than austere architecture, his nerves settled a bit more, although he was more than ready to touch solid ground again after the landing. Now that he was safely aboard the train, the President's appetite and sense of humor had returned. He checked his watch. Banning had left their cabin to scrounge up some dinner from the kitchen staff so he could make sure the food was safe for consumption. That was fifteen minutes ago. He hadn't returned. \"Mike?\" Ben asked softly, his voice sounding ghostly in the empty room. He fidgeted with the American flag pin on his shirt, half concealed by his jacket. Banning was opposed to him wearing anything that would identify him as an American, but Ben had refused to part ways with the patriotic symbol and now gripped it like a lifeline. \"Mike?\" He said a bit louder, opening the cabin door and peeking his head out for a quick look. Nothing. He ventured a trembling step out in the hallway, his heart pounding fiercely. \"Miiiikkkeee-\" a dark figure barreled into his chest and forced him to the ground. He wheezed for breath, his ribs aching considerably. \"Mike!\" he yelped as loud as he could. The figure then lifted him roughly to his feet and...and...\"MIKE? Why-WHAT were you thinking?\" \"What was I thinking?! What were YOU thinking, exposing yourself like that-\" \"I was looking for you-\" \"Yeah, well I HAVE a comm, Mr. President,\" Banning countered gruffly as Ben stood coughing in shame. \"Uh, right,\" he said lamely as the Scotsman continued. \"Not that I would've answered. I wanted to see how you'd react if we got separated and you had to think for yourself. This is without the whole kidnapping/damsel in distress thing in mind.\" \"I wasn't kidnapped! I'm. Not. A. Child!\" Ben growled between breaths. He hated that word. Kidnap. He wasn't five years old! \"I was forcibly TAKEN by terrorists, which just happened to occur more than once.\" Banning was undeterred. \"I can't protect you against your own foolishness. You should've stayed in the cabin if I didn't return, kept your cover.\" \"Last time you told me to stay put, I defied that order and saved your life!\" Ben said smartly. Banning pushed the Head of State into the cabin and snapped the door closed. He crossed his arms and regarded Ben with a scowl. \"When we boarded the train, what was the color of the woman's scarf sitting in Seat 5 Row E?\" \"I...well...blue?\" \"What's the first name of the conductor? Theodore, Erik or Pierre?\" \"It's, uh...Erik?\" \"At the train station, there was a mural painted on the wall. What was it?\" \"Um, I dunno...a tiger?\" \"What are the three desserts they're serving tonight?\" \"Well, I-\" Banning cut off his feeble answer with a wave of his hand. \"Incorrect, Mr. President. The woman in Seat 5 Row E didn't have a scarf. She was wearing a red hat. The conductor is female and her name is Ashley. The train station had no murals of any kind. And the desserts are triple chocolate mousse drizzled in caramel, strawberry filled éclairs and rich peanut butter glazed brownies with a dash of cinnamon.\" \"HOW WOULD I EVEN KNOW ALL OF THAT?\" Ben snapped. Much to his surprise, the agent laughed as he flopped into a cushy side chair. \"You wouldn't, Mr. President,\" he said and continued to chuckle. \"It's part of my job. Makes me reeeaaalllyyy good at trivia. You should see me at parties.\" Ben smirked and rolled his eyes. \"I get it. Follow instructions.\" \"Listen, sir, the point I'm trying to make is that I have my strengths and so do you. I don't see how you do it, running a country while raising a kid! And then there's that whole presidency thing, shaking hands with politicians, making motivational speeches, expanding the trillion dollar debt-\" \"I get it, Mike.\" \"I could never do what you do. I'd rather have my fists or gun do the talking. But you have the ability to be more like me-more aware, more proactive. You don't want to be at someone else's mercy again, right? Just like I don't want to have to keep saving your sorry ass. So do something about it. Pay attention, be alert, and most importantly, obey any orders I give you. Deal?\" Banning held out his hand with a lopsided grin. Ben smiled and shook the Scotsman's hand firmly. \"Deal. Just don't throw a fit when I surpass you, Mike.\" Ben had three triple chocolate mousse desserts after dinner before Banning cut him off, after which he gave Connor a quick call, ensuring he was okay. They still had a solid hour of travel until they reached the conference, and Ben planned to catch as much shut eye on the train as he could, for there would be no rest once they arrived. He groaned thinking of the upcoming political affair and buried his head in a pillow. He HAD to make a good impression with this country, HAD to, God knows America had enough enemies already! Banning exploded to his feet, hand to his comm and face tight with...? Ben couldn't identify the expression. Horror? Disgust? He also stood, glad he was wearing street clothes with a super rad leather jacket instead of his usual ensemble. And comfy shoes. He had learned at least that much from London. Ben assumed Banning was speaking with another agent, but something didn't feel right. \"Mike, what's going-\" Banning motioned him to stay silent. \"Who the hell are you? And how did you get through to this line?\" Ben's eyes widened in fear. Was his position compromised? He tried to pantomime in order to get more information, but the agent just slapped his hands away. \"You lay one finger on him, and I'll kill you, you son of a-\" The back of the train exploded loudly, and almost pulled the train off the tracks. Their compartment shuddered and pitched the duo forward. The President caught himself against a chair and cringed until the cabin steadied. Banning tore off the comm and smashed it under his boot. \"This is just bloody brilliant. Someone compromised the comms!\" He turned to face Ben as he withdrew a concealed gun from his jacket. \"Prepare yourself, Mr. President. It sounds like there are some really pissed off bad guys on this train and what they have planned-well, let's just say it's not good.\" He gripped Ben by the shoulders and gave him a light shake. \"I'm gonna give you a gun, Ben. You shoot anyone that isn't me, got it?\" Ben nodded while Banning tugged a spare handgun from his bag. Banning edged himself closer to the cabin door, gun drawn. \"That explosion was minor, intended to frighten us and deter us from wandering around the train. If we stay here, they'll eventually find us, kill me, and more than likely make you a YouTube celebrity...again.\" \"Then let's go find them and take back this train,\" Ben said icily. The Scotsman grinned. \"Now you're talking! Stay close, sir. We had two agents guarding the compartment. With any luck, they're still alive. If not...just like old times, right?\" Ben wiped a bead of sweat from his brow. \"Yeah, old times.\" Ben followed the agent shakily out of their cabin, gun trembling in his hands. He skittered anxiously a few steps behind Banning, casting nervous glances backwards down the hallway every few seconds. \"Mr. President, you'll give yourself whiplash. Just focus on me, I've got it covered.\" This did little to the calm the jolt of fear running down his spine; Ben rubbed his neck as if physical touch could dispel the sensation. The train was eerily quiet, the flickering lights seeming to cast him in an unwelcome spotlight. Mike stopped abruptly and swore. \"Stark's missing from his post. I'd bet Rogers is, too. No blood, no signs of a struggle. These aren't amateurs. It's too quiet. Either the baddies locked all the passengers in their cabins or we're the only ones left on this train.\" Ben tried not to state the obvious but failed miserably. \"What now?\" Banning squared his shoulders and continued forward, keeping the Head of State in his line of sight. \"We stick to the plan. Make it to the front of the train. If we can't stop it, at least we can get the upper hand by gaining control.\" \"We?\" Ben asked uncertainly. He was sure he'd be stuffed in a closet again. \"I'm not leaving you unsupervised. Not here.\" \"How thoughtful,\" Ben grumbled as he followed Banning into the next compartment. The next four train cars held no immediate danger, and Banning felt compelled to enroll Ben in Secret Service Crash Course 101 between checking for hidden surveillance cameras and sweeping the hallways for terrorists. He had Ben memorize Morse code, the law enforcement phonetic alphabet, the secret to keeping his uniform and tie perfectly flat-ironed during a shootout, and, most importantly, how to make friends with agents from MI6 and Section 20. \"You know, for emergencies,\" Banning said with a shrug. \"And you don't think THIS is an emergency? Wait! I have Trumbull on speed dial! He'd be able to get us outta this mess!\" Ben said as he fished his own phone out of his pocket. As if in response, his cell phone vibrated with an incoming call. Number unknown. He took a deep breath and answered before Banning could stop him. \"Hello, Mr. President,\" a sultry voice purred as Ben put her on speakerphone. Banning swore and held his gun aloft as the disembodied voice continued. \"I hope your time here has been...explosive to say the least. You'll find that we are very gracious hosts.\" \"I'd say. You rented out an entire train just for me? I'm flattered. But maybe you should buy me dinner first,\" Ben replied. He sifted through the random pieces of discarded luggage littering the floor and found all of them empty. \"What did you do with the passengers?\" The woman chuckled. \"Oh, the actors? Safely evacuated. I admire you, President Asher. Perhaps we can work together. Turn yourself over to me, and we'll negotiate the release of your Scottish companion.\" \"I'm, uh, American!\" Banning interjected. Ben ignored him and gripped the phone tighter. \"The United States of America refuses to negotiate with terrorists. And I've had better chocolate mousse before. Asher out.\" He ended the call and exchanged glances with the agent. \"Do you think she'll...?\" \"Change her chocolate mousse recipe? Probably.\" \"No, I mean, do you think she'll just decide to kill us both and save herself the trouble?\" The explosion two compartments ahead of them was answer enough. Banning hurled Ben to the ground and kept a firm grip on the back of his charge's neck. \"Brace for impact, Mr. Pres-\" The explosion ripped through their compartment, busting out windows and scorching upholstery in its wake. Slivers of glass showered down like sugar rain, the larger shards tearing through skin like tissue paper. The sound was deafening; Ben couldn't tell if he was huddled in silence or screaming his lungs out. Even with the hungry flames and smoke, a small part of the Head of State thought there was a chance they could survive this because Banning was with him and he could survive anything...that is, until the compartment shifted to one side. The train groaned in protest, the floor becoming more and more angled; time seemed to slow down as Ben slid out from Banning's grasp. They were tipping. They were falling! They were about to derail. \"Brace for an untimely death, Mr. Pres-\" \"NOT HELPING!\" Ben snapped moments before the train lurched entirely off the tracks and sent them both flying into the opposite wall. A particularly large briefcase, albeit empty, smashed into the side of the President's head and a pink handbag punched his gut with so much force it drove the air from his lungs. Once the train skidded to a crunching stop, he raised his head numbly from between the piles of travel bags and unearthed the groaning agent. He tried to speak but he was still trying to fill his lungs with air. \"Yeah you sound like I feel,\" Banning grunted. \"Who...how...what...\" Ben wheezed as he crouched to help lift debris off the agent. This proved unnecessary as Banning knocked the luggage and debris away from him with a single punch. \"Who was that woman?\" \"A bitch.\" \"How did this happen?\" \"They rigged the train with explosives.\" \"What are we gonna do now?\" \"Payback!\" Ben rolled his eyes, still hacking. His head was throbbing, but Banning assured him it wasn't a concussion and to stop acting like a weenie. The President staggered away from the wreck, still disoriented when he heard it. Dirt bikers. Just like London. Coming closer. \"AW HELL NO!\" Ben bawled as his companion grabbed him by the cuff of his super studly leather jacket. \"Language, Mr. President,\" the agent chided. He took stock of their surroundings. \"Shit! They dumped us in the middle of nowhere! And by nowhere I mean facing northeast approximately five miles from the consulate!\" Ben's pounding headache made it hard to concentrate, but even he knew they were sitting ducks out in the open. \"Hey, what about over there?\" Banning indicated a bleak black ominous forest complete with dark rain clouds that looked like it belonged in a horror movie. \"We could find cover.\" \"AW HELL NO!\" Ben repeated, but Banning ignored him. \"Glad you agree, Mr. President. Let's go. Hope those shoes are-\" \"COMFY, yes, I pay attention to things, I actually did something right.\" \"I was gonna say waterproof,\" the Scotsman smirked as they both hauled ass across the plain.[Chapter 2] Banning lead them through the swampy terrain, pausing once or twice to inspect the compass built into his watch. They avoided the paths but the shrill whines of the dirt bike engines surrounded them at every turn. \"We're gonna have to steal their bikes,\" the agent proposed after unceremoniously dunking Ben's head under murky water as a drone flew past. Ben shook the disgusting grime from his hair and cringed at another squeal from the bikes. \"Thanks, Jason Bourne, but I think I'll stick with walking.\" \"You don't understand, Mr. President. Whoever derailed the train knows we made it out alive. And now they're trying to smoke us out...literally.\" He pointed into the skyline for emphasis. \"They set fire to the forest. The leaves curling upward...the birds flying north...\" \"I don't see ANY smoke or ANY fire! What I see are twenty dirt bikers with machine guns and God knows what else strapped across their backs!\" \"Sir, do you see any wildlife around here?\" \"I saw a frog in that disgusting swamp water-\" \"Me neither. It's the forest's way of warning us. We've got to get outta here fast. Hence the dirt bikes.\" The Scotsman hefted a large rock in his hand. \"I'll creep up next to one of the trails and knock someone off their bike, swap their clothes, steal their weapons, and meet you back here.\" Ben shifted in the swamp water, ignoring the squishy feeling from his soaked shoes. \"What about me, Mike?\" Banning tossed a large rock into his hands. \"I'm sure you can take out one by yourself. Try the rock first. Only shoot as a last resort. It's best if they don't hear any gunshots. Got it?\" Ben hesitated as he saw a slight tendril of smoke pool around his ankles. \"Let's go.\" Ben dropped the rock in disgust and stalked after Banning. He was a politician, not a pitcher or a...a hobbit! What kind of throwing accuracy did Mike think he had? Banning lifted an eyebrow. \"You said you'd do exactly as I said. Where's your rock?\" The President scoffed. \"I can't do this, you know I can't. Why don't you knock a dirt biker out with YOUR rock while they're speeding past and we share the bike!\" The agent's expression shocked Ben into silence. \"Share a bike? SHARE? Sir, I would die for you, but that's out of the question. Mr. President-\" \"Just call me Ben, I'm soaking wet and have glass in my hair-\" \"Mr. President, there! It looks like there's the answer to your prayers! You ready?\" Ben saw the large Humvee lumbering in their general direction. Banning let out a huge guffaw and grinned. \"Our ticket outta here, sir! Better than dirt bikes, eh?\" \"Yeah...but, uh...\" Ben's voice went bone dry despite the slight drizzle of rain beginning to fall. He swallowed hard. \"But what are we gonna do about that flamethrower?\" \"You mean the flamethrower attached to the Humvee manned by the hooded terrorist burning everything in his path?\" \"YEAH. That flamethrower.\" Banning shrugged and lobbed the rock at the unsuspecting man's face. The fire starter gave a cry and clutched his nose. \"Watch and learn, sir. In a moment he'll lose his balance and fall dramatically to the ground, allowing us time to take out the driver and make our merry way to the closest city.\" The assailant shook his head and returned to the flamethrower with purpose. \"You were saying?\" Ben said sarcastically. Banning raised his gun and fired a single shot. The soldier operating the flamethrower crumpled. \"See? We've probably spooked the driver. I bet he accidentally crashes the vehicle, killing himself in the process, leaving the car in pristine driving condition for our getaway.\" The driver did a quick donut and headed toward the duo, one hand on the wheel and another on the semi automatic aimed right at Ben's fluttering heart. \"Any other predictions, Mike? Like my impending DEATH?\" The Scotsman fired his gun just as the driver did the same. Banning's target slumped over the dash while a trembling President clasped the flesh wound on his arm. The agent ushered Ben to their newly obtained Humvee and immediately plopped himself at the helm of the flamethrower. \"I don't care how much you suck at driving, sir. I call dibs on this little puppy!\" The driver gave a groan and shifted in his seat. \"Jeezus! He's still alive?\" Ben surprised himself by sending a right hook straight at the man's covered face, dropping him back into unconsciousness, and shoved him to the forest floor. The squeals of dirt bikes neared their location, like a hive of buzzing bees. \"Gun it, sir!\" \"On it,\" Ben replied and hit the gas. Banning blasted two arrivals with the flamethrower before it overheated and he resorted to using his handgun. \"How did they even find us, Mike? How were they even able to pull this off?\" The Head of State made a hard left and ran one of the bikers into the side of a tree with a sickening crunch. \"It's all my fault, Mike. If I hadn't changed the plans-\" \"Ben,\" Banning interrupted sternly, gun poised at the ready. \"It's not your fault. The only ones who knew about the new itinerary were you, myself, Trumbull, and my security team, who are sworn to secrecy under pain of death. No one else knew. Those bastards must've hijacked all forms of transportation just in case-\" \"No,\" Ben said softly, his heart throbbing in sync with the aching wound on his arm. \"There was someone else who knew about the plans.\" \"Dang it, sir! I told you not to tell Spark Plug!\" \"I didn't tell Connor, okay? Think, Mike. There was a woman in the room with us after our run. The one who delivered the travel plans.\" \"The aide!\" \"She overheard it all. And if she's part of the terrorist cell and is still at the White House...\" \"Then we're f'd,\" Banning finished. Ben lost all sense of direction as he swerved around and sometimes on top of oncoming dirt bikers. He hadn't seen any oil rigs thus far, which was odd, he mused, as this country was supposedly a wealth of natural resources...and if this country was, in fact, wealthy, then where was the wealth? So far the only ornate thing he'd seen was the train and the dazzling array of weapons. Were these guys a separate militia? Or Libertalians themselves? \"MR. PRESIDENT GET YOUR HEAD OUT OF THE CLOUDS!\" Ben snapped back to attention and realized the bikers had fallen back (YAY!) into an organized and orchestrated group (NO!) \"What are they-\" he mumbled, then realization struck. \"They're corralling us somewhere!\" Ben jerked hard in the opposite direction, but was met with heavy gunfire that forced him back into his previous course. Banning swore and plopped into the passenger seat, gripping Ben's injured arm hard. \"Brace for impact, Mr. President.\" \"I'm so sick of that line! What-\" he heard it before he saw it. Water. Rushing roaring thundering murdering water. \"We're heading toward a waterfall,\" Ben stated simply, wondering if he was just this unlucky or straight up losing his mind. \"That we are, Mr. President.\" \"They're gonna force us to drive over a waterfall.\" \"Unless we just stop, sir, which I would strongly advise against.\" \"We'll be dead once we hit the water,\" Ben gasped. \"Oh God, Connor...\" The Humvee neared the gurgling edge of the free fall and he found that he couldn't breath. His chest constricted. His vision blurred. \"Mike. My son.\" A beat. \"YOUR daughter! It can't end this way. Connor already knows what it's like to lose one parent...Mike, I can't...\" \"We're gonna make it, Ben!\" Banning said. \"Get it together! Those bastards are gonna be looking for you from the bank, got it? If we get separated, make your way to the conference. It shouldn't be far away, just a few miles. Get help!\" Ben could feel the icy spray from the water. \"Don't let them take me! Mike! Whatever you do!\" \"I won't, buddy! I promise!\" With that, the vehicle burst from the top of the waterfall and began its dizzying descent into the churning foam below. Ben slammed his head into the dash, leaving a strategically attractive cut on his forehead. Distant sounds of gunfire, shouts and that damn waterfall roar echoed through his skull. He groggily woke up - woke up?! Had he blacked out? - to the insistent jarring of his injured arm. Banning, that prick, was grabbing his arm AGAIN and it HURT; in fact, his whole body HURT and he found himself thinking about Maggie and hoping she hadn't been in any pain because this freefalling business freaking HURT- \"BEN!\" He heard a roar from the passenger seat and hey! It was Mike! \"Hi Mike!\" he said enthusiastically, glad he had a buddy with him. His mind was all over the place and slow to put the pieces together. He sluggishly realized the two of them were upright, halfway submerged in the Humvee, and Banning was using his Bowie knife to cut through Ben's seat belt. So, he wasn't jostling his arm just for the heck of it. \"Ben? You with me?\" A hint of trepidation crept into Banning's usually stoic voice. \"We survived the fall. Got it? Now those terrorist maggots are going to come crawling down here any moment, so you've got to get going. Remember what I told you. Be smart. Analyze your surroundings. Get to the conference. Be a badass.\" Oh yeah. They had bad guys after them. Ben's seat belt came free with a ripping sound and he tumbled against his door. He crawled hastily through the broken windshield. \"That's the second time you've had to cut me out from a vehicle. Thanks, Mike.\" His initial shock dissipated, allowing the Head of State to think more clearly. He frowned when he didn't get an immediate response. \"Mike? Mike!\" The Scotsman was still in the vehicle. Banning fixed Ben with a death glare. \"Don't you dare, Ben. My leg's pinned down. I can't get out and those dirt bike freaks are going to reach me long before I drown. So I'll be fine but you have to GO!\" \"I can't just leave you behind!\" Ben objected. He attempted to clamor through the broken shards of the windshield to reach Banning, but the agent shoved him away. \"You can and you will! You have to survive, sir! Our country needs you! Connor NEEDS you!\" \"And Leah and the baby need you!\" The vehicle bobbed along the swirling eddies as the icy water reached Banning's waist. The president fought to stay upright on the smashed hood even as his vision threatened to fade to black. \"Take care of them, sir,\" came the resigned sigh. \"They won't break me. I'll buy you some time. And whatever you do, make sure Leah installs those bulletproof walls into the nursery!\" \"MIKE! WAIT!\" Ben shouted before the Humvee took another sickening lurch and forced him into its chilly depths. He resurfaced moments later as the Humvee tore away and continued downstream with his trapped companion in tow. \"Watch yourself out there, Mr. President...Ben.\" The Head of State tried to swim against the current to reach the sinking vehicle, but his efforts were futile. He managed to drag himself to the bank and take cover in the dense undergrowth. In the distance he could still smell smoke from the manmade fires. Going back was not an option. Hell, screw the conference, he thought as the terrorists cut the Scotsman from his Humvee prison, bound his arms, and threw him in the back of a truck even as he favored his injured leg. He was going after Banning. Ben crouched low, thankful for the ample vegetation, and followed the terrorists' vehicle with his sight until it disappeared from view. He could hear voices creeping closer, so he darted further into the foliage until they passed. The bad guys were thinning out; they probably thought he had taken off at a sprint towards the conference. This left the President with some time to mull over his plan of attack...which wasn't really a plan at all, much less an attack. Find Mike, rescue him, and high tail it back to the States. He despaired for a few minutes regarding directions and even tried to make a Boy Scout compass out of a paper clip and his shoelace, but he gave up after a few attempts and decided he didn't need Banning's GPS sense of direction to follow his path. Ben tried to marshal his thoughts together. Maybe speaking out loud would help? \"So I follow the river until it turns left at -\" he struggled to think up a name \"-Dark Knight Rock, then I'll go around...300 Hill, and finally make my way to-\" he squinted in the distance - \"Gods of Egypt Tree.\" Ben repeated these instructions to himself three times before he realized he sounded like Dora the Explorer. He blanched at the thought (this was serious business!) but now the damn names had rooted themselves firmly in his mind and he couldn't think of anything else. \"Fine, I guess I'll go to stupid Dark Knight rock first,\" Ben growled, but enjoyed being in motion with a purpose. He had somewhat of a destination. Weapons were another obstacle altogether. Dusk came quickly before Ben dragged himself, exhausted, to Dark Knight rock. The distance on foot had been longer than he expected, what with the hiding from random sentries and trying to keep his heart from bursting at every sound that reached his ears. But that wasn't the worst part. It was the terrifying memories triggered by the fall: that dark, snowy road, the horrific crash, the vehicle pitching into the water below, the moment of panic when he was pulled from Maggie's side. He swayed on his feet before collapsing to the ground, the twinkling stars his only companions in this godforsaken land. He tried not to think of that night. For the past few hours since Banning's abduction he'd suppressed that awful nightmare. He told himself that his situation was profoundly different—it was a waterfall, after all, and he was strapped in a flamethrower-equipped Humvee—but the old wound reopened and he felt Maggie's loss more than ever. He was so tired…He could rest for just a minute… \"Ben,\" a gentle voice said as an even gentler hand touched his face in concern. He put his hand over her own and smiled as the beautiful face came into view. \"Maggie,\" he said with a sob. She helped him into a sitting position against the rocky landmark. \"I'm hallucinating. Or dying. There was a train wreck. I hit my head when we drove over the waterfall. Maggie...is it really you?\" \"He's close, Ben,\" she said in reply. \"You can still save Mike.\" \"Honestly, I don't feel capable of saving anyone. Not Lynne, not Mike, not you...\" He trembled and his wife placed a comforting hand on his arm. \"It's my fault, Maggie. All of it. I changed the plans. If I hadn't been so weak, so afraid…And the aide. How could I miss that? How could I put my country in danger? How could I ignore the fact that Mike hadn't taken his full leave after his baby girl was born?\" \"This is NOT your fault, Ben. You need to understand that. Mike thinks the world of you, did you know that? He thinks you're a hero.\" \"No. He thinks I'm a coward. He told me to run away. He knew I'd fail. Mike knew he was going to die and I just let them take him!\" Ben ran his hands through his hair in defeat. \"Maybe I should just give up. It's not like he'd believe in me anyway.\" Maggie gave him a reassuring smile. \"Then why did he leave you his knife?\" The President slowly raised his head and locked eyes with Maggie. She gestured to a set of tire tracks next to the rock face. Half hidden in the foliage was Banning's Bowie knife, presumably thrown by the man himself before the terrorists knew he had it in his possession. Ben picked up the weapon and held it close to his chest. \"I'd say that Mike has more faith in you than you have in yourself.\" She kissed his forehead lightly then pulled away. \"Remember what I told you. None of this is your fault.\" \"Please, stay with me. I need you, Maggie-I've been lost without you. I can't do this alone.\" \"I'm always with you, Ben. But now Mike is the one who needs you. Bring him home.\" He reached a hand out to her even as the melodic voice faded on the wind. \"At least…at least tell me that you didn't suffer, at the end. I did everything I could to reach you! Please, I hope you weren't in pain. I couldn't live with myself if—\" Her bell-like laugher filled the air with warmth. \"It was like falling into a deep sleep. You've suffered far more than I have, Ben. You're a wonderful father and you've done a wonderful job raising our son. Forgive yourself. I love you.\" \"Maggie!\" He called for her again, but she was gone. The President was on his feet now, knife in hand, a newfound energy burning in his core. He could do this. Maggie believed in him. It was time for him to believe in himself. Banning's leg hurt. The resident medic - who might have been a witch doctor or just a sadistic sonofabitch - had chanted a few made up words and threw salt at the lacerations, which was the COMPLETE OPPOSITE of healing. He had managed to save face and not cry out once, even when the fire ants started to swarm. So tough and manly. He could handle anything...he hoped. He'd been sitting in solitary for half a day before two techies barged in and set up a small laptop and speaker amplifiers. Banning was forced to sit on the cold, hard ground, with his back against cold, hard cinder blocks and his hands zip-tied above his head around a cold, hard, metal railing. The irony of the situation wasn't lost on him. Only once had Ben confided in him about his experience in the bunker. Back then, Banning had told him smartly to be thankful he was alive and that he didn't get the tar beat out of him like poor Ruth. But now, after spending an eternity with his arms stretched above him and the ties digging into his wrists, he felt that he understood the President a little better and regretted his past remarks. The laptop screen flickered on, speakers crackling to life, and a FaceTime session opened up to reveal- \"Trumbull!\" Banning's heart sank the moment he noticed the Vice President was confined in a comfy armchair in the Oval Office and that the traitor aide witch was standing next to him. \"Comfortable, Mr. Banning? Oh, I'm sorry. Blowing up your train does make things rather personal between us. I'll just stick with Mike.\" Banning glared at the blonde bimbo while trying to assess Trumbull's condition. He seemed fine, even relaxed, given the circumstances. \"Yes, your precious Vice President is safe and sound, for the time being. One could argue he's been more of a President than your own Benjamin Asher.\" The agent tried not to rise to the bait and instead switched topics in an attempt to throw her off. \"Where's the President's son?\" \"Oh yes. Little Spark Plug. He's honestly been a bit of a brat. Single parenthood obviously doesn't agree with the leader of the free world.\" Banning smirked at her callous response. \"You're wasting your time. The President's long gone, probably sipping a Capri Sun poolside at the conference right about now.\" Trumbull let out a small grin. \"Now THAT is news worth being tied up for. You got our boy to safety, Banning?\" The aide laughed, smacking Spark Plug's framed picture to the floor, shattering it to pieces. \"He's lying. Ben's on his way to SAVE you, isn't he, Mike? I can see it in your face.\" Banning didn't see how that was possible as he was displaying his customary grimace. Trumbull's posture wilted slightly in his chair. \"I-that's not true! I told the President to listen to my instructions unconditionally. I ordered him to go to the conference!\" The aide sneered, resting her hip against the Presidential desk. \"Benjamin Asher is a coward. And I've made sure every obstacle he encounters reminds him of all his deepest fears and everything he's lost. Handing him his travel plans when he's at his most vulnerable. Advising Trumbull here to speak to the President personally about his inconvenient travel changes. Forcing him to drive directly over the waterfall. All he feels is guilt. Guilt that he couldn't save his precious wife. That he was the cause of the attack on London. That he had to leave you behind-\" \"HEY!\" Banning snarled, but she continued, undeterred, and spoke to the two techies still hanging around the room. \"Looks like our decision to pull back the troops was successful. Mr. Asher is graciously making his way to us. Alert me when he arrives. We need to have a little chat.\" Banning swore up and down at the blonde traitor even after her cronies ended the FaceTime session and left him alone in misery. Ben scaled the chain link fence, ignoring the barbed wire coiled across the top that shredded his leather jacket with ease. He dropped to the other side, unfazed, and kept the knife steady. The past hour or so was a blur of pure adrenaline. The sparse lights he'd seen in the distance radiating from this dilapidated, crumbling town were now above him in a string of battered lanterns. The trip from Dark Knight rock, 300 Hill and Gods of Egypt Tree to this sad development had been five miles, maybe more, but he didn't remember traversing the terrain. Tracks from the offending vehicle that had taken Banning hostage had led him here. He crouched low along a few stalls in the empty marketplace and scanned the buildings...THERE! One structure was newer than the others, with reinforced windows, steel plated walls, and the steady hum of electricity that the other sorry brick buildings lacked. A sentry walked past his hiding place, unaware of his presence. Ben didn't think twice. He grabbed the man and pulled him into the shadows, angling the knife at the man's unprotected throat. \"Where's Mike Banning?\" he demanded with a rough shake. Wow! He was pretty good at this macho, badass thing! The man sputtered and tried to wrestle his way out of his grip. He squared his shoulders and pressed the knife harder. The fire ants got bored with his broken leg around midnight, Banning guessed. While his leg radiated heat and pain, he could still feel those little shits crawling around and his heart skipped a beat when he realized what direction they were headed. He tried to squirm around in an attempt to shake them off, but to no avail. He let out another string of Scottish curses before resigning himself to his fate. Everything was his fault. He had taken an oath to protect Southpaw AND Spark Plug and failed. He had allowed that aide lady access to the President's exact movements and now he was trapped in some backwater country while Trumbull, the rest of the White House staff and Ben's son were at the mercy of the psycho's endgame. Whatever that was. Why the hell was she so obsessed with Ben? Ben slid the keycard into the door and it unlocked with a satisfying click. He kicked the door open-just because-and entered Banning's cell. The man was zip-tied and squirmed uncomfortably against the cinder blocks. \"THANK GOD! YOU'RE HERE! LEMME OUT! GET ME DOWN! NOW! NNNOOOOWWWWWW!\" \"Wow, and all those times you made fun of me for complaining about being tied up in that bunker,\" Ben scoffed, but he stepped forward with the Bowie knife and started to cut his comrade's hands free. Once the ties were severed, Banning brushed the ants off in a frenzy, expecting Ben to stand warily at the door, hand him back the Bowie knife, ask him what their next move would be, and drown himself in dark memories surrounding his own experience at the hands of Kang. \"Let's go, Mike. It was too easy for me to find you. I only saw one sentry outside and after I took him out, he just happened to be carrying the keycard to get inside the building.\" There was so much wrong with that sentence that Banning didn't even know where to start. \"You...took someone out? By yourself? With my knife?\" He decided to ponder that little mystery later. \"Wait, Ben—Mr. President! I have to tell you something. The aide, they had her on Facetime-\" \"Mike, not now,\" Ben chided. \"Can you walk?\" Any adrenaline he had while crushing the fire ants was gone and he leaned against the wall for support. \"Would it make you feel better if I said 'yes'?\" With that the agent's body gave out and he nearly crumpled to the floor. Ben caught him and hauled him upright, using one arm to support most of his weight. \"You know, Leah won't like the whole broken leg thing. That means you'll get even more time off. She'll be so sick of you by then.\" \"You know she can't resist my rugged charm. Besides, I'll just cut my vacation short again. I'm pretty sure protecting your sorry butt is way more important than a broken leg.\" The duo limped their way into the hallway and a sheen of sweat rolled down Banning's face from the effort. Ben pretended not to notice and used the keycard to swipe open another door. \"Well, if you do that, I guess I'll have to veto your 6th amendment right.\" The pair laughed before Banning's voice turned into a wheeze. The Head of State urged the man forward. The industrial lit hallways of the building echoed with Ben's frantic footsteps and Banning's groans of pain. Ben strained his ears and eyes for some other noise, some other person, some other SOMETHING, but there was nothing. This wasn't right. He gripped the knife tighter, as if the action would strengthen his resolve. The sinking feeling in the pit of his stomach made the Scotsman's rescue seem more and more like a - \"Trap? Very good, Benjamin.\" A disembodied voice circled around their heads and Ben nearly dropped the agent in surprise. \"Who's there?!\" he demanded while squashing Banning protectively in a dirty corner. Banning's woeful sobs of \"hey, that's MY job!\" went largely ignored. \"Oh, I'm not anywhere near you, Benjamin. In fact, I'm making myself quite at home in...well, YOUR home, to be exact.\" The sinking feeling became a black hole and Ben had to fight to keep his nerve. He needed to be strong. For Mike. For Maggie. For his son. And Stars and Stripes his arms were burning! Why hadn't any of Banning's training routines involved at least dragging a dummy around? He would have to save that lecture for later. \"I know you're thinking about your wife. About Spark Plug. About the bunker,\" the voice purred. Ben slammed his hand in the wall in frustration. \"Actually, I'm pretty pissed that none of you people know my son's REAL name!\" he cried. \"Even I'M starting to think I wrote 'Spark Plug' on the birth certificate!\" Banning coughed again then glanced up at Ben in disbelief. \"Uh, sir, I don't think this is the time-\" \"Don't, Mike. I got this.\" Ben replied, pulling the agent from the corner and helping him limp forward again. \"Don't you want to know what I want?\" The sultry voice was back, with a hint of a whine. So, she didn't like being ignored. And she was wrong. Ben grit his teeth. \"I was actually thinking of giving you everything you want, darling.\" The agent's eyes widened in horror but Ben pushed him roughly against the wall to drown out his objections. \"As long as you're in MY HOUSE and the house of my forefathers, you might as well know where everything is. I keep my toothpaste in the right hand drawer of my bathroom suite. The untampered Watergate transcripts are secured behind a portrait in the Blue room. Area 51 documents were recently shredded in my office. And the new Cerberus codes are encrypted on my computer under code word Enchilada! WE DONE?\" Silence. Ben hauled Banning a little more forcefully down the hallway. \"Sir, what-\" \"Misdirection. Hopefully that will keep her busy and away from-\" \"Spark Plug?\" \"CONNOR!\" They rounded a corner and Ben took out a baddie with a well-placed roundhouse kick. He gathered the weapons and slid a gun into Banning's hand. \"You take the Beretta. I'll take the AK-47.\" Banning glanced dumbfounded at the President. As if seeing him in a new light. \"How the hell do you know what kind of guns-\" Ben smirked. \"My son plays a lot of video games. He's played Uncharted every Christmas since we lost Maggie. And I sorta picked up on some stuff.\" \"Remind me to play this game sometime,\" Banning said as he gripped the Beretta with a shaky hand. \"And if it's two player, YOU can have the Beretta and I'LL take the AK-47.\" \"That's the spirit,\" Ben said as they continued their trek. The hallway opened up into a circular room with a large computer screen affixed to one wall. Ben was about to surge forward to the next door-the very door that would lead them outside, one step further away from the trap that had yet to spring-when his companion's body went slack and crumpled at the President's feet.[Chapter 3] \"Mike? MIKE! Stay with me! You've gotta stay awake! Come on!\" He slapped the man hard across the face and received a groan from the agent in response. His elation at seeing his friend coherent soon disappeared as the man fell unconscious in his arms, the Beretta dropping to the ground with a clatter. \"Jeezus, Mike! I'll find something to help you! Just hold on!\" He tore himself from Banning's side and shuffled through the items on one of the steel tables. Pictures. Hundreds upon hundreds of pictures. Him and Connor. Him and Mike running. Him giving a speech. He threw them aside, nearly tearing the handles off the drawers as he dug through their contents. More pictures. Him and Trumbull. Him and the actor Gerard Butler. He turned to another table, flinging the documents to the ground in frustration. Numerous newspaper clippings and interviews, all focused around his experience overseas. And the most recent article: a heavy hearted Trumbull describing what it was like to see the President at the hands of terrorists in London with that machete pressed against his throat, reciting the Presidential Oath as he prayed to God Connor would never have to witness the public execution of his father. The computer screen suddenly flashed to life and the petite blonde peered at him from her place at his desk in the Oval Office, the decorative flags tipped on their sides. \"What have I ever done to you?\" Ben snarled. He threw a crumpled wad of photos for added effect. The aide smiled sweetly. She clearly enjoyed having control of the situation again. \"You may not be aware of it now, but you will be. Soon.\" His confusion was evident. She laughed softly, cruelly, as she stooped over a shattered picture frame on the ground, pulled out the photo and held it before his eyes. Ben's jaw clenched. \"Look how young your son was back then. So happy. Do you remember when this was taken, Benjamin?\" Of course he did. Maggie had snapped the picture of him hugging Connor after the polls had announced he'd won the Presidency. \"So do I. Everyone wouldn't stop talking about how the 45th president would change things, make lives better. They were wrong. All you've brought to the world is pain and misery.\" A few hired thugs burst in from both doors, quickly rounding on Ben and for-the-first-time-in-forever-useless Banning. Ben's AK-47 and the Bowie knife in his possession were stripped from his grasp and he was captured in a chokehold. \"MIKE! WAKE UP! MIIIIKKEEEE! Get away from him!\" he shouted as Banning was dragged out the door they had previously thought would lead to freedom. Ben was rewarded with a few well-placed punches to his gut, the pain eerily reminiscent to his treatment at the hands of Kamran. No, he couldn't think like that. This was nothing like London. He could handle this. He could— \"You can't do anything, Benjamin. And that's your greatest weakness. You let others take the fall. You give up. In every crisis America has faced since your induction, who has her citizens turned to for aid? Certainly not you, embroiled in your political agendas.\" He surged towards the screen; pointless given his predicament. \"I've done NOTHING to deserve this! I was held against my will, trapped...I witnessed horrible things...my staff and I supported each other through the fallout, counseled each other through the shock-\" The blonde gripped the photo tightly, hands now shaking with rage, as she slowly tore it in half, the crease ripping through Ben's head. Much like the real life headache he was contending with now. \"You're right, Benjamin, of course. Always the victim.\" She began tearing the photo into quarters, this time severing the President's left hand, including the ring finger. He tried not to roll his eyes at the obvious symbolism. \"If you do anything to Trumbull, to Connor-\" This time the woman laughed, a humorless sound that made the hairs on the back of his neck stand on end. \"Oh, I have every intention of hurting those you love. That is, if you don't do as I say.\" Ben struggled against the hands that held him fast with a choked cry. She waggled a finger at him like she was scolding a disobedient child. \"You're unfit to lead, Benjamin. Weak. Pathetic. You talk about honor, about caring about all those nameless men and woman under your command that died trying to protect you! The innocents in London, the sacrificial crew that took the hit as the missile meant for Air Force One burned their aircraft from the inside out-\" \"I'm done feeling guilty for acts of terrorism that were out of my control,\" Ben snapped, receiving another punch for his effort. He pushed forward, undeterred. \"You think I've wronged my country somehow? My own people? I would give my life for them!\" The aide slammed her hands against the desktop with an audible SMACK. \"Then why couldn't you save the one life that really mattered?\" She flicked her wrist and one of the henchmen tied a gag around his head and started to drag him away from the computer screen, out the very same door that they'd taken Banning through earlier. She smiled as he fought against the men who restrained him. \"This is what I want, Benjamin.\" She affixed familiar earrings-MAGGIE'S earrings-to her earlobes, apparently happy to have his undivided attention. \"I want you to publicly resign and admit your guilt to the entire country.\" She gestured to the jewelry with a malicious grin. \"Do you like it? I found it on the bedside table next to your pillow. Your wife had such refined tastes!\" The President shouted profanities at the wicked woman from behind his gag. \"Oh, and Benjamin? Do enjoy your flight. I know how much you love airplanes. Maybe you can pretend Lynne is with you while you count the ways you've failed your precious citizens. Play nice, Benjamin. Or you'll never see your son again.\" His eyes widened but he was powerless to do anything other than growl before the next punch connected with his gut. \"And I don't mean that as a death threat,\" she continued, as if he wasn't being used as a giant punching bag. \"If you don't cooperate, I'll make sure Spark Plug simply disappears. You'll never know what happened to him. The price for relinquishing your presidency doesn't sound so bad, now, does it?\" Ben managed to spit out the gag and yelled the first thing that came to mind - \"HIS NAME IS CONNOR!\"- before the material was yanked roughly around his mouth again with renewed vigor. The aide smirked and addressed the thugs. \"Gentlemen, escort our guest to the plane so he might reflect in solitude.\" The burly men shuffled toward the door, Ben in tow, before the woman commanded them to stop. \"On second thought, throw Banning in with Benjamin. He'll be near useless with that leg and we can always kill him if our dear President steps out of line.\" The President was shoved harshly out of the door as the computer screen faded to black. He was surprised to see the first inklings of a sunrise make its way across the sky. Not that long ago, he'd been boarding the train...the hell train. The derailed from hell train. And now he was going to board a plane. A hell plane. But at least this meant he was getting closer to Connor. The walk to the hell plane was a short one, and Ben was too worried about his son to do any analysis about the aircraft. Banning would be disappointed. Banning would've sucked it up and known the exact age, model, fuselage and VIN and probably taken out all the baddies singlehandedly while piloting the plane if their positions had been reversed. But Ben being Ben had to contend with being dragged across the tarmac, manhandled up the stair ramp and thrown into a plushy seat. His hands were zip-tied tightly to each of the armrests. They didn't even bother restraining Banning when the Scotsman was brought in five minutes later and dumped unceremoniously on the floor, unconscious and his leg still bloodied. Ben's gag remained tighter than ever and he could only let out a muffled cry of relief at seeing his friend before Punching Thug sent another fist into his stomach. The thugs locked Ben and Banning inside their cabin then took their seats in first class where they were showing an action movie starring Aaron Eckhart and Gerard Butler along with all the amenities: heated seats, unlimited food and drink – even a chocolate fountain! The plane rumbled to life and began its ascent. The President was too preoccupied with testing his restraints to think about his fear of flying. He took advantage of their privacy, away from the henchmen's prying eyes, and rubbed his face against his shoulder for the good part of an hour until his gag fell away and hung loosely around his neck. \"Mike! MIKE!\" No response. The Scotsman snored loudly. He tried to pull his hands free for the umpteenth time, but the zip-ties held fast. He was really starting to hate those things. Ben closed his eyes, remembering the agent's Secret Service Crash Course 101 during his stint on the train. Most of it was useless. What did Banning always say? Be aware? Like THAT was gonna help him get off this flying hunk of metal. He lowered his head to his chest, brushing his chin against the pin affixed to his shirt. Of course! His American flag pin! Now that his jacket was all but destroyed, he had easy access to the tiny embellishment. For several agonizing minutes he used his teeth to pry at the pin until it came loose. With his mini tool, he slashed at the zip-tie holding his right hand hostage until it came free with a snap. He quickly began to saw away at the zip-tie on his left hand. Banning FINALLY began to stir. \"About time, Mike!\" Ben knelt down and helped the agent sit up, propping his back against an adjacent seat. The agent coughed then opened his eyes blearily. Ben sent a nervous glance toward the cabin door before addressing Banning again in a harsh whisper. \"Mike, any ideas? Tell me what to do.\" The Scotsman winced as he clutched his leg and looked around. He sighed. \"Mr. President-\" \"I almost swallowed my flag pin twice trying to get free, so please, it's just Ben-\" \"Mr. President, I won't be much use. For one, their medic skills are crap, my leg is not secure and I could lapse unconscious again at any minute.\" Ben rolled his eyes, clasping the man on the shoulder. \"Okay, drama queen, but that's not what I asked. Looks like it's my turn to save your sorry ass for once.\" Banning swore and tried and failed to push himself off the floor. Ben shoved him firmly back down and started taking catalogue of the equipment at their disposal in the overhead compartments. So far, nothing. \"No, Mr. President. You won't do ANYTHING. First, there are-\" \"Five armed guards, including both pilots.\" \"-too many dirt bags for you to handle alone. I'm ordering you to follow their orders from now on. Do everything they say until our protective detail can get you to safety.\" Ben slammed the compartments shut with unnecessary force, turning to rifle through a few corner bins. \"I'm not giving up, Mike.\" \"It's not giving up. It's called stalling, just until-\" \"Until WHAT, Mike? Until I publicly resign from office? Until this psycho decides she no longer needs Connor as a bargaining chip?\" Ben hadn't realized his voice had been rising until he stopped to take a breath and heard the rattle of a key turning to open the compartment door. He raised his fists. If there was one thing he learned from his presidency, it was how to box. \"Sir, a fist won't be any good against a GUN,\" Banning hissed. \"Sit down!\" The President shook his head. \"No. I'm done being manipulated. And I'm done being the victim. If I get you into the cockpit, can you fly this thing?\" Banning groaned. \"Maybe if I'd gotten a look at the exact age, model, fuselage and VIN-but it's not gonna happen! Mr. President, STOP!\" \"Too late,\" Ben smirked as the door burst open and the entering guard received a crushing right hook to the face. He kicked the figure, ensuring complete loss of consciousness, before taking the terrorist's Glock and barreling headfirst into a second assailant. Ben crumbled from a blow to his ribs, but recovered with a beautiful uppercut that cracked his attacker's nose with an audible crunch. He risked a glance out the window. Soon the fields would yield to a sprawling city and decorated monuments, leading right to the White House's front door. Ben lunged toward the third assailant, Punching Thug, and smashed the barrel of the Glock into his temple. Punch swayed, but remained standing, and swung at Ben, who only narrowly avoided the impact. One of the pilots exited the cockpit and circled the President menacingly before sending a roundhouse kick to his hand. Ben grunted in pain as he released the gun and watched in horror as it skittered across the floor. Punch and Copilot grinned as they inched closer, effectively closing off his escape and corralling Ben into a corner. \"Mike! MIKE!\" he called out automatically, but received no answer. If the agent had blacked out again then he was truly on his own. And scared. Connor... Punch withdrew a wicked looking knife from a sheath attached to his belt and waggled it tauntingly. Ben tried one last time to press an advantage, but Copilot easily caught him and slammed him hard against the interior wall. The side of his head scraped against an overhead compartment, but that was nothing compared to the blinding heat from Punch's knife. He grimaced as blood seeped from a straight incision that extended from his left collarbone to shoulder. Copilot prevented him from moving as Punch prepared for another attack. \"MIKE, GET YOUR ASS OVER HERE AND HELP ME!\" Punch suddenly stiffened and clutched his neck before crumpling to the floor, his hands bright with blood. Banning withdrew the American flag pin from the beefy man's neck, stabbed him three more times, then collapsed, exhausted, into a reclining chair. He sipped a bit of champagne then propped up his wounded leg. \"Was that REALLY necessary?\" Ben demanded. Banning shrugged. \"No.\" The Copilot fumed at the two of them for being ignored like an unwanted third wheel. \"HEY! You may have gotten past the others, but you won't get past-\" Ben elbow striked the terrorist across the temple then slammed his head into an armrest, pausing only to drop the unresponsive body on the floor. The President picked up the Glock and squared his shoulders. \"Only one left. The pilot. I say that we force him to make contact with the aide and start negotiations.\" The plane arched into a glorified swan dive and threw the duo across the aircraft. \"MR. PRESIDENT, PREPARE FOR A CRASH LANDING!\" \"I CAN SEE THAT, MIKE!\" But this time Ben wasn't on Air Force One. He wasn't in London. And he sure as hell wasn't going to sit around while the plane took a nosedive. Ben stumbled across the floor, flailing into chairs and walls as he fought to maintain his balance. He hauled himself to the corner bins he had investigated earlier, successfully pulling out two parachute vests. He somehow made his way back to Banning without falling and began to fasten and secure the clips around the agent. His head and chest wounds throbbed in protest, but he worked earnestly until they were both suited up. \"Ready, Mike?\" Ben yelled, using nearly all of his strength to open the plane's emergency hatch, providing enough room for them to jump out one at a time. Wind whipped around him and stole the breath from his lungs. Thankfully Banning got the hint and lurched forward unsteadily until he was standing behind Ben. \"Mr. President! Keep your eyes on me. Release the cord when you see my parachute go up!\" Ben nodded; he hadn't been able to hear Mike, but he got the gist. Mike had done this before. He would know when to pull the shoot. Another lurch almost sucked Ben out of the hatch and he suddenly remembered to be terrified. This was insane, this couldn't be happening! He unconsciously shuffled backwards, but Banning's tree trunk arm grabbed him fiercely and tossed him into the open air. He did two somersaults and a complete aerial twist before his body righted itself. Tears blurred his vision as he careened head first toward the ground. He reached for his chute with a trembling hand. Banning smashed into him and swatted his hand away. \"NOT YET!\" Ben couldn't hear him through the sound of the wind rushing past his ears. \"WHAT?\" He reached for the chute again and received a punch to the face. Fine then! He'd just wait until Banning prompted him into activating the release. The Head of State tried to remain calm and take in the view even as the world reached up to greet him at dizzying speeds. The plane veered in the opposite direction, toward an empty park, and self-destructed in midair. Shrapnel flew in all directions and he buried his head in his hands to protect his face. By the time he worked up the nerve to open his eyes, the ground was CLOSE. TOO CLOSE. LIFE FLASHING BEFORE HIS EYES CLOSE! \"MIKE! When do I pull the chute?\" He completed a one eighty degree turn and saw the agent spinning haphazardly through the air, his body limp and unmoving. Banning had blacked out?! No, this could not be happening! \"MIKE! MIKKKEEEE!\" He cursed and back flipped to the Scotsman's side, pulling the cord with fumbling fingers. Banning's chute opened and he slipped out of Ben's grasp. The President then reached for his own chute and tried to think of happy thoughts. Like not becoming a human pancake on the White House front steps. The descent to Earth and corresponding landing were worse than Ben could've imagined. Banning, being heavier and unconscious, reached the ground first - thankfully his parachute got tangled up in an ancient tree in some ragamuffin park, so no serious injuries were had. Ben didn't know how to slow himself down without the aid of a convenient tree, so he tried to fake run in the air like they tell you to do when zip lining, which only made him lose his balance and spin around backwards. When his feet DID hit the ground, it was jarring and his knees took the brunt of the impact. Ben rolled a few feet before gathering his senses and shakily unbuckling himself from the restraints. He couldn't do much for Banning in the tree; he was too far up and relatively safe. Ben had more pressing matters, like not freaking out that he had just jumped out of a plane and, oh yeah, saving his son. He recognized a few road signs and realized he was only a couple blocks from the White House. His home. He sighed. He had no cell phone or money and couldn't risk being recognized as the aide might have assumed him and Banning died in the plane explosion. Right, then. Time to whip out that four minute mile. Ben sprinted through the off beaten paths that Banning usually dragged him through during their grueling morning workout. Normally he'd have complained about taking so many detours, but he sent the Scotsman a silent plea of thanks. Out of prying eyes, in and out of back alleyways and abandoned parking lots, he was able to maneuver his way to the White House lawn without attracting any unwanted attention. He glanced at his watch with a sigh. Four minutes, ten seconds. The agent would certainly cringe at the number, despite the fact that the President had just survived a train derailment, a waterfall crash, and an emergency parachute jump with a dozen traumatic moments in-between. He ducked behind a trimmed bush in the shape of a llama and peered around the corner as two agents from his detail patrolled the front steps, talking animatedly. Ben had to keep from fisting his hands through his disheveled hair in shock. Agents Stark and Rogers! But...they'd been with him on the train guarding his compartment! Had they really betrayed him in favor of that traitor aide? His fears were confirmed when the aide descended the stairs between the conversing agents, a bowl of ice cream held aloft in one of her bejeweled hands. The fine china was from Maggie's personal collection, the one he'd refrained from using since that horrible day. And that was Connor's ice cream, dammit! He crawled to a vacant spot near the gate, knowing full well that the llama head provided the perfect blind spot from any cameras. He opened a hidden latch and descended into a crumbling tunnel that fed into the crawl ways between the various rooms and staircases. During the rebuilding process after Kang's reign of terror, he had the tunnels added with reinforced safety measures. He'd ordered the creation of two secret entrances to the tunnels and allowed only Connor, Trumbull and Banning to know of their existence. He came across the steel door entrance, pressed the ten-digit combination and completed the accompanying full body X-ray scan. Screw eye or fingerprint data. If the sensor didn't find a match with his exact body X-ray AND beating heart, the door wouldn't open. Take that Kang, he thought as the door yielded entry. Ben took a sharp right and followed the mental map in his head. \"Hang in there, Connor. I'm coming to get you,\" he said, making a beeline for his son's room. The tunnel rose sharply above street level then further upward where the presidential suite and guest rooms were located. A newfound sense of pride for his son washed over Ben as he slowly traversed his way through the thin space between the walls. He already felt like this creepy ass passageway was sucking out his soul, but Connor had managed to hide out like this for hours. A spider crawled over his hand as he walked through a spider web that stretched across the length of either wall. Ben bit back a scream, flailing his arms as much as he dared while pulling off silken strands...then the spider disappeared. \"Aw hell no!\" Ben snapped, then stilled in horror. How much had his voice traveled? After an anxious five minutes of waiting (and searching and failing to find that damn spider), he continued his trek until he reached his son's room. His heart stopped when he heard voices. Connor wasn't alone! He pressed his ear against the wall with bated breath. If that blonde bimbo had sent someone to harm the most important person in his life, he'd be breaking more than just the Golden Rule. \"Don't worry, champ. I'm sure he'll be back any day now,\" a familiar voice said soothingly. He heard Connor sigh, a hopeless, pitiful sound. \"I hope you're right. I've been texting and calling him over and over but I haven't heard anything from him since the train. She told me that the train derailed and caused a fire. Do you think he's...?\" Ben's heart lurched and a raw streak of anger consumed him. The aide had told Connor about the train? She'd made him believe that his dad could be dead? \"Of course not, Connor. Mike's with him and he wouldn't let anything bad happen.\" Ben finally placed the voice. Trumbull! He pushed the panel aside with such force that he knocked over the lamp sitting on the bedside table. \"Connor? Connor!\" Ben called out. His son and Trumbull continued to have an animated conversation, thanks to the recorder on Connor's bedside table. Ben didn't even flinch when some guards busted down the bedroom door and grasped him firmly by each arm. He was marched out of the room and ushered down a set of spiral stairs. He knew exactly where he was going. He could make his way to the Oval Office with his eyes closed, in part because he was there everyday but mostly because Banning had forced him to memorize the steps between each room of the White House while blindfolded. He peeked around the burly men holding him in place, noticing the halls were eerily empty. The witch had probably stuffed his entire staff in the bunker and cut off communication. \"So glad you could join us. The plane crash was a little surprising, but then, I knew the first thing you'd do was find your son. It was easy to set the trap after that,\" the aide purred as she exited the Oval Office from the rich oak door and closed it halfway behind her, obscuring his view of the room. Her lackeys held him firmly in place as she sauntered toward him and patted the dainty necklace hanging limply from the throat he wanted to strangle. Maggie's necklace. She was doing this to rattle him, to break him harder than any of Kamran's punches. He stiffened his shoulders in defiance. No! He had to stay focused. \"So, that plane ride didn't exactly go the way you planned, did it? You didn't expect me to try and escape. You didn't expect the plane to explode-\" \"Actually,\" she crowed, \"You did me a favor. A few more loose ends I don't have to tidy up, what with the crew being dead.\" She gripped Ben's face despite his protest and tilted it from side to side in inspection. The woman flattened the unruly parts of his hair until she was satisfied with the results. Then she gestured at the torn state of his jacket. \"Oh, this just won't do. We need to have you looking the part.\" The aide snapped her fingers and the traitorous Agent Stark brought her a finely pressed GQ jacket before returning to his post on the front lawn. Ben's jacket, complete with the ornamental flag pin. \"You have what you want! You have me! Just let the others go!\" The muzzle of a gun was pushed against the back of his head by one of the thugs holding him in place. The blonde laughed cruelly before giving a curt nod and allowing the guards to release their grip on the President's arms. She pressed the jacket into his hands. \"Put it on. We have a little family reunion to get to and a public resignation to film.\" Ben hurled the jacket back in her face. \"I'm not doing anything until I see my son.\" The aide regarded him coldly, folding the jacket with precision. \"You're not in charge. I am. And I say you won't see your son until you follow my orders.\" An eerie silence blanketed the conversation as the President mulled over her words. \"It would seem we are at an impasse, then. Show me Connor.\" The blonde's jaw twitched in agitation. \"No. I hold all the cards here. You will follow my instructions-\" \"The United States doesn't negotiate with terrorists.\" The blonde shoved Ben roughly against a wall, the force reopening his knife wound. She bent close to his ear, whispering, \"You pull one more little stunt and Spark Plug-\" the aide didn't have the chance to continue as Ben whipped out the hidden flag pin he'd taken from the GQ jacket and scraped her across the face. The wound wasn't deep, but it was distracting enough for Ben to head butt her to the ground while she screamed. He rushed the two guards who had been holding him captive. He felled the first one easily with a punch to the face. He slammed his elbow into the second guard's lower back before swiping his legs out from under him. His badass montage complete, Ben sprinted toward the Oval Office and flung the door open. \"CONNOR!\" \"DAD!\" the boy answered, voice cracking, as he squirmed tirelessly against the bonds confining him to a chair beside Trumbull. The President heard commotion coming from the hallway, a sure sign that the blonde devil and her accomplices were recovering from their epic beat down. He knelt beside his son, giving his shoulder an encouraging squeeze, before swiping a letter opener from the top right drawer of the large desk and attempting to free Connor. \"Work fast, Ben,\" Trumbull said from his place of confinement in the plush armchair. \"Almost there, buddy. It's gonna be just fine. Just keep looking at me, okay? We'll be outta here before you know it.\" Connor nodded in reply as one of his hands came free. \"Stop what you're doing or I'll be forced to make you. Tell me, Ben, do you really want your son to lose another parent?\" the aide sneered. Ben slowly turned to face her lithe form blocking the doorway, gun aimed at his heart. He raised his hands in surrender and stepped in front of Connor lest she unleash her fury on him instead.[Chapter 4] \"You have some sort of twisted plan for me, don't you? I know that you want me to relinquish my presidency, but what's next? My public execution?\" The blonde smiled devilishly and brushed her fingertips against the streak of red that marred her otherwise perfect face. \"Don't get me wrong, Benjamin. You deserve to die. But not before you pay for what you did.\" \"My dad's a HERO!\" Connor snapped, gaining a nod of approval from the Vice President. \"They're even putting his face on the new two dollar bill,\" Trumbull added with his hypnotic, soothing voice. \"Just saying.\" \"HE'S A MURDERER!\" came her venomous retort. She fired a bullet and it missed the President's shoulder by mere inches. \"If it weren't for him, Lynne would still be here! You killed her! You took her life then fled from the scene like the coward you really are!\" Ben flinched despite himself. Lynne. He could still remember sitting across from her before the crash, briefly giving her hand a comforting squeeze before their world spiraled into smoke and fire. He could still hear Banning order him out of the battered plane, still felt the sharp pang of regret as he stumbled from the wreckage, unable to say a proper goodbye. \"What has any of this have to do with Lynne?\" Trumbull asked, his rich baritone voice attempting to calm the situation. \"It has everything to do with Lynne!\" the aide replied, now shaking with unbridled anger. She released another bullet and it sailed past Trumbull's chair, grazing the sleeve of his jacket, and embedded into the wall behind him. \"DON'T YOU DARE TARGET HIM!\" Ben snarled, taking a step towards the aide while continuing to block her view of Connor. \"You're obviously upset with me, so let's talk! Don't involve them!\" She smiled cruelly, once again aiming the gun at his chest while twisting his wife's necklace between spider-like fingers with her free hand. \"I don't want you to simply TALK. First, I want you to apologize.\" \"My Dad doesn't need to apologize for anything!\" \"Quiet, Connor.\" Ben knew he should be focusing on the gun, but his eyes couldn't stop lingering on those fingers defiling Maggie's necklace...her earrings. This woman was scarier than Kang and Kamran combined and he wasn't sure how far he could push her before she snapped. \"I'm not apologizing for something that wasn't-\" \"An apology, Benjamin.\" \"The attack on London was planned YEARS in advance-\" \"No.\" \"We had no warning-\" \"No.\" \"Our pilots did everything possible to evade-\" \"No. No. No! You seriously find yourself blameless, even when you made the decision to go to the Prime Minister's funeral in the first place!\" Ben's throat tightened. \"I-\" \"Against the advice of your top agent, Vice President and Secret Service Director—which was Lynne—you decided to go to London. You even made an official announcement.\" Ben shot her a cutting glare. \"That decision was not made lightly. We had to consider our country's allies, weigh the political advantages.\" The aide acted like she hadn't heard him and directed her thugs to grab him again. He struggled to fight them, but the burly men were prepared this time and dragged him away effortlessly, tearing the letter opener from his hands. His son's screams hit him as hard as any physical blow as he was taken to the front of the room, forced into his GQ jacket and zip-tied to his own presidential chair behind the Oval Office desk. He grimaced as she tossed her gun to one of the henchman and pulled a small video camera from her dainty handbag. \"Make sure that our guests are comfortable,\" the blonde instructed and Ben could only watch helplessly as Trumbull and Connor were gagged and threatened into silence. \"Why? Why go through all this trouble to punish me for Lynne's death? You could've used slander, could've defaced my name in any number of ways!\" \"This isn't about putting a black mark on your family name,\" she chuckled, clearly reveling in the power she wielded over the Head of State's confined form. \"I wanted you to crumble under your own self doubt, cringe at your own worthlessness. At your failure at being a parent. At your inability to protect those around you. So I gathered a secret army, bribed the right people, helped myself to the U.S. Treasury funds, and created a ploy to lure you directly to me. There is no Libertalia. Never was.\" Ben clenched his fists in desperation. \"I'll do whatever you say. Just let Connor go,\" Ben pleaded. The blonde continued her poetic rant with a smile. \"Lynne was the closest thing I had to a sister-a FAMILY. And then my whole life was ripped away. Can you imagine the pain I felt knowing how you let Lynne DIE while your mutt, Mike Banning, spared your life over hers? I wonder if Maggie thought the same thing.\" \"Do you really think that's what happened? That Mike chose to save me over Lynne?\" Ben lifted his head regally, intending to face her brutality with at least some semblance of pride. \"There was nothing we could do.\" \"LIAR!\" \"Her injury was too severe. All of us loved her like a sister! Mike even asked her to be the godmother for his child. If you want to blame someone, blame the terrorists that shot the plane!\" Something struck him across the back of the head and almost pitched him into unconsciousness. That dastardly woman lifted his limp head and smirked at the streak of red trailing down his neck. He tried to blink the world back into focus. \"No one should be able to see that little injury from the front. Let this be a lesson to you, Benjamin. Next time you talk back to me, I'll take my frustrations out on someone else.\" He followed her gaze to the two captives bound tightly in their chairs. The aide sighed and walked back around to the front of the desk. \"You're going to apologize for what you did to Lynne. And THEN,\" she smiled cruelly, \"you're going to officially resign.\" He strained futilely against his bonds while she set up the video camera, but smartly kept his mouth shut and shot Connor a look. He was trying to convey a sense of calm, that everything was going to be all right, pleading with his son to not draw attention to himself. Ben cleared his throat dismally, not seeing any other options. Best to abide by her rules now and get out alive. He could deal with the fallout afterward. \"My name is Ben Asher, forty fifth President of the-\" The traitor aide slammed her fist down hard on the table. \"No! Not yet! I haven't pressed record!\" His jaw clenched. This was absurd. \"Well, get ON with it woman-\" He stopped abruptly as Connor shook his head minutely from side to side. The action was plain - STALL. For what, Ben didn't know, but he hoped his son had some sort of plan because he sure as hell didn't. \"Wait.\" Ben said desperately. She shot him a scowl of impatience. \"Please...I can't concentrate while you're wearing my wife's jewelry. You'll have to take the necklace and earrings off. If not for me, then for my son.\" The fingers twirled around the necklace once again as her face lit up with another cruel smile. She left the camera unattended to circle around the table and watch the President grimace at her approach. He forced himself not to glance in Connor's direction to see the younger Asher's reaction. Instead he had to stifle a grunt of pain as the aide pressed her hand against the knot on the back of his head. \"You know I can't do that, Benjamin. I want you in absolute misery. Does it hurt? Seeing the jewelry you've kept locked away in the closet, untouched, sitting in that pink and gold music box engraved with her name?\" Ben had to stop himself from screaming. Connor. Think of him. He had a plan. He had to keep her talking. The President let out a shaky breath. \"You went through Maggie's things. Her private things.\" The blonde shrugged. \"I had a lot of downtime while my men secured the premises. I went through boxes and boxes. That can't be healthy, hoarding those memories away like that. Do you know how I coped with losing my best friend? I destroyed everything that reminded me of her. And it's how you'll cope from now on, too.\" Ben gaped at her in shock. His body trembled under her villainous gaze. \"No. NO! You didn't! You couldn't!\" \"I had the boxes burned an hour ago. Now that I think about it, I really should've let Spark Plug watch.\" She turned on her heel and returned to her spot next to the camera. Ben was breathing so fast he could barely concentrate on the card she held blotted with red ink. \"Read the lines word for word.\" He felt like he was hyperventilating. Yes, the horrible accident that claimed his wife's life happened years ago, but he still wasn't up to going through her things. Her memories. After London he had thought he could...maybe...but then he was invited to Libertalia, which had given him another excuse to avoid her possessions. His blood boiled. Now he would never get that chance. \"Benjamin, read the lines,\" she prodded impatiently while he tried to focus on his breathing. He was shaking almost uncontrollably from his anger, his vision blurred by rage and tears and that damn cowardly hit to the back of his head. \"Benjamin. Read. The. Lines.\" At his continued silence, she stalked over to one of her henchmen, grabbed her handgun, and trained it on the President's forehead. \"C'mon, Benjamin. I'm done playing games. Read.\" \"I-\" \"NOW! Apologize!\" \"Maggie, I'm so, so sorry-\" \"Not to her!\" \"Connor, I love you-\" \"STOP!\" A loud crashing sound and a strong gust of wind surrounded Ben. He closed his eyes and attempted to tilt his head away from flying shards of jagged glass as the window exploded behind him. The blonde shrieked but Ben couldn't tell the source of her terror until he opened his eyes carefully against the onslaught of chaos. Unbelievably, incredibly, it was Banning! \"Mike!\" he called happily. \"Good to see you again, sir. Did you break that four minute mile?\" Banning asked as he cracked the side of the closest thug's skull with his elbow. The agent then ducked behind the desk and emptied his clip into the second thug. The aide swiveled to face this newest threat and brought the gun level to Banning's chest. \"I was wondering when your Scottish lapdog would show up, Benjamin.\" \"For the last time, the man's not Scottish!\" Ben hissed. Banning brought up his own gun in retaliation. \"I picked this little beauty off one of your men outside. Next time you see him, tell him thanks for me. He's the one impaled on the wrought iron fence.\" The blonde bimbo suddenly started laughing, a hollow, chilling sound. \"I still have control! I still have the President at my mercy!\" As if to support her statement she allowed the barrel of her gun to drift to Ben's struggling form. \"Shift three, get your goddamn hands in the air! It's over!\" Banning spat. Ben raised an eyebrow questioningly. \"Don't you mean 'hashtag'?\" \"Whatever! Just do it, you hag!\" The poisoned smile never left her ruby lips as she gave a mocking curtsy. \"As you wish,\" the aide said as she squeezed the trigger. Ben's side erupted in white hot pain. His attacker sauntered toward him as if to relish her victory, but the President retaliated with an epic head butt that sent a stream of blood dripping down the blonde's flawless nose. He heard a dull roar that might've been from his pounding head, his own strangled gasps or Banning's furious tackle as he sent the aide slamming into the floor. His side burned and blood flowed freely from the wound. Without his hands he was powerless to do anything but sit in anguish although he didn't know if providing pressure would alleviate the pain or make it worse. At least it would make him feel more productive and not like he was bleeding out on his favorite chair. Dammit, his favorite chair! What hadn't that woman ruined? The agent was at his side in a moment, cutting away the tight zip-ties and inspecting his wound. Ben yelped at the contact, trying to slap Banning's hands away, but the Scotsman shrugged off his weak attempts. \"Wound's clean, sir. Bullet went right through.\" \"Right through? You mean, right through my favorite chair?!\" His head felt foggy. \"Connor okay?\" \"Yeah, he's still tied up, but the kiddo's just fine.\" \"YOU DIDN'T RELEASE HIM?\" the President growled angrily, but his voice sounded weak and tired. Banning scoffed, pressing Ben's hand to his side and forcing him to exert pressure. The pain intensified because of course it would; why he expected anything different was laughable. \"I'll get to Spark Plug and Trumbull in a minute. Gotta make sure my star player is stable. Hashtag ninja medic skills!\" Banning sprayed some Neosporin and slapped a bandage from out of nowhere over the gunshot wound and Ben howled in annoyance. He needed to think about something else, anything else... \"How did you even GET here, Mike? You blacked out after we jumped from that plane-thanks for that, you prick-\" Connor's eyes widened because DAMN his badass dad jumped out of a plane for him!- \"then you got hung up in that tree and I had to just leave you there!\" Ben sucked in a gasping breath, pain spiking as he inhaled and Banning turned to free the other two, kicking the aide's unconscious body on his way. \"Oh, that? Well, when I woke up, I tore off some tree branches with my bare hands, used some abandoned kite rope to fashion a split, stole a motorbike from two guys and a kid riding to Vegas, overpowered the small army guarding this place using only my knife and my wits, then hauled ass through this huge window until I saved the day!\" Ben groaned. \"Not one of your tall tales. I mean, for real.\" Connor came free from his binds and tore off his gag. He bounded to Ben's side and pressed his small hands over his father's wound. Mike winked as he helped Trumbull. \"Who says I'm lying?\" The Vice President steadied the Head of State as Ben attempted to stand and his legs buckled from the effort. \"Easy, Mr. President. I think you've done enough heroics for one day,\" he chided with that comforting, honeyed voice. Ben sighed. \"I don't think I did anything, Allan. If anyone deserves the praise, it's Mike.\" \"That's not true, Dad!\" Connor interjected. Banning nodded. \"Spark Plug's right. I wouldn't even be here right now, saving your sorry ass, if you hadn't saved mine first. Besides, do you know of any other father who would break into their own White House to rescue their kid? I sure as hell don't.\" Ben tousled his son's dark hair as he took another feeble step. \"Yeah, well, that's just part of being a parent. I'm sure you'd do the same for your little girl.\" The agent scrubbed a hand over his face with a groan. \"If anyone even so much as LOOKS at my little princess the wrong way, I'm pulling out the AK-47!\" Banning declared. Ben chuckled, even though the movement sent waves of pain coursing through his chest. \"And I'll be right there with the Beretta.\"[Chapter 5] \"Stay sharp, Mr. President. We only have two more miles until we reach our destination. Do you copy?\" \"Hell yeah. Sure you can keep up, old man?\" Ben taunted as he checked his watch. Still on pace. His side still twinged a little but it was better than the weeks of mandatory bed rest. He couldn't wait to start boxing again. Whereas before he'd considered his vigorous training a smothering, necessary evil, now he understood. It was a part of his life, his presidency; just like his heartache, scars and kidnappings...his friends, freedom and beautiful son. He wouldn't have it any other way...but Banning might, he wondered wryly, as the agent triple checked the alleyway for danger and twice checked the President's pulse even though he was obviously breathing. Ben sighed, but it was a sound of defeated contentment. \"Okay, sir. Just have to cut through the park. One...two...\" \"RACE YOU!\" Ben roared as he surged forward. Although Banning knew perfectly well the Head of State wouldn't make it too far ahead of him, he still spat out a few Scottish curses before catching up. The duo entered the White House engaged in good-natured banter. Banning limped slightly, but otherwise his manly status enabled him a full recovery from the broken leg and fire ant attack. \"Besides, Ben,\" Banning continued as he followed the President into the East Garden Room, \"we can always view the video surveillance, but I promise that I made it back to the White House first! I clocked my last mile at three minutes, fifty seconds.\" \"I beat you fair and square, Mike. I told you not to throw a fit once I surpassed you.\" The head agent and his charge flopped onto the couch, resting their feet on the decorative coffee table. Trumbull entered soon after and tossed two water bottles in their direction with a warm smile. Ben passed his drink to Banning without question as the man unscrewed the top, sampled the contents, and handed it back to him with a nod of approval. \"So, how'd your morning run go in the park? I see you made it back to the White House in one piece,\" the Vice President said. \"And did our very own President Asher beat Agent Banning and steal his coveted personal record?\" Ben and Trumbull laughed at Banning's flushed face. \"That's it! We're checking the cameras! Don't expect any sympathy from me tomorrow!\" Banning scowled in response. Ben waved the words aside with a grin. \"Didn't Allan tell you? After today you are-officially-on vacation. EXTENDED vacation. Three full months. And you will spend every waking moment of that time off the premises with Leah and the baby. Well, except when the three of us go mackerel fishing.\" Banning nearly choked on his water in protest. \"But-!\" \"Ben and I have already booked the cabin and bought you your very own fishing pole,\" Trumbull added proudly. He still had a score to settle with those fish, after all. \"Four full days of catching fish and kicking back beers,\" Ben added to sweeten the deal. The Scotsman jumped to his feet, still unconvinced. \"But-!\" \"If you even attempt to return to work before your leave is up, I gave my security detail specific instructions to throw you in the back of the armored truck and drive you home.\" \"BUT-!\" \"And you won't have to worry about me while you're off. I won't be traveling out of the country anytime soon. At least, not until you get back. Then we've got an Air Force One flight to Paris. And...what else, Allan? A midnight drive to a conference in Italy and a short train ride back to the hotel.\" \"Affirmative, Mr. President,\" Trumbull acknowledged with his beautiful voice. Ben stood and put a hand on Banning's stiffened shoulder. \"Be with your family, Mike. I promise that I won't do anything rash without your approval. Besides, tomorrow is Maggie's birthday and I have something special planned with my son. And I'd rather you not be around to count the bowls of ice cream we go through before the day is over.\" Ben saw the agent crack a smile and raise his hands in surrender. \"Okay, okay. I can tell when I'm not needed,\" he said jokingly. \"All right, Ben, you win. But I'm still gonna check that camera before I leave. AND expect me to catch more fish than both of you combined!\" Ben shrugged, ignoring the faint twinge in his side. \"Trust me, Mike. I'm counting on it.\" The fort. It was Connor's idea. They \"snuck\" around the White House, giggling and swapping lame jokes, until all available couch and chair cushions in the near vicinity were confiscated. Then they piled them haphazardly in the East Garden Room, propping them up on their sides in semblance of miniature walls before stealing clean bed linens from the laundry and layering them across the cushions like a misshapen roof. Their protective detail was ever present by the door, but inside their fort the outside world didn't matter. It was simply a father and his son and some damn good chocolate chip ice cream. Ben refused to turn his wife's birthday into a dismal affair. He'd spent the whole day playing Uncharted with Connor, making fun of their favorite movies and totally schooling his son in trivia. It was 2:00am and instead of feeling sleep deprived after a long day, their energy was contagious. Ben shoved his empty ice cream bowl outside the fort and winked at his son. \"I've got a surprise for you. Something of your mother's.\" Connor's eyes flashed with emotion and he scooted closer to his father. Ben dug out a small metal box he had hidden between some pillows. It had ugly scorch marks marring the outside but was otherwise intact. \"This was one of the only things boxed up that survived the...the fire.\" He opened the lid and dumped the contents carefully on the floor between them. \"Most of this you've never even seen. Before, I couldn't bring myself to look...to even think about...it-it was selfish of me. I'm sorry, buddy.\" \"Dad, no, it's not your fault.\" Connor said gently. Ben threaded his fingers through his hair and nodded. \"Maybe not. But even though some of her possessions were taken from us, we still have her in our memories. Her love in our hearts. And, apparently, this weird little Thunderbirds bobblehead doll.\" Ben picked up the little trinket in his hand, eyes crinkling with mirth, when Connor's fingers ghosted over a faded picture. \"Dad, what's this?\" Ben eyed the small photo and smiled. \"Our first date. Did I never tell you? Well, it was a Thursday afternoon and...\" Their voices trailed off into the night, interspersed with fits of laughter, until secret service agents checked in on them the next morning, sound asleep and at peace inside their own private sanctuary. ","Summary":" Banning sprinted across the tarmac with the President in tow. He kept a secure grip on his superior"},{"Movie":"Olympus Has Fallen","Title":"Everything Changed","Author":"JanaeSpecter14","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12305625","Passage":"[Chapter 1] TWO YEARS LATER July 4 th , 2015 Mike paced in front of the Oval Office where he knew Ben was doing his work. Mike knew this was probably going to be the most awkward conversation he was going to have with the president. Including the conversation where Ben told him he knew about Mike and April's secret relationship. It had to happen, though. He couldn't go on any longer without asking this question. With a deep breath, Mike steadied himself in front of the door before knocking. \"Come in!\" Ben called, that just made Mike's palms get sweaty. Mike took another deep breath before opening up the door. Ben's eyes drifted up as he saw Mike close the door behind him. Once he saw it was just Mike, his eyes went back down to the paperwork. \"Is it time already?\" \"I'm early.\" Mike clarified. Ben nodded, barely hearing him as he was tied up in his work. \"Sir,\" Mike moved forward, but Ben was still looking down. \"I actually came early because I wanted to talk to you about something.\" \"Can it wait?\" Ben spoke, not really looking up at him while giving him a half laugh. \"The ball is tonight and I really need to get this stuff done before then.\" \"I'm afraid to make it wait.\" Mike mumbled, Ben not hearing from being so focused on his work. Mike knew he had to go ahead and ask or else he would lose all the courage he finally built up. \"I want to ask April to marry me.\" Ben immediately stopped working, taking a moment before looking up at Mike who was giving him a shy smile. \"And I would very much appreciate your permission, sir.\" Ben was almost frozen, just looking up at Mike. Sure, he knew this day would come, but he didn't know it would creep up on him like this. He loved Mike. He loved April. He knew they loved each other. Although, April was his little girl no matter how old she got. It was going to be hard to accept it. Speaking of the devil, the doors to the Oval Office flung open, April standing there with a clipboard in one hand and her hand up in the other. \"What are you two doing? We have an event to get to and we're behind schedule.\" She motioned to the door dramatically. \"Let's go.\" Ben stood up, looking at her like he would never be able to look at her again. His little girl was about to get engaged. And then married. Mike was looking at her like she was the most beautiful woman on the world. He loved the look of her in her new job. Secret Service, Head of Planning and Logistics. April was beginning to find their stares creepy. \"Why are you two looking at me like that?\" \"No reason.\" Ben said while shaking his head. \"We just love you, that's all.\" April looked down at herself. She wasn't wearing anything out of the normal for her work day, her hair was tied up in a bun, she had the normal amount of makeup on her face. She didn't understand what was so great about her in that moment to make them look at her like that. \"Am I dying?\" \"What?!\" Ben and Mike both asked at the same time, both with the equal amount of confusion on their faces. \"Well,\" April almost screamed out, throwing her hand in the air again. \"You're both looking at me like I'm dying and I don't know about it!\" \"Nothing's wrong with you.\" Ben spoke as he moved forward, placing his hands on her shoulders to look her over. April's eyebrows furrowed, not understanding why he was being like this. April began to shake her head \"You're creeping me out.\" Ben rolled his eyes at his daughter before turning to look at Mike. \"Let's just go before she gets more theories.\" \"Agreed.\" Mike scoffed out before walking ahead of the president, April standing there for a few moments. \"Okay,\" She called, finally deciding to follow them. \"But you two were definitely talking about me.\" \"God, April,\" Mike spoke, turning around to look at her. \"It's not all about you.\" April gave him a dramatic eye roll he had to laugh at as she hurried behind Ben. Ben just continued to watch the two interact. This was what a soulmate was. They teased and talked with each other so naturally, it was actually kind of threatening. They were perfect for each other. So why did he feel so weird about the two getting married? He didn't have time to think about that at the moment. A party was going on in his backyard and he had to mingle. He walked around to every guest, personally greeting all of them, April trying to do the same, but she had a lot more excuses to excuse herself now. And Mike was good and gauging when he should intervene. April was now tapping her foot, talking with Senator Baxter. She wanted out, and Mike knew it. He walked up to the two, putting a hand on her back before going to her ear, talking just loud enough so the Senator could hear. \"Miss. Asher, we're having a problem with the outer gate.\" She looked to the Senator, giving him an apologetic smile. \"I'm sorry Senator Baxter, but I do have to take care of this.\" He gave her a knowing nod before turning around to find someone else to bore. As they began to walk away, April turned to look at Mike. \"What took you so long? I was literally dying of boredom.\" \"Eh,\" Mike spoke with a shrug. \"I guess you were learning the importance of the Red River rights.\" \"God,\" April spoke through a laugh and an eye roll. \"I don't want to ever hear that name ever again.\" Mike guided her out the back of the yard and to the outer part of the gate. The entire road behind the house was blocked off for the party with security on the other ends of the road. So, essentially, they were all alone. As alone as you could get in the White House. April found her hand easily intertwining with Mike's as she pulled off her heels and the two began to watch, enjoying being on the outside of the party. \"What do you think of the party?\" Mike asked, actually not really caring about the answer, but wanting to see her pretty face. \"It's okay, I guess.\" She looked down in thought. \"It's distracting me from what tomorrow is.\" \"Hey,\" Mike whispered while stopping her to stand right in front of her by the gate covered with bushes, blocking the whole party from seeing them. \"Don't think about that.\" April scoffed. \"Are you kidding me? It was two years ago, there's still some areas of the White House that are under construction. You know, like the area a helicopter crashed through.\" \"Oh,\" Mike scoffed with a nod. \"Trust me, I remember that part quite vividly.\" April's face began to get serious while looking into his eyes. \"I have to be here every day and every time I turn a corner, I remember what it was like to see halls covered in dead bodies of the people I knew.\" \"You don't think I think about that too?\" April thought his sentence over. \"Why do you have to pick the worst ways to arrange your sentences?\" \"You think it's cute.\" He told her with a nod. She smiled at the fact that he had caught her. \"Okay, maybe.\" Mike smiled at her while leaning in to kiss her. \"Maybe I think it's really annoying and I just want you to think I think it's cute.\" \"Oh.\" Mike whispered, only a few inches away from her lips. \"Who's the bad one now?\" He leaned forward, taking a soft kiss from her lips, April's eyes still closed when they pulled away. \"Yeah, well I've been living with you too long. You've rubbed off on me.\" \"Yeah.\" Mike laughed out before stealing another kiss. \"That's it.\" When he pulled away, he looked down at her. She was giving him such a loving stare; Mike knew there was no wavering on his choice. He wanted to marry her. He couldn't picture his life any other way. She gave him a deep, relaxing sigh. \"I love you.\" \"I love you.\" Mike got a smile on face, a thought occurring that would sound almost better than \"I love you\". \"What do you say after this, we get burgers and beers?\" \"Burgers and wine .\" She spoke excitedly, Mike faking his excitement as well. \"I'm feeling fancy tonight. Besides, Megan gave me that really awesome wine bottle for my birthday that haven't drank yet.\" \"Alright,\" Mike chuckled out before looking back over at the hedges. \"Let's get back before they think we eloped.\" April rolled her eyes before turning around and taking Mike's hand again. \"Do you think I can get away with what I accomplished four years ago by making the ball a million times better?\" \"April,\" Mike spoke while shaking his hand. \"You're head of Planning and Logistics. You can kind of change what you want?\" \"But it's more fun to sneak around.\" Mike rolled his eyes at her, but continued to grip her hand, not being able to wait to put a ring on her left hand's fourth finger. Ben sat around as the place was getting cleaned up. He was still thinking about that bomb Mike dropped on him. He knew he did it tonight for the fear of losing his courage by the time he proposed, but did he really have to ask him right before the ball and have him thinking about it all night? \"Dad!\" He heard April call out. \"We're about to leave!\" Ben immediately stood up, knowing he had to give Mike his answer before he left. \"Coming!\" Ben called. Ben hurried to the front hall where he saw Mike helping April into her coat. He couldn't explain it, but that's when he made his decision. Mike was so careful and attentive as he placed the coat on top of her shoulders once she got her arms through. He pat her on the shoulders leading to her to turn around and look up at him. On his daughter's face, he saw nothing but love. On Mike's face too. And he knew they were destined to get married and raise a family together. He could practically see it now, and that was enough. April turned around to look at her father before leaning forward and giving him a big hug. Ben hugged her tight, having a melancholy feeling about it all. He was happy for his daughter, but also sad she was growing up, but also immensely proud. When Ben pulled away, he studied his daughter, April giving him another confused face at his look. \"I love you.\" \"I love you too, Dad.\" She laughed out before patting him on the shoulders. Mike walked forward, Ben pulling him into a hug. \"I give you my permission.\" Ben whispered low enough so April wouldn't hear. Mike smiled as he pat his back, getting ready to release him. \"Thank you, sir.\" When they finally let go of each other, April looked back and forth at them. She had no idea why those two were acting so strange and it had been happening all night. She wasn't going to question it tonight. She was exhausted, but if this continued into tomorrow, she would definitely have an interrogation with one of them. April sat across Megan as she brought out the Tupperware bowls she had brought. \"Mike made pasta the other night.\" She told her excitedly as she scooted the bowl towards her. \"He's Irish, why is he good so good at making pasta?\" \"Scottish.\" April corrected. \"Same thing.\" Megan spoke, already shoving a forkful into her mouth as April rolled her eyes at her friend, remembering when she was like that with Mike. \"Did he go in today?\" \"Yeah.\" April whispered as she began to push her food around in the dish. \"Hey,\" Megan spoke, moving her hand to grab April's. \"I know this day is rough on you, so if you want to go back home, I understand.\" April opened her mouth, about to speak when a door slammed behind them, but it sounded too much like a gunshot to her. She let out a scream as Megan began to stand up to the men who were wheeling in a patient from an ambulance. The majority of the men were medical assistants with both Megan and April. So, Megan decided to take action. \"What's wrong with you, Chandler? We got a PTSD victim on her trigger day!\" \"Sorry, Asher!\" He called out over his shoulder. \"Don't worry about it, Rabin!\" Megan turned back to her friend, giving her a smile as April tried to calm her pounding heart. \"Do you miss the hospital yet?\" April gave out a loud fake laugh, making Megan smile more. \"Are you two going to do anything for your anniversary tonight?\" April looked up, confused at her question. \"It's just the two-year mark.\" April spoke with a shrug. \"At the most we'll have dinner.\" Megan suddenly became panicked at her answer. If only she knew what was happening tonight. \"I mean you guys have been living together for two years without any problems, do you ever think about marriage?\" April stopped mid bite to look at her friend, trying to measure if she was serious or not. She was. April finished swallowing before looking back at Megan. \"I mean…sure.\" \"You don't sound too enthusiastic.\" Megan was really starting to panic now. April thought a bit on how to answer this before putting her thoughts into words. \"Yes, I would love to be married to Mike someday , just not today.\" Okay, she was panicking. \"I just started up my career, I don't really have time for all of that.\" Megan was trying to take deep, calming breaths. \"And what if we're one of those couples that is really good just dating, but married we're a mess and we end up getting a divorce in three months?\" \"Yeah, I guess I can see that.\" Megan thought about how she was going to change her mind on this topic by tonight. \"Don't you want children?\" April began to laugh as she put down her fork to look at her best friend. \"Why are you so obsessed with this topic today?\" Megan shrugged, finding her panic rising. \"Hypothetically.\" \"Sure,\" April spoke while throwing her hands in the air. \"But not,\" \"Right now.\" They both finished at the same time, April with an eye roll. \"Okay, Miss. Curious,\" April spoke as she grabbed her purse. \"I should let you get back to work.\" Megan looked back to the hospital with a deep sigh before looking back to her friend. \"I don't want to go back. Take me with you.\" April gave her a tight smile before grabbing her Tupperware. \"Become emotionally compromised and maybe I will.\" April left with a wave, Megan watching her until she was far enough away to pull out her cell phone and dial Mike's number in a panic. She bounced with anxiety as it rang until he finally picked up. \"Hello?\" \"Mike!\" She screamed, making Mike jump from the shock. \"Fuck.\" He cursed. \"I'm right here, Megan.\" \"We may have a subtle problem.\" Mike moved away a little from the decorator, becoming panicked. \"Is April okay?\" \"She's fine, but she might not say yes.\" Mike looked around, not wanting anyone around to know what was happening. \"What did you do?\" \" I didn't do anything.\" Megan spoke, offended. \"I simply asked her if she wanted to get married and she was like 'no, not right now. I have my career to focus on.'\" Megan made sure to get her voice high pitch to mimic April's voice. \"She doesn't talk like that.\" Mike criticized. \"Yeah,\" Megan spoke, wanting to get back at him. \"And it looks like you're not getting engaged tonight.\" Mike turned around to look at how romantic the restaurant had become and how elegant the private room was for the engagement party directly after. How could she say no to all of this? \"Yeah, well, we'll see about that.\" When April got back home, she walked straight into her bedroom, wanting to just take a nap, and let this day be over with. When she shut the door to her room, she saw something on their bed. When she walked toward it, she realized it was a red dress with a low cut and low sleeves that would go just under her shoulders. She began to pick it up, not understanding where it came from. \"What the hell?\" That's when she noticed the note next to the dress. She picked it up and began to read it, just leaving her with a location and time. The place they were supposed to have their first date three and a half years ago. \"What have you got planned, Banning?\" She pulled the dress to her chest with a deep sigh, looking up in thought. Maybe all of what Megan was talking about today wouldn't be so bad right now. Maybe she would love it. She then looked to the clock. Shit, she had to start getting ready. When April's limo pulled up to the restaurant, Mike was waiting outside for her. She began to smile as the car parked and Mike moved to it, opening her door and helping her out. \"You are so ridiculous.\" She spoke as she moved her hand to hold his. \"I think I'm romantic.\" April rolled her eyes at him as they walked into the restaurant. April immediately tried to go to the hostess, but Mike kept walking. Her eyebrows furrowed at the feeling of him going the other way. \"Are we not going to eat?\" She almost laughed out, but she mostly brought it up because she was hungry. \"Not there.\" He spoke obviously. As they walked through the restaurant, different members of the staff would walk by and give her an excited smile. Sure, she was famous, but not everyone would recognize her like they were doing now. April looked up at Mike, his smile was unchanging, and it was starting to drive her crazy. Something was happening, she just didn't know what the hell it was. April moved closer to Mike, putting her hand on his arm as they walked before leaning into his ear. \"What are you up to?\" \"You'll see.\" Mike was talking to her like she was an impatient child, and that was making April angrier than not knowing what the hell was going on. They finally walked to the back of the restaurant. It was closed off with a private room shut next to it, and no one would be able to see them. That's what Mike wanted. April looked around as she took her seat, not quite sure what was going on. \"Did you bring me here to kill me?\" April joked as she picked up the menu. Mike laughed as he finally got comfortable in the seat across from her. \"Don't you think if I wanted to do that I would have done it already?\" \"I don't know.\" April whispered, her eyes finally drifting up from the menu. \"Maybe you were waiting for the perfect time.\" Mike opened his mouth, about to counter what she said before their waitress came up and placed a bottle of wine on the table. April's eyes widened at the label. \"No.\" She spoke, grabbing the bottle of wine by the neck. \"We didn't order this, and I would never order such an exp – \" \"It's already paid for.\" The waitress interrupted her. April looked at Mike, and then the bottle of wine again. She knew for a fact if Mike was going to spend that kind of money on alcohol, it would have been bourbon. She then turned back to the waitress, her eyes still wide. \"By who?\" She got an excited smile on her face, almost bouncing before telling her. \"The President of the United States.\" April pursed her lips together before looking back to the bottle. \"Yeah, that sounds about right.\" \"You two enjoy.\" The waitress spoke before leaving. \"Wait,\" April spoke, trying to get her attention, but she just kept walking. She looked to Mike in confusion. \"We haven't even ordered.\" \"Don't worry about that.\" Mike spoke as he got up, beginning to unscrew the bottle. \"'Don't worry'\" April repeated in confusion. \"We're at a restaurant, and I'm starving.\" Mike looked to her, sighing about how difficult she was making this. \"We'll eat soon, don't get your panties in a twist.\" April let out an angry sigh before leaning back into her seat again, and crossing her arms with a huff. She then looked to Mike who was struggling with the bottle of wine. \"Do you need some help with that?\" \"No.\" He told her quickly. \"I can get a bottle of wine open.\" April sighed while throwing her hands up in defense. \"I just thought you would like to know that you're turning the screw to the right when you should be turning it to the left.\" Mike stopped what he was doing, looking to her, realizing she was right. \"You know, righty tighty, lefty loosey.\" Mike took a deep sigh before turning it to the left now. He was almost shaking, making April laugh out. \"Baby,\" Mike looked up to her, looking like he was breathing really hard. \"Why are you so nervous?\" \"I just,\" He backed away from the wine bottle before taking another deep breath. \"I just want tonight to go perfect.\" \"Perfectly.\" She corrected while shaking her head. Mike looked at her, about to get angry. She began to laugh while standing up. She stopped right in front of him, putting her arms around his neck as his moved to her waist. \"No matter what we do, no matter what seems to go wrong, any night with you is a perfect night.\" Mike gave her a little smile, knowing this really was the perfect night to do this. \"I will open the wine.\" She whispered before moving back to the table and taking the cork screw in her hands. Mike took a deep sigh, knowing the second she got that bottle open, she would see the ring. She twisted and then pulled, the \"pop\" taking up the room. She sighed happily at the fact that she got it open before picking it up, about to pour Mike a glass, but something stopped her. Mike got a huge smile on his face. April was just frozen, looking down at the ring. Mike walked forward, helping her pour the glass, only pouring just enough so the ring could fall out. April just couldn't take her eyes off the ring as he reached in his glass and shook off some of the wine before rubbing the ring with a napkin. \"It's called a Claddagh ring.\" He continued to look at it as he wiped it. \"It's very common in Celtic cultures.\" April just kept looking down at the ring. \"Mike.\" She gasped. \"Let me get this out.\" He asked her, finally making eye contact. \"I practiced this a lot.\" April gulped before nodding, looking back to the ring. \"So, there's a lot of different legends surrounding the ring, but my favorite, and possibly the most accurate, has to be about a British soldier.\" April began to feel her eyes water. He loved that one because it was the most like them. She hadn't even heard the story yet, but she knew that was going to be his reason. \"It's about a man who left his small town to fight in a war, and he promised his love that they were going to get married when he returns. Well, his ship was captured, and he was taken as a prisoner. He was specifically assigned to be the slave of a goldsmith. So, when William III rose to power, he commanded all British prisoners be released.\" April bit her lip, feeling the first tear fall down her cheek as Mike moved closer to her so she could get a better look at the ring. \"But before he left, her crafted her this ring as a symbol of their love.\" April sniffled before looking back up at his eyes once she got a good look at the ring. All Mike could do was continue to smile at her. \"And that story is my favorite because it reminds me of us. No matter what happened, we found a way back to each other. Two years ago, we found a way back to each other even if it wasn't the best circumstance. If we're going to be real honest, I'm actually grateful for the attack on the White House because we probably wouldn't be here now if it didn't happen.\" April let out a tearful laugh before trying to wipe away her tears. \"So, April,\" Mike started again before getting down on one knee right in front of April, gripping her hands so tight with one hand, and holding the ring with his other. \"Will you marry me?\" All April could do was look at him. She was so thankful to be blessed with an amazing, compassionate, funny when he wanted to be, asshole most of the time, but had a sweet spot you couldn't miss type of man. \"April,\" Mike spoke again. \"Your silence is kind of freaking me out.\" \"Yes.\" April almost cried out before putting out her left hand. \"I'm sorry. Yes, I want to marry you.\" Mike slowly placed the ring on her finger, making sure the crown on the top of the heart was closest to her. \"This means that you're engaged.\" He explained. \"When we get married, you're going to have to – \" April pulled him up so he would be able to look at her. She shook her head at him once he was standing in front of her. \"I don't care right now, kiss me.\" He did as she said, pulling her in for a huge kiss. April really couldn't believe she was here right now. She told Megan earlier that she didn't want to get married or have kids right now, but the second she realized what was going on, she knew that was all she wanted. And Mike, his nerves were finally the lowest they had been all week. As they kissed, everyone began to open the private door right next to the table they were at. Ben, Conner and Megan were each sticking their head out of the door with big smiles on their faces. \"Hey,\" Megan spoke, causing April to jump away from shock, but Mike just smiled while putting his arm around her waist. \"Just letting you know that whenever you two are done there, there's an awesome engagement party going on in here.\" \"It is pretty awesome.\" Conner spoke with a nod. \"And we have food in here.\" Ben added. April looked to the three of them, shaking her head with a tight smile on her lips. She couldn't believe that he did this. That Mike actually managed to pull all of this off. She grabbed Mike's hand, shaking her head at him before pulling him forward. \"You're in trouble.\" She spoke in a mocking tone. \"Am I?\" Mike asked with a little laugh. April couldn't help the smile as she looked at him. Sure, he was in trouble, but there was no way she could stay mad at him for too long. \"For the rest of our lives.\" And when they walked into the private room, she was greeted with a room of friends and family that they could properly celebrate their engagement with. Mike did good. Ben knew that. April knew that. Hell, everyone knew that. And soon, the two would be getting married. Everyone in that room knew that no two people deserved each other more than Mike Banning and April Asher. I'm gonna answer some reviews from the last chapter of Everything New. stormrunner74: Hahaha same. I would be a fumbling mess. I think she handled it a lot better than I would have. Mrs. HappyAnarchy: Yes! Secret Service April is going to be my favorite to write. I love writing her bad ass side! Kagome309: Aw yes! The wedding will probably be at the end of this story, but you got the proposal! Igor Blonsky: At least she kept her sense of humor lol. And who can resist strawberry? CoolCat020: I'm glad I made you laugh! That was my favorite part! micky mouse 17: Yeah, I'm just putting this story in the \"Olympus Has Fallen\" category because there is no \"London Has Fallen\" MisfitCarter: Thank you so much! That was one of the best reviews I've ever gotten. I hope you like this chapter! Okay, so I'm currently working on this fanfic and my Star Trek fanfic, so the updates are probably going to be kind of slow until I get to the end of that fanfic. I want to apologize for that. What did you guys think about the proposal! I hope you loved it! Also, make sure to check out my Star Trek fanfic if you're into that. Remember to review! I'm so happy to be back, and I hope you are too![Chapter 2] April woke up in her warm bed, feeling so refreshed. She actually woke up before Mike, believe it or not. She turned to look at her now fiancé letting out soft snores, making her smile. She then looked to her ring. She couldn't believe it. Just yesterday she was talking with Megan about how much she didn't want to get married, and now, here she was, engaged to be married. As she laid there, she thought about their whole lives in front of them. Soon, they would be married, and then they would be expecting their first kid. April was smoothing back the hair on the top of his head while she thought about it. There was just one problem in her fantasy. What were they going to do about their jobs? They both had dangerous jobs. Well, Mike's was more dangerous than hers, but just because she was the president's daughter didn't mean her obligations were any different. If anything was threatening the president's life, and she could do something about it, she had to do it. So, what would happen if they both went to work, and one of them didn't come back. Or worse, both of them didn't come back. \"Hey,\" April moved her head to Mike's at the sound of his husky, tired voice, giving him a little smile even if she was freaking out. \"Hey.\" She spoke back. Mike stretched his back a little bit before looking back to her. \"How long have you been up?\" April shook her head like it was no big deal, but inside she was wondering how long she would be able to hide how freaked out she was getting. \"Just a few minutes.\" He gave her a little kiss on the top of her head as she took a huge breath. She was hoping he would be able to mistake it as a loving sigh. Mike picked up on that, though. \"Hey,\" He squeezed her shoulders, with his arm draped around her. \"Are you okay?\" April looked back to him, giving him a bigger smile than how she was feeling on the inside. \"No. Nothing. Why would anything be wrong?\" Mike remembered what she had told Megan yesterday about how she felt about marriage. And now, he was worried that all of those feelings were still in there. He didn't want her to regret this. If she didn't want to get married, they didn't have to. He would rather be unmarried their whole lives and have her rather than the two get married, and April resent him for it. \"Are you sure?\" April moved up to him, making sure to place her left hand on his cheek so he would be able to see her ring before planting a long, passionate kiss on his lips. As the kiss continued, they kept pulling each other in for more. That's when April's phone began ringing, and Mike was on top of her. \"Ignore it.\" He told her through breaks for air. \"What if it's work?\" She didn't want to answer it either, but not answering a phone call gave her anxiety. No matter how convincing Mike thought he could be, he still knew her. She would never not answer a phone. Even the \"1-800\" numbers. \"They'll call back.\" For the first time, April thought she was actually going to leave a phone unanswered since Mike's tongue was moving expertly this morning. But it just kept ringing! With an angry sigh, she pushed Mike off of her before rolling to her nightstand, and seeing it was Megan. With another angry sigh, she sat up in her bed, holding a sheet to her chest. \"This better be good.\" Megan raised her eyebrows as she picked up a banana from the hospital cafeteria. \"Why? Someone have a morning wood?\" Mike was moving to her, kissing her neck and nibbling on it. April was almost moaning. \"Maybe.\" \"Oh my god.\" Megan sighed out while closing her eyes. \"I was just joking, I didn't know that was actually happening.\" Mike slowly moved down, running his finger along her panties. \"If it's important, make it quick.\" She sang out. \"Okay,\" Megan spoke as quick as possible while Mike slipped one of his fingers inside her, making her gasp as her head rolled back. \"I just wanted to ask you two if you wanted to go on a double date tonight.\" April straightened right up. \"Wait, what?\" \"Yeah,\" Megan spoke with a shrug as she sat down in the cafeteria with a few other of her nursing friends. \"I kind of met someone.\" \"Well, why the hell didn't you tell me last night?!\" Mike could have been stabbing her at the moment, but she wouldn't notice. Her best friend just told her she was interested in someone, and she had absolutely no information on this. \"Because I didn't want you to get all nosy and ruin it.\" \"I'm not nosy!\" April exclaimed, offended that she would say that. Mike looked up at her from under the covers before shrugging before saying, \"Eh.\" April rolled her eyes before shoving his head back down under the covers and looking back to the phone. \"What's his name? Where does he work? What's his social security number?\" \"You will learn…\" Megan had to pause. She was not going to learn his social security number. \"Almost all of that information tonight.\" April scoffed. She wanted to know it now. \"I'll text you the details, now go back to having sex.\" \"But I – \" The line went dead, April looking to the phone with her mouth dropped. April threw the covers off Mike to tell this to his face. \"She is the rudest person I've ever met!\" Mike looked so irritated with her. How hard was it to try and have sex with her? He thought this was supposed to happen after marriage. \"You will be fine.\" Mike then tried to go back under the covers to finish what he had started, but April was still angry. \"How could she not tell me about that?\" He sighed again before coming back out, knowing sex was off the table for right now. \"I don't know, April.\" He spoke as he straightened up. \"She knew you were about to get engaged, I guess she didn't want to overstimulate you?\" \"I'm about to overstimulate her.\" April mumbled under her breath. Mike then looked up at her, thinking about how their morning got started with a bit of a smirk. \"Oh, you know what I mean.\" Mike let out a frustrated sigh before looking back to her. \"Can we please have sex before I scream?\" \"Yes.\" April spoke before pushing him back down on the bed and climbing on him. \"But I'm on top.\" April wore a curve hugging cream dress, and Mike a suit with a blue tie as they walked into the restaurant. \"I'm going to kill her when I see her.\" April whispered to him. \"You're not.\" Mike quickly spoke, calling her bluff. \"Okay, I'm not going to kill her, but I'm going to embarrass her at least once.\" Mike took this time to give her a long eye roll. You'd think a morning of sex would wring the craziness right out. \"You need to calm down.\" April just rolled her eyes at that. \"You don't know what it's like to be a girl.\" Mike felt like this was going to be a long night of eye rolling and drinking. \"Guys don't talk about feelings.\" Mike slowly turned to look at her. \"We don't just talk about cars and guns.\" April shrugged like it was obvious. \"Well, yeah, there's sports too.\" Mike just blinked at her as they slowed to a stop. \"What else do you think we talk about?\" Before April could answer, Megan hurried over to her, wrapping her arms around her neck. \"There's my beautiful best friend who I love.\" \"Yeah, cut the crap.\" April spoke, pushing Megan's arms off of her. \"I'm still mad.\" Megan let out a loud groan before looking back to her. \"Come on, be happy for me.\" \"I might be when I meet and judge him.\" Megan rolled her eyes before turning to look at Mike. \"How are you?\" \"Lovely.\" He spoke sarcastically before following Megan as April continued to stand there, glaring at the two. April shook her head before eventually following. \"Jerks.\" Megan led them to the table Austin was already sitting at, drumming his fingers in a nervous beat. When he finally saw Megan followed by the secret service agent who saved the president and the president's daughter, he launched out of his seat from nerves. \"Austin,\" Megan spoke, joining him on his side while Mike and April stood in front of them. \"This is Mike Banning and April Asher.\" Austin let out a nervous laugh with a shrug. \"I know both of your names.\" Mike smiled at his joke, but April just didn't budge. She was too busy looking him over to make sure he wasn't a fuckboy. \"Um,\" Austin spoke before leaning forward to shake April's hand, wanting to make the best first impression he could. \"My name's Austin Florenzo.\" April conjured up the best fake smile she could before leaning forward to shake his hand. \"April.\" Mike rolled his eyes slightly at his fiancé's behavior as Austin swallowed a lump in his throat from nervousness. \"I'm Mike.\" Mike cut in, making April drop his hand so Mike could shake it. April gave him a disapproving look before both of the boys sat on the inside of the booth, and Megan and April followed by sitting on the outsides, across from each other. \"So,\" April spoke while looking to Megan. \"I guess we should order drinks.\" \"Actually,\" Austin cut in. \"I went and ordered a bottle for the table.\" April shot a look at him. How did he know what she wanted to drink? \"What bottle?\" \"Merlot.\" Austin clarified. He seemed to be sitting on the edge of his seat. \"Georges Duboeuf.\" April squinted his eyes. He said it in perfect French too. \"Wow, April,\" Megan spoke as she turned to look at her friend. \"That's your favorite wine, isn't it?\" \"Yeah, well, you told him that.\" Megan rolled her eyes at her before April turned back to Austin as the waitress came up and began to fill their wine glasses. \"So, Austin,\" She said his name in such a condescending way Mike had to cut her a disapproving look. \"What exactly do you do so you can afford Georges Duboeuf?\" \"April!\" Both Mike and Megan scolded at the same time. \"What?\" She screamed back. \"It's a fair question.\" \"I'm a doctor. I just got hired at the hospital.\" Megan and Austin looked to each other, each having a wide smile on their face, Megan giggling a little bit. \"That's how we met actually.\" April's eyes were darting back and forth from Megan to Austin. \"How exactly?\" Megan began to laugh while hitting Austin's arm. \"Tell her.\" \"Well, I went to my first patient's room,\" April shared a tiny glance at how hard they were laughing about this. They went on for a while, interrupting and laughing with each other about a story of fumbling limbs and mistakes. April wasn't really listening, though. Not because she was trying not to listen to Austin, but because she noticed Megan's face. It was glowing. She was so truly and genuinely happy. April got a little smile on her face from that. How could she deny her best friend of something so great just because she was upset she just found out? Not when she knew how great love was. She learned that from Mike. When they were done with their story, April moved to grip Mike's hand, reminded of how much she loved him. He gave her a confused look. She looked so happy. Something changed. He wasn't sure what it was, but he was actually really glad for it. She was happy for Megan. April leaned forward to pick up her wine glass, raising it up while giving hr friend a bright smile. \"I would like to make a toast.\" Megan turned her head to the side. She wasn't quite sure this was April anymore. April was really giving up so easily? \"To new friendship and love.\" Megan smiled before leaning forward and clinking their glasses together. She was actually really proud of April for putting all of her anger aside. \"I concur.\" Megan spoke while giving her friend a proud smile. April just got a bigger smile on her face, knowing as long as Austin treated her right and made her happy, April could learn how to be his friend. Mike and April walked into their apartment, April throwing her purse down on their entryway table before hurrying to the couch to kick off her heels and sprawl out on it. Mike shook his head with a little laugh before going into the kitchen. \"Do you want a drink?\" \"Yes.\" April spoke obviously before clicking on the TV. After April had finally settled on a crappy reality show, Mike came back in with two glasses in his hands. \"Can I ask you a question?\" Mike asked as he handed her the drink and moved her legs so he could sit. April took a big sip before looking back to him. \"Go ahead.\" \"What was it?\" April raised her eyebrows in confusion, waiting for some clarification. \"What was it that made you do a full 180 on how you feel about Austin?\" \"It's 360.\" April corrected with a blink. \"What the hell ever. I'm street smart and you're book smart. That's how this works.\" Mike sighed out as April just laughed about how angry he got. \"What was it?\" April gave him a little smile before turning her body so it was fully facing him. \"I don't know, I just looked at Megan and she looked… so happy.\" Mike smiled, loving that he could look at her and just see how big her heart was. It was shining through all on her face. \"I looked at her, and I was reminded how happy you make me.\" Mike offered her a little smile, loving how they could still have this after knowing each other for so long. They could still make each other happy, and they could still feel their love just as they were discovering it for the first time. \"I love you.\" \"Yeah?\" April challenged, her face spreading in a smile. \"Well I loved you first.\" \"You didn't.\" Mike taunted as he climbed on top of her. April let out a loud laugh, shaking her head at him while he began to stroke her face. \"But I did.\" She looked up at Mike, his eyes so playful in that moment. This is what she wanted. For her whole life. His eyes forever staring back to her. \"And I'm happy about it.\" Mike placed a small, soft kiss on her lips, loving this phase in their relationship at the moment. It was the highlight of how much they loved each other, and \"You're the best thing that's ever happened to me.\" April touched his face that time, thinking about what ran through her head this morning. \"You're my hero.\" She whispered out. \"All my life.\" She was paralyzed by fright again. How was it only now that the fears were running through her head? Why didn't they run through her head before? She thought they certainly would have after Mike returned back to work after the destruction of the White House, but for some reason it never crossed her mind. No matter what happened, Mike was always fine. She was always fine. He looked indestructible a few years ago. But now, she was noticing the little things. Multiple things that could have caused harm to either of them. She offered him a small smile, though. She was going to act like none of it was bothering her. Mike was smarter than that, though. April may have been book smart, but Mike was street and people smart. \"Are you okay?\" \"Why do you keep asking me that?\" April laughed out. Mike shook his head, continuing to study her. Something was wrong. Something had been wrong all day. \"I don't know, you've just had this look all day.\" April shook her head. \"I've never been happier.\" Mike didn't believe her. There was no way those exact same looks happened in the same situation in the same day. Something was wrong. He was going to figure it out, but not tonight. He would let her have that tonight, but he wouldn't let her have that for long. Something was going on and he was going to figure it out. Mrs. HappyAnarchy: Thank you so much, love! It feel so good to be back! stormrunner74: Thank you, hun! I love proposals! MisfitCarter: Your fangirling makes me so happy. I hope you love this one as much as the last one. RebeccaJoleneAumanWilson: This is honestly one of the sweetest reviews I've ever read. I read it and it made my day. I honestly couldn't stop smiling. Thank you so much, I hope you like this chapter too! jocelynstilinski: SAME! NGArmyWife: I'm so happy you loved it! I'm so glad you liked the proposal! Gigi103: Thank you so much, but you should read the first one before this one. I'm sorry if you already have, but I just don't recognize your name. Igor Blonsky: Oh my gosh...could you imagine, though? Like they're not going to listen to anyone and they're going to have the biggest mouth. Like god bless Mike and April when they have kids because they're going to have the biggest handful. Thank you for the review, love! musicluver246: Thank you so much! It's so good to see everyone again, and even some new faces! This chapter got almost ten reviews! And it's just the first chapter! That means so much to me, you guys! Thank you all for the continued support. I wouldn't be here if I didn't have all of you! I'm sorry I'm not as fast with updating as I usually am. I'm just swamped with school starting back up, sorority activities, cheerleading, work and my other fanfic going on right now (screams for help). I hope you all liked this chapter, though. Let me know what you all thought, and everyone have an awesome rest of their day/night![Chapter 3] April's elbows were propped up on the dining room table while massaging her temples. If Mike spoke one more word, she was sure she was going to lose it. She would be a widow before they were even married. \"I'm just saying, it would be better if we have live music.\" \"No!\" April screamed out before looking up at him and throwing her hands in the air. \"What if they suck? I'm not going to have some band ruin our song!\" \"Sweetheart,\" Mike spoke calmly before moving to the other side of the table and grabbing her hands. He pulled them down and looked right into her eyes. \"You are the daughter of the President of the United States, and you also saved the country. You could probably have any band you want.\" \"Yeah, well, we're only going to have a band if it's Imagine Dragons.\" April then picked up her folder of wedding planning information before walking out of the kitchen. Mike took a deep breath before rubbing his face to calm him down. \"I love her very much.\" He said to himself so he wouldn't say something that would hurt her. \"I love her very much.\" He repeated again. It was beginning to get harder not to say anything as he continued to rub his face. \"I love her very much. I love her very much.\" He had to say something. \"April!\" \"What?!\" She screamed out from the bedroom. Mike ran over to the bedroom, watching her as she took off her makeup in the mirror. \"You can't just do that.\" He complained. \"You can't make every little decision about our wedding.\" April turned to look at him before taking a deep sigh. \"Do you remember all those years ago when we supposedly had the best band in Washington DC at the Independence Day Ball?\" Mike took a deep sigh before looking away, the wrong notes still haunting him in his nightmares. \"And what happened?\" Mike's arms were crossed, but he was avoiding her eyes. He didn't want her to be right. \"They were sharp.\" \"And flat.\" She added on before moving closer to him. \"At the same time.\" She moved out of his personal space before throwing her hands in the air again. \"I have awful experience with bands, and I really don't want one at my wedding.\" Mike sighed one more time, uncrossing his arms to talk with her again. \"How about this,\" April sighed, really not wanting this conversation, but she was going to listen to him. Because she loved him. Or something like that. \"We audition a few bands, and if you still don't like any of them, we'll get a DJ.\" When April looked up at him, she gave him a little smile. She knew he wanted a band, and he was trying to compromise. She would do it for him. \"Fine.\" Mike walked toward her, before pulling her into a big hug. Her hands went to his chest as she shut her eyes, leaning into him. \"I love you.\" He whispered before placing a kiss on the top of her forehead. \"And I'm happy.\" April opened her eyes, taking a deep breath before moving even further into him. \"I'm happy too.\" She picked her head up to look at him as he looked down, showing their perfect height difference again. \"I love you.\" The two then leaned forward, giving each other a kiss before pulling apart to get ready for bed. April was buried in her phone as she walked through the halls, nearly running into Mike if he hadn't caught her. \"Watch where you're going, would you?\" \"I can't.\" Mike was now guiding her down the hallway as she continued to type away on her phone. \"We're getting a new personal assistant for my dad today, and I have to make sure she knows exactly what to do, and not screw anything up.\" \"Who is she?\" Mike asked, the question had been going through his head since April told him about her first hire. \"Her name's…\" She looked down at her files for a moment before looking back up at her fiancé. \"Brianna Lynn McGarrett.\" \"That's a mouthful.\" Mike scoffed. \"Well,\" April spoke as she finally looked up at him. \"She's a Navy brat, knows a whole bunch of languages, black belt, stuff like that, so, I mean...she's qualified?\" \"Any administrative experience?\" Mike asked, annoyed that she didn't even think that through. \"Of course!\" She stopped walking to turn around and look at him. \"I'm not a complete idiot.\" She rolled her eyes at him before going into the Oval Office to collect her father while Mike simply rolled his eyes back. When they acted like this together, it was hard to tell they were madly in love. \"Come on,\" She spoke in a demanding tone as he just sat at his desk, plunged into his paperwork. \"New girl's gonna be here any minute and you have to meet her.\" \"I'm busy.\" Ben grunted. April simply rolled her eyes before hurrying to him and pulling him to stand up by the arm. \"You're meeting her, I don't know what else to tell you.\" \"April,\" he complained, but April wasn't going to stop. He also needed a break, and meeting the new girl would be a perfect break. \"Come on, old man.\" Ben rolled his eyes, but decided it would be easier if he just agreed rather than fighting her. \"Fine.\" He spoke, straightening himself out before rubbing his jacket of wrinkles caused by her pulling. \"I'll meet her, but then I'm going right back to work.\" \"Fine by me.\" April spoke before raising her hands to him. Mike opened up the door for the two to walk out, April making sure her father went before her so he wouldn't run off like the workaholic he was. He rolled his eyes when he realized what she was doing before taking off. He quickly thanked Mike, letting April finally leave the office and head to the stairs. Ben went down the stairs first, and as he walked down, he had to stop a little. There was a woman, getting checked over by Voight, and she was…beautiful. She had long, chocolate hair that was tied in a thick ponytail. It was brushed, but it most definitely wasn't heat treated like April did to make her hair strictly curly or straight, it was a mixture. And she was so tan. It looked like she had just gotten back from the beach. With that tanned skin, the main thing that stood out were her eyes. They were a deep, deep green. Like emeralds or an evergreen tree. Ben was in one word, smitten. \"Dad,\" April spoke as she moved past him and to Brianna. \"This is Brianna McGarrett, and she is your new personal assistant.\" Brianna grabbed her purse in a hurried fashion before scuffling over to the President, April and Mike. \"Hi.\" She spoke before offering the President her hand. \"It's nice to meet you.\" \"It's…\" Ben struggled for words for a moment before grabbing her hand. \"Nice to meet you too.\" April and Mike shared an intrigued look before looking back to the two, focused on their hands that were still connected in a shake. \"I haven't had too much experience assisting, Ben, so forgive me.\" Ben smiled at her. He liked the way she said his name. \"Oh, shit, I can't believe I just called you by your first name.\" Ben laughed before shaking his head. \"Trust me, I like that much better than Mr. President.\" April and Mike were both fighting a smile as they looked back and forth between the two. \"I also just cursed in front of you.\" Ben shrugged again. \"I like a woman with a mouth on her.\" April's eyes grew wide before placing a hand on her mouth. Ben's eyes grew wide when he realized what he said. \"I didn't mean it like… I like when women are nastier.\" April pulled her hand off of her mouth, replacing that shocked expression with a dropped jaw. She had never seen her father flirt before. It was a train wreck. How did he ever get her mother to have children with him? \"Not like that either.\" Brianna began to laugh, putting a hand over her mouth at how cute he was, fumbling with his words. \"You know what I mean.\" \"I do know what you mean.\" She laughed out while taking her hand off of her mouth. \"This is fantastic.\" April whispered with a slight smile on her face. Ben shot his daughter a dirty glance before April turned back to Brianna. \"Well, Brianna, Voight is going to show you around, and then you'll come meet with me, and we'll get the rest of your paperwork settled, sound good?\" \"Perfect, April.\" Brianna shut her eyes again at how she called her boss by her first name. \"Fuck.\" Ben put his head down as he laughed at that. \"It's fine.\" April assured her while waving a hand at her. \"Go ahead and take your tour.\" She gave April a smile before turning back to the President. \"I'll see you soon, sir .\" She made sure to accent \"sir\" so she wouldn't call him by his first name again. \"Counting on it.\" Ben assured before shaking her hand again. Ben then turned around, hurrying back upstairs, but he made sure to look back at Brianna while Voight began to lead her the other way. Once both of them were out of earshot, April and Mike turned to each other excitedly. \"Did you see that?\" April asked in a hushed whisper in fear that one of them would somehow be able to hear them. \"I think I would be blind if I didn't.\" \"Oh. My. God.\" April spoke, breaking apart every syllable, her mouth dropped in shock with a thinking look on her face. Mike then began to panic, wondering if she was taking this in a bad way. It had been four and a half years since her mother's death. Maybe it was too soon. \"Hey,\" Mike spoke before putting a comforting hand on her shoulder. \"Are you okay?\" She turned to him with wide eyes, and he wasn't sure how to read it. It could be devastation, but it also could be excitement. \"Are you kidding?\" That still wasn't reassuring. \"This is fantastic!\" Mike let out a relieved sigh before offering her a little smile. \"This is going to be fantastic. My dad could really use someone. It's just been him and Conner since I moved out, they could really use a woman.\" April's eyes then grew even wider. \"Oh my god! I have to tell Conner!\" She then hurried up the stairs, ready to assemble the old team. They had to get to planning how they were going to get Ben and Brianna together. April, Mike, Conner, Megan and Austin sat in a circle around a chalk board in one of the secret tunnels in the White House. Austin had never been there before, and Megan had to swear him to secrecy since he really wasn't supposed to know about it. \"Okay,\" April spoke as she stood up and picked up a piece of chalk. \"We have to get working. I need suggestions on how we're going to get Ben and Brianna together.\" Conner scrunched his eyebrows before looking to his sister. \"Did you just call Dad 'Ben'?\" \"Maybe.\" She spoke with a shrug before looking back to the board. \"Okay, for real,\" She clapped her hands together before looking back to the board. \"Suggestions!\" \"Um,\" Megan began, a thought beginning to develop. \"We can trick the two into having dinner with just the two of them?\" April hummed it over while looking to her friend. \"I feel like we've done that one before.\" Austin looked around at the group with a confused face. \"How many relationships have you made?\" \"Austin,\" April spoke while pointing the chalk at him. \"Suggestion?\" Austin looked around, noticing everyone staring at him before going to the first thing that came in his mind. \"We can…tell them that they…like each other.\" April looked so disappointed at his \"suggestion\" before shaking her head. \"Austin, if you're going to be a part of this group, you're going to have to work on better suggestions.\" April turned back to the chalkboard as Austin looked to Megan, thinking that suggestion was pretty good. Megan just leaned forward, placing her hand on his, giving it a little rub. Poor Austin. He had a lot to learn. \"We need something good.\" April was rubbing her cheek in thought. \"Something that isn't going to mess anything up.\" She shot a look at Mike, and he gave her an irritated look, knowing that was a jab about his band idea. Megan looked back and forth at the two in thought. \"Hey, shouldn't you two be auditioning bands for the wedding?\" \"This is more important.\" April spoke quickly so she wouldn't ask any more questions. Megan threw her hands up in defense before whispering, \"Whoa, bro.\" It was just loud enough for April to hear, making her roll her eyes. She was going to shoot back at her when Mike suddenly spoke. \"Power outage.\" Mike spoke as the idea simply popped into his head. April turned to look at him, a little smile growing on her face. \"We fake a power outage, ask Brianna to stay late, so it's just us, a few extra Secret Service and them.\" April's smile just got wider as he continued to talk. \"There's candles, take out, everything they need for a romantic realization.\" April leaned forward, her and Mike's hands clashing together in a loud smack before looking back to everyone else just sitting there in awe at how loud that high five was. \"And that is why I'm marrying him.\" Mike and April were the ones camped out by the power generator. Fortunately, they alerted the rest of the Secret Service about their plans so they wouldn't go into a frenzy when the power actually went out. April was currently holding onto the binoculars they were sharing, just waiting for Brianna to go in there, and ask him what time she was supposed to go home. \"You know,\" Mike began as he looked at her, a little smile on his face at how cute she looked. \"I was thinking,\" April moved the binoculars from her face to look at him, knowing this sentence could go in any way. \"Maybe we do get a DJ for the wedding.\" April's eyes widened, getting excited. Her excitement just made Mike smile even more. \"Really?!\" \"Under a few conditions.\" Mike clarified while raising a finger to her. \"If I compromise, you're gonna compromise.\" April sighed, wanting to know what his condition was before nodding in agreeance. \"Fair.\" \"There will be a few songs that won't be played.\" April gave him a skeptical look. \"Number one being 'The Hustle'.\" April shook her head as she looked at him. Why would she ever have that play at her wedding? \"You know, sometimes I forget how old you really are.\" \"No Cupid Shuffle.\" April gulped a little. Okay, that one she kind of had a problem with, but she could live without it. \"No Cha Cha Slide.\" Okay, now he was being unreasonable. \"Or The Wobble.\" \"No!\" April complained that time. \"You know The Wobble is my favorite!\" \"That's the price you've got to pay if you want a DJ.\" April huffed at him before stomping her foot. \"No organized dances.\" April glared at him for a moment before remembering marriage was about compromise or whatever. \"Fine.\" April sighed out before looking back to the binoculars. \"No stupid organized dances, but be prepared to have the lamest wedding of the century.\" \"Perfect.\" He told her with a big smile. She gave Mike a long, dramatic eye roll before turning back to her father's office window. Now she was even more irritated. That was until all the lights shut off without either Mike or April doing anything. She quickly turned to Mike with wide eyes. \"What the hell was that?\" \"Go.\" Mike urged, the two running back inside the White House. As Mike blocked the door, April began to hurry upstairs to her father's room. Mike and April had been through this before, and it wasn't fun. If the White House was under attack again, April thought she would most definitely lose it. Mike hurried after her, but April was already all the way up the stairs and sprinting to her father's office. When April threw the door open, though, a fist immediately connected with her cheek. \"Ow!\" April screamed before grabbing her face. \"I'm sorry!\" April turned to where it came from, noticing Brianna's hands over her mouth. \"What the hell, Ri?\" April's voice was muffled, still holding her face. It really hurt. She was a lot stronger than she looked. \"I'm a Navy brat.\" She spoke as an excuse before taking her hands off her face. \"Everyone okay?\" Mike asked while coming into the room. \"Yes.\" Ben spoke as April said, \"No!\" That's when Megan and Austin came running into the room, Austin looking insanely panicked. \"I might have accidentally turned off the inside generator.\" Austin apologized. April shot him a dirty look, realizing her throbbing face was his fault. \"You mean, they let you operate on people, but you don't even know how to operate a generator?\" Austin let out a nervous laugh while looking to everyone in the room. \"Who are you?\" Ben finally asked, never seeing Austin before in his life, and now he was standing in his office. \"Austin Florenzo.\" He spoke before leaning forward to shake his hand. \"I'm Megan's boyfriend.\" Ben shot Megan an impressed look before the lights finally came back on. Everyone sighed in relief as April looked around. \"Is no one going to take into consideration that I was just punched?!\" \"What the hell just happened?\" Ben asked, looking around at the group, no one really making eye contact with him. \"I want to know now .\" Conner then came running in with an excited look on his face. \"Did it work? Did they kiss?\" April cut him a dirty look, Conner realizing he had came in at the wrong time. \"Did who kiss?\" Ben asked, not taking his eyes off of Conner. Everyone was quiet again, April knowing she had to speak since no one else was going to. Even if she was still gripping her face in pain, and her voice was about to be very muffled. \"We just thought that you and Brianna had a lot of chemistry so we made a plan on how to get you guys together in a romantic setting, and,\" April shot another dirty look at Austin. \" Someone messed it up a little.\" Ben paused for a minute, taking in everything his daughter said before turning to look at Brianna. He really did like her. The biggest thing he thought about, though, were his children, but here they were encouraging it. Brianna just kept looking down, obviously avoiding Ben's glance. Did she feel the same way? \"Can I talk to Brianna for a moment?\" Everyone stood there, not wanting to move at all. \"Alone.\" Everyone let out a loud sigh before walking out, April still holding her throbbing face. She turned back to look at Mike as they all walked out before him. \"Are we going to do anything about my face?\" \"I'll get you ice, cry baby.\" Mike spoke with an eye roll before shutting the door behind him. Once the door was shut, everyone put their ears to the door, listening as intently as possible, April still grabbing her cheek as she leaned forward, the closest to the door. Ben turned around to look at Brianna before letting out a deep sigh. \"I'm sorry, my kids are…eccentric.\" \"No,\" Brianna spoke with the wave of the hand. \"It's fine.\" She then crossed her arms, not quite sure how to act around Ben now. \"They were just looking out for you.\" There was another awkward silence, everyone outside the door leaning even closer to it in fear that they were going to miss something. \"I mean, they weren't wrong.\" Brianna looked up at him quickly, hoping he would bring it up rather than her. There was something there. They just weren't able to figure it out. Ben was looking at her hopefully, knowing he hadn't felt this way about anyone since Maggie. The one thing he was terrified of was his children's reactions, but here they were trying to push them together. Maybe this was what was always waiting for him. Brianna then got a big smile on her face before nodding. \"I'm glad they did it.\" Ben looked down bashfully, Brianna doing the same. \"Do you want to have dinner?\" Brianna looked back at him, the blood rushing to her tanned face. \"I would love that.\" Ben offered his hand, Brianna moving to him slowly. This was her boss. The President of the United States. This wasn't going to be a small step, but somehow it felt like the right one. She grabbed his hand as Ben moved to the door, opening it up, hitting April right on her bruised cheek. \"Ow!\" stormrunner74: I'm sorry! Does \"love\" suit you better? I'm excited for London too! RebeccaJoeneAumanWilson: Hehehe I'm still super giddy about the babies. I love being their honorary auntie! Igor Blonsky: Yeah, and April knows that which has got to be tough on a girl. I hope you're liking the sequel so far! MisfitCarter: Yay! Okay so Megan is my legit best friend, and her actual boyfriend is named Austin so that scene was also kind of based on the first time I met Austin, but now we're super close and I call him dad because Megan is my mom friend. Mrs. HappyAnarchy: Haha she's her best friend and this is April we're talking about! She's a very protective person. I liked that bit too NGArmyWife: Hehehe she might be. Thank you so much, love! I'm honored to write it for you guys! Okay, funny story, Megan is a real person. She's my best friend and her legit boyfriend's name is Austin so when I was writing the part where Austin was in the group trying to come up with ideas, they were actually fighting. Just some trivia I thought I would share with you. I hope you all like this chapter and the new character! Thanks to RebeccaJoleneAumanWilson for giving me the idea (she's also having triplets named April, Ben and Mike *screams*). Remember to review![Chapter 4] August April and Mike's apartment had become something else. They began getting all the boxes for their wedding in. The boxes of save the dates. The boxes of wedding invitations. The boxes of placemats and silverware. It was all beginning to be too much. April was just trying to get a glass of water, but there were boxes blocking her way getting into the kitchen. \"Mike!\" April called, getting flustered as she tried to move around the boxes. He popped his head in through the other side of the kitchen, ready to hear what she had to say. \"I thought I told you to move these!\" \"I did.\" Mike spoke with a shrug before walking into the kitchen, April letting out an angry sigh. She thought he would know better by now. \"Baby,\" April spoke to him as patiently as she could manage. \"When I tell you to move something out of the way, I don't mean to put it somewhere else that's going to get in my way.\" April took another deep sigh before moving her foot. She forgot there were boxes there for a moment. \"Fuck!\" She screamed while grabbing onto her foot and dropping to the floor. Mike immediately ran to her, pushing the boxes out of the way, April gasping at the sound of clanking when one fell. \"Not my silverware!\" \"It'll be fine.\" He assured before scooping her up and hurrying into the living room to place her on the couch. When he did that, April continued to grab onto her foot, Mike now noticing she was bleeding. \"Hang on.\" He hurried back into the kitchen, knocking over another box, making April grunt in annoyance. If she wasn't in so much pain right now he would definitely be getting an ear full. He came back with a pack of ice before carefully placing it on April's toes. She let out a painful hiss as Mike looked up at her, trying to gauge her pain. \"Thanks.\" She muttered after her hiss was done. Mike stretched her leg out so he could rest her foot on his lap. \"You're welcome.\" She gave him a little smile, Mike returning it, a little idea running through his head. \"You know, I've been thinking – \" \"Thinking about my beautifully wrapped silverware probably all over the box right now?\" He shot her a dirty look as April smiled before Mike eventually laughed. \"No.\" He looked down at her foot, beginning to move the ice pack around, finding himself kind of nervous to bring this up. \"I was thinking about us buying a house.\" April let her jaw drop a little as Mike was still looking down at her foot. She hadn't even thought about that. \"You know,\" Mike spoke, finally picking his head back up to look at her. \"I feel like we're running out of space in here more and more every day, and I got this apartment after Leah and I split up which wasn't my best time. I want a place that represents our next chapter.\" April bit her lip. Mike had been so sentimental in the past few months, she was loving every bit of it. And he was right, they needed some place they could grow into. They needed a place where they could form a new beginning. April slowly nodded as Mike looked at her, giving her a big smile as April began to laugh. \"I would love to buy a house with you.\" Mike then leaned forward, giving her a big kiss that made April scrunch her lips together through her smile. She was already envisioning it. Their perfect house where in a few years they would be hearing the pitter patter of little feet. Mike and April walked around the house, Mike holding onto the pamphlet, tapping it with his index finger in thought. April's arms were folded, extenuating how tight her purple tank top really was as she investigated the cabinet space. April wasn't sure if she really liked this house. It was pretty and big. Big enough to raise the kind of family she wanted, but it just didn't feel like her house. And they knew this was a big decision. They would live here for probably their whole lives, and they knew they had to be sure. Mike turned to look at April, wanting to know if he was thinking the same thing she was thinking. This wasn't their house. \"What do you think?\" April turned to Mike as they walked out of the kitchen, reaching for his hand. She opened her mouth, about to give him an answer when another high pitched voice came out. \"Oh my god, Mike!\" Mike stiffened once he saw her before shutting his eyes. \"Oh my god.\" April's eyebrows furrowed as the blonde with the big hair came walking over with what looked like a male model wrapped around her arm. \"Who the hell is that?\" Her voice was more scared than accusing. Mike took a deep sigh while shutting his eyes. No matter how hard he shut his eyes, that wouldn't change her weaving through the crowd to get to him. \"One of Leah's friends.\" April looked back to the woman, wishing there was a way they could duck out, but there was just so many people. It would be impossible to get away now. \"Shit.\" She cursed just as the blonde made it to them. \"Mike,\" She spoke through a smile before leaning forward and hugging him. Mike looked so uncomfortable as they leaned in. He wanted to get out of that whole house. Maybe that wouldn't even be far away enough. \"How are you, Patty?\" \"Paula.\" She corrected when she pulled away to look at him, still wearing that big, fake smile. \"Whatever.\" Mike spoke while shaking his head. Paula probably didn't even hear Mike. She was too distracted on who he was with. \"You must be the president's daughter.\" April extended her hand, deciding it was probably better to be polite right now. \"Amber?\" \"April.\" She corrected as Paula finally took her hand. She knew she was doing that on purpose, but April was not going to let that get to her. \"Right, April.\" When the two finally let go of each other's hands, Paula turned back to Mike. \"Well, I haven't seen you in a few years.\" \"No.\" Mike spoke through a laugh. He wanted to keep it that way. \"We've been kind of busy with – \" \"Oh my god.\" Paula spoke, her eyes looking down at their hands. Their hands were held, but that wasn't what she was shocked about. April's hand was outward, revealing her engagement ring. \"Oh my god.\" Mike whispered. He hated this. He hated all of this. Why Leah's most annoying friend out of all the friends they could have ran into? She looked back to Mike with her jaw dropped before looking back to April. \"You two are engaged? How…great?\" April studied her before turning her head a little bit, and a small smile on her face. Something about how she said it made her think it wasn't a real compliment. \"Thank you.\" \"Let me see the ring!\" April hated how she was acting like they were old friends, but April also knew what she was doing. If her or Megan were in the same situation Leah was in, they would be doing this for each other too. April brought out her hand, letting Paula take it in hers to inspect it. \"Huh.\" April's smile immediately fell, knowing this trick too. \"Leah got a diamond.\" \"Well,\" April spoke, bringing back a tight smile, trying to let her know in some way that she wasn't getting to her, but in all honesty, she really was. \"This ring means way more to me than a diamond ever would.\" Paula shrugged before bringing her hand down and looking April in the eye. \"I would prefer the diamond, but good for you.\" April was screaming internally before looking to Paula's significant other. \"So, are you two house shopping or just trying to get an idea of what you would want in the future?\" \"House shopping.\" The man said with a nod. \"Oh,\" April spoke with a nod before looking Paula up and down, realizing she was missing something April did have. A ring. \"Good luck, I know it's really hard to keep an uncommitted relationship going after purchasing a house.\" \"No.\" Paula spoke while leaning into the man. \"We're committed.\" April scoffed with a nod. Two could play at this game. Paula just didn't know. \"Hard to tell if a relationship is going somewhere if there's not some kind of promise.\" Paula's jaw dropped as Mike tried to hide his smile. April continued to nod, showing the same fake concerned face Paula was showing when she saw April's ring. \"But good for you.\" \"Anyway,\" Paula said loudly, showing she was ready to leave this conversation. \"We still have to check out the upstairs, but we'll definitely see you on your way out.\" \"Yes, of course.\" April spoke while touching Paula's arm with a large fake smile. \"Nice to meet you, Patty.\" \"Paula.\" She corrected as Mike and April began to move past them. \"I don't care.\" April mumbled under her breath. They continued to walk until they were sure the two wouldn't be able to hear them. Once they were set, April turned to Mike with wild eyes, Mike beginning to get very concerned with her sanity. \"I want it.\" Mike leaned into her as if to ask for clarification. \"I want the house.\" Mike blinked before coming up with the only response he could. \"What?\" \"I want the house. I think we should get it right now.\" Mike laughed a little, realizing what she was doing. \"You just want the house because Paula wants the house.\" April looked around a little, not sure why he was bringing the obvious up. \"Yeah? So?\" \"April,\" He spoke slowly, knowing this was her dominance talking. \"Do you even like the house?\" \"It doesn't matter!\" She stressed while stomping her foot a little. \"I'm not letting that bitch have it.\" Mike took a deep sigh before looking around the house. This wasn't it. This was not their place. He was hoping April would be able to figure out that their house was more important than showing up to someone they would probably never see again. \"Fine.\" Mike spoke before tossing his hands in the air. \"Do what you want.\" April nodded, knowing she had the right. \"But just think about what you're doing before you do something you're going to regret.\" That froze April as Mike leaned forward to give her a big kiss on the head before walking off. April looked over the place again before taking a deep sigh. He was right. She didn't want to admit it, but he was right. If she chose this house out of spite, it would never mean anything to either of them. This was more something Leah would do, and that was the last person she wanted to be compared to. \"April,\" Paula spoke from behind her. April rolled her eyes, finding herself annoyed all over again. \"It's a pretty place, isn't it?\" April turned around to look at her, realizing Paula was trying to figure out what she thought about it to decide if she wanted it or not. She knew that kind of pettiness. She had that kind of pettiness less than thirty seconds ago. \"Yeah, gorgeous,\" April then leaned in, deciding she was going to mess with her. \"But I heard the realtor whispering on the phone about mildew in the basement.\" Paula's eyes got slightly wide. \"But I mean, it's just the basement. If you bought it, it wouldn't be the only poisonous thing inside.\" April then began to move past her, breaking up her and her boyfriend in their arm embrace that seemed to never break. \"See you, Patty.\" \"Paula!\" She barked out, her voice a slightly higher pitch at how shaken April had made her. \"Still don't care!\" April called behind her shoulder, not even taking the time to turn around and tell her. When April got outside, she saw Mike standing in the yard, looking out at all the houses surrounding them. Sure, this would be a good neighborhood, but this just wasn't their house. They knew, there was a better house out there for them. One that would change their life. April hurried past him, going towards their parked car as Mike furrowed his eyebrows at her. She turned back to look at him, giving him a shrug. \"Come on, our dream house is out there. Are you gonna help me find it?\" Mike got a large smile on his face before running after her, placing a big sloppy kiss on her mouth, making her laugh as she fell back on their car. April was just hoping their dream house was still out there. When they went to the next house, no one else was there. It was just a private tour for them. And they had quickly fallen in love with it. The realtor lead them to the back of the house, opening up the sliding glass door so they could check out the backyard. There was sun making a glare on the window, so they couldn't clearly see it from inside the house, but once they walked outside, they knew this was their house. There was a small patio with rafters above it, the wood painted a blue-grey. The staircase that led down into the yard was sanded down to pure perfection, there wasn't a chip in sight. That went along with the whole patio, it all seemed like there was no way it was real wood, it was so smooth. As they walked down the steps, they were brought into the greenest, fullest grass they had ever seen. Mike and April didn't know if it was the fact that they loved the house so much making everything seem perfect or if it really just was. As April looked out on the huge backyard, she began to think about their future kids running around barefoot. She then turned to look at the left of the yard, seeing there was a gate and a little sidewalk that led to a garage. She just kept picturing the kids playing in the back, and their faces lighting up whenever they saw Mike pull in. Mike was distracted by the little garden bed. The soil looked good, and there were small stones around the dirt ranging in different sizes. He kept picturing April kneeled down in the dirt like a princess. Dirt would be on her face, but she would still manage to look flawless. Mike would be standing on the patio, looking down at her from the railing while drinking a beer, a smile on his face as he watched her plant the newest flowers she had found. They both had huge smiles on her faces before turning to look at each other. April had a hand on her abdomen as Mike moved to hold her other hand. April let out a little laugh, judging by the look on his face that he thought what she thought too. \"I think we just found our house.\" She laughed out. \"I think we did.\" He agreed before moving in to hug her. \"So,\" the realtor spoke as she moved forward, not wanting to break the two apart, but wanting to be close to the two. \"Can I draw up the paperwork?\" Mike and April looked to each other before breaking apart, knowing they didn't need to talk it over. This was their dream house, and it felt so surreal that they were actually going to purchase it. \"Yes.\" April finally answered before pulling her phone out of her back jean pocket. \"But can you take a picture of us, first?\" \"Of course.\" The realtor eagerly took her phone as the two got placed right in front of the patio. April was initially standing on Mike's right, but she then thought of something. \"Wait, switch places with me.\" Mike turned to look at her, his eyebrows furrowed in confusion. \"Why?\" \"Because that bitch pissed me off about my ring, and I want everyone to see it because it's amazing.\" Mike shrugged before moving to her right and the two got set again. When the realtor brought the phone back to April, and they two studied it, Mike nodded in approval, knowing they couldn't get back at Paula with the house, but they could get back at her with this picture. \"Post it.\" April turned to look at him, a sympathetic look on her face. \"Aw, you're learning to be petty.\" Mike leaned into her, giving her a small smile. \"I love it.\" He put a small kiss on her lips as the realtor went inside the house to begin the paperwork. When they pulled apart, he looked right in her eyes. \"We just bought our first house.\" He whispered into her ear. \"I know.\" Her voice was filled with excitement as she spoke. \"We get to deal with mortgages and fun adult stuff like that.\" \"Oh,\" Mike laughed a little. \"I honestly can't wait.\" April gave him another small kiss on the lips. \"I told you if we waited we'd find the perfect place.\" April looked up in his eyes, wishing they could fill this place with children right now. Even though most of the time, she hated it when he was right, she felt different this one time, and only this one time. \"I love it when you're right.\" The four were stretching out on Mike and April's new front lawn. Mike on the far left, April and Ben in the middle and Brianna on the far right. \"Alright,\" April announced as she picked her leg up and stretched it behind her back. \"Whoever makes it down the block first wins.\" \"What do we win?\" Brianna asked excitedly, leaning over Ben to look at her. April was in the middle of stretching her arm back before looking to her. April honestly had no idea. \"Uh, I don't know...satisfaction?\" Brianna shrugged before going back to her stretches. \"Works for me.\" \"We gonna run or chat?\" Mike asked as he turned to the two girls. April rolled her eyes at him before everyone got set in a running position. \"On your marks,\" Ben began. April got up from her running position to give an angry sigh to her father. \"Do we really have to do that?\" \"Go!\" Everyone else took off as April continued to stand there. \"Hey!\" She yelled as they ran off. \"This is my house!\" None of them slowed down. One of the Secret Service guys rolled up in his car right next to her. \"I hang out with assholes.\" She told him. \"The man running our country is an asshole, his girlfriend is an asshole and the one protecting them is an asshole.\" His eyebrows furrowed before giving her a confused glance as she just began to walk, finding running pointless now. \"Does that make me an asshole?\" \"No.\" She sighed out while watching them run. \"Mike is the only asshole out of you guys.\" He began to chuckle as April watched them all run, getting a little smile on her face. This was her house. She had a house to call her own and some of the most important people in her life were running outside of it. She loved everything about the past few days. And she loved that Mike and April's lives were finally coming together. Igor Blonsky: Haha I told that to my dad because I always claim how funny I am and he never says I'm funny so thank you for proving to him that I'm funny. I feel like they should celebrate their age differences. Yeah, it's not the most normal thing, but who wants normal? And Love Actually is honestly my favorite Christmas/romantic movie of all time, and David and Natalie are my favorite story, so I would be lying if I said that's not where my inspiration came from because it totally is. Mrs. HappyAnarchy: GIRL! THE PREZ JUST MIGHT! Also, thank you, love! MisfitCarter: I love making people laugh! In my sorority, I'm the class clown, and I love making the girls laugh so I'm glad I can make all of you laugh too! Your reviews always make me feel so good, so I want to thank you for always being committed and friendly! You gotta make the characters real or no one reads, and I like to make them feel real through making them funny or giving them a flaw (like April's pettiness in this chapter) RebeccaJoleneAumanWilson: Um, hell yeah! They all need to chill in Hawaii! Guest: Hahaha that's what I had to do sometimes when I was dating my boyfriend and he pissed me off, so, I felt Mike in that moment. NGArmyWife: He does! I love matchmaker April! And I love when the kids want the parents to move on, it shows so much maturity to me, and a want for the parent to be happy. I'm so excited to write more of Brianna and what's going to go one with her and April as friends! Alright, my friends, here's the new chapter. I'm not sure if I told you guys, but I know I told my Trekies, so I'm just going to tell you again if I already have. The chapters are going to take approximately two weeks from the update date for a new chapter. With me having school and another story I'm working on, it's just impossible for me to crank out the chapters as fast as I usually do. This week it was a combination of studying for tests and Santa Clarita Diet coming out (omg that show is amazing, if you haven't seen it, definitely check it out). Well, I hope you guys liked this chapter, and let me know what you think! Love y'all! PS: I'm sorry I'm so dumb and put up my Star Trek chapter instead of the new one, thanks stormrunner74 for letting me know![Chapter 5] September April had multiple sheets on the floor in front of her as she went through them, all of them having different pricing and packages. \"Oh,\" Brianna spoke while pushing it towards April. \"What about this one?\" April glanced at it quickly before looking up at her friend with a fake smile. \"Honey, Eden Nightclub is where Georgetown students get shot.\" Brianna gave her a dramatic eye roll before looking back to the other papers lying around them. \"Well, sorry I didn't go to Georgetown.\" April looked up at her, scoffing. \"No, you just went to college in the most beautiful place on earth.\" \"I'm a Navy brat and my mom is Hawaiian, deal with it.\" April gave her a fake angry glare while a smile was creeping on her face. Mike walked into the living room of their house, seeing the two on the floor with a beer in his hand. He looked back and forth at the two, who were now laughing, with a confused smile on his face. \"What are you two hens gibbering about?\" \"Brianna's birthday party.\" April spoke while turning to look at him. The smile fell off Mike's face, realizing he was about to be recruited to help. \"Yeah, I'm out of here.\" \"Mike!\" April called, grabbing onto his arm before he could make it out. \"We need a place. That's all you have to help us with and then you can leave.\" He gave her a terrified face, not wanting to do this at all. \"Besides, Megan's on her way and she can help us after that, but until then, this is your job.\" There was then a knock on the door, Mike's ears perking up a little. \"Oh, please, God, let that be Megan.\" Mike then bolted to the door as Brianna laughed, making April turn to her while throwing her hands in the air. She couldn't believe she had to put up with this man for her whole life. When both Megan and Mike got past the entry way and into the living room, Megan looked slightly terrified. \"He said he had never been happier to see me in his entire life.\" April gave him an irritated glance before he went up to her and planted a kiss on her forehead. \"You ladies have fun, I'm gonna be in the room.\" April mimicked him as he talked, but he quickly shut the door after. \"So,\" Megan spoke, taking her purse off her shoulder before sitting down. \"What did you girls get done without me?\" \"Not much.\" Brianna admitted before taking a sip of her wine. \"Well,\" Megan sighed out before grabbing the spare wine glass and the bottle. \"That's understandable. You two can't get anything done without me.\" April then turned to Brianna, nervous to ask her this question she had been thinking about all day. \"Brianna,\" She turned to her, her eyes slightly wide in fear, knowing that tone of voice by now. April was about to ask her for a favor. \"Would you totally hate me if I invited someone else to your party?\" \"April Marie Asher,\" She scolded. \"Are you seeing another man?\" \"Oh, my god.\" Megan spoke, her mouth full of wine. \"Are you pulling a Mike Banning on Mike Banning?\" April stopped to give an irritated look to Megan before turning back to Brianna. \"No, I actually wanted to invite Mike's dad.\" \"Wait,\" Megan spoke, moving to sit down on the floor with the other girls. \"Are you serious? I thought Mike hates his dad.\" April quickly looked in the direction of their bedroom, scanning to make sure the door was fully closed before talking again. \"Yeah, but I want him there for the wedding, and I want him to know me before his son commits the rest of his life with me.\" \"I don't know.\" Megan spoke while shaking her head. \"This sounds like a can of worms you don't want to open. You know hardly anything about his dad. What if he's an asshole?\" \"Oh,\" April scoffed. \"How bad can he really be?\" She then turned back to Brianna. \"No matter, their relationship, he's family, and I want him to be there. He's gonna be my father-in-law for Christ's sake.\" April put on her best puppy dog eyes. \"So, Brianna, do you mind?\" Brianna sighed, not liking the idea as much as Megan, but she nodded. \"Yeah, of course, bring whoever you want.\" April squealed with excitement as she leaned forward and hugged her friend. \"But I'm just going to advise you to be careful. You don't know what you're getting yourself into here.\" Megan threw her hands in the air, knowing this was a terrible idea. \"April, don't do it. You don't even know the guy.\" April ignored her friend before nodding to Brianna. \"I will be careful.\" Megan simply rolled her eyes, knowing this was going to be the dumbest decision April had ever made. April joined Mike at their favorite lunch spot. When she walked in, she was glued to her phone, just walking to their usual place. Mike just watched her with a little smile, thinking about what would happen if he was at a different table. When she finally looked up from her phone, she gave him a little smile before leaning forward and giving him a small kiss. \"How are you?\" \"Fine.\" He took a drink of his water before speaking again. \"I went ahead and ordered that turkey pesto panini you like.\" April gave him a grateful smile with a little sigh. \"You're heaven sent.\" \"I try.\" April put her phone down completely before taking a large sip of her waiting Diet Coke. She was starting to feel really guilty about not telling him what she had planned. And the party was tonight. His dad was on a plane right now, and he had no idea. \"So,\" April began while scooting her drink away from herself. \"What would you think about us inviting your dad to the wedding?\" Mike went stiff at his father's name while countless bad memories flooded into his brain. \"I would say that's a bad idea.\" April leaned forward, wanting to understand exactly what it was about his dad. She knew he was a drunk, and that's why Mike went down that road for a while, but she never got the specifics. From what she knew, he had cleaned himself up somewhat. \"But why?\" \"April,\" Mike laughed out while grabbing her hand, looking him in the eye. \"I'm used to my father disappointing me, but I won't have him disappoint you.\" He shook his head at her while giving her another little smile. \"I haven't seen my father in over twenty years, and I want to keep it that way.\" April took a deep gulp while giving him a little smile, wondering if Megan was right. Maybe this was a stupid idea, and she would end up opening more wounds than healing them. \"Just please don't bring it up again?\" April nodded, but she couldn't find herself to say anything. This was going to be an interesting night. Megan walked with April into the airport as April's heals clicked rapidly down the halls. \"Okay,\" April spoke while turning to look back at Megan who was struggling to keep up with her quick, long strides. \"I managed to work it out so Brianna's parents and Mike's dad would arrive at the same time. So, we just have to get them to the hotel, and a car will come to pick them up for the party when it's time.\" \"You know,\" Megan sighed out. \"I can see why you're head of logistics.\" April turned her head to the side, not stopping her pace. \"Thank you?\" \"So, how pissed do you think Mike is going to be when he finds out that you invited his dad?\" \"You're not helping.\" April sang out, finally stopping once they had reached the gate. \"No,\" Megan sighed out while looking up in fake thought, a big smile on her face. \"But I am right.\" \"Honestly,\" April hissed while turning around to look at her. \"Aren't you supposed to be on my side?\" \"No.\" Megan scoffed. \"It's my job to tell you when you're being an idiot. Which you are being.\" All April could do was roll her eyes. Megan just didn't understand what it was like to have some of the most important people in her life no longer around. April wanted to surround herself with all the family she could get even if it was someone Mike seemed to hate. \"Is that them?\" April perked up at Megan's observation, looking to where she was looking. A middle aged man and woman with a two year old. April kind of turned her head to the side. Brianna told her that she had a baby sister, but she had no idea her sister was actually a baby. The young girl was waddling around, holding onto her mother's hand. She had her father's blonde locks. And Brianna's mother, well, you could tell who Brianna looked like instantly. \"Are you, April?\" The man asked. \"I am.\" April told him with a happy smile before leaning forward and shaking his hand. \"You must be Mr. McGarrett.\" April gasped a little bit at his handshake. Wow, he was really strong. She could see how he was in the Navy, and now a cop. April turned to look at Brianna's mother, giving her a warm smile before breaking out of her handshake. \"And you must be Mrs. McGarrett.\" \"Oh please,\" She spoke before letting go of her daughter's hand to move towards April with wide, open arms. \"Call me Gaby.\" She then pulled April into a big hug, April laughing a little about how open she was. She was reminded of her mom a lot in that way. \"Please, excuse my husband,\" She spoke while pulling away from April before giving him a disapproving glance. \"Steven takes a while to open up to people.\" Steven gave her a little eyeroll, but had a smile on his face despite it. April looked down to the little girl, giving her an excited smile. \"And you must be Jordyn.\" The little girl gave her a big smile before shaking her head. \"I Jody, I no baby.\" April let out a little laugh, Gaby looking to her with an apologetic stare. \"Sorry, she's almost two years old and already thinks she's an adult.\" \"She's adorable.\" April defended while shaking her head. When she picked her head up, she saw a man who looked just like Mike walking around aimlessly. She then turned back to Megan. \"Do you mind?\" Megan took a deep sigh, looking right where she was looking. \"Go ahead.\" April took a deep sigh before walking towards him. She could hear Megan behind her talking with the family, but it was just faint since April's heart was pounding in her ears. It was almost like this was her estranged father she hadn't seen in years. She imagined what he would look and be like, and now she was only a few feet away from him. His back was turned to her, causing her to clear her throat before speaking. \"Michael?\" When he turned around, April had to gasp at how much Michael Sr looked like Michael Jr. \"And you're…\" He was struggling to remember her name. \"April.\" She offered. He then snapped in memory. \"April. That's right.\" He looked her up and down, almost like he was judging her, making April look at herself self-consciously. \"So, you're my son's fiancé?\" \"Yes, sir.\" April spoke before closer to him and sticking her hand out. \"It is so nice to finally meet you.\" He simply walked past her, more interested in what was in the airport than with her. April gulped a little, and Megan began to glare in his direction, seeing exactly what he did to April. \"I've never been in Washington DC before.\" His Scottish accent was just as thick as Mike, Daniel and Ainsley's. April's eyebrows furrowed. Then she remembered he and Mike hadn't talked in over twenty years. \"It's great, I'm sure Mike and I will be able to take you on a tour tomorrow.\" April then laughed a little as a thought came to her mind. \"We might even get you some exclusive access in the White House.\" He still seemed uninterested. April now felt like she was in a battle for his attention. Maybe this is what Mike was talking about. Maybe this was what it was like growing up with him. He finally looked back to her, April finding herself frozen that he actually knew she existed. \"So, is there a place I can go to freshen up before the party?\" \"Of course!\" April hurried towards him, and he stepped back a little at her enthusiasm as she looped her arm through his. She was going to make him notice her if it killed her. \"Mike and I picked out a hotel for you to stay at, and you have a few hours before the party to clean yourself up and get used to the time difference.\" Michael Sr then gave her an unsure face. \"Mike knows I'm here?\" \"Well,\" April whispered, not wanting to go into much detail about how she was lying to both her future father-in-law and husband. \"We'll see what he says at the party.\" April was walking around the nightclub as people around her danced, a proud smile on her face at what she had put together. Just then, she felt arms wrap around her neck, panicking her almost instantly. \"Oh, April!\" That was Brianna's voice. \"Thank you so much!\" April smiled, knowing automatically knowing she was thanking her for her birthday present. \"The least I could do is fly your family in after everything you've done for mine, and I want to see my dad squirm around your dad. Are my speculations correct? Is it hilarious?\" Brianna let her go, letting the two girls face each other. \"No. You've done way more than enough already.\" Brianna then looked around the place, the big smile on her face never going away. \"You put this whole thing together, and it's amazing. And yeah, it is pretty hilarious.\" She didn't even give April time to laugh, her eyes getting wide as another thought came into her mind. \"What about Mike's dad? Is he here?\" April looked down at her phone, checking the time. \"He should be here in a few – \" \"April!\" When April looked up at that familiar Scottish accent, she went stiff. Mike, Daniel and Ainsley were all making their way toward her. No. No. This could not happen. She couldn't have them all here when Mike's dad walked in. \"Ainsley!\" April chuckled out before leaning in to hug her future mother-in-law. \"Oh,\" She laughed out while pulling away from her. \"It's 'mum' now. Let me see the ring!\" April turned around to look at Brianna, giving her a panicked smile. \"Brianna, this is Ainsley and Daniel, Mike's mother and brother.\" Brianna's eyes got a little wide at what April had said, realizing the problem. \"Oh, my goodness,\" Brianna spoke while leaning towards them. \"It so nice to meet you two.\" \"Oh,\" Ainsley spoke, moving towards her with a wrapped gift. \"You must be the birthday girl.\" \"Yes, ma'am.\" \"Okay,\" April spoke looking back to Mike, giving him a nervous laugh he turned his head to. There was something going on with her. \"Why don't you two get acquainted, and I'm going to steal Mike away for a moment.\" April didn't waste one second, pulling Mike by the arm and out the door. \"What the hell is wrong with you?\" He asked, completely confused by her behavior. April's hands began to shake as she thought over everything she had just done. This was a bad idea. Like the worst idea she's ever had. Mike noticed her shaking hands, taking them in his instantly, his anger melting away, now only concerned with what was going on with her. \"Hey, what's wrong?\" April's breaths were shallow and quick as she looked everywhere, not really focusing on one thing. \"I fucked up, and you're gonna be so mad at me.\" \"Hey,\" Mike began, April finally looking up at him. He opened his mouth again, ready to talk to her when there was another voice which sent a shiver up his spine. \"Son.\" Mike looked at April, his eyes filling with fire as April tried to plead with him without saying a word. \"So, that's it?\" Mike spoke while nodding. \"That's why you asked all those questions earlier?\" \"Mike,\" April began. \"God, April!\" Mike yelled at her, becoming even angrier by the second. \"You just don't know when to quit, do you?\" \"I'm sorry.\" She pleaded, a few tears running down her cheeks. \"Look, I know your family is dead, but you can't just go and bring in my shit family to compensate for that!\" April gasped, feeling like she had just been punched. And just like that, Mike snapped out of his anger, realizing what he had done. \"April,\" Mike tried as she began to stagger away from him. \"I didn't mean it. I was just mad.\" He tried to go for her arm, but she yanked it away. \"Fuck off, Mike.\" She turned around and hurried off behind the club. Mike took a few steps after her, but he knew he was the last person she wanted to see right now. \"April!\" His father let out a low whistle ending in Mike grinding his teeth together. \"Well, son, looks like you didn't fall too far from the tree.\" \"Fuck off, Dad.\" Mike spoke, trying to restrain himself from punching him in the face. \"Just an observation.\" He spoke innocently while throwing his hands in the air. \"You know,\" Mike spoke, turning around to look at him. \"I haven't seen or heard from you in twenty years, and this is really how you want to come back into my life? A jackass?\" Michael gulped a little bit, finding those words digging a little deeper than he thought they would. He opened his mouth, about to talk to his son, but Mike shook his head at him. \"Save the disappointment for another time. I have to find my fiancé.\" Mike took off where he last saw April run off as his father continued to stand there and watch him, not sure what to do, but he knew he wanted to help his kid for once. April was sitting on one of the discarded crates by the entrance of the kitchen while still gasping from her tears. Megan was outside with her, rubbing her shoulder. April didn't want to bother Brianna. She wanted her to enjoy her party, but Megan wasn't going to buy that April was okay. There was no way she was leaving her side for the rest of the party. Mike came running down the ally, both of the girls standing up at the sight of him. Megan moved in front of him, not going to allow Mike to even come a ten foot radius of her. \"No way.\" She simply spoke while crossing her arms in front of her chest. Mike shut his eyes. How didn't he expect something like this to happen? \"Please, Megan. Just let me apologize.\" Megan shook her head as she looked him up and down. \"I don't think you even deserve to apologize after the shit you just pulled.\" Mike opened his mouth to talk again, but April was coming out from behind Megan. \"It's fine.\" Megan turned to her, irritated. \"I thought I told you to stay back?\" April had to blink at her a couple of times. \"You're not my mom. I'm a grown woman, and I can talk to whoever I want.\" Megan threw her hands in the air while mocking her voice before walking off, leaving just April and Mike. \"Baby,\" Mike began. April's arms were crossed in front of her chest protectively, not sure if she really wanted to listen to him. \"I am so sorry I said all of those things to you, that man…he just makes me crazy.\" April looked him up and down, not totally understanding it. \"I just don't understand how you could hate the man who helped create you so much.\" \"Baby,\" Mike began while letting out a little sigh. \"It's a long story.\" \"Yeah,\" April scoffed while shaking her head. \"That's what you say every time I bring it up. Maybe if you would open up to me then I would have never invited him.\" She looked at how helpless Mike had looked. His dad seemed to turn him into another person she didn't even recognize. \"What the hell did he do to you?\" Mike took in a deep, rounded breath before looking back to her. \"Um,\" April noticed how small he looked in that moment. \"He got drunk, and he hit my mom.\" April bit her lip, really hating herself for inviting him now. \"And then when that wasn't enough, he would hit me, and then eventually Daniel. I was sixteen when he hit Daniel, and then I jumped him, and told him to get out.\" Mike finally met eye contact with April, his eyes getting watery at the memory of it. \"And he did, and I haven't seen him since.\" He shook his head, still not breaking his stare with her. \"And when I saw him…I just thought of that night all over again…and I just…\" April didn't waste any moment after that, she hurried to him and wrapped her arms around his neck. \"I'm sorry I brought all of that up for you.\" Mike had to take a deep breath, finding it hard to believe that after everything, she forgave him. There was that empathy again. He wrapped an arm around her shoulders, loving the feeling of her being pressed against his chest. \"I'm sorry I was such an asshole.\" He whispered before kissing the top of her head. When April broke away to look up at him, the two shared a quick, soft kiss, April taking a deep sigh before speaking again. \"But I swear to god, if you ever talk to me like that again, I'm going to stab you in the chest.\" \"And I would take it.\" Mike told her, nodding in agreement, still feeling awful for those words he said. They shared another quick kiss before going back into a hug. They knew they had a lot of damage control to cover, but they just wanted to spend a few moments like that. Embracing each other like they didn't have a care in the world. Ultimately, they found Michael Sr at the bar, getting a drink as the two stood side by side to confront him. \"Dad,\" Mike began, ending in his dad turning to look to the two, noticing they both had their arms crossed in a business stance. \"First thing's first, answer me truthfully right now if you even want to go to this wedding.\" April stared down Michael Sr, him not really seeing that side of her before. He was already so used to the push over he saw at the airport, but it was like she was a completely different woman. \"Son,\" He began while looking at Mike. \"I know you'll never forgive me for what happened back then, but I do want to be there for you when you marry the love of your life.\" Both Mike and April shared a slightly concerned face before looking back to him. This really wasn't what they expected. \"Then,\" Mike began again, trying to figure out how to turn this all around. \"I expect an apology not just to me, but my mother and Daniel.\" \"Of course.\" His father spoke while nodding. \"And we want you to be sober.\" April cut in, knowing that was her one huge deal besides the apology. \"We can set up for you to go to AA meetings, but if you don't attend the meetings or if you fall off the wagon even once, your invitation will be revoked.\" He took a deep gulp before nodding in agreement. \"That's fair.\" \"And,\" Mike began, not really looking at his father in that moment, knowing this was going to be the hardest condition of them all. \"We'd like to spend some time with you before. Both individually and as a pair.\" Michael Sr got a small smile on his face before nodding to the terms. \"I would like that.\" \"But only sober.\" Mike countered while pointing at him. \"You have my word, son.\" Mike took a deep breath at that word. Since he had come back, that was the first time he heard him say it sincerely. \"Alright.\" Mike spoke with a shrug. April was looking back and forth at them, wanting them to hug so bad. It was like she just needed it. Mike turned to look at her, feeling her eyes on him. \"What?\" He snapped out. April took a deep sigh, knowing they had to work through baby steps before they could accomplish anything. \"Nothing. Never mind.\" The two exchanged numbers with Michael Sr, and began working on days they would meet each other and schedule the meeting with him and Ainsley and Daniel. Michael Sr promised that tomorrow would start his first day completely sober. After he left, they could actually enjoy the party, feeling way better now than when they first started. \"You know,\" Mike spoke as the two danced together. \"You actually kind of fixed things.\" April had to blink a few times at that observation. Was he being sarcastic or sincere? She couldn't tell. \"I fix everything , why are you just now realizing that? You're the one who fucks everything up.\" \"Hey,\" Mike spoke in a warning tone. \"I saved you in the White House, remember?\" April shook her head, finding herself very offended at that moment. \"You saved me?\" He nodded like it was obvious. \"Because the way I remember it, I was saving the world and you were just stabbing a guy in the brain.\" All Mike could do was laugh. He knew Megan and Brianna were going to be pissed at him for a while, but all he cared about right now was that April was still his. \"I love you.\" April nodded while moving her body even closer to his, the two prepared to dance the night away and leave everything bothering them behind. \"I love you.\" stormrunner74: Thank you so much for letting me know I put up the wrong chapter!

","Summary":" TWO YEARS LATER July 4 th , 2015 Mike paced in front of the Oval Office where he knew Ben was doing"},{"Movie":"Cats & Dogs","Title":"Cats and Dogs: Rise of the Pack","Author":"Nightfury991","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9686487","Passage":"[Chapter 1] Note: This is my first Cats and Dogs Fanfic, and it's been a while since I've watched either of the movies; so if I get anything wrong or the character's personality's wrong, I apologies. Chapter 1: A low, whining whistling sound came from the collar of one certain German Shepherd, who had been sleeping in the living room of his new owner's house. The German Shepherd in question woke from the low whistling, groaning lowly as the whistle was for dog hearing only; he covered his ears with his ear flaps using his paws, trying to block out the noise. But after he figured out that the high pitched whistling wasn't going to be quitting anytime soon, he sighed in annoyance and said, \"Alright, alright! I'm up; quit it!\" Diggs got to his paws, and he was relieved to hear that the dog-whistle from his collar had finally stopped, giving his ears a chance to recover from the assault of noise. He stretched his front paws out, stretching his still sleeping muscles out before doing the same to his hind legs. Once he had stretched most of the muscles in his body, he got to his four paws again and looked out of the closed window of his owner's house. \"Oh, c'mon! It's too early!\" complained Diggs, making sure to keep it quiet enough as to not wake Shane, his owner, Shane's wife or their baby; Diggs looked over at the hand clock that hung above the TV in the living room, and confirmed that had just passed seven in the morning. But he knew why the collar had emitted that high-pitched dog whistle sound to wake him up; he needed to head to his kennel, as someone was trying to get in contact with him. He sighed heavily as he slowly padded over to the back door of the house. After spending a few seconds of trying to get the door open, Diggs reared up on his hind legs and put his front paw on the handle, pulling it down as he lowered back down again. He quietly trotted out of the house, and nudged the door close again with his snout, making his way to the kennel at the back of Shane's garden after his closed the door. \"Alright; let's see what's so important to get me up so early,\" muttered Diggs under his breath as he nudged a small panel at the back of his kennel for a second. A light blue light appeared for a second around the panel, before it flipped over, revealing a small red button on the other side. After nudging that, several of the other panels of wood flipped over. Some of the panels had screens on the other side, and a couple of buttons on the other side of a panel below the centre screen. The screen was filled with static for a few seconds, before the screen was filled with the image of Digg's mentor and the Dog Agent that had made himself an Agent in the first place; the old, white Anatolian Shepherd, Butch. \"What is it old timer? I was sleepin',\" said Diggs, yawning after he said that, flashing his pearly white teeth for a second in the yawn. Butch wore an expression that looked like he was annoyed at being called old timer, but Diggs was so used to Butch looking like that, he found it hard to tell what he was trying to show expression-wise. \"You're needed at HQ; debriefing,\" said Butch in his usual gruff voice, before the screen went blank again, turning to static once more before Diggs had a chance to respond. \"Do I get a say in this?\" Diggs asked, though he knew that it wasn't going to get through. Diggs sighed deeply when he got no response; he had to admit that, even though being a Dog Agent was awesome and cool, it did have its downsides. For one, there were the meetings; sure, they were few and far between, they were still the most boring thing, apart from being in the kennels, Diggs had been forced to get through. All they did was establish several things each meeting, and it didn't cause Diggs anything apart from getting bored. \"Fine; I'll go,\" muttered Diggs under his breath, before pressing a paw to one of the buttons, a blue one with 'LAUNCH' written over it. After a second delay, Diggs dropped through the bottom of the kennel and landed in the transporter. Diggs smirked to himself; he always loved this part, even though he was almost sick the first time he did this. \"Yee Haw!\" shouted Diggs as he pushed the speed lever from 'K1' to 'K9.' The engine sudden roared into life and soon, Diggs was travelling at high speed, his transport rocking across the loops, twists and turns that led from his kennel to the dog bowl shaped headquarters that was, D.O.G. HQ. When the transport pod came to a sudden stop, Diggs, his eyes rolling about from the dizziness that was going through his head at that moment, shook his head to try and clear the dizziness. He got out of the pod after the screen opened up, and after staggering a few steps, spotted Butch waiting for him outside the circular, steel reinforced security door that led to the interior of the Dog HQ. \"Thought I'd expect you to turn up next week,\" said Butch sarcastically, though Diggs tried to ignore the comment and padded quickly over to the older and wiser dog; he had grown used to Butch throwing the odd-comment at him, but he said that it was only to motive him to be a better agent than he was a police dog. \"At least I actually turned up,\" said Diggs in response, though there wasn't any fire behind the retort; Butch had also grown used to Digg's cocky attitude and retorts. Butch put his paw on the Paw Scan, and after a brief second, a voice said from the speaker, \"Welcome, Agent Butch,\" and the circular door opened up, revealing the busy interior of Dog HQ. Diggs and Butch walked through the open security door, which closed behind them and made a bee-line for Lou's office. Before they got to Lou's office, when they were about halfway up one of the staircases, a familiar Russian Blue cat suddenly dropped from an overhead panel; landing on her paws, like most felines. \"Hey, Diggs,\" said Catherine, the small, yet highly trained and lethal Russian Blue to the German Shepherd. \"Hey Cat,\" said Diggs, smiling down at the cat; he and Catherine had grown on each other, like an annoying song that eventually won you over. The Russian Blue feline smirked at the canine, her tail flicking behind her as her whiskers twitched slightly; she knew that most of the dog Agents here were still weary of having a M.E.O.W.S Agent in their HQ, but most of them had grown accustomed to seeing this cat in D.O.G. HQ. \"I take it you're here for the M.E.O.W.S/D.O.G. Alliance update Debriefing?\" questioned Catherine, getting straight to the point. Diggs looked at Butch, saying, \"If that's what the debriefing's about, then I guess I will be going to it.\" Catherine chuckled lightly under her breath, her ears flicking slightly. \"Come on, you two; we're going to keep Lou waiting. And you know he wants to get this debriefing over with,\" said Butch, breaking the conversation between them and continuing to slowly walk towards Lou's office. Diggs rolled his eyes and followed behind Butch, Catherine quickly padding lightly beside the German Shepherd. \"Ah, you're finally here,\" said Lou, wearing a sweater that Diggs assumed was sent to the head of D.O.G. HQ by his grandmother. Diggs, Butch and Catherine all entered the office, Diggs gently kicking the door close after him. Lou seemed to wince slightly at the door slamming close, but didn't say anything of it at the moment as Catherine, Diggs and Butch all stood in front of his desk. \"Now, we're here to discuss the Alliance between our two Factions, the D.O.G. HQ and M.E.O.W.S…\" began Lou, and that was when Diggs began to block out the conversation; he would always ask Catherine or Butch what they talked about after the meeting. He could always say that he just wanted a few reminders about the important stuff and all th- A sudden commotion outside the office brought Diggs back to the land of the living, as well as breaking the meeting between the other animals in the office. \"What's going on out there?\" asked Butch to no-one in particular, heading back over to the door and nudging it open. After Butch had just passed through the door, Diggs said, \"Yeah, I'll, uh…go and see what's going on…\" before quickly following behind the older dog. Catherine followed behind Diggs before Lou could say anything against the idea; not that Lou had anything to say, since he got off of the chair he was sat on and followed behind them. What the four animals saw on the lower levels of the HQ caused a mix max of emotions on their faces; for Diggs, an expression of confusion and curiosity; Catherine, a slightly less confused, yet more curiosity look, and for Lou and Butch, they both wore expressions of shock and amazement. \"How…?\" muttered Butch under his breath, while Lou just looked in amazement. \"Uh…who's that?\" asked Diggs, looking at the more experienced D.O.G. Agents. For there, standing just inside the now open security door of D.O.G. HQ, was a canine Diggs had only seen in movies; a Wolf. This Wolf seemed to be in pretty bad shape; covering the body of the Wolf was large cuts, some of which were still slowly dripping blood down his fur. The Wolf, from what Diggs could see, was about through the middle of an average Wolf's life, and had rugged black fur covering his body, with a few streaks of silver running down his back. Though most of the silver was covered, with what appeared to be a set of reinforced chest armour, which extended down his back and his sides. The Wolf was breathing deeply, like he was trying to keep himself from falling out of consciousness; and judging from how his legs were spread slightly to give himself some more support, Diggs thought he was right. The Wolf staggered forward a few steps, the other Dog Agents watching him with a mix of expressions. The Wolf looked up, his nose sniffing weakly as he smelled familiar scents. \"Shadow?\" questioned Lou, asking the question to the Wolf below. The Wolf looked at the four animals, and Diggs saw the piercing icy blue eyes of the Wolf. But he didn't get to look at him for long, as the Wolf suddenly fell to the floor, unconscious.[Chapter 2] Chapter 2: \"Get him to the medical wing; now!\" said Lou, looking down at the lower tier of the HQ. Two dogs, a female Golden Retriever and a male Viarama, quickly padded over to the sides of the Wolf and helped him up to his paws again. They then made their way out of sight of Lou, Butch, Diggs and Catherine. Diggs turned to Lou and asked, \"Uh…who's that?\" But Lou didn't answer him; he quickly moved away from the railing of the upper tier, and quickly padded down the stairs and after the two dogs and Wolf. \"We'll finish this debriefing later,\" Lou said before he made it to the bottom of the stairs, and quickly padded out of sight. Diggs was left confused, and when he looked to his sides to talk to Butch and Catherine, he realized that they were doing their own things; Catherine was on her collar, communication with M.E.O.W.S and Butch had gone down the stairs, and in the direction of Covert Ops. \"What was that all about?\" Diggs asked to no-one in particular, since everyone in the HQ had gone back to their own thing they were doing before the Wolf appeared through the door. He then noticed that no-one was going to answer him, and padded down the stairs. When he reached the bottom, he looked at where the Wolf had been taken before curiosity got the better of him and he began padding towards the Medical Wing of Dog HQ. \"Where're you going?\" asked Catherine, having finished updating for M.E.O.W.S and padded down the stairs and after the Germany Shepherd. Diggs turned his head to look at Catherine, not expecting her to finish with her communications so soon. \"So, what was the conversation about? With M.E.O.W.S, what was that all about?\" asked Diggs, having always been straight to the point and wanting to know things. \"I asked them if they had any intel on any Wolves,\" answered Catherine, her right ear flicking slightly as she looked around, lifting her front paw up and licking it, cleaning her ear with her paw. \"And did you get anything?\" \"M.E.O.W.S doesn't seem to have much intel on any Wolves working with D.O.G.; we only have about three files about Wolves, and two of those are blurred photos. That other file….all that is a 'need to know' basis under the name 'The Pack'.\" \"The Pack?\" questioned Diggs, tilting his head slightly in confusion; even since he had become an Agent, he still had a very little knowledge on most of the stuff that was going down in the HQ. Catherine shrugged a shoulder, saying, \"Hey, my intel on them as well is pretty weak as well. Maybe we should go and have a look to see if we can expand that knowledge?\" Diggs nodded and the two animals made their way to the Medical Wing in the HQ; passing several dogs on the way, and they all seemed to be muttered the same thing; all about the newly appeared Wolf, talking about him like he was something special or had just done something like what Diggs did when he first became an Agent. \"He must he pretty important to D.O.G.,\" commented Catherine idly, also hearing the quiet chatter between the various dog breeds. \"If he's really that important, why haven't I found anything or heard anyone mention anything about a Wolf?\" asked Diggs, to which Catherine replied with a shrug; neither of them knew what was happening, and neither of the two liked it when they had no idea. When they arrived at the Medical Wing, they saw that it wasn't as hectic as they first though it would be like; it still had a quiet, calm atmosphere with a few dogs, acting as Doctors and Nurses, were making sure that all of the Dog Agents were in top health. Catherine gestured to one of the nearest medical room, where a couple of Dog Doctors were inside; and that was when Diggs saw the Wolf that had collapsed on the floor, lying on his side on the bed. When they tried to get into the room, Lou stepped in front of them and said, \"Sorry, guys; no-one's getting in until he's been given the all clear,\" as he looked over through the glass window. Diggs looked through the glass as well, seeing that the Wolf was being hooked up to a heartbeat monitor; the heart rate quite high, though it that was normal for a canine. \"So…you gonna tell us who that guy is or what?\" asked Diggs, tilting his head towards the room with the Wolf in. Lou looked through the glass and at the Wolf on the medical bed, before looking at Diggs and Catherine, both of them wearing equal looks of curiosity. Catherine added, \"Besides, M.E.O.W.S might start asking questions about this if they get wind of this.\" Lou sighed and said, \"I guess it might be in your best interests to know; you might have to come into contact with him sooner or later.\" Lou then turned completely around to face Diggs and Catherine and said, \"This is a Spec Ops Agent Dakota, codename 'Shadow'. And he does kind of prefer it if you call him Shadow instead of his real name. He's one of our best Special Operations Agents, having been a part of the Special Ops unit, 'The Pack' for years.\" \"Woah, woah, woah; back up a little bit. What is this…the Pack?\" asked Diggs, finding all of this interesting, but finding it all confusing at the same time, with 'the Pack' business. \" 'The Pack' are…well, I suppose were, a highly trained collection of Wolves who wanted to assist us when we and the cats were at each other's throats. The Pack were our advantage over the Cats; they got in, got information, and got out,\" said Lou. \"Well, M.E.O.W.S has a very limited information about this 'Pack',\" said Catherine, having to lift her head up higher so she could actually see what was going on behind the glass. \"I wouldn't be surprised; the Pack were very good at keeping to the shadows. Shadow here was one of the best at keeping to the shadows; that's what brought on his code name. But it still doesn't have any explanation….\" \"Doesn't explain what?\" \"Well…Shadow…he's the first Spec Ops from the Pack to return after we sent them on a mission in Canada; we lost radio contact with them almost two years ago, and haven't been able to come into contact with them since,\" explained Lou. A Great Dane then came from the room with the newly named Spec Ops Agent, and said, \"He's stable now; he should be waking up in a few minutes.\" \"Thank you, Simon,\" said Lou, and the other dogs filtered out of the room, leaving the room empty apart from Shadow on the medical bed. Lou then turned to face the two Agents, before saying, \"It's probably a good idea if you stay out here, Agent Catherine; the Pack might not have heard about the Alliance.\" \"I can handle myself against some old Wolf, thank you very much,\" said Catherine, adding a low hiss at the end, trying to etherize her point; and Diggs knew that the Russian Blue could handle herself against pretty much anything. \"I'm just asking you for your own safety,\" said Lou, but he saw that Catherine wasn't going to let him treat her like she was just a kitten. Lou sighed, \"Fine; just try not to make too much noise or he'll notice you.\" With that, Lou gently nudged open the door and entered the room, Diggs following behind him and Catherine getting into the room underneath Diggs. Diggs shivered slightly when Catherine passed underneath him, her tail accidently flicking against the spot her nieces found that tickled him; he watched as Catherine padded lightly across the floor, her confidence radiating off her, like there wasn't even a potentially lethal threat in the room she was about to go into. Diggs kinda liked that sort of personality; though he was…afraid, that Catherine would think differently if he told her that. Diggs was drawn from his thoughts when he saw the Wolf shift his head in his sleep, groaning ever so slightly. Shadow's nose twitched slightly, like he was smelling the air in his sleep. But after a second of the Wolf's nose twitching, Shadow's eyes snapped open, revealing the icy blue eyes again. \"Cat…\" Shadow snarled, lifting his head up and looking directly at Catherine. Shadow snarled at Catherine, making movements to attack her.[Chapter 3] Chapter 3 \"Hey, Wolfy! Back off!\" growled Diggs, stepping in front of Catherine and snarling at Shadow/Dakota, baring his teeth at the Wolf for threatening Catherine. Lou and Catherine seemed quite surprise at the sudden outburst from the still novices Agent towards the veteran Spec Ops Agent. Shadow, mildly surprised when the German Shepherd he didn't recognise snapped at him, quickly recovered and snarled throatily at Diggs, baring his pearly white fangs at the dog. \"Rookie; best you back off,\" snarled Shadow, able to move his upper half so that his front paws were hanging over the side, moving his head forward until his own muzzle and Diggs' were inches apart. The two large canines snarled threateningly at each other, neither one of them looking like they were going to back down from the challenge placed by the other. The tension in the room was heavy; it felt as though a fight was going to break out at any second, should Lou or Catherine even so much as blink. \"Agent Diggs, Agent Dakota; stand down!\" barked Lou, causing both of the snarling canines to turn their gaze to the head of D.O.G HQ. After another hardened glare between Diggs and Dakota or 'Shadow', and another warning from Lou, Diggs was the one to stop first and looked away. \"Sorry, Lou.\" \"Sorry, Sir,\" apologised Shadow, raising a paw up to his forehead and holding it there for a second in a salute. Though he was only able to hold it for a few seconds before his grunted in pain and lowered his forepaw back down. Shadow slowly looked around in the Medical wing room, and slowly asked, \"So…where exactly I am in HQ? And why exactly is there an M.E.O.W.S.in the HQ?\" Diggs could tell by the way Shadow said 'cat' that he didn't really like using the word, like saying it to him was causing a bad taste in his mouth or saying it like it was some kind of swear for a Wolf. \"It's been a while since you've been here, Agent Shadow, so I'll give you a quick debriefing; D.O.G. and M.E.O.W.S. have formed an Alliance ever since Kitty Galore resurfaced. We've kept the Alliance up in case something like Galore happens again,\" said Lou, summoning up the important detail in the two years Shadow had been away with the Pack. \"What?! An Alliance?\" asked Shadow, barely able to believe what the head of D.O.G. HQ was telling him; Cats and Dogs, mortal enemies…forming an Alliance? \"And might I add that I'm glad that you haven't seemed to lost any of your skill since you've been gone,\" added Lou, nodding his head at the Spec Ops Agent, a small smirk forming on his muzzle. \"Wait, wait, wait! How does he know Catherine's a M.E.O.W.S agent?\" asked Diggs, interrupting Shadow before he could say anything in return to what Lou said. Shadow looked over at the German Shepherd; Diggs could tell by the look in Shadow's icy blue eyes that things were still rocky between the two large canines. Shadow said, \"A Pack member has to be able to read those who are around him; identify who's his friends and who's his enemies are just by the aura they're giving off.\" \"But I have another question for you, Agent Shadow; what of the other members of The Pack? Are they still alive, and if so, where is their location?\" Diggs watched as Shadow, since he didn't seem to respond to anyone when they called him Dakota, as the Spec Ops Agent seemed to be hesitant about his answer the German Shepherd noticed that Shadow seemed to be looking at something on his shoulder. Diggs spotted an emblem on the shoulder protection of his chest armour; the emblem was made up of a white silhouette of a wolf, its head up like it was howling at a moon. \"Must be the emblem for the Pack…\" muttered Diggs under his breath, and he could have sworn that he saw Shadow's ear twitched slightly, like he heard what Digg's said. \"They're…still in capture; we were ambushed while on our mission. The unidentified assailant or assailants used the high winds and the blinding snow storm to their own advantage; we never saw them coming. Whoever they were, they had training that matched mine and the other members' own. I only just managed to escape when the time was right; from what I can remember, the others are alive. But I am not sure for how long,\" said Shadow, slowly trying to get to his paws; but when he tried to get up, his legs began to shake violently from the wounds and he collapsed onto the bed again. \"OK, for one; you are in no condition to be going anywhere, especially in the coldness and harsh weather of Canada. And two; when you are to your full health again, I will be sending other agents with you to assist you with this assignment,\" said Lou, his tone leaving no room for arguing, even though Shadow looked like he was happy to start arguing his point right there and then. But Shadow restrain himself from arguing against the head of the HQ, and lowered his head back down to his paws. \"So…how long exactly do you think I'll have to be stuck here until I can get out of here?\" \"Well, from what the Doctor told me, you're injures are mostly flesh wounds, but a few are slightly more serious. Give it about two or three days, though you might be able to move around the HQ after the first day. You will have to wait a few days in HQ before you are allowed to go on the outside again; Doctor's orders, not mine,\" informed Lou, while the devastated Shadow lowered his head down onto his paws again; depressed at the fact that he was stuck inside. \"But what about when I can get out? Who will I be stuck with? Remember, the Pack have always had trust issues; we trust very few, and only those who are closest to us,\" said Shadow, looking over at Lou after a few seconds of silence from the Spec Ops Agent. \"I will try to pick the correct agent for you to be assigned to; thought without resorting to female agents, might I add,\" said Lou with a raised eyebrow, and Diggs could see that Shadow let out a sigh of despair while letting a small smirk to form on his slender, wolf muzzle. \"I can't help it if I'm a hit with the females, Sir,\" said Shadow, a sly smirk coming through as he said that. Diggs almost felt as though he was slightly jealous; when he had tried to hit on the females agents, they just seemed to ignore him and get on with their assigned tasks. And now, there was this Wolf Spec Ops agents that had been gone for two years might he add, was supposed to be a fantastic hit with them? 'No way; I'll have to see it to believe,' thought Diggs, making sure to keep himself quite, since he wanted to hear what was going on between the two senior Agents. \"Be that as it may, you need to recover from your injures; we'll leave you now,\" said Lou, making a slight gesturing with his head for Catherine and Diggs to follow him out. Catherine nodded curtly, following behind Lou as he exited the medical room. Diggs looked at Shadow for a second, who took no notice of the German Shepherd and rested his head on his paws. Diggs then followed the other two Agents out, when Peek suddenly ran over to the three Agents. \"Uh, Lou; we, uh, we've got a bit of problem; our systems are being hacked.\" Lou looked at Diggs and Catherine, who looked back at him with equally surprised looks; before they quickly ran after Lou and Peek as they headed back to the centre of the HQ. When they got there, all of the dogs that had been working were turned and looking at the massive screens that faced the security door; nearly all of the screens had pixels filling it, while the others had what was meant to be on the screen sparking, like it was trying to fight against the hack. \"Who's hacking the system? Is it Tinkles again?\" asked Lou, turning to look at the screens as Peek took over controls again, trying to fight against the hack attacking their system. \"No; no, it's not Tinkles; he doesn't use this frequency. No, this one is real different to what that cat uses,\" answered Peek, tying away at one of the keyboards to try and find the right code to fight against the hack. But it didn't work; the centre and largest screen went blank, and a heavy breathing could be heard coming through the speakers; all of the dogs fell silent as they listened intensely. Diggs wasn't sure if the other dogs could hear it, but he couldn't help but hear a slight metallic tint to the breath. \"So….I do hope that you got my…package?\" came a voice that Diggs hadn't heard before; it was deep and gruff, but there was also a mechanically tint to each word. The vague outline of a canine's head could barely be seen through the shadows surrounding the screen; but the figure didn't come forward anymore, leaving himself in shadows. \"Who is this?\" ordered Lou, but the figure on the screen simply laughed; it was cold and gruff, much like his voice, and again, it had that slight mechanical tint to it. \"Like I would give my identity to you,\" snarled the canine, and some of the dogs back up from the sudden sharpness from the canine on screen. \"I require something; something that you're agents know isn't shared by the many.\" \"I require the files of….Operation Full Moon.\"[Chapter 4] Chapter 4: \"Those files aren't to be handed out; they aren't even meant to exist anymore. I do not know how you know any details of Operation Full Moon, but you are not getting them. I'd rather die than give anyone outside the HQ those files,\" said Lou firmly, all of the dogs in the area at this moment were looking at the screen with the canine shadows at the moment. But the canine on the screen just seemed to laugh darkly at Lou's attempts to sound like he was top dog (no pun intended). The cold, dark laughter seemed to fill all of HQ; reaching every section of the headquarters and sending a slight chill down the spines of all the dogs. \"I might end up having to hold you to your words,\" snarled the canine in the shadows on screen, before the screen went blank for a few minutes. But then, the screen returned to normal as quickly as it had changed to static the first time. \"Any viruses or infections in the system Peek?\" asked Lou, looking to the techno dog as said dog typed away at one of the keyboards. After a few seconds of typing away with his claws, Peek turned to Lou and said, \"No viruses detected; just seems to be a video message, nothing too serious.\" \"Well, just try and get the location of where the source of the message was,\" said Lou as the other dogs turned to get back to what they were doing before the screen turned. Lou then turned to look at Diggs, who had been watching the video message curiously since it came on, and said, \"Diggs, could I have a word with you in private?\" Diggs, snapping from looking at the screen to looking at the Beagle, and said, \"Uh, yeah; sure Lou.\" He then got up from sitting on his haunches to all four of his paws, and followed the head of D.O.G. HQ to his office. When they reached Lou's office, Lou padded over to his desk and pressed a small button on the desk; instantly, the blinds on the windows all closed simultaneously, making the room much darker than it was when the blinds were open. After Diggs closed the door, Lou jumped onto his chair and turned it around to look at the German Shepherd, who was sitting down in front of the desk by now. \"Diggs, I am pairing you together with Agent Dakota,\" said Lou, his tone not leaving room for Diggs to say anything against it. \"What?! No! No, no, no, no! There is no way that I am going to be partnered with… him! I'd rather have us form an alliance with the mailmen! And I don't know if it was apparent to you, but me and him didn't exactly have the best of starts,\" said Diggs, his voice angered at the suggestion that he was going to be partnered up with the annoying and frankly, dangerous, Agent. \"It's not like you have any say in this matter; you are going to be partnered up with Special Operations Agent 'Shadow'. You will just have to….learn to work together,\" said Lou, thinking about the words he was using as he spoke to Diggs. \"Plus, I am sure that Agent 'Shadow' won't like the idea very much either; but he will have to get past that as well as you, and will have to earn your trusts, as will you have to earn his,\" added Lou, staring at Diggs with a glare that would intimidate the toughest of dogs; and Lou wasn't the most intimidating dog either. Diggs held the stare for a few seconds before sighing, saying, \"Fine, fine; I'll work with him. But Catherine and Butch are going to be with me and him as well, right?\" After Lou nodded his head slightly, Diggs let out a sigh of relief; at least he would have a few friends on his side should anything cause an argument to happen between the two of them. \"Good; you and him will need to work together well if we are going to able to rescue the other members of the Pack and Spec Ops Agents,\" said Lou, flashing a gaze to one of the closed windows that was facing the Medical Wing. \"But…but how exactly can we be sure that we can even trust that Dakota? I mean, he's been AWOL for more than two years, and we don't know what happened to him. And after he just suddenly just appeared out of nowhere, we're supposed to instantly take his word for what he said?\" asked Diggs, having found how unexpectedly Dakota had turned up suspicious. \"We don't exactly have anything else to go on for the reason behind Agent Shadow's sudden appearance after a long period of absence. And even though it does seem a bit suspicious considering the circumstances, we don't have any other information on what happened to him in his absence other than his own word,\" said Lou, though there was a slight tiredness in his voice as he lifted a paw up to rub it against his muzzle; a classic sign of fatigue. \"Look, Diggs; I'll change the date of the debriefing and I'll tell you when the new time and date for the meeting is. You might want to get going, back to your person; it's been a lot longer than it should have been since you left, and we have to get you back to your person before they realise that you're missing,\" said Lou, lifting his head up from resting it in his paw for a moment to look at the German Shepherd. Diggs, slightly annoyed that he was being sent back to his owner like he was a pup, nodded slightly before getting to his paws and turning towards the door. After nudging the door open, Diggs exited the office just as Lou pressed the button again and the blinds snapped open again. Diggs made his way to the transport pods; but not before Catherine quickly ran over to him. \"Hey, Diggs,\" she said, skidding to a stop just before the large German Shepherd. Diggs looked down at the Russian Blue and said, \"Hey, Catherine; what's up?\" \"I was just worried about you; you did seem a bit…aggressive towards that Spec Ops Agent back there, and from what I saw, you are usually the type to be aggressive,\" said Catherine, looking up at the German Shepherd with a slightly raised eyebrow. Diggs scratched the back of his neck nervously, and said, \"Uh…well, ya see…he threatened you! And since you're my friend, I couldn't exactly just stand by.\" Diggs swallowed his nerves; he wanted to tell Catherine so badly that he liked her at least more than a friend, but he thought that she wouldn't think the same thing and think of him differently if he told her. Catherine raised an eyebrow at him, before saying, \"Yeah…you do know that I could have easily defended myself, especially since that Wolf was injured.\" Diggs shifted his eyes slightly, saying, \"Uh…just natural reaction?\" This excuse did seem a little far fetch to Diggs, but Catherine seemed to believe him; she didn't ask him any more questions. \"Well, OK then…I need to get back to M.E.O.W.S., so I'll see you later…\" said Catherine, before turning and slowly padding towards another transport pod that was temporary linked to M.E.O.W.S headquarters. Diggs watched her leave his line of sight, and slowly finished the journey to the transport pods. When he arrived back at his dog house, he quickly padded over to the back door of the house, hoping that he still had enough time before Shaun woke up. After a few seconds of struggling with the door, Diggs managed to get it open and quickly slivered through the crack in the door. After silently kicking the door close, Diggs quickly trotted over to his original spot in the living room as he heard and smelt Shaun coming down the stairs. \"Hey boy,\" said Shaun, rubbing the back of his messy hair; Diggs lifted his head to look at Shaun, trying to act as though he had just woken up. As Shaun turned to the kitchen, and Diggs soon smelt the scent of fresh coffee filling the kitchen and into the living room. But before Diggs could smell the sweet scent of bacon that Shaun usually made in the morning, a small, silent buzz went off against his neck; a new tech piece that alerted Agents without their owners hearing. Diggs sighed in annoyance, before quickly and silently getting to his paws and heading into a quieter part of the house so that Shaun wouldn't overhear him. \"Alright, Lou; what's not important enough to not tell me at the HQ, but important enough to tell me just as I get by to my home?\" muttered Diggs to the collar when he reached a quieter room. \" Well, well; it's good to see that you show you're commander respect, Officer Diggs,\" said a voice on the other end of the communications; it wasn't Lou's, but was the voice of Special Operations Agent 'Shadow' Dakota.[Chapter 5] Chapter 5: \"What?! How'd you get my collar ID?\" asked Diggs in anger, though he made sure to keep his voice low as to not attract the attention of the human female upstairs; he didn't exactly want the secret of the Dogs and Cats being able to talk, not to even mention that both species/factions had headquarters that devoted themselves to protecting the humans. \" That's not something that I'm going to tell you, Rookie; Pack's secret. But it doesn't matter at this moment in time,\" said Shadow's voice over the communications, and Diggs heard shuffling over the communications; Shadow must have shifted on the hospital bed to stop some dog seeing he was on some sort of communications. \" I'm just going to lay down a few rules, Rookie; and yeah, I heard what the Head of HQ said. Rule one; don't get in my way. I do things my way, and I don't want some rookie getting in my way. Rule two; you listen to me, and you listen well. And I'm just going to add that you should respect your superior agents,\" said Shadow, making sure not to give Diggs any time to at least try and say that he did try and show the dogs like Butch and Lou respect. \"Hey, I DO show them respect!\" Diggs growled lowly when Shadow gave him a chance to actually talk, but the German Shepherd heard a low sigh of annoyance coming through the communications, muffled slightly. \" Yeah; you REALLY sounded like you show respect to Lou when he said you and I were teaming up,\" said Shadow, and Diggs was startled slightly at this; how did he hear what he said to Lou when he first told him he was going to have to work with Shadow. \"How the heck did you know about that?\" asked Diggs, both in a tone of annoyance and in a tone of curiosity; if it was some sort of upgrade of the Covert Ops sector, he wanted it. \" Just natural Wolf hearing; part of the standard Pack training. Now, I'm going to stay in communications with you, making sure you keep in line,\" said Shadow over the communications, a slight tint of a growl over his voice before the communications were cut. Diggs tried to reconnect the communications, but after a few minutes, it became clear to him that he wasn't what anyone would call a techno wiz, and sighed slightly. After making sure that the collar wouldn't suddenly give himself away, he headed into the living room again and lay down, trying to get some sleep before something should wake him up. \"I suppose I'll have to get used to this,\" muttered Diggs to himself, before Shaun called him from the kitchen; Diggs perked his head up, and after getting even the slightest scent of freshly fried bacon, the German Shepherd was in the kitchen in a second. Meanwhile, way up in the snow covered wilderness of Canada, a figure was fighting against the snow; the blizzard surrounding it made it almost impossible to see other than the outline, and even then it was hard to tell that the figure had the body shape and size of a large canine. The canine's piercing yellow eyes squinted as it looked up, looking around for a brief second before its eyes landed on a small cave entrance that was hard to see, even without the massive snow storm going on. The canine made a bee-line towards the small cave entrance; the canine had to crawl on its belly to get through. Once it had gotten out of the blizzard outside, the canine shook the snow that had stuck to its fur during the storm; but it didn't seem to make much of a difference, since the fur of the canine was a pure white; identical to that of the colour of snow. From the slender form of the canine and the slenderness and length of the muzzle, it was clear that the canine was a female Snow Wolf; her piercing yellow eyes flicking quickly over to the inside of the cave, which looked way bigger on the inside than it appeared to be on the inside. The female Wolf shifted slightly, looking down at her front; covering her chest and shoulders, was a set of reinforced armour, though it was a dirty white that stood out slightly against her fur. On the right shoulder cover of the armour, was a black emblem of a wolf's head with its head up, howling at the moon; it was clear that this Wolf was one of The Pack. The female Wolf flicked her piercing yellow eyes over the interior of the cavern, and they landed on a medium sized entrance to a deeper part of the cavern; a dull, orange light coming from deeper still in the cavern. The female sighed softly, parting her muzzle to sigh and revealing pearly white teeth for a second, before she slowly trotted through the gap, which she could easily fit through without any trouble. She walked down a narrow cavern, lit by but a few candles every ten or so meters. The further down the narrow cavern she went, the wider it began to get; a few more candles started filling up the gaps of darkness between the main ones. Another thing that changed from earlier was that there were other wolves; some of who were wearing a similar set of armour to the wolf furred she-wolf; though these wolves had either dirty white, midnight black, dark brown and even a few very dark, almost blood red for some of the more battled hardened wolves. Each of the wolves wearing a set of reinforced armour had a howling wolf emblem on the armour covering their shoulder, the colour in contrast with the colour of the chest piece. The other wolves that weren't donning armour of The Pack weren't doing nothing; these wolves, who seemed a bit weaker when they were compared to the muscular wolves with The Pack armour, were moving around large wooden crates. From some of the open tops of the crates, several plates of metal were sticking out, while others had some sort of futuristic looking weapons sticking out, which a human would say looked like plasma guns. The she wolf looked around, her eyes lingering on the weaker wolves that were forced to move the crates around that looked simply too heavy for them to move; but after a few of these weaker wolves noticed that the she wolf donning one of The Pack's armour, they quickly scrambled to drag one of these crates off. \"They've learnt to fear us,\" the she wolf muttered to herself in a sigh, before she quickly shook her head and returning her expression to that of an expressionless face. She looked around the nearly impossibly large area, they seemed to be able to comfortably fit at least two of the D.O.G. HQs, with quite a large bit of room to spare. The walls of the large underground den was made of rough rock, and had a few large holes, to allow the circulation of air to continue. Her eyes finally landed on the central control system at the centre of the large underground den; it was suspended at the top of the large abyss by several walk ways connected to the ground surrounding the abyss. The she wolf slowly padded towards one of these bridges connecting the central control system, and slowly padded over one of the light grey metal coloured bridges. She bows her head slightly at the wolf that was at the central control system; though nothing of the wolf could be seen, as it was covered in shadows, and it had its back to the she wolf. The sound of switches flicking slightly came from the canine in the shadows. \"All is going according to plan, Sir,\" said the she wolf, looking up at the back of the head, or at least where she thought the head of the wolf should be in the darkness. The softest sound of head turning followed the she wolf's voice, and a gruff, robotic tinted voice replied to her. \"Good; the dogs will eventually give in, and then…we will take our revenge. I must remember to thank you, Juliet.\" The she wolf dubbed Juliet lifted her head up, and she asked, though her voice had a slightly timid tone, \"T-Thank me, Sir?\" \"Yes; you have been loyal to the cause, much like the other wise ones. Those that have not…let us just say, they would have wished they listened to their Alpha. But you, Juliet, have been one of the loyalist; that is the reason why I have made you my Third in Command,\" said the robotic tinted wolf; this was the same canine in shadows that had contacted D.O.G. HQ to give them the 'Operation Full Moon'. Juliet looked up fully at the wolf in shadows, startled as she stuttered, \"T-T-Third in Command? As, your Third in Command?\" A low, gruff laugh came from the shadows surrounding the wolf, but it was light and seemed to be much friendlier. \"Yes; though your brother will still be my Second in Command. Speaking of our comrade, have we had any communications with him?\" Juliet lowered her head again, a sad aura coming from her. \"N-No…we haven't had any communications with my brother since he was deployed. Though I have to admit, uh, Sir, you, um…could have lessened the injures on him…j-just a little…\" Juliet timidly lowered her head, hoping that she had not displeased the wolf in the shadows. A silence followed for a short period, before the Wolf in the shadows said, \"I needed to make it look real; didn't hold back, though those mutts might have fallen for it even if he had turned up uninjured.\" Juliet nodded quickly, hoping that she still hadn't offended him. \"S…Shall I go, Sir?\" she asked timidly, though she flinched slightly when the wolf in the shadows shifted slightly. \"Yes…you have done your duty for the day; rest.\" Juliet nodded, slowly getting to her paws again and padding back over the connective bridge. \"Your brother will return, Juliet; he will get the job done. That is who he is; he's loyal to The Pack, his family,\" said the canine in the shadows as Juliet walked away; the she wolf turning her head around to look at the shadows, and nodded slightly. Juliet then retired to one of the slightly larger dens within the massive underground den; she looked around, taking note of the fresh bed of sticks and straw that had been placed there by the weaker working Wolves. She sighed softly, before padding over to the bed and lying down; she curled up into a ball, resting her head on her front paws and curling her tail around so that it gently rested on her muzzle. \"Please come back soon, Dakota….You're the only one he trusts enough to tell his plans for all this…\" whispered Juliet to herself, before she slowly closed her eyes, drifting off to sleep.[Chapter 6] Chapter 6: \"Alright Diggs; fetch!\" said Shaun, throwing a tennis ball across his garden; the named German Shepherd in question barked and ran after the ball. Diggs jumped into the air and caught the ball while it was still in the air. It was about midday on a Saturday, a few days since Diggs had had any kind of call or communications from D.O.G.; though Catherine had come over to his owner's house once or twice during that time when M.E.O.W.S. hadn't had anything going on. But back to today; while Diggs was chewing on the tennis ball, Shaun got a bleep from his pager and looked at it. He sighed heavily as Diggs returned with the tennis ball; the German Shepherd tilting his head slightly when he looked up at his owner's expression. \"Sorry Diggs; looks like I'm needed,\" said Shaun, crouching down to ruffle Digg's head. \"I'm getting called it to investigate something; can't really bring ya along.\" Diggs whimpered softly, lowering his head slightly as his ears drooped; he always hated it when his owner had to go out with the other Chicago policemen, and probably some of the other police dogs that teased him for a long time. Boy, would he show them if they knew what he was… \"Oh come on; don't be like that. I'll try to be back as soon as I can, OK?\" said Shaun, ruffling Digg's ears before he got to his paws again and headed into the house. He paused for a brief second to collect his police badge, clip it to his belt and grab his jacket. \"Honey, bring Diggs back in in a bit, please?\" said Shaun as he headed to the front door, opening it before pausing so he got a response from his wife. \"Alright!\" \"Thanks!\" said Shaun, before closing the door behind him. A few seconds later, Diggs heard the deep rumble of Shaun's car starting up and the screech of tires against tarmac, and Shaun and his car was gone. Diggs sighed, before spotting the tennis ball that he had dropped when Shaun had left. He was about to pounce of the tennis ball before he felt a slight buzzing against his collar; he relaxed his muscles and sighed in annoyance, saying, \"Come on!\" in annoyance. Why did D.O.G. have to contact him, after a few days of silent comms no doubt, at this time? Then again, it was better than if Shaun was still there. \"Yeah, what?\" Diggs asked rather rudely, not bothering to check who was on the other end of the line. He got an unhappy shock when he heard the slight growl that belonged to the one canine that he really didn't want to talk to right now; Shadow. \" What did I say about showing respect, Rookie?\" snapped Shadow from the other end of the communications, causing Diggs to flinch slightly at the sharpness of the Wolf's tone. He growled lowly back down the communications, but let Shadow have the communications in case he had useful to say. \" Anyway, this isn't just a social call; I overheard Lou sayin' he's going ask you to come to HQ. Why don't you be a good little pup and come to HQ before the Head has to call you,\" said Shadow, putting empathises on when he said 'pup'; this cause Diggs to let out a low warning growl, before abruptly cutting communications with Shadow, and grumbled slightly as he headed to his dog kennel. When Diggs arrived at HQ, he pressed his paw against the paw scan and the security door slowly opened up. He walked into D.O.G. HQ, and the first thing he saw was something that partly shocked him and caused part envy in him; while Butch was waiting officially for Diggs, Shadow, who was now completely healed, was talking to a female Golden Retriever; she was giggling lightly and gently bashed her paw against Shadow's shoulder. What caused Diggs to spite Shadow more was that what he had said to Lou was actually true; Shadow was a hit with the females. Diggs growled ever so softly, before quickly silencing it when Butch glared at him. \"Shadow,\" said Butch in his usual gruff voice, and the Spec Ops Agent turned his head, saying something to the female Golden Retriever, before heading over to stand next to the old dog. \"Now, Diggs; we've got some intel about some rouge cats in New York,\" said Butch, walking with Shadow and Diggs, the German Shepherd making sure to stand on the opposite side of the older Shepherd to the Wolf. \"What do a couple of cats have to do with my searching for my Pack?\" asked Shadow, a confident aura coming off of him that Butch didn't glare at him when he had interrupted him. This only caused Diggs to hate Shadow even more; he had taught him to respect his senior agents, and yet he was talking to him like he was equally in agents. But Butch didn't complain when Shadow interrupted him, and continued on. \"Our sources tell us that these cats are supplying dangerous supplies over a feline black market; cat nip, weapons, and a few other supplies that we aren't sure about; but we aren't going to wait to find out what they are supplying.\" Butch, Shadow and Diggs then arrived at the Covert Ops section of the HQ; Peek, as per the usual, was working and tinkering away at some of the technology he must have been working on for a while now; a few sparks flew as he welded what appeared to look like an updated collar, but he was safe since he was wearing a welding mask. \"No,\" said Shadow, his tone simple and sudden; both Diggs and Butch looked at him when he said that. \"There is no way that I'm wearing one of those collars; I'm proud of my heritage, and I won't be demeaned by such a… human creation.\" \"What? Afraid you'll be laughed at?\" said Diggs cockily as he took a step closer to Shadow; the Spec Ops Agent raised his hackles and bared his teeth at Diggs, a low growl ripping out from his throat. Butch glared at the two canines, silently ordering them to be quiet. \"Alright, Peeks; what new tech have you go for us?\" asked Butch as he approached the smaller dog; Peek turned around to face the three bigger canines and flipped the welding mask up to look at the canines directly. \"Yeah, OK; I've got a few new toys for you guys to have,\" said Peeks, before jumping off the stool he was sitting on to do the welding, and headed over to one side of the Covert Ops section; the three larger canines following the smaller dog. Peek pressed a button on one of the tables, and three collars came up from the table. \"Diggs, this is your updated collar; plasma laser, voice scrambler, wifi, lock pick, grappling hook, smoke pellets for quick escapes,\" said Peek, the gadget for each of the things he mentioned coming out from the small panel that covered them, and Diggs smiled, saying, \"Sweet.\" Peek then moved onto the next collar, saying it was for Butch and went through the procedure again as Diggs grabbed the collar and slipped it over his head, making sure it fit; it fit perfectly. He looked over at Shadow, who had wondered off slightly and was examining some piece of tech that Peek had been working on. \"And this is yours, Agent Sha-Shadow?\" asked Peek, noticing that Shadow wasn't standing with the other two larger canines; and he wasn't even in the room anymore. Diggs, Peek and Butch looked around, repeating his name a couple of times. But when Diggs noticed the flick of a black and grey furred tail walk out of sight of the glass. \"Where's he going?\" asked Diggs to himself, before he quickly trotted out of the Covert Ops section; Butch quick behind him as Peek went back to tinkering with more mechanics. Diggs and Butch eventually found Shadow in front of a large metal door that Diggs hadn't seen in HQ before; it was at least as tall as the security door at the front of the D.O.G. HQ, though was square in shape and had the massive emblem of The Pack embedded into the metal. Shadow placed his paw onto a paw scan next to the door, and a mechanical voice said, \"Welcome, Special Operations Agent Dakota,\" and the door split into two, opening up for Shadow. The Wolf walked in and Diggs walked over to the still open door; Butch followed behind him, though there wasn't the air of curiosity coming from him that was coming off of Diggs. When the German Shepherd looked inside, his lower jaw fell open and he said, \"Wow..\" like the first time he had seen D.O.G. HQ. Inside, the walls were black with light grey streaks of metal running along the sides of the room. The walls of the room were lined with a few items; all of them more dangerous than the last. Shadow was standing in front a set of metal paw covers. Shadow grabbed one of the paw covers, and attached it around his front ankle; it lowered onto his paw, and covered his paw. After a quick tense of the muscles, three metal claws came out from the metal paw cover. Digg's eyes widened as he saw the claws extend for the metal paw cover, and as they retracted into the cover; he heard a sight grunt of pain come from Shadow as the claws appeared to sink deeper than the metal cover, and into the actual paw of the Wolf. Shadow repeated the procedure with his other front paw, and got the same reaction as he did with the first paw. He walked over to another couple of items, some of which went into small pouches that were part of the chest armour he was wearing, before he noticed that Diggs and Butch were standing outside the room. He just looked at them for a second before grabbing what looked like a small ear piece and put it into his right ear after setting a frequency to it. \"Well, what are we waiting for? Let's get going,\" said Shadow, walking towards the door for the room, which closed after him. \"Alright; we've all got our tech, we'll get going to the Big Apple. Our contact in the Big Apple'll be meeting us at the drop off point,\" said Butch, leading Shadow, and a rather quiet and jealous Diggs that looked over Shadow's elite equipment, to the international transport pods. I'm going to need some ideas for Pack agents and D.O.G./M.E.O.W.S. Agents that they're going encounter. So, leave suggestions in reviews or in PM's. As always, please R&R; Nf991[Chapter 7] Chapter 7: The high speed journey from the D.O.G. HQ to Manhattan, New York was relatively quiet and boring; the transport pod that Agent Butch, Agent Diggs and Special Agent Dakota 'Shadow' were in was large enough so that the three canines had their own personal space; but they didn't have anything to occupy them while the pod was transporting them. They had tried the radio that was included in the pod, but there wasn't anything on that was worth listening to. But after another five minutes, the pod began to slow down before suddenly grinding to a halt, that was so sudden that it caused Diggs to get flung from one side of the pod to the other; Butch and Shadow had the sense to dig their nails into the floor of the pod, which was much easier for Shadow as he had the metal claw extensions. Diggs grumbled as he got to his paws, shaking his body all over to try and get the fur right again, before the side of the pod opened up and the three canines walked out of the pod; Shadow holding back to let the Dog agents go first, before following behind them. They walked into what looked like the interior of an abandoned building; it had a few of its windows covered up with wooden boards, and the doors that had been inside the building had been ripped off from their hinges and were now covered partly with pieces of old cloth that hug from the roof of the doorframes. \"Man, HQ doesn't do the best to try and find the best locations to use as drop off points?\" Butch glared at Diggs for his reaction, but Shadow just plain ignored the German Shepherd; he sniffed the air slightly, taking a few steps forward as he began to mutter to himself, words that Diggs was only just able to hear. \"Hmm….Three years of age….Female….Golden Retriever….\" muttered Shadow, sniffing the air lightly as he moved around the small room they had arrived in when the transport pod had stopped. He walked over to one of the cloth covered doors and suddenly pushed it to the side. On the other side of the cloth stood a female Golden Retriever; her bright green eyes flicking slightly when the cloth was suddenly pushed to the side. \"Hmm…well, I can see that you have impressive senses; especially since you can smell my scent when I have blocked my scent,\" said the female Retriever, making a slight nod to Shadow before she padded forward to meet Diggs and Butch; she didn't take note at first that Shadow wasn't a Dog. \"Agent Manhattan, aka, Agent 159; HQ said I should be ready to expect a few arrival, sent here to assist me with dealing with these rouge cats,\" said the female that called herself Agent Manhattan as she shook her paw with Butch's own one, before shaking her paw with Digg's. \"Yes, Agent Manhattan; we heard you got a bit of intel of these rouge cats,\" said Butch as the two agents began to move to the doors out of the building; Diggs and Shadow following behind the other two agents, trying to avoid looking at each other. \"That would be correct, Agent Butch; the cats had been supplying illegal weapons and cat nip to different contacts around the world; Chicago, Virginia, China, Japan, British Isles….Though there does seem to be one contact in particular that has been taking in quite a lot of their supplies; this contact seems to be centred around a random spot in Canada,\" said Manhattan, but she was cut short before she could say anything else when Shadow quickly shot forward to stand in front of the two senior D.O.G. Agents. \"Did you say Canada?\" he asked, glancing from Manhattan to Butch every few seconds before shifting his gaze to look back at the other. Manhattan cast a gaze over to Butch, as though she was silently and telepathically asking him a question, before she looked over to Shadow, and after clearing her throat softly, saying, \"Yes; though we haven't be able to locate the actual precise location of the source. Though we are working on finding the location…\" Though Manhattan tried off at that point when Shadow turned and began towards the way out of the building. The three canine agents followed Shadow out. Though Manhattan took the lead after they had got out of the building and the loud sounds of New York nearby could be easily heard. \"Easy there, tough guy; this ain't the same place you're from. This 'ere is the Big Apple; and they don't take too kindly to strays. At least, that's what they'll think of you. So we gots to be careful,\" warned Manhattan sternly, putting a paw on Shadow's armour covered shoulder, showing for him to stay where he was. Shadow looked down at Manhattan's paw and said, \"I've already got the stealth aspect covered, Mrs Yank.\" He then took a step back before looking at the others and pressing a paw against one of the small buttons on the armour around the base of his neck. Instantly, a slight rippling covered his body before he disappeared from view completely; like he had vanished from the face of the Earth. The three canines blinked in surprise, before Diggs took a step forward and waved a paw over where Shadow was a few seconds ago. After getting no response, he said, \"Uh….what happened to him?\" He got his answer, not by Butch or Manhattan; but from a paw pressing against the side of his neck and pushed him onto his back, pinning him down to the ground. \"Standard bit of Pack kit; Chameleonic 5000,\" said Shadow voice without a visible body from over Diggs, as the German Shepherd felt the pressure of a paw lift off from his neck and shoulder. Diggs quickly got to his paws again before growling lowly, looking around all of the area of the alley they had walked into, saying, \"Don't do that again; I'm a trained Police Dog.\" A slight laugh came from near a couple of trash cans that was identical to Shadow's. \"Oh, I already know that, Officer Diggs; managed to get a glimpse at your files when I was stuck in HQ. But I wouldn't suggest telling Butch or Manhattan about this…\" came a whisper voice right next to Digg's right ear; it took all of the Shepherd's sense to not flinch back and snap at where he thought the Special Operations Agent was. Though he knew better than to make himself look like an idiot in front of two senior Agents, and held his tongue. He thought tom himself that he would get Shadow back later on, when it was just the two of them or Butch and Manhattan were out of sight…. \"Alright; come on. I'll lead you to the location; just remember to stay to the alleys and don't wander into the streets in you can help it,\" said Manhattan, before she took off down the alley, turning a corner and out of sight. Butch and Diggs, who assumed that Shadow was somewhere around them, followed behind the New York agent of D.O.G.S. They had to make sure that they were trotting in alleys that didn't have any humans in it; Manhattan had warned them about pound catchers, and since Diggs didn't want to have any sort of memories about what he had to go through when he was younger, the German Shepherd took extra care to avoid walking into any alleys that had humans in it. While the three visible canines used their stealth training to stay to the shadows, they had no idea where the fourth member of their group was. Shadow had stayed invisible, and they could only imagine that they were being followed by The Pack Agent; only knowing that he was still there by the odd bit of rubbish getting moved by what was thought to be a paw or the slight sound of light panting coming from either side of the three canines. They eventually arrived at what looked like an abandoned building that was on the very outskirts of the hub of New York, and by this time, they were far from any sort of human being. Yet when Diggs and Butch looked up at the building, they saw that there were a few humans at the front gates of the abandoned building. \"They've been brainwashed by some kind of Cat tech; I haven't had a close enough look at it to figure out what it is without getting caught,\" explained Manhattan as she led the other canines around the side of the building. \"Alright; we'll take care of them in a minute, once we've sorted out these cats,\" said Diggs, though he made sure there weren't any cats watching them. \"Let's do that,\" said Butch, using his lock pick accessory on his collar to pick the door open before he and the other canines quietly walked into the building.

I've only just gotten round to finishing it and posting it x Please read and review x I know Cheryl is out of character, but I wanted to play with her as a bit sarcastic (in the original edit of this, she was a lot sweeter and naive, and this wasn't written in first person - so please tell me if I've neglected to change one of the tenses) x \"And that means this year's winner is Miss Rhode Island! Cheryl come on up here!\" My mouth dropped open and I choked slightly. I couldn't believe this! I was Miss USA! I gaped for another moment before realising my mouth was unattractively open and hesitantly stepping forwards to receive my crown, hoping that this wasn't a dream. Out of the corner of my eye I could see Gracie struggling to reach me - to congratulate me! The crowd was applauding loudly and I couldn't stop smiling. Wait until my friends heard about this! And my parents! I'd shown them all - quite literally. At the edges of my mind I could hear the music and the crowd, singing loudly - the song I'd sung so many times, praising the unnamed Miss USA. Only this time I was Miss United States! Was I dreaming? I was about two minutes away from complete and utter hysteria, or perhaps a nervous breakdown. Could you get a nervous breakdown from sheer excitement? At this rate I would find out in a minute. I made my way forwards, quivering with excitement as the crown was placed on my head. In a moment I thought I would leap off the stage in exuberance or make a fool of myself on live TV. No, that couldn't happen - especially not now I'd been named Miss United States. If I did that I'd never manage to live my humiliation down. Walking in a straight line was critical - and luckily something I'd practiced. Probably more than I should - but it was never too much for a Miss United States girl, particularly one who was actually Miss United States. Out of the corner of my eye I could see Gracie mouthing something to me and I was honestly touched that she cared so much. Gracie had been so nice to me, nicer than anyone had been in a long time. I trusted her. Gracie continued forwards, struggling to reach me, an odd look on her face and a panicked look in her eyes. I shook my head at her, indicating I couldn't hear her. She struggled harder. Feeling bad, but knowing I would talk to her later, I turned my back on her and looked into the cameras, giving one of my carefully practiced smiles. I was elated that I'd had the chance to use this particular one - the one specially designed for this occasion, had it ever come to pass. It had. I couldn't stop smiling. She looked panicked now - serious. And with a flying leap she swung forwards and wrenched the crown off of my head, tugging at my carefully styled hair as she did so. I wanted to cry out in pain but I couldn't say a word - not now that Gracie had betrayed me as well. I'd thought I could trust her, but she'd shown that she was the same as everyone else, willing to betray me when it suited her. Even knowing it was futile I reached out for the crown that had been snatched away from me. I was close to tears - but not yet. I would not humiliate myself any further on national television. Just as I turned away to leave, there was a loud explosion that shook the stage and I found myself toppling to the ground and landing with a harsh thud. I cried out in pain as I fell. Looking blindly in the direction of the explosion I could see thick grey smoke billowing not too far from me and that Gracie had also been knocked to the ground, the crown evidently knocked from her hands. \"Gracie?\" I wasn't heard over the hysterical screaming of the other girls. \"Your crown was a bomb!\" Miss California screeched. My crown was a what? \"A bomb?\" I gasped. \"It...it just exploded.\" That's what bombs usually did. \"Gracie saved your life.\" Maybe that was why she'd taken the crown. But how had she known about the bomb? Why would she willingly take a bomb off of me? I looked over at her as she screamed hysterically. \"Eric? Eric!\" Who was Eric? Even as I wondered, a face popped up over the balcony, ash covered. Gracie sagged in relief before straightening again. \"Throw down my stuff!\" What stuff? \"Wait a second Hart!\" Hart? 'Eric' threw down a small bundle of things in black leather. Gracie pulled out a pair of handcuffs and launched herself at Miss Morningside. What on earth was going on? \"What are you doing?\" Miss California gasped. She didn't get a reply. As Miss Morningside was ushered from the room by Gracie, a pair of handcuffs clipped to her wrists and an outraged expression painted onto her face, a group of men in blacks suit swarmed into the room like bees, ushering the girls out of a separate door into a side room that opened out onto the front doors. Out of the room came the blaring of sirens as a few of the suited men walked so they were visible to all of the groups. \"Calm down, calm down ladies!\" They shouted to the hysterical room. What was going on? I couldn't tell - I was too dazed by the explosion, examining the soot and ash on my arms, trailing up in twisted patterns. I supposed I was in shock - that was what it felt like and I felt that I looked like someone off Holby City or another medical problem when they diagnosed someone with a similar condition. \"Calm down?\" Miss Texas screeched, looking positively dishevelled. In fact most of them did - a fact that was thought by many to be impossible for any contestant in the Miss United States pageant. \"Calm down miss.\" \"Can you explain what's going on?\" \"What's happening?\" \"Why did my crown explode?\" With my question the entire room burst back into fresh hysterics. \"Ladies!\" The man looked ready to snap at us - a bunch of girls who were inclined to reach a pitch unheard of until now. \"What's happening?\" I repeated for someone. \"I'm Agent Johnson from the FBI,\" the man introduced. \"The FBI?\" What was the FBI doing at a beauty pageant? As if answering their unasked question Agent Johnson continued. \"We received intelligence that a bomb was due to be detonated at the Miss United States pageant. We did what we could to gain control over the situation and are currently finishing off resolving it.\" \"Is that why Miss Morningside was being taken away?\" I asked. \"Yes Miss. She was responsible for organising the threats, impersonating a famous terrorist as she did so.\" \"So she's gone?\" Miss Hawaii repeated for clarification. \"For impersonating terrorists?\" I decided not to remind her about the bomb. I already had a headache. \"She will be sentenced and jailed.\" All of the girls gasped dramatically, and one at the back - I couldn't see who - actually fainted. It seemed it was too late for my poor head. Miss Texas, who had calmed down slightly, interjected, \"What do you mean you had control of the situation? This was a risk to our lives! Why did you not cancel the pageant?\" She looked as though she couldn't believe she'd actually said that, but knew that her life was more important than her hair-do. Another few of the girls breathed in sharply, as though in a cliché movie. I wondered how they were all so vain. \"Very good question ma'am. We had an Agent on at all times.\" An Agent? We'd had a secret Agent hanging around for days? I had to admit, under any other kind of circumstance, that would've been very interesting - even cool. \"Who was this Agent?\" Agent Johnson hesitated for a moment, looking as though he was considering telling us. He glanced back at us and visibly did a double take. I looked over my shoulder to find every other girl from the pageant fluttering their eye lashes at him as though we were camels in the desert. \"Ladies. Wait a minute - I've no doubt you'll find out soon.\" What did he mean? Interrupting our interrogation of him was a short burst of static, that had him flinch violently, along with the other Agents in the room; who had - until now - been both soundless and motionless. The girls all winced and one screamed. I resisted the urge to turn around and yell at them all to go home. I wanted answers not hysterics. It seemed I couldn't have both. Then again I had entered a beauty pageant. I hadn't expected them to be the Brains of Britain. I supposed I wasn't either - but Gracie had made me feel like she mattered at least. Gracie. Gracie! Where was Gracie? I zoned back in, out of my frantic musings, barely restraining myself from rushing out of the door to find my new best friend, to hear Johnson to reply to a question he'd been asked through his earpiece - what had caused the static. \"They're all fine. Are you sending yourself through?\" He received an inaudible answer - well inaudible to the rest of us. He gestured to the doors which swing open and Gracie walked through, having (what looked like) kicked her way out of her heels, and grasping tightly to the arm of 'Eric'. He flashed us what he obviously thought was an award winning grin - not that he'd had half as much practice as many of the girls gathered here. \"Hello ladies. I'm Agent Eric Matthews from FBI New York.\" Miss Texas gasped. \"Wait a minute. You were on the balcony for Gracie that one time!\" He winked. \"You had an FBI Agent on your balcony and you didn't tell us?\" The girls sounded outraged at this deprival from gossip. Well it was nice to see some of the girls already bounce back. Glad to see they weren't easily affected by small things like bombs. I was expecting Gracie to tell us that it was because she didn't known he was an FBI Agent, but she didn't say anything of the sort. Instead she seemed to blush faintly and her fingers flexed as though to hold onto him tighter. Johnson slowly edged his way out of the jam-packed room, despite leaving the other suits spread out around the edges. \"Girls! Girls. You need to listen to me.\" \"We're not doing anything but.\" Gracie took a deep breath. \"My name is actually Grace Hart. I work in New York as an FBI agent.\" The girl who had shrieked fainted. Gracie smirked faintly. \"I wasn't expecting that.\" She looked at me, slightly white under the soot, and nervous looking. I couldn't help but stare incredulously at her. I supposed that explained why she was willing to take the bombs off my hands - literally. Miss Hawaii gaped. \" You're a secret agent?\" \"FBI agent. There is a slight difference.\" Gracie - Grace - had seemed to recover a bit of the colour in her cheeks and gave another smirk. \"I don't believe it.\" Gracie reached under her dress, pulling the hem up, and then pulled out a leather strap, flicking out her badge and flashing it at us. She replaced it before taking out her gun and twirling it on her index finger, sliding it back into the holster after a few seconds. She hadn't let go of Eric's arm. I thought it was quite sweet. And I'd tell her that. As soon as I finished off telling her off for not telling me she was a secret agent. You couldn't just spring things like that on me. (Or Stan Fields. He was far more likely to have a heart attack.) ","Summary":" I've had this half written for ages - since I first watched the film about back in May.

Hoping that Hart's annoying qualities will cancel out with her return to fieldwork turns out to be the kind of wildly unjustified optimism Sam never should have indulged in: Hart unbridled is irritation squared. She's late to briefings, she chews with her mouth open, she snorts when she laughs, she has way more supermodel friends than any sane person should, she has a horrible habit of getting investigation insights at three a.m. and calling Sam to share them at once, she forgets to do paperwork until it's overdue, her desk is a mess and her car always stalls. Her taste in stakeout music is a case for justifiable homicide if Sam ever saw one. Sometimes Sam thinks that any day spent without murdering Hart is enough for her to be made into a saint. Gracie also takes Sam's ugly, snapping anger like it's a thunderstorm, something beautiful and blameless, and meets it with anger of her own, never once backing down. Gracie laughs too loudly, but always gets the joke. Gracie's three a.m. ideas tend to lead them to the craziest places, but pay off most of the time. Gracie can cut down any asshole too big for his shoes with a line so sharp he's left looking for his dignity on the ground before she even closes her mouth; it saves Sam mountains in paperwork for the unavoidable violence she'd otherwise commit. Gracie takes Sam home to her cluttered apartment for awful TV dinners but buys ice cream by the ton for dessert, and lets her just sit quietly and let everything dissolve into comfortable white noise. They solve fifteen cases in their first month together; Chief stops looking at Sam like she's something the cat dragged in and assigns them harder and harder tasks, and sometimes smiles in the way that makes Sam want to stand to attention. Gracie matches her stride for stride and punch for punch and smile for smile, and if somebody tries to pry her away Sam will probably have to make sure they never find the body. Sam is just rounding the corner when it happens. Nothing should happen, it's not even an arrest, only chasing down one of their scattered leads, talking to somebody who might or might not lead them to somebody else. So Sam stays by the car to talk to the Chief, and when she catches up, she's thirty steps away, and the guy sees Gracie, raises his gun and fires. Sam sees everything at once – Gracie flying backwards, the perp's open mouth, her own gun snapping up – all in complete deafening silence. She drops him with one bullet, calls backup without hearing a single word she says. Everything is fragmented like snapshots: here she's where she is, then she's at Gracie's side, then her hands are tearing at Gracie's shirt collar. She can't see the blood. The sounds snap back in and she hears her own voice, Gracie, Gracie, Jesus fuck, Gracie, don't do this to me, please, please don't, Gracie, sweetheart , and then Gracie sucks in air and coughs, and everything stutters to a stop. There's a bulletproof vest under her shaking fingers, and a bullet splattered in the dead center of it – Jesus – and Sam stares at it dumbly, because it shouldn't be here, and Gracie must be dead and she must be mad. Gracie, eyes tightly squeezed in pain, wheezes, \"Promised... to show... to Priscilla's class after,\" and Sam stares , until the words sink in and she folds forward and leans her forehead to Gracie's, shaking in helpless silent laughter and not – definitely not, not under any circumstances – crying. There are finally sirens in the distance, and Gracie says, \"Fuck this hurts, fuck, fuck, ouch,\" and smiles at Sam, bright and unconcerned and high on adrenaline, and Sam looks at this smile and thinks to herself, I'm so screwed , and can't be bothered to care. Sam is limping, coughing and cursing all at once; she feels like she swallowed half of the Hudson and the other half is slowly congealing on her clothes. She remembers with some nostalgia the good old days when her casework did not include entertaining chases and falling into the rivers, but what can you do? At least she got the guy, and got him with extreme prejudice. The medic fusses over her for a while, crinkly foil blanket and oxygen mask and all, and Gracie hovers over both of them looking like she'd rather shove him away and do it herself. Sam floats on the feeling of not splashing in the goddamn cold river anymore a bit, but perks up sharply when they start making noises about \"overnight for observance\". She pulls the mask off and says \"No hospital\" with as much authority as she can muster; not much of it, she looks and feels like a drowned rat. The medic says \"Ma'am\" in such long-suffering way Sam considers smashing his teeth in just on principle, but Gracie looks at her over his head with something like understanding. She says, in her best perky Miss FBI voice that Sam hates , \"She's not dying or anything, right? She just needs to be warm and for somebody to look over her and check if she has any problems with her breathing?\" Sam knows how it will go, so she checks out for a while, focuses on the flow of warm oxygen. True to form, Gracie extricates her from the ambulance not ten minutes later, blanket and all, and then it's Gracie's piece of shit car with the heating cranked up, and then the stairs up to her piece of shit apartment. Sam thinks she should maybe be worried about kind of losing the track of events here and there, but Gracie's here, so she doesn't give a fuck. She comes to herself, a bit, when dumped unceremoniously on Gracie's bed, and tries to protest: she's caked with mud and dirt, and should probably be decontaminated before she's allowed to interact with anything clean (or at least as clean as anything in Gracie's apartment can be). She has to – she will – shower – her boots are squelching – she will – Gracie kneels before her, a single graceless movement, and starts undoing her laces, calmly as you please, and Sam stares at her in disbelief. She makes some kind of noise, and Gracie looks up at her, bright eyes and flushed cheeks, and says: \"Hey, partner, relax. I've got you.\" Sam is cold and exhausted and halfway to being not all here, and if something went differently tonight she could have been cold and all the way to not here instead, her body dragged down by the river, and Sam thinks fuck this , and Sam leans forwards and kisses Gracie's worried mouth. There's not a second of hesitation, oh thank God , not a moment, because Gracie matches her stride for stride, always. When they pull apart, Gracie says again, firmly, \"I've got you, okay,\" and Sam says, \"Yes,\" and closes her eyes. ","Summary":" Written for somebraveapollo in Yuletide 2014.

She planted her hands on her hips. \"That was only the one time.\" \"And it worked a charm,\" snorted her partner. \"Feranda still can't get the image out of his head.\" She grinned, and then was back on track, looking down her top. \"I swear, they're getting bigger.\" She looked up. \"Feel them.\" Matthews eyed her then. \"I'm never one to object to fondling my woman's breasts.

Grinning, he reached up to palm one of his favourite parts of her body. He'd had a wisecrack remark ready, before he realised that she was serious. \"They are bigger,\" he agreed. \"Thank you,\" she said exasperatedly. \"Now would you care to explain the two pounds that has taken up residence on my ass?\" She emphasised her point by reaching for his hands and planting them on said body part.

DISCLAIMER: DON'T OWN. NEVER WILL. \"Our Miss United States is… Rhode Island! Cheryl!\" At those words, I felt myself float out of my body. The entire stadium erupted into cheers and claps. I covered my mouth in shock. I turned to Gracie; she immediately wrapped me up into a tight hug. I could see her mouth moving quickly. \"I can't hear you!\" I called out through my smiles. I felt the banner slide over my head. My smile grew. Gracie looked panicked. I could tell she was calling louder now, but one of the guards pulled away. I stared out into the crowd, grinning with pride. Over the cheers and claps, I could hear the Miss United States song playing loudly. When I felt the crown being placed on top of my head, I could feel the tears slowly rising. I ignored Gracie's waving gestures as I turned and beamed at the cameras. I did it! I walked slowly up the stage and blew kisses. I was deliriously happy… but before I could even take another step, I could feel someone crash behind me and pull at my hair. I screamed and grabbed onto my crown protectively. When I turned to see who had attacked me, to my shock I saw the one girl I trusted most at the pageant. Gracie? I swatted at her with the bouquet that someone had placed in my arms. I could see the petals soaring off the stems with each hit. Gracie didn't falter. She was determined to ruin my night. \"GET AWAY!\" I screeched, hitting her some more. I could feel the tears slipping down my face. I didn't know if they were because I was angry, or if they were because I felt betrayed. Nevertheless, I kept hitting her. Some of the other contestants pulled her away, much to my relief. I tried to fix my crown and smile reassuringly, but I think it came out as a painful smirk. I continued to walk up the stage, with as much poise as I could possibly manage at this moment, but once again, Gracie's hands found her way to my head. Gracie ripped the crown off my head, and I couldn't hold it in anymore. I immediately wailed big baby sobs. My night was ruined. I could see out of the corners of my eyes that Gracie and Mary Jo were fighting over my crown. I could hear Mary Jo screaming, and she was desperately trying to pull the crown out of Gracie's hands. Miss Texas didn't have a chance compared to Gracie. With one swift punch to the face, Mary Jo was down. Through my cries, I stared at Gracie. Why? I trusted her. She was my friend . She was the one who drank my hot chocolate, she was the one who gave me pizza, she was the one who I confessed my secrets to, she was the one who gave me the flaming batons. It turns out; she was just like the others. She hadn't wanted a friend… she had wanted the crown. That hurt me more than losing my crown ever could. I could see her run her hands all over my prized item. I turned away, not wanting to watch anymore. Almost as soon as I turned around, I could hear the screams around me grow louder. Then, before I knew it, a loud explosion boomed. I turned on my heels, and behind me, Lady Liberty had exploded. I became instantly dizzy, and then everything went black. When I woke up, I could feel someone frantically slapping at my cheeks. \"Cheryl?\" I blinked, and everything soon came into focus. Staring down at me was Leslie, Miss California. \"What happened?\" I managed to sputter out. \"Your crown was a bomb.\" Leslie explained slowly, as if she didn't quite understand it herself. \"Gracie saved you. She threw it onto the statue, and it exploded within seconds.\" I slowly sat up and stared around. The entire audience was being evacuated and everywhere I looked, security guards were running around, gathering up all the pageant contestants. \"…Gracie?\" I asked out, still dazed. \"How long was I…\" \"Just a couple minutes.\" Miss California explained. I stood up fully and saw Gracie screaming. \"Eric? ERIC? ARE YOU OKAY?\" She looked panicked and was looking around desperately. I stared upwards to see who she was screaming at, when I saw as face, covered with soot, pop out. \"Oh thank God!\" Gracie cried out, placing a hand on her heart. \"You okay, Hart?\" The man called out. Hart? \"I'm fine. Throw down my stuff, will you?\" I watched as the man threw down a black gun, a pair of handcuffs and a black badge. \"Gracie!\" I called out, still as confused as ever. She turned around and saw me. \"What's happening?\" I asked. \"Hold on one sec!\" Gracie leaped towards Miss Morningside and pinned her down on the ground. \"GRACIE! What are you doing ?\" I could hear Miss Hawaii screech. \"Kathy Morningside, you're under arrest.\" Gracie barked, grabbing her handcuffs and swiftly attaching them to her wrists. I could hear her start to protest and try to struggle away from Gracie's grip, but with no luck. Suddenly, I felt someone grab my arms, and I tried to fight them off. \"It's okay, Miss Frasier…\" the man explained, \"I'm from the FBI. I'm taking you and the rest of the ladies into a safe room.\" I nodded, still dazed. The man took pulled me lightly backstage, but I kept trying to steal glances at Gracie. The man from the statue had somehow managed to come down, and he had Miss Morningside's assistant, Frank, in handcuffs. Gracie stood up, roughly picking up a cuffed Miss Morningside beside her, and the pair was dragged outside. When I was placed in the safe room, I could hear a billion voices shout out at the same time. I started screaming too… we were all so confused. \"QUIET!\" A loud booming voice yelled. The entire room shut up. \"Good. Now, first come first… I'm Agent Johnson, from the Texan FBI agency. I want ya'll to know that you're all safe now.\" I interrupted him, \"Why did my crown explode!\" My comment automatically started another round of hysterical screaming from the rest of the ladies. \"GIRLS!\" Agent Johnson yelled, \"LISTEN TO ME.\" We quieted down again. \"I would try explaining this all now, but I think you all would be much more comfortable having everything told by someone you recognize. So I'm gonna need you to sit still for a bit, Agent Hart and Agent Matthews also know more about this than I do. I sent out another agent to go grab them, and it shouldn't be long.\" I grumbled and slumped down in my chair, fingering the material of my sash. It was oddly comforting. We sat there, talking between ourselves when a voice suddenly buzzed in through Agent Carter's walkie-talkie. \"Agent Hart and Matthews are outside, sir.\" \"Send them in.\" At those words, the thick door to the safe room swung open to reveal... \"GRACIE!\" I shrieked as I leapt out of my chair. \"Cheryl!\" Gracie smiled and ran over and hugged me, \"Are you okay? Are you hurt?\" \"No… I'm fine!\" I managed to smile, \"Just shook up, is all.\" \"I'm sorry for taking out your crown. If it wasn't a bomb...\" I nodded, wincing slightly at the word. The man beside her must have noticed this, because he took Gracie by the hand and pulled her to the front of the room. \"Hello ladies. I'm agent Eric Matthews, from the New York FBI department.\" He introduced himself. \"Gracie, you know an FBI agent?\" Miss Ohio grinned suggestively. Gracie bit her lip. \"Yes…\" \"That's the guy who came into our room that night!\" Miss Texas cried out, placing her hand gently on her newly bandaged nose. A dozen voices broke out at once, but Agent Matthews interrupted them. \"Girls, I think you should let her explain.\" I couldn't tear my eyes away. I had never seen Gracie Lou look nervous before. She was oddly calm all throughout the pageant. As I was waiting for her response, I noted that the pair in front of us hadn't let go of each other's hands. Cute . \"Girls, don't talk until I'm finished, okay?\" Gracie sighed before continuing. \"My name is Grace Hart. I'm an FBI field agent in New York.\" I could hear myself, along with the other ladies in the room gasp out. She continued on before anyone could speak. \"The New York department has been working on solving a case, and we had gotten a clue that the next target was going to be here, at the Miss United States pageant. I had to enter to get full access to all areas at all times.\" Gracie explained, \"The short story is, Kathy Morningside and her son, Frank imitated a letter of one of the most wanted people on the planet so that they could frame a bombing on him.\" \"That's why my crown exploded!\" I cried out. Eric nodded \"The bomb was placed in the crown. Luckily, we got it away it time. Hart and I just got back from sending Miss Morningside and Frank away.\" \"Jail?\" Miss Utah whispered. Gracie lifted up the skirt of her dress, which revealed a black strap wrapped around her leg. She pulled out her gun and her badge, which she promptly flashed towards us, resulting in another round of shocked gasps. She spun the gun around on her finger before swiftly sliding it back onto the holder. She looked up again and stared at us with sincerity in her eyes \"Listen, I'm sorry I lied to you. All I wanted was to protect all of you… and now, you're safe. So I'm good.\" I could feel my eyes fill up with tears again, but for a different reason.

Thème 1 : Cigarette. Fandom : Miss Congeniality. Titre : La clope, c'est fini ! - Monsieur ? Votre patient de 15h est arrivé. L'hypnotiseur leva les yeux vers sa secrétaire à la voix fluette qui s'éloignait déjà de la salle café du cabinet. Son regard retomba immanquablement sur son gobelet encore fumant de la boisson riche en caféine qu'il avait à peine eut le temps de préparer et de boire. Il secoua la tête, soupira un grand coup, et d'une démarche ralenti, se dirigea jusqu'à son bureau. Il s'installa confortablement dans son fauteuil ultra ergonomique et se saisit du dossier de son prochain « patient ». Un certain John Doe. Encore un fumeur qui voulait arrêter d'être dépendant au goudron fumable. L'homme ignorait pourquoi depuis hier son agenda se remplissait à vitesse grand V de personnes extrêmement désireuses d'arrêter de fumer. En effet, il aurait allumé sa télé à n'importe quelle heure du jour qu'il aurait vu ces flashs info montrant une dénommée Gracie Lou Fribush, Miss New Jersey, bondir de la scène de l'Alamodome en déguisement peu flatteur pour son intelligence. La poignée de la porte s'abaissa soudain, avant que le panneau de bois ne tourne sur ses gonds bien huilés. Sa secrétaire, accompagné d'un homme avec stetson blanc vissé sur le crâne, apparurent. L'hypnotiseur se mit debout et alla à leur rencontre. - Merci Ketty. Bonjour monsieur Doe. D'un geste de la main, il invita l'homme au stetson à entrer et à s'asseoir. La porte se referma derrière eux dans un léger cliquetis. - Bien, nous allons commencer, vous voulez bien ? proposa-t-il avec calme. Son interlocuteur acquiesça. - Parlez moi d'abord de votre dépendance tabagique. J'aimerais savoir ce qui vous a poussé à vouloir me consulter. - Un signe ! C'est un signe qui m'a fait comprendre que je devais arrêter immédiatement. Ma femme parle tout le temps de ces conneries de signes, et c'est vraiment pas mon truc. J'crois pas en ces choses-là, mais là… C'est différent. Voyez-vous, jusque là je répétais tout le temps que j'arrêterai de fumer lorsqu'il y aurait l'un de ces signes dont elle parle tout le temps. Et puis comme ça elle me foutait la paix… Mais là… Là je ne peux pas nier, si ce qui m'est arrivé n'est pas un signe, c'est que je deviens fou ! Le docteur fronça imperceptiblement les sourcils. Il formula alors la question qui lui brûlait les lèvres et qui lui permettrait de comprendre la raison de son désir d'arrêter de fumer. - Parlez moi de ce signe. Quel est-il ? - Quel est-il ? répéta monsieur Doe, abasourdi. Mais c'est cette folle furieuse de Miss qui m'a sauté dessus pour que je n'allume pas ma clope ! Et elle m'a plaqué au sol, une vraie dingue ! Et à la télé, elle a dit avoir fait ça parce que toutes les Miss du concours de beauté sont toutes, je cite : « très actives dans la lutte contre la dépendance tabagique » ! Et après, cette Gracie Lou Fribush a dit que j'y réfléchirais à deux fois la prochaine fois que j'allumerai une cigarette. Et vous savez quoi ? La première fois que j'ai entendu ses mots, j'avais une Marlboro entre les doigts. Et bah là, j'peux vous dire que finalement je l'ai pas allumé cette tueuse… Bon, j'admets que si sa remarque avait eut un réel impact sur moi, à l'heure actuelle je ne fumerai plus, mais finalement, 2h après son passage à la télé, j'ai craqué, j'ai allumé une cigarette… L'hypnotiseur hocha la tête. Convaincu du réel désir de son patient à arrêter la cigarette. - Voilà, ce que nous allons faire : une première séance d'hypnose s'impose. Ensuite nous pourrons nous revoir pour voir où vous en êtes. Monsieur Doe sorti du cabinet une demi-heure plus tard, des images de fumées s'enroulant au-dessus d'une cigarette, ancrées dans son esprit… Contre toute attente, aucune envie d'allumer la traitresse habillée de blanc avec son briquet rouge ne lui vint… C'est ainsi que Monsieur Doe se mit à remercier une certaine Gracie Lou Fribush, Miss New Jersey… Voilà, un premier OS pour la soirée.

I would have done the pizza andnbeer thing in my own time, but I must admit, getting somennonexsistant scoop on Miss Rhode Island was a good way for me to donit as a way to repay her for her gestures towards me, even thatngodawful fat free hot chocolate. I knew I would like her for somenreason. I couldn't help it. She was younger than me by a good four ornfive years, but much younger than that in world experience, and thatnwas refreshing to me. I hadn't ever met anyone who was determined tonbe my friend before. She insisted on talking to me on the bus evennthough my 'butch dyke' demeaner that everyone was usually warnednabout or just SAW a mile away was evident in the way I carriednmyself.

Hell, with the way my thoughts were when I walked alonenlooking for the perfect... something for Cheryl, something to saynthat I believed in her, I might as well have been. I got hernflaming batons in -believe it or not- a sex shop. It was late, and Inwas curious, so I wandered in.

But if I ever do, I'll be sure to give you a call. A/N: Please excuse any mistakes. I'm not really sure who got third and fourth runner up. I think it was NY and CA, but I wasn't sure which order. I got the idea last night when MC was on TVand just HAD to write it down. Might be a bit fluffy at the end.Anyway, I hope you enjoy! I was nearly weak in the knees I was so nervous. I wouldn't have admitted it then, but now I'm not afraid to say it. I tried to tell Victor, but he just didn't understand. \"Yes, be the crown! You are the crown!\" I didn't care about the damn crown. I just cared about the bomb that Frank had attached to the crown. The bomb that would blow up the future Miss United States if I didn't stop him. I signaled furiously to Victor who was standing just offstage. He still didn't understand. God, he could be so stupid and thick sometimes! I didn't think he would ever understand, but at least I was trying. \"Welcome, ladies and gentlemen, to this year's Miss United States pageant!\" Stan's voice erupted over the loudspeakers. \"Tonight we will announce the winner…\" Yeah, yeah, no one cares, Stan! Get on with it! I thought. Looking backstage frantically, I only saw Victor standing there, beaming like a little kid at Christmas. \"…And now for the results. The fourth runner up is…Miss California!\" The said Miss California looked shocked and disappointed to say the very least, but she accepted her position with grace and poise, as was expected. \"The third runner up is…Miss New York!\" The same could be said about little miss NY. She obviously thought she would win. \"The second runner up is…Miss Texas!\" Out of the three, Texas looked the most revolted. Her mouth hung open slightly and she had a sour look on her face, looking about ready to kill the first person who said a word to her. I had to keep myself in check and make sure I didn't start laughing at her expression. \"Now, there are only two left. Miss New Jersey and Miss Rhode Island.\" Oh, God no. This was it. \"The first runner up is…New Jersey, meaning Miss Rhode Island has just won the Miss United States pageant!\" \"Oh!\" Cheryl squealed in delight and surprise. \"Cheryl!\" I yelled \"Don't take the crown! It's a bomb!\" \"What? I can't hear you!\" she yelled back, pure joy written across her face. Not for long, I thought to myself. A guard started to lead me away as a sash was draped over Cheryl. Someone handed her a bouquet of roses and Gloria glided across the stage, the crown on an embroidered pillow in her hands. Cheryl's eyes shone brightly as the glimmering crown was laid on top of her head. I looked up and there was Frank Tobin, crouched in the shadow of Lady Liberty's bust. At some point, Eric had appeared backstage and out of the corner of my eye, I saw him follow my gaze upwards. Understanding filled his face and he dashed off immediately. And that's when I started to fight. I kicked in the guard's grasp, flailing madly. I was not going to see my best friend blown up by Frank Tobin and his conspirator mother, Kathy Morningside. They would not win this battle, and I was going to make sure of that. The guard fought with me as I struggled to get away from him. I finally just punched him and he reeled back but I didn't pause to make sure he was okay. I ran across the stage, pushing past people and not caring if they fell or lost their balance. I found myself in front of Cheryl and I tried to pry the crown from her head. She immediately started whacking me with her roses, which lost all their petals instantaneously. Mary Jo grabbed me from behind and started fighting with me, trying to keep me away from Cheryl. God, I wish she had just understood! Then I wouldn't have had to break her nose to get her away from me. But I did. I didn't have a choice. Then I turned on Cheryl once again. This time I was able to snatch the crown from her head. She had a mixture of hurt and disbelief on her face, and I was sorry for what I was doing. God, I was so sorry, but I couldn't let her blow up. Up above us, I saw Eric appear behind Frank. They immediately engaged in a brawl so I figured I had a little time. \"Cheryl, it's a bomb,\" I yelled to her again. \"The crown is a bomb!\" I saw a flicker of comprehension on her face before I pushed her down and got ready to throw the crown. Then I threw it. Suddenly everything turned to slow-mo. Tobin stood up and aimed the control to detonate the bomb just as I released it. Eric lunged himself at Tobin, looking absolutely furious. Kathy looked shocked and Stan looked dumbfounded. Everyone else was screaming, but I didn't hear any of it when the bomb went off. Suddenly everything went to its normal speed. Eric tackled Tobin to the ground and the control flew out onto the stage. I felt a huge blast of air as the bomb discharged. Crown fragments felt like glass as they flew towards me. I was knocked backwards with the force of the explosion. I landed hard on the ground. Cheryl was screaming. My head hurt. My legs hurt. My chest hurt. Everything hurt. Where was I? Oh God, Cheryl's crying. Why is she crying? I felt myself flitting in and out of consciousness. I didn't know what was real and what wasn't. Suddenly Eric was beside me. And there was Victor, standing next to Cheryl. Eric's mouth was moving. What was he saying? Oh…Gracie? That was my name, wasn't it? Suddenly I got my senses back. I could hear everything. It was all so loud. Eric was screaming at me. \"Gracie! Gracie, what hurts?\" What hurts? I don't know…I was starting to feel numb. I opened my mouth and a croak came out. Eric picked up my upper body and supported me. I tried to speak again. I gasped a little from the pain, but finally managed to say something in a tiny voice. \"I…I did—did good…didn't I, Eric?\" It was more of a question than a statement. I really wanted to know if I had done well. \"Yeah,\" Eric said quietly, his eyes shining strangely. Was he…was he crying ? Eric Matthews was crying over me ? Impossible! \"Yeah,\" he repeated, cradling me gently. \"You did real good, Gracie Lou.\" And then everything went black. Like it? Yes? No? Just review! I may do a chapter from Eric's POV (this was in Gracie's POV, in case you didn't notice ;) ) and then do what happens afterwards. Anyway, hope you liked it!

The truth was, it was never that I didn't like people. Inloved being with people, I just never had the chance to really bennear many. I would go into the whole sob story about being from ansmall town and not knowing much about the world until I went off toncollege, but that is not what this is about. This is aboutnher, Gracy Lou Freebush. There wasnsomething about her that I knew right off when she got on the busnnext to me that she was unique. She seemed to not care about hernlooks, yet there she was, in a pageant like me and all the other selfnabsorbed women. Everyone elsencast me aside and didn't seem to care about my attempts to makenfriends with them. They literally slammed the door in my face beforenI could say 'fat free cocoa'. She took the time to talk to me andnassured me that I, too, had a good chance at winning, and I actuallynbelieved her even though I know she was being kind. I knew she wasn'tnlying either. When I watched her at that first rehearsal, I knew thatnshe wasn't graceful despite her name, but she tried, and she had angood heart, and I would have given her the crown just for that if Inwas a judge in this pageant. Now she wasnthere, hardly knowing me, and yet she had bridged the gulf between menand the other contestants long enough to take us all out for a girls'nnight. So, looking at her at that moment, we're somewhat alone, awaynfrom the other contestants and I was sitting there, possibly drunk,nbut it isn't the alcohol I felt. No no, it was much more complicatednthan that. I felt my heart pounding and my tongue loosening. I couldntell her anything. And I did,nexcept for the one thing I wanted to tell her, but of course Indidn't. I think she asked me about committing a crime. I told hernabout the underwear I stole, the 'devil's panties' that I took. Inwanted to kiss her lips as they smirked at me when she asked me ifnthat was all. It was as if she'd been around a lot of crime andnsomething like that wouldn't in any lifetime phase her, but I, on thenother hand, thought it was one step below murder. Small town thing,nyou know? But then, Incouldn't stop talking. I told her about the one time in college,nand... well, the lit professor, as if she'd asked me if I have everncommitted a mortal sin. Truth be told, I was committing one then,ntalking to her and wanting her, but I went on to tell her about it,nand how he had tricked me into being alone with him as he... well, Indon't want to think about it now. All I wanted to think about was thenlook on her face, the concern she seemed to have for me. All I wantednto think about was her hands on me as she showed me manoeuvres tonprotect me. All I wanted to think about was her protecting me fromnpeople like that, people who wanted to take advantage of me because Inam so naive. I wanted to think about that 'man' on the beachndiscussing books, music and movies with me being her, Gracie LounFreebush, holding my hand and showing me the world. We all might wantnworld peace, but in my mind, I wanted to think of her bringing peaceninto my life, into my world. She was talking to me, telling me tonstand, and she was actually going to show me said manoeuvres rightnthen, and as I stood, feeling her warm hands on my shoulders, I wasnhit by the tubie things, and I saw her in my dreams.

ENJOY. Sorry only one chapter for thisnone. GracienLou Freebush (secretly known as Agent Gracie Hart of the FBI) pacednthe length of the gigantic swimming pool outside her hotel room innSan Antonio, Texas. She was desperately seeking some form of reliefnfrom the daily torture of playing the part of a want-to-be beautynqueen and the stress of trying to keep her job intact with the FBI.nOn top of it all, her forever nagging trainer, Vic, was practicallynshoving her off the edge of sanity itself. \"It is always 'yes'nnever 'yeah'.\" This constant reminder that she was not allowednto show her true self in the eyes of the other girls, who she wasnsteadily becoming friends with, vexed her. She slumped down onto anpool side lounging chair. It was all so overwhelming she felt likenpulling out her automatic hand gun and shooting something until allnthe anger and frustration was gone or…. \"Err, Infeel like I want to kill some thing!\" She wailed and cradled hernhead in her hands. \"I wish that I could just rid myself of thisnretrograde operation. I mean, I'm not one to just avert from andnoperation like this but I just can't handle it any more.\" \"Thinkingnout loud Gracie?\" A deep, amused voice, remarked. She lifted hernhead out of her hands and looked up into the handsome face of a man.nHe had a shock of jet black, spiked hair, bright green eyes and anCaribbean tan. His teeth were so white she could see them in the darknof the night. The man was clad in white shorts and a red hibiscusnprint button up T-shirt. He was so cute. She stared open mouthed atnthe man in front of her. He chuckled. He knew his disguise wouldnentrance her, now was his time to act. \"Whonare you, and how do you know my name?\" Gracie stuttered. \"Whenndid you get here? I thought I was alone.\" The man chose this timento speak up and put his plan into action. \"Well, to answer yournquestion, it is my job to know everyone. I take names and makendeals.\" He said, cunningly working his way through thenconversation. \"I guess you could say I am some thing of antherapist. I help people who have trouble deciding what to do withntheir lives, I even help students choose which College and itsncurriculum would best suit them after they leave high school.\" \"Younlook somewhat young to be a guidance counselor. That's what you arenright?\" Gracie said incredibly. The man nodded his head, \"I am anlittle older than you though.\" Gracie began to speak but he cut hernoff, \"Never mind that now, my name is Juan Diablo and like I saidnbefore I am a therapist. Your pageant director, Mrs. Morningside,nhired me to help relieve the girls of their before-pageant-jitters. Incould not help overhearing your ah 'little' problem. Sounds likenyou need a little help. Tell me what is going on.\" Gracientold Juan everything. Everything from what happened the night Grantnwas shot to why she was sitting down by the pool brooding. \"Well itnseems to me that you are in a little bit of a pickle.\" Juan saidnwith a chuckle. \"It seems the only way out of it is to disappear.nThe only problem with that is the fact that you are an FBI agent. Younare tracked every time you walk out of FBI headquarters.\" He saidnas he lifted his hand to cup his chin in thought. He glanced over atnGracie. She was definitely listening. She seemed to be hanging uponnhis words as he spoke. This was good all the more easier for him,nsome of the people he spoke to seemed to see directly through him,nothers like young Gracie, did not seem to see him for who he reallynwas. \"I'llntell you what I will do for you.\" Juan said, dropping his hand andnsitting down on a lounge chair. \"If you will give me your word thatnwhen I need a favor, you and only you will perform it, I will whisknyou away from this babe fest and send you to a place where no onenwill ever see, or hear from you again.\" He looked at her andnsmiled. He wondered what her decision would be. Graciensat on the lounge chair opposite Juan. His proposition was temptingnbut she was again struck with her colliding feelings both for her jobnand herself. Eric, what was she thinking! She looked up at Juan.n\"What kind of 'favors are you talking about? The usual go to thengrocery store and pick up ingredients to make chocolate chip cookiesnright?\" She said with a laugh. What could she possibly do thatnwould benefit him and erase her dept. \"Whatnever I ask of you, at any given time or place. No exceptions.\" Juannlooked serious now and he pulled out an old leather bound notebooknand a red pen. \"All you have to do now is sign.\" He held the pennout to her and gave her the book. She began to flip through it tonfind a page with some space to spare. Every single line in the booknhad a single name on it. She saw names like Ben Franklin, NapoleonnBonaparte, and Genghis Khan. Was this some hobby of his or somenthing? \"George W. Bush Jr.? I don't want to know.\" Shenfound space under the name Brittany Spears and held the pen, ready tonright her name. Shenlooked up at Juan. He was still sitting down on the lounge chair,nstill in his serious mood. She began to sign. She only got to thenmiddle of her last name when suddenly she was whisked off tonsomewhere in the Caribbean Sea. Juan was standing beside her on thensand. She looked over at him startled. \"I wasnnot finished signing my name.\" She yelled at him. How in God'snname did she get on this little island in the Caribbean so quickly?nGracie had a short temper and her gun was in a holster strappednaround her left leg. She bent over and took it out of its holder. Shenpointed the gun at Juan Diablo. \"Arenyou going to shoot me Gracie Lou?\" He said. \"Whatnexactly is that book for?\" Gracie said. \"It isna book of dealings that I have made over the years with variousnindividuals such as your self who wished to leave the pathetic littlenlives they led for something bigger and better.\" He said, a grinnbeginning at the corners of his mouth. Howncould she have been so blind? \"Diablo. Is that the name for thenDevil in Spanish?\" She said. \"Yes,nvery good Gracie Lou. You have signed my black Book of the Dead. Inhave your soul now in my service for all eternity.\" Diablo saidnwith a grin. He crossed his arms like a conqueror watching hisnadversary crumble. She picked up the book off of the ground andnopened it to the page where she signed it. She grinned. \"Diablonthere may be a little problem here.\" She showed him the page wherenshe signed her name. His face was red with anger. She had written thenwrong name down 'Gracie Lou Freebush.' not Gracie Hart wasnwritten on the page. The contract was void. He looked up at the skynand shook his fist in rage. He crossed his arms and looked at her.

Not me…I'mnstuck as a tomboy police officer here in New Jersey. It's okay…atnleast I have him . He is my hero, my reason of living…myneverything. Well…almost my everything. He can play the role ofnanybody. He can be your fantasy super hero with the ultimate supernpowers. He can play the role of a teenager crackpot. The mostnimportant role he plays for me…is my boyfriend .I'venbeen pretty content my whole life but ever since I took the job as anpolicewoman, I never noticed I was so lonely; until I took a job fornthe FBI as a contestant in the Miss Teen USA pageant. Well,nlater on I went out on an adventure to find out who the bad guy wasnfor this stupid pageant. It turns out that the culprit behindneverything was this old hag who just so happens to be the hostess fornthe pageant. Before I found out, I was a clueless 19 year oldnAmerican girl walking around with what seemed like a gazillion inchnhigh heels and a map of goodness knows where that was supposed to take me to the pageant until I suddenly I bumped into this greatnguy (I didn't think he was so great the first time I met him). Inthink he was a little more than five feet tall at the time. He hadngreat tan skin and did something with his hair occasionally. I don'tnusually go for guys so fast and guys who can't seem to leave theirnhair alone, but with this guy was a special case. At first, I thoughtnhe was a special mental case but I guess all that changed… \"Hey!nWatch where you're going, you twig!\" a man from behind said. \"Uh…I-I'mnsorry, I was just looking for—\"I stuttered. He was so gorgeous, Inalmost tripped over my heels. \"Yeah,nyeah, whatever. That's what they all say,\" he turned around withna guitar strapped around his back. Inwas flabbergasted. He was gorgeous but rude! \"Excuse me? I was justntrying to apologize. Oh, and thanks for calling me twig,\" I said. Indidn't think I passed for even a broomstick. Henjust kept walking. \"Hey!nDon't ignore me!\" I ran after him. \"Look,nyou almost broke my guitar and I got a cut from my pick,\" he turnednand shuffled off again. Incontinued to follow him, \"Your guitar is in a case and younshouldn't have been holding a pick in your hand if you'rennot playing your guitar, buster.\" \"Don'tnlecture me, bimbo,\" he said without looking at me. \"Whatndid you call me?\" I said. \"Younheard me,\" he turned to a corner and went through a door. As soonnas I got to the door, he shut it. Inkept staring at the door then I yelled, \"Look! I was just trying to get directions to this stupid place, okay? Do you think youncan help me out a little?\" Nonresponse. \"Insaid I was sorry!\" Stillnno answer. \"Guysnare so freaking stubborn!\" I hit the door and stalked off. I shooknmy hand violently because the door hurt! Inwalked a few feet before he opened the door and yelled, \"Hey!\" Inturned and did the kind of pose that said what do you want ? \"Incan help you. I know New York like the back of my hand,\" he saidnwith a smile. \"Really?\"nI smiled back. \"Really,\"nhe gestured for me to walk toward him, \"C'mere. Let me take anlook at that map and write directions on where to go.\" Ingave him the map. He scribbled a bunch of lines on the streets untilnfinally he circled a place and handed the map back to me, \"Goodnluck.\" \"Thanks,\"nI smiled at him even more. I felt like a fool but I just couldn'tnhelp it. \"You'renwelcome,\" he said. He also smiled. I was entranced in his smile. \"I'mnGracie,\" I handed out my hand for him to shake. \"Eric,\"nhe didn't shake it. He just clapped it. Insmiled at the fact that he told me his name which is really weirdnbecause I don't usually do anything so stupid like that, \"Well,nI'll be going now.\" I began to walk off a few feet, \"Oh, andnthanks again.\" Henchuckled and said, \"Bye.\" \"Bye!\"nI walked off. Inhappily walked off into the city metropolis. I followed the map. Itnwas really easy to follow. That was the thing. It was too easy. I was in front of a flashy looking building. I read the top ofnthe building. It had an electric light that flashed, \"Pussy Kitten\"nwith a provocative looking image of a woman under the word. \"Ohnmy gosh. That perverted little freak!\" I mumbled angrily. I walkednback to what I assumed is his house. Asnsoon as I got there, I knocked on the door as hard as I could and Inyelled as loud as I could. \"You!nYou perverted freakazoid! Come out here you coward! How dare younhumiliate me like that?\" Itnstarted to rain, \"Let me in! It's raining!\" Itnrained even harder until it got to the point where it startednhailing. \"Hey!\"nI yelled as loud as I could, \"Please, let me in! It's hailing!\" Inwaited ten minutes sitting down under his little staircase. I got upnand yelled over the clinking of the hail, \"Umm…whatever your namenis…I'll just leave you alone now since you're being such anfreaking idiot,\" I turned to go sulk in the rain and hail but as Inturned to go, I saw him standing there smiling as though he'd wonnthe lottery. Instared at him spitefully but at the same time tearfully happy. \"That idiot 's name is Eric and…uh…sorry about you being stoodnup by me,\" he smiled his hypnotizing smile again, \"You enjoy mynlittle trick? It was one that I made up to get rid of annoying littlengirls.\" Injust continued to stare at him then I cried and ran into his chest.nIt felt a lot safer and warmer than standing the rain. Except for thenhail hitting my head, I felt no pain but what he did to me. I don'tnknow why, I just kept crying in his chest. He gently shook me off. \"Calmndown, it wasn't that harsh,\" he said. Injust kept sniffling. \"Allnright,\" he started fiddling with his keys and unlocked the door tonhis house, \"C'mon in.\" Inwalked in. On the outside it looked like every other normal apartmentnout on the streets but it looked like a dream house on the inside.nEverything was furnished and celebrity-like. \"Whatnare you, the president or something?\" I awed at his many antiques.nThere were katanas, paintings, sculptures, and stuff I didn't evennthink existed. \"No,\"nhe said with his back turned, \"I'm a musician.\" What?nHim? A musician. No way. That was what I thought. No offense, hendoesn't seem the type to write love songs and such, \"Really? Whatnkind of songs do you sing?\" \"Oh…younknow,\" Eric said. He had his back turned to me. He took off hisnshirt! I wanted to see if he had a six pack so I inched a little tonthe right as he put on a different shirt. Woo! That boy is hot ornwhat? Henturned around quickly while I was still staring at his gorgeous body,n\"You like my six pack?\" he asked jokingly as he pulled his shirtndown. \"What?nI wasn't looking there and you don't have one,\" I said. Henlifted up his shirt and I stared at it and then he put it down and Insaid, \"See?\" Henlaughed his sadistic laugh, \"Then where were you looking? Checkin'nfor a different pack, now are we?\" Indidn't know what he meant but I could tell he was taunting me, \" No .nYou stupid idiot. I was just looking at the thing behind you,\" Ohnmy gosh. I'm the stupid idiot. I didn't even know what was behindnhim. \"That?\"nhe pointed at a little framed picture, \"That's me and mynbrother.\" \"Really?\"nI walked over to where he was and looked at the picture. There werentwo young boys. One was on a swing and the other was pushing the boynon the swing. They were so cute. \"Readynto hear my sob story?\" he said smiling. \"Sobnstory? You have a sob story?\" I said. I blurt it out bynaccident. I really didn't mean to. \"Everybodynhas a sob story,\" he began, \"I was twelve and he was ten. We werenrunning down this large hill like we always do and I remember wenwould chase these girls in school all the time. We always caught upnto them but we never did anything. I was so mean to my brother backnthen and I would always threaten to never play with him again if hendidn't obey by my rules,\" he stopped and looked at me for anmoment. I was listening intently. \"Onenday…we rolled down that large hill like we always did. Ournneighbor, who was a really tall guy probably towering at six feet,nwalked over to us. You know the little Baudelaire story? About thosenlittle kids who were orphaned because their parents had died in annaccident. Well, the same ordeal happened to me and my little brother.nOnly it wasn't a fire accident,\" he stopped and looked down for ansecond, \"Umm…uh…\" \"What?nWhat happened?\" I asked him with sympathetic eyes, \"I mean, youndon't have to tell me if you don't want to but if you want to,nI'll listen.\" Henpaused for a while longer then ran his fingers through his hair andnstarted, \"Well, we were moved to the nearest orphanage and uh…\"nanother pause inflated the silence, \"I didn't want to benseparated from my little brother so anybody who came and wanted onlynone of us, I would reject completely. We would run away and they'dnfind us and tell us that the couple who wanted only one of us won'tnbe able to adopt us. That went on for more than a year until we werenadopted by a really nice woman. Her name was Jennifer Sachet.\" \"Shenwas really nice but my brother was still unhappy even with all thatnshe'd given us. He slowly started breaking down into tears morenoften at night. It wasn't like I could hear him though. They werenthe kind of tears that were silent and would burn through pillows.nLater, he got to the point where he couldn't even stand for morenthan five minutes. The doctors said he wasn't resting enough. Everyntime my brother got up at night, I would tell him to get back in bednand go to sleep. I would argue with him to get into bed. I was sonworried. One day, I woke up and I thought he was still asleep so Inwent downstairs and ate breakfast with Jennifer. I played video gamesnlike I always did for hours. I took a look at the clock and it wasn12:23 in the afternoon. I went upstairs and my brother was still innthe same position I last saw him in bed. I called out his namenseveral times. Then I started poking him and jabbing at his stomachnbut he wouldn't move,\" he stopped and I just stared because Inthought I knew what would happen. \"Henhad heart failures the night before passed away. He was only 12 and Inwas 13. I was all alone. I ran away from home several thousand timesnevery year. Jennifer couldn't handle me anymore because I would getninto gun fights and she was afraid I might hurt someone else so shensent me away. First it was boarding school. I always stole peoples'nvaluables and such. Second were those little boot camps. Sure, theynyelled in my face like there was no tomorrow but even they couldn't handle me. Third was juvi. That was the worst place I'dnever been to. I got into even worse fights. Jennifer rarely visitednme just to see if I was safe. How could I be safe if she'd been the one who sent me in that hell-hole?

He's Mojotheomegawolfs OC, so thank him as without Mojo I wouldn't have written this story. And there is real-life stuff in this fanfic, plus a significantly darker tone if you will. \"My name? Jason. Past? Even I don't know and CIS is none the wiser. Hobby? If blowing some guys head off with a fifty-cal sniper rifle counts, then yeah. Friends? Nope, I only get a partner whenever I'm put in for significant recon or assassination jobs, and even that thankfully hardly happens, so I'm mainly alone in the field. Profile amongst colleagues? I'm 'That Guy. The Directors Personal Killer. The One Who Carries TWO Sharp Knives.' And the truth is I AM that guy.\" Some called him \"X\" even though those who referred to Jason in that manner knew his real name. But he didn't care. Why? He was an agent of the Canine Intelligence Service. He was one of the top snipers in the world. He was a member of CISes PHYSINT Branch for a reason, and it wasn't to become a social animal. He was to shoot his targets in the head since no one could be hurt by a dead guy. As he remembered those facts he walked down to the Directors office. The few canines and a few cats that had to be either visitors or liaisons that noticed him tried to avoid his gaze. At least they had a silent understanding with him. A couple of the braver office workers looked him in the eye briefly before shuddering away. Was one brown eye on an otherwise all-black Anatolian Shepherd THAT repulsive? Finally he made his way to the overall Directors new office. Security had been tightened in light of traitors being revealed, so armed guards made for a secure perimeter as he approached. \"Where's your identification sir?\" a big-boned one inquired. Jason didn't answer and instead simply gave him his ID card. After both card and Jason being inspected thorougly the guard returned the card. \"Alright, you're clear. Just pass the checks at the door and you should be fine.\" Jason nodded and went to the door. It was a necessary pain but still very much annoying for anyone who had to meet the Director. \"Welcome!\" a female computer voice greeted him. \"Please comply with the following security measures in precise order; paw scan, retinal scan, voice verification and keyboard-inputed password!\" Great. But he merely silently complied. Ten seconds of his right paw being on the scanner resulting in a torturous beep, a pair of excessively bright lights took in his mismatched eyes, the two words he said into the microphone were, \"Agent Jason\", and the typing of the password: V-A-C-C-I-N-E. Fitting considering the means of the Directors legendary unintended recruitment. Finally the woman \"thanked\" him and Jason stepped inside past the now opening blast doors. \"Why hello Agent Jason!\" Director Lou said all-business. For someone teased about supposedly ugly sweaters he must've not gotten the point of the comments, for the Beagle wore a navy-blue blazer, an open white dress shirt and gray pants. Nerd of all nerds. \"Sir,\" he replied. \"Honor to be here Director.\" \"Honor's mine,\" replied the glasses wearing dog. \"I trust you have a good idea of why you're here, correct?\" \"I believe I've been selected for whatever Herculean task I'm needed for.\" The Director nodded. \"There have been leaks,\" he said as the Beagle tapped away at his laptop. He pointed behind Jason, who nodded and turned just in time to see a casualty list of both MEOWS and CIS operatives. \"I know sir. We lost a lot of good agents in LA, but I fail to see how this concerns me.\" \"Internal Affairs revealed Kitty and the Feline Liberation Front had moles on the inside for years. The highest one of which is a Pitbull by the name of Fang.\" Now a thuggish-looking Pitbull took up the screen. Jason growled. \"Sir, that guy was the dog in charge of all of our California operations. What kind of canine does that to his own?\" \"Fangs kind apparently. When he realized we were coming after him he and a lot of the traitors stole a plane and attempted to escape. Air Force scrambled a couple of fighters and intercepted him.\" \"Then how is he still alive?\" the Anatolian Shepherd asked. \"Missile that got fired off blew off one of their wings. Had it been fired a second earlier we wouldn't have had this discussion, but past is the past. Crashed into the Pacific. Recovery teams retrieved quite a few bodies but not Fangs.\" The Beagle then took a deep breath. \"SIGINT just got word of a deal he and a few other turncoats-some of whom are MEOWS operatives-made with a high-end FLF member that has ties to the Russian Mafia; in exchange for safety in Moscow, they're gonna provide codes for our spy satellites. I don't want the bad guys even having one space-based camera, so your primary objective is to destroy the data via any means necessary to prevent the FLF from gaining control over our assets. Peeks is working on a virus that'll delete everything including itself when all the other stuff on whatever system they're using is wiped clean. Secondary objective is to capture high-level participants of the deal for questioning.\" \"Sorry for interrupting,\" Jason began, \"but I've got questions Director. First off, where will I be going and when to stop this? Second, what if I can't capture that FLF boss or the rogue agents?\" \"You'll be flown to St. Lawrence Island in the Bering Sea. You've got two hours until we stick you on the plane. And if you cannot bring in any particular targets, do what you do best.\" \"Kill them. Roger that sir,\" the assassin nodded. \"Good. I've got paperwork and bureaucrauts waiting to see me, so dismissed. Just as a sidenote, you'll get additional information later.\" ME: Okay, looks like Jason just got the most important mission of his life. Stakes are pretty high ladies and gentlemen. Reviews and PMs to help make this story better will be appreciated by me.[Chapter 2] ME: I gave Jason a 2-hour window, so now he gets his equipment. \"Report to the Armory in PHYSINT Wing.\" That was what Jason got on his phone. After the security checks of course. Now he made his way to the Armory. The fact he had nearly two hours to kill was making him anxious. Hopefully his trusty M82 could reassure him. \"Agent Jason?\" a technician inquired. \"Yes?\" Being the Directors personal assassin didn't mean he regularly got attention up close. And when he did it was trouble nine times out of ten. \"I'd like to introduce you to the Barrett X-M-Five-Hundred. A new tool for your kit. Just rolled off the assembly line today!\" Jason nodded, keenly observing the prototype. It was a bullpup design with the magazine behind the trigger. Picking it up the Anatolian Shepherd found it was slightly lighter than his older rifle, as well as having a stationary barrel instead of a rotating one like the M82 did. Potentially more accuracy. And it had a built-in suppressor as well as a fancy-looking scope. \"I'm gonna set up a target down in the shooting range,\" the tech suddenly interrupted his observations. \"And the scope? It can switch between infrared and night-vision with literally the push of a button.\" \"Nice,\" Jason commented. \"Must cost a fortune.\" \"Thank you Captain Obvious. Try to avoid breaking anything or my boss'll make me the newest janitor around here.\" He nodded and walked down a short flight of stairs, cursing silently upon realizing he'd have to make his way back up them. Finding the cardboard cutout he settled in and readied himself to shoot. \"Alright,\" came the order. \"Do it.\" There was no verbal response as Jason had already finished making sure he had a round chambered. So he simply fired. BANG! There wasn't anything left of the \"bad guys\" head. \"Impressive. Looks like the computer guys gave us accurate simulations.\" \"Yep,\" the agent simply replied as he safed the XM500, ejected the magazine and the last bullet in the .50 cal sniper. Reinserting the lone round, he carried the rifle in his back and made his way back to the armory. \"Okay, I've got two Bowie-style knives and a modified Point-Forty-Five, but if your file's correct I don't need to go over them with you.\" \"Right. Anymore big surprises?\" \"In a fitting package.\" Suddenly the guy rolled in a mannequin with some futurstic clothes covering it. \"It's the Mark-One Black Ops Suit. Prototypes've been field-tested, so you're not the Guineau Pig of CIS. At least when it comes to the suit.\" \"Yeah,\" Jason muttered. \"Is it me or does the helmet have built-in binoculars?\" \"It does. As a result this particular Mark-One is the only known Sniper-class currently in existence, made for either solo long-distance assassins or guys in pairs. So okay, I guess I may've lied in that regard.\" \"Wont shoot you for that. Can you store all the ballistic protection somewhere else?\" \"What? Why?\" He sighed. \"I cannot get in a firefight. Do that and I'm dead.\" The tech nodded and took the vest and pads away himself. \"Don't know what you're missing...\" He tunread to find the Agent already fully dressed in white. \"Can't wait to get my ghillie suit.\" \"Wont that be nice.\" At this Jason found his helmet switched on. \"Whatever you do, do NOT lose this. Only reliable way of keeping in touch with HQ. Plus you'ver got GPS and all.\" \"Great kid, thanks. Now if you'll excuse me I've got to go be a living killing machine.\" ME: How was that for Chapter Two?[Chapter 3] ME: Update time! Being an agent in CIS meant seeing the world. The means of which in this case being a plane. But Agent Jason, trained assassin and sniper, didn't reflect on this as the loadmaster onboard checked his equipment. \"Alright!\" the other dog said. \"Looks like you're all good!\" The Anatolian Shepherd nodded in thanks just as a radio transmission got to him. \"Jason, it's the Director. Do you read me?\" The cool response was immediate. \"I read you sir. Ready for briefing, over.\" \"Copy. Fang and his crew are hiding out at Northeast Cape Air Force Station, a Cold War-listening post/surveillance and radar base. FLF sent in some hitmen to bolster security, so be alert. Avoid the local humans; this may be a remote island but I don't want word getting out about this. Over.\" \"Understood. Backup and extraction?\" \"This is a solo operation. MEOWS didn't have agents to spare and you're the only one I could send. Soon as you're done or have to bug out call us and we'll have you outta there ASAP. Over.\" \"Very well boss. I'll get back to you as soon as I'm on the ground, out.\" With that he cut the link. \"Two minutes!\" the pilot called. \"Got it,\" he replied as he adjusted an important piece of equipment. \"I can breathe.\" \"Roger, opening door.\" At this Jason readied himself. Screwups would result in death, and he'd go out another way. \"Thiety seconds and counting.\" Stay calm, stay calm... \"Now! Go, go, go!\" At this he jumped into the cold air. Just as the island came into view his parachute deployed and made him slow down. Unfortunatly he landed on a shrub. Great, a black mark on a otherwise perfect record for the jump. \"HQ, this is Jason. Insertion complete, over.\" \"Copy that. Move to a secure area and initiate radio check as soon as you're in position. Over.\" \"Wilco control. Jason out.\" With that he unslung his XM500 and moved out. ME: Suggestions are appreciated. How was this?[Chapter 4] ME: Alright, time for some more spywork. JASON: Staring me! ME: Are you OOC or a Gary-Sue now? Note there is descriptive violence. \"Jason to HQ, radio check. Over.\" Hopefully he would get a response. Weather wasn't being kind to him as usual durin assignments. \"Agent Jason, this is the Director. Somehow I read you. Provide sitrep, over.\" He drew a cold breath. \"I'm in position to infiltrate the hostile stronghold sir. Repeat, ready to commence with the infiltration. Over.\" \"Copy Jason, but hold your position!\" Something was up. \"We have new intelligence on the security of the hideout.\" Now they tell him this? \"Alright boss. Please send intel, over.\" \"The Russian middlecat sent a unknown number of armed goons to protect Fang and his fellow traitors. Avoid contact unless there is no alternative, over.\" He nodded to himself. \"I copy Director. Interrogative: When will the Russkie show his ugly face? Over.\" \"Tomorrow, I say again, tomorrow. Do what needs to be done Jason and he wont get those codes. Good luck, out.\" At this Jason shut down the link. Now he set off on his trek, rifle at the ready. There were a few guards manning posts or on patrol but he avoided them. Slipping into the main building of the abandoned base he dodged a few triggermen and found what he was looking for; a out-of-place desktop computer in a history museum exhibit. \"Jackpot,\" he whispered. Pulling out the flash drive he inserted it into a open USB port and got to work. \"Warning:,\" the virus program cautioned him as he moved it from the flash drive to the computer, \"upon activation of this virus, EVERY item of data on whatever computer system is being used will be destroyed, including this virus. Please confirm you wish to activate this virus.\" He affirmed. Making sure to remove the flash drive first. Suddenly Jason heard footsteps. Drawing his twin knives he turned around just as two cats with AK-47s walked in. He had no choice. Just as they noticed him the Grim Reaper threw his KA-BARs at the guards. The one to Jasons right was hit in the heart and went down without much of a mess. The one on the left however was subject to less precise aiming and took his knife to the neck. Jason sighed as he moved to finish off the less-fortunate target. The Russian pulled out the knife and screamed in pain. Grabbing his neck and twisting he put him out of his misery. Afterretrieving his knife he looked to find the other one having gone into shock. Or something else. He still did him a common courtesy and made sure he didn't have to suffer any longer than necessary. The true villain would pay the price. And it would not be an accident. Never looking back Jason left the base, reminding himself as his role as a sniper. The only targets that absolutely had to be eliminated were high-end guys, the head of the serpent. Decapitate it and the body went down quick and easy. Everyone else was a victim of circumstance. \"HQ,\" he reported, \"this is Agent Jason. I need to be connected to the Director ASAP, over.\" \"Copy sir,\" a young voice replied. \"Patching you through now, standby.\" After about a minute a certain Beagle began to speak to him. \"Jason, I'm here. What's your status?\" He cleared his throat. \"Sir, primary objective achieved. Repeat, enemy ability to access our orbital assets compromised. Over.\" \"Roger that-anything else?\" \"Sir, I had to take down two guards. Say again, I had hostile contact.\" \"You realize what this means right?\" \"It means my job just got a lot harder Director.\" ME: Looks like someone's in trouble.[Chapter 5] ME: Sorry I haven't updated in awhile guys, school really has been a pain. Anyhow, here's my update! If there was one thing Lou was grateful for, it was the highly-advanced control center that made monitoring missions easier. \"Confirmed visual on hostile helicopter,\" a technician suddenly said. \"Repeat, a helicopter is inbound on the area.\" \"What type?\" Lou asked. \"Sir, hostile aircraft is a Mil M-I-Twenty-Four, codenamed 'Hind.'\" The Director sighed before tapping his headset. \"Jason, it's me. Heads up, the Russian cats coming in.\" \"Roger,\" was the cool response. Lou then focused on the screen, which tracked the Hind as it moved. \"Boss,\" Jason reported in his ear, \"Fang just stepped outside. Say again, target in the open.\" \"Hold your fire,\" he ordered. \"Two more minutes and your real target'll be on the ground.\" Finally the chopper landed, its rotors still turning as the Russian stepped out with four armed guards. \"Cat's in the open sir,\" Jason said as the traitor approached the Russian. \"Take out the Russian Jason,\" Lou responded. \"Fang's no threat without the data.\" \"Copy,\" Jason said, \"target acquired. Neutralizing now.\" He then fired and the Beagle could only watched as the round penetrated the cats skull, killing him instantly. One of the technicians belatedly reported the death just before Jason suddenly fired a second shot, this one hitting Fang. \"Jason!\" Lou shouted. \"What were you thinking?\" \"Both targets-.\" \"Never mind!\" He told the Anatolian Shepherd. \"Get to the extraction point now!\" \"Wilco.\"[Chapter 6] ME: Sorry for taking so long to update guys, hope this'll be a good one. Note: There will be profanity. JASON: Moving to the waypoint sent, Jason was almost in a forest when Lou contacted him. \"Jason, bad news. The Russians Hind just took off and is searching for you now, how copy?\" \"Copy that sir,\" he responded. \"Any word on the bad guys on the ground?\" \"Maximum at least ten, not including that Mafia cats guards.\" He nodded. \"Roger, I'll do my best Director. Interrogative: We got anything to knock out that Hind?\" \"Negative Jason, you're just gonna have to avoid it and get the Hell off this island. Over.\" The Australian Shepherd shook his head. \"Negative sir, last thing I need is a bird with a fifty-cal screwing things up.\" \"Jason, do not engage the chopper. Repeat, hold your fire!\" He ignored Lou, the large attack helicopter coming into view already. Settling down behind a tree, he aimed for the main rotor. \"Three, two, one-.\" BOOM! With the main rotor now on fire the Hind lost control and began to spin around. Jason almost smiled darkly-then he noticed the Mi-24 was headed towards him. \"Aw shit!\" He cursed, the sniper now getting up and making a run for it. He almost made it too. ME: You like guys?[Chapter 7] ME: Time for a rescue. And some major cursing. DIGGS: \"Alpha One,\" Butchs said, \"this is King. How copy?\" The German Shepherd responded instantly. \"Solid copy King, go ahead boss.\" \"Agent X shot down the Russians Hind but it crashed and injured him.\" \"Damn it!\" Diggs cursed. \"Don't worry, we're already transmitting his location to your chopper. Get there and secure him for extract, over.\" He nodded. \"Understood Butch, me and my team will get it done. Out.\" Diggs turned to the pilots. \"Got his location?\" \"Yes sir!\" one of them answered. \"We'll be on station in about six-to-seven minutes!\" \"Good, but try and hurry up!\" He then addressed his team. \"Lock and load Alpha, time to earn our pay!\" The elite Task Force Zero operatives responded quickly, fastening helmets and loading their weapons. Eventually they finally arrived near the crash site. \"Can't land right now,\" the pilot reported. \"LZ is too hot.\" \"Then lemme try and cool it down!\" Diggs responded as he opened the left cabin door. \"Boot, man the minigun on the right!\" Cocking and spinning up his own minigun, Diggs fired at the FLF soldiers. Most of them were killed within the first three seconds by both him and Boot. The two survivors tried to run but were cut down. \"Alpha One to Agent X,\" he said into his radio. \"Please say status, over.\" \"X here,\" a voice coughed in response. \"Thanks for showing up Alpha, I was almost out of ammo!\" \"No problem X, sit tight. We'll get you out soon.\" He turned to the pilots. \"Get us down there!\" At his command the ropes lowered and Alpha Team rappelled down. Diggs found a wounded Anatolian Shepherd and moved to him. \"You're gonna be alright, okay?\" The dog only known as \"X\" nodded. \"HQ, Alpha One. HVI secure, I repeat, we've got X. Ready for extraction, over.\" \"Roger that Diggs,\" Butch responded. \"HQ to Alpha Team!\" Lou shouted. \"Be advised: We have fast-movers inbound! Say again, you've got fighters in the AO!\" \"Shit!\" One of the pilots cursed. \"Fuckers locked on-.\" A missile suddenly closed and detonated, reducing the Black Hawk to scrap metal. ME: Well this is just great... ","Summary":" ME: Alright, as I said in the summary, here's a story concering Jason, a reason for the existence o"},{"Movie":"Cats & Dogs","Title":"Catherine's life","Author":"AllCat09","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8295784","Passage":"[Chapter 1] A russain blue she-cat kitten was laying next to her mother, trying to sleep. She was to open her eye's to see the new world. She was afraid to see anything bad or good. Her time was now. She slowly open her to see the world. There was a flash of bright light. When everything was clear she saw everthing. She saw her brothers and sisters playing while a adult siamese tom watching them. A white she-cat kitten started walking to her. She sniffed her and started to giggle. The russain blue looked behind her to see a adult russain blue she-cat. \"Hello Catherine. I'm your mother and this is your home\", meowed her mother. The white kitten smiled. She was happy. \"My name is Winter. I'm your sister\", meowed the white kitten. Winter layed besided Catherine. Catherine was too happy to speak but she had to reply. \"Hi\", meowed Catherine. Catherine heard thumping noises. It got closer and closer. She turned her head around to see a huge person bending over her. The person grabbed her gently. Catherine started to panic. The person started to stroke her gentle. Catherine started to clam down and started to be comfortable. When the person was done, the person put down where she was and left. Winter walked over to Catherine. \"That's called a human. They give us food and love us\", meowed Winter. Catherine was happy that she has a good home. Then a adult siamese tom walked right past. It was her father. He doesn't seem happy for some reason. Then Catherine walked over to where two human's are talking. A female and a male. She heard the male say 'We have to give some cats to the shelter and have three cats'. Catherine started to panic from what he said. She started to back up a little bit and then she felt someone behind her. She turned to see her mother right behind her. \"Go to Winter. I'll handle this\", meowed her mother. Catherine ran to Winter. She had an idea. \"Hey Winter, want to play?\" questioned Catherine. \"Sure\", meowed Winter. Catherine looked around the place one more time. This is her home.[Chapter 2] It was the first day for Catherine to be outside. Days past and she grew. She felt the grass between her paws. It was very uncomfortable for her but she'd get use to it. Catherine was really close to Winter. Winter was playful, she makes Catherine happy. Catherine had a hard time getting through the door flap. Catherine looked up at the sun. It was warm. She heard birds chirping. There was bushes everywhere and a huge tree right in front of it. Catherine felt like she wanted to sleep out here. She walked of to Winter. \"Do you want to play hide-and-seek?\" questioned Catherine. Winter looked like she could sleep for a year. Winter looked up to her. \"Sure, you count over in the bushes and I'll hide\", meowed Winter. Catherine ran into the bushes and she counted. When she reached to 100, she went looking for her. When she reached to the other side of the backyard, Winter jumped on Catherine. Catherine felt a sharp pain on her ear. \"Ow! Winter why did you do that?'' questioned Catherine. Winter got off of Catherine. \"Sorry. I just did a gentle surprise attack on you. Oh my gosh! Your ear is bleeding!\" yowled Winter. Blood was on her ear. \"Let's get to our mother\", meowed Winter. Catherine and Winter walked over to her mother. \"Mom, my ear is bleeding\", meowed Catherine. Her mother licked her ear. There was a sting of pain on her ear. Her mother stopped licking on her ear. \"Tell me, how did this happen\", meowed her mother. Catherine sighed. \"Winter did a gentle surprise attack on me but accidentally scrached my ear\", meowed Catherine. Her mother looked at Winter. \"I do not want you to do that again\", she meowed. Winter sighed. \"Yes mother\", meowed Winter. Winter walked away. \"Catherine, I want to talk to you in the house\", meowed her mother. \"What is it, mother?\" meowed Catherine. Her mother was worried about Catherine. ''I goanna be gone for a while'', she meowed. Catherine was surprised. ''When are you goanna come back\", meowed Catherine. Her mother looked at her. \"Never\", meowed her mother. Catherine started to panic. \"Why?\", meowed Catherine. Her mother sighed. \"I'm goanna be taken away to a new home and your brothers and sisters are goanna come except you, Winter, and your father. I'll might see you some day but only God knows. Now go play with Winter\", meowed her mother. For the past few days, her mom was talking about God. So Catherine followed her orders and went outside. Catherine felt that she wants to cry so much because her mother, brothers, and sisters are goanna be taken away. Winter looked at Catherine. Winter felt worried about her. \"Are you okay?\" questioned Winter. Catherine looked up and tryed to get her emotions out of the way. \"Yeah, I'm fine\", meowed Catherine. Catherine looked at her mother. Why would this happen?,thought Catherine.[Chapter 3] Few days past and Catherine was still the same when she talked to her mother. Winter was worried about her. Winter tried to play with her but Catherine doesn't want to. When Catherine was trying to go to sleep, Winter walked over to her. Winter sat down near Catherine. She looked at her. Catherine acted like she wasn't there. Winter started being mad. \"Catherine, what's going on with you? You were being mean to me when you talked to mom\", hissed Winter. Catherine jumped up and walked away to her brother. Her brother's name is Nightmare. He is the same breed of Catherine. His brother was on the window, looked from the outside of the world. Winter walked to Catherine. \"Are you even goanna respond?\" yowled Winter. Catherine looked at her brother and looked down. \"If I told you what's going on with me, you won't believe me\", meowed Catherine. Catherine heard her growling. \"Can't you two bring it down!\" growled Nightmare. Yesterday, Catherine saw her mother talking to him. After that, he was different. Nightmare was going with her mother to the shelter. \"I wonder if I can explore the world all by myself\", meowed Nightmare. Nightmare laid down and went to sleep. Catherine looked at Winter. She looked calm. Catherine heard footsteps. She saw a female human walk by and Catherine's mother walked after her. Then her mom walked to Winter. \"Winter, I need you to come with me\", meowed her mom. Her mom walked to a different room with Winter walking right behind her. Catherine thought that it was the time that Winter knows the truth. When Catherine's mother was done talking to Winter, she went running to Catherine, terrified. \"So that why you were different. Mom and some of our brothers and sisters are going to be taken away?\" meowed Winter. Catherine nodded. Winter laid down next to Catherine and went to sleep. The next day, it was the day that mother and one of Catherine's kin was going to be taken to the shelter. The male human rounded up her brothers and sisters in the cage with her mother. When the male left the cage, Catherine went running to the cage, crying. \"Please mom, don't go\", begged Catherine. Her mother was brave. \"I'm sorry, I wish I could but I can't. Remember what I said\", meowed her mother. A female human picked up Catherine and put her near Winter. The male human pick up the cage and walked out of the door. Before when Catherine was goanna walk to another room, she heard the male yowled. Catherine looked at the door. It was opened. Catherine ran through the door and saw that the male was scratch. Catherine looked right and saw Nightmare running to the bushes. Catherine ran after him. Catherine wants him back in the cage so he can go to the shelter. Nightmare stopped and turned around. He was running towards Catherine. He jumped and attacked her. Nightmare got a grip on Catherine's leg. A sting of pain hit her so bad. He let go and jumped off of her. Nightmare was ready for a another challenge. Catherine got up. \"Why?\" meowed Catherine. Nightmare was growling more than ever. \"Because I'm a free cat. I have no kin and you're not my sister!\" hissed Nightmare. He turned around and ran through the bushes. Catherine's leg hurt than when Winter scratch her ear. Blood was pouring down her leg. The female human picked up Catherine and stroked her. She carried her into the house. The female human put a banaged on her leg. She finally placed her near Winter. \"I saw everything\", meowed Winter. Her father walked over to Catherine. \"You stay away from other cats or dogs. You got that?\" growled her father. Catherine nodded. Her father left her with Winter. \"I wonder why he's angry\", meowed Catherine. Catherine looked at Winter. \"Mom said 'He had a horrible past'\", meowed Winter.[Chapter 4] Four days past, Catherine is half grown and so is her sister. Her wound on her leg healed faster, now she can run. Catherine was afraid to go outside ever since Nightmare attacked her. Winter was trying to help face her fear but she can't. Catherine was sleeping. She was having a dream. She was outside, in front of the house. She was playing in the grass. Birds were chirping and the sun was bright. Then all of a sudden fire was around her, burning the trees, grass, and almost part of the house. Catherine saw her mother, standing near the flames. Catherine ran to her and all of a sudden she disappeared. She looked behind her and saw her brother, Nightmare. He started laughing and he disappeared. Catherine looked to her right and saw his father. He was yelling for her. Catherine ran to him and pressed against his fur. He felt warm and all of a sudden he turned cold. Catherine smelled death. She looked up at her father and she saw blood scars all over him. Catherine backed away, frightened. His fur and skin melt to the ground. His bones stand still and then fell to the ground. Her sister was near her and then disappeared. Catherine backed away more and felt someone behind her. She looked behind her and saw a black cat. His eyes were red. He was laughing and then attacked Catherine. \"Catherine!\" yowled Winter. Catherine flipped her eyes open. She was in her house. It was a dream but a horrible one. \"You were moving in your sleep. Did you have a nightmare?\" meowed Winter. Catherine was still afraid of her dream. She was trying to get it out of her head and respond to Winter's question. \"Yeah, a horrible one. Mom, you, Nightmare, and father were in my dream\", meowed Catherine. Catherine's eyes widened. She remembered the horrible part were her father died. Catherine jumped up. \"Where's dad?\" questioned Catherine. Winter got worried. \"In the living room\", meowed Winter. Catherine ran to the living room. She saw her father sleeping on the floor. Catherine ran to him and press against his fur. She woke her father up. \"What's going on?\" growled her father. Winter ran to her father. \"She had a horrible nightmare. I think it has something of you in her dream that was so bad\", meowed Winter. Father was surprised. He got up and pressed against her. She felt warm from his coat. She heard him purring. \"Don't worry. Nothing won't happen to me, I promise\", meowed her father. Catherine backed away and went to Winter. \"Winter there's a lot of stuff I need you to know about my dream. Father was dead, you and the others keep disappearing and then this strange was near me\", meowed Catherine. \"What breed?\" questioned Winter. Catherine was trying to remember. \"I think a domestic cat. A black one. It attacked me\", meowed Catherine. Winter was focused on her. \"Anything else?\" questioned Winter. Catherine sighed. \"Flames were all around me, burning everything\", meowed Catherine. Catherine didn't say more. Her father walked over to Catherine and Winter. \"We should go outside\", meowed her father. Catherine was not ready but she has to go outside. Winter and Catherine were playing tag. At least Winter was not doing any surprise attacks. Catherine was nervous. She thinks that Nightmare could jump out of nowhere and attack. Winter stopped playing. Catherine and Winter were taking some deep breaths. \"I'm goanna talk to our father. You stay here\", meowed Winter. Winter walked over to her father to talk to him. Catherine walked near the fence. She laid down on the grass. The shadow of the fence was cooling her off. Catherine felt like she was being watched. Catherine a jump and something hit the fence. Catherine looked up and a male black and white cat was on the fence. Catherine jumped up, afraid. \"What do you want?\" meowed Catherine. The cat was standing there, looking at her. \"Stay away from other cats\", he meowed. Catherine was surprised. Her father almost said the same thing. Catherine heard running paw steps. Catherine looked right behind her. She saw Winter and her father running toward Catherine. \"Get away!\" yowled her father. The cat turned around, jumped off the fence and ran. Her father got right next to Catherine. \"Are you all right\", meowed her father. Catherine nodded. Winter lick her forehead to comfort her. \"Let's get inside\", meowed her father. Catherine and Winter were about to go to sleep but Catherine needed to talk to Winter. \"Winter, that cat told me to stay away from other cats\", meowed Catherine. Winter looked at her. Winter nodded and went to sleep. \"I just hope you understand what I'm going through\", meowed Catherine. The next day was the first time to be out in the front yard. Her father was watching them. Winter was rolling in the grass. Catherine was looking at the sun. A warm touch hit her. Catherine looked at her father. He walked through the house. Catherine felt like she was unprotected. She walked over to her sister. \"Did you think of any of the words I said last night\", hissed Catherine. Winter got up. \"Yes and I think he's right\", meowed Winter. Catherine grunted. \"But why did he want me to stay away from the other cats\", meowed Catherine. Winter was standing there, thinking. Then Catherine smelled something. It was smoke. Catherine heard running footsteps. She saw her owners running out of the house. She looked at Winter. She was frightened by something. Catherine turned around and saw fire coming their way. \"What now?\" meowed Winter. Catherine was frightened to speak. Then she saw dogs running to unknown cats and attacking them. Catherine saw the cat that was in her dreams. Winter ran near the house on the porch. Catherine stand her ground. She was started not to be afraid. The black cat walking Catherine and then stopped. He looked at her. \"You're not afraid of me. Well, you should be\", he meowed. When he attacked her, she closed her eyes and nothing happened. She opened her eyes and saw her father pinned him down. He looked at Catherine. \"Get your sister and run to the forest\", ordered her father. Catherine ran to her sister. \"Come on\", meowed Catherine. Winter followed and they went in the forest. They kept on running. There was a long hill that leads to a road. Catherine saw a ditch. Catherine ran to the ditch and went through it. Winter did the same. Catherine still smelled smoke. Catherine looked out of the ditch. She saw little bit of fire. Then there was a shadow. It was her father. She heard a yowl from the distances. Her father ran to left side and she didn't see him. She saw a dark shadow following him. Catherine started to cry of worry. When she couldn't see them, she heard a loud yowl. It was a death yowl.[Chapter 5] Catherine opened her eyes. She was sleeping through the night with her sister. Catherine heard no birds or anything. She looked at the end of the tunnel. There was daylight. Catherine nudged Winter with her paw. Winter groaned and turned her head to Catherine. \"It's daytime and everything's quiet,\" meowed Catherine. Catherine got up on her paws and stretched while Winter did the same. Catherine walked to the end of the tube and poked her head out. Catherine saw ashes falling down like rain. Catherine and her sister got out of the ditch and looked around. A sudden realization came to her. Her bad dream came true. She and her sister need to find her dad. She turned her head to her sister. \"We need to look for dad. You go left and I'll go right,\" meowed Catherine. Catherine ran up the hill and went left. She turned her head around to see her sister running in the left side of the forest. Catherine continued running until it was a dead end. Father couldn't go this far, thought Catherine. She turned and ran back. She left like she was losing energy. She stopped running and took a few breaths. She wasn't at the ditch yet. Suddenly she heard a terrifying yowl. It was Winter. Catherine started running quickly as fast as she can. She saw something white. It was her sister and she was trembling. When she got close enough to see what the problem is, it was her father. Terror and fear struck her for what she is seeing. His belly was ripped opened and he was not breathing. Catherine's father was dead. Catherine was trembling. She looked around to see blood stains everywhere. How bad this can get, thought Catherine. Catherine walked closer to her father and put her head on his pelt. His body was so cold like snow. Catherine got up and looked at her sister. Her fear has died down. \"What are we going to do,\" meowed Winter. Catherine looked at Winter to her dead father to her sister again. \"We go back to our owners,\" meowed Catherine. Catherine got up on her paws and walked while her sister follows. When they got out of the forest, everything Catherine saw was a nightmare. A lot of homes destroyed and some dead cats laying around in different properties. Catherine looked at her house and it was the only one standing but looked burned. She walked on the porch and got through the cat flap. The house looked normal but so empty. Why is the house empty, thought Catherine. She heard her sister got through the cat flap. Catherine started searching the house for her owners but did not find them. Catherine got worried then something just came to her. Her emotion changed to worried to anger. They left us! They didn't care to search for us! Thanks to them my father is dead, thought Catherine. She stalked to the living and stopped. She sat down and been growling for a few minutes. Winter got up and walked to her sister. She sat near her sister and Catherine didn't care to notice. \"Why are you angry,\" meowed Winter. Catherine stopped growling and looked at her sister. \"Can't you see it?! Our owners left us! They don't care for us! If they looked for us, our father wouldn't be dead!\" hissed Catherine. Winter was surprised at her angry. Catherine looked down and began growling. \"Catherine they couldn't find us because we were in the forest. They do know that we can't go that far. The fire was spreading and they had to leave. If they stayed here, it would be the end for them. And why would you blame them for our fathers death even they had two problems that only one needs to be solved?\" meowed Winter. Catherine stopped growling and her anger begin to fade. She thought what her sister said. She tried to speak but she choked on her own words. Catherine tried again. \"I'm sorry. I wasn't thinking straight. I should blame the black cat who killed my father,\" meowed Catherine. Winter started to be happy. A lot of days past while Catherine and Winter were staying at the house. They started growing thin and hungry. Catherine goes to the woods to hunt for prey but can't. Catherine began looking out the window throughout her days. She hasn't seen a car go by or a single human being. Everything in Catherine's world seemed empty. She had no hope left. Part of Catherine wants to leave the house and face the world. The other part of Catherine wants to stay at the house. Catherine can't make up her mind. One day, when she went in the back yard, she saw a dead tree in front of her. Dead leaves blow through the wind and no bird sang. It was hard to see from where she born turned into trash. Catherine made up her mind. Catherine turned around and head to the door. Winter was sleeping in the leaving room. She looked peaceful even though her ribs were sticking out. Her stomach growled for hunger but that didn't make Winter wake up. Catherine walked over to Winter and nudged her sister with her paw. Winter waked up and stared at Catherine. \"What do you want\", moaned Winter. Catherine wasn't sure if she was goanna say it right or not. Catherine sighed. \"Winter, we're goanna have to leave the house and find a new home,\" meowed Catherine. There it is. Finaly got this done! I feel so great. I'm goanna work on my other chapter now! BYE![Chapter 6] \"What! Have you got bees in your brain!\" protested Winter. \"We are staying.\" Catherine looked at her sister. Catherine gave her a hard stare. \"Winter, either you want to stay and starve to death or find a new home,\" meowed Catherine. Winter's anger began to fade. Her sister turned around and walked to the cat flap that leads to the back yard. When her sister got through the cat flap, Catherine followed. Catherine saw her sister looking at her paws. Catherine walked up to Winter and sat down next to her. Winter looked at her sister. \"Catherine, this place is our home. I don't want to leave it,\" said Winter. \"But if we stay here, we'll die of starvation,\" Catherine pointed out. Winter stayed silent for a few minutes and then finally responded. \"Alright, I'll go with your plan,\" meowed Winter. Catherine and Winter turned around and went through the cat flap. They walked to the front door and walked out of another cat flap. Catherine walked down the steps and continued to walk till she reached the side walk. Catherine turned around to see her sister following her. They kept walking for ten minutes, walking past burned houses. Now there was only a road and trees on the sides. Catherine stopped walking. I remember mom telling me that this road can lead to a city, thought Catherine. She continued walking. An hour past and Catherine was still on the path. Where will the trees end? Will there be any way to see a field or the city? , thought Catherine. She heard thunder. She stopped and looked up to see dark clouds. I must continue, thought Catherine. She continued walking. Winter stopped walking. \"Catherine its goanna rain! We must take shelter,\" meowed Winter. Catherine stopped walking and turned around. \"No. If we kept on walking then we'll maybe find a home,\" meowed Catherine. Winter stared at her. \"No, we can't. What if there's a tornado or a flood,\" meowed Winter. Catherine growled. \"Look around you! Do you see an ocean that can cause a flood!\" growled Catherine. Winter started to growl a little bit. \"Catherine trust me on this, please,\" begged Winter. Catherine stayed silent. She's right all along, thought Catherine. \"Okay, but we can't shelter in the woods. We'll go further and see if we find anything. If not, we'll shelter in the woods,\" meowed Catherine. Winter nodded. So, they continued walking. Catherine opened you mouth to sniff the air. She smelled grass, road, and trees. Nothing different, thought Catherine. Catherine put her head down and still walked. Twenty minutes past with no rain. Catherine still had her head down by the time. She sighed. Her stomach growled. No rain, no sign of a place, and no trees. What a minute! No trees! , thought Catherine. She looked up to see a town but no city. Well at least there's a town, thought Catherine. Catherine saw a store. She looked at her sister. \"I got an idea,\" meowed Catherine. Catherine scratched the back door. She stepped back to see what will happen. The door opened and male person stepped out. Catherine meowed to catch his attention. He looked down to see Catherine. Winter was hiding beneath the steps. \"Aw, what a cute little cat. You look hungry. Stay right there and I'll go get you something,\" said the male human. He walked back in and closed the door. A minute later, the human opened to door and had a bowl of chicken in his hand. Catherine's mouth was watering. He put the food bowl down in front of Catherine. When he went back inside, Winter got out of the stairs. They started eating. The chicken was warm and juicy. That's how Catherine likes. \"That's some juicy chicken there, eh?\" came a voice. Catherine froze. She turned her head around to see an old dark brown tom. Catherine was frightened as Winter was. \"What do you want,\" meowed Catherine. The old cat laughed. \"Don't worry. I won't fight you or take your food,\" meowed the old cat. Catherine understood him because he was well feed. \"My name is Dirt. Kind of a stupid name by I'll live with it. I see your travel. What are you traveling for?\" meowed Dirt. \"My name is Catherine and this is my sister, Winter. We are traveling to find a new home,\" meowed Catherine. Dirt nodded. \"Ok, I'll go now,\" meowed Dirt. Catherine walked up to Dirt. \"Before you go, can you show us a place to shelter in when we are finished eating?\" questioned Catherine. Dirt nodded. When they finished eating, Dirt leads them to the dumpster. \"You can shelter there from the rain. Try to ignore the smell,\" rasped Dirt. Catherine looked at the dumpster and looked back at Dirt. \"Thank you. Where will you shelter?\" meowed Catherine. Dirt stayed silent for a few seconds. \"I have somewhere else to shelter and your welcome,\" meowed Dirt. Catherine nodded. She saw Dirt turn around and ran somewhere the Catherine doesn't know. Winter and Catherine got under the dumpster. It was getting dark and it finally rain. Winter looked at Catherine. \"So, where are we going to go,\" meowed Winter. Catherine looked at Winter. \"Mom told me if we follow the road, the one we walked on, will lead us to a city. We are going to that city,\" meowed Catherine. The sun came up and Catherine was sleeping. Winter nudged her sister with her paw. Catherine opened her eyes. \"Time to wake up,\" meowed Winter. Catherine struggled on her paws. They got out of the dumpster. Catherine and her sister continued to follow the road. They past a lot of stores and some houses. Some cars past while they were walking. Catherine's stomach growled. She looked at her sister. \"Are you hungry?\" questioned Catherine. Winter nodded. Catherine scratched at a hard door. Catherine stepped back. Next to the door is a dumpster and Winter was under the dumpster. The door opened and female human walked out. Catherine meowed. She looked down to see Catherine. \"Aw. Wait right there,\" said the female human. The human went back in and closed the door. A minute past and the female human came out the door with a bowl of sardines. She placed it in front of Catherine and went back inside. Winter got out of the dumpster and they started eating out of the bowl. The sardines were tender and juicy. By the time they were finished, they continued on their journey. It was getting a little hotter than it used to. The sidewalk was burning Catherine's pads. Catherine stopped and licked her paws. She looked at her sister. She was doing the same thing. \"I assume your pads are burning like mine,\" meowed Catherine. Winter stopped licking her paws and looked at Catherine. \"Yes. I wish there was a faster way to get to the city,\" meowed Winter. Catherine nodded. Catherine and her sister stopped at a gas station. They went to the back of the gas station. Catherine decided to persuade another person for food. \"I wouldn't do that if I were you,\" came a voice. Catherine turned around to see a white she-cat. She looked the same as Winter but she taller than her. \"If I were you, I would find a cozy home with humans that would love you and feed you,\" meowed the she-cat. Catherine looked at the white she-cat with a hard stare. \"That's what we're trying to do. What do you want?\" hissed Catherine. The she-cat looked at her. \"Calm down. I don't want anything from you. My name is Snow,\" meowed Snow. Catherine was surprised the Snow's name similar to her sisters name. \"My name is Catherine and this is my sister, Winter,\" meowed Catherine. Snow was silent for a few minutes. \"Are you an agent, working for M.E.O.W.S.?\" meowed Snow. Catherine was confused. Winter looked at Catherine. \"Let's go. I think she's crazy,\" whispered Winter. Catherine looked at her sister. \"No. I want to know what's she's saying,\" whispered Catherine. Catherine walked forward a little bit. \"No. What's M.E.O.W.S.?\" questioned Catherine. Snow stared at her. \"You must have heard about M.E.O.W.S. M.E.O.W.S. stands for Mousers Enforcing Our World Safety. They protect the world from evil cats and evil dogs. We protect humans, cats, and dogs. Well, used to protect dogs,\" meowed Snow. Catherine felt amazed from what Snow was telling her. \"A few days ago, a black cat named Midnight, made a big fire and tricked dogs to kill innocent cats. We got rid of him easily. Now DOG HQ, another agency that dogs protect humans, are treating us like enemies because of what Midnight did,\" Snow went on. A realization hit Catherine. \"I was there when that happened. That black cat killed my father,\" growled Catherine. Snow stared at Catherine with amazement and shock in her eyes. \"I'm sorry for your lose,\" meowed Snow. Catherine nodded as a response. \"So, are you really an agent?\" questioned Catherine. Winter looked down at Catherine. \"Kind of. I'm an apprentice. I'm training to be an agent. Today, is my first day being on the surface to portal the area,\" meowed Snow. Catherine understood. Winter did not believe a word she was saying. \"Hey, I got an idea. Would you want to join M.E.O.W.S.?\" meowed Snow. Catherine's happiness faded. \"I don't know,\" meowed Catherine. Snow turned around. \"That's what I thought. You're too young to understand,\" meowed Snow. Catherine saw that she was leaving. Catherine ran in front of her. \"Can I at least think about your offer?\" questioned Catherine. Snow stared at her. \"I don't think so. My leader has to decide if he wants you. Here, have this,\" meowed Snow. Snow took her red collar off and placed it in front of Catherine. \"Take it with you. When my leader decides to have you, he'll track you down by the collar. If not, you can have it,\" meowed Snow. Catherine nodded. \"There's one more question I want to ask. Do you know how to get to the city, across the bridge,\" questioned Catherine. Snow was confused. \"Now I understand. The city is called San Francisco and the bridge is called Golden Bridge. I know want to do. Follow me,\" meowed Catherine. Catherine and her sister were following to a truck. It was not the big one, just similar to the cars. Snow turned to them. \"Get in the trunk and don't let the human see you,\" meowed Snow. Catherine and Winter climbed in the trunk. Catherine turned to Snow. \"How do you know what you're doing?\" questioned Catherine. \"I might have heard a human that owns this truck was going to San Francisco, crossing the Golden Bridge. And Catherine don't give up on your sister. She's all you've got,\" meowed Snow. She's right, thought Catherine. \"Thank you,\" meowed Catherine. Snow nodded. Snow turned around and ran. One day past. The truck stopped at a hotel and the human stayed there for the night. Catherine and her sister were sleeping. The sound of the roaring engine waked Catherine up. She looked at her sister. She was sleeping. Man, she's a heavy sleeper, thought Catherine. Catherine smelled car and salt water. Catherine got up and looked out to see what's going on. She was amazed of what she was seeing. There was a beautiful ocean. She looked around. She was on a bridge that kind of looks like gold. She was on the Golden Bridge. THERE IT IS! Sorry, if it's long. I have found a awesome music theme for this story. Here's the link. If the link is messed up, I'll put the link in the reveiws. watch?v=6NbyUtARW6I&feature;=plcp[Chapter 7] Catherine was happy that the car finally crossed the bridge. I finally made it, thought Catherine. Catherine turned to her sister. I mean, we finally made it, thought Catherine. Catherine walked to her Sister. She nudged her sister with her paw. Winter's eyes opened and she looked at Catherine. \"We're here,\" meowed Catherine. Winter got up on her paws. Her sister yawned and stretched. Catherine felt the movement of the car stop. Catherine grabbed Snow's collar and jumped of the trunk. Winter did the same. Her sister looked around. \"So, where is our new home?\" questioned Winter. Catherine looked around. She saw tall buildings and a lot of cars. She got worried. What if we can't find a home, thought Catherine. She looked at the sister. \"I guess we have to find one,\" suggested Catherine. Catherine and her sister walked down a sidewalk. Catherine saw a calico cat. He was a young one. Catherine stopped walking. She put Snow's collar down. \"Excuse me, do you know where to get a home?\" questioned Catherine. The calico looked at him. \"Everywhere is your home,\" meowed the calico. Catherine was confused. \"Is there any mobile homes?\" questioned Catherine. The cat looked at her. \"Follow me,\" ordered the calico. Catherine grabbed her Snow's collar and followed. Winter was worried. Her sister somehow doesn't trust strangers. The calico walked down the street. Now, there were three directions of roads. \"You go on the left side of the street. Keep following it and it will lead you to mobile homes,\" meowed the calico. Catherine was happy. Now my sister and I can find a new home, thought Catherine. She put down Snow's collar. \"By the way, who are you?\" questioned Catherine. It was too late. Catherine turned around and the calico was gone. She was kind of upset that she didn't get to know him. She turned to her sister. \"Well. Let's take the road from …whoever that cat said,\" meowed Catherine. Catherine knew her sister wasn't following her. \"We are not going in that direction. It might be a trap,\" scowled Winter. Catherine stared at her. \"Trap or not, we are going,\" meowed Catherine. Catherine walked on the road that the calico told her. Winter had no choice but to follow her sister. Catherine felt a little better. She felt that she will find a new home. She and her sister continued walking on the road. A lot of cars pasted. It took a half an hour to walk the road. There were no sign mobile homes. Now there were trees. No cities. No mobile homes. Catherine became angry. Again with the trees, thought Catherine. She calmed down. She was not giving up. Another half an hour past, no sign of mobile homes. This was just the same thing that happened from the day before. Catherine wished that the fire and her father's death had never happened. Twenty minutes past and there were no sign of trees. There were a few stores. They walked past the few stores. Catherine's stomach growled. She ignored it. Now, there were two roads that lead to somewhere. Catherine became angry. \"What the heck!? Are you freaking serious!\" yowled Catherine. Winter went to her sister's side. \"Calm down. Let's just turn around and go back,\" meowed Winter with a worried meow. Catherine was still angry. \"No, darn it! We are not turning around and go with that again!\" hissed Catherine. Catherine walked in the road in the right direction. Her sister followed. Now there were more trees! Catherine was more furious than ever but she kept walking. Five minutes past and Catherine's anger suddenly faded. She saw mobile homes. Real mobile homes! Catherine was happy. The calico was correct but somehow didn't remember some of the road directions, thought Catherine. Catherine looked at her sister. She seemed happy and surprised at the same time. Her sister looked at Catherine. \"Now what?\" questioned Winter. Catherine was too happy. \"We find a new home,\" meowed Catherine. They went to a few houses. Some of the humans were mean and throw stuff at them. Some would just ignore them. Catherine's happiness faded. Finding a home might be hard to get, thought Catherine. Catherine and her sister continued walking on the sidewalk. A female human took notice of them. The female person walks toward Catherine. Catherine saw the human. She could sense her sister trying to hide from the human. Catherine knows that her sister thinks the human is trying to attack but not. Catherine stands her ground. The female human kneeled down in front of Catherine. She put her hand out and pet on Catherine's head. Winter started to ease from what she is seeing. Another female human appeared but she was a child. She looked like she was 8 or 10 years old. She was the female person's daughter. She squealed with joy when she saw Catherine. She ran to Catherine and petted her, quickly. \"Mom, can we keep them?\" questioned the child. The child's mother was thinking for a while. The adult finally respond. \"Alright, they can stay with us,\" said the adult. The adult put the Catherine and Winter in there homes. It was a nice looking house. The smell of tthe house was sweet. Soft couches. Everything Catherine needs is this house. This is Catherine's new home. I'm finally done! Sorry, it's short. Anyways, thanks for the reveiws. And thank for the review that is from Dead Wolf Walking. That reveiw helped me to finish this chapter. THANK YOU!

This is AU so the facts don't match up. Get over it...lol. In this story Margaret does not die from her fall. The Asher's also have a college age daughter named Caroline. Conner is 10 and in grade school and there is one on the way. Asher was not the typical man. He was gentle. He had the ability to control a situation without ever raising his voice or causing anyone to be hurt. He was definitely a sense of humor person. He was the one that started a reward program to let people know good behavior pays off. He was more than the president. He was a loving husband and father. He had two children. Caroline was adopted from birth. She was eighteen and in her first year of college. Conner was ten. He had come along and was literally a surprise. They were beyond happy. They had the world at their fingertips. Margaret once said that the greatest and scariest part of love is allowing yourself to be vulnerable. GOD was that ever true. After her accident she nearly died. He was by her side every minute only leaving to go to the bathroom or take care of any other functional needs as well as to take care of Conner. Thankfully that was all behind them now. Well, it was sort of behind them. Margaret had some residual damage from her accident. She lost her long term memory. She knew Connor and Caroline and Ben for example but she couldn't remember her parents or siblings to save her life. The doctors said the damage could last for weeks or years or anything in between. It did not matter. This could have been so much worse.[Chapter 2] Chapter 2: Benjamin's Reasons Asher was talking to a bunch of his friends when Conner walked in the room. \"Hey Buddy,\" Asher said smiling at his son. \"Dad,\" Conner said, \"Ryan's having a sleepover tonight and he invited me. Can I go?\" Conner looked so excited Ben just wanted to grin. \"Well what are the plans for the sleep over,\" he asked. \"He said we're going to the mall, then out for rocky road and then come back to his house and use the trampoline until we have to go to sleep.\" Ben didn't even have to think about it. He wanted his children to have a chance to be children. \"It's alright with me kiddo,\" he said, \"Of course if you were going to a concert that would be a different story.\" Conner laughed. \"Thanks dad. I love you.\" \"Love you too kiddo,\" Ben said hugging his son. As soon as Conner left Mike looked at Ben. \"Do you really think it's a good idea to let him go to the mall?\" \"Why,\" Ben asked, \"Is there a buggy monster in the mall?\" Everyone laughed. \"No but there could be... problems,\" Mike said, \"He'd be with a bunch of friends his own age.\" \"And a couple of big strong guys,\" Ben added, \"Following him at a distance and ready to intervene if there is a problem.\" \"But why have them follow him at a distance,\" Mike asked, \"Why not-\" \"Why not let my kid stand out and not have a chance to be a child,\" Ben interrupted, \"Because he's 10 years old and when you have kids you'll realize that 1) you have to chose your battles and 2) you cannot let your children live in fear. Sure, bad things happen in life sometimes but you cannot let fear control you. Also as we have all found out life can be unpredictable sometimes.\"[Chapter 3] Chapter 3: Opposing Points Of View \"I guess I'll find out soon enough,\" Mike said, \"Leah is expecting a baby in a little over six months.\" \"Congratulations,\" everyone said. \"Thanks,\" Mike replied, \"But I'm scared as hell.\" \"Mike,\" Ben said, \"I know we've had our differences in the past but let me tell you something. You are going to make an excellent father. You have heart and you have instinct and you will do anything for the people you love.\" \"I hate to interrupt this sentimental moment,\"Tucker said, \"But we have a serious issue at hand. You know what I'm talking about Benjamin.\" \"Yes,\" Ben said, \"I am aware of what you're talking about. We have to change the codes is all.\" \"Someone has to be held accountable for what happened,\" Tucker argued. \"I understand that,\" Ben replied, \"I will take responsibility.\" \"Why,\" Tucker asked, \"You did nothing wrong.\" \"I know,\" Benjamin said, \"But Margaret hasn't done anything wrong either. Her brain isn't working correctly.\" \"I just think-\" \"Good,\" Ben said, \"Thinking is a wonderful thing\" \"Now it's little codes sir,\" Tucker said, \"But what happens next time. Suppose it's something that can change the future of America. Maybe... maybe it's time to put certain things back on the table.\" Ben raised an eyebrow. \"Put yourself in my shoes Tucker,\" he said, \"What would you do?\" \"I'm just saying that it may be time to consider people don't have the ability to learn without... painful or significant consequences.\" \"Being a father for 18 years has convinced me otherwise,\" Ben replied. \"Are you saying you never punish your children,\" Tucker asked. \"Not even once,\" Ben said, \"and Caroline is in Yale and Conner is on the honor role and they are both the most respectful, polite and well behaved children I know.\" \"Ben can we continue this tomorrow,\" Tyler asked, \"I promised my daughter I would be there for her play tonight.\" \"She's in the chorus,\" Tucker said. \"So what,\" Benjamin replied, \"Meeting adjourned. I'll see you all tomorrow\"[Chapter 4] Chapter 4 The Mall Before mike left to go watch Connor ben asked mike to text him when he found Connor and intervene if there is a problem. The rest of that night Connor was at the mall with his friends and mike was watching from a distance just enough that Connor would not see him. Right when mike found Connor he texted ben saying i have found sparkplug two minutes later ben texted mike back saying good what is he doing mike texted back saying him and his friends are going into the Lego store ben texted back saying ok. After that mike continued to watch Connor and then Connor and his friends left the mall and so did mike. Connor and his friends went to get rocky road ice cream then went to his friend Luke's house for the sleepover mike found a place to sit away from the house but just enough to watch the sleepover. All the boys talked about where girls and who they liked after that they went to bed.[Chapter 5] Chapter 5 : Connor The next day before the boys got up mike left where he was. When the boys got up mike texted Connor saying he was going to pick him up from the sleepover Connor texted mike back saying ok see you in a few minutes. Mike picked up Connor and on there way home Connor said \"mike I don't feel good\" just after Connor said that he fainted mike called ben and said \"ben Connor just fainted\" ben said \"ok mike bring him home and put him to bed\" mike said \"ok ben see you in a few minutes\". Right when mike pulled up to the white house mike picked up Connor and took him to his room. Right after mike left Connors room he went to find ben to tell him that Connor is safe. Ben went into Connor's room to check on him and Connor woke up and asked what happened then mike came in and said \"kiddo when I was bringing you home from the sleepover you fainted in the car so I called your dad to let him know that you were ok you just fainted\" Connor said \"thank you mike for letting my dad know that i was ok\" mike said \"anytime kiddo it's my job to protect you and your family\", Then Connor asked if he was going to be alright so ben went to fell his head and said that he was burning up so they have to take him to the doctors. Connor said ok dad so ben and mike left Connors room and Connor went back to sleep mike stayed by Connors door all night to make sure Connor was ok.[Chapter 6] Chapter 6 The next day connor got up and still did not feel good so ben and mike took him to the doctors. The doctor was about one hour away so Connor slept in the car the whole way there when he woke up he was at the docters. Ben took him in and mike followed them in and the doctor said to Connor \"you will be fine you have to get your tonsils taken out after the operation you will get all the ice cream you want\". Connor Ben and mike all looked at each other and Connor Ben and mike all said at the same time \"ok doctor\" so they scheduled the surgery for 10 a.m. the next day. So mike and ben and connor all left and mike and ben took connor back home and connor went to bed when he woke up he could not talk. The next day mike and Ben took Connor to the hospital to get his tonsils taken out. After the surgery connor started to wake up and the first thing connor saw was ben, and ben asks connor how he was feeling and connor just nods ok. The doctor came in to connor's room and told ben and mike the hospital wants to keep Connor there for 2 days to keep an eye on him, so ben said \"ok\" so ben tells mike to stay with Connor because ben has a country to run so one of the other secret service men took ben back to the white house and mike and the rest of Connor's secret service detail stayed at the hospital with Connor. The rest of that day Connor slept and the doctor came in every hour to check on him and mike asked the doctor every once and awhile how Connor is doing and the just said he is doing ok. The next day Connor slept part of the day and his mom dad and sister came in to visit him and make sure that he was ok.

Allan pointed his finger at him. Finding nothing to say he lowered it. \"ROLL the maps.\" he finished setting the newly rolled maps on the fold out tables. I rolled my eyes this time. \"You two should really stop fighting.\" I grunted. In what I said, I wasn't expecting to get a response. \"Well Phoenix, you didn't fold the maps did you.\" Rabbit said raising a brow. \"Yep, Rab, you caught me. I folded it straight through Wichita.\" I stated blandly, yawning in the process. He scowled at us both. \"What am I going to do with you two?\" He muttered walking off. Allan gave a toothy grin. \"Nice.\" He said lifting me up from my spot on the ground. A red shiny truck rounded the corner and headed this way. Allan caught sight of it too. \"Who is that?\"[Chapter 2] O.K. I wanted to thank my Subscribers to my story 'Huntin'. I SWEAR that I will update this one next before my others. It'll will be up probably this Saturday/Sunday. I pinky swear with you guys. I know I don't have any reviews, but I know that there are subscribers. Thanks to: LambchopMagee, and My-Endless-Destiny. SO, rawr! Check out my new story 'Saviour'. It's a Walking Dead fic with Shane/OC/Daryl. Well randomness: I'm getting my hair dyed Black and bright Blue today. It's super short in the back and in an angle in the front. It looks a lot like Saviours OC. Ttylxox xD B-B-Be my BFF 'cause IDK what's comin' next LMHO with the rest TYYLXOX[Chapter 3] Well, it turned out to be Bill, our poor captain's husband and previous storm hunter. From the looks of it, (by there being a preppy looking brunette woman in the passenger) Bill was here to get the signed divorce papers from Jo. Our poor, poor captain. Half the crew knows that she still loves Bill and the ones who haven't noticed are probably just that ignorant. No offence to the beloved crew. Bill was grinning when he stuck out his index and thumb to make it look like he was shooting us before rolling to a stop. \"Hey, I don't believe it!\" Rabbit shouted with laughter in his voice as a smiling Bill came out. \"Who is that handsome devil!\" I laughed at Rabbit's and Allan's remarks. I gave a whistle to add to the joke. The smile rolled of my face as I saw the brunette step out of the car. She seemed nice, but she was dressed in really nice clothing, not fit for the weather. Another smile came onto my face. It was actually more of a smirk. She'll regret wearing that skirt. Next to us, Dustin was crouching, in all his glory, with his orange cap and hoody hanging off his head. He pointed to Bill. \"EXTREME! IT'S THE EXTREME!\" He clapped his hands once and walked over, giving a hysterical laugh. I gave a larger grin while Bill gave him a shadow of a smile. \"Aw come on Dusty. Don't start that shit\" He said while Dustin gave him a huge bear hug. Allan tugged on the bottom of my shirt. I gave a 'hmm' and looked away from the scene. \"Can you help me with this?\" I looked down and every time he tried to roll out the maps, they would fold right back up. I sighed while nodding, placing rocks on two corners and he got the others. I started to laugh some. Allan raised his eyebrow and I shook my head. \"It's Rabbit's fault,\" I said while chuckling. \"If the maps were folded, they would have laid out easier.\" Allan snickered as Rabbit thumped me on the head with a book. I hissed and rubbed my now knotted head. \"If they were folded, some of the roads would be so creased, we wouldn't be able to see them. We would then eventually get lost and or would have harder time getting to the storm.\" He finished his lecture with a roll of his eyes and a smile. I stuck my tongue out. Allan laughed harder. \"He got you there\" \"What is up with you guys picking on me lately?\" I scowled. A cough interrupted Allan before he could tease me some more on his next comment. We glanced over to the skirt-wearing woman. \"Sorry to interrupt your love hate relationship, but Bill left to get the papers from Jo and well….. I'm Melissa.\" She said stretching out her hand to me. I was very surprised at her out-stretched hand, but I shook it anyway. \"Phoenix. You can call me Nix, Nicky, Phoe (fee), whatever floats your boat.\" I said a little dully. She smiled. \"I heard you're a painter! Could you, perhaps, teach me some? I'm not very good.\" I heard laughter disguised by coughing behind me. My eye twitched. Chances are that I'm never going to see her again. It would take too long. I scratched my head and squinted. \"Maybe sometime different. I've got a lot to do.\" I said relaxing and forcing a smile. Her smile fell, but she got all-happy again. \"Oh! Okay, I understand. Here's my card, call me some time!\" She said all peppy. I think a vein popped. I slowly took the card and forced another smile. I could almost see her hopping away. Ridiculous laughter was behind me when she was out of sight. \"How ditsy can she get! Learn how to pain from an expert!\" \"It takes years to learn what you know Nix!\" \"Oh, and call me what you like! Nicole or Fee-Fee~!\" They busted into fits of laughter. I growled and snatched Rabbit's book and hit them with it. \"Shut up! I didn't say Nicole or Fee-Fee! I was trying to be polite for God's sake!\" The paused and looked at each other before snickering and going off to what they were doing before. I shoved the card into my back pocket and fell lazily to the ground. OK Sorry the last one was so short but I didn't have enough time. Since Summer break is coming up, I will be updating more often. But ugh! Testing is in three days. Wish me luck. I just typed two chapters in one day for two different stories and I'm exhausted. Review, message and read. Hugs and kisses. Ja ne~[Chapter 4] \"Son of a-!\" Phoenix rose a brow at Allan from her position on the ground. He had burned his hand while checking the engine of the truck again. That was one weird thing about the truck. The engine was always warm, even after an hour of leaving it off. Another weird fact was that the camper on the back of the truck recently started to smell like tacos. Rabbit blamed it on the night when the group had Taco Bell. A few drinks later, Dusty had passed out in the camper. The next morning , it smelled like tacos, which was no big deal until the smell did go away. The whole thing was blamed on Dusty. 'His farts last night must have embedded into the carpet.' Rabbit leaned out of the window with slight smirk evident his face. \"What? Have you forgotten how to change the oil?\" Allan gave a glare to Rabbit as he leaned to the right. \"No. It's not my fault your truck is messed up.\" Rabbit's hand must have hit the window switch because the window came down (obviously) and he hit his elbow pretty hard on the window. He gave a grunt and ducked back in. It was Allan's turn to smirk while Phoenix kept a straight but slightly twitching face. \"That's what you get Rabbit.\" Phoenix stated. \"Karma,\" Allan shook his head. \"Look, I'm going over to Bill and Jo. I'm done working on this for now,\" He said while wiping his greasy hands off. \"You can come if you want.\" He took a swig of water before heading over to the now forming crowd. \"Yeah, wait up.\" Phoenix stood up and brushed the dirt off the back of her faded blue jeans. There was a bit of dirt on the front and some caked onto her knees where they were ripped. She faced Rabbit who bravely rested his chin on the window. \"I know you are bored too, no need to act all 'whatever'.\" Rabbir rolled his eyes and stepped out of the car. \"Oh, I'm not acting all 'whatever', you just want me to come with you and you know it.\" He grinned, walking alongside her. Phoenix gave a laugh. \"Ah! You know it!\" She shoved his side. \"Will you two come on? I'm not going to wait forever ya know!\" Allan said, clearly annoyed that the two were walking like snails. Technically slithering. Or sliding. Doesn't matter. Sorry it's so short! What do you think snails do? I FINALLY wrote in third person. I found out that I could not write in third person, whatsoever .

She craned her neck but could only make out McDonald's back. It couldn't be him …or could it. No, it couldn't. She had been back in New York for a week and was currently confined to her desk. At least she was out of the hospital; she had gotten tired of staring at an extremely sterile looking white wall. Eric had visited her every day, he claimed it was so she wouldn't drive the nurses crazy with her oh so charming personality. It was surprising really, how you could go from loving someone, to hating someone, to liking someone. As a friend. That was all. Definitely. Fuller had been forced to leave a few days after the accident to file a full report and then get back into the action. Before she had left she had told Gracie to…what was it… \"Give that idiot lovesick boy a chance\" or something to that effect. She had…kind of…not really. \" Then I guess I can't lie to you then. I love you Hart, alright?\" \" Mmm…alright. Eric? I think I love you too…\" That conversation had definitely become a factor, but when she became more coherent they had discussed it and came up with a decision. That they would leave things as they were, for a while at least. Gracie would go back to New York, Eric would stay in Florida, they would phone each other and if it turned out they really couldn't live without each other they would come up with something. Turning back to her scattered piles of paper she pushed her coffee mug to the side and ran a hand through her hair. It stopped at her shoulder and she brought a few strands in front of her face to examine them. It probably needed to be dyed again. She actually liked it black, Victor would be pleased to know, he had said that it suited her personality. And her 'model name,' ugh, Raven…she couldn't believe that she had had to endure that. For some reason she couldn't bring herself to concentrate on her work, hearing that there was a new or old, depending on how you looked at it, employee standing out there made her wonder…maybe Fuller would know. Getting up she limped out the door and looked around, McDonald and the mystery man or woman was gone, but she knew exactly where to find Fuller. \"You missed,\" she said grinning. \"Thanks for pointing out the obvious,\" Fuller snapped. \"So, what's up?\" she put the training gun down and turned to her friend. \"I heard McDonald talking to someone new, well, they used to work here apparently,\" she tried to sound nonchalant but couldn't help a little apprehension enter her voice. Fuller shook her head, \"Sorry, can't tell you anything,\" she picked the gun up again. \"Can't tell me because you don't know anything or can't tell me as in you don't want to?\" Gracie questioned. \"Can't tell you that either.\" \"Oh come on, what are you like in third grade?\" \"No, just don't feel like telling you.\" Gracie groaned in frustration and was more than annoyed by Fuller's smug smirk. \"Fine, I'll just find out myself.\" \"Go for it.\" Looking around Gracie tried to find McDonald to question him, or anyone who might know. Coming around a corner she felt her leg give out as she collided with something, cursing she looked up to find a hand in her face. Taking it she allowed herself to be helped up, only to find herself looking at the mystery man or woman, man as it turned out to be, a man that she knew. It couldn't be him . Oh it so was. \"Eric!\" she was disgusted when it came out as a surprised squeak. Smoothing down her black blouse and skirt she self-consciously flicked her hair back. \"Erm…hi, what are doing here?\" she cleared her throat nervously. Why did he make her feel this way? \"I work here again, transferred back, things just weren't as exciting down there,\" she was glad to see that he too looked nervous. \"Oh, well, glad to see you back,\" she made a move past him but he placed a hand on her arm, gripping her firmly. He looked at her seriously, \"All right, so I moved back for a reason. I tried to forget about you, I really did but I couldn't. So, I decided to come back, I never should have left in the first place.\" Oh God, she was melting, she Gracie Hart was actually melting. In a strictly metaphorical sense, \"I couldn't forget about you either.\" He suddenly hugged her close to him, \"So what do you say Gracie, should we start over,\" he murmured in her ear. \"That depends,\" she sounded slightly muffled as her head was buried in his shoulder. \"And what's that?\" \"You can't leave me again,\" she looked up at him. \"I don't think that would be possible,\" he kissed her fully on the lips and she wrapped her arms around his neck. \"Good.\" \"So you're back with Eric then?\" Vic was doing her hair. \"Yes,\" it had been three months since he had moved back and one since they had started sharing an apartment together. He smiled at her in the mirror, \"I always knew you two were meant for each other…my little girl…growing up,\" he pretended to wipe a tear from his eye. \"Haha, you're so amusing, are you done yet?\" \"Almost.\" Six months later she found herself sitting in front of Vic once again as he piled her hair on top of her head, \"Are you done yet?\" \"No, this is a very delicate process,\" he stuck yet another bobby pin in. \"I think there's more metal now than hair,\" she whined. \"Hush,\" he commanded. When he was done he turned her towards the mirror and held up a smaller one behind her so she could see it. It was beautiful, it was beyond beautiful. \"Wow, you've definitely outdone yourself,\" she couldn't stop smiling and he smiled as well. \"It's your wedding, of course I'm going to outdo myself,\" he kissed the top of her head. She adjusted the straps on her dress and ran her hand over the fitted bodice; she turned around and studied herself in the mirror. It was tight and sleek, flaring out at her feet, the material shimmered softly and diamonds sparkled around the V shaped neckline. \"You look gorgeous Gracie,\" Cheryl came up behind her, \"Wow,\" she hugged her; \"I knew everything would work out for you.\" Fuller came up next to her as well, \"You had to choose pink didn't you,\" she motioned down at the light pink bridesmaid dress with the sweeping skirt. \"You know I chose that specifically for you,\" Gracie said with an evil smirk. \"I know it, your lucky I love you so much,\" she replied dryly. Stretching out luxuriously in the sand Grace rolled over and flung an arm over Eric's bear chest. He fiddled with the black strings on her top and she slapped his hand away, \"We're on a public beach you know.\" \"I know I know, be good,\" he groaned. \"You think I'm gorgeous, you want to kiss me... You want to hug me... You want to love me...\" she started in her sing-song voice; he interrupted her with his mouth on hers. \"Does that count as inappropriate?\" he asked after a while. \"Nope…it is our honeymoon after all.\" \"Is this inappropriate?\" he started to squeeze her sides and she started to laugh until she was wheezing. \"Yes, yes it is!\" she squealed and managed to get out of his grip. Standing up she ran towards the clear water and looked over her shoulder pleased to see he was chasing after her. Hitting the warm water she kept going until he tackled her. Falling into shallow water they laughed and she maneuvered herself until she was on top. \"I love you Eric.\" \"I love you too,\" he began but she cut him off. \"However, tickle me like that ever again and I will be forced to inflict pain upon you.\" \"Even though I'm your husband?\" he asked curiously. \"Even though you're my husband,\" she leaned forward and kissed him feeling his arms slide around her they fell back into the water…or at least they were going to until a little boy appeared staring at them in horrified fascination and his mom had to come and drag them away…giving them a very stern and disgusted look. That was when they decided to take it back to their hotel room…it was their honeymoon after all. I hope it wasn't to confusing, please review and I hope you liked it!

She was hit by a drunk driver\" By this time the speaker wasrncrying aloud, \"Call me. I can give you all the funeral information.\" The can ofrnsoda Grace held in her hand fell to the ground. She made her way over to therncouch and sat down. She held her head in her hands and began to cry. She wouldrnnever admit it, but she had grown to love the girls she had gotten to know inrnthe Miss USA pageant. They had become her friends in a difficult time. When shernwas on her own, they took her under their wings. Now, her best friend had beenrnkilled. She remained transfixed on the couch for several moments. Silent tearsrnfell as she thought of the times she had spent with Cheryl. She slowly rose andrnmade her way to the phone. \"Hello,rnMelanie? Yeah, this is Grace. Thank you for calling. How are you doing?\" \"Ok,\" Therernwas a moment of awkward silence. \"We're getting by.\" \"When did it happenrnexactly?\" \"Wednesdayrnnight, at one Am. She stayed out late for a banquet for drug and alcoholrnprevention.\" \"Isn't thatrnironic?\" \"Yeah, Irnknow.\" Melanie paused. The two thought of Cheryl.

The flight flew by much quicker than Grace had anticipated. Shernwanted to go to the funeral to pay her respects, but she felt by going she wasrnadmitting that her best friend was gone. She did not want to do such a thing.rnThe two arrived at the hotel and walked silently to the main counter. They hadrnmade reservations prior to their flight. Eric had hoped that they would share arnroom, but didn't want to push Grace. He didn't know how she would react so theyrnhad reserved two separate rooms. He knew he should leave her alone for awhile.rnShe was in pain. The nextrnmorning they arose early and began their journey to the church. Cheryl's motherrnhad given her directions. The two remained quiet the whole way there. Grace hadrnso much on her mind. Cheryl and she had become such great friends. She couldn'trnbelieve she was gone. \"We'rernhere,\" Eric announced as he pulled into the church parking lot. \"Huh? Ohrnok,\" Grace had been staring out the window, day dreaming. Her mind had wanderedrnback to the pageant days. She would never willingly tell anyone how much shernhad enjoyed the pageant. She would have rather done anything else. But inrnreality, she ended up having more fun than she could have imagined. She had metrnsome awesome girls and made a new best friend. But now her best friend wasrngone. \"Ready?\" \"Yeah,\"rnGrace opened her door and stepped out. They walked slowly into the church.rnThere was no hurry. Cheryl was still dead. Grace felt that by waiting longer tornsee her body, she was postponing the reality that Cheryl was dead. Eric andrnGrace made their way in and were greeted by familiar faces. Hawaii,rnCalifornia, Oklahoma,rnNebraska, Newrn York, they were all there. \"Grace!\" arnfamiliar voice called out from behind. \"Vick!\" Grace quickly hugged her old friend. \"What are yourndoing here? I mean...\" \"One of therngirls called me and told me what happened. I can't believe it. She was such arnsweet girl.\" \"Yeah, Irnknow. I still can't believe it. Oh, I think its starting.\" The three foundrnseats together and sat down. The pastor approached the podium and began therneulogy. Grace found it hard to concentrate. Her mind kept wandering back to thernpageant days. She hadn't realized how much fun she had had. She hadn't realizedrnjust how close Cheryl and she had become. They went out for dinner every timernCheryl was in town. She was one of the first people Grace would tell excitingrnnews from the station. Tears began to fall down her cheeks. She removed arntissue from her purse and tried to wipe them away. Grace was never a sensitivernperson. She was not used to publicly expressing her emotions. But in the end,rnshe allowed the tears to fall. She could not hold them in. No one could. Shernpeered over at Vick. Tears poured from his eyes. Eric couldn't cold them backrneither. When thernservice ended, many people remained to talk. Grace was approached by a familiarrnface. \"Hey Grace,\" Miss Texasrngreeted Grace. \"How are you doing?\" \"Ok,rnthanks.\" \"So thisrnmust have come as a big shocker, I'm sure.\" \"Yeah, Irncan't believe she's gone.\" \"So havernyou talked to the pageant people yet?\" \"No, whyrnshould I?\" A confused look fell over Grace's face. \"Well, you were runner up.\" Gracernsuddenly understood what she had been talking about.xa0 Grace had almost forgotten.xa0 She had been runner up in the pageant.xa0 \"In any event that the winner cannot fulfillrnher duties as Miss America,rnthe runner up will take her place,\" Grace said to herself.[Chapter 2] Ok, before the next chapter starts a few things.

I love the idea butrndon't have the desire to go on with this fic any longer. I know nothing and Irnmean nothing about Miss USA life so the fic would be greatly lacking.

Thanks for the reviews and enjoyrnthe chapter. Chapter 2 Grace satrnon her couch, staring blankly into space. She could not get her mind off of thernnew revelation Texas had educatedrnher on at the funeral. Why hadn't she thought of it? Why hadn't she realizedrnshe would fill Cheryl's position? Every runner up in the Miss United Statesrnpageant secretly hoped that something would happen to the winner so they couldrnbe crowned. But Grace was not just another Miss United States runner up. Shernwas content with her career. She was content with her life. She had madernlasting friendships and valued the experience she gained through the pageant,rnbut she was not Miss USA. She hadrnnever thought of such a circumstance. Cheryl was crowned Miss USA.rnShe had no reason to ever fantasize about such a circumstance, but now it wasrnreal. There was no possible way to ignore it now. She could not hide fromrnreality. It was staring her dead in the face. What wouldrnthe pageant council think? Would they even truly accept her as Miss USA.rnAnd if they did, was she ready to be Miss United States. Was she capable ofrnbeing Miss United States. Thousands of questions swirled around in her mind.rnShe felt as if her life had just begun. She had gained status at the station.rnHer relationship with Eric was going somewhere. She had devised actual plansrnfor the future. Could she allow something like this to get in the way? Her lifernhadn't been that great in a long time, but now it was. She didn't know if sherncould sacrifice that. But what about Cheryl? What would Cheryl want her to do?rnWhat would Cheryl do herself? The greatest thing Grace took from her pageantrnexperience was her friendship with Cheryl. She didn't want to be Miss UnitedrnStates, but she felt as if she had to do it for Cheryl. Cheryl had taken her inrnwhen none of the other girls would. Grace thought about her first day with thernother girls. A smile began to grow on her face as she recalled the question shernhad asked Miss Hawaii. \"So ifrnaloha means hello and good-bye what do you do when you want to hang up onrnsomeone. Wouldn't you say aloha and they'd start all over again.\" Cheryl wasrnthe only one who laughed. Grace laughed allowed at the memory. Cheryl alwaysrnlaughed at her jokes. Cheryl was always there for her. She had to be there forrnCheryl now. She had to do this for Cheryl; not for anyone else. She was goingrnto do it for Cheryl.

Chapter 1: The Papers Bill Harding's new pickup kicked up dust as he cruised down county road 40 just outside of Ponca City, Oklahoma, the sun bright on his face. It was early in the morning yet and the sky was an innocent blue as Bill leaned past his girlfriend Melissa to get a better view of the sky out the passenger side window. Cloud cover was moderate but non-threatening…cotton-like and lacking noticeable vertical development or clearly defined edges. Bill hardly had to think about it; a moment's observation had his weather sense at attention and the stats rolled through his mind with ease: these were cumulus clouds, lining the sky in clusters and moving along at a nice pace. Textbook example, and common for this time of year. Bill moved his gaze to the horizon. Far off to the west, where even a distant line of trees appeared as a dark, bluish-green smudge, a wall of clouds blocked the sun, throwing the ground below into shadow. It was late May and unseasonably warm. Bill knew that before the end of the day those unassuming, textbook cumulus formations would make the aggressive transition to cumulonimbus clouds: instable, heavy with moisture, and sensitive to the rapid changes in temperature characteristic to spring in Oklahoma. It was tornado season. A moment or two more and Bill found his attention brought back to the cab of his truck as Melissa spoke. \"But, honey, are you sure she's gonna be there?\" she asked again, picking up the conversation where they'd left off when they stopped for fuel twenty minutes ago. Bill allowed himself to reminisce almost automatically, a distant knowledge drifting through his thoughts as he pondered the answer to her question. He glanced at Melissa and tried to smile, though the corners of his eyes were tight with the glare of the sun and an almost inherent disappointment brought on by the memories. \"If I know Jo, she's already dragged her entire department into the field.\" Bill thought of his call to the university this morning, the one he'd halfheartedly hoped would be a direct line to getting ahold of Jo but had, as he'd suspected, been redirected to the department head. The guy, a name Bill vaguely remembered as a transfer from a big, fancy primary university in Kansas, had told Bill in a slightly incredulous tone that Jo and her team and been practically camped out near the Pawnee area for the better part of the last month. He could hear through the phone exactly what this guy thought about the research Jo was doing; the research Bill himself had once been so immersed in. He knew, almost without realizing how, that Jo hated having this guy -some fancy, elitist Atmospheric Science major with some non-nonsense, black and white theory on storm cells- as the head of her department. When he paused to think about just why he knew this, Bill consented that it was because he knew Jo. After all, he'd been married to her for the better part of five years. \"Ah, hell,\" Bill continued, \"A day like today, it's to be expected…She forgets everything except her work.\" Melissa rolled her head against the headrest to face him. \"You're nervous about seeing her, aren't you?\" she asked in her unassuming, pretty southern drawl. That was one thing Bill liked about Melissa. She was to-the-point, but never assuming. Bill figured it must be the therapist in her, but when Melissa asked a question, that's all it was. A question. Not some thinly-veiled comment loaded with implications about what she really felt but wouldn't directly voice. Not like Jo. Bill mentally caged his drifting thoughts and looked to Melissa. \"Nervous? Nah,\" he assured, bringing his attention back to the road before shooting another quick glance in her direction, \"Why? Do I look nervous?\" \"No…\" Melissa was quick to reply, \"Well, yeah. You do, a little.\" Bill let out a terse sigh and shook his head. \"I just want to get it over with.\" Now it was Melissa's turn to feel apprehensive: \"But she said she signed the papers, right?\" \"That's what she said.\" Back in January... Bill's thoughts lingered in his mind, as if he wasn't quite sure they could be counted on. \"You don't think so?\" Melissa turned in her seat to gauge his reaction and Bill smiled, reaching over the console to grasp her hand. \"No, I think so,\" Bill shot her a reassuring smile, \"Give me a kiss.\" The van was blue, and just as junky as Bill remembered it. Back then, it was a pipe dream, the physical manifestation of everything they'd worked for in two seasons of rookie storm chasing. It wasn't much, but it had a roomy inside and space for a mount on its rack. That old piece of shit represented hard work and dedication. Most importantly…it wasn't corporate sellout. Jo had long since replaced it with a slightly newer two door yellow pickup and -when Dusty had joined the team a few years back- an equally junky mini Winnebago, complete with removable camper. In time the team gained new members and eventually lost Bill, but the blue van had stuck around. Go figure. Bill could see now that it had been converted into an impressively large space for mapping data. The storm tracking system was a jumbled mess of computers and wires, and the seats in the back had been ripped out to make room for coordinate layouts and readings from the Doppler radar. On top of the van itself, on the mount, was the dish that provided the readings, and behind that, bent over so that Bill could hardly see her, was Jo. \"Okay Professor, hang on there, I think I've fixed it,\" Tim Lewis -better known as Beltzer- pounded on the roof of the van to get Jo's attention, \"I've got it,\" he called, prompting Jo to turn on the radar. Sparks flew and a burst of smoke puffed angrily into the heavy Oklahoma air, and Jo pulled back. \"Oh, fuck!\" her blond hair swung in a curtain across her shoulder as Jo straightened and cursed the equipment, \"This thing is useless -\" \"Oops! Sorry, Jo-\" Beltzer called dryly. The damn radar dish malfunctioned on a daily basis, and Beltzer was all too used to the frustrations that accompanied it. Melissa hung back, but Bill looked on in amusement as he stepped down from the cab of his truck. The dish whirred to life and Jo snapped her head up to watch incredulously as it begin to search for coordinates. \"Wait wait wait, Beltzer!\" Jo hammered on the roof of the van with the flat of her palm in excitement, \"That's good! Give me a reading!\" \"Okay, Boss Lady, hold your horses…\" Beltzer popped out of the van and strode over to the field equipment, \"Which way do you want it, Jo?\" \"Looks like the dry line is stalled. Give me a sector scan West-Northwest, look at midlevel for rotation and increase the PRF.\" Bill's attention was drawn away from Jo and towards Dusty and the Winnebago. The first pumping tune of Eric Clapton's 'Motherless Child' flowed from the speakers of the 24\" television in the back seat and Dusty sang along, mimicking the beat of the drums: ' If I mistreat you girl, sho' don't mean no harm…' Bill crossed his arms and looked on as Rabbit and Allan argued over protocol for proper map storage. \"All I'm saying is don't fold the maps-\" \"I didn't fold the maps!\" \"Yeah well Kansas is a mess, there's a big crease right through Wichita…\" \" Alright.\" \" Roll the maps.\" Bill grinned at their back and forth and stepped forward to join the banter: \"Well, what do you know? It's the Storm Chasers!\" \"Hey! I don't believe it!\" Rabbit exclaimed, taking note of Bill's presence for the first time, \"Who is that handsome devil!\" Rabbit and Allan laughed and stepped forward to clap Bill on the back and extend their hands in comradely greeting. Dusty, alerted to his presence across the site, crouched down like a linebacker and threw up the 'rock on' sign with both hands. \"The Extreme! It's The Extreme! \" Dusty laughed and bounded over, and Bill grinned. \"Oh man, don't start that shit!\" Bill turned to Melissa, who smiled politely but hesitated near the hood of the truck, and extended a hand to welcome her forward. \"Dusty, I'd like you to meet Melissa. Melissa, this is Dusty. Dust-Man's been chasing with us damn near ever since we started.\" Dusty offered a little sort of half bow and grinned. \"Melissa,\" Dusty extended his own hand and took Melissa's, \"Let me show you around! C'mon…\" he shot a look over his shoulder at Bill as he led Melissa away, \"Man, Jo is gonna wig when she sees he's back!\" \"I'm not back…\" Bill called dryly. He smiled, offered Melissa a reassuring nod, and took off across the short expanse of field towards the blue van and his wife, setting his teeth in preparation for coming face to face with her again. The last time he'd spoken with her -hell, it'd been nearly two months ago now- had been over the phone. She'd called him, out of the blue, and if Bill hadn't taken the opportunity to inquire about the divorce papers she should have signed and turned over to the lawyer by that point, he would have heard in her voice that she was on edge. She had been reluctant to answer his inquiry about the papers and the phone call had degenerated into a petty argument before Bill had even thought to wonder why she'd called in the first place. As in was, that particular incident was far from his mind as he strode across the short grass, nearing the van. He and Jo had decided on divorce nearly eight months ago. The papers had been drawn up in December and Bill had been waiting on her signature for nearly six months. He knew Jo was stubborn; she'd dug her heels in at first and he'd let that drag on awhile…but by the time February rolled around Bill had begun to see Melissa. He couldn't, in good conscience, let this weigh on them any longer. He needed those papers. The sky to the west had darkened considerably on the drive out. Thunder rumbled in the distance; to the east the sun was a bright contrast against the grey wall of clouds that moved steadily closer, seeming to eat up the sky as it came. Bill brought a hand up to shield his eyes as he reached the van and called out. \"Hiya, Jo.\" Bill stood with his hands on his hips and looked on as Jo tensed and her movements stilled behind the Doppler dish. He cast a hesitant glance over his shoulder, suddenly hyper-aware that eight pairs of eyes were gazing in their direction, waiting for the outcome of Bill's arrival. He didn't give a shit -God knows they'd born witness to plenty of his fights with Jo in the past- but did the whole damn team really have nothing better to do than watch him collect his divorce papers? Bill glanced at the sky. \"Storm's coming in,\" he noted, \"She's, uh, she's really talking.\" Jo's features betrayed her shock. Inside, Bill was smug. It was clear she'd never entertained the possibility that he'd come all the way out here where she couldn't avoid him to collect the papers. \"Bill,\" Jo stalled, glancing at the skyline and out across the field at the rest of the team, \"You're back.\" \"I'm not back,\" Bill assured. She looked like a deer caught in the headlights, and Bill felt the slightest twinge of guilt. \"Then, ah, what are you doing here?\" As soon as she spoke, however, Bill forgot all about being sympathetic. \"Christ, Jo! You know why I'm here!\" Bill took another glance at their audience across the field and took a step nearer the van, lowering his voice. \"Look, would you just come down from there? Come down so I can get the papers and get out of your way-\" \"Bill, I-\" \"Just come down, Jo!\" Bill ran a hand through his hair in frustration and looked back over his shoulder again as Jo rose from behind the exposed wiring of the Doppler dish and jumped lightly to the ground. Melissa looked on hesitantly from beside Dusty across the field and Bill shot her an encouraging smile before turning back to face Jo. He thought maybe she'd gained weight. \"So, you want the papers?\" Bill stared. \"You did drive all the way out here for them,\" she reasoned. Her glance darted anywhere but to Bill's own speechless expression as the sky gave another thunderous rumble. The sound seemed to stir Bill from his reverie and he opened his mouth, his tone incredulous: \"You're pregnant ?\"[Chapter 2] Chapter 2: The Past Jo bent to scoop up the coiled wire for the Doppler, brushing past him, and after a moment of numb astonishment Bill kicked his brain into gear and stumbled after her. \"This is the biggest serious of storms in twelve years, one lined up right after another. NSSL says they've never seen anything like it.\" Jo talked as she moved, and the distant crack of lightning resounded across the field as if to punctuate her statement. Bill caught up to her as she neared the Doppler's readout monitor and bent to set up the wiring. \"Jo!\" The distinct tone Bill's voice carried when he was very close to shouting made Jo hesitate and she turned, tucking a piece of hair behind her ear and raising one eyebrow in anticipation. \"Yes, Bill?\" \"You're pregnant!\" Jo paused and gave a maddening shrug before answering, her tone casual: \"It would appear so, yes.\" Bill threw his hands in the air and cast a wild glance across the campsite towards Melissa. It seemed Dusty was doing his best to distract her; his hands stirred the air as he recounted tales of their early storm chasing days. Bill watched as she shot a quick glance in their direction, raising a hand to shield her eyes from the sun. Most of the others were drifting back to their equipment, but Bill could feel their heavy gazes as he turned to Jo. \"I…How?\" Bill demanded, afraid to hear her reply but desperate for answers, \"When?\" Jo straightened. Her gaze swept over Bill and he scowled under the weight of her knowing stare. She seemed to size him up and Bill couldn't shake the notion that she was debating whether he could handle her answer, but finally, she spoke: \"January.\" January… Bill extended a finger and gave the syrup carousel at the head of the table a mindless flick. It spun leisurely on its base, showcasing his options: Blueberry, blackberry, maple, boysenberry. Whatever happened to plain old regular syrup? Bill wondered absently. Outside, the wind stirred the branches of a nearby tree. Bill sat up straighter as a pair of headlights washed over the window and a truck he recognized as Jo's turned off the highway into the crunchy gravel of the parking lot. She parked near the edge of the lot and Bill's gaze followed her movements as she stepped down from her truck. Her blonde hair swung across her shoulder and she absently pushed it back; it caught the wind and stirred before settling against the stiff denim of her jacket. Moments later the bell above the door chimed -accompanied by a rush of cold air- marking her entrance as she stepped inside the tiny diner and immediately scanned the nearest row of worn booths for Bill. Jo's gaze landed on his. Bill couldn't put his finger on it…there was something … genuine…in her expression…he recognized it almost immediately. Bill pondered this, raising a hand in a sort of half-wave as she strode across the nearest row and slid into the booth opposite him. Jo smiled. \" Hi, Bill.\" He knew instantly that his intuition was right...something was up. When Bill had filed for divorce back in September, he had packed his things and relocated across the Kansas border to Wichita. It wasn't far -a little over two hours- but far enough to put some distance between his soon to be ex-wife and what could only be called an obsession with her work. Jo had stayed solemnly behind, in Helena…stubbornly opposed to Bill's reasons for leaving, in deep denial. Nearly three months had passed without any sort of communication between the two. It wasn't until December -when the divorce had officially been drawn up- that Bill was even able to get her to answer the phone, much less convince her to meet him halfway in Blackwell to sign the papers. As it was, Jo had pushed things back twice…so that it was January before Bill was finally able to get her to agree on a time and a place. He had made the seventy mile drive from Wichita to Blackwell in a little over an hour, a sort of dreadful anticipation hanging over him as he imagined just how difficult Jo was going to make this. And here she was, a smile on her face. Bill settled back against his seat and surveyed her carefully. \" You're late.\" \" Yeah,\" Jo, unapologetic as ever, failed to offer an explanation for her tardiness and Bill knew better than to expect one. He studied the cool remains of his coffee as she signaled the waitress and asked for a coffee of her own, waiting patiently through the exchange. When he looked up, he found that Jo had shifted her attention back to him, her gaze steady and searching. Her eyes roamed his face and Bill found himself caught up trying to read her expression before she spoke, her voice soft: \" It's good to see you, Bill.\" Bill hesitated. Hell, the truth was, it was good to see her, too. And the truth scared him. He hadn't expected that, and he definitely hadn't expected her to make this easy. He felt himself frown as he watched Jo smile, thank the waitress for her coffee, and slip a crumpled wad of bills into her hand. Bill spoke the first coherent thought that entered his mind. \" You tip too much.\" Jo had worked a string of waitress jobs throughout college, during the first early years that Bill had known her. After draining whatever living expense-stipend the school provided each semester on chasing tornadoes, she turned to waiting tables to feed her habit; sinking most of her earnings into non-essentials like filling up her gas tank for the next chase. Basic necessities like groceries or paying the electricity bill were treated as nuisances and frequently took a backseat. She might have been good at it; Jo had a charming, down to earth feel about her, and she'd talk to anyone. But the first promising signs of a storm cell had always given her tunnel vision, and Jo had been let go from more than a few jobs for distractedly setting the breakfast platters aside and revving off towards the interstate in her pickup. Most folks found it hard to put up with the kind of crazed intensity that practically radiated off of Jo. In any case, those days had instilled in Jo a sense of reverent appreciation for the hardworking, and though by no means was she without financial burden…she always over-tipped. Irritation flashed briefly across her features as Jo reached for the sugar and spoke: \" It's my money.\" Bill made a sound of disbelief. \" It certainly is.\" \" What's that supposed to mean?\" \" I was agreeing with you…\" \" Really?\" Jo demanded irritably, \"Because that's not what it seemed like.\" \" It's your money,\" Bill insisted scornfully, \"You make the decisions. Isn't that how it goes?\" Jo caught on quickly, her tone accusatory: \" You left me, remember? I came home one day and all your stuff was gone. You didn't even leave a note on the pillow-\" Bill clenched his jaw, frustrated. \" We were going to buy a house, and you took the down payment and spent it on a new Doppler radar!\" \" Because we needed a new Doppler, ours was outmoded, even you said so-\" \" But that money was for our house!\" Jo leaned forward, her features sharp. A moment passed; Bill had expected her to continue firing off accusations…Instead, she sighed. Her features softened and she resignedly leaned back. \" You're right.\" Bill's eyebrows lifted into his hairline. \" Excuse me?\" \" You're right,\" Jo cupped her coffee mug and looked away. \"…It was important.\" \" It was our house, Jo.\" \" I said you're right…\" An awkward silence settled over them. Bill's disbelief made it impossible to speak, and he found his thoughts almost automatically drifting towards the familiar…the way Jo's eyes sparkled with intensity when she felt strongly about something, the clean, slightly sweet scent of her…the pronounced rise of her breasts beneath the neck of her white tee. Jo was pretty, when she gave a damn. But sexy…Jo wouldn't know sexy if it tore a mile-wide path of destruction through her front yard. And yet, something about the self-assured way she carried herself…the way everything she did had a purpose, the bright golden tones in her hair and the natural flush of her skin…it was the last thing on Jo's mind and the first thing on Bill's: Sexy. Damn sexy. Jo's elbows were propped up on the table, giving Bill an unintentional view down the front of her shirt, and he unconsciously leaned forward. This did not escape Jo's attention. Embarrassed, Bill cast his gaze into his coffee mug and reluctantly decided it was about time they got around to business. He cleared his throat: \" So-\" \" Wait…\" Jo cut him off, smiled, then slipped out of the booth and went over to the jukebox by the door. A minute later she was back, and a moment after that Steve Nicks' 'Twisted' crackled through the speakers and drifted across the diner. \" You were saying?\" she prompted. Her voice was light, and Bill hesitated. \" The papers…\" The music was a comfort to him and Bill looked away, finding it hard to face both Jo and his own resolve, \"Do you have them?\" The look of confidence slid off of Jo's face and was replaced by a flicker of defeat, but it was gone almost as quick as it came. Bill wanted to console her, but the familiar returning sparkle in her eye held him off. \" Jo…\" his voice carried a knowing, expectant warning; the intuitive suspicion Bill had felt when Jo had first entered the diner was back, and he knew in an instant that the last fifteen minutes of interaction had been a careful cover. Jo noted Bill's tone and made the quick decision to come clean. \" I didn't bring them.\" \" Excuse me.\" Bill's voice was flat. It was more a statement than a question, and Jo cringed. \" I didn't bring them,\" she said again, warily. \" I drove from Wichita.\" \" I know.\" Bill ran a hand over his tired features, exasperated, and a momentary pause settled over the two of them while he gathered the steam from his forthcoming exclamation: \" What do you mean you didn't bring the papers!\" His outburst startled Jo, though it didn't surprise her. She blinked, and the corners of her mouth pulled upward into a knowing smirk as she allowed Bill's anger to wash over her, seemingly immune. \" Jo, damn it!\" Bill allowed himself to become further worked up by her lack of response, \"Tell me you're kidding-\" \" I didn't bring them.\" \" Damn it, Jo!\" \" This wasn't my decision, Bill. I didn't want this-\" \" That's just it, it's not your decision!\" Bill clenched his fists upon the table in an effort to keep his voice from rising to a yell, \"You don't get to make all the decisions anymore!\" Jo decided it was time to make her case, and she leaned forward, her voiced filled with a firm conviction: \" You didn't even tell me you were leaving!\" \" What's the difference? You never talked to me-\" \" Well Mr. Communication, neither did you. You just hit the road.\" Bill looked away, out the diner window. When he finally spoke, his tone was resigned. \" I got tired of trying to talk to you...\" Jo sat back. The silence pressed over them; their proximity across the booth was simultaneously too close for their tempers and too distant for their sexual tension. She was surprised to discover that this raw attraction still existed -unresolved and seemingly untainted- beneath the heated energy of their aggravation, and wondered briefly if Bill was experiencing the same inner conflict. \" I could have them faxed.\" Bill's frustrated exhaled seemed almost contrived, an encouraging sign, despite his next words: \" You can't fax an official document, you have to have the original, not a copy-\" \" I'm sorry.\" Bill let out a derisive snort. \" You're not sorry -\" Jo shrugged. \" Okay, I'm not.\" Bill made another indignant sound and ran a hand through his hair in disbelief. \" Yeah, that's more like it...\" Jo made a move to rise from the booth and Bill followed her movements with a begrudging gaze. \" Well,\" Jo sighed, \"If that's it…\" \" If what's it?\" Bill demanded. His words hung between them expectantly as Jo paused, halfway out of the booth. \" If that's it…\" Jo repeated exasperatedly, \"I don't have the papers, I can't fax them to you, what else do you want?\" \" I-I-\" Bill's tone grew incredulous and he fired off the first accusation that came to mind, \"Where do you think you're going?\" \" I'm not going anywhere,\" Jo spoke matter-of-factly, rising the rest of the way out of the booth, \"I'm staying.\" \" You're staying…?\" Jo shrugged. \" No sense driving back to Helena tonight,\" she explained, allowing her gaze to signal towards the roadside motel across the street, \"…I'm staying.\" Bill's mouth hung open, a mixture of fury and disbelief muddling his features as he stared indignantly after her. He watched as she reached the door and pressed into it so that the chime above tinkered noisily and then stilled as she paused, a hand on it's edge. Jo turned and cast an expectant look over her shoulder. \"… You coming?\"[Chapter 3] Chapter 3: Awkward Conversations \" January-\" Bill's incredulous tone carried a note of recognition as he recalled the events of nearly five months prior, and Jo raised her brow in amusement. His exclamation was carried away on a cooling breeze and he turned, casting a disbelieving glance across the field in Melissa's direction. \"Oh Christ, oh shit- \" Their night of remiss in Blackwell had come to an abrupt end the morning after, when a petty disagreement over the circumstances had quickly degenerated into a mindless screaming match. Bill had been so worked up that he'd peeled out of the motel parking lot and straight into the oncoming path of a truck and trailer hauling cattle…His blood pressure still crept dangerously high when he thought of what he'd paid in auto damages because of that day. \"Hey Jo, you got a second?\" Laurence -the youngest member on the team- was also the newest, and clearly unaccustomed to how things worked when tempers got heated between Bill and Jo. He waved Jo over, his features apprehensive, and Beltzer -who'd clearly been listening in though he and Haynes both had their heads down- let out a barking laugh as Jo all too eagerly brushed past Bill with a quick, 'Oops, excuse me…' leaving Bill staring, dumbfounded, after her. \"Hi Bill-\" \"Hey Bill!\" Beltzer and Haynes both raised their hands in feeble greeting and smiled politely as Bill turned his gaze upon them, returning a distracted 'Hey' before brushing past and charging after Jo and Laurence. \"Hey this ah, this thing's acting up again,\" Laurence moved his hands as he stuttered apologetically, but Jo -ever on top of things- took one look at the camera and spoke confidently: \"The focus mount's jammed,\" she turned the camera over in her hands and squinted up at Laurence, \"There's grass in the auto-focus. Did you check this? You have to check it…\" \"Want me to clean it out?\" Laurence reached out to take back the camera and Jo passed it to him after blowing out the lens mount. \"Not unless you want to sketch the tornadoes-\" Jo smiled wittily and turned, heading back past Bill to the readout monitor as Laurence called after them: \"Hey, welcome back Bill!\" \"I'm not back!\" \"So, you want the papers?\" Jo's hair stirred in the breeze before settling around her face as she bent to connect another cable to the Doppler's circuit board, and Bill scowled. \"Do I want the papers!\" Bill echoed, his voice incredulous, \"You're pregnant , but now you want to know about the divorce papers!\" \"You did drive all the way out here for them,\" Jo reasoned lightly, her words maddeningly rational given the circumstances. Bill sputtered, and Jo turned to glance up at him in amusement as Bill worked up steam. \"You could have told me!\" he accused indignantly, his voice bursting disbelievingly across the field. \"I tried to tell you,\" Jo's words were matter of fact as she turned back to the monitor and adjusted the coordinates, \"You wanted to talk about divorce.\" Bill threw up his hands in frustration. \"I didn't know things had changed!\" \"Oh, I'm sorry,\" Jo maintained the same reasonable tone as she connected the cables; she didn't even glance at Bill as she spoke, \"I didn't know that this changed things…\" \"It doesn't!\" he burst, backtracking quickly with another frustrated look in Melissa's direction, \"I…you…You're pregnant!\" \"I called you…\" Jo straightened and pressed a hand to her back, her voice matter of fact, \"In March…Ringing any bells? \"You didn't say a damn thing about being pregnant!\" \"Maybe because you didn't let me,\" Jo accused, growing irritated, \"You wanted to argue-\" \"Oh, I wanted to argue?\" Bill echoed incredulously. \"And talk about the divorce -\" \"Because I needed the papers signed, Jo-\" \"Jesus! What's the urgent urgency? You act like you're getting married!\" \"I am.\" The words were out of Bill's mouth before he had time to think. Thunder rumbled resolutely into the silence as Jo paused, seemingly at a loss. Her gaze traveled out across the field before returning to Bill's own, her expression unreadable. \"Wow.\" Bill offered up a stiff smile. \"Yeah.\" Jo turned away and headed for her truck, and Bill fell into dutiful step behind her as they trudged though the high grass. \"Is it Melinda?\" \"Melissa…\" \"Huh. Wasn't there a Melinda in there somewhere?\" Jo cast a querying look over her should as she walked, and Bill grimaced. \"No, there's only been Melissa since you…\" Jo made a sound of disbelief. \"Boy, not much for browsing, are you?\" \"No, I guess I'm not,\" Bill admitted, stopping as they neared Jo's truck and she reached in through the window to pull the passenger side door open. Her hair lifted on the breeze and her gaze was downcast as she pulled a thick stack of papers from inside the glove box and passed them to Bill. \"Here you go.\" Bill took the papers but made no move to go through them. Instead he let his gaze linger on Jo; the weight of his stare forcing her gaze to meet his own as Bill struggled to articulate the things he wanted to say. \"So how are…things?\" Bill motioned awkwardly towards the rise of her belly, and Jo looked down at herself as though she'd only just noticed it was there. \"Right on track…\" Her expression conveyed her disbelief as she spoke, as though she could barely fathom how she'd ended up like this, and she held her hands out to her sides, seemingly unsure of what to do with them. She was anything but maternal, but pregnancy suited Jo. Her body was shapelier now -Bill couldn't help but notice- and the extra weight was graceful rather than awkward. \"You've seen a doctor?\" \"He says I'm at about eighteen weeks.\" Though the squall line to the west was moving steadily across the plains, the sun was still shining high in the sky and Jo squinted up at Bill, raising a hand to shield her eyes. \"Everything looks good.\" A particularly loud clap of thunder gave Jo and Bill both an excuse to look to the sky in mock interest, as an uncomfortable silence settled between them. Bill ran a hand along the back of his neck and risked another glance across the field towards the rest of the team. \"So, uh-\" Bill turned back just in time to catch Jo's focus on the divorce papers in his right hand. She quickly pulled her attention back up to his face, and he stumbled over his words a bit before continuing: \"You're chasing tornadoes?\" Bill spread his hands wide, indicating the mass of equipment scattered throughout the field, \"Your doctor…he knows about this?\" \"What? You think I wouldn't tell him?\" \"Truthfully?\" Bill recognized the defensive tone in Jo's voice. Annoyed, he spoke freely, \"No, I don't.\" \"Well, it's not really any of your business.\" \"So you didn't.\" \"I didn't say that-\" \"You are out of control!\" Bill accused, his voice rising in frustration. He knew how irrational Jo was when it came to tornadoes. They gave her tunnel vision, and the crazed intensity with which she went after them was the biggest contributor to the demise of their marriage. \"Well, I didn't ask you to come-\" Jo threw back defensively. \"We weren't expecting on coming out here at all! You said you'd meet me in-\" \" We? \" Jo cut across, her voice betraying her shock. \"She's here?\" \"Yes she's here, she's over with Dusty-\" \"You left her with Dusty ?\" Jo cringed and lifted her gaze, immediately scanning the row of vehicles for Dusty's mini bus and Melissa, \"What's the matter with you?\" \"What are you doing?\" Bill's demanded warily. Jo shot a quick glance over her shoulder as she turned and began to trek across the field. \"I wanna meet her!\" \"No, you don't…\" Bill remained stationary long enough to deduce that Jo had no intention of heeding his plea. \"Christ!\" He let out a weary curse and took off after her. \"The suck zone…\" Dusty was lounging in his beach chair, obviously enjoying the affect his stories were having on timid-looking Melissa, \"Is the point…basically at which the twister… sucks you up!\" he added hand motions for affect, \"That's not the technical term for it obviously…but-\" \"Hi!\" Jo called out before she had even cleared the last five yards between them. She marched up with her hand outstretched, startling Melissa and she addressed her with forced enthusiasm, \"I'm Jo Harding.\" Melissa fumbled nervously with her bag, jumping up from her own chair to shake Jo's hand. \"Oh, hello! Nice to meet you…\" she tapered off. \"...You're pregnant.\" It was really more a statement than a question, and Melissa blushed at her candor. Her features, however, betrayed her shock as she looked first from Jo and then to Bill, fixing him with a disbelieving stare. \"Well then!\" Jo clapped her hands together with a false smile and shot Bill a tense look as Melissa stumbled over herself in apology. \"Oh-I-I'm sorry-\" \"It's fine,\" Never one for humility, Jo continued: \"It happened before you came along anyways…\" She turned to cast another pointed glance at Bill, a mischievous glint in her eye, and Bill waited for the kicker: \"At least I think...\" \"Christ!\" Bill let out in indignant curse, running a rough hand through his hair and turning to plead with Melissa, \"It was! We hadn't met yet…\" he turned and glowered accusingly at Jo, \"Why do you always have to start trouble ? \" Jo raised her brow innocently and turned back to Melissa with a gracious smile. \"Bill just told me the happy news...\" Melissa struggled to recover, casting an unsure look at Bill. \"Which?\" \"Us!\" Bill's words were pointed as he attempted to reign in the conversation, \"Uh, marriage.\" \"That's happy news!\" Jo conceded politely. Melissa nodded nervously. \"I-I guess it probably seems kinda sudden.\" Jo cringed with false concern. \"It seems sudden?\" \"Dude? You taking the vows?\" Dusty, seemingly unaffected, looked from Bill to Melissa, \"That's sweet!\" \"Well we…we…We just wanted to get it done before Billy started his new job-\" The soft twang of an accent leaked out beneath her words and Melissa ran an anxious hand across her bangs. \"That's right, that's right!\" Jo nodded, \"Right, right, right, right… Weather man-\" \" What ?\" Bill demanded, fixing her with a steely gaze. \"What?\" Jo repeated. She looked unsurely from Melissa to Bill. \"No, say it-\" \"I said weather man, I think it's great!\" \"No, you had that tone-\" \"There was no tone,\" Jo insisted, \"If you have a problem being a weather man-\" Bill laughed mirthlessly. \"You're a pregnant storm chaser! I don't have a problem being a weather man-\" Melissa's cell phone began to ring, providing a welcome relief as she dug it from her purse and answered. \"Dr. Melissa Reeves here…Uh-huh-\" Jo leaned forward and extended her hand once again. \"I just wanted to say hello…\" \"Hello,\" Melissa nodded, smiling distractedly. \"Very nice to meet you.\" \"Uh-huh. You, too…\" she returned doubtfully, her glance following Jo as she turned away. Jo paused as she neared Bill and lowered her voice. Her hair stirred in the wind as she gestured towards her rounded abdomen. \"It's not like I planned this...\" she insisted, her voice resentful. She brushed past him and Bill gazed after her for a moment before turning indignantly to stare open-mouthed at Dusty. \"...Can you believe this?\" Dusty smiled sadly after Jo and chuckled at Bill. \"We're running out of grant money, man…\" he pulled his goggles off his face in an attempt at sincerity, spreading his arms wide to indicate the skies, \"This could be her last chance...\" Bill frowned knowingly. Thunder rumbled in the distance -closer now- and Bill allowed himself to breath in the energy of the building storm before turning again to gaze after Jo.[Chapter 4] Chapter Four: Calm Before the Storm \"New truck?\" Bill trailed after Jo, drawing even with her as she neared his truck and frowned. He could feel Melissa's gaze follow him, but her chatter on the phone was farther off now, and Bill hesitated in an effort to be tactful. \"That's right…\" \"Boy oh boy…New job, new truck, new wife…it's like a whole new you.\" Jo's voice rose an octave as she rounded his truck and turned to survey him. \"Jo-\" \"This is very awkward.\" \"I know. Tell me about it,\" Bill shook his head and rested his hand on his hips, turning to survey the horizon as the sound of thunder rolled closer and seemed to grow in intensity. \"I thought you'd be coming out here alone,\" Jo admitted, rounding to face him. \"I wasn't expecting on coming out here at all-\" \"It's about Dorothy.\" \"Dorothy?\" Bill frowned, his gaze searching Jo's own for answers as she paused, allowing the anticipation to grow. \"What about her?\" \"She's here.\" Her face broke into a smile at Bill's look of awe. \"Show me,\" he demanded incredulously. Bill vaguely registered that Melissa had ended her phone conversation, but found himself marching back past Dusty and his fiancé as Jo led him to her truck and reached up to loosen the canvas that was covering a bulky piece of cargo in the back. Lifting her arms, she let the rope fall into the truck bed and pulled the cover away in one fluid motion, revealing -in all her scientific glory- the most beautiful piece of equipment that Bill could ever have imagined. Dorothy. \"I can't believe you did it…\" Bill took an awed step forward, seemingly drawn towards Jo's truck as his gaze traveled over the instrument, taking it in. \"We built four of them.\" Bill admired the features on the pack: multiple anemometers for measuring wind speed, a satellite honing device attached to the base- its overall construction was nearly identical to Bill's drawings. \"Does she work?\" Jo's enthused smile was truly beautiful as she lowered the tailgate and stepped back -an invitation for Bill to hop into the truck bed to get a closer look- which he did, eagerly. \"Thought you'd want to be here for her first time out,\" Jo squinted up at him, smiling easily now, \"It wouldn't be right if you weren't here.\" \"This is gonna be good!\" Joey and the rest of the team excitedly migrated over to Jo's truck, eager to see Bill's reaction to their surprise. \"How sweet is that?\" Dusty laughed, bringing up the rear and leading Melissa by the hand. \"Bill's concept, man,\" he explained delightedly, directly Melissa's attention to Bill, \"The Extreme, man! That came from his brain!\" \"I had a hand in it,\" Bill acknowledged humbly. \"Wow, it is great,\" Melissa provided politely. She cocked her head and frowned uncertainly, \"What is it?\" \"It's an instrument pack for studying tornadoes,\" Bill explained, \"First one in history.\" \"It's very exciting,\" Jo elaborated, pulling herself up onto the truck bed with an ease that impressed Bill, \"Scientists have been studying tornadoes forever…but still nobody knows how a tornado works. We have no idea what is going on inside because nobody's ever been able to take scientific measurements from inside the funnel,\" Jo looked admiringly towards Dorothy, \"That's what she's gonna do…\" \"How?\" Melissa questioned unsurely. Jo suppressed the urge to cast a disbelieving look in Bill's direction - This woman had nothing in common with Bill- and moved him aside to get closer to Dorothy as she explained. \"We put her up inside a tornado. She opens-\" Jo depressed the release switch and Dorothy's sensor cap swung away, narrowly missing Bill's face, \"-and releases hundreds of these sensors that measure all parts of the tornado simultaneously.\" Bill reached into the tray to get a closer look as Jo passed one of the sensors to Melissa. \"You see Melissa, it's-it's like this-\" Bill provided quickly, catching the look on Jo's face as Melissa glanced casually at the sensor and passed it back to her, \"These sensors go up the funnel, and radio back information about the internal structure: wind velocities, flow asymmetries…We could learn more in thirty seconds than they have in the past thirty years…Get a profile of a tornado for the first time…\" \"And what will that do?\" Melissa inquired. \"If we knew how a tornado really worked, we could design an advanced warning system-\" \"Aren't there already tornado warnings?\" \"They're not good enough,\" Jo cut across, \"They're nowhere near good enough.\" Bill could sense the familiar frenzied intensity building behind Jo's words as she continued: \"Right now, it's three minutes. If we can get this new information we can increase warning time to fifteen minutes-\" \"-Give people a chance to get to safety,\" Bill explained, eager to detour what he knew was quickly becoming a passionate rant, \"At least that's what these guys are trying to do!\" Bill couldn't contain his enthusiasm; it caught on quickly and the rest of the team buoyed his declaration with appreciative claps and cheers. Jo grinned and moved towards the tailgate; Rabbit reached up and easily lifted her down among shouts of delight and excitement. It was a practiced motion- something an overly independent Jo would never have accepted from Bill- and Bill was surprised to experience an unexpected twinge of jealously. The smile slid unceremoniously from his face and he attempted to recover as he propelled himself off the truck bed over the rear wheel. The group moved around him, buzzing excitedly, and Bill found himself pushed nearer to Jo despite his sudden urge to be alone with his thoughts. He gazed up at Dorothy as an excuse to look away from Jo and her excited smile and their baby. \"I can't believe you actually did it.\" \"Well,\" Jo cast an acknowledging glance over her shoulder at the rest of the team, and her eyes shone with pride, \"We did it.\" \"Alright!\" Rabbit clapped his hands as the team looked appreciatively at one another, grinning stupidly. Preacher snapped a photo, and Melissa stepped forward. \"How…How do you get it in the tornado?\" she asked earnestly. \"Well, you gotta get in front of the tornado and put it in the damage path,\" Bill explained, \"And then get out again before it picks you up too…\" \"It's the suck zone,\" Dusty added, leaning close to Melissa's ear. \"Oh...\" Melissa appeared apprehensive, though a sudden exclamation from Haynes drew their attention towards the hood of Jo's truck. \"Excellent!\" Haynes grabbed the portable radio and jogged towards them, and the group parted to allow her access, \"Jo we got major action! NSSL says the cap is breaking- tower's going up thirty miles up the dry line!\" Jo's gaze snapped to Bill and the rest of the team followed suit. Bill knew what she was asking, and he regarded her hesitantly. His unsure glance took her in: khaki chinos, the tan skin of her shoulders against her white tank, beneath which her baby bump rose tellingly. Her belly was small for being nearly four and a half months pregnant, and Bill knew in an instant that though her eyes asked him to come along- she was going after the storm regardless. The silence stretched between them for a long moment as the rest of the team waited for Jo's instruction, and after what seemed like an eternity her disappointed gaze fell away and she decidedly gave the word: \"Alright, let's go!\" Jo secured the tailgate on her truck and the rest of the team sprang into action. \"Alright, we're moving!\" Dusty exclaimed. The group took off in every direction and began quickly packing away gear with practiced skill. \"Joey, Haynes, a little help!\" Beltzer swung himself up onto the roof of the blue van and began dismounting the Doppler as Jo unplugged the cables from its circuit board. Rabbit skipped rolling the maps altogether, scooping them up into a stack and bolting past Allan as he closed the hood on the Winnebago. Dusty folded his beach umbrella and grabbed his chair, tossing them unceremoniously into his minibus as Beltzer egged him on: \"Come on Dusty, you're always last to go!\" \"Let's go, come on!\" \"Come on!\" \"Preacher, follow!\" Haynes called, dumping equipment into the passenger seat of Beltzer's truck as Preacher slid behind the wheel of his own vehicle. \"Lawrence, don't forget the camera!\" Jo called as she jogged past. \"I got it, I got it!\" Lawrence assured excitedly. \"They can handle this, they know what they're doing,\" Bill assured Melissa, casting a wistful glance over his shoulder as the last of the equipment was packed away, \"I mean, well…this is what they do, they live for this…\" \"Dorothy 2 and 3, ready!\" Beltzer called, securing the doors on the blue van. \"Dorothy 4, ready!\" Haynes closed the hatch on the detachable camper and sprinted back across the clearing towards Beltzer's truck. \"Uh-huh,\" Melissa agreed, \"But, she's pregnant…\" \"I know,\" Bill ran a weary hand over his face and sighed. \"I'm sorry.\" \"Are you sure you don't want to go along?\" Melissa squinted up at Bill, and he glanced at her as they walked. \"Nah…Go with them, you mean?\" \"Well yeah…\" \"Ah no, they'll be fine…\" Bill scowled as Jo navigated her truck onto the dirt road beside them, blaring her horn and kicking up mud. \"Did she sign the papers?\" Melissa queried, and Bill frowned, absently patting the pocket of his jacket in search of the document. \"I didn't check-\" \"You didn't?\" \"Well, no…\" Melissa raised a hand to shield her eyes from the sun and slowed; Bill stopped and turned to face her expectantly. \"I think you want to go…\" Melissa surmised, allowing the therapist in her to view the situation rationally, \"I mean, ya'll are gonna have to talk about that baby,\" she nodded in the direction of Jo's retreating truck, \"And what about that-that machine you designed?\" Bill followed Melissa's gaze as the rest of the team pulled out and filed into line behind Jo's truck before turning back to face her. \"You know I never meant for this to happen,\" he spoke earnestly, and Melissa nodded. \"I know...\" A moment passed as Bill struggled to make a decision. \"Okay, come on-\" he said finally, grabbing Melissa's hand and pulling her in the direction of their truck, \"If we hurry we can still catch them!\" Allan's truck swerved past them; the removable camper swayed as Rabbit leaned halfway out the passenger side window and grinned. \"Hey Bill, glad you're back!\" \"I'm not back!\"[Chapter 5] Chapter Five: The First Chase \"Rabbit?\" Jo set her CB radio aside so that she could use both hands to navigate a particularly sharp corner. Holding the wheel steady, she reached back for the microphone as she came out of the turn. \"Yeah boss!\" \"Can we do better than the 30?\" Jo queried. Inside Allan's truck, Rabbit reached behind the seat and grabbed the detailed road map and adjusted his headset. \"No…Not for awhile. It's ah, best to stay on it until we pass Roger's Creek…\" \"Copy that.\" The radio crackled as Jo accelerated up over a rise in the road, and Bill searched for the frequency on the CB in his own truck. \"Once we catch up with them you take the truck and head home,\" Bill cast a reassuring glance at Melissa, \"I'll get everything settled and see you tonight, okay?\" \"No…\" Melissa insisted, \"You know what Honey? I find this kind of interesting, I'm gonna tag along!\" Bill smiled, but his expression quickly turned to one of disgust as he caught sight of the reflection in his mirror. \"Jonas…Son of a bitch!\" The black truck drew even beside them before pulling ahead, and Melissa's gaze followed Bill's. \"Who is that, Honey?\" \"Jonas Miller, he's a Night Crawler…We all started out in the same lab and Jonas went out and got himself some corporate sponsors. He's in it for the money , not the science! He's got a lot of high tech gadgets…but he's got no instincts.\" Bill turned smugly back to face the road, \"And he doesn't have Dorothy…\" \"Jo,\" Beltzer radioed over the network, \"I think we got fleas!\" \"Jo, come back-\" Bill put a call out on his own radio, and Jo leaned over to glance at her side mirror. \"Hey there, you change your mind?\" \"Yeah, what's Jonas doing here?\" Jo watched as one by one the single file line of all-black vehicles passed by her truck, lead by Jonas, and radioed back: \"I'm not sure…But I bet he's asking himself the same question about you!\" Bill glanced at his side mirror and did a double take as he realized that the last in the line of vehicles -a big black van- was bearing down on his driver's side. \"Oh shit, hold on!\" Bill grabbed the wheel and swung right as the driver of the van laid on its horn and bore past them, running them off the road. \"Damn! Son of a bitch!\" The truck bounced onto the grassy bank and up over a pile of culvert poles. They clanged against the undercarriage of the Dodge as Bill struggled to control the bucking wheel axle. He braked -narrowly missing a barbwire fence on his passenger side- and let out another curse as his truck bounced over the last of the metal poles and came to a jarring stop as one of his rear tires blew. Bill pulled the spare from the back hatch of his truck. It bounced as it hit the ground and he guided it across the parking lot to the garage attendant. \"How long do you think that'll take to get fixed?\" \"Oh maybe ten minutes, fifteen tops.\" \"Sounds good…\" Bill glanced at his watch and headed back over to his truck. He brushed the dirt off his shirt and paused, looking up as he heard a familiar, pretentious Southern drawl. \"What if we could predict a tornado's path? How many lives would be spared with the creation of an early warning system! And D.O.T. 3 is the answer! The first Digital, Orthographic, Telemeter…\" Bill followed the sound of Jonas Miller's preaching, drawing even with the grill of his Dodge as he listened unsurely. \"And inside, she holds hundreds of these little sensors…Which when released in the tornado will transmit data back on wind speed, pressure, and due point temperature!\" Bill felt his blood pressure begin to rise as he marched forward, towards the crowd of people and cameras surrounding Jonas and his team. Jo and the rest of the team had a map spread out across the hood of Allan's truck, and Jo glanced up, casting a look over her shoulder as she sensed Bill drawing nearer. She called out a warning: \"Bill-\" \"Why didn't you tell me!\" \"Bill, don't!\" Almost unconsciously, Bill went rushing up to Jonas and cuffed the hat from his head, grabbing him by the collar. \"Hey!\" Jonas let out a startled cry as Bill shoved him up against their device, \"Hey, hey, hey!\" \"You son of a bitch! What'd you think, I wasn't gonna find out about this?\" Jo's team came rushing across the parking lot and into the fray as Jonas' men grabbed at Bill from all sides. \"Hey guys, get this loser off me!\" Dusty and Rabbit pulled on Bill as he surged against shoves from the other team. \"Alright back off! Back off!\" \"What's your malfunction man!\" \"He's not worth it!\" Allan called as Dusty gripped Bill's shoulders and pushed against him, trying to force him away from Jonas. \"What is the matter with you!\" Jonas demanded, taking a cocky step nearer now that Bill had been drawn a few feet backwards. \"You stole my design, you son of a bitch!\" Bill surged forward, slipping out of Dusty's grasp and aiming a wild swing at Jonas, grabbing him again by the collar and forcing him back. \"Come on! Come on!\" Rabbit and Joey pulled Bill back as Jonas' team shouted insults. \"Calm down!\" \"What the hell are you talking about?\" Jonas demanded indignantly. \"Dorothy…You took her, you damn thief!\" A slow smile spread across Jonas' face. \"Oh, I get it…You wanna take credit for my design-\" \"You're a liar! She was our idea and you know it!\" \"Unrealized idea…Unrealized.\" \"That ain't worth shit!\" Bill barreled forward and Jo broke into a run across the blacktop, quickly realizing that another round of pushing and shoving was about to commence. \"Hey-Hey! Guys, guys! Guys!\" Jo drew even with the fray and pushed her way in front of Bill, \"All my guys, get a grip on yourself!\" Her words were directed at Bill now: \"We both know, he'll never get that thing up in the air.\" \"That's right!\" Beltzer called indignantly. Jonas rounded his instrument pack and smiled. \"Well let me enlighten you people…This baby has satellite COM link-\" he depressed the sensor cap and the arms of the telemeter folded back into place, \"We've got onboard pulse Doppler, we got Next-RAD real-time…Today, we're gonna make history! So stick around…'cause the days of sniffing the dirt are over!\" \"Better than what you sniff!\" Allan threw back, and Bill stepped forward. \"We'll see who gets there first…pal!\" Jonas turned from his retreat with the rest of his team. \"Oh, and by the way,\" he called over his shoulder, \"I really enjoy your weather reports,\" his glance darted to Jo's midsection and back to Bill, \"…Daddy.\" Jonas' team burst into loud jeers as a newfound rage overcame Bill. He clenched his jaw and rushed forward, breaking away from the rest of the group. \"You slime! I'm not through with you yet!\" The entirety of Jo's team rushed forward to subdue him, and Jonas continued his retreat. \"Come on, come here! Come on!\" \"Get your hands off of me!\" Bill shrugged his shoulders and pushed away members of their own team, \"Okay!\" He stalked away to cool down, letting out an aggravated yell and aiming a wild kick into thin air. \"He's a corporate kiss butt, man!\" Lawrence called after him. Jo jogged to catch up to Bill as he kept walking, drawing even with him and pulling up short, blocking his path. \"I'm sorry. I should have told you.\" Bill ran a hand across the back of his neck and scowled, annoyed that she could allow Jonas' comment to roll so easily off her back. \"One day,\" he insisted, \"I'll give you one day. Whether she flies or not- I'm gone.\" \"Honey? Honey…is everything okay?\" Melissa was rushing towards them and Jo bowed her head, making a hasty retreat. \"It's okay…Everything's fine, everything's fine-\" \"Are you sure?\" \"Yeah, yeah, yeah,\" Bill grasped Melissa's hands in his own, \"Everything's okay.\" \"Okay.\" \"Listen, I'm gonna hang out here and get some air. Why don't you…Why don't you go get us some cold drinks?\" \"Okay Sweetheart.\" \"Okay...\" Jonas ambushed Jo as soon as she stepped into the diner. \"You know Jo, I don't know what the matter is with Bill- I mean he-he's…he's wacko! He's crazy! I mean you otta keep a leash on him!\" Jo glared at Jonas, nodding in mock sympathy. \"He's not my problem. He's yours-\" Jonas moved to cut Jo off as she tried to brush past him and she pulled up short. \"Oh, by the way. This storms gonna be a lot bigger than we anticipated-\" Jonas cast a glance out the window towards Bill, \"I got reports of mesos from Grand County all the way to Logan-\" \"You're sharing information with me?\" \"No, it's just ah…I'm curious as to which way you're gonna head.\" Jo nodded eagerly, catching on. \"Southeast, I think. To the counter.\" She brushed Jonas off and cast a disbelieving glance in the direction of his team as she drew even with the counter and Melissa. \"Nothing changes…\" she muttered. \"Pardon me?\" Melissa straightened and turned in her direction, and Jo hesitated. \"He's gonna wait and see what Bill does,\" she provided, incling her head towards Jonas. \"That man is waiting for Billy, why?\" \"My Aunt Meg used to call him a human barometer,\" Jo provided, by way of explanation. \"So you're telling me that Billy knows what a storm is thinking ?\" Melissa echoed disbelievingly. \"Something like that. Gum?\" Melissa shook her head and sat up straighter. \"Well he hasn't really told me about…all this.\" And awkward silence settled between them, and Jo opened her mouth to fill the void: \"If you have to pee, you should do it now, 'cause there's not very many places to stop once we get on the road.\" Melissa was silent. After a moment, she spoke: \"You're still in love with him, aren't you?\" Jo raised her brow and looked to Melissa disbelievingly. \"Not that I blame you…I just hope that this isn't some desperate attempt to keep him in your life.\" Jo chewed her gum, contemplating the other woman's words before reaching over and plucking Melissa's tab off the counter. \"We're together,\" she told the waitress, placing both tickets and a wad of crumpled bills onto the counter. Grabbing her Styrofoam cup, she shot Melissa a friendly smile before turning from the counter and making an uncomfortable exit. Bill stood at the edge of the parking lot and surveyed the clouds. The sky had darkened considerably; it's edges were tinged a nasty green color. Thunder reverberated off the hills, and before his eyes the light steadily transitioned from grey to orange to a heavy, ominous green, until soon the whole sky was tinted with the color. The crunch of gravel signaled Dusty's presence as he walked up behind Bill and stilled, his hands deep in his pockets. \"Hey man. What's up?\" \"Goin green,\" Bill provided, picking up another handful of dirt and gravel and holding it open to the wind. \"Greenich,\" Dusty provided appreciatively, and Bill turned to head back towards the diner. \"Saddle 'em up…\" \"You got it boss.\" Dusty eagerly headed back to the others and Bill strode to his truck, grabbing his jacket from the front seat and shrugging it onto his shoulders. Melissa was approaching, drinks in hand. \"Honey, I got you a lemonade-\" \"We gotta move out-\" Bill cut across fervently, \"Listen, follow us in the truck but stay behind Dusty's van, you'll be safe back there. I gotta go with Jo!\" Bill spun on his heel and sprinted towards Jo's truck, rallying the others as they exited the diner in ones and twos and prepared to depart. \"Okay let's move out people! Let's go!\" \"Where are we goin?\" Melissa called unsurely. Dusty hit the flashing lights on his bus and peeled past her, and Melissa fumbled for her keys, shoving the drinks onto the roof of the truck before pulling the door open and sliding into the drivers seat. Jo gripped her key strap between her teeth as she pulled on her own jacket. \"Thanks, I'll drive!\" Bill rushed past, plucking the keys away from her, and slid behing the wheel of her truck. Jo did a double take as she realized what had happened; she glared at Bill and hustled around the front the vehicle, pulling the passenger door open and sliding in beside him. One by one they peeled out, and Dusty's roof-mounted speaker crackled to life and began blaring Van Halen across the darkened plains as they hit the highway, gathering speed.

T"},{"Movie":"Olympus Has Fallen","Title":"The Soldier of War and the Daughter of Peace","Author":"It's-A-Passion","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9757316","Passage":"[Chapter 1] The Soldier of War and the Daughter of Peace Chapter One Admittedly, the first time Nora Asher saw him, she was a bit suspicious. He'd been waiting to go into her first literary classics lecture. He stood out to her because he was by himself, his arms folded as he leant against the wall, a baseball cap pulled down over his short-ish brown hair and a nonchalant expression. He looked to be about twenty five or twenty six, and judging from the breadth of his shoulders, and his well-muscled physique, she'd guessed he was majoring in some sort of sport or health and fitness program. She wasn't even sure why that drew her attention, but it did. And how could she not be suspicious, when he moved like he saw everything around him, like he was on high alert, and his eyes trained on her in a more than an 'I'm checking you out' way. When he glanced at his watch constantly, and seemed to survey everything that happened with a degree of detachment. Nora knew how to spot the signs of a secret service agent; she'd been around them for a large part of her life. As the first month of college went by, her conversations with her parents got stonier and stonier on her side, sure as she was that her dad had assigned another security personnel to tail her. Without having even the courtesy to tell her. All Nora wanted was normal. It didn't seem like such a difficult thing to achieve, to most people. But for the daughter of the president, normal was…out of the question. Not only was it out of the question, it was unattainable. Completely. But that didn't stop Nora from trying. It was why she was at the pool party, despite being self-conscious because of all the eyes on her and her unusually well-exposed body. Everybody wanted to know the president's daughter, wanted to be friends with her, know her secrets, but most importantly, they wanted the spotlight that followed her around whether she wanted it to or not. And the ones who didn't, wanted to get to her dad through her. The music thumped loudly, the beat reverberating down Nora's body, the sun heating her skin. The air was thick with laughter and yelling and girls screaming as the boys threw them in the pool. Amy nudged Nora to get her attention, then nodded in the general area of a couple guys she deemed hot. \"Check out the hot guys over there.\" Amy was five feet and nine inches of slender beauty, with natural honey blonde hair that was dead straight, her skin a deep caramel tan, and her eyes a brilliant blue. The green of her strapless bikini went well with the shade of her hair. Nora, by contrast, was petite and curvy, standing at five feet and two inches, with curly black hair, ivory skin and brown eyes, like her mother's. She was regretting the outlandish red ruffle bikini she had on, wishing she had bought with her the oversized sweatshirt she felt most comfortable in. The president's daughter was very rarely seen in anything that didn't cover her upper arms, stomach and legs, so while Amy flaunted her natural perfection, Nora just felt odd and out of place. She was used to people watching, but most of the time, she had more clothing on. From the moment they'd met when they first moved in as roommates, they'd hit it off well; Amy came from a big family, so she didn't seem bothered by the fact that in Nora's world, there was no such thing as privacy, and they were never really alone. There was always someone. The security detail assigned to Nora, standing guard at their door, roaming the corridors for threats, following her everywhere. The press, always trying to get a shot of the president's precious daughter doing something wrong. The people trying to get close to Nora, to know her. Nora was never really alone. She wished she knew what it felt like to have just a few moments to herself, without anyone knowing who she was, or who her father was. She'd like to walk down the street and not be bombarded by people wanting to talk to her, shake her hand, photograph her, hug her. She was eighteen years old, and was just thankful she'd finally made a proper friend in Amy. Nora shrugged her shoulders, distracted. \"Yeah.\" Amy rolled her eyes, and nudged her again, \"What's up?\" \"Nothing,\" Nora shook her head, playing at indifference. She didn't want to be a downer when Amy was obviously looking to have some fun. She crossed her arms defensively in front of her, drawing Amy's attention. \"You look hot. Stop fidgeting,\" she admonished, slapping Nora's hands away from adjusting her bikini bottoms. \"That's easy for you to say,\" Nora complained, her face twisting into a grimace. \"I'm not usually so… underdressed in public. When my dad sees the pictures, he won't be thrilled.\" Because there would be pictures in the paper the next day. She couldn't see any camera flashes now, but the day was still early. Amy placed her hands on her hips in a move Nora had come to know meant business, \" When are you going to live a little? You're not a little girl anymore, stop worrying what your daddy will think, and start doing what you want. There's nothing wrong with swimwear, and there's nothing wrong with flaunting your God-given body, so just have fun. There's nothing wrong with an eighteen year old girl having fun.\" Nora frowned. \"You're right.\" \"Of course I am,\" Amy sing-songed, grinning widely. \"I can have fun.\" \"Yes you can,\" she nodded encouragingly. \"This would be the perfect time to have fun.\" \"Precisely!\" \"Maybe I should call my dad and give him a heads up,\" Nora added musingly, and Amy groaned, slapping a hand across her forehead. \"And you were doing so great,\" she muttered. She placed her hands on Nora's shoulders, looking her in the eye, \"Listen to me closely. You will have fun. You will swim. You will laugh. You will flirt. And God-be-willing, you will like it. Understand?\" Nora mock saluted her, \"Yes, sir!\" \"That's more like it!\" She spun Nora around, and shoved her at the closest guy, \"And here's your chance.\" Nora stumbled into him from the force of Amy's shove, apologizing. \"It's alright,\" the guy said, offering her his hand. \"I'm Will.\" \"Nora,\" she replied, taking his outstretched hand and shaking it. \"I know. I think everybody knows,\" he grinned. \"Guess I should have seen that coming, huh?\" Will shrugged, the front of his wavy, shaggy blonde-brown hair falling across his face and into his blue eyes. \"Yeah, considering you're in the public eye,\" he laughed, his eyes quickly slipping down her body for a millisecond, before coming back to meet her eyes. \"So, what are you majoring in?\" Nora raised an eyebrow, \"You don't know?\" \"I do. Double major in political science and history. I was just being polite,\" he grinned easily. Nora, oddly, wanted to do what her dad did. She wanted to make a difference, she wanted to serve the people, she wanted to better the world. She wanted to orchestrate peace. As much as she hated constantly being watched and judged, her time always being demanded for some party, some fund raiser, some gala, that she never got time for herself. As much as she despised the lack of privacy, and the fact that her security detail had to know private things about her all the time. She wanted to make a difference more. \"Well, seeing as you know everything about me, why don't we talk about you?\" Nora proposed. She certainly didn't want to bore him by telling him stuff he already knew about her. She was pretty sure that that was not Amy's idea of fun. He nodded, \"Well, I have an older brother and a younger brother and sister. My oldest brother is…\" Nora tried to pay attention. She really did. But for some reason, her eyes kept wanting to drift to his left, wanting to look past Will when she really should be paying attention to him. For ten minutes, she nodded like she was listening, smiling and adding in a few 'hmms' and 'yeahs?', but instead, her mind was trying to stop her from looking over to his left to see what had caught her attention. And then she couldn't stand it anymore. She looked as subtly as she could, before bringing her gaze back to Will. It was him . The guy who she believed was secret service, sent by her dad to watch her without her knowing. He wasn't doing a good job; she'd pegged him from the get-go. He stood beside two other guys, who were chatting easily, every now and then turning to him and asking his opinion. His dark blue singlet fit him perfectly, displaying the muscles of his arms and the lean length of his torso. His eyes seemed to systematically scan the crowd, but it was so very subtle. His eyes landed on her, and for a second, surprise flitted across his features as he took her in, bikini and all. But then it disappeared less than half a second later, and his face was relaxed again. And suddenly, she was angry and irritated. At her dad and him . She could look after herself. She'd been here a whole month and no one had attacked her, no one had threatened her life. It was almost like she was normal, except for the three man entourage that followed her every movement, who carried at least two guns each and were trained to take down an attacker. Nora was certain her parents were completely overreacting at the level of danger involved. She had enough men to protect her here, she didn't need anymore. But if her parents were going to assign someone else to her, she had a right to know about it. That was what made her the maddest – that they hadn't told her. Why wouldn't they have told her? She threw a glare at him, her jaw tensing. Will cleared his throat, \"I'm boring you, aren't I?\" Nora jumped, almost having forgotten he was there in the first place. \"No,\" she said quickly, looking up at him, removing the glare from her face. \"No. I'm just…incredibly thirsty.\" \"Would you like me to get you something, then?\" He offered eagerly. Nora smiled at him, \"That would be lovely.\" He quickly headed off to get her a drink, and she turned around, searching for Amy. She was in the pool, splashing with some other people Nora didn't know, and she headed over to her, standing next to the edge. Amy looked up at her, \"Nora, this is Emma and Delaney.\" They grinned and waved, and Nora waved back, \"Hi. It's nice to meet you.\" \"And you,\" Delaney said, while Emma splashed water in her face, cutting her off abruptly and making her splutter. \"Gotcha!\" Emma yelled jovially. Nora smiled, and she looked behind her, not sure if she was looking for Will or for him . Regardless of which one she was looking for, he shoved her as he walked past, not stopping and not apologizing as Nora fell into the pool. Cool, deliciously refreshing water swallowed her, and she surfaced, looking after him in outrage. He'd just pushed her! And it was on purpose, because there was plenty of room for him to have walked past without even touching her. \"Are you okay?\" Amy asked, concern tinting her voice, as she came closer to Nora. \"Yeah,\" she replied absentmindedly. She wiped at the chlorine in her eyes, indignantly pulling herself out of the pool and taking off after him. \"Hey!\" She called, hurrying to catch him. He didn't slow down, though she was sure he knew she was chasing him. \" Hey! \" She grabbed his arm, pulling him around to face her. \"What?\" He asked, though he didn't look at all quizzical, like most people would if someone chased them. He almost looked expectant. She frowned at him angrily, \"That was rude!\" He raised an eyebrow, \"What was?\" \"Really?\" She snapped. \"You're really going to pretend you don't know what you just did. On purpose .\" \"I don't know what you're talking about.\" He shrugged indifferently, turning to walk away. Nora was in shock. Flabbergasted. Her surprise and confusion gave him the chance to slip further away, and she pulled herself together, catching up to him again. He sighed, like she was bugging him when she pulled him around again. \"Are you going to do this the whole way back to my dorm?\" She just gaped at him. She honestly hadn't met anyone like him before. No one spoke like that to her. No one was rude like that. And he had to know who she was, and yet he was doing it anyway. If people were mean or rude to her, it usually had to do with her dad's campaign, or judging her hair and clothes the way people did to everyone in the spotlight. She didn't know why this guy didn't like her. She'd never met him before. When she just continued to gape at him, unable to say anything, he raised his eyebrows in a fake interested way. \"Well, this has been… I'd say interesting, but it really hasn't been.\" \"Who are you?\" She questioned, shaking her head. Her shock was wearing off, and in its place was confusion. \"Mike.\" Her jaw clenched, \"Well, Mike, are you always such a jerk ?\" He pretended to think about it. \"Yeah.\" \"So it's not just me then?\" \"Oh no, it's definitely you.\" He grinned widely before turning around and walking off. This time, she didn't follow him. It was the first time she'd seen him grin. Agent Todd was beside her the next second. His voice was carefully blank, \"Do you want me to bring him back? Or follow him?\" \"That won't be necessary, thank you Agent.\" She couldn't tear her confused eyes off Mike as he walked away, not looking back. Agent Todd nodded, retreating back from the party to where he hung in the perimeter with Agents Jackson and Tyler. Nora had been certain he was secret service. But then he'd pushed her into the pool. She made up her mind then that Mike couldn't be a part of her father's secret service. No one sent to protect her by her dad would have been so rude. And there began her dislike of Mike. She had done absolutely nothing to him, and he had taken a dislike to her. Nora knew it wasn't right, but she felt the only way to counter that was to dislike him just as much. It was hardly diplomatic of her, but she thought she was entitled to it. He had been a jerk. But damnit, he was a jerk with a nice smile. So, what did you think?

Thanks so much for reading![Chapter 2] The Soldier of War and the Daughter of Peace Chapter Two Nora just couldn't believe it. She'd never met someone so rude. She shook her head and turned around, walking back over to the pool where Amy was waiting, \"Well? What happened?\" Nora frowned, \"He walked off.\" Amy pulled herself out of the pool, wrapping an arm around Nora, \"Don't let him get to you. He's a jerk.\" A small smile lifted Nora's lips, \"That's what I called him.\" \"A jerk?\" Amy asked, a disbelieving grin stretching wide across her face. \"No way. Ha! Why do I always miss seeing the mean Nora?\" Nora shook her head, \"I don't know. But I think I'm going to go back to our dorm. I'm not in the partying mood.\" Normally, Amy would protest. She would complain and coax Nora into staying, and Nora would normally give in. After all, it was Nora's plight for normal that made Amy try to convince her to stay in the first place. But this time, she made no arguments. \"Did you want me to come with?\" Nora shook her head again, \"No, you stay. Have fun for me.\" \"Are you sure?\" \"Positive.\" \"Okay… then that I can do.\" Nora grinned, grabbed her bag and pulled on the singlet and shorts she had on when they arrived. She waved to Amy as she slipped back in the pool with Emma and Delany, heading out. She walked slowly along the pavement, frowning and thinking. She didn't have to turn around to see Agents Jackson and Tyler walking side by side at a respectable distance behind her. Agent Todd walked in front of her, leading the way. Nora watched her feet, suddenly feeling lonely. Those agents were like a barrier between her and the world, and not many people were willing to break through. Nora sighed. Her college experience wasn't turning out the way she'd hoped. No quiet goodbye, no quick exit, no private anything. The whole damn United States of America knew she was starting at college. It was stupid of her to think anything else would happen, though. Nora's flip flops slapped against the linoleum covered stairs as she walked the three flights to hers and Amy's dorm room. Agent Todd walked in first, sweeping the room quickly with his eyes before stepping aside and letting Nora inside. He closed the door as he stepped back outside the door where he would stand until either Nora left to go somewhere else, or when his shift ended. Nora flopped down on her bed. Their shared room was fairly big. Spacious. It was a square room, with single beds on opposite sides of the room, a bedside table each, and a desk and chair each. Amy had only just finished decorating her side of the room. On the wall her bed was pressed against were little hooks, spaced unevenly about, where all her bags hung from. Amy loved bags; the one time Nora and her had gone shopping, Amy came back with three more handbags to add to her already huge collection. There was a sale, and it seemed Amy couldn't just walk past a bag sale. Papers and unopened textbooks covered her desk, her laptop lay on the pink and yellow sheets of her bed, and every now and then there was a pile of clothing haphazardly on the ground. Over Nora's bed stood a book case, holding her by now well-read texts books, some with sticky notes hanging out the side, her books for her literary classics lecture, including works by Jonathan Swift, Jane Austen, William Shakespeare and James Joyce, and some of her novels she bought from home. Her desk was clutter-free, her laptop sitting in the middle of the wooden surface. Sketches hung on the wall in front of her desk, some of the places she'd been and landmarks she'd liked enough to draw, or landmarks she'd like to see; the Eiffel tower, St. Paul Cathedral, St. Basil's Cathedral, Big Ben, Buckingham Palace, Notre Dame, Neuschwanstein, the acropolis of Greece, the Taj Mahal, the Colosseum, the Great Buddha. Shirts and jeans were draped over her chair, and some were covering the red and ivory bed sheets. Nora stared at the ceiling. She kind of regretted leaving the party now. At least, when she was at the party, there wasn't really an opportunity to be by herself, with only her thoughts. Which was all she had right now. It was ridiculous to let one guy get to her. There were always going to be people who didn't like her. She couldn't win them all over. She knew that. She just hated that she didn't know what she'd done to make him dislike her. She sighed, sitting up, and walking over to her desk. She decided to make a start on that essay for her ancient Greek course. She switched on the radio, and got to work. ... She worked until late afternoon. She didn't realize so much time had passed until Amy came barging into the room, a smile still on her face. Nora glanced up at her, then at the window where the sun was setting, surprising her. \"Please, tell me you haven't been studying this whole time.\" \"Okay, I won't.\" Amy groaned as she sunk down onto her bed, kicking off her shoes. \"You shouldn't have left the party. We had so much fun; there was a barbeque, and we played volleyball and you should've been there. Will was wondering where you went.\" \"Oh my gosh! I completely forgot about Will! Oh! I feel terrible! What did you tell him?\" Nora grimaced, feeling bad for just leaving him there, without even an explanation as to where she went or why. \"I just said you weren't feeling well, so you went back to our dorm,\" Amy shrugged, \"Which, was partially true.\" Nora nodded, \"Thanks for that.\" \"No problem.\" She pulled a piece of paper out of her bag, handing it to Nora, \"He said to ask you to give him a call.\" Nora's jaw almost dropped to the floor. \"You're serious?\" She unfolded the paper and looked at the digits there. \"Dead serious,\" she wiggled her eyebrows, grinning hugely. \"You can thank me at your wedding for shoving you at him.\" Nora rolled her eyes, \"It's not like you specifically chose him. He just happened to be standing there.\" \"Yes, I did,\" she replied, frowning at Nora like she was offending her. Nora couldn't believe Will had given her his phone number. She hadn't really been on dates, and as far as Nora could tell, dating a girl who had a father who could, literally, order a background check on him, was a big turn off. So, Nora had limited experience with these sorts of things. \"I can't believe he wants me to call him.\" At least she didn't offend him after all. \"And that's hard to believe because…?\" Nora looked at her, \"I don't know if you've noticed, but guys aren't exactly lining up to date the daughter of the president.\" \"You know, I don't get why not – it's not like you're ugly,\" she said flippantly, pulling off her sopping wet shirt and pulling on a dry one. She left the wet one in a pile on the floor. \"Thanks,\" Nora said sarcastically, her eyes on the shirt. \"Are you just going to leave that there?\" Amy grinned, rolling her eyes, before saying in a knowing way, \"Why? Does it bother you?\" Nora folded her arms defiantly, \"No.\" Amy laughed, \"Yes it does. Don't worry; I'll move it in a second. Now, how about dinner?\" \"That sounds so good. I'm starved.\" ... \"What do I say?\" Amy snorted, then sobered up at the look on Nora's face. \"You're serious.\" \"Dead serious.\" \"Oh,\" she frowned. \"Okay then. Dial the number, and when he picks up the phone, tell him who you are, and that I said he wanted you to call him. So you're doing that.\" \"That's it?\" \"Yep,\" she scrounged around in her bag, pulling out some gum and popping it in her mouth. She offered some to Nora, who shook her head. \"The conversation will go from there.\" \"You're sure.\" \"Positive.\" \"Alright,\" her voice was not at all certain. The waitress dropped off their coffees at their table. Well, technically, Nora's wasn't a coffee. It was a double caramel hot chocolate; she didn't like coffee, but she had a major sweet tooth. They had enough time before their lecture to just talk a little, so they'd decided to stop to get a drink, and Amy had convinced her now was as good a time as any to call Will. Nora pulled out her phone, biting her lip. Glancing at the scribbled number on the creased paper, she dialed. It rang twice before he picked up. \"Hello?\" For a second, Nora froze, panicking a little. She completely spaced on everything Amy just told her, and now she was sure he thought she was an idiot. But then she regained her composure, \"Yeah, hi. This is Nora. Amy said you wanted me to call, so that's what I'm doing.\" Amy snickered a little when she repeated exactly what she'd said to say. Nora kicked her under the table, glaring at her and mouthing for her to pipe down . \"Oh, Nora!\" He sounded surprised. \"I'm glad you called.\" \"You are?\" She couldn't stop it from slipping out. He laughed, \"Of course.\" On the other end of the line, it sounded like he was shifting around, moving papers and books. \"Is this a bad time?\" \"No. No, just…kind of early.\" Nora glanced at her watch. 9:13.\"Oh, I'm so sorry! I'll call back later!\" \"No! Now is good.\" \"Are you sure?\" Nora glanced up to find Amy's unwavering gaze on her, half-expectant, half-amused. It was off putting, and Nora flapped her hands at her to make her look away. She didn't. \"Yeah. Sure.\" \"Okay… well, Amy said you wanted me to call…?\" She repeated. And now it was awkward. She cringed. \"Yeah, uh…\" Oh, god. What if Amy was having a go? What if he was kidding, and he didn't really want her to call, but only wanted to see if she would? That was so embarrassing. \"I was wondering if you'd like to go out sometime?\" Nora didn't say anything, just stared at the lid of her hot drink. Really, it was too hot to have gotten a hot drink. She should have gone for something cooler. Like an iced chocolate. Or a smoothie. The back of her neck felt warm, and she wished she'd brought a hair tie to pull it up with. \"Hello? Nora? You still there?\" \"Yes! Sorry, what did you say?\" She had heard him, but she needed more time to compose an answer. What was wrong with her? Here was a nice guy talking to her, asking her out, and she was thinking about mundane things. That wasn't normal. She should be a nervous wreck, she should be giddy with excitement, hanging off his every word so she could relay it back to Amy and they could spend the next however long analyzing it. But she wasn't. He was nice, sure. He'd been polite to her. And he was cute, with his shaggy hair that reminded her of the ocean. But, she realized, he didn't interest her. She didn't find him interesting. In the slightest. Right now was a good example; when he was talking, she'd allowed herself to be distracted. And his asking her out hadn't thrilled her the way she thought it should. It didn't make her nervous, mentally flipping through outfits she could wear to look her best. Yesterday, when he was talking, she'd been easily distracted as well. By him . Mike. The jerk. The jerk with the outrageously hot body and gorgeous smile. The jerk with the smile that made the corners of his eyes crinkle up. The guy who'd pushed her in the pool and then walked off like he hadn't. He, heaven forbid, interested her. Against her better judgment, for she knew he couldn't be any good to have an interest in. The past however many hours since the pool party, he was all she could think about. She couldn't understand what his problem with her was, and it was driving her crazy. She had to know. She couldn't stop thinking about it. For Christ's sake, he'd been an ass to her, and she'd still spent more time thinking about him than she had about Will, who had been nothing but nice to her. Nice and…boring. \"I asked if maybe you'd like to go out with me. On a date,\" he added, clarifying. Nora bit her lip. \"Yeah. Sure. That'd be nice.\" She may as well. What did she have to lose? Nothing. And she may even find she does think he's interesting. It wouldn't hurt to give it a try. \"You mean it?\" His voice was eager, and a twinge of guilt twisted at her heart. She thought maybe he liked her more than she liked him. She really hoped this date would change that. \"Yes,\" she said firmly. Yes. She did mean it, and she intended to give Will her full attention this time. Maybe if she did, she'd find he was more interesting than she realized. Away from possible distractions, he at least deserved her undivided attention. \"Great! How about I pick you up Friday night? Seven-ish?\" \"Sounds perfect.\" \"Okay. See you then.\" \"Okay.\" She hung up. It was Monday. She had four days to psyche herself up for it. And to adopt a much more positive attitude about it. She needed it, clearly. It wasn't fair of her to have to psyche herself up to see him. It should just happen; she'd agreed to a date, so now she was going on one. And really, what else did she think he wanted her to call him for? To exchange fried rice recipes? She didn't think so. She didn't have to call him, but she had. Because she wanted normal. She wanted to go on a date, she wanted to fall in love with a guy. She wished that guy would be Will. She really did. So what did you think? Should I still continue it, or not? Thanks so much for reading! I've started doing review replies, so they'll be at the end of each new chapter. NGArmyWife: Hi! Thanks so much for being my first reviewer for this story! I'm so stoked you're interested in reading more of this story! Thank you! Haha, I love Gerard Butler too (and consequently, this movie :D), but admittedly, I hadn't seen him in anything before this movie, so I can't say I've been a long-standing fan, unfortunately! I really hope you enjoyed this chapter, and are still interested in reading more! Thanks again! Mascota: Hi! Thanks so much for taking the time to review this for me! It means a lot to me, so thanks! Thank you, I'm glad you think this story had a good start! I was a bit unsure about it, so I'm ecstatic you'd like to know more about Mike and Nora, and Mike's relationship with the president! I hope you enjoyed this second chapter! :D[Chapter 3] The Soldier of War and the Daughter of Peace Chapter Three Even after a month at the university, Nora's lectures were still filled with whispers and chattering centered on her. Honestly, she thought they would've grown bored by now. She was even bored by it. Nora was never one of those scandalous limelighters, so she really thought they would've run out of things to say about her by now. \"So?\" Amy asked as they sat down, about halfway to the back of the lecture. Agent Todd sat two seats over from her, Agent Jackson two across from Amy, and Agent Tyler stood at the door. Nora decided to speak to her dad about decreasing their orders to stick to her like glue. Them sitting like that blocked anyone else from sitting next to her, stopped her from making friends in her other lectures. Her literary classics lecture was the only one she shared with Amy, who was majoring in drama. So in every other lecture she had, she sat by herself. \"So… we're going out Friday at seven.\" \"That's great!\" She grinned, clearly excited for Nora. \"Yeah.\" She also heard the lack of enthusiasm in Nora's voice. \"Okay. What is it?\" \"Nothing.\" Amy just looked at her. \"He's nice. He is. It's just… he's kind of boring.\" \"Then why'd you agree to go out with him?\" She frowned. Nora frowned as well, not understanding Amy. \"You don't think he deserved a chance?\" \"You think he's going to get any less boring with time?\" Nora's eyebrows shot up, \"I… Yes.\" \"Look,\" Amy sighed. \"I'm a big believer in first connections. If I can't establish a connection with a guy, or at least find him interesting enough to try to, at the first meeting, then there's no point in going out. There's no point wasting my or his time by pretending to be interested when we're both bored out of our minds. It's not exactly a good start to a relationship, is it?\" \"I guess not. But he was nice.\" \"Nice, like I-wanna-rip-your-clothes-off, nice, or nice like I'd-like-to-be-your-friend, nice?\" Nora looked at Agent Todd awkwardly, knowing he'd heard. Agent Todd just stared straight ahead at the front of the room, studiously ignoring her and paying attention to her at the same time. She knew this wasn't what he'd had in mind when he'd signed up to be a secret service agent. Eventually, they all wanted to be on the president's detail, but they had to work their way there, sometimes from Nora, sometimes from her little brother, Connor. Either way, a babysitting gig was not what they wanted, so when they were around, Nora tried to limit the amount of girly talk she engaged in. \"Friends.\" \"Then tell him that.\" \"I think I should give him a chance first,\" Nora said. \"Suit yourself. I think you're wasting your time though. Clearly, there's no spark.\" Nora grinned, \"Duly noted.\" A couple girls sat in front of them, and one turned back to look at Nora, before quickly spinning back around. She hunched over her desk, and her two friends leant closer. Nora could hear them muttering, and the sound of pages being turned on a newspaper. Her cheeks tinged pink, sure they were whispering about her. Nora stared determinedly straight ahead, not letting it get to her. People talked about her all the time. Most didn't do it so blatantly, though. \"What have you got there?\" Amy asked, reaching over them and pulling the paper out of their hands. Her eyes skimmed the paper as the girls glared venomously at her, but not saying anything. Amy glanced at Nora, before folding the paper and going to hand it back to the girls. Nora frowned, suddenly suspicious. \"Wait a sec - ,\" \"There's nothing interesting,\" Amy said, handing it back to the middle girl. Nora's frown deepened and she grabbed the paper before they could fully turn back around. She opened it to the first page. The head line read: PRESIDENT'S DAUGHTER INVOLVED IN SECRET LOVE AFFAIR? Underneath it was a picture of Nora and Mike. It was when she'd grabbed his arm to spin him around to look at her, at the pool party yesterday, but it looked like her hand was reaching to grab his butt. She was plastered on the front page, in her bikini, grabbing at Mike's butt, his face conveniently turned away from the camera. It wasn't a very good picture, obviously taken from a distance, and zoomed in. It was pixilated, making Mike even more obscure, but it was obvious who the girl in the bikini was. Underneath the picture was a sub headline: 'Who is the mystery guy that's got Nora all hands-y?' \"Oh. My. God.\" She mumbled, her face going red. This couldn't be happening. \"It wasn't even like that! God I wasn't… I mean, he's such… ugh! I'd never reach for his butt! God, this picture is so out of context!\" \"I know,\" Amy said, her voice soothing as she tried to comfort Nora. Her nose scrunched in distaste, and she scoffed, \"As if I'd want to grab his butt!\" \"That's not what it looks like,\" Mike said, his unexpected voice making her jump slightly in surprise and she turned to see him leaning forward from the row behind them, his elbows resting on his knees. \"This is a private conversation,\" Amy glared at him. \"Back off.\" He raised an eyebrow at Nora, \"Is she your new spokeswoman?\" \"No,\" Nora snapped, before Amy could retort. \"She's right though, so mind your own business.\" \"It is my business, seeing as it's my business you're trying to cop a feel of,\" he smirked, his eyes lingering on the picture, before leaning back and folding his arms now that he had their attention. \"As if! You and I both know that's not how it happened,\" Nora gritted out between clenched teeth. \"And anyone who believes what they read in this article is an idiot.\" He just continued to grin, \"Read it. They call me a 'stud'.\" \"Clearly, they've never met you then,\" Nora snapped, turning around in her seat, and hunching over as she read it, Amy looking over her shoulder. The president's daughter, Nora Asher, attended a pool party yesterday, much to the delight of her cohort. Many party-goers expressed joy and exuberance at the thought of her attending. The heat of the day made it perfect for a dip in the pool, but perhaps Nora got a little too much sun. The usually somewhat demure girl was seen openly grabbing at a peer's bottom. Who was he? And how long had they been keeping their relationship under tabs for, that she could reach for that particular part of his anatomy? At this stage, only speculations present themselves. The reported 'stud' seen in the above photograph appears to be unsuspecting to any wandering hands, but reporters doubt he had any objections to the promiscuously exposed, bikini-clad daughter of America's current President. The general consensus from the male population present at the party is that Ms. Asher was looking 'hot'. Which led this reporter to wonder at the cause of this new-found self-expression. Was it just the heat of the day? Was there any intoxicating substances present? The music had been blaring loudly, so perhaps the heady rush of freedom and the college experience was just too overwhelming for her. Or maybe, the temptation to touch her beau in a very public and borderline-inappropriate gesture of affection was too hard to keep in anymore. Party-goers reported both individuals leaving the party early, despite the exquisite weather, perhaps implying they left together? Reporters can't say for certain, but we can wonder at what a stunt like this will result in amongst the general public. Nora has been a long-standing role model for many young girls; she's always been immaculately presented, and on her best behaviour. Maybe the daughter of the president isn't so squeaky clean, after all. Maybe being away from her daddy, Mr. President, has given her the room to express herself. A word to the wise, Ms. Asher, if you want to get frisky with a guy, maybe you should do it in private… Nora finished reading the short article, muttering dismally, \"My dad's going to kill me.\" \"Actually, I'd say he's more likely to kill the guy in the picture,\" she mused. \"In which case, I wouldn't mind pointing out the suspect for him,\" she said threateningly over her shoulder. But Mike wasn't there anymore; he was back further, next to a couple other guys Nora didn't know. He didn't even look at them. \"Can you hold my bag for me while I go die of embarrassment?\" Nora groaned, eyes unable to move away from the paper. Her bag vibrated against her leg, and she jumped, reaching down and pulling out her phone. A picture of her dad showed on the screen. Nora grimaced. \"I can't deal with him right now.\" She rejected the call. A minute later, he called back. She rejected it again, turning it off and slipping it back into her bag. The professor walked into the room. \"Good morning! Before we get started, I'm sure you've all seen the paper, and are just dying to read and or analyse it, however, this article,\" he held up the paper to show the class the picture, and Nora cringed, \"is not, in fact, a literary classic. If anything, it's a poorly written, subjective and, uh, how did they put it…? Ah yes, 'borderline-inappropriate', article that offers nothing but a picture and some speculative rubbish to the reader. In which case, today's lecture will not be spent discussing the possible relationship between Ms. Asher and this mystery man, so don't even bother asking. My eight am class already tried it. Instead, I'd like you to channel your enthusiasm for this article, into reading and discussing the works of…\" Nora closed her eyes, pinching the bridge of her nose. This day was not turning out so good. Despite the lecturer's speech, Nora could still hear people talking and whispering about her. She was now counting down the seconds until the two hour lecture was over. She really wished the time would go by faster, but considering that she wanted it to, she highly doubted it would. She tried to concentrate on the professor, and the lecture. But her skin felt hot and tight, and she was on edge. Every glance in her direction, every muffled whisper, every giggle, made her flush in embarrassment, positive they were to do with her. She glanced back slowly. Mike just sat there, intent on the content of the lecture. It was easy for him. Nobody knew it was him in the picture, he mostly kept to himself, and wasn't present in large social circles, so he was completely at ease. Or at least somewhat at ease; his shoulders looked tense. Nobody was whispering about how he could be sleeping with someone, a mystery someone. Nobody was trying to figure it out. No one was talking about how he tried to grab someone's butt. It was embarrassing. Especially because she knew who it was in the picture, and that she'd never touch him if she could help it. And now he had something to hold over her. His eyes dropped to her. When he saw her looking, he smirked. Nora scowled, turning back around. He was so smug. So conceited. And for the life of her, she couldn't figure out what she'd done to him. She'd never met him before, certain she would have remembered someone like him. Someone who looked like him. She'd been over it a million times in her head, and she just didn't know. She tried letting it go. She did. But Nora had a stubborn streak, that wouldn't let her give up until she figured it out. Her mum said she got that from her dad. The girls in front of her looked back at her, turning back around when Nora met their gaze. She glanced to the side, to find more people looking at her. A guy winked at her lecherously, and she felt a lurch in her gut, looking away. Only to find more eyes. Nora swallowed, grabbed her stuff and stood up. She would have liked to make an unobtrusive, invisible getaway. But when she stood up, so did Agent Todd and Jackson. She could feel the pressure of more than a hundred eyes on her back as she walked out the lecture theatre. She just wanted to be alone, so she veered to the right, and went into the girl's bathroom. She locked the stall behind her, sitting down on the lid, staring at her hands. The hot, tight feeling of her skin didn't go away, despite being out from under everyone's gaze. What was the matter with her? She was being such a baby. Get a grip. She was in newspapers all the time. Admittedly, the articles weren't about her. And she'd always been fully dressed, towards the back of the shot as she stood beside her mother and father. The articles were always about her dad, not her. Not her possible love life. Which, really, was none of anyone else's business. Nora was a private kind of person, and having a lot of people suddenly discussing something that fell under that 'private' category, did not sit well with her. At all. She needed to try to get used to it. Now that she was at college, there was suddenly an upsurge in attention being focused on her. On her movements, and now she knew, her love life also. She could properly prepare herself now. She could handle the attention, even if she wished she didn't have to. She walked out of the stall, turning the tap on and splashing water on her face. She switched her phone on, just as it called again. Her dad. Shocker. She sighed, and answered the phone. \"Daddy. It's not what it looks like.\" It was always best to start the conversation with 'daddy'. It was a gentle reminder that she was such a daddy's girl, and that she was still his little girl. And he surely couldn't get made at his little girl. Hopefully. \"Who is he?\" Was his question, his voice forcibly calm. \"No one. A jerk. And I wasn't reaching for his butt, that article is a load of rubbish!\" Her dad harrumphed, but Nora got the feeling that his irritation wasn't directed at her. She thought… it might be for the guy in the picture. Mike. She couldn't understand why, though. \"Nora, I want you to swear to me you weren't grabbing some guy's butt. Please,\" his voice was almost pleading, and Nora suppressed a grin. Her and her dad had had a conversation like this often. He'd complain she was growing up too fast, and what not, and Nora would have to assure him she'd always need her daddy. And if she ever got a boyfriend, she knew her dad would not like him. Ever. \"I swear , dad.\" She said earnestly. \"Hear how serious I am. He's a jerk. He's the last guy I'd touch. Ever. Trust me. I was reaching to spin him around, because he pushed me in the pool, on purpose , and I wanted to know why!\" \"Alright…\" he said slowly. \"You're not mad?\" \"If that's what you said happened, I believe you, and that picture is taken out of context. I'll see what we can do about suing the reporter for libel.\" But that wasn't a 'no' to her question. Her dad wasn't really one to get angry, or to physically show his anger. But that didn't mean he couldn't be annoyed or disappointed. Libel, by definition, was false. And that article was definitely false. The First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution meant that the United States had just about the freest press in the world. Reporters could report what they liked, so long as they remained within the bounds of professionalism. But the article never made any claims. It was all supposition and guiding implications. The journalist had done well not to incriminate themselves. Nora knew they probably wouldn't win, if her dad tried to sue the reporter. And she didn't want to make this into a big deal. She just wanted the whole thing to go away. \"Try not to get into any more trouble, okay Nora? Love you.\" He hung up before Nora could ask him not to do anything about the article. The President of the Free World had a lot of demands on his time. \"Love you too, dad,\" she sighed. It was too late to go back into the lecture. Not that she even wanted to. So she went to the library to continue working on her essay before her next lecture. Thanks for reading! I hope you liked this chapter! I'll definitely be continuing this story, and I have a plan of where it's going to go, that I hope you'll like. I know there isn't much Mike in here yet, but there will be. I want you to get to know Nora first, because this story is really about her. NGArmyWife: Thanks for reviewing again! I'll definitely continue it so long as there're people interested in reading more of it (though, truthfully, I'd probably continue it even if people weren't. It's a lot of fun for me to write). Haha, so true! I haven't really gotten to any of the benefits yet, but definitely the disadvantages! I should definitely do that! I started watching Bounty Hunter, and I have to say that you're right – I'm becoming more of a fan! Haha, anyway, I hope you enjoyed this chapter. Thanks for reviewing for me! Mascota: Hey! Thanks for reviewing again! (And for PMing me!)! I'm so glad you like it, though truthfully, there will be less about Mike's character, because it's mainly about Nora, but I'll see what I can do :D Haha, yeah, he's part of Nora's security detail, but because he's a little younger, Ben sent him to the school to keep watch over her undercover, and without her knowing. Just in case, as added protection. He could see her becoming suspicious, and he had to throw her off track, so he's acting like a bit of a jerk. That's good to know then. Don't apologise, your English is fine! I know exactly what the meaning of your words are, so it's all good :D Thanks so much for reviewing for me again! I really hope you liked this chapter too![Chapter 4] The Soldier of War and the Daughter of Peace Chapter Four Nora's alarm went off, and she sat up, switching it off as quickly as she could. Amy just lifted a pillow up and threw it at Nora, before rolling over and falling back asleep. She did that every morning, used to Nora's early morning runs by now. Nora wiped the sleep from her eyes as she pulled on an oversized shirt and her running shorts. She pulled her hair back, rolling her shoulders and stepping outside her room. Agent Todd stood there, eyes straight ahead, having switched with the night shift guys somewhere around five-thirty. \"Morning,\" she mumbled, still feeling sleepy. \"Morning, Ms. Asher,\" he replied, his voice and face neutral, just like a good secret service agent. They were there to protect her, not to invest themselves in her life. \"How're Rebecca and Leo?\" Nora asked, referring to his wife and son. A small smile lit his face, a different kind of light shining in his eyes than the usual aware, on-the-ball one, before he quickly dismissed it, \"Good. Leo's walking now.\" \"That's great,\" Nora smiled, making her way downstairs, Agent Todd right behind her. When she spent enough time with the agents that followed her about, she tended to ask questions. She felt a need to know about the men guarding her. She couldn't place her trust in strangers. At some point, Agents Jackson and Tyler joined them. Nora didn't even hear them. It was a short walk to where Nora liked to run; it covered about two and a half miles through a park, sometimes along a small river. She stretched as she walked. The beginning of her run, the entrance through the park, was marked by the corner of a building, and she headed for it. She would put her back to the wall, and start running, and that would be her starting and finishing line. Just as she reached it though, someone slammed into her, from around the corner, obviously heading for the same path as Nora. Nora was sent stumbling back, losing her balance and landing on her butt. A voice above her said, \"Sorry about that. Oh. It's just you. Will you call off your goon squad?\" Nora glanced up, seeing Mike's arm being held by Agent Jackson as Agent Tyler patted him down for a weapon, or for some sort of signal that said he meant to hurt her. Agent Todd helped her to her feet, \"Are you all right, Miss Asher?\" Who didn't look around corners before they went barging past? It was an accident waiting to happen. But, it was just before six in the morning, and no one really woke up this early in the first place. He obviously didn't expect to see anyone else here. \"Fine, thank you,\" she said, brushing off her shorts, before folding her arms in front of her chest and looking at Mike. He had a loose singlet and sports shorts on, complete with worn running shoes. Nora ignored the way this singlet, like the one from yesterday, displayed his muscled biceps. \"Technically, they don't work for me, so they don't have to do what I say. Otherwise, don't you think I would've told them to let me go places by myself?\" \"All clear,\" Agent Tyler reported, and Mike pulled his arm out of Agent Jackson's grip, an irritated expression on his face. \"I could've told you that,\" Mike grumped. Nora frowned, \"Are you following me?\" Mike snorted disparagingly, \"Don't flatter yourself. This is my running route.\" \"It's mine too,\" Nora felt the need to say, pointing out the obvious. \"Well, don't worry, after today, you won't see me here again,\" he said, walking past her, and gradually picking up his pace into a run. Nora looked incredulously at Agent Todd, who shrugged, clearly confused and somewhat amused by the exchange. Nora took off after him, catching up to him fairly easily, and Nora vaguely wondered if he was running at a slower pace on purpose. His well-muscled legs looked like they could take him places fast. \"What's your problem?\" He didn't look at her, didn't even seem surprised that she was keeping up with him, or that she was pestering him again, \"I don't have one.\" \"Clearly, you do.\" He grunted, muttering something under his breath that sounded suspiciously like 'conceited much?', but she couldn't be sure. \"What was that?\" She snapped, her shoulders tensing. \"I'm sorry I'm not fawning over you like every other guy at this university. Did you want me to hang off your every word when I just don't give a shit?\" He raised an eyebrow, turning to look at her as she kept stride with him. Her legs were beginning to burn, her face tinged pink from exertion. Her dad had wanted her to start running. At first, he ran with her. Then he stopped, suddenly much busier. Presidency did that. But he still wanted her to run. That way, he'd said, if something ever happened, you could run for as far and as long as necessary. So she continued, because he wanted her to. After a while, she even started to enjoy it. She found it was a good way to just stop thinking. Sometimes her head was so full, that the momentary break was what she needed most. She grimaced, \"They're not fawning.\" He rolled his eyes at her denial. \"And no, of course not. But… do you have to be so rude to me?\" He grinned widely at her, and she could see a slight sheen of sweat over his forehead. His voice didn't come out in spurts or panting breaths, though. \"That's part of my charm. It's what makes people curious.\" It was Nora's turn to roll her eyes, \"Don't you mean nauseous?\" He just continued to grin, ignoring her insult. \"You'll see.\" It sounded vaguely ominous for Nora, and she asked apprehensively, \"I'll see what?\" He took a minute to answer, \"Maybe this is all a part of my ploy.\" Nora pursed her lips. She shouldn't ask. It was what he wanted her to do, and she hardly wanted to give him the satisfaction. But… she wanted to know, damnit. She wanted to figure this guy out properly, so she could forget all about him, and never waste time thinking about his meaning or motives ever again. If she could just get some insight, she'd never have to wonder about him again, and a repeat of yesterday's article wouldn't be an issue. At least, not with him, because she'd be able to completely ignore him. \"What ploy?\" \"Wouldn't you like to know?\" She knew it. She shouldn't have asked. \"Ugh! You're so infuriating!\" There was no ploy, he was just making fun of her. And like the sucker she was, she fell for it. She glared stonily at the grass. Why was she even bothering with him? She didn't care anymore if he didn't like her, or why. He laughed at her exasperation, clearly enjoying their conversation, much to Nora's indignation, and she contemplated picking something up to throw at his head. \"Do you really want to know? She griped, \"That would be why I asked.\" She wasn't so sure she wanted to know anymore. From the way he was grinning, she was pretty sure she wouldn't like it. \"To get you to fall for me.\" For a minute, Nora was silent. Then she burst into hysterical laughter, which didn't help with the whole breathing thing, making her stop. She braced her hands against her knees, raking in great, gulping gasps as she tried to calm herself down. She wiped away tears of mirth, \"Please. I wouldn't fall for you if you were the last guy on planet earth.\" The idea was preposterous. Ridiculous. Nora didn't even like this guy, let alone even want to be his friend. \"Really?\" He asked, surprised. Too surprised for Nora's tastes, and she looked up to find his hands on his hips as he breathed deeply, watching her spectacle. \"Well that's interesting seeing as this is the second time you've chased after me. I'd say it's working pretty well.\" Her laughter dried up, positive now that he was teasing her. Mocking her. It pissed her off, partly because he had a point, and she took off running, shoving her shoulder into his as she passed him. \"This is my running route.\" Behind her, she could hear her security detail following her. Mike's laughter floated into the air. \"Whatever, your highness ,\" he taunted. She glowered, irritated. What was his problem ? She'd done nothing to him, and he'd pushed her in the pool, made her appear in the paper looking ridiculous, forced her into unwanted spotlight for the wrong reasons, and now he was making fun of her. The next second, he was overtaking her, running ahead. She frowned, annoyed that he could beat her at something she'd been doing for years. This was supposed to be her time. Her time to not think. To be alone by choice, and to just enjoy nature. To work up a sweat and push herself. And he was ruining it. Completely. He just barged his way into her life, and she did not appreciate it. She made herself run faster, catching him, and passing him. But then he was passing her, puffing and sweating. They raced like that for a while. There were times Nora was sure she was winning, only to have him speed up past her. She pushed herself faster than she knew she could go, testing him. And he always seemed to be just that bit faster. They flew by other early morning joggers, and walking couples, desperate to beat the other. This was her thing. Up ahead was the looping bit of the track, and they split off to the left, where it would take them up and across the bridge over the river, down to the other side, and back around where it would meet the track for them to run back the other way. It was the half-way point, where Nora usually stopped to catch her breath. And she certainly needed it. Despite her desire to beat him, she slowed, flopping onto the grass to lie on her back, breathing heavily, trying to get enough oxygen to her lungs and thus to her body. Surprisingly, he stopped too, doubling over and bracing his palms against his knees. Sweat patches coloured his singlet in various places; the middle of his back, around his neck, under his arms. Despite her earlier thoughts, she needed to know. \"Can I ask you something?\" She gasped out. He looked at her from his hunched position. \"There's nothing I can do to stop you,\" he muttered dryly. She ignored his unenthusiastic reply. \"Why did you push me in the pool?\" He shrugged, \"You looked hot.\" It was his sly grin that made her frown. Was that… some sort of innuendo? If it was, she didn't appreciate it. And she certainly didn't appreciate the thrill of excitement that shot through her at his words. She clammed up, her face shutting down as she glared up at the sky. He laughed, \"Fucking hell! No retort! Did I just make the president's daughter speechless?\" He asked no one in particular. \"Jerk. At least after today, I won't have to see you here again, ruining my run,\" she managed to growl out, despite still breathing heavily. She despised him, and she would be perfectly fine if she never saw him again. Ever. \"Yeah, about that,\" he began, making her groan in apprehension. \"I've changed my mind.\" \"What?\" Her voice carried a deadly current, and the threat there made him grin. \"I like this track. I don't want to go somewhere else. You can.\" \"Excuse me?\" Her eyebrows raised in surprise. \"You heard me.\" \"I'm not going anywhere,\" she snapped. He shrugged, \"Then you'll just have to deal with seeing me.\" \"No!\" She pulled herself to her feet. This morning had been bad enough; she couldn't handle every morning from now until she finished her degree. She couldn't stand him. \"That's not fair, you said you'd go somewhere else!\" \"I did,\" he agreed. \"And then I changed my mind. How about this? Race me. Winner gets the track.\" \"I'm not racing you for it!\" This was so stupid. Why did he have to be so darn stubborn? He had said he'd leave, so clearly he wasn't that attached to the track in the first place. Why now? Why'd he have to go and change his mind? \"Why? Afraid you'll lose?\" He challenged Nora, his eyes twinkling mischievously. She scoffed, fire burning in her eyes. \"No.\" \"Then what's the problem?\" \"There isn't one.\" She took off, not giving him a chance to say anything else and giving herself a head start. It was unfair, she knew, but she also knew he deserved it. But it didn't matter anyway, because she stepped on her untied shoelaces, her foot jerking forward, and she fell. Right onto Mike, the force of her momentum bringing them both crashing to the ground. Lucky for her, she landed on Mike, so it wasn't so jarring to her. Then again, she did land on Mike, which wasn't lucky at all. \"Oof,\" she muttered, the wind being knocked out of her unexpectedly. She hadn't tripped in years, and it caught her off guard. The older she got, the more traumatizing an experience it became. She pushed herself up, her hands steadied on his firm chest, as she embarrassingly straddled his hips. A very intimate part of herself was pressed against a very intimate part of him, and the loose, thin material of their exercise shorts hardly constituted a barrier. She blinked. She couldn't believe she'd tripped. How embarrassing, right as she was about to take off running. Absentmindedly, his large hands gently grasped the sides of her legs, wincing slightly as he moved his head. He looked up at her, his eyes locking with hers, taking her in. Then he grinned, \"I'm all for a woman on top.\" She made a face at him, his words finally making her realize their position, and she scrambled off him as fast as she could, \"Pig.\" She bent down to tie up her shoelaces as he stood up, \"Were you going to cheat?\" He asked, and she could hear the laugh in his voice. She straightened up, \"No.\" \"Liar.\" \"I'm not a liar,\" she said fiercely. And a little too defensively. She cleared her throat, \"Are we going to race, or not?\" He nodded, and they ran. She didn't get far before he was gaining and then passing her. She clenched her teeth, her breathing harsh in her ears. She would win this. This was her track, not his. They raced hard again, and Nora realized he'd been holding back before. He'd tricked her into thinking he was about the same speed as her. When she saw the building up ahead, she put on a burst of speed, desperate not to let him win. They passed the imaginary finish line on the same step, catching him off guard, and she collapsed to the ground again. She closed her eyes. She voiced her thoughts, saying aloud, \"You didn't let me win.\" \"And?\" He panted. \"Most people do.\" She mused on it. \"It's a nice change.\" Yes, she'd wanted to completely win, but it was nice that she hadn't. Most people just let her win, and it bugged her, especially when it was obvious that they had. \"Well, I'm a competitive guy.\" She harrumphed, pulling herself up and walking away from him, not eager to spend more time in his company. He called after. \"Goodbye Nora.\" He said her name like it was the punch line to a joke. \"Tomorrow morning, same time?\" Her jaw tensed and she didn't turn around or reply. Thanks for reading! Let me know what you think! Replies: NGArmyWife: Aww, thank you so much! I'm so stoked you liked it! Haha, oh yeah, she definitely doesn't know it yet. It makes it so much fun to write! Wow. Just wow. Thank you so much! That's such a great compliment, that you felt Nora's emotions! Gosh, thank you so much! BINGO! That's precisely what's going on with Mike! He can't let himself like Nora, but he has to be around her, so it's tricky, and what he ends up doing is his way of trying to keep it all in balance. This chapter had more Mike in it (Yay!), and I hope you liked it – it's a bit of fun, for sure, but it gave them a bit more time to themselves to figure each other out. Though, Nora walked away just as confused by him as ever :D And seriously, major fan of him right here, now. Each movie just makes me like him more! Mascota: Thank you so much! It's fantastic that you're still enjoying it! It bodes well for me . Thank you! Well, it's a good sign if you can read it twice; on your way to work and when you reviewed! At least it's not too dull then, because I'm not heading straight into the events of the movie, or anything. I'm glad you love it, and the details! And thanks so much for PMing me! It's so interesting to meet someone from a different country! Gosh, thanks so much! I really hope you enjoyed this chapter; there was some more Mike in it, and more interaction between him and Nora, which I hope you liked too! She really just doesn't know what to make of Mike, so it's so much fun to write! Koryandrs: Haha, thank you so much! You seem to be reviewing a bunch of my stories lately! Thank you so much for that, it's really sweet of you! Thank you so much; I'm glad you like how I developed my OC, and the level of detail I include, and the dialogue! Whoops, thanks for pointing out the 'headline' thing! I'll fix that soon! It's funny, because my phone is linked to receive my emails, and it makes this funny noise, so when you reviewed the first chapter, it did it, then not long after, the second chapter, then the third! It scared my dogs! But thank you so much for taking the time to review each of the chapters, though! You didn't have to do that, but it's so nice of you! Thanks again![Chapter 5] The Soldier of War and the Daughter of Peace Chapter Five Okay. So, maybe he was on Nora's mind a lot lately. Strike that. Constantly, would be more accurate. Ever since the whole running incident, she'd been adequately preoccupied. When she'd returned to their dorm to have a shower and get ready for the day, she'd been irritable and grumpy, which was unusual for Nora after a run, and Amy picked up on it almost straight away. \"Alright, what's up with you?\" She'd sighed as Nora picked a shirt from her drawers, pulled it on, looked down, then tugged it off and threw it across the room. \"Nothing.\" \"Come on,\" Amy had raised an eyebrow at her then, watching another shirt follow the first across the room. \"You're usually unnaturally cheery in the morning. It's unnerving. Seriously. But this morning, you're all grumpy and angry…you're like me. So spill.\" So she'd told her what had happened. About Mike ruining her run and getting in her head, teasing and insulting her, and just generally ruining her morning. Amy had laughed, undaunted by the glare Nora threw at her. \"I think he likes you.\" Nora just looked at her. \"Did you not hear anything I just said? The asshole hates me,\" she'd deadpanned. She wasn't usually so harsh. She didn't generally insult people or call them names. But for Mike, she'd make an exception. Amy had just laughed again, shaking her head and heading to have a shower, leaving Nora to stew in her angry musings. He'd been there again this morning. At first, Nora had let herself hope he wouldn't turn up. But just as she started to run, he'd appeared next to her, grinning and asking how she slept. And then, just to piss her off, he'd asked what she slept in. Very quickly, he was coming to know what made her angry and what made her uncomfortable. And he was totally using it against her. But she was beginning to notice things about him, too. Like, his rough, low voice had a slight accent to it. She couldn't tell what it was, but she knew it wasn't all-American. Also, he didn't seem particularly put-off by the presence of the Agents behind her, following her every step. In fact, he didn't even look at them most of the time, and they certainly didn't stop him from bugging her. The lines around his eyes made him look older sometimes, in certain lights. And sometimes, when he was quiet, and so obviously in his head, Nora noticed that his brown eyes seemed… kind of haunted. Like he'd seen too much of the horrible parts of the world, the bad bits. It made Nora wonder what he'd seen; clearly, it wasn't all fun times and rainbows and lollipops. But then she'd shake her head and remind herself that she didn't care. Nora sat in the Coffee Shop, sipping at her iced chocolate. Amy had a lecture, so she figured she'd wait there for Amy to finish. She had an online exam to study for, anyway. Her textbook was opened at a page about halfway through the book, her notebook, piles of handouts and notes surrounded her. Red coloured sticky notes stuck out all over the place. She had about half a page of notes when her phone rang. It was Will. She pursed her lips, looking at the screen of her iPhone. He was probably calling to cancel their date. He probably decided it was too much of a hassle to date a girl who seemed to be constantly in the spotlight. It was two days after that horrid article about her, but people were still talking about it. Will had to have seen it. \"Hello?\" She asked, not being able to stop the apprehension twisting her gut. While she wouldn't be entirely bummed if he did cancel, it still hurt to be rejected. \"Hey, Nora. How are you?\" She tried to discern the tone of his voice, but quickly discovered she was useless at it. \"Alright. What about you?\" \"Good. And you?\" He asked, before he groaned. \"I…already asked that. Sorry. I just get nervous talking to you. Which is such a lame thing to say. Feel free to stop me anytime.\" Nora laughed, \"It's okay. Why did you call?\" \"Well…\" And there it was. \"I'm going to have to cancel our date.\" At least she couldn't say she didn't see it coming. \"That's okay Will. I understand.\" And she did. A lot of people were put off by it, by the fact she was always appearing in the paper, and how if people were around her often enough, they'd appear there too. And not always in a flattering light. It wasn't for everyone, and she understood when people just said no. \"Oh – no! That's not what I meant!\" This was taking an unexpected turn. \"It's just that I forgot I promised a friend I'd help him study for his exam that day. I'd still really like to take you out, though. There's a carnival coming to town in two weeks. I want that to be our first date. I want it to be fun.\" Nora's eyebrows were dangerously close to her hairline. \"Oh? Two weeks. Okay.\" \"Yeah,\" And Nora could almost hear him nodding his head enthusiastically. \"I know it's a long way off, but I was thinking… maybe we could get coffee tomorrow morning. Not as a date. Just to hang out.\" Nora frowned. He'd obviously put a lot of thought into this. He wanted to make their first date fun, and Nora really appreciated it. It was sweet of him. But he still wanted to see her sooner than that. The thought made her smile. It was nice, knowing there was someone who couldn't wait two weeks to see her again. \"Sounds good, Will.\" \"Great. What time are you awake by?\" \"Well, I can be there by eight, but I have a ten am lecture.\" \"Great. The Coffee Shop, eight am. It's a not-date.\" Nora giggled, even though it was so very un-like her. She wasn't really a giggler – a laugher, yes, but a giggler? Not her thing. \"Okay.\" She hung up. And, she was actually smiling. She knew it was a good idea to give Will another chance. Not everybody was good at first impressions, and he had probably been nervous when they first met. Nora settled back in her seat, pulled out some headphones and started listening to music while she studied. … She only had half an hour until Amy's lecture finished, and they could get some lunch. Nora was starved, her brain felt suspiciously like mush, and her hand was cramping something chronic. For the past ten minutes, she'd spent more time bopping her head slightly to the songs blasting through her ear phones than to her textbook. She changed the song, then went back to reading her textbook. She read the same line about five times before she realized, and even then she didn't know what it was about. She sighed, rubbing at her eyes. She ordered anther drink, and made herself focus. A body fell into the seat across from her, making her jump in surprise. She automatically assumed it was Amy, her lecture ending a little early. But when she glanced up, she realized it wasn't. Mike. She didn't know why she was surprised, but she was. He was looking away, getting the waitress' attention and ordering a drink, giving Nora enough time to take in his appearance. His hair was getting a little longer, and Nora thought it was probably annoying him, even though it wasn't long in the first place. He had a baseball cap on again, a different one this time, but she couldn't read what it said on the front because his face was turned away. As she scrutinized him, she thought that her initial guess of about 25 or 26 was off; he was closer to 27. He had to have about eight to ten years on her. She looked back down at her books before he caught her staring, concentrating on her notebook. But if she was distracted before, she certainly was now. What was it with him? She had no clue, but she was determined to ignore him. It made no difference to Nora if he sat there or not. She didn't care in the least . Or, that was what she told herself. She hated that she wasn't sure. The waitress with the name tag Renee dropped her drink off at Nora's table, and Nora thanked her, taking a sip before looking back down at her notebook. She didn't even acknowledge his presence. Hopefully, he could take a hint. Apparently not, because she could just feel him grinning at her, clearly aware of what she was trying to do. And he said it himself; he was a competitive guy. He wouldn't let her win this… this thing they were playing at. Everywhere she went, he inevitably turned up. She was sure he was doing it on purpose . Just like the pool incident. He started tapping a rhythm onto the table. Her eyes flickered to his fingers, then to her notebook. When he didn't miss a beat or slow down after two minutes, she learned he also had precision coordination. Figures. She didn't know the tune he was tapping to, and slowly it began to irritate her. Damnit. She sighed loudly. \"Do you mind ?\" \"Not at all,\" he grinned and just continued to tap away. He looked up at her, not needing to watch his fingers to keep it in time. \"What are you doing?\" \"What does it look like,\" she said incredulously, gesturing at the textbook and piles of notes and sticky notes gathered on her small table. He obviously wasn't blind, so she had a hunch he was only asking her questions to distract her and annoy her. It was working. \"What are you listening to?\" \"What's with all the questions,\" she shook her head as he reached across the table unabashedly and grabbed her phone from under her fingers. His own hand was surprisingly warm, despite the Coffee Shop being air conditioned. The skin of his fingers was rough, and it was so much bigger than her own soft hand. They were hands used to manual labour, and a hard living style. He pressed the home button of her iPhone to see what song she was listening to. He frowned, looking back up at her. \"S&M; by Rhiannon?\" The he grinned, \"Didn't have you pegged for one of those sex freaks.\" She glared at him, \"Excuse me?\" \"S&M.; You know what it stands for, right?\" He asked. His already wide grin widened when she shook her head. She'd never bothered to look it up. She guessed it had to do with sex, considering the lyrics. She liked it because the beat was so darn catchy. He laughed. She watched him suspiciously, asking slowly, \"Why? What does it mean?\" He just shook his head and continued to wear that stupid, shit eating, self-satisfied grin. She clenched her jaw, \"Fine. Way to be mature. And by the way, this song happens to be extremely catchy. Don't be so rude; you can't control your sexuality, and by saying 'freak', you imply it to be unnatural, which is completely incorrect. Now, if you don't mind, I have work to be doing.\" He didn't move and she sighed again, like he was putting her out. \"That was your cue to leave.\" \"Damn. I missed it. I was never any good at acting, anyway. Too many lines and cues to remember.\" She rolled her eyes, pursing her lips to hide a grin. She admitted to herself that he could be charming. But she quickly dismissed the thought and gave it strict orders to never return. She lifted her iced chocolate, taking a sip, while trying to maintain an icy glare at Mike. And as a result, she got cream over her face, having forgotten about it. She flushed in embarrassment while he grinned, his eyes watching her movements closely. She wiped at her mouth with a napkin, licking her lips. He laughed at her, shaking his head. His eyes were focused on her nose and he reached towards her face. She jerked back in response, watching him with wide eyes, \"What are you doing?\" \"You missed a bit,\" he informed her, gesturing at his own nose. She swiped at her approximation of where he was pointing and his lips quirked. \"You missed it again.\" She held perfectly still as he reached forward, his finger gliding against the side of her nose, and wiping away the tiny dollop of cream, holding his hand up for her to see. \"There.\" She gritted her teeth, about to thank him, when a voice came across the shop, \"I hope I'm not interrupting…?\" For the second time, Nora was startled by another person. This was why she'd never make it in a job where she needed to be observant to her surroundings. So, that pretty much ruled out being a secret service agent. Amy stood there, her cheeks tinged pink from the heat outside the Coffee Shop, her books held in her hands, and her eyebrows raised in question at Nora. \"No. Definitely not,\" Nora informed her, widening her eyes at Amy in an I-don't-know-what's-wrong-with-him way. Amy took the hint, reading her easily. She turned her attention to Mike. \"That's my seat.\" Nora mouthed a thank you at her, grateful. For about a nanosecond. Then Amy opened her mouth to continue on. \"If you want to flirt with Nora, do it in a different seat.\" \"Hang on a second,\" Nora began. \"I wasn't - ,\" Mike said at the same time. \"He's the last person I'd let flirt with me,\" Nora scoffed, rolling her eyes. Mike looked at her, \"Well, you're not exactly my type either, your highness .\" He did a mock bow from his sitting position. He was irritated now, and Nora realized it was the first time he'd shown that kind of emotion. Usually, he was grinning, or laughing, teasing her and pissing her off. But he was always enjoying himself when he was. He didn't seem particularly thrilled right now. She narrowed her eyes at him, \"You're such an asshole.\" \"You're not so much fun, yourself.\" Her eyes widened in exasperation, hissing at him, \"Then why did you sit down?\" \"You know what?\" He said, a frown marring his face as he stood up. \"I think I know when I'm not wanted.\" \"Do you really, though? Because I distinctly remember asking you, in no uncertain terms, to leave . I mean, how much clearer can I be than, 'that was your cue to leave' ?\" She asked, looking around the shop like she was waiting for someone to answer her rhetorical question. He did another mock bow as he shoved the chair under the table. The wooden legs of it collided with her shins, and she hissed in pain. \"Have a nice life, your highness .\" \"Does that mean you're getting your own running route?\" She asked hopefully, calling after him. Did he mean that he wouldn't be seeing her again? Or bothering her again? Hope filled her chest cavity. \"Oh, you'd like that, wouldn't you?\" He snapped, flinging the door to the Coffee Shop open and waving dismissively above his head as he walked out, not turning around. She was glaring at the door, even though he wasn't there anymore. Nora turned to Amy, \"He's so annoying!\" \"Uh-huh?\" She asked, a speculative look on her face. \"Did you know you're blushing?\" \"What?\" Nora frowned, her hands going to her cheeks. Sure enough, they felt hot under her fingers. \"No wonder. He pisses me off.\" \"If you say so,\" she muttered, shoving her books into her bag. She must have darted out of the room as soon as the lecture finished, not even stopping to pack her stuff away. \"What was that?\" Nora asked, frowning. She'd heard her, but she was confused as to her meaning. Her tone was almost…disbelieving, or somewhat sarcastic. \"Nothing,\" she shook her head. \"Did you want to get lunch?\" \"Yes. I'm starved. I'm so hungry I could eat a horse.\" What Nora didn't hear, as she packed up her own books and notes, was Amy mumble under her breath, \"Being sexually frustrated sure can make you work up an appetite.\" So…What'd'ya think? I know that at the moment, there isn't much of a plot, but I'm working up to it. So please bear with me :D And, here are the replies: NGArmyWife: Awww, shucks :) Glad I could give you a good start, at least! You're most definitely welcome (for the chapter, and for the images of a sweaty Mike :D Haha!). Thank you so much, I'm relieve you think I've got his attitude right; I'm always a bit iffy when I write some of his responses to Nora! Haha, I DID! That's crazy you could tell! Haha, it was a good movie! Thank you so much! I hope to keep the complications coming, for now :D I'm really glad you're enjoying their burgeoning relationship, because I just love writing it! At the moment, it's my favourite story to be writing! Yes! Haha, lots of frustration, curiosity and attraction (though she wouldn't admit the last one!) I'm really glad I can make you feel what Nora feels –it's such a big compliment! Thanks so much for reviewing this for me, again! Haha, it's really sweet of you to continue reviewing like this! And oh my gosh, thank you so much for PMing me! That was really, super sweet of you! Thank you so much! Mascota: Hey, thanks for reviewing and PMing me again! It's really, really nice of you! Naw, you're too kind! I wouldn't say I'm an artist when I write the characters, but I appreciate it nonetheless! I'll be walking around going 'Yeah. That's right. I'm an artist. Someone said it.', and then eventually all my friends and family will just get sick of me being so conceited, and my friends will stop talking to me, and my family will ignore me, and it'll be all your fault! Haha, no, really thank you though! It's really nice of you! Thanks so much for sticking with me on this story! I will definitely be continuing the story (At this stage, I'm thinking there'll be roughly 30, maybe 40 chapters), but sometimes it just takes me longer to get the updates out. If it's ever taking me too long, then just send me a PM and be like 'What's taking you so long?'! Haha, thanks :D[Chapter 6] The Soldier of War and the Daughter of Peace Chapter Six Nora sipped at her drink, pressing her lips together, desperately searching her mind for something, God, anything , to say. Her and Will looked at each other. There was silence in abundance. And Nora was worried it'd be awkward. Pff. Ludicrous. Now she wished she'd spent some time coming up with a list of things to say. But she'd stupidly thought she didn't need to. They'd spent the last couple minutes, after the initial 'How are you?' and 'I'm good', just sitting at a two seater table looking at each other, at the room, at the other people walking past and into the Coffee Shop. \"So…\" Nora said, at the same time as Will, even though she couldn't think of a single thing to say. \"You go first.\" \"Alright,\" he cleared his throat. \"I just have a question, actually. About the article that was in the newspaper a while ago…\" Nora groaned, nodding in understanding, before explaining, \"That article was a load of rubbish. I wasn't grabbing for his butt. I was reaching to spin him around so I could ask what his problem was. He'd pushed me in the pool, and I just wanted to know why.\" \"Oh, okay,\" Will said, sounding comparatively happier. \"I didn't want to get in the middle of anything.\" \"No, trust me. There is absolutely nothing that could make me grab his butt,\" Nora stressed, making sure he understood just how repulsive the idea was. He smiled, \"Well that's good, because I really didn't want to stop seeing you.\" He made Nora smile. He was sweet. He cleared his throat, looking over Nora's shoulder, \"Are they always following you about?\" Nora glanced over to see Agents Todd and Jackson. Agent Tyler stood closer to the door, and they were all in their suits, glasses, and ear pieces. Most of the time, they were so unobtrusive that she didn't even pay attention to them. She tuned out their talk to each other, letting everyone know exactly where she was and was going. They were amazingly focused. They worked with a single-minded purpose, which was crucial. They were exact. Perfect. Scheduled. They had to be. Sometimes, it grinded on Nora's nerves. For once, she wanted to be late. She wanted to deviate from the schedule. Since starting at college though, there had been less rigid structure to her day. And admittedly, she had a lot of free reign over her day. It was only when there was a specific event she had to be present at; it was a lot of work to get there. A fundraiser. A charity of sorts. A meeting. A debate. Those were the times when there was a schedule. At the university, when she moved from class to class, there were a large number of agents she didn't even see, standing down hallways, at entrances, moving in sync with her. If it was a multi-level building, you could bet there were agents stationed on each level, covering all exits and entrances. Agent's Tyler, Todd and Jackson were her 'near' agents. They were the ones she knew; the ones almost always with her, station close to her person. The others were her 'perimeter' agents, more concerned with her environment and potential dangers lurking in that environment than her movements within it. Nora was the most well protected eighteen year old in America. And really, everyday something didn't go wrong, everyday her father, her mother, her brother or herself didn't die, everyday everything went according to plan, was because those agents were doing their job well. Flawlessly. And most of the time, nobody knew what they did, every single day. Or the kind of determination and focus they carried with them. Nora knew she owed these agents a lot. \"Yes,\" she said seriously to Will. \"Is that going to be a problem?\" That was really a deciding factor. He had to be able to deal with it, if he wanted to date her. They wouldn't be leaving anytime soon. She didn't blame him if he couldn't. The President's daughter didn't get much privacy or alone time. The few times she went on dates didn't end so well or were cut short, sometimes because of misinterpreted threats, or suspicion by her agents. Sometimes because she attracted a crowd; one person would recognize her, ask for a photo with her, and that would just attract more people to do the same. She'd been caught in the middle of a mob who wanted her picture once, on a date. She wasn't surprised when he didn't call her again. Was it any wonder that the one time she'd been kissed had been broken up after only a second? It was more of a lips-brushing than a lips-meeting kiss. He seemed uncomfortable by it, but shook his head anyway, \"No.\" She smiled, relieved. \"Good. Besides, after a while, you won't even notice them. I often forget they're even there,\" Nora encouraged. \"Isn't that right, Agent Jackson?\" She asked, turning back to look at the agent in question. Agent Jackson, in response, continued to watch the people move around the Coffee Shop. He'd kept his shades on, despite being indoors, as the whole of one wall of the shop was just glass panes, and his face was extremely serious. The glass let in a lot of light, particularly early morning light, and it looked out onto the street outside, busy with people. It was a security nightmare for her agents. It left a lot of access to Nora; a clear visual. But there was something about the quaint shop that Nora loved. The fact that it was rarely exceedingly busy, or quiet; there were always people coming and going. She loved that she could stay in there for hours. Agent Todd had told Nora once that Agent Jackson did not believe in interacting with his charges outside of what was required of him. It didn't stop Nora from talking to him, though. It was amusing, to talk to someone who would not talk back. So, she'd often had one-sided conversations with the grave, solemn man. When Agent Jackson did not reply, Nora smiled at him, before turning back to Will. \"So, tell me about yourself.\" After about a minute, she had to hold her smile in place. She had to stop it from slipping off her face. She honestly didn't know what it was about Will that was just so spectacularly… blah . Everything she could feel for him was muted. Diluted. His voice didn't make her want to listen to him forever. He wasn't captivating to her. She felt almost like she was in a professional meeting or interview. She listened like she did for all her lecturers; with focus and a serious concentration. Like she would have an exam on the content he was telling her. she didn't feel the need to listen avidly to what he said, in the way people should be interested in people they want to date, to have a relationship with, to possibly love. Maybe that was her problem. Maybe her notions of love were just mixed up. How many romance novels had she read? Too many to count. Too many stories of soul mates, of raw passion and unrestrained desire, of each other . The characters were always so… immersed in each other, with thoughts of nothing but each other. They were everything; the sun, the moon, the stars. The beauty in the world was visible to them only because they had the other there to share it with. The greatest lovers of history were those who could think of no one else. Romeo and Juliet. Cleopatra and Mark Antony. Heathcliff and Catherine. Anna Karenina and Count Vronsky. Paris and Helen. Napoleon and Josephine. Scarlett and Rhett. Eloise and Abelard. Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy. Maybe Nora just had unrealistic expectations. Love could come in time; it didn't have to be instantaneous. Elizabeth and Darcy hated each other, at first. And then they became quintessential lovers. What did that say? And while it was certainly too early to be considering falling in love with Will, she felt the need to sort it out in her head. She had to know whether it was worth the time they would commit to each other. And maybe she was being too clinical about the whole thing. But that was what Will was doing to her. He didn't make her want to throw caution to the winds, to just run with it and see where this could go for them. That wasn't necessarily a bad thing though. Because really, maybe love wasn't all it was cracked up to be. Paris and Helen started a war, for Christ sakes, in the name of their love. How many men died because of their selfishness? It was ridiculous to start a war just because you couldn't live without each other, couldn't give each other up. Nora didn't think she'd ever be able to hold her love for someone over thousands of men's lives. It made no sense. Heathcliff and Catherine never ended up together, and instead Heathcliff became bitter and twisted. What did it say about love, that it could make someone so angry when it should bring joy? And where to even start with Romeo and Juliet? They died, because they couldn't live without each other. Did love just bring a co-dependence that made them incapable of accessing life outside of each other? Did it make people into foolish idiots? Was there really only ever one person made for another, without who, there was no point in living? If so, how could one be sure they'd found it? There were so many different starts to love, what if someone gave up on their soul mate under the impression they were not the one? And Napoleon and Josephine. Despite Napoleon loving Josephine oh-so-much, he still left her for someone who could give him a son. Regardless of their love, nothing was certain. Love did not equal marriage, and did not equal children and did not equal faithfulness. What was the point of giving your heart to someone who would just step on it on their way to someone else's bed? Love seemed to be more of a bother, than anything else. To Nora, her conclusions were that love made people selfish and foolish. But the subject was so confusingly illogical, that she didn't know what to make of it. There were so many wrong moves. So many unhappy outcomes. A relationship with Will would be safe. He was somewhat enamored with her, and while she might grow to hold more than just a satisfied contentment towards him, she was still safe from making a fool of herself. And Nora was perfectly happy with that. \"But what about you?\" Will asked. Guilt ripped up Nora's chest as she realized, again, she had caught nothing he'd said. she really needed to work on that. It was just so easy to be distracted with him. he didn't test her, or make her focus on everything he said, every tiny facial expression, every momentary body cue to know what he was up to, or what his motives were, or if he was making fun of her. Nora shrugged, \"There's not much to tell that you probably don't already know.\" It was true. A lot of her life was contained in various magazine and newspaper articles. Her family, likes, hobbies, pets. Someone just had to google her; she had her own Wikepedia page. It was all there. He laughed and grinned, \"That is definitely true.\" He laughed again, \"I didn't think…\" Nora's heart sank a little. She wasn't really sure why, but she couldn't look at Will anymore. The brown of her drink suddenly became very interesting, like it held the answers to the worlds questions that would be revealed to her, if only she looked hard enough. She sighed softly, her eyes kind of sad. When Nora apologized, saying she had to get to her next lecture, she was kind of relieved to get away. She sighed again, not sure why. Dating was a lot more complicated than she thought it would be when she finally got to college and could meet older guys. More mature guys. They made a time and date to meet up again in a couple days. When Nora left, she didn't notice Amy catch up to her until the girl tapped her on the shoulder, making Nora jump a foot in the air, slapping a hand over her chest,. \" Jesus . Heart attack. Call for help.\" Amy rolled her eyes, ignoring her comments, \"So, that didn't go so well, huh?\" \"What are you – wait. Were you… spying on me?\" Nora asked, a little outraged and a little defensive. \"So what if I was?\" \"Do you have nothing better to do that spy on me on my date?\" Nora grumbled. \"Nope,\" Amy grinned ecstatically, pleased with herself. She waved her hand about dismissively, \"But that's beside the point. The date, not-date didn't go so well.\" \"It went fine,\" Nora replied defensively. It was hard not to be when she felt that Amy was judging her. \"But that's just it. 'Fine' is not great. It's not spectacular. It's not amazing. It's not –,\" \"I'm well aware of what 'fine' means.\" \"Great. Then you should know it's not something most girls aspire to on a first date.\" \"Technically, it wasn't a date.\" Amy sighed, \"Come off it. Clearly, it was. Let's not kid ourselves here.\" \"Well, we're going to have coffee again soon,\" Nora told her, growing weary of their conversation. Nora was choosing Will, and she didn't like that Amy seemed to be trying to convince her otherwise, or that she seemed to want to undermine that choice. It was up to Nora, and she liked having the choice. She liked being in control. And with Will, she could be in control just fine. It didn't matter that he didn't make her wild with passion. Not to Nora, even if it did to Amy. They were getting closer to her lecture room, and Amy grabbed her arm to stop her from going inside, so she could continue to talk to her. \"Please, just think about it for a second, okay.\" \"I've thought about it, Amy,\" Nora sighed, running a hand through her curling black hair. She pulled it over one of her shoulders, twisting the ends around her finger. Something hard shoved into her shoulder, and she turned to see Mike, turning around in surprise. Clearly, he hadn't seen Nora, and his face was half way to an apology. Just like that first morning running, when he'd walked into her. He just always seemed to be around lately, and it was irritating. She was beginning to suspect he was following her. Or, maybe now that she had spoken to him, she was just more aware of his presence, so that she noticed when he was around or not. He leant down into a sweeping, mock bow, grinning mischievously. Nora rolled her eyes, her jaw clenching \"Watch where you're going, man servant. Next time, you'll be in the stocks for a week.\" If he wanted to play like that, then Nora would just go with it. His friends laughed, and a different kind of light entered his eyes, his lips a half-smile. It was less mischievous this time, more challenging. It sent Nora's blood pumping quickly, thumping loudly in her ears, and she knew her face must be heating again. \"Whatever my queen demands.\" Another bow. She hated when he mocked her. Teased her. When he was impossibly stubborn and annoying. Okay. Nora had been trying to call his bluff. She'd hoped that if she went along with his newest game, he'd stop. But he didn't. He embraced this new turn of events, adapting so easily, going with it flawlessly. He wasn't thrown, or shocked. He just went with it. And Nora hated it, because he'd called her bluff. She hated him referring to her as a queen, as some sort of royalty. It implied she was spoilt, used to getting her way, and everything she wanted. \"Ugh! You're so infuriating!\" \"You say the sweetest things,\" he laughed. And then they were gone, leaving Nora a frustrated mess. She glared in his direction, despite not being able to see him anymore. Amy's voice pulled her back to their earlier conversation. But this time it'd taken a different turn. \"What is it about this guy that gets you so worked up?\" \"He's a jerk, Amy.\" Nora said it like it was obvious. The duh was implied. \"No,\" she shook her head. \"It's more than that. I've seen the way you look at him. The way you talk to him.\" Nora frowned, confused where she was going with this. \"With utter disgust and contempt?\" She was pretty sure that was how she looked and spoke to Mike. And she should know. Considering it was her, and she'd been careful what expressions she displayed in public ever since she was younger and a photographer had snapped a shot of her poking her tongue out at an older member of parliament who had implied she was a little kid. Even though, technically, she was at the time. \"No. With infatuation and fascination. He gets you hot,\" She grinned, with a familiar impish glint. Nora scoffed, \"No! God, no! Don't be ridiculous!\" \"I'm not,\" she shook her head, her voice dead serious. \"He gets your blood pumping in a way Will never can and never will.\" \"Stop it. This is absurd.\" Nora was quickly growing irritated with this conversation. With what she was implying. With what she was saying. She was over the conversation, sick of Amy trying to change her mind about Will. She was so desperate to make her not date Will, she was making up stuff about Nora and Mike now, and it wasn't sitting well with Nora. Amy didn't see it on her face, or hear it in her voice. Instead, she laughed. So Nora tried again. \"I don't even like him, Amy.\" Couldn't she hear how serious Nora was? \"That's beside the point. You don't have to like him for him to turn you on. There's sparks between you guys. A connection.\" She was growing excited now, overtaken with her stupid idea. Her face was eager, and her words were emphasized by her hand movements. \" No .\" \"Why are you denying this? I can see you like him, and I can see he likes you too! So why are you holding back? Are you afraid of getting hurt?\" The sun beat down on Nora's exposed neck, warming her in the heat. She was irritated and pissed off, and she knew she was going to lash out if she didn't calm down. Amy was just trying to help. She looked Amy in the eye, making her voice as no-nonsense and grim as she could. She was attempting to impersonate Agent Jackson, she realized. \"Amy. Stop it. Listen carefully.\" Amy looked at her expectantly, finally giving Nora her complete attention. It made Nora forget what she was going to say, because she had expected to need to make her listen properly before she got to the point. Now, she forgot the point. Amy's blue eyes blinked at her, waiting patiently. \"I don't like Mike.\" Except, she had difficulty swallowing. It confused Nora. It was a familiar feeling, sometimes accompanied by a need to laugh, twitching fingers, or flaring nostrils. It happened when she lied. Nora didn't think she was lying now, though. \"I'm not attracted to Mike.\" Except, that wasn't strictly true. She wished it was, but she did find Mike attractive. How could she not? His broad shoulders, his height, his strength. The way he wore his hair short, just slightly too long to be military-style, with a baseball cap never far from it. The warm brown of his eyes, that could be serious one second and teasing the next. Which could carry a mischievous light as easily as a challenging light. How they could be so focused on something, whether it was the lecturer, the room, the people around him. Or her. Her face, her eyes. \"He doesn't get me hot.\" Being flushed in anger, her heart pounding fast from his challenging eyes and teasing lips, was different to being flushed with arousal. She added this to prove her point, \"I'm flushed in anger, not arousal.\" Amy grinned hugely, and Nora felt suspiciously like a rabbit caught in a cage. \"Tell me Nora, what's a synonym for 'arousal'?\" Nora frowned, shrugging. \"Stimulation. Provocation. Excitement.\" Amy nodded, \"Exactly. Think about that, for a while. You better get to your lecture. It'll be starting in a minute. I'll see you later.\" And Amy walked off, leaving Nora to puzzle her way through Amy's words. She shook her head and headed for the lecture room. So… Tell me. Did you enjoy this chapter? Review replies: Mascota: Hey:) Thanks for reviewing. Again. Haha, I don't mind if you repeat yourself; I'm just glad you are reading this in the first place. The fact that you think the story is taking form and the characters are lovable is just a bonus! Yeah, that's my approximate number of chapters. I plan on making it a long story. Seriously, by the end, you're going to hate me because of all the ups and downs and complications in their relationship! Haha, thanks for subtly reminding me in a PM that I needed to continue this! I'm so stoked you're still enjoying this! Thanks for reviewing and sending me PM's! It's really nice of you, and I'm so glad you're interested in my story :D NGArmyWife: HAHA! You know, I thought I heard something… Haha, thank you for thanking me for the chapter! Glad you liked it! LOL! I know right? I'm like, maybe they could just kiss now and get the whole complications things out of the way straight up…? No? Okay, you're right brain, it is too early for that! Seriously, a very similar discussion to that occurred in my brain as I wrote it, even though I knew it was way, way too early! Good; glad you're going to bear with me! Glad you like the tension ('cuz I kinda like writing it :P), but you're probably never going to find out why Mike was so irritated. But I can tell you! *If you don't want to know, don't read the following* He was irritated partly because Nora said he was the last person she'd be interested in, pretty much, which bugged him, because he's starting to like her, kind of. Which is also irritating him, because he's an 'undercover' agent that's supposed to be around her, and look after her and what not, and nothing else; he's not meant to kinda, sorta, maybe be developing some inklings of feelings for her. and he probably shouldn't enjoy being around her as much as he is, cause we know that'll lead to trouble :P *Answer finished, you may now continue to read*. Anyway, thanks so much for PMing me! That was super, duper sweet of you, and I really appreciate it! (I'm actually ridiculously flattered!) Thanks so much for reviewing. Again. Haha, I hope you liked this chapter! (P.s., I watched P.S. I Love You! It was sooooo sweet and sooo sad! Gah, I just loved him in it!) Koryandrs: Hey again; thanks so much for reviewing both chapter 4 and 5 – it's so sweet of you to take the time to do both of them! I'm glad you liked the dialogue from chapter 4! I had so much fun writing it! It was their first proper, longer, interaction, and I enjoyed writing it, so I'm glad you enjoyed reading it! Okay; you say it ended abruptly, but that it was okay, so did you think I should make some changes to it so it's not so abrupt? Or do you think it's fine the way it is? Thanks so much for letting me know your thoughts about that! Thanks so much for reviewing the way you do; it's so sweet, and I hope you liked this chapter too![Chapter 7] The Soldier of War and the Daughter of Peace Chapter Seven Nora ran until she couldn't feel her legs anymore. Then she ran some more. She wouldn't let Mike beat her. Even if she was getting blisters because she hadn't worn in her new running shoes properly yet. They were killing her. She'd ordered them online, and they were the wrong size. Too big. And it was too late to return them now. She'd just have to deal with it. And Mike was beating her. He glanced behind him, his face slick with sweat. \"You're extra slow today.\" \"Shut up,\" she grunted, irritated. Today might be the day she lost to him. They'd been racing for days now, and each morning she was more and more determined not to let him win. \"I'm still going to – ahh!\" She was abruptly cut off by a tree trunk that had been there for ages. Every morning, they jumped it, and she didn't have a problem with it. Except, this morning, her shoes were too big, and the toe of her running shoe scraped against the rough wood, catching her foot. She jerked forward, her ankle twisting painfully, landing on the ground with a thud. She winced, hissing under her breath, \"Jesus. Jesus Christ. Jesus .\" Her ankle throbbed agonizingly, and she wrapped her hands around it, putting a little pressure on it. Testing it. She hissed again, drawing in a gulp of air. She looked up, sure that Mike would take advantage of her fallen state to keep running, and gain a good lead. And eventually beat her, forcing her off the track. But when she looked up, Mike was looking back at her, frowning as he slowed. He walked back over to her, his face red from the heat and exercise. \"What's wrong?\" Was that…genuine concern? No. It couldn't be. He didn't care about her at all. He was rude and obnoxious to her, so he wouldn't care if she was hurt. But damn, it looked real. And damn, she almost wanted it to be real. She mentally scolded herself for being so ridiculous. But maybe that was because he didn't know she was hurt yet. And she didn't want him to know. She'd be fine in just a second, and he wouldn't even have to know. Nora shook her head dismissively, \"It's nothing. No big deal.\" She tried to stand. That was a mistake. She cried out, collapsing back down to her spot on the ground. How embarrassing. Now he definitely knew she was hurt. She was preparing herself for his teasing and laughter, for him to turn around and win the race, and claim the route, when he knelt down in front of her, his fingers reaching for her ankle. \"What are you doing?\" She asked suspiciously, narrowing her eyes at him. \"Is this the sore one?\" He asked, pulling her right ankle towards him. She watched his hands; his warm fingers prod at the now-swollen skin, inspecting it, completely focused on her ankle, no trace of amusement on his face. She bit her lip. He pulled off her shoe, rotating her ankle around. \"Whoa,\" she said, trying to pull her foot away from him. She didn't want him smelling her feet. They had to smell, enclosed in a shoe while she ran and got sweaty, but he didn't say anything. \"What are you doing?\" He rotated it a certain way and she whistled in a breath, her teeth snapping shut as pain shot up her leg. \"You've sprained it.\" \"Fantastic,\" she grumbled. He stood up and she glared at him. \"Go on, then. Run. Beat me. Take the stupid track, I don't even want it.\" \"Liar,\" he grinned, folding his arms as he looked down at her. Now, there was the amused light in his eyes. She lifted her chin, ignoring his comment, \"Actually, you only need to walk, and you'll beat me back. Go on.\" This was embarrassing. Now, one of the agents was going to have to carry her back to her dorm. She really hoped no one saw. Then again, she was glad she didn't have to hop, or drag herself back. It was times like these when she was glad to have someone else constantly with her. Mike sighed, reaching down for her, \"Come on.\" She leant back, away from his arms. No way. No way was she letting him carry her, for Christ sakes! She'd walk before she let that happen. \"I'm fine. I can walk myself.\" She grabbed the tree trunk, pulling herself up and onto it. She could do this. She could. Mind over matter. It didn't really hurt. Not really. She stood and promptly fell back down. She tried again, glaring at Mike when she saw him suppressing a grin. \"Obviously, you can't,\" he said. \"Yes. I can,\" she said obstinately. She refused to let him carry her. She tried standing again. She only ended up sending bolts of pain up her leg. \"Stop being so stubborn for once, and just let me help. It's not going to kill you.\" \"I beg to differ,\" she replied snarkily. He rolled his eyes, \"So dramatic.\" And before she could stop him, his arms swooped down and picked her up, bridal style. He held her against his chest, warmth radiating from his sweaty body. She swallowed, eyeing the thin sheen covering his exposed neck that was now at her eye level. He started walking forward, heading back to their starting point, outside the park. She squirmed, \"Put me down!\" \"Is that a command, your highness ?\" He grinned down at her, his hands only gripping her tighter. \"No! Yes! Ugh, just put me down!\" She snapped, growing frustrated with his antics. She continued to squirm, trying to make it as difficult as possible for him. She wanted to make him want to put her down and leave her there. \"If you're not careful,\" He said lightly, warningly. \"I'll throw you over my shoulder so your face is near my butt. And imagine what those reporters would write if they got a hold of a picture of that .\" She froze, believing his threat instantly. Oh, that wasn't fair. He knew how to get at her, but she didn't know how to get at him. Her jaw clenched and she folded her arms. \"Fine. Just fine. Be difficult.\" Annoyingly, she was actually quite comfortable in his arms. But as if she'd tell him that. She was unnervingly close to his body; she hadn't been this close since she fell on him on their first run. One arm was wrapped under her bent knees, and the other was under her back, where his hand came around to her stomach, his fingers splaying across the material of her shirt right under her breasts. She didn't know if it was purposeful where his hand was, or if it just happened that way. Either way, she didn't want to call attention to it, and for him to make some smug remark about how she'd like it if he moved his hand just a little higher. She took in a deep breath, to let loose a dramatic sigh that would let him know exactly how she felt about this situation and his warning, when she realized she was close enough to smell him. His scent surrounded her, and she hadn't paid attention to it until then. He smelled like sweat, and under that, very faint, was the deodorant he used. It actually smelled good. Masculine and heady and delicious. And Nora remembered reading an article about pheromones. Androstenol was the scent produced by fresh male sweat, which was attractive to females. Androstenone was the scent produced by male sweat after exposure to oxygen, so it was less fresh, and it was not attractive to females. And she could smell all of it. The fresh sweat mostly overwhelmed the older sweat, but it mixed together with the earthy scent of his deodorant to make a very nice blend that Nora now associated with him. Nora wondered if he knew he smelled good. And she was thinking about this because…? That's right. There was no reason to, what did she care if he smelled deliriously good? She didn't. But just to make sure, she wanted to be certain she wouldn't blurt it out and embarrass herself. So, instead, she said, \"You stink.\" He snorted, \"You don't exactly smell like a whole lot of lavender, either.\" She froze. Lavender…that was what she used. She used fragrances with lavender in them, because she loved the smell of it. Why would he specifically say lavender, why not just generally 'you don't smell so good, either'? Did he know what she usually smelt like? Whoa. Hold up. She was getting carried away here. Both literally and metaphorically. But that was beside the point; she was reading way too much into his comment. Maybe he just liked lavender too, and it was a coincident. She looked up at him, narrowing her eyes and tilting her head to the side. He glanced down at her and sighed, \"What? What now? You've got that suspicious look on your face again. What are you thinking?\" She shook her head, grumbling, \"I like lavender too.\" He nodded, \"I know.\" She raised an eyebrow at him, \"Wow, stalker much? So I was right from the beginning; you are following me.\" He rolled his eyes, \"Why don't you climb down that high pedestal you've put yourself on? The other day, in the Coffee Shop, the air conditioner was blowing it right at me, so of course I smelled it.\" \"Oh.\" See? She snapped at herself. Perfectly reasonable explanation. She had to stop being so suspicious. Mike may not necessarily like her, but that didn't mean she couldn't trust him. Carrying her was a pretty obvious sign that she could. Even if she felt that there was something about Mike he didn't want her to know. Which was ridiculous. He just seemed a little guarded sometimes. She'd say something and he wouldn't respond, and she didn't know why. Or it would take him longer to reply, like he was very carefully composing his response. He was an enigma. He lifted her up higher to get a better grip on her, jostling her, and knocking her out of her musings. She grinned up at him, \"Getting heavy yet?\" She looked at him hopefully, \"Do you need to put me down?\" \"No,\" he said easily. He wasn't panting from running anymore, and his breathing wasn't short and hurried. He looked completely at ease, carrying her weight as easily as he would a feather. Which was just ridiculous. He grinned at her, \"You looked deep in thought. So I wanted to disturb you.\" \"You're such a jerk.\" \"Hey,\" he teasingly admonished. \"This jerk is carrying you.\" \"I certainly didn't ask you to – hang on a second. Where are we going?\" She asked quickly. They'd finally made it out of the trees, but instead of going left, in the direction of her dorm, they were going right, in the direction Mike usually came from. \"The health services center of this college,\" he said, like it was obvious. \"Or did you forget that you sprained your ankle? Kind of the reason I'm carrying you,\" he pointed out. She sighed, \"I know. I just thought I could not go to see a doctor.\" \"You need someone to take a look at it,\" he said. \" You did,\" Nora said hopefully. \"A doctor needs to take a look at it,\" he said firmly. Then he grinned slyly, \"Are you afraid of doctors?\" \"Of course not,\" she said snootily, lifting her chin and looking away. It was early morning, so there weren't many people around at all. The ones who were, stared. Of course. But Nora looked around at her surroundings rather than look up at Mike. \"They just…put me on edge.\" \"They put you on edge,\" he repeated slowly, grinning down at her like she'd given him a lollipop and he had a serious sweet tooth. \"So, in other words; you're afraid of them.\" He laughed, and she jabbed her elbow into his sternum. He let out a mumbled 'oof', and promptly stopped laughing. \"Huh. I don't know why I didn't think of this earlier.\" \"I will leave you here,\" he warned, gesturing with his head at the dirty cement walkway. \"I wish you would,\" Nora replied, looking up at him and waiting expectantly. They glared at each other. \"You know what?\" He asked rhetorically. \"I feel like going for a little stroll. Through the middle of the campus and then around to the health services building. What do you think?\" She continued to glare, \"You wouldn't.\" Damnit, he knew how to get to her. She didn't want him to be carrying her, and she certainly didn't want people to see it. She didn't want people to photograph it. She didn't want people to report about it in the paper. She just wanted to see a god damn doctor so she could get back to her dorm room. He raised his eyebrows, \"I would.\" \" Fine ,\" Nora snapped. \"Fine. I'll be good.\" \"Great.\" She hated his smug grin. He carried her all the way to the building, placed her down on a chair in the waiting room, then went to speak to a nurse behind the front reception desk. She immediately folded her arms across her chest in irritation. She didn't need his help. She could do it herself. But…she appreciated it. Which was what was really bugging her. She didn't want to like the way he'd put her down gently, so she wouldn't fall off the chair, or hurt herself. She didn't want to like the way he just did it, either. Or the way he just went to speak to the nurse for her. And she didn't want to have to owe Mike anything. He finished speaking to the nurse, and went over to sit next to Nora, \"A doctor will see you soon.\" \"Thanks,\" she said, begrudgingly. He rolled his eyes, \"You're welcome.\" He leant back in the chair, folding his arms and trying to get comfortable despite the chairs being made of plastic, hard, and with no cushioning. She frowned at him. He could go now. He didn't have to stick around. He didn't have to be here. But he settled in, looking ready to wait as long as it took. She continued to frown. She was curious how long he'd stick it out before he got bored or irritated with her. Less than ten minutes later, the nurse walked around to them to get their attention so they could follow her into the right room. \"Doctor Penn will see you now.\" Mike stood, and scooped Nora up before she could even think about how she was going to get to the room. He didn't say anything as he carried her in, and she mumbled, \"Thank you.\" She could've sworn she saw the nurse make an 'awww' face at Mike as he went into the doctors room. So now there was a nurse in love with him. She frowned, because she wasn't sure how she felt about that. So… What did you think? I'm having too much fun making them dance around each other, but don't worry. Nora will realize she loves him soon enough! Anywho, guess what?! I'm leaving for a holiday to Vanuatu tomorrow! I'm so excited, but unfortunately for you guys enjoying this, it means it'll be a while until I update! Sorry!

Also not sure how long it takes to get from Orlando to the FBI field office, so if timing is off, I'm sorry. Orlando airport, Holly grabbed her suitcase and walked outside to the taxi rank. Holly slid into the taxi. \"Where to miss?\" the taxi driver asked \"FBI field office, please,\" Holly said her stomach full of butterflies. \"Cool, do you work for the FBI?\" the taxi driver asked. \"No, I'm going to meet my father,\" Holly nervously spoke. \"Alright miss,\" the taxi driver said. \"First time in Florida?\" he asked. \"Yeah, first time out of New York,\" Holly said digging through her bag. \"Trust me miss, you'll fall in love with Florida,\" the taxi driver said happily drumming his fingers on the steering wheel. An hour later, I walked into the reception area at the FBI. \"Good morning Miss, can I help you?\" the receptionist asked. \"I'm Holly Hart, I'm looking for Agent Eric Matthews,\" Holly said. \"I'm sorry miss but unless you are an agent or a witness, I can't grant you visitors permission,\" the receptionist said smiling at Holly. \"I'm his teenage daughter, he hasn't seen me in a couple of years and I wanted to surprise him,\" Holly said.

Eric's face went white. \"Look kids, I'm not interested in selling my story about my relationship with agent Hart. You have to contact the New York field office if you want her autograph,\" Eric snapped. \"I don't need her autograph,\" Holly snapped back. \"Let me guess, you already have it,\" Eric sarcastically said. \"Agent Matthews, I don't need her signature because Grace Hart is my mother and according to her and my birth certificate, you're my father,\" Holly said looking into her father's eyes.

If you're wondering why the updates are taking so long, blame my teachers. I finish all my homework and then they give me a pile more! Plus on top of that I start my exams in a couple of weeks! Hopefully, I'll be ok, so that means updates will be rare until the end of July! Sorry! Anyway in this chapter, we're going to see both Eric's reaction and Gracie's when she finds out where Holly actually is! At the end will be a preview of chapter four, so enjoy! Previously: \" Agent Matthews, I don't need her signature because Grace Hart is my mother and according to her and my birth certificate, you're my father,\" Holly said looking into her father's eyes. Now… \"I don't have a daughter,\" Eric stated. \"My birth certificate has your name on it, Agent Matthews,\" Holly said holding up the birth certificate. \"Let me see that,\" Eric said taking the birth certificate off Holly and holding it up to the light. \"It's not fake,\" Holly snapped. Eric handed her back the certificate and stared at her, before speaking. \"It doesn't mean you're my daughter, Hart could have got it got it wrong,\" Eric said trying to convince himself as well as Holly. \"Agent Matthews, my mother didn't get it wrong. You're the only guy she has though about in the last seventeen years,\" Holly admitted. Eric sighed, before moving to the computer and began typing. \"If your searching for me, I'm in there,\" Holly said referring to the database Eric was searching. After a couple of minutes of reading, Eric looked at Holly. \"This is a complete shock,\" Eric muttered, his eyes not leaving Holly's. \"I understand. I shouldn't have come. I'm sorry,\" Holly sadly acknowledged as she picked up her bag and began walking out of the office. Eric leapt out of his seat. \"Holly, wait!\" he called as he caught her arm. \"What?\" she asked spinning around to face Eric, who saw her brown eyes brimming with tears. \"Where are you going?\" Eric asked. \"The motel, then I'm going to book my flight home,\" Holly coldly said. \"You mean Hart isn't here with you?\" Eric asked. \"No, mom is on an undercover operation back home, so I came on my own,\" Holly proudly announced. Eric groaned. \"Let me guess Hart doesn't know you're here?\" \"She thinks I'm staying at my friend's house and my friend thinks the operation was cancelled, meaning I wouldn't have to stay there,\" Holly explained. Eric scoped up his jacket, before placing a hand on Holly's elbow. \"Come with me.\" \"Where are we going?\" Holly asked. Eric led Holly over to a desk where a man was sitting, reading a report. \"Matt, if you see Greg, tell him I'm not feeling well and I've gone home,\" Eric informed Matt. Matt looked at Holly, a smile appearing on his lips. \"She's a bit young for you isn't she? Me, on the other hand-\" \"Matt, this is my daughter, Holly,\" Eric said protectively pushing Holly behind him, ready to punch Matt if he came near Holly. \"She's a cute little thing,\" Matt said with a suggestive grin over Eric's shoulder at Holly, who in return rolled her eyes. \"Excuse us,\" Eric said glaring at Matt, before he wrapped an arm around Holly's shoulders and leading her out of the building. Eric's apartment, Eric heard his daughter singing in the shower, he took her cell phone off the side, scrolled down her address book until he found the number he was looking for. He then placed the phone to his ear and waited for the person on the other end to pick it up. New York City, Gracie Hart stared at the view from her window of the safe-house she was in. She missed Holly so much; she hated being away from her. Suddenly her cell phone rang. She took it out of her pocket and saw Holly's name flashing across the screen and answered it. \"Holly, what's wrong?\" Hart's voice floated down the phone and into Eric's ear. Eric sighed. She still sounded the same as she did when he last spoke to her, seventeen years ago. \"Holly?\" Hart's voice called, snapping him back to reality. \"Hello Hart,\" Eric said \"Eric?\" Gracie asked shocked. \"Yeah, it's me, Hart. Why didn't you tell me about Holly?\" Eric asked. \"How did you know?\" Hart asked sitting down. \"She's here.\" \"Is she o.k.? Is she safe?\" Hart asked going into protective mother mode. \"Hart, she's fine. She's in the shower.\" \"If she's in your way, send her back home,\" Hart snapped. \"This isn't about her being in my way Hart! This is about not knowing I had a daughter for half of my life! Why didn't you tell me?\" Eric shouted. \"Because I didn't want her to get hurt,\" Hart sadly said. \"What's that suppose to mean?\" Eric asked, noticing how the tone had changed in Gracie's voice. \"I think you know,\" Hart bitterly said. \"I'll send someone to pick her up.\" \"Gracie, I know your undercover for the next two weeks, why don't you let me take care of Holly?\" Eric offered. \"What? Can you afford precious time away from your social calendar?\" Hart sarcastically asked. \"I'll make the time, please let me look after Holly and get to know her,\" Eric begged. Gracie sighed; maybe this was the right thing to do for Holly, maybe she would finally come out of her shell. \"Fine, Holly can stay with you while I finish this operation, but I swear to god Matthews, if you hurt her, I will kick your ass,\" Hart warned. \"I won't hurt her, I promise,\" Eric happily said. \"You better not, tell Holly to call me.\" \"I will, goodnight Hart,\" Eric said. \"Night Matthews,\" Hart said hanging up. \"Hart, what's wrong?\" Fuller asked. \"It's Holly,\" Grace said looking at her cell phone. \"She o.k.?\" Fuller asked. \"She's in Florida,\" Grace said stunned. \"What is she doing in Florida?\" Fuller asked confused \"She went to find Eric,\" Grace quietly said. \"Oh my,\" Fuller said. \"Are you o.k. with her being there?\" \"Not really, but this may be the opportunity Eric needs to have a relationship with Holly and for Holly to understand how much Eric is an unfit father.\" \"Hart, do you still have feelings for Matthews?\" Fuller asked. \"No… maybe… It was a long time ago.\" AN: So, possible feelings may be brewing to the surface again. Will Hart and Eric ever make up? How will Eric cope with Holly? Here is a preview of chapter 4. Holly opened the door to find a five foot 6 inches, blonde hair woman standing there. She eyed Holly up and down before deciding she was no threat. \"Hey, I'm looking for Eric? Is he home?\" Holly shouted over her shoulder. \"Eric, someone is here to see you!\" \"Be right out!\" Eric replied. \"So, who are you?\" the girl asked. Holly was about to speak, when Eric came over. \"Jennifer, good to see you again,\" he said with a fake smile plastered on his face. \"Who is she?\" Jennifer asked. \"My niece, Holly,\" Eric quickly said. Holly rolled her eyes before picking up her bag. \"Where are you going? Eric asked watching Holly walk out the door. Holly spun around to face Eric and Jennifer. \"Don't worry about me, uncle Eric,\" Holly spat. \"I'll get out your hair for a couple of hours.\" Eric watched as his daughter disappeared from sight. AN: So tension already! What will Eric do? Where will Holly go and who will she meet. Also a phone conversation with Hart and a surprise visitor awaits in the next chapter. So hit the review button.

I guess if I startnanywhere, it should be from the beginning. The year was June 14,n1992… Itnwas a cool, dark, and stormy night, in the summer of June 1992.Thenrain gently fell against the metal tin roof, the moon was hiddennbehind large black clouds, that didn't seem to go away. Lightningnflashed constantly but the thunder did not echo. The quite youngnfamily of five slept soundly in their beds except for Emily, thenmother, was down stairs in the kitchen at this time of the nightnfinishing the dishes. The lightning flashed and the thunder rollednfor once. \"Mommy!\"na loud shriek came from up the steps. Emily ran up the steps and halfnway up the steps embraced the young boy. She picked up the littlenbrown, hair blue eyed boy. \"Mommy,ndon't let them get me, please!\" \"Don'tnlet who get you?\" Emily said as she wiped the tears away fromnthe little boys face. \"Thenmonkeys, mommy, they were chasing me!

She hit him as she said, \"you know where to get me at,ndon't you?\" \"Yep,\"nhe gave her a kiss on the cheek, \"uh oh, I think we woke someonenelse up!\" a knock indicated that someone else was woke up. \"Comenin.\" \"Mommy,ncan I come in?\" \"Whynnot?\" Elizabeth wasna tall girl for her age all the children were many years apart. Bennwas three years old, next was Matthew who was five years old, andnElizabeth wasnseven years old. The parents Larry and Emily were fours yearsndifferent also, Larry is 26 and Emily is 22. Larry was a tall kind ofnchubby man with brown hair and a goatee. Now Emily was a short, railnthin, up topped kind of woman with blond hair and has green eyes.

The door flew open and the dog came running innthrough the room with a blast of wind. \"Percy!nSit!\" Ben stood up and pointed his finger witch meant you hadnbetter listen to me! The puppy started to slide and hit the bed. Henjumped up on the bed where the family sat. \"OkaynPercy, get down.\" Larry pushed the Saint Bernard off the bed. Anknock on the door indicated that the last of the children was up \"Comenon in Matt.\" The cute little blond haired, sleepy blue-eyed boynentered the room. \"Mommynwhat's going on? Why is everyone awake?\" he crawled on the bednand in Emily's lap. \"Thensame thing you are doing up. Can't sleep\" \"Mommy,ncan you sing us a song?\" Ben said as Larry placed him in Emily'snlap. Ben was in Emily's lap, and Matt was in Larry's and Elizabethnlaidnacross on Larry and Emily's lap. \"Okaynwhat do you want me to sing?\" Elizabethnsatnup and mentioned the song. \"Thensong you use to sing to me when I was Ben's age!\" Emily thoughtnabout it a moment. \"Shenwas born in a place called BluenValley atnthe foot of the Tennesseenhills withnthe blue birds and blue bells and blue mountain water, and thensound of the blue whippoorwills \"she moved Ben to her shoulder. \"Butnthere was no peace in the valley her daddy, a cruel, ruthlessnman Used and abused her mind and her body so her mama said runnwhile you can,\" she looked around the room trying to regain thenwords to the song. Larry looked at her and smiled.

Do mommy's and daddy's cry?\" \"Yesndarlin, in their own way, they do cry, and her name was Dolly Parton\"nshe looked at Larry and back down at the child laid across her lap,nshe played with his soft hair, gently as she sang the rest. \"Sonat fifteen she took to the highway Belongings and guitar innhand And she buried herself in her music The one thing she didnunderstand And she sings like a bird and she writes like anpoet Her voice has that high, lonesome sound She hurts, and hernsongs are the best way to show it So the Blue Valley songbirdnkeeps traveling around\" Larry looked at Emily and just smiled,nthe woman that didn't even want the little girl she had carried asna teenager, fell in love with her children as they were born. \"Shenhopes someday she will make it And everyone says that shenwill When she comes to town, crowds flock around To see thengirl from the Tennessee hills She writes her letter back home tonher mama In care of the preacher in town They're sacred to hernso she reads them at church And so her daddy cannot track herndown.\" Larry and Emily could not believe she remembered as muchnas she did. Therefore, they finished the chorus, as it was suppose tonbe. \"Andnshe sings like a bird and she cries like a baby whenever she turnsnoff the lights she's a whole lot lonesome and a little bitncrazy from mem'ries and miseries and dreams gone awry.

Larryntook Matt and placed him in his room, then grabbed Ben and placed himnin the crib. When Larry got back from putting Matt down simplynslipped into Ben's room one more time where Emily sat holdingnElizabeth innher lap. Larry gently picked Elizabethnupnand threw her over his shoulder gently. \"Larrynplease, becareful, don't wake her.\" Larry looked her in the eyesnand gave her an \"I know what I am doing\" look. \"Inwill it took forever to get her asleep.\" Larry and Emily walkednaround the big oval hallway, and into Elizabeth's room. They placednher in the twin sized canopy bed, and as Larry did so, Emily held hernhead so it would not hit the headboard. Emilynslipped out of the room and went to Ben's room to make sure he wasnstill asleep. She quietly turned on his night light. Emily looked atnher young son and pushed back gently his brown hair from his eye's,nand kissed his forehead. \"Mommy,ncan I have a cookie, and some milk?\" Emily looked in the doorwaynand saw Larry standing there. \"Nonsweetie, not at this time of the night, but I can get you a glass ofnapple juice and a cracker if your hungry.\" Ben's nose crinklednup in a \"that's nasty look.\" Emilynheard the half-asleep voice of the child, as she turned the radionslightly on. \"Thanknyou mommy.\" Emily smiled as she made her very past Larrynstanding in the doorway. Emilynwalked down the spiral staircase. Her robe draped behind her, and hernhand stayed on the rail. She wore a black, lace robe that was anlittle big for her short body; you could hear the clanking of hernhigh heels on the wooden steps. Shenwalked into the kitchen and opened the cupboard; she stood on herntiptoes trying to reach for a sippy cup. She mumbled under her breathnabout being short, as she rinsed out the sippy cup and poured applenjuice into the green and blue cup. She once again opened and reachednin the cupboard this time to grab a bag of \"chips ahoy\"ncookies. She took off her high heels to go up the stairs quietly andnlooked across the hall to make sure Larry was not at the doorway. Shenwalked into the room and noticed that Ben was still awake. \"NownI will only give this to you, if you don't tell your papa.\"nBen's eyes lit up. She pulled two cookies from behind her back. \"Cookies!nThank you mama!\" \"Shh,ndon't tell anybody now, this is mine, and yours secrete.\" \"Really,nonly mine and yours?\" \"Yep,nsorry honey there was no milk.\" \"It'snokay, thank you mommy.\" \"Nonproblem sweetie, good night.\" \"Goodnightnmommy, I love you.\" \"Lovenyou too bud.\" Itnwas around three o'clockninnthe morning by the time they got all the kids in the bed, and asleep,nEmily lay there still, and awake. \"Honey,nyou awake?\" \"Yeah,nwhy?\" He asked putting his arm around her waist. She let out andeep sigh, and turned to look at him. \"Wellnwatching the kids tonight, and putting them to sleep, and doing justnabout everything else we did has me thinking...\" \"What?nWhat could bother you?\" Emily stood up hoping that the words shenwas trying to say would just spew out of her mouth. A long drawn outnpause indicated she was nervous. \"WellnI am just hungry, that's all. Therefore, I think that I am going tongo get a snack.\" Shenput on her robe and walked back to the kitchen, she grabbed an applenfrom the refrigerator and rinsed it off and started peeling it in onenlong, curly, strip. \"Emily?\"nshe turned around to see Larry in the doorway. \"What'sngoing on? Something is different from usual.\" Emily smiled as ifnnothing was wrong. \"Wellnsomeone called me today.\" \"Reallynwho?\" Emily turned to see a young Child's shadow. \"Matt!\" \"Matt?\"nshe walked into the living room. \"Matt,nwhat are you doing up?\" \"Inheard people talking and…\" \"But...\" \"Butnwhat?\" \"Whatnwere y'all talking about?\" \"I'llntell you later, let's get you up to bed.\" \"Oh,nOK.\" Emily placed the toddler in the bed. She closed the door,nand sat on the bed. \"Okaynyour father is going to kill me for telling you first… but I got anphone call from the doctor today...\" \"What'snwrong?\" \"Well,nmommy is going to have a baby.\" \"Nonway! Who knows? When are you going to tell him?\" \"Shh,nI told you not to say anything.\" She tucked him in and went backnto the bedroom. Larry brought her apple and her glass of apple juicenback up to their room. \"Sonwho called you?\" he said handing her, her apple. \"Wellnit was just someone in the medical field.\" \"Okayna doctor. What about it?\" just then the alarm went off. \"Inam going to get the kids!\" Emily jumped off the bed. \"Getnthe kids in the nursery. Stay there until I come back. I mean it!\" \"Larrynbecareful please!\" \"Inpromise.\" Emily went into Elizabeth's room... \"Mama!nWhat's going on?\" Elizabeth's face was wet from the tears. Emilynpicked Elizabeth upnand took her to the nursery on the on other side of Emily's room. \"Shh,nsweetheart just stay calm everything is going to be fine.\" Emilynstroked the young girl's hair trying to calm her down. Lightningnflashed in the distance to reveal the shaken and scared look on antrue mother's face. \"NownI am going to go get Ben and Matt and I will be right back. Do notnopen this door unless I tell you too.\" \"Mama?nWhere is papa?\" Elizabethnaskednas Emily started out the door. Startled Emily answered in the bestnway she could, \"He'snfine.\" Thunder echoed the lightning as Emily made her waynaround. Elizabeth letnout a terrified scream, \"Mama!\" Emily ran around the longnand oval hallway her casting shadows on the wall that made her heartnbeat faster and the pounding in her head was almost unbearable. Asnshe moved quickly and quietly towards her screaming children, \"Ben\"nshe cried as she picked him up and ran back into the nursery, wherenElizabeth satnin a fetal position. The two children cried and begged their mothernnot to leave them as she ran to save the last of the children, butnwhen Emily got there Matt was nowhere to be found. Emily could hearnyelling and fighting in the living room. \"Mommy!nHelp Mommy!\" Emily could hear matt's cry. She could feel thisnvery uncertain feeling in her stomach like something is going wrong,nshe took her heels off as she slowly came around to the edge of thensteps. Emily made her way swiftly across the long landing and downnthe winding and open staircase, as she reached the corner thenstruggle in the next room became apparent there was an unannouncednshot, which took her by surprise as it embedded its self in the wallna fraction from her head \"Ohnshit!\" Emily looked through the kitchen; the expression on hernface matched the face of the little boy who was being held to thenground against his will. \"Mamanhelp!\" Emily saw a tall man standing in the kitchen doorway. Shengrabbed the knife that was on the counter from the apple, which notnjust minutes ago, was being peeled, the man who was holding Mattnturned around and noticed that something was unusual and odd aboutnthe room. Out of the corner of Larry's eye, he noticed Emilyncreeping up from behind the Islandntable. \"Emily!nGet back upstairs! Don't get into this!\" Larry begged as henfought off the person who had him pined to the ground. \"EmilynI know about the baby! Just go upstairs!\" Emily felt a presencenof somebody behind her. \"Emily!nLook out!\" she turned around and the tall man grabbed her arm, shentook her other hand and grabbed hold of the knife on the counter. Anblast of determination went through Emily's body and she felt ansharp pain in her side yet she knew what she had to do to keep hernboys safe. Emilynwent behind the man holding her arm and turned around to face him shenplaced the point of the knife to his back hard enough that onenslightest movement would or could kill him. \"Nownget up, don't move, and call this shit off, and you just might benable to keep you insides.\" with a scattered breath he yellednout, \"Alright guys, let's get out of here!\" they allnscattered and left the boy where he was. Lightning struck and thundernsounded as the very last man stood in the doorway of the house as henquoted, \"All I am going to say is this is not the end of this.\"nThe last man slammed the door closed. Emily took the knife and cutnthe ropes from Matt's arms and legs. \"Mama,nPapa!\" Matt wiped the tears out of his mama's eyes and sweatnfrom his daddy's face. They both embraced Matt. \"Nownwhy couldn't you tell me you were pregnant?\" \"Indidn't know how, I was afraid you didn't want another child.\" \"IfnI could I would want twelve. We got the space...\" they allnlooked around and started laughing. The smile that came acrossnEmily's face was unbelievable. Larry's lip was busted and bleeding. \"Let'sngo put some ice on that hand and that lip.\" Larry took her handnand helped her to her feet. He noticed closely that something wasnwrong. \"Emily,nyour side is bleeding.\" she looked down and placed her handnwhere the bloodstain covered her clothing, her knees gave way andnLarry kept his tight grip on her gently lowering her to the ground. \"Matt,ngo get some towels out of the closet now!\" \"No,nI want to stay right here with mama!\" \"Matt!nNo! Please go!\" Matt sulked. \"Matt,nson, I am so sorry! I promise she will be fine.\" Matt rannupstairs and into the closet where they kept the colored towels fromnwhere they washed the dog. WhilenMatt was upstairs, Larry raised her shirt up to see what caused hernside to bleed. \"Damn,nhow did that happen?\" Larry pulled on the knife blade that wasnin her side. Emily groaned and gritted her teeth. \"Larrynstop!\" Emily yelled. \"Shh.nIt is okay. Just let me get it out.\" \"Nonstop!\" Larry had to get it out he just didn't know how. Mattnhurriedly stumbled down the stairs with a stack of unfolded towels.nLarry pulled down her shirt. Elizabethnanlittle shaken and nervous stumbled down the stairs. \"Papa?nWhat can I do to help?\" \"Sweetpea,ncall me an ambulance and keep Ben upstairs okay?\" Aboutn20 minutes later, the ambulance arrived. \"Honey,nI'll be there as soon as I can.\" He kissed her forehead. Aboutnan hour later, Emily's friend Sarah came over to watch the kids.nLarry left, but some hours later, the news turned horrible.[Chapter 2] Newsnbroadcast Larrynran into the emergency room. \"Mynwife came in Emily Johnson.\" \"So\" \"Cannyou tell me how she is?\" \"Indon't know!\" Larry grabbed the clipboard and walked into thenwaiting room. Larry sat down and waited for the doctor to come withnsome news. \"Mr.nJohnson,\" Larry stood up. \"Arenyou Mr. Johnson?\" \"YesnI am. How is she doing? Tell me straight up.\" \"Wellnhonestly, if you want the straight up, if you wouldn't have messednwith the knife blade it would have cut her lungs in half, she wouldnhave died. She did loose the baby.\" Larry's face went blank, hisnheart sank and he began to feel real heavy inside, almost like he hadnlost his best friend. \"Ohnman, I don't know how to tell her. How many weeks was the baby?\"nthe doctor looked through his notes. \"Anmonth old. I am so sorry.\" \"Intold her to go back upstairs, she didn't listen.\" \"Wellnit's not your fault nor is it hers the whole deal is she felt thenmotherly instincts and just went for it. You can go see her if younwant, she is in the third room on the right.\" \"Thanknyou.\" Larry would never forget the face of that doctor. Emilynalways sees all the angels around this world; she showed Larry how tondo the same. Larry got to the door and knocked upon it. \"Comenin!\" Larry opened the door. \"Hey!\" \"Heynsweetheart.\" Larry walked in and gave her a kiss. \"Younstay in this place don't you?\" Emily laughed. Her face went fromnrelaxed to serious, and very concerned. \"Honeyncan I ask you a question?\" Emily sat up, almost unable to dealnwith the pain and her face showed it. \"Yeahnsure, you sure you need to be sitting up. Do you need anything?\"nEmily shook her head \"no.\" and resumed talking, \"I amnalright, Larry, how is the baby?\" Larry's head looked down tonthe floor. Emily took his chin in her hands, so she could look him innthe eyes. Larry tried to look back down but she held her hand firm. \"Larry,nplease tell me.\" She said as she grabbed his hands. \"Well,nsweetheart, we can always try again if you want.\" Emily shooknher head in agreement. \"Butnwhat are we gonna tell Matt?\" \"Wenwill figure that out when we get there.\" \"Darlin',nwill you go get me something to drink please?\" \"Yeahnsure, what do you want?\" \"Water.\" \"Okay,nI will be back in 5 minutes.\" Emily nodded. \"Thanknyou\" \"Anythingnto make you smile.\" A smile came across her face. Larry walkednout and the door shut. Emily cried, she had kept her hurt in untilnnobody was around, like always. Thoughts of, as if \"what did Indo wrong, and why did this happen to me?\" flooded her mind.nLarry ran back in the room for he could hear her cries outside thendoor. He ran over and held her close as her tears drowned hernbeautiful smooth face. \"Honey,ndon't even think about it, you did nothing wrong. You were just atnthe wrong place at the wrong time. Let me see those stitches.\"nShe rolled over to her left side and her looked at them closely. \"Damn,n29?\" Emily slightly smiled, \"Oh, honey I am so sorry.\"nHe embraced her, she just cried, \"You want to watch the news, ornsee who is in the top charts in country music.\" \"No,nright now no news is good news. I knew something was wrong I couldnfeel it you might think that is crazy but when that man grabbed mynarm there was this... I dunno there was this pain in my side, thenkind I felt on the floor.\" Another knock came upon the largenwooden door. The doctor came in. \"Mr.nJohnson, may I please talk to you.\" \"Yeahnsure, I'll be right back.\" Larry wanted to make sure that shenknew he wasn't going to leave her. Larry followed the doctor out ofnthe room. \"What'snwrong?\" \"Indon't know how to tell you this, but your son has been taken from thenhouse.\" \"What?\" \"Whonever did this to your wife wanted to just get you both out of thenhouse. Whoever was in your house before was just trying to get younout of the house.\" Larry's face turned as white as a ghost. \"Damnnit, can you tell Emily I will be back as soon as I can?\" \"Yes,nsir.\" \"Whatevernyou do don't turn on the news or tell her why.\" The doctornnodded and he and Larry went their separate ways. Thendoctor once again knocked on the door. \"Mrs.nJohnson, your husband had to go home for a while, but will be backnsoon.\" \"Why?\" \"Ma'am,nI am not allowed to say.\" Emily leaned back confused. \"Sir,ncan you bring me the TV remote?\" \"Um…nthe TV is not working.\" \"OKncan you bring me a bible?\" \"Nownthat I can do.\" \"Thanknyou so much.\" The doctor walked out of the room. Emily felt likenshe had the word (ASS) on her forehead. For the first time since shenwas married, she felt alone. However, something in her heart told hernsomething was wrong. She pressed the call button. \"Nursesnstation, how may I help you?\" \"Yesncan you please tell me what is going on in the local news?\" \"Yes,num a five year old boy was abducted from his home.\" \"Thanknyou,\" it took a couple of seconds for it to hit Emily. Handsnshaking Emily called Larry. \"Hello?\" \"Larrynwhat the hell is going on? Is Matt okay?\" \"Whatndo you mean?\" \"Somethingntells me something is wrong with Matt.\" \"Hasnanybody told you?\" \"No,nI want to know now!\" \"Mattnis gone! The same people who tried this before did it again.\" \"WhynMatt? What did he do?\" \"Well,nthey took his book bag; look as soon as I get done with the policenhere I will be right back there.\"[Chapter 3] On the tour again Onnthe tour again AfternMatt's disappearance, Emily went into a stage of depression. Emilynwould try to hide the hurt she felt and she would always put on anfront just so her family and fans would not see, but after a yearnEmily finally snapped. Emilynwould get so depressed that she would go without food for days at antime and then eat like a hog after she practically starved herself.nMost of the time Emily would lock herself in her \"Music Room,\"nand at night she would stay up and look out the window in some hopenthat she was in a nightmare and that any minute she would see Mattnwalking up the driveway. WhennLarry would insist that one of Emily's friends should come over, orneven her parents Emily would get mad and walk out or sit out on thenporch for hours. Larry decided that a psychologist was not thenanswer, but what was? Larrynfinally got the courage to go and talk to Emily, talk about what wasnwrong. Larry walked upstairs and up to the door of the \"MusicnRoom,\" Larry took a breath and knocked on the door. \"Emily,ncan I come in a minute?\" no answer came from the other side of thendoor. Larry opened the door to reveal Emily sitting at the piano, hernhead was slightly hung down and the look of grieve filled her emeraldneye's. \"Heynsweetie, can I sit here?\" Larry asked pointing to the empty spotnbeside her. Emily slightly nodded her head yes. AsnLarry sat beside her, he asked her another question, \"can I ask youna question?\" once again Emily nodded her head. Larry reached fornher hand, but she moved it, as if telling him \"don't touch me.\" \"Howncan I help ease your pain? I know it's there, what's worse isnthat the kids know it's there. So just tell me how I can help you.\"nEmily slightly startled looked at him and let out a sigh. \"Larry,nthere is nothing you can, or anyone for that matter can do. I justnhave that sense that even though people are around me, I still feelnalone. So why be around people when you still feel alone? Larry it isna scary for me because never in my life have I felt alone.\" Larrynput his arm around her waist, Larry could feel that Emily was uneasynabout his arm being around her, so he removed his arm and took hernhand instead which was easier for her. \"Honey,nno matter what ever happens to any of us we will all be here forneveryone because we are a family who loves each other. Emily nonmatter what you face you are never alone and you know that. Can I asknyou just one more question?\" Emily tried to hold back that thentears that welled up in her pain stricken eyes, and nodded. \"Inknow neither of us has said a word about the day Matt was kidnappednand I feel maybe it wouldn't hurt to just talk about it andnunderstand each other's feelings better.\" Emily blurted out; shenhad held it back long enough. \"LarrynI had never been more scared in my life! I didn't know what to do!nI didn't and still don't know who they were but I think I knewnwhy they wanted him.\" Larry tilted his head to the side confused. \"Itnwas all because he was \"Liana Reed's\" child. I just pray thatnhe was just sold to a childless family who would take good care ofnhim and see that he is missing and bring him home.\" Larry looked atnEmily with complete understanding, Emily began to cry, and Larry justnheld her close. \"Sweetie,nI understand completely and I think you have a good scenario aboutnthis whole thing, but you don't need to think it was your faultnbecause it wasn't. You wanna know something? I don't thinknanything more could have scared me more that night than to see youncollapse in the middle of the floor, or the way you looked when youncrept from around the island. That's what hurt me the most, not thenblack eye or the busted lip, but you and Matt.\" Larry looked aroundnthe \"Music Room\" and saw pictures of the kids and Emily and Larrynjust fooling around. These pictures lined the wall. \"Larrynwhat hurt me the worst was the fact we lost two children, even thoughnI was only a month pregnant I could still feel that I was pregnant.\" \"YeahnI know what you mean. I knew what you were trying to tell me you werenpregnant before you went down stairs.\" Surprised Emily looked atnhim with that \"you sly thing\" look. \"Whyndidn't you tell me?\" foolishly Larry replied, \"I wanted to seenhow far you would go before you told me.\" Emily's mouth droppednand she gave him a frustrated hit on the arm. Emily stood up andnwalked around the room, looking at the pictures on the wall. \"HeynEmily, let me tell you a secrete my mom told me… come here and sitnon my lap.\" Emily let out a smile for the first time in months andnshe sat on his lap. \"What?\" \"Wellnyou gotta come closer than that.\" Emily leaned in a little bitncloser. \"Itnis ok to cry when you feel like it. No one is going to think you arenweek because you cry, it just means your hurt. I want you to let itnout when you feel like it and I am always going to be here to be yournshoulder to cry on.\" Emily nodded. \"Onenlast thing.\" \"What?\" \"Comenjust a little closer, as close as you feel like.\" Emily let hernhead fall to his shoulder. \"Inlove you, and I always will.\" Larry kissed her cheek. Emily turnednher head around to face him; she placed her arms around his neck andnpassionately kissed him back. Something'sndid go back to normal and some things stayed the same. Emily'sneating habits went back to normal and she started touring again. Onenthing that stayed the same with a small change was Emily's lack ofncorrect sleep. Emily would go to bed when Larry would, but in thenmiddle of the night Emily would sleepwalk to the window and justnstand there looking for Matt. If Larry would notice that she wouldnget up he would either try helping her back to bed or he would put anchair by the window. Aboutna month after she grew slowly better Emily started back touring, itnseemed like every time Emily would do a different act in a on a stagenshe would always look out in the audience just to see if she couldnfind Matt, just by some chance. Onenweek Emily was on tour heading down and over to North Carolina, wherenshe was suppose to meet up with her niece Taylor. Taylornwasna tall girl, with straight brown hair that comes down to the bottomnof her chin. Taylor tries her best to match up with her Aunt Rebecca;nTaylor wears the same kind of clothes, same kind, and amount ofnmake-up as Emily and loves to sing just like Emily and Sarah-Lynn whonat one time sang with Emily in a bluegrass group. WellnEmily was standing off stage waiting to get her cue to come on;nEmily's nerves were so bad that she could barely breathe. WellnEmily being so determined to be out there she went on as planned. AsnEmily heard the crowd's applause and the chanting of her name, shenlooked out in the audience and saw a boy who looked just like Mattnand was his same age on this tall man's shoulders who Emilynsupposed was to be his dad. Emily's face went as white as a ghostnas she mouthed the word \"Matt.\" Taylornpushednthrough the audience to get to Emily in enough time. As Taylornreachednthe stage, Emily took one-step and fell out. \"AuntnLiana!\" Taylor rannup on the stage followed by two paramedics. Emilynwas fine after that…the paramedics told TaylornthatnEmily was dehydrated and her nerves made it worst. After about 45nminutes, the show started back. Emily never told a soul that she sawnMatt but she knew in her heart that, that was him. Larry had to comenup with a secret way to let all of Emily's fans what had happened.nLarry did a website called \"Myplace with Liana Taylor\" this sitenwas filled with news, tours, and the latest updates on Matt. This wasnso people could know a little about why Liana was not herself; thisnalso broadened the search for Matt. After a while of \"Myplace withnLiana Taylor.\" Larry started getting messages of encouragement andnsupport. AfternEmily's (Liana's) fall, TaylornpromisednLarry that everywhere Emily /Liana went when she was on tour Taylornwouldngo with her. Larry Let Taylor know about the (Myplace with LiananTaylor.) just so that if people were apologizing to her and theyndidn't know why it was because of Larry. Ancouple of day's later Emily and Taylor were on their way to AtlantanGeorgianfornanother concert at the CivicnCenter.nOn the plane when the light was on so that people could get up andnwalk around people would see Liana/Emily and Taylornandnoffer their words of encouragement and deepest sympathy. Emily smilednfor the first real smile and thanked them. \"Taylor,nthis is why I love doing tours and having so many fans. They alwaysnlook out for you if they are not crazy… which I have had some ofnthose in my day.\" Taylornletnout a small chuckle. \"Inknow what you mean Aunt Emily…I mean aunt Liana. I can getnconfused.\" \"It'snokay sweetpea, I don't think nobody heard you!\" Emily looked atnTaylor. \"Arenyou ready?\" \"Fornwhat?\" \"Well,nif you are going to be touring with me then you might as well opennfor me!\" Taylor'sneye's got big and her mouth dropped open. \"Arenyou serious?\" Emily smiled \"Wellnthis is no joking matter.\" \"Thanknyou! Thank you! Thank you!\" Taylornthrewnher arms around Emily's neck and Emily returned the hug. Thennext day Emily took TaylornaroundnAtlanta. They decided that Emily was going to buy her and Taylornnewndresses for the rise of Occasion. Thentwo of them spent around six hundred dollars each dress that theynwere going to wear on stage not mentioning the outfits they werengoing to make their first appearance. Theynarrived in front of the AtlantanCivicnCenterninna white limozeen. They were both dressed casual at first. Emily hadnher hair done but she wore a white, button up, long sleeve shirt,nwith a blue tank top under the white shirt, and butterfly embroiderednblue jeans with for the first time in a while wore white tennisnshoes. Just like Emily, Taylornwasndressed casual. Taylor hadnon a sleeveless black shirt with white polka dots, her jeans were anlittle long, but it was nothing a pair of silver 5-inch stilettosnhigh-heels couldn't fix. Taylornwasnthe first one out of the limozeen and she looked out into the crowdnof people who were standing around waiting for them. \"Ohnmy gosh!\" Taylor saidnas she looked out and saw signs all over saying things like \"We arenpraying for Matt's safety!\" and \"Matt just come home to yournmama!\" \"Taylor,nwhat is wrong?\" \"AuntnLiana, check this out!\" Taylornsaidnstill in shock. Emily reached for Taylor'snhand and as she saw, the signs held up by many of fans made the tearsnwhelp up in Emily's eyes. Emily and Taylor walked a red carpet thenreached as far as their eyes could see. They walked towards the tallnstone building, as they reached the two backstage doors Emily startedngiving Taylor directions. \"Nownyou go to the dressing room on stage right and I will be on the left.nWe have four hours before we go on just be ready. I will come outnfirst to introduce you, you will sing for about 30 minutes so I cannchange. They will do your hair and make-up. So are you good?\" \"Inthink so…just one question. Have you drank enough water today?\"nEmily looked at her oddly and remembered that she had drank sixthnbottle of water that day. \"Ohnyou're just being comical aren't you?\" Taylornsmiledna most wicked smile she could come up. Emily rolled her eyes. \"Nownyou just go and get dressed and be ready!\" Emily crossed the stagenand went into her dressing room. Emilyncould hear the chanting going on. She got an almost nervous feel tonher stomach and kind of light-headedness feel to her head, but thennshe decided it was just her nerves playing with her. Emilynwas standing right behind the curtain and looked over at Taylor whonwas shaking her hands trying to get her nervousness out. Emily smilednas Taylor triednbringing a smile back in return. When they gave her the cue to comenon, Emily walked out with her head held high and her smile wasnbrighter than ever! Her outfit was a blue sleeveless dress with anpair of black high heels on. \"Well,nHow are you?\" the crowed cheered as she waved out in the audience. \"Thanknyou it's been a while hasn't it?\" the crowd hit its high point.nEmily looked over at Taylor. \"Okaynya'll I want to introduce you to my youngest and…,\" Emilynlooked over to Taylor andnsmiled. \"Favoritenniece, Taylor Anderson!\" Emily threw her hand in the direction thatnTaylor wasncoming out of; Taylornwalkednout to the middle of the stage and met Emily in the middle. She gavenEmily a hug. Emily whispered in her ear, \"You go get'emnsweetpea!\" Emily walked off stage Left. \"Thanknyou Aunt Liana! You truly are the best!\" Taylornsaidnas she introduced the song that she was going to sing. \"Okaynthe song I am going to sing tonight is one that my aunt taught me asna little girl and it has always been special to me! I didn't tellnAunt Liana about this but I am gonna sing \"Two Little Orphans,\"nit was a song that she sang to me to get me to sleep when I stayednwith her.\" When Taylornstarted,nshe was somewhat soft but she looked over at Emily, who winked andnsmiled the song belted from Taylor'snvoice. The angelic voice echoed throughout the auditorium. ShockednEmily turned around to catch a glimpse of her bright young smile.nEmily knew she wouldn't be able to stay and watch Taylor,nfor she had to change before going back on. Ancouple of songs later and once Liana had changed Taylornwasnfinally through. Emily came back on stage. Her black Capri'snand her pink polka dotted mid sleeve shirt, danced in the lights asnshe walked. \"Nownya'll didn't she do great?\" the crowd went crazy. Once Liananwas back on stage and finished the show, everything felt right again. ","Summary":" REAL LOVE REALnLOVE Thenyear is November 4, 2005nmynname is Taylor Anderson.

'Excuse me, can I help you?' the voice broke straight through my thoughtsnand I started guiltily. I struggled to regain my composure as I recited mynwell-rehearsed answer to that particular question. 'I'm here to see senior Detective Matthews, my name is Emerald Liston andnI've just been transferred here' The words came out quickly and clearly, Incan lie it's one of my few skills in life, I've lied from the day I wasnborn and I'll lie on the day I die, that's something 'Thunderstrike' nevernhad to teach me. The man who had spoken to me was short and more thannslightly overweight, I saw from his name tag his name was Thomas Jenson butnI decided to ask who he was it doesn't pay for people to think you are toonobservant. 'Can you tell me where I should be I'm a little lost, Mr Um...' 'Jenson, Thomas Jenson but you can call me Tom everyone does' he smiled atnme in that way men who want you but realise you would never feel the samenway have. I decided it wouldn't hurt to help his ego a bit so I put on mynbest Bimbo smile, fluttered my eyelashes and looked at him as though hencould make the world move. 'Oh Tom, do you know where I should be, you seem so clever and I'm alreadynlate' ok so the clever bit was coming on a bit too strong but be subtle andnthese guys will never get it. He didn't seem to mind so I guess there wasnno harm done. 'It's just this way, Emerald I'll take you' he grinned again only this timenit was a far more sickening sight, he was looking at me as though I was andumb blonde who was actually interested in him, I'm not even naturallynblonde!! And I hate men who presume they can use your first name justnbecause they've given you permission to use theirs. Well it's not really mynfirst name but he doesn't know that! By the time we reached Matthew'snoffice I was feeling positively nauseous from his special little smiles, henonly met me a few minutes ago, but he presumes he knows me, people do thatna lot to me so I guess it's why I can do this job. But still Yuck! 'Here we are' he says. Since when are we a 'we'?? I have no knowledge ornactive participation in this. At least I'm escaping that lecherous oldnfish, I mean Matthews can't be worse can he???[Chapter 2] Authors Note – Ok thanx to everyone who reviewed, you guys are great!! I'mnnot promising to be nice to Grace and Eric in this fic, you'll just have tonwait and see hehe!! All I will say is that 'Emerald' is really more of annobserver at the min!! I'm also going to scrap the romance since I'vendecided I can do angst better, there may be romance later but first thenfun, angst, angst, angst hehe!! Anyway onwards to the story.. Disclaimer – Do I need to tell you it ain't mine?? Well if I do...IT IS NOTnMINE! Chapter 2 I pushed the door open, I would love to say I took a deep breath or Inmentally steeled myself or some other romantic crap like that but hey, thisnis life we don't have time for deep breaths and if your not mentallynprepared before your standing outside the room you are about to walk intonand lie through your teeth then you must be suicidal or something. Anywaynif I had paused then Thomas would have suspected something. Oh notnconsciously, he was far too stupid for that, but the seeds of mistrustnwould be sown deep in his sub-conscious and that is something to avoid atnall costs. I know, I know it sounds melodramatic but it's a useful fact,ncould save your life someday! Sure as hell has saved mine! The guy I saw in the office was exactly like the pictures SL had sent me ofnhim, but then again SL always had up-to-the-second information on anyone,nanywhere in the world. No kidding sometimes it even scares me how much thatnguy knows, but I guess that's his job, to know everything. The guy glancednup as I walked in and for a millisecond I stood there thinking, bimbo,nbitch, bimbo bitch, bimbo...bitch...bimbo....bitch. Ok so I was lying when I saidnyou have to prepare everything before you begin an assignment somethingnhave to be left until you meet the person, get a feel of their personalitynif you know what I mean. I do bitches better than Bimbos anyway, I guessnit's because I really am one! 'Senior Detective Matthews, Eric Matthews?' I ask even though I knownexactly what the answer will be. That's my job I guess SL knows everythingnI ask stupid questions. He is now staring right at me, his eyes assessing,ntrying to figure out what the guy's at the top have sent him. I'm used tonit, it only puts him at a disadvantage because I know exactly what I'mndealing with, Male, Dark hair and eyes, nearing 45 and judging by thengolfing magazine in the middle of a mid-life crisis. I knew his tracknrecord as well, he did good on the Beauty pageant thing, him and his wife,na couple of homicide cases he cracked as well which most people said werenimpossible, another spate of bombings in San Fran, they asked for himnespecially, and finally his piece de resistance so to speak the capture ofnthe snowman, a notorious serial killer. There it is this guy's life in anfew sentences, when did this happen to me? Since when have people's livesnonly been three sentences scrawled on a piece of paper, memorised thenndestroyed to me. I used to care about the targets, but I guess it finallyngets to you. 'Yes, that's me and you are?' he asked casually but I could tell by hisnbody language that it riled him to not have the upper hand, this guy likednto be in control and he liked to know what was going on around him. Insmiled at him, not sickly, not flirtatious, and maybe kind of tense. ThenI'm-harassed-and-can't-be-bothered-with-men-career-woman smile, as I smilednat him I took in at a glance the layout of his office, SL had as usual comenup with the goods there was nothing unexpected about this room. He even gotnthe slight slant one of his certificates adorning the walls was at. 'Emerald, Emerald Liston, detective' even as I was speaking I wasnregretting the bitch decision. Maybe just maybe I could be a...but before thenthought even matured in my mind I suppressed it. Maybe I had screwed, maybenplaying the bitch was the wrong decision but it was a decision I hadnalready made and it was irreversible. 'I was transferred here from Chicagonby the Chief Commissioner, the whole crimes reported vs. results achievednratio thing...' I let my voice trail off, telling him just enough to realisenlying would be pointless but not enough for him to condemn as a completencow just yet. He flushed, god how predictable, everything is a personalnattack on their ego with men, they never can realise that we're not tryingnto make them feel bad simply stating the truth. He was struggling to saynsomething with dignity and composure and I let him suffer, mentally I rannthrough my cover story to check one final time for leaks and I pretendednnot to realise the difficulties he was in. Yup I really am a bitch, but thenguy dug his own grave. A/N – Sorry I know it's short but I don't want to get involved with Gracienuntil next chapter. Remember feedback feeds the author and makes her wantnto write more! ([Chapter 3] Authors note – I apologise I've been very neglectful of this fic!

Oh and thank you to everyone who hasnreviewed I really appreciate it and you even get an exclusive personalnmention in next chapters authors note!! Hint hint review hint hint! Thanknyou Bob, Lisa, Jennifer-morie, bonny, the juggernaut and trisket-n-gunther.nGotta love the personal touch! : ) Disclaimer – Do I sound like an American movie company owner to you?? Nope,nwell you're right, I'm not therefore I do not own Miss Congeniality! Chapter 3 He was still trying to think of a way to regain the ground he had alreadynlost in the conversation when the door flew open and a tall, good-lookingnbrunette walked in. I already knew who she was; as I have already saidnseveral times I do my research. Grace Matthews, usually called Gracie, age-n33, occupation- senior detective, married to the man sitting at the desknacross from me. She was a good officer and I did respect her for her worknespecially since the beauty pageant case, but to be honest I don't likenother women near my cases. To confuse a man all you need to do is shownrather excessive amounts of flesh and flirt outrageously, this rarely ifnever works with a woman. You have to make friends with them, pretend tonlike them and sometimes you even do like them but that just makes it allnworse when you know that any friendship you've shared with them is doomednbecause one day in the future you'll disappear, vanish, nothing left toneven signify your existence, gone. I work on men and play to their insecurities but women are harder they arenjust plain harder to work out, and from what I already knew about Gracienshe wasn't going to be easy to figure out. 'Excuse me, I was in the middle of a private discussion here, perhaps youncould return later?' It's always better to assert yourself first; it givesnyou the upper hand, the control, which is always useful. I'm sticking tonthe bitch idea, less likely to make female friends, or any friends for thatnmatter, all the more likely to give me time to work. She looked shocked forna second, a millisecond maybe but then I could see the flash of anger innher eyes, I knew this wasn't going to be easy. 'Oh I'm terribly sorry to inconvenience you Miss...' she expected me to tellnher my name but as I far as I'm concerned she can read the name tag, that'snwhy I'm wearing one of these things, I don't want to be helpful after all!nShe glanced at the nametag and continued speaking almost through clenchednteeth. 'Liston, I was under the impression that I worked in this buildingnand was entitled to check the details of an important case with my boss.'nShe was rude, abrupt, and dripping sarcasm, you go girl! I knew she was onnthe defensive now, but I guess that's all the better for me, this way Inwon't have to suffer 'welcome-to-the-team' drinks or whatever socialnoccasion I'm sure someone in the office was already planning. I smiled at her mainly because I liked the way she stood up for herself butnI knew that was not going to be the interpretation she took from mynactions.n'Of course you are entitled to enter your Boss's office at anytime, but ifnyou need him to hold your hand on every detail of a case when he isnobviously engaged in an important meeting then I suggest I'm beginning tonsee why this department is so far below the national averages' This caughtnher off balance, I guess she hadn't had the situation explained to her andnit was really quite complex, well it was to me. I am going undercover as anpolice investigator going undercover as a normal detective, ok so shendoesn't have the first part to deal with but the rest is confusing enough.nI knew I should explain but somehow I just couldn't be bothered so I satnback and watched Matthews, the male one, try and explain to his lady-wife. 'Detective Matthews' he began and then decided on a less formal approach, Innever got used to being able to tell what was on people's minds throughntheir faces it still disconcerts me when I realise that I am thinking whatnthe person opposite me is thinking. It was a skill SL taught me, it's anskill we all have to observe the minute colour changes in someone's eyes,nthe flicker at the corner of their mouth, the slightest change in theirndemeanour could tell a trained observer a thousand things that a detailednspeech would barely touch upon. 'Gracie, This is Detective Emerald Liston,nwell I think that is her real name' I gave him a nod no point innovercomplicating matters by introducing another name. 'She is, well she isnhere to investigate why our department is having difficulties with, umm...nwith our statistical difficulties' I would love to say I enjoyed watching the man squirm; watching him reducednto the size of a peanut, but it would be a lie. I knew from the research Inhad done that he was a confident man, not just in his abilities as andetective but also in his abilities as a husband, friend and family man. Inrealized I had been a bit too harsh and if I carried on this way they wouldnnever warm up to me, after all my job is to isolate a leak, not to damagenor destroy someone's life. I guess this was as much guilt as I ever feelnanymore. 'I'm sorry I was a bit abrupt before, but the public is demanding resultsnfrom us, and at the end of the day now if I don't improve this department'snresults then my head will be on the block.' It must be over six monthsnbefore I've apologised to someone and genuinely meant it; it was a nicenchange really. 'As your husband said, I am Emerald Liston, I am workingnsemi-undercover in the sense that the majority of your department will benunaware that I am investigating so that I may be able to find the source ofnthem. I guess I was a little over-zealous before but it is so hard to getnthe results you need without being so nasty' Paste on nervous but self-ndeprecating face, smile somewhat inanely, and watch your I.Q. drop twentynpoints as you spiral downwards towards Bimbo. 'I'm Gracie Matthews, and I guess I'm sorry too' she said but I could tellnshe didn't mean it, I've done my best to salvage the situation so I guessnit's best to let them discuss me. 'I really do need to get on with my work so if you don't mind showing me mynoffice and things I would really appreciate it...' I let the sentence hang innthe air, Senior detective Matthews got up with a feline grace and replied 'Certainly, It's just this way Miss Liston' Note to self don't insult anman's wife in front of him.

Then a black cat appeared from behind the orange one. \"Oh gee you almost gave me a heart attack\" the orange cat almost screamed \"you must be Jackal right?\" \"So you bring the package?\" the black cat asked the orange one. \"Yeah don't get your nerves up I got it\" the orange cat said as he handed him a little envelope with his paw. \"Perfect, the boss will be extremely happy\" Jackal the black cat said as he looked at the envelope with a grin. At the building next door a crouched Butch looked at the meeting with night vision goggles. \"HQ I've got Jackal on sight\" Butch said \"and he's holding some kind of envelope. The drop took place\" \"Okay find out where Jackal will take that envelope and then fetch and retrieve it\" Lou said through the other side of the comm. \"Copy, over and out\" \"Good luck Butch\" Lou said. Butch turned off his comm. He put on his goggles and zoomed in on Jackal at the roof of the other building. \"So who is your boss anyway?\" the orange cat asked. \"Don't ask questions you don't wanna know the answer to?\" Jackal said as he put the envelope in his backpack. \"Okay you don't have to be so cryptic, gee\" the orange cat said as he turned to leave. He jumped to the fire escape stairs and left. Jackal looked at the horizon; he saw the Eiffel tower and gave just the hint of a smile. As Jackal stretched his paws a knife spat out of his left paw and went straight to the other building. Butch crouched just as the knife passed by his head. He then lifted his head \"Just in the nick of time\" he said looking at the knife. \"Let's see if you can catch me Butch\" Jackal said as he started to run. \"What?\" Butch looked back. Jackal threw himself off the building and as he was falling wings sprat out of his backpack. \"Oh no you don't\" Butch said as he opened his jetpack and flew off. \"HQ Jackal is on the run, I'm in pursuit\" \"What? How? Were you compromised?\" Lou asked preoccupied. \"Somehow Jackal knew I was onto him\" Jackal flew to the top of a building and quickly hid his wings and ran. \"Sorry Lou gotta land I'll check in later\" \"Be careful Butch\" \"Copy\" Butch landed. His jetpack turned off. \"There's nowhere to run Jackal\" Butch said as he walked slowly towards an entrance door. He entered slowly, walking with a steady pace. There were no lights inside the building. When he got inside he noticed he was walking through a cat rail. Below there was nothing but air. \"Wow the great Butch coming to arrest me?\" Jackal mocked. Butch quickly looked back. Nothing was there. Jackal's voice was heard with an echo. \"I'm not there\" Jackal said. \"Show yourself cat\" Butch demanded. He put on his night goggles. He looked everywhere in the building but Jackal was nowhere to be seen. Then a clawed paw extended from the roof where Butch was. Jackal grinned. When Jackal threw himself to scratch Butch, the Anatolian Shepherd quickly dodged and turned to face Jackal. \"Hey there Butch\" Jackal said in a position ready to fight. \"How do you know my name?\" Butch asked. \"I know a lot of things about you\" Jackal smiled. \"Where is Tinkles?\" Butch angered. \"You're in no position to ask, when I'm your prisoner then you can ask me\" Jackal said sarcastically. \"Let's go then hotshot\" and with that Butch ran towards Jackal and Jackal towards Butch. Jackal jumped and scratched Butch's back. Butch complained but threw a back kick and hit Jackal in the back. \"Nice one\" Jackal complimented. Butch turned to face Jackal in fighting position. \"But what about this one\" Jackal started to run and he jumped to a rail and then zigzagged between rails. He did this so fast that by the time Butch reacted a kick was already in his face. Butch fell to the floor. \"You're not as quick as you used to be, old dog\" Butch saw Jackal's paws as he looked up \"It's about time you got here\" Jackal said to an unknown figure. Butch stood up and looked at the unknown figure \"Huh? You? So that's how Jackal knew I was onto him. You sneaky…\" a sleeping dart interrupted Butch's speech. He fell to the floor. \"Poor mutt didn't even know what he was getting into\" Jackal said as Butch finally closed his eyes. \"Sleeping time little doggy\" Jackal mocked. \"Butch, Butch you okay\" Lou asked concerned through the comm \"Butch\"[Chapter 2] Chapter one The Mission should you choose to accept it… San Francisco Shane Residence 1200 hours Shane, Diggs's cop partner and now owner, stood in front of the barbecue cooking some sirloin steaks. \"Hmm something smells good\" Shane's wife said coming up behind him. \"Oh hey honey yeah they're almost done\" Shane said. A black nose smelled the air \"Ahh yeah they're almost done alright\" a laid down German shepherd said \"my man Shane sure knows how to handle that meat converter thing.\" Diggs lay down beside the sleeping one-year old baby in his stroller. \"Diggs, want some buddy?\" Shane asked while moving the steaks to a large plate. \"Oh ho you don't have to ask me twice\" Diggs stood up and ran towards his master. When he got to Shane he sat. Shane sliced a little piece of meat and showed it to Diggs \"Here you go buddy\" and threw the sliced meat. Diggs saw it fly right in front of his eyes. He let out his tongue and jumped. He grabbed the piece of meat in midair. \"Wow atta boy Diggs\" Shane gasped \"Hey go get this ball boy\" Shane grabbed a softball and threw it. Diggs studied the ball's course following it with his eyes until its landing beside a tree \"Hmm you're mine ball\" Diggs ran as fast as he could towards the ball. He grabbed it with his mouth and stopped a little further \"Oh yeah.\" \"What a pointless activity\" he heard Catherine's voice in his head recalling what she said on the ferry a year ago about fetch. \"Catherine hehe I hope you're okay\" he said as he dropped the ball. The bushes in front of Diggs moved. \"Huh? Who's there? Show yourself?\" he said in fighting stance. Beside his right side squishy sounds could be heard. He looked beside him and he saw a squirrel walking over to his dog house. \"Oh HQ\" he looked back at his family. Shane was sitting down on the table having his baby in the middle between him and his wife. \"Oh man\" he ran towards his dog house and entered it. The squirrel turned to face Diggs \"Your mission agent Diggs should you choose to accept it will be revealed at HQ. This squirrel will self-destruct but first a little dance\" the squirrel started dancing hip hop. It threw itself on the floor and started giving kicks \"Oh gee not this again\" Diggs said frustrated. The squirrel stood up \"Okay I'm done\" the squirrel exploded. Diggs pushed a board. The floor went down and he got seated to a turbo charged mobile. The mobile quickly fired away. \"Wohoo, I'll never get tired of this\" Diggs shouted. The mobile quickly stopped at the port. Diggs climbed down. At the entrance door of D.O.G HQ he stopped \"Breath required for identification\" an automated voice said. Diggs let out his breath to a little hole in the computer \"Welcome Agent Diggs\" the computer said as the doors opened \"Please get a mint\" the computer said. Diggs walked \"Hey there Diggs\" a terrier greeted Diggs \"Hey there Ter looking good.\" He stopped in the middle of the large room where all agents where walking. \"Diggs\" Lou shouted from the second floor. Diggs looked up. Lou commanded him with a gesture to come to his office. All the windows from the office closed. \"Um Lou what are you doing?\" Diggs asked concerned. \"I can trust you right Diggs?\" Lou asked as he closed the last curtain. \"Um yes sir when have I let you down?\" Diggs reassured. \"I can't believe this\" Lou said as he sat in his office chair. \"Sir what's wrong? Is it that Tinkles again?\" Diggs angered. \"Yes it's him but there's also something else\" \"Oh no not Kitty Galore too?\" \"Butch is missing\" \"What? How did…? What Happened?\" \"He was on a mission in France investigating where Mr. Tinkles was and what he was planning\" Lou explained. \"So then what happened?\" Diggs asked in desperation. \"Then he encountered one of the top feline assassins in the world\" Lou said as a screen popped up from beside them. It showed Jackal on various photos across the world. \"Meet Jackal. He may look not so tough but he has taken out dogs twice his size with only his paw.\" \"His paw? That's an exaggeration right?\" Lou looked at Diggs seriously. \"Oh right sorry\" Diggs said. \"We think he was employed by Mr. Tinkles to gather some information for his next attack which we don't know yet what it is. Butch was on the verge of discovering what Tinkles was planning but then he got bested by Jackal\" \"Butch wouldn't let himself be beaten up by a cat\" Diggs said sure of himself. \"It wouldn't have happened if a mole didn't infiltrate HQ\" \"A mole? But we could have seen a cat infiltrate HQ from miles away\" \"I didn't say it was a cat\" Lou said frustrated \"This may have happened only once or twice in our lifetime. A dog has turned.\" \"From inside HQ how's that even possible?\" \"That's why I'm assigning you to go to France and investigate what happened to Butch and what is Tinkles planning?\" \"Whoa France's a long way isn't it?\" \"Don't worry I've got a mobile that will take you right to the heart of France\" \"Awesome let's go get Butch\" \"Hey listen before you go, I've asked one of the operatives from France to help you on the investigation. He will greet you upon your arrival\" \"I though you said there was a mole in HQ\" \"Yes inside HQ feeding information to Tinkles but this operative is in France and I trust him\" Lou said as he got closer to Diggs. \"Oh man okay but my partner is still Butch right?\" \"Yes he will just be there to help you\" \"Okay let's go kick some cat fur\" Diggs said excited \"Butch here I come\" he said as he walked out of the office. The curtains opened. \"Follow me\" Lou said.[Chapter 3] Hi everyone sorry for the delay of this chapter but finally finished it. Hope you like it. Chapter two From France with Love \"Hey Lou what about my family?\" Diggs asked as he followed the beagle. \"Oh yeah about that, we sent a replacement for you\" \"A replacement?\" Diggs opened his eyes. \"Just for the day until you come back\" Lou stopped. \"Oh okay at least they won't be worried about me\" Diggs exhaled. \"Peek prepare Diggs for the mobile\" Diggs looked around. He didn't see Peek anywhere. Then part of the white wall came out. \"Whoa what the\" Diggs jumped. The white figure morphed into Peek \"I introduce you the Chameleon three thousand\" \"Um what's a chameleon three thousand?\" Diggs asked. \"Latest camouflage technology\" \"That's totally spyish haha\" Diggs said. \"Okay Peek give him one of those he'll need it\" Lou demanded. \"How's it work\" Diggs asked. \"Oh it's embedded in your collar along with the other stuff\" Peek said matter-of-factly. \"Really I've had it all this time?\" Diggs asked looking at his collar around his neck. \"Standard issue on all new collar models. They were given three months ago weren't you at the briefing?\" \"Oh yeah sort of\" Diggs evaded. \"Okay Diggs let's get you on the mobile and onto France so you can meet the operative in\" Lou rushed. Diggs and Lou both walked over to a giant port. Above the port there were flickers of light moving in all directions. \"Those are all the mobiles traveling around the world\" Lou explained. \"Wow I've never been here before\" Diggs said in awe. \"So you gonna go or what?\" Lou pointed at a big mobile at the center of the room. \"Yeah, Butch here I come\" Diggs said. Diggs mounted on the mobile. It automatically closed and put on the seatbelt \"Diggs remember this mission requires stealth, it's a rescue mission when you come back with Butch then we figure out what to do with Tinkles\" Lou ordered. \"Don't worry chief stealth is my middle name\" Diggs screamed. \"You don't have to scream I can hear you just fine\" \"Oh\" \"Go and bring Butch home\" \"France here I come\" And with that Diggs accelerated and went away with a boost. \"Wooohooo\" Diggs screamed all the way. He went as fast as he could. The tube went on and on, going as fast as it could. Diggs couldn't see anything outside just pure blackness. He put on the radio \"And tonight we're gonna have Jamy as our guest...\" the radio guy said before Diggs cut him off. \"Unbelievable no music well I guess it's boring time until I get there\" Diggs closed his eyes.\" \"Thirty seconds for arrival\" the computer said. \"What? Already? Wow that was fast\" The mobile stopped. Diggs got ejected \"Whoa what the\" some closet doors opened. Diggs was inside a walk-in closet. He looked outside. There appeared to be no one on the living room. The room was smelly \"Oh man what's that smell?\" Diggs said almost about to sneeze. He straightened his nose. Diggs stood in the living room. From behind him a French Poodle came. \"Hmm\" Diggs quickly turned \"Oh\" he said surprised \"You must the agent I'm supposed to meet\" he looked at the poodle. The dog was well trimmed and a good body \"Wow they didn't tell me that the agent in France was a female\" Diggs blushed. \"I'm not, I'm a male\" a deep masculine voice said. \"Whoa what the…\" Diggs jumped and his face turned angry \"Oh my dog\" \"Don't worry kid it happens more than you know\" the poodle said. \"Okay um this is awkward\" Diggs looked down. \"Leave it in the past, I'm agent F. Poodle\" \"So you're the contact then\" \"Yes, my instructions are to show and tell you what Butch was doing and then you take it from there\" Poodle instructed. \"Um okay then Poodle take it away\" Diggs still felt weird about before and couldn't look Poodle in the eye.[Chapter 4] Hi sorry for the long wait of chapter 3 I'm also working on a novel plus several short stories plus college homework but finally some time off so without further ado here is chapter 3 sorry again for taking so long Chapter 3 The Interrogation Butch opened his eyes. He looked around and saw nothing but blackness. \"Where am I?\" he asked aloud waiting for someone to respond but nothing. \"Hello is anybody there?\" he tried to move but couldn't. The lights turned on. He saw himself strapped to a metal table sideways. Some cats with lab coats entered the room. The room was large. It had two floors and Butch was on the middle like he was an exhibit for everyone to look at. \"Who are you?\" Butch asked astonished \"What are you doing?\" The cats said nothing, they only took out bags full of medical equipment. Butch saw needles, scalpels, scissors and every other medical equipment you could think off \"What are you gonna do to me?\" One cat looked at him and chuckled while holding a needle. \"Well well if it ain't the famous Butch\" a voice said from upstairs. \"Huh I know that voice\" Butch looked up. The shadow of the cat that talked formed on the ceiling as he walked nearer into Butch's view. \"My my you're getting old agent\" the light formed the figure of Mr. Tinkles, the white persian cat. \"Tinkles\" Butch screamed \"what are you up to?\" \"Oh this feels familiar\" Tinkles said \"Oh yes we've been in this situation before but this time you're the one that's strapped and I'm the one asking the questions.\" \"Tell him boss\" Calico screamed from behind Tinkles. \"I'm trying to give an evil speech here, don't interrupt again\" Tinkles whispered \"And so my dear Butch just to what do I owe the pleasure of seeing you here.\" \"You dognapped me.\" \"Yes that part I know I arranged it.\" \"I know what you're planning Tinkles I heard it from your cat Jackal himself.\" \"Oh really?\" \"Yes\" Butch said assured \"HQ caught my signal and probably sent someone over by now.\" \"Oh you mean your pal, that loudmouth German Shepperd?\" \"What? Diggs?\" Butch's eyes opened. \"Yes him. I know he's the one they sent.\" \"But how?\" Butch looked to the floor \"unless...\" \"A dog betrayed you? Well that answers your question. Jackal knew you were watching him, the whole thing was a charade to get you Butch.\" \"Me? Why?\" \"Well if you knew my plans like you said, you would know wouldn't you but oh dear you don't know, I don't want to spoil my plans to you just yet\" Tinkles looked at the cats \"Boys the laser.\" A machine holding a pistol came down from the roof. The pistol pointed right at Butch's table as a red laser shot. The laser slowly went through the table \"You expect me to talk?\" Butch asked looking for a way out. \"No agent Butch I expect you to sleep\" Tinkles mocked. The cat that chuckled put the needle in Butch's thighs \"Hey what the\" he said surprised and then his head fell down. Tinkles walked back to his office on the second floor \"And now the next phase of my plan ha-ha.\" \"Is getting my revenge\" a cat said from within Tinkles's office. Tinkles started back a little scared \"Oh it's just you Kitty who else could it be?\" \"You promised me to get revenge on all of them. they humiliated me in public\" Kitty Galore said frustrated. \"All in due time my dear Kitty, my plan will work if we want to rule the world and exterminate dogs we must first attack their defenses.\" \"Yes you told me.\" \"You and I will rule the world together.\" As soon as they approached noses \"Boss\" Calico urged. \"I'm busy can't you see I'm in the middle of something?\" Tinkles looked back menacingly. \"Sorry sir I just heard from our dog, everything is in place for Diggs.\" \"Good, send Jackal after him.\" Calico left. \"My plan to rule the world is but at my paws at last\" Tinkles said. \"And mine Tinkles\" Kitty said \"Without me this plan would've never occured to you.\" \"Ha-ha- Cats rule.\"[Chapter 5] Chapter 4 Meet Trim \"Well Diggs we're gonna go see Trim, he's a golden retriever and he knows this city better than anyone, even better than myself\" Poodle said as they approached the main door of the hotel they were in. \"Who's he?\" Diggs asked. \"Anything you need anywhere you need it he's the one to talk too, he's my contact here, I trust him completely and already briefed him on the situation.\" \"Um Poodle if we go outside alone we lose our cover.\" \"Don't worry that's fixed\" Poodle opened a door beside him resembling damaged mail boxes. He took out two backpacks \"Here put this on.\" \"Wow cool I didn't see that one coming.\" Diggs said amazed and picked up the backpack \"Why aren't there any humans here?\" \"Because they're all asleep, it's still night here you know, helps with the stealth situation.\" Poodle said like Diggs already knew. `\"Oh yeah I knew that\" Diggs said to act smart. \"So what are the backpacks for then?\" Poodle put on his and pulled a cord. The backpack opened and a balloon inflated really quick and took the form of a human. The fake human held a leash that went to Poodle's neck collar. \"Whoa didn't see that one coming either\" Diggs said excitedly and pulled his cord. Another human balloon inflated. A little girl balloon \"Hey a little girl.\" Poodle's human was a man. \"What?\" he asked Diggs \"These are father and daughter walking their dogs before the sun comes up, the perfect cover. And since its night they won't seem like inflated balloons.\" \"But they are inflated balloons\" Diggs corrected. \"I know but like I said since its dark out people won't notice, why? What's the problem?\" \"I thought you were gonna pull a jetpack and fly us there\" Diggs said thoughtfully. \"Too risky, these are stealthier and won't draw too much attention.\" They opened the door and walked out. The inflated human balloons had wheels beneath their feet. Diggs and Poodle walked pretending that their humans walked them. The city of Paris was as lighted that it felt that it was already daylight \"So much light\" Diggs finally broke silence. \"If you wanna talk, lower your volume someone might hear you\" Poodle said lowly. \"Right sorry\" Diggs said in a low voice as well \"so agent Poodle how did you become an agent?\" \"Long story\" Poodle said trying to evade the question \"and a rather short walk.\" \"Um okay you wouldn't believe how I became an agent\" Diggs laughed. \"I know all about it agent Diggs\" Poodle replied. \"Oh um okay\" Diggs looked away \"why won't you talk?\" \"Because someone might hear us, I told you, you're talking too much, be silent until we get there, is not that far.\" \"Okay you don't have to be such a party pooper\" Diggs looked at the road. The next moments were of complete silence. Both Diggs and Poodle walked without talking. Poodle walked without a grin but Diggs felt extremely uncomfortable in this silence. He looked everywhere in desperation. \"Would you get ahold of yourself agent?\" Poodle demanded \"We're almost there.\" \"Sorry I guess being alone in complete silence in the kennels did a number on me.\" \"Well get over it not every mission you go too is fights and explosions, sometimes you have to do stake-outs and those last a million years.\" \"And here I thought Butch was boring.\" They walked over the sidewalk of a bridge, then through a town. It took them fifteen minutes to get to an abandoned old building. Poodle pushed the doors open. \"We're here\" Poodle said. The doors closed and both balloons got into the backpacks. \"Woo what a ride huh Diggs\" Poodle said excitedly. \"Uh huh yeah\" Diggs pretended to be excited. A golden retriever appeared from down the hall of the dark building. \"Poodle my man\" Trim said. \"Trim you're here\" Poodle replied. They both met face to face. \"Where else could I be?\" Trim said. \"Hey listen Diggs this here is Trim, he was Butch's last contact\" Poodle said. \"Oh so you're the famous Diggs\" Trim approached Diggs. \"Um yeah that's me\" Diggs said \"So you were the one that Butch met before he got dognapped.\" \"That's me yes\" Trim said \"But I didn't dognap him if that's what you're inferring.\" \"Oh no I didn't infer anything\" Diggs said. \"Come on Diggs you don't really suspect Trim here, Butch Jackal got the best of him.\" \"That I need to see it to believe it\" Diggs said. \"Alright Poodle, Diggs has the right to think that. I was the last to talk to Butch\" Trim said \"I hate cats just as much as you; we're all on the same team here.\" \"Alright so where did you send Butch?\" Diggs asked. \"To a warehouse owned by Doggie Corp.\" \"What's that?\" Diggs asked. \"A company that sells dog food\" Trim said \"but don't get too hungry, the company's a front and is really owned by Tinkles according to my sources. That's all I know.\" \"Where is this warehouse?\" Diggs asked in a hurry. \"About three blocks from here. You'll know when you get there\" Trim answered. \"Is worth a look to see what Tinkles is planning\" Poodle said \"Thanks Trim we'll be in touch.\" Trim went back down the hallway. \"Where's he going?\" Diggs asked. \"He's not a field agent just a lab geek working for us\" Poodle said. \"Oh okay let's check out that warehouse\" Diggs started to run. \"Hey hey remember stealth\" Poodle said while pointing at the backpacks. \"Oh you've got to be kidding me.\"[Chapter 6] Chapter 5 Thank God for Catherine The sun was rising. Both Diggs and Poodle walked with their inflated humans from Trim's place across the streets of Paris. They walked for it seemed like hours. Diggs's eyes were closing \"Oh how much further?\" he asked in desperate need of an answer. \"Keep your head up we're almost there.\" \"I thought Trim said it was three blocks away.\" \"Yes and three blocks we have passed, we should see the warehouse any minute now\" Poodle reassured a sleepy Diggs. After a few more minutes Poodle saw atop a building a sign that read Doggie Corp . \"Hey Diggs I think that's the warehouse. Daylight had broken, the balloons were visible now. \"Finally let's go before someone sees us with balloons on our backs\" Diggs said as they both ran to the entrance of the warehouse and put the balloons away. They opened the doors. A wind quickly passed by Diggs's back. He looked back and saw shadows that quickly dissipated in the building. \"Diggs come on before someone sees us\" Poodle said. Diggs closed the doors and ran towards Poodle \"I thought I saw something.\" The warehouse contained a lot of boxes but there were no employees in sight. \"Hey cool there's no one\" Diggs said. \"What did you expect, it's a Sunday\" Poodle said as he started to walk towards the boxes \"we need to examine what's inside these boxes.\" \"Do you think Tinkles is planting some kind of chemical in dog food?\" Diggs asked preoccupied. \"That's what we wanna check out. This is the last place Butch came before they dognapped him\" Poodle said as he studied the warehouse. It looked abandoned. \"Hmm this place looks like it hasn't been used in a while\" Diggs observed as he saw cobwebs in the boxes. Poodle looked at him. \"Trim told us that this place was in use right? It looks as it hasn't been used in months\" Poodle looked up. He saw a cat jumping from the second floor with his sharpened claws about to grab hold of Diggs. He pushed Diggs aside and the cat touched the floor and ran away. \"Whoa what the...\" Diggs said without realizing what had happened. \"A cat was about to sharpen his claws with you\" \"Wha… Wow thanks. Where are you cat? Show yourself\" Diggs growled. \"Well well\" a black cat came up from behind them. They both turned and growled. \"Attacking from the back huh, typical of a cat\" Diggs said. \"Don't take it personal, it's just business\" the black cat said. \"Wait I know who you are\" Diggs recognized the cat. He remembered a photo he saw back at D.O.G HQ. \"You're Jackal\" \"In the flesh\" he bowed. \"There's two of us and one of you\" Diggs said. \"Oh?\" two cats appeared from behind Jackal. He looked at them both \"Correction, there's three of us and one and a half of you if you count the lady dog\" Poodle growled more furiously. \"Boys bring me their furs\" Jackal said as he cleaned his claws. The other two cats stepped forward and ran towards Poodle and Diggs. \"Get ready Diggs\" Poodle said. \"I was born ready\" Diggs said. The two cats jumped and as they were about to hit Diggs and Poodle in the face, they dropped to the floor knocked out. Diggs and Poodle both tried to punch but saw that the cats were already on the floor. Jackal looked back preoccupied \"What happened?\" Jackal asked. Both Diggs and Poodle looked at each other. From behind them both a cat jumped and appeared in front of them \"I happened Jackal\" a recognizable female voice said. Diggs looked at the cat in front of him. The cat looked back at him. It was Catherine. She smiled and turned to look at Jackal. \"Well well Catherine long time no see\" Jackal chuckled. \"Another cat?\" Poodle asked. \"Wait you're not a female?\" Jackal asked Poodle. \"This cat's a friend\" Diggs said to Poodle. \"With M.E.O.W.S\" she said to Poodle. \"Oh cool\" Poodle said then turned his head back top Jackal. \"Wait you two know each other?\" Diggs asked. \"Unfortunately, we used to date\" Catherine said. Diggs felt his rage about to explode. \"Used to date? Catherine you're being modest. We used to be more than dates\" Jackal said. \"Enough Jackal, you and I are done\" Catherine said. \"Ah but Catherine\" \"You heard Catherine Jackal she said enough\" Diggs growled stronger. \"It's three against one\" Catherine said. Jackal looked angrily at the three of them and then he seemed to remember something and smiled \"I'll see you all at a later date au revoir\" and he quickly ran through a window and sprat out wings just like Catherine. Catherine ran to the window and threw what looked like a rock. \"Come on Catherine we'll hit him harder with bigger rocks\" Diggs said. \"I didn't throw him a rock, I threw a transmitter and it seemed to work. He'll lead us right to where Tinkles is\" \"Oh wow cool didn't think of that\" Diggs said. \"So Catherine how've you been? It's been a while that I haven't seen you\" \"Oh you know here and there\" she said looking down. \"What's wrong?\" Diggs asked. \"Catch up later we need to start moving before we lose the signal\" Poodle said. \"He's right\" Catherine said. \"But how are we gonna move in the daylight without attracting attention?\" \"I know\" Diggs remembered \"we can use my Chameleon three thousand. That way we'll be invisible and could move with ease without being watched by spies\" \"You have one of those?\" Poodle asked in astonishment. \"Yeah I just said\" \"Sure give the rookie a Chameleon three thousand and give the veteran a telescope\" \"Why would they give you a telescope?\" Catherine asked. \"Hello the older I get the blinder I get\" \"Stop being such a crybaby and come on\" Diggs said. Poodle sighed and went with Catherine and Diggs.[Chapter 7] Chapter Six Follow Jackal \"Okay here we go\" Digs said. They were right in the middle of the factory. Nothing happened. \"We're not gettin any younger\" Poodle said. \"What are we waitin for Diggs\" Catherine said. \"Is it on the push of a button or something?\" he said searching his backpack. \"You're tellin me you don't know how to work the Chameleon?\" Catherine sighed. \"It's gotta be around here somewhere\" he said searching buttons. Then he hit a big red one. Electricity passed by them \"Should've figure it would be the big red button\" he said between shocks of electricity. Then it stopped. \"That's it?\" Catherine asked. \"Wait look at us\" Poodle said. When they looked at themselves they were the color of the floor. They couldn't distinguish themselves. \"Perfect let's go before the signal dies\" Catherine said. They started running without problem. No person saw them. They just turned into the form or color of everything they ran across. Some people looked at the walls thinking they had saw something move. They ran through the street and alleyways following the signal. Jackal flew high enough so if someone saw him they would think it was a bird. As Diggs ran, his backpack belt hit a button. Opera started playing. \"What's that noise?\" Catherine said. \"I don't know some kind of music box\" Diggs said. \"O sole mio\" the voice sang. The music passed by the people like a car with loud music. People looked around looking for the music. \"Turn the music off\" Poodle said. \"Come on Diggs Jackal will spot us for sure with that music\" Catherine said. \"Come on let me help you\" Poodle said as they stopped. Poodle hit a button and the music stopped. \"Oh thanks I don't know how that got there\" Diggs said. \"Peek must be an Opera fan huh?\" \"Come on or we're gonna lose Jackal\" Catherine said as she started running again. Poodle and Diggs followed her. They kept running still seeing Jackal up in the sky. Catherine sighed when they hadn't lost him or better he hadn't spotted them yet. He flew and flew when he started to lower his altitude. \"I think he's landing\" Catherine said. He landed on top of an old factory a few miles away from them. He looked like a distant bird. \"Come on we know where Tinkles is now\" Diggs said. \"Butch here we come.\"[Chapter 8] Chapter 7 Butch Catherine, Poodle and Diggs ran toward the old factory. Electricity hit them again \"Not this again\" Diggs said. They stopped. They were them again. The shudder stopped. \"What happened?\" \"Maybe it stopped working\" Catherine said. \"At least we know where Butch is come on.\" \"Are they coming?\" Tinkles asked. \"As planned Tinkles\" Jackal said. \"That dog of yours is not bad after all well in the bad sense.\" \"Is Butch ready for departure?\" Tinkles asked holding his paws together. \"As requested\" Jackal answered. \"Good.\" Jackal left the room. Tinkles kept looking outside the window. He could see the whole factory from up there. His daydreaming was interrupted by a screeching sound. He looked around \"Calico if you're playing games I swear I will let the piranhas eat you.\" Then in front of him it appeared. The ugliest thing he ever saw: a white mouse. \"Oh dinner is served.\" The mouse looked at Tinkles. It screeched and started to run. \"Help me\" it said. \"Stop running\" Tinkles screamed as he trashed the office chasing the mouse. The mouse reached the door and turned around trembling. \"Nowhere to go mouse except my mouth\" Tinkles licked his lips. \"Tinkles stop\" Pussy Galore commanded. \"Huh?\" he looked at Pussy standing in window like she had jumped from somewhere to reach it. \"No one I mean no one eats Scrumptious but me. He's mine\" she threatened. She narrowed her eyes while looking at Tinkles. \"You forget dear I'm the boss and I eat what I like whenever I like.\" \"Not this mouse you don't\" she jumped down. She stood in front of Tinkles. Two great mastermind cats gazed at each other in what looked like a Mexican standoff. \"Remember we're in this together.\" Tinkles and Pussy both looked intently on one another. \"It's not good having two commanders in charge\" he backed down. \"And by the way didn't you tell me this mouse betrayed you?\" \"Oh no he didn't betray me\" Pussy said softly. \"He scarred me.\" Scrumptious looked everywhere for an exit. Then at the top he saw a little hole in one of the walls. He quickly ran toward it. \"Where do you think you're going little mouse?\" Tinkles said. \"Oh Scrumptious where are you going?\" Pussy said. \"I just wanna hold you again in my paws.\" She ran behind the mouse. \"Come to mommy little Scrumptious\" she said motherly. Scrumptious jumped through the hole as her paws were just about to grab him. She crashed in the wall. At the other side Scrumptious sighed and ran away. Pussy screeched and jumped back to where Tinkles was. \"That's one clever mouse\" Tinkles said. \"Don't say another word Tinkles\" Pussy screamed. \"Nobody screams at me\" Tinkles said but nobody heard him. Pussy had already jumped out the window. He lifted his paws in anger \"you can't have two masterminds working together.\" Diggs, Catherine and Poodle reached the old factory. \"Okay guys we're here\" Catherine said. They were walking toward a back exit door. \"Through here will be safest.\" They opened the door. Catherine put on some goggles and scanned the room for heat signature. No warm bodies were inside. \"Okay we're clear.\" \"Cool gadget\" Diggs said. \"Come on let's go in\" Poodle said. They went in and quietly closed the door. The room was dark. In front of them lay a door sparkling light from the other side. They ran toward it and quickly opened it. The light blinded them. When they rubbed their eyes what they saw was something out of this world. A brightly lit room held Butch in chains in the middle. \"Butch\" Diggs said. \"I never thought I would say this but I missed you.\" \"Diggs, Catherine what are you doing here?\" Butch said. \"We're rescuing you silly\" Catherine said. \"Hold tight I'll use my laser to break your chains\" Diggs said. \"Hmm this was too easy. There were no bodyguards or anything with you or outside\" Catherine said. \"Tinkles is a fool, that's what it is\" Diggs said as the chains broke. \"Hey where's Poodle?\" Catherine asked. \"Right behind you isn't he?\" Diggs said. No one was behind Catherine. \"What you came in Poodle. He was the one that set me up\" Butch said. The door where they came in closed tight. \"What?\" Catherine went to the door and tried to open it. \"You mean Poodle was working for Tinkles all along?\" Diggs said. \"Yeah it surprised me too\" Butch said. \"So that's how Jackal knew where you were Diggs. Poodle was the spy for the cats. It was all a trap\" Catherine said coming back. \"I can't believe it\" Diggs said. \"That cat lovin dog.\" \"Greetings spy dogs and cat\" Tinkles said over an intercom. \"You're probably wondering how you let yourselves get fooled by a dog. Well let me tell you it took a little convincing to believe he was on our side but he gained my trust when he procure Butch for us. You see just like us he was outcast of his own species well I'll let him tell you the story if you see him again. I'm going to give you only one choice, to walk away and don't disturb my plans.\" \"That's never gonna happen Tinkles\" Diggs said. \"You've rescued your friend wasn't that the mission?\" Tinkles asked. The door was tight shut opened. An army of mice came in from the door. \"Come on Tinkles mice don't scare us\" Diggs said. \"These aren't ordinary mice, dog\" Tinkles said. \"Careful if you touch one of them, you may get dreamy ha ha ha.\" the intercom turned off. \"They have hallucinogen gas in their backpacks\" Catherine said. All the mice had backpacks. \"If we touch one of them they blow gas.\" \"What are we gonna do?\" Diggs asked walking back. \"Or maybe allergy serums. I recognize these mice from time ago\" Butch said. \"It was my first mission with Lou. We stopped Tinkles from spreading allergies to humans. I didn't know he still had a few of those mice left.\" \"Well if is allergies to humans it won't hurt us right?\" Catherine said. \"I don't know. I never tasted it. There's just one way to find out\" Butch said.[Chapter 9] Chapter 8 Escape the Gas \"Follow my lead\" Butch called. Diggs and Catherine nodded. Butch turned around and ran toward some pipes and jumped on them. \"Come on I think I know a way up.\" Diggs and Catherine followed and jumped. Where the floor was there was now a pool of deadly mice. The mice ran around against each other. \"Hey look at that they can't climb\" Diggs said. One of the mice jumped on top of another and took off the cap that held the gas. The gas from that mouse made the others lose their gas as well. In a few seconds smoke covered all of the mice and was going up. \"They can't climb but that gas surely can run\" Butch screamed. Pipes went up the entire room toward a vent on the top. \"We need to get there guys\" Catherine shouted. She jumped from pipe to pipe around the room with ease. \"Yeah that's easy for you to say\" Diggs said barely hanging on. \"Hey Butch where's your rocket-pack thingy?\" \"Somewhere in the facility\" Butch while he jumped from pipe to pipe hanging on with just his claws. He looked down. The gas was almost upon them, only a few feet away. \"I changed my mind I don't wanna find out what's in that gas\" Diggs said. \"Well then hurry up\" Butch demanded. Catherine jumped from the last pipe to the vent and held on. She took out one claw and unscrewed the bolts. The vent door opened and fell down through the precipice of smoke. She went in. \"Come on guys.\" Butch was on the last pipe. He steadied himself and focused his eyes on the vent. Catherine layed down a rope. \"Much better\" he said. With much more confidence he jumped. He barely scratched the ropes but held on with his claws. \"Careful hold on\" Catherine made a knot in a little pipe in the vent to hold on Butch. The gas smoke was almost reaching the vent. Diggs got to the last pipe. Butch started to climb up. \"Diggs do what what Butch did.\" \"Easier said than done.\" Then he looked down. The smoke was a few feet away and coming up. \"Oh hold on Butch\" and he jumped catching Butch's tail with his claws. \"Argh Diggs you just had to do that didn't you?\" Butch started to climb faster. The gas hit Diggs's tail. \"I'll help you up Butch.\" He grabbed one side of the rope and let go of his partner's tail. They were both holding on together. Diggs started to climb and helped up his partner with one paw in the process. He let Butch climb first then he climbed. The gas reached the vent as soon as Diggs climbed. \"This isn't over come on\" Butch lead the way. Catherine was in the middle and Diggs in the back. They walked as fast as they could while being crouched. The gas was almost upon them. Diggs could smell something funny. \"Hey it smells weird in here.\" \"It smells like seawater\" Catherine said. \"Hey look up there there's a hatch. We can go through it and then close it behind us\" Butch said. \"Let's go\" Catherine said. \"Huh?\" Diggs's eyes were foggy. His eyes got heavier by the blink. \"Ahh I'm sleepy I wanna sleep.\" Butch got to the hatch and turned the handle on it. As he opened it they all passed and he closed it quickly before the gas could come through. \"Now we're safe.\" \"Aru Aru\" Diggs mumbled. \"I think the gas hit him Butch.\" \"Come on partner we're almost outta here.\" \"Hey you ralled me ratner.\" His eyes were half closed. This side of the vent was much larger so Butch could carry Diggs on his back. \"You've done enough kid you rescued me come on.\" He had his tongue outside and his eyes closed. \"I hope he gets better will he get better?\" \"Yeah his reaction was sleepiness. After a few hours of sleep he'll be as good as new.\" They walked a little further before hearing a loud cling behind the hatch. \"Oh no the pressure of the gas is too much\" Catherine said. \"Come on let's keep going.\" They ran to the end of the ventilation shaft. There was another hatch at the end. \"Catherine open this one.\" A loud cling was heard on the background. \"I'm on it.\" \"The other hatch broke.\" Catherine opened the hatch. A strong wind hit them and Catherine felt nothing but air beneath her. Some teeth grabbed her neck's fur. She saw beneath her water. \"Oh my god\" and quickly tried to jump back. \"Stand still Catherine I got you\" Butch said as he settled her back in the vent's floor. \"I almost fell down.\" \"You were lucky I caught you.\" They were looking at a precipice where the floor was the ocean. \"We're gonna have to jump\" Butch said. \"What?\" \"It's either that or taking the gas and be like Diggs here.\" \"Oh\" \"Listen it'll be alright grab on to me you'll be fine\" \"But what if there's rocks on the bottom?\" \"There won't be I promise now come on.\" She looked behind her. The gas was nearly upon them. \"I'll use my wings to fly us all outta here.\" \"Let's go\" Butch jumped with Diggs on his back. Catherine followed. She spread her backpack wings and dived to catch Butch and Diggs who were below her. \"Is anyone out there?\" Lou's voiced sounded on Diggs's comm. \"Hey signal's back. Lou this is Butch we are falling down\" he screamed at Diggs's comm. \"What? Repeat that.\" Then Catherine with both her paws took Butch and Diggs by their collars. \"You two need to lose some weight\" she complained as she carried them across the ocean. \"HQ get us transportation immediately.\" \"We made it out\" Butch yelled. \"That felt like they let us escape and let us find you on purpose don't you think?\" \"No we nearly died on that drop I don't think they expected us to escape that.\" \"I hope so.\" Catherine didn't seem satisfied. \"Lighten up we'll get Tinkles soon enough.\"[Chapter 10] Chapter 9 Trap is set \"They escaped?\" Tinkles asked with a hint of a smile. The dark room made his presence deadlier. \"Yes sir as planned\" Jackal said. \"Finally I'll be rid of those pests once and for all. Tell Poodle to start sneaking in the grain into the dog food. We will finally rule the world and see dogs bow to our paws\" Tinkles said with authority. \"Now that's the Tinkles I like\" Kitty said from a window above. \"Ha ha ha they don't know what's waiting for them. The world is nearly at my grasp.\" \"Um excuse sir your bed is ready\" Calico said. \"You fool you always interrupt my thoughts.\" \"Sorry but if you don't get there soon enough a mouse will take it.\" \"Ah Scrumptious\" Kitty jumped from the window and ran as fast as she could. \"You know Calico sometimes I don't know why I even have you here.\" ","Summary":" Cats and dogs The Return of Prologue Paris, France 2200 hours An orange cat was waiting, sitting in"},{"Movie":"Twister","Title":"Listen with all your heart, hold it inside forever","Author":"Twilightxxisnear","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4936265","Passage":"[Chapter 1] Sonafter a very long and painful writer's block I came out of myndaze!!!

Nonmatter how many times Beltzer asked himself these questions thenanswer to all of them was always yes. Beltzernlay in bed with Haynes in his arms just watching her sleep. Henwondered if she was dreaming and what she was dreaming about. Hencaressed her cheek and kissed her forehead. Beltzer knew how lucky henwas and didn't know how he ever survived without her. Haynes had itnall, beauty, brains, personality, and was as tough as nails. Beltzernslowly moved his arm out from under her so he wouldn't wake her butnhe failed miserably. \"Goodnmorning beautiful.\" \"Hello.nHow long have I been sleeping? I have so much work to do.\" \"RelaxnHaynes you were asleep for an hour and you haven't slept for days.nAnd you know, after great pleasure most people tend to fall asleepnfrom exhaustion.\" Beltzernsmiled at her as she was rummaging around for clothes with just ansheet around her. She smiled back and leaned over to kiss him. \"Inlove you.\" She said smiling. \"Ifnyou really loved me you would get back in bed and let yourself rest.\"nHe said patting the bed. \"BeltzernI have things to record and I need to see what's on the NSSL andnnot to mention…\" \"HaynesnI know you and I know there is nothing I can say right now to calmnyour nerves but I'm going to try anyways.

Hengot up and pulled on some pants before glancing back to see Haynesnrunning to the bathroom to put some clothes on. \"Thisnbetter be good.\" He said as he walked towards the door. Justnthinking it was another one of his storm chasing friends; Beltzernswung the door open and was surprised to see a familiar face that henhad not seen in awhile. A young girl none the less. Or young womannthese days. \"What…whatnare you doing here?\" \"Hindad. Long time no see.\"[Chapter 2] SonI am finally updating! Yayyy! PLEASE REVIEW! And enjoy!

Instead of her light brown hair it was now black, instead ofnher naturally beautiful face it was covered in make-up and her eyesnhad black eyeliner on them and she wore baggy pants and a bandnt-shirt with a choker around her neck. He stared at her shirt thatnsaid Van Halen and he knew he would have to keep dusty away from her.nBeltzer then finally looked in her eyes and was happy to see shenstill had the most beautiful brown eyes that reminded him of Haynes.nHe smiled and stepped forward to hug his daughter and much to hisnsurprise she obliged also stepping forward. Right at that secondnHaynes walked out of the bathroom. \"Dustynit's impossible to get any alone time with you around.\" Haynesnsaid walking towards the door. \"Beltzer! What's going on?\" \"Haynes!nNothing! This is um…This is Dixie.\" \"Yepnthat's me.

I mean Lisa.\" \"Nicento meet you.\" Haynes said even though she was still in completenshock. \"I'mnsure it is.\" Dixie replied sarcastically. \"Don'tnstart Dixie.\" Beltzer warned. \"Nonit's okay Beltzer. I understand completely where she is comingnfrom. I would probably say the same thing.\" \"Wow,nI like the new girl dad. She's got spunk.\" Dixie said with anlittle smirk. \"Okaynenough.\" Beltzer said, raising his voice. He grabbed Dixie by thenarm and pulled her outside leaving Haynes behind in the room. \"ListennDixie it's great to see you and I missed you but why are you here?nWhere's your mom?\" \"Can'tna girl just visit her dad? Is there a law against that up here?\" \"Nonthere's not but you have no right, no right to mock and insultnHaynes. She was nothing but nice to you and you treat her like dirt.\" \"I'mnsorry. I didn't know she was that important. You usually don'tnkeep them for that long.\" \"That'sna lie Dixie. You know she's that important and that's why you'rentreating her like crap. I know you're here to play matchmaker againnand you can just save your time. I'm in love with Haynes not yournmom!\" \"Wellnyou know what \"Beltzer\" that's perfect because you missed yournchance! Mom is dead!\" Dixienran towards her truck as fast as she could without looking back.nBeltzer ran after her not knowing what he was going to say but henchased her down anyways. Pleasenplease review!! :] :][Chapter 3] Here is chapter three! I hope you guys like this! Please review and let me know!! \"Dixie! Dixie wait!\" Beltzer yelled. \"No just leave me alone! You've made it pretty clear that you don't want me here.\" Beltzer finally caught up to her and spun her around before she could get in her truck. \"Dixie you know that's not true. I was just frustrated. What happened to your mom? I mean I just talked to her a few months ago.\" \"It was 8 months ago yesterday actually. I came home from school one day… and no mom. I looked everywhere and called everyone. But no one knew. So I called the police. Two days later, they find her body floatin' in the river behind our house.\" Dixie began crying as she finished her story. \"They said she fell off the bridge, hit her head on a rock, and drowned. So no more mom.\" Beltzer leaned in to hug his daughter but she was more reluctant this time. \"I don't want your sympathy. I just need a place to stay for awhile.\" \"Wait what happened to your stepdad and stepbrother?\" \"Well my asshole of a stepdad umm… ran off after he found out about mom.\" \"I see. So he took Ryan with him then?\" \"Well not exactly.\" She said. Dixie walked over towards her truck to the passenger side door and Beltzer stood back and watched to see what she was up to. She opened the door and there sat a little boy with blonde hair, blue eyes and looked to be about four or five. \"I know you guys have never formally met but dad this is Ryan, my half brother. He is only five and I have been taking care of him for eight months but I ran out of money and there was nowhere else I could turn. I remember you always told me you would always be here for me so I came to you daddy.\" \"Dixie did you take him?\" \"No no, John ran off, I couldn't just leave him. He is more than my baby brother dad. I have taken care of him more than anyone since he was a baby. He calls me mom on the off chance he does talk. But mostly he doesn't talk at all.\" Beltzer just stood there thinking about his precious nineteen year old daughter taking care of this little boy for five years. \"So what do you say dad? Do you think I could stay until I get a job that can support us.\" \"Honey you know that I would let you but were in the field right now so we never are in the same place. Hence why I'm staying in a hotel. And I don't know if that's such a good thing for you two. What about school?\" \"Well I got my GED about two years ago. And he's not ready for school. I mean I can barely get him to talk to me let alone anyone else.\" \"Well I'm sure we can work something out honey and you know I'm always here for you.\" Beltzer walked forward and took his daughter in his arms and kissed the top of her head. \"I love you Dixie.\" \"I love you too dad.\" Pleaseeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee review!!![Chapter 4] Thank you for the reviws LTJM and GryffindorPrincess23. They meannso much to me! So here's the next chapter and it might be boring to some but Inswear the story is going to get exciting very soon! I personallynthink it alreasy is exciting but for those of you who don't likenlovey dovey I promise it will be exciting soon!! Beltzer told Dixie to stay outsidenwith Ryan while he went back inside to talk to Haynes. He opened thendoor and scanned the room for Haynes. \"Haynes? Babe? Are you still innhere?\" Beltzer peeked around the corner andnseen that the bathroom door was closed and instantly felt relieved. \"Honey can I talk to you whennyou're done…Haynes? Babe are you in there?\" He opened the bathroom door and shenwasn't there but the window was wide open. Beltzer ran outside andnthought of who she would go to first. \"Dad what's wrong?\" Dixienasked when she seen him running out the door. \"Haynes…she's…she's gone.\" \"I am so sorry. This is all mynfault.\" \"No it's not I should have toldnher in the first place. Here's the key to my room. You two can gonahead and hang out in there and I will be back in awhile. I have tongo and find her.\" \"Alright thank you dad.\" Beltzer kissed Dixie on top of hernhead and ran down to Jo and Bill's room. He approached the door andnbefore he even knocked he thought to himself…\"Dusty.\" He walkednback a few doors down and knocked on room 201. Dusty swung the doornopen quickly and stood there with a very happy expression on hisnface. \"Dude I am so glad you are herenman!\" Dusty closed his door behind him and grabbed Beltzer's arm.n\"Dude I am so not good at the emotional women thin g…So she'snall yours.\" Dusty ran towards the other guys rooms and left Beltzernstanding there. He took a deep breath and opened the door. There,ncrumpled up on the bed, was the love of his life. He walked over tonthe bed and gently touched her shoulder. Haynes rolled over and wasnsurprised to see Beltzer. \"Hi honey. Where's Dixie?\" Shenasked. Beltzer sat down on the bed and putnhis hands on her face. \"Babe I can't even explain hownsorry I am that I didn't tell you but there was never a rightnmoment to do it in. I really love you a lot.\" Beltzer leaned downnand gently kissed her lips. \"Can you forgive me?\" \"I don't even know why I amnupset Beltzer. I mean she is your daughter. I just came into yournlife and I should not be jealous, it's just wrong. But I love younso much and I would never do anything to hurt you or your familynBeltzer and I hope you know that.\" Haynes gently smiled at him andnbegan to stand up when he pulled her back down to the bed. \"Lisa Haynes I never knew it wasnpossible to love someone as much as I love you, but I want you tonknow that love is infinate and just because my daughter is back in mynlife now doesn't mean that I am going to love you less. I love younmore with each passing day and that will never change.\" Beltzer and Haynes laid on the bednkissing for a few minutes when Dusty cam back into the room. \"Dude you totally gotta see thenhot girl that's in your room! She likes Van Halen and I think shenwas coming on to me! Aww man! Come on that's my bed! Go use yournown!\" He said. \"So who's the chick in your room?\" \"Dusty that would be my daughternand I can assure you that she was not coming on to you and nor willnshe ever.\" \"Oh wow dude come to think of itnshe just said Hi who are you. No coming on at all.\" Dusty quicklynsaid. \"Wait since when did you have a daughter? You two work fastnman.\" \"Dusty as always, you are sonenlightened sometimes.\" Beltzer said grabbing Haynes' hand andnleading her out of Dustys room. \"Thanks dude but this I alreadynknow.\" Please reviewwwww :][Chapter 5] As always…Thank you for the reviews LTJM andnGryffindorprincess23! You two are the hearts of my story! Here'snchapter five I hope you like it! And pretty please review!! Thanksnloves! Beltzer and Haynes both agreed thatnit had been a long day and that the kids should just get some rest.nThey went to the front office and got Dixie and Ryan a room rightnnext to theirs. \"Okay here's the key to yournroom. You two just get some rest and we will talk tomorrow. Soundngood?\" Beltzer asked. \"Yeah of course. And thank younagain dad, this really means a lot.\" Dixie smiled and then walkednover to Haynes. \"And Lisa I am sorry that I have been causing sonmuch trouble and I promise I will be nicer here on out. I was justngoing through a rough time. So I hope we can still be friends.\" \"Dixie you have nothing tonapologize for. As I said earlier I completely understand. Now you twonget some rest and we will start fresh tomorrow.\" Dixie hugged her dad and shooknHaynes' hand then picked up Ryan and walked back into their roomnfor the night. Beltzer and Haynes smiled at each other and thennsurrendered into their room for the night. \"So I have not heard Ryan talk atnall yet. That's not so normal with a five year old Beltzer. I was anpsychology major before meteorology and it seems to me that he hasnbeen emotionally abused. Or worst physically. And Dixie also showsnsigns of rebellion which could also show that she too was abused.\" \"No no, Dixie would have told menhoney. And that guy, what's his name…\" \"Jim.\" \"Yeah Jim, he was like a doctor ornlawyer or something. He is not the kind of guy that would abusensomeone. And I know their mother couldn't hurt a fly.\" \"Who better to do it then a doctornor lawyer though? You wouldn't have to take them to a doctor afternyou beat them up, or you could cover it up if you were a lawyer. I'mnjust saying, it's something you should at least confront hernabout.\" \"Okay babe. I trust your logic. Wenwill talk to them tomorrow. I love you.\" Beltzer deeply kissed Haynes andnpulled her close to him in the bed. Haynes turned out the light andnsnuggled in closely. \"I love you too.\" Morning came way too fast for Dixienand she knew she had to pull herself out of bed for Ryan's sake. Itnwas around eight in the morning and when she rolled over she seennthat Ryan was already awake and staring out the window. He lookednover and seen Dixie then pointed out the window. \"Good morning sweetie. Are younhungry?\" Ryan looked at her and shook hisnhead yes. \"Alright hon lets go try and findnsomething.\" Dixie took Ryan's hand and led himnout the door. She knocked on Beltzer and Haynes door and they quicklynanswered. \"Hey kids. Awake already. Inthought kids slept in?\" Beltzer said sarcastically. \"Yeah well Ryan was a littlenhungry so I was just wondering where I could get some food for him.nThen I need to take a shower and stuff.\" \"Of course. How about I get himnsome food and you can go ahead and do whatever you need to do.\" \"Well…I don't know. I don'tnthink it's such a good idea if I leave him right now.\" \"It will be okay Dixie, you neednyour rest.\" Dixie turned to Ryan and grabbed hisnhands. \"Honey will you be okay if unclenBeltzer takes you to get food. You can say no you just have to tellnme.\" Ryan looked at Dixie then at Beltzernthen back again. He looked like he was about to open his mouth tonspeak but then just looked at the ground and shook his head yes.nDixie smiled and kissed his cheek then stood back up. \"Dad, don't let him out of yournsight. And please, please don't say anything to upset him.\" Dixienwhispered. \"Honey I am a father.\" \"I know, I know. Alright I will benten minutes tops.\" Dixie smiled at them then verynslowly walked back to her room. Beltzer stood there for a minute andnthen Haynes came out. \"Hi Ryan I'm Lisa.\" Ryan glanced at her quickly thennlooked back down. \"Haynes I'm going to take him tonget some food now is your chance to talk to Dixie alone if you stillnwant.\" \"Alright I will meet up with younin a few minutes.\" \"Come on buddy.\" Ryan slowly followed Beltzer lookingndown at the ground. Please Review :][Chapter 6] Thanks for the reviews LTJM and GryffindorPrincess 23. You guys are great. Sorry this update took so long but I just moved from Michigan to Virginia and it to me forever to get hooked up to the internet. So I had it typed up I just couldn't post it :[ So this is like basically turning into a sitcom and I love it!! I had a dream that I made this into a television show. Some parts kind of reminds me of Friends lol. But the parts in this with Dusty are really funny and even the few times I read it, I laughed every time. It's pretty funny. Well I hope you all like it and as always, Review your little hearts out!! As Ryan and Beltzer walked away, Haynes walked towards Dixie's room. She quietly tapped on the door a few times and when no one answered she let herself in. She figured she would be sneaky and no one would even know she had been in there. She heard the shower running and she quietly looked through a stack of papers that were sitting on the table. A couple papers were, what looked like, old school papers, but when she got to the bottom of the pile she stood there in shock. There were tons of hospital papers and return requests for the ER. She quickly looked through them and seen, broken rib, fractured arm, broken fingers, and countless papers that showed there were countless reports filed to the police about bruising that looked to be related to physical abuse victims. Haynes didn't know what to think so she kept going through them. She came across one that looked like a birth certificate and sure enough it was Ryan's. Right then she heard the shower turn off and she quickly took one more close glace at it. She couldn't believe what she was reading but she stacked the papers back on the table when she heard the door opening. \"Oh hey Lisa, what are you doing here?\" \"Hey Dixie, I was wondering if I could talk to you for a minute.\" Dixie walked around the room looking for something in just a towel and didn't even realize that Haynes was staring at her and the countless fading bruises covering her back and upper arms. \"Well I guess so but it will cost you.\" Haynes was totally zoned out and didn't even realize Dixie was talking to her. \"Excuse me?\" She replied. \"It's just a joke Lisa.\" \"Oh alright, well anyways I had a few questions to ask you…\" \"You know what, can we talk about this later? I have to go make sure Ryan is alright and ask dad if he can watch him for a bit longer, I have plans with that funny guy that keeps staring at me all the time. He seems nice enough.\" \"Oh Dusty?\" \"Yeah right that's his name. I hope I don't forget again. He came up to me and said hey Dixie and I did the whole flipping the hair and flirting thing then said hey Rusty. I guess that's why he didn't say anything back. Talk about embarrassing.\" \"I don't think hanging out with Dusty is such a good idea.\" \"Why is he like a pervert or something?\" \"No not at all. But he's your dad's best friend and…\" \"And what? I should stay away from him so I don't risk ruining their friendship?\" \"No, I was just going to say be careful because if your dad finds out, it may be sweet death for your little boy toy.\" \"That's funny Lisa. But he's not my boy toy…Yet.\" Dixie smiled at her and went back to the bathroom to get dressed. \"So Dixie you know that me and your dad would love to watch Ryan tonight but it is storm season and I don't think it would be very safe to take him along if we caught one.\" \"Well I will only be with Dusty, he will know if you guys have to go work so I'm sure it will be okay.\" \"Alright well I am going to go find Beltzer and talk to him so we'll meet up with you in a bit.\" \"Alright, Oh and one more thing.\" \"Yeah?\" \"Thank you.\" \"Your welcome.\" Haynes walked out the door and Dixie went back to drying her hair and getting ready. As she walked along to the diner she thought about if she should tell Beltzer or not. On one hand it wasn't her secret to tell but on the other hand she was not Dixie's parent and Beltzer had a right to know. She also didn't want to have to hide anything from him. Haynes looked in the window of the diner and seen the love of her life sitting there next to the adorable blonde haired blue eyed boy that was not Dixie's little brother, But Dixie's four year old son. ____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ \"So you know Ryan, tornadoes are actually measured by how much they destroy which is called the fujita scale. An F5 is usually the strongest but…\" \"Honey are you really explaining this boring stuff to a four year old.\" Haynes said. \"Well I didn't know what else to talk about so I went with what I know most about.\" \"I see. Well Dixie wants to know if we will watch him tonight while she umm…does some things.\" \"What kind of things would that be?\" \"Okay don't tell her I told you and promise you won't freak out. Oh and also remember she is 19 and can make her own decisions now. She kind of has plans with…\" \"Dusty!\" Haynes looked at him, astonished that he guessed right away. \"Hey guys what's up. I just came to get some sustenance before we started working. I am starving.\" Dusty said. \"Hi Dusty, we were just about to leave. Come on honey.\" \"Wait you were about to tell me what Dixie had to do tonight. She has plans with someone, who?\" Dusty turned around in shock and looked at Haynes begging her not to say anything and since Beltzer's back was to him he didn't see anything. \"She has plans with…with me. She has plans with me.\" \"But I thought you said she wanted us to watch Ryan?\" \"Oh yeah, well must have slipped my mind. I'm just going crazy over no sleep you know.\" \"Alright well that's good, I am glad you two are bonding. Me and Ryan will just play some video games and I will show him Doppler's and stuff. Dusty will hang out too won't you Dust man.\" Beltzer smiled at him and finished drinking his coffee. \"Actually man, I um have to go into town for a little while and…um…pick up some stuff.\" \"Oh well we can go with you, it will be fun.\" \"No!\" Haynes and Dusty said at the same time. \"Okay here's the truth.\" Dusty said. \"I'm going to get you a birthday present man, and I don't want you to see it until your birthday okay.\" Haynes shook her head and sighed. \"Well Dusty, that's great but don't you think you could wait seeing as my birthday was 6 weeks ago.\" Beltzer questioned. \"Right…Okay you got me. I'm sorry.\" Dusty quickly thought of another excuse and without thinking he just blurted one out. \"Haynes is pregnant!\" Haynes' eyes got really big and she almost stood up and lunged towards Dusty ready to kill. But she just waited for Beltzer's reaction. \"What!!!!\" Beltzer jumped out of his chair and stared at both of them with a crazy look on his face. \"Dusty are you crazy!\" Haynes yelled. \"Yeah so I have to go get her…a umm…Ah! A pregnancy test! I promised her, and I can't break a promise.\" Beltzer stared at Haynes and Haynes stared at Dusty watching him motion for her to play along. \"Umm well Beltzer, remember how you said I was eating something weird the other day, well I thought I might as well check just to be sure.\" \"Haynes me saying that eating vegetables is weird does not mean I think your pregnant!\" \"I know Beltzer. But their have been other signs too.\" \"Really?\" \"Yeah! It's crazy.\" She quickly said. \"What are the other signs?\" \"Well…umm…Oh, just last night I had a dream that I killed Dusty in his sleep.\" She glanced over at Dusty and gave him an evil smile. \"You see, I am very hormonal.\" \"Babe I have dreams like that all the time, they don't mean anything.\" Dusty looked at them with his mouth wide open and his hands in the air. \"But you see you can't get pregnant Beltzer.\" Dusty said. \"Okay. I don't mind that you want to check and be sure but why did you tell Dusty and not me. I thought we told each other everything. Did you think you had to hide something like this from me?\" \"Of course not sweetie, you know I would never hide anything from you, I just…\" Right then Haynes stopped because she knew she was lying to him that very second. \"You know what Beltzer. I did hide this from you, and I feel completely horrible about it now and I'm sorry, I really am. I will never do anything like this again. I love you and you know that right?\" \"Of course babe. I love you too.\" Beltzer stepped forward and deeply kissed her for a few seconds before they heard Dusty speak up. \"Alright well you two seem pretty content now, Come on Ryan let's go find your sister.\" Dusty began walking out with the little boy slowly following him before Haynes quickly ran over and stopped him. \"Oh no you don't. Beltzer will go find Dixie with Ryan and we will stay here for a little chat Dusty.\" \"Ah I have some work to do Haynes maybe later…\" \"Oh Dusty, if you know what's good for you, you'll sit down right now.\" After those very stern words Dusty immediately walked over and sat back down in the booth. \"Wow Haynes I like this firm side of you. It kind of turns me on.\" Beltzer smiled at her and gave her a quick peck on the cheek before walking out the door with Ryan. Haynes walked back over to the booth and sat across from Dusty. \"So…Dusty…I was just wondering…Are you out of your freaking mind!! You can lie to your best friend all you want and I have no place to butt into that. But when you drag me into it and start lying on my behalf, that is just completely selfish and self-centered and…and…\" \"I'm sorry Haynes. I didn't think it would be that big of a deal.\" \"Well it is! This is my life you're messing with! Mine not yours! Do you realize that if he found out what was really going on, he could stop talking to both of us? You can screw with your friendship all you want but this is the love of MY life you are screwing with, so don't drag me into it!\" \"I want you to think about something Haynes. Even when I lied to him you played along. You could have just told him the truth but you covered up for me. Why?\" \"Because honestly, I thought you were going to man up and tell the truth for once. Guess I was wrong.\" And with those last words Haynes stood up and walked out of the diner leaving Dusty there to feel like a complete jerk. _______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Please Review :] Thanks loves![Chapter 7] Thank you for the review LTJM I'm glad you like it (ps the move was good lol thanks for asking.) Well here is chapter seven. Enjoy! And please review! _______________________________________________________________________________________ Dusty felt like a complete idiot. Not only was he now lying to him he was also trying to get with his daughter. Beltzer was the best friend Dusty could ever have and he was about to throw it all away for some girl. But Dixie was not just some girl. She seemed so different from anyone he has ever met, yet so sad and angry inside. And Dusty wanted to be the one to try and make it all better. \"Haynes! Haynes!\" Dusty yelled as he chased her down before she got back to her room. \"Dusty, I just don't want to talk to you right now.\" \"Haynes please, you don't understand why I have to keep this from Beltzer for right now.\" \"Dusty it doesn't matter. I can't live without Beltzer now, and if he finds out…\" \"Hey just listen to me for a minute. Beltzer would never ever leave you. He has been talking about you since the day he met you. Remember how every Valentines Day some weird guy named Billy sent you two dozen white roses? Guess who that really was. White roses are your favorite and Billy Applebee is your favorite actor. And you know how you got that ABBA cd one time and you thought someone was stalking you? It was him. He knows ABBA is your favorite singing group. He loves you more then you could possibly know, and something like this would never drive him away.\" \"But what about…\" \"Okay listen Haynes. Remember when Dixie was standing at your guy's doorstep? Remember when you found out she was really his daughter and he had kept it a secret. You came to me for help and comfort. Although I don't do that sort of thing you still came to me.\" \"Okay Dusty I see your reasoning. He really sent me all those flowers?\" \"Yep. Every year for eight years.\" \"God I love that man. Now tell me why you have to keep it from him for right now. \" \"Well I know it sounds kind of weird but there is something about Dixie that Beltzer doesn't know and I want to try and help her to see that she doesn't have to hide from her dad. I want to show her that Beltzer is the best person to help when it comes to problems.\" Haynes stood there for a moment wondering if Dusty knew everything that she knew or not. \"What doesn't Beltzer know?\" \"I'm not sure yet but I intend to find out. That's why I am going out with her tonight.\" \"Okay so you're not going out with her for your own personal reasons, it's because you want to find out what she's keeping from Beltzer.\" \"In a way yes but I also want to get to know her. She seems pretty amazing.\" \"You have no idea. Well I guess I can forgive you for now. But if this all blows up in your face then I had nothing to do with it.\" \"Done. Thank you so much Haynes. Well I have to go get ready for my date.\" Dusty gave her a big smile and started acting like a big shot which made Haynes roll her eyes. Just as Dusty started walking away Haynes stopped to tell him something. \"Oh yeah. Dusty? Remember how I had that dream when I killed you in your sleep?\" \"Uh yeah.\" \"Well since Beltzer isn't here to say this, just remember if you hurt her in any way or if you do something, anything, wrong my dreams might just start coming true.\" Haynes gave her very best stern look that always scared Dusty and didn't stop until he knew she was serious. \"You got it chief.\" Dusty smiled and ran back to get ready and Haynes stood there praying to god that she wouldn't regret this. __________________________________________________________________________________________________ \"Hey dad.\" Dixie said then she scooped up Ryan in her arms and began tickling him which made him burst out laughing but Dixie kept on doing it. \"Wow I think that's the most fun he has had all day.\" Beltzer said. \"Ah don't feel bad dad. He needs to get to know you first. Oh wait, you weren't lecturing him about weather like you used to do to me were you?\" \"Of course not.\" He lied. \"So I heard you and Haynes are going out tonight. What are you crazy ladies going to do?\" \"We are?\" Dixie said and just when she said it she seen Haynes signaling to her and right away she knew what it meant. \"We are I mean. Yeah were just going to do some shopping you know, have some girl time.\" \"Oh well that's good. Thank you for spending time with her Dixie, it really means a lot.\" \"Anything for you dad.\" Dixie put on her best fake smile and walked towards her room holding Ryan's hand. Beltzer turned around and started walking to his van when he seen Haynes was standing behind him. \"Hey pretty lady, what are you doing here.\" Haynes ran up and passionately kissed Beltzer which took him by surprise but he didn't care so he just kissed her back and wrapped her in his arms. \"What was that for?\" He asked. \"I love you more then words can possibly say Beltzer. I mean I love you so much it actually hurts.\" Haynes explained with tears beginning to form in her eyes. \"Baby its okay…wait your not breaking up with me are you.\" \"God no. I'm just saying that I never want to be without you ever again, I want to be with you for the rest of my life.\" \"Haynes, I would never be able to explain why I love you as much as I do, there is just so many things about you that I am in love with, that it would be impossible for me to tell you them all. I am going to love you forever and I always want you to remember that you are the best thing that has ever happened to me and I will never do anything to mess that up. I love you.\" \"I love you too.\" Haynes said almost bawling as she did. Beltzer pulled her in his arms and kissed away her tears as she sniffled into his shirt. He held her close and gently caressed her cheek then began to talk again. \"I'm just curious, but what brought this out?\" \"Let's just say we have a dumb friend who is much more loyal then we think.\" \"Ah so you've been talking to Dusty again. He always knows how to spill the beans.\" \"Yeah but I am really glad he did.\" \"Me too Haynes, me too.\" ","Summary":" Sonafter a very long and painful writer's block I came out of myndaze!!!

NB:nThis takes place from where Cheryl and Stan have just got free andnGracie is still stuck in the bottom of the ship. Cherylnstood at the edge of the water, waiting more and more nervously fornGracie to appear. \"What'sngoing on?\" Said a voice from behind her, making her jump. Shenturned around. \"EricnMatthews?\" She said, shocked. \"What are you doing here?\" Shenlooked slightly suspicious. This man had dumped Gracie, her bestnfriend, for no apparent reason. He wasn't someone she trusted thatnmuch. He shrugged. \"Wenwere brought in as back up.\" He said casually. He looked around,nand his expression changed from casual to concern. \"Where'snHart?\" Cheryl became even more anxious. It had been almost 10nminutes since she came out, and she guessed about 4 or 5 minutesnsince the boat had filled up with water. \"Shendidn't come back up.\" She said, trying to hold back the tears. Henlooked appalled. \"And nonone's gone down there?\" He asked. She shook her head, and withoutna second's hesitation, he dived neatly into the water. Gracienfelt her own eyes begin to fill with tears as she realised that thensituation was hopeless. She stopped tugging on the feather boa, andnclosed her eyes, waiting for death to take her. She thought back overnthe last couple of years, grinning at all the happy memories that hernworld famous undercover mission had brought her. She thought aboutnwhen she had stopped Cheryl being blown up, and nearly laughed outnloud at the irony. She had survived shoot outs and potential bombs,nand now here she was, dying because of a stupid feather boa. Suddenly,nshe felt a warm hand on her shoulder, and she turned round sluggishlynto find herself staring into Eric's eyes. He let go of her quickly,nand looked around. Gracie realised that he didn't know what wasntrapping her down here, and she quickly tugged on the feather boa,nshowing him how it was trapped beneath the canon. He nodded brieflynto show that he understood, and in one swift motion he pushed thencanon off the boa and she was free. Gracie letnEric take her by the hand and pull her through one of the portholes.nThey swam up to the surface, Gracie's limbs numbed from the lack ofnoxygen, and her lungs feeling as though they were about to burst. Hernhead broke through the water and she gasped for air, feeling herselfnsink beneath the water once more. She feltnstrong arms grasp her waist, and she was suddenly yanked out of thenwater. \"Hang innthere, Hart.\" Whispered Matthews in her ear, as the world becamenblurry, and then everything turned black…….

Thanks, and enjoy this part, I hope it is what you were hoping for. Gracie awoke to the dull sound of hospital machines bleeping in the background. She turned over slowly, her eyelids fluttering open. As the room slowly stopped spinning, she realised she was in a hospital room. The events of the night before came rushing back, and Gracie realised she must have passed out after coming up from the ship. Memories of Eric appearing behind her to save her flooded into her head, and she found herself wondering if it had been a dream. Why would Eric come back? He had broken up with her, so why had he even been at her mission anyway? Her train of thought was interrupted by a short knock on the door, before it opened to reveal a familiar face before her. \"Gracie!\" Cheryl squealed, \"You're awake!\" She ran over and gave her best friend a hug. \"We were so worried about you!\" Gracie managed a small smile. \"I'm ok.\" She said, her voice sounding a little horse. Cheryl beamed at her. \"Hang on, I just have to go and tell everyone that you're awake!\" \"Wait!\" Gracie called, her throat aching as she yelled. \"Who's everyone?\" But Cheryl had already gone. Gracie slumped back against the pillows and sighed. Moments later Cheryl came back in followed by Fuller, Stan, and, to Gracie's surprise, Eric. He stood back against the wall as Gracie was happily greeted by Fuller and Stan. While Fuller was a little gruff and withdrawn, Stan more than made up for it with his overenthusiastic greeting. \"Oh Gracie, thank God you're ok! You know, I was so worried when I saw you passed out! You saved our lives! I've never been more grateful. I thought we were goners!\" And on and on and on…… Stan just kept talking until Gracie finally tuned out, her eyes catching Eric's for the slightest of moments before he hastily looked away. \"Gracie?\" Stan asked \"Gracie?\" She turned back to look at him and smiled. \"Sorry Stan.\" She said sweetly, faking a huge yawn. \"It's just that I am kinda tired. I mean it's……\" She looked up quickly at the clock on the wall opposite. \"Nearly…. \"Her heart sunk \"Nine pm… but!\" She said, thinking fast, \"I do need my beauty sleep!\" The laughter that came out of her mouth was obviously fake, but Stan seemed too wrapped up in his own world to notice. \"Of course!\" He said \"We'll all just clear out, won't we?\" He said motioning to the others around him, who all nodded in agreement. As Stan left, Gracie managed to catch Eric's eye again, silently asking him to stay. He must have got the message, as he stayed where he was as the others went, closing the door after them as he silently walked over to stand next to her. It was funny, since he had broken up with her almost a year before, Gracie had bottled up so many things she imagined saying to him if by chance she ever saw him again. \"Why?\" \"What was wrong with me?\" \"How could you do this?\" But now, with him standing in front of her, his eyes looking at her but not quite meeting hers, all those words vanished, her hard exterior gone, and she was left once more as the simple girl, in front of the boy that broke her heart. In the movie, now would be the time that the guy confessed his hidden feelings to the girl, and she would throw her arms around him and forgive him, and they would like not-quite-happy-ever-after – but as close as you can get. As she looked sheepishly up at his brown eyes and ruffled hair, she felt her heart shatter once more into tiny pieces. Her throat went dry as she sought the word she needed. After several uncomfortable seconds, all she could come up with was \"Thanks.\" He looked at her oddly. \"What for?\" Now it was her to give him a strange look. \"For saving my life, what do you think?\" She returned, her hard exterior and bold demeanour returning, her voice dripping with sarcasm. \"Oh come on, Gracie. There's nothing to thank me for. I only did what I hope anyone would do- help a hero in trouble.\" He managed a small smile. \"Besides, it's my job, you know?\" Gracie's heart dropped. So that was all he was to her. Another assignment. So much for hidden feelings.[Chapter 3] Sorry.nSorry! Dodges rotten tomatoes and other vegetables being thrown atnher I'm so sorry it has taken me this long to update!! I've hadncomplete writers block, and, in the past couple of months, havenventured into the Harry Potter fan fiction world. And I can tell you,nit's so huge, it's pretty hard to find your way out! But, I did,nand so, to say sorry for my long absence, I leave with an especiallynlong chapter! Enjoy! Hensmiled at her once more before he closed the door behind him, leaningnheavily against the white walls, letting out a long breath he didn'tneven know he was holding in. Seeing the sadnlook behind Gracie's eyes had killed him. He knew henmust have hurt her a lot when he unceremoniously broke up with hernover the phone almost a year ago, but he knew that his reasons werenjustified… He hadn't been comfortable with where the relationshipnwas going, or the speed they were going at. Henliked Gracie a lot, and he still did, but he had panicked, just as henhad with two other relationships before Gracie in the last 5 years.nHe had asked for a transfer to another headquarters and tried tonforget Gracie, but it had been virtually impossible with her newnstatus as the face of the FBI. Whennhis team had been informed of the rescue mission that Gracie and henpartner, Sam Fuller, had undertaken to save CherylnFrasier, Miss United States, and the shows former host, Stan Fields,nEric couldn't stop himself volunteering to head a team to go in asnback-up. In his short time at his new headquarters, he had alreadynmade a good impression with his new boss, and he had grantednpermission to form a team, and so Eric drove down to the casino withnrelatively un-needed speed. His heartnhad immediately taken up residence in his throat when he scanned thenarea to see the two men being taken away by what he guessed were mennfrom another headquarters. The womannhe recognised as Fuller, Gracie's new partner he had seen on the TVnwith her a few times, was standing nearby Stan Fields, who wasnaddressing several men holding microphones out to him. While Ericncouldn't tell what Stan was saying, he guessed from his elaboratengestures that he was giving an overly dramatised account of his andnCheryl's capture and rescue. When hisngaze finally left Stan, he saw Cheryl standing by the water's edge,na blanket wrapped around her shoulders and a man with dark hairnstanding hesitantly a few metres behind her. His heart stopped. Hencouldn't see Gracie anywhere. He rannover to Cheryl and after casually asking her where Gracie was, shentearfully confessed that Gracie still hadn't come up from the shipnafter freeing herself and Stan. Eric's eyes widened. That must meannthat Gracie had been trapped in the sunken ship for more than severalnminutes. Henhad neatly dived down into the water, frantically swimming in anstraight line down to a window in the ship, squeezing his bodynthrough the small hole. He saw Gracie's form slumped over a fakencannon, not moving. He moved towards her and put his hand on hernshoulder, and she turned slowly, her eyes lit up with hope at thenprospect of help. Hencould see that her chocolate brown eyes were filled with confusion,nbut he let go of her and gestured aroundnthem, trying to ask her what was wrong. She tugged sharply on thenfeather boa that was attached to her outfit, and, with a nod, henpushed the heavy cannon off the boa. He turnednto her, to see that her eyes were half closed, and her mouth opennslightly, and he knew she must be suffering from the lack of oxygen.nHe took her warm hand in his own and pulled her gently but firmlynthrough the water to the porthole, letting her swim through first,nand then following her. As theynswam back towards the surface, he could feel her slowing down, andnguessing that her limbs were seizing up, found himself pulling hernthrough the water as she drifted, almost unconscious. He propellednhimself forward as fast as possible, he had to get her back to landnbefore it was too late.. And thennhe felt the air hit his face, and he knew he had made it. He justnhoped that it wasn't too late for Gracie. He tugged her out of thenwater as he felt her becoming submerged once more, and he saw Fullernand the man he had seen with Cheryl reach over the water to help pullnGracie out of the water as she slipped into unconsciousness. Beforenshe was pulled away from him completely, he managed to say into hernear, \"Hangnin there, Hart.\" His voice sounded gruff, and there was a tremor ofnworry in it as he saw her being lain down by Fuller and the man. Twonparamedics went racing over to her, checking her heartbeat andnpulling out medical equipment. As soon as the reporters noticed thenrush of activity, the camera's starting flashing and he was lost innthe hubbub. Now,nalmost two days later, and he had spent all his time at the hospitalnwaiting for Gracie to come round. He really didn't know what to do-nhis heart was telling him that he loved her with every fibre of hisnbeing, but his head was telling him to get of there before he gotnhurt as he always did. Usually henlet his head prevail in arguments like these (and it was scary hownmany there were between his head and his heart- he sometimes wonderednwhether he needed help) but he had seen the pain in Gracie's eyesnduring their brief conversation a few minutes ago- she was hurtingntoo. And it wasnhis fault. Hisnheart ached at what she must have been through due to his actions-nhow hurt and confused she must have been when he broke up with hernout of the blue after several wonderful months of dating.nHe stood up. For once in his life, he was going to follow his heart.nAnd damn his head to hell if he shouldn't; he didn't care. He leftnthe cafeteria and marched up the hallways towards the elevator. Henspent an uncomfortable few minutes in the small space with an oldnlady with a walker, who kept smiling toothily at him, her eyebrownraised. He focused his gaze on the top corner of the elevator,ntapping his foot, willing the damn thing to go faster. Finallynthe doors slid open onto the third floor, and he left the woman withnher walker and strode off towards Gracie's room. He spent a fewnnervous seconds standing outside her room, having doubts about goingnin. \" Oh,nmy God!\" His heart said, and henstarted. Ok, this was getting scary now. His heart had it's ownnvoice?! \"Just go in, man! You'renbeing stupid! What exactly do you think she's going to say?\" As crazynas it seemed, the voice was right. He took a deep breath and pushednthe door open, stepping inside. \"Gracie,\"nHe said, his voice sounding alarming high \"I'm sorry. I lovenyou.\" Oooh, cliff-hanger! Well, sort of. Thenbest I could think of, anyway. Review to find out what happens! And,nyes, I do plan to update within months, don't you all go worryingnyour pretty little heads over that! So, review! And, to sweeten thendeal, I am offering, in exchange for review, a declaration of lovenfrom which ever Miss Congeniality character you wish. Plus a box ofncookies. : )[Chapter 4] Ok,nso, yeah.. it's been a while. Sorry about that! But this a rathernlong chapter, and one that was really hard to write. Grrr. I hatendamn writer's block. I'll try and make the wait a little shorternbetween this and the next chapter, though I can't promise ornguarantee any thing. Sorry! Oh, and I apologize for the futilenattempt at humour at the beginning- I tried to lighten this chapternas the next few will probably be a bit more dramatic and angsty. Enjoy:) \"Gracie?nWho's Gracie?\" A voice mumbled from under the bed clothes. Eric'snbrow knitted together, perplexed by this odd response. Before hencould reply, a head emerged at the top of the bed, and Eric wasnsurprised to see the confused face of a seventy something womannpeering at him from the other side of the room, as opposed to thenrather more beautiful face of Gracie Hart. The old woman cocked hernhead slightly at him, her eyes still bleary from sleep. \"I thinknyou might have the wrong room, sonny.\" She said apologetically. Henfelt his cheeks flush with embarrassment, and he backed out of thenroom as quickly as possible, stuttering some fractured excuse thatnneither he nor the woman heard or understood. He pulled the white door closednbehind him, and buried his red face in his hands, admonishing himselfnfor his stupid mistake. He wondered how he made such an idioticnmistake, and kicked himself when he looked up at the numbers on thendoor and saw that in his rush to see Gracie he had not seen that thisnwas room 345, not the 445 that Gracie was in. Hengathered himself together, and strode off down the corridor towardsnthe staircase, taking the steps three at a time, not necessarily in anhuge rush to see Gracie, but more because he guessed that sooner ornlater his nerve would give out, and he was slouch home to collapse innhis apartment, not having the guts to at least talk to Gracie innearnest. Whennhe finally reached the door to Gracie's actual room, he found annurse just leaving, closing the door quietly. She turned back roundnand started slightly when she saw Eric standing close, his breathingnerratic and fidgeting as he waited to go in. She frowned at himnsternly, glancing down at her watch and back up at him, her finelynplucked eyebrow raised at him. He took the hint and looked down atnhis own watch, and realized with groan that it was gone nine o'clock. \"Visitingnhours finished more than two hours ago, Sir.\" The nurse informednhim primly, and he looked at her quizzically, \"But,nwhen Miss Hart woke up we were allowed in to see her, and that can'tnhave been more than an hour ago!\" He protested. Her eyes darkenednand her frown pulled tighter, and Eric swallowed nervously, suddenlynfearful of this woman in front of him. \"Nevernthe less, Sir, you must understand that those were unusualncircumstances, what with Miss Hart's condition.\" \"Butnsurely, five more minutes now wouldn't make any difference,nconsidering that we've already been to see her after hours anyway.\"nEric tried to reason, but the woman just shook her head. \"I'mnsorry, Sir, but I'm afraid that the Doctor's already given MissnHart some medication that should have her off to sleep within thennext ten minutes. She needs her rest.\" \"Can'tnI please just go in for ten minutes until she's asleep then?\"nEric pleaded, \"I need to talk to her about something reallynurgent.\" He saw the Nurse's expression relaxing slightly.n\"Please. I really need to talk to her.\" He crossed his fingers,nhoping that even if this didn't work, he could still pull the oldnexcuse of 'EricnMatthews, FBI.' However,nthere was obviously no need, as the woman sighed, but nodded, jerkingnher head towards the door. \"Fine.nBut I'll be waiting here, and only ten minutes, do you hear me? Otherwise I'll have security haul younout of here faster than you can flash that badge of yours at me.\"nSeeing his raised eyebrow, she laughed. \"I don't miss a thing,nme. I saw you persuading Nurse Green to let you in earlier.\" Henchuckled, but dodged past her into the room, pulling the door shutnbehind him. Obviouslyna little too loudly, according to the moan from the bed, as the bangnfrom the door hitting the frame resonated around the cold, quietnroom. His eyes were drawn to the moaner, and saw that Gracie's eyesnwere closed and her pale features looked peaceful for once in hernlife. She was asleep. Hensighed with disappointment, turning to leave again, but suddenly henheard her breathe something in her sleep. \"Eric...\"nShe whispered, her brow furrowing as she dreamt, and he spun backnaround to stare at her open mouthed. She was dreaming about him ? Afternall the crap that she'd gone through today, she was dreaming aboutnhim. It probably shouldn't have, but that thought alone brought ansmall smile to his face.. which quickly disappeared when he heard hernnext words; \"Eric?nNo, Eric, please, please don't go..\" Her face crumpled, and hernhand clutched at the white blanket covering her. He crossed the roomnand deposited himself in the green plastic chair (one of the hospitalnones that, in his meagre opinion, were made to become unbearably hardnand awkward after more than fifteen minutes spent in them; all partnof a hospital ploy to shorten the time people spent with thenpatients.) that was next to Gracie's bed. His body propelled intonauto- pilot, and his hand was suddenly smoothing Gracie's softnbrown hair out of her face, his other hand finding hers, his digitsnweaving themselves between her own slender fingers. His heart felt ansharp pang of regret, remembering what it felt like to be able to donthis every time he saw her- and with her conscious. Notnonly that, but to hear her upset over him, even if it was only in andream, was enough to tear away at his already tarnished heart anlittle more. \"Please,\"nShe whispered, grabbing his hand, \"Please, don't leave me, don'tnleave me alone again...\" \"It'snalright,\" He whispered, trying in a futile attempt to sooth her-nand himself. \"I'm here, I'm here now. I won't leave, Inpromise, I'll never let you go again.\" He gently rubbed her handnwith his thumb, her tiny whimpers quietening to almost non existentnsnuffles, until the only sound left in the room were the sounds ofnher heavy, even breathing. He spent a few minutes in silence,nwatching her frame move slowly up and down with each breathe,nwondering how such a powerful, confident woman could suddenly seem sonfragile and small. His thoughts were interrupted by the door creakingnopen, and he turned to see the face of the nurse who had let him in. \"Sir,\"nShe said quietly, \"It's been ten minutes.\" He smiled sadly andnnodded to her, getting up from his seat and reluctantly lettingnGracie's hand go. He bent down, and after hesitating for a moment,nplaced a quick kiss on her forehead. \"Bye,\"nHe whispered, smiling slightly at the sleeping woman. \"I'll benback tomorrow.\" Henleft the room, to find the nurse waiting for him, a knowing smile onnher face. \"Visitingnhours start at 10:30 tomorrow, Sir, but we're expecting somenjournalist in tomorrow to try and get something from Miss Hart aboutnthe incident today. It's probably going to get extremely crowded.\"nHe sighed, knowing how hard it would be to get to see her through allnof the media, with or without his badge. \"But,\" The nurse said,ngiving him an encouraging smile, \"If you could get here by aboutn9:45, I'll see what I can do.\" He grinned at her. \"I'llnbe here.\" Anfew hours later, Gracie woke up. She smiled, remembering her dream ofna warm hand in hers, soothing words and a soft kiss on her forehead.nShe found herself hoping that Eric might come back to see her, wishing that he would. EricnMatthews lay awake, counting the minutes until he could go and seenGracie- and hopefully try and explain things to her a little. Maybenshe'd give him a second chance. It was all he could hope for rightnnow. BrendanMackay wasn't used to being on the night shift at the hospital. Shensat in the reception, the room silent except for the sound of her pennrapping the desk every few seconds, or the occasional bored sigh. Itnwas a little before 3 am before she fell asleep. Shenwas completely oblivious to the four men slipping through the frontndoors and past her desk, down the corridor and up the staircase tonthe forth floor. Thennext morning, Eric was greeted with mayhem when he got to thenhospital at approximately twenty five minutes to ten. There werenhospital workers running around looking for this and that, and overnby the desk, he saw a woman in her fifties being interviewed by twonpolicemen in crisp uniform. He pushed his way through the crowd tonanother policeman by the door, and tapped him on the shoulder. \"Excusenme, but what's going on here?\" The policeman shook his headnregretfully. \"I'mnsorry, but I'm afraid I can't divulge that information to thenpublic right now.\" Eric sighed, reaching into his back pocket ofnhis jeans and pulling out his badge. He flipped it open in front ofnthe guy's face. \"AgentnMatthews, FBI. I'm gonna need you to tell me what's going on.\"nHe narrowed his eyes. \"Now.\" The policeman nodded, and gesturednfor Eric to follow him out into the corridor. \"Sorry,nit's best to talk in here where we won't be overheard by any ofnthe public- or the media, for that matter.\" He glanced aroundnnervously, checking that they were alone before he continued, \"Lastnnight, at around 4 am, we had a break in. We were short staffed withnsecurity, and we were missing our usual night time receptionist.\" \"Whatnwas stolen?\" Eric asked, and the policeman grimaced. \"It'snnot so much a case of what was stolen, but who. Last night, Gracie Hartnwas kidnapped.\" Hehe.nCliffie. :) Please review, but, you know, no pressure. I'm hardlyngoing to chase you down with a power drill. That's just reservednfor flamers. Thanksnfor reading! Ok, so, yeah.. it's been a while. Sorry about that!nBut this a rather long chapter, and one that was really hard tonwrite. Grrr. I hate damn writer's block. I'll try and make thenwait a little shorter between this and the next chapter, though Incan't promise or guarantee any thing. Sorry! Oh, and I apologizenfor the futile attempt at humour at the beginning- I tried to lightennthis chapter as the next few will probably be a bit more dramatic andnangsty. Enjoy:)[Chapter 5] AN: Bet you weren't expecting this to ever be updated! To be honest, I lost my muse completely until about six weeks ago, when the idea for the rest of this fic suddenly hit me and I ran to write this chapter on my laptop. The next part of the story is kind of shameful: I forgot my ffnet password. I know, I'm stupid. Sorry about that one, everybody! Still, hopefully you'll all enjoy this chapter as much as you have the rest of the fic! \"Kidnapped?\" Eric replied, completely astounded, \"But…how?\" The policeman sighed, wringing his hands together. \"Mr. Matthews, I'm sure—\" \" Agent Matthews.\" Eric snarled, and the policeman gulped, Eric plan to intimidate the lower ranked man clearly working. \"Sorry. Agent Matthews, I can assure you that we're doing our best to find out the answer to your question as we speak. We have a team spread throughout the building, checking for prints or anything else that can tell us where to start our search for Miss Hart.\" Eric checked his watch, shooting the man a withering look. \"You mean to tell me that Gracie Hart has been missing for nearly six whole hours, and you're still checking the place for prints?\" His voice full of barely masked disgust. The policeman tugged at his shirt collar, looking extremely uncomfortable. \"Well, she wasn't actually discovered missing until around seven thirty this morning, so—\" \"You mean that, despite the fact that Miss Hart is the face of the FBI, and therefore a most probably someone who should have someone outside her room at all time, let alone someone checking on her during the night, no one thought to see if she was okay until half past seven?\" The policeman sat up a little, narrowing his eyes at Eric's words. \"It isn't really up to us what the hospital choose to do with their staff, Agent Matthews. If you have a complaint about how Miss Hart was being treated, kindly voice it to somewhere who works here.\" He said coolly. However, Eric wasn't defeated, more than happy to let out his anger over Gracie's disappearance out on this man. \"I'm sure that if you'd wanted to, it wouldn't have taken a huge amount of effort to secure a couple extra people on security here; it wasn't as if you people weren't aware that she was a high risk patient.\" He said, the bite in his words silencing any argument the policeman may have been going to put forward. With that, Eric stood up abruptly, leaving the room, smirking when he heard the relieved sigh from the terrified policeman. \"And that is why I went straight into the FBI.\" He murmured to himself. -- Gracie's eyes cracked open, blinking slowly a few times until everything was no longer blurry. She went to lift a hand to brush her hair out of eyes, but was surprised to find that she couldn't move it. Still slightly groggy, she groaned quietly, struggling to try and lift her hands to her face. Finally, she looked down, and was confused to see that, not only were her wrists bound, but her whole body was tied up in thick rope, her ankles tied together ad her arms held tightly to her sides. She scanned the room, panicking when she realized that she was in a small, dank box of a room as opposed to her white walled hospital room. Her heart racing, she tried to cry for help, but her voice was still quiet from the drugs she'd been given the night before by the nurse at the hospital. She carried on in her attempts to shout, hoping her voice would grow stronger as she spoke, but broke up as the large door in the opposite corner of the room creaked open, a figure stepping into the doorway. -- \"What do you mean 'it's not our priority'?\" Eric shouted, slamming his fist down on the desk. McDonald sighed, running a hand over his face. \"In case you hadn't realized, Matthews, Gracie was let go from the FBI before she went missing. Therefore, she is not out priority!\" \"So what, we just leave her to be killed by these bastards?\" Eric said, unable to understand why McDonald would suggest anything of the sort. \"Listen, Eric.\" McDonald said, sitting back down. \"She's going to be found. Just because she's not number one on our list doesn't mean that there isn't anyone looking for her – you said yourself that there were people at the hospital searching for any evidence there was there. Just leave it to the police, Matthews.\" He let out a small smile. \"They're no FBI, that's for sure, but they're not completely incompetent. \"But, Sir—\" \"Leave it Matthews, unless you want to be the next FBI we have to dismiss.\" McDonald said firmly, and Eric let out a frustrated groan, slamming McDonalds' door on the way out. -- \"Is that Agent Foreman?\" Eric said, speaking quietly into the phone. He was sat on the floor by his desk, the phone pressed to his ear with one hand, the other holding a stack of agent files. The one on top read 'Agent 5678355: Foreman, Jeff'. Eric noticed the red 'Released' stamp on the top right hand of the paper, and wondered exactly how many people had been fired in the attempt to save Cheryl and Stan. \"Yes, who is this?\" A polite voice spoke down the phone, and Eric checked the notes he'd written for himself, all the while trying to keep himself hidden in the dark office. He'd had to wait until every other agent had left before raiding the massive archive of data for the files he wanted. \"This is Agent Eric Matthews. Have you heard about Gracie Hart?\" A sigh on the other end of the phone. \"Yes, it's been on the news today.\" \"I was wondering if you'd help be part of a team to try and locate her. The FBI aren't even going to get involved, so I'm going to try and find her myself. I know you helped her with finding Fields and Fraiser, so I was hoping you'd be willing to help now.\" There was a slight pause down the end of the phone. \"Count me in.\" Eric grinned, putting a tick next to Foreman's name on the list, directly below the one he's put by Sam Fuller's just minutes ago. \"Fantastic. Now, here's what we're going to do…\" -- \"Good morning, Miss Hart!\" The man said, stepping into the room and shutting the door behind him. \"I hope you had a pleasant night.\" He said, his words laced with sarcasm. \"Who are you? Why are you doing this to me?\" She asked, her voice still weak. The man laughed loudly, coming closer to her. \"Who am I?\" I'm sure the name I go by now won't mean much to you, Miss Hart, but I never was one to turn down a simple question from a pretty girl. My name is David Martin.\" He waited a few seconds. \"No, I didn't think you'd recognize it. It wasn't the name I was born with, you see. It would have been far too difficult to make it own my own if I'd kept my family's name, so I changed it.\" He grinned, his smile a little too wide and making Gracie shrink back. \"I think you may be more familiar with my real name, , my surname, anyway. So let me introduce myself properly.\" He crouched down and extended a hand to her. \"Hello, Grace Hart. My name is David Morningside.\" You know what I love ? Reviews.

PROLOGUE: A CHANGE OF FATE \" For we are saved by hope: but hope that is seen is not hope: for what a man seeth, why doth he yet hope for? \" Romans 8:24 Wakita, Oklahoma June 2, 1969… A storm was raging over most of Kingfisher county, and in one of the farm houses, a man poured himself some coffee in the kitchen before heading into the living room, where the black/white TV was on the weather and there was a tornado warning flashing across the screen. `\" … by radar now. There it is. The center of the circle over Kingfisher county, moving northeastward….a little bit earlier….tornado warning continues now, it's been extended officially …\"` Upstairs in a bedroom, five-year-old Jo was sleeping in her bed with the family dog, Toby, sleeping at her feet. A loud crash of thunder woke her up, and she was sitting up when her mother hurried into the bedroom. \"Jo? Common',\" she said, doing her best to remain calm, but it was clear that she was on the verge of a panic attack as she scooped her daughter out of the bed, along with her Raggedy Ann doll. \"What is it, Mommy?\" Jo asked. Her mom didn't know how to answer the question since there wasn't that much time to get out of the house. \"Common' sweetie, let's get up. Common'. It's okay.\" She carried her daughter out of the bedroom and down the stairs. Toby was left on the bed. \"It's okay.\" Halfway down the stairs, Father met them, carrying a blanket. \"We need to get down to the storm cellar right now,\" he said as he hurried them down the stairs and toward the front door. \"TV says it's big. Might be an F5.\" His wife nodded. \"Okay, we're going to the storm cellar.\" Jo, however, realized that their dog wasn't with them. \"Toby?\" she called out as they headed outside. They run out of the house, where things were exploding because of the lightning, and items were falling all around them. \"Hurry, we've got to move!\" he called out, grabbing his daughter. \"Hand her to me! Common', let's move!\" The mother gave Jo to the father, and they kept running. Eventually they got to the storm cellar, which was a door in the ground. Back inside the house, Toby ran downstairs, passing the TV where the weather man was instructing people to either hide in their cellar or basement, or in the center of the house if they didn't have either to hide in, and out of the house. Jo's mother cringed as the lightning destroyed things around them. \" AHHH! We're almost there, we're almost there!\" \"Take her, take her!\" Jo's father shouted, handing her back to her mouther. \"I gotta get the door! Hurry! Let's go!\" He pried open the storm cellar door, and they get inside, where he slammed the door and closed the latch. Unaware that Toby had just ran up and was pawing at the door, trying to get inside. Jo, however, knew that their dog was still out there with the incoming tornado. \"Daddy, daddy, Toby's still outside!\" Her father unlatched the door and opened it. \"Common' Toby, common' boy!\" Toby jumped inside, and he shut the door once again, latching it. Jo scooped the small dog into her arms. \"It's okay, Toby.\" Her mother lighted a kerosene lamp and they sat on a wooden bench together, waiting for the tornado to pass. Suddenly, the door began shaking violently, and there was a loud roaring, like a freight train nearby. \"Daddy!\" Jo whimpered as debris flew past the window above their heads. \"Grab Jo, honey!\" her father ordered before climbing up the stairs and he pulled the handle toward him in order to keep the door closed. \"Take Jo!\" Jo was whimpering as her mother held her, watching fearfully as the door kept shaking, and it was clear that the tornado had stalled nearby. Her father grunted as it became harder and harder for him to keep the door shut. Harder. \"I can't hold it! DEAR GOD! \" he shouted, clinging to the handle as the door kept shaking and the hinges and latch were starting to break loose. \" OH, GOD!I CAN'T HOLD IT DOWN! AHHHHHHHH! \" And he screamed as the door was ripped free by the tornado, taking him with it. Screaming, he disappeared into the twister. Jo and her mother were screaming in horror. Pulling free of her mother's arms, Jo ran forward to the doorway flailing her arms at the now open doorway. \" DADDY! MY DADDYYYYY! \" However, her mother pulled her back, and held onto her tightly, as the twister disappeared into the night. The next morning, Jo and her mother climbed out of the storm shelter with Toby running ahead, and they stared at the devastation left behind by the tornado, which included the barn and the house. Their neighbors came out of hiding to help them search for anything that might've survived, and it wasn't long before the body of Jo's father was found ten miles away. He had been found in a ditch, still holding onto the door, and Jo made herself a vow then and there, that she would chase after tornados and make sure that no one else had to go through what she went through. She was going to save lives. A/N: I hope you all enjoy this until next time.

I would also like to take a moment to remember the people who were killed in the shooting in Las Vegas, and the people who risked their lives to save as many people as they could.

CHAPTER ONE: MEETING THE TEAM AND DOROTHY \" And if he or she confess not thou shalt deliver him or her up unto the church, not to the members, but to the elders. And it shall be done in a meeting, and that not before the world. \" D&C; 42:89 Norman, Oklahoma June 17, 1996… At the National Severe Storm Laboratory (NSSL), the staff were gearing up for a busy day since there were a number of storm cells converging on the state, and that meant that there was a strong possibility of there going to be a lot more tornadoes then usual. \" At 7:00 a.m. in Oklahoma City, the temperature is 75 degrees. Across the state, skies are partly cloudy, the dryline higher over western Oklahoma. Satellite pictures indicate thunderstorms developing …\"` As more reports came over the radio, two of the staff members, Murphy and Bryce were looking over data on one of the computers. \"Bryce, take a look,\" Murphy said, showing a picture to her. \"Caps are starting to break.\" \"All the models are forecasting lifted indexes from minus six to minus ten,\" Bryce remarked, examining the photo. Murphy nodded. \"You know if these cells keep building like this we could have a record outbreak of tornadoes,\" he remarked, eating a doughnut. Bryce sighed. \"This is gonna be a long day,\" she muttered, drinking some tea. In a different part of the state, a red Dodge Ram pickup truck was driving down a dirt road with fields of either wheat or corn on either side, along with the occasional oil drill, and a crop duster flew by, spraying one of the fields. In the truck, Bill Harding was driving the truck and seated next to him was his fiancée, Melissa Reeves. \"Um, honey, are you sure she's gonna be here?\" Melissa asked as she pocketed her cellphone, having just talked with a patient. \"If I know Jo, she's already dragged her entire department into the field,\" Bill assured her as he drove down the road. Earlier he'd called the university that his soon to be ex-wife, Jo Harding, worked at, and learned that she was out in the field, preparing for the upcoming tornado season. \"Ah, hell, a day like today, it's to be expected. She forgets everything except her work,\" he added. Melissa looked at her future husband thoughtfully. \"You're nervous about seeing her, aren't you?\" she inquired. \"Nervous?\" Bill repeated, surprised. \"No. Why, do I look nervous?\" \"No. Well, yeah you do, a little,\" Melissa admitted. Bill sighed. \"I just want to get it over with.\" Melissa nodded thoughtfully. \"But she said she signed the papers, right?\" she asked, referring to the divorce papers that Jo had been given back in December. \"That's what she said,\" Bill confirmed. Melissa didn't look convinced. \"You don't think so?\" \"No, I think so,\" Bill reassured her, gently squeezing his hand. \"Give me a kiss.\" And they exchanged a kiss before returning his attention to the road. Meanwhile in a field, there was a collection of vehicles, ranging from a station wagon to a large bus. 32-year-old Jo Harding was on the roof of a blue van, trying to get the Doppler radar dish to work, and inside the van, Tim \"Beltzer\" Lewis, was working on the wireless connection. \"Okay professor, hang on there, I think I fixed it,\"` he called out, knocking on the ceiling of the van. \"`I've got it.\"` Jo tried turning on the Doppler radar dish, and she winced away as sparks flew out. `\"Oops .\"` \"Oh, crap!\" Jo shouted, frustrated since this was the fifth time that week that the radar had failed to work. \"This thing is useless!\" `\"Sorry, Jo,\"` Beltzer apologized. Jo blinked when the radar suddenly started working and turning on its own. \"Wait, wait, wait. Beltzer!\" she exclaimed, banging on the roof with her fist. \"That's good. Give me a reading!\" Opening the side door on the van, Beltzer climbed out of van. \"Okay, boss lady, hold your horses,\" he grumbled and went over to a laptop that connected to the Doppler, and his wife, Haynes, was there. \"Which way do you want it, Jo?\" Jo peered into the distance, where there was a large buildup of nasty-looking storm clouds. \"Looks like the dryline has stalled,\" she called out. \"Give me a sector scan west, northwest, look at mid-levels for rotation and increase the PRF.\" While this was going on, Dusty Davis was inside his bus, which was filled with monitoring equipment, and on one of the screens, a music video started playing as he sang a long a little before blowing a raspberry. He jumped out and he looked up at the speakers as the song played over the sound system. `\" If I mistreat you girl, sho' don't mean no harm …\"` At the second van, which was a sky blue with the Angel Moroni painted on both sides, the Martin sisters, Elle and Maxine Martin, had equipment set up on two folding tables, and they were arguing when one of the computers suddenly got the blue screen of death. \"Dang it! Max I thought you installed the new system before we left home!\" Elle complained, throwing a crumbled ball of paper at her sister's head. \"I did!\" Maxine objected. \"It ain't my fault that they gave us a PC instead of the Mac!\" Another argument was going on at an old ford bullnose F150 between Robert \"Rabbit\" Nurick and Sanders, who were in charge of making sure that the team could take the best and quickest routes to the tornadoes once they'd touched down. \"All I'm saying is don't fold the maps!\" Rabbit scolded his friend as they went to a table they'd set up to study the maps. \"I didn't fold the map!\" Sanders protested, drinking a diet coke. Rabbit shook his head and held up a map that'd been clearly folded. \"Yeah, well Kansas is a mess, there's a big crease right through Wichita-\" and he tossed several rolled maps onto the table. \"Roll the maps.\" While all of this was going on, Bill and Melissa drove up and parked not far from the team. \"What do you know, the storm chasers,\" Bill called out as they got out of the truck. Rabbit and Sanders ran up to greet them. \"Hey, I don't believe it! Who is that handsome devil!\" Bill grinned and shook hands with them. \"Gentleman.\" Dusty spotted them, and he was excited when he saw Bill. \"The Extreme!\" he shouted, acting silly and grinning widely. \" IT'S THE EXTREME! \" And he laughed, thrilled. Bill chuckled, used to his friend's antics. \"Oh man, don't start that shit!\" Dusty gripped his friend's hand tightly, still grinning madly. \"Oh manly hand shakin' Zeus. How you doin', man?\" he asked. \"Doin' great, doin' great,\" Bill answered as they did a man hug. Dusty was still laughing. \"Oh bad!\" \"Dusty, I'd like you to meet Melissa,\" Bill said as Melissa walked over to join them. \"Melissa, this is Dusty. Dustman's been chasing with us ever since we started.\" And they shook hands. \"Listen man, where's Jo?\" he asked. \"She's over by Doppler,\" Dusty answered, nodding to the blue van, where Jo was still on the roof with said radar. \"Broke down again, running out of grant money.\" ' Running out of grant money, again?' Bill thought as he turned to Melissa. \"Honey, why don't you hang out here for a little while, I'll – I'll be right back,\" he suggested. Melissa nodded as Dusty took her hand, making her flush a little. \"Okay.\" \"Dusty, why don't you explain to Melissa…why you are the way you are?\" Bill suggested and they exchanged ridiculous faces and laughed as Dusty did a silly dance that caused Melissa to giggle. Dusty shook his head as he lead Melissa over to the bus. \"Come on. Man. Jo's gonna wig when she sees he's back.\" Bill, who was walking over to where Jo was, called after him, annoyed. \"I'm not back.\" Jason \"Preacher\" Rowe, who was giving his station wagon a tuneup, turned and beamed when he saw Bill. \"The prodigal son returns!\" Bill exchanged a few words with him, waved hi to Elle and Maxine, who waved back with delighted expression, and as he passed by Joey, who's holding a weather instrument and writing down data on a clipboard, he patted his shoulder. \"Hiya, Joey.\" Joey blinked and looked up from his work, surprised. Hey, Bill.\" Bill walked up to the van as there was a rumble of thunder in the distance, and he looked up at Jo, who was crouched behind the radar, which was scanning the sky. \"Hiya, Jo.\" Jo peered from behind the radar and she grinned, having been expecting him. \"Hey, Bill. I'm happy you found us.\" \"How you doin'?\" Bill asked, doing his level best not to admire her in her white tank top and the tanned jumpsuit wrapped around her waist. Jo straightened up as she looked at Bill, and then she nodded at the sky. \"It's goin' good. You see the sky today?\" she asked. Bill nodded. \"Yeah, she's, uh – she's really talking.\" Jo tossed him a cord. \"Catch.\" Bill caught it and gave her an annoyed look as she jumped off the van.\" It's the biggest series of storms in 12 years,\" she explained as she lead him over to where the laptop was set up, and the Lewis' greeted Bill. \"One lined up right after another. And NSSL says they've never seen anything like it.\" Bill sighed, handing the cord to Beltzer, trying not to show his interest in what she was saying. \"Is that right? So, Jo, about the divorce papers-\" he began. \"Hey, Jo?\" Brian Laurence called out from his van, holding up a camera. \"Come here a second!\" Jo sighed. \"Oops.\" And she went over to him. \"Oh. Yeah, yeah sure,\" Bill grumbled, heading after her, needing to get the divorce papers as soon as possible. Laurence handed her the camera. \"Hey, you know, this thing's acting up again, this thing-\" \"Focus mount's jammed,\" Jo interrupted, finding the problem. \"There's grass in the auto-focus, did you check this? You have to check it.\" And she blew the grass out. \"I'll check it- you want me to clean it out?\" Laurence stammered, flushing at his mistake as he took the camera back. \"Not unless you want to sketch the tornadoes,\" Jo teased, walking past Bill and she headed back to the laptop. Laurence saw Bill and smiled. \"Hey, welcome back, Bill.\" Bill rolled his eyes as he backtracked. \"I'm not back.\" Jo was wiring the laptop to the radar when Bill rejoined her. \"So, you want the papers?\" she asked, glancing at him. \"I did drive all the way out here for them,\" Bill replied, annoyed that she was being stubborn. Jo nodded. \"They're signed and ready.\" \"Good, good. Let's see them,\" Bill requested, wanting to get out of there. Jo looked at him questioningly. \"What, you need 'em right this second?\" Bill nodded. \"Well, It'd be nice.\" Jo smirked. \"What's the urgent urgency, you act like you're getting married-\" \"I am,\" Bill interrupted. Jo blinked, masking the fact that she was disappointed to hear that he was getting married again so soon. \"Wow.\" Bill nodded. \"Yeah.\" Not letting on how upset she was, Jo headed for her truck to get the papers, and he followed her. \"Is it Melinda?\" she asked, trying to recall the name of the woman he was going to marry. \"Melissa,\" Bill corrected. \"Melissa,\" Jo muttered to herself and then glanced back at him. \"Wasn't there a Melinda in there somewhere?\" Bill shook his head as they reached the yellow truck that had a tarp covering the back. \"No, there's only been Melissa since you. \"Boy, not much for browsing, are you?\" Jo asked as she grabbed the papers out of her glove compartment. \"No, I guess I'm not,\" Bill admitted. Jo handed him the papers. \"There you go.\" \"Thank you,\" Bill said and he promptly flipped through them to make sure they were all signed. Jo shut the glove compartment and then put her graduation ring over her wedding ring, a symbolical way for her to feel like she was still married. Bill reached the last page and paused. 'Seriously?' \"Whoa, whoa, whoa. You missed a page,\" he announced, showing her the paper. Jo looked at him, pretending to be surprised. \"What?\" Bill pointed to the last page, which had his signature on it, along with the signature of the divorce lawyer, but Jo's signature was missing. \"Right here.\" Jo took the papers back, and she made a show of looking through the papers. \"Where'd this come from?\" she wondered and she proceeded to read the last page, hunched over the hood of the truck. \"What are you doing?\" Bill asked, exasperated. \"Can I read it first?\" Jo requested. \"No!\" Bill protested, annoyed with her attempts to stall. \"It's the same as it was in December.\" Jo grinned and lied through her teeth. \"I didn't read it in December.\" Bill groaned and held out a pen to her. \"Christ, would you just sign it so we can get out of here? Please? \" \"We?\" Jo repeated, blinking. \"She's here?\" \"Yes, she's here, she's over with Dusty,\" Bill confirmed, exasperated. \"Now would you please sign the document?\" \"You left her with Dusty?\" Jo teased, enjoying his annoyance. \"What's the matter with you?\" And she walked away, leaving the papers on the hood of the car. \"What are you doing?\" Bill called after her. \"I want to meet her,\" Jo replied, heading for the bus. \"No you don't,\" Bill protested, moving after her, and then he went back to get the papers, frustrated. \"Christ.\" Over at the bus, Dusty and Melissa were sitting on a pair of folding chairs under a colorful beach umbrella, and Melissa was entranced by what Dusty was telling her concerning tornadoes as they sipped two fruit drinks he'd mixed up earlier. \"The suck zone- it's the point- basically at which the twister sucks you up, but it's not that technical therefore obviously, but-\" he was saying. Jo walked up at that moment. \"Hi,\" she said and Melissa jumped a little, returning to the present. \"I'm Jo Harding.\" Melissa quickly got up. \"Oh, hello, nice to meet you.\" And they shook hands as Bill caught up. \"Bill just told me the happy news,\" Jo added, hiding her disgust for the dark-haired woman. Melissa blinked. \"Which?\" \"Us, marriage,\" Bill reminded her and did the introductions. \"Jo, Melissa.\" \"It's happy news,\" Jo remarked. Melissa nodded. \"I guess, uh, it probably seems kind of sudden.\" \"Seems sudden?\" Jo repeated, looking between them questioningly. Dusty, who'd been wearing goggles over his eyes, lowered them with interest. \"Dude, you takin' the vows? That's sweet!\" he joked and grunted when Jo kicked his leg. \"Well, we- we just wanted to get it done before Billy started his new job,\" Melissa explained, slightly embarrassed. Jo nodded, having heard about the upcoming job back in December when she first got the divorce papers. \"That's right, that's right, right, right, right. Weatherman!\" Bill was immediately offended. \"What?\" Jo looked at him innocently. \"What?\" Bill glowered at her. \"Say it.\" Jo shrugged, still wearing an innocent expression on her face. \"I said weatherman, I think it's great.\" Bill didn't believe her for a second. \"How come you had that tone?\" he demanded. \"There was no tone if you have a problem being a weatherman,\" Jo assured him. \"I don't have a problem being a weatherman,\" Bill protested. The possible argument was interrupted when Melissa's cellular phone started ringing. She fished through her purse to get it, and then she answered it. \"Excuse me. Dr. Melissa Reeves here? Uh-huh?\" \"Just wanted to say hello,\" Jo told her, earning a nod, and then she went to check out the red pickup. While listening to the patient on the end of the phone call, Melissa made a signal to Bill if Jo's signed the papers yet. Bill shook his head, frustrated. \"What? No!\" And he hurried after Jo. Jo circled the truck when he reached her, and she was impressed by what she was seeing. \"New truck?\" she asked. Bill nodded. \"That's right.\" \"Boy oh boy. New job, new truck, new wife… it's like a whole new you!\" Jo said sarcastically, hiding her disappointment. Bill sighed. \"Jo…\" \"This is very awkward,\" Jo admitted. \"I know, tell me about it,\" Bill agreed. \"I thought you'd be coming out here alone,\" Jo added, which was true since she hadn't expected to meet the woman who was going to replace her. \"I wasn't expecting on coming out here at all you said you meet me-\" Bill began. \"It's about Dorothy,\" Jo interrupted. Bill stared at her for a long moment. \"Dorothy?\" he repeated. \"What about her?\" Jo grinned, knowing that she had him hooked. \"She's here.\" Bill's eyes widened as the words sunk in. \"Show me.\" Jo lead Bill back to her truck, where she removed the tarp to reveal a large metal container covered with red warning lights and gages. It had DOROTHY written on one side with the roman numeral for one and also had a picture of Dorothy Gale on it, too. \"I can't believe you did it,\" Bill said, staring at it in amazement. \"We built four of 'em,\" Jo added, and her grin was growing bigger. \"She work?\" Bill asked, unable to hide his eagerness. Still grinning, Jo lowered the tailgate, enabling Bill to climb up, and he began examine the instrument. \"Thought you'd want to be here for her first time out,\" she pointed out. \"It wouldn't be right if you weren't here.\" And the whole team ran over, excited to see Bill next to Dorothy. Joey laughed. \"This is gonna be good!\" \"I can't wait to see her in action,\" Elle agreed. Maxine nodded. \"Same here, especially after all the work we put into building them.\" Dusty brought Melissa over to the truck, and he referred to Dorothy. \"How sweet is that? Bill's concept man. Boom! The extreme. Man, it came from his brain,\" he said proudly. Bill flushed a little. \"I had a hand in it.\" \"Wow, it is great,\" Melissa remarked, although it was clear that she was confused. \"What is it?\" \"It's an instrument pack for studying tornadoes,\" Bill informed her. \"First one in history.\" \"It's very exciting,\" Jo explained, climbing into the truck so that she was standing next to Bill and Dorothy. \"Scientists have been studying tornadoes for ever, but still, nobody knows how a tornado works,\" she continued. \"We have no idea what's going on inside because no one's ever been able to take scientific measurements from inside the funnel. That's what she's gonna do.\" That kinda made sense to Melissa. \"How?\" \"We put her up inside a tornado,\" Jo explained and pushed a button. \"She opens up,\" the lid opened, almost hitting Bill \"and releases hundreds of these sensors.\" She took one out and handed it to her. \"That measure all parts of the tornado simultaneously.\" Melissa examined the sensor, which made her think of a Christmas ornament, and handed it back. \"You see, Melissa, it's like this,\" Bill explained, picking up one of the sensors and demonstrated how it would go up into the tornado. \"These sensors go up the funnel, and radio back information about the internal structure, wind velocities, flow, asymmetry. We could learn more in 30 seconds than we have in the past 30 years. Get a profile of a tornado for the first time.\" Now that made more sense to Melissa… kinda. \"And what will that do?\" she inquired. \"If we knew how a tornado really worked, we could design an advance warning system,\" Bill answered. \"Aren't there already tornado warnings?\" Melissa asked. Bill shrugged. \"Well the-\" \"They're not good enough, they're nowhere near good enough,\" Jo interrupted with an intensity that surprised the dark-hared woman. \"Right now, it's 3 minutes. If we can get this new information, we can increase warning time to 15 minutes.\" \"Give people a chance to get to safety,\" Bill added. \"At least that's what these guys are trying to do!\" And the team yelled and cheered. He jumped down, and Beltzer helped Jo down. \"I can't believe you actually did it,\" he praised. Jo flushed, pleased. \"Well, we\" she referred to the team \"did it.\" \"How do you get it in the tornado?\" Melissa asked since that hadn't been explained yet. \"Well, you got to get in front of the tornado and put it in the damage path,\" Bill explained. \"And then get out again before it picks you up too.\" And he agreed with his fiancée's concerned expression. \"It's the suck zone!\" Dusty whispered into her ear. Melissa was startled when he did that. \"Ohh.\" In the mean time, Haynes had been on the phone with the weather beauru. \"Excellent!\" she exclaimed, getting their attention as she hung up the phone. \"Jo, we got major action! The NSSL says the caps are breaking, the tower's going up to 30 miles up the dryline!\" Jo looked up at the sky, and then at Bill. Suddenly focused, she slammed the tailgate shut. \"All right, let's go!\" And the team headed for their respective vehicles. \"All right, we're movin'!\" \"It's fatty time!\" Soon, they all were scrambling to pack everything back in their vehicles. \"Jo, we got it!\" \"Rabbit, you're up. Let's go, let's go. Hurry up, we haven't got all day, let's go!\" \"Joey, Haynes, a little help?\" Beltzer called out to Joey, who ran over, just as he tossed down the Doppler. \"Yes, sir,\" said Joey, catching the Doppler, and Haynes helped him store it into the van. \"Right behind you.\" Dusty was tossing all his beach stuff in his bus, and Joey and Haynes give a \"mutual fingersnap\". \"Smooth!\" Haynes was soon busy searching for whatever she hasn't packed. \"Where is it? There it is!\" \"We're all ready here!\" Elle called out as she and Maxine finished packing up their gear and climbed into their van. \"The Moroni Mobile is ready to go!\" \"Common' Dusty, you're always the last one to go!\" Rabbit called out to Dusty, who was tossing the last of his beach gear into the back of the bus. \"All right, Beltzer. Preacher, follow!\" Haynes ordered. \"Laurence, don't forget the camera!\" Jo called out, pointing to the camera that was on a stand. Laurence ran back to get the camera. \"I got it, I got it!\" \"They can handle this, they know what they're doing,\" Bill told Melissa as they walked back to their truck. \"I mean, well, this is what they do, they live for this.\" Melissa nodded. \"Uh-huh.\" \"Dorothy 2 and 3 ready!\" Beltzer called out. \"Dorothy 4 ready!\" Haynes confirmed as they shut the doors on their van. Melissa noted how Bill kept glancing back at the team and at Dorothy I. \"Are you sure you don't want to go along?\" \"No,\" Bill said and then blinked. \"Oh, with them you mean?\" he asked. Melissa nodded. \"Well, yeah.\" \"No, they'll be fine,\" Bill said reassuringly as the team started driving past them, with Jo in the lead, honking her horn as she passed them. \"Did she sign the papers?\" Melissa asked. \"Oh, crap!\" Bill cursed, recalling that he had the papers and Jo still hadn't signed the last page. \"She didn't?\" Melissa was surprised and disappointed. \"Common', if we hurry we can still catch them!\" Bill exclaimed and they run to their truck, got in, and followed the team. A/N: Will Bill be able to catch up with Jo? Stay tune for next week's installment. R&R; everyone![Chapter 3] Twister: Chasing the Storm A/N: Well, there's been a slight improvement on how many people are reading this particular story, but I'm still a bit disappointed. Anyhow, I'm going to keep posting these chapters no matter what. Read, review, and enjoy! Disclaimer: I don't own anything from Twister . I just own any and all characters that I just happen create. CHAPTER TWO: COMPETITION AND A CLOSE CALL \" The Lord is nigh unto all them that call upon him, to all that call upon him in truth. \" Psalms 145:18 Oklahoma June 17, 1996… It wasn't long before the team was out on the road, driving fast, and Bill was bringing up the rear in his truck, listening to the chatter on the radio as the team members communicated with each other with updates. `\"Rabbit!\"` `\"Yeah, boss?\"` `\" Can we do better than the 30 ?\"` Rabbit checked one of his maps while removing the pencil he was holding in his mouth. \"No. Not for a while,\" he replied. \"It's best to stay on it until we pass Rogers creek.\" `\"Copy that.\"` While listening to the chatter, Bill came to a decision. \"Once we catch up with them, you take the truck and head home,\" he suggested. \"I'll get the papers signed and see you tonight. Okay?\" \"No!\" Melissa protested, smiling. \"You know what honey, I find this kind of interesting. I'm gonna tag along!\" Bill was surprised to hear her say that, but then he was distracted when a caravan of six black Windstar vans pulled up along side Jo's group. \"Jonas!\" he exclaimed, recognizing the man in the lead car, which was pulling a black trailer. \"Son of a bitch!\" \"Who is that, honey?\" Melissa inquired. \"Jonas Miller. He's a nightcrawler,\" Bill explained as he pulled alongside Jonas' window, they both nodded their heads, acknowledging each other. \"We all started out in the same lab, but Jonas went out and got himself some corporate sponsors. He's in it for the money, not the science. He's got a lot of high-tech gadgets, but he's got no instincts. And he doesn't have Dorothy,\" he added proudly. Meanwhile, Jo was focused on driving her truck when Beltzer's voice came over the radio. `\"Jo, I think we got fleas!\"` Before Jo could respond to that, she heard Bill's voice and she grinned as she spoke to him instead. \"Hey there, you change your mind?\" she asked. `\"Yeah, what's Jonas doin' here?\"` Bill asked. Jo checked her side view mirror and saw the six cars. \"I'm not sure,\" she admitted. \"But I bet he's asking himself the same question about you.\" At that exact moment, one of the cars, the biggest of them, suddenly swerved toward Bill's truck, and forced him off the road. \"Oh, crap, hold on!\" Bill yelped, trying to keep them from flipping as they ended up in a ditch, and one of the tires went flat. \"Damn son of a bitch!\" Two hours later and the help of the team, allowing Melissa a chance to get to know the other members, the red truck was parked outside a repair ship, and Bill pulled the flat tire out of the back as the auto-technician came over. \"How long do you think it'll take to fix?\" Bill asked. The auto-technician examined the tire. \"Oh, maybe 10 minutes, 15 tops.\" Bill checked his watch and nodded. \"Sounds good.\" As he headed for the team, who weren't too far off and were looking over maps, his attention was drawn to the other side of the street, where Jonas' team was parked near the diner, and his team was filming him. \"What drives me is the unknown,\" Jonas was telling the camera as a black object was pulled out of the trailer. \"What if we could predict a tornado's path? How many lives would be spared with the creation of an early warning system?\" He gestured to the large weather instrument. \"And D.O.T. 3 is the answer! The first digital orthographic telemeter. And inside,\" the cover opened in segments, \"she holds hundreds of these little sensors.\" He held up a square sensor. \"Which when released into the tornado, will transmit back data on wind speed, pressure, and dew point temperature.\" Bill stared in horrid realization: Jonas had stolen he and Jo's idea! Jo looked up and noticed his pissed expression. \"Bill?\" \"Why didn't you tell me?\" he demanded, running across the street. \"Bill, don't-\" Jo began as she and the team chased after him. \"Which will soon be the center of all study-\" Jonas was saying when Bill knocked off his hat, grabbed him by his collar, and pushed him against his van. \"Hey! Hey!\" \"You stole my design, you son of a bitch!\" Bill raged, his face red with fury. \"What you think, I wasn't gonna find out about this?\" \"Hey, guys, can you get this loser off me?\" Jonas grunted as his men grabbed Bill, trying to pry him off. Jo's team ran over, and they managed to pull Bill away from Jonas and from Jonas's men. \"Back off! Back off!\" Dusty told Bill. \"It's not worth it!\" Jonas straightened his collar and retrieved his hat. \"What is the matter with you?\" he demanded. Bill tried to lunge at him, but he was being restrained by Dusty and the other guys. \"You stole my design, you son of a bitch!\" he shouted, struggling in their grip. \"Calm down!\" Rabbit exclaimed. \"What the hell you talkin' about?\" Jonas inquired sharply. \"Dorothy!\" Bill snapped. \"You took her, you damn thief!\" Jonas instantly became smug. \"Oh I get it,\" he said. \"You want to take credit for my design. Is that it?\" \"You're a liar,\" Bill growled. \"She was our idea and you know it.\" \"Unrealized idea,\" Jonas corrected, still looking smug, \"unrealized.\" Bill tried to at him again, prompting him to hide behind his own men. \"That ain't worth crap!\" Jo ran over, and she broke up the fight. \"Hey, hey, hey, hey!\" she shouted, getting between the two teams. \"Guys, guys. All my guys, get a grip on yourselves.\" She turned her attention to Bill. \"We both know he'll never get that thing up in the air.\" \"That's right!\" Beltzer agreed. \"No way that high-tech piece of junk will ever fly,\" said Elle and Maxine agreed. \"No way.\" Jonas, however, had other ideas. \"Well let me enlighten you people!\" he spoke up, moving behind his technology and closed the segmented cover. \"This baby has satellite comlink. We've got on-board pulse Doppler, we've got NEXRAD real time. Today, we're gonna make history. So stick around,\" he continued as Jo lifted an eyebrow contemptuously. \"Cuz' the days of sniffin' the dirt are over.\" \"Better than what you sniff,\" Rabbit grumbled. \"We'll see who gets there first, pal ,\" Bill sneered. \"Oh, and by the way, I really enjoy your weather reports!\" Jonas called back and his crew laugh. Bill tried to get at him again but Dusty and Sanders held him back. \"You slime! I ain't through with you yet! Come on! Come here! Come on! Come on! Get your hands off me! I'm all right! O. K!\" And they finally let him go. \"He's a corporate kiss-butt, man!\" Joey complained. Jo turn to Bill, whose face was still red. \"I'm sorry,\" she apologized. \"I should have told you.\" \"One day,\" Bill told her curtly. \"I'll give you one day. Whether she flies or not I'm gone.\" Melissa ran up, having heard and seen the fight. \"Honey, is everything okay?\" she asked, concerned. \"It's okay, everything's fine,\" Bill reassured her. \"Are you sure?\" Melissa questioned, unsure. Bill nodded. \"Yeah, yeah, yeah, everything's okay.\" \"Okay,\" Melissa agreed, but she wasn't entirely convinced. \"Listen, I'm gonna hang out here and get some air,\" Bill said. \"Why don't you get us some cold drinks.\" Melissa nodded. \"Okay, sweetheart.\" \"Okay,\" Bill agreed, grabbed a handful of dirt, and he looked up at the sky. It'd been said storm chasers have a sixth sense, and as Bill sifted a hand full of dirt, he let nature embody his mind. Jo entered the diner and was immediately approached by Jonas, who had been a bit shaken by the incident earlier. \"You know, Jo, I don't know what the matter is with Bill,\" he told her. \"I mean, he's wacko, he's crazy! You ought to keep a leash on him.\" Jo nodded, but she wasn't too worry about Bill. \"He's not my problem, he's yours.\" And she turned toward the counter. Jonas blocked her route. \"Oh, by the way, this storm's going to be a lot bigger than we anticipated,\" he informed her. \"I got reports of mesos all the way from Grand County to Logan.\" \"You sharing information with me?\" Jo asked, surprised. Jonas shook his head. \"No, I was just curious as to which way you were going to head.\" \"Southeast, I think…to the counter.\" And Jo walked over to the counter, sitting down by Melissa. \"Two lemonades to go, please,\" Melissa requested and the waitress wrote her order down. Jo glanced at Jonas, who was now talking with his team. \"Nothing changes.\" \"Pardon me?\" Melissa asked. \"He's gonna wait and see what Bill does,\" Jo answered and then spoke to the waitress. \"Can I have a coffee to go, please.\" Melissa glanced over a Jonas. \"That man's waiting for Billy? Why?\" And her eyebrows disappeared into her hairline when Jo told her why. \"So you're telling me Billy knows what a storm is thinking?\" Jo nodded. \"Something like that.\" She popped a pice of gum into her mouth and then offered her the pack. \"Gum?\" Melissa shook her head, and she put it in her pocket. \"My Aunt Meg used to call him a human barometer.\" \"Well he never really told me about all this,\" Melissa remarked, although now that she thought about it, it did explain why he was so good at predicting what the wether was going to do. \"If you have to pee you should do it now, 'cuz there's not many places to stop once we get on the road,\" Jo advised. \"You're still in love with him, aren't you?\" Melissa asked the blonde. Jo was wrong-footed by the question and chose to ignore it. \"Check please,\" she requested. \"Not that I blame you,\" Melissa said. \"I just hope this isn't some desperate attempt to keep him in your life.\" Jo picked up both checks and added a $20 to them both. \"We're together.\" Picking up her coffee, she got up, and she walked away from the counter. Outside, Bill was staring at the distant clouds, which were turning green, and he still had some dirt in his hand when Dusty walked up. \"Hey, man,\" his friend said. \"What's up?\" Bill nodded to the clouds. \"Goin' green.\" \"Greenage,\" Dusty agreed, grinning since they both knew that it meant that tornadoes were coming soon. Bill nodded, it was time to go. \"Saddle 'em up.\" \"You got it, boss,\" Dusty agreed and he went back to get the team. Inside the diner, Jonas and his team were looking at computers and going over data provided by the satellites. \"Charles, give me a sector scan on that cell, keep looking for upflow,\" he ordered. \"Flanders, what are my dew points doing?\" \"Dew point's up to 70, sir.\" When Melissa exited the diner with two lemonades, she was surprised to see the team were getting back in their vehicles, and she went over to Bill, who was getting his coat out of the red truck. \"Honey, I got you a lemonade-\" \"We gotta move out,\" Bill interrupted. \"Listen, follow us in the truck, but stay behind Dusty's van, you'll be safe back there. I gotta go with Jo. Okay, let's move out, people! Let's go!\" And he ran toward the yellow truck. \"Where are we goin'?\" Melissa called out, but no one had time to answer her as they were getting ready to head out. Feeling frustrated, she put the lemonades on top of the truck and got in, forgetting about them when she saw Dusty driving away and she quickly followed. Sneaking up on her, Bill took the keys out of Jo's mouth, surprising her. \"Thanks, I'll drive.\" And he immediately got into the driver's seat. Blinking, Jo finished pulling on her jumpsuit and she hopped into the passenger side. Back inside the diner, Jonas saw the team heading out, and he knew that it was time to go. \"All right people, lets pack it up, let's go.\" He headed for the door while his team packed up their gear and followed after him. Once outside, they headed for their cars. It was time to chase after tornadoes and make history. Out on the road, Dusty was grinning madly as he cranked up the music and sucked juice from a straw that was dangling from the ceiling. \"It's the wonder of nature, baby!\" he cheered and laughed. \"Wooo! Wooooooo!\" And soon his music was once again blaring through the speaker on the roof. \"Hey you guys! Wooohoooo!\" While the rest of them were rolling their eyes, laughing at Dusty's selection of music, or were choosing their own music to listen to, Preacher was listening to William Tell and Elle and Maxine were singing to some of their own favorite tunes. Melissa turned down the sound on the radio in order to answer her ringing cellphone. \"Dr. Melissa Reeves here? Oh, oh. Yes, Donald, you've caught me in my car!\" In his van, Beltzer was singing the opening song to Oklahoma . \" OHKLAHOMA, where the wind comes sweeping down the plains, and the wavin' wheat- \" Melissa shook her head, listening to her patient complain about something connected to his marriage. \"Donald, this feeling of inadequacy is normal for you, Julia doesn't resent you,\" she reassured him. \"We talked about this before. She did not marry your penis. Oh, okay, she didn't only marry your penis.\" Beltzer and Haynes were now singing Oklahoma at the top of their lungs. \" HOOOOO…MAAAA…MAAAA…..OKLAHOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOMA! YEEOOWWW ! \" In the lead truck, Jo adjusted the sound on the radio and glanced at Bill, who was focused on the road for the moment. \"So…amazing coloring there, isn't it?\" she asked, glancing out the window at the sky. Bill nodded, also peering at the sky. \"Yeah, look at those mammatas,\" he commented. \"Bet those tops have got to be spiking at about 40,000.\" \"That's a good thing,\" Jo remarked. \"That's a very good thing,\" Bill agreed. Jo decided to change the subject to that of Melissa, wanting to know about about the other woman. \"She work at the station, is that where you met her?\" she asked causally. Bill groaned. \"Jo-\" \"What?\" Jo asked. Bill shook his head. \"I don't want to fight.\" \"I'm not fighting, I'm talking,\" Jo protested. \"I don't want to fight,\" Bill insisted and they both fell silent for a few minutes. Jo, however, couldn't stand the silence and decided to test the waters. \"She's nice.\" \"HAH!\" said Bill, annoyed. \"Uh-oh, she's not nice?\" Jo asked. Bill shook his head. \"I know what you meant.\" \"You do?\" Jo asked innocently. Bill nodded. \"Yes, so don't, don't do this.\" \"Okay, I'm making extremely civilized conversation here,\" Jo pointed out. \"You're biting my head off. Jesus.\" Bill sighed, knowing that she was right. \"Yes. She's very nice,\" he agreed, doing his best to remain calm. \"No, she doesn't work at the station she's, uh, she's a therapist.\" \"Oh,\" said Jo, recalling that Melissa had said she was a doctor earlier. \"Yours?\" Bill thumped the steering wheel. \"Christ!\" \"What?\" Jo asked, honestly confused this time around. \"You couldn't resist, could you? Come on!\" he complained. \"I'm not saying you need therapy!\" she exclaimed. Bill shot her a look. \"What?\" \"I'm not-\" Jo began. \" Wait . I need therapy?\" Bill demanded. Jo shook her head. \"I didn't say that.\" \"I need a therapist?\" Bill demanded. \"I didn't say that,\" Jo repeated, insistently. \"What could I possibly need a therapist for?\" Bill questioned. Jo shrugged. \"I don't know.\" \"You're the doctor, tell me,\" he suggested, getting hot under the collar. \"I don't know, um, in ability to finish things?\" Jo suggested hesitantly. \"Finish things?\" Bill repeated. \"Rushing into things you can't quite commit to-\" Jo began. \"Commitment?\" \"You asked me.\" \"Look-\" \"You asked me!\" \"No, that is crap!\" Bill snapped. \"Look, I may have walked out-\" \"You asked-\" Jo began. \"But at least I showed up in the first place!\" he interrupted. \"You never had the slightest idea-\" Jo tried to get him to calm down and focus on the road. \"Okay, there's a whole road thing- coming on up here…\" \"-about commitment and what being married means,\" Bill continued, interrupting her again. \"Like stability, supportiveness, the house and all kinds of neat stuff like that-\" and as he ranted, the truck started veering to the shoulder of the road, then the grass… Jo saw this and cut off his rant with a request. \"Can I drive?\" \"No,\" Bill refused. \"Then would you?\" she asked politely. Bill looked ahead, saw that they were no longer on the road, and there was a tractor right in front of them! \"Woha!\" He swerved sharply back onto the road. \"Damn.\" Jo chuckled. \"Somebody should warn her about your temper.\" \"Jo, I swear-\" Bill began. \"She obviously has no idea what she's getting into-\" she continued, ignoring him. \"Stay the hell out of it,\" Bill snapped, fed up. \"You know.\" \"I know exactly what I'm doing.\" \"What exactly-\" \"What am I doing?\" \"So, how long do you think they're going to keep arguing?\" Elle wondered, listening to the arguing going on in the truck ahead of them. \"No idea, but as long as they stay on the road, they can argue as long as they want to,\" said Maxine. When Jo's truck almost hit that tractor, they'd been alarmed. \"That's for sure,\" Elle agreed. Haynes and Beltzer were having similar thoughts, especially since this wasn't the first time they'd listened to Jo and Bill fight about something over the radio. \"I think they're getting better at this.\" \"Yeah, they are,\" Beltzer agreed. However, Jo was getting fed up with always fight with Bill. \"You know what?\" she said, frustrated. \"As long as you're happy-\" \"Thank you!\" Bill exclaimed. \"I am happy! I'm a happy person. I'm happy with my life. I'm happy with the way things are going in my life. I happy with… with, with-\" \"Melissa,\" Jo supplied. \"I know her name!\" Bill snapped. \"Yes, I'm happy with Melissa. I am!\" Jo nodded. \"Okay.\" Meanwhile, Beltzer was distracted from the fighting when he spotted a tornado that'd touched down minutes ago, and cursed for not spotting it sooner. \"Hey, are you guys gonna wrap this up pretty soon?\" he asked into the radio. `\"What?!\"` Bill's voice snapped. \"Oh, nothin,\" Beltzer said, mildly annoyed. \"I was just wonderin' if we're gonna chase this tornado, or if you just wanna catch the next one.\" In the lead truck, Jo and Bill also spotted the tornado. \"Crap!\" Bill cursed and felt like kicking himself for letting himself be distracted. Jo took the microphone. \"Beltzer, is it on the ground?\" she asked as Bill floored the gas, and the force pushed her back in the seat. \"Easy, easy, easy!\" And they all turned a corner, heading for the path of the tornado. Further back, Jonas and his team were also tracking the tornado while listening to weather reports on the radio. \"We have to bear right,\" he said into the radio, checking a map. \"It's on an easterly course.\" `\"The national weather service has issued a tornado warning in effect until 11:00 am…\"` Eddie, who was driving, noted the skid marks and saw Jo's team heading down a different road. \"Uh, Dr. Miller?\" \"Yes?\" Jonas asked. Eddie nodded to the skid marks. \"I think they turned left here.\" Jonas looked up from his map and saw that Eddie was right. \"Do it.\" And his team took the same turn, following after their rivals. Meanwhile, Jo put on a headset with a walkman attacked to her belt as she kept glancing at the tornado, which was holding a steady course, and she spoke into the mic. \"We're moving to intercept guys, get ready to set up.\" `\"You got it!\"` As they raced along, they could see the tornado speeding ahead, tearing up the countryside. Cars were passing the other way, honk their horns, and letting others know the impending danger. \"You got to get further ahead of it,\" Jo told Bill, hoping that they could get Dorothy in the path before the tornado disappeared. \"I know what I'm doing,\" Bill said, keeping track of both the road and the twister. Jo pointed to the nearby field. \"Cut across the field, Bill!\" \"I know I have to get ahead of it,\" Bill said calmly. Jo, however, was frantic. \"You're gonna have to get into that field!\" Bill rolled his eyes. \"Do you want to drive?\" he asked. \"I'm just saying-\" Jo began. \"Would you like to drive?\" Bill repeated. \"Yes, I'd love to!\" Jo replied eagerly. `\"Listen, it's about, 3 miles southeast, let's see what she does!\"` Rabbit reported over the radio. `\"We definitely got ourselves an F2 here,\"` Elle added, `\"but it could go up to F3 based on the increase of the speed earlier.\"` Jo pulled her eyes from the twister, which was dancing across the field, and eyed an irrigation ditch, pointing. \"Go in there, go in there!\" \"Just wait-\" Bill began, still keeping track of the twister. \"You're gonna miss it!\" Jo exclaimed. Bill shook his head. \"Hold on, hold on! Just hold on a second.\" \"Have you lost your nerve?\" Jo asked in a taunting manner. Bill looked at her and smiled slyly. \"Tighten your seatbelt!\" He grabbed her seatbelt toward him, and pulled it tighter. He then swerved the truck into the irrigation ditch, going at 80 miles per hour. `\"Jo, Bill, where are you? We lost visual!\"` Bill realized that he timed his entry into the area badly and they were now stuck in the ditch, which they were bouncing through as they got closer to the twister. Ahead the ditch was becoming deeper, and the sides were slanting upward. \"Are we having fun yet?\" he asked. Jo knew that they were going to be in serious trouble if they didn't get out of the ditch. \"Okay, we got to get out of this.\" \"Really?\" Bill asked sarcastically trying to find a way out of the ditch. `\"2 miles now, picking up speed!\"` `\"Still an F2! I repeat, still an F2!\"` Jo was clinging to the seat. \"Bill, sometime this week would be good!\" \"I'm trying to get out!\" Bill shouted, but the sides were now too steep to drive over. They were stuck. \"Are you mad?\" Jo asked. Bill shook his head. \"I'll be mad later, right now I'm trying not to kill us!\" `\"Funnel's getting thicker! It's movin' fast, coming toward you Jo!\"` The tornado roared as it destroyed a barn off to the left, and Jo knew they were in serious trouble when it shifted its' track, but she still wanted to launch Dorothy, too. \"It's starting to turn!\" \"Where?\" Bill asked, unable to see the tornado because of the ditch. \"I can't see!\" \"You will,\" Jo promised. `\"Jo, you're too close, it's not gonna work. Get outta there!\"` Bill looked at the mirrors and saw that she was right when the twister shifted so that it was now heading toward them by way of the ditch. \"Crap! I can't get out, it's too steep! This was a great idea!\" he slammed on the breaks, but they continue however, to skim forward. And ahead was a low lying overpass! The truck slammed into it, and they jumped out, yelling at each other since the wind was so loud. \"See, that wasn't so bad!\" Jo exclaimed, running toward the rear of the truck. \"Comon', let's get her pit! Let's go!\" \"Why can't we spend a normal day together?!\" Bill complained, following after her. Reaching the back of the truck, Jo lowered the tailgate and she was ready to unload Dorothy, but Bill knew that they were within seconds of getting sucked up by the tornado. \"We're in the damage path, let's go!\" Bill shouted when he reached her, grabbed her arm, and soon they were running to get under the overpass. \"Jo, this is crazy, common'!\" Jo struggled to break free of his grip, wanting to go back to her truck. \"Let go!\" \"There's no time!\" Bill countered, hauling her toward the overpass, which wasn't the safest place to hide, but there wasn't any other places to hide. Jo refused to believe that. \"We can still do this!\" Bill, however, pulled her under the overpass. \"Find something to grab hold of!\" \"I know!\" Jo shouted as they held on to the column that was holding up the overpass as the twister drew closer and closer. Bill was hugging both the column and Jo, and he was alarmed when she slipped out of his grip and crawled towards the twister, which was only yards away. \"What are you doing?!\" he yelped, grabbing her arm. \"What are you doing?!\" \"I want to see it!\" Jo shouted, trying to pull her arm free, desperate to see the twister in action. Bill, however, wouldn't let go and worked on pulling her back to relative safety. \"Come back!\" \"I want to see it!\" Jo screamed, fighting to break free. \"Bill!\" However, Bill pulled her back under the overpass, just as the truck began to slide forward as the strong winds from the twister pushed it from behind. \"Look out! Look out!\" And they both turned away, clinging to the column for dear life as the twister passed over the overpass, the truck flying into the air and was gone. Moments later, the twister was gone as well, its' energy used up. Melissa stared in shock at what she'd just witnessed. \"Oh my God.\" A/N: Talk about a shocking experience, huh? R&R; everyone![Chapter 4] Twister: Chasing the Storm A/N: Hey, guys! So, I'm keeping this intro short since I'm going to be very busy today since it's my b-day. Yes, today's my b-day and I'm going to be out most of the day having fun. Read, review, and enjoy! Disclaimer: I don't own anything from Twister .

CHAPTER THREE: WATER SPOUTS AND COWS \" For this they willingly are ignorant of, that by the word of God the heavens were of old, and the earth standing out of the water and in the water. \" 2 Peter 3:5 Oklahoma June 17, 1996… Realizing that the twister was gone, Bill and Jo climbed out of the ditch, soaked with mud, and both were looking on the verge of passing out. \"It's gone,\" Bill gasped, hoping that he wouldn't ever get that close to a tornado for a very long time. \"It's gone.\" \"Where's my truck?\" Jo asked, looking around for the missing vehicle. Suddenly, the truck slammed into the road, narrowly missing Melissa in her truck. She screamed as she zoomed around it and hit the brakes, making the truck skid a few feet. Jo smiled. \"There it is.\" Hearing the screams, Bill ran to the red truck. \"Melissa?\" The rest of the team arrived by this point, got out of their vehicles, and ran over to Melissa as she got out of the truck, shaking and hyper ventilating. \"Are you okay?\" Preacher asked, reaching her side and she shook her head. \"You just missed the truck!\" Dusty exclaimed, laughing. \"Awesome! It's awesome!\" \"Dusty, calm down a little please,\" Elle advised. \"She's shaking like a leaf.\" Bill ran up at that moment, and she practically leapt into his arms. \"Melissa!\" \"Oh God, Billy, Billy !\" Melissa cried, shaking badly. \"You okay?\" Bill asked, hugging her. Melissa wasn't sure how she was feeling. \"Oh, God, I'm okay…\" \"You sure?\" Bill asked, concerned. Dusty was still laughing and pointing to the wrecked yellow truck and the remains of Dorothy I. \"Bill, she just missed the truck!\" Having, calmed down somewhat, Melissa realized that Bill was covered with mud. \"God, what happened to you?\" she asked. \"Nothin' honey, we're okay, we were perfectly safe,\" Bill reassured her. Jo walked by, followed by Haynes and Rabbit. \"Gone,\" she complained, furious that their first attempt was a failure. Haynes thought they might be able to save it. \"Wait a minute-\" \"It's trashed,\" Jo predicted. \"No, just hang on a minute we'll take a look, I'll know,\" said Rabbit. Jo just shook her head. \"It's gone.\" She glanced over at Bill and Melissa, feeling a pang in her heart at how they were hugging each other. \"You okay?\" \"She's okay,\" Bill replied. Dusty was now standing next to the flipped yellow truck, and it was clear that Dorothy was smashed. \"Well, there's some good news,\" he joked as Jo reached him. \"It did fly.\" And he backed up a bit as she kicked in one of the windows and began pulling her stuff out of the totaled truck. \"What was it like?\" he asked. Jo looked up at Dusty. It was windy.\" \"Windy?\" Dusty repeated, chuckling. \"That's intense-\" Jo rolled her eyes and pushed him aside. \"All right, move it, Dusty!\" Dusty backed away, holding up his hands. \"That's intense! That's intense!\" Just then, the Black Windstars rolled up. \"Hey, the auto club's here!\" Joey called out, sneering. In the lead van, Eddie noted the situation that the rival team was in. \"Maybe we should stop, see if they need some help,\" he suggested. Jonas shook his head. \"They're fine, pay attention to the road.\" Deciding to have some fun, Dusty ran up to the' van, and jumped so that the upper half of his body was in the window. \"Fashionably late again, Jonas?\" he teased. \"Fashionably late! Gimmie kiss, baby!\" And he kissed Eddie on the cheek, getting protests from both men. \"Get out of here, Get outta here!\" Laughing triumphantly, Dusty slid out of the window and back onto the road. \"Loser! Loser!\" \"Why don't you find your own twister, buddy!\" Rabbit called out. \"Yeah quit trying to steal ours!\" Maxine shouted, mocking the black vans. \"Loser!\" Dusty repeated and made a show of directing traffic. \"Move on!\" While they were mocking their rivals, Beltzer gathered up the sensors and put them in a large bowl his wife was holding. \"Let's go.\" \"Don't worry, I'll get 'em cleaned,\" Haynes promised. \"Common' guys let's get Dorothy 2 ready.\" Jo placed her backpack onto of her overturned truck, and she was now using a towel to get the mud off her face, and she was also eying the red truck. \"You got full coverage on that truck?\" she asked Bill, who had his arm around Melissa's shoulders, holding her close. Bill smiled, he knew what she really wanted. \"Liability only.\" \"Liability only?\" Jo repeated, getting the worst of the mud off her face. \"It's a very pretty truck.\" \"Thank you,\" said Melissa, who wasn't shaking anymore. Bill laughed nervously, for he knew what Jo was up to. She wanted to use his truck for the chase. Jo looked at him as she threw all her stuff in her backpack. \"Don't even think about it,\" he protested. \"No way.\" Three hours later, Bill was driving in the lead with Dorothy II strapped to the back, and he was annoyed that Jo had managed to convince him to let her use the truck. Jo was seated next to him and Melissa was sitting in the backseat, having refused to go home despite the incident earlier. `\"This is the caboose, this is the caboose!\"` Dusty called out over the radio. `\"I'm waiting for orders, Boss!\"` Jo and Bill both reached for the mic at the same time, and they laughed nervously when they did it a second time. \"Go ahead,\" Bill offered. Jo shook her head, although she did want to grab the mic. \"It's your truck.\" \"No, really,\" Bill insisted. \"You should.\" Smiling, Jo picked up the mic and spoke into it. \"Dusty, the battle zone should be northeast of 81.\" `\"Copy that, Jo.\"` \"Wait a minute. Battle zone?\" Melissa asked, looking between them with a confused expression. \"Billy, what're we doing?\" \"We're going again,\" Bill answered. \"Again?\" Melissa repeated, alarmed. \"But back there you almost got yourself killed!\" Bill smiled and shook his head. \"No, no. Just a close call.\" In the RV, Rabbit was checking the maps while Sanders drove and he spoke into the mike with directions of where to go. \"You're gonna cross 15 on Oklahoma 412. 412.\" In the lead truck, Jo glanced at Bill, who nodded, and she spoke into the mike. \"Okay, copy that. Haynes, what's on the mesonet?\" she asked. `\"Winds continuing to back, VIL's are at…..uh, 60,\"` Haynes reported. \"Okay guys, let's go get it!\" Jo ordered and put the mic down. She then leaned over to see the speedometer, which was at 50. She groaned and slumped back in her seat since they were going too slow Bill rolled his eyes and speeded up. Soon enough they could see the twister in the distance and they were catching up with Jonas's team, which were heading in the same direction, turning this into a race to see who would be reaching the tornado first. In the lead van, Jonas was using binoculars to examine the twister. \"Mobile lab,\" he said into the mic. \"Yeah, Tony, Is it me or is the main updraft shifted?\" `\"No, all the winds are bearing, sir,\"` Tony responded. Jonas wasn't so sure of that. \"Uh, this thing might dissipate,\" he warned. \"Do we have enough to get in front of it?\" At the NSSL, they were also tracking the tornado and were relaying information to Jonas and his team. \"Murphy!\" Bryce called out. \"Rotation is increasing. Sheer is 90 knots. 50 outbound, 40 inbound.\" Murphy nodded and spoke into the phone. \"Yeah, yeah, we see it. We do, we see it. Very pronounced hook.\" In the mobile lab, two men were imputing data into the computers and were checking for Jonas based on the data they'd just received from NSSL. \"Checking for you now, sir.\" \"Dr. Miller. Good southeast gusts at 40 miles per hour. Approaching 150 in the funnel.\" \"The storm motion is 225 degrees, coming straight out of the southwest.\" Jonas was happy with that report. \"We're in perfect position, let's proceed.\" And he did a double-take when the red pickup pulled up alongside him. \"Oh howdy,\" Eddie remarked. \"Got to admire their spirit.\" And smiled sheepishly when his boss shot him a look. Jo peered past Bill at the black van. \"There's your pal,\" she said sarcastically. Bill and Jonas glared at each other for a moment, and he returned his attention to the road. Bill, however, glanced at the tornado and immediately slammed on the breaks. Jonas was surprised when the red truck suddenly disappeared and he looked out the window to see where they'd gone. \"What're you doin', what're you doin'?!\" Jo yelped, startled by the change of direction. Bill was staring out the windshield. Look at the updraft, the angle,\" he said, nodding to the tornado. \"It's gonna shift it's track.\" \"Are you sure?\" Jo asked. \"Oh yes,\" Bill confirmed, nodding. \"It's defiantly a sidewinder! It'll move left.\" \"Is that bad?\" Melissa asked, worried. Bill ignored the question. \"Wasn't there a road back there?\" \"You're right, go, go, go, go, go!\" Jo shouted, now seeing what he was seeing. Bill turned the truck around, driving fast, and then he turned right onto a different road and speeded ahead, their team were quick to follow suit, confused. Melissa jumped when her phone started ringing, and she hastily answered it. \"Hello?! Donald, now's not a very good time for me, okay? What…\" she sighed \"all right, put Julie on. Okay.\" Jonas was watching a model on his laptop and he was pleased with the results. \"Looking good, looking very good. All right,\" he said to Eddie, \"about 4 miles south, hang a right, let's deploy and we'll be done!\" Just then, the tornado started to shift to the left, and Eddie noticed. \"Uh, Dr. Miller…\" Jonas looked up and he immediately started cursing. \"Shit, shit… it's moving away! God!\" \"Look's like they're gonna intercept,\" Eddie added, nodding to the other team. Jonas grabbed his binoculars and peered through them, spotting Jo's team, and then he yelled into the radio. \"Damnit, Tony, I thought you said this thing was gonna stay on the same heading!\" Meanwhile, Jo was tracking the progress of the tornado, Bill was increasing the speed he was driving, and Melissa was still talking on her cellphone. \"We're close,\" Bill announced. Jo nodded and spoke into the mic. \"Rabbit, tell me what road we're on, where does this take us? \"I know it feels unnatural,\" Melissa was saying into the phone, getting Jo's attention, \"but with Donald's motility, you're not gonna have this baby the old-fashioned way. Even if you stand on your head.\" Jo gave Bill a funny look. Bill flushed a little. \"She's a, reproductive therapist.\" Deciding to humor him, Jo spoke into the radio. \"Laurence? Laurence come in, we've got to get ahead of this storm, what's on the satellite?\" Hearing this, Melissa tried to end the phone call. \"I can't talk to you right now, I'll have to call you back.\" `\"Twister south, skipping south, shifting to south, we have a, F2, ladies and gentlemen, possibly F3. You with me? It's a very, very large rope on the ground. Very large. Right on the ground.\"` `\"It looks like it's turning, it looks like it's turning. The atmosphere is very unstable! Repeat, unstable!\"` Elle had a different report. `\"No, it's a solid one.\"` `\"Definitely solid,\"` Maxine confirmed. `\"This is Rabbit, this is Rabbit, it's at 2:00, it's headed this way!\"` `\"This is Sanders, this is Sanders! We're driving due east on a country road we've been on for about 6 miles. We've got an F3, 2, sitting on the ground, and she's a beauty! WHOOHOO!\"` `\"Jo, it's Barn Burner, it's Barn Burner! It's not gonna hang out long. It's not hanging out long!\"` Jo spotted the twister in the distance and she spoke into the mic. \"We got it, we got it, we see it!\" It was getting very dark outside, even though it was afternoon, and the rain was pounding the immediate area. \"We're getting slammed in here guys,\" Bill warned the team, \"you better hang back.\" The rest of the group slowed down a bit, while Bill, Jo, and Melissa drove on toward the tornado. Jo grabbed a camera. \"This thing loaded?\" she asked. Bill nodded. \"Yeah, go for it.\" Turning the camera on, Jo was about to take a picture of the tornado, when she noticed the rain on the window. \"Rain bands.\" \"What?\" Melissa looked, looking between them. Jo pointed to the window. \"Look at the surf coming off those fields.\" \"Shit, horizontal rain,\" Bill cursed. \"Hang on!\" He floor the gas as they approached a bridge going over a large lake. There were two water spouts (water tornadoes) on either side of the bridge, and they were sucking up water. Jo was staring up at the stormy sky. \"Jesus, Bill, I've never seen it clouded like this.\" \"I don't think anybody has,\" Bill agreed. \"But, I-\" he didn't finish the sentence, instead he concentrated on the road. \"Bill… we're in the core,\" Jo realized. Suddenly, the water spout to the left of them split in half, turning into two water spouts. \"Okay, we've got sisters!\" Bill exclaimed. Melissa jumped when her phone started ringing. \"Yes?! Julie I can't talk to you right now!\" \"We're right under the flanking line,\" Jo pointed out since they were now facing three water spouts, and if they didn't get out of there, they were going to flipped. \"I realize that,\" Bill said, fully aware of the situation. \"We can't attack this thing from the south, we're gonna get rolled!\" Jo exclaimed. Bill grinned at her. \"Watch me.\" \"Julie, I know you're upset,\" Melissa told her client, \"you just gotta, breathe, we've both just gotta breathe!\" Suddenly, a cow flew past them. \"Cow,\" Jo said, staring as the cow flew out of sight, and her eyes were wide since that wasn't something one saw everyday, even with tornadoes. \"I gotta go, Julie, we got cows!\" Melissa exclaimed and she hung up. Just then, another cow flew past again. \"Another cow,\" said Jo, watching it go by. \"Actually, I think that was the same one,\" Bill corrected and shook his head at the mess they were in. \"We've got drunkards here, we've got no path!\" \"This is not good,\" Jo agreed, \"get us out of here!\" \"I'm trying, okay?!\" Bill shouted, gripping the steering wheel tightly. \"Floor it!\" Jo shouted, scared. Bill floored the gas, but he realized that it wouldn't work, and he slammed on the breaks. Moments later, they were surrounded by the three water spouts, swirling around the truck like a carousel. \"Hang on!\" he shouted as the truck began to slide and spin, and they were all screaming, terrified. \"Honey, hang on!\" Suddenly, the three water spouts elevated back into the clouds and they were gone. For a second, all three had shocked expressions on their faces. Then Bill and Jo hopped out of the truck excited, leaving Melissa, still frozen with fear. Jo and Bill hugged and laughed. \"God! Was that incredible?!\" Jo gasped. \"Did you see it? It was incredible!\" Bill laughed as Jo pointed up to the clouds where the twisters had disappeared and then he remembered Melissa, who was shakily climbing out of the truck. \"Oh! Oh, oh, honey!\" He ran over to her and hugged her. By this point, the team arrived in their vehicles, they got out, and ran over to check on the trio, with Dusty shouting with glee. \"Whooohooo!\" \"Did you see that?!\" Jo exclaimed as the team gathered around her, heading for the back of the red truck. Bill was talking to Melissa. \"It's okay, it's okay.\" Melissa was shaking badly. \"No, I'm not okay! This is not okay!\" Her voice was cracking. \"Okay?\" Bill sighed. \"Aw, Christ… I'm sorry. Honey, I didn't think.\" \"You know when you used to tell me you chased tornadoes?\" Melissa asked, crying. \"Deep down, I always thought it was a metaphor!\" \"Shhhh. It's okay,\" Bill told her, regretting that he let her stay in the truck. \"Three times a lady!\" Beltzer said loudly, laughing. \"Did you see the inflow jets on these fatties?\" Joey asked excitedly. \"Did you see?\" Jo repeated as Beltzer helped her open the tailgate, and she climbed up into the back of truck, so she was standing by Dorothy. \"I was sitting in the middle of it!\" And the entire team cheered. Well, Laurence wasn't cheering, instead he was looking rattled by the latest close call. \"I was thinking, it may not be too bad of an idea, if we just got the hell out of here,\" he suggested. \"'Cuz that was defiantly too many tornadoes back there…\" \"Are you kidding?\" Jo laughed. \"This thing's not over, we've only seen the start of it!\" \"Hey, you know what, uh, Jo, somebody couldn't help but notice how close we are to Wakita,\" Rabbit remarked, changing the subject. Jo shook her head, knowing what he was hinting at. \"No!\" \"Yeah, and Aunt Meg wouldn't mind a pit stop, right?\" Sanders asked hopefully. \"No,\" Jo repeated. \"Red meat, we crave sustenance!\" Dusty pleaded, really wanting to see her aunt since it was a tradition. \"Guys, we are not invading my aunt!\" Jo objected. Dusty began chanting. \"Food!\" and the rest of the team joined in. \"Food! Food! Food!\" \"Hey!\" Jo shouted, trying to get their attention. \"We are absolutely not going!\" A/N: So, do you think Jo is going to win that argument or will they be visiting her aunt? Stay tune for more at the same tornado time and the same tornado channel. R&R; everyone![Chapter 5] Twister: Chasing the Storm A/N: Hi, I'm here with the next chapter, and I hope you all enjoy it. Read, review, and enjoy! Disclaimer: I don't own anything from Twister . I just own any and all characters that I just happen create. CHAPTER FOUR: WILD STORIES AND THE HIDDEN TWISTER \" The wild beasts of the desert shall also meet with the wild beasts of the island, and the satyr shall cry to his fellow; the screech owl also shall rest there, and find for herself a place of rest . \" Isaiah 34:14 Wakita, Oklahoma June 17, 1996… Two hours later, the team pulled up next to a two-story white house with a front yard wind chimes and sculptures, all ringing beautifully. Meg was in a nearby shed, where she was telling a welder how she wanted her newest project to look. \"There's the spot,\" she told the welder, pointing to a spot. \"Just do it.\" She looked up, surprised, when she saw Jo and the team getting out of their vehicles, and she grinned when she saw Bill. \"Billy!\" \"Meg!\" Bill waved to her as he helped Melissa out of the truck. \"Come on, honey!\" He hurried her across the yard and he hugged Meg. \"Meg, how are you?!\" Meg smiled wildly. \"Oh, it is so good to see you!\" \"Good to see you too,\" Bill agreed. \"Day before yesterday, I was telling Jo,\" Meg informed him, \"how much I miss you! You haven't seen any of my new work!\" She then hugged her niece when she reached them. \"Jo! Oh honey!\" She kissed her cheek. \"Seen some action?\" Jo grinned. \"You should have seen it.\" \"Hi, Meg,\" said Elle and Maxine at the same time, and they exchanged hugs. Dusty ran up just then, with the others right behind him. \"Meg!\" \"Hey, Boys!\" Meg exclaimed as they gathered around, and did a group hug. Barely an hour later, the team were in the house, where Meg and Jo were busy cooking up steaks and eggs in the kitchen, and the others were either seated at the table or in chairs and couches in the living room, eating, chatting, and watching the news on the TV. \"No, in a severe lightning storm you want to grab your ankles and stick your butt up in the air,\" Rabbit advised between bites of steak. \"He's right,\" Haynes agreed, \"if you're gonna get hit, it's the safest orifice.\" \"Yeah, I'd like to get hit by lightning once,\" said Joey, grabbing a roll. \"Ya know, see what it's like.\" Sanders poured himself lemonade, and he tasted it. \"Hey, this is real lemonade. Hey, Meg, I'm movin' in here!\" he called out into the kitchen. Elle chuckled as she grabbed the pitcher to pour some for herself and her sister. \"You say that every time, Sanders.\" \"But it is good lemonade,\" Maxine added. Jo walked out of the kitchen with a tray of beef. \"You guys, look out, make a space,\" she ordered and Laurence moved to a nearby chair, and put down a clean plate for Melissa, who sat down with an uncertain expression. \"Look out, look out, look out.\" Jo plopped a huge chunk of beef on Melissa's plate. Melissa looked at it, almost disgusted. Rabbit was surprised by the amount of beef that they were being served. \"God, Meg, you've got a lot of beef,\" he remarked when Meg came over to put eggs on their plates. \"Where'd you get all this beef?\" \"Did you see my cows out front?\" Meg asked with a sly smile. Rabbit shook his head. \"No.\" Meg made a gasping face that made them all laugh. \"Ohhhh!\" \"Ohh,\" said Rabbit, figuring out what she meant. \"Cool.\" \"You slaughter your own cows, Meg!\" Dusty complimented. \"Nice.\" And when Jo plopped down a bowl of mashed potatoes and gravy, he scooped some up and put a glob of mashed potatoes on Melissa's plate. \"Potatoes?\" \"Better grab some while you can,\" Jo advised as she walked past. \"Meg's gravy is famous,\" Dusty told Melissa. \"It's practically a food group.\" And he poured a ton of gravy on her potatoes. Melissa sat there, not knowing what to say, and she shook her head when Laurence offered her a roll. Bill entered the dining area, having been upstairs for a much-needed shower, and he was now wearing clean clothes. \"Shower's free.\" \"I'm next!\" said Jo, popping open a can of Pepsi. Bill almost walked into her. \"Oops.\" He side-stepped her and was soon face-to-face with Meg, who offered him a plate of food. \"Oh, I want that.\" Grabbing her own plate of food, Jo peered into the living room and she made a face when Jonas appeared on the TV, being interviewed. \"How can you watch this garbage?\" Hearing her, Bill set his plate down on the table, where the guys had moved a bit to give him a seat. \"Oh, pardon me gentlemen,\" he said, going to the TV. \"You guys gotta see this.\" And he cranked the volume up so they all could hear. \"Careful, buddy,\" Laurence called out to the reporter doing the interview, \"he'll steal your microphone.\" And the others all booed in agreement. `\"Well for me, it's the thrill of the hunt,\"` Jonas was saying and soon enough, everyone was booing. `\"Man vs. nature. Having battle with the elements.\"` `\"So as a scientist, can you actually predict tornadoes now?\"` the reporter inquired. `\"Well, no, they are very, very unpredictable,\"` Jonas admitted with a smirk, `\"as some of my more unfortunate colleagues found out earlier today-\"` Haynes rolled her eyes. \"Oh, turn him off.\" \"Please change the channel, guys,\" Elle pleaded. \"Listening to that jerk is ruinin' my meal.\" \"Yeah, turn it off,\" Maxine pleaded. `\"But we hope to change all that with a system I have devised,\"` Jonas concluded. \"God, he sucks,\" Dusty grumbled. Rabbit threw a waddled napkin at the TV screen. \"Aw, shut up.\" \"Booo!\" Joey called out. \"Turn him off,\" Rabbit grumbled. Bill turned the sound back down on the TV. \"What a wiener.\" \"He really is in love with himself,\" Jo complained, picking up her soda. \"I thought it was just a summer thing.\" And she gulped it down. \"He's gonna rue the day,\" Dusty predicted as Bill sat down across from him. \"Dude, he's gonna rue the day he came The Extreme, baby.\" \"Here, here,\" Laurence agreed. \"Amen to that,\" Elle and Maxine both agreed. Dusty grinned. \"I'm talking immanent rueage. Immanent rueage.\" \"I was just wonderin' why do you call Billy \"The Extreme\"?\" Melissa inquired, having heard the nickname several times now. \"Cuz' Billy is the extreme,\" Dusty replied and the team laughed, except for Melissa, who was confused. \"Bill is the most out of control son of a bitch in the game!\" Preacher declared, heading to the kitchen to get more food. Bill shook his head and glanced at Jo. \"No, I think I came in second.\" \"Well I've seen The Extreme in high gear,\" Dusty remarked. Jo shook her head as she reached passed him to grab a small pitcher of cream for her coffee. \"You guys need to get some new stories,\" she stated, pouring some into her cup. \"I'm gonna go clean up.\" She put the cream down, retrieved her backpack, and she headed upstairs to take a shower. \"So we get this one near Dalton-\" Dusty began, grinning widely. \"Oh, God,\" Bill groaned, realizing what story was about to be told, and the team laughed, enjoying the sight of his face turning red. \"We're way too close, and Jo got the bid on it, she's filmin' it, right,\" Dusty continued. \"And all the sudden, out of nowhere, this shity looking valiant, comes pulling up, right in the way.\" \"She starts yellin',\" said Beltzer, leaning over Melissa's shoulder. \"And this loser , stumbles out of the car, he's got like, a bottle of Jack Daniel's in his hand. He's naked-\" \"He's butt naked,\" Rabbit agreed. Beltzer nodded. \"Naked. \" Not naked,\" Bill protested, and the team laughed. \"I was not naked!\" \"He's without apparel,\" said Beltzer, grinning. \"Half naked,\" Bill amended. \"Naked,\" Dusty confirmed before going on with the story. \"So, Jo is yelling at him to get out of the way, right.\" The team laughed again. \"He just- He strolls up to the twister, and he says \"Have a drink.\" And he chucks the bottle into the twister, and it never hits the ground!\" Beltzer nodded. \"Twister caught it, and sucked it right up.\" Bill noted the perplex expression on Melissa's face. \"Honey, this is a tissue of lies,\" he told her seriously. \"See there was another Bill, an evil Bill – and I killed him!\" And the team laughed and cheered while Melissa smiled nervously. In the upstairs bedroom, Jo undressed and stepped into the shower, where she turned on the hot water and began cleaning herself off while the talking and laughter continued downstairs. 'I wish it could be like this all the time,' she thought, listening to Bill's familiar laugher. Back downstairs, the team calmed down after almost splitting their sides from laughing so hard, and went back to their food while still talking about tornadoes. \"No, that was a good size twister, what was that, an F3?\" Preacher asked, sipping his coffee. \"Solid F2,\" said Bill. Melissa had no idea what that meant and said so. \"See now you've lost me again.\" \"It's the Fujita scale,\" Bill explained. \"It measures the intensity of a tornado by how much it \"eats\".\" \"Eats?\" Melissa repeated. \"Destroys,\" Bill amended. \"The little encounter we had back there was a strong F2, F3 maybe,\" Laurence added. \"And out on the lake, those were water spouts and they're mostly harmless, unless you're a fish,\" Elle added. \"Although seeing three at once was a first,\" Maxine remarked, and there was general agreement on that. \"Bet we see some F4's today,\" Beltzer predicted. \"That'd be sweet!\" said Haynes with a smile. Bill nodded approvingly. \"4 is good, 4'll re-locate your house fairly officially.\" \"Is there an F5?\" Melissa asked, her interest becoming confusion when they all suddenly grew silent. \"What would that be like?\" \"The finger of God,\" Preacher answered after a few seconds, and his expression was almost reverent. Melissa looked at each of them, noting that they all had similar expressions, even Meg had the reverent expression on her face. \"None of you have ever seen an F5?\" she asked. \"Just one of us,\" Bill answered and he looked up a the ceiling where Jo was. After drying off and dressing herself in a white tank top and tan slacks, Jo was putting on her necklace and running her fingers through her hair when Meg entered the bedroom. \"Forget it,\" she told her niece. \"Doesn't matter what you do, you'll still be beautiful.\" Jo smiled at her aunt's reflection in the mirror. \"You're biased.\" \"Yes, I am,\" Meg agreed. \"Sounds like old times down there,\" she added. Jo nodded. \"Yes, it does.\" Meg looked at her niece thoughtfully. \"He didn't keep his part of the bargain.\" \"Which part?\" Jo asked, looking at her aunt and figured that she was talking about Bill. \"To spend his life pining for you, and die miserable and alone,\" Meg answered. Jo sighed, her expression turning sad. \"That so much to ask?\" she wondered. \"I don't know,\" her aunt admitted, shrugging. \"Bill always went his own way, which was usually the same way you were going.\" \"Seems like a long time ago,\" Jo remarked with a wistful expression on her face. \"Not so long, Jo,\" Meg corrected her niece. \"He's here, isn't he?\" Jo nodded as she watched the wind sculptures outside. \"That is so beautiful.\" After her father had been killed by the F5 twister, she and her mom had moved in with her aunt, and a few weeks later, her mother had abandoned her, stating that she couldn't live in the same town that her husband was buried in. She hadn't seen her mother since and given all that happen, she didn't really mind either. Meanwhile, Dusty was in the living room and was listening to the weather reports for anything that could hint at another tornado, and he was in luck. `\"Well, I think we have a serious weather situation-\"` \"We got one, baby!\" he cheered. \"F3! A mile outside Parlaine!\" And soon he and the team were gathering up whatever they had brought into the house, preparing to head out. `\"…city of Wakita, this is a storm that has developed in the past 15 minutes. First – Alert Doppler radar shows that this is a very intense storm-\"` was the report coming from the TV, where Jonas and his team were running for their black vans, having received word of the same tornado sighting. The team hurried out of the house, heading for the vehicles and Bill was talking to Melissa, wanting to make sure that she would be safer then she had been last time. \"You ride along with Dusty, okay, is that cool?\" he asked her as they reached the bottom of the porch. Melissa nodded. \"Okay.\" \"What's the word from NSSL?\" Dusty was asking as he put his ball cap on while Meg descended the steps with a large brown paper bag that she was putting several foiled packages in. \"Word is big!\" Haynes announced, excited. Bill nodded. \"All right, let's go, people!\" he ordered. \"You know where Jonas is?\" Jo asked Rabbit. \"Yeah, he's still in Milston, 30 miles from it,\" Rabbit answered, having been checking the maps. Jo nodded, hoping that they could beat the jerk and get Dorothy II up in the air. \"Let's all get movin'! Can we beat him?\" \"I'm working on it,\" Rabbit promised. Meg hugged and kissed her niece's cheek. \"Thanks for stopping by.\" \"I'm sorry to eat and run,\" Jo apologized, although it did tend to happen with every tornado season for the past five years or so. Meg smiled understandingly. \"It's what you live for,\" she said as her niece hurried away. Bill reached Meg, and paused long enough to plant a kiss on her cheek. \"Bye.\" \"Good to see you, Bill,\" Meg called after him. Melissa hesitated. \"Honey, I-\" \"It's okay, it's okay,\" Bill promised her as he ran after Jo, who was already halfway to the red truck. Dusty walked up to Meg and Melissa. \"Tasty cow, Aunt Meg?\" he asked hopefully, his eyes were fixed on the paper bag. Meg grinned and handed him the bag of food. \"It's for you, Dusty!\" \"Thank you, sweetheart,\" Dusty replied, delighted as he hugged Meg, and then he hugged Melissa. \"You and me, right?\" he asked as the others got into their vehicles. Melissa, feeling repulsed, hide it and nodded. \"Yes.\" Dusty was pleased. \"Sweet, sweet.\" And he went to get into the bus with his food bag. Melissa paused to offer her hand to Meg. \"Well, I- it was a pleasure meeting you.\" \"Likewise,\" Meg agreed, shaking her hand and nodded to the waiting bus. \"You'd better run!\" And she gently nudged Melissa toward the bus. Jo reached the truck and turned to Bill when he joined her, holding out her hand. \"Keys?\" \"Please,\" said Bill, handing her the keys, which she snatched up as she climbed into the truck. \"You're welcome!\" Soon, everyone was in their respective vehicles, and they had the motors running. Jo buckled herself in and spoke into the mic. \"Rabbit?\" \"Hang on!\" said Rabbit as he pulled out a road Atlas and looked it over for a route. \"Uh, let's go right through Wakita, we'll take Myers Road past the fire station, and we'll take 132 to 44 east.\" \"Ok let's go,\" said Bill into the radio. \"Rabbit, do you know any shortcuts, let us know, we need every second!\" It wasn't long before the team were driving through the town and they were soon on Myers Road. \"Okay, Rabbit, time to impress me!\" Bill ordered. `\" Okay, about a mile up there's a little detour we're gonna take, a little walk in the woods!\"` Rabbit answered and soon they were turning a winding dirt road, and through a thicket. Bill grunted as they drove over a bumpy road that also had dips in it. \"Hey, it's bumpy here, folks!\" he reported and then turned his attention to Jo. \"Okay, let's get you wired.\" He went to work, putting a wireless mic. Head-set on her, and clipping the receiver on her belt. \"Oh, excuse me,\" he muttered, unaware that she was enjoying every moment of it. \"Okay, you're on!\" Further back, Haynes and Beltzer were whooping it upas their van soared over the bumps in the road. \"Whooooohooo!\" Grinning, Beltzer called out to the team over the radio. \"See, kids? An ordinary person spends his life avoiding tense situations!\" `\"Repo man spends his life getting into tense situations, Beltzer! Wooo!\"` Dusty called back. In the lead truck, Bill rolled his eyes at their antics and spoke into the radio. \"Okay, Rabbit, what have you got?\" `\"Okay, Bill, turn left here toward that farm,\"` Rabbit instructed when a farm came into view. \"You sure about that?\" Bill asked skeptically as Jo made the turn into a corn field of all places. `\"Uh, yeah. Trust me,\"` Rabbit said reassuringly. `\"Rabbit is good, Rabbit is wise.\"` Now both Jo and Bill were rolling their eyes. \"Mother of God…\" \"Jesus Christ,\" Bill grumbled. \"This is a field, Rabbit!\" `\"I know, keep going, beyond it, right through that brush! You see that brush right in front of you?\"` \"Yeah, we see the brush, what's beyond that?\" Bill asked. `\"Beyond what?\"` Rabbit asked innocently. \"Beyond what?!\" Jo repeated, becoming annoyed. Bill was frustrated. \"The brush !\" he shouted into the mic. \"A brick wall, a bearded lady, what?\" `\"Oh, um, it's the highway, it's the highway!\"` Rabbit responded when the rest of the team also yelled at him for a location. Jo was becoming frustrated when she threw her sunglasses on the dashboard, and picked up the CB mic. \"Where's the road Rabbit?!\" In the RV, Sanders was wondering the same thing. \"Yeah, where's the road, man?\" Rabbit wouldn't admit it, but he was worried that they'd missed the road, and peered at the brush. \"It should be any moment-\" he began when, suddenly, the caravan of cars spewed right onto the highway, loud honking, just as Jonas' group passed by! \" Hell-o! \" Preacher exclaimed sarcastically. \"She's insane,\" Jonas grumbled, pissed at the near hit and snatched up the mic. \"You're insane Jo!\" he yelled into it. \"What are you trying to do, get somebody killed?!\" Pissed, Jo snatched up the mic. \"Oh, really Jonas?\" she asked sarcastically. \"It was so nice of you to stop back there and make sure we were all right!\" she yelled and Bill wrestled the mic away. \"It was very considerate of you! How could you see twelve people on the side of the road and not stop?! \" \"Okay, okay, okay, okay!\" Bill shouted, finally prying the mic out of her hands. \"Keep the channel clear.\" \"Dirtbag,\" Jo grumbled, focusing on the road. A few hours later, the sky was darkening very quickly, which mean that the team, which was now ahead of Jonas' team, were getting close to the tornado. Bill was watching the thunderstorm and his forehead was furrowed, for there was something about this that wasn't right, and he was certain that they need to go down a different road. \"We're gonna have to get off of this road,\" he announced. Jo glanced at him, confused. \"What? This is no time to guess-\" she began. \"I'm not guessing,\" Bill interrupted, still looking at the sky. \"Just make a right turn. Trust me.\" \"Do you want to drive?\" Jo asked, annoyed. \"Just turn!\" Bill snapped and she turned sharply onto a dirt road, the crew following. Further back, Eddie saw them make the turn and he glanced questioningly at his boss. \"Do we follow?\" Jonas glanced up from his laptop and shook his head, choosing not to chase after the other team. \"We do not.\" And his team drove on. Meanwhile, Sanders was trying to make sense of the sudden change of direction and he glanced at Rabbit. \"What's he doin', man?\" he wondered. \"I dunno,\" Rabbit admitted, pulling out a road map. \"Find this road,\" he said sarcastically, \"it's like, \"Bob's Road\"!\" And they both laughed. Joey was checking his laptop when it started beeping, and he saw that they had a tornado. \"We've got a touchdown!\" \"We got a touchdown, touchdown, tornado is on the ground,\" Laurence confirmed, speaking into the radio. \"Do you see it, Elle?\" Maxine asked, peering out the window as she drove and her sister. \"I don't see it.\" Elle checked her own laptop and then looked out the windows until she saw it. \"There! We've got a definite F3!\" Jo looked round, but she couldn't see the tornado. \"Where is it?\" she asked into the mic. `\"Looks like it's coming down route 33!\"` Laurence answered. \"Jo, we're on 33!\" Bill exclaimed, still looking for the twister that their team could see, but they couldn't see it… yet. ' Not good,' Jo thought as she spoke into the radio. \"What's the path?\" `\"It's going about 35 miles an hour,\"` Joey answered. Sanders and Rabbit were listening to radio, and they were looking out the windshield. \"Can you see this?\" Rabbit asked, confused. \"I cannot see this,\" Sanders replied, wondering if they were being pranked. \"Where is it? Hel-lo?!\" Rabbit spoke into the radio. \"Where you guys lookin'?\" Bill and Jo were still looking for the tornado, but they couldn't see it, much less hear it save for the thunder from the storm overhead. \"Where, where, where?\" \"Direction, Rabbit!\" Jo shouted into the radio and got a response. `\"North, northeast.\"` Bill looked in that direction, but saw nothing except storm clouds and a large hill. \"Do you see it?\" Jo shook her head. \"No.\" \"Do you got any thing up there?\" Bill asked into the radio, still trying to spot the tornado, and he was praying that it wasn't a jumper, 'cause if it was, they were going to be screwed. `\"North, northeast, you copy?\"` \"Shit, it's commin' right at us,\" Bill realized, which was way they couldn't see the darn thing yet. `\"Actually, she's gone vertical, gone vertical,\"` Laurence reported. `\"This sucker's really gainin' strength.\"` \"D'you see it?\" Jo asked, her anxiety was spiking. \"No. I can't,\" Bill grumbled and shouted into the radio. \"Beltzer, Elle, Max, we don't have a visual. Repeat, we do not have a visual! Help us out, here!\" \"Where is it?\" Jo wondered. `\"Stay on your course, guys, you should see it pretty soon,\"` Elle promised. `\"Yeah, I got it Billy,\"` Beltzer added. `\"It's the best motion I've ever seen! It's like the base of this fatty is about half a mile wide.\"` Bill was wishing that he could see the tornado already. \"Rabbit?\" `\"If you're goin' east on 7, it should be commin' right over that hill in a matter of minutes!\"` Rabbit answered proudly. `\"This is the one, man. I feel it.\"` Bill kept searching the horizon. \"It's gotta be there.\" \"Maybe it's stalled,\" Jo suggested, since there's been times when tornados would stall in a single spot for up to a full minute. \"No, I think Rabbit's right,\" Bill said as they got closer to the hill. \"It's gonna show it's ugly face right over that hill. Jo, what do you think?\" `\"You gonna go for it, Jo?\"` Dusty asked over the radio. Bill looked at her. \"Jo?\" Jo nodded and grabbed the mic. \"Time for deployment, guys, let's do it!\" she announced. In the bus, Dusty was thrilled to hear those words, and he grinned at Melissa, who was starting to question their sanity. \"Oh man, this is the fun part, sweetheart!\" Soon enough, Jo's crew stopped to set up, while Bill and Jo kept going, and it began to hail. \"Okay, we got hail,\" Bill announced as the pieces of ice bounced off the truck. \"Hail,\" Jo said into the mic. \"We got hail.\" A/N: And that's it for now. R&R; everyone![Chapter 6] Twister: Chasing the Storm A/N: Here's the next chapter and I hope everyone had a happy Halloween. Read, review, and enjoy! Disclaimer: I don't own anything from Twister . I just own any and all characters that I just happen create. CHAPTER FIVE: NIGHT OF THE TWISTER \" Mine eyes prevent the night watches, that I might meditate in thy word . \" Psalms 119:55 Oklahoma June 17, 1996… While the team was busy protecting themselves from the hail and setting up their equipment, Bill and Jo were still driving toward the hill that was hiding the tornado from them, and they were keeping an eye on the storm itself. \"Upflow, Beltzer, we have upflow, copy?!\" Jo shouted into the radio. `\"Yeah, Jo, I'm checkin' it, I'm checkin' it, she's almost up!\"` Jo nodded and looked at Bill. \"Bill, right now, this is it.\" Bill nodded. \"I'll get her ready.\" He slid open the back window, and crawled through it. The hail was soon pounding him, and hurting him. \" OW! \" Meanwhile, the team was set up and they were monitoring the tornado while keeping tabs on the red pickup at the same time. \"Do you see him?\" Dusty called out to Beltzer, who had his laptop set up on the front seat of the bus. \"Do you see him?!\" \"What?!\" Beltzer called back, having troubles hearing over the storm. \"The red truck going right towards the core!\" Dusty shouted. Beltzer shook his head. \"No!\" Melissa, who was clinging to a colorful umbrella and had been trying to get Dusty to cover his head with a plastic cover, panicked when she heard that. \"He's not talking about Billy is he?\" Meanwhile, Bill was busy turning everything on that was needed to make it possible for Dorothy to work, having covered himself with his coat. Jo glanced at him and slowed down a little to make sure that he was all right since hail was still falling from the sky. \"Are you ok?\" she called out to him. \"I'm alright, keep going!\" Bill responded, despite the fact that he had a cut on his hand from being hit with a piece of ice earlier. Jo nodded and speeded back up while Bill flipped a switch that started the red lights flashing and the sirens going strong. Dusty was able to locate the red truck with his video camera. \"Hey, Belzer, we got a view!\" \"A real good view,\" Elle confirmed from on top of the van, peering through the finder of her own video camera. \"Dorothy is active.\" \"And I'm getting excellent readings,\" Maxine confirmed. \"Yeah, I can see it!\" Beltzer agreed, goggles covering his eyes as he faced the team. \"All right, I got it! That's no moon, it's a space station! Whoooo!\" And they laughed at the Star Wars reference. Melissa was the only one not laughing and she was now certain that they were all insane. On the road, Bill was finishing prepping Dorothy II and Jo was concentrating on the road when they were suddenly attacked by stuff that'd been sucked up by the still-hidden tornado. \"Debris! We have debris!\" Bill yelped when some of the debris hit him in the back. \"Ow!\" Ignoring the pain, he worked on getting to get a strap lose. \"Come on, Come on!\" And after a few seconds, he got it loose. \"Okay!\" Meanwhile, Dusty was keeping tabs on the couple with his video camera and he was excited. \"They're in the birdcage!\" he reported, whooping it up. \"Oh my God! Oh my God!\" He then tried to get Melissa to watch through the video camera. \"Melissa, look at this! Take a peek! You can really feel it with a telephoto lens!\" \"No!\" Melissa shouted, furious at them all for putting her future husband and their boss into a dangerous situation like this. \"Oh, common' what's the matter?!\" Dusty asked loudly to be heard over the storm. \"You people are all crazy, do you know that?!\" Melissa shrieked. Dusty didn't know what she meant. \"What?!\" `\"Dusty, are you set up?\"` Jo's voice asked over the radio. `\"We're not leaving 'till we get this!\"` \"She's the craziest one of them all!\" Melissa added angrily, determined to have some stern words with the blonde if they did get out of this alive. Back on the road, Bill was finishing up on getting Dorothy ready. \"Okay, she's almost ready!\" \"Hold on, we're almost there, we're almost there!\" Jo replied and gasped when a fishing boat went flying past. \"Whoa!\" Bill exclaimed, watching as it flew out of sight since that'd been a close one. \"Stop, this is fine!\" Jo shook her head. \"Wait, we got to get closer, just a little closer!\" \"Stop, Jo!\" Bill yelled. Just then, a tricycle rammed into the windshield, cracking it, and Jo was left startled. \"Okay, that's close enough!\" And she stopped the truck, causing Bill to slam his head on the roof of the cab. \"Ow, crap!\" Bill cursed as Jo got out and ran around to the back of the truck, getting ready to pull Dorothy onto the road, and the tornado was now coming into view. \"Okay, hurry, get the tailgate!\" \"You got it?!\" Jo shouted over the noise of both the storm and the advancing tornado. Bill removed the last strap holding Dorothy in place. \"Yeah, she's all set, help me get her down! Hurry! Let's move!\" And he worked on pushing the device from behind when there was an explosion by the funnel base as it collided with a power transformer. \"Bill, hurry!\" Jo screamed, tugging on Dorothy. Bill kept trying to get Dorothy out of the truck, but he was unsuccessful. \"Damn!\" he cursed, jumping down. \"We gotta go now, common'!\" And he started pulling the blonde away from the truck. Jo tried to fight him off so that she could get back to the truck. \"We can do this!\" she shouted. \"Common', common!\" Suddenly a telephone pole fell on Dorothy, knocking her onto the road, and the sensors went spilling everywhere. \"Bill!\" Bill saw that the other telephone poles were being yanked down by the tornado. \"Get down, look out!\" he shouted, pulling her away. \"Common'! Hurry!\" And Jo screamed as Dorothy was knocked to the ground. Suddenly, the tornado was gone. \"Where – where'd it go? Where is it?!\" The rest of the team were perplex, too, when the tornado dissipated, disappearing from their displays, and to have it happen so quickly was confusing. Beltz punched the buttons on the keyboards of his laptop in frustration for a few seconds. \"What's going on?! Aw, aw, I don't believe this! What the hell?!\" And he turned from the laptop to look up at the sky, ripping off his goggles in the process. \"Where did the twister go?\" Maxine wondered. \"No idea, only that it's gone,\" said Elle, agreeing with their confusion since this wasn't normal for a tornado. Sanders looked over at Beltzer. \"What's the Doppler say?\" he asked. Sighing, Beltzer went back to the laptop to check. \"I, I-\" Preacher was looking up at the sky, and he was listening since it'd gone quiet at the same time that the tornado disappeared. \"The cone is silent.\" And then there was distant thunder. Frustrated, Beltzer spoke into the radio. \"Jo, Bill, it's over! The thing was stable, and – and - and then, then it's gone.\" On the road, however, Jo and Bill could hear the roar of the tornado, even though they couldn't see it, and they knew that it meant only one thing… it was coming back! \"It's back Bill!\" Jo exclaimed, staring at the stormy sky. \"It's not through yet!\" Bill agreed. \"You're right it's back-building! We've got a jumper here!\" Jo quickly spoke into the radio. \"Beltzer, it's back-building, we've got to track it!\" `\" Yeah, Jo, we know,\"` Beltzer confirmed, having just gotten readings from the Doppler. `\"Data's incomplete, I think you should get out of there, You copy?\"` Jo bent down and she started grabbing the sensors, trying to gather them in her jacket. \"Bill, help. Bill, Help me!\" Bill knew that they didn't have time. \"Jo, we should leave!\" And he grabbed her arm, trying to get her to safety. Jo fought to break free of his grip, trying to get to the sensors. \"No, no, no. Help me. Help me!\" \"Forget the sensors we've got to get out of here now!\" Bill yelled, struggling to keep his grip on her arm, which wasn't easy since it was clear that she'd been working out since the last time he'd seen her. \"It's gonna drop!\" \"Beltzer will see!\" Jo snapped. \"If it drops, if it's anywhere near us, it will kill us!\" \"It's not gonna drop anywhere near us, it's gonna drop right on us!\" Bill yelled back, dragging her toward the truck. Jo tried to grab the sensors as they headed for the truck, but he wasn't giving her a chance. \"Bill, turn this- wait, wait, wait! No, Bill!\" she shouted as he shoved her into the truck, and he climbed in. Soon they were reversing back down the road. \"No, no, no, no, no! Go back!\" \"Forget it, Jo, forget it!\" he snapped, knowing that there wasn't time. \"Go back, it's not too late!\" Jo screamed as he started to drive away. \"Go back!\" Bill shook his head. \"Forget it, it's too late!\" And he stopped the truck when it started raining and the tornado didn't return, which meant that it was over… for now. Jo jumped out of the car, and bending down to the ground, began picking up the sensors. \"Help me! Help me!\" \"What are you doing?!\" Bill yelped, getting out of the truck and running after her. Jo kept trying to gather up the scattered sensors. \"Help me!\" Bill sighed, stopping and watching her. \"Jo, the pack's wasted, it's over!\" Jo whirled to face him, her face red with rage, tears mingling with the rain running down her face. \"What's the matter with you?! We can still do this!\" \"Jesus Christ, listen to yourself, you're obsessed!\" Bill shouted, frustrated that she was acting like this. \"You've never seen what that thing can do,\" Jo snarled, dropping the sensors and advancing toward him, \"so don't even talk to me about-\" Bill pointed in the direction of where the tornado had been earlier. \"I just saw it-\" \"You've never seen it miss this house,\" Jo hissed, shoving him back a little, and she was beyond reason at the moment, \"and miss that house, and come after you!\" Bill stared at her, realizing for the first time why she keep putting herself in danger, and why this was so important to her. \"Christ, Jo, is that what you think it did?!\" he demanded, and both were unaware that the team was hearing every word being spoken, and that Melissa could hear them, too. Jo turned away, annoyed with Bill. \"I don't know,\" she admitted, walking away. Bill ran after her. \"Jesus, Jo, why can't you just forget it?\" he asked. Jo stopped and turned back to him. \"You don't understand, okay?\" she asked, feeling drained after all the failures. \"You'll never know.\" \"When's it gonna be enough, huh?\" Bill asked, staring at her intensely. \"How close do you have to get-\" and when she tried walking away, he grabbed her and turned her around. \"Talk to me!\" he snapped. \"Jo, things go wrong, you can't explain it, you can't predict it! Killing yourself won't bring your dad back. I'm sorry he died, but it was a long time ago. You gotta move on. Stop living in the past and look at what you've got right in front of you!\" \"What are you saying?\" Jo asked, finally looking at him. \"Me, Jo,\" Bill answered, his voice cracking slightly. \" Me .\" The rest of the team exchanged looks, several of them glancing at Melissa, who'd heard everything and was clearly upset, and they went to work on packing up their gear until it was time to chase after the next tornado. Once they were all packed up, they drove to where Jo and Bill were, retrieved the sensors, some of which were going to have to be repaired, and then they drove off to find a place to spend the night as the sun started to set. Over at the NSSL, the staff was exhausted, but they knew that they hadn't seen the last of the tornadoes, and many of them were eating take out while monitoring the progress of the storm cells, while others were taking some much-needed naps before going back into the deep end to deal with the next round of tornadoes. Murphy was watching one of the monitors and her eyes widened with shock at what she was seeing. \"Hey, Bryce!\" she called out. \"What?\" Bryce called back from where he was pouring himself another cup of coffee, having lost count after about the hundredth cup. Murphy waved him over. \"You'd better get over here, take a look at this.\" Bryce joined her and looked at the radar. \"The gate – the gate velocities are maxed out,\" he said, his heart dropping into his stomach, \"If those two cells converge-\" Murphy nodded. \"Inbounds and outbounds have doubled.\" And they looked at each other, worried. Night had fallen over the county and a thunder storm was rumbling above the drive-in that the team were going to spend the night in the motel while on the big outdoor screen, Stephen King's The Shining was playing, and currently Tommy was riding around on his tricycle and was face-to-face with the creepy twin girls. While the team was checking the weather reports for tornado sightings, Melissa was in one of the motel rooms, having switched a white shirt and jeans, and she plopped on the bed while the TV was talking about the latest weather report. She started playing with her engagement ring and was ponder whether she should go through with the wedding with Bill or not. On the way to the motel, she'd chosen to ride with the Martin sisters, and through them, she learned of how an F5 tornado had been responsible for the death of Jo's father when she'd been a little girl, and her mother had abandoned her, so Meg was the only that Jo had left outside of the team. 'Bill still loves her,' she thought, mulling it over. 'He tells me that he doesn't, but after today, I wonder…' Outside, Jo went up to the snack bar and peered through the slot to speak to the employees. \"Excuse me, can I have 8 coffees and two hot chocolates to go, please?\" she requested. One of the employees looked at her, surprised to hear an order for eight coffees. \"Eight and two?\" Jo nodded. \"Yeah.\" She grabbed a pen that was sitting on a trey, and she sat down at a table. Taking out the divorce papers, she signed the last page, with a heavy heart, for she knew that her day was up and the odds of Dorothy ever flying weren't looking good. She went back to the counter to return the pen when Bill walked up to the counter. \"Two coffees, please,\" he requested of the employee when she brought Jo's order. \"Long day,\" he remarked. Jo nodded, adding sugar and cream to some of the coffees. \"Uh- huh.\" \"You know, I've been thinking about the sensors,\" Bill said, thinking back to the tornado incident earlier. \"The way they scattered out there today on the highway. I'm starting to wonder if the funnel will carry them like we thought.\" \"Too light?\" Jo suggested, having been wondering the same thing. Bill sighed. \"I don't know, maybe the whole thing's too light,\" he admitted. \"What can we do about that?\" Jo wondered. Bill shrugged, having been wracking his idea for an idea. \"I'm not sure.\" Back in the motel room, Melissa was lying on the bed, looking at her ring, and at that moment, the screen turned to static. Grabbing the remote, she turned the TV off and it was then that she noticed that it was unusually quiet outside, save for the movie playing nearby. At the counter, the employee brought over two coffees. \"Thank you,\" Bill said and he turned to go when the TV screen went to static, and he turned back to it, frowning since he knew that was never a good sign. \"Jo…\" Glancing up, Jo stares at the TV, and then they turned to look at the stormy sky, for something was coming, something bad. Still in the motel room, Melissa was feeling uneasy as she watched the window curtains billow gently. She finally got off the bed and she went, staring at the sky. The wind was softly howling howling now and, as one, Jo and Bill moved away from the counter, their coffee and hot chocolate forgotten as they looked in the direction of the movie screen. The wind was grows louder, and there was a low rumble. At the bus, Dusty was watching the Doppler radar, and he felt his heart sink into his stomach as he stared with growing horror of what was heading their way. \"Jesus, it's coming,\" he gasped, dropping the papers he'd been looking at. He jumped out of the bus and he starting running toward Jo and Bill, screaming. \"Jo! Bill! It's coming! It's headed right for us!\" Bill shook his head, having just realized the same thing. \"It's already here. Everybody underground now!\" he ordered, running back toward the repair shop, where the team's vehicles were parked, and they were already running inside to find cover, just as the tornado sirens started going off. Melissa became frightened when she heard the sirens. \"Billy!\" Bill grabbed Melissa's hand and they ran towards the warehouse. \"Honey! Come on!\" And he got her inside before she could ask what was going on. He looked back and saw that Jo was still staring at the direction that the tornado was coming from, and she seemed to be in a trance, obvious to the deafening rumble, the winds turning to gales that were blowing papers and lighter objects around. \"Jo! Jo! Jo, Common'!\" Jo was standing transfixed, staring at the tornado. Suddenly she snapped out of it and ran to the snack bar, banging on the windows to warn the employees, screaming. \"Get underground, take cover right now, let's go!\"And they all run to the warehouse. \"The doors!\" Dusty shouted, tugging on the doors, and the guys helped her close them. \"Close the Doors! Doors! Doors!\" And then Bill ran back out to get Jo. \"Bill!\" Instead, Bill helped one last employee from the snack bar inside. \"Get inside. JO, COMMON'!\" he shouted at the blonde. Jo was running toward him, but then she saw Laurence, hiding under the steering wheel of his car, and goes back to help him. \"What are you doing, come back!\" Bill shouted at her. Jo opened the car door and held her hand out to Laurence. \"Come on, take my hand.\" Laurence shook his head, shaking since he was terrified. \"I can't-\" \"Take my hand!\" Jo shouted and he grabbed it. Pulling him out of the van, they both run to the warehouse. \"Come on!\" Bill shouted frantically. \"Hurry! Go! Go! Go! Let's go!\" And he shoved them inside, just as Dusty rolled the door shut. \"Everybody down in the pit! Get down! Let's go, everybody down! Jo, move, common'!\" Everyone scrambled to the pit in the floor of the warehouse, where they all huddled up in a corner in fetal position. Just then, the whole warehouse began to shake, and the windows imploded. \"Stay calm!\" Bill shouted when a high pressure water hose suddenly came loose from it's latch, and it flew around. Dusty and Preacher both tried to catch the hose, knowing that it could do some serious damage if they didn't stop it, and then Preacher was able to garb it. \"I got it, I got it! Hah hah!\" Suddenly, a hub cap flew through the air and cut across Preacher's forehead. He immediately went into shock as he slumped against the wall of the pit and Jo held his forehead to stop the bleeding. \"My head!\" \"You're okay!\" Jo shouted over the roaring as the tornado went past, having just destroyed the movie screen moments ago. Bill was holding onto Melissa, who was freaking out big time, having reached her limit. \"It'll be over soon!\" \"This is insane!\" Melissa screamed, covering her head with her hands. \"This is insane! I don't like this! This is driving me crazy! I can't do this anymore!\" \"Stay calm!\" Bill shouted, and they all screamed in terror when a car rammed through the ceiling, followed by the neon sign for the drive in theater crashing ont op of the car. \"It's okay, honey! It'll be okay!\" Suddenly, the winds started to die down, and the lights buzzed and went out. A/N: Talk about an intense day.

CHAPTER SIX: GIVING DOROTHY WINGS \" And whatsoever ye do in word or deed, do all in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God and the Father by him . \" Colossians 3:17 Wakita, Oklahoma June 18, 1996… It was past midnight and Meg was in her bedroom, reading a book with a fan running, and on the TV, a movie starring Judy Garland was playing. When the wind chimes outside her window started going crazy and the TV screen switched to static, she grew tensed, put her book, and she headed for the door of her bedroom with Mose following her. At the demolished drive-in, paramedics and police cars were pulling up as the door to the warehouse were shoved open, and everyone came out to take stock of the destruction and for the paramedics to treat those who'd gotten hurt, which included Preacher. Dusty went to his bus, which had survived the attack, and he sighed as he climbed in to listen to the weather reports to find out where the tornado was heading next. \"Man…\" \"Oh, look at the truck, it's trashed!\" Bill had his arm around Melissa's shoulders, and he was surveying the damage. \"Holy…\" and then he moved away to help check on the surviving vehicles since two of them had been destroyed. Melissa was staring around in disbelief when Beltzer came up next to her. \"Is that what it was like up on that hill?\" she asked, realizing that seeing the aftermath of a tornado on TV was vastly different from seeing it in real life, and living through it, too. Beltzer shook his head. \"That? No. We were lucky,\" he told her. \"Those were just down drafts and microbursts. Tornado just side swept us.\" Bill went over to Elle and Maxine, who were cleaning off the roof of their van, which hadn't been damaged, but a lot of debris was lying on top of it. \"Is the Moroni Mobile still able to run?\" he asked. \"Yeah, it survived better then some,\" Maxine confirmed. \"Is Melissa ok?\" she asked. \"She should be,\" Bill replied hopefully. Jo was in the back of one of the ambulances, where Preacher was getting a bandage wrapped around his head when Dusty came up. \"Can you tell which way it's headed?\" she asked, referring to the tornado. \"It's backing northeast,\" Dusty informed her, his expression grim. \"It's um… it looks to hit Wakita head on.\" And the moment he said those words, his eyes widened and he bolted back toward the bus. Frantic, Jo jumped out of the ambulance and she ran for the bus, fearing for her aunt. \"I'm goin'. I'm goin', let's go, let's go!\" \"We're going!\" Dusty shouted and the team sprang into action, deciding who would ride with who since they were now down two vehicles, and they all were yelling frantically. Bill ran after her. \"Jo, wait!\" Jo was already in the bus, looking for one of the cellphones. \"Where's the phone?!\" \"The lines are down,\" Beltzer informed her. \"Jo, I already tried.\" \"We're going,\" Jo stated. \"Damn it,\" Bill muttered when he heard that the tornado, an F4, was heading straight for Wakita. \"Hang on, I'll drive.\" And he ran back to talk to Melissa, who wasn't far off and was staring at the destruction. Rabbit, having rescued most of his maps from the wrecked RV, came up, having figured out a route. \"Hey, Jo, look,\" he said, showing her on the map. \"We can jump on the 38 exchange and cross highway 132.\" Bill hurried over to Melissa, who turned to look at him. \"Hey, honey, I gotta go,\" he informed her. \"It's Meg.\" Melissa nodded with a thoughtful expression since she'd came to a decision. \"I'm goin' back.\" \"Good, good, you'll be safe at the motel,\" Bill said with a faint smile. \"I'll see you in the morning.\" Melissa shook her head. \"I won't be there.\" \"What?\" Bill asked, confused. \"Why? What are you saying?\" \"I'm saying goodbye,\" Melissa answered. Bill realized that she was leaving him for good, especially when she gave him back the engagement ring. \"No-\" Melissa smiled at him sadly, closing his hand over the ring. \"You know, I can't compete with this,\" she confessed. \"I don't even know where to start!\" \"Wait, don't do this now, please,\" Bill pleaded. \"Please!\" Melissa shook her head gently. \"Sooner or later it would have ended, we both know that.\" Bill didn't want to believe that. \"Please-\" Melissa didn't let him finish. \"The funny thing is, I'm not that upset,\" she added. \"What does that mean?\" Rabbit ran by at that point. \"We can do it! Come on, let's move!\" Bill watched him for a moment and then looked back at his former fiancée. \"I never meant for any of this to happen,\" he told her, and he was being honest. \"I know, Billy, I know,\" Melissa agreed. \"It's okay.\" \"Bill, come on!\" Dusty called out. \"You go ahead,\" Melissa insisted, motioning to Jo, who was watching them. \"She needs you. I hope that Aunt Meg's okay.\" \"What about you?\" Bill asked, hating that this was happening. \"Oh, don't worry about me,\" Melissa assured him, still smiling sadly. \"I know my way home.\" And she walked away. \"We can be in Wakita in about an hour,\" Rabbit called out, getting his attention. \"Bill, common'!\" Bill stared at Melissa's retreating form a moment longer, and then he ran for his truck, where Jo was waiting for him. It was time to go. An hour later, the team drove into the ruins of what had once been Wakita, the \"Welcome to Wakita\" sign was lying on the ground, there were bonfires in the streets, along with debris scattered everywhere, babies were crying, and the families were picking through the wreckage while the rescue teams were searching for survivors. Bill was staring at the devastation as he drove by. \"Oh my God.\" \"They had no warning,\" Jo whispered, staring at the destruction and she lingered on a family that consisted of a mother, father, and a little girl, reminding too much of her own childhood. She returned to the present when Meg's house came into view, and it'd been compacted into one story. Strangely, most of the wind sculptures were still standing. \"Oh my God.\" She immediately jumped out of the truck before it stopped moving, and ran towards the house. Parking the truck, Bill grabbed two flashlights and ran after her. \"Jo, Wait!\" Jo reached the house and started climbing, calling into the upstairs window. \"Meg?!\" Bill ran over and he climbed up after her. \"Jo, wait!\" He soon reached where she was, which hadn't been easy. \"Meg?!\" Jo screamed, reaching the window and was peering inside. \"Careful, this house could go any second,\" Bill warned her. Jo climbed inside with Bill right behind her. \"Meg?!\" \"Jo, take a flashlight!\" Bill shoved one in her hand as they stepped into the house, which was now a labyrinth of debris. Jo turned the flashlight on, looking around frantically for her aunt. \"Meg?!\" \"This house is ready to go,\" Bill muttered, amazed that it was still standing after being hit by an F4. \"Meg?!\" Jo shouted again, and she jumped when a dresser toppled over. Bill pulled her to his side. \"Careful.\" Jo, however, was frantic. \"Meg?!\" \"Meg?!\" Bill called out. Suddenly, they heard a dog whimpering. \"Shhh! You hear that?\" Jo asked, straining her ears. \"What?\" Bill asked. Jo moved toward the sound of the dog's whimpers. \"I think I hear something.\" \"Easy does it,\" Bill cautioned her as they followed the sound until they reached a hole in the floor, where they could see Meg's dog \"Mose\" below them, and lying on top of mattress was Meg, who was pinned down by a wall framing, and there was blood on the front of her nightgown and on her forehead. \"Meg!\" Jo gasped fearfully. \"Mose, boy!\" Bill called out and the dog waggled his tail in response. \"Mose! I think she's down here,\" Jo said. \"Meg? We're here! We're coming down!\" And they worked on climbing down, pausing whenever the house creaked, and it wasn't long before they were at her aunt's side. Bill checked her over and she groaned, waking up. \"Meg!\" he gasped and he looked to Jo. \"We gotta get this off of her,\" he added as Meg mumbled something. \"Ready?\" \"Don't move, don't move,\" Jo told her aunt as she helped Bill removing the framing and pulled her out from underneath it. \"Watch her head, watch her head.\" \"Go!\" Bill grunted as they lifted the framing off her. \"I got it.\" \"Easy, easy, easy,\" said Jo as she helped Meg sit up. \"Are you okay?\" \"Oh, I'm all right… I'm fine,\" Meg replied groggily. Suddenly the TV slid toward them, but its progress was stopped since it was being held back by the cord. Still, they all covered their heads, just to be safe. \"Get down!\" Bill warned. Jo covered her aunt's head. \"Oh, God…\" \"We gotta go, hurry! Let's go!\" Bill ordered and he turned to Meg. \"Think you can walk?\" Suddenly the cord snapped and the TV crashed to the floor! \"Watch out!\" Bill yelped as they cowered when the TV crashed to the floor and exploded with sparks. Outside, the team was heading for the house, when it began to buckle under itself. \"Oh my God,\" Elle gasped, her eyes wide. \"It's going!\" \"Jo and Bill went in there to get Meg,\" said Maxine, alarmed. Dusty ran toward the house with Rabbit, Sanders, Joey, and Beltzer on his heels. \"Meg! Meg! Meg, Bill!\" He started climbing reach the window where Jo and Bill entered. \"Some one take my – Joey, take my watch.\" And he handed off his watch to his friend before scaling the wall to the window. Beltzer was right behind him. \"Go, go! Careful!\" Dusty reached the window and he was about to go in. \"Bill?\" And he backed up when Jo and Bill came out, carrying Aunt Meg. \"We're okay, we're coming out!\" Jo called out as Dusty helped them get Meg down the wall. \"Get an ambulance over here!\" Bill shouted. \"Get an ambulance, Lawrence, Now! Go!\" Dusty ordered sharply and Lawrence ran to flag down an ambulance. Soon an ambulance came over, a paramedic hopped out and, after getting a stretcher, they headed to the house. Joey assisted in help Meg down the wall to the ground, where the paramedics were waiting. \"All right.\" Rabbit was also helping Meg down. \"There you go.\" Meg was focused on getting to the ground. \"Okay, okay.\" \"How 'bout some steak and eggs!\" Beltzer joked, hoping to lighten the mood. Meg laughed, already feeling better despite having her house fall on her. \"How nice of you all to come over.\" And they kept talking to her as they reached the ground and got her to lie down on the stretcher. \"Bill!\" she called out. \"Grab Mose for me, I think he's a little shaken up!\" Bill, who was still near the window, smiled and waved to her. \"Don't worry I'll get him,\" he promised. \"Mose!\" And he went back inside the house. \"Is she okay?\" Jo asked the paramedic. \"We'll probably keep her overnight, just to be safe,\" the paramedic replied after confirming the head wound wasn't that bad, despite the blood. \"Overnight?\" Meg repeated, offended. \"Forget it. I'm all right.\" Jo frowned at her aunt. \"You're going to the hospital,\" she insisted. \"Okay, I'll go,\" Meg grumbled, \"but I'm gonna drive myself.\" Rabbit shook his head since he had bad news for her. \"Honey, your car is in a tree around the corner.\" Meg groaned and lay back on the stretcher, defeated. \"Ohhh.\" Bill came out of the house and made his way down the wall, carrying Mose. \"It's okay, it's okay.\" Just as he reached the ground, the house behind him collapsed the rest of the way. Meg groaned again. \"Ohh!\" \"It's a miracle we were able to get Meg and Mose out of the house when we did,\" Elle remarked and Maxine agreed, both shaken by the experience. Ten minutes later, Dusty was in his bus, listening to the weather report, and it wasn't good news for the county. `\"The F4 that hit Wakita has now moved on to the north-east, I've just gotten word in that an even stronger tornado has now started to form 25 miles south of Wakita, but right now the two storm systems are funneling back, the National Weather Service saying that this is highly unusual and they are saying that this tornado could be the strongest in the state in more than 30 years-\"` \"Oh my God,\" Dusty muttered, realizing what this probably meant, and he motioned Beltzer and the Martin sisters over. \"Look at this, look at this.\" Meanwhile, Meg was sitting in the back of the ambulance wearing a wrist brace, and she had a bandage around the head. She was surprised when Jo climbed in and sat next to her. \"Hey, what're you doin'?\" she asked. \"I wanna see how you are,\" Jo answered, putting down her backpack and looked to the paramedic. \"How is she?\" she asked. \"I was worried about you,\" she added to her aunt. \"She's all right,\" the paramedic told her before exiting to check on other injured people. Jo examined her aunt's wrist. \"Oh, look at this-\" she moaned. \"It's nothing,\" Meg reassured her niece, having gotten worst burns from welding. \"He says I have a bump on the head, and maybe a broken wrist…\" Jo tsked. \"Let me see that.\" And she kept looking at her aunt's wrist again. Meg rolled her eyes and gently pulled her wrist out of her niece's hands. \"There's nothin' to see, it doesn't even hurt.\" \"I'm sorry I wasn't there,\" Jo apologized, using a cloth to clean her aunt's face. \"Stop blaming yourself, you got me out of the house,\" Meg stated and sighed when tears began to stream down her niece's face. \"Jo, it's gotta stop,\" she said, changing the subject to the tornado issue. \"I didn't have any warning. The sirens went off a few seconds before it hit, I didn't even get down the stairs.\" Dusty came over just then with some news. \"Jo. I'm sorry, uh, I was listening to the radio,\" he said hesitantly, \"and, I mean, I don't even know if you wanna know, but I, it's happening, the NSSL's predicted an F5.\" Meg noted her niece's expression upon hearing that there was an F5 out there. \"Jo, it could of happened to somebody else,\" she pointed out. \"You, you go stop it.\" Jo began crying, feeling overwhelmed by everything. \"I don't know how.\" \"Well, I think you do,\" her aunt told her, squeezing her hand. \"You've been chasing these things since you were a little kid. It's what you do. Go. Do it.\" Bill looked up when the ambulance pulled away, and he saw Jo, who was facing the house, and staring at Meg's wind sculpture. Haynes noticed, slapping Joey on the arm and pointing, and Elle and Maxine both turned to look, surprised since they'd expected Jo to go with her aunt. Concerned, Bill walked over to her. \"You all right?\" he asked, his concern growing when she didn't answer. \"I thought you'd go to the hospital with Meg.\" And when Jo still didn't react, still staring at the wind chimes. \"Jo? What is it?\" he asked. \"What is it?\" After a few seconds of staring at the wind chimes, Jo finally spoke and she was smiling. \"I know how to make Dorothy fly. Bill looked at the wind sculpture for a second, and he realized what she was getting at. \"Of course. Of Course!\" Pleased, Jo head over to the team with Bill at her side. \"All right, I need every aluminum can you can find!\" she ordered. \"We need cutters and duct tape!\" Bill added, heading for his red truck. \"Haynes, Beltzer, I want to get the last two Dorothy's on the back of my truck, and I want everyone working on it.!\" As the team scattered to find everything they would need, Dusty laughed, figuring that they were going after the F5. \"We're gone!\" The sun was starting to rise as the team drove over a bridge, and in the back of the bus, half of the crew were busy cutting pin-wheel fans out of aluminum cans and screwing them onto the sensors. Preacher was driving the bus while rubbing Mose's head, having decided that it was best to keep Meg's dog with them until she was out of the hospital and found a new place to live until her house could be rebuilt. Cars were going the other direction honk their horns as an F5 twister spun in the distance. `\" Dusty, you ready for us?\"` Jo asked over the radio. \"Yeah, yeah, we're good!\" Dusty confirmed, holding up one of the modified sensors, which now looked like an ornament with wings. \"We're good? We're good? Very good!\" Pulling to the side of the road, Bill climbed onto the back, where the two remaining Dorothy's were located, and he was taking the lids off when the team arrived. \"Let's go, come on!\" \"We get 'em done?\" Jo asked, also getting out of the truck. Bill nodded. \"I think so.\" The team began pulling out boxes of sensors, now with the fans attached, and passed them up to Bill, Rabbit, and Sanders, who were pouring them into Dorothy 3 and Dorothy 4 until both were filled, and they put the lids back on. \"Beautiful!\" Dusty cheered. Bill smiled as both lids were attached to the Dorothy's. \"Okay, okay!\" \"Great job, guys, just be ready to report,\" said Beltzer. \"Be careful, all right?\" Jo nodded. \"Don't follow us close,\" she advised. \"All right, you got it, boss,\" Joey agreed. \"We'll be ready to record,\" Elle promised and Maxine agreed. Rabbit nodded. \"Okay!\" \"We're back in business!\" Joey cheered , and they all hopped back into their vehicles. \"Come on, let's go!\" Dusty shouted from the bus. A/N: Next week will be the final chapter for this story. See you all next week! R&R; everyone![Chapter 8] Twister: Chasing the Storm A/N: Here's the final chapter, folks. Yes, once again I am posting today since I have an early shift at the movie theater tomorrow, and trust me, it's been crazy busy at work. Read, review, and enjoy! Disclaimer: I don't own anything from Twister . I just own any and all characters that I just happen create. CHAPTER SEVEN: F5 TORNADO! \" His going forth is from the end of the heaven, and his circuit unto the ends of it: and there is nothing hid from the heat thereof . \" Psalms 19:6 Oklahoma June 18, 1996… Jo and Bill drove down the road, following the massive F5, and they soon figured out where to put Dorothy 3. \"Half a mile more?\" she asked. \"That's sounds right,\" Bill agreed. \"I figure we'll put it right in the middle of the road.\" \"Unless you think somebody'll hit it,\" Jo teased. Bill snickered. \"Nobody'll be there.\" As the F5 tornado approached the road that Jo and Bill were on, he stopped the car, and they got out. The tornado was on the road, directly in front of them. Bill goes around and he and Jo took Dorothy # 3, which was active and ready to go, out of the back of the truck. \"Hurry!\" Bill shouted over the roar of the tornado. \"Let's go, common'!\" And they put it out in the road for the tornado to take. \"Okay, that's good!\" \"You got it?\" Jo asked. Bill nodded. \"Let's go!\" They got back in the truck, and Jo grabbed the CB radio}. \"Dusty, you in position?\" Jo asked. `\"Yeah, we're prime, ready for contact!\"` Dusty confirmed, excited. Bill drove them a good distance away, and they stopped to watch the tornado. \"This is it,\" Jo said, excited. \"It's gonna work,\" Bill agreed. Grinning, Jo spoke into the radio. \"Just another minute, Dusty!\" `\"We're ready for it!\"` Jo and Bill pulled themselves out the windows, so that they could watch, and Jo got out the video camera. However, something was clearly wrong when Dorothy started rolling back and forth across the road. \"Common'', common' take her!\" Jo shouted. Bill frowned, realizing what was wrong. \"It's too light-\" \"No it's not!\" Jo protested, even as Dorothy kept rolling across the road and back again. \"We're losing it!\" Bill exclaimed. Jo refused to believe it. \"No we're not! She can still fly!\" Suddenly an uprooted tree came flying out of the tornado and it tipped Dorothy over. Just then, the tornado decided to change direction… towards Jo and Bill. Alarmed, they both duck back inside the truck. \"Let's go!\" \"My God!\" They tried to drive away, but the car get stuck when a second uprooted tree collided with the truck in the middle of the road. Spinning them around until they were facing the incoming tornado. \"Oh my God,\" Jo moaned, positive that they were to be killed… just like her father years ago. \"Common'!\" Bill grumbled, trying to get them off the tree, but the wheels were spinning uselessly. \"Get us off this thing!\" Jo shouted. Bill was still trying to get them off the tree. \"Comon'!\" \"Bill, kick it!\" Jo shouted. \"Bill! Let's go! Right now! Hurry!\" And Bill was still floorin the gas, trying to get the truck off the tree. At that exact moment, Jo saw something shiny flashing inside the tornado. \"What is that?!\" Bill looked up, just in time to see the same shiny object. \"What is that?\" As the metallic object came into view again, they saw that it was a truck with a gas tanker attached to it, and Jo felt her fear skyrocket to a whole new level. \"Bill, hurry! HURRY! HURRY! \" \"This is not good!\" Bill exclaimed, flooring the gas pedal no success as the tanker came flying out of the tornado. \"Hurry!\" Jo screamed. As the tanker came flying toward them, Bill threw his whole body weight onto the gas pedal. \"Hold On!\" he shouted as the tanker nudged the truck free, and he drove them down the road as quickly as possible. Suddenly the tanker fell to the ground right in front of them, exploding and with no other option, they drove right through it with Jo screaming, and they came out the other side, with no damage of any kind. \"Son of a bitch!\" Bill gasped, amazed that they made it through it. `\"Jo, Bill, You all right?!\"` Dusty called out over the radio. `\"Can you guys hear me? You okay?\"` Jo grabbed the mic and he spoke into it. \"We're okay.\" `\"Jo, Bill, did you see that explosion?\"` Dusty asked. \"We saw it,\" Jo answered humorlessly. Rabbit spoke next over the radio. `\"This one, she's still moving northeast on 80, you copy?\"` he asked. \"This is it,\" Bill said. \"Last one.\" Jo nodded. \"Last time.\" Meanwhile, Jonas and Eddie were driving after the tornado with DOT 3, and Jonas was certain that he was going to be victorious. `\"Mobile Lab to Mobile 1, ground speed still increasing, the base must be a mile wide, we can't see it anymore! What is your location?\"` Jonas spoke into the radio. \"We're right along side her,\" he informed his team, eyes fixed on the tornado. \"She's beautiful. We're getting ready to place, so hold back a bit, prepare to monitor.\" Jo and Bill were driving along a different road, listening to the reports over the radio, and they were looking for Jonas and his crew. \"They have to be there somewhere,\" said Bill, searching for some sign of their rival near the tornado. Meanwhile, Jonas was getting ready to deploy his instrument pack. \"Okay, path is stable, copy that? Men, this is it! This is the one! Stay sharp back there!\" he ordered. Bill frowned when he heard that. \"They have position,\" he told Jo. \"They could make it.\" Jo shook her head, recalling what happen with Dorothy 3 earlier. \"Not unless they anchored the pack,\" she pointed out, grabbed the mic, and she spoke into the radio. \"Jonas? This is Jo. Can you hear me?\" `\"Not now, Harding,\"` Jonas responded, mildly surprised to hear her. \"Jonas, listen to me,\" Jo said seriously. \"The pack is too light, the twister will toss it before it reaches the core, you have to anchor it.\" Jonas raised his eyebrows, surprised that she was giving him advise and he responded. \"Oh, sharing valuable information, Jo?\" he teased. \"I'll consider that, thank you.\" \"Jonas, listen to me!\" Jo insisted, realizing that he wasn't going to take her seriously. \"Don't be a-\" she broke off when Bill looked at her. \"What? Do you see them?\" she asked. Bill took the mic from her, and he spoke into it. \"Jonas, what's your position?\" he asked, positive that he saw the van near the twister. `\"Oh, howdy, Bill,\"` Jonas said with a sneer in his voice. `\"We are heading northeast running parallel and about to pull ahead of it on the left, why? \"` \"Hang back a minute, we've got a pretty good view from back here,\" Bill advised, eying the tornado. \"She could shift her track, and if she does, she's gonna come right at you! D'you copy?\" Eddie frowned and looked at his boss. \"Maybe we should do what he says,\" he suggested. \"He's never put us in harm's way. \"When I want your opinion, I'll give it to you,\" Jonas snapped, annoyed. \"Keep your mouth shut, put your foot on the gas, and stay on this heading.\" `\"It's unbelievable!\"` Dean exclaimed. Jonas frowned, wondering what he was talking about. \"What is it, what's wrong?\" he asked. `\"The base is so, huge! It must be at least, a mile wide! Do you copy that, Dr. Miller?\"` Hearing this, Jo and Bill exchanged alarmed expressions since they knew that the twister was going to shift any second, and Bill spoke into the mic again. \"Jonas, listen to me. This is not-\" \"Get off this frequency, Bill!\" Jonas snapped, fed up, and he switched off the radio. 'I know what I'm doing, and they can go suck eggs.' Frustrated that Jonas wouldn't listen to them, Jo and Bill watched the tornado, and sure enough, they could see the changes occurring. \"She's shifting,\" Jo said fearfully. \"Oh my God,\" said Bill and then he yelled into the mic again. \"Jonas, I'm telling you… Eddie, I know you can hear me! Turn around now! Get out of there!\" But it was too late. Jonas' eyes widened in horror when the tornado suddenly shifted onto the road they were on, and a section of a radio tower came flying out. \"Look out!\" he screamed, but it slammed through the windshield, killing Eddie instantly. The black Windstar was then snatched up by the massive twister. Jo and Bill watched helplessly as the black Windstar flew through the air, circling several times, and then it crashed and to the ground, exploding. Jo flinched at this and Bill threw down the radio mic in a fit of rage. \"Damn it!\" he cursed, hitting the steering wheel. \"Stupid.\" And he angrily hunched over the steering wheel. \"We tried,\" Jo said sadly, knowing that there was nothing they could've done to get through Jonas' thick skull, even if they had gotten to him in time. \"There's nothing we could do.\" Bill shook his head, he knew that there was something they could do, and it was reason they were out there chasing tornadoes in the first place. \"Yes there is.\" An hour later, Jo and Bill were driving down the road, chasing after the F5 tornado and they were getting updates from their team, who were set up far away, and they were monitoring their first ever F5, which was like seeing the hand of God for them. \" Bill, Jo, ground speed is increasing,\"` Beltzer reported. `\"Get ahead of it as fast as you can or she's gonna bury ya!\"` And it was at that moment that debris started flying past the truck, narrowly missing them, and it wasn't small debris in the slightest. \"Debris!\" Jo yelped as farming equipment came crashing down on the road directly ahead of them. \"Dusty, we have debris!\" \"Debris?!\" Bill exclaimed, yanking the wheel doing his best to drive around the falling and crashing equipment, which consisted of cars, tractors, and road signs. It was falling everywhere, and Jo was directing Bill as it fell around them. \" RIGHT! \" Bill swerved right. \" LEFT! \" Bill swerved left. \" RIGHT! \" Bill swerved right. \" LEFT! \" Bill swerved left. Jo yelped when a tire bounced off the windshield. \" DUCK! \" \"What now?\" Bill wondered as the tire rolled away, and he was hoping that he wouldn't regret asking that question. \"I have no idea,\" Jo admitted, out of breath from all the screaming earlier. `\" Bill, Jo, you still with us?\"` Dusty asked over the radio. Before either of them could answer, suddenly a house came rolling along and stopped in the middle of the road. \"Oh my God,\" Jo moaned. \"I think we're goin' in!\" Bill yelled, flooring the gas pedal since there wasn't any way to avoid the house. Jo held onto the roof and she screamed. \" AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH! \" And they plunge through the house, coming out the other side through the back porch window. Bill was definite rattled at this point. \"Maybe we should get off of this road,\" he suggested. Jo nodded, also rattled. \"I think you may be right.\" `\" Jo, Bill, you all right?\"` Dusty asked, having seen everything through the video camera. Jo grabbed the mic and spoke into it. \"Yes. You guys set up?\" she aksed. `\" Jo, we're set,\"` Dusty replied. `\"Goin' in?\"` \"We're goin' in,\" Jo confirmed. Bill looked at her. \"You ready?\" he asked. Jo nodded, undoing her seatbelt. \"I'm on it.\" \"Be careful,\" Bill advised, returning his attention to the road. Jo opened the back window of the truck and crawled through. Reaching Dorothy 4, Jo switched it on and crawled back inside. \"She's up,\" she announced, buckling herself back in. Bill nodded. \"Okay.\" And he drove into the nearby cornfield, heading for the twister in the distance. Dusty and the rest of the team were watching and monitoring the situation, and they were mildly alarmed when the red pickup disappeared into the cornfield. \"Where are they?\" Rabbit asked, watching the scene through a pair of binoculars. \"I can't see 'em!\" \"They're in the cornfield,\" Maxine reported from on top of the van, Elle was at her side, and they were both filming with their video cameras. \"Heading straight for the twister.\" \"Our first F5, beautiful,\" said Elle as she took pictures with a digital camera, looking forward to the artwork she was going to make later on. \"We're tracking 'em great,\" Haynes reported. \"The speed's still increasing.\" Beltzer shook his head, amazed. \"I've never seen anything like this.\" \"They're gonna punch the core,\" Dusty reported. Meanwhile, Jo and Bill were driving in the cornfield, right towards the tornado. \"You ready?\" Jo asked, hoping that it would work since this was their very last chance. \"Yeah,\" said Bill. \"Let me just set the cruise control.\" Which he did. \"Okay we're good.\" Jo unbuckled her seatbelt and grasped the door handle. \"On three?\" she asked, looking at him. Bill nodded, grasping the handle of his own door. \"On three. Go.\" They opened the doors and stood. \"Ready?\" \"Ready!\" Jo shouted. \"One…Two…Three!\" Bill shouted and they jumped out of the truck, rolled to the ground, and they got up. Holding hands, they watched as the truck continued toward the twister. \"Go. Go. Go!\" Jo shouted, her eyes fixed on the truck. \" GO! GOOOO! \" When the truck and Dorothy were being lifted up into the twister, the lid was ripped off, and the sensors flew up into the air, disappearing inside like twinkling and chiming fairies. Jo and Bill hugged and cheered loudly. \"Yes! YES! \" The team screamed and cheered as they saw both the pickup and Dorothy disappear into the tornado, along with the sensors. \"Dorothy's flying'!\" Dusty roared, jumping up and down. \"Baby, she's flying'!\" \"There's no place like home!\" Elle and Maxine cheered as they climbed down to the ground and joined the team as they gathered around the laptops, which were receiving the data from the sensors. \"We're going to be very popular!\" Joey predicted, planting a kiss on Elle's cheek and she agreed, flushing a little. Beltzer was looking at the Doppler radar and all the data that was coming in from the sensors. \"It's Christmas Time! Look at that!\" \"Look at these readings!\" Haynes exclaimed, and then they all suddenly grew quiet, realizing what the readings were showing them. Haynes looked back toward the tornado. \"You guys, it's about to shift northeast.\" \"Oh God,\" Maxine whispered fearfully. \"They don't have the truck anymore.\" Dusty immediately grabbed his radio and yelled into it. \" BILL, JO, YOU'VE GOT TO GET OUT OF THERE, YOU COPY?! \" Unfortunately, neither Jo or Bill had a radio, so they couldn't hear Dusty's warning, but they didn't have to since they easily saw that the twister was shifting direction, and it was heading directly toward them! \"Oh no!\" Bill moaned as the corn between them and the tornado was being sucked into it. \" RUN! \" They broke off into a mad dash through the cornfield. It wasn't long before they spotted a farm with a barn. \"The barn, common'! Look out!\" Bill yelled and soon they were running alongside a picket fence, where the horses were fleeing as far away from the twister as possible. All the boards were plucked up one by one right behind them. Suddenly, Jo spotted an opening in the fence to crawl through. \"BILL, HERE, HERE!\" \"COME ON, HURRY!\" Bill yelled as they climbed through. \" TO THE BARN! \" They run to the barn and, after Jo kicked the doors in, got inside, just as fence boards slammed and stuck in the barn walls. Once they were inside, they duck and saw that there were sickles, knives, and saws hanging from the ceiling. Bill duck down, avoiding the blades. \"Stay down!\" \"My God, who are these people?!\" Jo gasped, staring at the sharp blades hanging above them. Bill shook his head, for there was no way they were going to stay in there. \"I don't think so! Common'! Let's get out quick!\" They ran out of the barn, and then ducked as the roof of the barn flew over their heads. \"Oh my God! Common''! Run for it!\" As they ran, they yelled to each other but most of it couldn't be heard over the wind. They continued running until they reached the pump-house. Bill yanked on the door, but it wouldn't open. \" COME ON! \" He finally opened it. \" JO, GET IN! \" He grabbed her hand when she was almost blown away, and they both dove inside. Once inside and the door was locked, they saw that the well was a \"U\" shaped pipe coming up out of the ground. Bill tested the pipe and found that it was sturdy. \"Here! These pipes go down at least 30 feet,\" he estimated. \"We anchor to 'em, we might have a chance!\" Looking around, Jo grabbed several rawhide straps off the wall. \"Bill!\" She handed them to him, but they broke. \"No good,\" Bill grumbled, and then he found one that was strong enough. \"This one! Common', get in!\" He grabbed it, tied it first around them, and then he looped it on to the pipes. \"Hold on!\" Suddenly the walls and roof were lifted away and only Jo, Bill, and the pipes remained. \" HANG ON! \" The tornado loomed overhead, Jo and Bill were lifted up in the air, however still attached to the pipes. They looked up and saw that they were looking at the inside of the tornado! Jo was awe struck as they stared up at a light at the top of the twister. Lightning circled around the light until the clouds, the lightning, and the twister blew away. Minutes later, a family came up out of a storm cellar, and they were looking around as their horses galloped away. Groaning, Jo and Bill were lying under the pipes, still strapped to them, and they both sat up after a few seconds, freeing themselves of the leather strap, being sprayed by water coming out of the pump. \"You all right?\" Jo asked. Bill nodded and noticed something that made him smile. \"Wow, look at that,\" he remarked. \"It didn't take the house.\" And sure enough, the three-story house was still intact, minus a few shingles from the roof. In the distance, their team was driving toward them, following both the road and the path of destruction left behind by the tornado. Jo was smiling for an entire different reason. \"We did it.\" \"Yeah, we did,\" Bill agreed, pleased with their success, and on the fourth try after they got the bugs worked out of the system. \"Dorothy really flew.\" \"It was a good idea,\" Jo complimented. Bill flushed and duck his head. \"Yeah, well I…\" \"We've got so much to do,\" Jo realized, already imagining all the data that they were going to have to go through thanks to the sensors. Bill nodded. \"Yeah.\" Jo's mind was going fifty miles an hour as she processed all the work that was waiting for them, and what the future would bring. \"I've got to get grant approvals for a new warning system,\" she said quickly, \"we need a bigger lab, you've got to do an analysis of all that data…\" \"I do?\" Bill asked skeptically. Jo nodded. \"Yeah, we've got to generate models out of all this data, and I need to run the lab-\" \"Oh, no, no, no,\" Bill interrupted, grinning. \"You're doing the analysis, I'm running the lab.\" \"You're running the lab?\" Jo scoffed, grinning, too. \"I don't think so!\" \"I'm running the lab!\" Bill insisted and then laughed. \"G- Do you always have to do things the hard way?\" Just then, their team came running up after parking their vehicles, and they were all excited by the success of Dorothy and relieved to see that the couple was alive after riding out an F5 tornado of all things. \"You got it guys, the sensors worked!\" Haynes announced, bursting with excitement. \"The computers went crazy, we've got data coming out of our ears!\" And they all laughed. \"Biggest twister ever recorded!\" Beltzer exclaimed since it was, even for an F5. Dusty was jumping around, unable to stay put for more then a few seconds. \"Awesome, man!\" \"Hey, Jo, Bill, check out that sky!\" said Sanders, pointing to the sky, which was clear for the first time in days. \"You know what,\" Jo said, \"I think we've seen enough.\" And then she and Bill kissed. The team cheered and laughed, for they knew that there was no way now that Jo and Bill were going to go through with the divorce, and they all danced around, laughing at their success while Mose barked happily as a rainbow formed high above them. A/N: And that's a wrap! So, I'm not sure of what I'll be posting next week, but I'll post something. R&R; everyone! ","Summary":" Twister: Chasing the Storm A/N: Hi, guys. So I wrote this some time ago and decided to post it for "},{"Movie":"Twister","Title":"Twisted","Author":"fanwriter1245","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11476174","Passage":"[Chapter 1] My very first story where there are no pairings and focuses on a family. The trend won't last long. As Kassidy rode in the back of her dad's truck with him and his fiancée, Melissa, she just wished that the entire situation she had been forced into was completely different. Kassidy was angry with both of parents and had been ever since they decided to split up when she was in middle school. Now seventeen years old, she was still angry with both of them. Her father for taking her with him when he knew she wanted to stay with her mom, and her mother for not doing something about it. \"Um, honey, are you sure she's gonna be here?\" Melissa asked Bill. \"If I know Jo, she's already dragged her entire department into the field. A day like today, it's to be expected. She forgets everything except her work.\" \"You're nervous about seeing her, aren't you?\" \"Nervous? No. Why, do I look nervous?\" \"No. Well, yeah you do, a little.\" \"I just want to get it over with.\" You and me both , Kassidy thought with disdain. \"But she said she signed the papers, right?\" Melissa asked. \"That's what she said.\" \"You don't think so?\" \"No, I think so. Give me a kiss.\" He leaned over and kissed Melissa tenderly. Kassidy wanted to vomit. It's not that she hated Melissa, she just hated the fact that she was engaged to her father. Only one person belonged with him, and it certainly wasn't her. \"Kassidy, you're awful quiet back there,\" Bill threw back to his daughter. Like you care , Kassidy thought to herself. \"Because I don't have anything to say,\" she said instead. \"Excited to see Mom?\" \"Whatever.\" Bill passed off her shortness to typical teenage behavior, but he had no idea just what kind of feelings she was harboring inside. They pulled up, and Kassidy did feel a bit of nostalgia as she saw the old team together. \"What do you know? Storm chasers,\" Bill said with a hint of sarcasm in his words. He got out of the truck and everyone got really excited seeing their friend. Dusty, one of her favorites, came over and hugged him. Kassidy climbed out of the back and stood by the truck. \"I don't believe it!\" Dusty exclaimed. \"Kassie?!\" \"Hey, Dusty,\" Kassidy said with a small laugh as the man came over and hugged her tightly. \"You've gotten so big! And your hair's gotten so darn long!\" Kassidy tossed some of her golden tresses over her shoulder. \"Time flies!\" Melissa walked over to them with a shy smile. \"Dusty, I'd like you to meet Melissa,\" Bill introduced. \"Melissa, this is Dusty. Dustman's been chasing with us ever since we started. Listen, man, where's Jo?\" \"She's over by the Doppler,\" Dusty pointed. \"Broke down again, running out of grant money.\" \"Honey, why don't you hang out here for a little while, I'll—I'll be right back.\" \"Okay,\" Melissa answered. \"Dusty, why don't you and Kassidy explain to Melissa…why you are the way you are?\" Dusty took Melissa's hand and went over to the chairs. \"Come on. Man. Jo's gonna wig when she sees he's back.\" Dusty took a seat and Melissa awkwardly sat in the chair next to him. \"So, Kassie, I wanna know everything!\" Dusty said excitedly. \"What have you been up to?\" \"Not much. I'm heading off to college this coming school year.\" \"Any idea what you wanna major in?\" \"I've got some plans, but nothing's set in stone yet.\" \"That's awesome! We've really missed you around here.\" \"I've missed being here,\" Kassidy said softly as she took a look around her. What she wouldn't give to have been able to stay with her mother and help all these guys chase storms. Dusty looked at her sadly and decided to change the subject. He began talking to Melissa about the tornados and what they studied and everything. Melissa was looking at him very unhappily, as if this was the worst situation she had ever been forced into in her whole life. While he did that, all of the other members of the team came over to Kassidy and hugged her, glad they could see her for the first time in years. She still remembered all of them and most of them looked the same. Rabbit, Laurence, Joey, Sanders, Beltzer, Haynes, and Preacher. Most kids grew up with other kids, she grew up with storm chasers. Eventually, the team went back to their jobs. That was when Jo walked over. \"Kassidy,\" she said to her daughter. \"Mom.\" Dusty and Melissa looked between the two women awkwardly as the tension in the group became very, very thick. \"Uh, hi,\" Jo said looking over at Melissa. \"I'm Jo Harding.\" Melissa stood up to shake her hand. \"Oh, hello, nice to meet you.\" \"Bill just told me the happy news.\" \"Which?\" \"Us, marriage,\" Bill said. Kassidy smiled a bit. It was every man's worst nightmare when past wife and current girlfriend met. \"Jo, Melissa,\" Bill introduced. \"It's happy news,\" Jo smiled. Kassidy knew that smile right off the bat as a fake one. She used that smile nearly every day since the split. Was her mom still in love with her dad? \"I guess, uh, it probably seems kind of sudden,\" Melissa said to Jo. \"Seems sudden?\" Jo said in surprise. \"Dude, you taking the vows?\" Dusty asked with a smile. \"That's sweet!\" \"Well, we—we just wanted to get it done before Billy started his new job,\" Melissa continued. \"That's right!\" Jo said. \"That's right, I remember. Weatherman!\" \"What?\" Bill asked with annoyance in his tone. \"What?\" Jo asked innocently. \"Say it.\" \"I said weatherman, I think it's great.\" \"How come you had that tone?\" \"There was no tone if you have a problem being a weatherman.\" \"I don't have a problem being a weatherman.\" Kassidy rolled her eyes. Her parents just couldn't help but argue with each other, specifically her father. That was one thing she hadn't missed: all the bickering. Melissa's phone rang, so she fished through her purse and answered it. \"Dr. Melissa Reeves here. Uh-huh.\" \"Just wanted to say hello,\" Jo whispered before shaking her hand again. \"Very nice to meet you.\" She turned to her daughter and put her arm around her shoulders. \"Kass, come here.\" The two women walked away from the couple. \"How's life with Dad been, kiddo?\" Jo asked. Kassidy shrugged her shoulders. \"Fine, I guess.\" \"Just fine?\" \"Isn't that what you want to hear? That your daughter's happy?\" \"Of course that's what I want to hear. But I also don't want you to lie to me.\" Kassidy was about to say more, but Bill walked over to them. \"New truck?\" Jo asked Bill, looking at his bright red vehicle. \"That's right,\" Bill answered. \"Boy, oh boy. New job, new truck, new wife. It's like a whole new you!\" \"Jo…\" \"This is very awkward.\" \"I know, tell me about it.\" \"I thought you'd be coming out here alone.\" \"I wasn't expecting on coming out here at all. You said you'd meet me—\" \"It's about Dorothy,\" Jo interrupted. \"Dorothy? What about her?\" \"She's here.\" \"Show me.\" Jo went over to her truck and unveiled her and Bill's creation from their time together. Kassidy knew it was basically a lifelong project for both of them, and despite it all, she was rather excited that they had finally gotten it up and going. \"I can't believe you did it,\" Bill said in awe. \"We built four of them,\" Jo told him. \"She work?\" Jo opened the truck bed to allow Bill to climb in and look at it for himself. He scoured every part of it, thrilled his idea had finally taken form. \"Thought you'd want to be here for her first time out,\" Jo smiled. \"It wouldn't be right if you weren't here.\" The rest of the team came over to where the three of them were. \"This is gonna be good!\" Joey laughed. \"How sweet is that?\" Dusty said to Melissa. \"Bill's concept, man. Boom! The Extreme. Man, it came from his brain.\" \"I had a hand in it,\" Bill said modestly. \"Wow, it is great,\" Melissa said. After a pause, she added, \"What is it?\" \"It's an instrument pack for studying tornadoes. First one in history.\" \"It's very exciting,\" Jo explained. \"Scientists have been studying tornadoes forever, but still, nobody knows how a tornado works. We have no idea what's going on inside because no one's ever been able to take scientific measurements from inside the funnel. That's what she's gonna do.\" \"How?\" Melissa asked. \"We put her up inside a tornado.\" Jo opened up the device and showed her what was inside. \"She opens up, and releases hundreds of these sensors that measure all parts of the tornado simultaneously.\" \"You see, Melissa, it's like this,\" Bill said to her. \"These sensors go up the funnel, and radio back information about the internal structure, wind velocities, flow, asymmetry. We could learn more in 30 seconds than we have in the past 30 years. Get a profile of a tornado for the first time.\" \"And what will that do?\" \"If we knew how a tornado really worked, we could design an advance warning system.\" \"Aren't there already tornado warnings?\" \"Well the—\" \"They're not good enough,\" Jo interrupted again. \"They're nowhere near good enough. Right now, it's three minutes. If we can get this new information, we can increase warning time to fifteen minutes.\" \"Give people a chance to get to safety,\" Bill added. \"At least that's what these guys are trying to do!\" The team started cheering as Jo and Bill hopped down from the truck. \"I can't believe you actually did it,\" Bill said to Jo. \"Well, we did it,\" Jo answered. \"How do you get it in the tornado?\" Melissa asked. \"Well, you got to get in front of the tornado and put it in the damage path,\" Bill answered. \"And then get out again before it picks you up too.\" \"It's the suck zone,\" Dusty said in her ear. \"Oh,\" Melissa said, looking like she wanted to get away from Dusty at any costs. \"Jo!\" Haynes called, running up to the group as she hung up the phone. \"We got major action! The NSSL says the caps are breaking, the tower's going up to 30 miles up the dryline!\"[Chapter 2] Jo looked up at the sky for a second, then turned back to her team members. \"All right, let's go!\" she ordered. The chasers began furiously packing up everything and getting into their vehicles to go find the latest storm and get Dorothy up and running. Jo looked at her daughter. \"You wanna come, Kassidy?\" Bill took Kassidy's arm. \"No, thanks,\" he answered for her. \"We gotta get back on the road.\" I can answer for myself, Dad! Kassidy wanted to scream. She forced herself to stay silent. \"Well, it was good to see you both again.\" \"Come on, Jo!\" one of the chasers called to their leader. \"I'm coming!\" she yelled back. \"Come on, Kassidy,\" Bill said as he wrapped his arm around Melissa. The three of them started heading back to Bill's truck. \"They can handle this,\" Bill said to his fiancée. \"They know what they're doing. I mean, well, this is what they do, they live for this.\" \"Are you sure you don't want to go along?\" Melissa asked. \"No. Oh, with them you mean?\" \"Well, yeah.\" \"No, they'll be fine.\" I want to , Kassidy thought to herself. But you never cared about what I thought. \"Did she sign the papers?\" \"Oh, shoot!\" Bill exclaimed, pulling out the divorce papers. \"She didn't?\" \"Come on, if we hurry we can still catch them!\" Kassidy smiled, happy that she would get to spend more time with her old friends for at least a little while longer. It was better than going back home. Anything was better than that. They all started running to the truck in order to keep up with the chasers. \"Hey, Bill!\" Rabbit yelled from the passenger side of his camper. \"Glad you're back!\" \"I'm not back!\" Bill insisted. They all got into the car and started speeding after the others. \"Once we catch up with them, you and Kassidy take the truck and head home,\" Bill told Melissa. \"I'll get the papers signed and see you tonight. Okay?\" \"No!\" Melissa smiled. \"You know what, honey, I find this kind of interesting. I'm gonna tag along! Besides, Kassidy deserves a little more time with her mother.\" Kassidy smirked in the backseat, but did not allow herself to be heard. Suddenly, a big black van pulled up next to them. \"Jonas,\" Bill murmured. Kassidy looked over and saw a man she loathed even more than her parents sitting in the passenger seat. She had met him back when she was in elementary school and right off the bat, she didn't like him. Especially since he kept hitting on her mother. \"Who is that, honey?\" Melissa asked. \"Jonas Miller. He's a nightcrawler. We all started out in the same lab, but Jonas went out and got himself some corporate sponsors. He's in it for the money, not the science. He's got a lot of high-tech gadgets, but he's got no instincts. And he doesn't have Dorothy.\" Bill grabbed the radio in the truck and switched to Jo's channel. \"Jo, come back!\" \"Hey there, you change your mind?\" Jo smiled. \"Yeah, what's Jonas doing here?\" \"I'm not sure. But I bet he's asking himself the same question about you.\" Another van pulled next to them and got too close to the truck, forcing Bill to go off the road. They bumped across several pipes, bouncing Kassidy all over the place. Due to some tire problems, Bill was forced to pull over with the rest of the team and stop at an auto repair shop to get it fixed. \"How long do you think it'll take to fix?\" Bill asked the repair man as he rolled a new tire out of the trunk. \"Oh, maybe 10 minutes, 15 tops,\" the man answered. \"Sounds good.\" Kassidy leaned against the truck when she looked over and saw Jonas and some of his guys with what appeared to be some news reporters around him. \"What drives me is the unknown,\" the jerk explained. \"What if we could predict a tornado's path? How many lives would be spared with the creation of an early warning system? And D.O.T. 3 is the answer! The first digital orthographic telemeter.\" Kassidy watched in anger as he pulled out a nearly exact replica of the machine Bill had designed. She really didn't like that man. \"And inside, she holds hundreds of these little sensors,\" he continued with this stolen idea. \"Which when released into the tornado, will transmit back data on wind speed, pressure, and dew point temperature.\" \"Bill?\" Jo called, looking over at him \"Why didn't you tell me?\" \"Dad…\" Kassidy said, knowing his temper was going to get him in trouble again. She tried to stop him, but he wrenched himself out of her grasp and stormed over to the group. He flipped Jonas's hat off and grabbed him by the collar, pushing up against his stolen machine. \"You stole my design!\" Bill yelled. \"What'd you think, I wasn't gonna find out about this? \" \"Hey, guys, can you get this loser off me?\" Jonas said as if Bill was a gnat. Jo's team along with Kassidy ran over and pried Bill off Jonas. \"What is the matter with you?\" Jonas demanded. \"You stole my design!\" Bill yelled again. \"What are you talking about?\" \"Dorothy! You took her, you no-good thief!\" Jonas smiled smugly. \"Oh, I get it. You want to take credit for my design. Is that it?\" \"You're a liar. She was our idea and you know it.\" \"Unrealized idea. Unrealized.\" Jo ran over to the group and got in between Bill and Jonas. \"Hey, hey, hey, hey! All my guys, get a grip on yourselves. We both know he'll never get that thing up in the air.\" \"Well let me enlighten you people!\" Jonas said, closing his machine. \"This baby has satellite com-link. We've got on-board pulse Doppler, we've got NEXRAD real time. Today, we're gonna make history. So stick around. 'Cause the days of sniffing the dirt are over.\" \"Better than what you sniff,\" Rabbit muttered. \"We'll see who gets their first, pal,\" Bill growled, watching the team walk off. Jonas turned around with a smug smile on his face. \"Oh, and by the way, I really enjoy your weather reports!\" Bill tried to go after him again, but the team held him back once more. Kassidy had to admit that she was now resisting the urge to punch that guy in the face herself. \"Come on, Kassie,\" Dusty said, leading her inside. Kassidy walked into the shop with the rest of the guys to get something to drink. She was leaning on the counter, listening with amusement to her mother tell off Jonas behind her, when Melissa came and sat down next to her. \"Two lemonades to go, please,\" she said to the waitress. \"Want anything, sweetie?\" the waitress asked Kassidy. \"Just an ice water, please,\" Kassidy answered. \"Nothing changes,\" Jo muttered as she came and stood between Kassidy and Melissa. \"Pardon me?\" Melissa said. \"He's gonna wait and see what Bill does.\" She turned to the waitress. \"Can I have a coffee to go, please?\" \"That man's waiting for Billy? Why?\" \"Because Jonas doesn't know his foot from his butt, and couldn't get that machine working with a dumb brain like his,\" Kassidy answered. Jo smiled a little at her daughter's response. She had taught her well. \"Bill can tell when a storm is coming from miles and miles away. It's like an instinct.\" \"So you're telling me Billy knows what a storm is thinking?\" Melissa asked. \"Something like that.\" She held out a pack of gum for her. \"Gum?\" Melissa shook her head. \"My Aunt Meg used to call him a human barometer.\" \"Well he never really told me about all this.\" \"If you have to pee you should do it now, 'cause there's not many places to stop once we get on the road.\" There was a few seconds of silence between them before Melissa asked, \"You're still in love with him, aren't you?\" The silence that followed gave them their answer. Kassidy was almost in disbelief. Her mom really did still love her dad? She always assumed the feeling was mutual. \"Check please,\" Jo said, trying to get off the subject. \"Not that I blame you. I just hope this isn't some desperate attempt to keep him in your life.\" Jo put some money on the counter with both of the receipts. \"We're together.\" She tossed Melissa an awkward smile and left the counter. Kassidy looked at Melissa. \"Please don't talk to my mother like that.\" Melissa eyed Kassidy a little. \"I thought you didn't even like her.\" \"No, I'm angry with her. There's a difference. And no matter what, she's still my mom, and you're about to replace her, so just show her a little decency, please.\" Kassidy left the counter. Melissa hadn't been awful until that moment right there. She could invade in her life, and she could steal Bill away, but she drew the line at her being rude to her mother when it was clear she already got the guy. Melissa headed back out, and it wasn't long until Kassidy followed. From the looks of it, the storm was starting up because everyone was once again packing up and driving off. \"Kassidy!\" Bill yelled to his daughter. \"Ride with Melissa! I gotta go with Jo!\" Kassidy groaned before running over to the truck and hopped into the passenger side. They drove off and Kassidy smiled as she heard Dusty's large camper belting out some rock song. She rolled down her window and listened to the various songs the chasers played in their vehicles. Kassidy stuck her head out the window and felt the wind rushing in her blonde hair. It was nice and exhilarating. Melissa's phone rang next to her and she fumbled with it while trying to keep a hand on the steering wheel. \"Dr. Melissa Reeves here.\" She looked over at Kassidy. \"Kassidy, will you roll up the window, please? I'm on an important phone call.\" Kassidy bit her cheek and pulled herself back into the truck as she was forced to listen to Melissa give some kind of freakish advice to one of her patients. She looked over towards the field and saw a tornado touch down onto the ground. Her stomach flipped a little in excitement. She loved storms, always had. And it had been a long time since she was able to be this close to one. She blamed Bill for that. Melissa finished her phone call and they both watched the tornado rip things apart before finally dissipating. They were just about to catch up the rest of the group when Jo's truck landed right in front of them. Melissa and Kassidy screamed as Melissa tried to avoid hitting the truck. Once she was out of harm's way, Kassidy just rolled her eyes as Melissa still sat there screaming and hyperventilating as she climbed out of Bill's truck. She herself climbed out and started laughing as the rest of the members came over to her to make sure she was okay. \"Are you kidding?\" she exclaimed. \"I'm more than okay! That was awesome!\" Bill ran up and hugged Melissa tightly. \"You alright?\" he said, taking a brief glance at Kassidy. \"Yeah, I'm fine,\" she answered. It was clear to her that he wasn't really listening, and was focused more on calming Melissa down. Both of her parents were filthy and she guessed they must've gotten caught right in the middle of that tornado. She wondered what that must've been like, but could only imagine the adrenaline rush. As she looked out at the sky, she thought back on all the times she wanted to help her mom and dad chase some storms, but they didn't allow her to come. Or more specifically, Bill didn't allow her to come. She turned at the sound of cars approaching and saw Jonas's crew driving up. None of them bothered to stop. \"Fashionably late again, Jonas?\" Dusty called to the black vans, following them as they drove. He dove into the car window. \"Fashionably late! Gimme a kiss, baby!\" He got shoved out of the car and yelled as the other vans passed, \"Loser! Loser! Move on!\" Kassidy smiled a little at her old friend's actions. He was always there to perk everyone up at the end of the day. She had missed him the most. \"Come on, guys, let's get Dorothy 2 ready!\" Haynes ordered. Jo started pulling things out of her destroyed truck. \"You got full coverage on that truck?\" she asked Bill. Bill smiled, knowing full well what she wanted. \"Liability only.\" \"Liability only?\" She grabbed some things then looked back at them. \"It's a very pretty truck.\" \"Thank you,\" Melissa smiled, oblivious to the request Jo was implying. Bill laughed nervously. \"Don't even think about it. No way.\"[Chapter 3] And that's when Kassidy found herself and Melissa in the back of Bill's truck chasing after another tornado. While she was loving every second of it, every moment she spent here only reminded her of what she had been missing because she hadn't been able to stay with her mother after the split. \"This is the caboose, this is the caboose! I'm waiting for orders, Boss!\" Dusty said over the radio. Both Jo and Bill made a grab for the radio to answer him and their hands awkwardly touched. They tried again, but the same thing happened. \"Go ahead,\" Bill said. \"It's your truck.\" \"No, really. You should.\" Jo picked up the radio mic. \"Dusty, the battle zone should be northeast of 81.\" \"Copy that, Jo,\" Dusty answered. \"Wait a minute, battle zone? Billy, what're we doing?\" Melissa asked. \"We're going again,\" Bill answered with a smile. \"Again? But back there, you almost got yourself killed!\" \"No, no, just a close call.\" \"You're gonna cross 15 on Oklahoma 412. 412,\" Rabbit said over the radio. \"Okay, copy that,\" Jo answered back. \"Haynes, what's on the mesonet?\" \"Winds continuing to back, VIL's are at, uh, 60,\" Haynes explained. \"Okay guys, let's go get it!\" Jo leaned over and looked at the speedometer to find they were only going 50. She slapped her hand to her forehead and groaned quietly. Bill shook his head with another smile and jammed the gas pedal. They kept driving and eventually pulled up next to Jonas's crew. \"There's your pal,\" Jo said. Bill and Jonas looked out their windows and gave each other fake smiles. The tornado had formed and could be seen right in front of them. Suddenly, Bill slammed on the brakes. \"What're you doing?\" Jo demanded. Bill looked out the windshield. \"Look at the updraft, the angle! It's gonna shift it's track!\" \"Are you sure?\" \"Oh yes. It's definitely a sidewinder! It'll move left.\" \"Is that bad?\" Melissa asked, but Bill held his hand up signaling he couldn't talk to her at the moment. \"Wasn't there a road back there?\" he asked Jo. \"You're right. Go, go, go, go!\" Bill put the truck in reverse and sped back to another road. As they drove down it, Melissa's phone rang again. \"Hello?\" she answered. \"Donald, now's not a very good time for me, okay? What…all right, put Julia on. Okay.\" Kassidy rolled her eyes again. Now was not the time for Melissa to be giving out advice. Her patients could wait. They were chasing a tornado, for heaven's sake. \"We're close,\" Bill said as it began to rain. Jo put on a headset. \"Rabbit, tell me what road we're on. Where does this take us?\" \"I know it feels unnatural,\" Melissa continued on the phone, \"but with Donald's motility, you're not gonna have this baby the old-fashioned way. Even if you stand on your head.\" Jo gave a questioning look to Bill. \"She's a…reproductive therapist,\" he told her almost as if embarrassed. \"Laurence?\" Jo said into the radio. \"Laurence come in, we've got to get ahead of this storm. What's on the satellite?\" Melissa looked up at what was ahead of her. \"I can't talk to you right now, I'll have to call you back,\" she said as she hung up. \"Twister south, skipping south, shifting to south, we have an F2, ladies and gentlemen, possibly F3,\" Laurence explained. \"You with me? It's a very, very large rope on the ground. Very large. Right on the ground.\" \"It looks like it's turning, it looks like it's turning,\" Joey's voice came across. \"The atmosphere is very unstable! Repeat, unstable!\" \"This is Rabbit, this is Rabbit, it's at 2:00, it's headed this way!\" \"This is Sanders, this is Sanders! We're driving due east on a country road we've been on for about 6 miles. We've got an F3, two sitting on the ground, and she's a beauty! WHOOHOO!\" \"Jo, it's Barn Burner, it's Barn Burner! It's not gonna hang out long. It's not hanging out long!\" \"We got it, we got it, we see it!\" Jo told them all. Kassidy's head started spinning as everyone fed Jo information at once. She admired her mother for keeping all of that straight. The sky was extremely dark and scary looking, especially for the middle of the afternoon. The rain started coming down even harder and lightning and thunder crashed all around them. \"We're getting slammed in here, guys. You better hang back,\" Bill told everyone through the radio. \"This thing loaded?\" Jo asked, referring to his camera. \"Yeah, go for it.\" Jo started taking pictures when she looked at the rain on the window. \"Rain bands.\" \"What?\" Melissa said, clueless to everything that was going on. \"Look at the surf coming off those fields.\" \"Horizontal rain,\" Bill said. \"Hang on!\" He floored it and they started driving towards a bridge over a lake. The tornado was sucking up the water and it looked unlike anything Kassidy had ever seen in her whole life. It was incredible! \"Bill, I've never seen it clouded like this,\" Jo remarked. \"I don't think anybody has.\" \"Bill…we're in the core.\" Suddenly, the twister on their left side split right in two! \"Okay, we've got sisters!\" Bill exclaimed. Melissa's phone rang again. \"Yes?! Julia, I can't talk to you right now!\" Her patients really didn't call at very good times… \"We're right under the flanking line,\" Jo said. \"I realize that.\" \"We can't attack this thing from the south, we're gonna get rolled!\" \"Watch me.\" \"Julia, I know you're upset, you just gotta breathe, we've both just gotta breathe!\" Melissa told her patient as she took some deep breaths herself. Kassidy's mouth dropped as she watched a cow fly past them. \"Cow,\" Jo said in shock. \"I gotta go, Julia, we got cows!\" Melissa said and Kassidy couldn't help but giggle at the thought of her patient's face on the other end of the line. She looked out and saw another cow fly past them in the other direction. \"Another cow,\" Jo said. \"Actually, I think that was the same one,\" Bill told her. \"We've got drunkards here, we've got no path!\" \"This is not good, get us out of here!\" \"I'm trying, okay?!\" \"Floor it!\" When Bill realized that he couldn't get out of the path of the three oncoming tornados, he slammed on the brakes. The tornadoes came closer and closer to them until they were right on the middle of it. The truck started circling around, and Melissa started screaming as Kassidy clung onto Jo's seat for dear life. Finally, all the tornadoes dissipated again and the passengers were silent for a few seconds. Then Bill and Jo took one look at each other and hopped out of the truck, hugging and laughing. Kassidy got out and joined them while Melissa looked rigid. Jo hugged her daughter excitedly as Bill looked over at Melissa. \"Oh, oh, honey!\" he said going over to her. Jo and Kassidy looked after them, then turned their heads as the rest of the team drove up. The two of them ran over to them. \"Did you see that?!\" Jo exclaimed. \"It was amazing!\" Kassidy added. The team got out of their vehicles and hugged the two women. Kassidy couldn't stop smiling. What a rush! She hadn't been so happy in a long time, and she wanted to see more. It was like a drug and she was now addicted after getting a little taste of it. Everyone went over to the truck where Dorothy was. \"I was thinking,\" Laurence stuttered, \"it may not be too bad of an idea if we just got out of here. 'Cause that was definitely too many tornadoes back there…\" \"Come on, don't be a spoil-sport!\" Kassidy said, playfully punching him on the arm. \"That's my girl!\" Jo smiled. \"She's right! Are you kidding? This thing's not over, we've only seen the start of it!\" \"Hey, you know what, uh, Jo, somebody couldn't help but notice how close we are to Wakita,\" Rabbit said. \"No!\" Jo said firmly. \"Yeah, and Aunt Meg wouldn't mind a pit stop, right?\" Sanders added. \"No!\" \"Red meat, we crave sustenance!\" Dusty told her. \"Guys, we are not invading my aunt!\" They all started chanting 'FOOD!' and Kassidy smiled up at her mother. \"Hey! We are absolutely not going!\" Just like Kassidy predicted, her mother caved in a matter of seconds.[Chapter 4] Kassidy grinned as she and the rest of the team pulled up at her Aunt Meg's house. She loved that woman more than anything else in the world. \"Billy!\" she exclaimed when she saw the driver of the truck. \"Meg!\" he called excitedly. He helped Melissa get out of the car. \"Come on, honey!\" Kassidy got out of the truck as well and looked at Meg. \"Kassidy, is that you?\" Kassidy ran over to her great-aunt and hugged her tightly. \"Hey, Aunt Meg!\" \"Oh, I haven't seen you in ages.\" \"Yeah, you can thank Dad on that one.\" As if on cue, Bill came up behind her and hugged Meg. \"Oh, it is so good to see you!\" she said as he hugged him. \"Good to see you too.\" \"Day before yesterday, I was telling Jo how much I miss you! You haven't seen any of my new work!\" She looked over at Jo and hugged and kissed her. \"Jo! Oh honey! Seen some action?\" \"You should have seen it,\" Jo said with a smile and a wink to Kassidy. Meg turned to the rest of the team. \"My boys!\" The rest of the members of the team all hugged Meg before heading inside for some of Meg's famous meals. \"Hey, Kass, why don't you help us in the kitchen?\" Jo asked. \"Sure, Mom.\" Jo, Kassidy, and Meg all went into the kitchen and started cooking up some beef, eggs, mashed potatoes and gravy. Melissa kind of awkwardly stood to the side. \"So be straight with me, hon,\" Jo said to her daughter as they cooked. \"What's really been going on with you?\" \"It's nothing really,\" Kassidy answered, trying to be careful about what she said with Melissa in the same vicinity. \"I don't believe you. Come on, I'm your mom. I know when you're lying.\" \"Well, I really miss all of this. You know, getting to hang out with these guys, chasing storms, the whole deal.\" \"Life with Dad isn't terrible though, is it?\" \"No, I just wish I had gotten to stay here with you.\" \"You wanted to stay with me?\" \"Of course. Everything is way more interesting and fun here. I've spent nearly every day since the split wishing I was back here.\" \"Why didn't you say something then?\" \"I did. To Dad. I guess he never passed the message. You really didn't know I wanted to stay with you?\" \"No, I thought you wanted to go with your dad.\" Kassidy furrowed her brow. So maybe she shouldn't be so mad at her mom when she didn't know that Kassidy wanted to be with her. Besides, she was probably too upset about Bill leaving in the first place that she was still too much in shock to do anything. Jo grabbed a tray of beef and led Melissa to the dining room. \"You guys, look out, make a space.\" The guys moved to make room for Melissa and she awkwardly sat down while Kassidy grabbed a seat next to Rabbit. Jo put a huge chunk of beef onto her plate for her. \"Geez, Meg, you've got a lot of beef,\" Rabbit remarked. \"Where'd you get all this beef?\" \"Did you see my cows out front?\" she asked him. \"No.\" Meg gasped playfully for him. \"You slaughter your own cows, Meg! Nice,\" Dusty laughed. He slapped a huge helping of mashed potatoes onto Melissa's plate. Jo then put some gravy out on the table. \"Better grab some while you can,\" she told Melissa. \"Meg's gravy is famous,\" Dusty said to her. \"It's practically a food group.\" \"Shower's free!\" Bill called as he came down the stairs, buttoning up his shirt. \"I'm next!\" Jo called. Bill came into the dining room and held a plate full of food up at Bill. \"Oh, I want that,\" he said longingly. Jo looked over at the TV where Jonas was being interviewed. \"How can you watch this garbage?\" \"Oh, pardon me, gentlemen. You guys gotta see this,\" Bill said, turning up the volume on the TV. Everyone, including Kassidy, began booing at the TV with the stuck-up jerk on the screen. They all watched him get interviewed, really milking it up. Kassidy really hated him. \"Oh, turn him off!\" Haynes yelled. \"Aw, shut up!\" Rabbit added. \"Turn him off.\" \"He really is in love with himself,\" Jo said. \"I thought it was just a summer thing.\" \"He's gonna rue the day,\" Dusty remarked. \"Dude, he's gonna rue the day he came against The Extreme, baby. I'm talking imminent 'rueage'. Imminent 'rueage'.\" Melissa looked at Dusty as Bill and Kassidy sat down at the table with a plate full of food. \"I was just wondering why do you call Billy 'The Extreme'?\" \"'Cause Billy is the extreme.\" \"Bill is the most out-of-control guy in the game!\" Preacher said, coming over to the table. Bill looked over at Jo. \"No, I think I came in second.\" \"Well, I've seen The Extreme in high gear,\" Dusty said. \"You guys need to get some new stories,\" Jo told them. \"I'm gonna go clean up.\" She headed upstairs to go shower. \"So we get this one near Dalton,\" Dusty began. \"We're way too close, and Jo's got the vid on it, she's filming it, right. And all the sudden, out of nowhere, this awful-looking valiant comes pulling up, right in the way.\" Beltzer came up behind Melissa. \"She starts yelling. And this loser stumbles out of the car, he's got like, a bottle of Jack Daniels in his hand. He's naked.\" \"He's butt naked,\" Rabbit threw in. \" Not naked,\" Bill insisted. \"I was not naked!\" \"He was without apparel,\" Beltzer said. \"Half naked.\" \"Naked,\" Dusty finished. \"So, Jo is yelling at him to get out of the way, right. He just, he strolls up to the twister, and he says, 'Have a drink.' And he chucks the bottle into the twister, and it never hits the ground!\" \"Twister caught it, and sucked it right up,\" Preacher said. \"Honey, this is a tissue of lies,\" Bill said to Melissa. \"See there was another Bill, an evil Bill, and I killed him!\" Kassidy continued eating her food, but she was growing more and more upset as she listened to all of the chasers talk and laugh with each other, telling Melissa stories about Bill. Stories Kassidy didn't even know herself. \"No, that was a good size twister. What was that, an F3?\" Preacher said, going back to the events of today. \"Solid F2,\" Bill told him. \"See now you've lost me again,\" Melissa said. \"It's the Fujita scale. It measures the intensity of a tornado by how much it eats. \"Eats?\" \"Destroys.\" \"The little encounter we had back there was a strong F2, F3 maybe,\" Laurence told her. \"Bet we see some F4's today,\" Beltzer smiled. \"That'd be sweet!\" Haynes agreed. \"4 is good, 4 will re-locate your house fairly officially,\" Bill said, leaning back in his seat. \"Is there an F5?\" Melissa asked. The room grew very silent. \"What would that be like?\" \"The finger of God,\" Preacher said. \"None of you have ever seen an F5?\" \"Just one of us,\" Bill said, looking upstairs where Jo was. Kassidy knew that story just fine. The story of how her mother's dad was ripped away from her by a twister when she was only a little girl. \"Excuse me,\" Kassidy said, standing up. She headed outside to get some air, all of a sudden feeling very suffocated. \"Kassidy?\" She turned around to find her father walking up behind her, having followed her outside. \"What's wrong?\" \"Nothing,\" she said flatly. \"Come on, you can talk to me.\" Kassidy furiously turned to him. \"Oh, really?\" \"Kassidy, what's going on with you? I'm getting a little sick of your attitude.\" \" My attitude? Dad, do you hear what they're saying in there? They're calling you 'The Extreme' and talking about all these crazy things you did! Did it ever occur to you that maybe I wanted a piece of that? I've loved storms ever since I can remember. I mean, I'm a Harding. It's in my blood.\" \"I guess I never thought—\" \"You never thought about me and about what I wanted.\" \"Now, wait a second.\" \"No! I told you I wanted to stay with Mom! But you didn't listen to me and you took me with you. But you didn't really want me, you just wanted to prove your dominance.\" \"That's not true!\" Bill argued. \"Really?! I can't even remember the last time you did something for me. You've been spending all your time with Melissa!\" \"I thought you liked Melissa!\" \"You're missing the point! You haven't attended a single one of my academic competitions, you never came to any of my award ceremonies, and you missed me getting awarded a very prestigious scholarship for full tuition to my dream school!\" \"You…you won a scholarship?\" Bill asked, now realizing why Kassidy was so angry with him. \"Yes, and when I tried to tell you about it, you were talking with Melissa and didn't even listen to me at all. You know what, you never even asked me about how I felt about you two getting engaged!\" \"Yes, I did!\" \"No, you told me about it after you already proposed to her! Let's face it, Dad, ever since the split, you cared more about your stupid job and your new girlfriend than you ever cared about me!\" \"Kass…\" \"Don't call me that,\" Kassidy said firmly was she walked away from him. Bill was taken aback. He had never seen his daughter so angry before. And she had every right to be angry with him too. Looking back on everything, he realized she was completely right. He had been ignoring her ever since he walked out on Jo, even more so once he started dating Melissa. The fact he didn't even know she had won a scholarship for full tuition really said it all right there.[Chapter 5] They both headed back into the house and from the looks on everyone's faces, they had all heard the heated conversation that had just taken place. However, no one had time to address it because Dusty started screaming, \"We got one, baby! A mile outside Parlaine!\" Everyone hopped up from their seats, shoveling as much food as they could into their mouths, and took off outside. \"Kass!\" Jo called. \"Come on, you're riding with me.\" She and Kassidy took off outside as everyone scrambled about, yelling at the same time. \"Thanks for stopping by,\" Meg said as she hugged Jo and Kassidy. \"I'm sorry to eat and run,\" Jo apologized. \"It's what you live for. Oh, and Kassidy? Talk it out. Or it'll only get worse.\" Kassidy smiled sadly, knowing she was talking about her argument with father. \"I'll try.\" Bill ran past Meg and gave her a quick kiss on the cheek. \"Good to see you, Bill!\" Meg called. While Melissa hitched a ride with Dusty, Jo hopped into the driver's seat as Kassidy squeezed into the back and Bill ran into the passenger's side. It was more than awkward for father and daughter, but they didn't really have much of a choice. With that, they all went after the next storm. \"Rabbit?\" Jo said into the radio. \"Hang on!\" Rabbit's voice said back. \"Uh, let's go right through Wakita, we'll take Myers Road past the fire station, and we'll take 132 to 44 east.\" Bill grabbed the radio. \"Rabbit, do you know any shortcuts? Let us know, we need every second!\" Jo sped down the road, trying to catch the next tornado. \"Okay, Rabbit, time to impress me!\" Bill said. \"Okay, about a mile up, there's a little detour. We're gonna take a little walk in the woods!\" Jo kept driving as fast as she could, no matter what was in the road. Kassidy bounced all around in the back as she kept driving over a ton of bumps. \"Hey, it's bumpy here, folks!\" Bill said when Jo drove over an exceptionally large bump. He turned to Jo. \"Okay, let's get you wired.\" He began trying to hook up a headset on her, but he was getting really close to her and it was clear he felt very awkward which, despite it all, made Kassidy smile. \"Okay, you're on!\" he said once the headset was hooked up. \"See, kids? An ordinary person spends his life avoiding tense situations!\" Beltzer's voice came across the radio. \"Repo man spends his life getting into tense situations, Beltzer!\" Dusty screamed back. Kassidy smiled at her friend's craziness. How she missed getting to spend time with all of them. \"Okay, Rabbit, what have you got?\" Bill asked into the radio. \"Okay, Bill, turn left here toward that farm.\" \"You sure about that?\" \"Uh, yeah. Trust me. Rabbit is good, Rabbit is wise.\" All the people in the truck rolled their eyes and kept driving, but no one really liked the look of where they were. \"This is a field, Rabbit!\" Bill said losing patience. \"I know, keep going, beyond it, right through that brush! You see that brush right in front of you?\" \"Yeah, we see the brush, what's beyond that?\" \"Beyond what?\" \"Beyond what?!\" Jo and Kassidy yelled. \"The brush!\" Bill yelled. \"A brick wall, a bearded lady, what?\" \"Oh, um, it's the highway, it's the highway!\" By now, everyone was driving though a cornfield. \"Where's the road Rabbit?!\" Jo yelled through the radio. Suddenly, they finally got out of the cornfield and onto the highway…right into Jonas's team. Jo swerved to avoid hitting any of them and Kassidy let out a scream of surprise in the back as she clutched onto the seat in front of her. \"You're insane, Jo!\" Jonas yelled over the radio. \"What are you trying to do, get somebody killed?!\" \"Oh, really Jonas?\" Jo yelled back. \"It was so nice of you to stop back there and make sure we were all right!\" Bill pulled the radio away from her. \"It was very considerate of you! How could you see ten people on the side of the road and not stop?!\" \"Okay, okay, okay, okay,\" Bill said calmly. \"Keep the channel clear.\" \"Give me that thing,\" Kassidy said. She reached up between them and grabbed the radio. \"Listen, Jonas,\" she said, not playing around anymore. \"Get your head out of your butt and go back to being the burger mascot at Brad's Burgers!\" The silence that followed her words was deafening. Finally, Dusty said over the radio, \"Jonas, you were the dancing burger?\" There was no reply from Jonas. \"How'd you find that one out?\" Jo asked, smiling at her daughter's gutsy move. \"I did my research and made a couple of calls. I've been waiting to use that insult on him for years.\" Bill and Jo looked at each other. At least they were doing something right. Bill looked up at the sky. \"We're gonna have to get off of this road.\" \"What?\" Jo asked, not believing him. \"This is no time to guess—\" \"I'm not guessing. Just make a right turn. Trust me.\" \"Do you want to drive?\" \"Just turn!\" Jo sighed and took a right turn and the rest of the members followed her. \"We got a touchdown, touchdown, tornado is on the ground,\" Laurence announced over the radio. \"Where is it?\" Jo asked. \"Looks like it's coming down route 33!\" \"Jo, we're on 33!\" Bill told her. \"What's the path?\" \"It's going about 35 miles an hour,\" Laurence said. Everyone looked around them, but no tornado could be found. \"Direction, Rabbit!\" Jo demanded. \"North, northeast,\" Rabbit responded. \"Do you see it?\" Bill asked the girls. \"No,\" both Jo and Kassidy answered. \"Do you got anything up there?\" \"North, northeast, you copy?\" Rabbit said over the radio. \"Shoot, it's coming right at us.\" \"Actually, she's gone vertical, gone vertical,\" Laurence threw in. \"This sucker's really gaining strength.\" \"Do you see it?\" Jo asked, really losing patience. \"No,\" Bill said. He picked up the radio. \"Beltzer, we don't have a visual. Repeat, we do not have a visual! Help us out, here!\" \"Yeah, I got it, Billy,\" Beltzer answered. \"It's the best motion I've ever seen! It's like the base of this fatty is about half a mile wide.\" \"Rabbit?\" \"If you're going east on 7, it should be coming right over that hill in a matter of minutes!\" Rabbit explained. Bill searched up to the sky. \"It's gotta be there.\" \"Maybe it's stalled,\" Jo said. \"No, I think Rabbit's right. It's gonna show it's ugly face right over that hill. Jo, what do you think?\" Kassidy looked ahead of her and saw a dark and swirly pattern in the sky, indicating a tornado was near. It made her stomach flop, but she loved that feeling more than anything. \"You gonna go for it, Jo?\" Dusty asked over the radio. \"Time for deployment, guys, let's do it!\" They kept driving down the road while the rest of the team stopped to set up their equipment. Suddenly, pieces of ice began falling from the sky. \"Okay, we got hail,\" Bill remarked. \"Hail. We got hail,\" Jo told everyone through the radio. \"Upflow, Beltzer, we have upflow, copy?\" \"Yeah, Jo, I'm checking it, I'm checking it, she's almost up!\" Beltzer replied. \"Bill, right now, this is it.\" \"I'll get her ready,\" Bill said. He unbuckled his seatbelt and began climbing towards the truck bed. Kassidy moved over, and she didn't miss the look he gave her as he passed her on his way to the machine. He slid outside and started getting hammered by the hail as he attempted to get the machine ready. \"Are you okay?\" Jo shouted back to Bill. \"I'm alright, keep going!\" \"Mom…\" Kassidy whispered. They looked ahead of them to find a very large, dark tornado aimed straight for them. Suddenly, pieces of wood and tress rammed the windshield. \"Debris! We have debris!\" Jo said urgently into the radio. Sirens went off from the machine as Bill continued to get it up and running. The tornado in front of them touched down, then dissipated a little before touching down again. \"Dusty, are you set up?\" Jo asked. \"We're not leaving 'til we get this!\" \"Dad, how are you doing?\" Kassidy shouted through the window as he got hit with hail and debris. \"I'm alright! She's almost ready!\" \"Hold on! We're almost there, we're almost there!\" Jo called. Kassidy's mouth dropped as a fishing boat flew past the truck. \"Stop, this is fine!\" Bill screamed. \"Wait, we got to get closer, just a little closer!\" Kassidy jumped as a tricycle landed right on the windshield. \"Okay, that's close enough!\" Jo relented. \"Okay, hurry, get the tailgate!\" Bill said. \"Come on, Kassidy!\" Jo called to the backseat. Jo flung on her yellow raincoat and helped Kassidy out of the truck. The hail hit both of them painfully, but they tried to ignore that and keep going. \"You got it?!\" \"Yeah, she's all set, help me get her down!\" Bill answered. \"Hurry! Let's move!\" Kassidy watched as the tornado touched down again really close to them and a fiery explosion set off on the ground. \"Mom!\" she called. \"I don't think this is a good idea!\" \"Kassidy's right!\" Bill shouted. \"We gotta go now, come on!\" \"We can do this!\" Jo insisted. \"Come on!\" The tornado started sucking up the telephone wires right out from the ground. \"Mom, Dad, look!\" Kassidy shouted. They looked at the telephone poles, then at the one they were next to. It started shaking and then it sparked. \"Bill!\" Jo screamed. \"Get down, look out!\" Bill yelled as he grabbed the two women and got them away from the truck. Kassidy and Jo screamed as the pole fell right on top of the truck, making all the sensors spill all over the ground. They looked up at the sky and saw that the tornado was gone. \"Where'd it go? Where is it?\" Bill asked frantically. Kassidy continued looking up at the sky and saw the blackness swirling again. \"It's back, Bill!\" Jo said. She called out for everyone to hear, \"Beltzer, it's backbuilding! We've got to track it!\" \"Yeah, Jo, we know. Data's incomplete, I think you should get out of there, you copy?\" Beltzer's voice came back. Jo frantically began trying to pick up the sensors. \"Bill, Kassidy, help. Help me!\" \"Jo, we should leave!\" Bill told her. \"No, no, no, help me. Help me!\" \"Forget the sensors! We've got to get out of here now! It's gonna drop!\" He and Kassidy began pulling her back to the truck, but she furiously tried to get back to the sensors. \"Beltzer will see! If it drops, if it's anywhere near us, it will kill us!\" \"It's not gonna drop anywhere near us, it's gonna drop right on us!\" Bill pushed Jo and Kassidy into the truck before they got hurt. Kassidy gasped as her stomach flipped again as the tornado dropped back down right in front them. Bill began backing up to get away from the tornado which made Jo start freaking out, begging for him to go back. Jo jumped out of the truck and began trying to pick up the sensors again, but they had sprawled all over the place and it was a futile effort. But Jo didn't see it that way. \"Jo, the pack's wasted, it's over!\" Bill said as he and Kassidy got out of the truck. \"What's the matter with you?! We can still do this!\" \"Listen to yourself, you're obsessed!\" \"You've never seen what that thing can do, so don't even talk to me about—\" \"I just saw it—\" The two of them started screaming and pushing each other and Kassidy frowned as she remembered all of their fights right before the split. \"You've never seen it miss this house, and miss that house, and come after you!\" Jo said to Bill on the verge of tears. \"Jo, is that what you think it did?\" \"I don't know…\" She put her hands to her head and started walking away. \"Jo, why can't you just forget it?\" She turned back to him with a sad smile. \"You don't understand, okay? You'll never know.\" \"When's it gonna be enough, huh?! How close do you have to get—\" Furious she was still walking away, he grabbed her and roughly turned her around, forcing her to look at him. \"Talk to me! Jo, things go wrong, you can't explain it, you can't predict it! Killing yourself won't bring your dad back. I'm sorry he died, but it was a long time ago. You gotta move on. Stop living in the past and look at what you've got right in front of you!\" \"What are you saying?\" \"Me, Jo. Look, I've already really screwed things up with Kassidy, but I don't want to lose her just like I don't want to lose you!\" Kassidy froze. She hadn't seen her dad like this in a long time much less speak words like that. Deep down, he really cared about her and her mother. He just needed help to make those feelings resurface.[Chapter 6] The team all went to a motel to relax and come to terms with the events that had taken place. There was an outdoor theatre set up where The Shining was playing and Psycho was scheduled after that. Bill and Jo hadn't spoken since their outbursts, and now they were barely even looking at each other. But Kassidy knew. She saw that look in their eyes. They were still in love with each other. \"Hey, Kassidy.\" Kassidy turned to find Bill walking up to her with an awkward and uncomfortable expression on his face. Trying to heed Meg's words, she slowly walked up to her father. \"Look…\" he started. \"I've really messed up. A lot, and I'm so sorry. Nearly everything you said was right.\" He took a deep breath, picking his words carefully, not wishing to set off another fuse. \"I should've been there for you more. Look, Kass, I know you wanted to chase tornadoes with your mom and I. I didn't let you come because I was afraid you would get hurt. You were just so young and I didn't want to lose you. But you were wrong about why I took you with me. It wasn't because I wanted to prove anything to anyone. I didn't want to be without you. I know you wanted to stay with your mom, but I hoped that I could get you to see that life was better with me. Instead, I did just the opposite. I got so caught up with everything in my own life that I didn't see that I was losing the very person I wanted to keep.\" Kassidy looked at her father as he poured his heart out to her. She wished they had had this conversation long before now. Maybe then things wouldn't have been so bad with him. It was partially her own fault that she had allowed everything to build up inside her until she just exploded. \"Thanks, Dad. It means a lot to hear you say that.\" \"So does that mean we're okay?\" \"Yeah,\" Kassidy smiled. \"We're okay.\" Father and daughter hugged for the first time in years. A real hug. It felt nice to be in her father's embrace once more. She had longed for that feeling since her dad walked out on her mom. And now finally, she was granted that simple wish. Bill then walked over to where Jo was ordering coffees for everyone. Lightning lit up the sky followed by a crash of loud thunder. Something about the atmosphere just felt wrong to Kassidy. She looked up at the sky, trying to figure out what was going on. By the looks of her parents studying the sky intently, they thought something was off too. She looked in the direction they were staring at and she felt her stomach drop to the ground, and not in a good way this time. An absolutely colossal tornado was headed right for them. \"JO! BILL!\" Dusty screamed, running up to them. \"It's coming! It's headed right for us!\" \"It's already here,\" Bill said. He looked around and screamed at the top of his lungs, \"EVERYBODY UNDERGROUND NOW!\" Everyone started scrambling inside a warehouse to take cover from the oncoming destruction. \"BILLY!\" Melissa screamed. Bill ran over to her and they both ran and followed the others. Kassidy looked at her mother, transfixed by the sight of the monstrous natural disaster. She had to admit that it was absolutely fascinating, but if they stayed out here, they would get killed. \"Mom!\" Kassidy yelled over the wind. \"We gotta get out of here!\" Jo turned and banged on the glass concession stand. \"Get underground!\" she ordered. \"Take cover right now! Let's go!\" Jo ran over to her daughter and grasped her hand before running to the warehouse. The large sliding doors were closed, but there was still a small side door they could get into. Kassidy and Jo kept running, but stopped when they passed a truck. When she looked inside, she found Laurence huddled under the steering wheel. \"Come on, take my hand,\" she said firmly. \"I can't,\" Laurence stuttered. \"Take my hand!\" Laurence got out of the truck and the three of them ran inside the warehouse and clambered down into a small pit that would hopefully keep them all protected. \"Everybody down in the pit!\" Bill screamed over the thunderous wind. \"Get down! Let's go, everybody down! Jo, Kass, move, come on!\" Everyone stood in the pit, listening to the tornado get closer and closer. Suddenly, the windows smashed and glass flung towards the group. They all crouched down onto the ground to protect themselves from further debris that flung their way. A lot of people began screaming as the very pieces that made up the roof of the place were torn off. A hose began flying around that was spraying water everywhere. Preacher grabbed it and held it up triumphantly. His victory was short-lived when a hubcap came flying through the building and sliced his head. Jo crawled over to him and placed her hand on the cut to stop the bleeding. \"It's okay! It's okay! You're okay!\" Melissa was screaming things, but Kassidy was too focused on staying alive to really understand her. A car rammed through the ceiling followed by another and one threatened to fall into the pit. Kassidy felt a sharp pain on her head that made her see stars for a couple seconds and assumed that something must've hit her, but she couldn't tell what it was. It didn't take long for her to feel a trickle of hot blood slowly making its way down her face. Her father let go of a sobbing Melissa and went over to Kassidy. Like Jo, he noticed her injury and put his hand to her head so she didn't bleed too much. Kassidy realized then that he had spoken the truth. He really did care for her and wanted to protect her. Ever so slowly, the harsh wind finally began to die down. Once they were sure the coast was clear, everyone left the pit and looked at the massive amount of damage the tornado had caused. The whole place was trashed. Bill was still holding his hand to Kassidy's head when they heard Jo ask Dusty, \"Can you tell which way it's headed?\" \"It's backing northeast. It's um…\" He looked up at them with a grave expression on his face. \"It looks to hit Wakita head on.\" Everyone froze for a second before they all quickly climbed into the camper and started to prepare to get going. \"Come on,\" Bill said to Kassidy. \"We'll fix your head on the way there. I'll drive!\" He helped her into the vehicle and then went over to Melissa. \"Hey, honey, it's Meg. I gotta go.\" She turned to him with a stoic expression on her face. \"I'm going back.\" \"Good, good, you'll be safe at the motel. I'll see you in the morning.\" He started to leave, but stopped when he heard her next words. \"I won't be there.\" \"What? Why? What are you saying?\" \"I'm saying goodbye.\" \"No…\" \"You know, I can't compete with this. I don't even know where to start!\" \"Wait, don't do this now, please. Please!\" \"Sooner or later it would have ended, we both know that.\" \"Please…\" \"The funny thing is, I'm not that upset. What does that mean?\" \"We can do it!\" Rabbit yelled from the camper. \"Come on, let's move!\" Bill turned back to Melissa. \"I never meant for any of this to happen.\" \"I know, Billy, I know. It's okay. Look, to be honest, I don't think Kassidy was ever ready for someone to replace her mother. But I guess I was just so smitten with you that I didn't think about it. Well, now it's time to start thinking about her. I don't want you to lose your daughter, and I certainly don't want to be the one to come between you two.\" \"Bill, come on!\" Dusty called. \"You go ahead. They both need you. I hope that Aunt Meg's okay.\" \"What about you?\" Bill asked. \"Oh, don't worry about me. I know my way home.\" She walked away and Bill wished he had more time to feel upset. But the truth was that she was right. They hadn't thought about Kassidy for their entire relationship and it was part of the reason he had lost his daughter. \"Bill, come on!\" Rabbit yelled to him. Bill took one last look at his now ex-fiancée and headed to the truck to make it to Wakita.[Chapter 7] In the back of the camper, Beltzer helped fix Kassidy's injury while Sanders bandaged up Preacher's head. \"Ow!\" Kassidy flinched as Beltzer touched her injury with some alcohol. \"Sorry,\" he murmured. \"It's okay. I know it's necessary.\" \"You're lucky you know. The damage could have been a lot more serious.\" Kassidy slowly nodded as he continued to clean up the cut. They made it to Wakita and looked around in horror at the completely trashed town. Houses were completely flat, debris was everywhere, and survivors of the storm hugged and comforted one another. Everyone climbed out of their vehicles when they arrived at Meg's house. It looked ready to collapse any second. The team stood outside with agonizing anticipation, waiting for some sign from Jo and Bill that everything was okay. The house dropped a little, forcing the team members to run over to the house. \"MEG!\" Dusty screamed. He started climbing up to the window. \"Meg! Bill!\" \"We're okay, we're coming out!\" Kassidy heard her mother call out. She breathed a sigh of relief. \"Get an ambulance over here!\" Bill yelled. \"Get an ambulance, Laurence, now! Go!\" Dusty ordered. Laurence ran over to the ambulance and two paramedics came over with a stretcher in tow. Kassidy, Rabbit, Dusty, Beltzer, and Joey all helped Meg climb out of the house and get off the roof and to the ground. \"How about some steak and eggs?\" Beltzer joked. Meg laughed. \"How nice of you all to come over!\" she joked back. Kassidy grimaced at the sight of all the blood coming from her head and on her chest. Everyone helped her lie down on the stretcher. \"Bill!\" Meg called up. \"Grab Mose for me! I think he's a little shaken up!\" Bill nodded. \"Don't worry I'll get him.\" He went back into the house and came back out carrying Meg's dog. Kassidy tightly gripped Meg's hand. \"I'm so glad you're okay,\" she said to her. \"It looks like you've gotten a little beaten up too.\" \"Don't worry about me. I'm tougher than I look.\" \"You get that from your parents.\" \"Is she okay?\" Jo asked the paramedic. \"We'll probably keep her overnight just to be safe,\" the man answered. \"Overnight? Forget it. I'm all right,\" Meg said. Kassidy couldn't help but smile at her great-aunt's attitude. \"You're going to the hospital,\" Jo told her. \"Okay, I'll go, but I'm gonna drive myself.\" \"Honey, your car is in a tree around the corner,\" Rabbit said to her. Meg groaned and fell back on the stretcher before the paramedics took her to the ambulance. As they wheeled her away, her house finally collapsed to the ground. Jo went to Meg in the ambulance while Bill came over to Kassidy. \"How's the head?\" \"I'll survive. See, Dad, I got hurt, but I'm okay.\" \"I know. You're my little girl, Kass. I'm just overprotective of you.\" \"Isn't that what got us into this mess in the first place?\" \"You know, your mom always wanted to bring you along when we were chasing storms. You've got the exact same fire and stubbornness that she does.\" \"I'll take that as a compliment.\" \"You've grown into a very strong and independent woman. I'm very, very proud of you.\" Kassidy smiled broadly at her father. She had wanted to hear those words from him for years. Before she could say anything, Bill noticed Jo was out of the ambulance, so they both walked over to her. \"You all right?\" Bill asked. \"I thought you'd go to the hospital with Meg.\" Jo continued staring at something. \"Mom? Are you okay?\" Kassidy said. \"What is it?\" Kassidy followed her mom's line of sight and got the exact same idea. \"I know how to make Dorothy fly,\" Jo told them. Bill saw what the two women were looking at. \"Of course. Of course!\" The three of them started marching back to the camper. \"All right, I need every aluminum can you can find!\" Jo ordered the crew. \"We need cutters and duct tape!\" Bill added. \"Haynes, Beltzer, I want to get the last Dorothys on the back of my truck, and I want everyone working on it!\" While everyone, including Kassidy, rode in the camper and fixed up the sensors by cutting up aluminum cans and tying them to the spheres, Jo and Bill rode ahead in the truck. Kassidy's mouth dropped when the biggest tornado yet came into view. It had to have at least a mile radius. That thing was even bigger than what they saw at the drive-in! \"Hey, Kassie,\" Dusty said to her as they worked on the sensors. \"Did you see what happened between your dad and Melissa?\" \"I saw them talking,\" Kassidy answered. \"Why?\" \"She broke up with him.\" Kassidy's widened eyes looked up at him. \"What?\" \"Yeah, I think she saw that Bill still loves Jo. Or something like that.\" Kassidy wasn't going to deny that she was kind of relieved. Melissa was great and all, but she really didn't want to deal with a step-mom. Especially when it just caused her dad to ignore her. \"Dusty, you ready for us?\" Jo asked over the radio. \"Yeah, yeah, we're good! We're good? We're good? Very good!\" The vehicles stopped where Bill's truck was pulled off as he and Jo got the next Dorothy ready. \"We get them done?\" Jo asked Dusty as he hopped out. \"I think so.\" The team members all loaded up the new and improved sensors into the two Dorothy machines. When the machines were filled and ready, Bill walked up to Kassidy. She was almost certain that he was going to tell her that she was going to ride in the camper with the others and have to stay away from the tornado. \"Kass, you're riding with us.\" Kassidy laughed in surprise and hugged her father tightly. He hugged her back, loving the sensation of his daughter happily in his arms. He hadn't realized how much he missed that. \"Great job, guys, just be ready to report,\" Beltzer said. \"Be careful, all right?\" \"Don't follow us close,\" Jo told them as she got into the truck. \"All right, you got it, boss!\" Joey said. \"We're back in business!\" Kassidy squeezed into the back of the truck and they all took off after the tornado. The sky got darker and darker the closer they got to it. \"Half a mile more?\" Jo asked. \"That sounds right,\" Bill answered. \"I figure we'll put it right in the middle of the road.\" \"Unless you think somebody will hit it.\" \"Nobody will be there.\" Bill quickly swerved to place the truck across the road, and all three of them raced out to get Dorothy ready. Kassidy helped her parents lift the machine from the back of the truck and place it on the ground. Jo turned it on and then closed the truck bed before they all ran and got back inside. \"Dusty, you in position?\" Jo said over the radio. \"Yeah, we're prime, ready for contact!\" Jo looked over at Bill with a smile. \"This is it.\" \"It's gonna work,\" Bill smiled back as they grabbed hands encouragingly. Kassidy watched from the backseat, elated that her parents were back to the good old days when they chased tornados together. \"Just another minute, Dusty!\" Jo yelled. \"We're ready for it!\" Bill stopped the truck for them to watch history unfold. \"Kassidy, come here!\" Jo said. She helped her daughter out of the truck, then got her video camera rolling. \"Come on, come on, take her!\" \"It's too light,\" Bill muttered. \"No, it's not!\" A tree fell from the tornado and threatened to tip the machine over, but it missed it by an inch. \"We're losing it!\" Bill yelled. \"No, we're not! She can still fly!\" Another tree fell, and this one made direct contact with Dorothy and caused it to fall over, sending the sensors all over the road. Jo sighed and closed her camera. \"Let's go!\" Bill yelled urgently. Jo frantically got Kassidy back into the truck, then Bill started to drive, but a tree rammed them and got under the wheels causing all of the passengers to nearly get whiplash. The car spun around before coming to a stop facing the giant tornado, unable to move because of the tree. \"Get us off this thing!\" Jo cried. \"Bill, kick it! BILL! Let's go! Right now! Hurry!\" Bill tried desperately to get off the tree as the tornado came closer and closer, but he just could not get the wheels off. \"What is that?\" Jo asked, eyes glued to the tornado. Bill stopped trying to floor it and looked at where she was staring. \"What is that?\" he echoed. \"Bill, hurry! Hurry! Hurry!\" A huge tank truck came from the tornado and headed straight for them. The tip of it knocked them loose from the tree and made them spin around again before it went back up into the air. Bill floored it again and they drove as fast as they could. But they couldn't escape when the tank truck fell down again in front of them and exploded. With no other choice, Bill drove right through it and came out on the other side. \"Jo, Bill, Kassie, you all right?\" Dusty cried over the radio. \"Can you guys hear me? You okay?\" \"We're okay,\" Jo answered. \"Jo, Bill, Kassie, did you see that explosion?\" Everyone looked at each other. \"We saw it.\" \"Kass, you okay back there?\" Bill asked. \"Are you kidding?\" she breathed. \"I'm great. This is the most fun I've had in years.\" \"This one, she's still moving northeast on 80, you copy?\" Rabbit's voice said. \"This is it,\" Bill said. \"Last one.\" \"Last time,\" Jo added. Kassidy took a deep breath. So much was riding on this last machine. If they couldn't get this one inside the tornado, they would be right back at Square One.[Chapter 8] \"They have to be there somewhere,\" Bill said, referring to Jonas's crew. \"They have position. They could make it.\" \"Not unless they anchored the pack,\" Jo told him. She grabbed the radio. \"Jonas? This is Jo. Can you hear me?\" \"Not now, Harding,\" Jonas answered shortly. \"Jonas, listen to me. The pack is too light. The twister will toss it before it reaches the core. You have to anchor it.\" \"Oh, sharing valuable information, Jo? I'll consider that, thank you. And you can tell your little daughter that it don't bother me one bit that everyone knows I used to work as a burger.\" Kassidy rolled her eyes. She knew for a fact he was lying. \"Jonas, listen to me! Don't be a—\" She was cut off as Bill grabbed the radio from her. \"What? Do you see them?\" \"Jonas, what's your position?\" Bill asked. \"Oh, howdy, Bill. We are heading northeast running parallel and about to pull ahead of it on the left, why?\" \"Hang back a minute, we've got a pretty good view from back here. She could shift her track, and if she does, she's gonna come right at you! Do you copy?\" There was a few more people speaking before he continued, \"Jonas, listen to me. This is not—\" \"Get off this frequency, Bill!\" Jonas interrupted. The three of them looked at the tornado again, which seemed to keep getting wider. \"She's shifting,\" Jo remarked. \"Jonas, I'm telling you…Eddie, I know you can hear me! Turn around now! Get out of there!\" The tornado began shifting and they watched in horror as a radio tower slammed through the windshield, no doubt killing at least one of them. Then the tornado whisked the car into the air. It whirled around for a bit, then crashed to the ground in an explosion of fire. Kassidy's heart nearly stopped. She didn't much like the guy, but that didn't mean she wanted him to die, especially not like that. Bill angrily threw down the radio and banged his hands on the wheel. \"We tried. There's nothing we could do.\" \"Yes there is.\" \"Bill, Jo, Kassidy, ground speed is increasing,\" Beltzer told them. \"Get ahead of it as fast as you can or she's gonna bury you!\" They kept driving when they heard a horrid crashing sound behind them. Looking back, they saw that the tornado was picking up tractors and trailers and then sending them right into their path. \"Debris! Dusty, we have debris!\" Jo yelled. \"Debris?!\" Bill cried. \"RIGHT! LEFT! RIGHT! LEFT!\" Bill swerved all over the road, trying to avoid the falling vehicles. \"What now?\" \"I have no idea.\" \"Bill, Jo, Kassie, you still with us?\" Dusty asked. Kassidy's mouth fell open when a house rolled right into their path. \"I think we're going IN!\" Bill screamed. Kassidy and Jo started screaming as they drove through the wall and several rooms before coming out on the other side. \"Maybe we should get off of this road,\" Bill commented. \"I think you may be right.\" \"Still okay, Kass?\" \"Loving every second!\" she called to him. \"That's my girl,\" Jo smiled. \"Jo, Bill, Kassie, you all right?\" Dusty asked. \"Yes,\" Jo said through the radio. \"You guys set up?\" \"Jo, we're set. Going in?\" \"We're going in.\" \"You ready?\" Bill asked her. \"I'm on it.\" \"Be careful.\" Kassidy moved over as Jo climbed into the back and opened up the window. She got Dorothy turned on and the sirens started going off again. Jo then crawled back inside and Kassidy moved to the middle again. \"She's up,\" Jo said. Bill started driving through a cornfield in order to have the truck run right to the tornado. \"You ready?\" Jo asked. \"Yeah. Let me just set the cruise control,\" Bill told her. \"Okay we're good.\" \"Kass? Go out through the window there and jump off the truck bed.\" \"You got it.\" \"On three?\" \"On three,\" Bill said. \"Go.\" Bill and Jo opened their doors and Kassidy climbed out the back while the truck still kept going forward. \"Ready?\" Bill called. \"Ready!\" Jo and Kassidy called back. \"One…two…three!\" All three of them jumped off the truck and rolled on the ground. After getting back up, they stood closely together as they watched the truck drive straight into the tornado. \"Go,\" Jo said, her voice full of hope. \"Go. Go! Go! GO!\" The sensors released from Dorothy and then the whole truck, machine and all, went up inside the tornado. Dorothy was flying. \"YES!\" all three of them exclaimed and hugged happily. \"YES!\" \"Oh no,\" Bill muttered. The tornado shifted and started coming straight for them. \"RUN!\" Jo firmly held Kassidy's hand and they all dashed through the cornfield. They ran as fast as they could, which ended up being difficult because of all the tall stalks. Finally, they broke through the field and saw a farm. \"The barn!\" Bill screamed. \"COME ON!\" The tornado started sweeping up the picket fence behind them as they ran for shelter. Jo noticed an opening in the fence, and they quickly climbed through it. \"TO THE BARN!\" Jo yelled. They raced towards the barn, and stumbled in after managing to get the door open. \"Stay down!\" Bill cried. They looked up and saw sickles, knives, and other sharp objects hanging from the ceiling. \"Oh my gosh, who are these people?\" Jo remarked. \"I don't think so!\" Bill yelled. \"Come on! Let's get out quick!\" Jo kicked the barn door open and they ran to try to find somewhere else they could be safe. The barn started getting sucked up as they ran away from it. Bill tightly held Kassidy's hand, continuing to run from all the damage. He made her duck when a piece of the barn flew over their heads. Then he pushed her and Jo to the ground when even more debris flew over them. They finally made it to a pumphouse and ran in, bolting the door behind them. \"Here!\" Bill screamed. \"These pipes go down at least 30 feet. We anchor to them, we might have a chance!\" \"Bill!\" Jo and Bill grabbed some rawhide straps off the wall and secured them to the pipes. Then he helped Jo and Kassidy into the loops and tightened them onto their waists before tying one to himself so that he was in between them. \"Hold on!\" he yelled. The roof of the small house was ripped away as the tornado was finally right on top of them. Bill clung onto the two women as they felt themselves lifted up into the air. All three of them grabbed onto the pipe and held on as tight as they could. Kassidy could never put into words what happened after that. She was right in the very center of a huge tornado. She could see the blue sky at the very top and it was by far the most exhilarating moment of her life. The storm dissipated and they were lowered back to the ground. The pipe had sprung a leak so the three of them were now drenched by the water. \"You both all right?\" Jo asked as they sat up. Kassidy took some deep breaths, trying to regain composure after such an experience. They laughed together as she watched her parents meet eyes and smiled at that look between them. The three of them undid the straps and freed themselves from the pipes. \"Wow, look at that. It didn't take the house,\" Bill noticed. In the distance, they heard Dusty's loud music playing as the rest of the team drove up. \"We did it,\" Jo smiled, still out of breath. \"Yeah, we did. All of us,\" he said looking over at Kassidy. \"Dorothy really flew.\" \"It was a good idea.\" \"Yeah. Well, I…\" \"We've got so much to do.\" \"Yeah.\" \"I've got to get grant approvals for a new warning system, we need a bigger lab, we have to get Kass off to college, you've got to do an analysis of all that data…\" \" I do?\" \"Yeah, we've got to generate models out of all this data, and I need to run the lab.\" \"Oh, no, no, no. You're doing the analysis, I'm running the lab.\" \"You're running the lab? I don't think so!\" Bill looked at her. \"Do you always have to do things the hard way?\" The rest of the team members walked over to them. \"You got it guys, the sensors worked!\" Haynes yelled triumphantly. \"The computers went crazy, we've got data coming out of our ears!\" \"Biggest twister ever recorded!\" Beltzer laughed. \"Hey, Jo, Bill, Kassidy, check out that sky!\" Sanders told them. \"You know what, I think we've seen enough,\" Jo said. She took Bill's head in her hands and tenderly kissed him. Kassidy smiled wide at her parents' reconciliation. She always knew they belonged together. She looked over at Dusty and made a victorious fist to which he laughed. Then she went over to them and got right in the middle as they all hugged tightly. Her family was back together.

Starring BILLnHARDING JOnHARDING NATALIEnHARDING ANDnTHE REST OF THE GANG Bill Harding drove his red Dodge Ramndown a dirt road. In the passenger seat was his fiancée, MelissanReeves. They had been dating for a while now that they were gettingnmarried; Bill needed to get the divorce papers from his ex-wife, JonHarding. Melissa said to Bill, \"Um, andnhoney. Are you sure she's gonna be here?\" Bill nodded andncontinued to drive. Finally, he answered her. \"If I know Jo, she's alreadyndragged her entire department into the field. Ah, hell, a day likentoday, it's to be expected. She forgets everything except her work.\" Melissa saw his anxious expression.nHe was seeing his soon-to-be ex wife and his daughter, Natalie, whonhe hasn't seen in years. She hasn't even met Natalie yet. \"You're nervous about seeing her,naren't you?\" Melissa stated. \"Nervous? No. Why, do I looknnervous?\" Bill asked. He was nervous. Who wouldn't be? His daughter wouldn't speak to him. Melissa started to shake her head butnthen she saw her fiancé's face. It was nervous. \"No. Well, yeahnyou do, a little.\" Then she changed the subject. \"Does Natalienknow about the engagement?\" Bill shrugged. \"I haven't talkednto her or Jo in a while. So, I'm guessing she doesn't.\" \"Jo said she signed the papers,nright?\" She asked. Bill didn't know. Last time he talked to Jo,nshe said she had. \"That's what she said.\" He toldnher. Wasn't she there when the conversation between him and Jo tooknplace? \"You don't think so?\" Melissanasked worriedly. The marriage ceremony was coming up and she didn'tnwant to reschedule the date once again. \"No,\" Bill smiled. \"I think so.nGive me a kiss\" Melissa leaned over and kissed the side of hisnmouth and Bill continued to drive. Natalie Jane Harding was an onlynchild but she loved it. Her mom, Jo Harding, chased twisters alongnwith her research/storm chasing team: Dusty, Rabbit, Beltzer, Haynes,nSanders, Laurence, Preacher, and Joey. She was now 17 years old and has beennout chasing storms with her mom since she was 12. Her dad, BillnHarding, had left when she had turned 11. Natalie had dirty blondenhair and blue-grey eyes. Like her father, she was stubborn and likenher mother, she loved science. Everyone called her NJ unless she wasnin trouble. As the sun shone, she laid in thenback of her blue truck. Her hair fell into her eyes, which werenclosed. Dusty had told her about the papers. It was sad that if shenwanted to know anything she had to go to Dusty or Rabbit. \"Oh, fuck! This thing is useless!\"nJo yelled suddenly which scared Natalie. Her eyes shot open and shensat up. She saw her mom on top of a van, messing around with anDoppler-Radar. \"Sorry, Jo.\" She heard Beltzernsay. Then it started moving. \"Wait, wait, wait. Beltzer!\" Shenbanged her foot on the roof. \"That's good. Give me a reading!\" Beltzer got of the van, grumbling.n\"Okay, boss lady, hold your horses.\" He went over to his lap-topnthat was connected to the radar. \"Which way do you want it, Jo?\" Jo, who was sitting on her feet,nstood up and looked at the sky. Then she told Beltzer, \"Looks likenthe dry line has stalled. Give me a sector scan west, northwest, looknat mid-levels for rotation and increase the PRF.\" Natalie rolled her eyes and went overnto Dusty. He was sitting in his van listening to 70's music andnwatching weather forecasts. Dusty, aka Dustin, was the dad innNatalie's life. But, he was more fun and way more awesome. Whenevernshe got detention, he covered for her. \"If I mistreat you girl,\" He wasnsinging. \"Sho' don't mean nonharm.....\" Then, he noticed Natalie. \"Oh, hey NJ.\" She gave ansmall wave. She usually visited everyone when she was bored. Next, she visited Rabbit andnLaurence. Rabbit was giving Laurence a lecture about how we're notnsupposed to fold the maps. But, roll the maps instead. Only Laurencenfolded them, although he denied it. Nothing seemed interesting so shenwalked over to her mom who was trying to get something that was undernher truck. When Natalie got over there, she put her hair in a bun,nreached under the truck, and pulled out her mom's pack of gum. \"Thanks kid.\" She smiled. Jonnever called her daughter Natalie; it was either, kid or NJ. But,nNatalie didn't mind. She was at home chasing tornados. Where thenlab was nature. Then she heard Rabbit yell, \"Hey,nI don't believe it! Who is that handsome devil?\" \"Gentlemen\" She heard anothernvoice say. It sounded familiar. \"The Extreme! IT'S THE EXTREME!!\"nDusty yelled. Natalie headed back over to her truck and laid in thenback again. She closed her eyes. Then she felt someone jump on thenback. \"NJ, where are the papers?\" Momnasked me. Behind her, was a man. He had dark brown hair andnblue-grey. Just like Natalie's. \"Glove department.\" She grumblednthen she stood up. Natalie walked over to her mom's yellow trucknand got the divorce papers from the glove department. She tossed themnat her mom, who caught them with no difficulty. \"Hey, Natalie.\" The man said.nThen, she recognized him. It was her dad, Bill. Of course, he wasnonly here for the divorce papers. Not for her or Jo. \"Hey Bill.\" Natalie said. Feelingnawkward, she looked over at her mom who was reading through the lastnpage of the pack of the papers. Natalie knew her mom avoided thatnpage from keeping the divorce final. Jo had by no means stoppednloving Bill, even though he stopped loving her. \"What are you doing?\" Bill askednher. Jo turned her head toward him and answered, \"Can I read itnfirst?\" Bill sighed once again. Whatnwas the rush , Natalienthought. Oh yea, henprobably didn't want to be here . \"No! It's the same as it was innDecember.\" Jo then responded lying. She had read every page a fewntimes over, some even out loud. \"I didn't read it in December.\" \"Christ,\" Bill sighed. \"Wouldnyou just sign it so we can get out of here? Please?\" Who were we?nOh yea, probably a girlfriend or something. \"We?\" Jo asked understanding.n\"She's here?\" \"Yes, she's here, she's over withnDusty. Now would you please sign the document?\" Jo took this as ansolution from getting out of signing the divorce papers. \"You left her with Dusty? What'snthe matter with you?\" Jo left the papers and started to walk overnto Dusty's van. Natalie gave her dad a confused look then shenwalked after her mom. Bill, after grabbing the papers, followed too. \"The suck zone- it's the point-nbasically at which the twister sucks you up, but it's not thatntechnical therefore obviously, but-\"Dusty was saying before he gotninterrupted by Jo. \"Hi.\" Jo said. \"I'm JonHarding.\" She held out her hand for the black-haired woman tonshake. \"Oh hello,\" She said, getting up. \"Nice to meet you.\"nThe woman shook her hand. \"Bill just told me the happy news.\"nJo said. Wait, Natalie looked at the woman's hand. It had annengagement ring on her ring finger. \"YOUR GETTING MARRIED?!?\" Shenyelled just as Bill walked over with the papers in hand. \"That.\" Jo said, hiding her hurt.n\"It's happy news.\" Natalie looked at her mom disbelievingly.nThe mom she knew would sometimes stay up all night crying that hernlife was pointless since her dad was dead and Bill left. \" I guess, uh, it probably seemsnkind of sudden.\" The woman said, fidgeting. Jo said, \"Seems sudden?\" \"Dude, you takin' the vows? That'snsweet!\" Dusty said. He had always avoided girls when they were sad,ndepressed, or angry. But, he knew that Jo had feelings for Bill. \"Well,nwe- we just wanted to get it done before Billy started his new job.\"nThe woman said. Billy ? Seriously ,nthought Natalie. \"That's right, that's right, right,nright, right. Weatherman!\" Bill then replied, offended, \"What?\"nThen Jo said innocently, \"What?\" Then they got into a smallnargument. It wasn't as big as it usually was but still… Then,nsomeone's phone rang. Natalie looked around and saw thenblack-haired woman answered her phone. \"Dr. Melissa Reeves here?nUh-huh?\" So,nher name was Melissa ,nthought Natalie. Natalie spotted a cherry red DodgenRam and walked over to it. She heard footsteps behind her. When shenturned around, Bill and Jo were behind her. \"New truck?\" Jo said. \"That'snright.\" Bill said. Natalie hated to be around them when theyntalked. It was always awkward. \"Boy oh boy. New job, new truck,nnew wife......It's like a whole new you\" Jo said sarcastically.nNatalie just walked away. It was very awkward being around them. Shenwent back to her truck, stepped in, and listened to music.[Chapter 2] Nataliengot out of her truck and walked over to where her parents, Melissa,nDusty, and Haynes were at, which was at Jo's truck, looking atnDORTHOY. Haynes walks away and is on the phone with someone.nExcitedly, she hangs up. \"Jo, we got majornaction! The NSSL says the caps are breaking, the tower's going up ton30 miles up the dryline!\" Haynes told Jo. Jo looks up at the sky,nshe pauses, then suddenly focuses, slamming the tailgate. \"Allnright, let's go!!\" Everyone starts packing their things, andnNatalie runs to her truck and makes sure that DORTHORY 6 is tight onnthe back. \"Dorothy 2 and 3nready!\" Beltzer says. \"Dorothy 4 ready!\" Haynes says. Everyonengets into their vehicles and they all waved, except Natalie and Jo;nwho honked the horn, as they passed Bill and Melissa. Natalie was in the backnof the line, behind Dusty. She didn't notice anyone behind her tillnshe saw a flash of red. That's when she looked back and saw Bill'sntruck following her. She says into the radio to Jo. \"Mom, why is hencoming?\" She asked. \"Who?\" Then Jo sawna red truck following her daughter's truck. \"I don't know.\"nNatalie sighed and continued to drive. \"Jo, I think we gotnfleas.\" Beltzer said into the radio to Jo. Natalie looked up thenline of cars passing her teams. It was Jonas Miller's team. \"Jo, come back!\"nBill's voice said. Natalie didn't know that Bill tapped ontontheir frequency till she heard him talk. \"Hey there, younchange your mind?\" Jo said. She had been glad Bill came along. But,nat the same time, not. He probably was only there for her to finalnthe divorce. \"Yeah, what's Jonasndoin' here?\" Bill said. Black Windstars pass the whole team.nNatalie had flipped them off while Dusty made kissy-faces. Jo responded to Bill,n\"I'm not sure. But I bet he's asking himself the same questionnabout you.\" That's when Natalie switched her radio off. She heardnnoises and looked back. Bill had swerved off the road. Because shenwasn't paying attention, she swerved off the road. Her tire wentnflat. Bill parked behind hernand got out. Melissa stepped out also, but kept by the truck. Natalienhad put her blonde hair into a bun and was trying to see if the tirenwas able to make it to the nearest station. \"Need a ride?\" Billnasked. She looked up startled. Sighing, she nodded and got her stuffnout of the truck. Bill followed the teamnto the repair station where he got his tire fixed and Natalienvanished with Dusty somewhere. When they appeared, she had a drinknand he was soaked. They all looked acrossnthe street where Jonas' team was parked. Jonas, himself, was beingninterviewed by TV reporters. Bill got mad when he saw the instrument.nIt was like his design of DORTHORY. \"What drives me isnthe unknown. What if we could predict a tornado's path? How manynlives would be spared with the creation of an early warning system?\"nHe pulls out a large weather instrument. \"And D.O.T. 3 is thenanswer! The first digital orthographic telemeter. And inside, shenholds hundreds of these little sensors.\" Holds one up \"Which whennreleased into the tornado, will transmit back data on wind speed,npressure, and dew point temperature.\" Bill got mad and triednto punch Jonas for stealing his design but lucky, for Jonas, he gotnheld back by Dusty and Beltzer. Jo ran over and steppednbetween her team and Jonas' team. \"Hey, hey, hey, hey! Guys,nguys. All my guys get a grip on yourselves.\" She was being smugnnow. \"We both know he'll never get that thing up in the air.\" \"Well let menenlighten you people! This baby has satellite COM link. We've gotnon-board pulse Doppler, we've got NEXRAD real time. Today, we'rengonna make history. So stick around.\" Jo lifts an eyebrowncontemptuously. \"Cuz' the days of sniffin' the dirt are over.\" Hensaid knowing that Bill sniffed dirt to help him with the tornados. \"Better than what younsniff.\" Rabbit injected in the conversation. Natalie rolled herneyes. Couldn't they behave like grown-ups? Apparently, not. \"We'll see who getsntheir first, pal.\" Bill said to Jonas. \"Oh, and by the way,nI really enjoy your weather reports!\" Jonas and his crew laugh.nBill tries to get at him again but Dusty and Bouncer hold him back. Natalie rolled her eyesnonce again and walked into the diner. A few minutes later Melissanwalked in and sat down at the counter beside Natalie, who ignorednher. \"I'm not trying tonreplace your mother, Natalie.\" Melissa said after a few minutes ofnsilence. Natalie just snorted. \"I'm almost 17nyears old, I'm not 7.\" When the waitress came about Natalienordered a Coke while Melissa ordered two lemonades for her and Bill.nJo soon walked in, but she got interrupted by Jonas. \"You know, Jo, Indon't know what the matter is with Bill. I mean, he's wacko, he'sncrazy!\" Jo pretends to be deeply concerned with what Jonas isntelling her, even though she could care less. \"You ought to keep anleash on him.\" \"He's not my problem,nhe's yours.\" Jo said to him. Natalie got her Cokenand walked out as soon as Jo sat down. Bill picked up a handful ofndirt and lets it fall to the ground. He didn't notice his daughternstand beside him. \"I hope you know whatnyou're doing.\" Natalie said, softly. Bill looked up at her. \"What do you mean?\"nBill asked his daughter. He knew that Jo trusted her, but he didn'tnknow how much. \"You file forndivorce. Disappear for a year or two then you come back remanding thenpapers. It sounds like you hesitated.\" \"Natalie. It's nonenof your business if I divorce your mother and marry Melissa!\" Hensaid, not releasing he always got into an argument, just like Jo,nwhen he talked to his daughter. \"Of course, it's mynbusiness! The court will place me with one of yawl two.\" Natalienyelled. \"It's always going to be my business Bill!\" Natalie walked away tonher mom's truck and Dusty came up to Bill. As soon as Melissa camenout with the lemonades Bill realized where to track the tornado. \"We gotta move out.nListen, follow us in the truck, but stay behind Dusty's van, you'llnbe safe back there. I gotta go with Jo. Okay, let's move out, people!nLet's go!\" Bill informed her. \"Natalie! Ride with Melissa!\" Natalie grumbled andnsat in the passenger seat of the shiny red truck. Melissa ran andndrove off, following Dusty's van. Natalie could tell that Jo andnBill were arguing. They always did. That's why Natalie didn'tntalk to her dad often. Melissa's cell phonenrings once again and she answers it. \"Dr. Melissa Reeves here? Oh,noh. Yes, Donald, you've caught me in my car!\" This Donaldnperson had problems , thought Natalie. \"Donald, this feelingnof inadequacy is normal for you, Julia doesn't resent you. We talkednabout this before. She did not marry your penis. Oh, okay, she didn'tnonly marry your penis.\" Natalie shook her head. Melissa had weirdnpatients. As they race along,nthey can see the tornado ahead. Cars passing the other way honk theirnhorns, letting others know the impending danger. The national weathernservice has issued a tornado warning in effect until 11:00 am, thenradio said. Natalie cut it off. She knew there was a tornado touchndown. Finally, she hung upnafter reassuring this Donald person that Julia loved him and not justnhis penis. Dang, I'd hate to be her sometimes, Natalie thought.nFirst, marrying Bill, then 2nd, she has patients whonprobably did trucks. \"What was thatnabout?\" Natalie asked Melissa. \"I'm a therapist.\"nExplains so much. \"Oh.\" Silent Pause.n\"My dad's?\" \"Do you think yourndad needs therapy?\" Melissa asked her. \"Probably.\" Shenmuttered. The rest of the car ride was silent. \"Oh. My. God.\"nMelissa said. Natalie looked up and faintly, saw something yellownfalling down from the sky. Then, she realized it was her mother'sntruck. It fell right in frontnof the truck and Melissa narrowly missed it, not wrecking the trucknin anyway. Everyone ran over to make sure they were alright. \"You just missed thentruck! Awesome! IT'S AWESOME!!!\" Dusty said. \"Melissa!\" Billnyelled. \"Oh God, Billy,nBILLY!!\" Overdramatic? Jo walks by and Natalienwalks over to the truck to grab her things. \"You okay?\" Jo askednher daughter. She nodded. \"Well, there's somengood news. It did fly.\" Dusty says talking to Jo as she breaks anwindow and pulls her stuff out of the totaled truck. \"What was itnlike?\" \"It was windy.\" Shensaid. \"Windy? That'snintense-\" Dusty said before Jo interrupted. \"All right, move it,nDusty!\" \"That's intense!nThat's intense!\" He replies holding his hands up. \"Hey, the auto club'snhere!\" Joey yelled as the familiar black Windstars passed them. Dusty runs up to thenvan and puts his upper body in the window. \"Fashionably late again,nJonas? Fashionably late! Gimmie kiss, baby!\" \"Loser! Loser!!!!\"nDusty shouted coming off of the van. \"Why don't you findnyour own twister, buddy!!\" Rabbit yells. \"Loser!!\" Dustynsays while acting like he's directing traffic.\" Move on!!\" Beltzernsaid, \"Let's go.\" Haynes walks over to DOROTHY 2. \"Don't worry,nI'll get 'em cleaned. Common' guys let's get DOROTHY 2 ready!\" \"Youngot full coverage on that truck?\" Jo says to Bill, who has his armsnaround Melissa. \"Liabilitynonly.\" Bill informs her. He really knows why Jo's asking whynMelissa isn't. Shenreplies, wiping her face with a towel \"Liability only?\" Then, shengives them a look that's a cross between \"Whatever that means\"nand \"That's a scary thought!\" \"It's a very pretty truck.\"nBill makes a nervous laugh; he knows what she's up to. She wants tonuse his truck for the chase. Jo looks at him as she throws all hernstuff in her backpack. \"Don'tneven think about it.\" She continues looking at him \"No way.\"[Chapter 3] Jo, Natalie, Bill, and Melissa driving in his truck with the nextnDOROTHY loaded up in the back. Melissa and Natalie are in the backnwhile Jo and Bill are in the passenger seat. For once, they weren'tnarguing, which amazed Natalie. \"This is the caboose, this is the caboose! I'm waiting for orders,nBoss!\" Dusty said. Both Jo and Bill grab for the radio mic. Theynhesitate, then both grab again. Natalie sighed. \"Just freaking choose who's going to grab it!\" She said. \"Go ahead.\" Bill said. \"It's your truck.\" Jo told him. Natalie sighed and rolled herneyes. \"No, really. You should.\" Finally, Jo picks up the radio mic andnstarts talking into it. \"Dusty, the battle zone should be northeastnof 81.\" \"Copy that, Jo.\" \"Wait a minute. Battle zone? Billy, what're we doing?\" Melissanasked. Bill was focused on driving and Jo was looking at the maps. \"It means, we're going out again.\" Natalie explained. \"Again? But back there you almost got yourself killed!\" Melissannearly shouted. \"It's in the job description of being a tornado chaser.\"nNatalie told her. \"And, anyways it was a close call.\" She sighednand looked out the window. \"You're gonna cross 15 on Oklahoma412. 412.\" Rabbit informs Jonover the radio. Jo starts talking to Haynes. They keep driving. Jondramatically leans over to see the speedometer. Goin' 50. She slapsnher forehead. That's too slow! Bill rolls his eyes and speeds up. Offnin the distance you could see another twister. Then over to Jonas'ngroup. Jo's group speeds up so that they're neck and neck. \"There's your pal.\" Jo said to Bill as they passed Jonas' van.nBill and Jonas glare at each other and keep driving. Suddenly, Billnslams on the breaks. \"What're you doin', what're you doin'?!\" Jo exclaims. \"Look at the updraft, the angle! It's gonna shift it's track!\"nBill said answering her question. \"Are you sure?\" Jo asked. \"Oh yes. It's defiantly a sidewinder! It'll move left.\" Jonrealized that Bill was correct. The tornado was going to shift itsntrack. \"Is that bad?\" Melissa asked. \"No.\" Natalie answered. \"Notnfor us anyways.\" \"Wasn't there a road back there?\" Bill asked. Jo, then, answered him, looking back. \"You're right, go, go, go,nGO, GO!!!!\" Bill turns the truck around, driving fast. Then turns right onto andifferent road and speeds ahead. Melissa's phone rings. \"Hello?! Donald, now's not a very good time for me, okay?nWhat...all right, put Julie on. Okay.\" The tornado starts to shiftnto the left, just like Bill predicted. Melissa responding to the phone call with \"Uh-huhs\" andn\"Yeahs\" while Jo listens in with Natalie. \"I know it feels unnatural but with Donald's motility, you're notngonna have this baby the old-fashioned way. Even if you stand on yournhead.\" Natalie peered over the seat and gave Bill a look, while Jo looked atnhim weirdly. Then, he explained, \"She's a, reproductive therapist.\" \"Laurence? Laurence come in, we've got to get ahead of this storm,nwhat's on the satellite?\" Jo asks Laurence into the radio. \"I can't talk to you right now; I'll have to call you back.\"nMelissa says, hanging up her cell phone. \"Twister south, skipping south, shifting to south, we have a, F2,nladies and gentlemen, possibly F3. You with me? It's a very, verynlarge rope on the ground. Very large. Right on the ground.\"nLaurence explained. \"It looks like its turning; it looks like its turning. Thenatmosphere is very unstable! Repeat, unstable!!\" Joey says into thenradio then Rabbit said, \"This is Rabbit, this is Rabbit, it's atn2:00, it's headed this way!!\" \"This is Sanders, this is Sanders!!! We're driving due east on ancountry road we've been on for about 6 miles. We've got an F3, 2,nsitting on the ground, and she's a beauty! WHOOHOO!!!!\" \"Jo, its Barn Burner, its Barn Burner! It's not gonna hang outnlong. It's not hanging out long!!\" Dusty said. \"We're getting slammed in here guys, you better hang back.\" Billnsays. The rest of the group slows down a bit, while Bill, Jo, andnMelissa drive on. They see the tornado. Jo grabs a camera. Jo is about to take a picture of the tornado, when she notices thenrain on the window. He floors the gas. They approach a bridge goingnover a large lake. The tornado is hanging over the lake, sucking upnwater. The four are racing it in Bill's truck. Suddenly, thentwister splits in half. Now there's two! \"Okay, we've got sisters!\" Bill announced. \"We're right under the flanking line.\" Said Jo. \"Julie, I know you're upset, you just gotta, breathe, we've bothnjust gotta breathe!\" Melissa says into her phone talking to Julie.nSuddenly, a cow flies past, in front of them. \"Cow.\" Jo and Natalie said at the same thing. \"Another cow.\" Jo says as the same cow flies by. \"Actually, I think that was the same one mom.\" Natalie said. \"We've got drunkards here, we've got no path!\" Bill said. He floors the gas, and then realizes that won't work; the truck can'tngo that fast, he slams on the breaks. The whole time they're allnscreaming. There are now three tornadoes, swirling around the trucknlike a carousel. \"HANG ON!!\" Bill shouts. The truck begins to slide and spin.n\"Honey, hang on!\" Melissa screams, Natalie and Jo grabs the roof of the car.nUnexpectedly, the twisters elevate back into the clouds and are gone.nFor a second, all look like in shock. Then Bill and Jo hop out of thentruck excited, leaving Melissa, still frozen with fear. Jo and Billnhug and laugh. Natalie climbs out and makes sure that was DOROTHYnundamaged. \"God! Was that incredible?!\" Jo screams. \"Did you see it? Itnwas incredible!\" Jo replies screaming back. Jo points up to thenclouds where the twisters disappeared. The team arrives in their trucks. Jo screams to the rest of her team,n\"Did you see that?!!\" Meanwhile, Bill was trying to calm downnMelissa. \"Relax, Melissa. It's just the start of it all.\"nNatalie said, smirking. \"Three times anlady!\" Beltzer says. Joeynsays, \"Did you see the inflow jets on these fatties?\" Jontells them the entire epic tale as she climbs up into the back ofntruck, by DOROTHY and Natalie. Jonscreams, \"Did you see? I was sitting in the middle of it!!!!!\" Laurencensays, \"I was thinking, it may not be too bad of an idea, if we justngot the hell out of here.'Cuz that was defiantly too many tornadoesnback there...... \" Jonreplied, \"Are you kidding? This thing's not over, we've only seennthe start of it! \" Rabbitnsays, \"Hey, you know what, uh, Jo, somebody couldn't help butnnotice how close we are to Wakita.\" \"No!\"nJo said. \"Come on mom!\"nNatalie says. \"Yeah, andnAunt Meg wouldn't mind a pit stop, right?\" Sanders says afternNatalie. \"Red meat, wencrave sustenance!\" Dusty says smiling. \"Guys, we arennot invading my aunt!\" Jo yells. \"FOOD!!!nFOOOOD!!!!\" Everyone but, Bill, Melissa, and Jo chants food overnand over again. \"HEY!!nWe are absolutely not going!\" Natalie smirked knowing that theynwould end up going to Wakita to visit Aunt Meg and get something toneat. It always happened. And most of the team was in need of anshower.[Chapter 4] Authors Note: The restnof the story is going to be in Natalie's P.O.V. The last threenchapters had to be edited a lot since I kept trying to write in 1stnperson instead of 3rd. Thank you LTJM and JenD16 fornreviewing for the last three chapters. I thank you very much!

If you have an idea, please let me know in a review or a message! Warning: Language ……………………………………………………………………………………………… \"BILLY!!!!\" AuntnMeg yelled as soon as we walked into her yard. \"MEG!!\" Billnreplied to Aunt Meg, leading Melissa behind him. She was stillnfreaked out by the triple twisters but I personally, like my mom,nthought it was awesome. Bill thought it was awesome too, but henseemed to care more about Melissa's sanity, if she still has anynleft. \"Day beforenyesterday, I was telling Jo,\" Meg says dramatically \"how much Inmiss you!\" Bill and Dusty laugh at this display \"You haven't seennany of my new work!\" Then she noticed me and mom. \"Jo! Oh honey!\"nShe kissed mom on the cheek then me on the forehead. \"Seen some action?\"nAunt Meg asks Jo, who replied honestly, \"You should have seen it.\" Everyone, but Melissa,ngot around to hugging Meg. Melissa was introduced to Meg then wenwalked into the kitchen for Meg's home-style cooking that we missednso much. Rabbit, aka Robert,nstarts talking between bites of food. \"No, in a severe lightningnstorm you want to grab your ankles and stick your butt up in thenair.\" Somehow, they got onto the topic of lighting. \"He's right, ifnyou're gonna get hit, it's the safest orifice.\" Haynes informs us. Then, Joey decides tonbe sarcastic. \"Yeah, I'd like to get hit by lightning once. Yanknow, see what its like.\" \"I'm with ya.\" Intold him. He held his hand up for a high five and I gave it to him.nThen, I pulled out my phone and started to text. \"Who are you texting,nNJ?\" Dusty asked me. I rolled my eyes. \"Melissa and Jen.\"nI answered then put my phone away and started to eat. \"Hey, this is realnlemonade. Hey, Meg, I'm movin' in here!!\" Laurence said after hentook a sip of the lemonade Meg made. \"You can bunk with mennow Laurie!\" I said. Laurie was my nickname for him. He stuck hisntongue out at me and I repeated the action. \"You guys look out,nmake a space. Look out, look out, look out.\" Mom plops a huge chunknof beef on Melissa's plate. Melissa looks at it, almost disgusted. \"It's good,nMelissa.\" I informed her. She still didn't eat it. Oh well, she'snmissing out on Meg's beef. \"God, Meg, you've gotna lot of beef. Where'd you get all this beef?\" Rabbit asks after hentook a bite of the beef. \"Did you see my cowsnout front?\" Meg asked. \" \"No.\" Rabbit saidnwhile chewing the beef. \"Ohhhh!\" Shenmakes a gasping face, everyone laughs, except for Melissa. \"Ohh. Cool.\" Rabbitnsaid looking down. When he looked up I smirked at him and he rollednhis eyes. \"You slaughter yournown cows,\" Dusty says impressed. \"Meg! Nice.\" Mom plops down anbowl of mashed potatoes and gravy. Dusty ends up puttingnfood on Melissa's plate that she doesn't eat and mom is waitingnfor Bill to get out of the shower. \"Oh, pardon mengentlemen. You guys gotta see this.\" Bill says as he walks to thenTV after his shower. He cranks up the volume on the TV. \"Well for me, it'snthe thrill of the hunt.\" Jonas says. \"Man vs. nature. Havingnbattle with the elements.\" \"So as a scientist,ncan you actually predict tornadoes now?\" The reporter on TV asks. \"Well, no, they arenvery, very unpredictable, as some of my more unfortunate colleaguesnfound out earlier today.\" Jonas says talking about our chasingnteam. \"Oh, turn him off.\"nI told Bill. But, he ignored me. Haynes said the same thing but henignored her also. Bill turns off TV andnsays, \"What a wiener\" \"He really is in lovenwith himself.\" Mom says. Then I said, \"Inthought it was just a summer thing.\" \"He's gonna rue thenday. Dude, he's gonna rue the day he came The Extreme, baby.\" Dustynsaid about my dad. \"I was just wonderin'nwhy you call Billy \"The Extreme?\" Melissa asked us. \"Cuz' Billy is thenextreme.\" Dusty said. \"Bill is the most out of control son of anbitch in the game!\" Preacher said after Dusty. \"No, I think I camenin second.\" Bill says looking at mom. She sighs and turns towardnthe stairs but calls back, \"You guys need to get some new stories.nI'm gonna go clean up.\" \"So we get this onennear Dalton-\" Dusty said but was interrupted when Bill said, 'Oh,nGod.' \"We're way too close,nand Jo got the bid on it, she's filmin' it, right. And all thensudden, out of nowhere, this shity looking valiant, comes pulling up,nright in the way.\" Dusty says telling Melissa. \"She starts yellin'.nAnd this loser, stumbles out of the car, he's got like, a bottle ofnJack Daniel's in his hand. He's naked-\" Beltzer says talking overnthe story. \"He's BUTT naked.\"nRabbit put in. \"Naked.\" SaysnBeltzer. \"NOT naked.\" Billnsaid. \"I was not naked! Honestly, you're telling this story innfront of Natalie?\" \"She's heard worsenman.\" Dusty said. I pushed myself away from the table and walkednoutside and sat on the porch step. {No One's P.O.V} \"He's withoutnapparel.\" Beltzer continues the story just like Natalie didn'tnleave the table. \"Half naked.\" Billnreasons but it doesn't work. \"Naked. So, Jo isnyelling at him to get out of the way, right.\" Dusty says. \"Henjust- He strolls up to the twister, and he says \"Have a drink.\"nAnd he chucks the bottle into the twister, and it never hits thenground!\" \"Twister caught it,nand sucked it right up.\" Preacher says. Melissa was looking weirdlynthe whole time at Bill. In her head, according to these people, Billnwas naked and he threw liquor into a twister. \"Honey, this is antissue of lies. See there was another Bill, an evil Bill-- and Inkilled him!\" Bill explains to Melissa. Everyone gets tontalking about the twister, except Melissa, an hour or two ago. \"No,nthat was a good size twister, what was that, an F3?\" Preacher says. \"Solid F2.\" Billnclaims. \"See now you've lostnme again.\" Melissa says to her fiancée. \"It's the Fujitanscale. It measures the intensity of a tornado by how much it \"eats\".\"nBill explains. \"Eats?\"nMelissa questions. Bill replied,n\"Destroys.\" \"The littlenencounter we had back there was a strong F2, F3 maybe.\" Laurencendecides. \"Bet we seensome F4's today.\" Beltzer says. \"That'd bensweet!\" Haynes says smiling at her boyfriend. \"4nis good, 4'll re-locate your house fairly officially.\" Bill says. \"Isnthere an F5?\" Melissa asks. Everyone becomes silent. \"What wouldnthat be like?\" \"The finger ofnGod.\" Preacher says. \"Nonenof you have ever seen an F5?\" Melissa asks. \"Only two ofnus.\" Everyone's eyes, but Melissa, dart upstairs to where Jo wasnshowering and outside where Natalie was. [Natalie'snP.O.V] \"WEnGOT ONE, BABY! F3!! A MILE OUTSIDE PARLAINE!!!!!\" I heard Dustynshouting from inside.[Chapter 5] \"You ride along withnDusty, okay, is that cool?\" Bill says to Melissa. I slip into thenback of his truck while mom gets in the drivers seat. Once Bill gets into thentruck, they all start driving, with the truck in the front. Mom picksnup the radio-talker and talks into it. \"Rabbit?\" \"Hang on!\" Then, henpulls out a road atlas. \"Uh, let's go right through Wakita, we'llntake Myers Road past the fire station, and we'll take 132 to 44neast.\" \"Rabbit, do you knownany shortcuts, let us know, we need every second!\" Bill said tonRabbit as I pulled my hair into a ponytail. My white t-shirt wasndirty and so were my old faded blue jeans. My converses were okay.n\"Okay, Rabbit, time to impress me!\" \"Okay, about a milenup there's a little detour we're gonna take, a little walk in thenwoods!\" Rabbit announces. I wonder where that man's mind is halfnthe time. They turn onto anwinding dirt road, through a thicket. As Jo's driving over a bump, hensays into radio, \"Hey, its bumpy here, folks.\" Then he turns tonmy mom. \"Okay, let's get you wired.\" He puts a wireless micnheadset on her, clipping the receiver on her shorts. \"Oh, excusenme,\" He says. I could tell mother-dearest was enjoying him beingnthat close. \"Okay, you're on!\" \"See, kids? Annordinary person spends his life avoiding tense situations!\" Beltzernsays into the radio making me laugh. \"Repo man spends hisnlife getting in to tense situations, BELTZER!!!!!!!WOOO!!\"nDusty replies. \"Okay, Rabbit, whatnhave you got?\" Bill asks. I could see his blue-grey eyes, just likenme; flicker around, just like I would do. Dusty told me that whennever mom looked at me, she thought of Bill's eyes. \"Okay, Bill, turnnleft here toward that farm.\" Rabbit says. \"You sure aboutnthat?\" Bill responds. \"Uh, yeah. Trust me.nRabbit is good, Rabbit is wise.\" Rabbit says making me chuckle. Thennickname Rabbit was picked up when I said he was a smart-ass. \"Christ....\" Billnmuttered then he said into the radio. \"This is a field, Rabbit!\" \"I know, keep going,nbeyond it, right through that brush!\" Bill didn't respond. \"Younsee that brush right in front of you.....\" \"Yeah, we see thenbrush, what's beyond that?\" Bill asked. I sighed. \"Beyond what?\"nRabbit asked. I knew there was a smile on his face. Annoyed, Ingrabbed the radio-talker from Bill's hands. \"The BRUSH! Younidiot!\" I yelled into it. \"Oh, um, it's thenhighway, it's the highway!!\" Rabbit finally says. I threw it backnto Bill and lean back sighing. \"Just like your dad.\"nMom muttered. \"Where's the road Rabbit?!\" She said talking intonher mic. \"It should be anynmoment-\" Rabbit said. Suddenly, we get onto the highway right innfront of Jonas' group. \"You're insane Jo!nWhat are you trying to do, get somebody killed?!!\" Jonas yelledninto the radio. I grabbed the mike fromnher and started yelling in it. \"If that somebody is you than yea.nWe ARE trying to kill somebody.\" I threw it back to Mom. \"We're gonna have tonget off of this road.\" Bill says. Then, I realize, he's right. Wenhave to get off this road quick. \"He's right mom.\"nI said. \"What? This is nontime to guess-\" But she was cut off by Bill. \"I'm not guessing.\"nHe said. We needed to make a right turn. \"Make a right turn.\" \"Trust me.\" Billnsaid after me. Mom rolled her eyes. She wasn't used to takingnorders from me and Bill combined. Dusty said I got my dad's abilitynto track a storm correctly without any machines even though, theynhelp a lot. \"Do you want tondrive?\" She said to both of us. Then, we said the same thing at thensame time. \"Just Turn!\" Inheard him sigh and I rolled my eyes. Mom turns sharply ontona dirt road, the crew following. Then, Joey announces over the radio,n\"We've got a touchdown!\" \"We got a touchdown,ntouchdown, tornado is on the ground.\" Laurie says after Joey. \"Where is it?\" Momnasks. \"Looks like it'sncoming down route 33!\" \"Umm,\" I said.n\"We're on Route 33!\" \"Direction, Rabbit!\"nMom asks after a few minutes of trying to spot the tornado. \"North, northeast.\"nRabbit says. \"Do you see it?\"nBill asks Mom. \"No.\" She says. \"Do you Natalie?\"nBill asks me. \"Nope.\" I saidnpopping my lips at the p. \"Beltzer, we don'tnhave a visual. Repeat, we do not have a visual! Help us out, here!\"nBill says. \"Yeah, I got itnBilly. It's the best motion I've ever seen! It's like the base ofnthis fatty is about half a mile wide.\" Beltzer says. \"Maybe it's stalled.\"nMom reasons. \"No, I think Rabbit'snright.\" Rabbit told us we'd see it once we get over a hill. \"It'sngonna show it's ugly face right over that hill. Jo, what do younthink?\" \"You gonna go for it,nJo?\" Dusty asks. \"Time for deployment,nguys, let's do it!\" Jo says. \"Jo, we should dropnNatalie off with everyone else.\" Bill tells mom. \"No! If you get tongo, so do I!\" I shouted at him. He sighed. \"There's no reasonnto argue with her Bill.\" Mom tells him. \"She's stubborn.\" \"I'll get her ready.\"nI said talking about DOROTHY. I slid open the back window and slidnout. Hail was pounding hard. \"ARE YOU OKAY?!!!\"nMom asks me, slowing down her truck. \"I'M FINE, JUSTnKEEP GOING!\" I said as I flipped on a switch. DOROTHY's sirens gonon. Reaching inside, I put on my black jacket. \"Hold on, we'renalmost there, we're almost there!!!\" Mom yells. \"WHOOOAAAAAA!!! Stop,nthis is fine!!!\" I hear Bill shout. \"Wait, we got to getncloser, just a little closer!!!\" Mom reasons as a tricycle crashesnonto the windshield. \"Okay, that's close enough!\" We all pull DOROTHOYnonto the road as the tornado approaches. Suddenly a telephone polenfalls on Dorothy, knocking her onto the road, all the sensorsnspilling everywhere. The tornado is gone suddenly. \"Where-- Where'dnit go? Where is it?!!\" Bill shouts. We hear the tornado'snroar; however, we don't see it. \"It's back Bill!\" Mom shouts. \"It's not throughnyet!! You're right it's backbuilding! We've got a jumper here!\"nBill yells. Mom tries to pick upnthe sensors that had fallen out of DOROTHY. \"It's not gonna dropnanywhere near us, it's gonna drop right on us!!\" Bill tries tonreason with her. The tornado disappears as soon as he pulls her intonthe truck but she broke free. \"Jesus Christ, listennto yourself, you're obsessed!\" Bill yelled. I sat on the tailgatenas they argued. \"You've never seen itnmiss this house, and miss that house, and come after you!\" Momnyelled straight back. \"When's it gonna benenough, huh?! How close do you have to get-\" Bill yelled. Hengrabbed her hand as she started to walk away. \"Talk to me!!! Jo,nthings go wrong, you can't explain it, and you can't predict it!nKilling yourself won't bring your dad back. I'm sorry he died, but itnwas a long time ago. You gotta move on. Stop living in the past andnlook at what you've got right in front of you!\" \"What are younsaying?\" Mom asked confused. \"Me. Jo, me andnNatalie.\" He said shocking me. I walked over to him and hugged himnsurprising him. But, he hugged back and I whispered in his ear, \"I'mnsorry for being mad Dad.\" Tears started to flow from my eyes as Momnwalked around making sure everything was alright with the truck.[Chapter 6] After the last tornado,nwe headed to see 'The Shining' and I walked up with mom to thensnack bar. We ordered nine coffees and I briefly saw mom reach fornthe pen on the tray. She reached into her pocket and pulled out anbundle of papers. The Divorce Papers… She's gonna sign them. \"Mom, are you sure?\"nI asked. Any person could tell she didn't want to sign it. Shendidn't answer me but signed her name declaring that once thenlawyers got this paper, she'd be Jo Greene again. And, I'd gonwith either mom or dad. \"It's for the bestnNJ. For me, him, and you.\" She says after signing them. \"Two Coffees please.\"nDad said walking up to the counter. I looked down and messed with mynphone while mom waited for her nine coffees. \"You know, I've beennthinking about the sensors. The way they scattered out there today onnthe highway. I'm starting to wonder if the funnel will carry themnlike we thought.\" Dad said to Mom. She was confused. \"Too light?\" Wenboth asked. \"I don't know, maybenthe whole things too light.\" Dad said. Oh yea, ever since thatnincident with the last tornado, I called him Dad, not Bill. But, Inwas never going to call Melissa my mother. \" When's it gonna be enough, huh?! How close do you have to get-\"nBill yelled. He grabbed her hand as she started to walk away. \"Talknto me!!! Jo, things go wrong, you can't explain it, and you can'tnpredict it! Killing yourself won't bring your dad back. I'm sorry hendied, but it was a long time ago. You gotta move on. Stop living innthe past and look at what you've got right in front of you!\" \" Whatnare you saying?\" Mom asked confused. \" Me.nJo, Me and Natalie.\" He said. \"I'm notnsure.\" He said. Mom stares atnthe TV inside the snack bar. It too is gone to static, Mom looks atnit, the warning obvious to her. Dad notices as well. The wind isnsoftly howling. Suddenly, Mom first, then Dad turns to the northnlooks up at the sky. You can tell, as storm chasers, they can sense antornado coming. The wind grows louder. There is a low rumble. Dustynis in the van watching the Doppler radar. He suddenly grows verynstressed. \"JO! BILL! NJ! IT'SnCOMING!!! IT'S HEADED RIGHT FOR US!!!!\" Dusty screamed coming outnof his van. \"It's already here.\"nDad said looking around. \"EVERYBODY UNDERGROUND NOW!!\" Henshouted. The tornado sirens went off. \"BILLY!\" Melissanscreamed running out of the motel-room she was in that was part ofnthe drive-in. \"Honey! Come on!\"nDad grabs Melissa's hand and runs towards the warehouse, but stoppednwhen he saw me and mom froze. Suddenly she snaps outnof it. She runs to the snack bar, banging on the windows to warn thenemployees, screaming. \"GET UNDERGROUND, TAKE COVER RIGHT NOW, LETSnGO!!!!!!\" Mom screamed. As she did that, I grabbed the divorcenpapers. \"The doors!! Closenthe Doors!! Doors! Doors!!\" Dusty screamed but I saw Laurencenhiding his car, so did mom and we ran outside to get him. \"BILL!!\" \"Come on, take mynhand.\" I said to him. \"I can't-\" Laurencensaid but I interrupted. \"Take my hand!!\" Everyone scrambles tonthe pit in the floor of the warehouse, where they all crowd togethernup in a corner in fetal position. The whole warehouse begins tontremble. The windows implode. Suddenly, a hub cap flies through thenair and cuts Preacher's forehead. Mom holds his head to stop thenbleeding. \"My head!\" Preachernshouted. \"You're okay!\" Momntold him. \"IT'LL BE OVERnSOON!!!\" Dad yelled to Melissa. \"THIS IS INSANE!!!nTHIS IS INSANE!! I DON'T LIKE THIS!!! THIS IS DRIVING ME CRAZY!! InCAN'T DO THIS ANYMORE!!!!\" Melissa screams as I put my hands to mynears to shield them from her voice. \"STAY CALM!!!\" Dadnyelled. \"Its okay, honey!nIt'll be okay!!\" I heard Dad shout at Melissa. While my hands werenover my ears, a beam fell and hit my head. Ow… It took all mynstrength to keep quiet and awake. Suddenly, the windsnstart to die down, the lights buzz and go out. Dad notices the rednstreaks in my hair and runs over to me. \"Are you ok Natalie?\"nHe asked worriedly. \"NATALIE!\" I lookednup at saw Mom running toward me. I was surprised. She never called menNatalie. Never. \"You called menNatalie.\" I told her. \"That is your namenisn't it?\" She joked then she turned serious. \"DOES ANYONE HAVEnA FIRST-AID KIT?\" She shouted. \"I do.\" A woman whonwas working at the snack counter walked up and gave Mom the first-aidnkit. She then started to clean my wound. \"Don't cry babyngirl.\" I heard dad say. That's when I realized, I was crying. Henpulled me into his arms and kissed my forehead. \"That's the most Incan do, ok kid?\" Mom said, using her nickname again. I nodded andnstood up. Mom went over to Dusty,nwho was in his van, me and Dad followed, with his arm around mynwaist. \"Can you tell whichnway it's headed?\" She asked Dusty. He looked worried but answerednanyway. \"Its backingnnortheast. It's um......It looks to hit Wakita head on.\" \"I'm goin'. I'mngoin', let's go, let's go!!!\" Mom yelled. \"We're going!!!!\"nDusty yelled. I saw Dad's eyes flicker back and forth from Melissanto Mom. \"Just go withnMelissa. You said, you'd stay for one day whether DOROTHY flew ornnot. We'll just carpool with someone.\" He was about to saynsomething but I handed him the divorce papers I grabbed before thentornado. \"Mom signed them. I hope you're happy with Melissa.\" Intossed them at him and walked over to mom who was mad because shencouldn't call Aunt Meg. \"Where's the phone?!\"nMom yelled. \"The lines are down,nJo, I already tried.\" Beltzer told her. \"We're going.\" Momnsaid. \"Damn it. Hang on,nI'll drive.\" Bill said walking up. \"Hey, Jo, look. Wencan jump on the 38 exchange and cross highway 132.\" Rabbit said. Bill walked over tonMelissa. The first word I heard was, \"You know, I can't competenwith this. I don't even know where to start!\" \"Bill, come on!\"nDusty shouted. \"We can be in Wakitanin about an hour. Bill, common'!!!\" Rabbit yelled. Bill came up andnI saw him place an engagement ring in his front pocket. He had brokennup with Melissa or she broke it off with him. Everyone loaded up inntheir vehicles and, me, mom, and Bill loaded up in his truck. We allnstart driving to Wakita. When we get there, we see that, we're toonlate. Author's Note: Inmight finish the story Sunday or earlier Monday before I get too busynbut I'm not going to update without more reviews. Thank you LTJMnand JenD106 for reviewing on all of the chapters so far! You twonrock![Chapter 7] \"Ohnmy God.\" I hear Bill say as we drive into Wakita. \"Theynhad no warning.\" Mom says. \"Oh, my god.\" I couldn't have saidnit better myself. \"Jo,nWait!!!\" Bill yelled as Mom got out of the truck and ran towardnAunt Meg's house. It's been packed down into one story. Strangely,nmost of the wind sculptures still stand. He got out and followed her.nI, slowly, got out and looked around. They really did have nonwarning. \"Meg?!!\"nMom yells into the upstairs window. \"Jo,nWait!!!\" He yelled again. I quickly ran and got in front him. \"MEG?!!!!!\"nShe yells again. I was behind her and Bill was behind me. \"Jo,ntake a flashlight!\" Bill yelled. I seriously needed to get somenear-plugs. Incase you haven't noticed, I don't like screaming ornhearing people scream. They entered the window and before Bill gotnin, he warned me, \"Please stay out and look for Dusty and thenothers.\" \"MEG!!!nMEG!! Meg, Bill!!!!\" Dusty yelled coming up to me. Then, he said tonme, \"Natalie, take my watch.\" \"Go,ngo!!! Careful!!\" Beltzer yells as Dusty is about to enter thenwindow. \"BILL?!!\" Dusty yelled. Then, Mom and Bill come outncarrying out Aunt Meg. \"We'renokay, we're coming out!\" Mom informed us. \"Ohnreally,\" I said sarcastically. \"That would explain why you'renhere and alive!\" \"Notnnow, Natalie! Get an ambulance over here!\" Bill yelled at me. \"Getnan ambulance, Laurence, Now!!!! Go!!\" Dusty hollered at Laurence,nand helped Bill and Mom with Aunt Meg. Lawrencenruns to flag down an ambulance. An ambulance comes over, a paramedicnhops out, gets a stretcher, they lays Meg on it. Then she realized,n\"Bill! Natalie! Grab Mose for me, I think he's a little shaken up!\" \"Don'tnworry I'll get him.\" Bill said. \"Mose!\" He yelled going backninto the house. I sighed and followed him. \"Be careful.\" Henwarned me. I nodded and rolled my eyes. \"Itsnokay, it's okay.\" I said to Mose once we found him. Bill picked upnhim and I pushed stuff out of the way. We got out of the housenunharmed. Just as we got out, the house collapses as the way. Wenwalked over to Meg would was arguing. \"Overnight?nForget it. I'm all right.\" Meg said. I knew if she was going to gonto a hospital, she would have to drive herself. But, I saw her car inna tree coming into Wakita. \"You'rengoing to the hospital.\" Mom says, worried about her. Tornados haventaken away too many people from her. Her parents, Bobby, and almostnme. \"Okay,nI'll go, but I'm gonna drive myself.\" See how correct I amnsometimes? \"Honey,nyour car is in a tree around the corner.\" Rabbit tells her. \"Ohh…\"nShe says and allows the paramedic to take her into the ambulance. Inwalk over to Dusty's van to check the weather reports. \"ThenF4 that hit Wakita has now moved on to the north-east, I've justngotten word in that an even stronger tornado has now started to formn25 miles south of Wakita, but right now the two storm systems arenfunneling back, the National Weather Service saying that this isnhighly unusual and they are saying that this tornado could be thenstrongest in the state in more than 30 years-\" Dusty goes overnto tell Beltzer and I walk over to mom and Aunt Meg. \"Hey,nwhat're you doin'?\" She asks us. \"Inwanna see how you are.\" Mom tells her. \"I-nwe were worried about you.\" I tell Aunt Meg. She had a wrist bracenand on her head, she was supporting white, bloodied up, and tightnbandage. \"Oh,nlook at this-\" Mom says to Meg. But Meg interrupts her. \"It'snnothing. He says I have a bump on the head, and maybe a brokennwrist....\" I left them alone and walked over to her house. Youncouldn't really tell it was one, but I knew it. I was so wrapped upnin my thoughts; I didn't notice Bill come up beside me. \"Younknow that I never wanted to hurt you.\" He told me. I didn'tnrealize there were tears till he held his hand up to my face, andnwiped them off. \"Yea,nbut it didn't stop the blow.\" I said quietly. \"No matter whatnyou do, it's going to hurt someone, somewhere. Whether you knownthem or not.\" \"Donyou know why I never pressed your mother about the papers till Dustynsaid something about it?\" That brought up old memories. \" Bill!\" I heard Dusty yell into a phone. I was 14 and I knewnhe was talking to the dad that left me and my mother years ago. I'venonly seen him a couple times but I preferred to stay with my mom. \" Are you still in love with Jo?\" He asked. I listened closely.nThere was a small pause. \"Well, you file for divorce and you don'tneven try to get her to sign them as quickly as possible.\" There was another pause. Then, Dusty said, \"Man, it's startingnsuspicious.\" There was a pause where I knew Bill was talking.n\"Alright, bye.\" And Dusty hung up his phone and went back tonlistening to some old 70's music. \"BecausenI was still in love with her. But, I thought she wouldn't take menback after running off. I knew you wouldn't forgive me. Inwas supposed to be your super-hero but I ran away.\" \"Younknow,\" He continues. \"It's my fault Bobby's dead you know.\" Infelt the tears come back to my eyes. \"It's mine. I was so selfishnand I was so mad at him for blaming me that you left.\" He was aboutnto talk but I continued. \"I didn't warn him when Nana told mentoo.\" He hugged me and for once, I lost control. I cried into hisnchest, ruining his shirt. Most people, who knew me, would never thinknthey'd see the day; I'd just break down and cry. But, here I was. \"It'snnot your fault, alright baby girl?\" He told me. I nodded and wipednthe tears from my eyes. \"You know, this is the first time I saw youncry.\" \"Younshould check on mom. She's probably upset about Aunt Meg going tonthe hospital.\" I mumbled. He nodded, kissed me on the cheek, andnthen walked over to mom. \"Allnright, I need every aluminum can you can find!\" I heard Mom yellnafter a few minutes. Then, dad started talking. \"Wenneed cutters and duct tape! Haynes, Beltzer, I want to get the lastnDOROTHYs on the back of my truck, and I want everyone working on it!\" \"We'rengone!!\" Dusty said. Half of the team goes to Beltzer's vanncutting pin-wheel fans out of aluminum cans and screwing them ontonthe sensors. I had the craziest feeling that DOROTHRY was going tonfly. Author'snNote: This is the next to last chapter. I thought about making thisnone but I thought the big F5 tornado should have its own chapter. AndnI will NOT reveal who Bobby is. Some may be able to guess though. HOWnBOBBY RELATES TO THE STORY WILL IS REVEALED IN THE LAST CHAPTER.[Chapter 8] Warning: Language Haynes, Beltzer,nRabbit, and everyone else pulls out boxes of sensors, now with thenfans attached. Box, after box, they dump them back into Dorothy 3 andnDorothy 4. I watched as they did this. After that, I climbed into thentruck, for the last time, maybe. \"Half a mile more?\"nMom asks Dad as we drive along the road. It was the 2ndnday Dad has been back with us. But, I really didn't expect him tonstay. \"That's sounds right.nI figure we'll put it right in the middle of the road.\" He tellsnher. \"Unless you thinknsomebody will hit it.\" Mom said, not thinking. Who'd be on a roadnwith an F5 tornado? Oh right, us! \"Nobody will benthere.\" I told her. She nods understanding. The F5 tornadonapproaches the road that we are on. We're in Dad's truck, Dad isndriving. The roar of the tornado is deafening. Dad stops the car, andnMom and Dad get out. I stay in the car, because Dad made me promisento stay in here since my head isn't fully healed. The tornado is onnthe road, directly in front of them. He goes around and he and Momntake Dorothy # 3 out of the back of the truck. \"Hurry! Let's go,ncommon'!!!\" I heard Dad shout. They both get back in the car andndrive a distance away. While Dad is doing that, Mom talks into thenradio. \"Dusty, you in position?\" \"Yeah, we're prime,nready for contact!\" Dusty screamed. \"This is it. Bill:nIt's gonna work.\" Mom said. Then I realized DOROTHOY was too light.nShe only tip over and make a mess. \"It's too light-\"nDad said but Mom interrupted him. \"NO IT'S NOT!!\" \"We're losing it!\"nI shouted. \"No we're not! Shencan still fly!!!!\" Mom said not believing that DOROTHOY was toonlight. Just like me and Dad told him. Suddenly an uprootedntree tips Dorothy over, and the tornado decides to changendirection...... towards us. \"Let's go!!!\" Momnyelled. \"My God!\" camenDad's response. We try to drive away,nbut the car gets stuck on the uprooted tree in the middle of thenroad. \"Oh my God....\" \"Common'!\" Dadngrunted trying to get back the tree, \"Get us off thisnthing!\" \"Comon'!\" \"Bill, kick it!\" \"DAD!! Let's go!nRight now! Hurry!!!!\" \"What is that?!!\"nMom yelled. We both see something metallic flying around in thentornado. It is a tank truck! \"Bill, hurry! HURRY!nHURRY!!!!!!\" Dad floors it again, no success. \"HURRY!!!\" He throws his wholenbody weight onto the gas pedal. \"Hold On!!!!!\" Suddenly the carnsnaps forward as it's nudged by the tank truck coming right at us. \"LET'S GO!!\" Momnshouts. Suddenly the tank truck falls to the ground right in front ofnus, exploding. We drive right through it. \"Son of a bitch!\"nDad yelled. \"Natalie, Jo, Bill,nYou all right?!! Fact, can you guys hear me? You okay?\" Dustynshouted into the radio. \"We're okay.\" Momnsaid. \"Did you see thatnexplosion?\" He asked excitedly. \"We saw it.\" Shensaid humorlessly. \"This one, she'snstill moving northeast on 80, you copy?\" Rabbit said. \"This is it.\" Dadnsaid \"Last one.\" Momnsmiled a little but I could tell she was sad. \"Last Time.\" Infinished. \"They have to benthere somewhere.\" Dad said talking about Jonas' crew. \"Theynhave position. They could make it.\" \"Not unless theynanchored the pack.\" I said. Mom said into thenradio, getting on the same frequency as Jonas. \"Jonas? This is Jo.nCan you hear me?\" \"Not now, Harding.\"nMom smiled a bit about having the same last time as Dad before thendivorce. \"Jonas, listen to me.nThe pack is too light, the twister will toss it before it reaches thencore, you'll have to anchor it.\" \"Oh, sharing valuableninformation, Jo? I'll consider that, thank you.\" I rolled my eyes. \"Jonas, what's yournposition?\" Dad said into the radio to Jonas. \"Oh, howdy, Bill. Wenare heading northeast running parallel and about to pull ahead of itnon the left, why?\" \"Hang back a minute;nwe've got a pretty good view from back here. She could shift herntrack, and if she does, she's gonna come right at you! D'you copy?\"nDad was being nice. He never wanted anyone to die, no matter if henhated them or not. He was right though. If it did shift, Jonas'nteam would die or be severely injured. \"Jonas, listen to me.nThis is not-\" \"Get off thisnfrequency, Bill!!\" Then, Jonas switched off his radio. \"She's shifting.\" Insaid slowly. It was heading right toward Jonas' team. \"Oh my God. Jonas,nI'm telling you…. Eddie, I know you can hear me! Turn around now!!nGet out of there!!!\" Bill yelled into the radio. The tornado shiftsndirection and spins over Jonas' crew. We watch as the black Windstarsnfly through the air. Suddenly a radio tower slams through thenwindshield, killing Eddie and Jonas. We watches Jonas' car crash andnexplode. Mom flinches at this. In a fit of rage, Dad throws down thenradio mic. \"Damn it!! Stupid.\" \"We tried. There'snnothing we could do.\" Mom told him. And she was right. Jonas gotnhim and his own team killed. \"Bill, Jo, groundnspeed is increasing. Get ahead of it as fast as you can or she'sngonna bury ya!\" Beltzer screams into the radio. \"Debris!!! DUSTY, WEnHAVE DEBRIS!!!\" Mom shouts as debris flies past the truck. Thendebris consists of cars, tractors, road signs. It's fallingneverywhere. Mom directs Dad as it all falls around them. \"RIGHT!!!!!!\" \"LEFT!!!!!!\" \"RIGHT!!!!!!\" \"LEFT!!!!!!\" Suddenly a house comesnrolling along and stops on the road. \"Oh my God.\" I saidnwithout thinking. \"I think we're goin'nin!!\" Dad states. \"AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!\"nMom screamed. \"Maybe we should getnoff of this road.\" He says after we went through the house. \"I think you may benright.\" She said breathless. \"We're goin' in.\"nDad states. \"You ready?\" He says to me. I nod. Carefully, I opennthe back window of the truck and crawls through. DOROTHY # 4 isnloaded up in the back; quickly I switch it on and crawl back inside. \"She's up.\" I toldnthem. Mom looked out her window and I climbed over the seat to sit innthe middle of them. \"You ready?\" Momnasks Dad. \"Yeah. Let me justnset the cruise control. Okay we're good.\" \"On three?\" Momnasks. \"On three. Go.\"nThey open the doors and stand, the truck is still going 50. \"One.\" Dad says. \"Two.\" Mom saysnafter him. Then, I shout, \"Three!\"nOnce they jumped out, I jumped out the passenger seat and landednbeside mom. We stand up and watch the truck continue into thentwister. As the truck and Dorothy are lifted up into the twister, andnthe sensors fly up into the air, we hear the haunting sound of thenwind chimes. We all get in a group hug. \"Oh no! RUN!!!!!!!!\"nDad shouts. The tornado shifts and starts coming toward us. We ran asnfast as possible which meant: Me in front, Dad behind me, runningnwhile holding Mom's hand. \"The barn, common'!! Look out!!!\" We run to the barn.nFence boards slam and stick in the barn walls. They get inside.nSickles, knives, and saws hang from the ceiling. \"Stay down!!\" Dadnwarned us. \"Who are thesenpeople?!\" I asked. \"I don't think so!!nCommon'! Let's get out quick!!\" We run out of the barn, and thennduck as the roof of the barn flies over their heads. \"Oh my God!nCommon''! Run for it!!\" Dad shouted. If everyone keeps shouting, mynears are going to start bleeding. We continue to runnuntil they get to pump house. The door to the pump house won't open.n\"COME ON!!!!\" He finally opens it. As we got inside, anpiece of a roof flies past her. She screams. They go inside. The wellnis a \"U\" shaped pipe coming up out of the ground. \"Here! These pipes gondown at least 30 feet. We anchor to 'em, we might have a chance!\" \"Bill!\" Mom said. He Grabs a rawhidenstrap, ties it first around them, then loops it on to the pipes.n\"Hold on!!!\" The tornado loomsnoverhead; we were lifted up in the air, however still attached to thenpipes. Then, I get a major flashback. I rannthrough the hallways of Nana's house. Bobby had just told me thatndaddy left because of me. Tears ran down my face. He was my oldernbrother. He was supposed to be nice and caring but no! He had tonblame me! ' Thenreason that daddy left was because you were born! I remembered himnyelling at me. Nana found me and was scared. \" GetnBobby. Hurry!\" She pushed me toward the room he was staying in.nMommy sent us to her Mommy for the summer. Auntie Meg was sick so shencouldn't watch us. Inalmost decided to get Bobby from his room but then I remembered whatnhe said to me. So, I ran downstairs away from him and towards Nana. \" Where'snBobby?\" She asked me once I got down there. \" Hendecided not to come.\" I lied to her. She took my hand and ran intonthe basement. \" Staynhere. I'll be right back.\" But she never came back. Neither didnBobby. I went upstairs and saw something dark and moving. It wasnreally big and was heading toward me. BeforenI could move, I was in the air. Something kept slamming into me. Incouldn't breathe. Finally, I was let down. My whole body wasnhurting. Strange people came up to me and questioned me. I sawntwo bodies being moved out of the house. Nana and Bobby. We were looking at theninside of the tornado. It looked amazing! Lightning circles aroundnthe light, which was at the top of the twister. It suddenly goes awaynand we are now under the pipes. Everything was silent for a while. \"That was fun. Let'sndo it again.\" I said, jokingly. Mom cracked a smile and Dadnchuckled. \"You all right?\"nMom asked Dad, already forgetting me. When the team comes up I walkednover to them, as we watched my parents talk. Not argue, but talk. He nods. \"Wow, looknat that. It didn't take the house.\" \"We did it.\" Shensaid amazed. \"Yeah, we did.nDorothy really flew.\" \"It was a good idea.\" \"Yeah, well I....\" \"We've got so much tondo.\" Mom said. \"Yeah.\" \"I've got to getngrant approvals for a new warning system, we need a bigger lab,nyou've got to do an analysis of all that data....\" \"I do?\" Dad asked. \"Yeah, we've got tongenerate models out of all this data; and I need to run the lab-\" \"Oh, no, no, no.nYou're doing the analysis, I'm running the lab.\" It amazed me thatnthey didn't realize we were watching and listening to their talk/ \"You're running thenlab? I don't think so!\" Mom said like he was insane. \"I'm running the lab!nG- Do you always have to do things the hard way?\" When Dad saidnthis, we walked over to them. \"You got it guys, thensensors worked! The computers went crazy; we've got data coming outnof our ears!\" Haynes stated, smiling. Beltzer had his arm aroundnher. \"Biggest twister evernrecorded!!\" He said. \"Awesome, man!\"nDusty said. Laurence laughed at him and hugged me from behind. \"Hey, Jo, Bill, checknout that sky!\" Sanders yelled. I felt Laurence rest his head on mynshoulder. The sky is clear. \"You know what; Inthink we've seen enough!\" Mom says. Dad smiles at her and leans andnkisses her. I feel Laurence kiss my neck. Everything's good.

I wrote most of them from the twister script. I donNOT own Twister. This is the website: You found out aboutnBobby and how Jo's mom died. Yes, they probably would still benalive if Bill didn't leave and Natalie wasn't so mad at Bobby butnthings happen. Please read my other story, One Thousand Miles ClosernTo You. It's a Chronicles of Narnia story. About a girl namednSavannah. You don't have to read it though. Hope to be able tonwrite the sequel to Learning To Fall.

NOWnBILL'S BACK WITH"},{"Movie":"Twister","Title":"Choices To Be Made","Author":"Incendiar Riddle","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7472498","Passage":"[Chapter 1] Alright, I have never really written a Twister fic before. But it's my all time favorite movie from when I was little. Besides, while at school. I'm bored so I thought why not write a fanfiction of my favorite movie. I found the perfect script from the movie and have seen it over a million times, so much that we had to get a new dvd of it. You may recognize some parts from another fanfiction called Learning To Fall, it somewhat relates to it. This is my take to my favorite type of Twister fanfiction; The Daughter. But for me it just happens to be, the Twins. I don't own the movie Twister nor any of it's characters! I only own Noah, Melanie, Faye, and Brent. And whatever other characters you don't recognize. Bill Harding drove his Red Dodge Ram Truck down the highway. His bride to-be Melissa Reeves beside him. Along with one of his daughters and their boyfriend. Melanie and Noah in the back seat. They drove down the dirt road with quite a few of pot-holes. They were heading to a spot in the field that Bill was sure his ex-wife Jo Harding was at with her department. They needed the divorce papers if Melissa and Bill were to get married. Melanie wasn't so happy with the fact. She was mainly coming because she was quite sure that her twin Faye would be there with their mom. Melissa said to Bill, \"Um, and honey. Are you sure she's gonna be here?\" Bill nodded and continued to drive. Finally, he answered her. \"If I know Jo, she's already dragged her entire department into the field. Ah, hell, a day like today, it's to be expected. She forgets everything except her work.\" Melissa saw his anxious expression. He was seeing his soon-to-be ex wife and his other daughter Faye. He hadn't seen her in years, he usually just had Victoria, his sister and the twin's aunt, to drive Melanie over to visit. Since Faye never wanted to see him again, and basically acted as though he wasn't her father. Melissa hadn't met Faye yet. \"You're nervous about seeing her, aren't you?\" Melissa stated. \"Nervous? No. Why, do I look nervous?\" Bill asked. He was nervous. Who wouldn't be? His daughter wouldn't speak to him. Melissa started to shake her head but then she saw her fiancé's face. It was nervous. \"No. Well, yeah you do, a little.\" Then she changed the subject. \"Does Faye know about the engagement?\" Bill shrugged. \"I haven't talked to her or Jo in a while. So, I'm guessing she doesn't. \" Melanie stared at her father, of course Faye didn't know! Her father wouldn't even let her tell Faye the last time they had visited which was last night by webcam. All she knew was that Bill was dating a new woman. \"Jo said she signed the papers, right?\" She asked. Bill didn't know. Last time he talked to Jo, she said she had. \"That's what she said.\" He told her. Wasn't she there when the conversation between him and Jo took place? \"You don't think so?\" Melissa asked worriedly. The marriage ceremony was coming up and she didn't want to reschedule the date once again. \"No,\" Bill smiled. \"I think so. Give me a kiss\" Melissa leaned over and kissed the side of his mouth and Bill continued to drive. Melanie rolled her eyes, Noah just laughed at her and kissed her cheek. Melanie was the funniest girl he ever knew. He was anxious to meet Faye, wondering if she'd judge him because he was dating her sister. Faith (Faye) Harding was the other twin. She had gone with their mom when the divorce happened and Melanie ended up with Bill. Her mom, Jo Harding, chased twisters along with her research/storm chasing team: Dusty, Rabbit, Beltzer, Haynes, Sanders, Laurence, Preacher, and Joey. She was now 16 years old and has been out chasing storms with her mom since she was 12. Her dad, Bill Harding, had left when she had turned 11 taking Melanie with him. Faith had dirty blonde hair and blue-grey eyes. Like her father, she was stubborn and like her mother, she loved science. Everyone called her Faye unless she was in trouble. As the sun shone, she laid in the back of her blue truck. Her hair fell into her eyes, which were closed. Dusty had told her about the papers. It was sad that if she wanted to know anything she had to go to Dusty or Rabbit. \"Oh, fuck! This thing is useless!\" Jo yelled suddenly which scared Faye. Her eyes shot open and she sat up. She saw her mom on top of a van, messing around with a Doppler-Radar. \"Sorry, Jo.\" She heard Beltzer say. Then it started moving. \"Wait, wait, wait. Beltzer!\" She banged her foot on the roof. \"That's good. Give me a reading!\" Beltzer got of the van, grumbling. \"Okay, boss lady, hold your horses.\" He went over to his lap-top that was connected to the radar. \"Which way do you want it, Jo?\" Jo, who was sitting on her feet, stood up and looked at the sky. Then she told Beltzer, \"Looks like the dry line has stalled. Give me a sector scan west, northwest, look at mid-levels for rotation and increase the PRF.\" Faye rolled her eyes and went over to Dusty. He was sitting in his van listening to 70's music and watching weather forecasts. Dusty, aka Dustin, was the dad in Faye's life. But, he was more fun and way more awesome. Whenever she got detention, he covered for her. \"If I mistreat you girl,\" He was singing. \"Sho' don't mean no harm...\" Then, he noticed Faye. \"Oh, hey Faye.\" She gave a small wave. She usually visited everyone or texted Mel when she was bored. Next, she visited Rabbit and Laurence. Rabbit was giving Laurence a lecture about how we're not supposed to fold the maps. But, roll the maps instead. Only Laurence folded them, although he denied it. Nothing seemed interesting so she walked over to her mom who was trying to get something that was under her truck. When Faye got over there, she put her hair in a bun, reached under the truck, and pulled out her mom's pack of gum. \"Thanks kid.\" She smiled. Jo never called her daughter Faith; it was either, kid or Faye. But, Faye didn't mind. She was at home chasing tornados. Where the lab was nature. Then she heard Rabbit yell, \"Hey, I don't believe it! Who is that handsome devil?\" \"Gentlemen\" She heard another voice say. It sounded familiar. \"The Extreme! IT'S THE EXTREME!\" Dusty yelled. Faye headed back over to her truck and laid in the back again. She closed her eyes. Then she felt someone jump on the back. \"Faye, where are the papers?\" Mom asked me. Behind her, was a man. He had dark brown hair and blue-grey. Just like Faye's. \"Glove department.\" She grumbled then she stood up. Faye walked over to her mom's yellow truck and got the divorce papers from the glove department. She tossed them at her mom, who caught them with no difficulty. \"Hey, Faith.\" The man said. Then, she recognized him. It was her dad, Bill. Of course, he was only here for the divorce papers. Not for her or Jo. \"Hey Bill. It's Faye.\" Faye said. Feeling awkward, she looked over at her mom who was reading through the last page of the pack of the papers. Faye knew her mom avoided that page from keeping the divorce final. Jo had by no means stopped loving Bill, even though he stopped loving her. She had told Melanie this. \"What are you doing?\" Bill asked her. Jo turned her head toward him and answered, \"Can I read it first?\" Bill sighed once again. What was the rush, Faye thought. Oh yea, he probably didn't want to be here. \"No! It's the same as it was in December.\" Jo then responded lying. She had read every page a few times over, some even out loud. \"I didn't read it in December.\" \"Christ,\" Bill sighed. \"Would you just sign it so we can get out of here? Please?\" Who were we? Oh yea, probably a girlfriend or something. But she also looked around in hope. Hoping that her sister had come with. \"We?\" Jo asked understanding. \"She's here?\" \"Yes, she's here, she's over with Dusty. Now would you please sign the document?\" Jo took this as a solution from getting out of signing the divorce papers. \"You left her with Dusty? What's the matter with you?\" Jo left the papers and started to walk over to Dusty's van. Faye gave her dad a confused look then she walked after her mom. Bill, after grabbing the papers, followed too. \"The suck zone- it's the point- basically at which the twister sucks you up, but it's not that technical therefore obviously, but-\"Dusty was saying before he got interrupted by Jo. \"Hi.\" Jo said. \"I'm Jo Harding.\" She held out her hand for the black-haired woman to shake. \"Oh hello,\" She said, getting up. \"Nice to meet you.\" The woman shook her hand. \"Bill just told me the happy news.\" Jo said. Wait, Faye looked at the woman's hand. It had an engagement ring on her ring finger. \"YOU'RE GETTING MARRIED?\" She yelled just as Bill walked over with the papers in hand. \"That.\" Jo said, hiding her hurt. \"It's happy news.\" Faye looked at her mom disbelievingly. The mom she knew would sometimes stay up all night crying that her life was pointless since her dad was dead and Bill left. \" I guess, uh, it probably seems kind of sudden.\" The woman said, fidgeting. Jo said, \"Seems sudden?\" \"Dude, you takin' the vows? That's sweet!\" Dusty said. He had always avoided girls when they were sad, depressed, or angry. But, he knew that Jo had feelings for Bill. \"Well, we- we just wanted to get it done before Billy started his new job.\" The woman said. Billy? Seriously, thought Faye. \"That's right, that's right, right, right, right. Weatherman!\" Bill then replied, offended, \"What?\" Then Jo said innocently, \"What?\" Then they got into a small argument. It wasn't as big as it usually was but still… Then, someone's phone rang. Faye looked around and saw the black-haired woman answered her phone. \"Dr. Melissa Reeves here? Uh-huh?\" So, her name was Melissa, thought Faye. Faye spotted a cherry red Dodge Ram and walked over to it. She heard footsteps behind her. When she turned around, Bill and Jo were behind her. \"New truck?\" Jo said. \"That's right.\" Bill said. Faye hated to be around them when they talked. It was always awkward. \"Boy oh boy. New job, new truck, new wife...It's like a whole new you\" Jo said sarcastically. Faye just walked away. It was very awkward being around them. She went back to her truck, stepped in, and listened to music. She stopped however when she heard a knocking on the glass. She turned off the music and gestured for the person to come around to the passenger side. She couldn't believe it! She opened the door. She took a good look at the girl in front of her. She was basically unrecognizable. It was Melanie. She screamed \"MEL!\" And Melanie screamed \"FAYE!\" They hugged, and Mel rolled down the window, gestured for someone to come and then muttered to them something about a tote. The person left and came back with a bag that Faye thought was the tote. Mel took the bag, and told the person to come closer with a coy look. Then her and the guy kissed, and said \"We'll be out in a sec. And Faye, that's my boyfriend Noah.\" Faye looked shocked and hugged Mel, saying \"Congratulations!\" Then she rolled up the windows, and put up a sheet she had gotten from the bag on the back windows. They hopped into the back and changed into the identicial clothes. Black band tees with silver jeans and black high-tops. They put their hair into a side braids. They took black rectangular framed glasses and put them on. Unknowest to their father and his girlfriend. The twins were practically blind. Before Bill had taken Melanie from Jo, Jo and some of the team went and got them contacts. They sighed at their work, and took the curtain down, and putting it away in the back seat, ready to leave at a moment's notice. They left the truck to go join the others. What do you think?[Chapter 2] Thanks to Dean Winchesters Baby Girl and JenD16 for reviewing. As well those who alerted and favorited! I apologize for the lateness of this chapter. But I got quite busy with school. I might end up doing at least 2 more chapters between now and Christmas! I love you guys so much! Faye and Melanie got out of Faye's truck and walked over to where her parents, Melissa, Dusty, and Haynes were at, which was at Jo's truck, looking at DORTHOY. Haynes walks away and is on the phone with someone. Excitedly, she hangs up. \"Jo, we got major action! The NSSL says the caps are breaking, the tower's going up to 30 miles up the dryline!\" Haynes told Jo. Jo looks up at the sky, she pauses, then suddenly focuses, slamming the tailgate. \"All right, let's go!\" Everyone starts packing their things, and Natalie runs to her truck and makes sure that DORTHORY 6 is tight on the back. \"Dorothy 2 and 3 ready!\" Beltzer says. \"Dorothy 4 ready!\" Haynes says. Everyone gets into their vehicles and they all waved, except the twins, Noah, and Jo; who honked the horn, as they passed Bill and Melissa. Faye called for Melanie to join her, who called for Noah to join them. They were in the back of the line, behind Dusty. She didn't notice anyone behind her till she saw a flash of red. That's when she looked back and saw Bill's truck following her. She says into the radio to Jo. \"Mom, why is he coming?\" She asked. \"Who?\" Then Jo saw a red truck following her daughter's truck. \"I don't know.\" Faye sighed and continued to drive. \"Jo, I think we got fleas.\" Beltzer said into the radio to Jo. Faye looked up the line of cars passing her teams. It was Jonas Miller's team. \"Jo, come back!\" Bill's voice said. Faye and Melanie didn't know that Bill tapped onto their frequency till they heard him talk. \"Hey there, you change your mind?\" Jo said. She had been glad Bill came along. But, at the same time, not. He probably was only there for her to final the divorce. \"Yeah, what's Jonas doin' here?\" Bill said. Black Windstars pass the whole team. Faye had flipped them off while Dusty made kissy-faces and Melanie just stuck her tongue out at them. Jo responded to Bill, \"I'm not sure. But I bet he's asking himself the same question about you.\" That's when Faye switched her radio off. She heard noises and looked back. Bill had swerved off the road. Because she wasn't paying attention, she swerved off the road. Her tire went flat. Bill parked behind her and got out. Melissa stepped out also, but kept by the truck. Faye and Melanie were trying to see if the tire was able to make it to the nearest station. \"Need a ride?\" Bill asked. Faye looked up startled. Sighing, Faye nodded and got her stuff out of the truck. Bill followed the team to the repair station where he got his tire fixed and Faye vanished with Dusty somewhere. When they appeared, she had a drink and he was soaked. They all looked across the street where Jonas' team was parked. Jonas, himself, was being interviewed by TV reporters. Bill got mad when he saw the instrument. It was like his design of DORTHORY. \"What drives me is the unknown. What if we could predict a tornado's path? How many lives would be spared with the creation of an early warning system?\" He pulls out a large weather instrument. \"And D.O.T. 3 is the answer! The first digital orthographic telemeter. And inside, she holds hundreds of these little sensors.\" Holds one up \"Which when released into the tornado, will transmit back data on wind speed, pressure, and dew point temperature.\" Bill got mad and tried to punch Jonas for stealing his design but lucky, for Jonas, he got held back by Dusty and Beltzer. Jo ran over and stepped between her team and Jonas' team. \"Hey, hey, hey, hey! Guys, guys. All my guys get a grip on yourselves.\" She was being smug now. \"We both know he'll never get that thing up in the air.\" \"Well let me enlighten you people! This baby has satellite COM link. We've got on-board pulse Doppler, we've got NEXRAD real time. Today, we're gonna make history. So stick around.\" Jo lifts an eyebrow contemptuously. \"Cuz' the days of sniffin' the dirt are over.\" He said knowing that Bill sniffed dirt to help him with the tornados. \"Better than what you sniff.\" Rabbit injected in the conversation. Faye rolled her eyes. Couldn't they behave like grown-ups? Apparently, not. \"We'll see who gets their first, pal.\" Bill said to Jonas. \"Oh, and by the way, I really enjoy your weather reports!\" Jonas and his crew laugh. Bill tries to get at him again but Dusty and Bouncer hold him back. Faye rolled her eyes once again and walked into the diner. A few minutes later Melissa walked in and sat down at the counter beside Faye, who ignored her. \"I'm not trying to replace your mother, Faye.\" Melissa said after a few minutes of silence. Faye just snorted. \"I'm almost 17 years old, I'm not 7.\" When the waitress came about Faye ordered a Coke while Melissa ordered two lemonades for her and Bill. Jo soon walked in, but she got interrupted by Jonas. \"You know, Jo, I don't know what the matter is with Bill. I mean, he's wacko, he's crazy!\" Jo pretends to be deeply concerned with what Jonas is telling her, even though she could care less. \"You ought to keep a leash on him.\" \"He's not my problem, he's yours.\" Jo said to him. Faye got her Coke and walked out as soon as Jo sat down. Bill picked up a handful of dirt and lets it fall to the ground. He didn't notice his daughter stand beside him. \"I hope you know what you're doing.\" Faye said, softly. Bill looked up at her. \"What do you mean?\" Bill asked his daughter. He knew that Jo trusted her, but he didn't know how much. \"You file for divorce. Disappear for a year or two then you come back remanding the papers. It sounds like you hesitated.\" \"Faye. It's none of your business if I divorce your mother and marry Melissa!\" He said, not releasing he always got into an argument, just like Jo, when he talked to his daughter. Faye walked away to her mom's truck and Dusty came up to Bill. As soon as Melissa came out with the lemonades Bill realized where to track the tornado. \"We gotta move out. Listen, follow us in the truck, but stay behind Dusty's van, you'll be safe back there. I gotta go with Jo. Okay, let's move out, people! Let's go!\" Bill informed her. \"Faye! Get Melanie and Noah. Ride with Melissa!\" Faye grumbled and sat in the passenger seat of the shiny red truck while Melanie and Noah hopped into the back seat, and almost immediately started making kissy faces at each other. Melissa ran and drove off, following Dusty's van. Faye could tell that Jo and Bill were arguing. They always did. That's why Faye didn't talk to her dad often. Melissa's cell phone rings once again and she answers it. \"Dr. Melissa Reeves here? Oh, oh. Yes, Donald, you've caught me in my car!\" This Donald person had problems , thought Faye. \"Donald, this feeling of inadequacy is normal for you, Julia doesn't resent you. We talked about this before. She did not marry your penis. Oh, okay, she didn't only marry your penis.\" Fayee shook her head. She could see Melanie rolling her eyes. Melissa had weird patients. As they race along, they can see the tornado ahead. Cars passing the other way honk their horns, letting others know the impending danger. The national weather service has issued a tornado warning in effect until 11:00 am, the radio said. Faye cut it off. She knew there was a tornado touch down. Finally, she hung up after reassuring this Donald person that Julia loved him and not just his penis. Dang, I'd hate to be her sometimes, Faye thought. First, marrying Bill, then 2nd, she has patients who probably did trucks. \"What was that about?\" Faye asked Melissa. \"I'm a therapist.\" Explains so much. \"Oh.\" Silent Pause. \"My dad's?\" \"Do you think your dad needs therapy?\" Melissa asked her. \"Probably.\" She muttered. The rest of the car ride was silent. \"Oh. My. God.\" Melissa said. Faye looked up and faintly, saw something yellow falling down from the sky. Then, she realized it was her mother's truck. It fell right in front of the truck and Melissa narrowly missed it, not wrecking the truck in anyway. Everyone ran over to make sure they were alright. \"You just missed the truck! Awesome! IT'S AWESOME!\" Dusty said. \"Melissa!\" Bill yelled. \"Oh God, Billy, BILLY!\" Overdramatic? Jo walks by and Faye walks over to the truck to grab her things. \"You okay?\" Jo asked her daughter. She nodded. \"Well, there's some good news. It did fly.\" Dusty says talking to Jo as she breaks a window and pulls her stuff out of the totaled truck. \"What was it like?\" \"It was windy.\" She said. \"Windy? That's intense-\" Dusty said before Jo interrupted. \"All right, move it, Dusty!\" \"That's intense! That's intense!\" He replies holding his hands up. \"Hey, the auto club's here!\" Joey yelled as the familiar black Windstars passed them. Dusty runs up to the van and puts his upper body in the window. \"Fashionably late again, Jonas? Fashionably late! Gimmie kiss, baby!\" \"Loser! Loser!\" Dusty shouted coming off of the van. \"Why don't you find your own twister, buddy!\" Rabbit yells. \"Loser!\" Dusty says while acting like he's directing traffic.\" Move on!\" Beltzer said, \"Let's go.\" Haynes walks over to DOROTHY 2. \"Don't worry, I'll get 'em cleaned. Common' guys let's get DOROTHY 2 ready!\" \"You got full coverage on that truck?\" Jo says to Bill, who has his arms around Melissa. \"Liability only.\" Bill informs her. He really knows why Jo's asking why Melissa isn't. She replies, wiping her face with a towel \"Liability only?\" Then, she gives them a look that's a cross between \"Whatever that means\" and \"That's a scary thought!\" \"It's a very pretty truck.\" Bill makes a nervous laugh; he knows what she's up to. She wants to use his truck for the chase. Jo looks at him as she throws all her stuff in her backpack. \"Don't even think about it.\" She continues looking at him \"No way.\"[Chapter 3] Jo, Bill, Melissa, Noah, Faye, and Melanie driving in his truck with the next DOROTHY loaded up in the back. Melissa, Noah, Melanie and Faye are in the back while Jo and Bill are in the passenger seat. For once, they weren't arguing, which amazed Faye. \"This is the caboose, this is the caboose! I'm waiting for orders, Boss!\" Dusty said. Both Jo and Bill grab for the radio mic. They hesitate, then both grab again. Faye sighed and gazed out of the window before looking at her parents. \"Just freaking choose who's going to grab it!\" She said. \"Go ahead.\" Bill said. \"It's your truck.\" Jo told him. Faye sighed and rolled her eyes. \"No, really. You should.\" Finally, Jo picks up the radio mic and starts talking into it. \"Dusty, the battle zone should be northeast of 81.\" \"Copy that, Jo.\" \"Wait a minute. Battle zone? Billy, what're we doing?\" Melissa asked. Bill was focused on driving and Jo was looking at the maps. \"It means, we're going out again.\" Faye explained and Melanie snapped out of her lovey dovey staring at Noah before nodding and going back to gazing at Noah's eyes. \"Again? But back there you almost got yourself killed!\" Melissa nearly shouted. \"It's in the job description of being a tornado chaser.\" Faye told her. \"And, anyways it was a close call.\" She sighed and looked out the window. \"You're gonna cross 15 on Oklahoma412. 412.\" Rabbit informs Jo over the radio. Jo starts talking to Haynes. They keep driving. Jo dramatically leans over to see the speedometer. Goin' 50. She slaps her forehead. That's too slow! Bill rolls his eyes and speeds up. Off in the distance you could see another twister. Then over to Jonas' group. Jo's group speeds up so that they're neck and neck. \"There's your pal.\" Jo said to Bill as they passed Jonas' van. Bill and Jonas glare at each other and keep driving. Suddenly, Bill slams on the breaks. \"What're you doin', what're you doin'?\" Jo exclaims. \"Look at the updraft, the angle! It's gonna shift it's track!\" Bill said answering her question. \"Are you sure?\" Jo asked. \"Oh yes. It's defiantly a sidewinder! It'll move left.\" Jo realized that Bill was correct. The tornado was going to shift its track. \"Is that bad?\" Melissa asked. \"No.\" Mel answered. \"Not for us anyways.\" \"Wasn't there a road back there?\" Bill asked. Jo, then, answered him, looking back. \"You're right, go, go, go, GO, GO!\" Bill turns the truck around, driving fast. Then turns right onto a different road and speeds ahead. Melissa's phone rings. \"Hello? Donald, now's not a very good time for me, okay? What...all right, put Julie on. Okay.\" The tornado starts to shift to the left, just like Bill predicted. Melissa responding to the phone call with \"Uh-huhs\" and \"Yeahs\" while Jo listens in with Faye. \"I know it feels unnatural but with Donald's motility, you're not gonna have this baby the old-fashioned way. Even if you stand on your head.\" Faye peered over the seat and gave Bill a look, while Jo looked at him weirdly. Then, he explained, \"She's a, reproductive therapist.\" \"Laurence? Laurence come in, we've got to get ahead of this storm, what's on the satellite?\" Jo asks Laurence into the radio. \"I can't talk to you right now; I'll have to call you back.\" Melissa says, hanging up her cell phone. \"Twister south, skipping south, shifting to south, we have a, F2, ladies and gentlemen, possibly F3. You with me? It's a very, very large rope on the ground. Very large. Right on the ground.\" Laurence explained. \"It looks like its turning; it looks like its turning. The atmosphere is very unstable! Repeat, unstable!\" Joey says into the radio then Rabbit said, \"This is Rabbit, this is Rabbit, it's at 2:00, it's headed this way!\" \"This is Sanders, this is Sanders! We're driving due east on a country road we've been on for about 6 miles. We've got an F3, 2, sitting on the ground, and she's a beauty! WHOOHOO!\" \"Jo, its Barn Burner, its Barn Burner! It's not gonna hang out long. It's not hanging out long!\" Dusty said. \"We're getting slammed in here guys, you better hang back.\" Bill says. The rest of the group slows down a bit, while Bill, Jo, and Melissa drive on. They see the tornado. Jo grabs a camera. Jo is about to take a picture of the tornado, when she notices the rain on the window. He floors the gas. They approach a bridge going over a large lake. The tornado is hanging over the lake, sucking up water. The four are racing it in Bill's truck. Suddenly, the twister splits in half. Now there's two! \"Okay, we've got sisters!\" Bill announced. \"We're right under the flanking line.\" Said Jo. \"Julie, I know you're upset, you just gotta, breathe, we've both just gotta breathe!\" Melissa says into her phone talking to Julie. Suddenly, a cow flies past, in front of them. \"Cow.\" Jo and Faye said at the same thing. \"Another cow.\" Jo says as the same cow flies by. \"Actually, I think that was the same one mom.\" Mel said, breaking off from Noah to watch. Noah staring out the window surprised. \"We've got drunkards here, we've got no path!\" Bill said. He floors the gas, and then realizes that won't work; the truck can't go that fast, he slams on the breaks. The whole time they're all screaming. There are now three tornadoes, swirling around the truck like a carousel. \"HANG ON!\" Bill shouts. The truck begins to slide and spin. \"Honey, hang on!\" Melissa screams, Mel, Faye, and Jo grabs the roof of the car, and Noah just whooped. Unexpectedly, the twisters elevate back into the clouds and are gone. For a second, all look like in shock. Then Bill and Jo hop out of the truck excited, leaving Melissa, still frozen with fear. Jo and Bill hug and laugh. Faye climbs out and makes sure that was DOROTHY undamaged. Noah got out and helped Melanie out, him smiling at her as if he was seeing another side of her. \"God! Was that incredible?\" Jo screams. \"Did you see it? It was incredible!\" Jo replies screaming back. Jo points up to the clouds where the twisters disappeared. The team arrives in their trucks. Jo screams to the rest of her team, \"Did you see that?\" Meanwhile, Bill was trying to calm down Melissa. \"Relax, Melissa. It's just the start of it all.\" Faye said, smirking. \"Three times a lady!\" Beltzer says. Joey says, \"Did you see the inflow jets on these fatties?\" Jo tells them the entire epic tale as she climbs up into the back of truck, by DOROTHY and Faye. Jo screams, \"Did you see? I was sitting in the middle of it!\" Laurence says, \"I was thinking, it may not be too bad of an idea, if we just got the hell out of here.'Cuz that was defiantly too many tornadoes back there... \" Jo replied, \"Are you kidding? This thing's not over, we've only seen the start of it! \" Rabbit says, \"Hey, you know what, uh, Jo, somebody couldn't help but notice how close we are to Wakita.\" \"No!\" Jo said. \"Come on mom!\" Faye and Melanie chorused together. \"Yeah, and Aunt Meg wouldn't mind a pit stop, right?\" Sanders says after the twins. \"Red meat, we crave sustenance!\" Dusty says smiling. \"Guys, we are not invading my aunt!\" Jo yells. \"FOOD! FOOOOD!\" Everyone but, Bill, Melissa, and Jo chants food over and over again. \"HEY! We are absolutely not going!\" Faye and Mel smirked knowing that they would end up going to Wakita to visit Aunt Meg and get something to eat. It always happened. And most of the team was in need of a shower.[Chapter 4] The administrators of are as of June 4th going to be taking down Fics that have lemons or have extreme violence. Now I don't know about you but I think thats stupid. There are many wonderful fics that only have one or two lemons in them yet the plot itself is awesome! You can't just take down a 100,000+ word fic just because it has a lemon in a chapter that is only 1000 words long. Now I urge you all to read the petition below, sign it, and repost this to your own fics. Hopefully if we make enough noise everything will return to normal. Thank you. Greetings to the fine folk that moderate our site. Myself, along with many, have been writing and posting on your fine site for years now, some of the better examples of up and coming writers out there are now suddenly finding some of the stories we've come to love at risk of being removed without the chance to even rectify our errors. For some, that means the permanent loss of a story. While I don't have anything that I believe violates your terms of use, there are those out there that are never able to recover a story in its original form, this is something I find to be almost worthy of a legal action, as while we cannot claim ownership of a character, the stories are OURS and simply destroying them is something that is inexcusable. It's quite easy to simply add an MA rating, additional filters or even a simple requirement for a free membership to read the stories presented here, and would cut down on hateful anonymous reviews and posts at the same time, so I have to question as to why such a thing, in all this time, simply wasn't added. If you're worried about falsification of a registration then have an appropriate disclaimer and then there can be no dispute, you took your steps and the PARENTS didn't monitor their children, if that is even your concern. If it is more of a personal view or desire then please at least let people know and give them a chance to remove a story that you and yours find offensive, most people on the site are actually rather cordial when it comes to such requests. While I cannot say for sure if this letter will even reach those that may be willing to listen, of if it's more akin to a wide spectrum purge in preparation for something bigger, please understand that you are going to be looseing a LARGE number of your writers, and thus your income from a lack of readers if there is not some level of action taken to help with this situation. For those that may agree with this, please feel free to sign on and send this to the support server, maybe we can get some movement on this.

But might change in the future. Oh well, I had a busy summer but since I'm back to school with nothing else. I got time to do the fanfic! Yay! And I thought I might do another but maybe after this is done. [Faye's POV] \"BILLY!\" Aunt Meg yelled as soon as we walked into her yard. \"MEG!\" Bill replied to Aunt Meg, leading Melissa behind him. She was still freaked out by the triple twisters but Mel and I personally, like our mom, thought it was awesome. Bill thought it was awesome too, but he seemed to care more about Melissa's sanity, if she still has any left. \"Day before yesterday, I was telling Jo,\" Meg says dramatically \"how much I miss you!\" Bill and Dusty laugh at this display \"You haven't seen any of my new work!\" Then she noticed us and mom. \"Jo! Oh honey!\" She kissed our mom on the cheek then both of us on the forehead. \"Seen some action?\" Aunt Meg asks Jo, who replied honestly, \"You should have seen it.\" Everyone, but Melissa, got around to hugging Meg, even Noah enthusiastically hugged her. Melissa and Noah were introduced to Meg then we walked into the kitchen for Meg's home-style cooking that we missed so much. Rabbit, aka Robert, starts talking between bites of food. \"No, in a severe lightning storm you want to grab your ankles and stick your butt up in the air.\" Somehow, they got onto the topic of lighting. \"He's right, if you're gonna get hit, it's the safest orifice.\" Haynes informs us. Then, Joey decides to be sarcastic. \"Yeah, I'd like to get hit by lightning once. Ya know, see what its like.\" \"I'm with ya.\" I told him. He held his hand up for a high five and I gave it to him. Then, I pulled out my phone and started to text. And I looked quickly over to Mel, and like I thought she was making moony eyes with Noah. \"Who are you texting, Faye?\" Dusty asked me. I rolled my eyes. \"Clara and Mikki.\" I answered then put my phone away and started to eat. \"Hey, this is real lemonade. Hey, Meg, I'm movin' in here!\" Laurence said after he took a sip of the lemonade Meg made. \"You can bunk with me now Laurie!\" I said. Laurie was my nickname for him. He stuck his tongue out at me and I repeated the action. \"You guys look out, make a space. Look out, look out, look out.\" Mom plops a huge chunk of beef on Melissa's plate. Melissa looks at it, almost disgusted. \"It's good, Melissa.\" I informed her. She still didn't eat it. I laughed and shrugged, oh well, she's missing out on Meg's beef. \"God, Meg, you've got a lot of beef. Where'd you get all this beef?\" Rabbit asks after he took a bite of the beef. \"Did you see my cows out front?\" Meg asked. \" \"No.\" Rabbit said while chewing the beef. \"Ohhhh!\" She makes a gasping face, everyone laughs, except for Melissa. \"Ohh. Cool.\" Rabbit said looking down. When he looked up I smirked at him and he rolled his eyes. \"You slaughter your own cows,\" Dusty says impressed. \"Meg! Nice.\" Mom plops down a bowl of mashed potatoes and gravy. Dusty ends up putting food on Melissa's plate that she doesn't eat and mom is waiting for Bill to get out of the shower. \"Oh, pardon me gentlemen. You guys gotta see this.\" Bill says as he walks to the TV after his shower. He cranks up the volume on the TV. \"Well for me, it's the thrill of the hunt.\" Jonas says. \"Man vs. nature. Having battle with the elements.\" \"So as a scientist, can you actually predict tornadoes now?\" The reporter on TV asks. \"Well, no, they are very, very unpredictable, as some of my more unfortunate colleagues found out earlier today.\" Jonas says talking about our chasing team. \"Oh, turn him off.\" I told Bill. But, he ignored me. Haynes said the same thing but he ignored her also. Bill turns off TV and says, \"What a wiener\" \"He really is in love with himself.\" Mom says. Then I said, \"I thought it was just a summer thing. Hey Mel, good thing you got rid of that thing you had for him!\" Mel just gave me a glare and shook her head cuddling up to Noah. \"He's gonna rue the day. Dude, he's gonna rue the day he came The Extreme, baby.\" Dusty said about my dad. \"I was just wonderin' why you call Billy \"The Extreme?\" Melissa asked us. \"Cuz' Billy is the extreme.\" Dusty said. \"Bill is the most out of control son of a bitch in the game!\" Preacher said after Dusty. \"No, I think I came in second.\" Bill says looking at mom. She sighs and turns toward the stairs but calls back, \"You guys need to get some new stories. I'm gonna go clean up.\" \"So we get this one near Dalton-\" Dusty said but was interrupted when Bill said, 'Oh, God.' \"We're way too close, and Jo got the bid on it, she's filmin' it, right. And all the sudden, out of nowhere, this shity looking valiant, comes pulling up, right in the way.\" Dusty says telling Melissa. \"She starts yellin'. And this loser, stumbles out of the car, he's got like, a bottle of Jack Daniel's in his hand. He's naked-\" Beltzer says talking over the story. \"He's BUTT naked.\" Rabbit put in. \"Naked.\" Says Beltzer. \"NOT naked.\" Bill said. \"I was not naked! Honestly, you're telling this story in front of Faye and Mel?\" \"They've heard worse man.\" Dusty said. I pushed myself away from the table and walked outside and sat on the porch step. A few minutes later, Mel and Noah joined me out there. [No One's P.O.V] \"He's without apparel.\" Beltzer continues the story just like Faye, Mel, and Noah didn't leave the table. \"Half naked.\" Bill reasons but it doesn't work. \"Naked. So, Jo is yelling at him to get out of the way, right.\" Dusty says. \"He just- He strolls up to the twister, and he says \"Have a drink.\" And he chucks the bottle into the twister, and it never hits the ground!\" \"Twister caught it, and sucked it right up.\" Preacher says. Melissa was looking weirdly the whole time at Bill. In her head, according to these people, Bill was naked and he threw liquor into a twister. \"Honey, this is a tissue of lies. See there was another Bill, an evil Bill- and I killed him!\" Bill explains to Melissa. Everyone gets to talking about the twister, except Melissa, an hour or two ago. \"No, that was a good size twister, what was that, an F3?\" Preacher says. \"Solid F2.\" Bill claims. \"See now you've lost me again.\" Melissa says to her fiancée. \"It's the Fujita scale. It measures the intensity of a tornado by how much it \"eats\".\" Bill explains. \"Eats?\" Melissa questions. Bill replied, \"Destroys.\" \"The little encounter we had back there was a strong F2, F3 maybe.\" Laurence decides. \"Bet we see some F4's today.\" Beltzer says. \"That'd be sweet!\" Haynes says smiling at her boyfriend. \"4 is good, 4'll re-locate your house fairly officially.\" Bill says. \"Is there an F5?\" Melissa asks. Everyone becomes silent. \"What would that be like?\" \"The finger of God.\" Preacher says. \"None of you have ever seen an F5?\" Melissa asks. \"Only three of us.\" Everyone's eyes, but Melissa, dart upstairs to where Jo was showering and outside where the twins were. [Mel's P.O.V] \"WE GOT ONE, BABY! F3! A MILE OUTSIDE PARLAINE!\" I heard Dusty shouting from inside.[Chapter 6] [Faye's POV] \"You ride along with Dusty, okay, is that cool?\" Bill says to Melissa. I slip into the back of his truck with Mel and Noah, while mom gets in the drivers seat. Once Bill gets into the truck, they all start driving, with the truck in the front. Mom picks up the radio-talker and talks into it. \"Rabbit?\" \"Hang on!\" Then, he pulls out a road atlas. \"Uh, let's go right through Wakita, we'll take Myers Road past the fire station, and we'll take 132 to 44 east.\" \"Rabbit, do you know any shortcuts, let us know, we need every second!\" Bill said to Rabbit as I fixed my side-braid. My band tee was dirty and so were my jeans. My high-tops were okay, so were my glasses thankfully. Mel was doing the same but also gave Noah a kiss on the cheek. \"Okay, Rabbit, time to impress me!\" \"Okay, about a mile up there's a little detour we're gonna take, a little walk in the woods!\" Rabbit announces. I wonder where that man's mind is half the time, I looked over at Mel who was looking at me. She was laughing, she thought Rabbit would become saner as time went on, but obviously that wasn't true. They turn onto a winding dirt road, through a thicket. As Jo's driving over a bump, he says into radio, \"Hey, its bumpy here, folks.\" Then he turns to my mom. \"Okay, let's get you wired.\" He puts a wireless mic headset on her, clipping the receiver on her shorts. \"Oh, excuse me,\" He says. I could tell mother-dearest was enjoying him being that close. \"Okay, you're on!\" \"See, kids? An ordinary person spends his life avoiding tense situations!\" Beltzer says into the radio making me laugh. \"Repo man spends his life getting in to tense situations, BELTZER! WOOO!\" Dusty replies. \"Okay, Rabbit, what have you got?\" Bill asks. I could see his blue-grey eyes, just like me; flicker around, just like I would do. Dusty told me that when ever mom looked at either Mel or me, she thought of Bill's eyes. \"Okay, Bill, turn left here toward that farm.\" Rabbit says. \"You sure about that?\" Bill responds. \"Uh, yeah. Trust me. Rabbit is good, Rabbit is wise.\" Rabbit says making me chuckle. The nickname Rabbit was picked up when Mel said he was a smart-ass, a few years back when she joined us on a chase. \"Christ...\" Bill muttered then he said into the radio. \"This is a field, Rabbit!\" \"I know, keep going, beyond it, right through that brush!\" Bill didn't respond. \"You see that brush right in front of you...\" \"Yeah, we see the brush, what's beyond that?\" Bill asked. I sighed. \"Beyond what?\" Rabbit asked. I knew there was a smile on his face. Annoyed, I grabbed the radio-talker from Bill's hands and Mel leaned forward to the radio-talker. \"The BRUSH! You idiot!\" Mel and I yelled into it. \"Oh, um, it's the highway, it's the highway!\" Rabbit finally says. I threw it back to Bill and we leaned back sighing. \"Just like your dad.\" Mom muttered. \"Where's the road Rabbit?!\" She said talking into her mic. \"It should be any moment-\" Rabbit said. Suddenly, we get onto the highway right in front of Jonas' group. \"You're insane Jo! What are you trying to do, get somebody killed?!\" Jonas yelled into the radio. I grabbed the mike from her and started yelling in it. \"If that somebody is you than yea. We ARE trying to kill somebody.\" I threw it back to Mom. Mel gave me a look, and I raised my eyebrows at her and crossed my arms. She knew I was talking about the brief time when she was 13 that she had a thing for Jonas. \"We're gonna have to get off of this road.\" Bill says. Then, I realize, he's right. We have to get off this road quick. I looked over at Mel, and I knew she was thinking the same thing. \"He's right mom.\" Mel said. \"What? This is no time to guess-\" But she was cut off by Bill. \"I'm not guessing.\" He said. We needed to make a right turn. \"Make a right turn.\" \"Trust me.\" Bill said after me. Mom rolled her eyes. She wasn't used to taking orders from me and Bill combined. Dusty said we got our dad's ability to track a storm correctly without any machines even though, they help a lot. \"Do you want to drive?\" She said to both of us. Then, we said the same thing at the same time. \"Just Turn!\" I heard him sigh and I rolled my eyes while Mel giggled. Mom turns sharply onto a dirt road, the crew following. Then, Joey announces over the radio, \"We've got a touchdown!\" \"We got a touchdown, touchdown, tornado is on the ground.\" Laurie says after Joey. \"Where is it?\" Mom asks. \"Looks like it's coming down route 33!\" \"Umm,\" I said. \"We're on Route 33!\" \"Direction, Rabbit!\" Mom asks after a few minutes of trying to spot the tornado. \"North, northeast.\" Rabbit says. \"Do you see it?\" Bill asks Mom. \"No.\" She says. \"Do you Faye? Mel?\" Bill asks us. \"Nope.\" We said popping our lips at the p. \"Beltzer, we don't have a visual. Repeat, we do not have a visual! Help us out, here!\" Bill says. \"Yeah, I got it Billy. It's the best motion I've ever seen! It's like the base of this fatty is about half a mile wide.\" Beltzer says. \"Maybe it's stalled.\" Mom reasons. \"No, I think Rabbit's right.\" Rabbit told us we'd see it once we get over a hill. \"It's gonna show it's ugly face right over that hill. Jo, what do you think?\" \"You gonna go for it, Jo?\" Dusty asks. \"Time for deployment, guys, let's do it!\" Jo says. \"Jo, we should drop Mel, Faye, and Noah off with everyone else.\" Bill tells mom. \"No! If you get to go, so do we!\" I shouted at him. He sighed. \"There's no reason to argue with her Bill.\" Mom tells him. \"She's stubborn. But however Noah should.\" \"No! I want him to experience everything! After all, that's what we'll end up doing in the future!\" Mel shouted, I laughed. \"I'll get her ready.\" I said talking about DOROTHY. I slid open the back window and slid out. Hail was pounding hard. \"ARE YOU OKAY?!\" Mom asks me, slowing down her truck. \"I'M FINE, JUST KEEP GOING!\" I said as I flipped on a switch. DOROTHY's sirens go on. Reaching inside, I put on my black jacket. \"Hold on, we're almost there, we're almost there!\" Mom yells. \"WHOOOAAAAAA! Stop, this is fine!\" I hear Bill and Mel shout. \"Wait, we got to get closer, just a little closer!\" Mom reasons as a tricycle crashes onto the windshield. \"Okay, that's close enough!\" We all pull DOROTHOY onto the road as the tornado approaches. Suddenly a telephone pole falls on Dorothy, knocking her onto the road, all the sensors spilling everywhere. The tornado is gone suddenly. \"Where- Where'd it go? Where is it?!\" Bill shouts. We hear the tornado's roar; however, we don't see it. \"It's back Bill!\" Mom shouts. \"It's not through yet! You're right it's backbuilding! We've got a jumper here!\" Bill yells. Mom tries to pick up the sensors that had fallen out of DOROTHY. \"It's not gonna drop anywhere near us, it's gonna drop right on us!\" Bill tries to reason with her. The tornado disappears as soon as he pulls her into the truck but she broke free. \"Jesus Christ, listen to yourself, you're obsessed!\" Bill yelled. I sat on the tailgate as they argued. \"You've never seen it miss this house, and miss that house, and come after you!\" Mom yelled straight back. \"When's it gonna be enough, huh?! How close do you have to get-\" Bill yelled. He grabbed her hand as she started to walk away. \"Talk to me! Jo, things go wrong, you can't explain it, and you can't predict it! Killing yourself won't bring your dad back. I'm sorry he died, but it was a long time ago. You gotta move on. Stop living in the past and look at what you've got right in front of you!\" \"What are you saying?\" Mom asked confused. \"Me. Jo, me, Faith and Melanie.\" He said shocking me. I walked over to him and hugged him surprising him. But, he hugged back and I whispered in his ear, \"I'm sorry for being mad Dad.\" Tears started to flow from my eyes as Mel jumped out of the truck to join the hug and Mom walked around making sure everything was alright with the truck.[Chapter 7] [Faye's POV] After the last tornado, we headed to see 'The Shining' and I walked up with mom to the snack bar, Mel was off talking with Dusty with Noah, I swear she brought him everywhere. We ordered nine coffees and I briefly saw mom reach for the pen on the tray. She reached into her pocket and pulled out a bundle of papers. The Divorce Papers… She's gonna sign them. \"Mom, are you sure?\" I asked. Any person could tell she didn't want to sign it. She didn't answer me but signed her name declaring that once the lawyers got this paper, she'd be Jo Greene again. And, Mel and I would go with either mom or dad. \"It's for the best Faye. For me, him, and you two.\" She says after signing them. \"Two Coffees please.\" Dad said walking up to the counter. I looked down and messed with my phone though secretly sending Mel a quick text about what mom did, while mom waited for her nine coffees. \"You know, I've been thinking about the sensors. The way they scattered out there today on the highway. I'm starting to wonder if the funnel will carry them like we thought.\" Dad said to Mom. She was confused. \"Too light?\" We both asked. \"I don't know, maybe the whole things too light.\" Dad said. Oh yea, ever since that incident with the last tornado, I called him Dad, not Bill. But, I was never going to call Melissa my mother. \"When's it gonna be enough, huh?! How close do you have to get-\" Bill yelled. He grabbed her hand as she started to walk away. \"Talk to me! Jo, things go wrong, you can't explain it, and you can't predict it! Killing yourself won't bring your dad back. I'm sorry he died, but it was a long time ago. You gotta move on. Stop living in the past and look at what you've got right in front of you!\" \"What are you saying?\" Mom asked confused. \"Me. Jo, me, Faith and Melanie.\" \"I'm not sure.\" He said. Mom stares at the TV inside the snack bar. It too is gone to static, Mom looks at it, the warning obvious to her. Dad notices as well. The wind is softly howling. Suddenly, Mom first, then Dad turns to the north looks up at the sky. You can tell, as storm chasers, they can sense a tornado coming. The wind grows louder. There is a low rumble. Dusty is in the van watching the Doppler radar. He suddenly grows very stressed. \"JO! BILL! FAYE! IT'S COMING! IT'S HEADED RIGHT FOR US!\" Dusty screamed coming out of his van with Mel and Noah. \"It's already here.\" Dad said looking around. \"EVERYBODY UNDERGROUND NOW!\" He shouted. The tornado sirens went off. \"BILLY!\" Melissa screamed running out of the motel-room she was in that was part of the drive-in. \"Honey! Come on!\" Dad grabs Melissa's hand and runs towards the warehouse, but stopped when he saw me and mom froze. Suddenly she snaps out of it. She runs to the snack bar, banging on the windows to warn the employees, screaming. \"GET UNDERGROUND, TAKE COVER RIGHT NOW, LETS GO!\" Mom screamed. As she did that, I grabbed the divorce papers, Noah ran past with Mel on his back, she gave me a look as they past running to the warehouse. \"The doors! Close the Doors! Doors! Doors!\" Dusty screamed but I saw Laurence hiding his car, so did mom and we ran outside to get him. \"BILL!\" \"Come on, take my hand.\" I said to him. \"I can't-\" Laurence said but I interrupted. \"Take my hand!\" Everyone scrambles to the pit in the floor of the warehouse, where they all crowd together up in a corner in fetal position. The whole warehouse begins to tremble. The windows implode. Suddenly, a hub cap flies through the air and cuts Preacher's forehead. Mom holds his head to stop the bleeding. \"My head!\" Preacher shouted. \"You're okay!\" Mom told him. \"IT'LL BE OVER SOON!\" Dad yelled to Melissa. \"THIS IS INSANE! THIS IS INSANE! I DON'T LIKE THIS! THIS IS DRIVING ME CRAZY! I CAN'T DO THIS ANYMORE!\" Melissa screams as I put my hands to my ears to shield them from her voice, Mel and Noah cuddling right next to me with Mel holding my hand with the one that wasn't holding Noah's. \"STAY CALM!\" Dad yelled. \"Its okay, honey! It'll be okay!\" I heard Dad shout at Melissa. While my hands were over my ears, a beam fell and hit my head. Ow… It took all my strength to keep quiet and awake. Suddenly, the winds start to die down, the lights buzz and go out. Dad notices the red streaks in my hair and runs over to me, Mel let go of Noah's hand and had me lay my head on her lap and she cleared my hair from the cut. \"Are you ok Faith?\" He asked worriedly. \"FAITH!\" I looked up at saw Mom running toward me. I was surprised. She never called me Faith. Never. \"You called me Faith.\" I told her. \"That is your name isn't it?\" She joked then she turned serious. \"DOES ANYONE HAVE A FIRST-AID KIT?\" She shouted. \"I do.\" A woman who was working at the snack counter walked up and gave Mom the first-aid kit. She then started to clean my wound. \"Don't cry baby girl.\" I heard dad say. That's when I realized, I was crying. He leaned over and kissed my forehead. \"That's the most I can do, ok kid?\" Mom said, using her nickname again. I nodded and stood up. Mom went over to Dusty, who was in his van, me and Mel followed, with her arm around my waist. Dad following right behind us. \"Can you tell which way it's headed?\" She asked Dusty. He looked worried but answered anyway. \"Its backing northeast. It's um...It looks to hit Wakita head on.\" \"I'm goin'. I'm goin', let's go, let's go!\" Mom yelled. \"We're going!\" Dusty yelled. I saw Dad's eyes flicker back and forth from Melissa to Mom. \"Just go with Melissa. You said, you'd stay for one day whether DOROTHY flew or not. We'll just carpool with someone.\" He was about to say something but I handed him the divorce papers I grabbed before the tornado. \"Mom signed them. I hope you're happy with Melissa.\" I tossed them at him and walked over to mom who was mad because she couldn't call Aunt Meg. \"Where's the phone?!\" Mom yelled. \"The lines are down, Jo, I already tried.\" Beltzer told her. \"We're going.\" Mom said. \"Damn it. Hang on, I'll drive.\" Bill said walking up. \"Hey, Jo, look. We can jump on the 38 exchange and cross highway 132.\" Rabbit said. Bill walked over to Melissa. The first word I heard was, \"You know, I can't compete with this. I don't even know where to start!\" \"Bill, come on!\" Dusty shouted. \"We can be in Wakita in about an hour. Bill, common'!\" Rabbit yelled. Bill came up and I saw him place an engagement ring in his front pocket. He had broken up with Melissa or she broke it off with him. Everyone loaded up in their vehicles and, Mel, me, mom, and Bill loaded up in his truck, Noah went with Dusty. We all start driving to Wakita. When we get there, we see that, we're too late.[Chapter 8] [Faye's POV] \"Oh my God.\" I hear Bill say as we drive into Wakita. \"They had no warning.\" Mom says. \"Oh, my god.\" I couldn't have said it better myself. \"Jo, Wait!\" Bill yelled as Mom got out of the truck and ran toward Aunt Meg's house. It's been packed down into one story. Strangely, most of the wind sculptures still stand. He got out and followed her. I, slowly, got out and looked around. They really did have no warning. \"Meg?!\" Mom yells into the upstairs window. \"Jo, Wait!\" He yelled again. I quickly ran and got in front him with Mel. \"MEG?!\" She yells again. Mel and I was behind her and Bill was behind me. \"Jo, take a flashlight!\" Bill yelled. I seriously needed to get some ear-plugs. In case you haven't noticed, I don't like screaming or hearing people scream. They entered the window and before Bill got in, he warned me, \"Please stay out and look for Dusty and the others.\" \"MEG! MEG! Meg, Bill!\" Dusty yelled coming up to me. Then, he said to Mel, \"Melanie, take my watch.\" \"Go, go! Careful!\" Beltzer yells as Dusty is about to enter the window. \"BILL?!\" Dusty yelled. Then, Mom and Bill come out carrying out Aunt Meg. \"We're okay, we're coming out!\" Mom informed us. \"Oh really,\" I said sarcastically. \"That would explain why you're here and alive!\" \"Not now, Faith! Get an ambulance over here!\" Bill yelled at me. \"Get an ambulance, Laurence, Now! Go!\" Dusty hollered at Laurence and Noah, and helped Bill and Mom with Aunt Meg. Lawrence runs to flag down an ambulance with Noah tailing after him. An ambulance comes over, a paramedic hops out, gets a stretcher, they lays Meg on it. Then she realized, \"Bill! Faith! Grab Mose for me, I think he's a little shaken up!\" \"Don't worry I'll get him.\" Bill said. \"Mose!\" He yelled going back into the house. I sighed and followed him. \"Be careful.\" He warned me. I nodded and rolled my eyes. \"Its okay, it's okay.\" I said to Mose once we found him. Bill picked up him and I pushed stuff out of the way. We got out of the house unharmed. Just as we got out, the house collapses as the way, Mel followed us and said \"That was a close one. Could of toppled on top of you guys.\" We walked over to Meg who was arguing. \"Overnight? Forget it. I'm all right.\" Meg said. I knew if she was going to go to a hospital, she would have to drive herself. But, I saw her car in a tree coming into Wakita. \"You're going to the hospital.\" Mom says, worried about her. Tornados have taken away too many people from her. Her parents, Bobby, and almost me. \"Okay, I'll go, but I'm gonna drive myself.\" See how correct I am sometimes? I shared a look with Mel, knowing she thought the same exact thing. \"Honey, your car is in a tree around the corner.\" Rabbit tells her. \"Ohh…\" She says and allows the paramedic to take her into the ambulance. I walk over to Dusty's van to check the weather reports. \"The F4 that hit Wakita has now moved on to the north-east, I've just gotten word in that an even stronger tornado has now started to form 25 miles south of Wakita, but right now the two storm systems are funneling back, the National Weather Service saying that this is highly unusual and they are saying that this tornado could be the strongest in the state in more than 30 years-\" Dusty goes over to tell Beltzer and I walk over to mom and Aunt Meg. \"Hey, what're you doin'?\" She asks us. \"I wanna see how you are.\" Mom tells her. \"I- we were worried about you.\" I tell Aunt Meg. She had a wrist brace and on her head, she was supporting white, bloodied up, and tight bandage. \"Oh, look at this-\" Mom says to Meg. But Meg interrupts her. \"It's nothing. He says I have a bump on the head, and maybe a broken wrist...\" I left them alone and walked over to her house. You couldn't really tell it was one, but I knew it. I was so wrapped up in my thoughts; I didn't notice Bill come up beside me. \"You know that I never wanted to hurt you.\" He told me. I didn't realize there were tears till he held his hand up to my face, and wiped them off. \"Yea, but it didn't stop the blow.\" I said quietly. \"No matter what you do, it's going to hurt someone, somewhere. Whether you know them or not.\" \"Do you know why I never pressed your mother about the papers till Dusty said something about it?\" That brought up old memories. \" Bill!\" I heard Dusty yell into a phone. I was 14 and I knew he was talking to the dad that left me and my mother years ago taking my own twin sister with him. I've only seen him a couple times but I preferred to stay with my mom and just visiting my sister. \" Are you still in love with Jo?\" He asked. I listened closely. There was a small pause. \"Well, you file for divorce and you don't even try to get her to sign them as quickly as possible.\" There was another pause. Then, Dusty said, \"Man, it's starting suspicious.\" There was a pause where I knew Bill was talking. \"Alright, bye.\" And Dusty hung up his phone and went back to listening to some old 70's music. \"Because I was still in love with her. But, I thought she wouldn't take me back after running off. I knew you wouldn't forgive me. I was supposed to be your super-hero but I ran away.\" \"You know,\" He continues. \"It's my fault Erik's dead you know.\" I felt the tears come back to my eyes. \"It's mine. I was so selfish and I was so mad at him for blaming me that you left when he was supposed to be my best friend.\" He was about to talk but I continued. \"I didn't warn him when Nana told me to.\" He hugged me and for once, I lost control. I cried into his chest, ruining his shirt. Most people, who knew me, would never think they'd see the day; I'd just break down and cry. But, here I was. \"It's not your fault, alright baby girl?\" He told me. I nodded and wiped the tears from my eyes. \"You know, this is the first time I saw you cry.\" \"You should check on mom. She's probably upset about Aunt Meg going to the hospital.\" I mumbled. He nodded, kissed me on the cheek, and then walked over to mom. \"All right, I need every aluminum can you can find!\" I heard Mom yell after a few minutes. Then, dad started talking. \"We need cutters and duct tape! Haynes, Beltzer, I want to get the last DOROTHYs on the back of my truck, and I want everyone working on it!\" \"We're gone!\" Dusty said. Half of the team goes to Beltzer's van cutting pin-wheel fans out of aluminum cans and screwing them onto the sensors. I had the craziest feeling that DOROTHRY was going to fly.[Chapter 9] [Faye's POV] Haynes, Beltzer, Rabbit, and everyone else pulls out boxes of sensors, now with the fans attached. Box, after box, they dump them back into Dorothy 3 and Dorothy 4. I watched as they did this. After that, I climbed into the truck, for the last time, maybe with Mel. \"Half a mile more?\" Mom asks Dad as we drive along the road. It was the 2nd day Dad has been back with us. But, I really didn't expect him to stay. \"That's sounds right. I figure we'll put it right in the middle of the road.\" He tells her. \"Unless you think somebody will hit it.\" Mom said, not thinking. Who'd be on a road with an F5 tornado? Oh right, us! \"Nobody will be there.\" Mel told her. She nods understanding. The F5 tornado approaches the road that we are on. We're in Dad's truck, Dad is driving. The roar of the tornado is deafening. Dad stops the car, and Mom and Dad get out. I stay in the car, because Dad made me promise to stay in here since my head isn't fully healed, and Mel stayed with me. The tornado is on the road, directly in front of them. He goes around and he and Mom take Dorothy # 3 out of the back of the truck. \"Hurry! Let's go, common'!\" I heard Dad shout. They both get back in the car and drive a distance away. While Dad is doing that, Mom talks into the radio. \"Dusty, you in position?\" \"Yeah, we're prime, ready for contact!\" Dusty screamed. \"This is it. Bill: It's gonna work.\" Mom said. Then I realized DOROTHY was too light. She only tip over and make a mess. \"It's too light-\" Dad said but Mom interrupted him. \"NO IT'S NOT!\" \"We're losing it!\" I shouted. \"No we're not! She can still fly!\" Mom said not believing that DOROTHY was too light. Just like me and Dad told him. Suddenly an uprooted tree tips Dorothy over, and the tornado decides to change direction... towards us. \"Let's go!\" Mom yelled. \"My God!\" came Dad's response. We try to drive away, but the car gets stuck on the uprooted tree in the middle of the road. \"Oh my God...\" \"Common'!\" Dad grunted trying to get back the tree, \"Get us off this thing!\" \"Comon'!\" \"Bill, kick it!\" \"DAD! Let's go! Right now! Hurry!\" \"What is that?!\" Mom yelled. We both see something metallic flying around in the tornado. It is a tank truck! \"Bill, hurry! HURRY! HURRY!\" Dad floors it again, no success. \"HURRY!\" He throws his whole body weight onto the gas pedal. \"Hold On!\" Suddenly the car snaps forward as it's nudged by the tank truck coming right at us. \"LET'S GO!\" Mom shouts. Suddenly the tank truck falls to the ground right in front of us, exploding. We drive right through it. \"Son of a bitch!\" Dad yelled. \"Faith, Jo, Bill, Melanie, You all right?! Fact, can you guys hear me? You okay?\" Dusty shouted into the radio. \"We're okay.\" Mom said. \"Did you see that explosion?\" He asked excitedly. \"We saw it.\" She said humorlessly. \"That was awesome!\" Mel giggled, and I looked at her shaking my head. \"You've been hanging around the guys for too long and around Noah too much. But true that was awesome\" She glared at me but then smirked at me. \"This one, she's still moving northeast on 80, you copy?\" Rabbit said. \"This is it.\" Dad said \"Last one.\" Mom smiled a little but I could tell she was sad. \"Last Time.\" I finished. \"They have to be there somewhere.\" Dad said talking about Jonas' crew. \"They have position. They could make it.\" \"Not unless they anchored the pack.\" I said. Mom said into the radio, getting on the same frequency as Jonas. \"Jonas? This is Jo. Can you hear me?\" \"Not now, Harding.\" Mom smiled a bit about having the same last name as Dad before the divorce. \"Jonas, listen to me. The pack is too light, the twister will toss it before it reaches the core, you'll have to anchor it.\" \"Oh, sharing valuable information, Jo? I'll consider that, thank you.\" I rolled my eyes. \"Jonas, what's your position?\" Dad said into the radio to Jonas. \"Oh, howdy, Bill. We are heading northeast running parallel and about to pull ahead of it on the left, why?\" \"Hang back a minute; we've got a pretty good view from back here. She could shift her track, and if she does, she's gonna come right at you! D'you copy?\" Dad was being nice. He never wanted anyone to die, no matter if he hated them or not. He was right though. If it did shift, Jonas' team would die or be severely injured. \"Jonas, listen to me. This is not-\" \"Get off this frequency, Bill!\" Then, Jonas switched off his radio. \"She's shifting.\" Mel said slowly. It was heading right toward Jonas' team. \"Oh my God. Jonas, I'm telling you…. Eddie, I know you can hear me! Turn around now! Get out of there!\" Bill yelled into the radio. The tornado shifts direction and spins over Jonas' crew. We watch as the black Windstars fly through the air. Suddenly a radio tower slams through the windshield, killing Eddie and Jonas. We watches Jonas' car crash and explode. Mom flinches at this and Mel covered her eyes. In a fit of rage, Dad throws down the radio mic. \"Damn it! Stupid.\" \"We tried. There's nothing we could do.\" Mom told him. And she was right. Jonas got him and his own team killed. \"Bill, Jo, ground speed is increasing. Get ahead of it as fast as you can or she's gonna bury ya!\" Beltzer screams into the radio. \"Debris! DUSTY, WE HAVE DEBRIS!\" Mom shouts as debris flies past the truck. The debris consists of cars, tractors, road signs. It's falling everywhere. Mom directs Dad as it all falls around them. \"RIGHT!\" \"LEFT!\" \"RIGHT!\" \"LEFT!\" Suddenly a house comes rolling along and stops on the road. \"Oh my God.\" I said without thinking. \"I think we're goin' in!\" Dad states. \"AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH HHHH!\" Mom screamed. \"Maybe we should get off of this road.\" He says after we went through the house. \"I think you may be right.\" She said breathless. \"We're goin' in.\" Dad states. \"You ready?\" He says to Mel. She nods. Carefully, she opens the back window of the truck and crawls through. DOROTHY # 4 is loaded up in the back; quickly she switches it on and crawls back inside. \"She's up.\" I told them. Mom looked out her window and I climbed over the seat to sit in the middle of them and Mel moved over to the door in the back seat. \"You ready?\" Mom asks Dad. \"Yeah. Let me just set the cruise control. Okay we're good.\" \"On three?\" Mom asks. \"On three. Go.\" They open the doors and stand, the truck is still going 50. \"One.\" Dad says. \"Two.\" Mom says after him. Then, I shout, \"Three!\" Once they jumped out, I jumped out the passenger seat and landed beside mom and Mel landed by Dad. We stand up and watch the truck continue into the twister. As the truck and Dorothy are lifted up into the twister, and the sensors fly up into the air, we hear the haunting sound of the wind chimes. We all get in a group hug. \"Oh no! RUN!\" Dad shouts. The tornado shifts and starts coming toward us. We ran as fast as possible which meant: Us in front, Dad behind me, running while holding Mom's hand. \"The barn, common'! Look out!\" We run to the barn. Fence boards slam and stick in the barn walls. They get inside. Sickles, knives, and saws hang from the ceiling. \"Stay down!\" Dad warned us. \"Who are these people?!\" Mel asked. \"I don't think so! Common'! Let's get out quick!\" We run out of the barn, and then duck as the roof of the barn flies over their heads. \"Oh my God! Common''! Run for it!\" Dad shouted. If everyone keeps shouting, my ears are going to start bleeding. We continue to run until they get to pump house. The door to the pump house won't open. \"COME ON!\" He finally opens it. As we got inside, a piece of a roof flies past Mom. She screams. They go inside. The well is a \"U\" shaped pipe coming up out of the ground. \"Here! These pipes go down at least 30 feet. We anchor to 'em, we might have a chance!\" \"Bill!\" Mom said. He grabs a rawhide strap, ties it first around them, then loops it on to the pipes. \"Hold on!\" The tornado looms overhead; we were lifted up in the air, however still attached to the pipes. Then, I get a major flashback. I ran through the hallways of Nana's house. Erik had just told me that daddy left because of me. Tears ran down my face. He was my best friend. He was supposed to be nice and caring but no! He had to blame me! ' The reason that daddy left was because you and Melanie were born! I remembered him yelling at me. Nana found me and was scared. \" Get Erik and Melanie. Hurry!\" She pushed me toward the room he was staying in. Mommy sent us to her Mommy for the summer. Auntie Meg was sick so she couldn't watch us. I almost decided to get Erik from his room but then I remembered what he said to me. So, I ran downstairs away from him and towards Nana and Melanie had gone to the bathroom and followed me as I ran questioning about Erik. \" Where's Erik?\" She asked me once we got down there. \" He decided not to come.\" I lied to her. She took our hands and ran into the basement. \" Stay here. I'll be right back.\" But she never came back. Neither did Erik. I went upstairs and saw something dark and moving. It was really big and was heading toward us, Melanie grabbed my hand. Before we could move, we were in the air. Something kept slamming into us. I couldn't breathe. Finally, we were let down. My whole body was hurting. Strange people came up to us and questioned us. I saw two bodies being moved out of the house. Nana and Erik. We were looking at the inside of the tornado. It looked amazing! Lightning circles around the light, which was at the top of the twister. It suddenly goes away and we are now under the pipes. Everything was silent for a while. \"That was fun. Let's do it again.\" I said, jokingly. Mom cracked a smile and Dad chuckled. \"You all right?\" Mom asked Dad, already forgetting me. When the team comes up I walked over to them, as we watched my parents talk. Not argue, but talk. He nods. \"Wow, look at that. It didn't take the house.\" \"We did it.\" She said amazed. \"Yeah, we did. Dorothy really flew.\" \"It was a good idea.\" \"Yeah, well I...\" \"We've got so much to do.\" Mom said. \"Yeah.\" \"I've got to get grant approvals for a new warning system, we need a bigger lab, you've got to do an analysis of all that data...\" \"I do?\" Dad asked. \"Yeah, we've got to generate models out of all this data; and I need to run the lab-\" \"Oh, no, no, no. You're doing the analysis, I'm running the lab.\" It amazed me that they didn't realize we were watching and listening to their talk. \"You're running the lab? I don't think so!\" Mom said like he was insane. \"I'm running the lab! G- Do you always have to do things the hard way?\" When Dad said this, we walked over to them. \"You got it guys, the sensors worked! The computers went crazy; we've got data coming out of our ears!\" Haynes stated, smiling. Beltzer had his arm around her. \"Biggest twister ever recorded!\" He said. \"Awesome, man!\" Dusty said. Daniel laughed at him and hugged me from behind, he was an intern that was tagging along for the summer. \"Hey, Jo, Bill, check out that sky!\" Sanders yelled. I felt Daniel rest his head on my shoulder. The sky is clear. \"You know what; I think we've seen enough!\" Mom says. Dad smiles at her and leans and kisses her. I feel Daniel kiss my neck, and I twist around in his arms to kiss him properly. Unknowing to everyone except Mel, I had liked him from beginning of summer and here I am, have him. Everything's good. The End AN: Wow, the end! That took awhile! Well, any Harry Potter fans. Will want to stay tuned for the new Fanfic Series I'm starting, Defying Destiny .

I really hated how Eric wasn't in the second movie at all, and to top it off her dumped her – over the phone! So this is a story, with Eric, called Miss Congeniality 3 Chapter 1 As Grace walked away from Pricilla's school she couldn't help but think: I wonder what Eric is doing right this second. As if on cue her cell phone buzzed, with a text message from Fuller. It read \" Gracie, we need u back at da big HQ pronto! McD Wants 2 tak 2 u!\" Agent Hart quickly texted Fuller back saying \" Keep ur hat on, im goin 2 SB getin da usual b there in 20 min \" Grace, got into her car as quickly as she possibly could, she needed to get to Starbucks pick up everyone's usual. She knew she could make it if she put on her red flashing light. As soon as Grace pulled out of her spot her onstar phone (hands-free dialing in the car [FBI agents don't want to break the law!]) \"Hello?\" Grace said as she pulled onto the road. \"Hart, this is McDonald. I need to talk to you about a few things can you make it back to the office in five?\" \"Uh…sir, I'm on a coffee run.\" \"Great!\" He said into the phone. \"Does anyone want anything at Starbucks? Gracie's makin' a trip.\" McDonald shouted to his department. \"Gracie?\" \"Yeah, I mean yes sir?\" \"The usual.\" \"Alright, I'll be there in 'bout 20.\" \"Great, then come to my office.\" \"Ten four sir, bye.\" Great! Now I'm gonna get fired if I don't get the usual to the HQ in 20. Grace thought. Once Grace was three feet from the door, she saw her crew emerge from the doors: Fuller, Vic – whom she just got in touch with, and is now in training to be an important FBI stylist -, and Joel. \"Okay, here we go, iced venti Passion Tea, for Fuller, and two hot chocolates with wip and sprinkles for Vic and Joel.\" Grace said. \"Great, Princess, the MD has some big news for you!\" Vic said. \"Yes! And I think you'll handle it greatly.\" Fuller added. \"Come on! She only had 2 minutes to get that coffee to the boss! And by the way, someone is about to become very happy!\" Joel said as he shuffled the group inside. \"Sir? You wanted to see me?\" Grace asked as she opened the door. McDonald was doing a computer conference, talking with – who Gracie was guessing – the head man. McDonald held up a finger. \"Great, we'll be pleased to see him again! But may I ask why you are giving him away?\" \"He has messed up superbly on a huge mission. He was instructed not to talk and he charmed the suspect out of murdering an agent, but wounding me.\" The voice did not sound happy. Grace wondered who the agent would be. \"Alright well, we'll expect to see him working in out mitts in three days.\" McDonald said as he clicked off the video cam. \"Hart. We have a lot of things to discuss.\" \"I hope they're good things, Sir.\" \"Oh, don't worry they are; Grace I need to ask you a question. If you could run this whole department, as a partner, what would you do?\" \"I would do the best I can to follow in your footsteps maybe doing more investigating, why?\" \"You're the new assistant boss, Grace. Or now on your command people will call you sub- boss Grace.\"[Chapter 2] Chapter 2 \"Sir are you sure? I mean I though you thought I was a screw up?\" Grace said. \"Hart, I want you as my partner, you'll get a raise in a salary, and be my first associate. You'll still be able to go on missions, but you'll also be able to concoct them, and run them.\" McDonald said. \"I'd love to Sir-\" \"You can call me Harry or McDonald now.\" \"Thank you so much Harry! I really appreciate.\" \"No problem, now I know you applied for an employee talent show.\" \"Yes?\" \"It passed with flying colors it will be Saturday night. So out new friend will be just arriving to see it.\" \"If I may, McDonald, who is this 'new friend'?\" \"If I told you it wouldn't be a surprise, would it?\" \"No Sir, but I really would like to know.\" \"That just so happens to be something I won't tell you. But I can tell you he's going to be your assistant.\" \"I have two questions, what about Fuller? And can Cheryl come to the talent show, with all the girls? It's for my talent.\" \"Fuller is now going to take your old place, and as long as all the pageant ladies have background checks ect. They may attend.\" \"Great, I have some calls to make, and um is there any assignment you need me to work on?\" \"No, Gracie, you have these next three days practically to yourself, but you need to come into the office, who knows what we'll dig up.\" \"Alright if you need anything I'll be in my office.\" \"That reminds me, You're getting a newer bigger office, Fuller can have your old one. The new office will have a desk for your new assistant. You can start moving as soon as you wish.\" \"Thank you Sir.\" As soon as Gracie got out she told her friends what had happened. They started to move her things into the new office on the top floor; everyone grabbed all they could and halled it into the elevator. Grace was the first to get to her new office, and the view was breathtaking. \"You have some calls to make, don't you?\" Vic said as he put a potted plant on the ground. \"Yeah I kind of do.\" Grace said. \"Go ahead, we'll finish lugging all this stuff.\" Joel said with joy. \"Thanks guys, I gatta call Cheryl and the other girls to get an act ready.\" Grace added. \"You don't have a routine? Well Vic and I'll create one for you – it'll be ready tomorrow morning ready for practice!\" Joel said as Fuller entered the room. \"Wow, fancy, smancy!\" She said. \"I'm not doing the 'dance' thing.\" \"Oh please fuller it'll be fun!\" Gracie pleaded. \"Alright, but you better cut me some slack with the boss.\" \"Deal!\" Gracie and Fuller shock hands. \"You know Sam, I was just about to call Cheryl, so would you want to help me convince her as we design my office?\" \"If you'll have me.\" Fuller joked. \"We'll be back with more stuff Gracie!\" Vic said as they exited. Once the boys were gone, Grace grabbed the phone and dialed Cheryl's number; she put the phone on speaker. \"Hello?\" Cheryl's voice sounded a little confussed. \"Hey, Cher, it's Gracie.\" Grace said. \"Oh Gracie!\" Her voice piped up. \"I didn't know it was you. I mean the phone said it was the FBI not BFFLE Gracie.\" \"That's part of the news! I got a new office!\" \"O-mi-gosh! Really!\" \"Yes, really, and I got a new office, phone, and I'm getting an assistant!\" \"Mmm?\" Sam said, as if she said it directly, Grace knew what 'Mmm' ment. \"So anyway remember how you were like 'Grace you should have a talent show!' well McDonald said yes. And that you and the rest of the girls could come and be in it!\" \"Really?!\" \"Really!!\" \"That's fantastic! When is it? When does training start? I'll call the other girls for you, I mean I know you have so much work and you're probably so busy already with FBI stuff, and moving into the office.\" \"Well, Sam's, and my crew are helping me with the office, but I have no FBI stuff. McDonald wanted me to get the talent show ready.\" \"Ohh, that's great now you can work on making the dance!\" \"Actually Joel and Vic are working on that.\" \"That's good, well what are you gonna do?\" \"Get signs saying 'Talents Show'\" \"That's great Gracie. So umm, have you met any guys?\" \"What? Cheryl!\" \"Well you can't be mad at me for being curious. I mean Grace, you need a man! I thought you and Eric were way cute together!\" \"Two problems with that, one he broke up with her, and he's in Miami.\" Fuller said for the first time. \"Ohh, was that you Sam? Hi!\" Cheryl responded. \"Hi.\" Sam greeted Cheryl on the phone. \"Ladies we're back!\" Joel said. \"And we have more stuff – Grace you still have a picture of Mathews?\" Vic asked as he went through a box. \"Ohh, see I was right you do like him.\" Cheryl said. \"Oh Cheryl, it's a pleasure to hear you again!\" Vic said. \"And you Vic, hey Joel.\" \"My pleasure dear, oh, don't worry we have the talent show dance on our plate! We'll be happy to do your make up too!\" Joel said. \"That's great guys, but for now can we please stick to helping Gracie set her office up?\" Grace asked the bunch. They all agreed. Eventually the girls hung up. Cheryl said she's call all the pageant girls and get them to come tomorrow to learn the dance. And to be there precisely at noon. Cheryl said she'd come at nine to catch up. They made arrangements for the girls to stay at a lovely Hyatt. Except Cheryl who'd room with Gracie of course. Once her office was set up, and everyone else had left, Gracie got her lovely pink coat and grabbed her purse, and pulled out onto the highway. It was a 15 minute ride home, but that was long enough for Gracie to get very tired. Once she was home she threw herself on her bed and feel asleep.[Chapter 3] Chapter 3 There was a knock on the door. \"Oh my god, Cheryl! What time is it? Does it matter?\" Gracie mumbled as she threw on a bathrobe and walked to the door. \"Hi!\" Cheryl said. \"HI, come on in.\" Gracie said as she noticed Cheryl had three big suitcases of lord knows what. \"Let me get some of those.\" \"Thanks, well Gracie, I'm so excited to work with you again! No offence but you look horrible.\" \"I just woke up.\" \"Why, shouldn't you be up? I thought you had to work.\" \"Crap, crap, crap,crap, I don't mean to be rude, but would you come to the office with me?\" Grace almost begged. \"I'd love to, I can help, and there must be a room we can practice.\" \"There is.\" \"Great, and we can pick out fits and make up with Vic and Joel!\" \"You can do that, or help me with posters.\" Gracie said. \"I'll help you first.\" In ten minutes Grace was ready and Cheryl, well, she got her luggage to her room. \"Come on Cher! I have to get there on time!\" Grace said. \"Alright! Oh, nice Stilettos!\" \"Right back at cha!\" Grace said as she reached for her red light. Five seconds later the girls were on the road headed for a Starbucks. \"Come on Cher I need your help holding all the stuff.\"Grace said. \"What the heck lady?! You almost ran into me!\" A man walked up to her. Gracie didn't panic, she simply flashed her badge and said \"FBI official business, you might want to stay out of this Sir.\" Once they were in the Starbucks line, Grace started pushing people aside and said things like \"Excuse me\" \"Aside Sir.\" \"'Ma'am FBI business\" \"It's a good idea to stay out of this business Sir\" Once Grace was at the counter she ordered the usual plus an extra venti Passion Tea Lemonade for Cheryl. The girls grabbed all the drinks and muffins and ran back to Grace's car. Then they sped away to the HQ. When Grace's car skidded to a stop she jumped out with Cheryl on her heals. \"Hey Greg, I need a badge for Miss. USA, please.\" Grace said to the security guard. \"May I see your ID, Miss Frasier ?\" Greg asked. \"Sure, um hang on a minute.\" Cheryl said as she dug around in her purse for her wallet, \"Here, I just had it redone with my crown on!\" \"Oooo, I don't care, I just need the ID to make you a day pass.\" Greg grumbled. \"She's going to b here until Saturday.\" Grace piped in. \"Yes, and I'm going to need to get in to help Grace.\" \"Alright, to use your pass, just swipe it in the FBI card swipper and you'll need Grace to type in the password.\" Greg said with no enthusiasm. As the girls were walking toward the building, they talked about anything and everything. \"So, how do you like being head person guy, of the FBI?\" Cheryl asked. \"I think I like it, I mean I've only know about it for like 14 hours. But it sounds great, plus I'm getting an assistant!\" \"Ohh, right and the assistant is a boy,\" Cheryl said. \"I know you want him to be someone cute!\" \"Stop, I am not. I'm just hoping he'll be a worthy enough FBI person.\" Grace said as Cheryl gave her a 'come on you know I'm right' look. \"Oh, alright, I hope he's cute too.\" \"That's what I thought you said.\" Cheryl said as Grace tapped in the code. Vic was waiting for Grace and Cheryl at the door. \"Hello ladies!\" Vic said as they entered the lobby. \"Morning Vic,\" Gracie said, \"when are you and Joel gonna be done with the dance?\" \"As a matter of fact, we're done. We just want your approval.\" \"What about costumes, Vic?\" Cheryl asked. \"Joel has started to work on them, while I finished Gracie's office.\" \"Oh, that's right I have to see your new office Gracie!\" \"Sure, why not. Are Fuller and Joel there, Vic?\" Grace asked. \"Yes, Fuller has decided to rearrange my rearranging, and Joel was still working on the costume.\" \"Okay, let's go.\" Gracie ushered everyone into the elevator. On the top floor they all got off and when to the last office door on the right. Cheryl was so excited to be in an FBI building she kept asking all sorts of questions about equipment. Grace was ready to blow her top with all the questions when Vic said \"We're here.\" \"Oh Gracie, it's lovely, so open and big. I love the golden curtains, and maple wood desk. Your team definitely did a great job decorating!\" \"Thanks, you can sit here and work on the costume with Joel, who is somewhere.\" Grace said, just as Joel popped up from the desk – that would eventually become Gracie's assistants. \"Present, Miss. Cheryl, an honor to see you again. Shall we get started on the costume?\" Joel asked. \"Umm, I was going to help Gracie with the flyers.\" \"Go ahead Cher, Vic and Fuller can help me.\" Grace said. \"Well, okay.\" Cheryl agreed. \"Okay, honey, so what I was thinking something flapperish, you know, because of the song.\" Joel said as he chewed a piece of what smelled like peppermint gum. \"Alright, and since Gracie is kinda the leader we'll give her the head outfit, and everyone else can have something else. I was thinking black and gold horizontal strips – you know the kind flapper costumes have flappy stuff like that – for Gracie. The rest of us can wear just black or gold.\" \"That's nice Hon! I was just thinking if we make it short we'll need to add undies, like cheerleaders.\" \"Yes, we will, and Gracie was planning to do some kicks.\" \"She was?\" \"No, but I'll make her.\" \"Not sure if that'll work, but give it a try.\" \"Alright, can you make like 25 of the gold, 25 of the black, and 1 black and gold, by Saturday night?\" \"Of course, dahling. I'll have Vic's help.\" \"Great, I'm going to go help Gracie, now.\" \"Phew, who could he be? I've checked all the info I have access to, which is all of it, and I still can't find him.\" Gracie said as Cheryl walked over to her. \"Sounds like someone is pretty interested in who her assistant is?\" \"Maybe your right, I'm wicked excited.\" \"I know, but we have to focus on getting the talent show up.\" \"You're right, here's what Vic and I did, before you came over.\" Come one come all! To a fun-filled night, of FBI acts. Everyone's invited to showcase a special talent Our special guests include: Gracie Hart – FBI/Runner up for Miss USA, Cheryl Frasier – Miss USA, Sam Fuller – Hart's assistant, and The rest of the USA pageant girls. (PS They're all preforrming) Come to the Auditorium in the FBI building on Saturday at 8 pm We hope to see you there Grace Hart Vic Melling Cheryl Frasier Joel Collins \"Do you like it?\" Grace asked Cheryl. \"It's great, now we just have to distribute these.\" \"We have to leave in one hour to get the girls form JFK.\" \"Ok, so let's print these and get a move on things!\" \"Alright I'll print a hundred, then we can put a few in very department.\" \"Great, then we can work on the dance, Joel and Vic have the costumes under control.\" \"That's, well at least I know I'll look good!\" Gracie joked. \"Honey, you'll look good in a paper bag, as long as you groom yourself.\" Cheryl added with a smile. \"It'll be fun!\" \"Yeah, we get to see all the girls again, that's good, right?\" \"Yeah, it'll be great to see them again!\" \"You know, I'll know who my new assistant is once the talent show is over. McDonald said he'll be here by then. I wonder if he knows I'm going to be his boss.\" Grace said as she lead Cheryl toward the printer. \"Either way Grace, he's going to love you, who doesn't? I love you – in a BFF way.\" \"Oh, that's so sweet Cheryl.\" \"McDonald, Sir, we have the posters, would you like one?\" Grace asked McDonald, they were handing out all the flyers. \"I'd love one, thank you. Oh Gracie, as soon as this talent show thing, is over, we need you on another assignment, with your assistant.\" McDonald said. \"What?! I thought my new assistant wasn't able to go on missions because he disobeyed his boss.\" \"Well yes, but he's great at being on an active mission.\" \"I'll just have to wip him back into shape?\" \"That's what I'm hoping you'll do.\" \"Alright thank you Sir, see you later.\"[Chapter 4] Chapter 4 \"Come on, once more!\" Joel said. If you looked around you'd see Gracie hanging onto the ballet bar grasping for air, Cheryl looking tired and sweaty, and Fuller on the floor looking near death. Gracie, in her tank top, exercise bra, short shorts, Jazz sneakers, and sweat bands, walked over to Joel and pointed her finger at him. \"You can't keep us here! We're tired, hunger, and\" Gracie said glancing at the clock, \"late! Girls we need to go we were suppose to leave ten minutes ago!\" \"Oh, you're right, we're late.\" Cheryl said as she walked toward the locker room. \"I'm going to get changed.\" \"That's a good idea, I can't be all sweaty when we go out.\" Fuller agreed. \"Hey, do we have time to take a shower Gracie?\" Cheryl asked. \"No, we need to leave, just get changed! I'll make sure the bus is ready!\" Grace said as she walked to the door. \"Grace Hart! You will not leave this room unless it's to the changing room! I'll go.\" Joel suggested. \"Fine, just make sure it's the right bus, and uh\" Gracie said as she looked thorough her purse \"here's the conformation.\" \"I got this one honey, go, go!\" All three girls were changing into nicer cloths than they would normally wear, in honor of seeing their old friend again. Fuller pulled on a nice navy blue sweater and some black dress pants. Cheryl got a tube top and mini jean skirt, with purple stilettos. And Gracie grabbed a burgundy halter top, dark mini jean skirt, and black stilettos. Once all the girls were fully dressed they headed out toward the bus, where Joel and Vic stood. \"See you soon girls.\" Vi said. \"Yes, you will, and we'll need you to be ready with all the dress size charts and the dance needs to be ready!\" Grace said as she hoped on the bus. \"See you soon!\" Cheryl said. When she was safely on the bus Fuller said \"Now, why is she always preppy?\" \"Alright, Mr. Bus driver, we need to be at JFK in forty minutes, can you handle that?\" Grace asked as the bus pulled out of the FBI parking lot. \"I'll be able to get you there in 35.\" The bus driver said. \"Ok, Cheryl, you're sure all the girls are coming?\" Grace asked as they got on the highway. \"Yeah, all were going to get there at twelve! Leslie and Mary Jo can't wait to see you!\" \"And I'll be in Barbie town!\" Fuller complained. \"Not necessarily, there won't be much time for socializing, we're working on the dance.\" Grace said. \"I'm just glad I'm not the one who's singing!\" \"Oh, yes, did you see the costumes, they really match the songs.\" Cheryl asked. \"No, but it can't be much shorter than my Tina Turner costume.\" Fuller commented. Gracie was too busy thinking about all the things that had to get done. I have to get all those girls to the FBI HQ and make sure they all have their IDs. I have to memorize the dance – ugh – I'm not really good at dancing, but I'm not terrible. I really wonder who my new assistant will be. I'll have a new mission; hopefully all the people who admire me won't notice me. I really can't wait to get back on the force as a person who's in the action. I'll probably be the one who will get everything set up, that will be so cool! It would be just like Eric, when he – well when he was the master behind the Miss USA pageant. I wonder what he's doing this very second. The girls were listening to Gracie's ipod when the bus driver said \"Girls we're five minutes from the airport, where should I park?\" \"Good question! Um Cheryl where did you tell the girls to meet us?\" Gracie asked. \"At whatever plane they…come…from…oh I probably should have said the baggage claim.\" She said apologetically. \"That's ok, I have all their numbers on my cell, Sam call Alabama through Louisiana, Cheryl call Maine through Oregon, and I'll call Pennsylvania through Wyoming. See what Terminal they'll be coming from; also tell them that we'll be stopping at one first and so on.\" Once all the calls had been made the tree girls were heading to terminal two, due to the fact that all the flights in terminal one were out of the country. Grace led the way grabbing her FBI badge to let her through security. They would be meeting Nina(AL), Leslie(CA), Melanie(CO), Katie(FL), Jade(IL), Jenna(KS), Claire(MI), Beth(NE), Sandra(MO), and Ally(NH), at the baggage claim. It was ten of twelve, so Fuller decided to get them all some coffee from the Starbucks stand. \"Gracie, you were so quiet on the bus, why was that?\"Cheryl asked, concerned for her Bestie. \"I was deep in thought.\" Was all Gracie could answer without giving a smile. \"Why? Oh, I think I know, you're thinking about Eric, weren't you?\" \"No, I was just wondering what he was doing.\" \"Oh, Gracie, same thing! You really need to get a man in your life, it'll make you feel happier!\" \"You're just saying that because you're will Jeff. How is he?\" \"He's great, you know we've only been dating for a week but, it's great.\" \"Here, one venti Caramel Macchiato, grande light blended coffee cream frappuccino, and tall steamed milk with vanilla.\" \"Thanks Sam.\" Cheryl said. Gracie just stared out the window, thinking Cheryl got Eric's drink, he's always ask me to pick one up on my way to work. \"Look, it's twelve, we should head to the baggage claim.\" Gracie suggested. \"Alright, why don't we go right after we finish to give them a chance to get their luggage.\" Cheryl said. \"Ok, fine we'll head there in ten minutes, kay?\" The girls shook their head. Ten minutes later the girls were heading toward the baggage claim. Gracie had finished her drink and really had to go to the bathroom now. So once the girls positioned themselves at a place where everyone, who walked past them would see them, Gracie darted off toward the bathroom. \"The planes that have arrived are: 1957 from Alabama, 235 form California, 2356 from Colorado, 7789 from Florida, 5984 from Illinois, 165 from Kansas, 7145 from Michigan, and 523 from Missouri. Once the people started coming, the girls could make out Katie, and someone they truly didn't expect.[Chapter 5] Authors Note: Hi everyone, I just wanted to say thanks for reading. I haven't had much time to update, so the chapters aren't very long but I'll try harder to make them longer. Thnx ~ kk-writing-diva1 Chapter 5 \"Oh my god! Katie! Over here, come here!\" Cheryl said as she waved her hands like crazy. \"Oh, Cheryl!\" Katie said as she hurried over to Cheryl leaving the man at her side. \"I missed you so much!\" Cheryl cried. \"What is he doing here?\" Cheryl referred to the man. \"Oh, him? He's with the FBI, and he's protecting me from danger. There have been a few scary messages, I can't talk about them. It's too worrisome for me. You'll have to ask him if you want to know.\" \"Hello, Miss United States, it's a pleasure to see you again.\" The man, who was protecting Katie, said. \"Eric Matthews? You're here, for good?\" Cheryl asked. \"Oh, so this is the Eric Matthews that dumped Gracie, over the phone, ten minutes before their date?\" Fuller asked as she cracked her knuckles. \"Yeah, well, kind of.\" Eric said as he stood behind Katie. \"You're gonna get it.\" Sam said as she stepped forward. \"No, Sam, I'm not done talking to him. Well, are you leaving?\" Cheryl asked. \"Yes, I'm heading back to Miami, she'll be with the FBI, and Hart. Hart wouldn't let me down.\" \"Unlike you let her down.\" Fuller said. \"Well, if she had just listened to my side of the story she would know what happened.\" Eric defended himself. \"Well, then tell us, pretty boy.\" Sam said. \"Love to, but I can't, my plane is suppose to take off in five minutes. Great seeing you again Miss Frasier; nice to meet you Sam.\" Eric said as he walked away. \"We won't tell Gracie about seeing him, promise girls?\" Cheryl said, knowing Gracie had been thinking about him a lot lately. All the girls shook their head in unison. \"Hey, guys, oh Katie!\" Grace said as she walked up the group. \"How was your flight?\" \"Smooth, um, the FBI in Miami,\" Grace Immediately thought of Eric and her new advisor, \"told me to tell you that someone has been sending threats to me, they think because I'm entering a modeling/ Miss World pageant, so I need to have someone, FBI-ey to watch me the whole time.\" Katie got out in under 30 seconds. \"Okay, that's fine, Fuller can stay with you in the bus when we get the other girls.\" Grace said. \"I'll have you talk with McDonald when we get back to the HQ.\" When all the girls were accounted for they all headed back to the bus talking about everything they missed. All of them agreed the outfits Cheryl described would be hot, and thought Gracie would be a great star with the dance and song. They were very excited to find out about Gracie's promotion, and Cheryl's dating – for a week. Katie's threats, were a bit scary – as she said – but they all thought she was very brave to go to the FBI. Another thing Gracie found interesting was that half the girls were going into that pageant. After five stops at five different terminals they had all the girls. \"Mr. Bus Driver?\" Cheryl asked. \"Yes?\" He said.\" \"We're ready to go back to the FBI HQ.\" \"Alright, Miss.\" About thirty minutes later, the girls had their ID's out and were organized by state, to get their new FBI passes. All the girls were super excited to see inside of an FBI building. While Cheryl and Fuller took the pageant girls to the dance room to get fitted, Gracie took Katie to see McDonald. \"Excuse me, McDonald?\" Gracie asked as she opened his office door, and poked her head in. \"Yes Hart? What is it, something go wrong with your girls?\" He asked sarcastically. \"I was talking to Katie Miller, Miss Florida, and she told the Miami FBI she was getting threatening letters. She suspects it was from someone in her next pageant – a modeling/Miss World. \"Miss World? I thought only Miss United States could go to that?\" \"That's right, but this is something like a modeling pageant for Miss World, once they figure out who the Model is she will get to go to the Miss World pageant. She'll be going as one of the girls who give tips, and…other stuff.\" \"It seems you really know what you're talking about, Hart!\" \"Sir, I'm not an expert, Katie just told me a bit of info.\" \"Yes, I see. Well I see that we'll have to take care of her. Seeing you handle your last assignment, so well, I'll give you her as your next assignment. It'll start as soon as you walk out this door. I'll have someone do some research on those notes, and contact the FBI in Miami, as well as our new employee. I think you should get a group together once this 'talent show' is over.\" \"Yes, of course…Sir, if you're done, I think I'll go protect Katie now.\" \"Don't forget to keep her safe at all coasts.\" McDonald said as Grace backed away from the door. \"I will thank you Sir.\" Gracie said as she headed toward the gym – the place Cheryl, Katie and the rest of the girls would be getting their sizes measured. When Gracie got down toward the gym, there were FBI guys everywhere, looking like they had just been in a fight and were 'resting'. The girls were getting measured in the dressing room, most likely by Joel. While girls were heading in, other girls were putting on tight cammies so the measuring would be accurate. Grace could tell the girls were lining up by state, considering Alabama through Hawaii were getting their own cloths back on and handing that cammy to the next girl in line. As Grace walked up to Katie she tried to shoe the other agents out of the gym so the girls could have their privacy. \"Katie,\" Gracie said as soon as they were in five feet of each other, \"you're sleepin' at my house with Cheryl.\" \"Oh goddie! Sleepover!\" Katie squealed as she handed her cammy to Miss Maine – Kristen. Then she went to go find Cheryl to tell her the great news. Since Gracie and Cheryl were already measured, they didn't have to worry about the long wait. While Katie was finding Cheryl Gracie went to find Fuller. Gracie finally found fuller getting changed into her workout outfit. \"Hey.\" Gracie started. \"Hey.\" Fuller said flatly. \"Oh, what's wrong? Do you want to talk about it?\" Grace asked just as Fuller was getting up. \"Nothing.\" Jeeze! Guess Sam's not in the mood to talk. Gracie thought. \"Well, are you ok?\" Grace asked again. \"It 's not really your scene, is it?\" \"Not really.\" \"Well, you don't have to do it if you don't want.\" \"You aren't yourself, look at what you're wearing.\" Sam pointed to Gracie's light blue off the shoulder tee-shirt. \"Oh, come on, I'm still me. I just dress better.\" \"If you say so, but I'm watching you.\" \"You're kidding right?\" Gracie asked with a slightly scared face. \"Yeah, but just remember, I'm gonna kick you crazy if you change too much.\" \"That's great!\" \"Once I learn the dance I'm heading back to the office ok? Or will you need help with the cattle.\" Sam referred to the pageant ladies. \"You can leave, I mean I know you have a lot of work to do with your big promotion too.\" \"That will be a challenge.\" Sam said then she hurried off to help Joel so the girls could finish faster. Once all the fits were done, Vic and Joel started to teach the girls their dance. They would replay and replay and replay the song over and over. The girls had to make it perfect. They were used this kind of treatment – which was good. After four hours of non-stop training, five water breaks, and two bathroom breaks, the girls had mastered the routine. So Grace had got the girls rental cars – to share – (she's not made of money) and she showed them how to get to their hotel. Once all the girls were accommodated, she Cheryl and Katie went back to her house. \"Wow, long day!\" Cheryl said as she stepped into Gracie's house and fell on the couch. \"Oh, I know, where can I put my stuff?\" Katie asked holding one pink duffle bag and two large hot pink suitcases. Gracie was holding her missing Vera Bradley Pink floral suitcase. \"Come I'll show you to your room.\" Grace said as she headed upstairs. All the girls were settled in – finally – at 6:43, now it was time to eat. \"Alright what do you guys want to eat? I have Angel Hair Marinara, Broccoli and Cheddar Roasted Potatoes, Chicken Enchiladas Monetary, Chicken Fettuccini, Chicken Marcela with Broccoli, Chicken Parmesan, Dragon Shrimp Lo Mein, Four Cheese Pizza, Lemon Herb Chicken Piccata, Macaroni and Cheese, and Ravioli Florentine. \" Gracie listed. \"Uh, no offence Gracie, but I think you've had enough microwave dinners.\" Cheryl said as she walked around her kitchen looking for something fresh to make. \"If you're looking for something, you won't find anything.\" Gracie saved her the trouble. Katie walked in and sat on a stool by the kitchen counter. \"Why don't we order out? Any good Chinese places around here?\" Katie asked. \"There's a great restaurant called The Peking Duck House , They deliver.\" Gracie said. After ten minutes of looking up their menu, online, they called and ordered. While Gracie got into her pajamas, Katie and Cheryl looked through her movie selection. \"Hmm, she has so many movies, Ghost Rider, Bride Wars, True Lies, Face Off, Labor Pains, The Wedding Date, Legally Blonde, Maid of Honor, The Wedding Planner, A Boyfriend for Christmas, Mama Mia…The Nanny Diaries, The Cutting Edge. Wow, she is loaded.\" Cheryl said as Grace came downstairs, wearing her juicy couture PJs. Her top had kisses and the words \"juicy couture\" all over it. Her bottoms were just pink and red plaid. \"Have you made a selection?\" Gracie asked as she went to her purse, which was sitting on the couch, and took out some money. \"We've each picked one, and you get to pick which one you'd rather watch!\" Cheryl said. \"And while you're picking we'll go get changed! Girlies night is just beginning!\" Katie squealed. As the girls headed upstairs Cheryl handed Gracie two movies: The Wedding Date , and A Boyfriend for Christmas . Great! Gracie thought. They picked lovey dovey movies, well, I do really like them, ok, umm, bubblegum, bubblegum, in a dish….wish? ok I'll go with this one. A few minutes later the girls came back all dolled up. Katie was wearing a velvet crop top with a pair f Capri pants, and Cheryl was wearing a violet short dress. \"So, which movie have you picked?\" Cheryl asked in a British accent. \"I have chosen A Boyfriend for Christmas .\" Gracie said as calmly as she could. \"Yes!\" Katie souted. \"You win Kate.\" Cheryl congratulated just as the doorbell ringed. \"Why don't you put the DVD in and I'll get the food?\" Gracie suggested. \"Coolio.\" Cheryl said as she grabbed the TV, DVD, and Direct TV remotes. \"When is she gonna get a universal remote?\" Katie asked. \"I don't know, but she better, it's getting confusing.\" Cheryl said as she turned on the huge flat screen TV, she pressed a button that made a disk drive pop out and she pushed in the DVD. Once the screen turned blue with the loading bar on it, Grace walked back in carrying two big bags of food. \"Wow, what did we order?\" Cheryl asked. \"I really don't know.\" Grace responded. \"Shall we dig in?\" \"Love to,\" Katie said as she headed toward the kitchen to get forks, spoons, knifes, and plates. \"Get in here the movie's starting!\" Cheryl called as Gracie set up the food on the coffee table. \"I've got the trays.\" \"I'd really love to watch this movie so, whenever you guys want to shut up, and get your 'bo, boes on the couch, I'll it the unpause button.\" Cheryl added. \"Hold your horses, I'm coming, and what's a 'bo,bo'?\" Katie asked. \"It's a butt in Cheryl speak.\" Gracie answered. After five minutes all the girls were seated on the couch watching a great movie , with plenty of fresh Lo Mein, Sushi, dumplings, fried chicken, and plenty more.[Chapter 6] Authors Note: I want to thank everyone who has read my story.

It was the night before the day of the talent show, and Gracie and the pageant girls were finished with the dance. Everyone was bursting at the seams. Once the night was over everyone would go home and get a good night's sleep; in the morning (around 10) Gracie, Cheryl, and Katie would arrive to start the decorations. The rest of the ladies will arrive at noon, and finish up. \"Gracie, are we almost done?\" Cheryl asked as she dropped a stack of papers on Gracie's new Mahogany desk. \"Did you look through all those files?\" Gracie responded with a question. \"Yes, none of them were interesting.\" Cheryl said with bore. They were looking for none other than Gracie's new assistant. Cheryl hadn't found anything to exciting. \"Did you ever think maybe his file isn't in here?\" \"Yeah, but maybe we just missed it.\" Grace said as she shuffled through some papers. \"I doubt it.\" Cheryl said. \"Alright, we can go soon.\" \"Speaking of going, what are we having for dinner tonight?\" Katie asked as she stepped through the doorframe. \"I don't know. What do you want? Pizza?\" Gracie asked. \"We had take out last night, Grace.\" Cheryl piped in. \"Well, why don't you go shopping and cook something?\" Grace challenged. \"I have no problem, I can cook.\" Katie said. \"I'll teach you guys if you want.\" She offered. \"Well, maybe later, but just make us dinner for tonight, okay?\" Grace asked. \"Sure, and I'll make breakfast as well. I'm a morning person!\" Katie cried. \"Well I'm not, way not.\" Grace said. \"I'm both.\" Cheryl cut in. \"What do you want me to make?\" Katie asked. \"Something quick, we have to work on the decorations.\" Grace said as she shut her HP laptop and Computer off. She started to pack the laptop up, and Cheryl came over to help. Katie grabbed their coats on Gracie's new coat rack. \"That's easy, anyone a vegetarian?\" Katie asked, she and Cheryl were already outside. Grace was shutting off the lights and closing her door. \"Alright come on,\" Gracie said as she stuck her goldish key into keyhole and twisted it. \"We still have a ton of work to do.\" As Grace, Cheryl, and Katie passed McDonald's office, on their way to the elevator, he popped his head out. \"Grace, make sure the room will be ready for the play. Alright?\" \"Yes sir, we'll be working all day to set it up.\" Grace answered, as she motioned for the girls to come next to her. \"Ah, Miss Frasier, it is an honor to meet Miss. United States.\" McDonald said as he kissed her hand. \"Miss. Miller, I assure you, you are in the best possible care.\" He said as they shook hands. \"Thank you so much Sir, I am grateful to have Gracie as a watcher person.\" Katie said. \"Enough talk, we'll have plenty time to talk, after your performance at the talent show. Go, you have much work to do.\" McDonald said as he ushered them to the elevator. \"Alright, we'll see you tomorrow, good night.\" Gracie said as she pressed the \"g\" button. \"Come on ladies, bye Rick see you tomorrow, let's go to Whole Foods.\" Gracie said as she led them to her car and said goodbye to Rick. \"Great, I love that store, and then you can help me pick out what we get.\" Katie said as she climbed in the back of Gracie's New Cadillac Escalade Hybrid. Cheryl climbed the shotgun seat. (seat next to driver) Gracie walked around her white pearl car to the right back seat door and strapped her laptop in. Both girls stared at her. \"What?\" She asked as though she hadn't done anything weird. \"I just want to make sure it won't go anywhere.\" \"Sure.\" Cheryl said as she looked in her purse for something. \"Fine, let's go.\" Gracie said as she pressed her GPS on, and tapped on \"my locations\". \"Gracie, turn the car on, I want to put my ipod on.\" Cheryl complained. \"Alright, hang on let me put the key in.\"Gracie said just as the GPS binged. \"Okay, let's get there, and then get out.\" Katie said, \"Then I can make you dinner while you guys set up the diagram of the stage room.\" \"Fine with me, oooh, here's a good song.\" Cheryl said as she tapped her ipod touch. \"What song is this?\" Katie asked as the music started playing. \"Is this Tik Tok? I thought that someone like you wouldn't be listening to something like this.\" \"Well I am, so there.\" Cheryl spit back. After about half an hour of Cheryl's ipod the girls scouted for a parking spot. When they finally achieved their goal, Gracie grabbed her eco-friendly bags out of her trunk, and headed for the door – followed by Katie and Cheryl. Once they were inside Katie grabbed a shopping cart and started browsing the produce. She picked up some strawberries, peaches, plums, watermelon, cantaloupe, honeydew, Santa melon, Cherries, grapes, apples, and Clementine's. Then she got some lettuce, peppers, carrots, broccoli, spinach, Asparagus, beans, celery, corn, cucumbers, Kohlrabi, leeks, mushrooms, onions, potatoes, rhubarb, shallots, and tomatoes. \"Oh my god. How much stuff are you getting Katie? You've already filled up one cart.\" Grace asked. \"Well, you have absolutely nothing at your house, and I've decided to cater the talent show too.\" Katie responded as she picked out an artichoke. \"Here, I got another carriage.\" Cheryl said as she pulled it up next to the other one. \"Great, let's get to the rest of the store, before I go broke.\" Gracie said. Once Katie had gotten to the meat, poultry, fish, sweets, snacks, deli, hot bar, salad bar, pizza kitchen, and miscellaneous sections they headed toward the check out. The final price was so large, but with Gracie's new salary she was able to afford it, no problem. After all that mayhem at Whole Foods Market, the girls grabbed the three carriages, needed to lug all the food, and headed for Gracie's White Pearl Cadillac. \"This stuff is so heavy, Katie. What did you buy?\" Gracie asked \"I don't know if I have enough room in my kitchen for even one of these shopping carts.\" \"Well, I'll find room for it.\" Katie said. \"You better, and you're going to have to do it without my help. I'm working on the room.\" \"Oh, I'll help you!\" Cheryl said. \"Don't we need to go get decorations at a store or something?\" \"Yes, we do. I know exactly where to find them, but let's focus on what we're doing with the room first.\" Grace said as she unloaded the last bag, and turned to bring the shopping cart to a cart return. \"Fine, I have some great ideas!\" Cheryl said as she hopped in the back of the car. \"Yeah! I get shotgun now!\" Katie said as Gracie got in the front seat. \"Alright we're going home, we have a long night ahead of us.\" Grace said as they pulled out of the parking lot. After around half an hour of driving the girls were talking about the different designs they could do with the room they were given. They were all tired from their busy day. Once they got into the room, Cheryl went into 'planning mode'. She got a piece of paper and wrote down all the things they were talking about in the car. Katie got the lugubrious job of bringing in the groceries, and Gracie popped a piece of gum in her mouth and walked to the couch, where Cheryl was lounging. \"Gracie, I have a fantastic idea. Come sit, and look at all these ideas.\" Cheryl said as she patted the spot next to her. \"Now, we want to go for relaxing, and we have that. We were talking white in the car…what do you think of when you think white?\" \"Vanilla?\" Gracie asked. \"No, silly, a Wedding. So I looked up subtle wedding décor, online, and bingo! I got something, lazy looking, in my opinion perfect for a talent show, you know, for adults.\" Cheryl said, proud of herself. \"Alright, looks fine, but maybe that's because I'm tired, we'll go to get the store and get everything. We're leaving my apartment at eight.\" Gracie said as she strolled into the kitchen. \"Gracie, oh look, I'm almost done sorting all this stuff, an dinner will be ready in twenty minutes.\" \"Cool…What happened to my kitchen?\" Grace asked as she looked around at the quite small room. It smelled like the green-works cleaner and some kind of fragrance, Lilac? Fox Glove? Oh well it was floral. \"I did some sprucing up, while you were working, and cleaned all your cabinets. Do you like it?\" Katie asked. She was reading a People magazine on the peninsula. \"Yeah, It's so clean.\" \"Now you can't drive boys away.\" Katie said, she looked up for the first time, and spoted Cheryl scooting her way into the kitchen. \"Hey, it smells divine in here. What is that? Cherry? Roses?\" Cheryl asked as she entered the kitchen. \"It's dinner,\" The girls looked at Katie \"okay, it's Cherry Blossom. Don't you like it? It's puts a great feeling in this room.\" \"Great, I'm going to get ready for bed, and I'm picking to movie this time.\" Gracie said as she walked upstairs. A few minutes later the girls were all in a blanket eating a fast dinner, and watching \"While You Were Sleeping\". All of them were so into the movie they didn't realize their food had become cold. Once the movie was half-way over they had an intermission. All of them scrambled for the bathroom, with Katie making it in first, with Gracie missing it by an inch. Then once Katie was done she went into the kitchen and made them ice-cream Sundays, with all the toppings – to celebrate the fact that they had done everything, except buying the decorations. The girls finished the movie and decided they didn't want to move so they all fell asleep in the couch, crunched into little balls. Each girls curled their blanket under themselves, and crashed. The next thing Gracie knew it was 5:00 AM Sorry I left it at a cliff hanger, I'll try to update more, keep reviewing please[Chapter 7] Chapter 7 Crap! Grace thought to herself. Why, why do I volunteer for everything? She uncovered herself, and slipped on a random pair of jeans and a shirt. She couldn't even see the road when she looked out the window. Grace walked to the kitchen and realized Cheryl and Katie were already up. \"Gracie, you're finally up, we need to get going.\" Cheryl said as she finished up her eggs. \"I didn't want to wake you up, so I just made you some muffins.\" Katie said as she handed Grace a bag off Blueberry muffins. When did she get up this morning? Grace wondered. \"Its fine, I'll deal. Okay girls let's go get the decorations, no wait, Starbucks first.\" Grace said as she picked up her purse and grabbed her keys off the nail in the wall Eric had put in for her. \"G, wait I need to go to the bathroom.\" Cheryl said. \"Go, but make it quick.\" A few minutes later Cheryl came out all smiles. \"You must have had a very nice bathroom trip.\" Katie said from the front seat. She turned on her butt warmer. \"Why do you get the front seat?\" \"You, apparently, had to go to the bathroom.\" Grace just put the key in and speeded to Starbucks. Once they had all the things needed Grace called Onstar, to get directions to the nearest Iparty. Once the directions were taken care of, the girls were racing toward the nearest Starbucks drive through, and off to Iparty. When Grace pulled up to the menu of Starbucks drinks, she scanned it and asked the girls what they wanted. \"Hello, welcome to Starbuck, how may I help you?\" A sleepy voice asked from the inside of Starbucks. \"Hi, um one venti Hot chocolate, hold the whip.\" \"Yep.\" \"One venti White hot chocolate hold the whip.\" \"Sure.\" \"One venti caramel macchiato hold the whip and dressing, and one iced chocolate peppermint mocha.\" \"Anything else?\" \"Yes, two Asaigo bagels, three blueberry scones, four chocolate croissants, one cheese Danish, one chocolate mini sparkle doughnut, one chocolate old fashioned doughnut, and five marble pound cakes.\" \"Okay will that be all?\" \"Yes.\" Who the heck is all this food for? Not me or Katie, we already ate, and even Gracie can't eat that much. \"Ok that would be one venti Hot chocolate, hold the wip, One venti White hot chocolate hold the wip, One venti caramel macchiato hold the wip and dressing, and one iced chocolate peppermint mocha, two Asaigo bagels, three blueberry scones, four chocolate croissants, one cheese Danish, one chocolate mini sparkle doughnut, one chocolate old fashioned doughnut, and five marble pound cakes?\" \"That's all.\" \"Alright, your total comes to $37.98. First window please.\" \"Grace who is all the food for?\" Katie asked as Grace put the car in park next to the first window. \"Taste testers, for the bureau. They get to pick the desserts, and then I have to go get them.\" \"Nice,\" Cheryl mustered from the back, \"So who're you giving the extras to?\" \"Whoever wants them.\" Grace finished as a short dark skinned girl walked up to the counter. \"Hello, that'll be $37.98, cash or credit?\" \"Credit,\" Grace said as she whipped out her visa. \"Okay,\" She swiped the card and gave it back to Gracie. \"Thank you have a good day!\" \"Thanks.\" Gracie said as she sped away in her car. The girls blasted the radio all the way to iparty. After about ten minutes, Gracie was pulling into the giant parking lot for iparty. Katie was the first to get out. \"Oh I'm so excited we get to pick all the decorations and everything! Should we get balloons too?\" \"It's not the day of the party so well have to get the ones we want and fill 'em up ourselves.\" \"Oh, That's so much fun!\" Cheryl jumped in. \"Alright, Katie, you and Cheryl can get the balloons, I'll go look for things that fall under a white silver theme.\" Gracie said, unenthusiastically. She clutched her coffee cup and stalked off. \"Alright, let's see. We need white and silver balloons.\" Katie said as she grabbed a bag of both. \"Gold couldn't hurt either!\" Cheryl added, and reached for that pack. \"We could get balloons that said things like…\" \"Like what? All they have is happy birthday and congratulations.\" Cheryl said. \"True.\" ….. After all the choosing was over and the final strings had been tied up, the only thing left to do was wait for the talent show to start.

Sifting through hisnrow of films, sh read off their titles. \"Jack Chan, Bruce Lee, Jean ClaudenVan Damm and...Bambi?\" She cast a suspcious glance at him. \"Bambi?\" shenrepeated. He ran his fingers through his hair and shrugged. \"It's for my...nephew...Sam, we're uh...real close..,\" he snatched anpicture off the end table and held it up. A blond haired, blue eyed boynpetting his dog smiled at Hart. Her eyes shifted to the corner of thenpicture where \"3 x 5 Solid Wood Frame\" was printed. \"That picture came with the frame!\" \"Ok, ok! So Bambi's really just for me! In Firearms training Incouldn't stand the thought of shooting a gun. SO I watched the openingnscene of Bambi over and over trying to desensitize myself.\" \"Did it work?\" \"No, but I've got a strange new fascination with fluffy tails.\" Hensmirked and slapped her butt. \"Watch it Grease Monkey.\" \"If you can't say anything nice, don't say anything at all.\" \"Why do I get the feeling you watched more than just the openingnscene?\" \"...Time for some goold old Jackie Chan!\" She rolled her eyes andnflopped down on the couch. Halfway through the movie, her eyelids were starting to droop, andnshe rested herself against the pillows. \"Hey, hey, hey, send a little ofnthat my way,\" Eric motioned. \"But your pillows are just so comfortable and strangely MarthanStewart-esque,\" she murmered. \"C'mon, I'm the same way, try me out.\" She relented and leanednagainst him, as he swept his arms around her. Settling in, she nodded. \"Comfortable yes, but I'm still missing that Martha Stewart thing.\" \"Well today we'll begin with one very good looking G-man and a formernBeauty Queen. You'll be needing once couch and an empty apartment. Now,nlet's see what kind of fun new projects we can make this episode.\" Henleaned in to kiss her, a kiss that lasted all the way through yet anothernfight scene on the television. \"Congratulations Eric, you've just made even the most wholesomenAmerican homemaker sound dirty.\" He just laughed and kissed her again. \"I'm good at other things too, you know.\" \"I'm sure you are,\" and suddenly no one was paying attention tonJackie Chan's flying leg kick. They were halfway to his bedroom when shenbroke the kiss. \"Sorry Matthews, not tonight.\" He looked at her with hurt eyes.n\"Remember you said it'd just be a casual dinner and if we happen to havensex afterward, so be it?\" He nodded. \"Well I just can't prove you right.\"nShe kissed him a last time and stood up to leave. \"How's tomorrow?\" She smirked and shut the door.[Chapter 4] 11 o'clock Saturday morning she lay squished up on her mattress in anheap. A loud knocking sent her flailing out of bed and she scramblednaround, disoriented. Grumbling and tripping across the floor, she pullednopen her duplex door. \"What?!\" she muttered, her eyes half open, her hairnratted out in a tangled mass. Matthews stood before her, smiling, his hair,nof course, as usual, perfect to the last strand. \"Well hello to you too, Sunshine,\" he said, waving a bag of donuts innfront of her nose and stepping inside. She greeted him with a look of half-nasleep suspicion, but her eyes followed the donuts. \"Mornin' Eric,\" she yawned, and he kissed her on the cheek, wrappingnhis arms around her waist,\"But what the hell are you doing here? Not that Inmind or anything,\" she snatched the donuts from him and stalked off intonthe kitchen. Shoving a pile of \"National Enquirer\"'s off the kitchen chair,nshe made a place for Matthews to sit, she flopped into a chair. He scoopednup one of the issues and skimmed it, while she munched on a Boston Creme. \"Keepin' a close eye on Bat Boy, I see.\" \"I'm tellin' you, that kid is Public Enemy #1, but you still haven'tntold me what you're doing here.\" \"Can't a guy just want to spend time with his girlfriend?\" \"A guy like you?\" \"I'm hurt!\" he clutched his chest in mock offense. \"What's the real reason Matthews?\" \"Well, uh, Beth the...\" \"Girl scout?\" Hart offered. \"...the undergrad,\" Matthews continued,\"Keeps callin' and stoppin'nby.\" \"Revenge of the Sorority Girl,\" Hart mused,\"Wasn't that a horrornmovie?\" \"...so I'm hidin' out here 'til she goes away.\" \"Can't you just wave you gun around? You know they gave us thosenthings for a reason.\" \"Well unlike you, Gracie, some people don't like to come off as gun-ntoting anti-socials, right off the bat.\" \"Hey, I'm not anti-social. I spent a week in a hotel with America'snbubbliest, shining beauty queens - I am not anti-social.\" \"'Course you're not,\" Matthews conceded, kissing her powder-sugarncoated lips. \"Damn right I'm not, \" she re-affirmed, stuffing down the rest of anjelly-filled and standing up, stretching her arms. \"Well Eric, if you'rengoing to stick around, you're in for the ride of your life - it's laundrynday.\" \"Aw, Hart, don't you have something a little more interesting to do?\" \"Hey, you're usin' my house to hide from the kindergardener...\" \"College student!\" \"Whatever, you're hidin' out here, you can help me.\" She disappearedninto her bedroom for a moment and returned with a bulging laundry bag.nHeading for the door, she grabbed Matthews' arm,\"Off to the laundry mat.\" \"Whoa, whoa, whoa...\" he protested,\"Hart, you just got up, you'rengonna walk outta the house like that?\" She looked herself over. Cleannsweatpants, clean t-shirt, and her socks even matched. She shrugged and henraised an eyebrow. Throwing her arms up in defeat, she retreated back intonher bedroom. Re-emerging ten minutes later in jeans and a new top, her hairnpulled back in a decent ponytail, she held up her arms and turned in ancircle for his approval. \"Looookin' good, Hart!\" Matthews whistled. She rolled her eyes andngrabbed the laundry bag. He held the door open for her as they exited. Outnon her front porch, starting down the steps, Gracie's neighbor stucker hernhead out her window, between her potted plants. \"Mornin' Gracie, see you've got a gentleman caller.\" \"Mornin' Mrs. Katsopolis - he's just a friend.\" \"Is that all I am, huh?\" Eric whispered into her ear, kissing itnsoftly. He grabbed the laundry bag from her, wrapped his free arm aroundnher waist, and pulled her close. Mrs. Katsopolis pulled her head back in the window and smiled,\"Wish Inhad a couple friends like that...\"[Chapter 5] \"It's officially a conspiracy,\" Hart informed Matthews, as they'dnfinished her laundry and were heading back up the street. \"The fitted sheetnis impossible to fold using any methods known to man.\" \"Sure Hart – the sheet companies make unfoldable sheets to promotenfrustration and disorder amongst the masses.\" \"That's what I'm talking about!\" \"Alright – no more National Enquirer for you!\" Under Mrs. Katsopolis' grinning looks, they walked back up the porchnand back into the house. \"How 'bout some lunch, Hart?\" he called as Gracenretreated to her room, dumping the clean laundry in a heap on the floor.nEyeing the microwave dinner boxes, he gulped and called out,\"How 'bout wenorder in?\" \"Oh sure, you've got you choice of Chang's or Norma's. Chang makes burgersnand Norma makes chinese food – it's your pick.\" \"Anything certified by the Health Dept.?\" \"I wouldn't count on it,\" Hart admitted, rejoining him in the kitchen. \"To insure our safety – how 'bout we head to my place? There's a goodnpizza joint that delivers over there – minus the food poisoning.\" \"I dunno...is the delivery boy cute? 'Cause if you're just tryin' tonfinish what we started last night, then I might have to run off with him.\" \"I think I'm safe for now – unless you've got a passion for pimplenfaced, bleach blond delivery boys with braces.\" \"Look who's talkin' – I've seen your high school pictures.\" \"I never bleached my hair! Only the pure, natural ingredients fornthis babies,\" he defended, smoothing his hair back. \"Right Matthews, since when do perms qualify as natural?\" \"That was not a perm! It was the humidity!\" \"C'mon, let's go,\" Gracie relented, rolling her eyes and pulling himntowards the door. \"It was! When it's humid I get ringlets!\" \"Will you shut up?\" Hart laughed, pulling him into a kiss. He pullednher closer, and returned the kiss until they had to come up for air.n\"Mmm...\" Gracie mused, a content smile on her face. \"I'm that good, huh?\" \"Sorry Matthews, I was just thinking about a large piece of pizza – Inreally am hungry.\" \"Thanks Hart, you do wonders for my self esteem.\" \"A girl does what she can,\" she smirked and locked the door behindnher. They made it to his car before Mrs. Katsopolis' head peaked out of thenwindow once more. \"He's good looking with a nice car! Ride it for all it's worthnGracie!\" she called. Gracie shook her head in humiliation. \"You know what they say - can't argue with good advice,\" Matthewsnwhispered in her ear. She rolled her eyes and climbed into the car. \"Let's go Mr. Wisdom.\" \"So eager for a ride are we?\" \"Don't start with me Matthews – the delivery boy is sounding betternand better.\"[Chapter 6] \"Home sweet home,\" Eric announced, unlocking the door. \"How sweet, is that available stitched on a pillow somewhere?\" \"Sorry – I ditched Home Ec.\" \"Oooh, what a rebel you were! Rebel with a perm...\" \"Hey – we've been over this. Hu-mid-i-ty. Humidity.\" \"Whatever, just order the pizza, but careful with the phone – wouldn't want you to squash your delicate ringlets.\" \"Payback,\" he glared,\"Payback is coming.\" Grabbing the phone, he pressed '2.' \"The pizza man's on speed dial?\" \"I told you I ditched Home Ec,\" he whispered. \"Hi, yeah, I'd like a medium...,\" Hart coughed,\"...large cheese pizza. Yeah, thanks.\" Hanging up the phone he shrugged,\"It'll be here in 20.\" \"Damn fast. Special G-Man priveleges?\" \"I'm a repeat customer – I keep the pizza economy thriving.\" \"And yet you manage to keep this nice, trim figure,\" she slapped his butt. \"Hey, hey, I thought this area was off limits.\" \"Well if you want to play by the rules...\" \"Nevermind,\" he cut her off, pulling her to him. \"I'm the rebel, remember?\" She smirked and leaned back. \"He's a rebel and he'll never never be any goooood, he's a rebel 'cause he never never does what he should. Just because he doesn't do what...,\" he cut her off, clamping his hand over her mouth. \"Thank god that wasn't your talent.\" \"Yeah, I bet you're really glad that I can beat the crap out of you instead.\" \"Payback, I swear, payback is coming.\" The doorbell interrupted his glare. \"Pizza first, payback later,\" reaching into his back pocket, she grabbed his wallet and hurried to the door. Pulling the door open, Hart stopped in her tracks, and cringed,\"Uh, are you the pizza...\" Man? Woman? \"...deliverer?\" \"Yesh, I'm Josh.\" \"Joooooosh,\" she nodded in understanding,\"Riiiiight.\" \"Well that'll be 13.99, pretty lady.\" \"Um,\" she flipped through the wallet, \"Do you have change for a twenty?\" \"Sure, I've got change, I keep my change right here,\" he padded his belt. \"Well ok,\" she handed over the twenty,\"Then you can just uh, keep the change. Have a nice day!\" Grabbing the pizza with one hand, she shoved the door closed with her foot. \"Matthews – have no further fears about me running away with the pizza man.\" \"Even if he was the last man on earth?\" \"Do you really think he falls under the 'man' category?\" \"Ouch – tough standards there Hart.\" \"Be nice – I'm in possession of the pizza.\" \"I can be nice, I can be very nice,\" he looked up at her from the couch, tugging at the bottom of her shirt. \"Eeeeeeric,\" she smirked,\"We just got pizza.\" \"I for one don't mind cold pizza, how 'bout you?\" He pulled her into a deep kiss. \"Nope,\" she mumbled, her lips numb,\"Cold pizza sounds good. Cold pizza sounds very good.\"[Chapter 7] Author's Note: Hmmm...So it's been almost three years since I updated this. Uhh...I'm sorry? Not sure if you can really apologize for that kind of story abandonment. But if you can, and if any of the same readers are out there: I'm sorry. And enjoy! The next morning, Eric rolled over, cracking one eye open. He surveyed the damage of the past day's and night's events. Aside from the clothes strewn about, only a few lampshades, a couple dresser drawers, and a chair or two needed fixing… Chuckling to himself, he turned his attention from the room to Hart, still sleeping peacefully next to him. She woke slowly to feeling of his hands running through her hair. \"Matthews,\" she murmured, still half asleep. \"It's early. I don't want to play beauty shop right now.\" \"I can't help it Hart,\" he said,\"I'm just amazed…your hair, it's still…perfect. After all this, it still looks good. So I just gotta ask…if you leave it alone and it looks like this, what the hell were you doing to it before?\" \"Having wild sex with a biker gang,\" she muttered into the pillow, rolling over. \"Now let me sleep.\" He snaked an arm around her waist and pulled her to him. \"Oh yeah?\" he said, pressing kisses onto her back. \"And how were they?\" Through the haze which still filled her head this early in the morning, Hart debated her options on how to answer to the question. Finally, she rolled back over to face him, pulling him to her with a kiss. \"Not as good as you, Matthews. Never as good as you.\" ----------- The next thing Eric knew, the red light of his alarm clock was flashing an insistent 10:45 directly in his face. The persistent glow was enough to inspire him to sit up, disentangling himself from Grace and reaching for the clock. \"Shit,\" he muttered under his breath, hitting the buttons. \"We are in trou-ble.\" Hart shifted softly in her sleep and he looked down at her. \"Worth it,\" he nodded,\"But in trouble.\" As if on cue, Matthews' cell phone began ringing insistently from across the room…from wherever he had left his pants. Hoping to catch it before it woke Hart, he began searching the room for the ring. \"Matthews,\" he greeted, finally seizing upon the offending device. \"Matthews,\" MacDonald's voice shot across the airwaves, gruff and annoyed as usual. \"You're late. I give you time off and this is the kind of responsibility you show.\" \"Uh, yes, sir, just having a little trouble with my uh, … electricity this morning. Won't happen again,\" Eric tried to cover discreetly. \"Certainly not.\" \"Good,\" MacDonald shot back,\"I should hope not. Oh and Matthews-\" \"Yes sir.\" \"You haven't seen Hart by chance, have you?\" \"Uh, no sir, certainly haven't--\" \"I'm having Margaret page her now.\" \"Oh, uh--\" Before Matthews could act, Hart's beeper went off across the room, blaring. Eric shot after it, tossing the discarded clothes in search of the betraying noise. \" Matthews , that wouldn't happen to be what I think it is, would it?\" MacDonald's voice, even and firm with growing annoyance, came across the line, accompanied by smothered snickers in the background. Shit, Eric cursed. \"Uh, I'm not sure sir, but um, I'm on speaker phone, aren't I captain?\" \"Eric?\" Gracie called out sleepily at that moment, \"Eric, what're you doing?\" \"Correction,\" MacDonald spoke,\"You're both on speaker phone. Agents, I want you in here A.S.A.P.\" Click. Eric dropped the phone to the ground, abandoning the pile of clothes he'd been ransacking to find the pager and collapsed back on the bed. Hart, taking in the situation, groaned and flopped next to him. \"Add that to the list of things we've done to piss off MacDonald lately. But its not like we'll be fired.\" \"Even if--I've been fired before,\" Hart said, scooting closer. \"It's really not that bad.\" \"Oh yeah?\" Matthews asked, leaning over for a kiss. \"Yeah,\" Hart said, giving in,\"And besides. This? Totally worth it.\" ","Summary":" Author: Harlaquinne[Chapter 2] Hart cursed as someone began knocking on her door,\"Just my luck tha"},{"Movie":"Cats & Dogs","Title":"A Cats and Dogs Christmas","Author":"ZapWBolt","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11634146","Passage":"[Chapter 1] Chapter One Let it snow, let it snow. let it snow! I yawned, and sat up. The air was cold… Wait, cold? Oh… Yeah I remember. I thought. I wasn't in San Francisco anymore- I was in New York city! I burst out of the top of my room. Snow! I laughed out loud, and dove off my roof into the white fluff. I hadn't seen snow like that since… Since last year when I visited my hometown in Canada! The name's Zap Wolf Bolt. I'm half Gray Wolf, half Newfoundland dog, a roaming stray. And I'm an agent at Dog World Headquarters where we fight the spread of dangerous feline incidents across the world. In other words, we fight evil cats. It was Christmas time, and my team and I had been sent to NYC to track down a dangerous kitty- Purrface- who was out to destroy Christmas. I dashed through the white blanket that had covered the city over night. I looked up. The looming buildings were covered in wreaths and ribbons. And there, in the middle of Rockefeller Center, was the tree. The beautiful tree, glistening with lights of all colors. It shone, covered with glowing ornaments. And on the very tip top, was the golden star that spread its light all over. People were gathered around, gazing at the magnificent tree. I walked up slowly, listening to the Christmas music playing loudly above the ice rink, where people were skating gracefully around. \"Doggy!\" I turned my head to see a small little girl running towards me. \"Camile! No!\" Her parents yelled, chasing after her. The little girl stopped in front of me, and reached out her hand to pet me. She placed her hand on the top of my head. He parents flinched, expecting for the worst, but I just leaned into her hand. Even I, the most wild dog in the city, could get along with humans for the Christmas season. After the little girl left, I walked closer to the tree. It was even better looking from this angle! I stared up at the sparkling star, when I heard someone calling my name. \"Zap!\" It was Patches. He used to be my trainee, and this was his first Christmas as a full-fledged agent. \"Hey kid.\" I nodded, smiling as he sat down next to me. \"This is awesome!\" He exclaimed, looking all around. \"Epic!\" \"I know right? I haven't seen the Rockefeller tree in ages, and this is only your first time!\" I said, my ears perking up to the listen to the music. Silver Bells was playing. I looked around. City sidewalks, busy sidewalks. Ah, yep that was New York City for ya. Busy sidewalks, especially at Christmas time. I sat with Patches by the tree for a while. Purrface or no Purrface, this was going to be a great Christmas.[Chapter 2] Chapter Two Patches and I still sat at the tree, marveling it's beauty. \"Hey.\" I heard a rough voice say. I turned around to see Butch, another member of my team. Butch and I were the top leaders of the team, and he was my trainer when I was young. \"Hey Butch.\" I said. \"Just admiring the tree.\" Butch nodded, looking up at the top where the star blazed. \"I haven't seen this thing in ages.\" \"Neither have I…\" I murmured. \"Ha! I used to live here! And on Christmas, Lucky didn't even let me come see it! He said it was… Dangerous.\" Patches laughed, with a bit of resent in his voice. \"He was such a control freak. I can't believe I spent my time there when I could've been here…\" I sighed. Lucky. Leader of the Pound Puppies of Shelter 17. They helped stray dogs get their owners, kind of a top secret thing like us agents here… Lucky, he was a good dog. I had known him since I was a pup. He always saw Patches as his son, and he was so afraid he would lose him… Because… Well, he had lost pretty much everyone else he cared about. His mother died when he was very young, and his siblings; he didn't really know where they were. Only his father was left. The only thing is, he had no idea who Patches was… And who he was to me… I sighed again, and shook off my thoughts. \"Kid, we should go see the Pound Puppies later today, just for a visit.\" 'Really? That would be great! I can't wait to see the Pup Club again…\" Patches exclaimed happily. Suddenly, I got a strange feeling over me. We were being watched. I looked over at Butch. He gave me a glance, saying through his eyes, You feel it? I nodded in return and he both stood up. I leaned into Patches to speak to him quietly. \"Look, kid, someone's watching us right now, and I need you to pretend nothing's happening. Butch and I are going to do some scanning to see if there are any cats in the area.\" Patches nodded excitedly, and turned around, back to facing the tree. \"Collar, radar.\" A small gadget, concealed in my long, block fur came out of my collar and started scanning the area for the C.A.T. microchip. Suddenly, my collar began to buzz. I had found something! I looked over into an alleyway to see two dark figures darting among the trash cans. They quickly scaled the wall of the buildings and disappeared. \"Butch.\" I called him over and showed him the chip number registered. \"0134 and 0135.\" I read. Butch and I exchanged a glance. \"The Siamese Team.\"[Chapter 3] Chapter Three I paced the floor of the New York D.O.G. worriedly. How long would Adrianna be in there? Adrianna, was the leader of the NY H.Q. She was a white standard poodle. Currently, she was in a meeting, and me and Butch had to talk to her. IMMEDIATELY. \"So, who are these Siamese Team guys…?\" Patches asked curiously. \"I've never heard of them.\" \"The Siamese Team,\" Butch began. \"Are a merciless team of just two cats, Basil and Hazel. They're what I like to call, Annihilagents. They're sent to kill a certain victim or two, and they'll stop at nothing.\" \"And the Siamese Team is the most dangerous of these, Annihilagents. They've captured and destroyed countless D.O.G. and M.E.O.W.S. agents. We thought they were gone, because they disappeared many years ago. But apparently not…\" I explained. \"Have you two fought them before?\" Came the question. Both Butch and I nodded. \"They attacked me during the Bat case…\" I said. \"Knocked me clean and and they were about to kill me, but I was able to escape.\" \"They captured, Diggs, Catherine and I when we were fighting Tinkles. We fought our way outta that mess…\" Butch sighed. I sat down, and stopped pacing. What was the point? As soon as my tail touched the ground, the door to Adrianna's office flew open. \"You mean to tell me you saw the Siamese Team?!\" She screamed, in a thick New York accent. \"Yes!\" I exclaimed with relief. \"I sent you the coordinates of the place we saw them. Right near Rockefeller Center.\" Adrianna ushered us into her office. We sat down in front of her desk as she typed away on her computer. A map came up, with a blinking icon. It was showing the location I had sent her. \"There?\" She asked, her eyes wide. \"Yes.\" I replied. \"They disappeared over the top of that building.\" Adrianna began typing again. Suddenly, her computer screen went crazy. It started beeping, and then went pitch black. A shot of fear went through my spine. We were getting hacked.[Chapter 4] \"Tech agent! We need a tech agent!\" Adrianna screamed, shoving things away from her computer screen. \"Let me.\" I dove in, and started typed, hoping to override the hack. When I was a trainee, I had taken a part time class on tech so I knew enough to fix the problem. There was a long silence as I worked. Then Patches finally said, \"What's going on?\" \"I can't seem to stop it. I said. There's a video file attached so I think we'll just have to let it play. Then, I can check for viruses.\" I explained. The computer screen went black as it started to play the video. It was dark, and we could barely see the figure who was recording the video. But we knew who it was. We all did. \"Greetings, my canine enemies…\" A feline voice purred. \"I have come to tell you my plan… My plan to destroy Christmas!\" The cat cackled, letting her calico print become visible. That confirmed it. Purrface. \"See, I am going to take everything… Everyone's Christmas decorations and presents and EVERYTHING all over the world! I'll let you figure out how I'm going to do that… And then, I will alter these items to SUCK THE HOLIDAY CHEER OUT OF EVERYONE!\" \"But why! Why do you want to do this!\" I exclaimed angrily. Purrface's facial expression changed for a split second, showing a face of pain and sorrow, but it quickly vanished. \"Does that really matter? Either way I'm going to destroy the holidays for everyone!\" Purrface laughed again. \"Now bye bye little doggies… I have plans waiting for ALL of you!\" The recording changed to static and we sat there in silence for a little while, before I began checking for viruses. \"We are going to stop her.\" I said quietly and lowly. \"She is not going to do this.\" Adrianna nodded, turning back to her computer. \"Can you get the location the video was recorded?\" I shook my head. \"She was using a cloaking device that protected it. Couldn't hack it.\" I turned to Butch and we made eye contact. We knew exactly what we had to do. It was time to bring in the rest of the team.[Chapter 5] Chapter Five Butch and I stood in front of the rest of the team. The team consisted of the dogs, Rocky, Shades, Ivy, Patches, Roscoe, Junior, Diggs, Blaze, Sage, and the cats, Catherine, Fuschia and Alley, of course including Butch and I. They were on the main floor, decorating for the Christmas party. We stayed there, silently, looking and them with a serious gaze. They soon turned their heads up to us. \"Dude, what's wrong?\" My best friend, Rocky Rap the Rottweiler finally spoke. \"The Siamese Team has been spotted.\" Everyone gasped. \"We need to get out there and track them down! If we find them, they may lead us to Purrface!\" I exclaimed. \"Everyone, split up into their usual groups!\" Butch ordered. Everyone did so. Patches, Rocky and Roscoe came over to where Butch and I were. Diggs, Blaze, Junior, Ivy and Shades went into another group, and Catherine, Fuschia, Alley and Sage did the same. I nodded, and each group split off to exit into the city. Butch, Rocky, Patches, Roscoe and I quietly walked through an alleyway. It was the last place we had seen the Siamese Team, and we suspected they were still in the city. \"Okay. Everyone split up and search this alley.\" I whispered, turning around to a wall that was lined with garbage cans. I sniffed the area thoroughly. Suddenly, I got a strange smell. Kitty litter and sardines… Cat! I whipped around to see a shadow dart behind me. I slunk forward, sniffing the air. \"Zap!\" I heard Butch call out. \"Do you smell that?\" I nodded quickly, and turned back to my work. Then, there was a soft little clink! I pricked my ears up to listen. Clink! There it was again! Bump! A small pebble landed on the ground before me. I glared at it, trying to survey where it had come from. I knew someone was standing above me. I looked up slowly. There stood two siamese cats, high on top of a window sill. \"We meet again, Zap Wolf Bolt.\"[Chapter 6] Chapter Six I stood, rigidly, facing my opponents. They were motionless as well, as we stared each other down. Butch had come up to my side. His face bore the strong expression of fear and anger. \"Basil.\" He growled menacingly. \"Hazel.\" Rocky was standing next to me as well, and Patches and Roscoe stood behind us. Each of us, trained well, knowing we had to get into a certain position to be able to start the fight off on our advantage. But the Siamese Team were trained just as well as us. They quickly lept into action, flipping off the windowsill and down to the ground in front of us. \"Butch! Zap! It is so good to see you again!\" Basil hissed. She was the black pointed Siamese. \"Yes… But this time, you won't make it out alive!\" Hazel, the brown pointed cat, slashed the air with her claw. After those words, I knew it was time to fight. The two cats leapt up into the air and came down hard upon us. Basil was clinging to my back, her razor sharp claws digging into my skin. I let out an angry bark and did the old trick I learned back in training class… \"I call this, the 'roll over boy!\" I yelled, quickly dropping onto the ground and rolling over Basil. I was a large dog, about a hundred pounds heavier than the cat. She screeched, releasing her claws, but she quickly recovered. Butch, Rocky and I fought incredibly well, smashing the cats to the ground and biting them on the back of their necks, throwing them across the alley. Patches and Roscoe did their best to help by blocking the cats' paths and helping hit them down, but they were very young agents with little experience. Soon, we had the Siamese Team cornered. We surely thought we had won… \"Bring in the reinforcements!\" Hazel shouted. Before we knew it, fifteen ninjas leapt of the rooftop and down upon us \"We can't fight them off like this!\" I barked loudly over the sound of screeching and howling. Soon, we were the ones cornered. I tried to charge at the group approaching us, as did my partners, but we had all been injured in some way. I looked at Butch. A gash ran down the side of his head, and he held his paw up. Rocky's back two legs were both cut. I had a large wound where a razor blade had gone over my back, and my paw was sprained. Patches and Roscoe were also beat up, not being able to help us either. \"Say night night doggies!\" I realized the ninjas had put on gas masks and they each had a pack on their back with giant hoses attached. I knew what that was… A puff of white smoke came out of each other the ninjas tanks, and I began to feel very light headed. The last thing I saw was a calico cat with a zig zag pattern on her head. She was wearing a gas mask, but I could tell she was laughing… Then I blacked out.[Chapter 7] I slowly opened my eyes. My eyelids felt very heavy, and the world in front of me was just a mix of colors. I felt very strange, and tired. I blinked to clear my vision. I looked around and saw I was in a metal walled room. There were blinking red lights on the wall. There was also a giant, steel door that had a paw print symbol next to it. I realized I was trapped on a metal table, cuffs restraining my paws, tail and head. What had happened? \"Oh good… You have awoken!\" A voice said from across the room. I lifted my heavy head and saw a calico cat with a strange pattern running down her back. Then I remembered. Purrface! \"What… What are you doing?\" I asked weakly, trying to sound brave and strong. \"Just preparing a little Christmas present for you… If you tell me where the New York Headquarters is located, I won't need to give it to you!\" She smirked, turning her back to me to continue putting together what she was doing. \"I won't!\" I growled. \"I won't tell you anything! And what have you done with my team?!\" \"Oh, they're in other rooms. My agents are trying to get the secrets out of them… So if you won't tell me, you better hope one of your friends does!\" Purrface hissed, leaving her work and turning to me. I shook my head, whispering Never! over and over again inside my head. \"Give me the exact coordinates of New York Headquarters now. And maybe even your home Headquarters, Dog World… \" Never! Never! Never! I turned my head to one side. There was a large window, and through it I could see into another room… On the table was Patches! I saw a henchcat walk over to him. The cat pulled something out- a knife! \"No!\" I shouted. \"Don't let them hurt him!\" Patches was a son to me. I would not let them hurt him! \"If you tell me the location, I won't hurt you or any of your friends…\" Purrface's eyes glinted with evil. \"What's your decision? Tell me, or this blade will go straight into your chest!\" She wielded a sharp knife. \"And also, your little friend over there… \" I looked over at Patches. The henchcat was still standing by the table, gripping the weapon. I sighed. I knew what I had to do, for my partners. My friends. \"I'll give you the location!\" I shouted. Purrface grinned evilly, going over to the counter where she picked up my collar. \"Activate it.\" She said. I obeyed, opening the collar and pulling up the map to show her the coordinates of both Headquarters. Purrface's face glowed with evil. Her eyes looked almost red, and her fur looked dark. \"It is time… to begin the attack!\"[Chapter 8] I was shoved down a dark hall and into a small cell. The henchcats locked it and walked away. I put my paws on the bars, looking out to see if my friends were there. Further down the long hall of cells, I saw Patches. He was looking out as well. \"Psst!\" I hissed, trying to get his attention. \"Kid!\" Patches turned his head to look in my direction. \"Zap!\" \"Are you alright?\" \"I'm fine.\" \"Patches, I had to tell them where HQ was, so I could save you guys. They were gonna kill us if we didn't tell.\" \"I know. But now we have to get out! I bet they're on their way to infiltrate HQ right now!\" I nodded and stuck my head back inside the cell to look around. Nothing was inside, of course. But something caught my eye… There was a metal plate on the back wall. It looked like it closed off some doorway. A screw was loose, so I tried to pull off the plate. It was on very strongly, and I couldn't do it. \"Zap!\" Patches called. \"Look!\" I walked over to the bars and stuck my head out. Patches was holding a metal rod. It looked like it had come from a cell door. \"Where'd you find that?\" I asked. \"One of the bars was loose on this thing. I pulled it off so maybe we could use it?\" Patches held the metal bar far out. \"Should I roll it over?\" I nodded. It was exactly what I needed to pry the door off. Patches quietly rolled the rod across the floor and grabbed it, pulling it inside the cell. I stuck it under the plate and started to pull it off. Soon, the entire thing had come off! \"Kid!\" I whispered. \"I found a secret door! I'll be back for you, but maybe this can help us escape!\" I heard Patches calm reply, which was 'Okay' and I climbed into the passage. It was cramped and dark inside, but I kept on going. Soon I saw a light ahead of me. I sped up as I got closer and closer to it. Soon, it had enveloped me. I let my eyes adjust and I looked out, still inside the passage in case of danger. But I wasn't prepared for what I saw. Cats, everywhere. They were rushing about this giant room full of conveyor belts and machinery. Christmas ornaments, presents and wreaths all alike were being pushed down the belt. Giant blocks stamped on them, placing a small metal piece on it. I guessed that was what Purrface was going to use to brainwash everyone. So many questions were going through my head. Where was she getting these items. How was she going to distribute them? What was this place? I turned my head. The third question had been answered. This, as a large sign declared, was the Assembly Line.[Chapter 9] I stood, staring at the great machinery in the room. Never had I seen such a large facility. But I guess, if you have billions of Christmas decorations and whatnot, you need that kind of space. I was still looking around in awe when I got an idea. If I could get the keys from one of the security guards, I could get my friends out! But I needed a distraction… Clink! I turned my head towards the sound. I saw a small, green and red striped ornament rolling towards me. I quickly grabbed it. Now, I needed to get out of the tunnel. I swiftly did so, softly running and darting behind barrels and carts to hide. Soon, I was close enough to the door, where a guard was waiting. I knew what to do- I needed to throw the ornament. Which I promptly did. It shattered on the ground in front of the guard and as he turned around to investigate, and reached up and swiftly grabbed the keys. Then I got outta there! I ran back towards the tunnel as quickly as possible, and dove into it, crawling back to my cell, hoping no one had noticed I was missing. Which no one had, I saw when I returned. I carefully put the metal plate back into place and took the key to the front of the cell. I stuck my paw out of the door and shoved the key into the lock and pushed the door open. Patches looked up happily when he saw me coming. I opened his cell and he darted out. \"How did you get that key?\" He asked. \"I'll explain later. Now let's find the others!\" I exclaimed. \"I know where they are. Rocky and Roscoe were with me and they took them down that way. Another guard brought Butch down and they took him the other way.\" Patches explained. \"Good job. Observing and gathering information. That's the first step to being a great agent.\" I barked, as Patches led me down the hall. Soon, we had freed the other three. All of us dashed quickly down the halls and corridors, trying to find a way out. \"Dude!\" I heard Rocky yell-whisper. I followed the sound of his voice and found him standing near a large wall- that displayed a map! \"Ooh, great!\" I exclaimed, following a path on the map. \"The exit is straight ahead!\" \"Go on ahead.\" Butch said. \"I'm gonna go get our collars.\" \"Butch, we gotta escape!\" I told him, worriedly. \"It'll only take a sec. I'll be fine.\" Before I could stop him. Butch was galloping down the hall with the rooms we had woken up in. I sighed, hoping it wouldn't be long. We had to get out! But before I knew it, Butch was back with five collars. \"What'd I tell ya?\" He grinned, handing out the collars. \"Now let's get out!\"[Chapter 10] We had successfully escaped Purrface's hideout and we were on our way back to HQ. I explained to the others what I had seen and how I had gotten the key. But I also had to tell them that I gave out the location of the New York D.O.G. We knew the cats were already there, but we had to see what we could do to stop it. Sure enough, as we approached Headquarters, we saw the place was crawling with cats. We parked our Rocket Sled and hopped out, to survey the damage. I looked down. The bubbling lava that surrounded HQ looked more menacing then ever. I saw agents fighting, and trainees fleeing. Adrianna was being dragged out of the building. This was bad. Very bad. \"Let's see if the rest of the team is here.\" I suggested, sighing as I looked upon the mess. We ran through the battlefield of agents, searching desperately for our teammates. \"Zap!\" I turned around. Shades and her team were running towards us. Catherine and her team were also coming. \"I everyone alright?\" I asked, counting the team to make sure everyone was there, which they were. \"What happened to you guys?\" Diggs asked. \"And how did this happen?\" \"No time to explain right now.\" Butch growled. \"We need to find out if Dog World Headquarters was infiltrated yet.\" \"It was.\" I turned around to face a young dog with tan fur and black points. A Chinook dog. \"That's why I'm here.\" \"Mistrel!\" Patches cried. Yes it was. Patches's friend from Dog World. He ran over and hugged her. Roscoe and Junior both gave her a high-paw. \"Lou sent you?\" I asked. She nodded. \"Of course our D.O.G. has stronger forces and was able to repel the attack, but here… Lou sent me to bring you a message, since he can't get one through the web right now.\" \"Yes?\" \"It's about Purrface's plan. A few tech agents have been tracking her and they figured out how she's doing it.\" Mistrel explained. \"She has cat agents, each assigned to a small part of the world. They have to collect as many decorations and gifts and stuff, and ship them here where they will be marked, with metal chips that will send out waves to brainwash people. Then they will be distributed back out. People will become angry and sad, from this mental control. Christmas will be destroyed! And in everyone's weakened state, she will be able to take over!\" Everyone gasped. Then I said, \"Yes. I saw the assembly line. I saw them putting on the little chips.\" We all looked at each other. We knew what we had to do. We had to destroy her machinery.[Chapter 11] Chapter Eleven Christmas Eve. The night of nights. The holiday eve of holiday eves. The best night of the year and we were spending it infiltrating Purrface's hide out. I was going to get her for it. \"Purrface better hope she's far away from me… I'm gonna rip her to shreds!\" Butch seemed to feel the same way. I sniffed. Something strange was wafting through the cold, winter night air. It smelled like tuna! I looked around to make sure none of the apartments around us had windows open. They didn't; all I saw was the warm glow of golden lights and a few Christmas trees in windows. \"Smell that?\" I asked. \"Yeah, I think it's coming from over there!\" Patches whispered, pointing farther down the building. Mistrel stuck her nose up. \"He's right!\" We ran down the building side,and sure enough, there was a window that had a piece of glass missing. The window was boarded up, but if we pulled the boards away and opened the crack a bit more, one of the cats could get in. \"Look down there!\" Roscoe pointed behind the building. Five cats were wheeling in a large cart full of Christmas decorations. \"Someone could get in one of those carts and be taken inside- probably straight to the assembly room!\" \"Good boy.\" Rocky ruffled his son's fur. \"Who's in? You can probably fit three dogs in there.\" \"Us.\" I pointed to Patches, Rocky and me. \"We get in the cart and the rest of you try to pry that window open. Then that cats go in. When the cats get in, try to find a way to let the others in. We'll be waiting in the assembly room. Rocky found a big map in the corridor, so I bet you can find your way from that.\" \"Sounds good agent.\" Butch nodded. \"Now everyone go!\" Patches, Rocky and I darted across the snowy ground and dove into a cart, burying ourselves under the decorations. Soon, we heard henchcats coming. \"Purrface's plan goes underway tonight at midnight.\" One said. \"That's when she's going to broadcast her brainwashing signal!\" Oh no. I checked the time on my collar. It was ten thirty. \"We only have an hour and a half!\" I whispered. There was a jolt as the cart began to move. The henchcats were wheeling us in.[Chapter 12] Chapter Twelve We sat in the darkness of the cart, breathing as softly as possible. I heard clanking, which I deciphered as us being pushed through a door. Then I heard thumping. I knew that sound! It was the sound of the stamps in the Assembly Line! \"Alright. Put that cart over there and we'll unload it after we finish this batch.\" said a sullen voice as the cart jolted once again and stayed in place. I slowly pushed my head up through the decorations. I looked around. Yep, we were in the assembly room. Even more henchcats then before were rushing about, putting decorations on the belt and gathering the processed ones into the carts. Those carts were wheeled out into a room marked Pick-Up and Drop Off. \"We need to cut this smuggling ring and find the place where she's gonna broadcast.\" I whispered, slowly climbing out of the cart and leaping down. Rocky and Patches did the same. \"Then we gotta destroy this machinery.\" Rocky explained as we snuck behind carts and towards the doorway. \"And we have to find to others.\" I carefully opened the door and peered inside. Cats were hauling carts and bag and throwing them onto platform. The platforms dropped underground, I suspected, into large tubes where they were transported and then distributed. And there, across the room, were the three cats, Catherine, Alley and Fuschia. I waved at them and they saw me, looping around the edge of the room and coming over to where I was. The three of us slipped behind a cart with them so we could talk. \"Okay. The corridor is out through that way. You can find the map there. We'll stay here and try to find the broadcasting room.\" I told them. The three cats nodded, taking off. Rocky, Patches and I continued on through the room. It was very large, and there were platforms everywhere. Bags and boxes dropped down with a whoosh! \"Hey look! Over here!\" Patches was pointing to a door marked TOP SECRET: ENTER AT YOUR OWN RISK. \"Good eye.\" I smiled at him, then turned to the door. \"Maybe that's where she's going to send the signal off. But it's locked. You have to scan your paw to open it.\" Suddenly, the door to the room flew open. I quickly darted back behind a cart. Purrface, with her zigzag fur, stood in the doorway. \"This line better be moving! We don't have much time!\" \"Yes boss,\" A henchcat said, saluting. \"We're just finishing the last delivery. But we may just have to dump some bags full of stuff into people's houses. We lost time while trying to hunt down those prisoners.\" \"Whatever it takes.\" Purrface hissed, her eyes glinting. \"The cats are just finishing up at the New York D.O.G. They got the locations of the other Headquarters, including M.E.O.W.S, and I sent them to hold up those places as well.\" I shook my head. She was attacking as a distraction! We had to stop her before she could destroy any more of the HQs. And we had only an hour left to do it.[Chapter 13] Chapter Thirteen As Purrface was still holding the door open, Rocky, Patches and I darted inside. When we got inside, we looked around in awe. In front of us was a giant computer. It had at least twenty screens and buttons covered it almost completely. All the screen were lit up with an audio sequence on them. Though I could see the sequence, I could not delete it because the computer was locked. \"I may be able to hack it, but you guys have to make sure no one comes in.\" I said, as I stood up to go towards the computer. My two friends nodded, going over to the door. I tried to use my collar to get the thing to open; I had downloaded a hacking software on it earlier that day because I knew this might happen. \"Zap! Someone's coming!\" Rocky exclaimed as he and Patches ran back behind a cart. I abandoned my work on the computer and hurried after them. As I peered out from behind, I saw Purrface and the Siamese Team walking into the room. Purrface wore the look of evil and glory on her face; the unmistakable face every villain wore before they set their plans underway. \"It is time… Time for us to RULE THE WORLD!\" Purrface screeched, unlocking the computer with ease. That's when I decided it was time to step in. I stepped out from behind the cart. \"No.\" I glared at her with as much confidence as I could muster. \"You will not.\" \"And who's going to stop me?\" Purrface smirked. \"Surely not you…\" Right on cue, the Siamese Team leapt into action. They spun towards me as if they were frisbees. And I ran, because I knew if they caught me and my partners, there would be no stopping Purrface. \"C'mon!\" I shouted towards Rocky and Patches. \"Let's get outta here!\" We ran as fast as possible with the Siamese Team on hot pursuit. We skidded across the tile floor, and out the door into the Delivery Room and then back out in the Assembly Line. The rest of the team was already there, attacking henchcats and trying to get them off their work. \"Look out!\" Rocky cried as he leapt over top of me, taking out Basil just as she was about to hit me. Hazel, however was still after me, but not for long because Patches acted quickly, grabbing her by the tail as she was distracted. \"Go Zap, go!\" I surveyed the area around me. The machinery was too big and too grand, and even if I was able to destroy it, there were probably enough items already out to brainwash people. I had one choice, and that was to shut down the whole operation. And I knew just how to do that. Sing.[Chapter 14] Chapter Fourteen \"We wish you a merry Christmas, we wish you a merry Christmas!\" I sung, pouring out as much of my spirit as I could. Everyone stopped dead in their tracks. \"We wish you a merry Christmas and a happy New Year!\" My partners all turned and looked at each other. The henchcats all did the same, wondering what I was doing. Patches was the first to join. He let Hazel out of his grasp and came over to me, standing next to me and singing. Then the others joined, Rocky, Butch. Roscoe, Mistrel, soon the entire team was singing in the factory! Then the miracle happened. A henchcat joined in. Then another, and another, until eventually, everyone in the room was singing, even the Siamese Team. Cat had heard the music from the other rooms, and they came in, joining in the carols. The room just glowed with Christmas spirit. \"What are you doing?!\" Purrface demanded angrily. \"We have work to do! We can rule the world! Stop this at once!\" \"We won't!\" Said a henchcat. \"You've been trying to convince us that we can have everything if you take over the world, but we do have everything.\" \"He's right!\" I barked. \"We have spirit, and happiness. We have each other. Don't you remember the happiness of Christmas?\" It was then that I saw Purrface's evil eyes falter. I could tell she was deep in thought. Finally, she said, \"Yes… I remember… But those days ended a long time ago…\" \"And you can have those times back. If you just stop this, you can have that all back.\" Purrface nodded. \"I… I understand now… \" Even I was a little surprised at this. I thought it would take more to break her, but I should've known… Nothing is stronger than the love on Christmas Eve… In the end of it all, D.O.G., M.E.O.W.S. and C.A.T. all decided to sign a treaty that said we could never fight on Christmas again. Even I got to sign it! We had an amazing Christmas. We were able to fix up the New York HQ just fine, and we re-decorated. We set up the tree, music, games and a giant feast! Wreaths and holly were everywhere. Everyone practically glowed this holiday, as we danced, opened gifts and ate. I had also learned a very important lesson. I learned that even the most evil can feel the Christmas spirit. Nothing is more powerful than the love and joy we share during the holiday season. Christmas, truly was, the most wonderful time of the year. ","Summary":" Chapter One Let it snow, let it snow. let it snow! I yawned, and sat up.

Twister is my all time favorite movie, so I decided to write this fanfiction that takes place before the events of the movie. As you all might know, I had written a story for Twister that was how I thought things would be like before the movie, It was called, ''All teamed up'' and has since then been deleted. The story you see before you is just like ''All teamed up'', only it has a better title and is completely rewritten. As with every fandom, people have theories, and I have my own, which like my old fanfiction, have stayed the same, so if you don't like my theories, PLEASE do NOT read this, as it might not be for your liking. Please enjoy this story. This Story also has POV'S in some chapters, but not all. ~ Twisting Fury Years after Jo's father had passed away from that F5 tornado, Jo Greene had been accepted to Oklahoma university, and was making her journey there. When she had arrived, a few other college students showed her around the campus, and they told her that tomorrow her classes would begin. Jo walked into her dorm room, it was small, but it would do. She knew that this career was very important to her, she would do anything to reach her goal. ''Whatever it takes.'' Jo started, ''I will make you proud, daddy.'' The next morning Jo got ready and she grabbed her various books, then she raced out of her dorm room. Many other girls around the campus didn't really like Jo. She wasn't much like the other girls, she would often find herself hanging out with the guys, and other girls who were a lot like her. Jo didn't even expect it, or realize it, but one of the girls had made her trip, and her books landed all over the ground. All the girls giggled, walking off to class. Jo was about ready to pick up her books, when she felt another hand on top of hers. ''Let me help you with that.'' The male voice called. Jo looked into the grey - blue eyes of a guy with dark brown hair. ''Yeah... Sure! If you want.'' She told him, blushing a little. The man handed Jo her books, and then he asked her, ''So uh... Is it alright if I walk you to class?'' Jo smiled at him. ''Go right ahead! It's the least I could do, since you did help me.'' The two started to head towards class. ''I'm Bill Harding.'' He told Jo, reaching his hand out. Jo shook his hand. ''Nice to meet you Bill. I'm Jo Greene.'' When they got there, Dusty Davis leaped out of his desk, as he saw Bill lead Jo to her seat. Dusty and Bill have been friends since way back. ''Whoa oh dude! Who's the lady friend who got here? Man, you work fast.'' He exclaimed. Bill shook his head, then he replied, ''Ah come on man, don't start that shit. I was only being a gentlemen, something you know absolutely nothing about.'' Bill took his seat right next to Jo, who was sitting behind a man wearing his cap backwards. The meteorology professor told everyone to take their seats, and class began. ''Alright everyone. It is the first day of a new year, so I want everyone to find their partners who they will be studying with for the entire year.'' She continued, ''Today we are going to be talking about the components of weather, and near the end of class, you shall get with your partner and discuss about what you have just learned.'' Bill turned to Jo, ''Hey Jo, I was thinking that maybe you would like to be my study partner for the year?'' Jo nodded her head. ''Sounds good to me! I'd be glad to be your partner.'' Everyone had finally introduced themselves to each other, and soon class was over. Jo walked ahead of everyone else towards the lunch room, but then Bill caught up to her, along with Dusty. ''Hey, Jo. Me and the gang was wondering if you would like to have lunch with us?'' He asked her. Jo turned to them, telling them, ''Sure! I'd be glad to. It's much better then sitting alone.'' They all walked towards a smaller table towards the back of the lunchroom. Jo sat across from Bill, Jonas sitting on the other side of Bill, along with his brother Jessie. Dusty sat on the other side of the table, tired as ever, with a plate full of burger. Jo was about to get up and buy her own lunch, but Bill had already gotten up, telling her to wait there. She did what she was told. Bill came back with his own lunch, but he had another lunch. ''Here you go.'' He told Jo, giving her the brown bag which had a burger in it. Jo was surprised, but she took the lunch from him, and told him, ''Thank you. But you didn't really need to, I brought my own money.'' Bill smiled at her, ''Hey, No problem. It's the best I could do. You are new here, so I want you to know that you are apart of our gang here. We look out for one another. That's what friends are for.'' Jo smiled, shaking her head, and she chatted with her new friends until the bell rang for them to split up and head to their other classes. Bill never left Jo's side that day either, and neither did anyone else. She walked with her friends between each and every class, soon the end of the day came, and Dusty left he campus first, Yelling, ''Alright! Later dude's! Talk to you guys tomorrow!'' Bill walked with Jo to her dorm. ''Well, I guess I'll see you tomorrow then?'' Bill told her. Jo looked at him, ''Thanks for walking me to my dorm. See you Tomorrow Bill.'' Bill smiled at Jo, watching her go into her dorm. He thought to himself, Man was Jo one of the best woman that he has ever met! A/N: Yeah, This chapter is a little short, but I just wanted to end this chapter well. Next chapter I will try my hardest to make longer. Also, sorry if I made any of the characters OOC, I didn't intend on it, and I'm not a professional writer, so please cut me a little slack. ~ TwistingFury[Chapter 2] The next day Jo opened the door to her dorm, only to find Bill standing there waiting for her. He smiled at her. ''Hey Jo!'' Jo greeted him, ''Hey Bill. We can walk to class if you want.'' The two headed towards class only to be greeted by everyone else in Bill's gang. Everyone took there seats, and the professor started her teaching. Jo listened to everything that she was saying, and her and Bill started to take notes. Behind Jo, Jonas sat, trying hard to focus on listening to the professor and taking notes. Hearing Dusty snore a little, Jonas nudged on his shoulder, saying, ''Hey Dusty, are you even paying attention? This stuff is important.'' Dusty woke up, half awake. ''Huh? Oh yeah dude, something about updrafts and downdrafts.'' He then fell back to sleep. Jonas sat there, glancing at the paper and pencil, but he also looked at Jo. Man was she beautiful! He had only known Jo for a day, but he already knew that Jo was an awesome person. He made sure that no one saw him taking peeks at her, as he didn't want to be embarrassed. His wish came true, everyone in the class had heard a loud thud from Dusty's chair that had fell over, due to him sleeping in class. Dusty came to his senses, and he picked up his chair, acting causally as if nothing happened, despite hearing everyone in the class laughing at him. The professor approached Dusty. ''Mr. Davis, mind explaining to me how this happened? Did you even pay attention to our lecture?'' Dusty looked into the professor's eyes, telling her causally, ''It's the suck zone.'' She looked at him, and shook her head, ''The suck zone? really? This must be a figment of your active imagination.'' She huffed. The class continued to laugh. ''No really, It's the point in which the twister... Sucks you up! That's the suck zone.'' The professor put her hand to her temple, annoyed, and she told everyone, ''Class dismissed! I'll see you all on Monday! Please be sure you study for the exam this weekend.'' Everyone got up, and Jo walked with her friends into the lunch room, sitting with them once again. Dusty was exhausted a little, and had a giant plate of food, Jonas sat next to Dusty who was across from Jo. Like yesterday, Bill sat next to Jo, but he had left. Jo had no clue where he went, so she asked Dusty, ''Do you always get that much food?'' Dusty looked at her, ''Yeah man. A dudes got to eat.'' Bill had once again got Jo a lunch. She didn't mind at all, but she told him that next time she would get her own lunch. Jonas stared at Jo, man was she amazing. He sighed and he put his head down on the table, in fear of him being seen, checking her out. Dusty nudged him, ''Yo, Jonas. Are you alright man?'' Jonas came to his senses, and he looked at Dusty puzzled, telling him. ''I'm fine. Just tired.'' Dusty replied, ''Oh, man, you need to try this. This will keep you wide awake, works with me.'' Dusty handed him a ice cold beer from under the table. ''Uh, Thanks man.'' He told his friend. Dusty was crazy... He thought, but everyone thought that about Dusty. ''Oh dudes, I was just thinking, how about I have a party, and all of you guys can come!'' Dusty told them. Everyone nodded, except Jo. ''I'd love to come! But the exam... and I have to study...'' Bill assured her, ''Don't worry about it Jo. The dust man always holds his parties on Saturdays, so you'll still have Sunday to study. So are you in?'' Jo smiled at him, ''Well, If I'll still have an extra day to study, then count me in!'' Dusty finished writing his address down, and he handed it to Bill. ''Sweet dudes!'' The end of the day came, and the party was tomorrow night. Bill walked Jo to her dorm. ''See you Tomorrow night Jo.'' He told her, giving her a pat on the shoulder. Jo blushed a little, then she turned to Bill. ''See you Tomorrow night Bill.'' She headed into her dorm. Bill walked off, seeing Jonas in the distance. He approached him, placing his hand on his shoulder. Jonas looked at Bill, and he asked him,''Howdy Bill. Is everything alright?'' Bill sighed. ''Hey Jonas, are you alright man? It just seems that you might be a little Jealous that I hang out with Jo alot. I'm your friend, and I just wanted to make sure that everything is cool.'' Jonas was surprised at Bill's response. Him, Jonas Miller, Jealous? How could that be... He knew that both Jo and Bill were his friends, so how could he be possibly Jealous that out of all of them Bill spent the most time with Jo? Unless... No! He didn't like Jo in that way? Did he? He thought that Jo was beautiful, but he didn't want it to be anything more, but maybe he was wrong... Maybe he did, in fact, have feelings for Jo, and maybe it did bother him a bit. After a minute of absolute silence, Jonas replied to Bill, ''I'm just fine Bill. There is nothing to worry about. Me Jealous? Hell no. I just like Jo as a friend, and I know you do to. I wouldn't be jealous in between two of my best friends, so everything is cool, trust me. I'm a part of the gang, remember?'' Bill nodded his head, and he told Jonas, ''Alright then. See you and the rest of the gang tomorrow Jonas. I trust you.'' Jonas watched Bill walk away, then his eyes narrowed. Why the hell would Bill ask him that? Was he on to something that he didn't know about? He walked away towards his dorm room, Thinking, What if he really did like Jo more then a friend? He needed the night to think about what Bill had asked him, wondering if any of what he asked him was true. Tomorrow night came fast, and Jo was getting ready. She wanted to look her best. She wore her best T- shirt and grabbed her cap which her father had worn years ago. The hat was very special to her. She heard a knock on her door, and she went to open the door. There Bill was waiting for her, He looked his best too. Man, was he handsome... She thought. ''Hey Bill! You look great.'' She told him. Bill smiled, and replied, ''Hey Jo! You look amazing too. I was wondering if you would like to ride with me?'' Jo answered him, ''Or you could ride with me? It seems I never do enough.'' Bill nodded his head, and Jo drove off towards the address. Dusty lived in a small farm house, but that was alright. Her and Bill walked up towards the door, and Dusty answered the door. ''Hey man! Glad you guys could make it, here, have a drink.'' He told them, handing them beer. Jo and Bill took the beer, and they sat down on the couch, chatting with Rabbit and Sanders, who had arrived before they did. Jonas sat in the chair, thinking of what he could add to the conversation. His brother Jessie, sat on the other side of him, chatting with Dusty. Beltzer and Haynes got up and ordered pizza for the gang, and then everyone else hanged out outside, chatting with each other and hanging out until they came back with the Pizza. Jonas got up, and he started to walk around the yard, then he found Dusty by the pool, and he asked him if he could take a breather, as in walking around the neighborhood. Jonas left the yard, and he started to walk down the road. His brother Jessie followed him. ''Hey bro, where are you going? This party is rocking awesome!'' Jonas turned to his brother, and he shook his head. ''Not now, Jessie. I need a moment to think. I just want to be left alone for a bit, can I even have a moment of piece before you screw it up?'' He huffed. Jessie scoffed at his brother, ''Sounds fun.'' He said sarcastically. ''Whatever bro. But you are missing out.'' Jonas watched his brother head back towards the house, and Jonas continued his walk down the road. He would come back soon. He just needed to think... Then he'd know what to do... Or would he? A/N: I think I did a little bit better on this chapter. Again, sorry if I made some of the characters OCC, I'm trying my best, and I don't intend on any mess ups. I'm not a professional writer, and I love to write stories for fun. The next Chapter does switch to POV, Jona's point of view to be exact. I hope you guys are enjoying the story. For anyone wondering, Jessie is my FC, which is Jona's brother. Remember, If you don't like the theories I portray in this story, please stop reading this story and hit the back button, that's why it exists. Thank you!~ TwistingFury[Chapter 3] Jona's POV: I walked farther down the road, hands in my pocket. I looked up, and saw towering Thunderheads in the distance, lightning flashing all around me. The thunder rolled through the Oklahoma skies. It made me wonder, things I couldn't even explain. I thought about what Bill asked me yesterday, and I was starting to think that it was true, especially after seeing Jo at the party. What if I did like Jo more then just a friend? What problems would that cause if I did like her? I mean, Beltzer and Haynes are dating, they are part of our gang, yet there is no problems about them being together. But what if Bill had feelings for Jo too, and liked her more then a friend? That would be an issue. I mean, I do think Jo is beautiful, and I do know that I like her as a friend, but if it is true, and I do like her more then a friend, I need to know what I'm going to do. I walked towards a small pond, and I started to throw stones into the pond, seeing my own reflection in the pond. I sat down. The storm was coming closer, and soon I would need to head back. While I was sitting, I couldn't take my mind off of her. I smiled to myself, then I stopped, and my eyes grew wide. It was true! Bill was right! Maybe I was a little jealous of him hanging out with her a lot, because I liked her more then a friend! My jealously wasn't bad enough to ruin all of our friendships, as I was quiet about it. I do have feelings for Jo, I'm just wondering if she feel's the same. I really should make my move... But how? I might give it a little while to tell her, I mean, I've only known her for about 2 days. I got up, and started to head back towards Dusty's house, where my brother, Jessie, let me back inside the house. ''Sounds like you had a fun walk.'' He told me, Sarcastically. I answered him, Annoyed with how he always uses sarcasm with me.''Really, Jessie? You just had to be sarcastic...'' I rolled my eyes at him. Brothers... I thought. ''Ah come on, Bro... You really need to learn how take sarcasm.'' He told me. The pizza arrived, and I sat down next to Sanders. We could hear the raging storm approach in the distance. It was just a small thunderstorm. ''Oh yeah, Dudes, I forgot to tell you guys that some of you guys might have to share a room or sleep on the couch.'' Dusty told us. ''Sounds fine by me.'' I told him. Dusty walked over to the CD player, and he turned on the music. Music started to blast out of the speakers, and I heard him tell everyone, ''Alright, Time to take this party to the next level, Haha!'' I thought to myself, and I looked at Jo in the distance. This was my chance! ''Come on Jonas.'' I told myself. ''Make your move.'' I started to walk over to her, seeing colorful lights flash around me, due to the disco ball that was attached to the ceiling. I took a deep breath and I gulped. My heart raced out of my chest. ''Uh... Hey Jo. I was wondering if you would like to have this dance?'' I asked her shyly, reaching my hand out to her. Before she responded, I heard and saw Bill. ''Hey Jo, Can I have this dance?'' Jo nodded, and she took his hand. She turned to me. ''Aw, Sorry Jonas. I'd love to, but Bill asked me to dance with him. Maybe after?'' I nodded her an ok, and then Bill told me, ''Sorry Jonas. I hope you don't mind if I steal her from you for a second.'' I nodded at him and told him, ''No, It's completely alright. I don't mind at all.'' I lied to Bill. I did mind, and it did bother me... I was just about to have a dance with Jo, but I was too late... I sat down and grabbed a beer. Maybe a drink would calm me down. ''Dammit!'' I said to myself quietly. ''I was too fucking late!'' I watched everyone else dance in the distance, I felt left out... If only Bill hadn't came in and ruined everything, I could of been there in his place instead of him, dancing with Jo. I watched Jo dance with Bill, Damn was she an awesome dancer! I was mesmerized by her moves. Jo and Bill continued to dance for awhile, but Unfortunately, I never did get to dance with Jo. I drank quite a few beers, and I decided that it was time for me to quit for the night. Rabbit Approached me. ''Hey Jonas. How come you weren't on the dance floor? It was so fun!'' He told me. I sighed, telling him. ''Hey. I'm sorry, I just didn't feel in the mood to dance.'' Rabbit started to head back to the dance floor. ''Alright. But you're missing out.'' He told me. Everyone else continued to dance for a little while longer, and I was getting kinda sleepy. To be honest, I think that everyone was starting to get a little drunk, thanks to Dusty. I looked on my watch. It was 12:00 AM. I walked towards Jo, I was going to ask her if she would share the last room that was left, otherwise I'd sleep on the couch. I needed to try and make my move again. But before I could say anything, there was Bill again. I heard what he asked her, ''Hey Jo. I was wondering if you wanted to share the last available room that is left with me?'' Damn It Bill! I thought to myself. That was just what I was going to ask her, but you beat me to it. Jo smiled at him, ''Sure! That would be perfect.'' I walked off, and I sat on the chair, next to my brother. ''Hey Bro!'' He greeted. ''Hey Jessie.'' I replied. ''Some party huh? It was so amazing! Best party that I ever had been too.'' Jessie exclaimed. I looked at my brother. ''Yeah.'' I sighed. ''Well, Night Brother. I'm heading to bed. '' He told me, yawning loudly. Soon, I was pretty much the only one up, Besides Rabbit and Dusty. They watched scary movies, and I joined them. We were watching Jurassic Park. I looked at my watch again, and now it read, 4:55 AM. I couldn't sleep at all that night. All of the sudden I heard the wind howl outside, Rain hit the window hard, and saw flashes of lightning... Oh no! Was there a stronger storm that was approaching?... A/N: I'm not good at POV's so sorry if things are off, and also, sorry if some characters are OOC, I don't intend on making them that way. I'm not a professional writer, I write stories for fun. Looks like things are starting to heat up. ~ TwistingFury[Chapter 4] A/N: Finally, after months of inactivity I am finally able to update this story, and post this chapter. Man, I am such a procrastinator. In this chapter, there is no point of view from any character. I just thought that I would get that out there. The Italic font in this chapter is supposed to represent a flash back. Jonas was pretty much the only one up, Besides Rabbit and Dusty. They were watching many different scary movies, ''Jurassic Park'' was one of them. Jonas looked down at his watch again, and now it read, 4:55 AM. Jonas couldn't sleep at all that night. All of the sudden Jonas heard the wind howl outside, Rain hit the window hard, and he saw flashes of lightning... Oh no! Was there a stronger storm that was approaching?... 4 hours before... It was now 12:55 AM. Jo and Bill headed up the stairs and made their way towards the end of hallway. Both were very tired, and a little but drunk. Jo opened the door to the room, and set her and Bill's stuff down in the corner of the room. She then sat down at the end of the bed. ''Some party, huh?'' She asked Bill. Bill sat down next to her, and he replied, ''Yeah. Yes it is. It was a great one.'' Jo smiled at him, then she got up. ''Well, It's late. I better be heading to bed. I have to study tomorrow. Good night Bill.'' But before she could move any further, Bill planted his lips firmly on Jo's. Jo's Aqua colored eyes grew wide. She wasn't expecting that at all. Bill parted from Jo, and he put his hand to his temple. ''Whoa. What a night. I am so sorry that I did that, I mean we just met a few days ago.'' Jo was still shocked from what Bill did, but she caught her breath and put her hand on his shoulder. ''Hey, It's alright. We probably drank a little to much. We will most likely forget about it in the morning. We just got caught up in the heat of the moment is all, well, you did.'' Bill nodded his head, then he climbed up the ladder to the top bunk of the bunk bed. ''Well, good night Jo. I will see you in the morning.'' He yawned. Jo climbed under the covers of the bottom bunk, She yawned and told Bill, ''Good night to you too Bill. I am glad that we are friends.'' Jo then turned off the lamp in the room, and the room turned into total darkness. 4:55 AM... ''What the hell?'' Jonas grunted, as he got up from the couch. He made his way towards one of the windows in Dusty's house, and he looked out of it. Something wasn't right. He felt a bad pit in his stomach, Jonas knew that something bad was going to happen! He turned his head, and he ordered Dusty, ''Dusty, you need to check the radar. Something isn't right about this storm. I think we might be in danger, Just in case we are, I need Rabbit to help me wake up the others.'' Rabbit came to his senses, while Dusty went to check the radar. ''Yes, Jonas.'' He replied. ''I'll go wake up Jo and Bill.'' Jonas told them. Meanwhile, Bill had just woke up, hearing the roaring thunder outside, and hearing the rain pelt the windows really hard. He heard the howling wind outside. It was total darkness from inside the room, but he felt that something bad was going to happen. ''What the hell is going on...'' Not long after, he heard a knock on the door, He heard Jonas's voice say, ''Bill, Jo! Wake up! We got to move, NOW!'' Bill shifted his body and he sat up. ''Jonas? What is going on here? Is something wrong?'' Jonas heard Dusty come up the stairs, and he went to get the others to wake up, telling Jonas that there is a Tornado Warning. ''Dudes! We got to go now! The suck zone is heading right for us!'' Jonas, reworded what Dusty had said, ''There is a tornado warning, and it is heading right for us! If we don't get underground now, everyone of us will, die, and I don't want any of my friends to die, we are a team, remember?'' Bill's eyes widened, he called to Jo. ''Jo, wake up! There is a tornado heading our way, we got to leave, Now!'' Jo came to her senses, and she turned on the lamp light, Her heart racing out of her chest. She was scared, no matter how much she denied it. This reminded her of the night her father died, but only this time, she might lose herself or her friends, instead of her father, and like that time, she would be an adult instead. Bill climbed down the ladder, and he grabbed Jo's arm. ''Wait, my father's hat!'' Bill pulled her forward and told her, ''There is no time Jo! We must leave now, or we will die! We will come back for it after the storm passes!'' They Followed Jonas, and everyone else down the stairs, and out the back door. Everyone was racing for their lives, as they could hear the tornado come closer to them. Jo started to have a flash back while they were running for safety. A lot went through her mind, she was so scared right now. ''I can't hold it any longer!'' Jo heard her father say, as he was giving his all to keep the cellar door shut, so he could protect his family from the monster tornado that was raging outside. Jo was so scared, and she could hear her dog, Toby bark really loud. She held her dog tightly. Not long after, her father could no longer hang on to the door any longer, and the F5 Tornado tore the door clean off it's hinges, and her father, along with the door, was sucked up into the vortex, never being seen again. Jo screamed and cried when she saw her father get sucked up into the funnel, she wanted to follow him, to try and get him back, but her mother held her back, holding her tight. Toby continued to bark very loudly. ''I am so scared right now, Bill.'' Jo admitted to Bill, after shaking her head from the horrible flash back she had. ''I know you are Jo, I could just tell. We will make to shelter, I promise.'' Bill assured her. The others on the team had already climbed into the storm shelter, all except Jonas, Jessie, Jo and Bill. Dusty started to close the door to the underground cellar, and Haynes went up to Him, telling Dusty, ''Are you crazy? Our friends are still out there, and you are just going to close the door?'' Beltzer went up to Haynes, and he put his hand on her shoulder, signaling her to come and sit down, away from the cellar door. The others looked around at each other. Sanders spoke up, ''Yeah Dusty. What about Jo and Bill? We can't just leave them out there.'' Rabbit added on, ''Yeah and what about Jonas and Jessie. We are missing them too.'' Dusty sighed. ''Yo, Guys, I am sorry dudes, but the suck zone is coming closer to us, and they will not make it here in time. If I don't shut the cellar door now, we will all die.'' He then shut the cellar door, and moved towards the back of the cellar, along with everyone else. Bill and Jo were racing closer to the shelter, they could see it, but Bill noticed that the shelter's door was closed. Before they could move any further, A huge tree fell in front of them, blocking their path to safety. ''You were saying?'' Jo told Bill, annoyed. Bill looked around, trying to find another path to safety. He grew quiet. He could see no other way, he thought that they would be doomed, just when he was about to tell Jo what was going to happen to them, Jonas and Jessie saw them. They were not far behind Jo and Bill. Jonas spoke up, ''Jo, Bill, follow me and Jessie. I know this neighbor hood, I've walked down it earlier yesterday, there is a pit not too far away from us, we can make it there in time, but we've got to hurry.'' The four raced east of the tree that was blocking there path, and Jonas and Jessie led Jo and Bill to a Storm drain, which was not that far east from Dusty's storm shelter. The tornado was coming closer to them, and the four lept into the shelter. Bill went near Jo, and started to cover her head. Jonas was on the other side of her, Protecting his face, Jesse moved towards the end of the storm drain, and put his head down, Bill followed soon after. ''Hang on everyone.'' Bill assured them. 5:00 AM... The tornado now passed over the storm drain, the winds were picking up, and the winds roared so loud, that you couldn't hear anyone scream over them. Jo's eyes clenched shut, and she shivered in fear, Bill could feel her tremble, from beside her, Jonas could feel it too. He assured Jo, ''You'll be alright Jo. The storm is almost over. We will be fine.'' He knew that over the sound of the howling wind and pelting hail, that Jo wouldn't be able to hear him, but he wanted to let her know that, even if she couldn't hear what he had just told her. Jo, Jonas, Bill and Jessie could hear the tornado pick up something an toss it around like a toy. They saw a Truck slam onto the storm drain's entrance, which had moved the lid over the entrance, jamming it in place. The winds had started to die down, the Tornado was over now. Jo shifted her body and she sat up, catching her breath, and letting her heart rate calm down. ''I think it is over.'' She told everyone. ''Is everyone alright? That was some storm.'' Jessie asked everyone. Bill got up, and he answered, ''Yeah, I think everyone is fine. The storm is over now.'' Bill added. He turned to Jo, and he helped her up. ''Are you alright Jo? You seemed like you were frightened.'' Jo sighed, ''I am just fine. I was just startled was all.'' Jonas got up, he told Jo, ''I am so glad that you are alright, Jo. That was a wild storm.'' Bill butted in after Jonas spoke, ''Yeah. I am just glad that we all made it out alive.'' 5:05 AM... Dusty opened up the cellar door. Everyone started to climb out of the storm shelter, one after one, Dusty left the shelter first. Everything around him was destroyed, but that wasn't his and everyone else's main worry, Where was Jo, Bill, Jonas, and Jessie? Did they even survive the tornado by getting to safety? ''Oh my god!'' Beltzer exclaimed, holding on to Haynes hand. ''There is not much left.'' She added. Rabbit sighed,''This must have been an F4 Tornado.'' Dusty started to walk east, ''Jo? Bill? Jonas? Jessie? Dude, where are you guys? Are you alright?'' He called out, but he heard no answers. He was starting to get really worried. He didn't want the gang to be broken up. Bill was his best friend, ever since he was younger. (Elementary school, to be exact.) Dusty gave his other friends orders, ''Yo, Listen up you guys. I want everyone to split up and try to look for Bill and the others. Me, Rabbit, and Sanders will head east. Beltzer and Haynes can head up towards the house and the front yard, maybe there is hope that they are up there.'' The groups parted ways, and Dusty and them headed east to try and look for Jo, Bill, Jessie, and Jonas. Meanwhile, in the storm drain, Bill started to climb up the ladder to the way out of the storm drain, only to find out that they were trapped inside, and that the lid wouldn't budge. ''Ah shit! The lid is Jammed shut! We are tapped in here.'' Bill cursed, He didn't mean for Dusty's party to end this way. He wanted everyone to enjoy the party and stay safe, and now, they might be trapped in there for a long time and die. He especially never meant to put Jo in any harm. He really wished that he would of just let her not go and stay at her dorm to study. ''My god, this is all my fault.'' He whispered. He made his way down to the bottom of the storm drain, and he saw everyone else start to panic. ''Everybody calm down.'' Bill ordered them. Everyone grew silent. Jo added in to Bill's conversation. ''Bill's right. I am sure that the others will come and look for us.'' Jonas asked Jo and Bill, ''And if they don't? We will find a way out, right?'' Jo looked down and sighed, ''Then I don't know what is going to happen to us.'' She looked up at the blocked storm drain entrance, hoping that her friends would find them soon. Bill gave everyone a task. ''Alright, listen up. Me and Jo are going to find another way out going to our east, I want Jessie to go and see if He can find a way out of here to our west, and Jonas, I got a special job for you. Stay right here if anyone comes and calls for help.'' Jonas nodded his head, and Bill continued, ''That way you can yell at them, letting them know that we are here, and safe.'' Everyone started to head their own ways, and Jonas watched them leave. Man, Why did Bill always have to butt in and steal Jo from him, whenever he wants to spend time with her, or ask her something? He shook his head, then he sat down, hoping that someone would find them soon... A/N: Dun, Dun, Dun. xD I am so evil, am I? I left this at a cliff hanger, so ya'll will have to guess what happens to them until I post Chapter 5. Sorry if any of the characters seem OOC, I haven't written anything in months, so my story writing skills are a little shot at the moment.[Chapter 5] 5:10 AM Meanwhile, while Bill, Jo, Jessie, and Jonas were hoping for help, Beltzer and Haynes had made their way towards Dusty's house, they were following Dusty's orders, and were looking for their friends. They saw that there was not much left of Dusty's house, which they just had a blast at the party just a few hours ago. ''Oh my god. There is nothing left of his house, seriously!'' Beltzer exclaimed. Haynes looked around in disbelief, and she told Beltzer, ''How does Dusty expect us to find Jo and the others here, there is nothing. I don't know where they could of hid. Oh Beltzer, I think they might be...'' Beltzer, held her tight, and assured her, ''Dead? No, No, dear. Don't think that. I haven't lost hope. They can't be dead, they just can't be. Come on, let's keep on looking.'' The two then continued their search. To the east of Beltzer and Haynes, Dusty, Rabbit, and Sanders were making their way down the neighborhood. The Tornado could of carried them down there. ''Man, where could they be?'' Rabbit asked, very worried. ''We've searched for minutes and we still haven't found them or heard there voice.'' Dusty was trying to think long and hard about where they would of taken shelter at when the tornado hit. Sanders interrupted Dusty's moment of silence, saying, ''What about the storm drain guys. Seems like a legit place to hide from a tornado.'' Dusty thought that is where they would have most likely hid, since the storm drain is underground. ''Alright dudes. Let's head towards the storm drain.'' The group then walked farther down the road, hoping that they would find there friends soon. They came to a stop above the hill, and saw the storm drain. ''There's the storm drain! Let's see if they are there.'' Dusty told them, then they moved closer to the storm drain. There was a car blocking the entrance down the storm drain. Sanders sighed, ''Aw man. Now how are we going to know they are here? A car is blocking the way to them.'' Dusty wasn't going to give up, so he yelled, ''Jo, Bill, Jonas, Jessie? Are you down there dudes?'' 5:30 AM Jonas had heard sounds coming from outside the storm drain. He had just thought he heard his name, he stood up, and called, ''Hello, is there anyone out there? Dusty, is that you?'' Dusty could finally hear one of them in the storm drain, it sounded like it was Jonas. ''Yeah it is us. We have come to get you out of there. Hang on. Is everyone alright?'' The rest of the team was delighted to hear that they were found. Jonas replied, ''Yes, we are all alright. Let me get the others and tell them that you are here.'' Jonas started to go east and look for his friends to tell them that they had been found. Meanwhile, Jo and Bill where making there way back with no luck of finding the other way out. \"I can't believe that there isn't another way out of here.\" Bill sighed. Jo turned to him, \"I can't believe it either. This was a complete disaster.\" All of a sudden, they could hear Jonas yell for them. \"Jonas?\" They exclaimed. \"What's going on? Did someone find us?\" Bill asked him. Jonas approached them, trying to catch his breath. \"Yeah. Dusty found us. They are trying to go get help right away.\" Bill smiled, \"Alright. Let's go!\" The three made there way back to the Storm drain's enterance. Jessie was already there waiting for them. \"You guys made it back just in time. They will be here to help us in just a few minutes.\" They could all hear loud noises coming from outside the Storm drain, the truck had been moved, and the lid was now removed. \"You guys can all climb out now.\" Rabbit called to them. Relieved, all of them climbed out of the Storm drain, one by one. They were so glad to just be alive. They all gave each other a hug. \"Where is Beltzer and Haynes?\" Jo asked Dusty. Dusty replied, \"They are up near the house. We should probably head back up there to see them.\" They all started to head up towards what was left of Dusty's house. Beltzer and Haynes could see everyone else head towards them. They couldn't believe their eyes. Jo, Bill, Jonas and Jessie were alive! \"I can't believe it. You guys are alive.\" Haynes told Jo, smiling at the fact that they were alright. Jo sighed, trying to catch her breath. \"Yeah. We are. Thank goodness. That was a close one.\" She then turned away and looked at what was left of Dusty's house. \"Oh my god. There is nothing left. Your house is totally destroyed, Dusty.\" Dusty sighed. He had no idea where he was going to live now. \"Yeah. Guess I am going to have to share a dorm with one of you dudes.\" Jo rested her hand on Dusty's shoulder, then she made her way through the rubble. \"Has anyone seen my father's hat?\" She called. 6:00 AM Jonas heard Jo ask about the hat, but he didn't reply. He wanted to surprise her and find the hat before Bill does. Where could that hat be? It has to be around here somewhere. Jonas thought to himself. He made his way through the rubble, but still no sign of Jo's fathers hat. \"Come on... That damn hat has to be around here somewhere...\" He cursed under his breath. Finally he spotted it. It was resting in a tree, untouched by the tornados wrath. \"Finally! This is my chance.\" He whispered, so that no one could hear him. Little did Jonas know, he wasn't the only one who spotted Jo's hat. \"I found it!\" A voice called. Jonas knew this voice sounded familiar. It was Bill. Jo turned her head and let out a smile showing relief. She was glad her father's hat wasn't lost forever. \"Awesome. Thanks Bill.\" Jona's heart sunk in his chest. He wanted to climb that tree to retrieve her hat. He wanted to see the look on Jo's face when he gave the hat back to her. He hated Bill so much right now. He grew even more angrier as he observed Bill climb the tree to retrieve the hat. He was so close. So fucking close, but Bill had to ruin it yet again. Jonas turned away, and he made his way towards the others, not letting anyone know that he was angered. \"Here you go Jo. I thought you might be missing this.\" Bill told Jo, smiling brightly, his grey blue eyes staring into hers. Jo smiled at him, taking the hat from his hands. She placed the hat on her head after cleaning it off. \"Thank you so much Bill. I thought my hat was lost forever. I am glad it isn't.\" Jo then gave Bill a hug that warmed his heart. \"Your welcome Jo.\" He replied, holding her close. 6:10 AM Everyone said there goodbyes, and most of them hailed a cab because their vehicles were destroyed by the Tornado. The only car that was untouched was Jo's. Jo climbed into her truck, and her and Bill headed back towards campus. He walked with her up to her dorm room. \"I'll see you tomorrow then?\" Jo asked Bill. Bill looked down at the ground, then gazes at Jo.\"Yeah. Hey, about last night. I am sorry about that kiss. It was a heat of the moment type thing. I didn't mean to make you feel uncomfortable. \" He apologized. Jo placed her hand on his shoulder and looked into his eyes, \"Hey, It's alright. I forgive you. See you tomorrow.\" She then headed into her dorm room to study. Bill grinned, then he turned away and made his way towards his dorm. A/N: That is all for now guys. Sorry if everyone seems a little out of character, I ran into writers block during this chapter. I am very glad that I finally was able to finish this chapter. ~ TwistingFury[Chapter 6] A/N: Finally I update this story! And yes, this chapter is about Jonas. ^^ I'm sorry if some of the characters are a little out of character and that is chapter is a little short. :( My writing skills have slipped a little, but I tried my best. ~ TwistingFury The next day Jo got up and headed towards class. As usual, Bill walked with her to class. ''Alright class! I hope you all had a wonderful weekend, but now it is time to take your exams.'' The professor told them. She passed around papers to everyone in the class. Time seemed to go by fairly slowly, but Jo was focusing hard on the exams in front of her, hardly paying any attention to anything else. Finally the time was up and everyone had passed their exams up towards the professor. Jo was fairly confident that she would get a good grade on them. Jonas on the other hand, seemed to not be focused, so he figured he'd flunk his exams. Soon the bell had rang, and everyone got up to head towards lunch. Bill walked with Jo and everyone else, but Jonas trailed behind them. Bill could sense this, so he looked back at Jonas. ''Hey Jonas! You coming?'' Jonas peered into Bill's gray blue eyes and told him, ''Thanks for the offer Bill, but no thanks. I think today I much rather sit alone.'' Bill shrugged, and he followed Jo and his other friends. Jonas sat a couple of tables behind Jo and the rest of his friends. Meanwhile, at Bill's table, the gang was wondering why Jonas didn't show up to sit with them, especially Jonas's older brother, Jessie. ''Hey where's my bro? He usually always sits with us.'' Dusty shrugged. ''I don't know man. I don't get why he wouldn't want to sit with us, especially after the fucking awesome party we had a couple nights ago!'' He replied. Dusty continued, ''Even though my place was trashed by that twister.'' Bill looked over at Jessie. ''I wouldn't worry about him Jessie. I'm sure he'll come around.'' Jessie sighed, he looked over at all of his friends. ''Yeah I guess you have a point. I think I'm going to go to talk to him though.'' He then got up to go and look for his brother. Jessie eventually found Jonas. He was sitting at the other end of the table, away from other people. Jessie could see that Jonas barely touched any of his lunch. ''Hey bro.'' He greeted. Jonas let out a scoff, and asked him annoyed, ''What do you want, Jessie?'' Jessie rolled his eyes, clearly irritated with his brother's snide remark. ''There's no need to get snippy with me, man. I just said hey.'' Jonas glared at his brother, then he sighs. ''Sorry brother. I'm just in a really bad mood right now.'' Jessie sits down right next to Jonas. ''Do you want to talk about it?'' He asks. Jonas was so furious right now. He didn't want his brother to know what was really going on with him. That he was angry at Bill. Over Jo! He needed to think of an easy white lie. ''Sure I guess.'' Jessie looked over at his brother. ''What's wrong?'' He asked him. ''I don't know. I must be going through a case of depression. I should be fine though. I just need to be left be for awhile.'' Before anything else could be said, the bell rang for everyone to head back to their classes. ''Thank goodness.'' Jonas huffed under his breath so no one could hear him. The rest of the day Jonas remained avoidant of everyone, including his brother. No one could figure out why Jonas was acting this way, except for Jessie. Towards the end of the day, when everyone started to leave the campus, with Dusty usually being the first to leave, Bill went to find Jonas. Jonas just wanted to get to his dorm room as soon as possible. He needed to think about things. He wanted to try to avoid confrontation. Unfortunately, Bill had found him. ''Hey Jonas, may I speak to you for a moment?'' A familiar voice had called. Great. Just great. ''Yeah. What's up?'' Jonas replied, facing him. ''Are you alright? I've noticed that you've been hanging by yourself today. It's not like you.'' Bill asked, placing his hand on Jonas's shoulder. Jonas huffed, ''I'm fine. Just wanted to be alone for awhile. No one did anything wrong. I'm just in a bad mood.'' Then without another word, Jonas continued on his way to his dorm room. Bill was left puzzled, but he respected Jonas's decision. That night, without any storms in the area, Jonas decided that he would head out on the town, maybe that would clean out his head. He hailed a cab and headed out around Norman. His first stop? A steakhouse. He was famished, and needed to try to eat. Maybe he'd take Dusty's advice and grab a beer while he was at it. After he had his fill of Steak and mashed potatoes and gravy, he took a cab off to Norman's park. It had a lovely pond that he could sit by while pondering on his thoughts. The winds rustled through the giant oak trees, creating a peaceful environment for him. Jonas sat down by the pond and started to chuck stones into it. ''I just don't understand. How come whenever I want to talk or hang out with Jo, Bill is always there to ruin it?'' He told himself. ''It's almost like he knows that I want something to do with her.'' He continued. All was silent. This is just silly. Talking to myself is just crazy. Jonas thought to himself. He needed to think of a plan to finally get some alone time with Jo. Finally an idea came to his head. ''I know! I'll wait until after Bill walks Jo over to her dorm, then I'll knock on it and see if she wants to spend a night on the town with me.'' He exclaimed. Jonas then got up and made his way out of the park. A cab came and took him back to The University of Oklahoma. Exhausted, Jonas entered his dorm and crashed on his bed. He didn't even bother to turn the lights out.[Chapter 7] The following day had finally came, and it passed by fairly quickly. Jonas was excited! He would finally attempt to make his move. Hopefully Bill wouldn't be anywhere nearby to ruin it all once again. Jonas waited until Bill walked away from Jo's dorm to make his move, then he strutted over to Jo's dorm with confidence. He can do this! Jonas gently knocked on her door, and was waiting eagerly to see if she would open it. Jo opened the door to her dorm to see Jonas standing there. Surprised, she says, ''Jonas. What a surprise. What brings you here?'' Jonas was quite nervous, so he rubs his palm on the back of his neck. ''I was wondering, if you're not busy later, I wanted to know if you wanted to hang out in town with me later?'' He asked her. Jo smiled at him. ''Sure! I'm not doing anything later, why not. I'll see you later then.'' Jonas was shocked by Jo's response. Finally! Jonas smiles back at her, then he replies, ''Alright. Sounds great. See you later Jo.'' He then turns and heads back to his dorm. He needed to look his best for tonight. 8:30 PM Jonas heard a knock on his dorm door. That must be her now. He opened the door to see Jo standing out there. Jonas admired her, looking up and down. Damn was she beautiful! ''Jo. I have to say you are looking beautiful tonight.'' Jonas comments, shyly. Jo looked into Jonas's emerald green eyes. ''Thank you. You don't look so bad yourself, Jonas.'' The two hailed a cab into Norman, and Jonas took Jo out into the park. Jonas stopped by a patch of red roses and picked one of them for Jo. ''Uh.. Here you go Jo. I thought you might like one.'' Jonas told her shyly, standing up to give her the rose. Jo took the rose from his hand and smiled at him. ''Oh. Thank you Jonas. That is very kind of you.'' The two continued walking through the park. They grabbed some coffee' and sat beside the pond, talking for awhile about what they've been learning lately in class about storms. Soon it started to get really late, so Jo turned to Jonas and told him, ''Well it was really nice hanging out with you, Jonas. I think we should be heading back.'' Jonas nodded at Jo's response. ''Yeah it was. I think we should head back now. Thanks for hanging out with me.'' Jo got up and told him, ''You're welcome.'' The two then started to head back. 10:00 PM They hailed a cab back to the campus and Jonas walked Jo back to her dorm. Jo turned to Jonas. ''Thanks for hanging out with me once again. I had fun.'' She tells him, suddenly embracing him. Jonas blushed. He couldn't believe that this was happening! That Jo was hugging him. He held her in his arms for a few seconds, then breaking the embrace, he replies, ''No problem Jo. I had a blast too. We should hang out again sometime.'' Jo smiles at him. ''Yeah we should. See you tomorrow Jonas.'' Jonas walks away from Jo's dorm. Smiling to himself. He'd never forget this night for sure. Little did he know that Jessie was near by, probably also coming back from a night on the town. ''Jonas? What are you doing out this late?'' Jonas turns towards the familiar voice. Oh shit! It was his brother! ''Jessie? What are you doing out this late?'' He calls. Jessie catches up to Jonas and says, ''Oh I was TOTALLY getting Wasted. No shit! I was out in town for a bit. Never mind that. My question is WHY were YOU out this late?'' Great. Jessie and his sarcastic comments. Did he really have to tell his brother why he was out this late? He doesn't answer him. Jessie rolled his eyes, obviously annoyed that Jonas was walking away from him. He leapt out in front of Jonas, keeping him from moving any further. He needed an explanation for all of this. ''Why does it matter?'' Jonas asks Jessie, clearly annoyed. ''Oh I get it. You were totally out with her.'' Jonas stops, shocked with his brother's response. How the hell did he know? ''You like her, don't you?'' Jessie continued, still eager to hear his brother's answer. ''Out with who?'' Jonas asked, trying to play coy. Jessie put his hand on his temple. ''Jo.'' Jonas huffed, ''Yes, I was out with Jo. No it's not what you think brother. I was just hanging out with her, that doesn't mean I like her or anything.'' Jonas, not wanting to hear another word, kept on walking towards his dorm. ''Whatever you say bro.'' Jessie called. Jonas entered his dorm room and sat down on his bed. How did Jessie know? Were people slowly catching on?[Chapter 8] A few weeks after Jona's had taken Jo out on the town, the day had finally come for them to all go out on their first storm chase, as an assignment. Everyone was highly excited about this, especially Jo. She would be the ring leader for the entire team, putting Rabbit as her navigator. Jonas had helped Sanders and the others to load up the back of the van with all of their weather equipment and cameras. Finally, it was time for them to try to catch the nearby storm, so Jonas and the others climbed into the back of the beat up van. Jo climbed into the driver's seat, Bill calling shotgun. She drove off onto the Oklahoma highway to the nearby storm in Edmond, Oklahoma. ''Haynes, what have we got on the radar?'' Jo called to her, trying to keep her focus on the road. Haynes came to her senses and looked at the radar screen. A small little supercell was beginning to form near Edmond. It appeared to be growing stronger and it was healthy looking. ''I can see a healthy looking small supercell on radar. Looks like there is some rotation.'' She replies. Jo let out a smile. Maybe they were going to catch this one! A fire began to light up in her bones. ''Wonderful! Haynes, do you think we are going to be able to catch this one?'' She asks. Haynes looks at the radar again, then she turns to Rabbit, who was sitting behind her. ''Yeah we should be able to catch this one if we hurry. Rabbit should know where the best routes to this storm are.'' Haynes answered. Jo nodded her head. ''Rabbit.'' She says, ''What is the quickest and most safest route to this storm?'' Rabbit fumbles through his map books and tries to find the best route. ''Yes boss. Uh the quickest and most safest route would be to just continue north on I-35 and before you know it, we will be in Edmond and from there we should set up on S sooner Rd.'' He continues on, ''If we need to escape, our escape route will be on E charter oak Rd.'' He then closes up the map book. ''Thank you Rabbit. Hang in there guys, we should see a tornado here soon.'' Jo tells the gang. Not long afterwards they arrived in Edmond. But it wasn't peaceful at all! Hail began to fall from the heavens, and the sky turned an eerie green color. Bill peered out of the windshield and noticed the clouds were beginning to rotate. ''If this storm is gonna do anything, it's going to be soon.'' He tells Jo. Not a moment later, Jo could hear the city of Edmond's tornado sirens sound off. It was an eerie sight for sure. Jo continued to drive towards S sooner Rd, hearing the sirens wail in the distance. ''Tornado warning!'' Haynes shouted. ''Beltzer, come look at this!'' She calls to her boyfriend. ''Well, I'll be damned! We've got one!'' He replies in excitement. ''A tornado has been sighted just outside of Edmond. We should be able to see it in a moment.'' Haynes tells Jo. ''Alright guys, let's get this thing! Everyone, set up!'' She instructs everyone. A few minutes afterwards, Jo turns the van on S sooner road. She could see the tornado many miles away tearing up a field. It was a small, grey, stovepipe tornado! ''Alright guys, let's set up, this is our big moment!'' Jo tells her team, excited to see the tornado. Jo climbs out of the van and observes the tornado twisting and turning, it was so beautiful! Nothing at all like the nighttime tornado that hit during Dusty's party nearly a month beforehand. Bill stands next to Jo. He too, was in awe of the tornado's gorgeous sight. Jonas and Jessie helped get some shots of the tornado's fury out upon the open Oklahoma plains, Beltzer and Haynes continued to observe the storm on the radar screen just to make sure that they were still in a safe spot to get some data, Rabbit and Sanders were taking some video of the tornado, and Jo, Bill, and Dusty were measuring the storm using the weather instruments that were provided for them by the professor. The tornado caused no damage to anything around it until it changed coarse and swirled towards a farmhouse. Jo's stomach turned. She went from being overjoyed to being afraid for the people inside the farmhouse. ''Good lord I hope whomever lives inside that farmhouse took shelter.'' Jo says, her voice full of shock. Jo watched the tornado inch closer and closer towards the farmhouse and soon it was no more! The tornado had blew it apart. Haynes had observed the radar again. Then she peers into the open field at the twister. It appeared to have stalled. Bill had noticed it too. ''Jo, I think we should leave. This doesn't feel right.'' Bill tells her, turning towards her. Jo looked into his grey-blue eyes. He was right. Beltzer breaks the silence and tells them, ''Guys! We seriously need to leave right now! This bad boy appears to be changing coarse and is heading right for us, if we don't go now, he'll bury us!'' Jo looks at her teammates. ''You're right. Everyone back into the van. We'll search for another route and continue to track it.'' She commands them. Jo climbed back into the van and waited for everyone to pile back into the van. Once everyone was in, she sped off towards the escape route that Rabbit had given her, on E charter oak Rd. Unfortunately, as soon as she reached the escape route, the twister was gone. ''Okay. I can't see the tornado anymore. I think we are gonna call it a day.'' Bill tells Jo. ''Yeah you are right. Besides, it's starting to get late anyway.'' She replies. Jo began to drive off towards the highway, she should be in Norman within the next hour or so. While on the way back to The University Of Oklahoma, she could hear everyone get excited about their chase today. ''Today's storm was awesome you guys, it had my adrenaline rushing! Woooo!'' Dusty shouted. Sanders let out a laugh. ''Yeah it was great! Totally hope we get to do something like this again!'' He then proceeds to continue watching the footage that he captured of the tornado. ''I think we've done a great job at getting data on this monster.'' Haynes chimed in. Jo let out a smile to herself. She enjoyed this. She turns to Bill, ''What did you think of today Bill?'' She asked him. Bill lets out a chuckle. ''I think today went wonderful. We should get some good data out of this chase I think.'' Two hours went by and everyone had began to go to their dorms. Jo and Bill had just finished talking with their professor, she would check back in with them in the morning to let everyone know how they have done. ''So what now?'' Bill asked her. ''Nothing much. Just going to head on to my dorm. I have to get up early tomorrow.'' Jo replies. Bill thought to himself, maybe he'd ask her out to dinner. ''Hey uh Jo?'' Bill says to her as they were walking to their dorms. ''Yes, Bill?'' She answers. ''I was wondering if tomorrow night you'd like to go to dinner with me?'' He asks her. Jo blushed. She thought it was sweet of him to ask. ''Sure Bill! I'd love to. I'll see you tomorrow. Goodnight.'' Bill let out a smile. ''I'll see ya tomorrow Jo. Goodnight.'' He then walks to his dorm room. Tomorrow is going to be great! He thinks to himself. Then he climbs into his bed and drifts off into a deep sleep.[Chapter 9] A/N: I'm sorry if any characters in this fanfiction are out of character. This fanfiction was meant to take place before the movie. Also I am sorry in the delay of posting new chapters. Writers block sucks. Lol The morning arrived and today Jo and her friends would finally find out how they did on their first storm chase. Jo was completely optimistic about their data. She got up and quickly got around. The same routine went down. Bill would knock on her dorm room door and walk with her to class. \"Good morning class! Please take your seats and I will pass out your grades on your assignment you completed yesterday.\" She instructs them. Jo couldn't wait to see the score. The paper finally landed on her desk and she took a look. A+! She couldn't believe it! She let a grin appear on her face. She then looked up and saw her professor speak. \"Because you guys worked so well on this assignment, I'm allowing you guys to work together on another storm chase. If you continue to do well and receive great data, I may see if a grant for a lab is in order for everyone.\" The day breezed by fairly quickly, and before everyone knew it, the end of the day had came. Bill met up with Jo. \"Hey Jo. You still up for having dinner with me?\" He asks her. Jo turns to him and looks into his grey-blue eyes. \"Yeah I'm still up for it. I'm just going to get around first.\" She tells him. Bill smiles at her. \"That's alright by me. I'll come and pick you up around 6:30.\" A few moments of silence passed as he observes Jo walking towards her dorm room. He was just about to walk towards his dorm room when suddenly, Jessie appears. \"Hey Bill. Have you seen my brother around lately? I've noticed I haven't really seen him apart from class. I'm hoping he is fine.\" He asks Bill. Bill shakes his head. He lets out a sigh. \"I'm sorry Jessie. I haven't really seen him much either. I'm sure he is fine, he's just... Very quiet I suppose. I'm sure, like I've said, he'll come around.\" Jessie frowns. \"Okay. I'm hoping it's soon man. Later Bill.\" He began to walk past Bill. \"Later Jessie.\" Bill then walked into his dorm room to get ready. He wanted to look his best for Jo. The time had finally come. 6:30. He knocked on Jo's dorm room. He waited patiently for her. Jo finally opens the door and Bill couldn't believe it! She looked stunning! \"Ready to go? You are looking beautiful Jo.\" He tells her, complimenting her appearance. Jo smiles at him. \"Why thank you Bill. You are looking Handsome tonight. I'm ready to go.\" She tells him, admiring his appearance. The two hail a taxi to the other side of Norman. \"Where would you like to eat, Jo?\" Bill asks her. Jo had honestly no clue where she wanted to eat, so she tells him that it was up to him to decide. Bill had decided that they would go and eat at a fancy diner. Little did they know, that Jonas was also out on the town. He had been very tense that day, so he figured a night out on the town would do him good. \"This is nice Bill, thank you! You know, you really didn't have to go out of your way to do this for me.\" She tells him. Bill lets out a chuckle and replies saying, \"It was not a problem Jo. I'm happy to be able to spend some time together with you.\" The two were enjoying their dinner and their company with one another, laughter ensuing from the both of them. Jonas was only a few tables away. Drinking some beer and finishing up his Spaghetti. He never realized that Jo and Bill were eating dinner together until he looked up. Seeing them together made his heart drop. Oh shit! He thought. They must be on some kind of date. He observed them being so happy with one another. He felt his blood boil with rage. How dare Bill get another chance with her again! She should be having dinner with me! Jonas gritted his teeth. He couldn't bear it. Calm yourself Jonas. I don't want to make a scene. These thoughts aren't logical and maybe I should leave now. He then sighs and waits for the waitress to take his payment. He needed to leave now. After they had ate, Bill asks Jo, \"Hey, if you don't mind, maybe we can go to the park together. Especially since it is on the way back to the campus.\" Jo replies to him, \"Sure! That is not a bad idea at all. I wouldn't mind spending a bit more extra time with you.\" The waitress takes their check and the two of them hop into the taxi. They finally arrived at the park. The wind was whistling through the trees and Bill and Jo had sat near the pond, tossing stones into it. \"Here you go Jo. I thought you might like it.\" Bill says to her, handing her a red rose that he had picked just for her. \"Oh why thank you Bill. It is a pretty rose.\" She tells him, admiring the rose. Silence reigned between the two for a few minutes. Then Jo spoke. \"So Bill, how do you think our next Storm chase will go?\" She asks him. Bill looks over at her. He leans his head on her shoulder. \"I think we may have a chance. We just have to stay focused and work together as a team. I'm hoping we will get some good data on this next storm we chase.\" The time had eventually come for the two of them to head back to the campus. They would have a big day ahead of them tomorrow. Jonas layed wide awake at night. He could hardly sleep as he had so much on his mind. He turned on his side, letting out a sigh. \"Just what is it going to take for me to win Jo over? Bill is always in the fucking way! What does Bill have that I don't?\" He vents to himself. Jonas realizes that his anger was starting to take over. \"This is not what I wanted to start to feel, but if I don't figure out the soultion to this problem then I'll have no choice.\" The morning came and today would be a huge day. A severe Storm system was forming right in central Oklahoma. Bill and his gang would have a chance at collecting more data. In the classroom, Jo and Bill were looking over radar images and forecast models, trying to figure out where their target area would be. Jonas wasn't too far away from them. I'll just have to impress her on this chase today. That's worth a shot at least. He thought to himself. As the day progressed, a tornado watch had been issued and Jo had ordered the team to get everything ready. They were going to target the Guthrie, Oklahoma area.[Chapter 10] A/N: Finally I actually post another chapter. XD It's been so long since I have updated this fanfic. Sorry to keep you all waiting. I apologize if any of the characters here seem a little bit out of character. It's been awhile since I have written anything. Jo's team had gotten everything ready, so they all pilled into the van. Jo had given everyone a nod, signaling the team that they were ready to go. She started to drive out towards Guthrie, Oklahoma, their target area. Jonas was all the way in the back of the van. He was trying to plot how he was gonna impress Jo on this storm chase. He needed to figure out something. He wasn't going to have Bill win Jo over. He was tired of Bill always getting in the way of him getting closer to her. Jo peered up into her mirror. She had noticed that Jonas was strangely more quiet than usual. ''Everything okay there, Jonas?'' She asked. Bill looked back over his shoulder, looking at Jonas as well. Jonas snapped out of his train of thought. He looked over at Jo. ''Yeah. I'm fine. Just thinking about the types of tornadoes we might see today.'' He told her. That was a lie, and Jonas felt bad for lying to her. Jo had turned her attention back to the road. She entered the freeway, trying to get past the Oklahoma city metro area. ''Rabbit.'' She called. ''Yes boss?'' He answered. ''I need to know where we are gonna head. Haynes and Beltzer, how is the storm looking on radar?'' Beltzer scanned his eyes over the radar. A hook was starting to appear over Guthrie. A red box showed up on the radar. A tornado warning had been issued for Guthrie, Oklahoma. Haynes spoke excitedly. ''Okay! A tornado warning has just been issued for Guthrie! Looks like our target was correct.'' Jo beamed with pride. ''Excellent!'' She exclaimed. ''Rabbit, I need you to give me the fastest route to Guthrie.'' She commanded. Rabbit nodded his head. He looked at Sanders and Sanders knew what to do. He turned his body around and handed his friend his maps. ''Here you go, man.'' Sanders said. Rabbit grabbed his maps and rolled his eyes. His maps had been folded! Rabbit let out an annoyed sigh. ''Ugh... How many times do I have to tell you this... Don't fold the maps! Roll the maps! Now there is a big crease in it.'' Sanders shrugged. ''Sorry. I'll do it your way next time, dude.'' Bill placed his palm to his forehead. ''Guys, can we please not fight?'' Jo gave Rabbit and Sanders a dirty look. Rabbit quickly got the memo and observed over his map, trying to figure out the best route to give her. ''The fastest route for us to take is to drive north through Edmond and continue north until we get to E Steward road. The twister should be somewhere over there.'' Jo nodded at his response. ''Okay thanks Rabbit. We should be there within the next 10 minutes. Hopefully this thing will still be on the ground by the time we get there.'' She hoped that they would make it in time. Jonas hoped for the same thing. He wanted this storm chase to be a success. That way he would be able to do something that would impress Jo. As they were nearing Guthrie, Jo told her team to start getting their equipment ready so they would be prepared when they got to their destination. She could hear the tornado sirens wail as she entered Guthrie, Oklahoma. \"Aw man... It's showtime!'' Dusty laughs. Bill scanned the horizon. He knew that the tornado could drop at any moment. It was an eerie sight to see. Pink lightning shot down from the heavens, striking an oak tree. A deafening boom could be heard. Jo turned the van onto E Steward road, as she turned the van onto the dirt road, she could see a funnel snake down onto the ground. The funnel cloud was now a twirling twister! ''Okay guys. Get ready to deploy.'' She instructed. Jonas knew that now was the time to try to impress Jo, so he had to act quickly. He was going to handle recording some data of the environment surrounding the twister. He wanted to also film some incredible footage of the tornado. He grabbed the camera and some of the weather instruments. He got out of the van as soon as Jo stopped it. The others followed Jonas out of the back of the van. Jo and Bill were the last to get out of the van. Jo couldn't believe the sight. The tornado was growing even stronger in strength, for what used to be a beautiful rope had now transformed into a powerful stovepipe. The twister began to churn up the golden wheat fields. Jonas quickly gathered up the weather instruments. He began to record some data. He knew that he had to get the best data that he could gather. After a few moments of attempting to gather some data, He picked up the video camera and began to record. In his viewpoint he observed the twister swift it's path. The monster was now headed south and was making it's way towards the town of Guthrie. Jonas got a horrible feeling in the pit of his stomach, but he continued to film the tornado. He wanted to get the best footage of this tornado, for he knew that others were filming it as well. The twister ripped through a barn, tossing farm equipment and tractors hundreds of feet into the air. This should suffice for good enough footage. He thought to himself. He couldn't bear to film any longer. He knew that the tornado would hit Guthrie head on. He made sure that the camera did not ruin his footage, and he put the camera down. Jonas wasn't the only one that knew where the tornado was heading. Bill also knew that the twister was gonna slam into downtown Guthrie. Dusty spoke up, ''Yo, you guys, I think she's heading towards us! We better back track a little.'' Bill was in agreement with his friend. ''I think Dusty's right. Alright everyone. Let's start packing up.'' Jo made sure that everyone had gotten around, and she drove away. Jonas was confident that his footage of the tornado was good enough to impress Jo. He sits closer to where Jo was. ''Hey Jo. Here is the footage that I gathered from the tornado. I figured that you might like what you see.'' He tells her. \"Thanks Jonas. I'll look at it once we get back to the campus.'' She grabs the footage from him, returning her attention back to the road. Bill turns to her. \"Jo, what do you wanna do now? Wanna go for it again?'' He asks her. Jo sighs. She didn't want to chase it any longer. She knew that it was going to destroy Guthrie. ''Honestly Bill, I think this chase is over. We should go back and help them out as soon as the storm is over.'' ","Summary":" A/N: Hey guys! Twister is my all time favorite movie, so I decided to write this fanfiction that ta"},{"Movie":"Miss Congeniality","Title":"Following Hart","Author":"MelissaAnne.x","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11734568","Passage":"[Chapter 1] Chapter 1 The next morning McDonald sat grudgingly behind his desk, gritting his teeth and staring down at the case report before him. He briefly skimmed through the remaining pages and looked up to the agents in front of him. \"You managed to blow up the Miss United States back drop, blowing Lady Liberty's head sky high,\" he began. Both Hart and Matthews cringed at the tone of his voice, and turned to look at each other nervously. \"But you managed to keep the actual Miss United States out of the explosion – I suppose that's a mission accomplished…So good job, take a break, you deserved it.\" He added slowly. Hart and Matthews leaned forward in their chairs to make sure they'd heard correctly, causing Gracie to almost completely fall onto the floor. McDonald returned his attention to the case report, a sign that the conversation had ended and they were to leave. Quickly, the agents headed for the door with disbelief written across their faces, but they hurried none the less, just in case, when he got to the end of the report – he'd change his mind. As Eric held the door open for Hart, McDonald spoke again, not even looking up from the papers. \"Oh Hart – do us all a favour – go home and take off that skin cringing dress and those sky-high heels off, I'm tired of seeing you falling over every two minutes.\" Matthews laughed as she looked down at the evening grown she has on, 'it was the only thing she could find in that suitcase that Vic packed for her' she mentally argued, before stormed out of the door offended. \"As long as I get to watch,\" Eric jokingly shouted out to her, and smiled at the glare she shot him. \"You do realised that he gave me my gun back…\" she warned. In the elevator ride down, Eric edged closer to Hart, his nose strategically placed. Alarmed at his movement, she whipped around. \"Were you just sniffing me?!\" she confronted him, eyeing him suspiciously. Caught in the act, he slowly backed away, holding his hands up in peace. \"What can I say?\" he feigned innocence, \"Your shampoo has an intriguing smell! Coconut isn't it?\" She shot him another look. \"Ok, ok, so I'm really just going to miss being able to be even close to your hair without something jumping out of it and attacking me, who knows what things were lurking in those tangles.\" He answered, which didn't seem to satisfy her as she promptly hit him causing to double over in pain the elevator doors slid open. As they were existing she tripped and stumbled quite un grace fully onto the sidewalk. 'That's Gracie alright' he thought, \"What were your parents thinking when they named you?\" he laughed, one hand still clutching his stomach, whilst the other extend to her. Gratefully she reached up to accept his help, but he immediately jerked his hand away, causing her to fall once more to the sidewalk. \"I'm running out of ways not to use my gun, and you don't want me to come to my last resort so early in our relationship do you?\" she flashed him one of her beautiful smile before regaining her balance and helping him up. \"You're giving me the feeling that those two dates you've had didn't end well.\" \"I didn't shoot any of 'em Matthews, so don't worry,\" she gestured to her gun, \"This baby's only for the really annoying people in life,\" she paused, \"Like you!\" she chimed in cheerfully. \"Oh come on,\" he laughed as he slapped her ass, \"You know you love me…\" \"All the love in the world won't save you if you ever do that ag…\" her sentence went unfinished, smothered by a kiss. The pair then walked towards his car, where Eric waited for her with car's door wide open. \"Oh what a gentleman Matthews\" She commented as she slide into the car and smile lovingly as he walks around to get into driver seat, taking her home and to the bed she has come to miss so much. Gracie fell onto her bed as soon as she walked in, closing her eyes with the intention of nothing but a quick nap. As Eric will be back to pick her up for their 'casual dinner' that he promised. Gracie cursed as the sounds of her doorbell rung through the apartment \"It really is just my luck that he has to be early\", she mumbled to herself as she tried to quickly smear some makeup onto her face, aiming to get to how Vic would have done it, sort of, if you use a little bit of imagination. Alright, okay, maybe not. \"Screw it,\" she grumbled wiping it all off on a towel that is now smeared with foundation and eye shadow from previous attempts. \"I'll just have to go without,\" she decided. Grabbing her purse off the counter, stopping to pull her hair back into a ponytail before she hurried to the door and opened it. Eric stood outside her apartment, flowers in hand, looking confident to the point of cockiness as usual. For a moment she glared admiring between him and flowers in his hand, greeting him with a smile and a peck on the cheek. \"What happened to the sash?\" he asked in an attempt to sound disappointed as he looked her from head to toe. \"You're early for this 'casual dinner' of ours,\" she pointed out, taking the flowers from him, as she retreated into her apartment to get a vase. Though, from her lack of flowers over the years, the best vase she could find was an old, empty coffee jar – it would work. \"So where are we going tonight?\" she asked as she shut the door behind them and they started down the hall. \"I thought we'd head for a Steak House, you like steak don't cha Hart? Big chunk of red meat – right up your street.\" Hart cringed at the memory of Vic and the table manners incident at the restaurant. Well, things are different now. She'd finally figured out where the napkin was supposed to go and is able to close her mouth whilst she chews. This had proved to be an important lesson for her, it's become a tactic she used to prevent Vic from seeing exactly what it was she was eating – with her mouth closed they couldn't tell donut from carrot. Donut Nazi![Chapter 2] Chapter 2 At the steak house, they were seated near the back and Matthews pulled out the chair for her. \"Matthews? A gentleman?\" Hart laughed, \"This is a side I've never seen of you.\" \"Oh come on – I'm a gentleman, you know it, what about that night at the pool? I was completely gentlemanly.\" \"Up until the point you pulled me into the pool, or have you forgotten that?\" \"You totally fell.\" Hart was about to retort before the waiter set down their meals. \"Hey – your steak looks bigger than mine,\" Gracie commented. \"Only 'cause you just gnawed off a huge chunk already,\" Matthews laughed. \"I did not 'gnaw' anything – I have table manners, thank you very much!\" She motioned to the napkin in her lap \"See?\" \"So now instead of wolfing down your Ben & Jerry's, you daintily devour it, right?\" \"Damn right.\" After dinner, they returned to Matthews' car – a sleek, high performance sports car. It's fitting, the car match his ego so perfectly. \"So where we going now Matthews?\" \"My place.\" \"Oh, that was subtle.\" \"To watch a movie Hart! Honestly, what do you think of me?\" \"Well, I believe your words were 'If we happen to have sex afterwards – so be it.' What kind of conclusion is a girl supposed to draw from that?\" \"A girl? I wouldn't say that to a girl, but you Hart, you're different.\" She laid her hand down hard on his leg, \"And that would be mean exactly what?\" He glanced nervously at her grip on his leg. \"It would mean exactly that you would be considered, more of a lady.\" \"That's better,\" she said satisfied, settling back into her seat. As they drove, Matthews slipped one hand from the steering wheel and rested it on her leg. She looked from his hand to him. \"Don't tell me you haven't heard things about the kind of guys that drive these cars.\" \"You mean that they're always making moves on young girls as soon as they get them in these car. Vic would be simply crushed if he heard that.\" \"C'mon Hart, don't bring that up – it just ruins the moment debating another man's attraction for me, besides, you're just jealous.\" \"Well don't go and say things like that on our date! It makes me start to wonder exactly where your hand is been, and after that comment, I'd like you to remove it.\" \"You know I'm just kidding Hart.\" \"I knew you were kidding, but just so you know with the amount of time you spend with your hair, and your impeccable taste in clothes – a couple of guys at the precinct are starting to wonder.\" Matthews returned his hand at ease that she was only joking. Gracie sat back, content, and silence ensued. A moment later, Eric suddenly asked. \"Wait Hart, you were kidding too, right? About the guys? The guys at the precinct really aren't starting to wonder, right? Hart, they really aren't, right? Hey Hart, say something…\" She simply turned her head, and smiled. \"Alright Eric, what movie are we gonna watch?\" Hart asked, looking around at his surprisingly well decorated apartment. Sifting through his row of films, reading off their titles out loud. \"Jack Chan, Bruce Lee, Jean Claude Van Damm and...Bambi?\" She cast a suspicious glance at him. \"Bambi?\" she repeated. He ran his fingers through his hair and shrugged. \"It's for my...nephew...Sam, we're uh...real close..,\" he snatched a picture off the end table and held it up. A blond haired, blue eyed boy petting his dog smiled at Hart. Her eyes shifted to the corner of the picture where \"3 x 5 Solid Wood Frame\" was printed. \"That picture came with the frame!\" \"Ok, ok! So Bambi's really just for me! In Firearms training I couldn't stand the thought of shooting a gun. SO I watched the opening scene of Bambi over and over trying to desensitize myself.\" \"Did it work?\" \"No, but I've got a strange new fascination with fluffy tails.\" He smirked and slapped her butt. \"Watch it, I am still armed you know.\" \"If you can't say anything nice, don't say anything at all.\" \"Why do I get the feeling you watched more than just the opening scene?\" \"...Time for some good old Jackie Chan!\" She rolled her eyes and flopped down on the couch. Halfway through the movie, her eyelids were starting to droop, and she rested herself against the cushions \"Hey, hey, hey, send a little of that my way,\" Eric motioned. \"But your cushions are just so comfortable and strangely Martha Stewart-like\" she mumbled. \"C'mon, I'm the same way, try me out.\" She relented as he pulled her into a closer embrace, swept his arms around her. Settling in, she nodded with her eyes closed \"Comfortable yes, but I'm still missing that Martha Stewart thing.\" \"Well today we'll begin with one very good looking G-man and a former Beauty Queen. You'll be needing one couch and an empty apartment. Now, let's see what kind of fun new projects we can make this episode.\" He joke whilst leaning into kiss her, a kiss that seem to last forever, only pulling away for some air. \"Congratulations Eric, you've just made even the most wholesome American homemaker sound dirty.\" He laugh before leaning down to kiss her again. \"I'm good at other things too, you know.\" \"I'm sure you are,\" and suddenly no one was paying attention to Jackie Chan's flying leg kick. His hands on her tights slowly pushing the material of her dress up, then was interrupted when she pulled away from the kiss, \"Sorry Matthews, not tonight.\" She added. He looked at her confused \"Remember you said it'd just be a casual dinner and if we happen to have sex afterward, so be it?\" He nodded. \"Well I just can't prove you right.\" She kiss him good night one, with that she stood up and left before he could say anything. \"How's tomorrow?\" she called from his front door smirking.[Chapter 3] Chapter 3 11 o'clock Saturday morning she lay squished up on her mattress in a heap. The sounds of the doorbell ringing sent her flailing out of bed and she scrambled around, disoriented. Grumbling and tripping across the floor, she pulled open her duplex door. \"What?!\" she muttered, her eyes half open, her hair ratted out in a tangled mass, not as bad as it once was though. Matthews stood before her, smiling, his hair, of course, as usual, perfect to the last strand. \"Well Good Morning to you too, Sunshine,\" he said, waving a bag of donuts in front of her nose and stepping inside. She greeted him with a look of half- asleep suspicion, but her eyes followed the donuts. \"Mornin' Eric,\" she yawned, and he kissed her on the cheek, wrapping his arm around her waist, \"But what the hell are you doing here? Not that I mind or anything,\" as she snatch the donuts from him and stride off into the kitchen. Shoving a pile of \"National Enquirer's off the kitchen chair, making space for Eric to sit, before flopping into the chair next to his. He scooped up one of the issues and skimmed it, while she munched on her Krispy Kreme donut. \"Keepin' a close eye on Bat Boy, I see.\" \"I'm tellin' you, that kid is Public Enemy #1, but you still haven't told me what you're doing here.\" \"Can't a guy just want to spend time with his girlfriend?\" \"A guy like you?\" \"I'm hurt!\" he clutched his chest in mock offense. \"What's the real reason Matthews?\" \"Well, uh, Beth the...\" \"Starbucks Girl?\" Hart offered. \"...the barista,\" Matthews continued, \"Keeps callin' and stoppin' by.\" \"Revenge of the Sorority Girl,\" Hart mused, \"Wasn't that a horror movie?\" \"...so I'm hidin' out here 'til she goes away.\" \"Can't you just wave you gun around? You know they gave us those things for a reason.\" \"Well unlike you, Gracie, some people don't like to come off as gun- toting anti-socials, right off the bat.\" \"Hey, I'm not anti-social. I spent a week in a hotel with America's bubbliest, shining beauty queens - I am not anti-social.\" \"'Course you're not,\" Matthews conceded, kissing her powder-sugar coated lips. \"Damn right I'm not,\" she re-affirmed, stuffing down the rest of her donut, before standing up, stretching her arms. \"Well Eric, if you're going to stick around, you're in for the ride of your life - its laundry day.\" \"Aw, Hart, don't you have something a little more interesting to do?\" \"Hey, you're using my house to hide from the Starbucks Girl…\" \"Barista!\" \"Whatever, you're hidin' out here, you can help me.\" She disappeared into her bedroom for a moment and returned with a bulging laundry bag. Heading for the door, she grabbed Matthews' arm, \"Off to the laundry mat.\" \"Whoa, whoa, whoa...\" he protested, \"Hart, you just got up, you're gonna walk outta the house like that?\" She looked herself over. Clean sweatpants, clean vest, and her socks even matched. She shrugged and he raised an eyebrow. Throwing her arms up in defeat, she retreated back into her bedroom. Re-emerging ten minutes later in jeans and a new top, her hair pulled back in a decent ponytail, she held up her arms and turned in a circle for his approval. \"Looookin' good, Hart!\" Matthews whistled. She rolled her eyes and grabbed the laundry bag. He held the door open for her as they exited. Out on her front porch, starting down the steps, Gracie's neighbour snuck her head out her window, between her potted plants. \"Good Morning Gracie, I see you've got a gentleman caller.\" \"Mornin' Mrs Katsopolis - he's just a friend.\" \"Is that all I am, huh?\" Eric whispered into her ear, kissing it softly. He grabbed the laundry bag from her, wrapped his free arm around her waist, and pulled her close. Mrs Katsopolis pulled her head back in the window and smiled, \"Wish I had a couple friends like that...\" \"It's officially a conspiracy,\" Gracie informed, as they'd finished her laundry and were heading back up the street. \"The fitted sheet is impossible to fold using any methods known to man.\" \"Sure Hart – the sheet companies make unfold-able sheets to promote frustration and disorder amongst the masses.\" \"That's what I'm talking about!\" \"Alright – no more National Enquirer for you!\" Under Mrs Katsopolis' grinning looks, they walked back up the porch and back into the house. \"How 'bout some lunch, Hart?\" he called as Grace retreated to her room, dumping the clean laundry in a heap on the floor. Eyeing the microwave dinner boxes, he gulped and called out, \"How 'bout we order in?\" \"Oh sure, the choice is yours, Chang's or Craig's? Chang's do Chinese, Craig's do burgers\" \"Anything certified by the Health Dept.?\" \"Wouldn't count on it,\" Hart admitted, re-joining him in the kitchen. \"To insure our safety – how 'bout we head to my place? There's a good pizza joint that delivers over there – minus the food poisoning.\" \"I dunno...is the delivery boy cute? If you're just trying to finish what we started last night, then I might have to run off with him.\" \"I think I'm safe for now – unless you've got a passion for pimple faced, bleach blond delivery boys with braces.\" \"Look who's talking – I've seen your high school pictures.\" \"I never bleached my hair! Only the pure, natural ingredients for this babies,\" he defended, smoothing his hair back. \"Right Matthews, since when do perms qualify as natural?\" \"That was not a perm! It was the humidity!\" \"C'mon, let's go,\" Gracie relented, rolling her eyes and pulling him towards the door. \"It was! When it's humid I get ringlets!\" \"Will you shut up?\" Hart laughed, pulling him into a kiss. He pulled her closer, and returned the kiss until they had to come up for air. \"Mmm...\" Gracie mused, a content smile on her face. \"That good, huh?\" \"Sorry Matthews, I was just thinking about a large piece of pizza – I really am hungry.\" \"Thanks Hart, you do wonders for my self-esteem.\" \"A girl does what she can,\" she smirked and locked the door behind her. They made it to his car before Mrs Katsopolis' head peaked out of the window once more. \"He's good looking with a nice car! Ride it for all it's worth Gracie!\" she called. Gracie shook her head in humiliation. \"You know what they say - can't argue with good advice,\" Matthews whispered in her ear. She rolled her eyes and climbed into the car. \"Let's go Mr, if your ego gets any bigger I don't think there will be enough room for me in the car.\"[Chapter 4] Chapter 4 \"Home sweet home,\" Eric announced, unlocking the door. \"How sweet, is that available stitched on a pillow somewhere?\" \"Sorry – I ditched Home Ec.\" \"Oooh, what a rebel you were! Rebel with a perm...\" \"Hey – we've been over this. Hu-mid-i-ty. Humidity.\" \"Whatever, just order the pizza, but careful with the phone – wouldn't want you to squash your delicate ringlets.\" \"Payback,\" he glared, \"Payback is coming.\" Grabbing the phone, he pressed '2' \"The pizza man's on speed dial?\" \"I told you I ditched Home Ec,\" he whispered. \"Hi, yeah, I'd like a medium...,\" Hart coughed,\"...large cheese pizza. Yeah, thanks.\" Hanging up the phone he turned to her and said \"It'll be here in 20.\" \"Damn fast. Special G-Man privileges?\" \"I'm a repeat customer – I keep the pizza economy thriving.\" \"And yet you manage to keep this nice, trim figure,\" she slapped his butt. \"Hey, hey, I thought this area was off limits.\" \"Well if you want to play by the rules...\" \"Never mind\" he cut her off, pulling her to him. \"I'm the rebel, remember?\" She smirked and leaned back. \"He's a rebel and he'll never never be any goooood, he's a rebel 'cause he never never does what he should. Just because he doesn't do what...,\" he cut her off with a kiss. \"Thank god that wasn't your talent.\" He added. \"Yeah, I bet you're really glad that I can beat the crap out of you instead.\" \"Payback, I swear, payback is coming.\" The doorbell interrupted his glare. \"Pizza first, payback later,\" reaching into his back pocket, she grabbed his wallet and hurried to the door. Pulling the door open, Hart stopped in her tracks, and cringed, \"Uh, are you the pizza...\" Man? Woman? \"...deliverer?\" \"Yesh, I'm Josh.\" \"Joooooosh,\" she nodded in understanding,\"Riiiiight.\" \"Well that'll be 13.99, pretty lady.\" \"Um,\" she flipped through the wallet, \"Do you have change for a twenty?\" \"Sure, I've got change, I keep my change right here,\" he padded his belt. \"Well ok,\" she handed over the twenty, \"Then you can just uh, keep the change. Have a nice day!\" Grabbing the pizza with one hand, she slam the door closed with her foot. \"Matthews – have no further fears about me running away with the pizza man.\" \"Even if he was the last man on earth?\" \"Do you really think he falls under the 'man' category?\" \"Ouch – tough standards there Hart.\" \"Be nice – I'm in possession of the pizza.\" \"I can be nice, I can be very nice,\" he looked up at her from the couch, tugging at the bottom of her shirt. \"Eeeeeeric,\" she smirked, \"We just got pizza.\" \"I for one don't mind cold pizza, how 'bout you?\" He pulled her into a deep kiss. \"Nope,\" she mumbled, her lips numb, \"Cold pizza sounds good. Cold pizza sounds very good.\" The next morning Eric rolled over, cracking one eye open. He surveyed the damage of the past day's and night's events. Aside from the clothes strewn about, only a few lampshades, a couple dresser drawers, and a chair or two needed fixing… Chuckling to himself, he turned his attention from the room to Hart, still sleeping peacefully next to him. She woke slowly to feeling of his hands running through her hair. \"Matthews,\" she murmured, still half asleep. \"It's early. I don't want to play beauty shop right now plus you are not Victor.\" \"I can't help it Hart,\" he said, \"I'm just amazed…your hair, it's still…perfect. After all this, it still looks good. So I just gotta ask…if you leave it alone and it looks like this, what the hell were you doing to it before?\" \"Having wild sex with a biker gang,\" she muttered into the pillow, rolling over. \"Now let me sleep.\" He snaked an arm around her waist and pulled her to him. \"Oh yeah?\" he said, pressing kisses onto her back. \"And how were they?\" Through the haze which still filled her head this early in the morning, Hart debated her options on how to answer to the question. Finally, she rolled back over to face him, pulling him to her with a kiss. \"Not as good as you, Matthews. Never as good as you.\" Pulling him closer for another passionate kiss 'Thank God McDonalds has gave her and Eric some time off'.[Chapter 5] Chapter 5 6 months later \"Hart, what is up with that showcase?\" Eric said walking into her now newly decorated apartment, which is a thousand times tidier than it used to be. No more watching her tripping, skipping and flying through the piles of stuff she leaves on the floor. \"Well I gotta put that sash and award from the pageant somewhere, plus it's reminder of the good time I've had with the girls.\" Gracie answered tuning to see Eric with a questioning expression on his face \"Just the girls…?\" \"Alright, alright with you too. Are you happy now big baby?\" Gracie reply sarcastically as she walks towards him smirking. \"Very!\" Eric said pulling her into his arm, and gently kiss her forehead. The pair then moved into her living room, putting on an old black & white movie settling down with Ben & Jerry's Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough. \"What's the plan this weekend?\" Eric said interrupting the silent that filled the room as soon as the movie started. \"Umm…nothing that I know of, Why?\" she said still licking on the spoon filled with ice cream, yes Victor has taught her to chew, but he never told her to stop being who she is in the comfort of her own home. \"Well, how does a little road trip to New Jersey, sounds?\" \"I say let's do it. We haven't been out in a while\" That Weekend \"Hart, come on. Let's go\" he shouted for her at the door. \"I won't be a minute, just let yourself in\" She answer back. Why does he do this? Give him a dam key so he can come in, but instead of using them he shouts for me, and letting the whole apartment block knows in the process. Men! She mentally said to herself. \"What's the rush?\" She said moving towards him and greet him with a quick kiss. \"I have a surprise for you\" He simply replied grinning from ear to ear. \"What kind of a surprise? You know I don't like surprises. What are you planning? Where are we really going?\" \"I have one answer for you…that's for me to know and for you to find out. Come on\" He said dragging her out of the door only to be greeted by Mrs Katsopolis who this time just gave them a knowing smile. \"So where are we going?\" She asked once more agitated \"Oh Gracie, will you just chillax, promise I'm not trafficking you anywhere\" Eric reply trying to keep a straight face \"But seeing as we are here\" pulling her out to see the sign for a dog farm. \"Pick one\" he whispers as he watched her looked at the puppies in awe. \"How's this one?\" she said pointing at a black Labrador puppy that is eyeing her with the cutest puppy dog eyes in the world. How can you not like him? Just look at him and look into his eyes, she mentally told herself. \"That little one it is then\" picking the puppy up and handing it to her \"Happy Birthday baby\" he added, kissing her. \"I have one more question though\" Eric added as she's sitting in the car admiring the puppy in her lap. \"Shoot\" she said not breaking an eye contract from the little guy that's now sitting quietly looking back up at her. Not getting quite the attention he was hoping for to have this conversation, but he better just go out and say it while he have the guts to do so. \"Will you move in this me?\" \"What?\" Did I hear that right? Did he just asked me to move in? Gracie started to question herself, now looking straight up at him. \"I know you just redone your place and all, but I just though we spend so much time at mine anyway, it doesn't make sense for you to keep your rent going, and have the place empty half of the time. I mean if you don't want to I totally understand, it's not a problem or anything. I just thought it would be easi…\" \"You talk too much Agent Matthews\" she said cutting him off \"I would love to\" \"As in…\" He add not quite believing what he heard \"Yes I will move in with you\" she confirmed, adding a passionate kiss to seal the deal.[Chapter 6] Chapter 6 \"Benji, let's go\" Gracie called out to the little Labrador as the puppy jumps down from the sofa and run excitingly towards her, knowing it is their exercise time. Gracie would normally take him out in the morning before work for a run in Central Park, if Eric was home he would join them too. But lately he's been working late and doing all sorts of shift. If it wasn't for the fact that she's now living at his place, she doubts that she will see him that much at all. \"Another day at work\" Grace thought as she walks into the federal office building, ever since the Miss United States pageants Gracie has mainly been doing desk jobs in order to protect the undercover team from being recognised and to be honest to said that she's getting bored and fed up is an understatement of the century. A memory of when she told Eric that she didn't even feel like a real agent anymore back when she was undercover as Gracie-Lou flashback across her mind, at least she was on the field then now she's just pushing paper around the table. She must talk to McDonalds about this, there must be other options. \"Sir, have you got a moment? There is something I would like to discuss with you\" she called out to McDonalds with half of her head around his office door. \"Hart, just the person I'm looking for. Do come in\" McDonalds said, whilst Gracie slowly walk into his office. \"What can I do for you sir? I hope I can be of service\" Grace told him as she sat down on the chair opposite him. \"Well I just had a call from the boss, the FBI has been going through a lot of bad publicity lately, and we come to an agreement that your time could be better spent, and…\" McDonalds begins to trail off as he's not sure how she will take this reassignment. \"And, what sir?\" Grace asked nervously. \"We need you to be the face of the FBI\" He said firmly. Grace face tells a million story, you could see her processing the information she has just been given, the room as silent. So silent that you could hear her thinking. \"Me? I think you have the wrong person Sir. What can I possibly contribute to the bureau image?\" Gracie finally answered. \"With your popularity Grace: the public loves you, plus are you not fed up of stuck inside pushing paper around the paper. Isn't that what you came to talk to be about?\" \"…Yes, but can I think about it first sir?\" Grace finally answered after about a minute pause. \"I need the answer by tomorrow Gracie, take the rest of the off. Go home, think about it, talk about it, do whatever you need to do\" McDonalds said to dismiss her from his office. As Gracie walked towards her table to pick up her bags and some paperwork she needs to finish tonight, her mind wondered off, and said to herself \"Thank God, Eric is home today\"[Chapter 7] Chapter 7 \"Eric, I'm home\" she called out as she opened the door into their apartment with Benji bouncing up and down greeting her with a bark, picking him up into her arms \"Hi darling, where's daddy at?\" the place was so quiet and there's no sign of him. Perhaps he's still asleep she thought, whilst continuing to walk towards the bedroom. \"Eric\" she called out one final time as she opened the door, and there it was staring back at her a sight she didn't expect to ever see. \"Grace!\" He looked up in shock as panic runs across his mind, grabbing what he could find to wear. \"Gracie, please hear me out\" he shouted behind her leaving the blonde in bed, chasing after her as she makes a beeline out of the door, down to the street with Benji still in her arms. Lucky for her and unlucky for him, she can run pretty fast even with the puppy. \"Grace, Grace, Grace\" Eric shouts as he tries to catch up with her down the street but it was too late she has already disappear into the crowd of New York. Fortunately or unfortunately for her, she hasn't been able to sale her apartment yet. At least, she have some where to stay and go back to, breaking down in tears as she let go of Beji from her arms. She couldn't believe Eric would do something like this, where did it all go wrong? She asked herself. But soon enough the anger within her took over and she starts to curse whilst she pounded into the punch bag that laid in her bedroom. Yes her apartment may be more feminine compared to what it was before, but she certainly hasn't lost any of her former self. \"You lying son of a bitch!\" She curse at a picture of her and him that caught the corner of her eyes whilst she's trying to watch TV to forget about him, and think of that reassignment that McDonalds has given her, to become the new 'Face of the FBI'. The next day Grace walked into building in hopes that she won't see him, not that he should be at work anyway. McDonalds have been keeping them fairly apart at work whilst she does the bright and early shift inside the office, he can barely be seen in the building normally he's on the fields doing undercover work. The only time he's in the office is for briefs and meetings. She walked passed her table, and nothing. Everything seems to be calmed and under controlled. No sign of him, perfect! She thought as she makes her way towards the kitchen, knowing that where she would find Sam Fuller, her partner a recent transfer from Chicago. \"Morning\" Sam greeted her with a coffee in her hand, slowly looking up towards Gracie. \"Oh My God, what happened to you? You look like you haven't slept in days\" she exclaimed surprise to see the normally cheerful Gracie look tired. \"Eric and I are done\" Gracie simply answered with zero tone in her voice. \"What? What do you mean? What happened?\" Sam asked confused, the pair in her eyes were happy and so in love, she thought they would be getting marry not break up. Normally she wouldn't ask gossiping is not her thing, but she is just too confused not to. \"I found him in bed with a blonde bimbo yesterday when I went home\" she added. \"Oh Gracie, I'm sorry\" Sam said walking up to give her a light hug. \"I need you to do something for me\" \"What is it?\" \"I need you to go and pack and pick up my stuff from his place, anything that look like it could be mine just pack it, please I'm begging you. I don't want to see him right now, and I have virtually nothing at my apartment. \"Umm, sure. I guess I can do it now there's nothing urgent this morning\" \"Thanks I really appreciate it\" With that Sam makes her way towards Eric's apartment, whilst Grace makes her way to McDonalds' office.[Chapter 8] Chapter 8 \"Good Morning Sir\" She said walking into McDonalds' office and sitting down on the chair opposite him. \"I came to inform you that I would be honour to take the reassignment and become the new face of the FBI Sir\" Grace said firmly, yet so carefully. \"I'm glad you have come to that conclusion Gracie\" He smiled relaxingly at her, \"in that case I have a surprise for you\" he added as the door behind her opens. Someone she definitely didn't expect to see here. \"Victor!\" she screamed excitedly, \"What are you doing here? OMG I didn't expect to see you here at all, how have you been?\" \"Well to answer your questions I've been great, I'm here as a style and beauty consultant seeing as someone is about to go out and create good publicity for the bureau\" Victor answered smiling brightly at her before leaning closer and quietly add \"What's wrong? You need to tell me as soon as we're out of this room\" She didn't know what to say and could only nod in response, for a moment she forgot about him, then in a single sentence it all came back to her again. \"Right! We should get to work Gracie\" Victor announced to McDonald and signal her to leave the room. But as soon as she opened the door to exit the room there Eric was standing by her table with her favourite flowers: white tulips. She glanced towards him, taking a deep breath, dragging Victor to a small meeting room around the corner. \"Ok, something clearly happened, and it's clearly not good. What is it?\" Victor asked as soon as they were in the room and out of ear sight. \"Eric and I broke up, I found him in bed with some blonde bimbo yesterday when I went home\" she said knowing for well this is not even the start of the conversation. Unlike Sam, Victor loves a little bit of gossip and believe in talking things out. So before he could even ask the next question she told him the story. Flashbacks \"Eric, I'm home\" calling out as she opened the door into their apartment, saying hi and picking up Benji. The place was so quiet and there's no sign of him. Perhaps he's still asleep she thought, walking towards their bedroom. \"Eric\" she said one last time before opening the door into a sight that she didn't expect ever see. \"Grace!\" He looked up in shock as panic runs across his mind, grabbing what he could find to wear, hastily putting his trousers on. Shouting her name as he ran after her down the street. Eventually he caught up with her, grabbing her arm and spun her around \"Grace, I'm…\" \"Spare me, I don't want to hear it. We're done Eric\" \"Grace, please I'm sorry\" \"How could you do that to me? I thought we were happy and you loved me\" \"I did – I do love you Gracie, it was a mistake it meant nothing to me\" \"Eric I think you sure let me go, and you know what the mistake was? My mistake in thinking that we love each other and that we had future\" With that she shook her wrist away from him with Beji still in her arm she ran as quick as she can away from him. End of flashbacks \"And that's about everything that happened yesterday, I only just sent Sam to pack all of my stuff and drop it by at my place. You saw everything else already\" \"Oh Gracie, come here\" Gesturing her towards him giving her one of the comforting hugs she has ever received. \"Now stop crying, let me fix those bags under your eyes. We have lots to do\" Victor decided it was best to change the subject and concentrate on getting her ready as the face of the FBI.[Chapter 9] \"Oh look at you…absolutely perfect\" Vic said out loud to himself more than anything else as he finished up Gracie's makeup. \"Now go and put these on\" handing her a set of clothes \"and for heaven's sake – smile sweet pea\" Vic called out to her as she walks away to change. 10 minutes later Gracie Hart looked as if she never spent a day away from the Miss United State pageant, she looked more radiant than ever. As long as you don't look into her beautiful brown eyes that right now shows nothing but sadness and pain. Vic decided to dress her in a deep wine crop shirt, high waist black skinny jeans, and a pair of strappy high heels. Nothing too out of the ordinary for a trip to the bureau office according to Victor. \"Vic, do I really need to be wearing all of this? I think I'm a little overdressed just to go to the office\" Grace protests \"Why? Not at all. From now on your motto is - I would rather be overdressed than underdressed, soon everyone will be watching your every move\" Victor reply with a big smile on his face. 'Oh God, what have I got myself into?' Grace mumbled to herself. \"You look absolutely fabulous, and have nothing to worry about\" \"Hart, Victor - to the meeting room now please\" McDonalds called out as soon as they step into the office. Wasting no time as soon as everyone seated, \"we have a new case and it sounds strangely similar to the Miss United Stated pageant case\" McDonalds announced. \"Matthews, pick a team! Hart seeing as you are already dressed up you are going undercover, we will have to hold off announcing your role until we close this case, and Victor if you wouldn't mind can you look after her styling for this case\" McDonalds ordered. \"But sir!\" Grace try to protest she can't possibly be working this close to him right now but he wasn't having any of it. \"Look Hart, I need you to put whatever you are having problem aside. I need you on this case\" he bluntly said before completely walking away. \"Oh Great!\" she fumed both to herself, and to Sam and Vic who are standing behind her. \"Gracie, can we talk please?\" Eric cut in between Sam and Vic, which made the pair disperse in order to give Grace and Eric space. \"Eric, not now, not while we are at work\" she whisper back, her eyes glanced to everyone else in the room that are watching them at the moment. \"Maybe later at lunch time, but right now everyone is waiting for their brief\" She added. AN: Apologise for the short chapter but hopefully I can get the next one up very soon.

She is still the original author and as a result deserves this tribute, but technically I am the new author. So any ideas, suggestions, OCs and all are to be sent via PMs or reviews to me. Thank you for letting me take over FlyPandaBear. NOTE: This is an edited version of Chapter 6. I noticed some mistakes and all, and as a result I am reposting it in a way. Also I am thinking of putting in some \"Alpha and Omega\" wolves and \"Balto\" crew as well. If you think it should be just in the Cats and Dogs archive, the Alpha and Omega archive, or the Balto archive, or some crossover archive, PM or review. R&R; people. ME: Sorry for the boring message. This will be written differently from the original story \"Puppy Love\". And if you don't like violence and animals and all, HIT THE [[CENSORED]] BACK BUTTON HATER! Oh, and I don't own anything or non-original OCs. Cats and Dogs and sequel is the property of Warner Bros and Village Roadside. A&O; is the property of Crest Animation and Lionsgate, as is its future sequel. Balto and sequels are property of Universal and Amblimation. Don't like it suit boys? Go ahead and email me a complaint. Lou? LOU: You heard the man! Now, onto the story. There will be a surprise for those who haven't read the original before courtesy of me... ME: Got it. For those of you who don't know, Lou is the head dog of the Canine Intelligence Service, which is the intelligence agency of the Unified Canine Republic (UCR, government of all dogs, wolves, etc.) Now, STORY TIME! \"...all cats and dogs will cease to exist,\" Desiree finished. \"That would be correct Beta One,\" Lou said. He noticed confusion spread her features and paused. \"Wait,\" Diggs said, equally as confused by Lou's manner of addressing his girlfriend. \"'Beta One?' Lou, Desiree is a living being , not a robot .\" The Director of CIS nodded. \"I am well aware of that Alpha One,\" he said in a calm voice. It was as though he had heard the sentence but not truly acknowledged it. \" He isn't either,\" Desiree said with concern \" Sir .\" Lou didn't smile but locked eyes with both of them. \"When I said only you two could accomplish the mission,\" he began. Slowly. Obviously was picking his words carefully. \"I was merely testing both of you. I could not fire two agents that could accomplish the mission without backup. You two willing to go in without any other agents means two tests got As. With attached pluses.\" \"PLEASE EXPLAIN THEM WHY WE ARE BEING CALLED ALPHA ONE AND BETA ONE!\" Diggs and Desiree said in perfect sync. \"I'm assembling a task force,\" Lou said. \"We cannot afford to send in only one or two agents. I was only able to assemble a handful of dogs for this mission. There are many that would make for a great help on this mission but are unavailable for various reasons.\" \"Why a task force Lou?\" Diggs said. \"Won't it take too long?\" \"It normally would,\" the Director said, \"But the circumstances warrant these extreme measures. Tab, the 'Fat Cat' at MEOWS, informed me that he sent in two agents a day ago to investigate a report in Los Angeles, California. Said report stated that one of Kitty Galore's carrier pigeons, Seamus's cousin Nicky, disappeared in South Central. Both of them were confirmed inserted but surveillance cameras and spy satellites are mainly rare in that area, and contact was lost shortly after they were inserted. Local CIS operatives in LA embarked on a search-and-rescue mission while also looking for Nicky but so far we have had no contact from them either. We suspect the high crime in South Central LA has caused them to go dark. We do not know what Feline Liberation Front (those evil cats in the movies for those of you who don't know; back to the story) supporting gangs are in the area, but they have not been heard from for eighteen hours and counting. Thereby we will assemble a task force for the purpose of this assignment.\" Just then, Peek, a Chinese Crested who headed Covert Ops, ran in. \"Boss!\" he yelled. \"We have a briefing Peek,\" Lou said, not letting his anger at the tech specialist bursting in, \"but I know it's important. Tell me.\" \"We got something from Jamaica!\" \"Onscreen,\" the Beagle ordered. \"Got it,\" he said. It was Tinkles. He had been defeated earlier by Diggs, Catherine, Butch and Seamus, but escaped. Now he was sweating and nervous. \"TINKLES!\" Lou yelled. He had a hatred for the cat that he kept concealed since a plot to make humans allergic to dogs and nearly killing his family. \"Listen to me my former enemies!\" he said. \"Kitty will be initiating her grand plan in less than a day via Los Angeles!\" \"We know that,\" Desiree said. \"I have no time for much conversation!\" he said. \"Using backup files and top-of-the-line hardware, Kitty Galore has been able to make a new and improved Paws!\" \"WHAT?\" Diggs yelled. He thought his days of fighting that robot were over. Now he had to deal with a tougher one? \"Kitty has had Paws assassinate Calico, the MacDougall twins, all of her carrier pigeons, and that Rex dog from Germany! She doesn't like loose ends left untied!\" That monstrosity is coming after me now! She will be in LA to make the broadcast!\" \"Got it!\" Lou said. \"I'll get the Jamaica operatives to rescue you!\" There was an explosion, obviously from Jamaica. Screaming as well. \"Too late!\" he said. He was right. Too late. Lou, Peek, Desiree and Dutch could only watched as the connection was cut, but the screams said one thing. Tinkles was dead . Wow. I just killed off a main character. Or did I... Anyhow, sorry Alpha and Omega fans and Balto fans, but it will be some time before your idols can join the party. Not trying to mock anyone, but they'll fit in later. The story just doesn't permit them from joining. Rate and review! And PM![Chapter 2] ME: Alright! Tinkles is dead (or not) and Kitty is on a rampage! Time for some of my OCs to be introduced! Alpha Two! Alpha Two: Roger author. You guys'll see me in the story... Lou honestly couldn't believe it. His former enemy had tipped them off with credible intel and just died... \"Alright!\" he said. Dead or not, they had to act on Tinkles intel. \"We need to move! Peek, get down to Covert Ops and get ready to provide support!\" He signaled the two agents. \"Diggs, Desiree,\" he said, \"with me!\" They moved quickly, ignoring anything else as they went into the rocket. Desiree, still having some moisture around her head, threw up, in contrast to Diggs and Lou, the former enjoying the ride and the former focusing in contrast. They finally got to the hangar. There was Butch, Dutch, Seamus, Catherine, and six other dogs Diggs and Desiree had never seen. \"Diggs, Desiree!\" Dutch said. \"Get with those guys!\" she indicated the six dogs. Diggs noticed another German Shepherd that resembled him, although with a more feminine look. He did his best to ignore her, not wanting Desiree angry with him. \"Alright!\" Butch said. \"You are all part of Task Force Zero! A top secret unit dedicated solely to taking out any and all threats to canines, humans and cats! We will eliminate Kitty Galore's threat and neutralize the Feline Liberation Front! I am Special Agent-in-Charge Butch, and as of right now you will all report to me. My callsign for this mission is King. Understood?\" \"Sir,\" they all sounded off. He indicated Dutch. \"This is my assistant leader. Assistant Special Agent-in-Charge Duchess, or Dutch. Call her Queen.\" \"Right,\" the female German Shepherd said, \"'cause they always say 'Every King needs a Queen' or something...\". Butch growled and cuffed her on the head. It wasn't very hard, but she still rubbed her head moaning. Diggs glanced at his mentor in anger. \"Not gonna tolerate that Butch,\" he said. He was a bit angry. Sure the girl had made a smart-aleck comment that he would have made, but that was, was, inappropriate . Diggs hated using big words. He wasn't an author, no sir. \"YEAH!\" A Bulldog said. His distinctive accent that made him out to be either from Detroit or Chicago brought him out of his thoughts. \"My homeboy ain't gonna tolerate that, DAWG!\" They all looked at him. Their expressions said it. What the... \"What dogs?\" he said. Clearly his name wasn't Captain Obvious... \"Enough!\" Lou snapped. \"Special Agent-in-Charge Butch, apologize to Senior Special Agent Shovel immediately!\" \"Sir,\" Butch said. He turned. \"I know for a fact you won't...\" She shrugged. \"Eh,\" she said, \"Sometimes I ain't as fast as my mouth is.\" Shovel , Diggs thought. Shovel . It looked like she spent a lot of time in New York City given her accent. \"Alright,\" Lou said, satisfied to some degree that things were now quieter. \"Now time to continue introductions,\" he said, \"but first I have a surprise. Supervisory Special Agent Diggs,\" he said. \"Senior Special Agent Shovel.\" He beckoned them over. \"I had DNA tests done,\" he said. \"You two are from the same litter.\" They both smiled, but Diggs suddenly ended his. \"Wait?\" he said. \"When did this happen?\" \"A week ago the tests were conclusive,\" he said, \"but I didn't want either of you two to have your field performance affected. This, however, proves to be as good a time as possible.\" \"Glad I have at least one brother,\" Shovel said. \"Glad I have a sister,\" Diggs said. He remembered his earlier days. He had brothers, he was sure of that. But a sister... \"Sorry,\" Lou said, \"but celebrations are not in order at this time. Have to continue the introductions.\" They both nodded and returned to the group. Desiree winked at him, clearly appreciating she had another close person to talk to. He doubted they had met before, but he suspected that Desiree and Shovel would bond well. Lou spoke again. \"That sassy, driven Russian Blue is Supervisory Special Agent Catherine, our MEOWS liaison officer.\" Catherine nodded, frowning briefly at the \"sassy\" part. \"Callsign is Friend because you're not supposed to shoot her.\" He moved on. \"Our pigeon recon specialist and eye in the sky is Supervisory Special Agent Seamus,\" he said. \"Street smart, with the callsign Carrier in honor of his late cousin Nicky.\" \"Nicky was an older brother to me!\" Seamus said. \"Raised me after my parents got eaten!\" He was tearful. Diggs nodded in sympathy. \"And backing these four up are two teams,\" he said. \"Alpha and Beta.\" He glanced at Diggs, Shovel, the loudmouth Bulldog and a Border Collie who appeared nervous at any mention of death. \"Diggs provides leadership and marksman capability and has the callsign Alpha One. Shovel is his second and provides tech support, and is thus Alpha Two. Boot, our friend from the Northwest here has paw-to-paw and close quarters covered, and is Alpha Three.\" He turned towards the Border Collie. \"Last but not least is Gauze here who goes by Alpha Four and is their medic and machine gunner.\" He then looked over to Desiree, a Rottweiler, a Beagle and a Pit Bull. \"To save time, I won't mention any of you by callsigns. I'll just rattle you have in order.\" He took a deep breath. \"Desiree is the leader and sharpshooter of Beta Team. Roy is her right paw and Beta's paw-to-paw expert. Chocolate my niece is the medic and close quarters specialist of Beta. Don't press her Big Red Button. Logger is Beta's tech specialist and machine gunner.\" He paused. \"This is the most important mission ever to be undertaken by MEOWS and the CIS. You all have an hour before you are to depart and initiate Operation Light in the Dark. Clear?\" \"SIR YES SIR!\" \"Good,\" he said. \"Dismissed!\" Note: I used the FBI rank structure. Wikipedia the FBI if you don't get the ranks.[Chapter 3] ME: Sorry for taking so long to update, had school and crap. Merry Christmas since a certain holiday is getting closer... Anyhow, I'm going on vacation soon, so it may be some time before I can update regularly. Now, time for someone else to make his presence known. Butch? BUTCH: Roger. Thanks for making me the boss. But why call our unit 'Task Force Zero'? Seriously? ME: Well, you guys aren't some public military unit like the 1st Battalion, 1st Marines. You guys are more Secret Agents, spy guys who honestly don't even exist officialy. So 'Zero' just sounds good. And you're welcome. BUTCH: Got it. Why is Dutch my right-paw? DUTCH: Say again? ME: Well, for the record, even though it would be wiser for Diggs to take the job of second... DUTCH: That guy? ME: Did you just interrupt me? DUTCH: What does it look like? BUTCH: DUTCH! ME: Calm down! Well, Diggs isn't green as grass, but that guy is more of a team leader than the second-in-command of a task force. Besides, he isn't that much more experienced. DIGGS: I heard that! DUTCH: You were supposed to! BUTCH: ENOUGH! And why are you even in this intro? ME: Well, you were a bit of a Jenkins there pal... ME: But I'll post the next chapter eventually. Stupid school! (groan)[Chapter 4] ME: Sorry it's been MONTHS since I updated . I'm planning on being a novelist, so my serious writing is taking a lot of my time. I'm really SORRY. Here's the long awaited Chapter Four. Forgive me if this does not live up to your expectations. The ten dogs, cat and pigeon contemplated their mission as they flew in a high-speed, stealthy airplane. They also reviewed their own equipment. Roy and Boot, being paw-to-paw experts, had their suits modified to allow them to be more agile, at the expense of less practical protection, something the designers tried to account for. Chocolate had similar gear due to being a close quarters expert (similar to Boot), but being a medic meant she also carried more stuff to patch up injuries, as did Gauze. Butch, Dutch, Catherine, Seamus, Diggs and Desiree had better communications due to their leaderships positions, although more for providing play-by-plays on Seamuss part. Logger and Shovel, being tech experts, carried tablets on their persons to slice into doors and other secure things, plot routes, access comms, carry lists and surf the Internet. Seamus had a camera on him to provide accurate intel. Diggs and Desiree additionally had enhanced goggles due to being marksmen, while Logger and Gauzes backpacks were modified to accommodate their machine guns. Regardless, they had one objective in mind: Stop Kitty Galore. Analysts predicted Kitty would be in Hollywood, saying she would infiltrate one of the many media centers in there. It was suspected by the otherwise quiet pilots that Kitty would slip in, plant a CD in a laptop, seize the 'Net and BAM! Problem for her was getting past them. \"This is gonna be tough bro,\" Shovel murmured to Diggs as she adjusted her helmet. \"I've taken on some pretty bad cats and dogs alike myself, but Galore isn't a kitty when it comes to this.\" \"Well kid,\" Butch said, \"less talk, more beat her up.\" There was some chuckling from that. The pilot came over the intercom. \"Fifteen minutes.\" That was it. \"Maybe this'll be easier than messing up a car,\" Seamus said. But a sudden beeping proved that wrong. \"Crap!\" the copilot said. \"SAMs got a lock on us, gonna have to...\". Another alarm went off. \"Come on! SAM launch, SAM launch! Dozen or more of 'em!\" \"Deploy your flares!\" Logger suggested. \"On it,\" the pilot responded, \"releasing flares, deploying counter-\". Whatever effect those means had was marginalized by a missile hitting the right wing. The explosion shook the plane and sent the passengers on an unwanted trip. \"Ugh!\" Desiree muttered with her boyfriend as she got up, her backpack spewing off sparks. \"Kitty's a-\", but was cut off by the crew. \"We're going down! You guys are gonna have no choice but to jump now! We're not sure if this plane'll survive the crash landing!\" \"Alright!\" Butch yelled back. \"Been an honor!\" \"Good luck,\" was the response as the ramp was lowered. Dutch leaped out, followed by the remainder of the task force except for the German Shepherds. \"Guys!\" Diggs yelled as he tried to fix his girls equipment with his sister. \"No time for heroics, get out of here with us!\" \"Negative!\" the copilot said. \"No time left!\" There was a pause, followed by, \"CRAP! More missiles!\" The aircraft shook, launching the trio out as a single SAM finally destroyed it. But a certain female did not observe that particular event... What do you think? Continue or stop?[Chapter 5] ME: Alright! Time to see what happened to three certain dogs... DUM DUM DUM! Alright people! I've got MAJOR tests this week that I'll only have four hours each for! And they determine whether I get held back or not practically! And my Mother is telling me I need to focus more on school. So, in the event this is my last update, THE FANFICS I MAKE MUST GO ON! Wow, drama on my part. \"Diggs!\" Shovel screamed. \"What is it sis?\" Her brother was really concerned at this point. \"Desirees unconscious!\" \"What?\" the other German Shepherd said. \"Ah, get over to her and pop her 'chute for her! You're closer!\" \"I'm on it bro,\" Shovel responded. She did as told and managed to get to Desiree. \"Crap!\" \"Now what Shovel?\" \"I can't reach it! I'll use my own-ah come on!\" \"Shove?\" His sister shook her head. \"I can't pop my own, mine got disable along with Desirees! Been nice...\". Before she could continue, Diggs threw his pack to her. Included in the contents was his chute. \"Diggs!\" Wow Diggs is devoted to his sister and his girlfriend! Will this be the end of our hero! And NO I am NOT a Pokemon fan! Reviews please![Chapter 6] ME: Alright Marines! We're back to the story of... TASK FORCE ZERO! But for now back to the paper pushers. Okay that was weird. Even for us fanfic guys. Lou punched the wall in his office. So far he knew the plane had been shot down-none of the crew bailed out-his mentor and eleven other agents were possibly dead, and on top of that, Kitty Galore knew they were after her right now. \"We're getting an anonymous call sir,\" an assistant said suddenly. \"We don't know whom it's from, but we've got measures if it's Kitty Galore with her 'virus'.\" \"Very well,\" the Beagle said in resignation. \"Get me online with him-or her.\" \"Yes Director,\" was the loyal response as soon the leader of the Canine Intelligence Service. The caller was soon speaking . \"Get on with it Kitty,\" were his initial words. \"I am not a cat or a dog Director Lou,\" was all that was said. Clearly whoever was contacting HQ was using a voice scramble. Standard intelligence agency stuff. \"A pigeon? Come to pay respects towards the late Seamus?\" \"All you need to know sir is that I'm not the kind of species you work with frequently. My superior has liked to inform you of the following few facts.\" \"Hang on.\" Lou checked his computer, making sure the frequency was encrypted. \"All right, go ahead please.\" \"Alright. Kitty Galore has had her personal robot kill off both her former pet mouse and that lovestruck cat. In addition, the agents that parachuted from the transport are still alive-at least for now. 'Paws' as we know may come to finish them off. Kitty Galore is in Hollywood. She's gonna hack the servers from a specially-modified laptop and turn all formerly friendly cats and dogs into mindless savages.\" \"Good to know,\" the Director said, somewhat remorseful at the Scrumptious and Pinkie were both dead due to their connections. \"I'll pass that on to my agents when I get the chance. Anything else?\" \"Kitty's a pawn in a large game of chess,\" was what the voice said next. \"She's just a puppet for the FLL. This is a lot deeper that 'Cat vs. Dog' sir. Out.\" With that Lou was left to wonder what had happened. I've got stuff to do later on today guys. This'll be your treat for the weekend. And a 'thank you' to everyone who has reviewed or read ANY thing I wrote. 1-1 Marines, at least for now, out![Chapter 7] ME: Okay! Here's my SECOND update in TWO DAYS for the story of... TASK FORCE ZERO! Desiree woke up. She remembered explosions, screams, all before getting knocked out. She heard moaning, however, and looked down to find her boyfriends sister, Shovel. The other German Shepherd had a pained expression on her face. \"Shovel?\" she whispered softly. \"Shovel?\" The tech expert only nodded. \"I feel like I got hit by a express subway, then a cop car after a mobster, then a fire engine en route to a burning gas station AND then a taxi eager for riders.\" Desiree shook her head and laughed. \"You're definitely from New York. Where's your brother?\" Shovel winced. \"Is something wrong?\" she asked. \"Yeah,\" Shovel remarked, not wanting to talk about her brother. \"Hang on,\" Desiree consoled her. She hauled Shovel up and laid her down against a tree. \"I'll get Chocolate or Gauze. They'll take care of you. We'll take down Kitty Galore. Lou's gonna award us medals. I'm sure Butch and Dutch'll throw a bacon celebration at HQ. Diggs and I'll settle down, I'm gonna give birth to a litter, you'll be called 'Auntie Shovel'-\" Before the German Shepherd could continue, a branch snapped. She turned, rifle raised... And found herself staring at her friend, paws in the air. \"Don't shoot,\" was that was said. She sighed in relief. \"Shovel's hurt Dutch.\" The Anatolian Shepherd nodded. \"I'll get the rest of the Task Force over here.\" She got on the radio. \"Butch? Honey, are you there?\" \"King reporting in. Use proper call signs Queen. Over.\" Dutch giggled, somewhat comparable to a pup just in the academy. \"I've got Desiree and Shovel over at my location. The latter may be wounded.\" She paused, adding, \"Over.\" \"Roger that. Everyone else'll be there by-wait, where's Diggs? Over.\" \"Don't know,\" she replied. \"Might have landed farther away. Over.\" There was a brief silence. \"Understood. Logger's got your location. We're en route, ETA five minutes, over.\" \"Copy,\" Dutch said. \"Dutch out.\" She got off before being reprimanded and turned to Shovel. \"All right, hang in there kid. Help's on the way.\" Shovel weakly nodded and pulled out her rifle. Before anything else was said, a noise was heard. \"What was that?\" Desiree said. The three females looked around. \"Okay,\" Dutch said as she took charge. \"Here's the plan; Desiree, stay here.\" \"But-\" \"No 'buts'.\" She glanced at their apparently injured comrade. \"Watch over your friend here. Butch asked, you were-and are -under my orders.\" She sighed. \"Watch over Shovel. Wilco.\" Dutch made her way into an alley. Night vision was good, but not terribly good, and now she was alone. She eventually found a dumpster. It moved slightly. Ah. She knocked on it, patiently waiting... And finding a head pop out of the top. Disgusting. \"What happened?\" a familiar male voice said. Ah. Diggs had been in some less then reasonable places lately. She got to the top and pulled him out, pulling off a banana peel as she did. \"We've got Operation Light in the Dark Agent Diggs.\" \"Alpha One,\" Butchs voice suddenly called. \"Come in. Say again, Alpha One, come in. What's your status? Over.\" Diggs answered the call. \"One here boss. I'm okay. Dutch is with me, over.\" There was a tone of bewilderment. \"What? She's with you kid? Over.\" Diggs was confused. \"Roger that, she's with me. Hey, I've got Desiree, not-\" There was a scream over the radio. \"Shovel!\" Diggs screamed. \"Ah crap,\" Dutch muttered as she ran over with her companion back to the owner of the voice. The two rushed in, rifles raised... And found Desiree crouched down, inspecting Shovels apparent wounds. The remaining 'Zero' members called in. \"Anyone hit?\" \"Hang on!\" \"Wait one more minute!\" Diggs noticed something; a splinter in his siblings hind paw. \"Hang on sis,\" he said as he pulled it out. She yelped and the other two dogs promptly turned to glare, only to see the offending piece of wood. \"Relax, she's okay!\" \"It hurt!\" \"Yeah,\" Catherine said as she strolled in, \"Miss Tough 'Big Apple', I bet it did.\" There was some cruel laughter next. If Shovel was human, she'd be blushing a bright crimson. Diggs, however, cleared his throat and saved her. \"We've got the entire task force assembled,\" he said professionally-and unusual for him. \"That's what matters.\" Just then, the Director of the CIS dropped in. \"Task Force Zero, this is HQ. Do you read me? Over.\" Butchs status as the senior of the group made him be the one to answer. \"Yes I do Director. Task Force Zero is ready, all members present and accounted for, one possibly lightly wounded-never mind that, it was only a splinter. No idea on the crew though. Over.\" There was a pause. \"Alright then Butch. We've received intelligence indicating Pinkie and Scrumptious are both dead. We have a possible fix, say again, possible fix on Kitty. I'll send the coordinates in three, two, one...\" Butch glanced at the numbers in his HMD. \"Coordinates received Lou. We'll be there ASAP, over.\" \"Affirmative Butch. HQ out.\" Butch whispered the coordinates to Logger. The Pit Bull nodded and entered them in. A route materialized and showed a great distance before she began her briefing. \"Location is Universal Studios Hollywood. Guess Kitty thought hiding in plain sight isn't obvious to us by now. However, we're roughly twelve miles away, and that's a considerable distance to cover on paw.\" Shovel smirked. \"What is it?\" \"Typical city gal logic.\" I actually did research for the distance. Yeah I'm reusing the whole theme park shield. Sorry for that. I don't own Cats and Dogs. And stay tuned for the 'typical city gal logic'. 1-1 Marines, for now, out![Chapter 8] ME: This is chapter eight, courtesy of 1-1 Marines! I've got a MAJOR test next week, plus I hope to work on the novel I mentioned (don't think I'll give out hints). So this may be my only update for a while. If I fail this test, let's just say someone else is gonna have to pick up my work on this site. I suggest those of you who can print my stories off if I don't show signs of life in May. Or if I post something along the lines of, \"AHH! I HAVE TO KISS THE INTERNET GOOD-BYE AND SAY HELLO TO TEXTBOOKS!\", I suggest some of you print off my work. Or commit them to memory. Either way, I've gotta pass for the show to go on. Unfortunately this chapter wont have too much action. \"So Miss Galore,\" came the voice from the iMac, \"I trust you are doing well?\" \"All targets that I marked are down for the count,\" she said. \"Local CIS and MEOWS operatives have been eliminated. My carriers, my own personal rival Tinkles from the Feline Liberation Front and his lacky seem to be on vacation. Not to mention the MacDougall mercenaries. And a plane was just shot down.\" \"Understood. 'Call of the Wild' is to be yelled. Right now .\" Kitty shook her head. Useless since her fellow evil doer couldn't see her. \"Not yet.\" \" What? \" \"I said, 'Not yet'. There a problem?\" \"Why not right now?\" The other villain said. \"You've got an Apple product for Petes sake! Just push the buttons and let the CD you have topple humanity!\" \"Stupid teenage brats are hogging all the WiFi,\" she said. \"The late Steve Jobbs didn't prepare for that. Until Universal Studios Hollywood closes at eight, my paws are tied with duct tape behind my back.\" \"But that's thirty minutes from now!\" \"Then I'll wait thirty minutes,\" she said, genuinely confused by the hostility her colleauge was displaying. \"Wait, do you think-.\" \"Never mind! Just drink some milk or something!\" Hang up. Quite rude. Kitty Galore, however, poured a glass for herself solely due to the mysterious individuals advice. People were mean sometimes! Burping, she then decided that the possibility of the agents being alive was roughly a zero to a quintillion. Only cats could land on their feet. Right? THAT was for humor. Just illustates Kitty isn't alone and all. Hope you \"dogs\" liked your treat as Gustavo Rock would put it. Until further notice, 1-1 Marines out![Chapter 9] Alright, here comes the next chapter of the story of... TASK FORCE ZERO! Be advised, there is a South Park reference... \"Alright,\" Butch said as they approached Union Station, \"we're at Union Station Shovel. What's your plan?\" The much younger German Shepherd smiled. \"We hop onboard a Red Line train, get down to Universal City Station and move on Paw from there. Only problem is they've got a no cute animals policy.\" \"We'll just sneak around and get on top,\" Diggs said. They all glanced at him, so he added, \"Look, we've all jumped out of a plane that had taken a surface-to-air missile already and was losing altitude quickly. A subway'll be nothing.\" \"Yeah man,\" Boots said. \"Just hoping I won't have to jump off bro.\" \"You already did,\" Chocolate muttered in annoyance. \"Yeah. Oops on that.\" Dutch shook her head. \"Let's just get this over with so we can get back to HQ and take a catnap. Right Catherine?\" \"Very funny,\" the Russian Blue shot back. She turned to their recon expert. \"Seamus, you're gonna have to get airborne. No place for a pigeon here.\" \"Good,\" Seamus replied. \"It was bad enough back at Alcatraz. If you THINK I'll below ground again-unless you count Lous office and all back at CIS-you don't know this bird.\" \"Just get in the sky!\" Butch snapped. \"Magic word?\" \"PLEASE!\" \"Alright, I'm going!\" The only non-mammal in the group flew off. \"Oh great, thanks!\" \"You're very welcome kind sir!\" The Anatolian Shepherd shook his head and went to Desirees tech expert. \"ETA Logger?\" \"Could be anyone from fifteen-to-thirteen minutes,\" the Pitbull said. \"Trust me, I looked it up.\" \"Nerd.\" \"This nerd's gave us a good idea of our journeys duration,\" Butch growled. \"So shut up or everyone but me and Beta Four is gonna drop and give me fifty . Am I clear?\" \"Sir yes sir!\" \"Alright then, move it!\" Getting in the ventilation system, the eleven operatives then ventured down. Finding the station, they dropped down on a passenger car. \"Alright,\" Butch muttered, \"now's time to find a Eastbound-,\". As luck would have it, the six-vehicle train convieniently was now departing the station. Although Alpha and Beta as well as Catherine quickly reacted, Butch and Dutchs older age meant the two nearly fell off. \"DESIREE! DIGGS!\" the two yelled out as they gripped the subway train. \"Hang on!\" the other couple reacted as they grabbed their mentors paws, only to discover their considerable weight. Catherine, still attempting to get up-she had learned not cats didn't always land on their paws-could only watch as the two teams pulled up her superiors. \"Whew!\" Roy muttered as he caught his breath. \"Man you guys are FAT!\" \"WE ARE NOT FAT!\" They shrieked. \"Yes you two are fat!\" Diggs said. \"Diggs is right!\" Gauze snapped. \"Last week, you two single- handedly ruined the California agents otherwise acceptable performance on the first-ever Joint Directors Fitness Test! Seriously, lay off the liver treats!\" Chocolate nodded. \"Uncle Lou and Director Tab Lazenby held a conference over our new computer network solely to lecture us on the importance of being in shape. You two had your medical records shown and were the prime examples. Wait, you guys were the only examples.\" Before their subordinates could berate them further, the fact they were going into a tunnel made both Dutch and Butch get knocked out by a wall, forcing their underlings to help them once more. \"Mom!\" a girl inside the subway train said, \"there's a dogs leg outside!\" \"That's it!\" 'Mom' said. \"I'm taking you to the hospital as soon as this thing stops! You've been seeing all sorts of things all year!\" \"But it's right there!\" \"Don't you argue with me!\" Wow. Sorry Kiernan Shipka, but I could not resist subjecting your character to further trouble. Guess kids observe stuff more often than adults! Hope you liked this little fic![Chapter 10] ME: Sorry I haven't touched this story in nearly a month. I've got housework courtesy of my Mother this weekend, Memorial Day and the premiere of RvB Season 10. Plus a three week vacation (I go to Buffalo via plane Thursday; I know, lucky spoiled redneck me) in which I may not have WiFi access all the time. In the event any of you guys want this story to hurry up, feel free to write your own version. \"See anything Carrier?\" inquired Butch over the radio. \"Negative Butch, um, I mean King,\" the Pigeon replied. \"I'm getting close, but not that close, over.\" The Anatolian Shepherd nodded to himself. \"Alright, just please report in when you've got a visual on Universal Studios or anything unusual happens. King out.\" With that he turned to the rest of Task Force Zero. \"Okay guys, we all now the game plan. Soon as we get to our stop, we sneak out and hit Kitty with everything we've got. There will not be any backup whatsoever, let me say that again, we will not be get reinforcements. Zip, zero, nada.\" The leader of Zero glanced at his two tech specialists. \"Logger and Shovel, you two are gonna be in charge of slicing into Kittys wifi. Do whatever it takes to prevent her from accessing the Internet.\" Now it was time for the commanders of Alpha and Beta. \"Diggs and Desiree, I want both of you to take out any hostile as soon as you get a chance. Then he looked at Alpha Four. \"Gauze, in addition to pulling gunner duty with Logger, you and Chocolate are to patch up any injured team mates.\" \"Like you do to your gluttonous appetie?\" Catherine asked. \"Shut it Cat,\" Dutch muttered. Everyone else chuckled at Dutchs \"insult\", but Butch just glarred and continued. \"Roy and Boot, if either of you get close to Galore, darken her precious green eyes. Same for you Chocolate if you're not nursing a downed animal.\" \"What about me and Dutch?\" A certain Russian Blue asked. \"I am in charge and Dutch is my second-in-command,\" Butch growled. \"You just get to tag along as the liaison even though Seamus is the only other non canine in the entire task force.\" There was the distinct noise of typing, and all but one soul onboard the train turned to find Shovel typing. Her tablet indicated she was on Facebook, clearly somehow bored despite the situation. Tool from Big Apple: Wow my boss just made a big speeach sounded like one of those crazy old coaches in one of the football movies. Either that or an overenthusiasthic team captain that is legally insane. Ten people like this. One person dislikes this. There was agrowl and Shovel noticed Butch behind her, holding a out of place electronic device. \"Oh hey sir. I didn't know you had a smartphone.\" \"Facebook accounts became mandatory last month,\" he replied. \"And I can't carry around a computer all day long or anything, so this was the alternative.\" \"Understood,\" she replied as Diggs sister promptly logged off and closed her browser. \"So just how are Logger and I gonna be able to hack Kittys 'Net?\" \"That's for you two techies,\" he muttered. \"I've got the overall battle plan. Logger, what's our ETA?\" \"Getting to Point B-AKA UC Station-in about five minutes. I know Shovel, shutting her down isn't gonna be easy.\" \"Speaking of which,\" Desiree asked as she checked her DMR, \"why don't we just shut down the power?\" \"Yeah,\" Diggs agreed. \"Cutting electricity'll be easier than getting the codes.\" \"Someone's gonna notice,\" Dutch replied. \"Plus if Kitty Galore is anything like her profile, she's gonna have some secondary generator or something.\" \"You're overthinking it,\" Catherine shot back. \"We all know Galore may be smart but she lacks common sense.\" \"Wouldn't she have a laptop instead of a desktop?\" Gauze inquired. \"I'm pretty sure evil world domination plans require a bit more processing power,\" Shovel muttered as she tapped a few buttons. \"There, I've got us a route.\" \"Okay, just when are we gonna get-.\" Before that sentence could be completed, the subway suddenly braked and two Shepherd type dogs were launched forward. \"Not again!\" Alright, hope this was worth you guys while. My Mother's gonna be back from the symphony any moment (I know, I come from a pretty afluent family), so this is goodbye for now. She's been getting all over my butt regarding my face. Christ, what did I do to deserve this? 1-1 Marines, signing off to get me some FroYo. Hope this wasn't too bad, out.[Chapter 11] ME: Okay guys. I'm looking to wrap this up soon although this definitely wont be the last chapter. I'm on vacation in Canada and my Grandparents came over for lunch. I haven't seen them in a while so don't expect another update for a few hours or so. STORYTIME! \"Dang boss,\" Boot muttered as he hauled Butch to his hind paws. \"Have you been eating bricks or something?\" The Anatolian Shepherd growled. \"No time for that,\" responded the leader of Task Force Zero. Then he got on the radio. \"Alright Carrier, this is King. Rest of Zero has arrived at the subway station. Get ready for fur to fly, over.\" \"Roger. I'm heading over there-.\" There was brief static, following by a panicked Seamus. \"Ah no, not today-.\" \"Carrier?\" Butch ventured. \"Seamus, tell me what's going on pronto, over!\" There was only a brief cry for help, then the line went dead. \"King!\" a new voice cried out. \"This is HQ! Peeks picked up some traffic from your Pigeon but he's now silent. Please advise and confirm, over!\" Butch gritted his teeth. \"Roger HQ. Call sign Carrier is MIA,\" the old dog paused, \"possibly KIA. Awaiting orders, over.\" His various subordinates shuddered in worry as the reply came in. \"Understood. Butch, you and the rest of the task force are to commence with the final phase of Operation Light in the Dark. But be careful. No reinforcements are available, I say again, no reinforcements are available. Stop Kitty Galores plan. HQ out.\" Butch nodded. \"Alright Zero,\" came his orders. \"Seamus wont be our eye in the sky for the remainder of this mission. No chance of getting backup, so stay alive.\" His ten subordinates sighed and crept out of the subway station and out into the world. They made their way to Universal Studios Hollywood. \"Keep the sunglasses at the ready,\" Dutch warned. With that the 11-strong group infiltrated the theme park, their black uniforms and the large-scale departure of the humans easing their travel. \"Alright,\" Diggs muttered as they got to the building where Galore was apparently hiding. \"Time for grappling hooks.\" \"Yeah,\" Desiree agreed as they all scaled up. \"Too bad we can't use the jetpacks.\" \"Alpha One and Beta One,\" Butch interrupted, \"cut the chatter.\" Finally they got up without further comment. Catherine moved forward but tripped. \"Ugh,\" she remarked as the Russian Blue got up before anyone could assist. She looked down and gasped in shock. There he was. Imprisioned in a cage but alive. \"Seamus!\" they all chanted. Shovel and Logger promptly began fiddling with the lock. \"You're alive!\" \"Guys,\" the bird muttered, \"might wanna run.\" There was then a distinctive purr followed by laughing. \"Listen to bird-brain you idiots!\" ME: CLIFFHANGER! DUN DUN DUN! Looks like we've got a situation here. What's next?[Chapter 12] ME: Okay, here comes the story of Task Force Zero! Sorry I haven't updated in a while. As a warning, though, someone WILL be finished off by the end of the chapter. \"You idiots!\" Kitty shouted. \"You really think Pigeons just disappear then suddenly end up in cages? Are you really that stupid?\" \"Nope,\" Butch said as he casually aimed his assault rifle at her. \"Just show me where your computer is so my techies can shut you down and you'll be interrogated BEFORE your execution!\" \"I'm afraid you'll have to get past this one bodyguard I happen to have,\" Galore purred. \"But he just loves making friends!\" There was a distinctive thud, and all of Zero turned to find the robot known only as \"Paws.\" Kitty had spent a long time building the thing or was just good with inventing stuff in a short amount of time. Why? The robot had miniguns for arms with grenade launchers rising from his arrms (Yeah turns out according to the Internet cats and dogs have arms as well. Then again this is a fanfic.) \"Oh crud,\" Diggs muttered. \"Desiree, Shovel, step back.\" Dutch put a paw on her leaders back, who shrugged it off and did what any good agent would do. He aimed his weapon and fired. All of his bullets slammed into the target-and bounced off. \"What in the name of milkbones?\" \"Oh,\" Kitty replied, \"I don't think any damage was sustained by Paws at all. Without warning, two flamethrowers rose out of Paws forearms, both weapons then spitting out fire at the Task Force. All twelve of the agents rolled or flew out of the area, with two German Shepherds bumping into each other along the way. \"Diggs!\" she yelled at him. \"Shoot out his flamethrowers, I know,\" the male dog replied. Soon enough both of the weapons shut down for reasons unknown. But before they coul be retracted Diggs and Desiree scored a number of hits on them, removing the chance of being cooked alive. Paws roared in fury. his spun-up miniguns now firing in the general direction of the couple. \"Zero!\" Butch yelled over the radio. \"The Ones are keeping him distracted, let's take him down while we still can!\" The eight subordinates he had with him immediately nodded, except for two. \"Wont know how long Paws'll focus on 'em ladies,\" he began. \"I know that boss, but if Logger and I get to use these EMPs we can temporarily shut him down at least!\" Shovel protested. \"They're right Butch!\" Catherine yelled. \"Okay, Alpha Two, Beta Four, both of you standby!\" the Anatolian Shepherd agreed. \"Rest of you lock and load! Everyone waits for my go!\" This time there was universal approval as the two tech specialists readied their weapons while everyone else prepped their firearms. \"For the EMPs,\" he began, \"three, two, one, NOW!\" With that both of the tech specialists fired off the electromagentic pulses. Paws could only pause as he was quite literally stunned. \"He's down, finish him off Zero!\" was the order. At that every single bullet-using weapon was fired with Diggs and Desiree having come out of cover and the techs having grabbed their standard-issue equipment. With all the blows he was taken Paws was knocked down. A lucky hit got one of his grenade launchers and cooked them all off, taking the robot out for at least a while. \"Don't think we're clear yet,\" Dutch said as she rose up. \"We still have a job to do!\" \"And me,\" a certain bald cat added. Kitty stepped into view with a grenade launcher and took aim at her. \"No!\" Butch yelled as he shoved Dutch out of the way. The explosion launched him off the building. \"Well that was-,\" Kitty began, but she was cut off by sharp discharges of weapons. \"This is for Butch!\" Diggs yelled as he ran down the building. Eventually he found the computer Galore was using, an iMac. \"Okay, this thing isn't portable so we can-.\" Suddenly all the lights and the desktop shut off. \"Next time you kids outta make these power thingies bulletproof.\" ME: Precisely whom said that last line? I know this chapter was kinda rushed and all but don't worry, this isn't the end (yet). Excuse me if it's really THAT bad or anything. Any ideas on what happened to Kitty? Think Paws wont be a pain anymore?[Chapter 13] ME: Okay, some of you may think Butch is dead. Let's see if you're right or not... \"Boss!\" Boot shouted as the Anatolian Shepherd came into view. \"You're alive!\" \"That you're correct on,\" Butch said. Dutch nuzzled, Diggs sighed in relief and patted him on the back, but Butch had to get to business. \"HQ, this is King. ' Repeat, HQ, this is King. Please respond, repeat, please respond. Over.\" \"Roger that King,\" a certain Beagle said. \"Status report, over.\" \"Kitty Galore has been neutralized, I repeat, Kitty Galore has been neutralized. Operation Light in the Dark was a complete success, over.\" \"Understood. Any casualties? Over.\" \"Carrier got captured but is still alive,\" Butch answered glancing at the Pigeon. \"He looks fine but I think we should let him rest for awhile. Alpha Ones sister had a splinter. We didn't bother to treat it with the mission so it could've been infected. I fell on one of my legs roughly. Still can walk but I'm starting to get to old for this. Please advise, over.\" \"Copy. Alright, standby.\" There was a considerable silence on the radio. There was peace during that time apart from the remains of Paws being blown up by Shovel and Logger. As robot parts landed around him Butch found his former student get bacl with him. \"Alright King. Sorry for the delay but I needed to see you guys get back personally. Over.\" Butch noticed his subordinates were listening in based on their expressions. Signaling it wasn't wise angirly with his paw, they all apologized and decided to kick around Paws head. Except for Seamus who began playing tic-tac-toe with himself. \"-King? Over.\" \"Sorry boss,\" Butch apologized. \"Had to deal with Zero. Please repeat, over.\" \"Hang on for fifteen minutes. Before you ask YES I had evac waiting for you guys. And we have a lot to talk about my friend. Over.\" \"Oksy sir. Just what is it about? Over.\" \"Let's just say it concerns the future of your task force. Out.\" ME: Gee, wonder what Lou wants to do with Task Force Zero? I'll give you a hint; twenty-four letters/words in the Greek Alphabet, and so far there's only Alpha and Beta. Keep in mind that I didn't have breakfast when I wrote this, so it may not be my best chapter yet.[Chapter 14] ME: Okay, now back to Task Force Zero. Here we discuss the future of the most elite CIS/MEOWS unit in history. And get our heroes back. True to his word, Lou was onboard the extraction aircraft sent to retrieve the twelve agents. After fifteen minutes it finally arrived. \"Nice work everyone!\" Lou said with a professional smile-if his look could be called that. He glanced towards Paws remains. \"I trust explosions occured in regards towards that robot over there.\" \"Yes sir,\" Logger and Shovel confirmed. \"Very well. Engineers and technicians wont be pleased, but thankfully without Paws or Kitty Galore we can breathe easier,\" the Beagle continued. \"By neutralizing Kitty Galore and her operation, Task Force Zero has stopped a major threat to all of canine and feline kind. You will all be commended.\" \"Just doing our jobs boss,\" Diggs said modestly. \"Enough chit-chat,\" Butch moaned. \"I'm really getting too old for this Lou!\" \"That you are,\" CISes Director agreed. \"Let's all come aboard!\" With that Zero was picked up and the three casualties among them treated. Shovel was alright but somewhat sensitive regarding her \"wound.\" Seamus didn't even remotely act like he was in a cage. Butch would be confined to bed for a long time and have paperwork as his companion. Eventually they all got back to base. The teams, a certain Pigeon and Catherine all decided to turn in their equipment for repairs and upgrades while Lou led off both Butch and Dutch to his office. \"You two know how there are twenty-four words in the Greek Alphabet?\" \"Yes sir,\" the two Anatolian Shepherds answered. \"And Alpha and Beta are only the first two of all of them.\" \"What are you suggesting kid?\" Butch asked warily. \"I'm suggesting we get eighty-eight more agents so there can be Gamma, Delta, Epsilon, Zeta, Eta-. You get the idea.\" ME: Looks like we're gonna get 22 four-agent teams for Task Force Zero. You know how I said on other stories how I was looking for OCs and stuff as well as on the Alpha and Omega and Balto archives I was asking for suggestions? This is the reason. But this ISN'T the last chapter. I'm glad we're bringing this story to a close soon. Should I write a sequel?[Chapter 15] ME: Okay, I was stuck in airports and planes for hours on end yesterday. And it hit me; kill time by finally completing a story of mine. Thank Mojotheomegawolf for his help in wrapping all of this up. The secretive nature of the Canine Intelligence Service (CIS) prevented the ceremony from being public, but it's Director, a Beagle known as Lou, didn't mind as he took the podium. \"Special Agent-in-Charge Butch!\" he sounded off. \"Yes sir!\" the Anatolian Shepherd responded. Lou pinned the award on his uniform. \"For outstanding leadership of Task Force Zero and bravery in fighting one of the greatest enemies of canines and felines everywhere, you have earned the Cross of Valiance. Congratulations Agent Butch.\" \"Just doing my duty kid,\" the older dog replied modestly. \"Hold on.\" With that Lou withdrew another medal. \"You got blown off a roof but still cut the power. For that, I present you the Medal of Preservance for obeying orders and completing the mission in spite of personal handicaps.\" Next up was Seamus. \"Supervisory Special Agent Seamus, I am proud to award you the Legion of Unwilling Captivity for being detained by unlawful forces.\" The remainder of the ceremony was rather boring until Lou revealed twelve identical awards that no one had seen before. \"Sir?\" \"These, ladies and gentlemen, are Task Force Zeros own Operation Light in the Dark Stars! No pun intended before any of you ask that, as field operatives the CIS and MEOWS was able to prevent a cyber attack that would've led to the destruction of society as we know it and the subjugation of all those good on this planet.\" \"Thank you sir,\" Butch asked as he eyed the unvealed decorations. \"Just why now do you show them off?\" \"I figured you all getting them at once would be more meaningful than having you all line up to recieve your own individually. Plus, these are the kinds of things that'll be done on an increasing scale as time goes on and Zero is expanded.\" \"Sir?\" Diggs asked confused. \"I'm sorry we kept this from you guys,\" Dutch said, \"but the Director's stepping up the Task Force. We're gonna get twenty-two more teams and eighty-eight more heavily-armed spies.\" The initial cheerfullness left the room. Lou sighed and took a deep breath. \"Before any of you dismiss yourselves, it is time to discuss the future of Task Force Zero. Sorry I have to do this at such an inappropriate time. With rogue terrorists like Kitty Galore and Mr. Tinkles running rampant and free the Earth is increasingly dangerous for cats and dogs. As of right now Director Lazenby and I am preparing for evaluations.\" \"Zero,\" Butch took over, \"is to become the primary arm of CIS and MEOWS PHYSINT (Physical Intelligence) gathering branches. Whenever conventional agents or regular military special forces units cannot be sent in we will answer the call. We are beyond top-secret here; heck, most of the guys in HQ right now haven't the slightest clue of our existence.\" \"So we're basically black-on-black James Bond?\" Desiree asked with a note of worthy. \"Affirmative in some ways and negative in others. Just remember; we are the sword and shield now of canine and feline kinds. And we will swing and block truely in our vigilance.\" ME: Sorry if this chapter was really bad or anything for the epilogue, I overslept since I slept in my own bed for the first time in nearly three weeks and skipped breakfast for lunch. Plus a certain someone is annoyingly loudly laughing nearby me (punches fist into palm). I CAN HEAR YOU YOU PIECE OF-! Never mind that. Oh, and now we've got eighty-eight agents. I'm looking for eithers felines or canines. Mention what kind they are, if they're OC or a canon character, what two specializations they have (marksman, paw-to-paw, CQC (with shotgun/SMG/other short range weapon), Team leader, second-in-command, tech, machine gunner, medic... Look, here's an example from Alpha and Omega: Garth Type of Feline/Canine: Wolf OC or Canon character: Canon Looks: Flaming crimson fur with a cream-white underbelly and green eyes. Positions on team/specializations: Team leader and paw-to-paw expert. Personality: He may seem arrogant on the outside at first but really dedicated to the mission and his team. Insecure at times due to inital low-quality howling skills as well as a shaky relationship with his father. Despite being an Alpha Garth may or may not goof off with team mates and comrades. If he is off-duty and not in the field that is. Gear: Standard black uniform modified for increased freedom of movement. Helmet radio modified to enable him to stay in touch with superiors better and more effectively coordinate with his team and other Task Force members. Carries a full-sized assault rifle as well as a backup sidearm and knife. Style: As soon as he gets his orders from HQ Garth informs his subordinates and starts to think up a plan-one that inevitably will fall apart whenever enemies open fire. In the event of being unable to shoot his targets Garth can stab opponents with his knife or simply pound them with his bare paws. Okay, now we know what I'm looking for. Although if you've got support personnel like analysts, pilots or technicians they'd be great too! Thanks to anyone who's reading this for staying with me. I'm sorry for being lazy at times when it comes to updating. I hope you all enjoyed Puppy Love: Continued! Also since it looks like the main villains are out who'll be the bad guy/girl? And what will they do to get on Zeros radar? ","Summary":" ATTENTION: Due to my friend FlyPandaBear being bogged down with various duties, I, the humble 1-1 M"},{"Movie":"Miss Congeniality","Title":"Tell You Everything","Author":"wildthing0088","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3908301","Passage":"[Chapter 1] \"Cheryl!\" Gracie yelled, avoiding the belting of the roses and the nips of pain from the thorns, \"Cheryl! Give me the crown!\" How could she be so stupid! Morningside's bomb was gonna blow her to shit! \"No! No! Get your own!!\" Cheryl screamed back. She hit Gracie back with the flowers, without a single red petal remaining, then walked forward as Stan continued to announce. No. No goddamn way… Gracie ran forward and yanked the crown from Cheryl's hair. Finally… She looked for the little device, somewhere on the crown… Mary Jo grabbed her wrists. \"Gracie, goddammit, it's Cheryl's!\" \"No, you don't understand!\" \"Give the damn thing back!\" They were both yelling at the same time, yanking back and forth. That thing could go off at anytime… Gracie's fist knocked Miss Texas backwards into the crowd, arms flailing. She frantically searched again for Morningside's little contraption. The sounds all around her, audience members and fellow contestants shrieking in disbelief, a wailing Cheryl, a Texas drawl vowing revenge and the forcing of someone to pay for a nose job, Stan still rambling on, all melted into a mix of yells and cries. Aha! The little black box was on the inside of the crown, tucked behind some diamonds. Where was the off switch?? Eric looked out from behind Styrofoam Lady Liberty, hodling Frank down. The remote had fallen down at least twelve feet, hopefully it had broken or was buried under confetti. He saw Gracie take out the redhead and clutch the shiny crown. Blonde movement caught his eye, and he looked just below the staircase to see Morningside's head, holing a little black remo- \"GRACIE!!!\" He yelled. She looked back at him just as the tiara beeped.[Chapter 2] SpiritoftheBlackRose: Thanks! This one's early, just for you. The explosion silenced the whole convention center, probably everyone watching on TV. Everyone stopped screaming and yelling for a few seconds, in total disbelief at what had happened. A single thought traveled all around the stage, the audience, up to the TV booth. What the heck just happened? Morningside had been knocked to the ground, and Frank just stopped, staring at the stage in total disbelief. Eric threw the bastard aside and leapt to the stage, sprinting and dodging through the ladies and the security guards. He shoved a finally silent Stan aside. The closer he got, the more blood and incredulity he saw. Vic got to her first, gently cooing and calming the trembling, bleeding, sprawled Miss New Jersey. Her dress had torn, and the deep scarlet staining the pale lavender fabric. \"Gracie…\" Vic held her hand, and Eric fought his urges to lift her head. If her neck was broken… Her face was pale, blood dribbling from numerous cuts and etches in her skin. Both arms were soaked in blood. Her chest was shredded and sliced open, a pool of blood in each rip in the skin. Nothing in the book, even the last time he'd looked at it, described this. He took off his jacket, and motioned Vic to do the same. Grant and Jensen both ran up, followed by McDonald. \"Ah, shit, Hart…shit, shit, shit!\" The normally impassive assistant director stared down at the open body while Eric covered the wounds, as best he could, with strips from his and Vick's jackets. \"Get Morningside…both of 'em!\" Eric yelled, not caring who listened. The last thing they'd need was for the perpetrators to get away. The three men ran to the other side of the stage, leaving him and Vick to tend to Gracie's wounds. The other girls, the ones who Gracie'd sacrificed herself for all huddled around, staring in disbelief. They were murmuring to each other, whispers of \"Whoa, what happened?\", \"It was a bomb!\" and \"Gracie!\" surrounding them. Two paramedics showed up with a stretcher. They carefully lifted her and buckled her in. Eric followed them out to the ambulance, holding Gracie's hand. Vic trailed them, silent. \"Are either of you immediate family?\" The short female asked as the stretcher was lifted into the back of the EMS vehicle. \"Tell me as soon as you find out…I'll tell the others.\" Vic told Eric, his voice quiet. Eric turned back to him, standing at he curb. \"Vic…\" \"Go on, get up in there.\" \"Vic-\" \"Get in there- she'd rather you than me.\" Eric sighed and climbed in. There was barely enough room, but the paramedics let him sit over her and hold her hand. IV's had already been inserted into her arms. Gauze pads and Ace bandages were wrapped around her abdomen, arms, and covered her face. She had beat him, quite painfully, only a few hours before; now she was the one on the stretcher on her way to the ER. Something so strong and powerful, now wrapped in bandages and on the brink of- He couldn't think it. 'C'mon Gracie, you can do this…I'm right here…\" He didn't know what else to say. The sirens went off, and they sped to San Antonio Memorial, while the Morningside's were off to the S.A.P.D.[Chapter 3] MarianaTeresia, ELM-Tree10, & pitaqueen: Thank y'all for the support. SpiritoftheBlackRose: Here's a cold compress. Put it on your forehead and elevate your feet. Fainting is not fun. Nevermindthebuttocks: Thank you! I'm not sure if I'll put more of #2 in here, I've only been able to watch it once before turning SportsCenter back on. Thanks y'all for being so patient. I've been accepted at college so I can get back to writing. I've got another new chapter ready to go by 1/30. Machines surrounded the bed. It had taken them three hours to stabilize Gracie, and she wasn't entirely out of the woods yet. Most of her ribs were broken, and both her wrists were fractured and she had a moderate concussion. But bone fragments had punctured her right lung, liver, and stomach. She'd been unconscious for the trip, and woke up in the ER scaring the shit out of everyone including herself. The only way to calm her down was to put her in a medically induced coma. They'd operate in 36 hours. Vic was keeping the nighttime vigil at Gracie's bedside. Eric and the rest of the FBI camp were back at the hotel; same with the newly crowned Miss United States and the remaining contestants. MacDonald refused to let anyone leave until everything was sorted out. Even Stan was back at the hotel, and Vic was thankful he was at Gracie's bedside. There were a handful of reporters lurking the hospital, yet MacDonald was adamant on giving them wrong room numbers. It was funny, Vic thought to himself as he stared down at the still body in bed; he thought he'd seen everything. Girls' tearing each others dresses onstage; girls throwing up the second before heading out in the bikini; sprinkling cayenne pepper and paprika on others' lipstick. Heck, one gargled Clorox to whiten her teeth. Bu he'd never seen anyone get torn apart. Her cry of fury as she threw Eric to the ground reminded him once again how no one messed with her, same with the glare she gave him as she held a cocked gun to his head. Morningside and Frank would be added to a long list as soon as she got out of here. His eyes glanced down at the red on his clothes; he hadn't had a chance to change. Gracie's beautiful dress had to be peeled from her torn body. He was glad he hadn't had the chance to see that. He glanced up as the door opened and Eric walked in. There was an immistakable deadness in his eye, the exact oppose of the one he glared as he ran back to the convention center to do his job only hour before. Now he sat over Gracie, her bandaged hand in his, staring at her. \"I didn't think they were going to let you in.\" Vic said, trying to break the monotonous beeping of the monitors and machines. \"I can get in almost anywhere with the badge.\" His eyes never left Gracie's heavily bandaged face. \"She's going to be all right, won't she, Matthews?\" Eric sighed. \"Yeah, she's a fighter, just like Mom.\" \"Her mother was an agent?\" Vic was suddenly horrified with the idea of another woman just like Gracie: quick to fight, never to brush. \"Yeah, Harte was amazing. Broke every barrier for women in the FBI. Won every award and honor they thought of. Courage, Gun Accuracy, Neatest Office, you name it. Big shoes for her little girl to fill. She was killed in action about nine years ago, when Gracie was in college. Gracie joined the day after she graduated.\" He hesitated. \"She's as smart as hell and as tough as nails. A bit quick to react, but it's all instinct.\" Vic sat back in the plastic chair. Eric continued to massage Gracie's bandaged hand. Vic smiled to himself as Eric leant forward and gently kissed the little patch of exposed skin on Gracie's face. \"Gracie Lou…\" he whispered. Vic stood up and left. He knew she was safe now. Besides, a quick change of clothes would do him good.[Chapter 4] ELM-Tree10: The pageant took place at the San Antonio convention center, sorry if I confused you. Thanks for the review! LoverOfWords: Oh crap, thanks for noticing the misspelling. I think I fixed everything. Thanks! I'm still working on the next few chapters, I've got a bunch of midterms due and a college preview day, so two in a row is a gift. Hopefully I'll have another chapter up before the end of the month. Eric shook himself awake. The ache in his back had been getting progressively worse for the past two nights. The lack of sunlight told him it was ungodly early, a quick glance at the clock told him it was 4:16 in the morning. He glanced over at Gracie's still face. Sure he knew there was medicine keeping her asleep, he still had to check to make sure she was okay. And it wasn't like he dreamt she'd blink a few times and then wake up. Two goddamn days sitting in the room as the doctor walked in and out, leaving the two of them alone. They'd been on assignments before; more often than not she'd be stuck at the desk while he was solo. He'd never felt alone, least not until now. Just him and her. She'd never been this quiet. He arched his back trying to ease the pain. He gave her one quick glance to make sure he was okay, and walked into the bathroom. Splashing the cold water on his face felt good, almost like doing laps. He'd never really had the urge to hit the pool, maybe he'd go while she was in surgery… Nah, she'd kill him. He grabbed some paper towels and wiped his face. They were as smooth as concrete and as flexible as cardboard. He tossed them toward the trash, and after a near-miss, he hastily tossed them back in. He walked back to Gracie's bed. Something clicked in him, today was special…Gracie was coming out of the coma. She had her surgery today. He sat back in the chair. 4:22am. It would be hours before she went into the OR. MacDonald had given him strict orders to stay at the hospital. His first op and he lands his girl in the hospital and the Assistant Director has to take over. At least Macdonald can deal with all the damn reporters. And Stan. His eyes travelled over to the table by the chair, where a book and a Grisham hardcover sat. Jensen had brought him the book from the hotel. He leaned over and grabbed it. Grisham was one of his favorites, encouraging him to join law enforcement but not as an attorney. A Time to Kill was one of his favorites; a burning moral question along with plenty of beer and violence. The intelligent man's book. Sure he'd read it seven or eight times, but hey, it was a classic. He settled in the chair and began to read. The NAACP had just introduced its capital murder lawyers when Dr. Jacobs entered and Jamie, the nurse, following with a gurney. Eric glanced up, and was nearly blinded by the abundance of sunlight. Doc Jacobs was formidable and imposing, and ex-wrestler who became interested in medicine after a career-ending broken femur in his freshman year at TCU. He could explain anything in simple terms and like to give bear hugs. Jamie was a short skinny pole with a dazzling smile and a cheerleader's peppiness. Se was one of the few Nordic skiers in Texas, with enough muscle to almost take down Doc Jacobs. Eric glanced back down at the page number and closed the book. \"Doc Jacobs.\" He said \"Mornin' Eric.\" Jacobs was a true Texan. \"S'bout time we bring Gracie in fer prep. Ain' no point havin' her wait all day. The sooner we wake 'er up, the better off we'll all be.\" Eric nodded. \"How long before she's out, Doc?\" \"Cain' be more than a couple hours. Y'all might wanna be catchin' a nap. \"He motioned to the sofa in the corner of the room.,\"Better now than when she's 'wake.\" He glanced back to see Jamie finish loading Gracie onto the gurney. \"Jamie, y'all be careful now.\" \"Yessir Doc Jacobs.\" \"Dammit Jamie! Y'all know I hate it when ya call me 'sir'!\" \"Yessir.\" She turned and started to push Gracie from the room. Jacobs echanged a look with Eric and followed, yelling out a final \"WATCH OUT FER THE COKE MACHINE!\" Eric sat back in the sofa's soft cushions. The TV remote was near, Grisham not farther. But the couch was already easing the pain from his back, and he felt his eyes close.[Chapter 5] LogicalGoth: Thank you for loving this story, I have more to update, don't worry. SpiritoftheBlackRose: Please sit down before you faint...again... Don't worry about being late to review, seeing as I'm being late to update... hehe I have survived XC skiing...now onto softball. I'm sorry for the delay but between my &#[Chapter 6] SpiritoftheBlackRose: heheh... Thanks as always! star jelly: I'm sorry if it's sad... I try to toss some comedy into each chapter. Thanks for the review! BlackAngel of Paris: Thanks you for the awesome review. The suspense isn't as bad this time around, I promise. Thanks to all you guys for the reviews, I'm shooting for 10 days for the next chapter to be up. GO DALE JR!!! -- Wildthing \"Gracie! GRACIE!\" Eric bent down closer to her face, yelling. He took both her hands and looked right into her eyes. \"Gracie, relax! You're okay! You're okay! You're in the hospital!\" Her hand broke loose and swung for his head. He ducked and bent towards her again. \"It's me Gracie! It's me!\" The hyperventilation continued, but the machine's screaming was slowing down. She was relaxing. \"Cheryl's okay, Vick's okay, and both Morningsides are in jail. Macdonald's got you here until he thinks you're alright. I'm here until you're back on duty…\" She was still panting, but the monitor had finally quit its ear-piercing shrieks. He ran his fingers down her gauze-covered face. Her ACE wrapped hand found his cheek; her smile barely visible under the bandages. He gave her other hand a tight squeeze. The door burst open and Jamie slid into the room, remisicent of Sienfeld 's Kramer. She stopped at Gracie's bed, panting. \"Hear' monitor… 260… Alri'?\" She was bent over and heaving, her eyes focused on Gracie. \"Yeah, she's alright.\" Eric said, incredulous to Jamie's asthmatic entrance. \"She just woke up.\" Jamie nodded, heaving. \"Y'all don' ski up…six goddamn flights a' stairs.\" She put a hand to her pager. \"Nurse's station called me…\" She walked closer to Gracie. \"Name's Jamie. I'm yer nurse… Y'all don' ever hesitate ta call me. Jus' hit the lil' blue button.\" She gave Gracie a pat on the shoulder, and then the unmistakable beep of a pager drew her attention. She glanced down. \"Ah, shit… six floors down.\" She smiled at the both. \"Y'all take care.\" She turned and jogged out. \"She's like that. Wait until you meet Doc Jacobs.\" Eric explained. Gracie laughed, her stomach twitching up and down. \"Harte, you were amazing…\" Eric began, \"I'm so, so sorry… I had no idea what you were trying to tell me when you were onstage. I thought you were calling Macdonald a devil…\" he hesitated, the tears developing in his eyes. \"I was trying to get up behind the statue, and I forgot they were already on high alert 'cuz you were there anyway, and Gracie, I cocked my gun to climb the stairs, and there was a security guard there, he cocked his at my head. I had to beat him off…\" He felt tears in his eyes. \"I had to fight him off, we made a whole lot of noise, and the guard didn't see Frank. If I hadn't cocked that gun…\" His voice trailed off. Her fingers wiped the water from his eyes and she shook her head, telling him it wasn't his fault. He smiled down at her, bending closer and closer to her face. She wrapped her arms around him, and they kissed.[Chapter 7] LogicalGoth: Thanks! SpiritoftheBlackRose: Yeah! Hooray! But don't get too happy...hehehe... Softball has officially started, but I've got one more chapter before some delays. (but if you hit the little review button, I'll write a bit faster...heheh..) \"Gracie Lou!\" Cheryl squealed as threw her arms around her best friend. \"I'm so glad you're gonna be okay!\" Eric grinned from the couch as Gracie was crushed by Miss United States. \"Glad to see you're fine too, Cheryl.\" Gracie managed to say through Cheryl's bear hug. It had been a week since the pageant finale, and Gracie was well on her way to recovery. Her face had lost most of the bandages, only one piece of tape by her left ear and the other covering a nasty cut underneath her right eye. The rest of her face had the rough look of marble; tiny cuts and scrapes were left in the skin from the tiara's diamonds. Her forearms were still wrapped tight, between the fractured wrists and second-degree burns she had to spend another few days in San Antonio. Cheryl was finally allowed to visit. She released her friend and pulled a thermos from her purse. \"I brought you some hot cocoa.\" \"Oh thanks… How's everyone else?\" Despite Eric's constant reassurance, Gracie was still worried about her friends at the pageant. \"Well the FBI- or would that be you guys?\" Cheryl asked pointing to Gracie and Eric, \"It's still really weird, you being an FBI agent and being assigned to the pageant. If I could've gotten in that way I wouldn't ve had to-\" \"Everyone's okay?\" Gracie interrupted her. \"Oh, yeah. We can FINALLY go home today, and EVERYONE's so excited about that. Remember Miss New York? Karen? Her girlfriend Tina came and picked her up this morning. My parents think she's –\" \"How's Mary Jo?\" \"You broke her nose, but the doctor said she'd be alright. Once we got her some tacos, she calmed down. \" \"Do you think she's still mad at me? I konked her pretty hard.\" \"Gracie…\" Cheryl hesitated, and her voice started to crack. \"We saw… we saw you get blown open. Everyone thought you were trying to steal the crown, and then...\" she trailed off, staring down at the hospital blanket. \"After the bomb went off everything just sort of stopped. We all stopped. Then your coach and him,: She motioned over to Eric, and swallowed. Tears ran down her face. \"They ran over to you. I was crying, because I had just lost my crown, and then you were on the ground, shaking really bad, and they were trying to help you, and the the FBI showed up. No one knew what was going on, we didn't even know if you were…\" She broke into sobs. \"Gracie, I thought you were dead!\" Gracie wrapped her arms around Cheryl, letting her cry. \"Ms. Morningside and Frank…arrested… We all went back…hotel…couldn't leave… My parents called me…I couldn't talk… They finally explained that you were an FBI agent…I thought I was dreaming from all the pizza and beer and tubie thingies… They got me a new crown…\" Gracie held Cheryl tighter. God, crying ws awful. \"Cheryl, Cheryl… I'm alright. I'm gonna be alright. It's my job. It's my job to do what I did. It was your job to win the pageant. You're Miss United States. I'm-\" \"A Hero.\" It was Cheryl's turn to interrupt. She squeezed Gracie tighter. \"Thank you for being such an awesome friend. Here, I- we-have a present for you.\" She dug into her purse once again. \"After the pageant there's always a farewell breakfast, but this year it was postponed, and we had to have it without you. It was really quiet. Everyone prayed before they ate anything, just like you did at orientation.\" She pulled out a big manila envelope. \"Here.\" It took Gracie a few tries to undo the string; she still couldn't use her fingers very well. She finally opened the flap, and pulled out an oversized \"Get Well!\" card. Inside was filled with 49 signatures and phone numbers, along with a piece of folded satin. She unfolded the satin, \" Miss Congeniality \" written in pretty cursive. \"The vote was unanimous.\" \"Oh, Cheryl!\" Gracie threw her arms around Cheryl. Cheryl giggled. The door opened, and Assistant director McDonald walked in. \"Oh, excuse me, m'am, but this is Bureau business. I'm afraid you're going to have to leave.\" \"Oh,\" Cheryl was startled by Gracie and Eric's boss. She immediately stood up. \"That's alright.\" She gave Gracie one final hug before snatching her purse and scurrying from the room. Gracie put her sash back in the envelope, but left the card out. \"How you feeling Hart?\" He asked, looking down at her. \"I'm feeling better, sir.\" McDonald nodded, and turned to Eric. \"Matthews?\" Eric stood up, organized his papers and handed them to McDonald. \"All set with the final reports, sir.\" McDonald scanned the report while Eric settled himself on the edge of Gracie's bed. \"Whoa…\" Gracie whispered. She bent her head forward, massaging her temples. \"Gracie, you alright?\" Eric asked, putting a hand around her. \"Yeah, I think…\" She looked up at McDonald, then over at Eric. She blinked a few times. \"Gracie?\" \"Hart?\" \"Or not…\" Gracie's eyes rolled back as she fell into her pillows. Eric immediately hit the blue button beside the bed.[Chapter 8] SpiritoftheBlackRose: teeheehee... I love it when you complain to me because of cliffhangers...;D kaytieorndorff : Thanks for the review... see above for my policy on cliffhangers. pirate88: YES!! I've been waiting for someone to notice that. Love that book/movie! Thanks for the review!

Sorry about the delay..should be another week for ch 9. :D --Wildthing Eric stared down at Gracie's unconscious form. How long had it been since he hit the button? Ten seconds? Thirty seconds? All he knew was that Jamie wasn't bursting through the door. Yet. McDonald stared at the machines. \"She's got a pulse, Matthews, she's just fainted.\" \"She's supposed to be alright. Where the hell is-\" The door opened and a lanky, gap-toothed nurse jogged in. \"Where's Jamie? \"Wha's tha' matter?\" Both questions were asked in unison, by Eric and the nurse. \"She's fainted.\" McDonald said, motioning to Gracie. The nurse nodded and walked closer to Gracie. She lifted Gracie's hand and stared at the monitor's displays, looking for any uncharacteristic blips on the screen. \"Her bloo' pressure's high,\" the nurse began in an accent rougher than gravel, and put a hand to Gracie's forehead, \"An' she's runnin' a fever. Understand she's been under some stress, bu' there should'n' be trauma this long af'er. What was y'all's doin' 'fore she wen' out?\" \"We were talking, and she sat up and said 'whoa'. We walked if she was okay, then she just passed out.\" Eric said, still staring at Gracie. The nurse picked up Gracie's chart and flipped through the pages. \"Pressure's been high since…Doc switched painkillers.\" She shook her head in realization. \"I'll get Doc ta' prescribe her a new one. They c'n screw up yer blood pressure, some worse 'n others.\" She returned Gracie's chart, and held out her hand. \"Name's Allyssa.\" Eric took her hand, and her grip almost snapped his fingers. \"Jamie's got the ni' shift, she's got some ski race today. I work the other half a' the floor.\" She smiled, exposing more missing teeth. \"I play 'ockey. Defense. Of all the nurses in San Antonio Memorial, they stick the two nurses who play obscure sports together. I'm gonna go get Doc an' get 'im to change the prescription. If she ain' back in ten minu'es, holler.\" She ran out, leaving Eric feeling very alone. He took Gracie's hand and gave it a tight squeeze. \"Matthews?\" He'd completely forgotten that McDonald was in the room. \"Yes sir?\" \"I don't care what you guys do outside the office, but keep it there. No funny shit during work. Got it?\" \"Yes sir.\" \"But I think you two make a nice team on ops. Keep it that way.\" \"Thank you, sir.\" Eric grinned. McDonald put a hand on Eric's shoulder. \"I gotta get back to the city. You're here on assigned protection until she's back on duty. Keep me posted.\" \"I will sir.\" McDonald gave him a smile, and left the room. Eric squeezed Gracie's hand, then kissed her warm forehead. He nestled himself right next to her on the bed, her head by his shoulder. He slid his arm behind her neck, and felt it twitch. Her head turned away from him, then she gave a slight groan. \"Gracie?\" He asked. She turned towards him, blinking. \"Eric?\" She whispered, \"What happened?\" \"You fainted. Allyssa said it was the painkiller.\" \"Allyssa?\" \"Jamie's got a ski race.\" She nodded, then glanced around the room. \"Where's McDonald?\" \"He just needed my report.\" She nestled her head into his chest. \"What did he say about…us?\" \"What about us?\" \"You know…\" \"I know?\" \"Eric…\" She rolled her eyes and groaned at him. \"Gracie…\" He did the same, grinning. \"Fine,\" he sighed. \"Mcdonald said that he didn't care what we did, as long as we kept it out of the office.\" \"Oh.\" \"But he thinks we make a nice team.\" She grinned at him. He sighed, and put his other hand to her warm cheek. \"So, is there an…us?\" \"McDonald thinks so. Besides, you haven't spent the last week here for the money…right?\" \"Well, once Vic was done with you, you weren't half bad.\" she gave him a sly smile. \"You think I'm gorgeous, you want to hug me... You want to love me... You want to kiss me…\" He did. Their lips met, and for a while, neither of them were in the hospital.[Chapter 9] SpiritoftheBlackRose : this ending's not too bad either... no drama, just pillow talk. Second Daughter of Eve : Thank you! a laska1588 : Yeah, actually. I've got the rest mostly-ish drafted out, and I hope to have it done rather soon. Hey y'all! Contrary to popular belief- I am infact alive and well, just had a rough breakup of my man of almost 4 years and some other crap over the summer, so everything just got delayed. THIS STORY WILL BE COMPLETED! Thanks to everyone for hanging in there, I promise that there will not be another wait as long as this one. Enjoy! Wildthing. Eric rolled over in bed. He liked the feel of his new queen size mattress, and felt as if the final ache had been worked from his back. He glanced over to see his live-in protectee/girlfriend still dozing. Two months since she'd reluctantly agreed to go on the mission, her exasperated \"Do I have to wear the dress?\" and then the whirlwind of the pageant and the explosion that brought them together. Two months ago he slept in his college full size mattress, and sharing it was the last thing on his mind. He sighed, and felt Gracie's leg twitch. He looked and saw her slowly open her eyes. \"Eric? You okay?\" The scars from the tiara made her face looked well freckeld, and unfortunately, were not going to fade much more. \"Yeah, I'm just thinking.\" \"About what?\" She sat up on one elbow. Eric smiled. \"You.\" She snorted and gave him a kiss. \"What about? The fact that we've been together for two months without trying to kill each other or maybe that I've been able to get past guns and knives for years, but give me a tiara and it almost kills me?\" \"Naw, just how great you looked in that dress.\" She whacked the back of his head and turned back over. He wrapped his arms around her, more comfortable than he'd been, well, ever. He loved his job, sure, but just being able to wrap his arms around her made him almost regret having to leave. \"I love you.\" She murmured. He sat up enough to kiss her earlobe, then settled his head back on the pillow. \"Love you too, Gracie Lou.\" She rolled over to face him. \"You know I hate it when you do that stupid rhyming thing, right?\" He pecked her lips, making her smile. \"Yep.\" She rolled her eyes, and kissed his cheek. He pulled her on top of him, where could feel her inhale and exhale. She wrapped her bandaged arms around him and pressed her lips to his forehead. His lips went for her neck. They stayed that way for a while, until she finally stopped to settle her head into his neck. He gave her another squeeze. \"Eric?\" Her voice was welcome in the darkness. \"Yeah?\" He sighed. \"Did you love me before I got al Vic-ed up and pretty?\" He kissed the top of her head. \"Yeah, I did. It just took a tiara and a hairbrush to prove it.\" She gave him a quizzical stare. He kissed her again. \"Why? You thinking of going back and looking all ugly again?\" \"Not really. I actually kinda liked looking pretty.\" \"I really liked it.\" Another whack on the head. He winced, and she wrapped her arms back around him, nestling her head in his chest. \"When are you going back to regular duty?\" Her voice was muffled against his chest. \"Next week.\" \"I'm gonna hate it, y'know.\" \"What? You'll get to look for bombs from behind a desk while I'm out getting shot at.\" \"But you at least get to shoot back.\" \"Yeah,\" He kissed her head. \"But personally, I'd rather mail a bomb.\" She grinned at him, and pressed her lips against his, then rolled off of him. \"Hey-\" He grabbed her and gave her a tight squeeze. \"Good night , Eric.\" \"Love you too.\"[Chapter 10] Andy-Ander: Thank you for the support! star jelly: Violence is great in moderate doses, isn't it? :F Another eon's wait for an update.

Four months out of the hospital, and she was still limited to semi-solid foods after her stomach surgery. It wasn't like she wasn't happy to be alive. She was just getting sick of scrambled eggs or runny oatmeal every morning. A dribble of egg dropped on top the blueprint she was working on, and she cussed to herself and wiped it away with her fingers. Her desk was semi-neat, yet cluttered (she had a system ) with mounds of paper, her computer and a few framed photographs of her and Eric. Despite her hatred of deskwork, the daily sight of her boyfriend made the day somewhat bearable. \"So I told her I knew kung-fu,\" Jensen was sill re-hashing his late night phone call. \"You think I could get away with that, Harte?\" \"Only if by 'kung fu' you mean the Chinese place in Brooklyn.\" She told him, then took another bite of eggs. Jensen's ears reddened. \"Yeah, well, you could show me a few moves. Unless you're too busy with Eric… maybe I could get a tape of you two.\" His voice trailed off. \"Whaddya say?\" Gracie rolled her eyes. \"How about you get back to work, Jensen?\" Eric made his way around the corner, and Gracie gave the already startled Jensen a glare. \"Yeah, sure, I've got- photocopier.\" He made his way towards his office. Gracie sat back on her chair and sighed. \"How was your briefing?\" Eric's gaze fell to the floor. \"I got a new op.\" \"Why the long face? It's not a beauty pageant or anything, right? I mean, if you want another chance to see Macdonald in his underwear…\" Her giggle broke into a snort that made Eric smile. \"I wish. It's a 2-man undercover in the Catskills. Drug trade covered by hunters.\" He was still withdrawn; unsure of taking the assignment. She knew he was worried about leaving her. \"That's 4 hours away Eric. It's not Texas. I'll be fine.\" \"Macdonald wants me on the road in two. I just-\" She stood to meet his eyes, and his arms went around her waist, one of the few times either of them had broken their unspoken anti- FBI-PDA agreement. \"I can't leave you. Not yet.\" \"I'll be fine. The doctor said I had eighty-five percent back in my hands and it's not that hard to make scrambled eggs.\" \"I know. And I know you're gonna be fine. It's just, this is the first time I've ever worried about this stuff. You'll be fine without me. I just don't know how I'm gonna do out there without you .\" \"Break that drug ring faster.\" He smiled. \"I figure that's my best option. I've got some maps for you to look over before I go.\" He was slowly pulling her towards a janitor's closet. \"Okay, I'll get on that…\" \"I'll just need some good luck from you, too.\" He slowly opened the closet door with a smile. She caught on in an instant, and she pulled him inside, planting her lips to his before the door clicked shut.

Summary: Follows the movie Twister, with Bill Harding's cousin Elizabeth Harding. She gets along with everybody in the group. When it comes to playing nice with Robert 'Rabbit' Nurick she can't do it, and vice versa. Maybe that will change later… \"At 7:00 a.m. in Oklahoma City, the temperature is 75 degrees across the state, skies are partly cloudy, the dryline higher over western Oklahoma. Satellite pictures indicate thunderstorms developing.\" A group of storm chasers led by Jo Harding has set up shop off a dirt road. Everybody had jobs to do. Dusty was keeping an eye on the weather screens. Beltzer was trying to help Jo wire up the Doppler Radar. Haynes and Sanders were keeping an eye out on the horizon for anything that might form into a twister. Joey and Preacher were wiring up another Doppler with little to no success. Rabbit, and Laurence were hanging out near the weather van. The only one not really doing anything was the chasers field medic Elizabeth Harding. \"You know El, you could do something instead of sitting around!\" Rabbit shouted pointedly at the black haired woman who glared at him. \"Unless you get a splinter, or break your neck there's no use for a medic! For your information I'm collecting soil samples from different places that had twisters set down, AND comparing the readouts! Now fold your maps you Waskily Wabbit!\" Elizabeth snapped back at him making Dusty snicker in laughter from his spot. \"Dude you are 'so' not collecting soil…\" Dusty teased her and she smirked back at him. \"All these years, and that's all you got Harding?!\" Rabbit fired back at her and she grinned at him making him roll his eyes. Jo Harding shook her head watching this all from on top of the van. \"Okay professor, hang on there, I think I fixed it. I've got it.\" Beltzer shouted and Jo turned it on making it spark. Beltzer winced slightly. \"Whoops.\" \"This thing is useless! \" Jo screamed angrily at the machine. \"Sorry, Jo.\" Beltzer muttered not noticing the machine was now miraculously working and Jo hollered at him. \"Wait, wait, wait. Beltzer! That's good. Give me a reading!\" Jo hollered and Beltzer sighed before he got out of the van to help her. \"Okay , boss lady, hold your horses. Which way do you want it, Jo?\" Beltzer asked and Jo thought about the answer. \"Looks like the dryline has stalled. Give me a sector scan west, northwest, look at mid-levels for rotation and increase the PRF.\" Jo and Beltzer cringed hearing Dusty from inside his weather van blasting rock music through the speaker on his roof. Jo quirked an eyebrow at the other scene playing out near the other weather van. She smirked and huffed in laughter watching their antics. \"All I'm saying is don't fold the maps!\" Rabbit shouted at Laurence who rolled his eyes. \"I didn't fold the map!\" Laurence argued with him. \"Yeah, well Kansas is a mess, there's a big crease right through Wichita! Roll the maps!\" Rabbit rolled the map up and put a rubber band around it to secure it. \"Well hello, boys…didn't like my map folding skills?\" Elizabeth asked coyly and Rabbit stared at her confused at first, but then he got what she said and his face darkened. \"Who said, you could touch my maps?\" Rabbit asked tensely and Elizabeth grinned at him innocently. \"So you didn't like my new Kansas state lines?\" Elizabeth asked and Rabbit swung the rolled up map at her but she ducked and ran away with a cackle of evil laughter. Rabbit chased after her fully intent on either beating her to death with the map, or just give up. Beltzer noticed Jo was watching something and he followed her gaze and he snorted in laughter watching the show. Evidently Rabbit was protective of his maps and while Elizabeth was faster he was pissed off. Rabbit threw the rolled up map at her fleeing back and she fell forward. Everybody watched now because she was holding her leg in pain and Rabbit paled worriedly and rushed to her side. \"Jeez El…I'm sorry I wasn't thinking…\" Rabbit tried to check her for injuries when she sprang up and grabbed him in a headlock. Rabbit spent three minutes trying to shake her off until she gave him a sloppy kiss on the cheek making him shriek in disgust. She let him go and he just looked at her with reddening cheeks. \"You are so weird…\" He shook his head at her. \"Runs in the family…\" \"I've noticed.\" Rabbit walked away only to have Elizabeth jump on his back screaming 'hi ho silver away!' Beltzer was laughing now and he looked over at Jo who was smiling at the two of them. \"You think they'll ever figure out that they've been pulling the other's pigtails since they first met?\" He asked Jo curiously and she huffed in laughter. \"I doubt it.\"[Chapter 2] A red truck showed up and a guy got out of the drivers seat while a woman got out of the passenger seat. They approached the wayward storm chasers who automatically took notice of the two of them. \"What do you know, the storm chasers.\" The man grinned at the group that charged towards him happily. \"Hey, I don't believe it! Who is that handsome devil!?\" Rabbit asked before he was hip checked out of the way by Elizabeth. \"BILLY!\" She shouted and pounced on him with a hug. \"Really Beth?\" Rabbit asked glaring at her and she flipped him off still hugging her cousin. \"Don't call me that or else I'm making Wabbit Stew tonight.\" She warned the man and Bill laughed. \"You two still in the denial phase of the relationship?\" Bill asked getting confused looks from them both. \"The Extreme! IT'S THE EXTREME!\" Dusty shouted finally seeing who was there. He tore Elizabeth off of her cousin and shoved her towards Rabbit who caught her awkwardly before she fell over. \"DAMMIT DUSTY!\" She snapped at the goofy man who just shrugged back at her. \"The Extreme has graced us with his presence!\" Dusty grinned back at Bill who laughed embarrassedly. \"Oh man, don't start that shit!\" The two friends shook hands. \"Oh manly hand shakin' Zeus. How you doin', man?\" Dusty asked with his usual air of energy. \"Doin' great, doin' great.\" Bill nodded while answering. \"Oh bad!\" Dusty grinned impishly. \"So are you the wife?\" The unknown female asked Elizabeth who burst into hysterical laughter. \"Please don't mean Bill…\" Elizabeth muttered still giggling. \"Elizabeth Harding, and while it's legal in some states for cousins to get married…Billy has a tendency to snore spit when he sleeps.\" \"Oh God…this is embarrassing…\" The woman blushed awkwardly and Bill glared at Elizabeth. \"Dusty, 'Beth' I'd like you to meet Melissa. Melissa, this is Dusty, and you've met 'Beth'. Dustman's been chasing with us ever since we started. Listen man, where's Jo?\" Bill asked not needing to see El's infuriated look. \"She's over by Doppler. Broke down again, running out of grant money.\" Dusty nodded towards the machine that Jo Harding was working on. He was also hiding the fact that he had a firm grip on Elizabeth's arm so she didn't kill her cousin. \"Honey, why don't you hang out here for a little while, I'll- I'll be right back.\" Bill stuttered when he saw the angry shade of red on his cousin's cheeks and figured on a hasty retreat. \"Okay.\" Melissa nodded looking concernedly at Elizabeth's reaction. \"Dusty, why don't you explain to Melissa...why you are the way you are!?\" Bill asked with a smart ass grin while Dusty shot him one right back. \"Come on. Man. Jo's gonna wig when she sees he's back.\" Dusty pulled Melissa and Elizabeth with him. \"I'm not back!\" Bill shouted back at him and Dusty just ignored him. \"So tell me more about yourself Melissa?\" Elizabeth asked while getting her a bottle of water. \"Not much to say really…\" \"Do you two work together at his 'weather studio'?\" Elizabeth asked again and Melissa huffed in laughter. \"No, I'm just a relationship therapist.\" \"Sweet.\" Elizabeth nodded. \"A fellow medical person.\" \"Are you in the medical field?\" Melissa asked while Dusty was trying to explain twisters to her. \"Nah, not really. Just a CMA. \"That's still impressive.\" Melissa offered politely but Elizabeth smiled sheepishly. \"It's okay you can say it: Glorified Nurse.\" She admitted making Melissa smile embarrassedly at her until Dusty said something about the 'suck zone'. \"Wait what?\" Melissa suddenly asked Dusty not sure she heard correctly and Elizabeth started laughing again. \"I guess I'll leave you two to discuss the suck zones!\" Elizabeth offered making a break for it. Rabbit was leaning against one of the vans when Elizabeth stood beside him. \"You left her with Dusty.\" He mentioned casually he looked down and noticed the evil grin on her face. \"You are evil.\" He stated simply and this time the grin morphed into her 'trademark' grin. Her top lip went up over her teeth, while she bit her bottom lip. Rabbit shook his head and laughed nervously. Didn't mean anything that he knew which of her facial expressions meant what. Right?[Chapter 3] Elizabeth frowned worriedly seeing Bill and Jo bickering nearby. Then Jo looked over at Melissa and started heading towards her. \"Oh this can't end well…\" Elizabeth muttered darkly and Rabbit looked at her then followed her line of sight and cringed. \"Ouch…\" He muttered in agreement. \"I should go save the poor thing, I mean first I leave her with Dusty…then Jo sets her sights on her.\" Elizabeth hurried over to where Jo had already met up with Melissa. Joey came to stand beside Rabbit and nodded to himself. \"You should just ask her out already.\" He mentioned and Rabbit's eyes widened and he gaped at the man beside him. \"We hate each other's guts!\" Rabbit snapped at him and Joey shrugged. \"Maybe it's not hatred? My family would call it foreplay.\" He admitted and Rabbit just stared at him. Melissa had waited until Elizabeth left to ask Dusty her own questions. \"Why does she not like being called Beth?\" Melissa asked and Dusty's permanent grin kind of dimmed. \"Ex-boyfriend had a habit of calling her that.\" \"I'm sorry, was he abusive?\" Melissa asked quietly and Dusty shook his head. \"Nah, she gave him as much as he gave her. It was more volatile than her and Rabbit's relationship.\" \"They didn't seem very close.\" Melissa mentioned and Dusty smirked now. \"That's because everybody but them knows they fight like an old married couple.\" Dusty cleared his throat. \"So anyway, the suck zone- it's the point- basically at which the twister sucks you up, but it's not that technical therefore obviously, but…\" Dusty went on to explain the suck zone further when Jo interrupted them. \"Hi. I'm Jo Harding.\" Jo greeted Melissa who took any excuse to get away from Dusty and his tornado talk. Melissa stood up eager for the distraction and noticed that Elizabeth had now joined their group. \"Oh, hello, nice to meet you.\" Melissa shook Jo's hand and Elizabeth cringed seeing the female pissing match about to start up. \"Bill just told me the happy news.\" Jo admitted with a fake smile and even Elizabeth looked confused. \"Which?\" Melissa asked and Jo smiled sarcastically at her. \"Us, marriage. Jo, Melissa.\" Bill informed Melissa and saw the expression his cousin shot him and he shrugged. \"It's happy news.\" Jo offered overly politely and Elizabeth tried to hide her grin. \"I guess, uh, it probably seems kind of sudden.\" Melissa started awkwardly and Jo noticed she was nervous. \"Seems sudden?\" Jo asked looking like she was about to just punch Melissa out and Elizabeth shook her head at her worriedly. \"Dude, you takin' the vows? That's sweet!\" Dusty smiled taking the attention off of the battle of the exes. \"Well, we- we just wanted to get it done before Billy started his new job.\" Melissa was starting to feel like she was caught in between a firing squad. \"That's right, that's right, right, right, right. Weatherman!\" Jo offered sarcastically and Elizabeth sighed. \"Jo…\"/\"What?\" Elizabeth's voice was warning, but Bill's voice sounded indignant. Jo decided to listen only to Bill's comment. \"What?\" Jo looked innocently at Bill who glowered at her. \"Say it!\" He challenged her. \"I said weatherman, I think it's great.\" Jo tried to cover her ass while Elizabeth threw her arms up in defeat. \"I quit…\" Elizabeth muttered darkly and walked over to Sanders who was on the phone with the weather company. She could still hear the two of them, and they were getting louder. \"God, make them stop.\" She whined in despair and Sanders gave her a wry grin. \"Too much to ask?\" \"How come you had that tone?!\" Bill asked tersely. \"There was no tone if you have a problem being a weatherman.\" Jo shot back at him. \"I don't have a problem being a weatherman!\" Bill snapped at her. Elizabeth groaned and went inside Rabbit's van and slumped against the wall. Minutes later Rabbit came in and sat across from her. \"So like old times huh?\" He asked cautiously. She covered her ears trying to block out the fighting outside. \"As usual, stay as long as you'd like.\" He mentioned and walked over sitting in the driver's seat. \"Thanks Rob.\" She admitted quietly and Rabbit smirked over at her silently. \"Any time Lizzie.\" Rabbit looked outside from the windshield. \"Just don't touch the maps back there.\" \"I promise nothing.\" She muttered darkly and Rabbit smirked out the window.[Chapter 4] Minutes later Rabbit sighed in relief. \"Oh look at that, they stopped fighting.\" He mentioned and Elizabeth looked up and then stood up coming to stand beside him. \"Hehehe, she just roped him in with Dorothy.\" Elizabeth chuckled slightly as they watched Jo showing Bill the machine that the crew had built. Elizabeth and Rabbit got out of his van and approached the now calm group while Dusty brought Melissa over to Dorothy. \"How sweet is that? Bill's concept man. Boom! The extreme. Man, it came from his brain.\" Dusty gushed making Elizabeth cringe at the man's grammar or lack thereof. \"I had a hand in it.\" Bill shook his head. \"Wow, it is great. What is it?\" Melissa asked and Elizabeth smiled at her. \"It's an instrument for studying tornadoes.\" Elizabeth offered but sighed now seeing how lost the poor woman was. \"First one in history.\" Bill smirked at the massive machine and Jo grinned now. \"It's very exciting. Scientists have been studying tornadoes for ever, but still, nobody knows how a tornado works. We have no idea what's going on inside because no one's ever been able to take scientific measurements from inside the funnel. That's what she's gonna do.\" Jo started to explain to Melissa who looked like she was trying really hard to grasp the concept. \"How?\" Melissa asked wanting to know more. \"We put her up inside a tornado. She opens up, and releases hundreds of these sensors that measure all parts of the tornado simultaneously.\" Jo showed her one of the sensors. \"You see, Melissa, it's like this. These sensors go up the funnel, and radio back information about the internal structure, wind velocities, flow, asymmetry. We could learn more in 30 seconds than we have in the past 30 years. Get a profile of a tornado for the first time.\" Bill ended the explanation. \"And what will that do?\" Melissa asked once more. \"If we knew how a tornado really worked, we could design an advance warning system.\" Bill shrugged. \"Aren't there already tornado warnings?\" Melissa asked curiously. \"They aren't good enough, with some luck and hope this baby will let people know something's coming with enough time to get to safety.\" Elizabeth explained and Melissa nodded understanding how it could be helpful. \"I can't believe you actually did it.\" Bill shook his head in awe at the machine still. \"Well, we did it.\" Jo motioned to everybody else. \"How do you get it in the tornado?\" Melissa asked worriedly. \"Well, you got to get in front of the tornado and put it in the damage path. And then get out again before it picks you up too.\" Bill explained as Dusty snuck up behind Melissa. \"It's the suck zone!\" Dusty started the woman and Elizabeth rolled her eyes. \"DUSTIN DAVIS!\" Elizabeth warned him sternly making Sanders and Joey 'oh'. \"Dude you just got the whole name!\" Sanders cackled and Dusty pouted looking at the ground. \"Jo, we got major action! The NSSL says the caps are breaking, the tower's going up to 30 miles up the dryline!\" Haynes shouted from the phone she just hung up. Jo slammed the trucks tailgate closed. \"All right, let's go!\" Jo ordered everybody to pack up and get moving. \"All right, we're movin'!\" Dusty started to pack his crap up. \"It's fatty time!\" Beltzer shouted getting his gear ready and Elizabeth scoffed in disgust at him. \"What?\" He shrugged at her and she rolled her eyes and headed to find her med-kit. \"Hey has anybody seen my med-kid?!\" Elizabeth shouted worriedly. \"Jo, we got it!\" Haynes ducked past Elizabeth who was trying to search for her medical gear. \"Rabbit, you're up. Let's go, let's go. Hurry up, we haven't got all day, let's go! Joey, Haynes, a little help?\" Beltzer shouted at everybody he could and Elizabeth rushed past him to look for her med-kit. \"Dammit El get moving!\" \"I have to find my damn kit!\" She shouted and Sanders hollered over to her. \"EL THE KIT'S OVER HERE!\" He answered and she rushed over and glared at him. \"You were using it as a footrest?!\" She shouted angrily and he rolled his eyes and shoved it into her hands. She did a quick check of the items inside the kit and frowned. \"Did you take the stitching gear out?\" She asked Sanders who groaned. \"No…that I cannot help you with. No clue where they are!\" He brushed past her still getting his crap together. Elizabeth ignored Joey and Haynes snapping fingers at one another. \"WHERE THE FUCK IS MY STITCHING GEAR?!\" Elizabeth shouted getting fed up. \"Common' Dusty, you're always the last one to go!\" Rabbit shouted at the other man who was haphazardly tossing crap back into his bus. Rabbit then noticed Elizabeth looked like she was about to have an aneurism and sighed. \"EL!\" He shouted and she spun around to look at him. \"The stitching gear is still in my van!\" Elizabeth looked confused. \"When you had to tend to the cut that Haynes got a week ago!\" Elizabeth bit her lip embarrassedly and nodded remembering suddenly where she left it. She rushed it Rabbit's van and grabbed the stitching gear and shoved it into the med-kit. She was leaving the van when Rabbit smirked. \"What?!\" She asked indignantly. \"The last two to mobilize is either Dusty or me…\" Rabbit had a smug grin now and Elizabeth groaned in horror. \"Choose wisely…\" He snickered and she looked back at Dusty still shoving things into his bus. \"You could've made the choice harder you know?\" She asked grumpily and shoved past him and reentered the van making him chuckle again. Suddenly Melissa and Bill rushed past Rabbit and got into his truck in a hurry. \"HEY BILL! GLAD YOU'RE BACK!\" Rabbit shouted. \"I'M NOT BACK!\" Bill shouted back and hurried to start his truck and keep steady pace with the rest of them.[Chapter 5] Rabbit was driving the van while he actually let Elizabeth look at the maps ready to show him when he needed to see them. It was a lot easier to have somebody else hold the maps while you drove. \"Rabbit!\" Jo called through the radio and Elizabeth handed him the CB Radio. \"Yeah, boss?\" Rabbit asked. \"Can we do better than the 30?\" She asked and Elizabeth held the map up so Rabbit could see if he could find them a better route and he sighed. \"No. Not for a while. It's best to stay on it until we pass Rogers creek.\" \"Copy that.\" Jo answered with a sigh and Rabbit smirked at Elizabeth. \"You know…you're really good at holding maps.\" He admitted and Elizabeth looked at him warily. \"Can't fold worth shit though.\" \"Stop it, before I call Wabbit Season.\" She warned him humorlessly. \"Call it as I see it.\" Rabbit shrugged then he looked at his car mirror and groaned. \"Shit…\" He sighed and looked at Elizabeth. \"Not to ruin your cheerful mood….\" Rabbit started and Elizabeth quirked an eyebrow at him worriedly. \"Your douche Ex is coming up alongside us…\" Elizabeth heard this and her face fell into a murderous scowl. \"This day just keeps getting better.\" She groaned in despair as her ex-boyfriend Jonas Miller drove past and Jonas gave her a smug wink and she looked like she was about to kill him with mind control alone. Jonas made a sarcastic kiss face to her and she flipped him off. \"Ugh, what did I ever see in him?!\" She grumbled darkly. \"Probably just sex.\" Rabbit grumbled only slightly bitterly. \"Nah, it wasn't 'that' good.\" She remarked making Rabbit laugh hysterically as he tried to not wreck the van. \"Jo, I think we got fleas!\" Beltzer mentioned over the radio as he too noticed Jonas' crew. \"Jo, come back!\" Bill came over the radio and he sounded perplexed. \"Hey there, you change your mind?\" Jo asked with a smirk. \"Yeah, what's Jonas doin' here?\" Bill asked curiously. \"I'm not sure. But I bet he's asking himself the same question about you.\" Jo answered amusedly and Elizabeth snorted in laughter. One of the cars in Jonas' crew swerved towards Bill's truck making him go off of the road getting a flat tire. Elizabeth glared at the other group and grabbed Rabbit's radio. \"That was a cheap shot Jon.\" She growled through the radio. \"Well howdy Beth!\" Jonas answered her with a smug grin to his voice. Rabbit saw her jaw tense, her eye twitched, and her hand gripped the radio until her knuckles were white. \"Hey…\" He started quietly and she looked at him. \"Calm down.\" Elizabeth took in a deep breath and got on the radio again. \"Be quiet Jonas, I have nothing to say to you.\" She admitted quietly. \"You're the one who left Princess.\" Jonas announced cooly over the radio and Elizabeth's temper came back out. \"YOU WERE THE ONE WHO CHEATED ON ME!\" She shouted through the radio. \"Eye for an eye.\" Jonas came back over indifferently. \"Oh god, not this again.\" Elizabeth muttered to herself before she got back on the radio. \"You asshole, I never cheated on you!\" \"Oh so you've 'never' decided to sleep with…\" Elizabeth cut Jonas' comments off by turning the radio off with an angry huff, but her cheeks were blood red. \"What was that about?\" Rabbit asked curiously and Elizabeth scoffed. \"Nothing…just forget it.\" Elizabeth looked down feeling tears fill her eyes. \"I'll let you fold the maps…\" Rabbit quietly mentioned making her laugh through the tears and she wiped them away.[Chapter 6] Bill was getting his tire fixed while Elizabeth talked to Eddie and Tony from Jonas' team. \"Hey Ellie!\" Tony greeted her with a hug and kiss on the cheek. \"Hi Ella.\" Eddie nodded to her with a smirk. \"You sure had him spitting nails in the car when you cut him off.\" Eddie was grinning now. \"Good to see you boys to. How are those kids of yours Ed?\" Elizabeth asked Eddie who took out his wallet. \"See for yourself!\" He grinned and showed her the photo of his daughter and son. \"Got another one on the way in about four months!\" \"Jeez those two are sure getting big fast. And another one? Damn man, you sure don't waste time…\" Eddie and Tony paled slightly and Elizabeth groaned in defeat already knowing why they were looking behind her like that. \"And hello Jonas.\" She turned around sarcastically. \"Beautiful as always Beth.\" Jonas muttered snidely. \"Couldn't help but notice which vehicle you were riding in.\" \"Yes it was either his van, or Dusty's bus. You would've made the same decision.\" \"Still infatuated with the March Hare I see.\" Jonas ignored her explanation. \"There was nothing going on between me and Rabbit then, and there sure as HELL isn't anything going on now!\" She growled warningly so nobody could hear her but Jonas. \"Should I just tell everyone whose name was on your lips?\" Jonas whispered harshly into her ear. \"You were so terrible in bed, I had to think up different guys because I knew I wasn't getting anything in return.\" Elizabeth taunted him slightly and Jonas glared at her. \"We have a news crew coming soon to interview me and my team…make a hasty retreat why don't you?\" Jonas growled angrily at her and she rolled her eyes. \"Sure thing Jon. See you guys later.\" Elizabeth nodded to Tony and Eddie and walked away. \"Asshole…\" Elizabeth was sitting on a swing that was put up near the auto station and she watched everybody milling around while a news crew set up near Jonas. \"So…\" Haynes sat on the other swing beside her. \"I don't want to hear it.\" Elizabeth warned her friend. \"I know how much it hurt El.\" Haynes offered quietly. \"You loved him, and then he does that.\" \"I'm not sure that I ever loved him, that was the weird part.\" Elizabeth watched Jonas. \"I probably shouldn't tell you this: But when the boys found out what happened…\" Haynes looked over at some of the main guys from their group. \"They went postal and beat the shit outta Jonas.\" \"WHAT?!\" Elizabeth's eyes went wide. \"Only two of them managed to hurt him. The other two got into it with Dean and Tony.\" \"And I'm 'just' finding this out?!\" Elizabeth asked in horror. She frowned worriedly. \"Who was it?\" \"Beltzer got a black eye from Dean, Dusty received a split lip from Tony, Rabbit got a bruised rib when Jonas elbowed him and Bill, let's just say those two aren't friends anymore.\" \"Jesus, this is all my fault.\" Elizabeth bemoaned to herself. \"Beltz, said that Jonas shouted that you cheated first. Wasn't true was it?\" Haynes asked quietly and Elizabeth started to cry and shook her head. \"No it wasn't.\" \"Beltz said he'd never seen Rob so angry before. So I guess Jonas picked up on who was the most angry out of the group and put two and two together. Something tells me he wasn't half off though.\" Haynes admitted slyly and Elizabeth glared at her. \"You're going to have to face the truth at some point: You are in love with Robert Nurick.\" \"I'll face that truth, the day you face the truth that you're in love with Tim Beltzer!\" Elizabeth shot back at her and Haynes blushed. \"Touche…\" Haynes nodded in defeat and the two women sat on the swings together.[Chapter 7] Elizabeth eventually made her way towards Jo's truck and sat in the cabin trying to calm down. She noticed that Jonas pulled out his DOT 3 machine and she cringed when she noticed Bill had seen it also. Bill was now trying to kill Jonas for stealing their design. She shook her head and went back to reading a magazine she found. \"Not even getting in the middle of that…\" She grumbled to herself. \"You stole my design, you son of a bitch! What you think, I wasn't gonna find out about this?!\" Bill shouted angrily as he tried to pummel Jonas. \"Hey, guys, can you get this loser off me?!\" Jonas shouted to everybody and both groups tried to pry Bill off of him. \"Back off! Back off! It's not worth it!\" Dusty tried to push Bill back. \"What is the matter with you?\" Jonas shouted at Bill. \"You stole my design, you son of a bitch!\" Bill shouted angrily but Rabbit tried to intercept. \"Bill, calm down!\" Rabbit urged his friend and Jonas rolled his eyes. \"Would the March Hare kindly get the hell out of the way so I can find out what the hell the Mad Hatter is talking about?!\" Jonas shouted angrily and Rabbit glowered at the man. \"Rabbit…\" Bill started and his friend look over at him. \" 'Duck' Season.\" Bill offered and Rabbit nodded and ducked out of the way as Bill lobbed his fist at Jonas clipping him in the eye. \"JESUS!\" Jonas held his face in pain. \"Dorothy! You took her, you damn thief!\" Bill shouted angrily and Jonas now appeared smug even though his face was hurting. \"Oh I get it. You want to take credit for my design. Is that it?\" Jonas asked and Bill shook his head. \"You're a liar. She was our idea and you know it!\" Bill spat angrily and Jonas smirked again. \"Unrealized idea, unrealized.\" Jonas snapped back smug once more. \"That ain't worth shit!\" Bill shouted venomously. \"Guys, guys. All my guys, get a grip on yourselves. We both know he'll never get that thing up in the air.\" Jo snapped at her guys then she looked smugly at Jonas. \"That's right!\" Beltzer nodded trying to get Bill to calm down. \"Well let me enlighten you people! This baby has satellite comlink. We've got on-board pulse Doppler, we've got NEXRAD real time. Today, we're gonna make history. So stick around. Cuz' the days of sniffin' the dirt are over.\" Jonas still explained and Rabbit glared at him this time. \"Better than what you sniff.\" Rabbit snapped \"We'll see who gets their first, pal.\" Bill snarled while being led away. Oh, and by the way, I really enjoy your weather reports!\" Jonas taunted Bill again and Bill tried to dive past Dusty and Beltzer to get back to him. \"You slime! I ain't through with you yet! Come on! Come here! Come on! Come on! Get your hands off me! I'm all right! Okay!\" \"He's a corporate kiss-butt, man!\" Joey offered quietly and Jo looked at Bill sadly. \"I'm sorry. I should have told you.\" Jo admitted referring to the fact that she knew that Jonas had stolen the design. \"One day. I'll give you one day. Whether she flies or not I'm gone.\" Bill warned Jo who nodded. \"Honey, is everything okay?\" Melissa asked worriedly. \"It's okay, everything's fine.\" Bill tried to calm her nerves. \"Are you sure?\" Melissa tried again. \"Yeah, yeah, yeah, everything's okay.\" Bill nodded. \"Okay.\" Melissa didn't look convinced but let it go for now. \"Listen, I'm gonna hang out here and get some air. Why don't you get us some cold drinks.\" Bill nodded towards the snack place. \"Okay, sweetheart.\" Melissa nodded and the whole scene dissipated. Elizabeth looked up from the magazine she was reading and saw the fight was over, so she kept reading the magazine. \"Hey, man. What's up?\" Dusty asked Bill when he saw Bill sifting some dirt through his hand. \"Goin' green.\" Bill mentioned and Dusty smiled. \"Greenage.\" Dusty perked up excitedly. \"Saddle 'em up.\" Bill ordered Dusty who nodded happily. \"You got it, boss!\" Dusty started to round up the crew. \"Honey, I got you a lemonade…\" Melissa mentioned to Bill who interrupted her. \"We gotta move out. Listen, follow us in the truck, but stay behind Dusty's van, you'll be safe back there. I gotta go with Jo. Okay, let's move out, people! Let's go!\" Bill mentioned and headed over to Jo's truck. \"Where are we goin'?\" Melissa asked but nobody listened to her and everybody started to grab their gear up and head out. Bill grabbed Jo's truck keys from her mouth. \"Thanks, I'll drive.\" Bill mentioned and took the drivers side startling Elizabeth who was still reading. \"What's up?\" Elizabeth asked worriedly when Bill sat beside her. She looked over when the passenger side door opened and Jo got in the other side of her and her face paled. \"Oh shit…just let me get out and head to another vehicle…\" \"Too late, everybody's mobilized.\" Bill shook his head and started the truck. \"I so did 'not' want to be stuck with you two in a small enclosed space.\" Elizabeth grumbled darkly. The caravan was now in action and the three of them could hear from the others radios. Dusty was singing off key once more to his loud rock music, Haynes and Beltzer were singing to Oklahoma as loud as they could, and Preacher was listening to the William Tell Overture. \"So…\" Jo started and Bill glanced over. \"So…\" Bill answered her and Elizabeth rolled her eyes. \"Oh this isn't awkward at all…\" She grumbled sarcastically because she was sitting between them. Jo smirked at her while Bill rolled his eyes this time. \"Amazing coloring there, isn't it?\" Jo asked and Bill nodded. \"Yeah, look at those mammatas. Bet those tops have got to be spiking at about 40,000.\" Bill looked out at the clouds. \"That's a good thing.\" Jo nodded Elizabeth saw the look on her friend's face and hid a groan of despair knowing she was about to delve into talking about Melissa. \"That's a very good thing.\" Bill mentioned agreeing with her. \"She work at the station, is that where you met her?\" Jo asked and Elizabeth closed her eyes in defeat. \"Jo.\" Bill warned her and Jo looked over at him curiously. \"What?\" Jo asked confused. \"I don't want to fight.\" Bill tried again and Jo scoffed. \"I'm not fighting, I'm talking.\" Jo explained to him and Elizabeth let out a whine. \"I don't want to fight.\" Bill ended the argument and Elizabeth knew it was going to happen in just a few seconds. \"She's nice.\" Jo stated simply and Bill looked at her in triumph. \"HAH!\" He shouted and Elizabeth looked longingly at the door wondering if she could dive past Jo to get out. \"Uh-oh, she's not nice?\" Jo asked smirking at Bill. \"Please guys, not while I'm stuck between you with no where to run…\" Elizabeth complained darkly. \"I know what you meant!\" Bill taunted Jo and Elizabeth slumped down in the seat. \"Forget it…\" Elizabeth grumbled in defeat. \"Nobody ever fucking listened before, why would they listen now?\" \"You do?\" Jo asked Bill still ignoring Elizabeth. \"Yes, so don't, don't do this!\" Bill shot back at Jo. \"Okay, I'm making extremely civilized conversation here. You're biting my head off. Jesus!\" Jo argued again. \"Yes. She's very nice. No, she doesn't work at the station she's, uh, she's a therapist.\" Bill finished and Jo bit her lip and nodded. \"Oh.\" Jo paused slightly. \"Yours?\" She suddenly asked making both Elizabeth and Bill react. \"FOR FUCKS SAKE JO!\"/\"CHRIST!\" Elizabeth shouted and Bill growled angrily. \"What?\" Jo asked curiously. \"You couldn't resist, could you? Come on!\" Bill snapped at her acerbically. \"I'm not saying you need therapy!\" Jo fired back and Elizabeth gave her a dark look. \"I'm NOT saying that!\" Jo argued with Elizabeth who didn't even look convinced and didn't even need to speak. Elizabeth just shook her head and opted not to say anything. \"What?\" Bill asked suddenly hearing what Jo said. \"I'm not…\" Jo sighed trying to save her ass again. \"Wait. I need therapy?!\" Bill asked incredulously. \"I didn't say that.\" Jo shook her head. \"I need a therapist?\" Bill asked again and Elizabeth looked longingly at the door once more wondering if she could just throw herself from the moving car. \"I didn't say that!\" Jo snapped at him again. \"What could I possibly need a therapist for?\" Bill asked not letting it go. \"I don't know.\" Jo shrugged. \"You're the doctor, tell me!\" Bill argued and Elizabeth covered her ears lightly singing Raindrops keep falling on my head to drown out the fighting. \"I don't know, inability to finish things?\" Jo fought back and Elizabeth covered her ears harder. \"Finish things?\" Bill asked incredulous again. \"Rushing into things you can't quite commit to…\" Jo tried to tick off what Bill could have problems with and Bill interrupted her. \"Commitment?\" Bill snapped at her. \"You asked me.\" Jo shrugged with a smirk. \"Look..\" Bill started warningly and Jo put her hands up. \"You asked me!\" Jo snapped this time. \"No, that is bullshit! Look, I may have walked out…\" Jo interrupted Bill again. \"You asked…\" Jo trued again both ignoring the loud singing of Raindrops keep falling on my head from Elizabeth. \"But at least I showed up in the first place! You never had the slightest idea…\" \"Okay, there's a whole road thing- coming on up here…\" Jo motioned towards the road they were on. \"About commitment and what being married means. Like stability, supportiveness, the house and all kinds of neat stuff like that…\" Bill wasn't listening to Jo and they started to veer off of the road. \"Can I drive?\" Jo asked suddenly making Elizabeth look over at her curiously. \"No.\" Bill snapped at her. \"Then would you?\" Jo asked pointedly making Elizabeth look out the window and her eyes went wide. \"HOLY SHIT!\" She shouted and Bill looked noticing finally they were off road and about to crash into a tractor. \"Whoa! Dammit!\" Bill cursed for a second and Jo smirked. \"Somebody should warn her about your temper.\" Jo admitted and Elizabeth gaped at her in shock. \"You really can't stop, can you?\" Elizabeth asked shaking her head. \"Jo, I swear…\" Bill started and Jo cut him off ignoring Elizabeth. \"She obviously has no idea what she's getting into…\" Jo mentioned again. \"Stay the hell out of it!\" Bill snarled at her making Elizabeth slump in the seat again. \"Big surprise, they don't listen…\" She grumbled darkly. \"You know.\" Jo started and Bill cut her off. \"I know exactly what I'm doing.\" Bill snarked back at her and Elizabeth just kept her mouth shut. \"What exactly…\" Jo kept going. \"What am I doing?\" Bill asked as they continued to bicker. \"You know what? As long as you're happy…\" Jo started and Elizabeth looked pleadingly upwards. \"please let this end…\" She whispered worriedly. \"Thank you! I am happy! I'm a happy person. I'm happy with my life. I'm happy with the way things are going in my life. I'm happy with...with, with…\" \"Melissa.\" Jo supplied and Bill glowered at her. \"I know her name! Yes, I'm happy with Melissa. I am!\" Bill didn't really sound convincing but Elizabeth just kept her mouth shut until Jo broke the last straw on her camel's back. \"Okay. You love me!\" Jo taunted Bill and this finally set Elizabeth off. \"FOR GOD'S SAKE WOULD YOU BOTH JUST SHUT THE FUCK UP?!\" She screamed as loud as she could. Elizabeth breathed in deeply as Jo and Bill stared at her in shock. \"Hey, are you guys gonna wrap this up pretty soon?\" Beltzer asked over the radio and Bill snapped back at him. \"WHAT?!\" Bill growled back through the radio. \"Oh, nothin. I was just wonderin' if we're gonna chase this tornado, or if you just wanna catch the next one?\" Beltzer asked with a smirk. \"Shit!\" Bill cursed seeing a tornado nearby and Elizabeth sighed in relief. \"Tim you are a fucking godsend…I am so naming my child after you!\" Elizabeth mentioned over the radio before Jo snatched it from her hand. \"Beltzer, is it on the ground?\" Jo asked as Bill pushed down on the gas. \"Easy, easy, easy!\" They turned a corner and Elizabeth had to hold onto the dash board because there was no belt for the middle. \"We're moving to intercept guys, get ready to set up.\" Jo ordered the group. \"You got it!\" Beltzer laughed still slightly amused by Elizabeth's reaction.[Chapter 8] \"You got to get further ahead of it.\" Jo yelled to Bill who rolled his eyes. \"I know what I'm doing.\" Bill snapped at her and Elizabeth sighed. \"God they're at it again…\" Elizabeth bemoaned darkly. \"Cut across the field, Bill!\" Jo ordered Bill who grumbled to himself. \"I know I have to get ahead of it.\" Bill snapped back at her. \"You're gonna have to get into that field!\" Jo tried again and Bill glared at her. \"Do you want to drive?\" Bill asked suddenly and Jo kept trying. \"I'm just saying…\" Jo was interrupted once more. \"Would you like to drive?!\" Bill shouted at her. \"Yes, I'd love to!\" Jo snapped finally. \"Listen, it's about, 3 miles southeast, let's see what she does!\" Rabbit mentioned over the radio and Elizabeth smirked slightly hearing him. \"Go in there, go in there!\" Jo pointed Bill into an irrigation ditch. \"Just wait…\" Bill muttered again and Jo rolled her eyes. \"You're gonna miss it!\" Jo yelled at him and even Elizabeth had to agree. \"Bill she's right, if we don't go now, this shit will be for nothing…\" Elizabeth mentioned and Bill glowered at her. \"Hold on, hold on! Just hold on a second!\" Bill snapped at both of them now. \"Have you lost your nerve?\" Jo asked tauntingly and Elizabeth bit her lip worriedly. \"Tighten your seatbelt!\" Bill told the two women slyly and Jo moved her seatbelt to lock her more into place and Elizabeth glared at Bill. \"What seatbelt?! I DON'T HAVE ONE!\" Elizabeth shouted angrily and Bill gave her an evil grin. \"Then hold on tight buttercup…\" He informed her and she groaned in despair. \"Sometimes I really hate you!\" Elizabeth growled as she put her hands up trying to brace herself from bouncing up against the ceiling of the truck. Bill drove the truck down into the irrigation ditch and Elizabeth gave up after awhile because evidently you CAN'T brace yourself against that kind of turbulence. \"Jo, Bill, where are you? We lost visual!\" Dusty shouted over the radio worriedly. \"Hey guys?!\" Rabbit asked this time. \"Bill, Jo, El? Somebody answer!\" Rabbit sounded like he was getting freaked out more and more. \"Sounds like your boyfriend is getting nervous.\" Bill grumbled as the truck bounced in the ditch. \"Bill shut up and focus on NOT killing us!\" Elizabeth shouted acerbically. \"Are we having fun yet?\" Bill asked Jo snidely who sighed. \"Okay, we got to get out of this.\" Jo admitted. \"Really?!\"/\"No shit Sherlock!\" Bill and Elizabeth both shouted at her and she rolled her eyes at them. \"2 miles now, picking up speed!\" Dusty wasn't sure where they were but he still gave them the readouts. Dusty looked over at Rabbit who was pacing and running his hand over the back of his neck nervously. \"Seriously one of you three needs to say something because Rob looks like he's about to have a coronary…\" \"Dusty look we're trying not to get killed right now!\" Jo shouted through the radio making everybody on Dusty's side look over at Rabbit who had paled. \"Yeah, that probably wasn't the greatest thing to say boss.\" Joey muttered darkly through the radio. \"Bill, sometime this week would be good!\" Jo snapped at Bill ignoring the people on the other side of the radio. \"I'm trying to get out!\" Bill growled back when they hit another bump causing Elizabeth to smack her head into the ceiling. \"OW!\" She held her head. \"GOD DAMMIT BILL!\" \"SHUT UP!\" Bill shouted back at her when he noticed that the sides were too steep to get out of the ditch now. \"Are you mad?\" Jo asked nervously. \"I'll be mad later, right now I'm trying not to kill us!\" Bill shouted as the truck hit another bump. This time Elizabeth managed to brace against the dashboard so she didn't go flying upwards. \"Funnel's getting thicker! It's movin' fast, coming toward you Jo!\" Dusty warned them through the radio. Jo and Elizabeth noticed that the tornado destroyed a barn that was close by and Elizabeth paled. \"Oh Jesus…\" She muttered darkly. \"It's starting to turn!\" Jo shouted getting worried. \"Where? I can't see!\" Bill asked and Elizabeth shook her head. \"You will.\" Elizabeth grumbled to herself. \"Jo, you're too close, it's not gonna work. Get outta there!\" Dusty shouted through the radio not bothering to hide his worry this time. \"Shit! I can't get out, it's too steep! This was a great idea!\" Bill shouted over the roaring wind when he noticed the tornado was inside the ditch with them and gaining on them. They smacked the truck into a low overpass and hurriedly got of the truck. Jo and Bill started to get Dorothy ready. \"SEE, THAT WASN'T SO BAD! COMON', LET'S GET HER OUT! LET'S GO!\" Jo shouted to Bill. \"Why can't we spend a normal day together?!\" Bill asked Jo before he looked at Elizabeth. \"El, we only need two people for this…get yourself to the overpass and hunker down!\" Elizabeth didn't need to be told twice and she slid under the small bridge and groaned in disgust at the mud coating her now. \"We're in the damage path, let's go!\" Bill shouted to Jo as he grabbed her up and tried to make her get under the bridge with Elizabeth. Jo tried to fight him off. \"JO, THIS IS CRAZY, COME ON'!\" \"LET GO!\" Jo screamed trying to scramble away from Bill. \"THERE'S NO TIME!\" Bill grabbed her and forced her to move again. \"WE CAN STILL DO THIS!\" Jo tried again and Bill rolled his eyes. \"COME ON! COME ON'!\" Bill grabbed her up and forced her under the bridge with Elizabeth and himself. \"FIND SOMETHING TO GRAB HOLD OF!\" \"I KNOW!\" Jo shouted back at him and Elizabeth hunkered down more as she held on for dear life because the tornado was now only a couple yards away from them. Jo then decided to get a closer look at the tornado. \"JO WHAT THE HELL?!\" Elizabeth shouted at her. \"WHAT ARE YOU DOING?! WHAT ARE YOU DOING?!\" Bill screamed at Jo also. \"I WANT TO SEE IT!\" Jo shook her head and inched closer to the tornado. \"BILL GO GET THAT CRAZY ASS WIFE OF YOURS!\" Elizabeth shouted at him angrily and he rolled his eyes. \"COME BACK!\" Bill shouted at Jo and went back after her. \"I WANT TO SEE IT! BILL!\" Jo screamed and Bill grabbed her again forcing her under the damn bridge once more. \"HOLY SHIT!\"/\"LOOK OUT! LOOK OUT!\" Elizabeth and Bill noticed the truck was starting to slide in the mud then it was gone into the twister. \"It's gone. It's gone.\" Bill muttered as the twister dissipated and Elizabeth breathed in horrified shock at seeing the whole truck just get taken away. The three of them scrambled out from under the bridge and looked at the destruction that 'one' tornado had left behind. \"Where's my truck?\" Jo asked curiously only to see her truck land in front of Melissa's car as the rest of the caravan had figured out where they were and was approaching their location. Everybody could hear the Melissa screaming in complete horror at the near miss. Jo smirked slightly as Elizabeth put her hands to her face in abject horror. \"There it is.\" Jo mentioned smugly still smirking.[Chapter 9] Everybody hurried over to Melissa's car and began to ask if she was okay. \"Melissa?\" Bill asked and she got out of the truck shaking and panicking. \"Are you okay?\" Preacher asked worriedly checking her over. Elizabeth bit her lip and looked over and got Sanders' attention. \"Hey got get my medical kit from Rabbit's van. I'm going to check Jo and Bill out see if they need any stitches.\" \"You just missed the truck! Awesome! IT'S AWESOME!\" Dusty shouted with laughter at Melissa who didn't look amused. \"Melissa!\" Bill shouted worriedly trying to get her to react and she blinked. \"Oh God, Billy, BILLY!\" Melissa pounced on him with a hug scared out of her mind. \"You okay?\" Billy asked her again and she breathed trying to relax. \"Oh, God, I'm okay!\" Melissa nodded. \"Are you sure?\" Elizabeth asked looking her over quickly. \"Bill, she just missed the truck!\" Dusty kept gushing and Elizabeth gave him a wry look. \"Dusty…\" She warned him and he shrugged. \"God, what happened to you?!\" Melissa asked Bill worriedly seeing that he and Elizabeth were soaked and coated in mud. \"Nothin' honey, we're okay, we were perfectly safe!\" Bill informed his fiance and Elizabeth snorted in laughter. Sanders handed Elizabeth her medical kit and she started to clean the cut on Bill's temple and he grumbled at her. \"Stop whining ya big baby!\" Elizabeth snapped at her cousin who rolled his eyes. \"You're lucky it doesn't need stitches!\" Elizabeth heard Jo chuckle from behind her and she scowled. \"Don't laugh Jo, you're next!\" She warned the blond who kind of paled. After Elizabeth cleaned up the slice on Jo's arm and collarbone she tried to clean her own scratches. \"Need help?\" Elizabeth turned around and saw Rabbit standing there. \"Not really…\" \"You can't reach the cut on your shoulder…just accept some help!\" Rabbit snapped at her grabbing the kit from her hands. \"Thanks.\" Elizabeth muttered quietly as Rabbit cleaned the cut on her shoulder. \"Which bandage?\" He asked and Elizabeth handed him the butterfly bandage. \"Okay you're good to go.\" \"So what did it look like on your end?\" Elizabeth turned around asking and she saw the nervous look on his face. \"Scary.\" Rabbit admitted and bit his lip. \"Yours?\" \"Windy.\" She shrugged with an impish grin and he nodded. \"So…\" Rabbit awkwardly. \"So.\" Elizabeth offered back at him. \"I was worried about you…\" Rabbit's mouth clamped shut. \"Guys! I was worried about you guys.\" \"Real smooth.\" Joey taunted his friend walking past them. \"Shut up…\" Rabbit grumbled embarrassedly. \"Sorry about us worrying you.\" Elizabeth shrugged and Rabbit nodded and walked away. Rabbit and the others were checking Dorothy when Jo came over. \"Gone it's trashed.\" Jo shook her head at the truck and Dorothy. \"Just hang on a minute we'll take a look, I'll know.\" \"You okay?\" Jo asked Bill and Melissa. \"She's okay.\" Bill answered for both of them. \"Well, there's some good news. It did fly.\" Dusty laughed looking at the totaled truck and Dorothy. \"So what was it like?\" He asked Jo. \"It was windy.\" Jo answered making Elizabeth huff in laughter. \"Windy? That's intense…\" Dusty nodded energetically. \"All right, move it, Dusty!\" Jo rolled her eyes with a laugh. \"That's intense! That's intense!\" Dusty still laughed and the group looked over seeing Jonas Miller and his caravan driving by. \"Hey, the auto club's here!\" Joey nodded over to them and Dusty hurried over to Jonas' car. \"Fashionably late again, Jonas? Fashionably late! Gimmie kiss, baby!\" Dusty leaned in through the window and made to kiss Jonas who screamed for Eddie to keep driving. \"Loser! Loser!\" \"Why don't you find your own twister, buddy!\" Rabbit shouted angrily and Jonas flipped him off through the open window. Elizabeth glared at the retreating caravan and grabbed up a handful of mud and lobbed it at the car as hard as she could. SPLAT the mud ball landed against the rear window making the car jerk slightly because Eddie was startled by the sudden hit to his window. Elizabeth shook her head and went to go sit in Bill's truck in the backseat. She had stripped out of her shirt leaving her tank top on and tried to wring up the now ruined shirt and she growled and slammed the shirt to the ground in defeat. \"You got full coverage on that truck?\" Jo asked Bill who was consoling Melissa. \"Liability only.\" Bill smirked at Jo already knowing why she was asking. \"Liability only? It's a very pretty truck.\" Jo grinned impishly and Melissa looked confused. \"Thank you.\" Melissa mentioned and Elizabeth looked at them through the open back seat window. \"Don't even think about it. No way.\" Bill shook his head. \"Can I at least get out first?\" Elizabeth asked worriedly. The next thing anybody knew was that Elizabeth was stuck in the back seat with Melissa while Jo and Bill were in the front. \"How do I keep getting stuck with you two?\" Elizabeth grumbled darkly to herself.[Chapter 10] \"This is the caboose, this is the caboose! I'm waiting for orders, Boss!\" Dusty shouted over the radio. Elizabeth snorted in laughter when both Jo and Bill made a grab for the radio microphone. They looked at each other then both made a grab for it again making Elizabeth snicker again. \"Go ahead.\" Bill nodded towards the radio. \"It's your truck.\" Jo shrugged. \"No, really. You should.\" Bill nodded again and Elizabeth growled making Melissa smirk slightly. \"Dusty, the battle zone should be northeast of 81.\" Jo mentioned through the radio. \"Copy that, Jo!\" Dusty acknowledged and Melissa paled in fear. \"Wait a minute. Battle zone? Billy, what're we doing?\" Melissa asked getting freaked out. \"We're going again.\" Bill admitted and Melissa looked at everybody else in the truck. \"Again!? But back there you almost got yourself killed!\" She shouted getting freaked out. \"No, no. Just a close call.\" Bill tried to calm her down and Elizabeth shook her head. \"You're gonna cross 15 on Oklahoma412. 412.\" Rabbit informed them. \"I kind of miss my map holder. Laurence can't seem to stay still while holding it.\" Elizabeth smiled while looking out of the window and Melissa gave her a knowing look. \"Okay, copy that. Haynes, what's on the mesonet?\" Jo asked after she rolled her eyes at what Rabbit said. \"Winds continuing to back, VIL's are at…..uh, 60.\" Haynes informed them. \"Okay guys, let's go get it!\" Jo shouted to the team through the radio. Bill noticed that Jo was looking at the speedometer and so he was going fifty miles per hour and he pressed on the gas some more. They looked forward and saw that Jonas' caravan was a little bit ahead of them and they sped up to be neck and neck with them. \"There's your pal.\" Jo nodded over to Jonas making Bill and Jonas glare at each other through their windows. Bill saw something and slammed the brakes. \"What're you doin', what're you doin'?!\" Jo asked incredulously. \"Look at the updraft, the angle! It's gonna shift it's track!\" Bill nodded to the twister in the distance. Elizabeth rolled down the window and stuck her hand out into the weather and closed her eyes. \"Are you sure?\" Jo asked quirking an eyebrow at Elizabeth. Elizabeth brought her hand back in and looked at the water in her palm and nodded. \"He's right, it's going to be a sidewinder.\" Elizabeth offered and Bill looked at her in shock. \"You're not the only one that sense barometric changes…\" She snapped indignantly. \"Is that bad?\" Melissa asked and Elizabeth grinned. \"Only for Jonas if he doesn't decide to follow us.\" Elizabeth explained and Bill grinned at her in the rearview mirror. \"Wasn't there a road back there?\" He asked Elizabeth and Jo. \"You're right, go, go, go, GO,GO!\" Jo nodded finally seeing what the two meant and they tore off to find a small road that would put them right in the path. Melissa's cell phone rang and she jumped before answering it. \"Hello?! Donald, now's not a very good time for me, okay? What...all right, put Julie on. Okay.\" Melissa nodded into the phone. \"We're close.\" Bill muttered darkly. \"Rabbit, tell me what road we're on, where does this take us?\" Jo asked Rabbit while Melissa talked to one of her clients. \"I know it feels unnatural but with Donald's motility, you're not gonna have this baby the old-fashioned way. Even if you stand on your head.\" Melissa mentioned over the phone now even Elizabeth was looking at her. \"What kind of relationship therapist are you?!\" Elizabeth asked curiously and Melissa covered the receiver. \"Reproductive.\" Melissa mentioned to her before she got back on her phone. \"Laurence? Laurence come in, we've got to get ahead of this storm, what's on the satellite?\" Jo shook her head and started talking to the team again. \"I can't talk to you right now, I'll have to call you back.\" Melissa tried to get Julia to hang up. \"Twister south, skipping south, shifting to south, we have a, F2, ladies and gentlemen, possibly F3. You with me? It's a very, very large rope on the ground. Very large. Right on the ground.\" Laurence told everybody over the radio. \"It looks like it's turning, it looks like it's turning. The atmosphere is very unstable! Repeat, unstable!\" Joey shouted through the radio. \"This is Rabbit, this is Rabbit, it's at 2:00, it's headed this way!\" Rabbit shouted worriedly and the gang in the main car tried to follow all of the conversations. \"This is Sanders, this is Sanders! We're driving due east on a country road we've been on for about 6 miles. We've got an F3, 2, sitting on the ground, and she's a beauty! WHOOHOO!\" Sanders shouted in excitement making everybody roll their eyes. \"Jo, it's a Barn Burner, it's a Barn Burner! It's not gonna hang out long. It's not hanging out long!\" Dusty warned them and Elizabeth bit her lip looking at the twister. \"We got it, we got it, we see it!\" Jo answered back and they noticed that the sky around them was very dark even for an afternoon. \"We're getting slammed in here guys, you better hang back.\" Bill shouted through the radio. \"El, hand me the camera!\" Jo shouted and Elizabeth handed her the high speed camera. \"This thing loaded?\" Jo asked Bill. \"Yeah, go for it.\" Bill nodded and Jo was about to start taking pictures when Elizabeth frowned. \"Rain bands.\" Elizabeth muttered to herself making Melissa look at her confusedly. \"What?\" She asked worriedly. \"Bill, Jo look at the surf coming from the fields!\" Elizabeth warned them and they looked over. \"Shit, horizontal rain. Hang on!\" Bill growled and floored the gas. The truck was now on top of a bridge crossing a lake. The twister was starting to suck the water up from the lake. \"Jesus, Bill, I've never seen it clouded like this!\" Jo shook her head. \"I don't think anybody has. But, I…\" Bill cut himself off because he was trying to pay attention to the road. \"Bill...we're in the core.\" Jo's eyes widened and without warning the twister split in two! Now there were two of them. \"Okay, we've got sisters!\" Bill mentioned trying to stay calm when Melissa's phone rang again and she hurriedly got on the phone. \"Yes?! Julie I can't talk to you right now!\" Melissa stated tensely though the phone. \"We're right under the flanking line!\" Elizabeth shouted worriedly while leaning forward. \"I realize that.\" Bill snapped at her and Jo bit her lip worriedly. \"We can't attack this thing from the south, we're gonna get rolled!\" Jo shouted at him and he smirked. \"Watch me.\" Bill mentioned and Elizabeth rolled her eyes and slumped in her seat again. \"Julie, I know you're upset, you just gotta, breathe, we've both just gotta breathe!\" Melissa was trying to get her client to relax while trying to calm down herself. Suddenly a cow goes flying the truck it was mooing in fear. \"Cow.\" Jo muttered in surprise. \"I gotta go, Julie, we got cows!\" Melissa shouted into the phone in shock before she hung up. The cow went past the truck again mooing again and Elizabeth frowned sadly. \"Another cow.\" Jo mentioned quirking her head. \"Actually, I think that was the same one. We've got drunkards here, we've got no path!\" Bill shouted. \"Poor thing…\" Elizabeth admitted because that poor cow had obviously been scared. \"This is not good, get us out of here!\" Jo screamed and Bill glared at her. \"I'm trying, okay?!\" Bill shouted. \"Floor it!\" Elizabeth screamed at her cousin but they all realized that wasn't going to do anything. Everybody in the truck was screaming as the now 'three' tornadoes whirled around the vehicle making it spin and slide. \"HANG ON!\" Bill shouted and they all continued screaming as the twisters forced the truck around some more then finally left to elevate back into the clouds and ceased to exist. Melissa and Elizabeth seemed to be frozen with fear while Bill and Jo laughed and fled the truck completely excited over what just happened. \"God! Was that incredible?!\" Jo asked Bill in a shout. \"Did you see it? It was incredible!\" Bill laughed then he noticed that Melissa and Elizabeth were still frozen. \"OH!\" Bill took care of Melissa while Jo hurriedly opened Elizabeth's side. \"El?!\" Jo asked worriedly and Elizabeth blinked and looked over at Jo. \"You okay?\" Jo asked again and Elizabeth blinked again. \"That.\" Elizabeth breathed in. \"Was.\" Elizabeth's hands shook slightly then she grinned. \"FUCKING AWESOME!\" Elizabeth shouted and pounced on Jo with an excited hug knocking them both over with laughter. \"Jo she okay?\" Bill asked worriedly and smirked when Elizabeth stood up still caked in mud from before laughing hysterically. \"HOLY SHIT! THAT WAS INSANE!\" Elizabeth laughed finally coming out of her shock at what happened. \"OH MY GOD THAT WAS SO COOL!\" Elizabeth shook slightly still a little rattled. The others quickly approached their location and rushed to see if they were alright. \"Did you see that?!\" Jo shouted to Dusty and the others while Bill took care of Melissa who was in hysterics. \"It's okay, it's okay.\" Bill tried to calm her down. \"No, I'm not okay! This is not okay! Okay?\" Melissa was crying and freaking out. \"Aw, Christ...I'm sorry. Honey, I didn't think.\" Bill hugged her. \"You know when you used to tell me you chased tornadoes? Deep down, I always thought it was a metaphor!\" Melissa cried some more. \"It's okay.\" Bill hugged her some more as the others were talking excitedly. \"Three times a lady!\" Beltzer shouted with a grin. \"Did you see the inflow jets on these fatties?\" Joey asked and Elizabeth huffed in laughter. \"SEE IT?!\" She shouted with a grin. \"WE WERE INSIDE IT!\" She shouted and Rabbit came over to her as Jo told the others about what happened. \"So are you okay?\" Rabbit asked worriedly and Elizabeth nodded with a smile. \"That was more fun than a carnival ride!\" Elizabeth admitted and Rabbit smirked nervously at her. \"Dude just kiss her already!\" Sanders shouted over making the others laugh. Rabbit bit his lip worriedly and saw Elizabeth roll her eyes and walk away from everyone to see if Melissa was really okay. \"I was thinking, it may not be too bad of an idea, if we just got the hell out of here. 'Cuz that was defiantly too many tornadoes back there.\" Laurence started to stutter a lot. \"We have to switch that kid to decaf.\" Elizabeth admitted to Bill who chuckled. \"Are you kidding? This thing's not over, we've only seen the start of it!\" Jo looked at Laurence surprised. \"Hey, you know what, uh, Jo, somebody couldn't help but notice how close we are to Wakita!\" Rabbit looked at the map hopefully. \"No!\" Jo shook her head. \"Yeah, and Aunt Meg wouldn't mind a pit stop, right?\" Sanders asked eagerly. \"No!\" Jo shook her head making Elizabeth laugh where she stood. \"I want some lemonade Jo!\" Elizabeth shouted getting in on the fun. \"Red meat, we crave sustenance!\" Dusty grinned at Jo. \"Guys, we are not invading my aunt!\" Jo shouted at them laughing. The whole group started chanting the word 'food'. \"HEY! We are absolutely not going!\" Jo snapped at them. \"Oh we're going…\" Elizabeth nodded to herself. The next thing anybody knew they were pulling into Aunt Meg's house.[Chapter 11] The older woman working with one of the welders looked over at the group approaching her house and she smiled seeing who was also there. \"BILLY!\" Meg grinned and started towards him. \"MEG! Come on, honey! Meg, how are you?!\" Bill asked and they hugged. \"Oh, it is so good to see you!\" Meg stated simply and then smiled at Elizabeth. \"And Ellie Harding you amazingly muddy!\" Meg laughed seeing Elizabeth caked in mud. \"Good to see you too.\" Bill laughed at the pout his cousin now had. \"Day before yesterday, I was telling Jo, how much I miss you!\" Meg mentioned making Bill and Dusty laugh at her display of drama. \"You haven't seen any of my new work!\" Meg complained to Bill when she saw Jo and beamed at her. \"Jo! Oh honey! Seen some action?\" \"You should have seen it\" Jo was grinning widely at her aunt. \"Yeah it was windy, muddy and wet.\" Elizabeth offered when Dusty and the other guys hip checked her out of the way to get to Meg. \"Meg!\" Dusty called and they all hugged Meg making the woman laugh. \"Hey, Boys!\" Meg greeted them and saw Robert Nurick reach down and help Elizabeth stand up and smiled at them. Elizabeth had the shower first and came out of the bathroom in a towel and looked around for her clothes and grumbled seeing that she forgot her spare clothes downstairs. She sighed in despair not wanting to go down there in a towel. \"Great, just what I need, Dusty will try to grab it offa me…\" Elizabeth grumbled to herself when the door opened. \"Hey, Jo saw that you left your clothes on the couch…\" The person coming through the door frozen and felt the clothes slip from their grasp before they made to grab them before they fell on the floor. \"Thanks Rob…\" Elizabeth mentioned trying to sound casual but still saw the wide-eyed expression Rabbit had on his face. \"A…anything else?\" She asked carefully and he blinked just staring at her in the towel. \"ROB!\" She shouted at him and he blinked again. \"Uhm…no…\" Rabbit stuttered slightly and backed out of the door and tripped over the bottom of it and stumbled out of the room. Elizabeth was now dressed and downstairs helping Meg set the table. \"So have you two jumped each other yet?\" Meg asked curiously and Elizabeth looked at her confusedly. \"What?\" She asked and Meg who grinned. \"You and Robert. It's quite obvious with the way you two stare at each other when the other isn't looking.\" \"What looks? The ones where we're trying to find a nice place to stick a blade?\" Elizabeth asked drolly and Meg laughed this time. \"I knew a boy once that tripped me, he also threw mud at me and argued with me about everything. I have to admit that I also made his life a living hell. I threw his clothes in the mulch machine and I spray painted his chair in school.\" \"Why are you telling me this?\" Elizabeth asked worriedly. \"That boy was John.\" Meg informed the girl and Elizabeth looked over the photo of Meg and her late husband John. \"Don't mistake hatred for something else.\" \"Is the food ready to come off?\" Elizabeth asked quietly looking down ignoring what Meg had said. \"Yeah, it's ready go and tell the others.\" Next Bill was in the shower and everybody was sitting at the table eating some food. Elizabeth sat beside Rabbit because there was no other seats available. She was eating some of her steak and she sighed in delight. \"No, in a severe lightning storm you want to grab your ankles and stick your butt up in the air.\" Rabbit shook his head at the conversation that started up and Elizabeth quirked an eyebrow at him. \"He's right, if you're gonna get hit, it's the safest orifice.\" Haynes shrugged with a grin. \"Yeah, I'd like to get hit by lightning once. Ya know, see what it's like.\" Joey admitted with sarcasm. \"It's not that bad, but then again I haven't been struck directly.\" Elizabeth admitted and everybody stopped and stared at her. \"A bolt landed twenty feet away from me. The electro surge threw me back a few feet and scrambled my brains a bit but I was okay.\" \"Oh so that's 'what' happened to you.\" Rabbit admitted teasingly and she glared at him and heard the chuckles from the others. \"Hey Meg!\" \"Yes dear?\" Meg peeked into the room. \"Do you have any pots for some rabbit stew?!\" She asked still glaring at the man beside her and he smirked at her. \"Don't be silly dear…he'd never fit…\" Meg shook her head and left. \"Hey, this is real lemonade! Hey, Meg, I'm movin' in here!\" Laurence shouted towards the kitchen and he drank some more. \"You guys, look out, make a space.\" Jo came in and was chuckling at the antics between Rabbit and Elizabeth. \"Look out, look out, look out!\" Jo mentioned to Melissa who was also watching the antics. Melissa looked at the steak that made her stomach clench in disgust. \"God, Meg, you've got a lot of beef. Where'd you get all this beef?\" Rabbit moaned in pleasure eating some more. Elizabeth gave him a wide-eyed look when he made that sound. \"Did you see my cows out front?\" Meg asked pointedly and grinned at the unnoticed look Elizabeth had given him. \"No.\" Rabbit admitted and Meg grinned at him this time. \"Ohhhh!\" Meg made a gasping motion and Rabbit started laughing. \"Ohh. Cool!\" Rabbit kept eating. \"You slaughter your own cows, Meg! Nice.\" Dusty grinned at her this time as Jo gave him a bowl of mashed potatoes and gravy. \"Potatoes?\" Dusty asked Melissa. \"Better grab some while you can.\" Jo told Melissa as Dusty slopped potatoes and gravy onto her plate. \"Meg's gravy is famous. It's practically a food group.\" Dusty offered to Melissa who looked completely thrown for a loop and Elizabeth smiled sadly at the woman. \"Shower's free!\" Bill shouted coming into the room and Jo practically ran into him. \"I'm next!\" Jo shouted happily and sidestepped Bill. \"Oops…\" Bill grinned at everybody and sat down as Meg handed him some food. \"So what did I miss? Oh I want that…\" Bill muttered when Meg handed him the food. \"Well Rabbit insulted El, and she asked Meg if she had another pot for rabbit stew.\" Sanders informed Bill who huffed in laughter. \"Okay then, so nothing important happened…\" Bill laughed to himself and coughed seeing the dual glares from both Elizabeth and Rabbit. Bill watched the television and was watching the weather news when Jo came back to grab a towel from the closet. \"How can you watch this garbage?\" She asked him and Bill huffed in sarcasm and brought the set closer while turning the machine up. \"Oh, pardon me kiddos. You guys gotta see this!\" Bill shouted to everybody. They saw the news broadcast that Jonas Miller had done. \"Careful, buddy, he'll steal your microphone.\" Laurence grumbled eating some food. \"Well for me, it's the thrill of the hunt.\" Everybody booed and hissed at the man on the screen. \"Man vs. nature. Having battle with the elements.\" Jonas admitted and Elizabeth sighed knowing that he did look good on screen. \"So as a scientist, can you actually predict tornadoes now?\" The reporter asked curiously. \"Well, no, they are very, very unpredictable, as some of my more unfortunate colleagues found out earlier today…\" Jonas smirked smugly and everybody groaned in dismay. \"Oh, turn him off!\" Haynes whined. \"But we hope to change all that with a system I have devised.\" Jonas admitted on the screen. \"God, he sucks.\" Dusty grumbled darkly drinking some more lemonade. \"Aw, shut up!\" Rabbit threw a napkin at the television set. \"BOOOO!\" Joey stuck his thumb down. \"Turn him off.\" Elizabeth grumbled sadly and Bill knew by the sound of her voice that she was getting upset about seeing Jonas in any vicinity. \"What a wiener.\" Bill shook his head and sat back down. \"He really is in love with himself. I thought it was just a summer thing.\" Jo grumbled to herself then looked at Elizabeth. \"How could you sleep with that man?!\" She asked and everybody looked at her in shock then over at Elizabeth who was still staring at the now off set. \"Temporary insanity?\" Elizabeth mentioned quietly with a shrug and she felt a hand on her back rubbing it. She looked expecting to see either Billy or Meg there. She was surprised when she saw Rabbit watching her sadly and he offered a sad smile and she huffed in laughter. \"Must have been that bolt of lightning…\" Rabbit mentioned quietly and Elizabeth loud louder this time and smile at him making him smile back at her.[Chapter 12] The group quickly relaxed and went back to eating and Jo went to use the shower. \"He's gonna rue the day. Dude, he's gonna rue the day he came against The Extreme, baby!\" Dusty grinned and Elizabeth rolled her eyes. \"Guys give it a rest.\" She scolded them making the guys laugh as Bill groaned. \"I'm talking imminent rueage. Imminent rueage.\" Dusty tried again and ducked away from the napkin Elizabeth threw at him. \"I was just wonderin' why do you call Billy \"The Extreme\"?\" Melissa asked curiously and saw Elizabeth smack her head onto the tabletop with a groan of defeat. \"Cuz' Billy is the extreme.\" Dusty grinned at Elizabeth giving up. \"Bill is the most out of control son of a bitch in the game!\" Preacher informed Melissa and Bill huffed in laughter, \"Nope…\" Bill started and was joined in with Haynes, Sanders and Joey. \"Third.\"/\"He's third.\"/\"Last place.\"/\"Dead last.\" Melissa looked confused and saw Rabbit pointing up towards the ceiling where Jo was and also pointed right beside him indicating Elizabeth. Elizabeth looked over and saw him pointing to her and she quirked an eyebrow at him. He shrugged at her and she nodded in agreement, not denying she was less crazy than Jo, but more crazy than Bill. \"Well regardless I've seen The Extreme in high gear.\" Dusty mentioned eating some more. \"So we get this one near Dalton…\" Everyone started to laugh as Bill groaned in horror. \"Oh, God.\" He bemoaned to himself. \"We're way too close, and Jo got the bid on it, she's filmin' it, right. And all the sudden, out of nowhere, this shitty looking valiant, comes pulling up, right in the way.\" Dusty continued the story. \"She starts yellin'. And this loser, stumbles out of the car, he's got like, a bottle of Jack Daniel's in his hand. He's naked…\" Tim Beltzer added into the story and Elizabeth giggled slightly. \"Traitor.\" Bill glared at her. \"He's BUTT naked.\" Rabbit nodded. \"Naked.\" Beltzer added again and Bill glared at them all. \"NOT naked! I was not naked!\" \"He's without apparel.\" Tim grinned ignoring his friend. \"Half naked.\" Bill tried again. \"Sorry Billy, you were buck ass naked…I only remember because the way Jonas gaped at you. I was sure he would pursue you, but he ended up dating me instead…\" Elizabeth offered making everybody laugh harder. \"So, Jo is yelling at him to get out of the way, right. He just- He strolls up to the twister, and he says \"Have a drink.\" And he chucks the bottle into the twister, and it never hits the ground!\" Dusty shouted with laughter. \"The twister caught it, and sucked it right up.\" Preacher nodded. \"Then Jo looked at all of us and shouted 'who the hell is that guy!?'\" \"And I said with embarrassment…'that would be my cousin.'\" Elizabeth explained and Rabbit grinned at her but he had a slightly hurt look when Elizabeth mentioned her dating Jonas. The funny thing was it was unnoticed by everybody except Melissa. \"Honey, this is a tissue of lies. See there was another Bill, an evil Bill- and I killed him!\" Bill offered making everybody laugh while they ate and drank some more lemonade and soda. \"No, that was a good size twister, what was that, an F3?\" Preacher asked after the laughter died down again. \"Solid F2.\"/\"Nope a 2.\" Both Bill and Elizabeth stated then quirked an eyebrow at each other. \"See now you've lost me again.\" Melissa shook her head again. \"It's the Fujita scale. It measures the intensity of a tornado by how much it eats.\" Bill explained and Melissa blinked. \"Eats?\" She asked. \"Destroys.\" \"The Fujita Scale, is like The Richter Scale for earthquakes.\" Elizabeth explained further and Melissa nodded thankfully now understanding a bit more. \"The little encounter we had back there was a strong F2, F3 maybe.\" Joey offered thinking about the triplets. \"Bet we see some F4's today.\" Beltzer stated hopefully. \"That'd be sweet!\" Haynes nodded eagerly. \"4 is good, 4'll re-locate your house fairly officially.\" Bill smirked to himself. \"Is there an F5? What would that be like?\" Melissa asked curiously and everybody stopped talking and looked at each other silently. \"The finger of God.\"/\"Like a black hole.\" Preacher stated simply while Elizabeth offered her input. \"None of you have ever seen an F5?\" Melissa asked worriedly. \"Just one of us.\" Bill admitted sadly and everybody tried not to look upwards to the ceiling where Jo was. A few minutes later Dusty was listening to the radio and heard a broadcast. \"Well, I think we have a serious weather situation…\" \"WE GOT ONE, BABY! F3! A MILE OUTSIDE PARLAINE!\" Dusty screamed through the house and everybody went into action. \"City of Wakita, this is a storm that has developed in the past 15 minutes. First - Alert Doppler radar shows that this is a very intense storm…\" The radio continued to broadcast as everybody mobilized. \"You ride along with Dusty, okay, is that cool?\" Bill asked Melissa who grimaced slightly. \"Okay.\" She admitted and Elizabeth whooped in glee running past them both and snatched the keys from Bill's hand. \"Oh shit…\" Bill paled and Jo hurried past him and she froze as Elizabeth got in the driver's seat and she whined. Melissa looked confused and they both saw it. \"There's a reason why I'm only 'third' on that list.\" He mentioned quietly to Melissa and she nodded realizing that Elizabeth was obviously a crazy driver. \"What's the word from NSSL?\" Dusty asked. \"Word is big!\" Haynes shouted in glee. \"All right, let's go, people!\" Bill shook his head and got in beside Elizabeth and Jo got in on the other side of Bill. \"You know where Jonas is?\" Jo asked Rabbit through the radio. \"Yeah, he's still in Milston, 30 miles from it.\" Rabbit answered. \"Let's all get movin'! Can we beat him?\" Jo asked Rabbit again. \"I'm working on it.\" Rabbit admitted. \"BUCKLE UP BITCHES!\" Elizabeth shouted into the radio making everybody laugh in their respected cars. \"Rabbit?\" Jo asked Rabbit again about how to beat Jonas but she was shaking her head with a smirk at Elizabeth. \"Hang on! Uh, let's go right through Wakita, we'll take Myers Road past the fire station, and we'll take 132 to 44 east.\" Rabbit nodded towards Sanders who was holding the map for him this time. \"Rabbit, do you know any shortcuts, let us know, we need every second!\" Elizabeth asked him and waited a minute or two. \"Come on darlin' don't keep a gal waiting…\" She mentioned through the radio and saw the van three places behind the truck swerve slightly and she smirked evilly at her cousin who shook his head with a laugh. \"Okay, about a mile up there's a little detour we're gonna take, a little walk in the woods!\" Rabbit came over the radio and his voice sounded a bit strangled making everyone chuckle slightly. Elizabeth let out a sharp 'YEEHAW' as she drove over a bump and Bill got on the radio rolling his eyes. \"Hey, it's bumpy here, folks!\" Bill told everybody to let them know what they were going to hit. \"Okay, let's get you wired.\" Bill set up a wireless microphone on Jo while Elizabeth drove. \"Okay, you're on!\" Bill nodded to Jo who thanked him. \"WHOOOOOHOOO!\" Haynes shouted when they shot over the bump. \"See, kids? An ordinary person spends his life avoiding tense situations!\" Beltzer informed everybody over the radio as they hit another bump. \"Repo man spends his life getting in to tense situations, BELTZER! WOOO!\" Dusty shouted in exhilaration. \"Okay, Rabbit, what have you got?\" Bill asked this time because he didn't want his cousin to make the poor man wreck the van back there. \"Okay, turn left here toward that farm.\" Rabbit nodded to himself reading the map. \"Is he sure?\" Elizabeth asked warily. \"You sure about that?\" Bill asked Rabbit. \"Uh, yeah. Trust me. Rabbit is good, Rabbit is wise.\" He stated through the radio making everybody roll their eyes. \"Rabbit also lost the race to a turtle…nice try though.\" Elizabeth admitted through the radio then she heard chuckling filter from the radios. \"Mother of God…\" Jo groaned to herself as they cleared a few bushes only to see more bushes. \"THIS IS FIELD RABBIT!\" Bill shouted into the radio. \"I know, keep going, beyond it, right through that brush! You see that brush right in front of you?\" \"In front of us?! WE'RE INSIDE IT!\" Elizabeth shouted angrily and Bill grabbed the radio again. \"Yeah, we see the brush, what's beyond that?\" Bill asked and the answer they got back was going to make their eyes twitch. \"Beyond what?\" Rabbit asked his own question making the others in the main truck glare at the radio. \"Is he kidding?!\"/\"Beyond what?!\" Elizabeth and Jo shouted at Bill. \"The BRUSH! A brick wall, a bearded lady, what?\" Bill shouted in the radio making Elizabeth look at him oddly. \"SHUT UP AND DRIVE!\" He shouted at her and she laughed and shook her head. \"Oh, it's the highway, it's the highway!\" Rabbit told them. \"Where's the road Rabbit?!\" Jo shouted into the radio this time. \"Yeah, where's the road, man?\" Joey asked this time. \"It should be any moment…\" Rabbit admitted confidently. Suddenly Elizabeth found the main highway and severed barely missing Jonas' car as his group went by and she started laughing uproariously. \"Jesus! You're insane Beth! What are you trying to do, get me killed?!\" Jonas shouted at her over the radio making Elizabeth look over at him as she kept a steady pace with his car. \"Oh baby…if I wanted you dead…you would've been dead long ago.\" She admitted seductively over the radio and winked at him. She grinned evilly seeing the bright red coloring Jonas' cheeks and noticed Eddie beside him laughing silently. \"YEAH! It was so nice of you to stop back there and make sure we were all right! IT WAS VERY CONSIDERATE OF YOU,HOW COULD YOU SEE TEN PEOPLE ON THE SIDE OF THE ROAD AND NOT STOP?!\" Jo just about spit venom through the radio so Bill grabbed the radio off of her. \"Let's try to keep the channel clear.\" Bill mentioned calmly and Elizabeth scoffed while Jo grumbled darkly. \"Dirtbag.\" Jo grumbled making Elizabeth laugh out loud again.[Chapter 13] \"We're gonna have to get off of this road.\" Bill looked out towards the sky. \"What? This is no time to guess…\" Jo shook her head and Bill glared at her. \"I'm not guessing. El, make a right turn. Trust me.\" Bill saw the hesitance and sighed. \"Look at the clouds and tell me what you sense.\" Elizabeth looked up at the sky and frowned worriedly and felt a barometric shift and she nodded. \"He's right Jo, we're turning.\" She admitted and peeled off of the road onto a dirt path. \"What's she doin', man?\" Sanders asked worriedly and Rabbit bit his lip worriedly and looked at the road as he drove. \"I dunno. Find this road, it's like, \"Bob's Road\"!\" Rabbit complained making Sanders laugh. \"Shit you gotta look it up for me man…I can't drive and read at the same time.\" \"You could let me drive you know?\" Sanders stated simply and Rabbit sighed and quickly switched places with Sanders letting him drive now. \"We've got a touchdown!\" Joey shouted to Laurence. \"We got a touchdown, touchdown, tornado is on the ground!\" Laurence repeated what Joey had just told him. \"Where is it?\" Jo asked looking all over the place. \"Looks like it's coming down route 33!\" Joey announced making Jo, Bill and Elizabeth look around. \"It worries me that we can't see it…\" Elizabeth muttered darkly and Bill nodded. \"What's the path?\" Jo asked Joey who was looking at the readouts. \"It's going about 35 miles an hour.\" Joey informed them making everybody look around but yet nobody was seeing the twister. \"Can you see this?\" Rabbit asked Sanders who shook his head. \"I cannot see this. Where is it? Hel-lo?!\" Sanders looked around. \"Joey where you guys lookin'?\" Rabbit asked through the radio. \"Where the hell is thing?\" Elizabeth asked herself. \"Direction, Rabbit!\" Jo snapped through the radio. Rabbit's face paled when he saw the twister and got on the radio again. \"North, northeast.\" Rabbit informed them but the group in the main truck couldn't see it yet. \"Do you see it?\" Bill asked Jo and Elizabeth. \"No.\"/\"Nope.\" They both answered. \"Do you got any thing up there?\" Bill asked everybody. \"North, northeast, do you copy?!\" Rabbit asked worriedly. \"Shit, it's comin' right at us.\" Bill groaned in worry. \"Actually, she's gone vertical, gone vertical. This sucker's really gainin' strength.\" Laurence informed everyone through the radio and Elizabeth paled with a frown. \"Do you see it?\" Jo asked Bill and Elizabeth. \"No. I can't. Beltzer, we don't have a visual. Repeat, we do not have a visual! Help us out, here!\" Bill shouted into the radio while Elizabeth drove faster. \"Where is it?\" Elizabeth asked getting frustrated. \"Yeah, I got it Billy. It's the best motion I've ever seen! It's like the base of this fatty is about half a mile wide.\" \"Rabbit?\" Bill asked the man over the radio again. \"If you're goin' east on 7, it should be comin' right over that hill in a matter of minutes!\" Rabbit shouted into the radio. \"This is the one, man. I feel it.\" Joey chirped in the radio excitedly. \"It's gotta be there.\" Bill shook his head looking around and Elizabeth rolled down the window and smelled the air closing her eyes. \"Maybe it's stalled?\" Jo asked and Elizabeth opened her eyes. \"No…it's coming, I can almost smell the static discharge in the air.\" She admitted quietly. \"Yeah, I think Rabbit and El are right. It's gonna show it's ugly face right over that hill. Jo, what do you think?\" Bill asked Jo who looked like she was thinking. \"You gonna go for it, Jo?\" Dusty asked over the radio. \"Jo?\" Bill asked curiously and she nodded. \"Time for deployment, guys, let's do it!\" Jo shouted into the radio. \"Oh man, this is the fun part, sweetheart!\" Dusty grinned at Melissa who was looking pale once more. The crew pulled over and set up shop while Bill, Jo and Elizabeth moved onward towards the battle zone. \"Okay, we got hail.\" Bill muttered to himself and Elizabeth cursed trying to maneuver through the massive hail stones. \"Hail. We got hail!\" Jo shouted into the radio. \"Guys please be careful.\" Rabbit muttered back through the radio and Melissa looked over at him with a sad smile. \"Upflow, Beltzer, we have upflow, copy?!\" Jo screamed into the radio. \"Yeah, Jo, I'm checkin' it, I'm checkin' it, she's almost up!\" Tim answered back and Elizabeth's eyes went wide and swerved to miss a branch that had come close to the truck. \"Bill, right now, this is it.\" Jo looked at him and Bill groaned and look at Elizabeth. Elizabeth looked at him and grinned. \"It's either one of you…I'm driving…\" Elizabeth told him and Bill groaned in defeat. \"All right, I'll get her ready!\" Bill slid through the back window and started to work on Dorothy and ended up being pelted by the hailstones. \"OW!\" He whined in pain making Elizabeth smirk evilly at Jo who laughed shaking her head. \"Do you guys see them? Do you see them?!\" Dusty asked everybody who looked confused. \"What?!\" Tim Beltzer asked confusedly. \"The red truck going right towards the core!?\" Dusty shouted at him. \"No!\" Tim answered and Dusty rolled his eyes. \"He's not talking about Billy is he?!\" Melissa asked getting more freaked out. \"ARE YOU OKAY?!\" Jo shouted through the window as Elizabeth kept driving. \"I'M ALRIGHT, KEEP GOING!\" Bill shouted back at them and Elizabeth smirked. \"I wasn't going to slow down…but thanks for the input.\" Both women heard the mocking Bill was doing of Elizabeth and she lightly tapped the brakes making Bill go slamming into the back of the cab. \"SONOFABITCH!\" He shouted in pain. He looked into the window and glared at Elizabeth who shrugged. \"Foot slipped…\" She admitted and Bill just glared at her before he went back to work and flipped the switches on Dorothy turning her on. \"Hey, Beltzer, we got a view!\" Dusty shouted happily. \"Yeah, I can see it! All right, I got it! THAT'S NO MOON, IT'S A SPACE STATION! WHOOOOOO!\" Beltzer laughed out loud and everybody sighed at him. \"Tim, you are such a nerd.\" Elizabeth informed him making him grin at Haynes who blushed. \"Debris! We have debris!\" Jo shouted to everybody as Elizabeth started to swerve out of the way from the things flinging at them. \"Ow!\" Bill cried out in pain as another hailstone hit him. \"Come on, Come on! Okay!\" Bill was trying to get one of the straps loose but it took him two tries before it worked. \"They're in the birdcage! Oh my God! Oh my God! Melissa, look at this! Take a peek! You can really feel it with a telephoto lens!\" Dusty tried to get Melissa to look at the twister. \"NO!\" She shouted getting fed up with everybody. \"Oh, come on' what's the matter?!\" Dusty asked with a pout. \"You people are all crazy, do you know that?!\" Melissa asked with a scream and Dusty just gave her a perplexed look. \"What?\" He asked not sure what she meant. \"Dusty, are you set up? We're not leaving 'till we get this!\" Jo shouted into the radio and Melissa threw her hands up. \"She's the craziest one of them all!\" Melissa shouted and Dusty just shrugged at her. \"Okay, she's almost ready!\" Bill was still outside getting hit while turning things on. \"Hold on, we're almost there, we're almost there!\" Jo shouted when a fishing boat went past them. \"ALMOST THERE?!\" Elizabeth asked in shock. \"ALMOST?!\" She let out a shriek of fear. \"Stop, this is fine!\" Bill shouted into the cab. \"Wait, we got to get closer, just a little closer!\" Jo shouted at them both and Elizabeth shook her head before a tricycle slammed into the windshield. \"FUCK THAT WE'RE STOPPING!\" Elizabeth slammed on the brakes making Bill hit his head on the roof of the truck. \"OW, fuck!\" Bill cried out and Elizabeth shot him an apologetic look. Bill and Jo got out and started working on Dorothy getting her prepped. \"You got it?!\" Jo asked worriedly as they worked. \"Yeah, she's all set, help me get her down! HURRY! LET'S MOVE! EL STAY IN THE TRUCK IN CASE WE NEED TO BOLT!\" \"BILL, HURRY!\" Jo cried out as they were both trying to unbuckle Dorothy. \"Damn! We gotta go now, come on'!\" Bill shouted to Jo trying to get her to move to the truck. \"WE CAN DO THIS! COME ON', COME ON'!\" Jo wasn't about to give up. A telephone then slammed down and crashed into Dorothy spilling every sensor onto the road and Jo started to try to run to it to fix it before the twister showed. Then there was nothing, like no twister ever existed and Elizabeth warily got out of the truck and looked around. \"What the hell?\" She asked herself and frowned. \"What's going on?! Aw, aw, I don't believe this! What the hell?!\" Beltzer asked himself while banging on the keyboard frantically. \"What's the Doppler say?\" Sanders asked worriedly while everybody was looking for the twister that had disappeared. \"The cone is silent.\" Preacher stated simply and everybody deflated. \"Jo, Bill, El, it's over! The thing was stable, and then, then it's gone.\" Beltzer told them in the radio but Elizabeth felt a cold draft through the hot air that made her shiver. She looked up at the same time Jo did and came to the same conclusion. \"JUMPER!\"/\"It's back Bill!\" Elizabeth shouted as Jo also shouted and Bill groaned in worry at what that meant. \"It's not through yet! You're right it's back building! We've got a jumper here!\" Bill shouted trying to hurry Jo to the truck. \"Beltzer, it's back building, we've got to track it! It's going to jump!\" Jo shouted into the radio. Rabbit heard the word jump and he paled in fear. \"Oh shit…get them outta there Tim! NOW!\" He screamed at the man. \"Data's incomplete, I think you should get out of there, you copy?\" Beltzer asked them but got nothing. \"Guys seriously, you have to get outta there! It's NOT good to be near a jumper when it lands!\" Tim Beltzer shouted into the radio. Elizabeth and Jo didn't respond to the radio hails because they started to watch Jo trying to pick up the sensors that had spilled. \"El, Bill, help. Help me!\" Jo shouted to them and Elizabeth just blinked at her. \"Jo, we should leave!\" Bill shouted trying to grab her up and carry her to the car. \"Guys it's going to drop!\" Elizabeth shouted worriedly and Bill grabbed Jo again but she slammed on his foot and he groaned in pain letting her go long enough for her to make a break for the sensors again. \"Beltzer will tell us! If it drops near us, it'll kill us!\" Jo screamed trying to grab up the sensors again. \"It's not gonna drop anywhere near us, it's gonna drop right on us!\" Bill screamed as he grabbed her up again and she flailed against him while Elizabeth watched in sadness. \"WHAT ARE YOU DOING?!\" \"HELP ME!\" Jo cried trying to pick more up. \"Jo, the pack's wasted, it's over!\" Elizabeth shouted worriedly. \"WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH YOU TWO?! WE CAN STILL DO THIS!\" Jo screamed in desperation. \"Jesus Christ, listen to yourself, you're obsessed!\" Bill screamed at her. \"You've never seen what that thing can do, so don't even talk to me about…\" Jo was interrupted by Bill. \"We just saw…\" Bill was interrupted by Jo this time. \"You've never seen it miss this house, and miss that house, and come after you!\" Jo screamed in anguish making Bill look at her in horrified realization. \"Christ, Jo, is that what you think it did?!\" Bill asked sadly. \"I don't know.\" Jo shook her head not sure of anything anymore. \"Jesus, Jo, why can't you just forget it?!\" Bill asked her in shock. \"You don't understand, okay? You'll never know!\" She screamed getting frustrated again. \"When's it gonna be enough, huh?! How close do you have to get?\" Jo tried to walk away from Bill but he grabbed her arm. \"Talk to me! Jo, things go wrong, you can't explain it, you can't predict it! Killing yourself won't bring your dad back. I'm sorry he died, but it was a long time ago. You gotta move on. Stop living in the past and look at what you've got right in front of you!\" Bill told her as Elizabeth frowned again. This time she wasn't frowning at the scene something had just shifted in the air. \"What are you saying?\" Jo asked pointedly and Bill gave her an exasperated look. \"Me, Jo!\" He shouted at her quieting her down. Elizabeth felt a blast of icy wind move her hair forward, then her hair went flying backward and she paled looking at the sky. \"Of fuck…\" Elizabeth got in drivers seat and screamed to Bill and Jo as she tore up beside them. \"GET THE FUCK IN THE TRUCK!\" They looked at her worriedly. \"THERE'S AN UPSURGE GET IN THE FUCKING TRUCK RIGHT NOW!\" She screamed getting Bill to curse and shoved Jo into the truck before he dove in himself. Elizabeth tore off just as a massive twister crashed down onto where they had been. It was now following them and lobbing items around like a child throwing a tantrum. The truck slid slightly as a tree clipped the back of the truck and forced the truck into a ditch. The twister then quickly disappeared and was gone for good this time. Elizabeth was hyperventilating and Bill looked at her worriedly. \"El?\" He touched her shoulder and saw the gray look on her face. \"I'M GONNA BE SICK!\" She covered her mouth and tore out of the truck heaving onto the ground. Bill lightly rubbed her back as Jo came around the truck looking paler than she had for as long as she could remember. \"Elizabeth?\" Jo squatted down beside her trying to calm her friend down. \"Thank god she was paying attention huh?\" Bill asked quietly and Jo looked away embarrassedly. Neither three wanted to admit that they had all come just mere seconds from being ripped apart by the twister landing on them. Elizabeth breathed in deeply and wiped off her mouth. \"Next time, when we say leave…we LEAVE! OKAY?!\" She shouted at Jo who smirked sadly at her and nodded. \"Okay…\" Jo promised.[Chapter 14] Elizabeth tried to clench out the shaking in her hands as the group made a pit stop at a local drive-in. Elizabeth watched a small amount of the Stephen King's 'The Shining' and she sighed getting bored. She saw Jo signing something and frowned sadly figuring that Jo was signing the divorce papers for Bill. Rabbit approached her and looked her over worriedly. \"I heard that you managed to save those two knuckleheads.\" Rabbit started and Elizabeth huffed in sarcastic laughter. \"Define, 'save'?\" She asked him and he looked at her nervously. \"I…\" Rabbit started and cut himself off before he took a deep breath. \"I was really scared.\" He admitted quietly and looked at her. \"I thought that you guys were…\" He tried again but he couldn't seem to find the right words. \"You really suck at this don't you?\" Elizabeth asked with a polite smile and he shot her an exasperated look. \"I was scared too.\" She admitted and he looked mildly surprised. \"Do you need a hug Rob?\" She asked with a sad smile and he nodded. \"Yeah…I think I may.\" He admitted and hugged her to him. \"That was too fucking close this time. If I had been paying attention to their fight and 'not' our surroundings…we would've…\" Elizabeth shivered slightly and Rabbit rubbed her back still holding her. Elizabeth was breathing through another panic attack and Rabbit looked at her sadly and lightly touched her cheek and started rubbing his thumb along the cheek trying to calm her down. She eventually did calm down but she reached up and placed her hand over his keeping his hand on her face. He looked at her and saw the hesitance. He licked his lips and flitted his eyes down to hers and swallowed nervously. His thumb then started to lightly move against her lips and she closed her eyes and leaned into the touch. \"El…I…\" He started quietly and they locked eyes and leaned closer towards each other. Mere seconds before their lips touched Dusty noticed what was happening as did Joey and Beltzer. \"HOLY SHIT! THEY'RE ABOUT TO KISS!\" Dusty shouted in shock making Joey and Beltzer stare at him in exasperation. \"What?!\" Dusty asked them indignantly and noticed that whatever spell had been between Elizabeth Harding and Robert Nurick had been broken by Dusty shouting. \"Oops.\" Dusty admitted embarrassedly as the two in question looked over at him then at each other before realizing how close they were and back up from each other. \"I should…go check the maps.\" Rabbit stuttered and Elizabeth nodded. \"Yeah and I should go see about the facilities.\" She stuttered herself and the two fled from the other. Joey and Beltzer gave dual growls of annoyance and glowered at Dusty again who looked down embarrassedly. \"I'm going to go check the radar…\" Dusty admitted and fled the scene before those two killed him. \"They were so close…\" Joey complained and sighed in defeat and Tim Beltzer nodded. Jo and Bill had seen the whole thing and they sighed in defeat when Dusty shouted killing the moment between their navigator and medic. Jo shook her head and gave Bill an exasperated look and he shrugged. Jo looked back into the snack bar and frowned worriedly. Bill turned to see what had her freaked out and noticed that the television had nothing on it but static. Just a minute ago it had been showing a news broadcast and it was just gone. Jo and Bill looked up at the sky both feeling the air grow heavy with static discharge. It was almost like they both could feel something brewing around them. They shared a panicked look with each other when Dusty cursed and flew from the Doppler van in a complete panic. \"Jesus, it's coming!\" He shouted and ran to Bill and Jo. \"JO! BILL! IT'S COMING! IT'S HEADED RIGHT FOR US!\" Dusty screamed at the top of his lungs at them but Bill heard loud wind swirling all around them and he shook his head. \"It's already here. EVERYBODY UNDERGROUND NOW!\" Bill screamed at everybody in the drive-in and Tornado Sirens started to blare seconds later. \"BILLY!\" Melissa shouted at him in panic because she had been in their motel room. Bill grabbed her hand and forced her to run with everybody else to the warehouse. \"Honey! Come on!\" Bill screamed making her run faster. \"What's going...what…\" Melissa couldn't get the words out as everybody started to dodge light objects that had started to be blown around. \"Jo! JO! Come on'!\" Bill shouted to Jo who finally snapped out of staring at the tornado and she shouted to the people inside the snack bar to get to safety. \"GET UNDERGROUND, TAKE COVER RIGHT NOW, LET'S GO!\" Jo, Bill and Melissa all raced for the warehouse doors where everybody was piling through the doors. Dusty and Rabbit were ushering people in and looking for the one's they knew. \"The doors! Close the Doors! Doors! Doors!\" Dusty screamed as Bill looked back out and screamed for Jo to hurry up. Jo was about to enter the warehouse but noticed Laurence hiding under the steering wheel of his car and she got him out. \"Come on, take my hand.\" She shouted to him. \"I can't…\" The poor kid was almost frozen with fear. \"TAKE MY HAND!\" Jo ordered him and he grabbed her hand and the two fled to the warehouse. The doors slammed shut and they started to head towards the pit where things were stored. Rabbit looked up in relief as Bill and them came down and paled looking behind them. \"BILL! WHERE THE FUCK IS EL?!\" Rabbit asked getting completely freaked out and Bill stared at him in horror. \"SHE'S NOT HERE?!\" Bill asked in a panic and he looked at the stairs to the upper part of the warehouse. \"NO! I THOUGHT SHE WAS WITH YOU GUYS!\" Rabbit screamed starting to hyperventilate. He tried to rush past Bill and Dusty back up the steps determined to find Elizabeth. Bill, Dusty and Jo grabbed him back down the stairs and he started screaming at them. \"NO LET ME GO!\" Robert Nurick was in a complete panic. \"SHE'S STILL OUT THERE!\" He screamed again as he fought against their pulling. \"BILL PLEASE!\" Robert pled with the man who closed his eyes sadly and opened them and looked at him. \"I LOVE HER!\" Robert admitted with tears filling his eyes and Bill felt a lump catch in his throat. \"It's too late! We need to get safe! She's smart! She'll hunker down somewhere!\" Bill shouted and they forced everybody down further into the pit Everybody was against the floor on top of each other and curled up into balls. The whole warehouse began to shake and the windows imploded raining glass down on them. \"STAY CALM!\" Bill screamed at everybody not wanting to think about his cousin who was still out there somewhere. As soon as he shouted that a high pressure hose came loose and started to spray everybody and everything. Both Preacher and Dusty made grabs for it but only Preacher caught. \"I got it, I got it! Hah hah!\" His victory was short lived as a random hub cap flew through the air and clipped him in the head and he fell back in surprise. Jo put her hand to the cut that had appeared on his forehead to stop the bleeding. \"IT'LL BE OVER SOON!\" Bill tried to calm down Melissa who was completely out of her mind with fear. \"THIS IS INSANE! THIS IS INSANE! I DON'T LIKE THIS! THIS IS DRIVING ME CRAZY! I CAN'T DO THIS ANYMORE!\" Melissa was screaming at the top of her lungs. \"STAY CALM!\" Bill tried again when a car slammed through the ceiling and the drive-in sign crashed on top of the car. \"It's okay, honey! It'll be okay!\" The wind started to die down but the lights still blasted themselves apart throwing them all into darkness. Rabbit noticed that the winds were dying down and he scrambled up and over different people in a blind panic. \"ROB!\" Joey shouted worriedly. \"I HAVE TO FIND HER!\" He shouted back at them and they saw the tears in his eyes. Bill closed his eyes trying to keep his emotions controlled. \"Please god let her be okay for all of our sakes…please.\" He whispered to himself and Jo looked over at him sadly. She sighed seeing the tears in Bill's eyes that he refused to let go and she looked around the mess they were all hiding in. \"Okay, very carefully folks move up the steps and outside.\" Jo took charge and the group of people left the warehouse to see that the drive-in had been almost completely decimated and Bill felt his breath catch in his throat. \"ELIZABETH!\" Rabbit screamed into the scene. \"EL!\" He shouted not knowing where to look first. He was ignoring the fact that the whole place had been torn apart. \"Rob…\" Bill Harding started and the man looked over at him startled. \"Rob…it's…she's…\" \"NO! DON'T YOU LOOK AT ME LIKE THAT! SHE'S ALIVE!\" Rob shouted in despair and the group of storm chasers either looked away or down to the ground not wanting to see the evidence that Elizabeth Harding couldn't have possibly survived this kind of thing. Haynes felt a sob catch in her throat and Tim Beltzer hugged her gently letting her cry. \"HEY! I need an ambulance over here!\" A tired voice shouted over to the others and they all whipped around to see Elizabeth Harding leaning against a beam that hadn't been destroyed. \"Other people are trapped in the storm drain we took cover in.\" Elizabeth grimaced holding the gash on her leg. \"ELIZABETH?!\" Robert gaped at her in shock for a second before the brightest smile that any of them had ever seen showed up on his face and he grabbed her into a tight hug and leaned closer as if to kiss her. She put her hands up and pressed against his chest noticing how fast his heart rate was. \"Rob…this…whatever 'this' is…needs to wait…\" She informed him. \"There's a nine year old and an elderly woman stuck back there. I told them I'd be right back with a crew to get them out.\" Robert Nurick saw the tired expression on her face and saw how much mud and mire had caked her body. He nodded in agreement that other's safety would come first. He was about to head off to find a crew to help the trapped people when he felt a tug on his hand and he looked back curiously. \"Later…\" She squeezed his hand gently and smirked shyly. \"Later, I'll tell you a secret.\" Robert 'Rabbit' Nurick blinked in surprise but realized whatever she had to tell him, would eventually lead to something really nice and he nodded and headed off.[Chapter 15] A couple minutes later the boy and his grandmother were reunited with the rest of their family. The woman who was the boy's mother looked at Elizabeth and hugged her. \"Thank you! We owe you more than we can ever pay!\" The woman started crying and hugged her again. \"Just seeing a family reunited is more than enough payment. You are raising a really brave guy over there.\" Elizabeth admitted and hugged the boy who clung to her also. \"It was kind of fun…\" The young boy admitted quietly and Elizabeth winked at him slightly and walked towards the others. \"Looks like we're going to have a new generation of storm chasers.\" Elizabeth told Haynes who just hugged her tightly. \"Damn girl….I need to breath!\" \"Rabbit was seriously freaking out in there El. It took Dusty, Jo AND Bill to pull him away from going to look for you.\" Elizabeth half listened as she took stock of the gash on her leg. Sanders cringed looking at the wound. \"Damn. You need a hospital trip?\" He asked worriedly and Elizabeth wiped the blood away and sighed. \"No, it's just scary looking. Looks worse than what it is. Can't even be called a gash.\" \"Dude, seriously Rob flipped the fuck out back there.\" Sanders told her seriously. \"So I heard…\" Elizabeth tried to ignore everything for now. \"Is that what it was like up on that hill?\" Melissa asked quietly to Tim Beltzer who shook his head. \"No. We were lucky. Those were just down drafts and microbursts. Tornado just side swept us.\" \"Can you tell which way it's headed?\" Jo asked Dusty about the twister that hit them. \"It's backing northeast. It's um...It looks to hit Wakita head on.\" Dusty admitted while his eyes looked completely panic stricken. Elizabeth dropped her med-kit in fear and she looked over at Jo and Bill. \"I'm goin'. I'm goin', let's go, let's go!\" Jo was freaking out and Elizabeth stood up with Joey's help. \"I'm coming!\" She shouted and Jo nodded while Bill looked at her worriedly. \"A slice on the leg, won't stop me from checking on Meg!\" Bill gave up with a nod. \"We're going!\" Dusty shouted and everybody started to mobilize. \"Jo, wait!\" Bill shouted trying to catch up. \"Where's the phone?!\" Jo wasn't even listening to reason. \"The lines are down, Jo, I already tried.\" Tim shook his head. \"We're going.\" Jo snapped at Bill who rolled his eyes. \"Damn it. Hang on, I'll drive!\" Bill shouted and grabbed the keys from her. \"Hey, Jo, look. We can jump on the 38 exchange and cross highway 132.\" Rabbit informed them and Elizabeth started for Bill's truck. While Bill walked over to Melissa, Elizabeth saw the look on Melissa's face and realized what was about to happen and she hung back a bit. \"Hey, honey, I gotta go.\" Bill stated simply. \"I'm goin' back.\" Melissa nodded and Bill nodded back. \"Good, good, you'll be safe at the motel. I'll see you in the morning.\" Bill offered and Elizabeth rolled her eyes. \"I won't be there.\" Melissa admitted quietly. \"What? Why? What are you saying?\" Bill asked confusedly. \"I'm saying goodbye.\" Melissa informed him and Bill looked thrown. \"No…\" Bill started but Melissa smiled sadly at him. \"You know, I can't compete with this. I don't even know where to start!\" She admitted and Bill sighed. \"Don't do this now, please. Please!\" Bill tried again and Melissa let out a small laugh. \"Sooner or later it would have ended, we both know that.\" Melissa told him but he didn't want to hear it. \"Please…\" \"The funny thing is, I'm not that upset. What does that mean?\" Melissa asked him and Bill just stared at her sadly. \"We can do it! Come on, let's move!\" Rabbit shouted running past them and gave Elizabeth a relieved smile and she blushed slightly. \"I never meant for any of this to happen.\" Bill offered sadly and Melissa nodded. \"I know, Billy, I know. It's okay.\" She offered with a bittersweet smile. \"Bill, come on!\" Dusty shouted running around. \"You go ahead. She needs you. I hope that Aunt Meg's okay.\" Melissa nodded towards Jo. \"What about you?\" Bill asked sadly. \"Oh, don't worry about me. I know my way home.\" Melissa shrugged and started away. Elizabeth hurried up to her and hugged her. \"As far as rookies go…you handled your shit a helluva lot better than most.\" Elizabeth winked at her and Melissa smiled thankfully at her. \"Sorry it didn't work out, you would have fun to annoy during family parties.\" Melissa let out a small laugh at Elizabeth's words. \"Just do me a favor.\" Melissa started and looked over at Rabbit. \"He loves you, and I am pretty sure the feeling is mutual.\" \"Giving me relationship advice?\" Elizabeth asked cheekily. \"Just don't let it pass by without doing anything about it.\" Melissa hugged Elizabeth this time. \"You'd better get going, and I really hope Meg is okay.\" \"EL MOVE IT! We can be in Wakita in about an hour. EL, BILL, come on'!\" Rabbit shouted again and Elizabeth turned to look at him. \"Calm down you Waskily Wabbit! I'm coming!\" She shouted back at him making him grin at her. Elizabeth sat between Jo and Bill once more as they drove into Wakita and saw that the town had been completely destroyed. Elizabeth felt tears rolling down her cheeks because there was so much debris and not enough people walking around. That meant that a lot of people had been killed. \"Oh my God.\" Bill muttered in complete horror. \"They had no warning.\" Jo sounded like she was stuck in another time and place. \"Oh my God.\" Jo saw that Meg's two story house had been turned into a one story house and she jumped from the truck and raced to the house. Elizabeth blinked in confusion that there had been so much destroyed but a good number of Meg's metal designs had stayed intact. \"Jo, Wait!\" Bill raced after her. \"El stay out here and wait for the others and get their help!\" \"Meg?!\" Jo screamed into the upstairs window and Bill stopped her. \"Jo, wait!\" Bill shouted. \"MEG?!\" Jo was still shouting but Elizabeth looked into the truck and got out two flashlights. \"Careful, this house could go any second.\" Bill was trying to get Jo to be careful. \"MEG?!\" \"BILL!\" Elizabeth shouted to him and tossed him the flashlights and he nodded in gratitude. \"Here, take a flashlight!\" Bill gave Jo one of the flashlights and they entered the decimated house. \"MEG?!\" Jo could be heard even from outside. \"MEG?!\" Elizabeth cringed hearing Jo still shouting. \"That girl has some lungs on her.\" Elizabeth muttered to herself. \"Meg?!\"/\"Meg?!\" Elizabeth heard both Jo and Bill this time. The others finally showed up and she directed them to where Bill wanted them to stay. The house started to buckle and they all started to race for the house in panic. \"MEG! MEG! Meg, Bill! Some one take my – Joey, take my watch!\" Dusty was ready to go when they heard Bill shouting to them. \"BILL!\"/\"BILL!\" Both Dusty and Beltzer shouted this time. Both Jo and Bill came out carrying Meg with them. \"We're okay, we're coming out!\" Jo shouted and Elizabeth breathed in relief. \"Get an ambulance over here!\" Bill shouted to Elizabeth and she nodded racing to find one of the ones that weren't being used yet. Elizabeth and Joey started helping the paramedics put Meg on a gurney. \"All right.\" Joey stated quietly. \"There you go.\" Rabbit mentioned quietly with a comforting hand on Elizabeth's shoulder and Meg saw the gesture and smiled. \"How 'bout some steak and eggs?\" Tim Beltzer asked trying to relieve some tension and Meg laughed lightly. \"How nice of you all to come over.\" Meg admitted to them making the group around her smile. \"Bill! Grab Mose for me, I think he's a little shaken up!\" Meg told Bill to get the dog for her. \"Don't worry I'll get him.\" Bill shouted for the dog and went back into the house. \"Is she okay?\" Jo asked worriedly approaching. \"We'll probably keep her overnight, just to be safe.\" One of the paramedics stated simply but Meg whined. \"Overnight? Forget it. I'm all right.\" She shook her head and Jo gave her a stern expression. \"You're going to the hospital.\" Jo informed her and Meg sighed. \"Okay, I'll go, but I'm gonna drive myself.\" Meg informed them and Elizabeth giggled lightly. \"Honey, your car is in a tree around the corner.\" Rabbit stated lightly and Meg pouted slightly. Bill had just come out of the house with the dog when the whole house collapsed the rest of the way. Elizabeth checked over Meg's medical data and smiled in relief that she would be okay. She was about to leave when Meg touched her arm. \"I would love to have some baby bunnies running around my place at some time in the future.\" Meg admitted pointedly and Elizabeth blushed a crimson color. \"Meg!\" She gasped at the older woman who grinned at her. Elizabeth looked over and saw Jo standing at the open door to the ambulance and left letting the two women talk. Minutes later Elizabeth was looking at the metal inventions again and heard Dusty meaning that the twister that hit them was now an F5. \"Go tell Jo.\" Elizabeth stated quietly still looking at the metal things. \"It's weird right?\" She asked Tim Beltzer. \"What?\" \"That everything is gone, but these things are still standing.\" Jo watched the ambulance rolling away taking Meg to the hospital. She heard what Elizabeth said and she looked at the metal decorations also and just kind of zoned out. \"You all right? I thought you'd go to the hospital with Meg. Jo? What is it? What is it?\" Bill had been talking to her when she smiled. \"I know how to make Dorothy fly.\" She looked at Bill who frowned and looked at the wind sculptures and grinned seeing what she saw. \"All right, I need every aluminum can you can find!\" \"We need cutters and duct tape! Haynes, Beltzer, I want to get the last Dorothys on the back of my truck, and I want everyone working on it!\" Bill shouted this time and Dusty was grinning like an idiot because they were back in business. \"We're gone!\" Dusty laughed excitedly. \"Hey Elizabeth!\" Jo shouted and she looked over. \"Your idea, technically!\" She shouted and Elizabeth looked at her confusedly. Elizabeth looked at Rabbit who shrugged. \"I have no idea either…\" He muttered and she smirked at him.[Chapter 16] The group headed towards the massive F5 twister that loomed in the distance and Elizabeth just stared at it beside Bill and Jo. \"That thing is like…\" Elizabeth started but couldn't even find the words to describe it and Jo looked at her sadly. \"I know right?\" She mentioned quietly before she got on the radio to ask if the others behind them were done creating the aluminum fans for the sensors so that Dorothy could actually fly with the little fans. \"Dusty, you ready for us?\" She asked. \"Yeah, yeah, we're good! We're good? We're good? Very good!\" Dusty was asking everybody and Bill rolled his eyes. \"Let's go, come on!\" They all pulled over to the side of the road and started to open Dorothy 3 and 4. \"We get 'em done?\" Jo asked Bill who nodded. \"I think so.\" Bill smirked at Elizabeth as she clipped her hand on Dorothy 3 and cursed before shaking off the pain. The whole group was now filling the two Dorothy's with the augmented sensors and locked them up. \"Beautiful!\" Dusty shouted and everybody ran around trying to get themselves ready to go. \"Okay, okay!\" Bill finished securing the locks on the devices and he nodded. \"Great job, guys, just be ready to report. Be careful, all right?\" Tim Beltzer offered quietly to them. \"Don't follow us close.\" Jo mentioned and they nodded. \"All right, you got it, boss.\" Joey agreed and Rabbit looked at Elizabeth seeing that she was about to get into Bill's truck. \"I really wish you'd stay here where it's more safe.\" He offered sadly and she smirked at him. \"You said it yourself, Waskily Wabbit. I'm less crazy than Jo, and more crazy than Bill. Where else would I be but in the middle?\" She asked and Rabbit smiled in defeat before he leaned closer and lightly kissed her cheek. \"Please just be careful?\" \"As careful as we can be…\" She grinned at him and hopped into the truck. Rabbit looked over and saw Jo grinning at him and he blushed before moving out of the way to let her get in beside Elizabeth. Bill saw the interaction and tried not to smirk at his cousin as he got in the driver's seat. \"So…when can we expect the announce….\" Elizabeth interrupted him. \"Shut up and drive Bill.\" She warned him but her cheeks were slightly pink and they all started to drive down the road towards the twister. \"Half a mile more?\" Jo asked Bill. \"That's sounds right. I figure we'll put it right in the middle of the road.\" Bill replied watching the twister's every move. \"Unless you think somebody will hit it.\" Jo looked at the looming beast. \"Nobody will be there.\" Bill argued and Elizabeth bit her lip worriedly. \"Or 'something'…\" She muttered darkly and Bill glared at them both. \"What is it with you two? Every time I say something you both have to…\" He cut himself off as both Jo and Elizabeth glared at him the same way. \"Seriously scary when you both do it…\" He muttered and kept driving. Bill stopped the truck and they got out and started to set up Dorothy. \"Hurry! Let's go, come on'!\" Bill urged the other two and they flipped all the switches and moved the device onto the road. The sirens on Dorothy 3 started whirring and Bill nodded. \"Okay, that's good!\" \"You got it?\" Elizabeth asked and Bill glared at her. \"Yes! Let's go!\" He snapped at her and she glared at him warningly and he sighed. The three storm chasers got back into the truck and Jo grabbed up the radio. \"Dusty, you in position?\" She asked curiously. \"Yeah, we're prime, ready for contact!\" Dusty answered back eagerly. \"This is it.\" Jo admitted quietly and Bill looked over at her as Elizabeth looked through a pair of binoculars. \"It's gonna work.\" Bill tried to sound sure of himself. \"Of course it will…\" Elizabeth nodded still looking. \"Just another minute, Dusty!\" Jo called into the radio. \"We're ready for it!\" Dusty answered. They watched as Dorothy started to slide along the road but not really having anything happen. \"Come on, come on. TAKE HER!\" Jo shouted anxiously. \"It's too light…\" Bill shook his head. \"NO IT'S NOT!\" Jo shouted not ready to give up. Elizabeth watched Dorothy slide along the road again. \"We're going to lose it!\" She shouted worriedly. \"No we're not! She can still fly!\" Jo screamed and directly after she said that an uprooted tree went crashing into Dorothy taking out the whole thing. \"Are you fucking kidding me?\" Elizabeth asked with wide eyes and they noticed that the twister was now coming for them. \"Oh shit…Bill drive!\" \"Oh my God!\" Bill stated simply as he threw the truck into action and ended up getting the rear bumper stuck on the uprooted tree making Elizabeth groan. \"This is why you always let 'me' drive…\" She argued and Bill glared at her and slammed the gas again trying to get them unstuck. \"COME ON!\" Bill shouted at the truck. \"Get us off this thing!\" Jo shouted at Bill while Elizabeth was covering her face with her hands. \"Oh god…\" She kept repeating this phrase as Bill and Jo were freaking out. \"Bill, kick it! BILL! Let's go! Right now! Hurry!\" Jo shouted again then she frowned. \"What is that?!\" She asked getting Bill and Elizabeth's attention as they looked at something being tossed around within the twister. \"What is that?\" Bill asked worriedly as they noticed whatever it was, was made of metal. \"I don't know, but anything big and metal cannot be a good thing.\" Elizabeth stated simply. \"Bill, hurry! HURRY! HURRY!\" Jo urged Bill again. \"This is not good!\" Bill shook his head worriedly trying to get the truck unstuck. \"I know what it is…\" Elizabeth admitted shakily and they looked at her. \"It's a tanker.\" She stated in dread and then looked at her cousin. \"PUNCH IT!\" She screamed at him and he rolled his eyes. \"WHAT DO YOU THINK I'VE BEEN TRYING TO DO?!\" Bill shouted back at her making Jo growl at them. \"HURRY UP!\" Jo screamed at them both. \"HOLD ON!\" Bill screamed as the tanker clipped into the bumper knocking them off of the tree. \"MOVE IT!\" Elizabeth shouted in fear and they tore off down the road. The tanker then lifted up and flew past them landing right in front of them. As soon as the tanker landed it exploded on contact and they drove right through the exploding flames. Jo grabbed the roof freaking out as Elizabeth let out a scream that would put most horror movies to shame. They came out the other side of the explosion singed, but alive. Jo and Elizabeth tried to breath past the fear and Bill took in a deep breath. \"Son of a bitch!\" Bill stated simply to himself before Dusty came over the radio. \"Jo, Bill, You all right?! Fact, can you guys hear me? You okay?\" \"Define 'okay'…\" Elizabeth muttered darkly as Jo got on the radio. \"We're okay.\" \"Did you guys see that explosion?\" Dusty asked excitedly and Elizabeth glowered at the radio in Jo's hands. \"I am so killing him…\" Elizabeth promised herself making Bill chuckle through his residual fear. \"We saw it.\" Jo answered sarcastically. \"This one, she's still moving northeast on 80, you copy?\" Rabbit informed them over the radio next. \"This is it. Last one.\" Bill nodded his head towards Dorothy 4. \"Last time.\" Jo realized that if they screwed this one up it was all over. \"Son of a bitch.\" Elizabeth cursed and pointed towards Jonas' group that looked like they were going to beat them to the twister. \"They have to be there somewhere. They have position. They could make it.\" Bill admitted quietly and Jo sighed. \"Not unless they anchored the pack.\" Jo got on the radio. \"Jonas? This is Jo. Can you hear me?\" \"Not now, Harding.\" Jonas practically snarled into the radio. \"Jonas, listen to me. The pack is too light, the twister will toss it before it reaches the core, you have to anchor it.\" Jo offered and Jonas interrupted her. \"Oh, sharing valuable information, Jo? I'll consider that, thank you.\" \"Jonas, listen to me! Don't be a…what? Do you see them?\" Jo asked Bill who took the radio from her. \"Jonas, what's your position?\" Bill asked worriedly. \"Oh, howdy, Bill. We are heading northeast running parallel and about to pull ahead of it on the left, why?\" Jonas asked with fake politeness. \"Hang back a minute, we've got a pretty good view from back here. She could shift her track, and if she does, she's gonna come right at you! D'you copy?\" Bill asked them worriedly. Elizabeth grabbed the radio from Bill. \"Eddie for god's sake get out of there! Please….you have to think about your family! This thing is too big to go that angle!\" Elizabeth screamed into the radio. \"She's shifting.\" Jo informed them both and Elizabeth let out a worried sob. \"Oh god please no…\" Before their eyes Jonas' car gets sucked up into the tornado. Elizabeth let out a sorrowful cry as something punched through the drivers side obviously killing her friend on contact. Jonas' car crashed into the ground and exploded. Elizabeth's face was paler than it had ever been and she felt the radio fall from her suddenly numb fingers. \"We tried. There's nothing we could do.\" Jo tried to get through to Elizabeth but the girl beside her turned tearful eyes to her. \"He had another kid on the way…\" Elizabeth stated quietly and Bill looked at them both determinedly. \"There is something we can do…\" He vowed angrily. \"Bill, Jo, ground speed is increasing. Get ahead of it as fast as you can or she's gonna bury ya!\" Tim Beltzer informed them as they were now chasing the twister. Debris started to fly past the truck making Elizabeth's eyes widen. \"DEBRIS!\" Elizabeth shouted worriedly and Jo got on the radio. \"DUSTY, WE HAVE DEBRIS!\" Jo shouted to Dusty. \"DEBRIS?!\" Bill asked in an exasperated fashion. Jo directed Bill as he drove past the things that crashed in front of them. \"RIGHT! LEFT! RIGHT! LEFT! DUCK!\" Jo shouted the words as Bill steered as she spoke and then a tire clipped their windshield. \"What now?\" Bill asked worriedly after all the debris seemingly stopped flying at them. \"I have no idea.\" Jo shook her head and Elizabeth's eyes widened and mouth dropped open. \"You guys still with us?\" Dusty asked worriedly over the radio. Bill and Jo saw what Elizabeth had seen and an entire house started rolling across the road and they couldn't both stopping and Elizabeth growled. \"HOW DOES THAT SHIT EVEN HAPPEN?!\" She screamed angrily. \"I think we're goin' in!\" Bill shouted and they went into the house and up the stairs and came crashing out of the other side of the house. A random teddy bear hit the windshield and a second or two of awkward silence. \"Maybe we should get off of this road…\" Bill offered after the shock had passed and Elizabeth rolled her eyes. \"No really you think?!\"/\"I think you may be right.\" Elizabeth and Jo spoke at the same time. \"Seriously are you all right?\" Dusty asked again and Jo got on the radio. \"Yes. You guys set up?\" Jo asked her team. \"Jo, we're set. Goin' in?\" Dusty asked worriedly. \"We're goin' in.\" Jo saw the nods from both Elizabeth and Bill. \"You ready?\" Bill asked Elizabeth who sighed in defeat. \"Crap…\" She grumbled and started to open the back window to go through. \"Be careful.\" He warned her and Elizabeth rolled her eyes and slipped through the window and started to flip the switches on Dorothy 4 when Bill smirked at Jo and lightly tapped the brakes making Elizabeth crack into the cab side. \"YOU JACKASS!\" She shouted at him poking her head in the window after switching the machine on. \"She's up.\" She glared at Bill who smirked back at her. \"Sorry, foot slipped.\" He offered snarkily making Jo huff in laughter. \"It's a wonder how you two haven't killed each other yet.\" \"Okay.\" Bill nodded to himself. \"We're going to have to lose the whole truck…pack is too light.\" \"So much for Liability Only.\" Elizabeth snarked back at him and he grinned at her as he pulled into a corn field. \"When we jump out you jump off the back all right?!\" Bill shouted to her through the open window and Elizabeth nodded. Back with the others Rabbit was pacing trying to spot them through the binoculars. \"Where are they?! I can't see 'em!\" He muttered worriedly. \"We're tracking 'em great. The speed's still increasing.\" Haynes offered quietly trying to calm him down. \"I've never seen anything like this.\" Tim Beltzer shook his head at the massive beast in the distance. \"They're gonna punch the core.\" Dusty realized and Rabbit bit his lip worriedly. Jo and Bill were getting prepped to jump from the sides of the truck while Elizabeth waited to see them jump so she could jump out of the back. \"You two ready?\" Jo asked both of them and Elizabeth just gave a thumbs up. \"Let me just set the cruise control. Okay we're good.\" Bill and Jo opened the doors and Elizabeth nodded to them getting ready. \"One...Two...Three!\" Bill and Jo jumped out of the side of the truck and Elizabeth lunged out of the back of the truck and was helped up by Jo and Bill as they watched the truck going towards the twister with Dorothy 4 still active. The three of them watched in excitement as Dorothy and her sensors were taken into the twister and activated. \"Yes! YES!\" Jo screamed in triumph and Elizabeth started laughing in disbelief and Bill hugging them both. \"Dorothy's flying'! Baby, she's flying'!\" Dusty shouted seeing the sensors activate and everybody was celebrating victory. \"We're going to be very popular!\" Joey laughed happily and Tim Beltzer huffed in laughter. \"It's Christmas Time! Look at that!\" He shouted in glee as they all looked at the readings. \"Look at these readings!\" Haynes admitted and then everybody paled in fear seeing what the twister was going to do next. \"Guys, it's about to shift northeast.\" She mentioned quietly and Dusty got on the radio worriedly. \"BILL, JO, EL! YOU'VE GOT TO GET OUT OF THERE, YOU COPY?!\" Dusty asked into the radio not knowing that they had to get rid of the truck and with it 'the radio'. \"Please no…\" Rabbit closed his eyes in panic and felt Joey touch his shoulder carefully. The twister shifted and the three of them noticed that it was now heading right for them and they cursed. \"Oh no! RUN!\" Bill shouted grabbing Elizabeth and Jo by their hands forcing them to run with him. \"THIS IS NOT HOW I THOUGHT MY DAY WOULD GO!\" Elizabeth screamed over the roaring twister. \"The barn, come on! Look out!\" Bill rushed them both past a picket fence which was being ripped apart one piece at a time right behind them. They found an opening in the fence and hurried through it and found solace inside the barn, where they noticed several sickles, knives, saws and other various forms of cutlery. \"Nope screw that…\" Elizabeth shook her head at them. \"My God, who are these people?!\" Jo asked in horror and Bill scoffed. \"I don't think so! Come on! Let's get out quick!\" The three of them left the barn and tried to make it to another safe haven. They made it to the pump house and entered it. There was a U-shaped pipe that went into the ground and Bill got an idea. \"Here! These pipes go down at least 30 feet. We anchor to 'em, we might have a chance!\" Bill shouted and Jo grabbed some leather straps. \"Bill!\" They broke in her hand and Elizabeth had her own handing them to Bill. \"No good. This one is good El find more like it! Come on, get in! Hold on!\" Bill tied the three of them together and tethered them all to the pipe just as the twister tore the pump house walls and roof away. \"HANG ON!\" \"TO WHAT!?\" Elizabeth screamed at him over the roaring making him roll his eyes at her. The three of them were now inside of the tornado and while Bill and Jo were awestruck at the absolute beauty Elizabeth had her eyes clenched shut trying not to panic. Eventually the whole thing died down and dissipated. Elizabeth opened her eyes and the other two took stock that they were all still alive. \"You all right?\" Jo asked Elizabeth who breathed in slightly so as not to faint. \"Wow, look at that. It didn't take the house.\" Bill huffed in laughter making Elizabeth stare at him in surprise. The three of them looked around at the bright blue and sunny sky as they heard the loud music from Dusty's bus approach. \"Here comes the cavalry.\" Elizabeth tried to move from her spot in between Bill and Jo. \"We did it.\" Jo admitted to them both. \"Yeah, we did. Dorothy really flew.\" Bill nodded back to her and Elizabeth groaned. \"Could you two wait with the bedroom eyes, until 'after' I get from the middle of ya?\" She grumbled making them both laugh embarrassedly. \"We've got so much to do.\" Jo suddenly realized. \"Yeah.\" Bill agreed. \"I've got to get grant approvals for a new warning system, we need a bigger lab, you've got to do an analysis of all that data…\" Jo started and Bill interrupted her. \"I do?\" \"Yeah, we've got to generate models out of all this data, and I need to run the lab…\" Jo started again and Bill stopped her again. \"Oh, no, no ,no. You're doing the analysis, I'm running the lab.\" Bill huffed in laughter. \"You're running the lab? I don't think so!\" Jo insulted him and Elizabeth rolled her eyes. \"I'm running the lab! G- Do you always have to do things the hard way?!\" Bill argued with her and Elizabeth finally slipped from between them. \"This is actually worse than the bedroom eyes…\" She grumbled darkly and Dusty laughed hugging her. \"You got it guys, the sensors worked! The computers went crazy, we've got data coming out of our ears!\" Haynes informed them and hugged Elizabeth herself. \"Biggest twister ever recorded!\" Tim Beltzer crowed happily and slapped Elizabeth's shoulder. \"Awesome, man!\" Joey laughed in relief seeing his friends were okay. \"Hey, Jo, Bill, check out that sky!\" Sanders pointed and Jo smiled. \"You know what, I think we've seen enough!\" Jo admitted and kissed Bill. Elizabeth groaned turning away and found herself face to face with Robert Nurick. He smirked sheepishly at her and she grinned at him. \"So…\" He started awkwardly. \"What 'was' that secret?\" He asked curiously and she blushed. \"The reason Jonas thought I was cheating on him…was that called I out somebody else's name.\" She admitted looking down. \"Anybody I know?\" Robert asked with a shy grin making his cheeks color slightly. \"Well, he certainly doesn't like me messing with his maps.\" Elizabeth admitted with a smirk making her cheeks redden also. Rob's cheeks reddened even more and he made her look up at him and she saw the mischievous sparkle within. \"You wanna see my van?\" Robert 'Rabbit' Nurick asked her with an impish grin and she laughed lightly. \"I've seen it…\" \"All of it?\" He tried again and she laughed again before he leaned over kissing her. The kiss left her slightly breathless and she nodded her head towards the vehicle. \"So…van…?\" She asked and he nodded with a grin and kissed her while shoving her through the side door. Then the door opened again and Lawrence was thrown out and he grimaced back at the van before he headed towards the others. \"Where's El?\" Joey asked suddenly after he was tired of watching Bill and Jo. \"I think they're making some bunnies over in Rob's van.\" Lawrence admitted making everybody look over at him and then over at Rob's weather van. \"What?\"/\"What?\" Jo and Bill asked suddenly not kissing anymore and gaped at them making them laugh hysterically. The End ","Summary":" Twisted Lives Within the Twister Hydra350 Disclaimer: Yeah right if I owned this movie or the right"},{"Movie":"Olympus Has Fallen","Title":"Everything New","Author":"JanaeSpecter14","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11810851","Passage":"[Chapter 1] January 20th April Asher looked in the rearview mirror of her car, taking a moment to just look at herself. This was the start of everything new. She was going from the daughter of the Governor of Pennsylvania to the daughter of the President of the United States. How the hell was that transition supposed to go? She put off going to college immediately after graduating high school (much to her father's protests) to be there with her family during the campaigning. Now that her father had won, they were moving into the White House and she was starting at Georgetown in the summer semester, missing the start of the spring semester while moving. With all the craziness that was going to surround her family, she decided the best thing for her to do was to stay at home while attending classes. Plus, why would she skip out on living at the White House? They reached the gate seeing hundreds of people waiting outside, cheering for them as they pulled into their new house for the first time. There were tons of secret service agents around their cars, pointing for where they had to park. April parked behind her father before unbuckling her seatbelt, finding herself sitting there for a moment. This was it, the start of everything new in her life. With a deep sigh, she got out of her car, greeted by more applause. She was still freezing from the inauguration speech earlier that morning so she had settled on changing from her dress to a cozy Patagonia, leggings and Ugg boots. Her mother begged for her not to, knowing something like this was going to happen when they arrived, but this was April they were talking about. If you told her not to, she just wanted to do it more. They waved to the people for a few moments before stepping into the house for the first time. April took it all in, wanting to explore the entire place already. She wanted to take Conner and find all the hidden rooms the most. Actually, she wanted to call the Lincoln Bedroom as her bedroom the most. She looked to Conner, both of them sharing an excited smile before looking back to the house. \"I call the Lincoln Bedroom!\" She yelled before darting towards the front door, ready to move all of her stuff into it before anyone could. Her father was already prepared for this, though. He stuck his arm out, blocking her from running out of the house. \"No one gets the Lincoln Bedroom.\" He spoke in a tired voice, knowing this was going to be the argument of the day for his children. \"Oh, come on.\" April complained as Conner began complaining over her. \"She always gets the bigger room!\" Conner spoke with a bit of a stomp of the foot. \"I'm a history major. I'll be the only one who will actually appreciate it!\" \"No one gets the Lincoln Bedroom,\" a voice came from behind the two, causing them to both turn around at where it had come from. \"And that's final.\" April looked this guy up and down, pinpointing exactly what he was and why he was saying this. Secret Service. The soon to be bane of her existence. This particular secret service agent had dark brown hair clashing with the extremely light brown hair she inherited from her father. They actually looked like the exact opposite. He was tall, she was short. He was toned and muscular, she got winded after climbing up half a flight of stairs. He had a foreign accent while hers was purely American. In fact, the only thing that matched about the two was their bright crystal eyes. \"And who would you be?\" April asked in an almost accusing voice, making her father cringe. She was too much like her mother. Blunt. \"Mike Banning.\" He spoke without a beat, not impressed with her even a little bit. \"In charge of you.\" She scoffed before looking him up and down again. He was not like the other secret service men she had met. He actually had emotions. If you could call his cockiness an emotion. \"No one's in charge of me.\" She whispered a little bit. \"Yeah, okay.\" He spoke, giving her a bit of an eye roll before moving past her to go straight to her father, making his acquaintance. April's mouth dropped a little bit, a tiny smile growing from that. No one talked to her like that. It was actually kind of refreshing. She wasn't anyone special in his eyes. She was just his job. His way of making money. That's how she wanted to keep it. Maybe she did like secret service agents. Well, she liked Mike as a secret service agent. \"Mr. President,\" Mike spoke while moving to shake his hand. \"My name is Mike Banning. I'm in charge of your family's security detail. It is very nice to meet you sir.\" \"It's nice to meet you as well.\" Her father spoke while April moved to stand behind Mike, ready to have more communication with him. She wanted him to do it again. Treat her like she was nothing. \"This is my wife, Margret.\" Margret leaned forward to shake his hand while sharing a small smile with her daughter, knowing what she was doing. \"My son Conner.\" Conner moved forward, excited about just moving into the White House, he didn't catch what was going on with his big sister. \"And,\" Ben looked to his oldest, giving a bit of a sigh at her earlier behavior. \"You've already met my daughter, April.\" Mike turned around to look at her again, April catching her father giving her a stern look to be nice to this guy, but then again, this was April. \"Nice to meet you, Mr. Banning.\" April spoke as she leaned forward to shake his hand. Mike watched her as he grabbed her hand to shake, knowing already that this girl was going to be the reason he would get grey hairs. He had to admit though, he liked it just as much as April did. He loved a good challenge. And she was definitely going to be a challenge. \"Nice to meet you, April.\" His tone was condescending, doing his best to mimic her tone, making her smile spread just a little more. They were both dicks and they were going to love being dicks to each other. \"Let me show your family around, President Asher.\" Mike spoke, lingering with his gaze on April before turning to look at the President once he said his name. \"Sure.\" Ben spoke with a shrug, pushing Conner forward as he held an excited face. Once Ben reached Mike, he placed a hand on his shoulder. \"And it's Ben, Mike.\" Mike nodded respectfully letting the group walk ahead of him, but April just continued to stand there and look at him. \"You know,\" he spoke, looking her up and down again. She turned her head at that. This had to do with his training. Why else would he do it? \"We have to come up with custom nicknames for the President's family.\" He chuckled a little bit while shaking his head at her. He had never met a daughter of the president like this before. They were usually so respectable and good. She was something else. She was trouble. \"Why don't we call you 'Trouble'?\" She sighed with a shrug before moving to follow the rest of the family. \"If the shoe fits.\" Mike watched her walk off, shaking his head at her. Yeah, this was going to be a fun one. April had retreated to her new room after all of the stuff was unloaded from her car. It was a lot to take in. A new room, people doing the unloading and unpacking for her. She was even told she could practically say goodbye to driving a car. The secret service was there to eliminate any kind of threat from the outside world. Driving was apparently one of them. Dinner was going to be up shortly as well. She could say goodbye to Mom's home cooked meals too. Her mother wasn't going to have time to do all of that now that she was the First Lady. She had new responsibilities now. One's she didn't have to worry about when she was the Governor's wife. April honestly thought that being the President's daughter was going to be a lot more fun, but it was the first day and she had a knot in her stomach. She was sprawled out on her bed, just staring up at her pink ceiling. She really did hate that they gave her the pink room. Blue was her favorite color and she was mad Conner got it, but mostly that the secret service played into gender roles. There was a knock on her door, but she didn't have the energy to get up and answer it. After a while, the door opened and Mike poked his head in. \"Dinner's ready.\" He reported. \"Your mom wanted me to get you.\" \"I'm not hungry.\" She spoke, her eyes still fixed on the ceiling, her voice as bland as Mike had ever heard it. Sure, he only knew her for a few hours, but he already knew her so well. \"Come on.\" He spoke in a complaining way. \"This is my first order from the First Lady, I really don't want to not do it.\" She rolled her eyes at how many negatives he used in that sentence. \"Sucks to be you.\" Mike decided that if he was going to deal with someone like this for at least four years, he had to lay down the law now while walking into her room all the way. That made her sit up. \"What are you doing?\" She asked, but he just kept walking toward her. \"Mike?\" She questioned again. That's when he picked her up by her waist, throwing her over his shoulders. \"What the hell?!\" She screamed at him. \"Put me down!\" \"Nope.\" He spoke immediately while carrying her out into the hall. \"Dad!\" She called instinctively. He was always the one she called out for when she was in trouble. Mike finally sighed, knowing he had to put her down so the President and First Lady wouldn't think that he literally dragged her to dinner. When he put her down, she looked to him with wild eyes. \"I think you forget that I could get you fired.\" She spoke with a half laugh even if she was completely serious. \"You wouldn't do that.\" He spoke while shaking his head with a smile growing on his face. April began to smile. This was going to be the best part of living here for her. Her and Mike would be able to do this all day every day, and she needed a new person to have a sass-off with. \"And why wouldn't I?\" He looked around at the place. \"Because you need someone here who can show you all of the hiding places.\" April's face got serious. That was the most exciting thing to hear about moving here. \"Really?\" She asked excitedly. He moved closer to her, wanting to keep her anticipation levels up. \"Only if you tell me what's really going on.\" She took a deep sigh, looking right to Mike. She didn't want to tell anyone what was going on with her in fear that it might somehow get to her dad that she wasn't totally happy here, but she trusted Mike. She couldn't put her finger on it, but there was just something about him that made her trust him over any of the secret service agents around. He was just…different. While studying Mike, she shrugged. \"It's just not all I thought it was cracked up to be.\" He gave her a slight smile, understanding what she was going through. He had seen it before. \"You don't think everyone else is going through the same feeling right now?\" April looked up at him, blinking a couple of times, not thinking about it that way. \"Really?\" He laughed at the way she asked. It was like she was ashamed of her own feelings. He would knock that out of her real quick. \"Yeah, you should have seen your dad earlier. He was on the verge of a panic attack.\" She chuckled a little bit at the thought of her dad actually scared of something. \"He told me the only thing keeping him sane right now is his family.\" She looked up at him, meeting that gaze. Those crystal blue eyes met again and all April could think to do was stare into them. \"I can be strong for my dad.\" She told him with a nod. Mike smiled as he continued to look at her, finding himself doing the same thing April was doing. Looking into her eyes. \"I know you can.\" April began chuckling, thinking of something she had been dying to tell Mike at the right time. \"I think I picked out a good nickname for me.\" He smiled at her, ready to hear what she had picked out. He loved it when they picked out their own nicknames. \"I'm all ears.\" \"Showers.\" She spoke as a simple shrug which made his eyebrows scrunch. He didn't find the connection at all. April bit her lip, looking around before deciding to confide with him about this. \"Promise you won't tell me dad?\" He just looked at her, not totally sure if he was going to keep that promise causing her to roll her eyes. \"Whatever, I'm gonna show you anyway.\" She pulled her Patagonia to the left side, showing a bare shoulder with a storm cloud tattooed on her body near her collar bone. \"I was...inebriated.\" Mike began laughing, hardly believing she did this. \"And it's like April Showers.\" Mike continued to laugh as he leaned forward to touch the tattoo. \"Oh, that's definitely gonna be your code name now.\" He looked back to her as she covered it back up, a thinking look on his face. \"Thunder Showers.\" He spoke with a nod. \"So it still references your troublesome attitude.\" \"Oh.\" She spoke with a joking smile as his just grew bigger while she began walking past him. \"You're not going to let that one go, are you?\" Mike watched her as she walked off, smiling. He had never connected with one of the family members so fast before. She was a great girl and he was going to do everything he could to keep her safe. \"No I am not.\" When April finally got into the dining room, her mother gave her a bright smile. \"We were wondering when you were going to join us.\" She gave her a bit of an eye roll before leaning in for her mother to give her a kiss on the cheek. Mike smiled at the family as soon as April went to sit down, the four of them just falling into this natural conversation as they began serving themselves with the food on the table. Their conversation was filled with laughs and constant joking. They really were happy all together. That was something he knew they didn't have to pretend because it was like they were the only ones in the room. The secret service didn't bother them one bit. As Mike looked back and forth at them, he knew, he was going to get really attached to this family. So with the new movie coming out soon, I thought now would be a good time to put out this idea that has been swimming in my head for a while. I know there's a couple of stories with Ben's daughter having a relationship with Mike so I'm trying to make this story as original and unique as possible so we'll have a couple in the mix. I will try to update as best as I can and will be focusing a lot on April in the first chapters. It will probably take me a while to actually get to the events in the movie considering I'm going to be setting up a base for April and Mike since this will eventually become a Mike/OC story. I hope you all like it and remember to review![Chapter 2] February Mike stood in the Oval Office while Ben was scribbling down things on files he was sent to look over. He was assigned to specifically be with the President all day, but Mike didn't mind. He would prefer to spend some more time with April and Conner, especially with what was happening between the three of them. Suddenly the door opened, April and Conner rushed in, thinking no one else was in there, alerting both Mike and Ben. Once they saw Mike, they immediately stopped what they were doing, getting smiles on their faces. \"What are you two doing?\" Ben asked, looking at each of his children individually. Conner looked to April, that devilish look on his face, matching hers. Mike just looked back at forth at the two, smiling and shaking his head. \"Nothing.\" Conner finally spoke before the two began giggling, making their way out of the room. Mike shook his head at the two, following them to the door. \"Cheaters.\" He spoke, causing them to giggle until they made it out of the room. April stuck her head back into the room while she and Conner were already outside. \"You have a home field advantage.\" He looked to her, April smiling bright right back at him. He then pulled out his watch, measuring how much longer he would be with Ben before going out there, continuing what he had started with the kids. \"You've got a ten minute head start.\" April didn't waste any more time, hurrying out of the room and running down the hallway with her brother. Mike could hear the giggles outside the door making him shake his head. It had only been a few weeks since they had moved in, but Mike was already so attached to these kids. When he was put on their detail, all they did was play. And April, she was fun to be around. \"I see they're taking a liking to you.\" Ben spoke through a laugh, still looking down at those papers. \"Yes sir.\" Mike spoke with a nod before turning back to him. \"Especially April.\" Ben spoke, looking up and Mike quickly before looking back down at his papers. He wanted to see his reaction. \"Yeah.\" Mike spoke with a shrug. \"She's a good kid.\" Ben looked up at him, wondering if there was any tick in his remark. He knew his daughter better than anyone, and he knew when she liked someone before she even did. And she definitely liked Mike. This was starting to become a widely discussed topic between Ben and Margret. Ben couldn't tell if Mike had a reaction or not since he hardly showed any emotions. He was hoping there was something there. Sure, there was an age gap, but he had never seen April look at someone the way she looked at Mike. If anything were to happen between the two, he would most definitely support it. Ben smiled again, looking at Mike, getting an idea. \"Why don't you go ahead and win that prank war you three have got going on?\" Mike looked to Ben, shaking his head, becoming serious again. \"No sir, this is my station right now.\" \"Don't be ridiculous.\" Ben spoke, looking past him to the shut door. \"Hey, Forbes!\" Agent Forbes immediately walked in after that, ready to do whatever the President asked. \"Yes, sir?\" \"Take over for Mike here.\" Ben spoke with the wave of the pen at Mike. Mike just looked at the President incredulously, surprised that he would actually do that. Forbes looked over at Mike, giving him a bit of a smile, knowing exactly what the President was doing. \"Yes, sir.\" Mike's attraction to April was also one of the most talked about subject with the secret service agents. Mike looked back and forth between the two, both of them just having huge smiles on their faces. \"Whatever.\" Mike finally spoke while moving to walk out of the room as Ben and Forbes just continued to laugh at what they had caused. When Mike got out of the Oval Office, he looked down the hallway, smiling slightly at what they were doing for him before hurrying off down where he knew April and Conner would be. He went down the hallway leading to the Lincoln Bedroom, going inside and opening up the secret passage way that laid inside the walls. Once he got in, he realized how quiet it was. Almost too quiet. That's when he was doused with water. He stood there for a moment, taking in what had happened to him. \"Hey, stiff!\" He immediately looked up, seeing April and Conner tucked into the upper part of the walls, looking down on him. \"Oh,\" he spoke, looking back between the two, Conner still laughing at April catching his attention. \"You're both dead.\" \"But your job is to protect us.\" Conner laughed out. April turned to look at him, a fake thought obviously passing through her head. \"Good point, little brother.\" She turned back to look at the fuming Mike. \"What do you think, buddy?\" \"Okay,\" he spoke, pointing at April. \"You're dying first.\" She laughed while reaching behind her, throwing him a dry set of clothes. \"We weren't going to totally screw you out of your job.\" Conner was laughing, causing April to turn to him with an excited smile. \"See you soon, Mike.\" He called before the two disappeared back into the walls, hurrying so Mike wouldn't try to kill them. Mike looked up at where they had retreated, a smile still on his face before shaking his head from how wet his hair got. His wheels were already turning on how to get back at them, and most likely, they weren't going to like it. April woke up that morning in her nice, warm bed with a glint of sunlight peeking through the windows. It was taking a lot of getting used to waking up in the White House, but it was slowly starting to become something normal to her. She sat up in her bed, stretching out, getting ready to get out of bed and fill her already growling tummy. The second she put her foot on the floor, though, she could feel vegetable oil on her bare feet. That's when she looked around, noticing it was covering every inch of her wood floor. As she looked around, she could only think of one culprit. \"Mike!\" She yelled out. That's when Forbes came rushing in at the sound of her yelling, trying to make sure everything was okay, but once he saw the oil in her room, he began laughing. \"Nice one, Mikey.\" He whispered as he inspected the floor. It didn't look like he had missed one spot. \"Go get something I can walk on to get out of here.\" She demanded. With that, he turned around, hurrying out of the room to find something, causing her to look around at her room again. She shrugged at the thought of Mike's amount of planning and determination to pull this one off. \"It was a nice one.\" When April had finally gotten down to the kitchen and the maids were working on cleaning up her room, Mike couldn't help but chuckle at the sight of her. \"How are you doing this morning, April?\" He asked in an overly polite voice, getting her to do a dry laugh back at him. Conner was also giggling, letting her know that her revenge had to work for them both. She quickly grabbed a mug filled with hot water and a tea bag, dunking it in the water, thinking about how she was going to get back at them. When Conner woke up that morning, he felt something tickling his face. At first, he just jerked his head back, thinking it was just a piece of hair in his way. But it continued. He rolled over, hoping it had to deal with the way he was lying down, but it just kept tickling his nose. When he finally put his hand to his face to stop it, he felt a squash. His eyes immediately opened after that, hearing his bedroom door open and close. He sighed, knowing what was on his face was shaving cream and knowing this was one of his big sister's pranks. Both Mike and Conner walked up to April as she sat in the parlor, reading a book. They each looked to each other, knowing this was going to be a tough conversation. \"Hello, April.\" Mike spoke to start it off. She glanced up from the book, looking at each of them before looking right back down at the book. \"Mike,\" She acknowledged. \"Traitor-I-used-to-call-my-brother,\" Conner rolled his eyes at how she acknowledged him before looking back to her. \"How can I assist you?\" Mike nudged Conner, knowing he had to be the one who brought peace about all of this. \"April, we're here to call a truce.\" Her eyes drifted to her brother, quickly marking her place in the book before shutting it with one hand. \"How interesting.\" \"So,\" Mike spoke, while looking back and forth at the two children. \"What do you think?\" \"What would this truce include?\" She asked, her eyes drifting to Mike this time. He was giving her that pleading face, wanting her to take this truce as much as Conner did. \"It would mean a stop to the prank war.\" She looked back and forth at each of them, thinking of what to tell them. She stood up, giving herself some time to think as she put the book back on its shelf. \"I think that with all that has been revealed today, I will hold out on the truce.\" \"Why?\" Conner asked as Mike shut his eyes, groaning out her name. She shrugged as she turned to look back to them. \"Because I'm bored and you both pissed me off.\" Mike looked her up and down, thinking of how scary she looked in that moment. \"So what would you do if you were the President?\" He was starting to get really happy about the fact that her father had one and not her. She would probably plunge the country into war over this. \"So,\" She spoke, moving close to them, taking time looking back and forth. \"I would keep your guard up, boys.\" Conner gulped, terrified of his sister in that moment, but Mike was going to play it cool. He wasn't going to let her know that he was scared of her for as long as she stood in front of him. \"My guard is always up.\" She smiled to Mike, moving even closer to him, knowing he was the one who started all of this. \"We'll see.\" She whispered to him almost seductively. Mike just stared at her, not sure what to think until she lunged at him, making both Conner and Mike flinch back. She laughed as she made her way out of the parlor, leaving the two to think about what had just happened and what kind of threats were going to stand in their way when Mike turned to Conner. He punched him in the arm, slightly, making Conner grab his now aching arm. \"Ow!\" He yelled at him, giving him an annoyed look. Mike just pointed at him. \"That's for not telling me your sister is crazy.\" \"She's crazy.\" Conner spoke in a bland tone, making Mike mock him, causing Conner to roll his eyes and begin to walk off. Mike looked back to where she was standing in front of him just a second ago, letting a shiver run down his spine. She was actually really scary when she wanted to be. That's what scared Mike the most about her. She didn't even need secret service around her, she could take care of herself. He was just scared for how she was going to take care of herself by getting revenge on him and Conner. Mike spent the rest of that day walking around the White House with much precautions. Not just for himself, but for his entire staff. April had become relentless with this pranking war. He knew she was just bored and needed something to do, but wow, she was taking this really far. Mike looked around the corner, on high \"April watch\". Things around the place had gotten quiet. Too quiet. \"This girl needs to start school already.\" He spoke while shaking his head at the fact that this is what she had chosen to do with her free time. That's when he saw April come out of her room, walking down the hallway so casually like nothing had ever happened. Mike watched her, expecting something, but she just kept walking. She smiled once she noticed him. \"Hey, Mike.\" Once she walked past him, it drove him crazy, he spun around quick, finding it hard to believe that was it. \"Are you kidding me right now?\" He spoke loud, making her stop and turn around. Her eyebrows knitted together in confusion as she moved back to him, confused with what he was bringing up. \"What are you talking about?\" He blinked a couple times at her. Did she forget everything she promised would happen to him a few hours ago? \"You're kidding, right?\" She shook her head at him like she had no idea what he was talking about. \"I'm not kidding, I don't know what you're talking about.\" Mike opened his mouth, about to protest with her when he realized what she was doing. \"You're trying to do psychological warfare now. Trying to get inside my head, that's all.\" She sighed before shaking her head at him. \"Yeah, sure, that's what I'm trying to do, so, can I go now I have to do some stuff.\" Mike laughed as he shook his head at her. \"I'm sure you do.\" She sighed again, adding an eye roll this time. \"Bye, Mike.\" He just continued to watch her as she continued her walk down the hallway. \"She's going to kill me.\" He whispered. When he turned around, though, he saw all the artwork from the wall was gone, nowhere in sight. He looked back to where she had walked off, seeing no sight of her or the art. \"APRIL!\" April got a big smile, letting out a little laugh, picking up her pace slightly at the sound of her newest prank working perfectly. They were all at the breakfast table the next morning and when April reached for the syrup, Conner jumped, thinking back on her threat. She gave him an annoyed look at his fear before throwing some syrup on her pancakes. Maggie was looking back and forth at the two with a confused face. \"What's going on with you two?\" \"Nothing.\" April answered while Conner said, \"Everything.\" She turned to look at Conner, giving him a death stare at the thought of how her mother would act if she found out about how far their prank war had gotten. \"What is going on?\" Maggie asked in a more forceful voice, hoping to get the truth out of that one. Neither of them said anything, just looking down at their breakfast in silence. \"Is it this prank war?\" She finally concluded. They both looked up, April shaking her head as Conner nodded. \"Look,\" she spoke, her voice even more forceful than before. \"You two need to stop this thing before it gets out of hand.\" April and Conner looked to each other, knowing she was right, but neither of them were going to back down first and they both knew Mike wouldn't. After breakfast, Conner met Mike in the walls, the both of them looking over their prank plan they had developed last night. Mike let out a loud yawn, causing Conner to look to him with a confused face. He was never tired. \"Sorry.\" He spoke while shaking his head, thinking back on why he was so tried. \"I was up all night trying to find those paintings your sister took. She's an expert hider.\" \"Okay,\" Conner spoke as he looked back to plan, not really caring about what Mike had to say in that moment. This was all about getting April back from everything she did to them. \"We're going to infiltrate her when she's her most vulnerable.\" \"Which is?\" Mike asked. \"When she's putting her makeup on in the morning.\" His head went from side to side, seeing how that was her most vulnerable before looking back to Conner for the rest of the plan. \"If we mess up her face, it will end it all.\" \"Or she'll go on an even bigger rampage.\" Mike spoke in a kind of monotone, thinking of the worst case scenario here. \"Don't hate the plan.\" Conner told him immediately, looking him right in the eye. \"I'm not.\" He spoke as he moved his hand to the drawn out plan to point at something. \"I just think – \" He was immediately cut off by Conner slapping his hand away from it. \"Don't touch the plan.\" All Mike could do was look at the kid. Damn, they were both brave as hell. The morning of the prank that would end it all was here, and there April was putting on her makeup in the tall mirror. She was just sitting in front of it on the carpet, studying her face with her entire arsenal of eyeliners, lipsticks and eyeshadows surrounded her. She leaned in close, putting all of her concentration on making her eyeliner as straight as possible when there was a loud knock on her door. \"April!\" Conner called from outside her door. She jumped slightly, and once she made sure the jump hadn't messed up her liner, she looked to the door with an annoyed stare at what it could have caused. \"What?!\" \"Mom wants you in the kitchen!\" He called. She sighed, looking to the door for a moment before deciding to go back to her eyeliner. The pencil was close to her face when there was another loud knock on her door, making her jump again. \"Conner!\" She called as she stood up from where she was, hurrying to the door. \"I swear to god – \" She was cut off the second she opened the door because a pie was thrown in her face. She stood there for a moment in full shock. And then when the pan fell off of her face, she caught sight of Conner through the whipped cream. \"I am,\" She spoke as slowly as possible. \"Going to kill you!\" She chased after him, all the way into the kitchen where she found multiple pies around. April picked one up as soon as he turned around, throwing it, letting it hit his back, sending him to the ground. \"Hey!\" He yelled. That's when Mike came out of what seemed like nowhere and threw another pie into April's face, holding her up by her back so she wouldn't fall over from the impact. Right when Mike pulled the pie pan off of her face, she look at all the pies surrounding the kitchen, picking up the closest one, about to throw it in Mike's face, but they were all stopped when they heard Maggie yell, \"What is going on in here?!\" Fear froze all of their bodies as their blood ran cold. All they could do was stand there because they each knew they were going to get in so much trouble. \"April,\" Maggie spoke like it was obvious. \"If you're going to really throw it in his face then you need to bring your right foot back and slam it in his face.\" Conner and April began to laugh as they both looked to Mike, April following her mother's instructions. April looked to Mike, shrugging as he did. \"Just hurry up and get it over with.\" He spoke, cringing slightly, waiting for it. \"You know what,\" April spoke as she brought the pie down, Mike and Conner both looking to her shocked, this was honestly the last thing they expected. \"I'm a mature lady and I don't need to throw this pie in your face to get even with you.\" \"Really?\" He asked. Without missing a beat, she threw the pie in his face as forcefully as she could, letting the pan fall to the ground itself. She brushed off her hands as Maggie and Conner both laughed at what had just happened. \"No.\" She spoke, looking down to look right into his face as he tried to get whipped cream out of his eyes. \"Not really.\" \"You're dead.\" Mike spoke. \"Oh,\" April spoke, getting closer to him. \"What was that? I couldn't hear you through all the whipped cream.\" That's when another pie entered her face by her mother. They all stood there for a moment, realizing what was about to happen. They were all going to have a full fledged food fight. Then, in the next second, pies were flying across the room, hitting every inch of the kitchen and every part of their bodies. April began slipping on the floor from all the whipped cream as Mike grabbed her by the waist, making her laugh while they both eased each other to the ground. Through all the laughter and commotion, they couldn't even hear Ben walk into the room, barely missing a pie to the face from an off throw. \"What the hell is going on in here?!\" They all stopped with the same fear on their faces as earlier. He wasn't going to be as soft as Maggie was about the situation, making each of them even more nervous than before. \"Prank war.\" Conner spoke slowly as they all smiled back, hoping he would go easy on them. He didn't go easy on them. They had to clean the entire kitchen spotless, but it was easier since there were four of them working together to get it done. By the time night had fallen, everyone was showered, all the whipped cream was finally out of everyone's hair. Mike had decided on walking April to her room for the night, the two of them continuing to laugh at the events that unfolded the past few days. They were both glad they could actually talk again instead of being at war. April was wearing her fuzzy star robe with a tank top and pajama shorts underneath, still slightly wet from her shower earlier. It was rare that people got to see her like this, but she was so comfortable around Mike, it didn't even phase her. \"So, is the truce still up for grabs?\" She asked, bumping into Mike softly as they walked. He laughed with a nod. \"Conner and I would love it if our kingdoms could be at peace again.\" The two of them stopped in front of her bedroom door, just looking at each other for a moment, those smiles still on their faces. \"You know, even if we spent hours cleaning up the kitchen because of all of this, I have to say the prank war was very fun.\" \"And you've learned all the hiding spots and learned how to clean an entire kitchen from floor to ceiling.\" April laughed slightly before looking to her bedroom door. \"I'm really tired.\" \"I bet you are from that swing you took on my face.\" She nodded, impressed with herself, thinking of it all over again. It was probably the highlight of her week. \"It was a really good swing.\" Mike shook his head at her, finding himself looking into her eyes again. \"Goodnight, April.\" She nodded, putting her hand on his forearm, giving him a goodnight squeeze. \"Goodnight, Mike.\" With that, she went into her room while Mike spent the night patrolling the halls. And while he was patrolling the halls, he noticed that back up was the one painting he couldn't find. He couldn't help but wonder where the hell April had hidden it so well that even he couldn't find it. Mrs. HappyAnarchy: Thanks for being my first review and follower!

Since she wasn't having a night with Mike, she was going to have a night with the girls. \"Yeah, well this is what puts food on our table and a roof over our heads.\" \"Yeah.\" She spoke coming back into the room from their closet. \"I know.\" That's when he got up, going straight for her. \"Then stop complaining.\" \"Shut up.\" She mocked as he leaned in to kiss her. After their lips parted, her arms went around his neck as his went around her waist. \"After I get back from the party and you get back from girl's night, we should have our own celebration.\" He moved to her neck, kissing and nibbling on it, causing her to let out a bubbly laugh before looking down at her watch. \"You have to leave now if you're going to be your usual five minutes early.\" \"You're right.\" He grumbled while pulling away from her, giving her a quick kiss before heading out the door. \"I love you.\" He called before walking out. \"I love you too.\" She called just as the door shut and she was left there to think about which earring she should be wearing tonight. April smoothed out her dress in the mirror with an annoyed look on her face. \"A fundraiser on Valentine's Day?\" She groaned as she looked at her mother who was still lacing her dress up in the back. \"What a great reminder that I am completely and utterly alone?\" Her Dad looked to her in the mirror while fixing Conner's tux. \"You don't need a man to keep you happy.\" She groaned again. She loved her dad a lot, but he had to bring this up every time she complained about a guy or lack of. \"I got it, Dad. The first twelve times you've told me.\" \"Well,\" Maggie spoke as she moved a loose stand out of April's face. \"He is right.\" April turned to her mother, shaking her head. \"You're supposed to be on my side.\" Maggie started laughing as Ben and Conner walked up to the ladies. Ben put his arm around Maggie's waist, making April shake her head more, still disappointed about her mother not being on her side. \"When did this union happen?\" Maggie and Ben looked to each other, those fake thinking faces on. \"Twenty-three years?\" He questioned while looking to his wife. She looked up, doing mental math. \"Yeah, this year it will be twenty-three.\" That's when they leaned forward and gave each other a loving kiss that Conner and April pretended a gag to. \"Ugh, let's get out of here, Conner.\" She spoke as she pushed him forward. Ben and Maggie pulled apart, still smiling at each other as she shrugged. \"Works every time.\" Right as April pulled open the door to get out, Mike was standing there, about to turn the doorknob. \"Well,\" April sang out. \"Hello, Michael.\" He rolled his eyes at her while moving past her to get to the president. \"Why is your name so short?\" He complained, not finding anything to make her name sound longer than it really was. April smiled to herself before turning around to see Mike begin to lead Ben and Maggie out the door, April and Conner falling in line behind their parents. Once they got out the door, Forbes was the caboose in the line, all of them making their way outside and into the cars. Mike was in the limo with the family along with Forbes, the six of them making conversation the entire ride there. During that time, April leaned forward, finding herself right in Mike's ear. \"You don't have anything better to do on Valentine's Day?\" He smirked as he turned to look at her. \"You would be bored out of your mind if I wasn't coming to this thing with you.\" April faked a sigh with a dramatic look out the window. \"True.\" He was looking all around, measuring potential threats always. He could be fully engaged in a conversation, but he also knew how to make an escape plan if needed to. It fascinated her. \"What do see and hear that everyone else doesn't?\" He looked back to her, those eyes meeting each other again. That insane spark everyone but them noticed. \"Possible threats.\" The car slowed to a stop as soon as they got there, but Mike and April just wouldn't take their eyes off of each other. He leaned in close to her like she did to him, whispering, \"We're here.\" April gave him a bit of a smile as he opened up the doors, Ben and Maggie going out first and then April and Conner. Sure, it had only been a month since they had moved into the White House and her father had become president, but she knew, just like her mother, that Ben was the most important thing to them. And if it came down to it, they would save him over them in a blink of an eye. That's why he was always the first to get escorted out. April, she always made sure she was behind Conner for that reason. She would rather it be her than him any other day. Inside, the ballroom was decorated with hearts, red and pink. April shuttered at the thought of her pink bedroom again. She really had to redecorate. Could you even redecorate the White House? Well, she was going to do it anyway. As she looked around the room, she knew this was going to be one of the worst nights of her life. It was going to be a bunch of smiling politicians all in line to meet her (mostly scheduled by her father) and that, she was not thrilled for. She continued to look around while her father was shaking hands and smiling, looking for the one person she lost sight of through all of this. Then, at the corner of the room, she saw him. She looked back to her dad, planning out the perfect time to make a getaway, and she made it through without being spotted by anyone else. When she made it by Mike's side, he didn't look at her, he just kept looking around the room, analyzing any sort of threat. \"I need a drink.\" She told him. His eyebrows furrowed slightly. \"Aren't you eighteen?\" She scoffed as he finally made eye contact with her. \"Yeah, and I also have a tattoo of a storm cloud on my shoulder that no one knows about. I think we all know April has had a few drinks in her life.\" Mike smiled a little bit while looking straight forward, thinking about the tattoo all over again. It was pretty lame. \"Shouldn't you be meeting politicians, kissing babies, that sort of stuff?\" \"Yeah,\" She spoke before picking up a glass of champagne off of one of the waiters trays. \"Something like that.\" Mike turned to her with a challenging face. \"What the hell are you doing?\" \"I won't tell if you won't.\" She spoke in that same almost seductive voice. Right as she was about to take a drink of it, he pulled it out of her hands and set it on another waiter's tray. Her mouth dropped from shock and anger at what he had just done to her. \"You'll thank me later when your mother and father don't kill you .\" \"April,\" she suddenly heard her father call. She shut her eyes, knowing he was going to find her eventually. \"Go.\" Mike whispered as he pushed her toward her father. \"Meet politicians, kiss babies, that sort of thing.\" She turned back to him, giving him a threatening stare despite that smirk on her face as Mike returned a cocky smile. When April had turned around, she was shocked this was the first politician she was meeting, and it was not what she expected. He was…cute. \"April, I would like you to meet William Guthrie, the current youngest member of the House of Representatives.\" \"Wow,\" she exhaled quickly while immediately sticking her hand out to shake his. \"Hi.\" He chuckled slightly, shaking her hand while Mike gave them both a weird glance. April was acting weird. Really weird. She was giddy. Playing with her hair. Laughing too loud. That's when it all hit him. She had a crush on this guy. Mike's mouth dropped, a smile on his face as he watched closer, folding his arms in almost disbelief, never seeing this side of her before. \"I'm April Asher.\" She introduced. That's when she shut her eyes, shaking her head. \"But you already knew that.\" That's when it sounded off to April, causing her to open her eyes again. \"Not like you should know that.\" She began to laugh, her hand still gripping his in that handshake that seemed to start so long ago. \"I'm not one of those girls. I'm just saying that because my father introduced us so he must have already talked to you about me.\" That sounded even more wrong. \"Not like he had to or anything. I didn't ask him to. I – \" \"Oh my god.\" Mike whispered out, taking his all not to laugh at how much of a fool she was making of herself. That's when she realized she was still shaking his hand. She looked into his eyes, noticing how scared he looked from all the talking she was doing. \"Oh my god.\" She muttered before letting go of his hand and turning away, retreating back to Mike who was laughing at her. She gave him an annoyed look, but his laughing just continued. He grabbed a glass of champagne from the waiter, handing it to her. \"Okay, I think you deserve this.\" She downed it as fast as possible, putting the empty glass on another tray of one of the waiters walking by. \"I think you should have just stopped at 'I'm April Asher'.\" She gave him a fake laugh, making Mike laugh even more. \"Ugh, I sounded like a complete idiot.\" She spoke before throwing her face in her hands. \"He could take it as cute.\" Mike spoke with a shrug. \"Because it kind of was.\" April turned back to him with an eye roll. \"Yeah, the guys who find that cute are guys who love to fuck dumb bimbos like a monkey.\" \"Well, I must be one of those.\" They both turned at the sudden interruption of their conversation, noticing William was right there, his eyes on April. \"Because I thought you were damn cute back there.\" He shook his head, his eyes studying her entire body. \"Definitely not a dumb bimbo, more like a smart, awkward hot girl.\" Mike and April both turned to look back at each other, Mike giving her a knowing stare at the fact that he was right. \"So,\" William spoke again, putting a hand out for her to grab. \"Would you like to dance?\" April just stood there, just kind of stuck there. \"She would love to.\" Mike answered for her causing her to give him a dirty look as he pushed her forward. He just gave her an impressed face as William led her to the dance floor at the fact that he was into her and he wasn't bad looking. Once they had gotten into a dancing position, William looked into April's eyes, that dark brown clashing with that bright blue. \"Are you always that awkward?\" He asked as a joke, making her laugh instantly. She looked back up at him, finding herself a lot calmer than she was a minute ago. \"Only when I see a very hot, very impressive guy for the first time.\" He shook his head while looking down, obviously embarrassed by what she had said about him. \"Well, I am twenty-five and a member of the House of Representatives.\" \"Don't brag.\" She accused in a mocking tone. He did a light chuckle to that, obviously not finding it that funny. Mike would have found it funny, she thought to herself. Conner came up to Mike as April and William kept talking during their dance. Mike's eyes were trained on what was happening between the two. He was inspecting every bit of movement, keeping mental notes on what to warn April about this guy, but so far, he found nothing wrong with him just by his look. \"What are you doing?\" Conner asked, finally taking Mike out of watching the two. \"What?\" He asked quick, looking to Conner, but then finally processed what he had said earlier. \"I'm just watching April.\" He eventually turned to look back at the two, but Conner just continued to stand there, studying him. \"Why are you watching her?\" He asked, glancing quick at April before looking back to Mike, the confusion still on his face. \"You know.\" Mike spoke with a shrug, not really coming up with a good answer, eyes still locked on what was going on with April. She was laughing at something William was saying, making Mike very, very nervous. \"What?\" Conner asked, completely confused with what he was saying. \"What?\" Mike spoke, looking back to him, not remembering at all what they were talking about. That's when Conner looked back to April, noticing she was pulling William away and off the dance floor. \"Do you have a crush on April?\" Conner finally asked with a knowing smile while turning back to look to Mike. \"What?\" Mike asked with a bit of a laugh, but when he looked back to the dance floor and he couldn't find her, he looked slightly panicked. He didn't know where she was or what she was doing in that moment. \"It's my job to make sure she's safe.\" Mike explained quickly, still looking all around for her. \"That's what I'm doing.\" Conner just continued to look at Mike. It was bullshit. He knew it as much as Mike did, but he was going to let him have it. Especially with how shaken up he was being over April. \"I'm gonna go get dessert.\" Conner said before walking off with a smile on his face at what was still happening. \"Yeah, you do that.\" Mike spoke, finally catching sight of April and keeping his eyes on her. That was about the time Maggie had noticed the look on Mike's face when she and Ben were dancing. \"Babe,\" she spoke as she excitedly hit his shoulder. \"Look.\" Ben looked out to see Mike's concerned, focused face on April while she was laughing and talking with William at the bar. \"Oh.\" Ben spoke in a slightly excited voice before looking back to Maggie. \"This just got interesting.\" She nodded to him excitedly before looking back to them. April moved the sponge around her face one last time before looking at herself in the mirror. She was wearing a light blue tank top dress with a white cardigan. She was looking around her room like a crazy woman, trying to get everything she needed while her mother just sat on her bed. \"April,\" Maggie spoke in a soothing voice. \"You need to calm down.\" \"Calm down?\" She asked her while pacing around her room. \"This guy is amazing and successful and I'm just some loser who he's probably using to get closer to Dad and…\" she finally just threw herself down on the bed, becoming just a big ball of anxiety. \"Ugh!\" Her mother began to pet her hair, wishing she could let her know how amazing she was. But this was April. She would never look at herself like that. She was just like her father in that sense. \"Honey,\" her mom spoke. \"You can't let that thought stop you from making connections with people.\" April rolled over, her head now on her mother's lap, looking up at her. \"How do you do it?\" She asked in almost wonderment. \"How have you stayed this sane through it all?\" Maggie continued to run her fingers through her daughter's hair, just transfixed on her. \"I have you and your brother to think about. That's how.\" April smiled as Maggie leaned down to give her daughter a kiss on the forehead before making her stand up. \"Come on,\" she said enthusiastically while gripping onto her hands. \"Let's pick out your shoes.\" Mike stood with the President in the Oval Office, knowing that the kid who was talking out April was going to be in here soon to talk to Ben about how they were spending the night. Mike most definitely wanted to be there for that. And he was going on the date whether she liked it or not. That's when William stepped in. He obviously looked nervous, but walked right up to Ben and Mike. \"Nice to see you, Mr. President.\" He spoke with a polite nod. \"Nice to see you too, William.\" He greeted. William looked over to see Mike, knowing automatically that he was secret service and he was going to be a hard one to get by. \"Nice to meet you.\" He spoke with an extended hand. \"William Guthrie.\" Mike looked him over for a second before sticking his hand out to shake his. \"Mike Banning.\" He didn't want to lie, so he wasn't going to say it was nice to meet him which was acceptable because he was secret service and they didn't necessarily have to show emotions. \"So,\" Ben spoke, putting on his \"President\" voice. \"What do you two have planned tonight?\" \"Dinner.\" William spoke with a nod, not wanting to sound too eager, but excited enough to be taking his daughter out on a date. \"And then a movie.\" Mike rolled his eyes slightly at how cliché this date was. \"Sounds nice.\" Ben spoke while clapping a hand on his shoulder. \"I'm just going to warn you that there's going to be a few members of secret service tailing you on this date. So, don't try anything stupid.\" \"I would never, sir.\" He spoke in almost a frightened voice. Mike rolled his eyes again while looking to William. He was just too polite. Something was up with him. He just couldn't put his finger on it. \"Then you two have a good night.\" Mike looked over to Ben like he was insane. That was it? No big speech about how he would kill him if he hurt her? Well if Ben wasn't going to do it, Mike was. Mike wanted William to be scared of him because if he hurt April in any way shape or form, he was going to literally kill him. He was about to pull William aside when April walked in with an excited face. All Mike could do was look at her. She was slowly dying her hair to a darker color, making those eyes stand out even more than before. And that dress, really brought out those eyes. She and William talked for a little bit before April looked to her father and Mike. \"I'll be home by twelve.\" \"Not any later.\" Ben spoke while pointing to her before she leaned in to give him a kiss on the cheek. \"Twelve?\" Mike whispered to himself. Together, they both walked out of the Oval Office, leaving Mike to just continue to stand there dumbfounded. \"Sir,\" Mike began while turning around to look at him. \"Are you – \" \"Mike,\" Ben spoke in a tired voice, knowing exactly what he was going to ask. \"I know what I'm doing, especially with April.\" He laughed at how stressed out he looked. \"You'll understand when you have your own kids.\" Mike chuckled a little bit at the thought before looking back to the door. He hated this. He hated all of this. \"I better get down – \" \"You're not assigned to be with April tonight.\" That took Mike completely off guard. He had to be with her. Especially tonight. \"But sir – \" \"Banning,\" Ben spoke in the calmest tone he could at this point with Mike. \"Go home. Go to your wife. Everything will be all back to normal in the morning.\" \"If I can sir,\" Mike began, making Ben sigh out of almost annoyance. \"I would like to stay for just a bit longer.\" Ben let out another long sigh. \"Just until April comes back. It would make me feel more at ease.\" Ben just stared at him for a moment. He should call himself lucky for having someone he cared that much about his family, but like his wife said, he was doing this because he loved April. \"Fine.\" Ben breathed out. \"But I'm going to bed.\" Mike laughed while giving him a nod, knowing it was understandable. \"Goodnight, sir.\" \"Goodnight.\" He spoke before walking out of the office. The second he did, though, he thought of something. He poked his head back in, giving Mike a serious look. \"Let me know what time she gets home.\" Mike just chuckled, giving him another nod. \"Will do, sir.\" April walked through the halls of her house, thinking back on the night, her lips still tingling from that goodnight kiss. Her shoes were in her hand, knowing her feet were going to be aching in the morning from all that dancing they did. She really didn't care, though. It was an amazing date. She kept thinking on it until she realized that Mike was lounged on a chair in front of her bedroom door. She looked at him for a moment, noticing his eyes were moving. He was in REM. That's how deep of a sleep he was in. She suddenly went forward to kick his foot, knowing if she was going to get into her bedroom and sleep, she had to wake him up. \"Mike!\" She whisper yelled to him. He jumped up, going straight to his gun and she put her hands up in a mock defense. \"Take it easy now ex special ops.\" \"April?\" He spoke in a tired voice while stretching out. \"Yeah.\" She spoke obviously. \"I kind of live here.\" He then looked to his watch, seeing that the time was 11:59 before looking back up to April. \"You're cutting it a little close.\" \"I said by twelve.\" She spoke with a shrug. \"I'm gonna spend as much time as I can out.\" Mike laughed as he looked up at her. \"So, how was it?\" That smile grew on her face again, shrugging at the thought of it, not totally sure she wanted to share this information with Mike. \"It was good for a first date.\" \"With that blush on your face, you're gonna tell me the date was just good?\" She then gave him an annoyed look. \"You're not even supposed to be working tonight. What are you doing here?\" He looked to her with a tired face, giving her a bit of a smile. \"I stayed here,\" he spoke as he got up. \"To make sure you got home okay.\" \"Aw,\" she spoke in a fake voice, throwing her hand on his arm. \"How sweet.\" \"Yeah, well, I'm leaving now.\" He quickly moved out of her slight embrace like he didn't even want to feel, making her roll her eyes. \"Good.\" April spoke, turning around to look at him. \"Go home to your wife and get some sleep for your shift tomorrow.\" He rolled his eyes at her with a smile before turning down the hallway, waving to her before she opened the door to her room. \"Night, April!\" She smiled as she watched him continue to walk down the hall, thinking about him making it home okay like he thought of her making it home okay all night. \"Goodnight, Mike.\" She whispered almost just to herself. She finally opened the door to her room, quickly getting herself ready for bed. When she finally laid herself down, she remembered how great her date was. The only thing she could think of, though was the fact that Mike stayed there until she got home. And that's what she fell asleep thinking of. Mike. Mrs. HappyAnarchy: Hehehe glad you liked it and the prank war. April is a tricky one, that's for sure :) FizzWizz2011: I will *fakes solute* MicoleR85: So glad you like it! Thanks so much for reading, love! So, I went to go see London Has Fallen today and it was so good! You all have to go see it! Anyways, I hope you all enjoyed this chapter and remember to review what you like about the story and what you want to see happen with April and Mike! Until next time![Chapter 4] March 31 st William was on the couch with April's legs sprawled out on him as his thumb traced her bare thigh from the shorts she was wearing. She peeked behind her crossword puzzle, looking right to William. \"What's the name of the manager for the Cardinals?\" His eyes drifted up, thinking for a moment before looking back to her. \"Mike Matheny?\" he spoke in an almost guess. With that, she looked back to the puzzle, counting the spaces before looking to him with a smile. \"It fits.\" He leaned forward and gave her a sweet kiss which April couldn't help but lean into. As soon as their kiss began to turn passionate, they felt someone push their lips apart. Then their bodies. When they opened their eyes, they saw that Mike had forced his way between the two and was now sitting on the couch between them. April rolled her eyes as he looked back and forth between the two with a big smile. \"And what would your father say if he walked downstairs and saw this?\" \"But you found us and he didn't.\" April countered with a big, cheesy smile. He just rolled his eyes at her before turning to look at William, looking him up and down unimpressed. Mike didn't like William from the beginning. He didn't know what it was about him, but he just didn't like him. They had been dating for over a month and he thought his distaste for him might change, but he still hated having the kid around all the time. \"Yeah,\" Mike spoke, looking straight forward again while straightening out his jacket. \"Well, I may not be the best person to find you two like that either.\" William didn't have much of a liking for Mike either. It was how close he was to her. William wasn't as close to April as Mike was, and for that, he found himself jealous. Even if William was her boyfriend, he still felt second place to Mike. And tonight, when she got her present from him, he was going to talk to her about it. \"There's my birthday girl!\" Ben called from the steps, making April roll her eyes slightly with a big smile on her face. He would always say that to her. Every birthday. \"Thanks, Dad.\" She called out as he met her in a hug as she stood up. Ben honestly couldn't believe his little girl was turning nineteen today. He felt like it was the other day that she was walking around in diapers. Now, she was in her last year as a teenager. Next year at this time, she would be a full fledged adult. That was one thing he wasn't sure how to deal with. When they pulled out of the hug, he put his hands to her face, causing her to squint her eyes at him from how big her smile had gotten. He then moved out of the way for Maggie to give her a huge hug like her father had. Maggie was the one who was more at ease with her daughter growing up. April had kind of always been a grown up. That's why it was so much easier. She only had to watch a little bit of the kid in her disappear. \"Happy birthday.\" She whispered in her ear. \"Thank you.\" She spoke before breaking away in the hug. Then Conner looked at her, hating that he was in this monkey suit because of her birthday. \"Happy birthday.\" he sighed out. \"Wow.\" April spoke in a sarcastic voice while ruffling his hair. \"Thanks, kid.\" That made him stick his tongue out at her which she just did right back. \"Okay,\" Mike began, putting his hand on her shoulder to guide her out. \"If we let this start, we're gonna be here all night.\" \"True.\" Ben spoke in agreeance with Maggie before grabbing her hand and leading her out. As they began to walk outside, Ben turned his head back to his daughter. \"April,\" she looked to him immediately, ready for what he had to say. \"We'll take William in our limo, there's something special in yours for you.\" She gave a confused look to William, but he just shrugged. He honestly had no idea what her secret surprise was. When she looked back to Mike, though, he had a knowing smile on his face. \"What do you have up your sleeve?\" She whispered to him. \"You'll see.\" He whispered back to her, that devious smile still the same as the one from the first moment they had ever met. She simply rolled her eyes at him as he opened the door and she ducked her head in. Once she finally got in the limo, she saw what her surprise was and she had never been happier. \"Surprise!\" her best friends all spoke as one. April looked over to Mike, amazement in her eyes as he just shrugged, looking to the driver with that know-it-all smile on his face. \"We're all good back here.\" April began greeting all of the friends she left back in Pennsylvania, all of them talking about what they had been up to since April had left back in January. Somewhere, along the line, the girls got lost in conversation, giving April the perfect time to turn to look at Mike. She studied him be his usual self, look at everything, measure possible threats, but she just couldn't stop smiling at him. \"How?\" He looked to her, obviously taken off guard by that question. His eyebrows furrowed together, only making April smile even more. \"What?\" He asked for clarification. She leaned closer to him, looking to the girls, making sure they were still lost in conversation. \"How did you get them all here?\" He looked to the girls, shaking his head with a smile before looking back to April. \"Don't look at me. This was your father's gift.\" April scoffed as she looked to him, shaking her head in defiance. \"No, I didn't tell my father that what I wanted more than anything for my birthday was a night with all of my friends.\" He looked to her, smiling, wishing she wouldn't have caught on, but at the same time glad she did. \"I told you that.\" Mike sighed, looking out the window for a moment before looking back to her. \"Well, if your father asked, this is his present to you.\" April leaned closer to him, so close she could smell his cologne and he, her perfume. \"Our secret.\" She whispered. He turned to look at her, and for a moment, they were both intoxicated by their smells. Suddenly, the car slowed to a stop, tearing them out of their moment. \"We're here.\" Mike spoke, looking almost bashful which made April's smile just get bigger. She loved fucking with him. One of the worst things April had realized quickly about being the first family was that they couldn't go anywhere secretly. A birthday dinner being a prime example. Paparazzi lined the walkway into the restaurant as they tried to make their way through. April was trailing behind everyone with Mike. April was smiling to everyone, but then Mike pulled her into his chest at the close quarters they were experiencing. April still kept her smile though, moving to fix her earring as Mike leaned into her, whispering, \"Stay center, don't venture to the sides. They can pull you in.\" She nodded and Mike pulled away from her with a smile as they continued to walk through the crowd. When they eventually got into the restaurant, it was a lot calmer. Less of a Secret Service nightmare. April was having fun and she was safe, that's all that mattered to the agents tonight. She was all that mattered tonight. The girls stayed up all night and danced, but after April went home, William joined her. That was the night of their first time. That was her big birthday present from him. After it was done, the two laid in the bed together, experiencing the wonderful feeling of pillow talk. \"Hey.\" William whispered to her, causing her to look up at him with sleepy eyes. \"Can I talk to you about something?\" Her eyes got a little brighter, nodding, making William suddenly feel guilty for what he was about to ask her. \"It's about Mike.\" She shut her eyes, almost like the name calmed her, making William get scared again. She snuggled into his chest, taking a deep relaxing breath. \"What about Mike?\" \"I think,\" William spoke cautiously. \"He shouldn't be on your security detail as much.\" That made April immediately open her eyes. She couldn't believe what she was hearing in the moment. She slowly looked up at him, more accusing this time. \"Why?\" William began to laugh, finding it hard to believe that he actually had to explain why he wanted him off her security detail. \"He's inappropriate,\" he spoke, getting ready to list things off. \"He is always getting in-between us, he – \" \"If it wasn't for Mike,\" April began to speak, sitting up in bed now, William following her. \"I would be dead.\" \"What has he done for you?\" William spoke, his voice raising. \"What big threat have you been in that he's protected you from?!\" When April didn't say anything, William just nodded. \"He hasn't done anything for you, April. I don't understand why you need him so much.\" \"Because!\" She yelled, not finding a legitimate answer for herself either. She honestly didn't know why she was defending Mike so much. Maybe it was the fact that it was coming from William. Or the fact that from day one, he had been her favorite agent. They had a bond. She couldn't explain it. She was sure no one could. \"Because you love him?!\" William finally asked, that question digging in the back of his head like a shard of glass for the past two months. April opened her mouth, not sure what to say to that. She couldn't love him. That was impossible. But there was something. \"April,\" William spoke slowly, moving his hand to grab hers. \"I can't be with you if Mike is in your life like the way he is.\" April sat there for a moment, knowing she had to make a very hard decision. Mike off of he security detail would give her William. With William, she couldn't have Mike. \"April?\" William asked, bringing her back from thought. He didn't expect her to take this long to answer. He thought it would be easy for her to choose. Now he was seeing how much Mike had really meant to her. April's blue eyes met William's haunted green. After looking in those eyes, she knew her answer. She would rather have those crystal blues than the mysterious green. \"I choose Mike.\" Hurt simply passed over William's face before the anger kicked in. \"You know,\" he almost spat out. \"I thought you would be smart enough to actually make the right decision.\" \"William,\" She was genuinely shocked at his outburst while he got up from her bed. \"I hope you know that the only reason that I started going out with you was to get close to your dad. To try to rise up in the political ladder.\" April could feel her eyes begin to water as he talked while he put on his clothes. \"And then I started to really like you.\" He shook his head while moving to her door. \"What a fucking mistake.\" He mumbled just before slamming the door shut. All April could do was sit there for a moment and let it all sink in. She couldn't believe what had just happened. She couldn't believe she actually fell for someone like that. And she couldn't help but think that she lost him because of Mike. All she wanted to do was be comforted by him, but at the same time, she hated him. She didn't want to talk to him, but he was the only one that she could talk to. \"Miss. Asher?\" A voice came from the other side of the door followed by a knock. She let out a deep breath, knowing they must have seen William storm out. He was probably pulling his car out right now, but she didn't have the voice to speak at the moment. It was like the wind had been knocked out of her. The words couldn't even form on her mouth. The door opened even if she said nothing. She knew that they would come in. Her safety was the biggest priority. She was honestly surprised she had snuck William in there. She wasn't really watching, but she knew it was Roma. He was in front of her room last time she had seen him. \"April?\" he asked slowly, never seeing her that quiet before. \"Is everything okay? What was all of that about?\" She finally looked up at him, taking a deep breath, fully prepared to tell him everything that happened, but as soon as she opened her mouth to talk, gasps came out as tears fell down her eyes. Roma felt so bad that she sat in front of him crying for something he didn't know about. He slowly closed the door behind him before sitting on the bed with April, holding her hand while she cried out all she could with her head resting on his shoulder. Breakfast was being set on the table as everyone crowded around. Conner was excitedly telling Ben about the newest episode of his favorite TV show, but Maggie had noticed that April hadn't even come downstairs for coffee yet. She looked to Ben, but she saw the excitement in Conner's eye. She didn't want to break up that conversation, so, she looked to Mike instead. When he made eye contact with her, he gave her a quizzical look. She simply looked up and pointed to the second floor while lipping April's name. He gave her a small nod before retreating upstairs to find that now brunette nineteen year old. Roma was still in April's room. He didn't want to leave her alone after everything that had happened and he was going to stay there until she told him otherwise. April's head was just resting at the foot of her bed while looking up at the ceiling, but Roma was sitting on the edge of her bed, just watching her. Every second that passed by that April was still quit, it boggled his mind even more. There was suddenly a knock on her door, taking them both by surprise. \"April?\" That was Mike's voice. \"Breakfast is ready, everyone's waiting. Let's go.\" Roma turned to look at her cautiously which she shook her head to. \"I don't want to see him.\" She whispered out. \"I don't want to see anybody. Just tell him I don't feel good.\" \"April?\" Mike called again. \"What am I supposed to tell your mom and dad?\" Roma asked with a panicked face and getting up from the bed. \"Anything but the truth.\" She barked while pushing him to the door before Mike could bust it in. As soon as Mike thought about busting the door in, Roma opened the door, causing Mike to look him up and down in confusion. \"April isn't really feeling well right now. I don't think she's gonna come down for breakfast.\" \"Well,\" Mike spoke, his voice holding as much confusion as his face. \"We'll send a physician up there.\" \"I don't think that's the best idea. I think she just needs to sleep it off.\" Mike's eyebrows furrowed even deeper. None of this was making sense to him. Why couldn't April tell him all of this? \"Can I talk to her?\" Roma peeked back into the room, immediately seeing April vigorously shake her head. When he turned back to Mike, he noticed that he was trying to spy into the room. \"She doesn't want that.\" Mike stared at him for a moment before looking to the door. \"April, come out here so I can talk to you.\" \"Not on your life, Banning!\" He looked to the door as if it was the one who insulted him. \"You heard her.\" Roma spoke, causing Mike to look right back at him. \"She doesn't want to see anyone.\" He shrugged as he opened the door to go back into her room. \"Not even you, Mike.\" When the door shut in Mike's face, he didn't know what to do. It was driving him crazy, not being able to help her when he had been so used to being the only one she would go to. He just didn't understand what could have been so bad that she couldn't even tell him. In that moment where all he could do was stare at the door, he knew that he was going to do anything to find out what the hell was wrong with her. Conner met Mike in the walls, ready for the debriefing on what was going to happen with April. April still hadn't come out of her room, and Ben and Maggie were starting to get worried. Hell, even Conner was getting worried. This wasn't like April. She was talking to no one and that was the most surprising thing about all of it. She wasn't talking to anyone . Roma didn't even know what was happening, but he could put together a conclusion. He just didn't voice his conclusion. Mike was working with the left over ear pieces they had before the Secret Service got new ones. They ran on a completely different channel than the new ones so they wouldn't interfere and no one would know their secret little plan. \"Have you ever used a walkie talkie before?\" Mike asked while handing the ear piece to him. \"Yeah.\" He spoke obviously. \"Well, it's kind of like that.\" Mike told him while clipping the microphone to his shirt. \"You talk into the mic, but you press the button in your ear piece to talk.\" Conner stood there for a moment, before looking to Mike with a confused face. \"That's weird.\" \"Hell yeah it is.\" Mike spoke while putting his in his ear. \"Now, you are my look out. If anyone remotely has a suspicion about where I am, what is our code word?\" \"Happy April Fools.\" Conner spoke with an obvious nod. \"Good.\" Mike told him with a nod and the point of a finger. Mike turned around, getting all of the equipment he would need for the plan when Conner spoke, \"Hey, Mike.\" He turned around, expecting just a question of clarification out of him, but Conner's face was worried. \"Is April going to be okay?\" Mike looked at him for a moment, knowing he couldn't promise that to him, but he had to make him feel safe. Make his sister feel safe. That was his job. \"Yeah.\" He spoke as he put his hands on his shoulders. \"I'm sure it's nothing major, okay?\" He leaned in, his face getting more playful that time. \"She's probably hungover.\" Conner laughed, causing Mike to smile as he pat his arm. \"She'll be fine.\" Conner nodded in agreement. \"Thanks, Mike.\" He gave him a light slap on the face before standing up straight and going off to help April. How hard could it possibly be? Mike was struggling to get to April's window, feeling himself falling from scaling the White House. This was hard. It was very hard. He was just under the window, reaching out and knocking on the it, hoping she would notice him before he fell to his death. April's eyebrows furrowed at the sound, turning to look at her window, seeing a hand reaching up her window sill. She immediately moved to the other side of the room, picking up her bat and inching towards the window. \"April.\" Mike called in a weak voice. She recognized the voice immediately, dropping her bat and running to the window. \"Oh my god!\" It was more angry than concerned as she watched his feet dangling below her. \"Mike!\" She opened up the window, pulling him into her room by the hand which he climbed the rest of the way into. Once he was on the floor, he began to thank how great floors were. \"Thanks.\" He breathed as April glared at him with hands on her hips. \"What the hell are you doing?\" she screamed at him as he finally stood up, still matching her glare. \"First of all,\" he spoke while brushing the dust off of his suit. \"I just scaled the wall into your room and no one did anything, we're getting high security out here.\" She scoffed while rolling her eyes. \"Oh my god.\" She yelled at him from the audacity that he had to bring that up while Mike shut her window, making sure to lock it. \"Second,\" he spoke, twirling around to give her a look on annoyance mixed with slight concern. \"What the hell has been going on with you today?\" \"None of your damn business.\" She spoke, kind of blaming him for what happened between her and William. She turned around, trying to get away from him as fast as she could. She didn't want to talk to him about all of this and she didn't want to fight, but it looked like they were going to have to fight. He looked at her like she was insane for walking away from him. She opened the door to her bathroom, giving him a challenging look before slamming the door shut. Mike stood there for a moment, letting everything she just did process in his brain. \"Like hell it isn't!\" He charged after her, throwing the bathroom door open, catching sight of her looking at herself in the mirror. Her palms were against the counter, breathing heavily, simply staring at herself like she was a monster. Mike opened his mouth, about to scream at her for being so defiant, but she caught something in the corner of the mirror. \"You're bleeding.\" The statement took him completely off guard. He didn't feel any amount of pain until she said something. April turned around to look at him, pointing at his leg because she knew he had no idea where it was coming from. \"You're bleeding.\" she spoke again, pointing at his leg this time. \"Sit down.\" She commanded before pointing to the edge of the tub. Mike looked to her for a moment before doing as she told. April was rummaging through under her sink, finally pulling out a first aid kit, getting down on the floor in front of him. \"I'm a nursing major.\" She told him with that same flirty smile as she rolled up his pant leg. She began to clean the cut, Mike jumping a little at the pain, but he didn't take his eyes off of her. \"Good to know.\" \"I have my CNA,\" she spoke suddenly, kind of taking him off guard. \"So, my senior year of high school, I got a job at the hospital in downtown Harrisburg.\" She finally looked up from the cut to look at Mike, noticing his confused look. \"The capitol city of Pennsylvania.\" \"I know.\" He spoke while shaking his head with that look of confusion still on his face. \"What I don't get is why you got a job if your father was the governor.\" April chuckled a little bit, beginning to reminisce. \"Dad told me it would help my character …and he was right.\" Her lips tugged into a smirk. \"Don't tell my dad that.\" Mike just laughed as April looked back down to his leg. Mike then thought of what she had said earlier. \"Why are you telling me all of this?\" She looked back up at him, hurt plastered all over her face, not totally knowing the answer to his question. \"Maybe all of that is related to how much I want to help people.\" She was looking off into space like she was rethinking her whole life which was making Mike become very worried about what was going through her head. \"Like you with your leg.\" She looked back to him, Mike giving her a sympathetic look at the tears forming in her eyes. \"I put off going to college to help my dad with his campaign.\" The first tear fell down her cheek, causing her to shake her head. This was the reason she didn't want to see Mike all day. She knew the second she saw him, she was going to fall apart. \"Like how I helped William get in on the in crowd of politics and didn't even realize that he was using me the whole time before breaking my heart.\" Mike didn't care if she wasn't done with his leg or if he was bleeding, he was going to pull her in for the biggest hug he could give her. He now knew why she didn't want to come out of her room. She couldn't tell her dad because she didn't want to get in the way of his job. She couldn't tell her mom because she would tell her father. She shouldn't have told Mike because Mike knew the second he saw him again he was going to kill him. \"Next time I see that fuckboy I'm punching him in the nuts.\" \"Mike,\" she sighed out as she pulled away from the hug. \"Don't.\" \"That fucker – \" \"Mike,\" she spoke sternly this time, getting his attention immediately. \"I don't want to talk to him again, to see him again or have anything to do with him again. I just want to forget about it.\" He looked to her, really wanting to knock that guy's teeth in, but at the same time, he knew he couldn't do that to April. \"I want to forget about him.\" \"Okay.\" He spoke reluctantly after a pause, before putting his arm around her and sinking down to her level, the two leaning against the bathtub. They stayed like that for a moment, April loving that she had someone like this in her life. Someone she could tell anything to. A best friend. She would take him over that fuckboy William Guthrie any day. \"I honestly thought you were in here because of the article that came out today.\" Her eyebrows scrunched together before looking back to him, a confused face matching Mike's concerned one. As if she didn't have enough to worry about, she now had to worry about a new article about her. \"What article?\" Mike sighed. He really wished he would keep his mouth shut sometimes. \"Google April Asher.\" He spoke as he removed his arm from around her shoulders. \"I'm sure you'll find it in less than two seconds.\" April gave him a skeptical look as she pulled out her phone, doing as he said, immediately finding the article he was talking about. It was in every gossip website imaginable, causing her to roll her eyes. \"The Not-So Secret Service.\" She read while giving Mike an annoyed look. \"What? Did they get that title from a cereal box?\" Mike shrugged with a dark chuckle rumbling in his throat. \"Wait until you get to the picture.\" \"There's a picture?\" She asked, giving him another look, hard to believe that they would actually do this on her birthday. He simply nodded toward the phone, knowing she would just have to scroll down to see it. When she did, she realized that there was a picture of her and Mike when he had pulled her in to whisper to her. She had a smile on her face, directed to the fans while Mike had a smile on his face to make it look like nothing bad was going to happen. \"Oh my god.\" She whispered with a bit of a smile on her face, not being able to believe how wrong they were. \"Yeah, apparently we're in a secret relationship.\" She looked to him, her lips pursed as he gave her a flirty look she had to roll her eyes to. \"Yeah right.\" She whispered while looking back to the article. Mike smiled as he watched her read, putting his arm around her again as her head leaned back on his shoulder. Mike just continued to watch her, knowing just what she knew. He could never ask for a better best friend. Mrs. Happy Anarchy: Thanks as always for being so dedicated. I'm glad it made you smile. I love when my work can make other people happy! If Mike would have supervised that date, it would have been awful. Hahaha! Scarlet: Thank you so much for reading, it means a whole lot to me. I'm a huge fan of Gerard too. He's so great. It might take a bit to get to, but more is going to happen between them during the summer. And you sent that review in on my birthday and it just made me really happy so thank you again for that review! Guys, I am so sorry this chapter took so long to get to you. It seemed like every time I sat down to write it, I just got busy all over again. I hope you guys liked it and remember to review and stay tuned![Chapter 5] April April smiled as she weaved her way through the group of small children. It had taken her a while to get ready, but when Mike saw her, he knew all that time she spent was worth it. She wore a green dress with brown flowers all over with a green cardigan to match and white heels. Mike was really proud of the way she had pulled herself together in the past few weeks. With everything that happened with William and the picture of the two of them coming out, she had handled it all respectively well. Not only was Mike proud of her, the entire Asher clan was. Well, except Conner. He didn't see there was a reason to be proud of her. She just continued to carry on as same old April. He just didn't know how hard that was for her. When April finally looked up from the small children, she saw Mike smiling at her so she returned back a small smile. When she finally reached him, she rolled her eyes. \"I know I'm hot, Banning, but take a picture and it will last longer.\" \"No.\" He shook his head as she joined him at his left side, his eyes going straight forward. \"I was just wondering why you picked such an ugly puke green color.\" Her hand automatically met his arm with a hard slap which he just smiled to. They looked back to all of the kids, smiling at how they were all having fun, especially Conner. He was off talking to a little girl, making them both smile. \"How much do you want to bet that Conner is going to blow it?\" April asked Mike with a devious smile on her face. \"Are you kidding me?\" Mike scoffed while looking off at the two kids. \"No. Not with what I've been teaching him.\" April turned to look at him, her eyebrows furrowed. \"What have you been teaching him?\" \"You know,\" he spoke with a shrug. \"The normal on how to talk to girls.\" She raised an eyebrow at him which he shrugged to, making her look back to Conner and the girl. That's when Conner put up his hand, leaning on the side of the White House while her back was to it. April's mouth dropped as laughter began to pour out of her. \"Oh my god.\" She turned to look back to Mike, her mouth still dropped. \"You taught him how to be a fuckboy.\" \"I did not.\" Mike spoke, offended with her. \"You may not realize it,\" she spoke while looking back over to Conner. \"But you did.\" \"So, are you saying I'm a fuckboy?\" Mike asked while crossing his arms. April looked back to him, a playful smile on her face. Just as she opened her mouth, there was a loud pop that filled the air, followed by screams. April looked over, but before she could see anything going on, Mike tackled her down. There was another pop and more screams, Mike making it his job to cover her entire body so she wouldn't get hurt. April's hand moved to Mike's as he grabbed it instantly as tight as possible. There were two more pops, April cringing at every one, as Mike just held her tighter and the area was filled with grave silence. \"Gunman down.\" One of the other agents spoke into Mike's earpiece. Mike slowly started to sit up, his arm still on April's neck, forcing her into the grass. \"Stay down.\" She nodded rapidly as Mike continued to look around. He could see a group of the agents around someone lying on the ground as everyone else was on the ground, some protecting others, but the majority of them had their hands over their heads. He slowly brought April up when he saw for himself that the threat was gone. She looked around with a frantic look on her face as her breath went in and out rapidly. When Mike looked back to her, he saw how terrified she was. He put his hands on her shoulders, studying her face all over. \"Are you okay?\" She just nodded, still looking around all over, just nodding so he would think she was okay. \"April, look at me.\" he spoke, breaking her out of her terrified trance to stare right into those icy blue eyes she had become so acquainted with. \"Are you okay?\" She bit her lip, knowing she couldn't lie to him. She shook her head as he wrapped his arms around her shoulders in a tight hug. April stood there for a moment before wrapping her arms around his entire back, feeling herself begin to cry into his shoulder. \"April!\" they heard Conner call out. April immediately broke away from Mike, hurrying to her little brother with open arms. \"Conner!\" She cried out, practically picking him up in the hug. Mike just continued to look at the two. His heart was pinching in his chest. The fact that those two kids were so close to losing their lives. It hurt him. Those kids slowly became his everything. If anything happened to either of them, he would lose his mind. \"Conner!\" All of them turned to see Ben and Maggie hurrying towards them. \"April!\" \"Dad!\" Conner yelled, running into his arms. \"Mom!\" April screamed out, practically tackling Maggie down with a hug. All Mike could do was watch them. April and Conner could have been killed today and Mike didn't do anything to make sure that didn't happen. He knew he shouldn't, but he felt guilty. He felt like he could have done something. And now, he was going to make sure that April and Conner were the most protected kids the White House had ever seen. \"This is honestly ridiculous.\" April complained with her hands on her hips while watching Mike pound nails into her windowsill. \"Yeah, well,\" Mike spoke, inspecting his handy work before stepping back. \"You'll thank me when the time comes.\" \"Mike,\" she began calmly, knowing that if she didn't talk to him calmly, she would explode. \"It was one incident that wasn't even remotely close to my bedroom. You are being insane!\" She finally screamed, feeling Mike's overprotectiveness smothering her. Her own father hadn't been like this since the shooting. \"You need your window for something?\" He questioned in that sarcastic ass hole way he always did with her. April threw her hands in the air, completely irritated. \"I would like to enjoy the freedom to open up my window and get a nice spring breeze!\" Mike shrugged like it was no big deal. \"You can go outside.\" She scoffed, completely done with him before turning into her bathroom to get ready. \"Get out of my room!\" She yelled as she began to undress for the repeat of the Easter Egg Roll. Mike leaned against her bathroom door, knowing he couldn't enter because of her current state, but he had to make her understand in some way why he was acting this way. \"April,\" he spoke slowly and softly. That was enough to stop her and listen. That voice, she would listen to any day. \"I need you to be safe.\" As he said that, she felt her heart tighten at how vulnerable he was in that moment. \"If anything were to happen to you, I would never be able to forgive myself.\" She thought back to what William had accused her of a few weeks ago. Because you love him?! She wasn't in love with Mike, but she did love him. Obviously more than William. She opened the door to her bathroom, now fully clothed in a new mint green dress for the occasion. \"Mike,\" Her eyes were a lot softer when Mike's almost hurt eyes flickered to her. \"I get it.\" She spoke softly, playing with the hot pink belt accentuating how small her waist was. Mike smiled down at her, their height always such a major difference. \"Thank you.\" he whispered before leaning forward and planting a kiss on her forehead. When he pulled away, April sighed, almost bouncing at wanting to tell him this next part. \"Just ease up a little?\" He rolled his eyes, but he couldn't help but smile at her. She understood, but this was a teenager that they were talking about. She wasn't down for any restrictions. \"You can't protect me from everything.\" \"I can damn well try.\" he spoke before pointing the door. \"Now get your ass out there, everyone's waiting for you.\" She smiled. That was the Mike she knew following her. \"Honestly, why does it take you two years to get ready?\" \"Oh,\" she spoke, turning back to look at him from the door. Mike's smile just got wider at the sight of hers. \"Shut your face.\" Mike kept his eyes trained on everything going on around them. Nothing would be able to stop him from that this time. He hadn't even seen April since he escorted her outside. While Mike's eyes were trained on every guest that passed him, Ben showed up next to him. \"Sir,\" Mike acknowledged without even looking at him. Ben smiled a little bit while looking over at him, finding this all so amusing. Sure, Mike was great at his job, but he was usually playful. Today, though, he had laser focus. No amount of playfulness was on his face. \"You know,\" Ben began, not directly looking at him. \"We're all fine. Me. Maggie. Conner. April.\" He made sure to save April's name for last, knowing he was the most worried about her. Mike turned to look at him, smiling a little bit. \"I'm glad to hear that.\" \"And it's okay to let your guard down just a little bit.\" Ben continued, trying to make his point. \"With all due respect, sir,\" Mike began, knowing he had to say that before he got to his point. \"I don't tell you how to do your job.\" Ben nodded, his head going from side to side, knowing just how blunt Mike could be. \"Fair.\" He then moved closer to Mike, knowing he was most definitely going to want to hear this next part. \"I just saw April hurrying off with William Guthrie.\" Mike's head snapped to the president, his eyes automatically filling with fire at what he just heard. No way was this kid around April again. \"If you wouldn't mind checking on that.\" Mike almost ran Ben over with how fast he hurried off to go find her. She was going to be in trouble when he found her. Especially if she was actually thinking about getting back with that fuckboy. He finally found the two towards the back lawn of the White House, near one of the very big trees where hardly anyone was at. They were talking passionately, hands waving and those blue eyes Mike couldn't find himself without, turning into a hot red. \"What the hell is going on over here?\" When they both looked to Mike, charging for them, April's eyes immediately filled with fear while William's filled with annoyance. \"Nothing.\" April spoke, her eyes going back to William, a hateful stare on her face. \"Bullshit.\" Mike spoke, turning to roll his eyes at her before turning back to William, giving him another death glare. \"What the hell are you doing here?\" William moved towards him, getting right in his face. \"Well, Miss. Perfect invited me.\" Mike looked behind William, making direct eye contact with April. \"You and I are going to have a conversation later that you're not going to like much.\" April rolled her eyes at him, but her glare immediately moved back to William, burning a hole in his back. \"Newsflash,\" William spoke with a bit of a chuckle, getting into Mike's face again, Mike's glare getting even deeper than before…if that was even possible. \"You're not her boyfriend, you're a glorified security guard, and you can't tell her what to do.\" Mike stood there for a moment, an angry smile spreading across his face as he looked around the immediate area. When his glare finally got back to William, he tackled him down. \"Oh my god!\" April screamed, watching the two wrestling each other on the grass. And of course, the president's daughter arguing with her ex-boyfriend didn't attract the press, but her ex-boyfriend and the man she was having an alleged affair with fighting in the middle of the White House Easter Egg Roll caught their attention. \"Stop!\" April screamed, trying to pull Mike off of William. It wasn't for William, it was for the sake of both of their reputations. Cameras flashed all around them, and as soon as that happened, the rest of the Secret Service agents were there to tear apart the fight. \"You know what?\" William screamed to Mike as they were both getting pulled apart, April immediately at Mike's side, grabbing onto his arm to keep him from launching into another attack, knowing he had the strength to break out of the grip he was in. \"You can have her.\" He shrugged off the grip the agents had on him, throwing his hands in the air. \"She's just my sloppy seconds.\" Mike was in a fury, thinking about ripping his head off in front of all of the cameras here, but April was furious. That's when she charged forward, sucker punching him right in the nose. \"Ass hole.\" She called before he fell to the ground unconscious. Her hand was throbbing, but she honestly didn't feel it at the moment. The adrenaline was still pumping through her. Mike couldn't do anything, but look her up and down. She knocked him out with one hit and probably broke his nose along with her hand. Damn, he was impressed. Ben pushed through the crowd, finally seeing his best agent sweaty and being held back by all of his other agents, his daughter's right hand broken and purple, and finally, his daughter's ex-boyfriend and current youngest member of the House of Representatives lying on the ground in front of them all, blood coming out of his nose and unconscious. He sighed, taking the whole thing in. \"Maybe a redo of this event wasn't the best idea.\" April sat on the right side of the couch in the middle of the Oval Office, her right hand wrapped up in a cast while Mike sat next to her, a few bruises and scars on his face and William the farthest from April with bandages on his nose, a big black bruise around the bandages. Ben and Maggie sat at the couch in across of them, looking back and forth at the three. They didn't know who they were the most disappointed in, but they could all agree that they hated William. Allan Trumbull, Speaker of the House, was walking back and forth between the couches, trying to find what to say while Lynne Jacobs stood near the desk, giving Mike the death glare of all death glares. \"The amount of shenanigans that have happened during this office have been inexcusable.\" He stopped pacing, turning so he was facing the three siting on the couch. \"And they all seem to come down to the three of you.\" April and Mike shared a worried look before turning back to Alan. \"It's all on me, sir.\" Mike spoke immediately. \"No.\" April immediately interjected. \"It's all on me. Don't take this out on Mike.\" William scoffed, causing them both to give him a dirty look. \"What's that supposed to mean?\" Mike asked. \"Nothing.\" He spoke with the shake of the head. \"You two are just so perfect for each other.\" April leaned over Mike, looking William right in the eye with an angry stare. \"Do you want me to break another bone?\" \"That is enough.\" Ben spoke in a stern voice, April immediately leaning back into her seat, knowing that voice better than anything. \"Mr. Speaker,\" Lynne spoke, gaining everyone's attention back to the Secret Service Director. \"Mike is the best agent we have. Any trouble caused by him,\" her voice got stern as she looked over to Mike. \"I guarantee, is worth it.\" Allan looked back over to the three on the couch, knowing something had to be done for everything they had all caused. \"In the time of four months, a Jackson Pollock original has gone missing,\" Mike looked at April, giving him a concerned look, still not knowing where that painting was. \"The press has printed multiple stories on your head Secret Service agent and the President's daughter and now a full out brawl in the middle of the White House lawn.\" The three continued to sit there, not sure what to say to any of that. They knew it was all true. April and Mike both knew it was their fault, but it was all natural reactions of normal problems. \"Mr. Speaker,\" Mike spoke, standing up, everyone's eyes going immediately to him. He looked to April, knowing he had to stand up to all this for her. \"We can't be at fault for the press following every bit of our problems.\" He shrugged while looking over to Ben and Maggie. \"This is a family. They're going to have family issues that they can't help, yesterday included. And if you can't accept that like how you accepted Bill cheating on Hillary, with all due respect sir, you can go fuck yourself.\" April's mouth dropped with a bit of a smile as Mike walked out of the office, leaving everyone else to mull over what he had just said. Lynne had her eyes shut after everything he had said, hardly being able to believe this was her best agent and all the pain he was causing. William was pissed off as usual and Ben and Maggie didn't know if they should laugh or go do something about it. April decided to break up the silence by being the first person to stand up and walk out. She hurried down the hallway, seeing Mike's back, hurrying after it. \"Mike!\" She called out, causing him to finally turn around. \"Thank you for standing up for me.\" Mike shook his head, moving closer to her. \"Anytime.\" She nodded, that smirk she always used with him creeping back on her face before she turned around. \"Hey, April!\" he called, turning her around instantly, ready to listen. He stood there for a moment, try to come up with words that wouldn't sound derogatory even though this was the only subject he wanted to use derogatory words for. \"Why was William at the Easter Egg Roll?\" April bit her lip, moving towards him, knowing this was going to be hard to talk about. \"Yeah, that's something I really wanted to talk to you about, but was kind of scared to.\" He turned his head to the side, curious to what she was talking about and then at the same time, just as scared as she was for what he was going to have to do. William was at his favorite bar, drinking crappy beer and watching the only sports program you could get at two in the morning. This particular one happened to be a soccer game. Brazil vs London. While William signaled for the bartender to get him another drink, April sat down next to him, giving him a slight smile. When William finally recognized her, he looked shocked. Almost like her there was all he had ever wanted. \"April? What are you doing here?\" She didn't look at William, though. She looked right past him. Right at Mike in the chair on the other side of him. William turned, let out an angry sigh once he realized what she was looking at, turning back to his beer. \"How are you doing, William?\" Mike asked, April smiling at the way his accent crept out. \"What the hell do you both want?\" Mike shared a look with April before looking back to William. \"April told me about the deal you two worked out.\" William looked over at him, shifting slightly. \"She told me about the pictures you took after sex and how you threatened to leak those pictures to the press if she didn't keep giving you sex whenever you wanted.\" William finished off his beer, knowing Mike was about to kill him. Just as he finished it, his thoughts came true, Mike grabbing him by the collar of his shirt, lifting up off the ground, looking him right in the eye. \"Here's what you're gonna do,\" Mike started with a smile as the bartender just watched with a worried face. \"You're going to delete those pictures you have of her and you're never gonna talk to her again.\" \"The other thing.\" April reminded like he had actually forgot, but Mike would never forget. \"That's right.\" Mike spoke with a nod. \"You're also gonna tell the whole world what an ass hole you are, but you're gonna tell everyone that April was your beard and when she no longer agreed to it, you got violent. Got it?\" William nodded, his eyes filled with fear, knowing he would do anything in that moment to get Mike out of his face. \"And if you don't follow up on any of these conditions, I'm gonna track you down and I'm gonna fucking kill you for ever bothering her.\" He pushed William away from him, letting him finally run out. Mike sat up on the bar stool next to where William was as April took William's spot and untouched new beer. \"I don't think he'll be bothering you anytime soon.\" \"I owe you.\" April spoke while taking a slug of the beer, knowing Mike wouldn't say anything if she didn't. \"Big time.\" \"Oh,\" Mike spoke, sarcasm dripping in his voice. \"That was my god damn pleasure.\" April laughed as Mike signaled the bartender, quickly ordering a glass of bourbon, the two sipping on their drinks together. \"I'm sorry I didn't tell you earlier.\" She whispered, causing Mike to look back to her with a concerned look. \"You were scared.\" He defended. She gripped her beer, thinking back on all of it. \"But I don't want to be scared.\" Mike looked to her, realizing she was never more serious about something in her entire life. \"Even back with the shooter.\" She was shaking her head, feeling this epiphany hit her like a ton of bricks. \"I want to be stronger than that.\" She turned to look at Mike, pure determination on her face. \"Can you teach me how to protect myself?\" Mike smiled as he looked at her. He thought she would never ask. \"We start as soon as that hand heals.\" She smiled at him, his smile just getting wider as they raised up their drinks and clinked them together in cheers, knowing tomorrow was going to be a start to something new. Mrs. HappyAnarchy: William is just that character that is not to be trusted. You can tell especially in this chapter that he's just a sketchy person. I'm real excited to write OHF with April in it, but of course we still got a little way to go. Thanks for your reviews! kgriswold249: William is not one to be trusted. Gladly, this is the last chapter he will be in so we can rejoice for that. I hope you liked this chapter, sweetie and thank you for the review! Okay guys, I'm the worst person ever for getting this up to you guys so late. School is kicking my ass right now and my weekends are booked up with work and work. I hope you all liked this one and remember to review![Chapter 6] June April stared Mike down in the boxing ring of the workout room. She was determined to beat him this time. If it was the last thing she did. She swung, but he spun her around, gripping her waist tightly and pulling his arm up to her chest, symbolizing a knife that could have been stabbed into her heart. April shut her eyes, for sure that she had that one this time. \"What did you do?\" He asked like a parent that had caught his child doing something wrong. She sighed, her chest falling up and down rapidly against his hand. \"I forgot to keep my hands up.\" She spoke, angry with herself at forgetting something that simple. \"And where would that get you?\" He questioned. She rolled her eyes slightly. Coach Mike was the harshest Mike she had ever met. \"Dead.\" She spoke point blank. He spun her out of the grip he had her in, the two facing each other back in a combat style. \"Go again.\" She punched at him, but he blocked, her keeping her hands up this time to block him from turning her over. She pushed him into the side of the ring, but his strength trumped hers, throwing her into the rope just like she had done to him. That's when she got a good idea. She kneed him in the gut, sending him back slightly and then she kneed his head, sending him into a dazed confusion on what the hell just happened. Before he could do anything else, she pushed him to the ground to immediately climb on top of him, putting a finger gun to his head with a smirk on her face. \"You're dead.\" \"That was dirty.\" He commented, pushing her hand out of his face. \"Yeah, well, if someone is trying to kill me, I don't think that they'll keep it clean.\" She got off of him, too soon for Mike's liking before she helped him up. \"You don't fight me dirty.\" April gave him a fake thinking face, making him just smirk. He loved when they could be assholes together. \"Or are you just an old man that's mad he got beat up by an inexperienced girl?\" He smirked at her while shaking his head. \"Don't pull that feminism crap on me. I love women and you know it.\" \"Trust me,\" April spoke as Mike began to pull off his boxing gloves. \"It's not about loving women.\" She began pulling her gloves off too, once she was finished, tossing them in the box where they kept their boxing gloves. Mike got out of the ring, waiting for April to go under the rope so he could help her down. He grabbed her by her waist, setting her down on the floor as the two began to walk forward. \"How's Leah?\" April asked, wiping sweat from her brow as they walked. \"She's okay, I guess.\" April's eyebrows furrowed as she looked over at him, confused. \"You guess?\" Mike shook his head, looking away from her. \"I don't want to talk about it, April.\" \"Then you picked the wrong person to train with this morning.\" Mike chuckled, knowing she was right. April was probably the most persistent person he knew. \"What's going on with Leah?\" Mike sighed, knowing April didn't know what it was like to be married. She wouldn't get all of it. \"She's got this friend…Patty or something.\" April automatically chuckled, knowing exactly what this was about. \"And she just keeps talking and talking about this guy she's seeing and how they think he's cheating on her or something.\" \"You don't even know what's going on in the story.\" April spoke with a bit of an eye roll. \"No shocker.\" \"What the hell does that mean?\" He asked while holding the door open for her. She turned around to look at him as they made their way into the kitchen. \"You don't listen to crap you don't care about.\" As soon as April pushed the door open, Mike caught it as she went to the fridge. She turned around, half in the fridge, but wanting to see his face for this part. \"Remember when I tried to tell you about NSYNCH?\" He reached his hand out, pointing a finger at her. \"That was different, I don't give a crap about boy bands.\" She threw him a bottle of water which he caught before she leaned against the island, opposite of him. Their faces were so close to the other, he could count every little freckle if he really wanted to and April could see the years of damage in every inch of his skin. \"So, I propose that you try listening even when it's shit you don't care about.\" Mike squinted a little bit, getting distracted by her eyes, leaning in only slightly. \"You have brown flakes in your eyes.\" April rolled her eyes, leaning up from what could have been a very intimate moment. \"You're an asshole.\" \"I was listening.\" April shook her head, turning to the fridge again, trying to find a snack. \"You were talking about listening.\" When he saw that she was ignoring him, he grabbed her wrist, turning her around instantly, their bodies extremely close together. \"Why do you hear me and not your wife?\" Mike shrugged playfully while looking down at her. \"You're always interesting.\" She gave him a smirk, thinking he was messing with her, causing her to turn around, back into the fridge. That's when Mike had to think back on what they both said. Why did everything April said sound like the newest wonder of the world and everything Leah said sounded like yesterday's news? Before anything else could happen, Ben and Maggie came into the room. \"How could you possibly lack that much taste?\" Maggie questioned, tearing April and Mike out of whatever they were doing. \"Maggie,\" Ben spoke calmly. \"Let me wear what I want to wear.\" \"You can't possibly think the blue tie looks better with a suit that looks that blue?\" Mike and April shared a look before April turned back to the fridge, pulling out a protein shake. \"I'm running the country, I'm pretty sure I can run my wardrobe too.\" Maggie opened her mouth, about to say something when she noticed April. Well, mostly what April was wearing. It was a hot pink sports bra and tight black leggings with her hair pulled into a sloppy bun leading to loose strands with sweat dripping in a few. She also noticed Mike standing in the area too. \"April,\" she spoke in a commanding tone. \"Put on a jacket.\" April rolled her eyes, hating to always have this conversation with her mom. It happened the second she hit puberty and got a pretty nice rack. Her mother was always telling her \"pull your shirt up\", \"put on something a little less revealing\" or \"maybe that's not the best shirt/dress given your circumstances\". \"It's just a body, mom. Everyone has one.\" \"Don't argue.\" Ben commanded just like her mother had. April gave a dramatic eye roll along with a sigh before moving to the jacket resting on the island. Mike looked at her as she did, feeling kind of bad. He listened to her feministic rants, whether she believed it or not, and he agreed with her. Mike was in a very revealing tank top, his muscles protruding out of every end, and no one asked him to put on a jacket because of it. \"Today's the big day.\" Maggie spoke, ignoring Ben for the time being and putting her hands on her daughter's shoulders while standing behind her. April rolled her eyes, keeping her eye contact with Mike, making him smirk through the drink he was taking. \"Are you excited?\" \"Thrilled.\" \"Don't be an asshole.\" Maggie whispered, just loud enough for everyone in the room to hear. April's mouth dropped while Mike almost spit out his drink. \"Dad!\" April spoke, trying to get some backup on this one. \"Well, you were kind of being an asshole.\" April rolled her eyes, turning back to the fridge, finally pulling out raspberries. \"I hate this family.\" \"Oh.\" Maggie spoke as Ben just chuckled at his daughter's response. \"Give me some.\" \"No.\" She spoke, pulling the container away from her. \"These are my raspberries. Do you physically put 'raspberries' on the list for the shopper? No, so they're mine.\" She turned all the way away from her with a huff. \"It's bad enough I have to share Coca Pebbles with Conner.\" Conner immediately came into the kitchen after that, hurrying for a bowl of Coca Pebbles. \"Speak of the devil.\" She muttered under her breath. Conner practically pushed April out of the way of the fridge for milk with an eye roll. \"You're just mad that I don't have school anymore and you do.\" \"Am not.\" She argued. \"Are too.\" He argued right back. April got her face down to his level, making sure to look right at him. \"Am not!\" He got on his tip toes, trying to do the same thing April was doing. \"Are too!\" \"You are both too active and angry for the morning.\" Ben commented with a hand on his temple. \"Both of you,\" Maggie spoke, almost exasperated. \"Stop.\" \"Conner,\" Mike spoke, nodding to the bowl of cereal he just poured. \"Why don't you take that bowl upstairs with you to watch cartoons?\" \"Really?\" he asked, practically jumping up and down from excitement. \"Yeah, but if you make a mess, you're cleaning it up and no one's helping you.\" Conner grabbed the bowl, carefully walking out of the kitchen making April chuckle just a little bit. Mike then turned to April, an automatic smirk on her face, ready to be her usual defiant self. \"You have to get ready for school.\" \"I don't have to.\" She spoke with a shrug. \"That's the beauty of college, I don't have to do anything.\" Mike got closer to her, not really wanting the President hear him threaten his daughter. \"If you don't get your ass upstairs and take a shower, I will personally take you back into that ring and kick your ass.\" \"Is that a threat or a promise?\" she whispered into his ear in a seductive voice, her breath hot on his face. \"April,\" he warned. \"Oh, I'm going. Don't get your panties in a twist.\" She hurried out of the kitchen, leaving just the adults. When Mike turned to look at Ben, he saw him looking at his watch. \"You got them both out of here in thirty seconds.\" A smile spread on Mike's face before he shrugged. \"It's my job.\" April sat in the back of her limo, breathing deeply. She asked, well asked isn't the right word, begged them to let her drive there. Mike wouldn't have that. Especially with the shooting that happened just a few months ago. The Secret Service team hated for her to even drive. So, here she was just outside the building of her first class of the day sitting in her limo, the United States flag mounted at the front, telling everyone this was a presidential vehicle. \"I hate all of you.\" Mike looked away from his paper to look at her with a puzzled face. \"Why can't you just let me live my life?\" \"Because you're the president's daughter,\" Mike spoke, adjusting how he was sitting so he could look at her better. \"Your life will never be normal again.\" April's head fell back, taking a deep sigh, confusing Mike even more. \"Shouldn't you be really happy that you're starting college? Gonna get fucked up at parties and make out with boys?\" April rolled her eyes, turning her head slightly to look at him. \"Yeah, if the paparazzi wasn't following me all day, every day.\" She scoffed as she turned away from him. \"They still think we're in a secret relationship.\" Mike studied her some more, knowing April should be really excited about this. \"What's going on, Showers?\" She smiled a little bit at the sound of her codename. \"You're going to be using that brilliant, scientific mind again, you should be happy, but you're sitting in this car sulking.\" He turned all the way to her direction, causing April to look back to him. \"What gives?\" April sighed before shaking her head at him. \"How the hell am I going to make friends – real friends – here as the president's daughter?\" Mike let out a deep sigh, feeling bad for April in that moment, knowing she had a right to be worried. \"You saw what William did to get close to me, how do I know if the people who I consider my friends don't have a hidden agenda the entire time?\" Mike grabbed April's hand which she gripped for dear life, finding herself looking straight forward. \"As much as I hate William, I must admit that he had genuine feelings for you. So, what I'm trying to say is that even if someone starts out becoming your friend because of that reason, they're eventually going to become your real friend.\" She turned to look at him, wondering how he could possibly know that was going to happen. \"No one can resist falling for you.\" She turned to look at him, smiling slightly. He knew the best things to say to make her feel better, and if it wasn't for him, she was sure she would be stuck in a relationship with that god awful William Guthrie. She gave his hand another tight squeeze with a smile before saying what she knew was going to be tough to bring up with him. \"Do you think that we can restrict security to just standing right outside the room I'm in? You don't have to be right next to me at all possible times, do you?\" Mike sighed while looking her up and down. He wanted to keep her as safe as possible, but he knew this was her first day, and this was her first time as the president's daughter. \"Fine.\" She began to applaud, but he rose his finger at her. \"But just for today. Tomorrow I'm gonna be sitting right next to you in every single class.\" \"Fine. Deal.\" She put out her hand, another thing Mike taught her. Nothing was agreed upon until there was a shake. He shook her hand and as soon as their shake was done, she leaned forward and gave him a kiss on the cheek. He smiled slightly as she hurried out of the car, he watched her walk out, and still insanely worried for what was going to happen to her while he wasn't with her. It was like his chest was squeezing in. \"This girl is gonna kill me.\" He mumbled to himself, watching her walk off until she was completely out of his sight. April walked into the lecture hall, looking all around. She knew this college was big, but she just wasn't really thinking about how big the classes were. Almost every spot was taken being there only being five minutes until the class started. As she looked around, everyone was on their phones, not even paying attention. She saw that as a blessing and a disadvantage. She took an empty seat crammed between a jock and a girl with a purple beanie on with headphones in. It was one of the last rows, and April knew she was going to need her glasses to be able to see the board. She began to rummage through her bag, looking for her glasses and once she pulled them out, she realized something very dire. She had no amount of journal or paper to take notes on. She stiffened, wondering how the hell this was going to play out. She straightened up from looking in her bag, taking a few deep breaths. How could she be so stupid? \"You okay?\" She quickly turned to her right, finding it was the girl with the beanie turned toward her. When she spoke, her voice had a kind of smoky tone to it. Her thin hair fell in curls, just barely going past her shoulders. Her almond colored eyes were hiding behind wire frames, and despite it being summer, she was dressed in mostly black. \"Um,\" April spoke, not sure how to approach this. \"I forgot my notebook.\" She looked at her empty desk for a moment before going through her bag and pulling out some loose paper. \"Here you go.\" April gave her a confused look, not understanding why she was so nice. \"Thanks.\" She spoke it almost cautiously, making the girl turn her head to the side a little bit. She wouldn't know that April was so self-conscious about who she was as the president's daughter. \"You're welcome.\" She was actually kind of confused at her tone, but she decided not to let it bother her. The professor suddenly walked into the lecture hall, everyone getting ready to take notes when April realized something else. The girl noticed that hopeless puppy look on her face again. \"Don't tell me you forgot a pen too?\" she whispered. April turned to look at her, the girl rolling her eyes at her puppy face. \"Here.\" She spoke handing over an extra pen. \"I better get both back.\" \"Thank you.\" April whispered as sincere as she possibly could, the girl giving her an obvious wave like she was an idiot. April took a deep sigh. She couldn't believe she had allowed herself to be that stupid. The instructor began to speak, April not being able to believe that she had come off as a complete idiot to the first classmate of hers she had met. Maybe she could make it up to herself in the lecture. She was following insanely well while the girl next to her was struggling. The girl looked over April's shoulder, studying her notes, finding sub notes that she had already knew about the topic. April turned to look at her once she felt her eyes, smiling slightly, knowing she had proved herself. \"You're pretty good at this stuff.\" She whispered with a nod as April just shrugged. \"Yeah,\" she spoke, tearing off a piece of paper and handing it to her. \"I'm gonna need your name and number to survive this course.\" April smiled while picking up the borrowed pen and writing down her number. This wasn't how she expected to make her first friend, but it was actually better than she pictured her first day to be. April did the same as the girl, tearing off a piece of her paper and handing it to her. \"And I'm gonna need yours for a reminder to buy school supplies.\" The girl laughed, and in just a few moments, they had exchanged slips of paper. \"Nice to meet you, April.\" The girl spoke while sticking out her hand with a slightly goofy expression on her face. April chuckled, taking her hand and shaking it. \"You too, Megan.\" April liked to busy herself around the house, finding it better than just sitting around and have the staff doing everything for her. She was currently peeling potatoes with their cook preparing their meal and Mike by her side, peeling potatoes with her. They had let silence pass over them, each of them finding themselves getting caught up in the activities they were doing, but April's phone kept buzzing. Mike gave her a look after the tenth time in a row as April put down the potato and knife while laughing at the phone. \"Who's that?\" Mike asked, nodding towards the phone. \"A friend.\" April spoke, putting the phone down after typing a response and going back to the potatoes. \"You've been attached to that phone the entire time you've being peeling.\" Monica, their chef spoke, peeking out from behind the pot. \"Before Mike even joined you.\" \"Is that so?\" Mike asked, now a playful look on his face. \"It's not a boy.\" April intercepted, knowing that was going to be Mike's first question. \"I've sworn them off for a good while.\" \"Wait a minute,\" Mike spoke, putting down his potato and knife. \"Is this the reason why you always ask me to meet you a building away when picking you up from class?\" She gave Mike a sly smile, letting him know he got it right. \"Maybe.\" \"Wait a minute,\" Monica spoke, leaning on the table they were at so she could look at April more closely. \"Does this friend even know you're the president's daughter?\" April's eyes darted back and forth between the two, both of them gasping when they realized April's best friend didn't know who her father was. \"April.\" They both scolded in unison. \"It's never come up before.\" April defended. She looked down at her potato, not wanting to look either of them in the eye. \"I wanted to get close with people before revealing the fact that I'm the president's daughter.\" She shrugged, looking back to Mike. \"Remember how well it went when William knew I was the president's daughter right off the back.\" Mike let out a scoff and shook his head. \"Yeah, I'd like to see that little twerp now.\" He finally looked back to April. \"I hope he still has that black eye you gave him.\" \"Mike,\" April spoke calmly, finding the biggest flaw in his wishful thinking. \"That was like two months ago. I'm pretty sure the bruise healed.\" \"Well, I hope it didn't.\" He whispered, barely loud enough for April to hear. April opened her mouth, about to continue arguing with him, but Monica knew she had to stop the two now or they would be here all night. \"I understand why you're waiting to tell her, but don't you think that if she hadn't backed out on you now, it's time to tell her?\" April sighed. She didn't want to admit it, but she was scared. She didn't want Megan to go running for the hills once she found out who her family was and she didn't want Megan to take advantage of her and her family, but she also knew both Monica and Mike were right. April picked up her phone, quickly typing up a message. \"Megan wanted to meet for a study session tomorrow, we could change it to here.\" Mike was almost giddy as she typed up the message, causing her to give him a slightly confused/annoyed look. Mike then looked to Monica, giving her a playful smile. \"I never get to meet April's friends.\" \"Because you'll give them a pat down the second they get two inches to me.\" Monica nodded, backing up April's comment, knowing Mike even before April had. \"She's right.\" \"Sorry for protecting you at all costs.\" Mike spoke sarcastically. April threw her potato back down, turning to look at Mike. \"There is a line between protection and over bearing.\" Monica sighed while looking back and forth. \"Tell me where that line is then.\" Mike challenged. Monica knew, this was going to continue for the entire preparation of dinner. \"The point where you give a cavity search to my friends!\" And the turkey still had another hour in the oven. \"I haven't even done it yet, you just assume I'm gonna do it!\" It was going to be a long hour. Megan had been circling for a while now, the security detail was probably getting worried of her presence. She had finally pulled over and picked up her phone, calling April automatically. It rang twice before she picked it up. \"Hello?\" April questioned. \"Okay, the only house I can see close to the address you sent me is the White House. If this is a prank, very funny, but where is your legit address?\" There was a knock on her car window, sending Megan at least a foot in the air in shock. \"What the hell, April?\" She yelled once she saw who was at the window. She threw her door open, turning to look at her. \"You scared the hell out of me!\" That's when she noticed a guy with dark hair standing close by her. \"Who's this?\" April turned slightly to look at Mike, waving a hand at him. \"Oh, that's just Mike.\" \"'Just'?\" he repeated, slightly offended. \"Oh, calm down.\" She told him with an eye roll before turning back to Megan. \"Um,\" Megan spoke with a shrug. \"So, he's like your boyfriend or something?\" April let out a loud chuckle, Mike giving her another offended look. \"No, bodyguard if we want to get technical.\" \"What?\" Megan questioned, completely confused with how this study session was playing out. \"It will all get really clear really soon. I promise.\" Megan looked at her friend, Mike and then her car. She was wondering if she should make a break for it, but April had become a pretty close friend. At the least she could give her a chance. \"Okay?\" April smiled, reaching out for her hand which Megan reluctantly took. April followed Mike, taking them to the front gate of the White House. Mike immediately went to the front gate, getting Megan's visitor pass as she turned to look back at April. \"Are we studying at the White House now? Can you do that?\" April bit her lip slightly when Mike came back with a lanyard for her. \"Megan Goodnight,\" he looked at her for a moment before giving her a confused glance. \"Is that your real name?\" \"You want to see my birth certificate?\" She asked in a tired voice. Megan got that a lot. Like at least on a daily basis. \"Okay,\" Mike spoke, moving to put the lanyard on her. \"Megan Goodnight, you are granted with an all access pass.\" \"Sweet.\" Megan commented as she looked down at the lanyard. \"Let's go.\" April called, pulling her forward and into the physical White House. \"So,\" Megan began as she walked through the front door with Mike leading the way, thinking of all the possibilities on why April would take her to the White House. \"Is your dad like the chef or something like on Corey in the House or…\" Megan trailed off when she saw the President of the United States walking down the stairs, speaking into his cell phone. \"I'll get with you tomorrow.\" He spoke into the phone. Megan was completely stunned as April showed up in her ear. \"Our chef's name is actually Monica. That's my dad.\" Megan turned to her with wide eyes before remembering she had a mustard stain on her shirt she immediately tried to wipe out. She thought this was going to just be a lazy study session at April's house. She didn't realize she was meeting President Benjamin Asher. Ben moved to the two girls while Mike stood close by. \"Hey, pumpkin.\" Ben spoke while pulling April in to kiss the top of her head. Then Ben turned to the other girl, black hair tied up in a messy bun and contacts instead of her wire glasses. She wore one of her old high school T-shirts, yoga pants and Nike's, compared to Ben's suit and tie. \"And you must be the Megan I've been hearing so much of.\" Ben put his hand out to shake Megan's and she just looked at it. \"Whoa, bro.\" She spoke almost under her breath before taking his hand and shaking it. Now she knew where April got her people skills from. Every time the girl met someone new, she sounded like she was running for a position in office. \"I voted for you by the way.\" She spoke quickly while shaking his hand. Ben laughed as April put her face in her own palm. \"Glad to hear that.\" Mike put a hand on April's shoulder, massaging it lightly as she leaned into it. \"April has told me so much about you.\" Megan then looked at April, giving her a kind of angry stare she shrugged to. \"Really because she's told me hardly anything about you.\" April gave her another playful shrug that Megan just gave her an angry smile. \"Let me properly introduce you to Mike.\" Ben spoke, moving to his secret service agent just as Mike took his hand off of April's shoulder. \"Because I know my daughter didn't.\" April gave him a little shrug, but Ben knew his daughter, and he knew Megan didn't know who her father was until he came down these steps. \"Mike here is in charge of April's security detail, so if you need anything while you're here, just ask Mike and he'll help you out.\" Megan gave him a shy smile, now really regretting mistaking him for April's boyfriend, but not totally regretting it. There was something there. She just hadn't figured it out yet. She wasn't even sure if April had figured it out yet. \"I've got a few more things to take care of,\" Ben told the group, looking back to his cell phone before turning back to Megan. \"But can I expect you at dinner?\" \"How could I refuse a gourmet meal?\" \"We're actually just having pizza tonight.\" April spoke with a guilty look on her face. Megan looked down at that, taking a deep sigh. \"Well, that's disappointing.\" April looked up to her father with a smile. \"She's staying for dinner.\" Ben gave them each a smile before hurrying up the stairs to go back into his office. Megan continued to stand there, processing everything that had just happened. \"Why don't we go to my room?\" April suggested. \"I need a drink.\" Megan muttered as April dragged her up to stairs and into her room. Mike followed them, April giving him an annoyed face as he gave her that stupid know-it-all smile. \"Told you that you should have told her earlier.\" \"You didn't even know until yesterday.\" She spoke in a hushed whisper before slamming the door in his face as Mike stood there for a moment, realizing she was right. April turned to her friend who was slowly freaking out just looking at the room. \"What the hell, April?!\" Megan finally asked, turning around to look at her. \"I'm in the White House right now. Like deep in the White House. Stuff that isn't even in the tours, and I should know since I've lived here my whole life and I've been going on those since elementary school!\" \"Look,\" April spoke, nervously playing with her hands. \"I know you're freaking out – \" \"Understatement!\" Megan screamed out, still walking around the room like she had no idea what she was doing or where she was going. \"Okay, you're probably livid, but I have a good reason for keeping it from you.\" \"Oh,\" Megan spoke, sitting down on her bed, looking at her like this was the most interesting piece of information she had ever heard. \"Do tell.\" April stood there for a moment, trying to find out where to start. \"My dad was the governor of Pennsylvania before he was president, and even then, people would want to be friends with me just to see what my house looked like or the perks of being in the news or all the luxurious things I had.\" Megan's face softened a little bit, seeing where her friend was going with all of this. \"And you thought it would be even worse when your dad became the president.\" April let out a sigh of relief. She expected Megan to act more drastically to the news, but she was so understanding. \"Yes.\" Megan gave her a slight smile with a shrug as she began to look around again. \"I get it.\" She turned back to her friend, the smile growing just a little bit. \"I mean, I don't want to get it because my best friend lied to me, but…I get it.\" April gave her a big smile, her shoulders caving in just a little bit. \"'Best friend'?\" \"Oh god.\" Megan spoke, shutting her eyes, knowing how April was with feelings. April was completely giddy, hurrying to her side at the bed. \"I shouldn't have said anything.\" April wrapped her in a hug which Megan wasn't going to protest. She hugged her back as tight as she could because she meant what she said, those two hadn't known each other long, but they were best friends. Megan looked to her, breaking out of the hug slightly. \"Although, I don't think your dad likes me.\" April gave her a confused look, wondering where she got that from. \"Why?\" \"Because he talked to me like a politician.\" She spoke obviously. \"Megan,\" April practically laughed out, looking to her best friend. \"He is a politician.\" She looked down slightly, thinking about it. \"Oh yeah.\" April laughed, pulling her back into a hug which Megan enjoyed, but she was going to act like she hated. When they finally pulled away, Megan looked back to the door, moving closer on the bed to April. \"So what's with you and that Mike guy?\" \"What do you mean?\" April chuckled. \"Oh, come on, you like him.\" \"Mike?!\" April exclaimed with a laugh resting in her throat. \"No, he's just a friend.\" Megan looked her friend up and down, not totally believing her. \"Okay.\" April opened her mouth, about to say more, catching on that tone Megan used, but Megan was pulling out her school books. \"Are we actually going to get to studying because I don't know about you, but I want to get into the nursing program?\" April pulled out her notes as Megan cracked open her book. Megan immediately began talking about anatomy, but April was only half listening. This was the second time in the last few months that someone had suggested April having a thing for Mike and it was two people who were very close to her. While putting her pen to her lips, she began to think. Was it possibly that she did have a thing for Mike, but she just hadn't realized it? : Hehehe the punch was my favorite part to write MisfitCarter: Thanks love and can't wait to give you more! THO12120445, Guest and NGArmyWife, thanks for the positive feedback and I will write as fast as my little fingers will take me! I have once again taken forever to update, but I hope I made it up to you guys since this is the longest chapter I've written for this story! I am officially done with school, though, so that means this summer will be focusing on working and writing. Whoo! I hope you guys liked this chapter and Happy Mother's Day to the mothers out there and I hope you all had a fantastic day![Chapter 7] April felt herself falling asleep at her book. She didn't know how much more of this she could take. It was midnight and here she was in the campus library with Megan, slaving over their anatomy text books. Megan took a huge gulp of coffee before looking to April's fluttering eyes. \"Oh, no.\" April's eyes opened widely, obviously catching herself going to sleep, and half afraid of what Megan would do to her if she actually did fall asleep. \"You are not sleeping and leaving me to be alone with all of this.\" \"Megan,\" April yawned out. \"Don't you think we should call it a night? We still have all of tomorrow to study.\" \"No.\" Megan spoke obviously. \"I have a system of studying like an insane person two days before the test, sleeping the whole day before the test to wake up refreshed while all I did was dream of the information I studied to pass the test.\" April shook her head after listening to that entire speech. \"You've got issues, dude.\" \"Sleep is for the weak.\" She told her seriously before looking back down at her book. \"Okay.\" April spoke, putting her book back in her bag. \"While you do that, I'm going to be sleeping.\" Megan didn't even look up to see April off. \"Have fun struggling during that test then.\" \"Goodnight, Megan!\" April called with a bit of a wave as she made it out of the library doors. When she got out the door, there was Roma, patiently waiting for her to leave the library. \"Sorry.\" She apologized as he put his hand on her back, guiding her to the car. \"No worries.\" He promised as he opened up the car door for her with a big smile. As April sat in the back seat, her phone vibrated, she expected it to be Megan, gloating to her about how she was going to pass the test while she failed, but it was Mike. How's the studying going :) April rolled her eyes, a smile spreading across her face. How did she just know he was going to mess with her about this? FINALLY going home. She put the phone back down, letting her head fall into the cushion, it just felt so comfortable at the moment. She almost felt herself drift off to sleep, but her phone vibrated again, causing her to pull it up to her face. Hurry up and get your ass to bed because we're studying all day tomorrow April sighed, hating that she would have to spend the entire day studying just for one test, but she wasn't one to disagree with Mike. Ye s, sir! And before she knew it, she was back home, immediately getting out of the car and falling asleep almost the second her head hit the pillow. Mike stood at April's door, crouched down so he could look Conner right in the eye. Conner had on every bit of protection he could find. A hockey mask, catcher mitts, he even duct taped pillows onto his front and back. \"Okay, you know what your job is?\" \"Bother April until she wakes up.\" \"Good boy.\" Mike agreed with a high five before Conner opened the door to April's room cautiously. They were both nervous. Messing with April while she was sleeping was like messing with a sleeping bear, they were just asking for trouble. But April had to pass this test. They knew they were doing the right thing, but once they woke April up, they knew it wouldn't feel like it. Conner brought up his hockey stick, slowly moving it to her sleeping body, taking a deep breath before gently poking her with it, keeping a safe distance. He heard her breathe deeply before rolling over to the other side of the bed. Conner gave Mike a panicked look, but he just signaled for him to keep on. Conner gave a deep sigh before trying again. When he poked her this time, her hand came out, knocking the stick out of his hand. Mike sighed as Conner looked to his only weapon lying on the other side of the room. That's when Mike moved forward, stripping all of the covers off the bed, holding onto them so she couldn't pull them back over her head. \"What the hell?!\" She screamed out, throwing her hands on the bed angrily as she rolled over to lie on her back. \"Get up.\" Mike spoke, turning to Conner with a happy smile. \"Get out of here before she kills you.\" Conner didn't wait another moment, running out before his sister could do anything to him. \"Why am I up?\" April asked, turning into the fetal position, trying to cuddle herself for warmth since she no longer had access to her comforter. \"Because you have the biggest test of your college career tomorrow.\" Mike spoke as he moved to her closet, pulling out some clothes for her. \"Put these on.\" He spoke throwing some clothes on her bed. She finally sat up, looking at the clothes for a moment before looking up at Mike with a disgusted face. \"Really? That top with those shorts?\" He gave her an irritated look before grabbing the clothes with a sigh and moving to her bathroom. \"This is stupid.\" She mumbled before slamming her door shut. \"You're stupid for not taking Megan's study advice.\" April cracked the door open to pop her head out, her bra straps the only visual that she had some type of clothing on. \"You wanted me to stay up all night and sleep all day?\" \"If it was going to get you to pass that test, I do.\" April rolled her eyes with a loud scoff before ducking back into the bathroom and closing the door. \"See, that's the problem with schools today.\" She spoke as she pulled on her shirt and Mike leaned against the wall in her room. \"It's not even about learning, it's about grades.\" \"You're damn right it is.\" Mike spoke just as she opened out the door fully clothed. She walked past him with a confused look on her face. \"Was it like that in Ireland or Scotland or wherever you're from?\" \"And I don't listen.\" He spoke with an eye roll. April turned to look at him with a smile on her face. \"You were born in Scotland, but you also say that you are part Irish, so…\" she got closer to him, wanting to get in his face. \"Ireland or Scotland…wherever you're from.\" Mike looked down at her, smiling just a little bit. She really was a fantastic listener and it seemed like she knew everything. Well, everything except college level anatomy. \"Let's get you to learning that anatomy.\" \"What do you know about anatomy?\" April asked while crossing her arms. He smiled, moving down to get the book off of her dresser. \"As long as I can read everything that this book has to say about it, you can learn it.\" April groaned into the book that she laid her head on in the dining room table. \"Come on.\" Mike spoke, lounged in his chair while stuffing Cheetos in his mouth. \"How do eccrine sweat glands differ from sebaceous glands?\" April finally picked up her head from the book, shaking her head at him. \"Do you even know?\" He shook his head at her. \"Not a damn clue, now answer the question.\" \"No.\" April told him defiantly making Mike raise his eyebrows at her tone. \"You know what, I don't want to.\" She slammed her notebook shut, crossing her arms at him. \"I'm dropping out.\" \"You're not dropping out.\" Mike retorted with a scoff, finding it hard to believe that he had pushed her that far. \"Oh, I am.\" She got up from the table and moved out of the dining room as Mike just sat there, dumbfounded at everything that just happened. \"Like hell you're not.\" He moved into the kitchen where she had gone, catching her going out of the other door. \"She just came in here and said she was dropping out.\" Monica told him as he just kept following her. \"Yeah, I'm working on it.\" He closed the door to the kitchen, moving into the foyer where he saw Conner standing there, watching April walk up the steps. Mike just barely saw the heel of her foot. \"Is April dropping out?\" Conner asked. \"Maybe.\" Mike spoke quickly, not looking at him, only focused on catching up with April. \"I mean no.\" Mike corrected, finally looking back to him. \"Conner, go to your room.\" Conner shrugged and hurried off, leaving them to figure it all out. When Mike came up the stairs, April was hurrying past the Oval Office her father was standing outside of. \"Did April just say she was dropping out?\" Ben asked as Mike hurried past him. \"She might, Ben!\" He yelled at him out of stress, half turned back to tell him, but more focused on catching up with her. As soon as he did catch up with her, though, she was slamming the door to her room shut. Mike moved to the door knob, but after twisting it a little bit, it wouldn't open. He pounded on the door a couple of times before calling out her name. \"What do you want from me?\" Mike asked. April pulled the door to her room open angrily, eyes fuming. \"I want you to let me study how I study. This whole forcing me crap is not going to work. I was not in the military, so do not treat me like I am.\" Mike gulped a little. The way she was talking to him freaked him out so he was going to do whatever she wanted him to do in that moment. Hell, she wasn't even using contractions. \"Okay.\" He spoke immediately without argument. If she was in the military, that would be one sight to see. They would command her to do something and she would put the fear of god into whoever did it. \"And even if it is your specialty, I don't need you to control everything. Just let me be in charge for one night and then you can do whatever you want.\" Mike stood there for a moment. It would be really hard not to be in charge for once, but he was going to do it for April. If it meant she was going to pass her class, he was going to do it for her. \"Okay.\" Mike sighed out while massaging his forehead. April leaned forward, giving him a kiss on the cheek before pulling him into her room for the two to study the night away. So, they did study for the entire night. When they finally fell asleep, Mike's arm was wrapped around April's shoulders and April was nuzzled into his chest with her hand lying over his heart. He was supposed to go home. He wasn't supposed to be there all night with April, but he did it for her because he knew this test was big to her. He could have gone home to be with his wife, but he stayed with her, and he wasn't going to leave until the moment she was confident she would pass that test, but they ended up falling asleep. April just stared at him after she woke up. She loved watching his chest rise and fall, and how soft all of his features were rather than seeing the years of damage in every inch. She loved the fact that he looked completely at peace in that moment, but she knew that in less than an hour, he would be up, driving her crazy like every other day. She wondered what he was dreaming about. If he ever thought about her how she was now thinking about him. Everything William and Megan had talked about all suddenly clicked. This attraction everyone was seeing. She didn't know about Mike, but she knew she had feelings for him. Watching him like that, leaving her alone with her thoughts, she knew William was right. She was in love with Mike. The realization happened so quick, there was no time to talk herself out of it or to see the logic not to be in love with him. It was an insane realization to suddenly feel like this. With everything she did, that love was going to be with her every step of the way whether he reciprocated it or not. Mike stirred a little bit, causing a small smile to spread on her face. That's when she leaned forward, planting a soft kiss on his cheek right next to his lips. He seemed to settle after that, making her smile even more. She didn't want to go. She wanted to stay in his embrace forever, but everything they did here would have been for nothing. She would do her all on that test just to make him proud, to show him that what they did had made a difference. She slowly moved out of his arms, making sure not to wake him before turning into her closet. God, she couldn't even focus on what to wear, all she could think about was Mike. As she got dressed, she kept looking at him. His suit was wrinkled from sleeping in it and his tie was at the foot of her bed. She remembered him taking it off right before they had fell asleep. His shoes were off in the corner by her window, making her smile, thinking about how he acted before he took them off. He said how scandalous it would be if the reporters caught sight of him taking his shoes off and getting on the president's daughter's bed. When she was finally dressed, she ripped a piece of paper from her journal and pulled out a pen, scribbling: I think you've earned the day, Banning. Thanks, April. She gave him one last look as she put the note on her pillow. She had no doubt about loving him. She knew she shouldn't have. He worked for her father and he was married, but she did. He shouldn't feel the way she did about him and she didn't expect him to, that's what hurt her the most about all of this, but she didn't want to think about that just yet. She wanted to have this moment burned into her brain forever, and it always would be as the moment she fell in love with Mike Banning. After the test, April had to leave without saying a word to Megan when that's all she wanted to do. She knew her phone was off so she decided she would leave her a message. As soon as she dialed her number, it went straight to voicemail, confirming her thoughts. Hey, this is Megan. You know what to do. April was thinking about it all over again so by the time the beep sounded, she let out a loving sigh. \"Megan, I really need to talk to you. Something…happened last night and you're the only one I can tell.\" She took a moment, thinking about it all over again as a huge smile spread across her face. \"Just give me a call when you get this.\" April hung up the phone and continued walking. It was something completely different being in love like this. As she walked through campus, it was like she was seeing everything in a new light. The sun was brighter, the trees were fuller, and she saw happiness on everyone's faces. When she finally made it into the back seat of her limo, O'Neil knew there was something up. There was something up with her from the moment she had walked out of her room in the morning. He didn't know what it was, but all of the secret service agents had a pool going on of what it could possibly be. When they finally got back to the White House, O'Neil opened the door up for her, April was still off in her own world, but one thing brought her back. The first thing she saw was Mike standing in the foyer in a fresh suit, hands clasped in front of him with a smirk on his face at the sight of her. Her breath hitched in her throat as she looked at him, not sure what to do at all. \"Welcome home, Miss. Asher.\" April settled on a smile as she moved past him and up the stairs. \"Thanks, Mike.\" As she walked up the stairs, she was freaking out with every fiber of her being. How was she supposed to act around him now? She needed Megan to answer her phone immediately. She needed advice and Megan was way more experienced in this love stuff than she was. She thought she was in love a few times, but after what she felt today, she realized that everything else was minimal to what she felt now. Once she was safe in her room, she leaned against her door, looking at her phone desperately. \"Megan, please listen to your messages.\" Megan parked her car drastically, greeted the man at the front desk, explaining that this was an emergency and she needed to see April immediately so he just gave her pass and let her in, he already knew who she was anyways. She ran into the front door, quickly greeting Mike and hurrying up the steps. \"Hi, Megan.\" Ben spoke with a smile as she hurried past him. \"Hey, Mr. Asher.\" She called over her shoulder. \"Can't talk right now.\" Ben watched as she hurried into his daughter's room and shut the door. He shook his head as Maggie came up right next to him. \"What was that about?\" \"I don't know.\" Ben spoke, looking over at his wife. \"But Megan needs to be timed next time she runs up to April's room like that. I want to know how long it really takes her.\" Maggie rolled her eyes at her husband before giving him a quick peck on the cheek. Megan looked to April once she shut the door, finding April sitting on the floor right by her bed, taking deep breaths while chewing on her nail. \"Oh my god.\" Megan simply spoke. \"I know.\" April spoke, half moving her thumb nail so her voice was more audible, but it was still in her mouth. Megan moved to sit down across from her, putting her hands on her head, the text April sent burned into her eyes. \"Oh my god.\" She spoke slower. \"I know.\" April almost cried out. Megan straightened up as April pulled down a pillow from her bed, gripping it to her chest. \"Okay,\" Megan spoke calmly. \"We've got to think about this rationally.\" She looked to her, clutching her pillow, knowing poor April had it bad. \"Have you told him?\" April looked to her best friend like she was insane. \"Okay, I'll take that as a no.\" April shut her eyes while shaking her head. \"How could I?\" Megan sighed, this time when she got down, sitting right next to her. \"Would it really be so bad to tell him?\" April turned to look at Megan, starting to feel the downside of love people were talking about. She was feeling heartache. \"He has a wife, Megan. He works for my dad.\" April positioned herself so she was facing her best friend. \"Mike can never know about this.\" Megan put her hand on April's arm, staring right into her eyes. \"But what about you?\" April bit her lip to keep from crying as she shrugged, not wanting to say anymore. Megan immediately pulled her in for a hug, letting her cry all she could on her. Megan looked all around her room, hardly believing that it all happened in this room. A part of April's life just changed today, and as quick as it all started, it was ending. Mrs. HappyAnarchy: I plan on making Megan a true friend so we don't have anything to worry about there. Oh, and the first blank response from the last chapter was your response. I don't know why your name didn't show up. It just didn't save like that. Sorry! NGArmyWife: Thank you, love! So, this is going to be part one in the story line of April realizing she's in love with Mike. I'm trying to capture all the good and bad that comes with falling in love with people you shouldn't, so I hope you guys liked this chapter, and let me know what you think![Chapter 8] July April looked at the two different dresses hanging up in her closet, trying to decide which dress matched her better. \"I pick the pink one.\" Megan spoke, lounged on her bed. \"You know how I feel about pink.\" She spoke, looking to her best friend in the mirror. \"Okay,\" Megan spoke looking around at the room. \"Your entire room is pink.\" \"Yeah,\" Mike spoke, walking into the room. \"She didn't pick it.\" April immediately shut her closet doors, not wanting him to see her dress options before turning around. It had been super awkward since she had realized her true feelings for Mike. She didn't want to see him or talk to him because every time she did, she remembered how ridiculously in love with him she was and when she thought about how it could never happen, it was like cupid himself gave her a blow to the gut. Megan sat up, looking back and forth from the two, wondering how this was going to play out. Mike didn't know what to think about any of this. It all happened so fast. One day she was normal, happy April, but now she was just…different. He missed his best friend. \"Umm,\" Mike put his hand to the back of his neck, rubbing it self-consciously. \"Dinner will be ready in an hour.\" \"Cool.\" Mike didn't know why she was being so short, but he wasn't going to question it. Megan continued to look back and forth between the two. \"Thanks.\" Mike gave her a slight smile, and walked out, shutting the door behind him. \"Dude!\" Megan exclaimed. \"The sad thing is that wasn't even the most awkward encounter you two have had this week.\" April groaned, throwing herself down on the bed with her face in her hands. \"I know!\" Megan sat up as April rolled onto her stomach, letting out desperate whines. \"You need to tell him.\" April sat up immediately, almost hitting Megan in the lip with her head. \"Yeah, ruining his entire career and marriage in the process.\" She threw herself back down on the bed after her sarcastic remark, whining again. \"Well,\" Megan spoke, not really knowing what to say to her in that moment. That's when something clicked. \"Okay, what if there was a way to for you to, in a way, get Mike out of your system?\" April sat up, looking at her best friend with a confused glance. \"How?\" Megan sighed, giving her a bit of a shrug, the idea still just swimming in her head. \"I'm not saying you're gonna fall out of love with him, but if you sleep with someone else, maybe it will settle the feelings just a little bit.\" April propped her head up on her elbow, looking up at Megan in the eye. \"So, you want me to have meaningless sex?\" \"I mean,\" Megan spoke, getting closer to her, not wanting to talk too loud in fear that anyone else would hear. \"It might balance it out.\" She shrugged, not sure if she was pushing April in the best direction, but she just didn't want her to hurt anymore. \"It'll take out the awkwardness.\" April bit her lip, mulling the idea over. It would kind of make sense. She looked Megan in the eye, wondering when she expected for her to get this done. \"When?\" \"Tomorrow.\" \"At the Independence Day Ball?\" April almost chuckled out. \"When are you going to meet tipsy people willing to sleep with the President's daughter anytime soon?\" April looked at her blankly for a few seconds. \"You do realize we're in college, right?\" \"Do you want it to happen fast or not?\" She let out a deep sigh, knowing that she was right. The quicker they got over this awkwardness, the faster she could move on with her life. \"Fine. I'll do it tomorrow.\" Mike fixed his bow tie in front of the mirror, looking over his suit again. No matter how many times he ran the security procedures or exits through his head, his mind kept going back to one thing. April and how weird she had been acting this past week. He was hoping it was just the nerves of her first Independence Day Ball going perfectly and then after that, she would go back to normal. \"Hey,\" Leah spoke, appearing right behind him with an American flag shirt and white shorts. \"You should get going.\" She was wondering what was going on with Mike. Ever since April started acting up, he did. \"Yeah.\" He sighed, hating how his tie was ending up, but was just tired of fixing it. Leah was worried about him, but she didn't want to ask him about it either. \"Don't wait up.\" He spoke simply as he walked out of their bedroom. \"Be careful.\" She settled on. Mike heard her, but he just didn't have the energy to respond. So, for the first time, he left the house without telling her he loved her. That didn't really register to him, though. The only thing that was running through his mind was April. Was she okay? Would she get back to normal ever again? He didn't know, but he knew that seeing her happy and smiling today would be the best part of it. April looked over her dress one more time, wondering if she really did make the right decision. This was her first Independence Day Ball. She wanted it to be a success. She also thought back to what she had to do tonight. If she was going to be able to continue her friendship with Mike, she was going to have to do this. She didn't want to, but she knew she needed to. There was a knock on her door, but she just kept looking at herself. She wasn't proud and because of that, she found herself almost disgusting. \"Come in.\" She called, her voice obviously weak. Her mother opened the door, peaking her head in, her mouth dropping when she got a full view of her daughter. \"Look at you.\" She commented, moving towards her daughter, April looking up at her amazing mother in the mirror. \"Every guy is going to want a piece of you.\" Maggie's hands went on her daughter's shoulders as April let out a light chuckle. \"And your father is going to hate that.\" April smiled to her, but she just went to thinking about Mike again. She looked to her mother, hoping that she could talk to her about the topic without really telling her what was going on. \"Mom,\" she spoke slowly. Maggie looked to her, hoping this would be the moment that she would finally tell her what was going on. \"Do you remember the moment when you fell in love with Dad?\" She chuckled a little bit, while looking up in memory. \"Your father and I were in college and we had just ordered a pizza.\" April's eyebrows knitted in confusion. \"You fell in love with him over a pizza.\" Maggie lightly tugged on her daughter's hair to get her to look up. \"I'm not done yet.\" April looked back to the mirror, watching her mother's face as she thought back on the moment. \"They forgot the ranch, which you know I can't have pizza without.\" \"Obviously.\" April spoke with a shrug, inheriting that habit from her mother. \"I told him it was no big deal and we went to go watch a movie, but your father disappeared a little bit into the movie.\" April shrugged, looking at her mother. \"Where'd he go?\" Maggie looked to her daughter, hoping that one day she would be able to find a guy as great as her dad. \"He walked through the stinging snow to the pizza place to get me ranch.\" April's mouth dropped a little, looking at her mother's face. Maggie nodded, sharing her impressment. \"Go Dad.\" April commented. Maggie nodded a little more. \"And that's when I knew that if he was willing to go out into practically a blizzard for me, I had found the right guy.\" April thought back onto her realization, remembering how amazing it felt, but she thought back on the panic as well. \"You weren't scared that he didn't love you back? Or maybe something would happen and you two couldn't be together?\" Maggie looked to her daughter, not getting a confirmation, but she somehow knew exactly who she was talking about. \"Honey, if you're meant to be with someone, no matter how long it takes, you're going to end up with that person.\" April looked at herself, completely rethinking her plan for the night. How could she sleep with someone when she was in love with Mike? She hated feeling like this, though. She wanted that feeling gone. \"Now,\" Maggie spoke, clapping her daughter on the shoulders. \"Let's get down to the party.\" She smiled at her mother, but honestly April had never been more confused. Mike was standing towards the back of the lawn, keeping an eye on everything around. The hedges were cut high enough so no paparazzi could get pictures of the party while lanterns scattered the floor and strands of lightbulbs were hanging from the nearby trees. Everyone around was dressed in a sea of elegant red, white and blue except the Secret Service men. Even Lynne Jacobs was dressed up in a little red dress. Mike gave Lynne a polite nod as she walked past him, but when his eyes went back to the front, he saw April walk into the party. His mouth practically dropped. She was wearing a blue, backless halter dress with a long red bow at her waist. Her hair was up in a loose, but well done bun while diamonds decorated her neck and ears. Her face was made up to perfection, finishing it off with a bright red lipstick. She seemed to turn all the heads when she walked in, but Mike felt like he had been looking in that direction before everyone else had found it. She walked down the first few steps, showing her white, strappy heels causing Mike to smile just a little bit. He was finding it hard to believe that she had found her bearings in those things. April was looking around, trying to measure all the people who had showed up, but mostly to find out how she was going to entertain herself through this whole thing. That's when she saw Mike looking at her, and for the first time since she had found out her true feelings, she didn't look away or try to run off to avoid the awkwardness, she was filled with happiness. A big smile spread across her face. When she looked at him, she felt like she had her best friend again. In that moment, she didn't care if her and Mike could never be together, but as long as she had him by her side through it all, it was just as good as having him as her lover. She snuck away from all the people surrounding her, weaved her way through the crowds and ending up hurrying to stand right next to Mike. \"You couldn't have helped me escape?\" She asked, standing to his right, trying to blend in next to him as best as she could. \"I was dying over there.\" When Mike looked at her, he saw someone completely different. Someone a little more than a best friend. The party dragged on, April finding it all mind numbingly boring. At the moment, her mother was showing her off to some of the more important members of Congress. \"April has always been a marvelous singer.\" April smiled just a little bit, completely annoyed with all these people she was meeting. \"April,\" she spoke, bringing April back into the conversation. \"Why don't you audition for the school choir?\" \"I don't know why I don't audition for the school choir.\" April spoke in a bland voice. Her mother gave her an irritated stare before going back to talking to the senator. She looked around, measuring the look on everyone's faces. Everyone looked so bored. To be honest, this wasn't how she expected the ball to go. She thought it was going to be fun, but then again, this entire presidency wasn't exactly what she thought it was going to be. Especially the music. Her eyes widened at the wrong key the violin was playing for the twelfth time. She was keeping track and it was exasperating. That's when she got an idea. She looked to the conversation that was going on with bright eyes. \"If you guys will excuse me, I will be right back.\" April didn't even wait for a response before hurrying off. She immediately hurried to Mike, but before she could ask him a question, she grabbed him by the hand, pulling him into the house. \"I need your help.\" Was all she said before pulling him up the stairs and into her bedroom. \"April, what the hell are you doing?\" Mike asked as she fished out her iPod and the speaker for it. She looked to him like it was the most obvious thing in the world. \"I'm livening up the party, what does it look like I'm doing?\" She hurried past him as Mike just watched her hurry off. \"April,\" he spoke in a warning, whispered tone before hurrying off after her. \"Oh, come on, scaredy cat.\" She taunted, turning around to look at him before hurrying to the steps. Mike smiled, rolling his eyes at her before following her down the steps. They went through a less conspicuous door into the garden, closer to the stage so they could set everything up. Once they were done, April scrolled through her iPod, found the perfect song, plugged it in and hurried away so no one would suspect it was them. Shortly after, the music came blasting through the speakers, making her giddy. She looked around at the crowd that surrounded her, convincing them to get to the dance floor. \"Come on,\" she encouraged while pulling her heels off. \"Take off your shoes.\" A lot of people around her followed along while others looked confused. As soon as the ones who followed her got on the dance floor, they were all laughing and obviously having fun. Conner pushed his way to get to his sister, dancing with her. April crouched down so he could twirl her and she twirled him, causing Ben and Maggie to smile. They all knew this was April's doing, and they didn't totally approve of her going behind everyone's backs to change the music, but just the song made the party exponentially better. Mostly because it wasn't off key. As everyone saw them dancing, almost the entire party was on the dance floor. Senators all over were dancing like they were kids, even her parents were lost in each other dancing and the song wasn't even through the chorus yet. April looked around, feeling like something was missing. That's when she noticed Mike off to the side just watching everything. She rolled her eyes at him, hurrying to his side and grabbing his hand. \"Come on.\" \"No.\" He protested trying to pull against her. \"Oh my gosh, Mike,\" April scolded, getting into his face. \"For once in your life, have fun just once.\" Mike let out a flustered sigh which she just smiled to as she pulled him onto the dance floor with her. They were in the middle of the floor, April grabbing Mike's hands, swaying with him, trying to get him to loosen up just a little bit. Mike was laughing the entire time, making April think back to her feelings for Mike. This could work out. They could be friends while she was in love with him. It could really work out. Once Mike had finally gotten looser without her guiding him, she let go of his hands, the two still dancing in almost perfect synch. April began twirling in front of him, making Mike smile. She just didn't know how bright she shined. She knew how important she was, it was hard not to when you were surrounded by body guards, but she just didn't know that she was the absolute light of Mike's life. This whole week was completely agonizing to him, it led him to think about what life would be without her. That's when he pulled her to him, gliding across the entire dance floor with her. He twirled her around, even put in a few complicated dance steps, taking April by surprise. She was almost out of breath when his arm ended up around her shoulder and the two were side to side. \"Where the hell did you learn how to dance?\" Mike shrugged, giving her that signature Mike Banning smile. \"My mother enrolled in ballroom dance lessons.\" April laughed, making him even happier in that moment if it was possible. He twirled her out of his arms, and as soon as he pulled her back in, they locked eyes and the music just seemed to fade into the background. They shared a millisecond of passion before fireworks exploded above their head. April looked up in wonderment as an array of red and blue showered over her head. Mike was also distracted by a sight, but it wasn't the fireworks. It was the way April was looking up at the fireworks. She had so much excitement and pureness on her face. And that was the moment it hit Mike. He was in love with her. He was insanely and undoubtedly in love with her. There was no other explanation. What he was feeling all week, that was heartbreak and when he finally got her back, he was feeling love. But this, right here in this moment, this was the most euphoric feeling around. He knew why she was every thought surrounding his mind and why he was so attached to her from the moment she got there. This entire time, he was trying to piece it together, but it was right there in front of his eyes. He loved her. Her eyes went from the fireworks, back to him, resulting in a big smile on her face, making Mike's heart melt just looking at her. She laughed a little, making him so happy he felt like he could cry. Why did it take him so long? They could have saved so much time. Did she even feel the same away about him that he did about her? It was a scary thought, but to be this close to her and to have that moment of her wonder filled face burned into his memory for the rest of his life, it was all worth it. Mike slowly walked into his house, removing the blazer he was wearing and hanging it on the coat rack while working on getting his tie undone. As he was doing that act, his mind just wondered. Everything felt so different now. It was like he was woken from a dream and harshly thrown into reality. It was scary and exciting, but he mostly didn't know how to handle any of it. He spent a moment just standing there after he had gotten his tie off, mulling it all over. He loved April and he didn't know what to do about it. He shouldn't be spending as much time with her, but if they were apart, he didn't know what he would do with himself. He wouldn't be able to do his job and life would just be a useless empty space of crippling hurt. But he was married. Leah was waiting in their bed for him right now. He rubbed his hands to his face, his brain still processing this monumental revelation. Now that he thought of Leah and April side by side, there was no comparison. Leah had just become a routine. She had been for a while now. He didn't love her. Well, not like he loved April. \"Mike!\" he heard from the bedroom. \"Is that you?\" He took a very deep breath. How was he supposed to lie in bed next to her when he just found out he didn't love her like they both thought he did. \"Yeah.\" He spoke, knowing he had to say something back. \"I'll be in there in a sec.\" He continued to stand there, knowing what he had to do. Tonight, he couldn't do anything, but tomorrow, he had to tell April. Talk to her. Find out if she felt the same way he did. Right now, he had to pretend everything was okay. Go to sleep. Be haunted by beautiful dreams of April. Mike hurried down the hallway to April's bedroom door. One of the night agents was still there. The sun hadn't even come up yet, but Mike couldn't waste one minute. He had to talk to April. There was no way he could wait, mostly because he knew he would try to talk himself out of it. He took a deep breath at her door, pacing in front of it, the agent standing there not wanting to listen, but couldn't help but overhear. \"April,\" he whispered, rehearsing what he was going to say. \"Last night was amazing and while we were close, I really wanted to keep that closeness…\" He trailed off, shaking his head, hating how that sounded. With another deep breath and a turn, he started again. \"April, last night when we were close, I realized I wanted more of that, and I think we should try having more of that.\" Mike took another deep breath and settled his antsy feet before finally knocking on April's door. All these emotions were running through his mind and he felt like he couldn't breathe for a moment. When April finally opened the door, she looked flushed…almost panicked, and just like that, he could breathe again. \"Mike?\" she questioned, out of breath. \"What are you doing here?\" \"Are you okay?\" he asked immediately. She had a big smile on her face, proceeding with a nod. That's when he noticed that she was holding her quilt that went at the bottom of her comforter to her body. \"Yeah.\" He got a smile on his face, almost mimicking hers. \"Why are you so happy?\" She moved her head from side to side before opening her bedroom door all the way. Inside was a guy sound asleep in her bed. Mike's face completely dropped. He couldn't tell her. Not now. Not today. Not after this. April was just nineteen. He was in his late thirties and married. He was ready to walk in there and break off his marriage for her, but he suddenly couldn't. He couldn't tie her down like that. He wanted her to explore every inch of being young, and she couldn't do that with him. \"It's totally crazy.\" she spoke with the shake of the head as he nodded, trying not to show his heart was breaking at every word. \"We just started talking last night after you left and we both just really needed to let off steam.\" She shook her head, thinking about last night all over again. Mostly, she was happy that the awkwardness between her and Mike had simply melted away. Megan really was right. \"Will you help me sneak him out when he wakes up?\" Mike gulped while looking down. He had never felt this bad before. It was like someone had taken a sledge hammer and with all of their strength, threw it into his gut. \"Yeah.\" he finally spoke as best as he could. She turned her head to the side at his reaction. \"Are you okay?\" He finally looked up at her, giving her a slight smile. That was all he could manage at the moment. \"Yeah, just let me know what he wakes up.\" Mike began to walk off, April watching him as he went. \"Thank you.\" she called to him in her sweet voice, but Mike just kept walking. Usually, he would have something to say back to her, but he was too busy to think about how to help his aching heart. With a confused face, April walked back into her room. When she thought back on his reactions, she perceived them all as sad. She had to talk to him later to see if he really was okay. April was sure, though, she had never seen Mike like that. MisfitCarter: Ugh, I know! You don't understand how good it felt to finally write that. Also how good it was to write Mike realizing it too in this chapter! Hope you enjoyed, love! Mrs. HappyAnarchy: I agree, we could all use a Megan. Bih Lupin, Guest: I honestly can't write the movie! I'm getting there as fast as I can. We should get to the accident in the next few chapters, so there's something. Thanks for reading! Kagome409: Thanks for the review and the read, love! I told you guys I would get these up a lot quicker! Nothing is going Mike and April's way these days. Hopefully that will change soon. The next chapter is going to experience a bit of a time jump, so just warning you guys before you read the next chapter and it's suddenly November. I hope you all enjoyed and I hope you guys don't hate me too much after this chapter, I promise you it will all be reprimanded in the next. Remember to review and thanks so much for reading![Chapter 9] November April and Conner were leaned against the island in the kitchen, currently having a thumb war. \"Conner, you've gotta attack from the side.\" Mike advised while leaning against the short end of the island. \"You can't give him advice.\" April spoke as she looked over to Mike while Conner began trying to come at her from the side. \"I do as I please.\" He retorted causing an over exaggerated eye roll from her. Mike smiled, finding himself staring at her insanely concentrated face. It had been four months since Mike had found out his feelings for April, and he had been hiding it ever since. He convinced himself he was doing what was best for her, but every day, she did something to make him fall more in love. Just like her concentrated determination on winning this thumb war. April was having a similar dilemma. She was as close as she usually is with Mike, but every little thing they did was hurting her. She knew she had to stay away from it and if they ever got together, it would be more hurt than it was worth, but she couldn't help but love him at every sarcastic comment and every caring word. While April was thinking about all of this, Conner took that opportunity to take down April in the thumb war. \"What the hell?\" April spoke after he had her thumb down for three seconds. Conner let go, throwing his hands in the air in a triumph. \"I am the champion.\" April rolled her eyes at him before moving to the fridge. \"Whatever.\" Almost immediately, Ben came into the kitchen, looking around frantically. \"Where's April?\" he asked the two. April closed the fridge, raising her hand with a confused look on her face. \"I'm an April.\" \"April,\" he spoke as he moved towards her. \"How much do you love your grandmother?\" April turned her head to the side. \"You know I love her. Is Grandmother okay?\" \"Okay good,\" Ben spoke as he put his hands on her shoulders. \"Because she's bunking with you tonight.\" April stood there for a minute, realizing her father had tricked her. April turned around to see her father smiling next to Mike who had an even bigger smile on his face. \"What the hell?\" April whispered to herself. \"We have like a million other rooms.\" \"Your grandmother misses you.\" He said with a shrug. \"She wants to room with you.\" April let out an exaggerated sigh while looking over to Conner. \"Why can't she bunk with Conner?\" Ben moved forward, looking at his daughter. \"She wants some girl bonding time.\" He explained as April looked over to Mike in hopes for help which he just shrugged to. \"And she's your grandmother, you don't know how many years you have left with her.\" \"Ugh,\" she groaned, shaking her head at her father. \"Don't pull that on me.\" Ben gave her a smile before patting her on the arm. \"Your grandmother is bunking with you for the night.\" Once Ben walked out of the kitchen, April looking to Mike. \"You gave him that idea, didn't you?\" Mike gave her a smirk and a shrug. \"Maybe.\" \"So, you and Grams are bunking?\" Megan asked through the phone. \"It looks like it.\" April spoke as she painted her nails, inspecting how the color looked in the light before deciding to paint the rest of her hand. \"Well,\" Megan spoke as she watched her cousins run around the couch she was sitting on. \"At least it's better than being at my aunt's house with my five boy cousins.\" \"Ugh,\" April groaned as she continued to paint her nails. \"Why did you have to go see your family for Thanksgiving?\" \"I don't know.\" She spoke, finally getting up to get away from her loud cousins. \"I would much rather be in DC with you meeting Grandmother.\" She tried to sound as fancy as she could when saying \"Grandmother\" knowing that was the only thing April called her. April chuckled a little bit, but then she heard Megan's mom in the background. \"Oh, is that April Asher? Tell her I said hi.\" \"Mom,\" Megan groaned. \"Hey, Mrs. Goodnight.\" April spoke into the phone. \"She said 'hey', Mom.\" \"She's such a sweet girl.\" April continued to laugh, hearing Megan's mom continue to talk about April to her sister. \"Megan's best friends with the President's daughter.\" \"Okay,\" Megan spoke into the phone. \"I'm leaving the room before the two get into a bragging battle.\" Once the door finally shut, Megan got closer to the phone. \"So, what's going on with you and Mike?\" \"Nothing.\" April spoke in an annoyed tone. \"Why not?\" Megan asked slightly annoyed. \"You tried the whole sleeping with someone else thing and you still had feelings for him the next day. If it was me, I would be all over that.\" As this conversation was going on, O'Neil was passing by her room, but he couldn't help but hear April's voice carry out the door. \"He's a secret service agent, Megan. He works for my dad and he's much older than me. It could never work out between us.\" O'Neil straightened out a little bit, taking all that he heard in. April had a crush on one of the secret service agents. He looked around, knowing he had to tell the next agent he saw because they were going to get to the bottom of this. \"Oh, it's gotta be me.\" Forbes claimed while the whole group stood in the hallway, waiting on the Ben's mother's arrival. \"Why does it have to be you?\" Diaz questioned with a slight eye roll. \"Because I'm the hottest one out of all of you.\" Forbes spoke in an obvious tone. Roma rolled his eyes with a bit of a smile. \"Oh, what?\" Forbes pressed on. \"You think it's you?\" \"I most definitely do not think it's me.\" Roma spoke while laughing. He would never be able to think of April that way. \"She's hot.\" Forbes said with a shrug. \"Really, dude?\" O'Neil asked. \"Oh, come on.\" Forbes spoke while hitting his arm. \"You can't tell me April's not hot.\" No one made eye contact with Forbes after that statement. None of them around could think of April that way, that's what was making the crush so scandalous to them. \"I'd do her.\" Forbes said with a shrug. They all groaned and asked Forbes to stop as he just laughed. That's when Mike approached. \"Hey,\" O'Neil spoke. \"Maybe Mike knows. He's the one who spends the most time with her.\" Mike looked to them all as they all turned to him with an interested look on their faces. \"'Maybe Mike knows' what?\" Forbes leaned in, not wanting anyone else to pick up on their conversation. \"Word has it that April's got a crush on one of the members of the Secret Service.\" \"Shut up.\" Mike laughed out. \"I'm serious.\" He told him with a shrug. \"O'Neil heard her talking about it on the phone.\" Secretly, Mike got giddy. He was hoping it was him. Maybe if the feeling was mutual, they would be able to do something about it. \"So, let me guess,\" Mike spoke, looking around at the group. He just knew these guys too well. \"You're all standing around here like idiots trying to find out who it is.\" They were all quiet for a moment when Diaz spoke up. \"Maybe it's Erikson.\" They all spoke in a chorus of agreements, able to see that pairing. Mike just rolled his eyes at them all, a smile coming at the corner of his mouth. \"What are you guys talking about?\" They all got immediately quiet, fear in their eyes as they turned around to see April at the bottom of the stairs. She gave them all a strange look as they turned to her. \"What's wrong with you guys?\" \"Nothing.\" They all spoke in unison. Her eyebrows furrowed as she took a turn looking at all of them individually. \"Weirdos.\" She commented before hurrying past them to get into the kitchen. All of the men looked at each other, knowing they had to get to the bottom of this. They wouldn't be able to focus on anything else. They all hurried off after her, catching her just as she stole a bit of cranberry sauce from Monica. The two girls looked at all the agents, wondering what the hell was going on. \"What?\" April finally asked, mouth half full. Mike thought it was extremely cute. \"Nothing.\" Roma spoke, initiating the accusations. \"There's just a rumor going around.\" \"What rumor?\" Monica questioned. She knew she was the first to hear about all the rumors in the White House, and she hadn't heard anything. \"That April has a crush on one of the secret service agents.\" Forbes spoke, winking after speaking. April's eyes got wide like a deer in the headlights, not sure what to do. They knew. Mike knew. It wouldn't be too long until her dad knew. \"So, come on, April,\" Mike spoke, giving her a little smile. April felt her heart pounding in her chest. They were gonna make her say it out loud in front of all of them. \"Who is it?\" April had to blink a little bit after she heard what he asked. They had no idea she was in love with Mike. She felt her heartbeats slow down a little bit as she let out a little sigh. \"Look,\" Forbes spoke, throwing his hands up in the air. \"If it's me, just let me know and confirm to these guys that I'm the hottest one out of the bunch.\" \"Shut up, Forbes.\" Roma spoke with an eye roll. April rolled her eyes at them all with a smile. \"Why does it even matter?\" \"Because we want to know.\" O'Neil spoke obviously. They all spoke in agreements, making April turn to Monica. \"Why are guys so relentless?\" \"Come on, April,\" Diaz spoke with a shrug, wanting to know who it was just as much as the rest of them. \"Just tell us who it is.\" \"No because this is dumb.\" April spoke with an eye roll. She was starting to get mad at their badgering. \"April,\" Forbes spoke in a calm voice, moving even closer to her, making her roll her eyes yet again. \"As soon as you talk, we can get back to Thanksgiving.\" \"I don't think she wants to talk about it, guys.\" Monica spoke, putting her hands on April's shoulders. \"It takes two seconds.\" Mike spoke, moving closer to her, honestly hoping it was him. \"Fine!\" April suddenly exploded, taking them all by surprise. She was just getting so flustered and Mike asking just pushed her to the top. \"You guys really want to know?!\" She opened her mouth and stuttered until she finally came with a fake answer. \"Forbes!\" After that, she turned on her heels and hurried off, not wanting to talk to anyone else. Monica looked at the guys, obviously pissed and everyone was completely quiet. Well, until Forbes thought back on what she said. \"I fucking told you guys.\" Roma rolled his eyes as he shook his head at him. \"Shut up, Forbes.\" April was sitting in the Lincoln Bedroom, trying to get away from everyone. The touring part of the White House was closed, so for the first time in a while, she didn't have to worry about tourists going through her house and trying to find out everything about her. She was mad at everyone. She was mad at Diaz and O'Neil for not letting it to. She was mad at Roma for letting it go on for as long as it did. She was mad at Forbes for being cocky enough to think that she actually liked him. Most of all, she was mad at Mike for being the one to push her over the edge. The hardest part was that it was really him she loved. And he would never know it. She heard the door open and close behind her, making her jump. When she turned around, she saw it was Mike, causing her to roll her eyes and turn back to look at her hand. \"What do you want?\" Mike sighed when he saw her, feeling awful. The guys had teased her and teased her until she cracked and he knew this had to be a sensitive subject for her. It was for him. \"Can we talk?\" \"I don't know,\" she asked, halfway turning around. \"Are you gonna be a complete douche and interview me on how long I've had a crush on Forbes?\" \"Okay,\" Mike spoke, sitting down next to her, looking at her face as April rolled her eyes, crossing her arms in front of her chest, not wanting to look at him. \"I'm a dick.\" April scoffed at the act that he was finally admitting it. She had never been so angry with him and it didn't make sense to be mad at him the most. She should have been mad at them all the same amount. She didn't know why she was the maddest at Mike. \"Really?\" She asked, turning to him, her voice dripping with sarcasm. \"I had no idea.\" He bumped into her, causing her to give him a little smile. \"Don't be an ass about it.\" He smile to her, causing her to look away a bit in a blush. And just like that, her anger had disintegrated. \"I'm apologizing.\" When he looked at April, he thought back to the moment he fell in love and how much it hurt him that she didn't love him back. \"I honestly never would have thought Forbes was your big crush.\" April rolled her eyes at all of this going on. If only he knew. \"Yup.\" \"When did that start?\" Mike honestly wanted to get as much information out of her as he could. April sighed, finding herself look to the left, knowing Mike of all people was going to pick up on that. \"Um, like four months ago, I don't know.\" Mike began to scrunch his eyebrows together, not understanding where this weird behavior was coming from. \"You don't know?\" April just shrugged, really trying not to look at him. \"Then why did you look to the left when telling me that while also pulling on your ear.\" April blinked a couple of times. She knew looking to the left was a basic lying tell, but touching her ear was her specific tell. She didn't even know she had used it. \"I saw a bug and I felt it buzz in my ear.\" She lied again. \"Bullshit.\" Mike spoke, moving his stance to look her right in the eye. \"You're lying.\" he spoke with the shake of the head, a small smirk growing from catching her lie. \"So what if I am?\" April asked defensively while standing up, Mike following her lead, almost like it was a challenge. \"I think you're lying about the whole Forbes thing so everyone can get off your back.\" April was fuming, not wanting to spill her secret, but also getting mad that he was in her face. \"Get out of the way, Mike.\" Mike's smile just got bigger, he loved making her mad, but he also had hope that he was the one. \"Not until you tell me who it is.\" \"Mike!\" \"April, tell me who you like.\" \"You!\" She screamed suddenly. \"I like you, okay?!\" Mike was frozen for a moment and so was April as the air had filled with sticky silence. She had finally said it while Mike finally had what he wanted. April sighed, trying to hurry past him, but Mike just couldn't let her. Not after everything he had been through in these past four months. The second her hand touched the door knob, Mike grabbed the hand by her side, pulling him to her, their lips crashing together in a hungry, animalistic first kiss. April didn't expect it, but she wasn't going to stop it. Not when everything she wanted was playing out before her. Mike's tongue danced in her mouth and it was even better than she had imagined it. Mike couldn't believe that he was doing this. This was his boss's daughter. If anyone found out about this, he would be fired. It all felt so right, though. April fit into his body better than Leah ever had. When April pulled away from Mike, she began working on removing his coat and bowtie. \"Wait,\" Mike spoke, looking to April, getting her to stop for a moment. \"Are you sure?\" April began to laugh slightly, Mike simply making her breathless. \"Mike, I broke up with William for you, and have been in love with you since the moment we argued at the entrance of the White House. I've never been surer of anything.\" She moved to take off his clothes again, but he stopped her. \"You love me?\" April was quiet for a moment, scared she ruined everything. Maybe Mike was just in lust with her. Maybe he just did this in a moment of passion. Mike noticed the change of her face, making him know he had to tell her. He moved closer to her face, making sure she could see every inch of it. \"Because I love you .\" April looked up at him, feeling her heart flutter. \"Yeah,\" she practically whispered. This wasn't how she was expecting to say it at all. She wasn't really sure how she expected it, but she loved that it was actually happening. \"I love you.\" They moved to start kissing again, much slower this time, Mike making sure to touch every part of her body along the way of taking off her dress. He planted kisses and love bites all up her body, now realizing that he had wanted this from the start. He needed this from her, craved it, and they were both kicking themselves for wasting so much time. Just before the act started, Mike looked down at her, knowing that if they started this, everything would become new again. They would have each other, but they would have to keep it a secret from everyone. But as she smiled up at him, he knew it would all be worth it. Mike and April laid in the Lincoln Bedroom, heavy breathing taking over them both. Mike's arm was around April's shoulders as they both looked up at the ceiling, neither of them finding a need to put their tops back on. \"I don't think I can walk.\" April practically breathed out. Mike began laughing into her shoulder, taking a moment to look at the bareness of it before planting a kiss there. \"Am I that good?\" April gave him a tiny smirk. \"Maybe, maybe not.\" Really, that was the best sex she had ever had. Mike looked at her, letting the gravity of the situation sink in. \"We just had sex in the Lincoln Bedroom.\" \"Yeah.\" April laughed while shaking her head, hardly believing it like him. \"On Thanksgiving.\" April nodded again, laughs just trickling out of her throat. \"Yeah, my grandmother is probably in this house and we just had sex.\" They both laughed about the situation until they stopped, something kicking in to April. \"My grandmother is probably here.\" She hurried to her phone that was on the nightstand seeing that she had ample missed calls from both of her parents. \"Oh my god.\" April said as she bolted out of the bed. \"My dad is gonna kill me.\" She hurried to her clothes, putting them on as fast as she could while Mike followed her lead. \"You were with me.\" Mike spoke with a shrug. \"That's all we gotta tell them.\" \"Okay,\" she spoke looking at the room which was a complete disaster. \"But what were we doing?\" Mike looked around, so far just having his pants and shoes on, thinking about everything she was saying. \"You're smart. You'll figure something out.\" She rolled her eyes at Mike while putting her stockings back on, but he just got on the bed, taking his time to kiss her neck. \"Mike,\" she moaned. \"Stop.\" \"Would it really be so bad – \" \"Yes,\" she cut him off, already knowing what he was going to say. \"It would really be that bad to miss Thanksgiving dinner. My parents are probably already hunting for me.\" \"April?\" They both looked to each other with panicked eyes before their eyes darted to the door knob, assuring that it was locked. \"It's locked.\" Mike whispered to her, placing a hand on hers. \"We'll be fine.\" That's when the door opened up, April was all the way dressed, but Mike still didn't have his shirt on and they still had to make the bed. To make matters worse, the one who opened up the door was Forbes. He began to laugh, putting his hands on his hips. \"Oh, this is rich.\" Mike gave him an irritated look while putting on his shirt as April tucked her hair behind her ear, putting on her shoes. \"Shut up, Forbes.\" \"So, it's not me you have a crush on,\" Forbes began as Mike stood up to put on his bow tie and blazer while April began making the bed, trying to block him out as best as she could. \"You had a crush on Mikey.\" April rolled her eyes, Mike doing the same while helping out in making the bed. \"So, what Mike, you found this out and then you two jumped each other's bones?\" After finishing up the bed, both Mike and April straightened up, looking to each other, sharing a moment where they practically read each other's minds, trying to find out if they should tell him or not. After a few moments of just looking at each other, April threw up one of her crossed arms in a shrug. Mike finally turned to him, taking a deep breath before saying, \"We're in love.\" All the joking was off of Forbes face the second he heard that, his eyes widening slightly. Sure, he knew the two were close, but he just didn't expect that. April hurried over to Mike, looping her arm through his. \"And we would really appreciate it if you could keep this secret for us.\" Forbes sighed, looking at each of them individually before shrugging. \"What the hell? I'm retiring in two months anyway.\" April hurried to him, giving him a big hug. \"Just get down there, everyone's wondering where you two are.\" \"Thank you.\" April whispered to him as Mike grabbed her hand and pulled her out of the bedroom. Forbes looked around at the room, shaking his head at how easy it was to catch them. \"Amateurs.\" Mike and April let go of each other's hands once they got to the steps and hurried down them to see everyone waiting in the parlor. \"April!\" Grandmother Asher spoke, going straight for her. \"Hello, Grandmother!\" When she went to go hug her, Ben gave April that we'll-have-a-talk-later-that-you're-not-gonna-like look which she just nodded to, knowing it was going to happen. \"You just get more gorgeous,\" she spoke as she pulled away from April, April automatically blushing and shaking her head which Mike just smiled to. He just found it all very cute. And the fact that he loved her and she loved him back just made him very happy. \"Every time I see you.\" \"Where were you two?\" Maggie asked, standing up and going behind Grandmother Asher to look at her daughter and top secret service agent. \"Uh,\" Mike began as April turned around to look at him with an angry face. \"We thought we heard rats in the walls so we were inspecting.\" \"Rats?\" Maggie asked in shock and disgust. \"Cool.\" Conner spoke with a shrug. April gave her brother an irritated look while Ben brought her back into the conversation. \"Well, did you two find anything?\" \"Yeah.\" April spoke while looking back at Mike before looking back to her father. \"It was pretty big too.\" Mike smiled a little bit, knowing what she was getting at. \"At least six inches.\" \"Maybe bigger.\" Mike spoke confidently. April shook her head with her eyes shut. \"No, definitely six inches.\" \"Well,\" Ben spoke as April gave Mike a flirty smile. \"We'll check it out tomorrow, right now, let's get dinner started.\" Grandmother Asher put her arm around April's shoulders as the rest of them walked forward the two trailing behind with Mike at their tail. \"You know,\" her grandmother whispered in her ear. \"I love the glow of a woman who was just fucked.\" April immediately choked on her spit, never hearing that word come out of her grandmother before while Mike stood still. \"Oh, come on, you two.\" Grandmother Asher spoke while looking to them two, removing her arm from April's shoulders. \"Get it together or the whole family will know.\" She walked off, April turning back to Mike with wide eyes. \"I didn't know your grandmother was like that.\" \" I didn't know my grandmother was like that.\" She spoke in a panicked tone. Mike put his hand on her back, guiding her into the dining room, ready to have the most awkward Thanksgiving dinner on the planet. April sat on her bed with her grandmother. \"How did you know?\" She whispered, afraid that anyone outside could hear them like earlier today. \"Oh, I could tell by the look on your face.\" April held her favorite pillow to her chest, thinking about it all over again, making her smile. \"And by the way you two were talking.\" \"Grandmother,\" April spoke slowly. \"I think I'm in love with him.\" \"I could pick that up too.\" She spoke with a nod. April bit her lip as she smiled lightly at her words, thinking about Mike all over again. Thinking about how perfectly this was all working out. Never in her wildest dreams would she expect Mike to tell her he loved her back or that she would have the courage to tell him how she really felt. \"And I know he loves you.\" She looked back to her grandmother, taking deep breaths. \"Thanks, Grandmother.\" She looked to her granddaughter, completely confused on why she thanked her. \"For what, dear?\" April smiled to her, taking a deep breath before thinking on how to explain exactly what she was thanking her for. \"For bunking with me.\" Everyone was at the front entrance, saying goodbye to Grandmother Asher. The family talking to each other, Mike standing in the back just watching when Grandmother Asher came up to him. \"Ma'am.\" He spoke with a nod. \"Mike,\" she nodded back, the family continuing to talk, both of them watching. \"Take care of my son, Mike.\" \"I will, ma'am.\" \"And if you hurt my granddaughter – \" \"Trust me, ma'am,\" he told her with a laugh, his eyes not leaving April. \"That will never happen.\" \"Good.\" She spoke with a nod. \"Because if you do, I'm going after you.\" Mike laughed, eyes still trained on April. She was just so gorgeous, and he couldn't believe that he was worthy enough to deserve her love. He was a piece of crap, and he knew that, but to her, he was everything, and that just made him hate himself a little less. Mrs. HappyAnarchy: Ugh, I know!

Thanks for the read and remember to review![Chapter 10] December So, April had taken her mother's advice and joined the choir in her second semester, but not alone. She dragged Megan along with her. They were currently getting ready for their winter show, the guys running through their song as the girls were sitting in the audience, talking. Megan was especially talkative since she had just found out what happened between April and Mike. \"How was it?\" April let out a happy sigh, thinking about it all over again. \"It was amazing, Megan.\" \"I'm gone for one week.\" She complained. \"He's just so perfect.\" April sighed out. \"We just…belong together.\" Megan forgot about her frustration and just focused on her friend's happiness. \"I am so happy for you.\" April gave her a happy smile. \"Especially since I've been waiting for this to happen for four months.\" April gave her a look, but managed a smile through it. \"Girls,\" their choir director called in the loudest voice she could manage in the outdoor performing area. \"You're on in five.\" Megan and April stood together, moving the stage, April pulling her jacket closer to her, feeling the breeze pick up. \"Why do we have to perform outside?\" April complained. \"I heard it's gonna snow on the night of the concert.\" \"Lucky us.\" April spoke sarcastically as her phone buzzed. She pulled it out, immediately smiling at who the message was from. \"Is that your boyfriend?\" Megan taunted. April opened her mouth, about to say yes, but that's when she realized she didn't know what the title was for her and Mike. They were together, but they were also cheating on Leah. They were also keeping their relationship a secret. The only people who knew were her grandmother, Forbes and Megan. So, were they even technically together? \"So, what are you doing tonight?\" Megan asked, tearing April out of her thoughts. \"Oh,\" Those insecurities were just still running through April's head, though. \"I'm actually going out with Mike.\" \"Really?\" Megan spoke in an interested voice. \"Like on a real date?\" \"Our first.\" April spoke, playing with her necklace. \"Well,\" Megan spoke, moving closer to her best friend. \"I only have one bit of advice.\" April gave her a weird glance as Megan just continued with her smile. \"Don't kiss him on the first date.\" April shoved her forward as Megan advanced to the stage. \"Shut up.\" The cover was that April was spending the night at Megan's but really April and Mike were going to try this out. Mike was beyond ecstatic that they were going to spend the night out of the White House and go on a real date, but April was nervous. She kept thinking about what they were together. It was easy for Mike not to have any questions about it. It wasn't in his personality. He just followed his heart. April was more of a thinker, and lately, she was more of an over thinker. No matter how well they sugar coated what they were doing, they were still cheating, and deep down, even if April loved every second she had Mike, she felt guilty. April had spent hours trying on different outfits and doing her make up different ways to find the perfect look. She had finally settled on a white, lacey dress and tan booties with the same make up she did for the Independence Day Ball. She thought it was perfectly fitting. When she walked down the steps, Mike was there waiting for her. Her breath hitched in her throat when she saw him in his formal wear instead of the normal suit and tie. And he did it all for her. She had butterflies, and she didn't think she would be able to control them. She had already said goodbye to her mom and dad meaning her night belonged to Mike. Mike met her at the bottom of the stairs, taking her hand and leading her out the front door. For the first time in a long time, April was starting to feel like a normal girl. Not the president's daughter, but a girl going on a date with the man she loved. They weren't going in the normal limo or town car either, Mike drove. And it was good to sit in the front seat of a car again. The two laughed and talked on the way to the restaurant while listening to Elvis Castello, warming her heart until the warmth reached her entire body. When they parked at the back of the restaurant, that's when she got confused. \"What are we doing?\" she asked Mike as he began undoing his seatbelt. \"Well, we can't go through the front.\" April's face fell a little, thinking back on how they were in secret. \"Besides, I got us a private room in the back.\" His door opened and shut while he hurried to her side of the car. \"A private room?\" She repeated to herself. Mike opened up her door, April smiling at him, trying to forget all about it as he helped her out of the car. When they walked into the restaurant, they didn't see couples around also sharing a fancy night out. They didn't see business partners and old friends going out for drinks. The first thing they saw was the private room. April knew it was so no one would see them and she knew it was something they had to do, but at the same time, she didn't feel like a normal girl anymore. Mike guided her to her seat, pouring her a glass of champagne. \"Wow,\" she commented as he finished pouring her glass to the top. \"Don't I feel fancy?\" Mike looked to her once he was back in his seat, giving her a bit of a smile. \"This is really cheesy, isn't it?\" \"A little.\" She laughed out. \"I just really want this night to be perfect.\" He explained shyly. \"Mike,\" she spoke, reaching out for his hands which he gave to her without hesitation. \"I want you to know that I don't need a fancy dinner for a perfect night. I just need you.\" Mike stared at her for a moment before standing up abruptly. \"Do you wanna go get a burger and some beers?\" \"Please.\" She commented, taking his hand as he pulled her up. He began leading her out of the room, but April thought of something. \"Hold on.\" She told him, hurrying back to the table. She grabbed the champagne out of the cooler before hurrying back to him. \"April,\" he called as she hurried past him. \"We already paid for it.\" She whispered while the two hurried back to the car before anyone could notice they were gone. So Mike bought a six pack and two burgers and the two went back to Mike's house where they changed into something a lot more comfortable. Sweats and T-shirts. Leah was working the night shift so they didn't have to worry about her coming in any time soon. The two were just talking and eating and drinking. Nothing was off limits. They talked about the time in first grade when April got a concussion, leading to the moment she knew she wanted to be a nurse. They talked about Mike's drinking problem a while back and how he most definitely needed to cut back, leading to him joining the MI6 and eventually moving to America to be a secret service agent. They also got to talking about Mike's marriage and when it exactly ended. It happened a little before he and April had first met, Mike was eating breakfast with her one morning and it was complete silence. That's when he realized they had nothing to talk about anymore. He lost interest in what she said, their lives just didn't mesh anymore. They had ended up kind of just using each other for sex or whatever they wanted at that moment. He really did try to make it work, but you can't just force yourself to fall back in love with someone. Mike opened all the way up to her. After they were both feeling a little drunk, Mike took her into his room. April slowly slipped off her clothes first, Mike taking in every part of her body in that moment, even that little storm cloud tattoo. She was everything he had ever wanted and he knew that this would be different than it was with Leah. They laid on the bed, taking their time to make sure every bit of it could be as pleasurable as possible. It was passionate and slow, a lot different than the first time, but just as good. Maybe even better. When it was done, Mike was still on top of April, just staring at her face, rubbing his thumb along her cheek in soft circles as April held onto his arm like if she let go, she would lose him. \"I love you.\" She whispered as she looked at every little wrinkle on his face. She knew he hated them, but she loved every single one of them. \"I love you.\" He told her without hesitation before leaning down and placing a light kiss on her lips. \"I really do.\" He whispered, planting another kiss on her lips, making her start laughing as he began to plant countless kisses on her lips. \"Mike!\" April laughed out loudly, but stopped once they heard the door open. April gave him a panicked look, knowing that if Leah caught her here it would not be pretty. April got off of Mike, not knowing what to do for a minute. She immediately pulled his T-shirt off the floor, put it on and ran into the closet. Almost immediately after she was secured in the room, the bedroom door opened. \"Hey, baby.\" Leah called in a bland voice. \"Oh my gosh.\" April whispered, putting her hand to her mouth so her breathing wouldn't be heard. \"Hey, baby.\" Mike said right back. \"What are you doing here?\" \"I just came back to change out scrubs.\" She spoke, showing him the blood on them. \"What happened?\" He asked as she went to their dresser and Mike's eyes moved to the closet nervously. \"Shot wound vic.\" April breathed heavily into her palms as they shook, never being more scared of anything in her life. She began traveling to the laundry room to put her used scrubs in the washer, but April still couldn't move. \"Mike,\" Leah called out as she walked back into their bedroom. \"What are you doing already in bed?\" Mike shrugged, giving her a shy smile. \"I had a long day.\" \"Well, I'm probably not gonna be home until seven in the morning.\" \"I'll be at work by then.\" Mike spoke with a shrug. Leah climbed on the bed, moving toward his face. \"Maybe we could have a repeat of the other night.\" That's when she kissed him, but they both knew there wasn't any passion in it. Not from April's view, though. She saw her boyfriend…if you could even call him that, kissing his wife, letting it sink in that no matter what she and Mike felt for each other, she would always be the mistress. \"I gotta get back to saving people.\" She spoke with a shrug. \"Duty calls.\" He spoke with a shrug before she moved in to give him a peck on the lips. With that, Leah grabbed her purse off the floor and made her way out of the house. When April heard the door close, she jumped a little, feeling the shaking of the house wreak through her body. For a moment, she couldn't move. She was having an internal panic attack. Mike said he loved her, but he was still sleeping with Leah. Leah almost caught her fucking her husband on her own bed. All of April felt dirty after that, and all she could do was sit there and think about it. April slowly got up from her spot and opened up the closet doors, seeing Mike putting his underwear and sweatpants back on. \"April,\" he spoke slowly once he was done, starting to move towards her. \"I thought you said she wasn't coming home.\" April started, her voice dead and bland like a zombie. \"You said we had the whole night, the whole place to ourselves and nothing would happen.\" \"I didn't think she was going to come home to change her scrubs.\" He spoke, trying to reason with her. She simply shook her head at him, still looking dead. \"Look, baby – \" \"That's what you called Leah.\" April spoke with the shake of the head and a soft voice, looking down after that. Mike didn't know what to say to her, but he felt like his throat was swelling up. Like he wasn't able to breath. \"This whole night, you have been trying to hide me like I'm something dirty you don't want to be seen with.\" \"You know we can't be seen together, April. You knew what this was from the start.\" \"God!\" April screamed out, finally getting loud for the first time. \"What do you even call me? Your girlfriend? Your mistress?\" Mike tried to step forward, but she just shook her head at him, looking him right in the eye. \"You're still sleeping with Leah, aren't you?\" Mike just looked at her. He didn't want to lie, but he also didn't want to tell the truth, so he decided to remain silent. \"Oh, fucking rich.\" \"April,\" Mike spoke, finding it hard to talk again as she looked around the room for her things. \"You don't know what it's like to be married.\" \"You're right,\" she spoke as she sat on the bed to put her sweatpants back on. \"I don't.\" \"You have to have sex every now and then.\" He sat down right next to her after her pants were on, and all April could do was look at him. \"That's what you have to do as a married couple, even if you know the passion's gone. It's just a physical activity.\" \"That's the thing, Mike!\" She yelled, standing up. \"How do I not know that I'm just a physical activity if you can just do it anytime you want with Leah?\" Mike opened his mouth again, but April wasn't done. \"You said you loved me! You said I was different than Leah and you had been out of love with her for a long, long time!\" \"I do love you!\" Mike shouted, actually raising his voice at her, but April was going to raise it right back. \"Is that all I ever was to you?! A physical activity?!\" \"No!\" Mike was getting mad now. Mad that she would actually say that about him and how he felt about her. \"Never!\" \"Was I just some quest for you to defeat?\" \"What?!\" He had no idea where she had gotten that from. \"'Yeah,'\" she spoke, mimicking his accent as best as she could. \"'Let me just screw the president's daughter and we'll call it a grand time.'\" \"Okay,\" Mike spoke, trying to calm himself down. \"Now you're acting crazy.\" \"Am I really, though?\" She spoke as calm as she could, shrugging a little bit. \"Wouldn't you ask the same things if the roles were reversed?\" He was quiet, but April couldn't stop these tears she had been holding in for the entire fight. \"I don't think I can do this, Mike.\" He looked up at her, eyes wide at what she had said. \"April – \" \"We tried it.\" She said with a shrug as she began to back out of the room. \"And it just didn't work, so I'm leaving, Mike.\" April began to walk out of the room and down the hall to the front door. \"April!\" Mike called after her. He wasn't even mad anymore, he was just scared of her walking out like this. He ran past her, putting himself in front of the door. \"April, just take a minute to think about this.\" April bit her lip, knowing that no matter how she felt about him, no matter the fact that she loved him with all of her heart, she couldn't be with Mike. \"Maybe we'll work out again another time.\" She told him in a hoarse voice before pushing him out of the way and walking out of his house. She began down the first few steps, but she honestly couldn't take it. She sat down, throwing her face in her hands and crying out. She sat there for a few minutes, letting it all out before pulling out her phone and dialing Megan's number. So, Megan gave her a ride back home in the morning and that entire day, Mike and April avoided each other. They just found it easier that way. The next few days were some of the hardest of their life. It was like they had went backwards in their relationship with an additional ten pounds weighing them down. April wasn't eating. She could hardly sleep. Her mother noticed that Megan was coming over a lot more than usual and Mike was especially quiet. It was the night of the choir concert and everyone in the house was getting ready. No matter what happened, Mike was still on April's security detail, so while she was getting ready, Mike was standing outside her door. Maggie walked up to him with a bit of a smile. \"Ma'am,\" he told her with a nod. \"Hey, Mike.\" Mike looked to the door a little awkwardly before turning back to the First Lady. \"Do you want to go in and talk to April?\" \"No.\" She told him, smiling just a little brighter at the fact that she was finally going to be able to talk to Mike about something that had been swimming in her mind since July. \"I really want to talk to you.\" \"About what?\" he asked as he looked around the space they were in, wondering what on earth they were going to talk about outside of April's bedroom door. Maggie looked around for a moment, gathering what all she was going to say. \"I'm not a hundred percent sure what's going on right now, but I do have an idea.\" Mike turned his head to the side, wondering if she knew about him and April. \"My daughter is very complex, a lot like her father, but if you show her quite simply what you feel for her, she'll stick by your side through everything.\" Mike stood there for a moment, looking at Maggie who wore a bright smile. \"Are you saying you know – \" She shrugged and began to back off, hurrying down the stairs as Mike just continued to stand there, dumbfounded. April's ear was to the door, hearing everything her mother had said. She put a hand to her mouth, trying to keep herself from crying and laughing at the same time. Did everyone in the world ship her and Mike? April and Megan stood back stage, wearing their winter coats with how cold it was outside as they boys were performing their song. \"It wouldn't have killed her to have the concert indoors after finding out it was going to snow?\" Megan complained as she shivered. April, she wasn't really cold. She didn't feel a lot since her and Mike broke up, now being one time she was thankful for that. \"April?\" They both turned around, seeing Mike walk up to the two. April's mouth dropped slightly, shocked that he was even talking to her. She hadn't heard his voice in so long and it was like music to her ears. \"I'll give you two a minute.\" Megan spoke, keeping her eyes on her best friend until she got next to Mike. That's when she stared him down which Mike found kind of terrifying. Once Megan was gone, all they could do was look at each other. There was so much they wanted to say, but they didn't know how to say it. \"April,\" Mike spoke, moving toward her, closing the space between them, April just looking up at him, reminding Mike why he fell in love with her. \"Look, I shouldn't have continued to have sex with Leah, that's a mistake that I will do anything to fix, but I can't have us apart like this.\" April didn't know what to say to him. \"And I got these.\" He gave April folded up papers, April starting to unfold and look at them. \"They're divorce papers.\" April gave him a shocked face, not expecting that from him at all. \"I'm giving them to Leah when we get back from Camp David.\" April bit her lip, looking down slightly, not sure what to say to him or about any of this. \"It's gonna be messy and we might get our heart's broken along the way, but if that even means a second with you, I'm taking it. And yeah,\" Mike spoke with a laugh as April was watching him in wonderment. \"This love is probably gonna lead to the biggest scar I've ever had. It's probably gonna lead to tragedy and tears, but I love you and that's something that's never gonna change for as long as my wasted heart keeps beating.\" April smiled as she watched him, knowing in that moment, he was completely forgiven and she didn't want anyone else by her side. \"So, I've got one question for you…. Are you ready for the ride of your fucking life?\" April couldn't wait anymore. She got on her toes, giving him the best kiss she could as the dreaded snow began to fall, but April and Mike were completely warm. The snow melted the second it touched the two's lips, April smiling into the kiss as the flakes dissolved around them. The two had never been happier. As they kissed, Ben had made it backstage to give April flowers, but then he saw April and Mike. Part of him was glad because they had this obvious tension between the two, but the other part of him didn't know what to say about all of this. He was watching his little girl making out with the best worker he ever had. As the two pulled away from each other, Ben hurried off with his guards trailing him, going back to his seat with Maggie and Conner. Maggie saw the flowers still in Ben's had, furrowing her eyebrows at that. \"Why didn't you give April the flowers?\" Ben sighed, still confused at what he saw. \"April was tied up at the moment.\" After the concert, April and Mike went to go find the family, Maggie meeting her daughter in a large hug. \"Oh, honey, you wonderful.\" \"I was in the back.\" She told her in an obvious voice. \"Can we go eat now?\" Conner complained. \"Oh, please,\" April spoke, looking to her father, finally having the attitude to eat again. \"I'm starving.\" Ben smiled at his daughter, pulling out the flowers for her from behind his back. April gasped, taking them from him. \"They're beautiful.\" She boasted before looking back to her father. \"Now can we go get something to eat?\" \"Smart ass.\" Ben complained as he put his arm around her. Mike took a moment to watch that family. He honestly didn't care if coming out in a relationship with April was going to ruin his professional career. He was just happy to have April and for the first time since this relationship had started, everything was going their way. But Camp David was going to be the end of their good luck streak.

I hope you have all enjoyed this chapter and make sure you drink a lot of water before reading the next few chapters because you may cry. Love ya![Chapter 11] On the way to Camp David, it was just Forbes, Mike and April in the car, giving the two some extra alone time, knowing they weren't going to get much with the whole family around. Most of the time, April read, but when Mike could distract her long enough, they would talk or make out. Whichever they felt at the moment. When they finally got to the cabin, April and Conner were ecstatic. They immediately wanted to explore the place. There were TVs, game consoles, a gym downstairs and even a theater. There was also a huge pool in the back, but they all knew they weren't getting in that during this weather. It was practically a blizzard outside. The Secret Service had the entire guest house right next to the main house with constant guards monitoring the outside and the inside of both cabins. Basically, it was really hard for Mike to get into April s room. April was lying on her bed with Mike lying on top of her, playing with her hair. The TV was on in her room, but neither of them were watching it. They were too distracted with each other. \"So,\" April spoke. \"These are our last few weeks in secret.\" Mike shrugged as he looked back to her. \"What about it?\" \"Anything you want to do that s super-secret?\" She teased, moving even closer into his chest. Mike laughed at her playful face before giving her that loving stare once again. \"Not a damn thing. I don't want anything else than to come out in the open with you.\" April smiled, putting her forehead to his with a loving breath. Mike moved his hand down to hers as they pulled apart, April continuing to rub calming circles on his upper arm. \"So, when the divorce is final and we're out in the open, what are we gonna do?\" Mike looked up, thinking a little bit. \"I was thinking we could buy a house or an apartment somewhere in DC. Close enough so both of us can commute to work without trouble.\" \"Where would I work?\" She said it in more of a wonderment, looking off into the distance envisioning what their perfect life would look like. \"After you graduate college and you have your RN, you will be a wonderful nurse.\" April looked to him with a bashful smile. She loved that he had so much faith in her. That was something she hadn't found anywhere else in any of her other boyfriends but Mike. \"And my dad can come over.\" \"And we can go over there.\" Mike spoke with a shrug. \"We can go visit my mom and my brother in Scotland.\" April bit her lip, thinking about an international trip with just her and Mike. \"We could get married.\" The second April whispered that out, she had no idea where it had come from. She was scared to look at Mike again, wondering if he was going to be creeped out by what she had just said. She slowly picked up her head, her eyes taking their time to meet his gaze. When their crystal eyes finally met, Mike was looking at her in that same wonderment she had on earlier. \"We could get married.\" He repeated, his voice soft and low, but filled with so much love. April leaned in slightly to kiss him, but took a moment before putting his lips with hers. She took a moment to look at his eyes, assuring herself how much she loved him and how much he loved her. Her hands slowly traveled up to the back of his head, pulling him in, Mike loving the kiss, but at the same time, hating that he couldn't stare into her eyes forever. This kiss was so much different than all of their other kisses. For the first time in their entire romantic relationship, they didn't feel like they were sneaking around. It didn't hold the thrill of a forbidden kiss, but it held nothing but that homey sense of being in love. When they pulled apart, Mike smiled at her, April smiling right back. \"I love you, April Asher.\" April began to fix the hair she messed up during their kiss before looking right back into those eyes she hoped she would spend the rest of her life with. \"I love you, Mike Banning.\" Mike and April had an early morning sparring session. That was the cover, but it wasn't too much of a lie because as soon as the two woke up, that s what they did. But that was probably the only relaxing thing that happened all day for the Asher family. They were in and out of the cabin, meeting with diplomats, going to fundraisers. It was so exhausting, each of them fell asleep in the car at least one time. When they finally got back to the cabin for good, April and Conner both threw themselves down on the couch. Mike walked over to the two with furrowed eyebrows. \"Come on, you guys, you want to go down to the theater?\" \"We can't move.\" Conner complained, giving Mike an irritated stare. \"I'm gonna have to agree with the annoying little brother on this one.\" \"You're the annoying big sister.\" Conner complained while pushing her legs off the couch. \"Hey!\" She yelled, pushing his legs right off the couch like he did. Mike sighed, rolling his eyes slightly as the argument continued, the two now up and pushing each other's arms back. \"Hey!\" Ben called, walking into the room to see the two fighting. \"April, Conner, stop.\" They both listened to their father, letting go of each other but continuing to give each other the death stare. \"Hey,\" they all turned to see Forbes peeking into the room. \"I got the movie in for you guys, it's about to start.\" April gave Mike an excited smile as she jumped up from the couch and hurried to Mike. The two were about to run downstairs, Ben watching the two, thinking back on what he saw at the concert. \"Where are you two going?\" April looked back to her father, finding his suspicion well...suspicious. \"We're going downstairs to watch a movie.\" Maggie gave her husband a weird glance, not understanding what he was getting at. \"Well, can I come too?\" April looked to Mike, knowing damn well what they were going to do in that theater was something they couldn't do with her father there. \"Well, we're watching Scream and I know you don t like scary movies.\" \"I still want to watch it with you guys. Maggie, why don't you come too? We ll make it a family activity.\" \"What about me?\" Conner asked, getting up from the couch excitedly at the chance of him being able to watch an R rated movie. \"Not you, buddy.\" Ben spoke, turning around to look at him quickly. April continued to stand there, not sure what to do. She looked to her mother who gave her a shrug, just as confused about this as her daughter was. \"Uh, sure, Dad.\" April finally spoke with a shrug. \"Great!\" He spoke, hurrying into the kitchen. \"You two go down there, Maggie and I will make the popcorn.\" April turned to look at Mike, giving him an obvious forced smile as the two went downstairs to the theater. \"What the hell.\" April spoke through her teeth. \"We have time through the rest of the trip.\" \"No,\" April complained, becoming upset about her father s intrusion. \"We really don't because all we are doing is going to fundraisers and outings that we have to show up to for a photo op.\" April angrily sat down at one of the seats in the theater, crossing her arms in one fluid motion, making Mike chuckle just a little bit. He slowly moved to her, still in that position as he sat down next to her, putting his arm around her causing her to lean into his body with a huff. \"Does it even really matter because after this trip, we re gonna be together all the time and you re probably gonna get sick of me.\" \"That's true.\" She spoke in a dull voice as he gave her an offended face, making her smile as she looked up at him. \"I love you.\" \"No,\" he spoke, taking his arm from around her. \"I'm mad at you now.\" \"Mike,\" April whined through a laugh as she got up on her knees, trying to move closer to him, but he just kept backing away. Ben began to walk into the theater with Maggie following behind him, really not wanting to get in between the two love birds. That s when the two heard the loud laughter. When they were all the way into the theater, they saw April s puckered up lips advancing towards Mike as he just leaned further away from her, laughing almost as loud as her. Maggie smiled a little bit at the two, finding them both very cute when they were in love, but Ben felt uncomfortable, still not knowing how to act to the two being together. \"I got the popcorn.\" He announced loudly, the two sitting up straight in their seats again. Ben moved to the two as Maggie trailed behind just as the movie was starting, both Mike and April sharing a look before looking back to the screen. Ben got to where Mike and April were sitting, looking at Mike sitting in the seat closest to April. \"Mike, mind scooting over two?\" Mike and Maggie both turned to look at him like he was insane, but they had to remember that Ben didn't know anything about the two. Mike gave April a tiny, annoyed glance which she just shrugged to, almost apologetically as Mike got up and moved two seats away from his girlfriend. Ben and Maggie sat down between the two, Ben the closest to April and Maggie next to Mike. April let out a sigh as Drew Barrymore leaned across the island, talking on the phone. \"Wait,\" Ben spoke loudly, causing April to shut her eyes. This is why she hated watching movies with her father. \"Who's the killer?\" \"We don't know.\" Maggie answered for April as she crossed her arms getting irritated. Ben leaned over April trying to talk to Maggie. \"You two don't know or they don't know?\" \"No one knows.\" April spoke, annoyance dripping out of every word. \"We don't know now?\" \"Dad, watch the movie.\" April spoke while shutting her eyes and getting loud. It was silent for a moment as the four watched the killer chasing Drew Barrymore around the house. \"I just want to know who the killer is.\" April let out an irritated scream, standing up and looking to her father. \"It's Billy, and Stu helps him out!\" April suddenly hurried out of the room after that, Mike standing up and moving past Ben and Maggie. \"I'll get her. He mumbled after getting out of the row of movie style chairs. Ben just watched him walk out as Maggie began to give him a death glare. When Ben turned to his wife, he looked at her like he didn't know what was going on. \"What did I do?\" Maggie stood up, separating the space between the two before picking popcorn out of the bowl and throwing a few bits right at Ben's face. \"You know what you did.\" April was standing in the hallway outside the theater, pacing in the small space. Mike got out of the theater, giving her a wild look. \"What happened to not drawing any attention?\" April crossed her arms, rolling her eyes slightly. \"He pissed me off.\" \"He's your father.\" Mike spoke obviously. \"He's gonna do that.\" April sighed, looking to Mike, not knowing what to say to him. \"It's Christmas.\" Mike gave her a confused look which she just sighed to, knowing she would have to explain. \"During Christmas, he's different, he's more appreciative, not as up tight.\" She bit her lip, trying to think how to phrase this next sentence. \"He's not the Governor of Pennsylvania or the President of the United States, he s just...my dad.\" Mike looked to her with a deep sigh, knowing this Christmas probably felt really different to April, and he wanted to do something to help, but he just didn't know what. That's when he got a pretty good idea. \"Wait right here.\" April gave him a confused face, but he went off before she could ask him anything. Ben and Maggie were still in the theater, half watching the movie, half waiting for April to come back. When Mike finally came back, they both turned to him excitedly. \"Is she okay?\" Maggie asked automatically. \"No.\" He spoke, quickly shutting his eyes for saying that. \"Yes. Maybe. Mr. President, I need to talk to you about her.\" Ben gave Maggie the bowl of popcorn before getting up and following Mike. April was still waiting in the hall, expecting Mike to come back to get her, but it was Ben instead. She looked to her father, taking a deep breath and crossing her arms even deeper. \"So, Mike told me what was up with you.\" April rolled her eyes at him while shaking her head. \"Of course he did.\" \"You think he shouldn't have?\" April just shrugged, not really wanting to talk about what she thought Mike should do. \"April, I'm sorry this Christmas wasn't what you were expecting, but you of all people knew that everything was going to change when I became president.\" April nodded, still not really wanting to look at her father while Ben was thinking of everything he could do to make her feel better. He didn't care about not knowing about April and Mike s relationship anymore. He just wanted his daughter to be happy during what should have been the happiest time of the year. \"Okay,\" Ben spoke, getting April's attention again. \"Tomorrow is Christmas Eve and we have one fundraiser to go to at night, why don t we leave early and watch the corniest Christmas movies?\" April got a big smile across her face causing Ben's smile to get wider with hers. \"Really?\" \"Yeah.\" Ben almost whispered, wanting to keep that smile on her face forever. April got close to him, looking at him for a moment. \"Thank you, Dad.\" Ben couldn't wait another moment. He pulled her in for a large hug which April buried her head into. Ben knew he couldn't make up for how bad this vacation had been, but he could make the rest of it as best as he could. Ben and Mike were boxing downstairs as everyone upstairs began getting ready for the party. April was doing her makeup, leaning in close to focus putting on her mascara when there was a knock on her door, making her jump. She breathed out, glad she hadn't started putting it on and accidentally poked herself in the eye. She sighed before going to the door to answer it. Forbes stood in her doorway with a smile, holding an object in his hand. April gasped excitedly, pulling it from Forbes with a smile on her face. \"You got it!\" \"Yeah,\" Forbes sighed out as April brushed it lovingly. \"And you will never know how hard it was to get that.\" \"Thank you.\" She told him before throwing her arms around him in a big hug. Forbes smiled with a bit of an eye roll. He loved April, he wasn't going to deny it. She was the only thing that made him want to keep this job for as long as he did when Ben was elected. \"You owe me one, Asher.\" When they pulled apart, he gestured to her face. \"Now finish up your makeup unless you're going for that whole cyclops look.\" He began to close the door as April picked up a pillow from her bed to throw it at him. He closed the door just in time for the pillow to hit the door. Mike walked up to Ben and Maggie's door to alert them both on the time, hearing Maggie's voice automatically. He knocked on the door, Ben answering automatically. \"Good evening, Mr. President. Five minutes, sir.\" Ben gave him a big smile, thinking back on how funny it would be to see April and Mike out and about since she was so loose and he was so rigged. He shrugged it off though, guessing opposites do attract. \"Thanks, Mike.\" Maggie suddenly came into view, gripping two earrings, obviously flustered, but when she saw Mike, she thought the same thing Ben was thinking. \"Evening, ma'am.\" Mike told her with a nod. \"Merry Christmas, Mike.\" She told him with a bright smile, bringing the earrings into view while giving Ben an irritated smirk. \"The president gets us off our dependence of foreign oil yet he cannot help a wife choose an earring.\" She began to put them up to her ears, giving him an example of what each would look like. Mike shrugged after studying the two. \"The small one. Classic look for a classic lady.\" A big smile spread across Maggie's face at that compliment while Ben rolled his eyes. No wonder April fell for him. \"Good chat.\" She told him with a point, making sure to look at Ben at the fact that he didn't come up with something that good. \"Kiss ass.\" Ben commented as Mike gave him a smirk before shutting the door and letting them continue to get ready. As he walked down the hallway, a pair of hands grabbed him, pulling him into a room and shutting the door behind him. Before Mike could even get his mind on track of what happened, a pair of lips crashed into his excitedly. He knew those lips anywhere. He closed his eyes automatically, kissing April back as hard as she was kissing him, his eyebrows going up in shock on how intimate she was being. When April pulled away, Mike's eyes were wide as a huge smile took over her entire face. \"Merry Christmas!\" She told him excitedly. Mike chuckled at how excited she looked. \"Merry Christmas.\" He laughed out while taking in her whole body. That green dress hugged her body so tight and her red lips were glossed to perfection even if she just gave him the hardest kiss possible. \"I have your Christmas present.\" She whispered with an excited look on her face. Mike gave her a bit of smirk while pulling a box out of his inner coat pocket. \"And I have yours.\" \"Me first.\" April spoke before hurrying off to her bed where she was keeping it. Mike rolled his eyes, but he kept smiling at her. \"Now, I didn't have time to wrap it so close your eyes. Mike rolled his eyes, but listened to her commands. April moved toward him with a huge smile, just waiting for his reaction. She pulled his arms out, placing it in his hand so he would be able to see it the second he opened his eyes. She finally stepped back a little bit, taking in all of her wonderful work before finally saying, \"Open them.\" When he opened his eyes, he automatically looked to what was sitting in his hands, already getting a wide smile. \"Where the hell did you get my old band s CD? I don't even have a copy.\" He looked to her, laughing. \"We only made like a hundred of these when we found out they weren't selling. And they were only released in Scotland.\" \"You know what I've learned?\" He gave her a confused glance, not understanding what she was getting at. \"That when you're the president's daughter, you can call in a lot of favors.\" Mike smiled, looking back to the CD, his smile getting a little wider at how much thought and effort she put into finding it. \"And it was also really cheap.\" He looked to her, leaning in to plant a soft kiss on her cheek. \"I love it, babe.\" When he pulled away from her cheek, he let his head rest there for a moment, April loving every second of it. \"My turn.\" He whispered before pulling away from her and handing over the small jewelry box. \"I hope you like it.\" He whispered as she began to tear off the ribbon. April's mouth dropped the second she got it open. \"Mike.\" She gasped, feeling tears begin to collect in her eyes at how perfect it was. She wasn't one to cry at small things like that, but this one was so different. She pulled the necklace, Mike still giving her a worried glance. \"It's a cloud.\" She spoke through the sniffles. \"Yeah,\" he spoke, meeting her eyes for the first time. \"The whole 'April showers' thing.\" \"Mike,\" she gasped again, looking back to her now favorite piece of jewelry. \"If you don't like it, its fine,\" April looked to him, shocked those words were even coming out of his mouth. \"I ll take it back and I ll get you something - \" April didn't waste another minute. She wrapped her arms around Mike s neck and pulled him into a loving, soft kiss. When she pulled away, Mike was giving her a big smile, not needing any more confirmation than that. \"I love it.\" He put his forehead to hers, breathing her all in before speaking again. \"There's more in the box.\" April scrunched her eyebrows together, but looked back to the box, finding some folded up papers. She put the box down on her bed, unfolding the papers to get a better look at them. She gasped once she realized what they were. \"Divorce papers?\" Mike nodded, giving her another smile. \"I called my lawyer last week and I've had it all written out, all Leah has to do now is sign them.\" April got a huge smile on her face, going back to him to give him another kiss. She loved how committed he was to this relationship. And the closer they were getting to leaving, the closer they were to being an actual couple. \"I love you.\" She whispered to him, meaning every single word. He gave her waist a light squeeze in reciprocation on her feelings. \"I love you.\" April broke away from him, grabbing his hand, hardly being able to wait for the feeling of being able to do this in public. They walked down the hall, still smiling at each other, but they were torn out of their moment when they heard Conner's favorite shooter game being played. They both looked to Conner then to each other before splitting up and going to him on different sides of the couch. April took a seat on the loveseat next to him, watching him play. \"You know,\" Mike spoke as he sat down next to Conner who was too caught up in the game while Mike picked up the remote. \"The real blood bath starts when your mom catches you playing this.\" Mike immediately clicked the power button, turning the entire TV off as Conner sighed, throwing his control to the side of the couch. He just looked up at Mike as Mike put the remote down next to the controller. \"You suck.\" Mike just grabbed the tongue of his hat, pulling it down a little bit. \"Well, you suck worse.\" April simply smiled as Conner stood up and pouted off. She knew Mike would be a great dad one day. Hopefully to their kid. April and Mike were standing near Conner, the two falling into their normal sarcastic banter as Ben and Maggie came into the room, talking. When Maggie saw Conner and April, she got a huge smile on her face. \"Hey, loves!\" April turned to her mom, giving her a smile as she put one hand on April s upper back and the other on Conner's head. \"Do you two want to open a gift before we leave?\" April opened her mouth, about to answer when Conner cut her off. \"It's not love.\" He complained, causing April to roll her eyes as the three began walking. \"And I'll wait until Grandmother gets here.\" April and Mike shared a look, not able to wait until they could tell Grandmother their big news. Well, the whole family their big news. They were nervous for what everyone was going to say, but they knew that everyone here had to know before their secret went public. \"I keep forgetting, sorry.\" Maggie apologized quickly before looking over to her husband who had just gotten off of his phone. \"Do April and I really have to come with you guys?\" April turned around from her family to glance at Mike, the two sharing a sympathetic glance for Conner. \"I've been to so many already.\" \"Being the First Son is hard work, buddy.\" Ben told him while rubbing his shoulder. They each grabbed their jackets, Conner looking back to his parents. \"Well, can I at least ride with Mike?\" Everyone kind of froze. They all knew April was on the top of the list to ride with Mike and once Conner asked, it was kind of a free for all. \"You'll have to ask him.\" Ben finally spoke, giving Mike a quick glance before looking back down at his paperwork. \"He's the boss.\" Conner moved towards Mike, April watching her little brother as he approached her boyfriend. \"Mike,\" he asked, looking up at him with the best puppy dog look he could manage. \"Can I ride with you?\" April sighed, knowing this was hard for Conner. He hated this trip almost as much as she did. Mike quickly looked at April, not wanting to make any rash decisions without her approval. April gave him a little smile before giving him a little nod. Mike looked at him for a moment, knowing he was going to have rearrange some things. \"Alright.\" He told him before turning around to look at Diaz. \"You re riding in the Beast tonight.\" He told him as his face light up at the fact of being in that car. \"Merry Christmas.\" Mike spoke before turning around. April gave Diaz an excited smile at his exciting news while Mike went to talk with Forbes. \"Excited?\" April teased. \"You have no idea.\" Diaz almost breathed out as April laughed with him. \"Mustang,\" Mike spoke, capturing April's attention as she turned to look at him talking into the microphone on his watch. \"This is Big Top,\" Mike caught her stare, causing him to smile just a little bit. He knew what that smile meant. It was her own way of saying I love you in public and Mike s smile back was his way of saying it back. \"Bringing out the full package.\" April got into the car with her parents while Conner got into the car with Mike, Roma and O'Neil. Conner was sitting in the back with O'Neil while Roma drove and Mike sat in the front, controlling the whole show. As soon as they were on the road, Mike spoke through his microphone, going through the last minute need-to-knows before relaxing into his seat. Mike looked back, seeing Conner leaning forward, noticing the most important thing about that. His seatbelt wasn't on. \"Conner, come on,\" he spoke, bringing his head back to the front. \"Scoot back, put your belt on.\" Conner thought for a minute on what to do, looking to him with a challenging expression. \"What if I don't? You gonna tell April on me?\" \"No,\" Mike challenged right back. \"O'Neil here is gonna punch you in the nuts.\" They all laughed, but Conner did as he said, Mike smiling, knowing what he was going to ask him next. \"You keeping one eighty degrees of awareness.\" \"I thought it was three sixty.\" Mike smirked, glad he picked up on that trick question. \"Just checking.\" \"You're setting me up is what you're doing.\" Conner complained. \"And yes, I've kept enough degrees of awareness to notice you sneaking into April's room last night.\" Roma and O'Neil each laughed, but Mike turned around to look at Conner, eyes wide. \"Literally everyone knows, Mike.\" Conner laughed out from the look of his face. Mike turned back to look at Roma who was still chuckling. \"Does everyone really know?\" \"Yes.\" O'Neil and Roma both spoke at the same time. Mike looked forward, shrugging with a bit of a smile on his face, knowing it was understandable especially during their break. \"So,\" Mike spoke loudly, ready to change the subject. \"How many emergency exits in the West Wing?\" \"Eight.\" Conner spoke immediately. Mike continued to question him, Conner answering every question with perfection as fast as possible. \"Not bad.\" Roma spoke while giving Mike an impressed stare at everything he had taught Conner. \"Kid's got it, huh?\" He asked Roma while he continued to shake his head in approval. \"Yeah,\" Mike spoke, almost bragging on him and Conner. \"We're gonna make a Secret Service agent out of you yet.\" Mike turned back to Conner, giving him a wink, making Conner smile just a little more. That's why Mike had always been his favorite. He made him feel special. \"You just have to remember to keep your seatbelt on.\" O'Neil spoke while looking over to him with a teasing smile. \"That's right.\" Mike agreed, leaning into his seat with a smile. He knew some people knew about him and April, but he didn't know everyone knew. At least it would be easier coming out in the next few weeks. April was sitting on the right side of her father while her mother sat on the left. April had immediately put on her cloud necklace, playing with it as she watched the snow fall down around them. She personally couldn't wait for what was going to happen after the fundraiser. Her whole family curled up on the couch watching Christmas movies with Mike by her side. She could almost feel the warmth of his hand in her own, making a smile tug at her lips. \"Wow, it's really coming down out there.\" Maggie then heard a very familiar conjoined hum. When she looked to her two family members, both of them nose deep in the files Ben had brought with him. Even when April was a little girl she tried to help her father with his work, but now that she was old enough to understand his work, she was always the first person he called for help. Unfortunately in her mother's situation, April had inherited her father s work ethic. \"I'm thinking about shaving my head.\" She tried out, waiting for what their responses would be. \"That sounds good.\" \"Yeah, that would look cute, Mom.\" Maggie rolled her eyes at her favorite workaholics before looking back out the window. The snow began to fall down a little harder as the wind began to pick up, causing all the cars to begin to slow down. April looked up at the sight of that and then heard her mother say, \"Merry Christmas, Mr. President.\" Both April and Ben turned to Maggie to see her pushing a gift box to Ben. \"You shouldn't have.\" Ben spoke as he began to open up the gift. April began to smile, knowing exactly what her mother had gotten him. When he finally got it all the way open, he gasped at the look of it. \"My god, my grandfather s watch.\" He whispered before looking to April as she shrugged and then Maggie. \"Where did you find this?\" \"I have my ways.\" She spoke, giving April a quick wink. Ben then leaned forward, getting as close to her face as possible before whispering, \"Thank you.\" They began to kiss, April turning her head in disgust. \"You're so welcome.\" \"I'm right here!\" April complained, the both of them laughing as they pulled away. Ben then put his arm around April, causing her to roll her eyes as he planted a large kiss on her cheek. Ben turned to see Diaz, still looking excited to ride in the Beast. \"Have you ever been to a billionaire's Christmas party before, Diaz?\" \"No sir.\" Diaz spoke, looking to the three in the rearview mirror. \"They're overrated.\" April complained before her father could say anything respectful. That's when Ben removed his arm from April's to push her head to the side, and while doing that, he grabbed Maggie's present from where it was hidden. \"Oh, my gosh, would you look at that?\" He handed her the gift box as she gave him a happy smile. He leaned in, giving her a quick kiss on her cheek as she began to open it up. \"Merry Christmas.\" \"Your presents are next, April, I promise.\" Maggie spoke, giving her daughter a big smile. It was a great moment and April was laughing until a branch hit the windshield of the car in front of them, causing them to slam their breaks and swerve. The Beast couldn't stop fast enough, slamming into the car. All Mike could do was watch. \"Stop, stop, stop!\" Mike yelled on his radio, alerting the others as Roma slowly pushed on the breaks. The Beast swerved, Maggie slamming her head into the window. April watched as the car in front of them flew off the bridge, panic registering in her heart, not remembering if Mike and Conner were in the car in front or behind them. \"MIKE!\" She screamed as soon as the Beast swerved and hit the bridge, the front part of the car hanging in the air and April's head hitting the side of the car. Maggie had blood trickling down her cheek from her head hitting the windshield and April's seatbelt had locked, having her torso hanging as most of the weight was tipping them forward and she was too unconscious to sit up. Mike threw the door open, knowing April was in that car. \"Take Conner. Mike told O'Neil immediately before hurrying off to save her. Mike felt his heart squeeze in his chest while it felt like an eternity to get to the car. Maggie looked to her right to see April dangling there unconscious while Ben focused on if Maggie was okay. \"April.\" She moaned out, Ben now turning his attention to his daughter. \"April,\" Ben spoke, bringing her head up in hopes it would wake her up, but her head just fell back. That's when Mike showed up on the right side of the door, trying to open it, but it was almost frozen shut. He could see April unconscious in there. She looked dead and he prayed to God she wasn't. \"Get on the back!\" Mike commanded, trying to balance out the weight and keep the car from falling. Mike finally pried the door open, using all of his strength. He half sat on the seat, seeing April s lifeless body. \"Oh, my god.\" Mike cried out, his chest tightening while taking her face in his hands, trying to find some sign of life in her, noticing the huge burn mark on her chest from the seatbelt, blood already trickling down it. \"Get her out of here!\" Ben screamed, he was only going to focus on April until she got out of the car. Her eyes fluttered open, Mike gasping once she finally showed she was alive. \"Mike.\" She whispered out. \"Oh, thank god.\" He whispered, pulling her to his chest and undoing her seatbelt before pulling her out of the car. He took her a couple feet away from the car before setting her down, looking to her before hurrying back to the car. \"I'm gonna go back to the car and I'm gonna get your mom and dad out of there.\" \"No, Mike,\" she spoke, her voice gravely and dazed as she gripped onto his jacket with amazing strength. \"Do-don t leave me.\" \"I have to, baby.\" He spoke before pulling her fingers off of him, getting up and running back to the car. All April could do was watch him, finally starting to come back to her senses. \"Mike.\" She whispered, knowing how dangerous it was for him to get into that car. \"Mike!\" She screamed, trying to get up and go after him, but O'Neil showed up behind her, grabbing her at the waist. \"MIKE!\" Mike got back to the car, taking in what was going on before deciding how to react. Roma had to get that left door open eventually, meaning his only job right now was to get the President out of there. \"Sir,\" Mike spoke, putting a hand out for Ben. Ben was currently focused on getting Maggie out of there, trying her seatbelt, but it wouldn't budge. \"Her seatbelt is stuck!\" He yelled to Mike. Mike looked at the First Lady, knowing she was in a really bad condition, maybe even worse than April's. \"Sir, get out of the car, I'll take care of her!\" Ben still wasn't moving. Roma was just barely getting her side door open. \"Roma, open the fucking door!\" He screamed to him. \"I can't!\" He yelled as more agents tried to climb on the trunk of the car. \"It's jammed! It's fucking jammed!\" He was still trying to get through, just getting his arm through. \"Pull her through on your side!\" \"Shit.\" Mike cursed before getting all the way in the car just as the car tipped a little more forward. Both Ben and Mike looked to each other, sharing a fear filled stare before continuing to work on getting Maggie out. Mike pulled out his pocket knife, but the car just continued to sink down. \"Get Maggie!\" Ben yelled to him. Mike sat there for a moment, taking in the situation. The car was going down and it was the President and the First Lady going down with it. He could only save one, and he knew it had to be the President. \"Shit.\" Mike cursed before moving to Ben's seatbelt, cutting it off. \"Sir, I m sorry.\" He spoke before pulling Ben out of the car as Ben tried to hold onto Maggie's hand and pull her out too, but Mike was too strong and Maggie couldn't go anywhere even if it was a bull pulling him out. The two landed on the road just as the car fell off the bridge, landing on the icy river, killing everyone in the car instantly. Ben straightened up the moment he heard the crash. \"NO!\" He screamed. April fell to the ground, O'Neil still holding onto her waist, letting go from shock, letting the reality of the situation sink in. April then began crawling to where Mike laid, the guilt settling into the bottom of his stomach. Secret Service agents had to pull Ben back from going to the edge of the bridge just as Conner got out of the car he was told to stay in. April made it to Mike, looking to him for a moment as tears filled her eyes. She then collapsed into his chest, holding onto him as tight as she could, almost like she was scared the bridge would take him too. Conner looked around at everyone before him, taking in the sight, knowing one very important person was missing. \"MOM!\" April and Mike turned to look at Conner just as O'Neil picked him up. April's mouth fell, it truly registering for her that her mother was gone. She remembered how she looked just as the car crashed. She had fear in her eyes and blood running down her face. That was the last image she had of her mother. Not the wonderful nurturer she knew her whole life or her gorgeous smile, but the fear of death plastered over her face. She buried her head even deeper into Mike as he held onto her, comforting her, but also himself. He let the First Lady die. April's mother. Margret Asher. Someone he had come to know as a friend. She was now dead and he could have saved her. He knew he shouldn't blame himself and he knew he did the right thing, but doing the right thing wasn't always the best thing. kgriswold249: I've been super busy lately and I promise you I'm working on that stuff for you!

Remember to review and I hope you all have a wonderful day/night whatever time you're reading this![Chapter 12] Ben hadn't spoken while Conner was taken back to the camp by Roma. April was currently with the doctor, Mike refusing to leave her side through the entire process. She had a concussion which was expected from how the crash had juggled her head. She also needed stitches from the seatbelt lodging itself into her chest. Mike came out once April fell asleep, Ben lurching to his feet at the sight of him. \"How is she? Is she okay?\" \"She's fine.\" Mike told him instantly, knowing he needed all the good news he could get. \"A concussion, twenty stitches, but they want to keep her overnight for observation.\" Ben felt like he could breathe again, but there was still something piercing in his heart. The loss of his wife was still stabbing him with every breath. \"Sir,\" Mike spoke after a long silence. \"Why don't you and O'Neil go back to the camp and I'll stay here with April. I'll make sure she's safe, sir.\" Ben looked to him, filled with an almost anger. \"Well not even that can guarantee her safety anymore.\" Mike had to bite the insides of his cheeks to keep from showing how much that comment had hurt him. \"Sir,\" O'Neil spoke as he walked up to the two, sensing some tension. \"Let's go. We need you to get some sleep.\" Ben still hadn't taken his eyes off of Mike. \"Mike's got everything here and we can see April tomorrow once she's woken up.\" Ben finally looked away from Mike, nodding to O'Neil and then following him out. Mike stood there for a moment once they had left, knowing this was his first time alone since everything had went to shit. He let out an angry scream before kicking the waiting room's table, drawing the attention of everyone around him. He didn't care about them. He cared about April. \"April.\" he whispered before hurrying back to her room. He couldn't lose her no matter what. He was so close to losing her tonight, but he ended up losing her mother. When he got back to her room, he took a deep sigh of relief in the fact that nothing had changed. He slowly moved to her bed, pulling up a chair to sit near her. He took her cold hand with wires running down it into his big warm ones. \"I can't believe that after everything that happened, I don't have you convincing me none of this is my fault.\" He just continued to look down at her, focusing on her breathing. \"When I saw you unconscious in that car, it was the scariest moment of my entire life.\" He moved his hand to her head, tucking a strand of hair behind her ear. \"I thought you were…\" Mike trailed off, not finding himself able to finish that sentence. His eyes were watering and he didn't want to think about what would happen if he actually lost her. Mike felt the first tear run down his cheek, wiping it away with his free hand. \"You're gonna tell me over and over again that none of this was my fault, but I feel so guilty, April.\" He took a deep breath, looking back to her face. \"I'm a monster, and I killed your mother.\" He began to rub her cheekbone, taking deep breaths to keep from breaking down into tears. \"I keep playing it over and over again thinking that if I didn't spend so much time getting you out or arguing with Ben. Or even if I would have let you ride with me and Conner. Your mom would have still been alive.\" His eyes fell, looking at her hands. \"April, please forgive me.\" The last thing April and Mike talked about when they got back was the divorce. They had a lot more to deal with. The funeral was one of the scariest events for the entire Secret Service. Everyone was going to be there. Citizens. Allies. Family. Friends. It was going to be a mad house, and the family still wasn't done grieving. During the procession, military units based close by were leading it, a new and improved Beast carrying President Asher, Conner and April behind the units. Behind the Beast was Maggie's casket being pulled by pure white horses, the casket draped in a huge American flag, followed by the casket of Diaz and Thomson. Roma was driving the Beast with Mike in the passenger's seat. April felt like this was the longest drive of her life. She didn't want to look back, knowing her mother's body was back there, but that was the only thing on her mind. Mike looked into the rearview mirror, seeing April looking out the left widow, a black veil covering her face and the black dress and stockings matching perfectly with her black heels. He wanted to hold her hand through the whole thing, tell her everything was going to be all right, but he wouldn't be able to do any of that during the funeral. When they got to the Arlington National Cemetery, April didn't want to get out of the car. She was taking deep breaths as her father and brother got out of the car. She was thinking about the accident all over again. The last thing she saw of her mother was the blood trickling down her face. And the last thing she said to her. She was complaining about her parents kissing around her. The truth was that she would never see that again. Her scar began throbbing as her chest bounced with tears wrecking through her body. Ben looked around after he had closed the door behind Conner, noticing April wasn't out of her side of the car yet. \"Where's April?\" Mike then looked, noticing the same thing. He looked into the window of the car, just barely making out a figure sitting in her seat. Mike put a hand on Ben's shoulder before whispering in his ear, \"I'll get her.\" Mike opened up the door Ben and Conner had come out of and slid into the car causing buzz around the funeral attendees. All April was doing was looking out the window, continuing to breathe in and out as heavily as possible to keep herself from crying. \"April,\" Mike spoke as he shut the door after him. She just continued to sit there. \"April, you're going to have to get out.\" \"I can't.\" She spoke in the shakiest voice he had ever heard from her. He placed his hand on hers, knowing this was going to have to be one of the hardest things she would ever have to do. \"You're gonna regret it if you don't.\" April let out a little sob, breaking Mike's heart. \"And you'll have me through it.\" April slowly turned to look at him as he squeezed her hand. She knew the windows were tinted and no one would be able to see what she was about to do and it was a good thing. She was going to need this to get her through the next few hours. She leaned forward, placing both of her hands on his face, Mike looking to her as soft as he ever had before she whispered, \"I love you.\" \"I love you.\" With that, she slowly leaned in, giving him a soft kiss. Mike still felt like this whole thing was his fault, but when she kissed him, it was like some of that guilt faded away. To her, he was this amazing man who could do no wrong and she made him want to be that. She knew he had his flaws, but she was willing to forget all of them to have a lifetime with him. When they finally pulled away, they stared into each other's eyes for a moment, both feeling a tad better. Like they would be able to get through this together. She took his hand, giving him a small smile which he gave her right back before the two got out of the car. April walked to her father, giving him a small smile which he gave right back. When she looked off, though, Ben looked to Mike, wondering what would happen if April was the one in Maggie's position. Would he be burying her instead? Ben shook the thought out of his head. He didn't want to think about any of that, but it was still in the back of his brain. Megan joined the family at the White House, everyone knowing April's best friend was going to have to be there to help her through it. Maggie's family went off to another portion of the house as April and Conner were just left in confusion. It was almost like they didn't want to talk to the Asher family at all. Mike walked into the Oval Office where his presence had been requested. He would rather be comforting April and Conner after the funeral. They had just lost their mother and no matter how many times April said she was okay, he knew she wasn't. \"You wanted to see me, Mr. President?\" Mike asked once he was fully inside of the office. \"Yes, Mike.\" Ben spoke, finally turning around to look at him. \"Please, take a seat.\" Mike did as he said, automatically clasping his hands together from nervousness. Ben sat across from him, taking all of his courage to finally look him in the eye. \"Mike, I brought you in to talk about you…breaking things off with my daughter.\" Mike sat there for a moment, wondering whether he should start denying or fighting for their relationship. Mike started to laugh, deciding denying was the first step. \"Sir, I don't know – \" \"Oh, cut the crap, Mike.\" Ben spoke, annoyed with the whole façade. \"I may not be the most observant, but I'm not stupid.\" \"Sir,\" Mike spoke, becoming panicked. \"I want you to know it's not just a fling with April.\" He took a moment, becoming fearful at the thought of losing her. \"I love her.\" Ben sighed while looking down, knowing how selfish this all was of him. \"Yeah, I know, and she loves you.\" Mike looked around, making sure this conversation was completely private before continuing, his voice getting very low at the despair taking over him. \"Then why do you want it to stop?\" Ben suddenly stood up, not wanting to look Mike in the eye for this next part. \"I gave you a direct order on that bridge, Mike.\" \"Sir,\" Mike spoke as he stood, about to continue apologizing. \"And you did your job back there, I don't blame you.\" Mike took a deep breath, finding it really hard to breath in that moment. \"But I realized something on that bridge.\" Mike was too scared to ask. He would be fine going his whole life not knowing what he was about to say. \"That no matter what the stakes, in the end, I am the top priority. Not April. Not Conner. Me.\" \"With all due respect sir,\" Mike started still struggling to breath. \"I don't see how any of this has to deal with my relationship with April.\" Ben finally turned back to him, taking a deep breath. \"So if it was April instead of Maggie, would you have done the same thing?\" He let those words sit with him, feeling his heart break at the thought. \"Mike, you're a good man and I know you two love each other, but please, Mike, don't bring my daughter into something she won't be able to survive.\" Mike felt his heart like a weight, his entire body shrinking down, knowing that Ben really was right. If he loved April, he would let her go. \"How do I go about it?\" His voice was hoarse, trying to keep the tears from falling. They had gotten so close to a beautiful life together, but it was all ending in shatters. So, the Asher family and Megan collected in April's room minus Ben who went straight to the Oval Office once they got back. April was obviously worried about her father, but she also had her brother to look after. Grandmother Asher was running her hands through Conner's hair as April laid on Megan. \"It was a nice service.\" Grandmother spoke almost absentmindedly. April wanted to be mourning the death of her mother as everyone else was, but only one thing was going through her mind right now. \"I wonder what Mike and Dad are talking about.\" Conner looked up at her, his eyes starting to flame with anger. \"God!\" He screamed while getting off of Grandmother's lap, everyone jumping at his sudden outburst. \"Don't you ever think of anyone else besides yourself?!\" \"Conner,\" April tried, but Conner was angry and filled with grief. \"All you care about is you and your stupid boyfriend and your stupid secret which is not so secret!\" April's eyes widened, not realizing he knew. Or the fact that anyone knew. \"Mom died and that's still all you're talking about!\" April got up, trying to go to him, but Conner pulled away before running off. \"You're so selfish!\" He called before slamming the door shut. They all sat there for a moment before April stood up, going after her brother. \"Oh, April,\" Grandmother called. \"He didn't mean it!\" The door slammed behind her, leaving just Grandmother and Megan sitting on April's bed. \"So, dear,\" Grandmother began, looking over at Megan. \"Do you get high?\" All Megan could do was look at her. She knew Grandmother Asher was a wild card from April's stories, but she didn't expect this. \"Who are you?\" April hurried down the hall, not quite sure where Conner had went, but she knew she had to find him. As she ran, she ran directly into Mike. \"There you are!\" She exclaimed, she began explaining everything that just happened, but the only thing Mike could do was look at her face. He was memorizing every inch of it, feeling like this was going to be the last time he ever saw it. \"Mike?\" She questioned, tearing him back to what she was saying. \"Are you even lis – \" \"Leah and I aren't getting a divorce.\" April blinked a little, not expecting something so random to come from the story of Conner running off like that. \"Well, obviously not now, my mother just died. We have to give it some time – \" \"April,\" Mike spoke, the same bland tone he used before. That's when it all hit her. He wasn't just talking about within the next month. \"Oh,\" she breathed out, trying to keep herself standing upright. \"You mean…\" She had to pause, knowing she wouldn't be able to get through the sentence if she didn't. \"Ever.\" All they could do was look at each other, not coming up with any words, April still numb from what she had just heard. \"I'm sorry, April.\" April's breath began to quicken, all of this just hitting her so hard. First her mother and now Mike. \"Why?\" It was the only thing she could say. That was the only thing running through her mind. \"I just…\" It only hurt Mike more to see her reaction to the news. He knew it was going to hurt, but he could physically see her heart break the longer they stood there. \"I can't.\" \"Did I do something?\" April stepped forward, but Mike took a step back from her, causing the first tear to fall down her cheek. \"Tell me what to do and I'll do it.\" \"No, April,\" Mike spoke in the best assuring voice he could manage, finding just looking at her was breaking his heart. \"It's not – \" \"Please,\" April spoke, now getting angry with the whole thing. \"Do not give me the 'it's not you, it's me' speech.\" \"I'm getting transferred to the Treasury Department.\" April wiped a tear from her face as she shook her head. \"Because of me?\" When she looked back to Mike's poker face, she rolled his eyes. \"God, you just can't take two seconds out of your day to ignore me?\" \"April, I am so – \" She then struck him across the face, Mike surprised she actually did it. He looked back to her, April taking deep breaths as tears continued to flow down her cheeks. She finally looked down, not being able to look Mike in the eye anymore. \"You should go.\" Mike lingered for just another second, debating on taking it all back, but he knew that he had to do what was best for her. As he began to sulk to the stairs, he turned back, looking at her standing there as she cried. \"I really do love you April.\" She looked up at him, her deep breaths taking a toll on her and more tears continued to trickle down her cheeks. He took an extra moment to study her face before turning back to the steps and continuing down them. After he was gone, April shut her eyes while tears ran through her whole body. \"Hey, April,\" she heard Megan call from behind her, but she was too overcome with grief to say anything. \"Conner came back to your room to apolo – \" That's when Megan noticed her face. \"Hey,\" Megan spoke, knowing this wasn't just about her mother or Conner. This was something else. \"What happened?\" April was gasping from tears as she threw her arms around Megan's neck, not knowing what else to do. Megan instantly hugged her back, but she just didn't know what to do. She didn't know why she was crying, but she knew one thing. She had to comfort her. No matter what happened, she had to be there for her. On Mike's last day, April refused to come out of her room. She just sat there, not answering anyone's calls, not doing anything but sit there and think about what she was going to do without Mike. Suddenly, there was a knock on her door, but she didn't respond, she just continued to look up at the ceiling while tears fell from the sides of her face. The door opened minus her approval of the person coming in, and when he did come in, he inhaled a sharp breath at the look of her. \"April?\" April's eyebrows knitted together before sitting up in her bed, looking to who was standing in her doorway. Mike slowly closed the door behind him while April looked him up and down, wiping her tears away when he wasn't looking. \"What do you want?\" Mike turned back to her, taking a deep breath before moving towards her. \"I wanted to say goodbye.\" April shook her head, the rain pounding on the side of her window getting harder. \"I don't want to talk to you.\" All Mike could do was stand there. He knew she was devastated, but he expected a goodbye at the very least. \"April,\" he started. \"I don't wanna hear some last ditch effort of how much you love me and that you're doing this for me because that's bullshit.\" All Mike could do was look at her. \"That whole 'if you love her let her go' thing is such bullshit.\" More tears continued to fall down her cheeks and Mike just stood there, wishing he could take all of her pain away. \"If you really truly loved me then you would stick by my side through this.\" \"I know it doesn't make sense.\" He told her while moving to sit on her bed next to her. \"But I wish I could stay here more than anything.\" April moved her hands to his cheeks, beginning to play with his hair with her right hand. \"Then stay here.\" April's nose was getting red from crying and she had bags under her eyes, but Mike still found her the most attractive woman in the world. \"Stay here with me.\" Mike leaned forward, taking his time to look into those gorgeous eyes he was scared he would never see again before putting his lips to her's, giving her a passionate kiss. April kissed him with all of her might almost as if that would make him stay, but she knew Mike. And she knew this was strictly a goodbye. When they pulled away, Mike continued to stare into her eyes, taking a deep breath when their foreheads fell to each other. \"I love you.\" April gasped from the tears, hating how he said it. Like it was the last time. \"I love you.\" Then before he could convince himself to stay, he got up and hurried out of her bedroom door. April shut her eyes, letting the tears fall freely now as she fell back onto her bed, holding her favorite pillow to her chest, hoping it would reduce the pain of her breaking heart. Mrs. HappyAnarchy: You are the strongest of us all then MisfitCarter: Yes. It's just rain in this indoor place. Not tears! Kagome309: Thank you, sweetie! I'm not crying, you're crying. I just want to give you guys a thank you for getting me to fifty reviews (really 49, but hey, close enough) in eleven chapters! You guys are the absolute best. I just want to let you guys know you can follow me on Tumblr at janaespecter14 and I post some edits for my stories there and give updates and stuff like that.

I hope you all enjoyed even if this chapter was pretty emotional and shorter compared to my last one. Thank you guys so much for reading and remember to review![Chapter 13] Six Months Later – June Megan came out of the shadows of the tent, holding up a dream catcher to show it off to April. \"Look at how cute this is.\" \"Oh my gosh!\" April spoke, going for the price tag. Before she could even read the numbers, Troy picked it up from Megan's hands, putting it in their basket. April gave him an annoyed look, but she couldn't help this bright smile on her face. \"Stop it.\" \"I can't buy my girlfriend things?\" He taunted before wrapping his arm around April's shoulders. \"Keep him.\" Megan loudly whispered into April's ear, loud enough for Troy to hear. April rolled her eyes at her best friend before looking back to Troy. She didn't expect any of this to happen. After Mike, she didn't expect to fall for anyone ever again, but Troy was there at the right time and he was so sweet. She liked him, but she knew she would probably never fall for him, but then again, she probably wouldn't fall for anyone again. Not as hard as she fell for Mike. Leah's arm was looped through Mike's arm as they walked through the flea market. \"I like having you home more often.\" she whispered as Mike smiled at what she said. He hated it. It had been six months since he was technically fired and he now had a desk job at the Treasury. He missed his old job, but mostly, he missed April. He was going to give up everything for her. He had the divorce papers written out, he was going to sit down with Leah and explain he had fallen in love with someone else, but then the accident happened. April begged for him to stay, but after what Ben told him, he just couldn't. It broke both of their hearts, but he had to do it. Although, not a day went by that he didn't think of her or how she was doing. Megan was fiddling with her new camera, testing out the lens. During the spring semester, she had really gotten into photography. She took one photography class because she needed a fine arts credit and ended up falling in love with it. She put the camera up to her eye, hoping to catch some artsy picture of all the people walking through, but she ended up seeing someone she hadn't seen in a long time. \"Holy crap!\" \"What?\" April asked, appearing right next to Megan, Troy still checking out the rugs. Megan looked to April, not at all sure how she would take this, but she couldn't just not let her know. \"Mike!\" Megan pointed to where she had seen him, April following her finger to where the love of her life was standing. April felt herself stop breathing, watching him lean to the left with his right hand in his right pocket. His hair was getting longer, she figured he would decide to grow it out now that he didn't have to keep it military grade short. She could see that dazzling blue from where she stood, his cheeks still a little chunky, not matching the rest of his toned, muscular body. That last kiss they shared was lingering on her lips, she could feel the pulsation and smell his scent all over again. She still hadn't taken a breath, thinking of it all. \"Dude, breathe.\" Megan spoke, watching her best friend struggle to even take the breath in. \"That's really him.\" She spoke breathlessly, trying to focus on her breathing. How could she though when Mike Banning was right there? Megan looked to April, seeing every inch of her face want for Mike, so she was going to do something drastic. She cupped her hands to magnify her voice before calling out, \"MIKE!\" April immediately turned to her friend, talking negatively while Mike turned to where he had heard his name, seeing the back of a brunette head and Megan arguing. There was only unnatural brunette she would be around was, \"April?\" April turned to look at him, her breath hitching at the same time his did. Neither of them knew what to do. Should they say something? Ignore each other? Run? April's heart ached thinking on how he blamed himself, the day he was transferred. She thought about all the crying she did, the days spent locked in her room mourning for her dead mother and her lost lover. Ben's words just kept running through his mind. Please, Mike, don't bring my daughter into something she won't be able to survive. That didn't mean they couldn't be friends, did it? Mike flashed her a smile, making her heart stop beating. He began to walk over, April turning to Megan in a panic, Megan seeming to have the same look on her face. \"Dump him.\" \"What?\" April asked in complete confusion, turning all the way around to look at her. \"Troy.\" April suddenly gave her an annoyed look as Mike got even closer. \"Dump him. Pick Mike.\" \"This isn't the Bachelor .\" April hissed. \"April,\" Mike repeated, finally reaching her. April turned around, not at all sure how to act. She wanted to punch him, yell at him for leaving her when she needed him the most. She wanted to cry to him, tell him how much she missed him. She wanted to jump in his arms and kiss him, tell him how much she loved him. Instead of all of those things, she settled on a warm smile and a hug. \"Hey.\" She almost sang as she moved to hug him. The moment they hugged, she had to stop herself from kissing him. \"Hey.\" Mike said back, returning her hug, remembering their passion on Thanksgiving Day. When they pulled away, Mike stared at her, remembering how great her lips tasted. Then out of the corner of his eye, he saw Megan with a big cheesy smile, knowing she was the one of the only people who knew about their affair. \"Hey, Megan.\" he spoke in an almost tired voice, but in all honestly, he missed how nosy and inappropriate she was. \"She gave him a head nod with her arms crossed. \"What's up, Mike?\" He shook his head at her before leaning in to give her a side hug. \"Some things never change.\" \"I'm a wonder.\" Megan spoke, looking up, very full of herself in that moment. \"Hello?\" They all turned to see Leah coming up from behind Mike. April immediately stiffened. She had never met her before, but she had seen her once through Leah and Mike's closet shutters. Although, April knew she was the \"other woman\" in all of this. She was shaking. How was she supposed to introduce herself? Hello, I'm April, your husband fucked me in your own bed while you were saving lives at work. Mike was obviously terrified too. He wanted to please them both, but he just didn't know how. He put his hand on Leah's back, April now really feeling what it was like to be the other woman. She knew no matter what he felt for her, she was always going to be the side chick. \"April, this is Leah. Leah, April.\" April leaned forward to shake Leah's hand as Megan looked back and forth at the two, knowing the same thing April and Mike knew. \"Nice to finally meet you.\" \"Likewise.\" Leah told her with a big smile. \"And I'm so sorry for your loss. I don't know if it's too late…\" she trailed off when she saw the look on both April and Mike's faces. \"I'm sorry.\" April shook her head, not wanting Leah to feel guilty. She should be the one to feel guilty. \"Nothing to apologize about.\" Mike looked April up and down, noticing she had let her bangs grow out. \"How have you been, Showers?\" April smiled at her nickname she hadn't heard from his mouth in months. Everyone else around them was confused, but that name was everything to April. \"I'm fine.\" That's when Troy came up behind her. Mike gave him a confused look, April practically jumping when she noticed him. \"Mike,\" she spoke, putting her arm around Troy's waist as he put his around her shoulders. Mike stiffened then, knowing what she was going to say before she even said a thing, feeling like a knife was in his heart. \"This is my boyfriend, Troy.\" Mike swallowed before leaning forward to shake his hand, April watching Mike better than anyone. \"Hey,\" Mike spoke. \"I was in the Secret Service, watching over April.\" April smiled a little bit as all the dirty jokes began running through her head. \"You're Mike.\" Troy spoke with a nod as they let go of each other's hands. \"April has told me so much about you.\" When no one was looking, Mike gave April a confused look, wondering if she had told him everything . She just shook her head quickly like it was the most obvious thing in the world before looking back to Megan and Troy. \"We were just out doing some shopping.\" April added. \"Same.\" Leah and Mike spoke in unison. April gulped. They knew each other so well, and they always would. They were married and her and Mike weren't. Mike then turned to Leah, noticing the sad expression on April's face. \"You know, April and Megan are working on getting into the nursing program.\" \"That is fantastic!\" Leah spoke enthusiastically while looking back and forth at the girls. \"There are actually some openings in my hospital for nursing assistants.\" \"What do you know?\" Megan commented while turning to look at April. \"Nursing assistants are being hired at Leah's hospital.\" \"Yeah,\" April spoke, looking over to her, slightly angry. \"You two should apply.\" She spoke again, not picking up on what Megan was finding so funny. With all of Mike's talk of Leah, this wasn't what she expected. She expected her to be cold and unreasonable, but she was sweet and warm. She felt herself hating Mike. Hating him and herself for doing this to Leah. \"I could be your RN.\" \"That would be great!\" April exclaimed, honestly wanting to get out of this situation as quick as possible. \"Well, we should go. We have a test coming up we need to study for.\" \"Well, it was nice meeting you.\" Leah put her hand out, April taking it in hers almost immediately. When April looked at her, she felt like she was leaving the contestant that beat her on a game show. A game show Leah didn't even know she had won yet, but everyone seemed to know April had lost. When they finally broke the handshake, she looked to Mike who had just broken a hug with Megan. The two looked at each other, knowing that if they didn't hug, everyone would know something was up. April almost fell into his hug, taking a deep breath in, missing his scent and the feeling of his arms around her. Mike missed how perfectly short she was. How their heights just perfectly fit together. How her hugs were almost therapeutic. When they finally pulled apart, April held onto his arms for a bit longer, looking into his eyes with a smile. Mike looked to her, knowing they couldn't get back together, but they could still be friends. \"I'll call you and we'll hang out.\" Mike told her with a nod. April smiled just a little bit, feeling almost like they were back together. \"I'd like that.\" When she finally let go of his arms, she felt like she was breaking up with him all over again, but there was no way she could let any of them standing there know. \"Bye.\" \"Bye.\" Mike told her, lingering a look at her a little longer before turning around with his arm going around Leah, that one thing hurting April more than anything. \"She wasn't what I expected.\" Leah told Mike, leaning into him a little more. \"Who?\" Mike asked, leaning into her a little more. \"April?\" \"Yeah,\" she spoke with a shrug. \"I just expected a spoiled rich girl.\" \"April's not like that.\" Mike spoke, defending her with an edge in his voice. \"Yeah,\" Leah spoke with a nod. \"I know, but there's just some things you expect being in that position of power.\" Mike looked to her, almost irritated and most definitely offended. He decided to ignore it and not talk about April Asher for the rest of their time shopping. Although, when Mike turned around to look at April, she looked so happy with her new boyfriend. He was happy that she was able to move on from him, but he couldn't disguise the fact that it hurt. \"Wow,\" Troy spoke as the group walked away. \"He wasn't what I expected.\" \"What did you expect?\" April asked. Troy scoffed. \"I don't know, some brain dead macho man.\" April and Megan both looked to him, annoyed with what he had just said. This was Mike he was talking about. \"Mike isn't like that.\" April defended. \"It's just something you expect from people who look like that.\" April looked to him, almost disgusted that he would say something like that about anyone, but it stung even more that it was Mike. April then turned around to look at Mike with his arm around Leah. She sighed, knowing Mike broke up with her and he chose to be with Leah. He deserved all the happiness in the world and if she was what made him happy, then he should be with her, but all of her wanted him to be with her. Mike was sitting in his car, ready to drive home from work, but he just kept thinking about meeting April yesterday. There was nothing wrong with the two being friends. Ben didn't say anything about the two being friends. He looked at his phone, going to the number he hadn't looked at in ages. \"Come on, Mike.\" He whispered to himself. \"It's just April.\" He looked out the window, becoming suddenly nervous again. \"The love of your life that the President of the United States made you leave. On the other side of the spectrum, April was looking through the kitchen, trying to find something to eat since it was Monica's day off. She remembered there were pizza rolls in the freezer for days like this, making her get suddenly happy. That's when her phone began to ring. She looked to the caller ID, smiling a little bit. She couldn't believe it. She had saw him yesterday and now he was calling. She didn't expect them to get back together, but at least now she knew that he missed her as much as she missed him. \"Hello?\" \"April,\" Mike spoke, all of his nerves going haywire when he heard her voice. \"Hey, Mike.\" She chuckled out a little bit. She could hear it in his voice. \"What's up?\" April furrowed her eyebrows together. She knew Mike. He wasn't one to call to catch up. When he called, it was to gather information, apologize or make plans. His phone conversations never lasted more than a few minutes. \"Um, not much. I'm about to eat. Why? What do you want?\" Mike chuckled a little, remembering how much they would flirt together. \"Why do you assume I want something?\" \"Because I know you, Mike.\" She challenged, adjusting the hold she had on her phone while Mike continued to smile through the phone. \"Now I'll ask you again, what do you want?\" \"I wanted to know if we could hang out sometime soon.\" April almost dropped the phone out of her hands. She couldn't believe this was happening. \"You know, as friends.\" \"Um,\" That last sentence took her off guard, but they were friends before, they could be friends again. In all honestly, she missed him being in her life, and if he could be in her life again as friends, she would take it. \"Yeah, that'll be fun.\" \"Alright,\" Mike sighed out. There was an awkward silence between the two, neither of them knowing how to continue. \"I have tickets to an art gala tomorrow, Troy can't come, wanna go?\" \"Yeah, sure.\" Mike was getting excited. He was actually having plans to hang out with April which was something he hadn't done in a long time. \"Black tie event.\" \"Black tie event.\" He repeated, already knowing what he was going to wear, not like he had a million and one choices like April. \"I'll text you the address and we can meet there.\" \"It's a date.\" They let a pause take over, knowing how awkward it was to use that word in their very complicated situation. \"Not a date.\" He corrected quickly. \"Just a…\" He could hear April chuckle on the other end of the phone, making him get a smirk, realizing she was enjoying listening to him fumble for words. \"You know what I mean.\" \"Goodbye, Mike.\" Mike took a moment, smiling at her. He really did miss her. \"Goodbye, April.\" When April hung up the phone, she looked down at the granite in the island in the kitchen, smiling to herself. Then she remembered she had nothing to wear. \"Oh my god.\" Megan exclaimed as April tried on her third dress. \"You're going on a date with him.\" \"It is not a date.\" April groaned, fixing up the dress before she showed it off to Megan. When she turned around, Megan's eyes got wide at the sight of it. \"Wow, someone's trying hard.\" April looked down to her chest, noticing her cleavage almost popping out of the dress. \"I knew it was too booby.\" \"Way too booby for a married man.\" April turned to look at her best friend, sighing and going back to her dresses with her head down, thinking about it all again. \"Why do you keep throwing that in my face?\" \"Because I was there when he left without a reason.\" Megan spoke, crossing her arms with a deep sigh. \"And when you cried yourself to sleep without him.\" April turned back to her, biting her lip, remembering all about those devastating months, about how she was just getting back on her feet when he had rushed back into her life. \"I don't want to see you hurt like that again.\" April turned back to her with a new dress held up to her body, deciding to ignore her. \"What about his one.\" \"April,\" Megan complained. \"Promise me that nothing will happen between the two of you until he is completely, one hundred percent divorced.\" April hurried to her friend, sitting down with her, holding her hands with the dress still lying on her body. \"I promise you and myself I won't.\" Megan smiled right back to her, looking her over before coming up with a final decision. \"Get the little black dress out.\" April's eyes got wide at that suggestion. \"Are you sure that's not too sex – \" \"It's not too sexy. I said don't do anything until he's divorced, I didn't say you couldn't speed up the process with your super-hot body.\" She hurried to her closet, pulling out the dress. \"Just don't look into his eyes for longer than five seconds, I don't need that romantic brain to start falling for that tall, dark and damaged.\" April rolled her eyes, getting off the bed and looking to the dress. \"This is going to kill him.\" April threw her head back in laughter before taking it from her and hurrying to put it on. April looked through the art exhibits, pausing, taking in the silence the two shared to form some opinions about the different pieces. Really though she didn't want her and Mike to get talking about the old times. She knew Megan was right. Until he was an official man back on the market, nothing could happen between them. \"That one's nice.\" Mike commented before taking a sip of his wine. \"Very modern.\" April began to chuckle, knowing it was more abstract than anything. \"You have no idea what the hell you're talking about, do you?\" \"No.\" Mike chuckled through another sip of wine. \"I really don't.\" \"You know we could have done something else, right?\" April turned to look at him, noticing he was still looking at the painting. \"Something, you know,\" She thought back to their first date, getting a big smile. \"Like burgers and beers.\" Mike smiled down into his wine, knowing just what she was getting at. \"You make me sound so uncultured.\" April smiled before looking back to the painting when Mike turned his head to her. He didn't know if she did it on purpose, but that black dress was killing him. It hugged every single curve she had and the top was respectable, but still held a fair amount of cleavage. He also really loved her hair like that. It wasn't all stuck in one place. It was free to fall down all the different sides of her face, shoulders, back. It made her look free and he loved that look on her. \"So tell me what a perfect night with me would consist of.\" April asked, looking around to make sure no one was watching before sipping some of Mike's wine. Mike couldn't help all the dirty thoughts running through his brain. The perfect night with her would include a lot of bondage and foreplay. \"I'll let you know when I fine it.\" April turned back to him, taking a deep breath. This was so hard. Being \"just friends\" with someone you're in love with is so hard. Mike was her best friend. Always would be, but she missed lacing her hand through his. She missed kissing him until she was out of breath. A few of the painters around them began packing up their works, catching April's attention to her surroundings again. \"I think they're closing up. We should probably go.\" \"Yeah.\" Mike spoke, doing his safety checks before putting his arm on her back and guiding her out as April smiled to herself. Some things never change. When they finally got outside, April began to draw into herself at how cold it had gotten. Mike looked to her, immediately beginning to take off his jacket for her. \"You're cold.\" \"No.\" She refused instantly this whole thing starting to feel like an awkward first date, fumbling limbs and all. \"I insist.\" He spoke, wrapping the jacket around her before she could protest. When it was finally on her shoulders, he took a moment, looking in the eyes he hadn't been that close to in so long. They were so gorgeous like perfect little diamonds. April looking into his too, seeing the sea of damage swirling in the color, wanting with her all to jump in and fix it. That's when she remembered Megan's rule not to look into his eyes for longer than five seconds. She broke away quickly, looking in the other direction before pushing a strand behind her ear. Mike did the same, looking off quickly, eyes cursing him for doing so. \"I'm sorry.\" She spoke, fingers still fiddling with her hair. \"My fault.\" He spoke, throwing his hands up in defense. April finally turned back to him as he did, smiling brightly. She hadn't left yet and she already wanted to see him again. \"We should do this again.\" She told him, still keeping her smile. \"Maybe not an art gala next time.\" He spoke while walking her back to the car O'Neil was waiting out of. \"Burgers and beers.\" She told him, turning back to look at him as he rolled his eyes. \"Maybe something in the middle.\" When they reached the car, O'Neil immediately stuck his hand out, the two hugging each other and sharing a small greeting as April just watched Mike. With every move he made, she wished she had him again. Mike finally turned back to her, giving her a smile before leaning in for a hug. \"See you, Showers.\" She rolled her eyes, but part of her made her hold on tighter because she was leaving him. \"Later, Banning.\" She whispered before breaking away from him and climbing into the car. Mike was the perfect gentleman, not leaving his spot until the moment the car was out of sight. April threw her head back before pushing her hair back from the beginning of her hairline. \"Oh, I know that look.\" O'Neil retorted, looking to her in the rearview mirror. She rolled her eyes at him, looking out the window with a sigh. \"Oh, just keep driving, O'Neil.\" He chuckled a little, noticing what she was still wearing. \"Nice jacket.\" That's the minute she realized she still had it on. She smiled to herself while leaning further into her seat and wrapping the jacket around her even further as O'Neil smiled to himself. It was only a matter of time before those two got together again. Mrs. HappyAnarchy: I know! It will be a while before I will be over the death of someone that talented. Sorry I had to make you cry double. Kagome309: Mike needs to pull it together. Thanks for your review, sweetie! NGArmyWife: Thank you! Your review literally had me smiling all day. Monse: Hehehe, thanks MisfitCarter: I'm sorry I messed with your emotions, but I just had to. I hope you liked some of the April/Mike action in this chapter. And I hope it doesn't rain too much on your face. Hey, guys. This chapter just came out really quick. I just couldn't stop writing once I started. I was drunk last night and still trying to write so you know there was a lot of editing today. I hope you all liked it and remember to review! See ya soon![Chapter 14] July 4th April looked at the street she was parked on, not seeing Mike anywhere in sight, so she hit the horn in a pattern in hopes that would make him come out of his house faster. After that he finally walked out with a smirk on his face until he saw her in the driver's seat. \"What the hell are you doing, Asher?\" \"I struck a deal with Roma that I could drive my car again if he stays directly behind me, now come on, Banning.\" Mike looked over to Roma in the car behind her as he just shrugged, not really knowing how she talked herself into that deal. \"You're a tricky one, Showers.\" He told her as he climbed into the passenger's seat. \"Oh, shut up.\" She spoke as she put the car in drive and began driving, beginning to scare Mike. She really wasn't the best on the road. He was sitting in the passenger's seat, trying to break with her when she was scaring him and holding onto different portions of the car while making sure his seatbelt was as secure as possible. When April saw him, she rolled her eyes. \"Stop being so dramatic.\" \"I will be when we get there alive.\" April rolled her eyes at him again before looking back to the road. \"So, where's Leah?\" The two talked of the other's significant other often as a kind of anchor to keep them reminded that there was no way they were working out anytime soon. \"Um, I don't know she's at one of her friend's houses.\" April almost slammed on the breaks after that. \"And you're not with her?\" \"She told me I could hang out with you instead.\" \"Oh,\" April spoke as she began to shake her head with her eyes shut, not being able to believe how stupid Mike could be. \"No, that's not what she meant.\" \"What do you mean 'that's not what she meant'? That's exactly what she told me.\" April shut her eyes. Mike always was so stupid when it came to reading women. \"No, honey, she meant that you could go with me, but in all honestly she wanted you to go with her.\" \"What?\" Mike asked, almost panicked. \"So now I'm in trouble?\" \"Big time.\" April spoke with a nod while Mike threw his hands in the air. \"Why can't you girls just say what you want?\" April rolled her eyes before turning to look at him. \"Why are men too stupid to pick up on a simple tone of voice que?\" \"Oh, don't turn this on me, I'm in trouble because of you.\" \"Whoa bro.\" April spoke while taking her hands off the wheel quickly before putting them back on, knowing it would freak Mike out. She looked at him out of the corner of her eye, seeing his freaked out face and smiling. Mike just looked at her for a minute while shaking his head. \"You spend too much time with Megan.\" Shortly after, April found a parking spot, turning to Mike and smiling. \"We're finally here.\" \"Thank god I don't have to be in this car any longer.\" Mike spoke, quickly undoing his seatbelt and hurrying out of the car. April angrily pushed her car door open and hurried to Mike, acting like she was about to punch him. They began dancing around each other trying to find out who was gonna dish out the first fake swing and how the other was going to block it. \"There you two are!\" They both turned to see Megan advancing towards them, the two automatically standing up straight again. Each of them took their turns hugging, but after April was done, she was looking around the space near her. \"Where's Troy?\" Megan looked to her after she broke out of her hug with Mike. \"He didn't tell you?\" April shrugged, confused at what had happened. \"He text me saying he couldn't come.\" \"Did he say why?\" April asked, completely confused on why he would tell Megan, but not her. \"No.\" Megan spoke while shaking her head. \"I thought he would have told you before he told everyone else.\" Suddenly April's phone went off and she pulled it out, her face fell, making Mike hurt a little. \"Well, I know now.\" Mike was angered that he would treat her that way. He wanted to go find out where he was and give him a piece of his mind, but he wasn't April's boyfriend. There was nothing he could really do. \"What a fuck head.\" Megan finally spoke, breaking the silence. That's when he remembered that he and April were friends. He could say something as her friend. \"Do you want me to find him and talk to him?\" Mike suddenly asked. \"What?\" April asked, the question throwing her completely off guard. \"No, just forget about it you guys, we came here to have a good time and watch the fireworks. Don't let him ruin our good time.\" \"But he – \" \"Don't let him ruin our time!\" April yelled, cutting Megan off, making her throw her hands up in self-defense. \"Whoa bro.\" \"Stop it.\" Mike demanded. The three of them found a nice spot on the grass, spreading out their blanket before the place could get insanely crowded. Mike and April went off to get the group some drinks while Megan held the spot. Of course Roma was there to follow at least ten feet behind her, so they were never really alone together which was good. It would stop them both of thinking up something stupid. \"Did you ever see about getting tickets to that band you like?\" Mike asked as April held the drinks for both her and Megan. \"No.\" April complained. \"Well, I looked into it and when the tickets went on sale, but a lot of hipsters are into that band and there's a lot of hipsters in Washington so it got sold out really fast.\" Mike smiled at her comment as the two continued walking. April took a sip of her drink before looking back to Mike. \"Are you worried about what's going to happen with Leah?\" Mike simply shrugged while shaking his head. \"She'll get over it.\" April opened her mouth, about to say something, but stopped herself. \"What were you going to say?\" \"Nothing.\" April sighed out like she was irritated with him. \"What?\" Mike asked, getting in front of her with a confused face as April rolled her eyes, an irritated smile pulling on her lips. \"Now you're mad at me?\" \"Yeah,\" April spoke obviously. \"I'm mad at you.\" His face just twisted into even more confusion. \"Leah is a nice person and she does not deserve what you do to her.\" Mike chuckled while shaking his head and looking away from her. \"You don't know the Leah I know.\" \"What did she do?\" April asked, getting in Mike's face again. \"What did she do that was so bad that made you hate her this much? That made you want to cheat on her.\" \"Okay,\" Mike spoke, looking to her, now getting even madder than she was. \"Let's get one thing straight, I didn't cheat on her out of spite.\" \"Well, it sure feels like it with how you ended everything.\" Mike looked around, noticing all the people before pulling her behind one of the food tents for some privacy, knowing they couldn't have anyone listening in on this conversation. When they finally got to a private place, they each put their drinks down in the grass so they could talk efficiently. \"April,\" Mike spoke as calmly as he could in this situation. \"You were not used to get at my wife.\" April looked him up and down, her chest rising and falling heavily, feeling every little curve in his fingers that were gripping her arm. Her eyes rose back to his face, knowing she was about to challenge him, and he loved a good challenge. \"Then prove it.\" He then pulled her in for a hungry kiss they had both been craving since their last. April was gripping at his arms so hard that she was probably leaving scratch marks. Mike cradled her head in his hand, dipping her neck in further to kiss her even better. Mike and April both knew this wasn't right. Especially when Leah and April were actually developing something of a friendship, but they just missed their hands on each other's skin. Mike finally pulled away, his lips lingering as they pulled apart. \"Leah cheated on me first.\" He spoke it so quick, both of them had to replay the sound in their heads again to make sure they heard right. \"And ever since then – \" \"That's the Leah I don't know? The one who did the same thing you're doing right now?\" \"April,\" Mike tried. \"Stay with your wife, Mike. I get that I'm some sort of distraction to you, but leave me out of it.\" April shook her head at him, pulling away from his grasp on her. \"I can be your friend, but I don't think I can ever be your girlfriend again.\" And with that, April picked the drinks back up and walked off, not really caring if Mike followed or not. Mike just continued to stand there, thinking about everything he was protecting her from by staying with Leah. The press. Leah. Himself. Was it all really worth it? By protecting her, he was just causing her more pain. When he finally got back to their spot, April and Megan were laughing and talking like nothing happened. April turned to Mike with a smile as if nothing phasing her like it should have from their last conversation. He smiled back at her, wishing he could have that like she did. She could totally ignore something ever happened, but the only thing he could think about was that kiss. A little after midnight, they began to head back home, April having to drop Mike back off at his place. The car ride was silent, Mike awkwardly looking out his window while April kept her eyes on the road. She finally took a deep breath, the silence killing her. \"I'm sorry for what I said back there.\" Mike shook his head, still looking out the window. \"Don't be. It needed to be said.\" April tightened her grip on the wheel, her breath just getting deeper. \"So that's what we're gonna be? Strictly friends?\" Mike shook his head, finally turning to look at her. \"Nothing more.\" April sat there for a moment, thinking what he had said over before deciding to pull over and unbuckle her seatbelt. \"April,\" Mike spoke, confused by what she was doing. \"I live a few blocks away.\" April took a deep breath, building up the courage. \"Fuck it.\" She whispered before climbing on top of him and giving passionate kisses all over his face. Mike kissed her back and he wanted to continue it, but he just respected her way too much to let this be some sloppy night she was going to regret. \"April, stop.\" He spoke through breaths. \"We can't do this.\" \"Don't you want me?\" She just sounded so hurt and desperate in that moment. Almost like the day he left her. \"Don't you love me?\" \"I do.\" Mike spoke, still struggling to push her off. \"But not like this.\" She immediately stopped, pushing her hair back while looking him up and down again. \"I don't get it.\" She spoke, shaking her head. \"I don't get you sometimes.\" Mike chuckled. \"Yeah, well if you knew what I knew.\" April furrowed her eyebrows at him with a bit of a smile, wondering what he was getting at. \"I broke the friend rule.\" Mike shrugged, smiling at her again. He really wished they would be able to get back to normal sometime soon. Actually, better than normal. \"I'll let it slide.\" April smiled, touching his face one last time before climbing off of him and getting into the driver's seat before beginning the drive to Mike's house again, both having a little smile on their face. They had to work out sometime. When Mike walked into the house, he expected for Leah to be in bed and he wouldn't have to start a fight, but she was there. Waiting for him. Almost like she was just wanting to fight. April's words ran back through his head and just by the tension stinking up the air, he knew this was going to be a huge. \"Hey.\" Mike told her, not knowing what else to say. Leah just crossed her arms, keeping her glare in his direction. \"How was your night?\" \"Leah,\" Mike sighed out, rubbing his head with his hand. This would be the second woman mad with him tonight. \"Can we not do this tonight?\" \"Then when else are we gonna do it?\" Leah threatened, standing up now. \"Because you spend every second you can with April.\" Mike took his hand off his face, throwing it in the air. \"She's my friend. I can't hang out with my friends?\" \"You can hang out with your friends.\" She spoke with a shrug. \"I have no problem with you hanging out with your friends, but when you want to hang out with a pretty twenty year old more than your wife, that's a problem.\" Mike opened his mouth, about to say something, but he knew it wouldn't be worth it. \"I'm not having this conversation with you, Leah.\" \"No,\" she challenged while moving even closer to him. Leah loved to challenge Mike too, but not the way April did. \"You want to have this conversation after I'm too busy to remember what had even happened.\" Mike was gritting his teeth, all her judgement making him so mad. \"What did I do, huh?\" He was raising his voice now, that just seeming to fuel Leah. \"What did I do that makes you like this? Because you know we weren't always like this, we were happy once and I want to know where it all went wrong.\" Leah got close to his face, her eyes fuming. \"From the second April Asher walked into that White House.\" She spun around on her heels so quick and headed to the bedroom as Mike continued to stand there dumbfounded. He followed her, demanding to know more. When he got into their room, she was taking the pillows off the bed and unmaking it, ready to go to sleep after her long night of waiting on Mike. \"What the hell are you talking about?\" \"Oh, come on, Mike.\" She spoke to him obvious. \"I see the way you look at her.\" Mike looked down in thought. He thought the way he looked at her was only visible to him. \"When she's not looking it's like she's the only woman in the room and when she is, your smile takes up your entire face. You're not fooling anyone, Mike.\" Mike continued to remain silent after she said that. He knew he loved April, but he didn't think that Leah would notice it. He actually didn't know that anyone else had noticed it. \"No matter what you say,\" Leah continued, finally getting in the bed. \"You love her, and she loves you.\" Leah pulled the covers over her as Mike continued to stand there. She shut the lamp off, not really caring if Mike was joining her. This was actually probably going to be the last time they would share a bedroom together. Mike continued to stand there in the dark, the shock continuing to possess him. He didn't know how to move or where he would go if he even could. After tonight, his relationship with both of the women was going to change. Leah was glancing through her paperwork when she noticed April in her maroon scrubs walking along side Megan. Leah began gritting her teeth, thinking about her argument with Mike last night. This girl just wouldn't leave her sight. She regretted ever telling her about the opening in her hospital. Now if she wasn't at her house all over her husband, she was at her hospital, being her charge nurse every other week. When April noticed Leah, she immediately felt guilty for what had happened between her and Mike. Not to mention the fact that Mike chose to spend the day with her when he should have been with Leah. \"Give me a second.\" She spoke to Megan, waiting until she was done with her story before approaching Leah. \"Hey.\" April greeted. \"Hey.\" Leah spoke blandly, pretending to still go through her paperwork, not wanting to look at the girl and notice that April had everything she didn't. \"I want to apologize about last night.\" Leah stopped what she was doing, not looking at April, but looking up slightly. \"Mike didn't tell me that you had asked him to go to a party with your friends. I wouldn't have invited him if I would have known.\" Leah smiled slightly. A more annoyed smile than anything. April just had to be the good girl in everything. Leah finally turned to face her, April looking all over her face, not quite sure how to read her emotions in that moment. \"You know April, maybe your patient satisfaction rate would be up if you spent less time talking and more time assuring your patient's comfortability.\" Leah turned on her heels as April's eyes were as wide as they had ever been and she had to blink a few times to let everything she had just told her process. Megan joined April, her mouth dropped as April continued to stand there in confusion. \"What the hell climbed up her ass?\" April had no idea and Leah's attitude had temporarily taken her voice. Leah bent down behind the front desk, pulling out her purse and heading to the front door where Mike was waiting. That was actually the moment she knew she wanted to divorce Mike Banning. When he saw her, he offered a smile, but she just continued to walk past him, at that moment only wanting him for a ride home. April and Mike then looked to each other, not sure what to say, but each knowing that their secret was starting to unravel with Leah. Mrs. HappyAnarchy: I think she'll dump Troy in a few chapters so that will be something for you to look forward to haha. NGArmyWife: Oh my gosh, I know! April is a strong one for having the power to resist it as best as she can. It is Mike Banning! MisfitCarter: Almost to the movie! I think there will be two or three more chapters until we get to the movie action so that will be fun. I will be doing some time hopping so just keep on the look out for it. Kagome309: I hope you liked the storm! I know it's been a while since I updated and sorry about that. I was hoping on getting this chapter up on the fourth, but I was out there celebrating America and singing Toby Keith on the only day of the year I get to, what do you want from me? Haha. I hope your holiday was great and those of you who don't celebrate it, I hope you've had a great time since I've updated last. There should be two to three more chapters until I get to the movie so yay! I hope you all enjoyed and remember to review! Thanks![Chapter 15] December April looked around as everyone else at the table continued to talk. April loved hanging out with Troy, but his friends were another thing. She wanted her friends. And almost automatically after thinking that, Mike and Megan walked in. April got a huge smile before running to the door, Troy didn't even notice as she enveloped them both in a hug. \"We're over here.\" She told them, pulling both of them with her until they reached the table. It took Troy a minute to realize they were even there, but when he did, it was a quick hello before getting back into the conversation with his friends. April was obviously irritated with him, but the night carried on, April with her guests and Troy with his even if they were supposed to be meeting each other's friends. After a while, April began getting twitchy, knowing her addiction was calling. \"Hey,\" April spoke, interrupting a talk between Troy and one of his friends. \"I'm gonna go out for a smoke.\" It was something she developed after her mom died. She wasn't proud of it and she knew she should probably quit, but it was such a load off from real life. \"Okay.\" He spoke like he was confused as to why she was telling him. April sighed as he turned back to his conversation. He probably wouldn't even notice she was gone. Mike rolled his eyes at how blind he was. If he had April, he wouldn't blow her off every time she tried to talk to him. \"I'll go with you.\" Megan offered, also picking up on what Mike saw. \"No.\" April spoke, shaking her head while tearing off the packaging of her fresh pack. \"I don't want you to breathe in all that nasty air.\" Megan opened her mouth, about to continue, but Mike cut in, knowing Megan wasn't gonna stop until someone was going with her especially after her Women's Studies class. \"I'll go.\" April studied him, confused, but pleased. \"You sure?\" \"Yeah, I could use one too.\" He spoke as he picked up his jacket and the two began making their way outside. The bar they were in had a huge window placed behind the bar so you could see all the alcohol carried and watch the bartender make the drinks from outside. That's where Mike and April took their break. April had already taken her fist puff when she saw Mike patting himself, trying to find his lighter. April rolled her eyes at him automatically bringing a flame to her lighter, making Mike smile while letting her light his cigarette. \"So,\" Mike spoke between his puff. \"That Troy kid is one keeper.\" \"Can we not do this here?\" She complained, tilting her head back to blow out some smoke. That's when she noticed snow was starting to fall. \"I'm just saying,\" Mike spoke as his eyes fixated on the snow just like her. \"You have a tendency to be with assholes.\" \"Oh, I've noticed.\" She made a point to give him a dramatic look, making him give her an irritated smirk as she just laughed. \"Let me live my life.\" \"You could do a million times better than that twerp.\" Mike commented, pointing to where he knew they were sitting, stressing April out. If they didn't suspect they were talking about them before, they knew now. \"You need someone who actually likes spending time with you and will actually give you the time of day.\" April rolled her eyes, knowing he was being a complete hypocrite right now. \"Yeah, you're one to talk.\" Mike stopped for a moment, knowing she was taking a jab at his marriage. Once April saw the look on his face, she felt insanely guilty. \"I didn't mean it.\" \"No.\" Mike spoke before taking a hit of his cigarette to take a long pause to think about how to go about this. Especially what he was about to tell her. \"You're right.\" \"I'm not.\" She pressed on, shutting her eyes as she moved closer to Mike. \"You're a great husband.\" \"You're the only one who thinks that.\" He mumbled before looking off into the street. April looked his face all over, sensing there was something he wasn't telling her. She also thought back to how he looked when he came into the bar. He automatically looked…sad. \"What's wrong?\" Mike let out a dark chuckle as April continued to look through his face, running through all the possible scenarios, hoping it wasn't too bad. \"Leah filed for divorce today.\" April had to take a moment to let that process. She was happy, but also sad. Above all, the main emotion stabbing at her was guilt. They didn't have the best marriage before she came along and she knew he didn't love her anymore, but April couldn't help but think that she caused that. And honestly, now that Mike was single, the two had no idea what to do anymore. They had a deal a year ago that when Mike and Leah got a divorce, they were going to go public with their romantic relationship. Well, a year later, they no longer had a steady romantic relationship. They had a rocky shit show, they didn't know where it was going to take them next. \"I'm sorry, Mike.\" That was the only thing she could say. There wasn't anything else that she could think of to make this better. \"Yeah,\" Mike whispered, switching his attention to the snow again. \"You know, it's what I wanted, but now that it's happening it feels…weird.\" April moved closer to him, their arms touching, April hoping that would make him feel better as she laid her head on his shoulder. \"I'm here for you if you need to talk about any of it.\" Mike looked over at April just as she took a hit of her cigarette, smiling a little bit. Getting a divorce was worth it if he and April could be more like this. That's when he leaned his head on April's, knowing that this whirlwind of a change wouldn't be so bad with her by his side. \"I almost forgot.\" Mike spoke, digging his hands into his pocket while April pulled her head up from his shoulder. \"Why don't you take a look at your Christmas present?\" April looked to what he had pulled out of his pocket, instantly gasping and bouncing on the tips of her toes. \"Oh my god!\" She yelled, now jumping up and down as Mike began to smile from her joy. \"You didn't!\" \"They sold out because I bought the last two.\" She looked to Mike, throwing her arms around his neck, too excited for words. She then broke from him remembering her best friend. \"Oh, I have to go tell Megan!\" April threw her cigarette to the side before hurrying back into the restaurant, finding Megan and talking quickly before she could show her the concert tickets. Troy seemed confused as they talked quick just as Mike trailed in behind her. \"What are 'Broods'?\" \"A band.\" April almost screamed at him. \"I've told you about them at least a hundred times. They're my favorite band!\" Troy looked to Mike as he smiled proudly at how happy his gift had made April, immediately feeling defensive. Even if he wasn't the most affectionate towards April, he still loved her. April turned back to Mike, thanking him before throwing her arms around him for another hug. All of it made Troy's chest squeeze from either pain or jealousy. He wasn't sure yet. She was always happy around Mike. She got the biggest possible smile on her face when she saw him. Did that mean she has feelings for him? The longer they stayed like that, the more Troy knew he had to step up his game. April walked with her arm looped through Troy's as they walked into the restaurant for lunch. \"You know you don't have to do this.\" \"I want to.\" He assured as she gave him a confused yet playful glance. Troy had been acting super weird lately. He was being very sweet and charming which was the exact opposite of how he usually was. The two moved to the hostess, April immediately giving her a description of her grandmother, but before she could even finish, Grandmother Asher appeared, squeezing her arm lightly to make her jump. When April's eyes finally fixed on her, she got a huge smile on her face before wrapping her in a hug. \"Hello, Grandmother.\" \"Hello, sweetheart.\" She spoke while giving her back a pat. Grandmother Asher had been trying to see April for the past few weeks, but April was just so busy with finals and friends and work, but today was all about her and her grandmother. And Troy. When she pulled away from her granddaughter, she got a big smile on her face just at the look of her. She really did miss April. \"Grandmother, I would like you to meet my boyfriend Troy.\" He came out from behind April, taking her grandmother's hand immediately. \"It's so nice to meet you.\" Grandmother Asher looked him up and down for a moment before agreeing to take his hand. She knew April got this boyfriend because of everything that happened between her and Mike, but she honestly didn't expect it to go on as long as it did. No one did. \"Nice to meet you.\" She spoke it with such a subtle distaste only April picked up on, making her shut her eyes. \"Come on, I've gotten us a table.\" \"Yes,\" April spoke, putting her arm through Troy's again to make sure her grandmother knew they were still a couple and nothing she said was going to change that. \"Let's.\" When they had settled at their table, Grandmother Asher had asked Troy all the questions as the woman figure in April's life. He passed, but there was still something about him she just didn't like. Maybe it was the sadness in April's eyes when she looked to him and knew that he wasn't Mike. That she would never be able to have what she had with Mike in anyone else. Before they got their entrees, Troy excused himself to go to the bathroom, making sure to press a kiss to April's temple before leaving the table. April watched him walk off and once she was sure he was out of earshot, she leaned in to her grandmother. \"Can you at least pretend to like him?\" \"I never said I didn't like him.\" She countered before taking a sip of her water. \"Oh,\" April spoke, poking at her salad with a fork. \"That unimpressed look says it all.\" \"Well,\" she spoke, leaning in just in case anyone around them could hear what they were saying. \"It's hard to like anyone trying to be with you after how in love I saw you with Mike and how heartbroken you were when it was over.\" April practically dropped her fork on her plate from anger. \"Can we not talk about that for once in my adult?\" \"You shouldn't waste your time on someone when you've already found the perfect someone.\" \"Grandmother,\" April spoke slowly, knowing if she talked any faster she would blow up in her face. \"There's nothing I can do if he broke things off to be with his wife.\" \"What about his divorce?\" April furrowed her eyebrows together. Megan didn't even know about that. \"How do you know that?\" \"I have my sources.\" She gloated before taking another sip of her water. April sighed, getting a slight smile on her face, knowing her grandmother was just worrying about her and her happiness. \"Maybe if the time is right, but not until he's one hundred percent divorced.\" \"I guess I can accept that.\" She spoke with a sigh in fake disappointment as April rolled her eyes with a smile. She really did love her grandmother even if she was insanely nosey. Troy sat back down at the table, April smiling at him, but almost immediately her grandmother began to develop a nasty cough. April looked to her, her brows furrowing in worry. \"Drink some water.\" She advised. Her grandmother just continued to cough, though. It was getting heavier and raspier. \"Grandmother?\" April asked just as she fell out of her chair and to the floor. \"Oh my god!\" April yelled, hurrying to her side. \"Call 911!\" She alerted Troy, automatically doing as she said. April then began to react as a nurse student should, she began checking her vitals, trying to stabilize her until the ambulance arrived. Mike nearly knocked over someone who was in his way as he hurried into the hospital. Leah had text him and lately, she wanted to have the least possible communication with him. But he was happy she text him what she did. It was still burned into his mind from the second he read it at the Treasury. April's in the hospital . He quickly explained to his boss that there was a family emergency and left. He almost left without telling anyone. April was his everything and if she was hurt and he wasn't there for her, he would never be able to forgive himself. He immediately went to the reception desk, asking for her room, almost getting into a verbal argument with the woman on the fact that he wasn't a family member and then hurried to the ICU. A million thoughts ran through his head, but mostly, he wondered if April was okay. He had no idea what was wrong with her and that's what was scaring him the most. She was in the ICU. That was the worst possible place he could picture her. He didn't want to walk in her room and see her unconscious and breathing through a machine. Or worse, he didn't want to see her gasping for breath and shivering in pain. When he finally got down the hall the woman said she was in, he saw April pacing as Troy sat in the waiting room chair and Megan stood near her. \"April.\" Mike breathed out, mostly happy she was okay. When April turned around and looked to him, she had tears rolling down her cheeks as she ran to hug him. He hugged her back, knowing something was wrong, but at the same time insanely confused. He held her as tight as possible as she gripped onto his suit like her life depended on it. \"April,\" he whispered, pulling away from her slightly so he could look at her face. \"What's going on? What happened?\" Megan put a hand to her mouth, hating to see April gasp and cry like that as Troy just looked down into his hands, not sure what to do. \"She was sick.\" April gasped out. \"And she didn't tell anybody.\" \"Who?\" Mike demanded, holding onto her shoulders and leaning down a little so he could look her right in the eye. April's gasps worsened and she ended hiccupping out, \"My grandmother.\" \"April.\" Mike repeated as April nodded, realizing why they told him the correct room number when he said April Asher. She and her grandmother shared the same name. Mike pulled her back in for a hug as April continued to cry. He made sure to cradle her head, thinking back to the moments where he thought he was never going to hold her like that again. He shut his eyes, the two holding each other even tighter if that was possible. Troy just looked at the two and he didn't need any more confirmation. There was something there. The two of them had feelings for each other whether they knew it or not. They pulled away when they heard other people jog into the waiting room they were in. They saw Roma and O'Neil before they saw Ben and Conner. When April saw her dad, she gasped and hurried to him, pulling him into a hug. When Mike saw Ben, he felt insanely uncomfortable. Ben's one request was for him to stay away from his daughter and here he was at the hospital to comfort her before her father could even make it there. Ben pulled away from his daughter, about to question everything that had happened since he received a crying call from April, but Grandmother Asher's door opened up, out coming the doctor and Leah. Everyone looked to the two, hoping for some good news, but knowing the chance was slim. The doctor looked to them all before saying, \"She wants to see April.\" April immediately pushed past everyone and hurried into the hospital room, not really wanting to hear the news anyway. She knew it was just going to be bad. Ben looked to the doctor, moving closer as did Roma and O'Neil. \"What's wrong with her?\" \"Kidney failure.\" He spoke, briefly looking to his clipboard before looking back to the President of the United States. \"And by what I can see, it's been going on for a while.\" \"So why hasn't it been treated?\" Mike asked, almost as if it was the doctor's fault. That's when Ben looked over at Mike, still surprised by his appearance here. The doctor paused for a moment, not sure how to say it, so Leah said it. \"She's refused treatment.\" Everyone let silence pass over them, Megan finally being the first to speak. \"What?\" It was so soft, Roma and O'Neil couldn't even hear it. \"She doesn't want treatment.\" Leah repeated. She didn't care for this family. They were one of the reasons for her divorce, but she would never wish this on anyone. Especially April who they could hear muffled cries from. It wasn't fair for her to lose her mother and then her grandmother just a year later. Everyone was in shock; no one knew how to act or what to say. Until finally Ben spoke up. \"So, what do we do?\" \"We can make her comfortable.\" Tears began to flow down Ben, Megan and Conner's cheeks, but Mike just continued to stand there in shock, everything the doctor continued to say going in one ear and out the other. April could not lose her grandmother. Not like this. Not so soon. The door to her room suddenly opened, alerting everyone to April. Her cheeks were stained with the tears still coming down as she turned to Mike's direction. \"She wants to talk to you.\" Everyone looked to Mike confused. Even Mike didn't expect that, but how could he say no. He moved to the door, giving April's hand a quick squeeze before letting go and walking into her room. Beeps from all the machines hooked up to her took up the whole room. It was the only sound you could hear. It was also dark inside matching the mood in everyone's hearts. The only light was the one above Grandmother Asher's head to be able to see all the buttons and switches just above the headboard. \"Ms. Asher?\" Mike called out once he got to the footboard. That's when she looked up at him and smiled. That was also the moment Mike noticed how skinny she had gotten. \"Mike.\" She responded, her voice as weak as he had ever heard it. \"I would like to talk to you.\" She spoke, sitting up slightly. \"I heard.\" Mike spoke, sitting in the chair placed right next to her bed with a smile on his face. Losing the first April Asher would be a loss to the world. \"Has April ever told you about her grandfather?\" Mike's eyebrows furrowed, not recalling anything. \"No, ma'am.\" \"Well,\" she smiled, thinking of all of her memories with him all over again. \"He was a lot like Troy.\" Mike leaned in a little bit, intrigued in what she had to say. \"Very by the book nice, but in all reality, he wasn't.\" Mike smiled a little bit, shaking his head, not sure what she was getting at, but he wasn't going to say anything. Knowing her, it was all going to make sense in the end. \"The person I loved before him was…magical.\" She looked back to Mike, a soft smile growing on her face. \"What I'm trying to say is, I didn't end up with my Mike Banning for a stupid reason like the one you and April are apart for.\" She laughed a little before her face grew serious, Mike hanging on every word. \"I love my son and I love my grandchildren, so I don't regret marrying her grandfather, but sometimes, I wish I could have had my Mike Banning. Don't let my April end up with the wrong guy like I did.\" Mike nodded, looking down, knowing this was one of her last requests. He grabbed her hand which she gripped as tight as she could with the little strength she had left. \"Yes, ma'am.\" He whispered it, knowing there was nothing else he could say to her. And he intended to follow her request out. So, April dressed in all black for the second time in a year. Everyone came to the funeral held in Pennsylvania. Even Troy. They had it on their old family estate in the bright sunshine. After the ceremony, the reception was held for close friends and family in the huge farm house. Mike was walking around aimlessly with a drink in his hand, feeling quite awkward since the only one he really knew here was April and the Secret Service agents. That's when he noticed April outside sitting on one of the tree swings. April loved their old family house ever since she was a little girl. The tree swings always being her favorite part. When she was little, she and her mother liked to decorate the rope with flowers. She hadn't been out here in so long, she forgot how freeing it was to just sit there, looking out on the now frozen lake and slowly forgetting everything. It was the best place to think or not think at all. Out of the corner of her eye, she saw someone sit on the swing next to hers. She half expected her mother, but she knew that was impossible. When she turned her head and saw Mike, she knew that was the next best thing. She gave him a light smile while he gave her one back. She just looked so beautiful out here, the wind blowing her hair back, the look of complete relaxation on her face while the sun also beamed down on it. He thought back to what her grandmother had told him. April had to end up with him. Not right now. That would be too selfish, but it was going to happen. \"So, who's the girl with the wooden leg?\" April began to laugh, knowing Mike would ask her anything to make her feel better. That's what she loved about him. She almost forgot about Cousin Harley. \"My dad's cousin Harley. If you ask her, she'll tell you a different story every time. I don't think I even know how it really happened.\" \"I thought it would be rude to ask her so I needed the inside scoop from you.\" April looked up at Mike, searching his whole face, wondering where she went right to end up having someone as amazing as Mike in her life. \"Thank you.\" She whispered as her hand moved to place hers on his. Mike simply shrugged at her, wondering the same thing she was. How did he get so lucky? He then looked up to the branch. \"How sturdy do you think this thing is?\" April looked up at the branch holding it as Mike got up. \"Well, my grandmother's uncle Irving used to use it all the time and he's not the lightest – \" She couldn't even finish her sentence before Mike took the rope and spun it quickly. April let out a loud squeal, not expecting it, but glad it happened. Mike then grabbed the rope suddenly stopping it making her laugh more as a strand of hair fell in front of her eyes. \"I wasn't expecting that.\" Mike laughed with her, staring into her eyes, loving that she could find joy on one of her saddest days. \"Wanna go again?\" April bit her lip before nodding excitedly. He ran around her, letting the rope wrap around itself, building up momentum before letting her go to spin. That's when Troy looked out the window, seeing the two. Mike was always the one to make her happy. Always the one to make her laugh. Troy would never know her like he did and he could never bring a smile that big to her face. That's when he knew that he had to do something to keep her. Something drastic. MisfitCarter: Thank you so much! You always have something nice to say that makes my day better. I hope you like the new chapter, love! Mrs. HappyAnarchy: There will be a little more of a respect between April and Leah in this chapter and the next so she won't treat her bad like that for much longer. I hope you liked the chapter, hun! Igor Bionsky: Maybe, maybe not *insert smirk* Kagom309: Thanks for the compliment! Guest: Me too, man. *GASP* What does Troy have up his sleeve? The next chapter is going to be about April's 21st birthday and then we'll jump into the movie. I hope you all liked this chapter and remember to review. Thank you![Chapter 16] March April sat on the couch, trying to look like she didn't care about anything going on. Dr. Tanner sat opposite of her, just staring at April, immediately reading her stance. \"So, April, your father thought you could benefit from therapy.\" \" I think I'm fine.\" April told her with an attitude and a nod. Dr. Tanner crossed her legs, studying her face, trying to look as sympathetic as possible, having seen this time and time again. \"You lost your mother.\" April just didn't say anything to her. \"I understand that you think you're better off without this session, but I'm here to listen.\" She shrugged, April finally making eye contact with her. \"I don't even have to offer you advice.\" That's when April got a thoughtful look on her face before leaning forward to see her face better. \"Have you ever had someone tell you they love you, but then they feel too guilty to be with you or around you?\" Dr. Tanner gave her a confused look, wondering just what she was talking about since this obviously wasn't about her mom, but she was willing to play along. \"I can't say I have.\" \" Well,\" April spoke, straightening up a little. \"That pain on top of the pain of losing your mother is the worst possible thing that could happen to you.\" Dr. Tanner was intrigued, but she told April she was going to listen, not offer any advice, just listen to what she had to say. That's what she really needed right now. Maybe she could move up to offering advice if April continued with the therapy. \"Why don't you tell me what happened?\" April sat there for a moment, looking at her. Maybe she would be able to benefit from someone listening to what she had to say. Hell, she might even like it. As she looked at Dr. Tanner, she knew that she couldn't go out and tell her father or the press what had happened. She had patient/client privilege. Maybe this really was the best person to talk to about everything that had happened in the past year. An outside ear. \"Dr. Tanner,\" she began, knowing she was going to have to start this one from the very beginning. \"Do you know why my secret service detail calls me 'showers'?\" April held her purse as it rested on her shoulder in the waiting room as the memory of her first visit here played through her head. She was bouncing up and down, hoping no one would notice her especially since she had asked Jones to wait outside in the car for her. This was just not something a person in the limelight should be seen doing. Going to therapy. The door to the hallway of offices opened up and Dr. Tanner peaked her head through. \"April?\" April smiled at her, pulling her hat down so no one else would notice her as she got up and hugged her therapist. \"Come on in.\" Dr. Tanner spoke, touching her back to guide her to her office. As April walked, she noticed all the paintings. She hadn't been here in months, thinking she was fine, but the moment she woke up on her twenty-first birthday, she just felt…odd. When she was finally guided into Dr. Tanner's room, she went straight to the couch as she shut the door. April sat down, taking her hat off and putting her purse down to her right as she sat on the middle cushion. Dr. Tanner got her paperwork set as April pressed her legs together while putting her hands on her knees, refusing to get comfortable. When Dr. Tanner finally looked up at her, April gave her a slight smile. \"April, I was surprised to get a call from you for an emergency session since I haven't seen you in a while. How are you?\" \"Um,\" April spoke while rubbing her knees, she had learned a long time ago that there was no lying to Dr. Tanner. \"I've been better.\" \"How are you holding up after your grandmother? I know that was tough on you.\" April let out a long sigh before rubbing her knees again. That was the last time she had seen Dr. Tanner. Right before she left for her grandmother's funeral in December. \"I've been taking it okay, but today just feels different.\" \"What do you mean?\" She asked, putting her clipboard almost all the way to the side. \"I don't know. With it being my birthday today I just feel…\" \"Guilty?\" She guessed since April didn't say anything. She turned out to be right since April nodded. \"That's natural to feel guilty for celebrating after bad things have happened. It is your birthday though, April. Your twenty-first! You're allowed to celebrate and be happy.\" April smiled a little before nodding. \"I just wish my mom was here.\" Dr. Tanner gave her a light smile. \"I know, honey.\" April played with her cloud necklace, Dr. Tanner noticing it immediately. \"How's Mike doing?\" April seemed to perk up a little at the mention of his name. \"He's fine. He moved out yesterday. I helped him.\" \"And how did Leah take that?\" \"She was at work.\" April looked down a little. \"She moved out the day before and someone bought their house today.\" \"Do you think you two are going to get back together?\" April shrugged, a small smile growing on her face. \"I don't know. The divorce still isn't finalized. They're waiting on the last bit of paperwork which could take months to sort out.\" Dr. Tanner nodded. She knew, like everyone else who saw April talk about him, that they were in love. Not just some puppy love either that she saw so often in her office. Genuine love. She hadn't even met Mike, but she shipped it. Just like everyone around them, she shipped it. She wasn't going to let April know that. That would be completely unprofessional. She was rooting for them though. \"So, what are you doing for your birthday?\" Mike had been drenched with sweat after moving all the heavy stuff by himself. He wasn't going to ask April for her help again. It was her birthday. She should be relaxing. Besides, her strength wouldn't be much help. She was more of a master packer. She showed her packing skills off well yesterday, expertly fitting tons of things into one box. Mike looked around at the place, most of the things placed where he wanted them, about to call it quits when he heard a knock on the door. He looked around, knowing hardly anyone knew where his new place was. He slowly moved to the door, wondering who was there, but when he looked through the peephole, he got a huge smile on his face. \"You've gotta be shitting me.\" He opened up the door, giving the woman and the man a bright smile. \"What the hell are you two doing here?\" The skinny redheaded woman walked in without waiting for an invitation. \"Can't a mother come see her son while he's going through a move?\" Mike leaned forward, hugging her tight before planting a kiss on her cheek. He then looked to his brother trailing behind their mom. \"More like Mum got nosy and wanted more information about the divorce.\" Mike rolled his eyes with a large smile on his face before breaking out of the hug with his mom to hug his little brother. \"So what?\" Mike asked as he broke off the hug. \"You two just climbed on a plane to help me move and find out about my divorce?\" \"Well, it's been long enough, dear.\" His mom spoke, her thick Irish accent coming out in every syllable as she inspected the place. She turned back to her sons after taking in the place for a few seconds. \"I like it.\" Mike smiled, about to say more, but then he remembered one important thing about tonight. \"Oh crap.\" \"What?\" Daniel asked, almost freezing where he stood. \"April's birthday is tonight.\" He whispered out, wondering what he was going to do with his mother and brother during that time frame. \" The 'April Asher'?\" His mother asked, Mike rolling his eyes slightly, knowing she was about to get even more nosy than before. \"The President's daughter? The woman you can't stop talking about 'April Asher'?\" \"Yeah.\" Mike spoke, pulling out his phone and going to April's number without even looking up at them. \"That's the one.\" \"What are you doing?\" Daniel asked, leaning against his wall. That's when Mike got a good look at what he was wearing. He had on a dark leather jacket, a white shirt and dark blue jeans along with combat boots. Since when did his brother dress as dark as their hair color? \"Calling April.\" Mike was still distracted by his brother's new clothes when he heard a familiar, \"Hey,\" on the other line. April was out for lunch after her meeting with her therapist. Megan sat with her as she sipped on a sangria, smiling at the fact that Mike had called her after his early birthday wish this morning. She was also feeling just a little tipsy. \"Mike, what's up?\" Megan gave her a flirty face once she found out who she was talking to. Megan didn't want to admit it, but she was also tipsy. \"Hey,\" Mike spoke, a little worried about what she was going to say. \"Is it okay if I bring someone to your birthday tonight?\" April was in shock. \"Bringing someone\" usually meant someone you were trying to sleep with. \"Um,\" April didn't know what to tell him. She thought that once the divorce was finalized, they were gonna work on getting back together. That was the deal. That had always been the deal. April looked to Megan even if she couldn't hear the conversation., not knowing what to tell him. \"I guess.\" \"Are you sure?\" Mike was pacing in his new apartment, worried for what all she was going to say. \"I don't want you to feel uncomfortable.\" April scoffed. Now he was worrying about how she felt. \"Yeah, Mike.\" She spoke sassily. \"It's fine.\" \"Okay.\" Mike was confused by the way she was acting. He didn't find anything wrong with what he asked. He was worrying about how she felt on her birthday. Maybe she was just stressed out with all the party planning. She would be better tonight. \"I'll see you tonight.\" \"See you tonight.\" She spoke blandly before hanging up, completely irritated with Mike Banning. When she turned to look at Megan, about to tell her everything that just happened she had her finger up. \"Hold on.\" Megan spoke, April giving her a confused face. That's when their waiter came over with fresh sangrias to replace their finished ones. April smiled as Megan pointed to her. \"Take a sip and then talk.\" April was walking around the party room of the bar, sipping on her drink. Her father insisted that he paid for the first drink of the night. As the night went on, though, more people offered to buy her drinks as it was her twenty-first birthday. Now, she had to admit that she was drunk. She walked around aimlessly, noticing everyone having fun, but all she wanted was to talk to Mike. She wanted to see who he was bringing to her birthday party. Mostly, she wanted to see if she was prettier than her. It was an hour into her party and Mike still hadn't shown up. She was starting to get irritated and honestly a little worried. That's when Mike walked through the door. Her face completely lit up as she hurried to the door, practically throwing herself into his arms. Ben watched nervously, wondering if the two were still seeing each other secretly, but Mike was the only one noticing he was watching. When she pulled away, she gave him a big smile. \"About time you showed up.\" Mike really studied her, noticing she wasn't standing too good by herself and almost slurring her words. \"Are you drunk?\" He whispered. She leaned in a little bit, laughing the whole time. \"As a skunk.\" \"Oh my god.\" Mike whispered as he pulled away from her, putting an arm around her so she wouldn't fall over. \"Mum, Daniel, I would like you to meet April Asher.\" April straightened up after she heard that. The \"someone\" Mike wanted to bring to her party wasn't someone he wanted to sleep with, it was his mom and little brother he thought the world of. \"It's so nice to finally meet you.\" The redhead spoke as she moved forward, giving her a huge hug. April hugged back feeling extremely awful for being so rude to Mike earlier. When she pulled apart from his mother, she looked to his little brother. \"You must be Daniel.\" April moved toward him, not knowing the proper etiquette for this. Hug him or shake his hand? \"Rock Star talked about me?\" Daniel moved in for the hug, April happy she didn't have to make the decision. She was honestly too drunk for that. \"All the time.\" Daniel moved to her ear, whispering, \"Trust me, dear, he talks about you more.\" April giggled as they pulled apart, Mike looking to the two in confusion. \"What did he say to you?\" Daniel laughed at his brother while shaking his head. \"Don't worry about it, Rock Star.\" April looked to Mike, hearing that nickname for the second time since the three had arrived. \"What's that nickname for?\" \"Nothing.\" Mike answered quickly as the other Bannings began to laugh. \"When Michael was little,\" his mom began as Mike immediately shut his eyes. This was not a story he wanted April to know. Also, she had just called him \"Michael\". \"He would dance around our whole flat to rock songs while belting them at the top of his lungs.\" April automatically began to laugh at the story, Mike shutting his eyes from embarrassment. \"Okay,\" Mike said, putting his hand on April's back. \"I'm gonna steal the birthday girl for a moment, you guys can mingle, get a drink, whatever you want.\" \"Oh, don't worry about us, Rock Star.\" April immediately laughed at what Daniel had to say, making Mike hurry her off even quicker. \"I love your family.\" April whispered to Mike as they sat down at the bar. Mike gave her an irritated look, April suddenly remembering why she was mad at him. \"Hey,\" she almost shouted, taking Mike off guard when she punched him in the arm. \"You told me you were bring someone to my party.\" Mike looked confused. \"I did bring someone.\" \"Mike,\" April spoke slowly, grabbing his hand to let him know she was serious. \"When you tell someone that you're 'bringing someone' to their party, it usually means you're trying to sleep with them.\" Mike looked at her for a moment before giving her a scoff. \"Please, Asher, the only one I want to sleep with is you.\" April slowly gave him a big smile, wondering why she was so worried about that in the first place. She knew Mike was hers. He always would be even if they weren't together. April was really starting to sober up now. Now that Mike was here. Their moment was completely ruined when Troy pushed his way between the two to get to the bar, both Mike and April were visibly annoyed. \"Guys, I have a birthday toast coming in just a little bit if you want to get to the main room.\" They both nodded as Troy gave April a sloppy kiss on the cheek. When he ran off, the two watched him walk off, knowing he was probably more intoxicated than April. \"Marry that boy tonight.\" Mike spoke as April laughed. \"He's a keeper.\" \"Yeah,\" April scoffed as she got off from her seat and the two started walking to the main room. \"Seriously. One hundred percent. The rest of the party is going to take place in a chapel.\" Mike rolled his eyes at her as the two made it into the party room. Everyone around was mingling with each other. Megan and O'Neil. Daniel and Roma. The one that was taking them both by surprise was April's father and Mike's mother. The two of them turned their heads to the side at that sight. That was something neither of them expected. \"Can I get everyone's attention?\" Troy asked, standing in the middle of the room, all the conversations dying around them. \"Thank you.\" Troy then turned his attention to April, getting a big smile on his face. \"April, I love you.\" She smiled a little bit at him as Mike just rolled his eyes while taking a swig of his beer. He couldn't do this toast sober. \"And I want to tell you happy birthday and give you your present in front of all of your friends and family.\" April turned her head to the side, wondering what was so important that she had to have it now. That's when Troy got on one knee while pulling out a ring, everyone around gasping as fear filled April's eyes and Mike had to spit out the beer that was in his mouth. \"April Asher, will you marry me?\" The room had gotten insanely quiet, just waiting on her answer. She looked to Troy on the ground, her father across the room, Megan as she stood there with her mouth gaping and then Mike standing right next to her, his eyes a mixture of emotions. She finally looked back to Troy, taking a deep breath before finally speaking in almost a whisper. \"Can we talk about this privately?\" Whispers immediately took over the crowd, but April couldn't stop looking at that ring. Troy slowly got off of his knee and when he did, April snapped out of her daze, taking Troy by the hand and pulling him into the smaller party room, shutting the door behind them even if the door was almost nothing but windows. Everyone made a crowd around the door, trying to listen as best as they could, but Mike just continued to stand there, still in shock. Tonight, April could not be his anymore. April was pacing as Troy stood there, waiting for her to start speaking. \"What is it? Do you not like the ring?\" \"No.\" April spoke, still pacing. \"It's nothing about the ring.\" \"Then what is it?\" April finally stopped, looking to him like he was insane. \"Maybe the fact that we've barely been together for a year and you're asking me to marry you.\" \"April,\" Troy tried, but April was too hyped up for him to talk. \"Or maybe the fact that everyone here is watching us.\" She then moved to the door, hitting one of the windows, everyone scattering after that, but obviously still looking over to what was going on. \"You love me, don't you?\" April looked to him, going to her go-to answer, but she stopped. Did she really love Troy or love the fact that she could have an out-in-the-open relationship with him? \"I,\" April just couldn't find herself to finish that sentence. She didn't love him. Not really. \"Unbelievable.\" Troy spoke while rolling his eyes at her. \"So, I pour my heart and soul out to you and you don't even love me.\" April scoffed. \"You hardly poured your heart and soul out. It was all of three sentences. Don't be so dramatic.\" \"April,\" he spoke, obviously trying to keep from blowing up on her. \"I just proposed to you in front of everyone you know and you're not going to say yes.\" \"Well I didn't ask you to propose to me.\" She was suddenly getting defensive. It was like he was blaming her for making a fool out of himself. \"No, but Mike is out there so you two go and have a great life since you were such a whore with him anyway.\" April had enough. The second he finished his sentence, she punched him right in the face, taking the attention of everyone outside the room. \"Just for your information,\" April spoke, getting down so he could see her as he held onto his bloody nose. \"I have slept with Mike before, but never when I was dating you. Call me a whore all you want, but I never was one.\" She then stepped over his body and walked out to everyone outside of their private room. She looked at everyone watching, not knowing what to say. \"That was awesome.\" Megan spoke. \"April Asher.\" Her father scolded. Mike just nodded with a big smile on his face. \"That's my girl.\" April smiled back at him as Ben turned to Mike, obviously irritated with what he had to say, but Mike didn't care. He was proud of April for standing up for herself. Mostly, he was happy that in just a few months, they would both completely be single and they could get a fresh start. April woke up the next morning with a pounding headache and a throbbing hand. She looked over to her nightstand where her father had set up a glass of water, pain pills and some toast. She smiled at it, but that was until she felt all of last night coming up. She ran to her bathroom and began puking her guts out. Conner was walking by her room, automatically hearing her throw up, knowing what that meant. \"Dad,\" Conner called. \"April's up!\" After April spent most of the morning not leaving the toilet, she went downstairs, dressed in sweatpants and a T-shirt, knowing there was no way she was leaving the house today. April made it into the kitchen where Ben and Conner were talking, both smiling when they saw her. \"Good morning, April!\" Ben yelled, stopping April in her tracks almost immediately. \"Please,\" April spoke with a hand to her still throbbing head. \"If you've ever loved me, you would stop.\" Conner laughed as he brought her a plate of breakfast. \"Nice greasy bacon.\" April gave her brother a dirty look. \"You know, I can't wait for the day of your first hangover so I can torture you.\" \"I won't be stupid enough to get a hangover.\" \"Oh,\" April spoke dramatically, giving her brother a dramatic, sympathetic stare. \"Young, sweet, Conner, you will be.\" Ben walked to her, giving her the real breakfast they cooked for her. A lot of bread and no flavor. \"Thank you, father.\" She spoke with happiness. April took a bite of her toast as Ben just watched her. She was done with Troy and Mike was getting a divorce. That meant that the two were wide open for each other. \"Hey, Conner,\" The two looked to their father, a small smile growing on his face because of that. \"Can I talk to your sister alone?\" April got a panicked look on her face as Conner got a confused one before walking out of the kitchen, leaving just those two. April looked to her father, still chewing on the toast in her mouth. \"Yes?\" She spoke through a full mouth. \"Um,\" Ben spoke, not quite sure how to begin this conversation with her. \"I wanted to talk to you about Troy.\" \"Look,\" April sighed out. \"I know I probably shouldn't have punched him, but he asked for it.\" Ben began to laugh while shaking his head. \"No, not that.\" April picked up her toast, giving him a confused face. \"Then about what?\" \"Well, really, it's about Mike.\" April gulped. She didn't know her father knew about any of that, but when she thought back on it they weren't too slick on a couple of things. Hell, even Conner knew about it. \"What about him?\" \"Well,\" Ben started. \"You are both going to be single soon and – \" \"Dad,\" April interrupted. \"I don't want to talk about this with you.\" Ben took a moment, knowing this was going to be hard for him to ask this of her. \"Just promise me you two won't get involved.\" April sat there for a moment, not sure what to say. Of course she was going to get involved with Mike. Nothing would be standing in their way in a few months. \"But, Dad –\" \"Promise me, April.\" April scrunched her eyebrows, not understanding what would be so bad about her being with Mike. She didn't understand why he was asking her this. Mike was a good man and he made her happy. Wasn't that all he wanted for his daughter's soulmate? \"He's dangerous.\" April shook her head at him, all of her anger suddenly bubbling to the surface. \"He's not dangerous, he kept me safe. You just blame him for what happened to Mom.\" With that April threw her toast back on her plate before exiting the kitchen as Ben just continued to stand there. He bit his lip as his eyes watered from her mentioning Maggie and the accident in the same sentence. He then thought back on what he told Mike over a year ago. He had to keep April safe, but was he being completely unreasonable? Mrs. HappyAnarchy: Haha. I love Grandma Asher too. It was hard for me to say goodbye too. Igor Blonsky: Haha. Thanks for calling me brilliant *blushes*. PS: Me too hehehe NGArmyWife: Ugh, me too girl. Am sorry you cried, but also not sorry. Thanks, love!

Thanks![Chapter 17] July 5 th 7:18am April twisted and turned in her bed, being haunted by the night of the wreck in her own dreams. She saw her mother hit her head on the window, the blood trickling down her face. She remembered the second they crashed how the seatbelt dug into her chest. She also thought of Mike. That face of defeat when the car crashed on the ice. With a gasp, April woke up, putting her hand to her head, hating that she had to relive that. Her hands were shaking and she felt cold. Almost like it was her body that hit the icy lake. When April got out of bed and looked at herself in the mirror, she noticed she had tears falling down her face. She quickly looked away, hating the look of her crying. This was not how she wanted her day to start. With her eyes shut, she thought back on what happened yesterday, smiling just a little bit. She had to get ready to go meet Mike because in a few hours, it would mark twenty-four hours that he and Leah had been divorced. 8:30am When Mike woke up to his empty apartment, he stretched out, thinking about last night. It was a relaxing day. Basically everything in Washington DC shut down for Independence Day. So, after he got back from the court house, it was just him and April watching old war movies, eating snacks on the couch and just enjoying each other's company, but it never escalated from there. In all honestly, neither of them knew how to make the first move. I mean they were practically a couple already they just didn't kiss or have sex. They did everything together; they were each other's best friends. She even went grocery shopping with him last week. They were as close as ever, but at the same time, they had never felt farther apart. He was hoping that today when they met for coffee that they would be able to work through everything and maybe establish a relationship. In all honestly, he was just happy that he was able to see her. He got dressed and went to April's favorite coffee shop. It had pictures of all the political figures past and present making her feel more at home. He moved to the direction of her favorite table, but when he got there, he didn't just see April, he saw Lynne Jacobs, the Secret Service Director. He gave the two a confused look as April just smiled at him. She got up, the two meeting in a tight hug, giving April the perfect time to whisper, \"Trust me.\" into his ear. He nodded, knowing there was no one else he trusted more. They all sat down, going through the small talk as Mike ordered his coffee and April began dipping her tea bag in the hot water. \"So,\" Lynne began. \"How was your fourth?\" \"My 'fourth' what?\" April rolled her eyes as she turned to look at him, noticing the indention of where his wedding ring used to be, that guilt hitting her again. Lynne didn't even flinch at his sass. She had grown used to it from years of working with him. \"Fourth of July. Don't be an ass.\" April was out of her daze to look at Lynne. The two had been getting real close since Mike had left and she liked to think that was the one thing that saved her. \"Some people do take holidays, you know.\" \"It was quiet. I went to the courthouse to finalize my divorce and then my ex-wife threw a party.\" He had a fake smile on his face the whole time, making April smile before grabbing his hand, giving it a slight squeeze. Lynne looked back and forth at the two getting a little smile on her face. She was waiting for the day the two got together. \"So, what did you two do?\" April turned back to Lynne, smiling a little bit. \"Sat on the couch and watched movies all day.\" \"And I'm shocked.\" The two were always dancing around each other, never really saying what they needed to say to get the relationship rolling. She thought the minute his divorce papers were finalized they would be on each other before the gavel even fell, but she thought wrong because the two were still awkwardly avoiding their feelings. \"Ms. Jacobs.\" All three of them looked up to see Roma, O'Neil and Jones come toward them. Mike's face fell a little. He thought he was going to have more time with April. \"Good morning.\" She told the group, glancing up briefly from her newspaper. \"How are you, buddy?\" Roma asked, leaning forward to shake Mike's hand, Mike making sure his hand went around April's shoulder making him closer to her. \"Hey, Roma. Good to see you. How's the family?\" April smiled at the sound of Roma's family. She loved hearing about all of their lives and truly cared what was going on. \"The kids are good. Thanks.\" \"O'Neil!\" Mike spoke moving to his hand, snapping right after they let go of the handshake. \"So we missed you for poker last week.\" Roma spoke, all three of the men getting a smile on their faces. \"Where were you?\" \"I miss taking your money.\" Everyone laughed at O'Neil's comment before April turned to Mike to see how he would respond. When everyone saw the way she looked at him, their hearts melted. Why the hell weren't they together yet? \"Yeah, I know. I've been working the late shift.\" Mike scoffed before rolling his eyes. \"Nonstop action over at the Treasury.\" April moved her hand to his again, giving him that squeeze again. He smiled at her, knowing he probably wouldn't be able to make it through the divorce without that little fragile hand squeezing his big ones. \"Well,\" Roma spoke cautiously, knowing it was a touchy subject. \"You gotta do what you gotta do, right?\" Mike nodded and April wanted to change the subject as fast as possible. \"Collecting me already?\" \"Yeah,\" O'Neil spoke. \"Your dad wants you home so we can take care of some last minute stuff.\" \"That's right.\" Mike spoke, looking to April before looking back to the guys. \"You guys got a big day. You got the Koreans coming in?\" Roma shrugged while looking over to O'Neil. \"Business as usual.\" He then turned around to the man who had been awkwardly standing in the back for the entire conversation. \"Hey, I wanted to introduce you. This is Agent Jones. You've heard of Mike Banning, haven't you?\" Mike's arm rested on the back of April's chair with a smile, waiting to hear what stories had been told about him. \"Yeah,\" he spoke, getting a big smile on his face. \"The guy who told the Speaker of the House to go fuck himself.\" April immediately began to laugh as her head fell down as Mike smiled proudly at the fact that this was the moment associated him as he nodded in confirmation. Lynne straightened out her paper with a disapproved face before folding it back up resulting in Mike and April trying to hide their amusement. \"Don't you guys have somewhere to be?\" \"Yes ma'am.\" They all spoke as one before looking back to Mike and April, wondering how they were going to say goodbye. April turned to Mike with an excited glance. \"The Koreans are coming in at seven.\" He nodded, waiting for what she was going to say next. \"Meet me at eight for dinner?\" Mike nodded, a small smile growing, looking at her lips before going back to her eyes. \"Where?\" She thought for a minute before looking back to him with a smile. \"That burger place we went to that one time.\" He laughed before nodding in agreement. \"Burgers and beers.\" \"See ya.\" She spoke, the two leaning in to give each other kisses on their cheeks before she grabbed her purse, stood up and followed her security detail out. Mike watched her the whole time and once they had got in the car and drove away, Mike began thinking about his old job again, the look evident on his face. \"Not getting any easier, huh?\" \"No.\" He answered quickly before taking a sip of his coffee. \"I want back in.\" He spoke suddenly, making Lynne look up from the email she was sending. \"Desk job is killing me.\" \"Mike,\" she spoke as she looked back down to her phone. \"Everyone knows you did the right thing on that bridge. Hell, even the President knows.\" She then looked back to him, throwing her phone on the table. \"He just doesn't want to see you and be reminded of it every day.\" She looked to her coffee beginning to put creamer and sugar in it. \"And then there's April to think about.\" Mike suddenly thought back on what she had told him. He was having dinner with April tonight. The two of them. No Leah. No Megan. No Troy. Just each other. Were they going on a date? Mike opened his mouth, taking a minute to think it over again. \"Did April just ask me out on a date?\" She looked to him with a thinking face on. \"I was gonna ask you if you knew because I was curious about that too.\" Mike gave her a terrified look, wondering what the hell he was supposed to do. Lynne suddenly gave him a smile, shaking her head at him. \"You know, the first time you walked into my office out of the darkness you needed therapy then, never mind now. And you don't exactly do yourself any favors.\" \"Where are you going with this?\" Mike asked, brows knitted in confusion. \"Mike,\" she spoke seriously. \"You have got to learn to get back into the real world.\" Mike nodded, knowing she was talking about April. He had to let it go and be in a real relationship with April. It was time and they had both tugged on each other's sleeves long enough. \"Yeah, that's a good one, Jacobs. Let me write that down.\" That's when she picked up her things, detecting his sass and not wanting to be any part of it. She headed for the door before Mike stopped her from walking out, knowing she was just trying to help. \"Hey, Jacobs.\" She stopped, about to open up the door, looking back to him as Mike's smile grew. \"Thanks.\" She simply smiled at him, giving him a nod before exiting the coffee shop, leaving Mike to think about everything she said. She was right. He had to move on for April if they were ever going to be together. Shortly after Lynne left, he got up from his seat, tipped their waiter and then moved to his car parked across the street. His jaw tightened as he thought of that Christmas Eve all over again. He remembered April laying there, Maggie almost as worse as the condition her daughter was in. He remembered dragging April out of the car as she pleaded for him to stay with her, for him to not go back in the car. Mostly, he remembered the look on Maggie's face when he dragged Ben out of the car and the look of utter pain on Ben's when the car hit the ice. As Mike started driving, he began to think of April. He pulled out his phone, quickly dialing her number, hoping she would answer. But April was too busy in the back of the car going through the points her dad wanted her to look over before he talked with the South Korean Prime Minister. When the phone went to voice mail, Mike sighed obviously a little disappointed, but he loved to leave her messages and she loved when he left them. She loved to go back and listen to them when she was particularly lonely. \"Hey,\" he spoke into the phone. \"I'm just checking in.\" Mike took a moment letting out deep sighs, feeling guilty about the fact that April didn't have a mother anymore because of him. That was the one thing that always got him about being with April. The guilt. \"I'll call you later.\" He took a pause, wanting to get something out after thinking about the accident all over again. \"I love you.\" And with that, he hung up and continued the drive to work. 10:15am \"So,\" Megan began on the phone after April had explained everything to her. \"It's a date?\" April ran a hand through her hair, not really sure what to say. \"I don't really know.\" Megan sighed, getting irritated with the two. Why wouldn't they just get together all ready? \"And you're telling me you spent all day at his house yesterday and nothing happened?\" \"Don't give me that.\" April spoke with an eye roll. \"We're taking it slow.\" \"As opposed to the both of you being single for four months and neither of you doing anything about it?\" \"You're the one who told me not to do anything with him until he was one hundred percent divorced.\" \"Yeah,\" Megan spoke irritated. \"I didn't think you would actually listen to me.\" April rolled her eyes at her best friend again. She was so unreadable at times. \"Besides, he got one hundred percent divorced yesterday. Why don't you two just jump each other's bones already?\" \"It's not just about jumping each other's bones.\" Megan shook her head, knowing April almost as well as Mike did and she was stubborn. \"I'm just saying that as long as you two have been apart and been in love with each other, you two deserve to be together for once.\" April sighed, knowing she was right, but at the same time, she was still holding off a relationship with him again because of how harshly he left her over a year ago. It still hurt her and the thought of being in a relationship with Mike again was breathlessly excited as it was severely irritating. \"So are you gonna call him back from earlier?\" Megan knew this was a touchy subject and she didn't want April to think about it for too long. \"He's at work right now, but I feel like I should. He sounded really torn up.\" \"Maybe trying to figure out if it's a date or not.\" April gave her a smile, wishing she could talk to Megan about this in person. \"Shut up.\" \"Look, I'm pulling into work right now so call me after the date. I should be off by then.\" April nodded, even if she knew Megan couldn't see it. \"I'll call you after the date.\" \"Aw, you called it a date!\" Megan squealed as she walked into the hospital. \"Go to work.\" April complained. \"First day without Leah.\" April smiled, thinking about it again. Leah transferred to another hospital a few days ago and April and Megan were thrilled. It was getting beyond awkward. \"I will enjoy work today.\" \"Love you.\" April spoke dramatically. \"Love you too.\" Megan spoke before hanging up the phone and putting her stuff up before going to clock in and work with her patients. 4:26pm Ben was getting ready in his closet, making sure to put on the watch Maggie had gotten him for Christmas. With that, he felt like she was always with him in some way. When he walked into his room, he got a big smile on his face. His kids were sitting on the couches in his room both with their noses buried in their books. They were the things keeping him going. He sat on the arm of Conner's chair, April finishing up the page she was on before looking up at her father. \"Hey,\" Conner looked up at him, wondering what his father was going to ask him. \"Which one do you like?\" April smiled noticing the two ties in his hands. One blue and one red. Ben already knew she was going to pick the blue one, but he wanted to know what Conner thought. \"I don't know.\" Conner mumbled before looking back down at his book as April smiled at him. Ben looked over to his daughter, the two exchanging a smile before he wrapped the red tie around Conner's shoulders going with April's silent choice. \"Okay, you take that one and I'll take this one.\" Currently, Ben was trying to convince his kids to go on a vacation for the summer. Just a week or two. It was something they really needed since they hadn't spent time as a family in a while. \"We can get some fishing in, hit the bag together, lay by the pool. It'll be fun.\" April sighed, hating that out of all the presidential resorts they could have gone to, he picked Camp David. And she knew Conner was thinking about it too. \"But I hate Camp David.\" April looked up to Conner, a chill running down her back as she thought about how cold she was sitting on that frozen bridge. A hand went to her scar just barely peeking out of her shirt, rubbing it as the stinging pain came back. Ben looked back in his mirror, seeing April's expression, immediately regretting his suggestion. \"Can't we go somewhere else?\" Conner asked hopefully. \"You know, the beach?\" April gave her brother a slight smile as he turned to look at her, knowing he was just thinking about her. \"Yeah,\" he spoke, fixing his tie before turning back to his kids. \"The beach does sound kind of better.\" He sat down on Conner's chair again, looking to his watch before looking back and forth at his kids. \"Hey, I got three minutes, let's run down to the kitchen and get some ice cream.\" \"Yeah.\" Conner spoke excitedly as he put his book to the side. Ben turned to his daughter who was giving him an excited smile. \"What do you say, April? Chocolate chip or rocky road?\" \"Well,\" April spoke as she got up, moving to her father. \"I don't know about you, but I'm gonna have some of the rocky road before you eat it all again.\" He gave her a serious look with a smile creeping out of his lips. \"I don't remember it quite like that.\" \"You really did, Dad.\" Conner spoke, backing up his sister. \"I didn't even have some.\" There was a knock on the door as Ben put his arm around his daughter before looking to the door, a smile still on his face. \"Come in!\" He called. Immediately, Roma opened up the door, looking straight to the President. \"Mr. President, we're ready for you.\" April looked over to her brother, noticing his face falling as Ben looked down to his watch. \"Already?\" \"Yes, sir.\" Roma confirmed with a nod. Ben immediately turned back to his children, April giving him a slight smile, even if she was a little disappointed, she still understood. \"Sorry guys.\" Conner shook his head, a frown still on his face. \"It's okay, Dad.\" He ruffled Conner's hair before giving him a kiss on the top of his head and gave April a kiss on her cheek before he walked out of the room. April took her father's place on the arm of the chair Conner was sitting on, looking to Conner with a smile on her face. \"Hey,\" He looked up at her, still a little disappointed. \" We can still get ice cream.\" Conner got a huge smile on his face as April leaned in close before yelling out, \"Race you!\" And with that, she was gone. \"Wait!\" Conner yelled, throwing his book to the side before running after her down the halls, the staff hurrying to get out of their way. \"That's not fair!\" They all laughed before continuing with their tasks, knowing the Asher kids would always be as hyper and energetic as they were when they first got here. 6:29pm All of Washington DC was flooded with sirens as police escorted the South Korean Prime Minister to the White House. Tourists were intrigued with what was going on, but for the natives, it was just another ordinary day to them. Mike was getting distracted by all of this, wishing he was there right now with all of his friends, doing the job he loved. He promised April they would go out tonight so he looked back to his computer to continue his work. Tourists crowded around the White House to get pictures of what was happening. Inside the White House, all of the Secret Service ran through their preparations one last time to make sure everything was just right before the Koreans pulled into a parking space. Most of the Secret Service was surprised to see Forbes come out of one of those cars, not having much contact with him since he left, but Forbes was like that. They just didn't expect to see him today of all days. Roma was the one to greet the Prime Minister and bring him in as both Roma and Forbes trailed behind to catch up like old friends. 7:00pm Conner laid on April's bed as she brought out outfit after outfit for him to look at. \"Isn't this something you should be doing with Megan?\" \"She's at work so you're my next best option.\" She pulled up the possible shorts that could go with the top she had already showed him. \"Now teal or green?\" Conner studied it for a minute before pointing to the teal one. \"Teal, it makes you look tanner.\" \"Cool.\" April spoke before putting the outfit on her bed next to all the other options. \"So, is this a date?\" April sighed while running a hand through her head again, all of this reminding her of the conversation she had with Megan this morning. \"Why does everyone keep asking me this?\" \"Because literally everyone wants to know if you and Mike are gonna get back together or not.\" \"Look,\" April spoke as she sat down next to her brother, not sure how to talk to him about this when he's never really experienced love like that. \"It's been four months since I broke up with Troy and broke his nose.\" \"And permanently deviated his septum.\" Conner butted in. \"You weren't even there, Conner.\" \"I saw the pictures. His nose is permanently messed up.\" \"Okay,\" April spoke, throwing her hands up like it wasn't really a big deal. \"I might have deviated his septum. The point is that I do want to be with Mike again, but I'm afraid that if we get back together too quickly that it won't work like it used to.\" \"But if you both love each other then why is it a problem?\" April looked down, not sure how to tell him any of this. \"Conner,\" \"April,\" Conner spoke, interrupting her. Conner's eyes were fixed on something outside the window, confusing her. \"Look.\" She turned around to see smoke coming up not too far away from their house. \"Oh my god.\" April whispered as she stood up. Ben was being rushed to the bunker, telling anyone who had a hand to spare to find his children and bring them to the bunker safely. Sirens began to go off, causing April and Conner to panic. April turned to her little brother, knowing she had to act like she wasn't scared. \"It's gonna be okay. We've been through drills before. We just have to get to the bunker as fast as possible.\" She laughed a little while shaking her head. \"It's probably just a fire close by and they want to make sure we're safe. It's just a precaution.\" Conner nodded as she grabbed his hand and began to guide him out of her room. It was like their home was now a ghost town. No one was in it. They had all probably made their way into the bunker and the staff had all left for the day by now. Sirens were still blaring, making their panic rise. When April pulled him to the stairs so they could get to the bunker, shots rang out making them both jump, not knowing where it was coming from. April turned to her brother, looking him in the eye intensely. \"Stay right here.\" He nodded even if he was shaking so hard from his fear. April ran to the nearest window watching as the Washington Monument was being shot down. She put a hand to her mouth, knowing that was something that would haunt her nightmares. 7:06pm Mike was running down the steps of the treasury only having one thing in mind. April. An hour before he was supposed to meet her, this happened. The streets of Washington DC had become a battle zone. People were being shot as every type of military, Secret Service and police units were out trying to protect everyone they could. Mike hurried down the street, yelling for everyone to take cover grabbing the first people he could collect and pulling them down to hide behind a car as shots fell down on the street. Once the plane passed, Mike got up, knowing the one thing he had to do was get to the White House. He ran down the street as fast as his legs could take him, the only thing on his mind being April's safety. 7:10pm \"April!\" Conner called hurrying back to her. April turned around quickly, getting on her knees so she could look right at him. \"Conner, I need you to go into the walls.\" \"But April – \" \"Conner, please, just do what I say.\" She put her hand on his hair, rubbing it back. \"Go by the Lincoln Bedroom, your favorite hiding spot and I'll meet you there. I have to do something really quick, okay?\" \"April,\" Conner cried out as a plead just breaking April's heart. \"I'm scared.\" April let a few tears roll down her cheek, knowing she could break her strong wall down for just a few seconds. \"I know, I'm scared too, but for right now, I need you to be brave.\" Conner nodded as April leaned in to give him a kiss on the head before letting him run off. She watched him until she couldn't see him anymore, hoping he would get there okay. She couldn't stand there all day, though. She had to hurry and she had to get back to her brother. April took off into the direction of the Oval Office and when she got there, that's when the shooting started. April immediately dropped to the ground as her father's office was ripped to shreds by bullets. She screamed throwing her hands to her ears as the bullets kept flying, but she knew it was useless. No one would be able to hear her screams from here. Eventually the bullets stopped, but she still didn't trust to get off the floor yet. That's when she heard an explosion. Tears freely fell down her cheeks as she clutched her hands to her chest. This was a terror attack and she was right in the middle of it. 7:12pm Mike walked up to the gates of the White House, taking everything in. Bullet holes stained the house he once knew like a home. And he knew April was inside there. He ran a hand through his hair as he felt tears poke at his eyes. Was she okay? Was she even alive? April finally got up from the floor and looked out the window. She saw the Washington Monument lie in ruins and she saw people gathered around her house as the smoke blew around it. She put a hand to her mouth, not able to stop the tears from flowing freely. This was her home and they had destroyed it. And in a moment, the stars aligned and both Mike and April happened to glance in each other's direction. April put her hand to the window, dirty and filled with ash as Mike gripped the gate in front of her house, both feeling an insane desire to hold each other. April gasped, the tears stopping in a moment just at the sight of her love. \"Mike.\" She whispered out. Mike gripped the gates tighter, almost finding himself able to hear her voice trickle through his ears and dance around his brain. \"April.\" They stayed like that for a few moments until a nearby bus exploded, breaking the area into chaos again. stormrunner74: Haha I'm sorry. It slipped my mind. Still love you though! Igor Blonsky: Honestly forgive him already Ben! And the doors blocked the sound so he couldn't hear her say that. Mrs. Happy Anarchy: I think we can all agree we hate Troy and glad he's out of the story now. Honestly, who does he think he is? And omg I can't wait for it either. I have the scene perfectly in my head and I can't wait for you guys to read it. CoolCat0720: Here is your daily dose of Mike and April! NGArmyWife: Let them be together already, Ben! Kagome309: Thanks for the support, love! Well, it took me seventeen chapters, but we are now getting to the movie! I'm so excited to write it and I'm excited for you guys to read it. Let me know what you think by reviewing or if you want, you can ask me questions about any of my stories on Tumblr. My username is janaespecter14! See ya next time, loves![Chapter 18] Mike moved toward the chaos as everyone else ran away from it. He could see a few Koreans that must have come from the tour bus looking at each other, a backpack on each of their backs. \"Hey!\" Mike yelled, going to his gun. They moved even closer to the gates, scaring Mike even more. April was in that house. If they blew it up, she would be dead. \"Hey!\" He tried again, but they still didn't listen. Mike finally pulled his gun all the way out, pointing it in their direction. \"Get the fuck down!\" He tried to pull the trigger to his backpack when Mike shot him point blank. He couldn't stop the other guy, though. He went and pulled the trigger, Mike trying to get away as fast as possible, but he was still caught in the explosion, sending him flying in the air and slamming on the sidewalk. Mike's ears were ringing as his body ached. He rolled onto his side, looking up to the window where he last saw April, but she was no longer there. Panic began to set in his body knowing that he had to get in there and none of these sons of bitches were gonna get in the way of him saving her. On the White House lawn, chaos broke out. South Korean officials were killing everyone trying to help and more people came up with guns as a full on battle broke out. Mike moved to his radio, signaling for help, but the radio had suffered too much damage from the explosion. He threw it to the side, rendering it useless. More Secret Service agents flooded out of the White House, but they were just going down like flies. Mike was still set on one thing. Getting in the White House and saving April. He moved to his gun, picking it up and getting up all his strength to stand up and move towards the house. Ben was running his hand through his hair as he moved to the Prime Minister, trying to be as calm as he could in this situation. \"Mr. Lee, we've had a problem. Please have patient with us.\" O'Neil then approached the two. \"Mr. President?\" \"Yes?\" O'Neil turned to look at Mr. Lee and then moved his head for him to follow away from the Prime Minister. Once he was sure they were about two feet away from them, he began talking in a low whisper. \"It's a critical message. The White House is under ground attack.\" Ben looked up to him in panic, not sure what to say or do. \"O'Neil,\" he began in a petrified voice. \"April and Conner are out there.\" April ran though the walls, trying to find Conner. She didn't want to yell in fear that the terrorists had made it into the house, but she was starting to get panicked. He wasn't where she told him to go. If anything had happened to him while she wasn't with him, she would never be able to forgive herself. That's when she stopped, a hand going to her side as she tried to catch her breath. \"Conner,\" she whispered. \"Where the hell are you?\" That's when she looked down, noticing a rock, giving her an idea. She picked it up, noticing it was quite round. \"This better work.\" She whispered before she rolled the rock letting the sound echo in the walls. Once it stopped, she waited for a moment, waiting to hear something from her brother, anything. Even if he yelled at the top of his lungs she would be thrilled. And that's when it happened. She heard something roll in the walls. She smiled, only taking her a moment to pinpoint where her brother had gone. And then she ran as fast as her legs could take her until she almost ran right into her brother. \"Oh my god, Conner!\" She yelled, gripping his face in her hands as she got down on her knees to reach his eye level. \"I told you to go behind the Lincoln Bedroom.\" He just continued to stand there. \"Why didn't you listen to me?!\" Conner looked like a ghost in that moment just staring at his sister. She was getting worried, wondering what had happened to him until he finally spoke. \"April,\" She waited patiently taking deep breaths from fear and the running. \"They're killing people out there.\" \"Get me the Pentagon on the line now!\" Ben commanded as he moved to the control center in the bunker. \"Yes, sir!\" One of the agents yelled, jumping into action as quick as possible. Then, someone in the room did the unthinkable. Forbes turned to Agent Jones standing right next to him and shoved a knife into his brain. O'Neil immediately went to his gun, but Kang jabbed him in the throat, catching everyone else's attention before he shot him. A man threw himself in front of Ben resulting in gun shots all over his torso. Ben caught him as he fell back, easing him to the ground. More people around them were getting shot and stabbed to death, leaving just the important figures and a very confused Mr. Lee. Ben ran up to Kang, but he pulled a gun on him before Ben could even blink. Kang walked toward him, pushing the gun until it touched his forehead before grabbing him by the tie as everyone else left alive were being tied up. After a few moments of intense staring, Kang punched Ben right in the chest, grabbing him by the neck again before he could even fall down. He slowly brought him down, throwing him to where everyone else was being tied up, having one of his minions doing it for him. Mike was able to make it across the White House lawn as Davis ended up getting shot in the neck. Mike placed his arm around him as he continued to shoot at the terrorists before setting Davis down by one of the columns. Mike immediately placed his hands to his neck, trying to stop the bleeding. It was times like this that Mike wished he had April's medical training background. There was nothing he could do as Davis bled out in front of him. Mike cursed before putting his head to the column, wishing there was something he could have done. Mike then put another magazine into his gun before looking to one of the agents by him. \"Where's the President? April and Conner?\" \"I don't know.\" The agent yelled over the gunfire. Mike threw his head back into the column, feeling completely hopeless. How the hell were they supposed to take on all these men? Men continued to pile out of the White House like there was no shortage of them. Mike looked back on the lawn noticing all of them drop to their stomachs. Mike's brows furrowed but then he saw a gun come out of a dumpster truck. He looked back to everyone coming out of the White House, trying to tell them to go back, but they couldn't hear and one by one, they were all getting shot down. \"NO!\" The doors to the White House finally shut, but Mike couldn't help look at all the men lying on the ground covered in blood. He knew these men. Knew their families. And just like that, they had been wiped out. \"Fuck!\" Mike yelled before looking back to the terrorists, noticing one of the men getting up. \"RPG!\" Mike called to the remaining agents, all of them huddling together as the missile shot the doors to the White House open. Once they had the doors blown open, the men got up off the ground and headed to get in the White House. \"Get in!\" Mike yelled to the others. \"Get inside!\" As they ran, one of them got shot to the ground and one stayed back to shoot. Mike looked to him once he was in the White House with panic. He turned to Mike, ready to join him when he was shot in the back. Mike ran to him with fear in his eyes that he was going to have to watch another man get shot. He grabbed the man's hand, but right when he did he was shot multiple times in the chest, ending his life right there on the White House steps. Mike staggered back, wanting to sit there for a moment and process everything that happened, but if he let himself do that, he would have a panic attack and he would never find April. He crawled away from the entrance and began to hurry up the steps. He was up far enough to where he wouldn't be able to be seen, but he would be able to see them as they walked right on in. And it was right there that Mike noticed he had no ammo left. Silently cursing himself for not taking out all these bastards right here and now, he hurried up the stairs in hopes to find April. Upstairs, Roma was leading his own army, taking down everyone who tried to make it past them. A grenade was thrown taking out most of his soldiers, Roma using one of his men's bodies as a shield, crouching down to shoot at them from a distance. The remaining terrorists ended up shooting down the surveillance room door and taking out everyone in there in hopes to take the mansion down inside and out. Roma had run out of bullets in his gun so he leaned over to pick up a spare when his hand was shot. He cursed, bringing it to him from the pain. It was in that moment Roma knew there was nothing he could do to kill these guys. They had the advantage and he was going to die in there, but he was going to do his job. He began to crawl away from them, bringing his mouth piece to him to alert everyone who would be able to hear it. \"Olympus has fallen.\" He said it as many times as he could before the terrorist got near him. Roma knew one thing. He wasn't going down without a fight. He spun onto his back before screaming out, \"Fuck you!\" Shooting him right in the heart with a gun lying near him. After that, Roma was shot to death by the others. Everyone in the Pentagon was in awe, the man behind the computers almost whispering, \"They've taken the White House.\" Everyone at the conference table turned to look to the control booth, fear plastered all over their faces. They had different news stations on all their monitors reporting what was happening as everyone around worked diligently, not at all sure what they could do, but doing everything they could. \"Sir,\" one of the men from the control room reported to General Clegg. \"We have a hot feed from the PEOC.\" Everyone got deathly quiet as the video feed appeared on their large screen. It was Minister Lee, sitting there as tears were running down his face. \"Mr. Lee,\" General Clegg began. \"Are you safe, sir? Is the President with you?\" He didn't say anything, Lynne looking confused, not sure what was happening. \"Sir, can you hear – \" Before he could even finish that sentence, Minister Lee was shot in the head. \"Oh my god.\" Lynne whispered just before Ben was brought up to the camera with a gun pointed at his head. He looked into the camera seriously, knowing the only thing they were thinking about right now was getting him out alive. And he knew, they would do anything to make that happen. \"Don't negotiate.\" After he said that, the man holding him put a hand over his mouth and dragged him away. Kang then came up to the camera with a deadly serious look on his face, everyone scared for what he was about to tell them. \"I have your commander-in-chief, now stand down.\" \"Who are you?\" General Clegg commanded, fear running through his body. \"I am the man in charge of your White House.\" The scariest thing about Kang wasn't what he was doing, it was about how calm he was while doing it. \"Now stand your men down.\" Everyone shared worried looks, not sure what to do. They knew they shouldn't, but this was their president they were talking about. \"Stand down!\" General Clegg finally commanded, breaking the intense silence. \"All units, stand down!\" Just as he got what he wanted, the video feed ended leaving everyone terrified for what all was going to happen tonight. \"Ladies and gentlemen,\" Clegg announced, leaning his palms against the table from worry and stress. \"We are now at DEFCON 4.\" Mike walked through the dead bodies lying around upstairs, taking what guns he could, but while he walked around, he saw all of his friends. He hated to see them like this. Some of the strongest people he knew were lying lifeless in the house they were trying to keep safe. Suddenly, all the lights in the house went off. Mike looked around, knowing these people were the result of it. They had taken out all the power. That's when he heard people in the surveillance room. The door had been blown off as he moved, hearing talking inside. He made sure to make noise so they would come out and once he did, Mike stabbed him in the chest until he was lifeless, dropping his body like it was nothing. Mike took all the guns off of him, making sure to check his pockets. And when he did, he found a picture of April and Conner. The two were smiling brightly with each other, April's arm wrapped around her brother's shoulders. Mike was suddenly filled with anger. They were going to try to kill them. They honestly had the audacity to try to kill April. The picture almost crumbled in his hands as his hands turned into an angry fist. That was the moment he decided he was going to kill everyone in here. He went to the back of the room, pulling out the kill switch from the code locked safe and moved to the computers quickly. He plugged it in, typing in his security clearance to disable the surveillance cameras, a small smirk coming to his face. Good luck trying to track him or April with that. Megan was dragging people into the hospital, one right after the other. In that moment, rank didn't matter. If you could help in any way, you were helping. \"Are we color coding or number coding?\" She asked one of the doctors as they helped someone bleeding out of their head onto a gurney. \"Number!\" The doctor called quickly before moving to the next patient. Megan immediately began taking his vitals, knowing there weren't enough machines around for every single patient coming in. As she took the vitals, the man began seizing. Megan immediately went to work, only thinking about her training, nothing else. She immediately ran to the medicine, pulling out the only things she knew would work to stop a seizure. When she ran back, she saw that he was lying there lifeless. She clasped her hands to her mouth, never having a patient die on her like that. She did what she had to do, though. With shaking hands, she placed the sheet over him. She backed away, looking to her left seeing her purse, knowing her phone was in there. \"Oh my god, April.\" She ran to her phone, dialing her number with shaking hands. She had to know she was okay. This was happening where she lived and there was no news on the President or his family. She shut her eyes once the phone picked up to an automated voice. \"The cellular service in the area you are calling has been suspended temporarily.\" Megan hung up the phone, not knowing what to do. This was her best friend and she didn't even know if she was alive or not. \"I got a head trauma six-year-old girl!\" Megan turned to the doctor wheeling in a little girl with bandages on her head, trying to stop the bleeding. Megan knew there was only one thing she could do. She had to focus on her work and help people. That's what April would want her to do, anyway. 9:08pm \"Bring Mr. Asher over here.\" Kang commanded in the bunker, Forbes complying, cutting off his zip ties as everyone else pleaded for him not to. When Forbes dragged Ben to stand right in front of Kang, he leaned against the computer desk looking as cocky as ever. \"I have no interest in your nuclear launch codes. By now your Pentagon has changed them, no?\" An intense staring match continued before Kang gave Forbes his next command. \"Sit.\" Forbes practically threw him down in his chair, but Ben didn't take his eyes off of Kang. \"Are you from the North?\" He snarled. \"Because you're sure as hell not from the South.\" One of the other minions handcuffed Ben to the chair as Kang moved closer to him. \"I'm working for justice. To give millions of starving men, women and children a chance at more than just substance. To end the civil war your country interrupted so long ago.\" That's when Ben gave him a face you thought you would only be able to see on April. That winning smirk. \"And yes, for a united, prosperous Korea.\" \"It's a whole new world, baby.\" Forbes interrupted, giving him another April look of anger. Ben then looked away from him, showing him that he didn't care about him. \"What's the going rate for souls these days?\" Forbes then turned him around, Ben putting on that smirk again. \"What did you say to me?!\" \"I never would have taken you for a trader.\" Ben snarled out. \"Me?!\" Forbes almost screamed, Ben enjoying that he was getting a rise out of him. \"What about you? You sold this country out long before I ever did. Globalization and fucking Wall Street. What's it cost to buy a presidency now-a-days? Five hundred million dollars?\" Forbes crouched down in front of him, giving Ben the perfect idea. \"I'm a fucking rookie compared to you.\" Ben leaned in, head butting Forbes right in the eyebrow where he knew it would hurt. One of the men pushed Ben back as Forbes stumbled against the railing in there. \"Gotta keep your gloves up, Forbes.\" Ben spoke with a cocky smile, going back to the boxing he used to practice. Forbes pulled his gun out on Ben, Kang interrupting him immediately. He then began to speak something in his native tongue, but Ben could make out two parts of what he said. April and Conner. Ben's eyes turned cold, almost murderous. \"What about April and Conner?\" When Ben didn't get an immediate answer, the anger festered. He jumped out of his seat, one of the men trying to hold him back, but there was so much you could do to keep a man from snapping the neck of someone who mentioned his kids in that way. \"What the fuck are you gonna do with my kids?!\" \"That's the worst thing about all of this.\" Forbes interjected, going back to his calm, cool collectedness. \"We're gonna have to kill your super-hot daughter.\" The terrorists found amusement in it, smiling as he continued to struggle. 9:26pm April leaned her head against the brick, trying not to fall asleep as Conner's head laid on her lap. If something happened while she dozed off, she would never be able to forgive herself. She pet his hair, catching herself mesmerized by him. She remembered when her parents brought him home from the hospital. She was seven and she was not thrilled, but the second she saw her baby brother, it had all changed. He had become her everything and something like that would never change. \"April,\" Conner began. \"Yeah?\" She asked, continuing to pet his hair. \"Where do you think Dad is right now?\" April took a deep sigh. She had no idea where her dad was right now, but the thoughts that were running through her mind weren't good things. \"He's in the bunker.\" She spoke with an obvious shrug. \"And everyone down there is protecting him.\" Conner finally sat up, looking her right in the eye. \"I'm thirteen. I'm not stupid.\" April sighed, not knowing what to say to him. \"Conner, I can't tell you where Dad is right now or if he's even okay, but I can help you feel better.\" Conner nodded before resting his head on her shoulder. Silence passed over them, the two actually feeling comfortable in this hell. \"April?\" Conner began again. \"Yeah?\" \"Do you regret not starting things up again with Mike sooner?\" That question was like a jab to her heart. All she thought about since they got into these walls was Mike. She didn't even know if he was okay. Tears were falling down her face, knowing that if something happened to him, she would feel awful. \"Yes.\" She cried out, the only thoughts that could run through her mind we're Mike and that big smile she loved. 9:54pm Mike moved through the secret doors ending him in the Oval Office. He looked all around, knowing this was the last place he saw April. Things were destroyed and the room was filled with dust and debris, but no blood. He took a sigh of relief, taking that as a good thing. He moved to the hotline, picking it up, but there was nothing on the other line. With a sigh, he moved to the framed picture of the Statue of Liberty which had a code safe behind it just like the one in the surveillance room. When he unlocked the safe, he noticed the satellite phone and everything else in there except the gun. That made a big smile come to his face, knowing why April had gone in there in the first place. \"Good job, Showers.\" He put the satellite phone piece in his ear, immediately dialing the Pentagon number saved in it. In the Pentagon, NSA director Ray Monroe was the first to get the message. \"We have contact from inside the White House. Trace confirms it's the President's sat phone.\" Allan Trumbull leaned forward, completely intrigued and excited to know if the President was okay or not. \"Put it through.\" Mike identified himself, leaving Lynne speechless. She couldn't believe that out of all of her men, Mike was the one inside the White House. Almost after his identification clearance, General Clegg muted the phone, looking to Lynne with skepticism. \"Can we trust him?\" \"Banning was one of our best agents.\" She confirmed without a beat. \"Mr. Speaker,\" Ray Monroe spoke, everyone turning to look at him. \"I just have to say, isn't this the same guy that was removed from the President's detail after the accident where we lost the First Lady and had an alleged affair with the First Daughter?\" \"Ray!\" Lynne spoke, trying to cut him off to defend Mike. \"What is he doing in the White House?\" \"Ray, you wanna add something I suggest you get your facts straight.\" \"I'm just saying, how do we know we can trust this guy?\" \"Banning is ex-Special Forces, Ranger battalion. He will move mountains or die trying. And he will do anything to save that family. Especially locate April and Conner.\" Allan nodded, knowing if they could have one guy stuck in this, they were lucky it was him. \"I know him.\" He looked around the room, knowing that a lot of people around were second guessing this decision. \"Does anyone else in this room have any intelligence coming out of the White House?\" Everyone was silent, confirming the answer they all knew. \"Then we have no choice.\" He unmuted the call, Mike expecting it, knowing they had to talk it over. \"The President's in the bunker. He's being held hostage.\" Mike gave them the rundown on what was happening in the White House as he deleted all the classified files, but there was still something poking at his brain. Maybe they knew something about April. \"Where's April and Connor?\" \"We have no status of their location, but they're presumed to still be inside.\" Lynne informed, knowing Mike wanted to know maybe more than all of them in the Pentagon. \"Well, they're looking for them.\" Mike got angry thinking about it all over again. \"They have a photo of them.\" Mike sighed, knowing that even if he had to keep true to his original mission of saving April, he could do something for them too. \"Sir,\" He spoke to Mr. Trumbull. \"I'm here. Use me.\" \"Okay, Banning.\" Lynne spoke, starting to feel a bit of hope for the first time all night. \"Sit tight. We'll get back with you.\" When the call ended, Mike looked around at all the pictures on the President's desk, but one stood out among the others. It was a picture of him and April. It had to have been before her mom's death. Hell, before they even realized they were in love with each other. They were both laughing, a sparkle in both of their eyes. They were in love even then. They were just too stupid to notice. Mike began to laugh, tears poking at his eyes just wishing she was next to him. He almost wished they could go back. 11:56pm Mike had gotten the information on Cerberus, getting more guns and body armor from other members of the terrorist situation. And Kang also found out about Mike. A crew was on the way to find and kill him. Mike moved into the Lincoln Bedroom, April hearing the door close from inside the walls. Conner held onto her shirt from fear as she pushed her gun out. She had been to the shooting range before. With her dad and with Mike. She was also told she was a pretty good shot. She was hoping she could be a good shot on someone trying to kill them. Mike moved into the walls, April and Conner able to hear the secret door open and close. April steadied her grip on the gun as Conner placed a hand on his mouth to quiet his breathing. They could hear the footsteps getting closer. April didn't want to shoot, but she knew if this was someone trying to kill them, she would have to. Both Mike and April stepped out from behind the corner, guns trained on each other, but when they noticed it was each other, April dropped hers as Mike let his fall to the side. \"Mike.\" She whispered from happiness before throwing herself into his arms. Neither of them wasted any time, their lips crashing together. April never wanted to let go. She felt safe for the first time in the whole day. Mike pulled away noticing the tears flowing down April's face. With a smile, he wiped one away from her cheek with his thumb, staring at her with loving eyes. \"I found you.\" April gasped a little from the tears before giving him a smile. \"I knew you would.\" \"Mike!\" Conner yelled as he ran to him, Mike immediately scooping him up in his arms for a tight hug, but April was still holding onto Mike's arm. She knew it was crazy, but she felt like if she didn't hold him, he wouldn't be there anymore. Mike looked to April, still embracing Conner. \"Are you two okay?\" \"We're fine.\" She whispered to him as he put Conner down, all of them getting down so they could discuss their next move from there. \"I see this is still your favorite hiding place, huh?\" Mike turned to the ear piece in his ear. \"I found Showers and Sparkplug. They're safe. I'm bringing them out.\" April looked to him confused. The way he said that. It was like he didn't plan on coming with them. \"What about my dad?\" Conner asked, worry all through his voice, bringing April back to the moment. \"Your dad's gonna be fine, okay? Nothing bad is going to happen.\" Mike turned to April, grabbing her hand, knowing she didn't believe that for one second. \"We're gonna get him out of here.\" April nodded to him when they heard steps just outside. April automatically grabbed her gun from the ground as Mike put a finger to his lips. The three began to slowly stand up, Mike wrapping his arm around April as April wrapped hers around Conner. Mike counted to three before they ran, both April and Mike shooting off their guns as the men on the other side of the wall tried to shoot them as well. They made it out without any of them getting hurt and hurried off to make it to the ventilation system, April still holding onto him, but Mike didn't mind. He didn't want to let her go, but he knew he had to get her to safety. That was going to be the hardest part about all of this. stormrunner74: Oh my gosh, I know. I love Lynne. Am still sad about what happened in London Has Fallen. And I know I will continue, but it might not be right away because I have some other fanfics that are waiting on sequels so we'll just see how it plays out, but I'll definitely let you guys know when it goes up. Mrs. HappyAnarchy: The part where April and Mike saw each other through all the chaos had to be one of my favorite things to write so thanks for giving it a compliment. CoolCat0720: Haha I wish I could have put this chapter up immediately after the last one especially since I left off with a cliff hanger. Igor Blonsky: It's the perfect job for him! Hahaha. PS: we're getting close to the killing with bare hands parts hehehe NGArmyWife: I'm so excited for you guys to read it Kagome309: Yes! I was just waiting and am so happy you guys are finally gonna read it. Wow, guys y'all's support has been fantastic. Keep it up! I'm so excited for you guys to read the movie! I don't want to write out every scene in the movie so I skipped around a lot in this chapter and there wasn't much April, but now that Mike's found her, we're gonna get a lot more April! Again, thank you so much for the support and remember to review![Chapter 19] Mike checked the entire area before allowing April and Conner to join him down the stairs. April spent that whole time looking at him. After all of this, she couldn't just leave him. \"Come on.\" Mike encouraged, April taking Conner's hand and leading him down. \"Mike,\" April started, Mike's eyes still focused on getting them to the vent. \"We have to be smart about this.\" \"That's why I'm getting you both the hell out of here.\" He had an edge to his voice, one April didn't like at all. When they got to the vent, Mike stopped, putting his hand on the vent before pushing his forehead to it as April just continued to stare at him. He turned to look at her with apologetic eyes. \"I'm sorry. I've had a day.\" \"You've had a day?!\" She spoke in a hushed whisper. \"I was getting ready to go on a date when my house got shot at and attacked!\" Mike's eyes grew wide, leaning in closer to her. \"Was it a date?\" \"Guys!\" Conner spoke, irritated with their arguing. \"We can do this later when we get out of here.\" Mike turned back to the vent, working on getting the screws undone. \"Jacobs, I got Showers and Sparkplug, they're coming out of the ventilation shaft in the northwest corner.\" \"Sparkplug is.\" April corrected. \"I'm staying.\" \"No the hell you're not.\" Mike spoke, deciding not to be distracted by April. \"How are you two gonna fit through that?\" Conner interrupted before April could say more. Honestly, Conner was tuning out their arguing, just watching to make sure no one else was coming after them. \"You're coming with me, right?\" April put a hand on her hip as she turned to look at Mike who ignored her and simply looked to Conner. \"I gotta go get your dad. And April,\" he turned to look at her as he crouched down to talk to Conner. \"I'm gonna get April out another way.\" April scoffed with an eye roll as Mike turned to look back to Conner. \"You can do this, remember the chimney climb I taught you on the Rose Garden wall?\" Conner nodded but April was still worried about him. She knew he could do this, but she didn't think she would ever be able to shake off how scared she was for him. \"Hey,\" April spoke, moving up to him, pulling his head up so he could look her in the eye. \"Promise me you're gonna be careful.\" He just nodded at her, April hating that she was going to have to leave him. \"I love you.\" He nodded before giving her a tight hug and when they pulled apart, April looked up the vent he was going to have to climb up, wishing there was time to make sure it was completely safe. \"Mike,\" Conner whispered, catching April's attention at the sound of his shaking voice. \"I'm scared.\" April looked to Mike, taking a deep breath, knowing the two adults were freaking out too. They couldn't even imagine what it was like for Conner right now. \"Me too.\" He assured him while rubbing his arms. \"But you're gonna get through it.\" He slowly handed over his Secret Service badge to him, giving him a wide smile. \"You're one of us now.\" Conner took it from with a smile before putting it on his belt. \"I'm counting on you, kiddo.\" Mike picked Conner up by the legs, helping him getting into the vent as April hurried to the stairs, making sure no one else was coming after them. There was suddenly sounds coming from upstairs, April looking to Mike with a panicked face. \"Hold up, Conner.\" Mike advised before hurrying to April, pulling her behind one of the walls to hide and surprise them. He pushed April up to the wall, him standing behind her just waiting until April felt a little something she hadn't felt in a while. \"Um,\" April whispered. \"You might want to check and make sure everything is all right downstairs.\" Mike let out a sigh while shaking his head. \"Yeah, well, I can't control that.\" April turned to him, slightly confused. \"Really? Me in this position turns you on.\" \"Babe,\" Mike spoke in a scoff. \"You in any position turns me on.\" April bit her lip as she looked down with a shy smile. \"We're all still here, Mike.\" Lynne spoke, April being able to hear that too. \"All of us in the Pentagon listening.\" \"Well then I guess everyone in there who had questions about our relationship knows now.\" Lynne rolled her eyes as Monroe nodded in a kind of I-told-you-so way. They began to hear someone come down the stairs, April putting a hand on her mouth to quiet her breath, praying that he wouldn't be able to find Conner. The guy moved up to the vent, Mike grabbing him by the back of the neck and holding him in a choke hold. April came out from behind the wall, all she could do was watch. Mike sat him down as he gasped for breath, holding him there in pain for a long moment before he snapped his neck. He got completely still, making April let out a few panicked breaths before he threw him to the side. Mike moved past her to get to Conner, telling him it was just a false alarm and he could keep going, but April just kept looking at the man Mike had killed. Mike turned her around quickly, making her jump as her breath was quick. \"Are you okay?\" April stuttered for words, looking back to the dead man on the floor. \"You killed him.\" \"To protect you and your brother.\" \"No.\" April spoke as she turned back to him, Mike's eyebrows furrowing at what she was getting at. \"I know.\" April was still struggling for words, not sure how to say this next part. How the hell would Mike think of her after she said this? \"Teach me.\" Mike's eyes got slightly wide before he thought about it. He could use someone on his side in here. April was a great shot and she was a great fighter. She also knew the place just as well as he did. Maybe she was right. Maybe April did have to stay here with him. April sighed, looking to him with pleading eyes. \"We have to smart about this.\" She repeated, now knowing what she was getting at. She wanted to stay with him. She wanted to fight with him and there was no way she was getting out the same way Conner was. It would eat up too much of their time trying to find another way for her to get out. Mike sighed, knowing this wasn't the best idea, but it also wasn't the worst. He moved closer to her. \"You stay behind me at all times, okay?\" She nodded eagerly as he took off his bullet proof vest and began to strap her in it. \"And you keep this on at all times.\" He looked her right in the eye to let her know he was serious. \"You do what I say when I say it.\" He grabbed her face in his hands, making sure she was truly looking right in his eyes. \"April, I'm serious, if anything happens to you out here while I'm – \" April cut him off by leaning in and kissing him, making sure to place her hands on his face as his hands traveled to the back of her neck. When April kissed him, she wanted to assure him in some way that she was going to be okay and that she had learned to look after herself. She hoped he got her message when they pulled away. She stroked his face once, looking into those pretty blue eyes before whispering. \"Everything's gonna be okay.\" \"Sparkplug received.\" Lynne spoke into the phone leaving a huge smile on both Mike and April's faces as they leaned in for another hug, celebrating their small victory. April was just happy he actually agreed for her to go with him! All the nurses and doctors took this much needed lull time to watch the press conference Speaker Trumbull was giving. Megan pushed her way through the crowd to be able to see the TV, hoping on some news on April since her phone wasn't working. \"I want to reassure all Americans and everyone around the world that despite today's events, our government remains one hundred percent functional. We know that the President is alive.\" Megan began to chew on her thumbnail, waiting for more news on the family that didn't come. \"Yeah, but what about April?\" She whispered to herself. A few of the nearby nurses, medical assistants and doctors heard her, immediately turning around to her with fearful looks. That's when she knew that everyone around her was worried about what was going on with their coworker. They just didn't want to say it because that would make it all the more real. \"To our friends, we are grateful for your loyalty and support. As a nation, we are never stronger than when tested. We will remain united and strong. God bless you all,\" Megan looked around to all of her coworkers, knowing they were all as scared as she was, but they had to keep going. They had to continue with their job. That's the only way they were going to help their country and that was the only way they were going to keep their minds off of what was really going on out there. \"And God bless these United States of America.\" April and Mike inched out from where they saw two men walking, Mike starting it off, punching one in the face and kicking the other back. April went to the one Mike had kicked, pistol whipping him, causing him to fall down immediately. Mike turned to look at her once he had finished knocking his guy out. He looked over April's work giving her a proud smile. \"Nice work on the blow to the head. Right where I taught you to hit.\" She looked up at him, giving Mike a proud, cheesy smile before leaning down and dragging her guy off into the Oval Office as Mike followed her. Mike tied each of them down, making sure to put a cloth over their mouths as he and April sat in front of them, April making sure to look like the toughest person she could. \"Hey, asshole.\" Mike spoke once they had woken up. \"Who's running the show?\" Mike was playing with a knife in front of them, making sure to look intimidating, April picking up that he was slightly teaching her what to do. \"Do you speak English? Do they teach you that where you come from?\" They just continued to sit there, looking uninterested in what he was saying. \"Because you know what they teach me, is how to extract information from people like you?\" The one closest to Mike began to laugh, making the other one start to laugh as well. Both Mike and April looked bath and forth at them, Mike starting to laugh with them. \"That's funny, huh?\" He continued to laugh as he looked back and forth at the two. \"Yeah I know it's funny. I get it.\" Suddenly, without any warning, Mike stood up, jamming his knife into the brain of the guy in front of him. April gasped just a little bit before looking away. She knew this was something they had to do. These men were trying to kill them for god's sake. And she knew Mike had to do a lot of things in the military. A lot of killing. But she had never seen him like this. And she didn't know how to react to it. Mike sat back down, rubbing the blood off of his knife on the pants of the other guy, April finding the whole thing sickening. April just kept her mind wondering on if someone was doing this to her. She couldn't think of them as humans though. That was the first rule Mike had given her. She was going to try a lot harder at it now. \"Yeah,\" Mike spoke, looking the only guy left in the eye. \"I guess I'm a little rusty.\" \"Yeah,\" April spoke, looking over the dead guy, reminding herself on what Mike had told her. \"I like your friend though.\" She looked back to the guy, giving him a chuckle. \"He seemed like a real funny guy.\" Mike looked to her, impressed she was catching on so quick. The guy began yelling at her, his voice muffled, but April could already guess he was calling her a bitch. \"What's your leader's name?\" Mike asked, looking back to the man. Mike then began to laugh, realizing something. \"Oh, I'm sorry, here.\" Mike pulled down the cloth over his mouth so they could actually comprehend what he was saying. \"How many men you with?\" He immediately began talking in his native tongue, April putting a hand over his mouth so he wouldn't scream as she gabbed the knife she held onto in his leg. Mike jumped a little as he screamed, not expecting that from her at all. He was now starting to get worried about April. He was glad that she was catching onto all of this so quick, but at the same time, he didn't want her to be so harsh and forget everything about herself. \"In English.\" She snarled before tearing her knife out of his leg. Mike gulped, knowing that maybe they should try couple's therapy after this. Because they were both gonna need it. 12:23am The two got all the information they could on Kang and relayed it back to the Pentagon, Mike now finding a new bulletproof vest from one of the guys they had killed. Now, Mike and April were walking around the house doing some recon. That was until someone came into Mike's earpiece. \"Agent Banning.\" They both stopped dead in their tracks, April giving him a panicked look before hurrying to his ear so she could hear better. \"Yes, I know who you are.\" She looked to him, a mix of fear and anger. This had to be the guy who had taken her dad. \"Welcome to my house.\" April felt her hands close into a tight fist. She wanted to get her hands on him in that minute. Knock that smirk right off of his face that she knew he just had to have on. Mike took out his mouth piece, putting it up to talk back. \"Hey, asshole, what took you so long?\" \"You're the one that let the First Lady die, no?\" April grew rigid at the mention of her mother. Now she really wanted to kill this guy. \"And soon the President.\" Mike's hand immediately connected to April's. If asked about it, he would say it was to calm her down, but in all reality, he needed it just as much as she did. \"Failure seems to be a habit with you.\" \"Yeah, well,\" he spoke as he leaned against one of the walls. \"Maybe I owe you for giving me the chance for making up for that today.\" \"I admire you for acknowledging your failure.\" April was fighting her everything to yell out at Kang and letting him know that he would never be half the man Mike was, but she couldn't. He couldn't know she was there with him so she had to remain as silent as possible. \"But there's no going back. Nothing you try and do here tonight can atone.\" \"Yeah, maybe not.\" He spoke with a shrug. April could tell there was some part of his words that were getting to him deep down. \"But I reckon fucking your shit up will be a pretty good start. You may want to take a headcount. The bodies are piling up.\" \"I have more than enough men to finish the mission.\" He spoke with the shake of the head. \"Oh,\" Mike spoke, almost like he forgot to mention it. \"If you're looking for April and Conner, they're on their way to the baseball game.\" Mike made sure to go over his words in his head a few times before saying it out loud, making sure to say \"they\" instead of \"he\". \"How is April, Michael?\" April looked to Mike with furrowed brows. \"You two did fall in love when you were working in the White House, right?\" Mike turned to look at her, shaking his head the longer he talked. \"What was that like? Feeling her skin and touching her all over while her father worked just a floor away.\" Mike let his head fall back onto the wall he was leaning on, taking deep breaths. \"And she's going to school to be a nurse, huh? She saves lives…too bad she won't be there to save yours.\" \"You know what,\" Mike spoke, being able to put up with all of the crap he threw about him, but having him talk about April was driving him crazy. \"How about we play a game of 'fuck off'. You go first.\" Mike ended the transmission, standing up, not giving April the appropriate time to follow him. \"I'm gonna kill him.\" April sighed, rolling her eyes at him slightly before following after him. Little did they know, someone they would see as a friend was on their way to kill them. Someone they didn't expect at all. Dave Forbes. 1:04am Mike and April walked through the halls in silence, not sure what to really say to each other. It was like this whole thing had stunned them silent. April then thought of something she had been wanting to ask Mike. Something she had kept quiet about for so long she almost forgot she wanted to ask Mike about it. Right now and right here, they could die any moment and she didn't want to die without knowing the answer to this. \"Mike,\" she spoke, breaking their long bout of silence. \"Can I ask you a question?\" \"Yeah.\" He wasn't really looking at her, though. He was looking straight ahead, trying to assess any threat that could come for them. Right now, though, it was quiet. April looked down, knowing this was going to be awkward. \"Why did you break things off when my mom died?\" Mike actually stopped walking, looking straight, trying to figure out how he was going to answer this. \"You never really gave me an answer.\" He turned to look at her, seeing how serious she was. \"I think I deserve an answer.\" Mike shook his head, not sure how to answer her at all before turning away. \"That's a really complicated question, April.\" April sighed, trying to keep her anger at bay, but this was just too sensitive for her to not get angry with him. \"No.\" She spoke with the roll of an eye. \"It's really not.\" She began to walk off, Mike hurrying after her, grabbing her by the arm and turning her around. \"Hey, what did I tell you about staying behind me?\" April ripped her arm out of his grasp before shoving him slightly. \"You're not my boyfriend! You can't control me!\" \"Keep your voice down.\" He hissed in a whisper before looking around to see if anyone had found them. \"No.\" She spoke defiantly. \"I don't care who hears me because I need to get this off of my chest!\" Mike looked around, panicked, but no one seemed to notice them so he turned back to her, letting her do what she had to do. \"I talked to a therapist after my mom died and we talked a lot about you, and do you know what we decided?\" His brows furrowed, waiting for what she had to say. \"That you were scared after what happened and you felt guilty.\" She had to pause, finding herself getting emotional. \"That you would come around. That you would change if you really wanted to be with me.\" She shook her head at him. \"But you know what I just figured out? You won't ever change and I was stupid to think you would. That you would actually do something for me and not yourself.\" She turned around quickly, trying to hurry off as Mike just continued to stand there. He was getting angry. He hurried to her, turning her around again. \"That is not what happened.\" \"I swear to God, Mike, if you grab me like that one more time…\" \" I wouldn't change for you ?\" \"You won't!\" \"I changed everything for you!\" April simply scoffed. Mike knew she deserved the whole story, but he didn't just want to throw Ben under the bus like that. \"You want to know what happened? You want to know why I broke things off?\" She shrugged like it was obvious. He hated to tell her the truth, but this had just gone on long enough. Mike looked down, hating that he was the one who had to tell her this. \"Your dad asked me to, April.\" April was stunned. She had to blink a few times, make sure she heard him right, but she knew she did. Her mouth opened, letting the silence linger before she finally asked, \"Why?\" \"He knew I was too dangerous for you.\" Mike looked away from her, not wanting to look her in eye. \"And he was right.\" She moved toward him, closing the space between the two before cupping his face in her hands. \"Mike.\" She whispered. He finally looked up at her, looking so insanely broken in that moment. \"If you don't know anything else, know this, dangerous things don't happen because of you.\" \"But they happen around me.\" He told her with a nod. \"Mike,\" April almost laughed out. \"I'm the president's daughter. I'm pretty sure they happen around me.\" She brushed his hair with her hands, making their eyes match again. \"I don't care what happens or what my dad thinks because without you, I'm lost.\" Mike looked all over her face, actually wishing they were able to have this talk earlier. They could have saved so much time. \"I love you . I will always love you. You're the one person I've loved through everything, and no amount of chaos could keep me from you. I want you . Not just bits and pieces. All of you.\" Mike looked to her, remembering why he fell in love with her. That compassion was never ending. Here he was thinking about all the ways it could have gone wrong, but April would never let that happen. She loved him and he was stupid to think that would ever change. \"I love you.\" He whispered seriously, making sure to look right into those deep blue eyes as he said it. He had never loved her more. \"I love you.\" She whispered right back before getting on her toes to give him a kiss. No matter what happened tonight, what they saw, it was all a little less scary because they knew at the end of this, they would have each other. That's when they heard someone else walking through the halls. Mrs. HappyAnarchy: Yes, go April! She continues to get slightly more bad ass. CoolCat0720: Here you go, love! Igor Blonsky: Mike's gonna ask him about the picture later on so we'll find out soon. Kagome309: Your review seriously made my day! Thanks, love! I have 88 reviews so let's get this story to a hundred in the next few chapters! That would be super awesome if we can make that happen! I hope you all liked this chapter and April being a little bad ass. She's gonna get a little darker in the next few chapters because I wanted to play around with that survival instinct and what all someone like April would do to survive in this situation. Also, the part where April finds out why Mike broke things off was inspired by All of Your Glory by Broods which the chapter is also named after. So, give it a listen, it's a great song and very Mike/April. Thanks for the read, you guys! Remember to review![Chapter 20] Forbes made his way down one of the hallways, gun pointed straight out. Bodies fell in different places in the corridor as a light swung back and forth, probably coming loose from one of the many bullets that flew through the hallway. He knew his mission was to kill Mike, but he didn't know how he was going to accomplish this. Mike was a better agent and he was way too smart to be snuck up on. It was leaving Forbes with an internal battle. That's when he heard a gun cock back. He froze in that moment as he was grabbed by the shoulders and then thrown into a wall. \"Mike.\" He immediately said once his thoughts were confirmed on who it was. There was one thing that surprised him, though. \"April.\" He thought she had made it out. \"It's me.\" \"Dave?\" Mike asked, completely confused at his presence. \"Forbes?\" \"You two scared the shit out of me.\" \"Jesus.\" April spoke as she pushed her hair back, looking to Mike in panic. \"What the fuck?\" Mike asked Forbes, all of them reveling in the confusion without really asking what was going on. \"Just put that thing down.\" He spoke, noticing April had a gun in her hand too. \" Things .\" They both did as he said, April putting it in the holster of the vest. \"I almost blew your fucking brains out.\" Mike told him with the shake of the head. \"What are you doing here?\" \"I was with the South Korean delegation.\" He explained quickly, both of them nodding their head, that small information making sense. \"What the fuck are you two doing here?\" Mike put his arm around April's lower back as they talked, Forbes taking that information in automatically. He knew Kang was gonna kill April, but he didn't think he would be the one that would have to. That changed things. A lot of things. \"I thought you were working at the Treasury.\" \"Yeah, I am.\" He spoke as he looked over to April. \"Believe it or not, I came in through the front door.\" Forbes began to let out long, relaxing breaths. \"Fuck, April, you must have been scared out of your mind.\" She shrugged in confirmation. \"Why aren't you in the bunker?\" April shrugged, finding herself shaking, thinking about it all over again. \"I didn't get there in time for them to start shooting up the place. I hid in the walls.\" Forbes nodded, knowing they should have checked the walls first. \"God.\" Forbes spoke, throwing his head against the wall as he slid down it, pulling out his cigarettes once he sat down. \"I saw my life flash in front of me.\" He brought out his hand once he had a cigarette in his mouth. \"Look at my hand. I'm fucking shaking.\" Really, he was shaking because he was scared for what was going to happen in the next few minutes. Mike and April both sat down in front of him, April finding herself leaning on Mike. She had actually felt safe finding someone else she knew in here. \"It's good to see you, buddy.\" Mike spoke, putting his arm around her shoulders. \"You've got a funny way of showing it.\" Once he finally lit his cigarette, he offered the pack up to Mike and April. Mike shook his head, but April automatically took one, letting Forbes light it for her. \"I thought we were quitting.\" Mike told her with furrowed eyebrows. \"Um, I just spent five hours trapped in a wall fearing for my life so I think I deserve a cigarette.\" Mike rolled his eyes at her as she blew out her first puff of smoke. Forbes was laughing at the two while shaking his head. \"You two still fight like an old married couple.\" He pointed to their arms. \"You two back together?\" \"Yeah.\" They both answered with a nod without any amount of hesitation making them both turn to each other and smile. It was nice to know they had nothing to hide anymore. \"Hey,\" Forbes spoke, getting their attention back. \"Is the President okay? What about Conner?\" \"They got him in the bunker.\" Mike spoke. \"And we got Conner out.\" Mike chuckled a little while looking around at just the destruction of the hall. \"It's a fucking shit show, huh?\" \"That's for sure.\" Forbes spoke with an eye roll. \"Roma make it?\" April quickly turned to Mike, not really thinking about the other agents until Forbes said something. Mike looked down before shaking his head, April turning away from him with deep breaths. Roma was one of the toughest guys she knew. He was practically indestructible in her eyes. To hear that he didn't make it, that he was dead somewhere in this house, it shook her to the core. \"We've gotta keep moving.\" Mike spoke, standing up suddenly, Forbes following quickly, but April stood up slowly, the thought of Roma still floating through her head. Mike looked behind him and April finally looked up at Forbes. He was looking Mike up and down, almost like he was trying to see how he would take him down. April's head kind of turned to the side as she gripped her cigarette tightly and moved her hand to her holster. \"You got a plan, Mike?\" \"Yeah.\" He scoffed as he continued to look at the area. \"It hasn't worked out so far.\" Forbes laughed while shaking his head, but April wasn't going to take her eyes off of Forbes. Something was fishy about this whole thing. She didn't know if this whole situation had made her paranoid or if it had just made her more aware. In her mind, she came up with a plan of action in case Forbes really was there to betray them. \"Fucking Mike.\" Forbes spoke through that laugh. \"You always were a hard ass. You never change.\" His face began to get serious, April taking a moment to look away from Forbes to give Mike a worried look out of the corner of her eye. \"Hey, Dave.\" He spoke, looking to him with such concern. April looked back to him, shaking, she didn't know what to do anymore. What if she was just reading too much into this? \"This place is getting me rattled, man. I can't think straight.\" \"You okay?\" \"Mike.\" April whispered. He looked to her, not sure what was getting her so shaken before looking back to Forbes. That's when he noticed April's hand on her holster. \"No.\" Forbes spoke with the shake of the head. \"Not for real.\" Mike looked back down to April's hand, noticing she wasn't backing down. \"This fucking Kang guy, he's crazy.\" Both their eyes clicked to Forbes, noticing one detail he had that neither of them shared. \"How do you know his name?\" Mike asked, pulling his gun out of his holster. Forbes looked down to the two and where their hands were, knowing the only way to get to them was to get to the other. \"Hey, Mike,\" Forbes began with a laugh. \"Do you remember New York?\" With that, he threw his cigarette at Mike, throwing him off for a moment as he hit him in the side of his head. April tried to get her gun, but Forbes grabbed her hand, twisting it before pulling her into his chest and putting a gun to her head. When Mike looked to the two, he put his hands up, finger nowhere close to the trigger. April rolled her eyes, hating being the damsel in distress. She decided right there that this was going to be her last time as one. She gripped the cigarette in her hand tightly before slamming it into his eye, Forbes immediately dropping his gun and screaming before she kicked him right in the knee and breaking herself out of his grasp. Mike charged at Forbes once April was clear, throwing him into the next room and into a table. The two wrestled when April ran in, Forbes's holding Mike's gun to the right as Mike pushed his hand away from him. Forbes ended up firing off two shots before April climbed on his back to get him off of Mike, sending her teeth into his shoulder. He backed up with her, slamming her into the wall a few times before she let go from the pain and hit the floor. Forbes moved to her, grabbing her by the neck and lifting her up off the ground as she scratched at his face with what little grip she had. That's when Mike came in, kicking him in the leg right in the spot he knew would break it. Forbes dropped April, April beginning to gasp for breath as Mike jabbed Forbes in the throat. Forbes staggered away a little bit before pulling his knife out on Mike. April watched, fearful for what was going to happen. He slashed at Mike a few times, but he blocked every single one, giving April time to get up and sending a couple punches into his head, making him fall back. Forbes got up again, Mike pushing April behind him, his knife still out. He lunged forward and when the knife looked like it was going into Mike's abdomen, she screamed. But Mike caught his wrist, ripping the knife from his hand and stabbing him right in the heart, causing him to fall right to the ground, disabled to do anything else. April let out deep breaths, feeling hate rush through her body as she saw him lying there like that. This was someone they trusted. He just tried to kill them both. He betrayed her father. All of them. She went forward, kicking him right in the head, Mike having to pull her back before she could do even more damage. Mike slowly walked over to him, crouching down so he could look right at him. Forbes turned to him, blood pouring out of his mouth as April just stood back. If she got any closer to him, she knew she would finish him off. \"Oh, Dave.\" Mike whispered while shaking his head. \"Why did you do it?\" April asked, getting a little closer. She definitely didn't have the sympathy in her voice that Mike had. \"Fuck.\" He whispered, blood pouring out the left side of his mouth now. \"I lost my way.\" April shut her eyes at how broken his voice was. Maybe she was being a little too harsh. The man was dying right in front of her and she was giving him no compassion. That was something Mike always loved about her and she was slowly losing it. \"You can make up for it now.\" Mike whispered as he pulled out the satellite phone, Forbes trying to put his hand over his mouth as an attempt to stop some of the blood. \"Tell Kang I'm dead and help me save the President and April.\" Forbes looked to April, a flicker of a smile crossing his face as he moved to the mouth piece while Mike pressed the button for him. \"Kang, it's Forbes.\" He sounded so weak, that compassion flooding back into April's system. \"I got him. All clear.\" \"Good.\" was the only reply, leaving Mike to shut it off and stuff it back into his pocket. Forbes looked to Mike, nodding, knowing what he had to do. Before Mike could make any movements, April moved toward him, sitting down with him and grabbing his hand. She moved to his face, placing a soft, meaningful kiss on his cheek, looking him right in the eye and brushing his hair back. With that, she stood up next to Mike as he leaned forward, quickly pushing a knife through his brain as April flinched away, not wanting to see what his face was going to be frozen as. 1:32am Ben and Ruth were tied up side by side, Ruth's head hanging in pain from the beating she got from Kang and his men. Ben's head was hung down in thought, mostly of where April and Conner were right now. \"Ruth,\" Ben began, head still down. \"Mr. President?\" She asked, half turning to him. He turned to her with a bit of a smile. \"Rough day.\" \"Could be worse.\" She spoke jokingly with a shrug. \"How's my hair?\" He laughed as he turned to look at her, glancing her hair over before responding. \"Not a strand out of place.\" She smiled too, knowing that was a huge lie. Ben's face suddenly got serious. \"Any regrets?\" \"None.\" She spoke confidently with the shake of the head. \"You?\" Ben looked down, thinking about that for a moment. \"A few.\" His biggest one was forcing Mike and April apart. At the end of the day, no matter how hard he tried to protect her, she could make her own decisions, and Mike got her out of here. He saved her. That and forcing Mike out had to be his biggest regrets. He finally looked up at Ruth with a smile, deciding to go with the less serious regret. \"Like running for president.\" \"The office is lucky to have you, sir.\" She told him seriously, making Ben smile for just a bit longer before going back into his own world, thinking about April and Conner all over again. 1:35am In the Pentagon, they were discussing a plan of attack, one that would go directly against everything Kang ordered them to do. General Clegg moved forward, looking and the footage he was being sent of the White House. \"Looks like there's only four sentries on the roof. With the Air Defense grid gone, they're vulnerable to an aerial insertion.\" \"Wait,\" Mike commanded as he and April both hurried up the stairs. \"Let us get there first and check it out.\" \"We're not waiting.\" General Clegg spoke. \"We have to secure Cerberus.\" Speaker Trumbull spoke as both Mike and April gave each other a panicked look. \"Oh, fuck.\" Mike spoke before turning to look at April as they stood at the bottom of the steps to get to the roof. \"Okay, April,\" he began, trying to look at her as seriously as he could. \"You're gonna have to stay here.\" \"Bullshit.\" She spoke automatically while shaking her head. \"I am going with you.\" \"April,\" he sighed out, almost begging with her. \"Just please listen to me.\" He moved forward, grabbing her hands in his, fear running through her whole body as their eyes met. \"If anything happens to you up there, I will not be able to forgive myself.\" \"And if anything happens to you up there and I'm not with you, I'm not gonna be able to forgive myself.\" April moved closer to him, tears falling down her cheeks now. \"Mike, just stay with me.\" It was hurting him just to look at her. \"We've done our part. Let's just get out of here and we can wait it out until morning.\" She shut her eyes as she let out a gasp from the tears. \"Please, Mike, just don't go.\" He moved one of his hands to her cheek, looking her right in the teary eyes. \"Hey,\" She continued to cry as he rubbed his thumb on her cheek to wipe them away. \"You're the best thing that's ever happened to me, but I am not leaving like that. It's not who I am and you told me you wanted all of me. This is all of me, April.\" April shook her head at him, looking at their hands before looking up at his face once more. \"Why are you talking like you're not gonna come back?\" Mike looked down at that, knowing he was guilty. It was hard to say if he was going to come back with how serious this was all getting. \"Listen to me.\" She was full of distress, but she was going to get this out. \"You're coming back to me. You're gonna find me like you found me before. That's the only rule. That's the only condition.\" Mike moved his remaining hand from hers to cup her face in both of his hands before giving her a soft kiss. When he pulled apart, April was still crying, but he was going to say one thing that would make her feel just a little better. \"I'm gonna find you.\" April gasped just a little bit, wishing he wasn't going, but at the same time, she knew he had to. \"I know you will.\" He hated to leave, but this was the only way he was going to save her and her father. He slowly released the grip he had on her cheeks before backing away. He turned around, not really wanting to look at her as he got to the bottom of the steps in fear that he wouldn't want to do his job. He just had to see that face one more time even if it was crying and broken. He turned around, watching her as she cried. He couldn't just leave like this. Not without saying one important thing. He hurried back to her, grabbing her again, his lips crashing with hers as his tongue invaded her mouth. April rated it as one of the top five kisses they had shared, so good, she didn't want to ever part from him. Mike broke apart, stroking her cheeks again. \"I love you.\" April shut her eyes as she leaned her forehead to his, breathing in his familiar scent. \"I love you.\" The SEALs began their flight to the White House in multiple helicopters, but no one would have guessed that the Koreans were one step ahead, having a drone flying around the area to spy. \"Here they come.\" The woman monitoring the computer reported as she maneuvered the drone to get a better look. Kang moved to his ear piece, pushing it further into his ear. \"Is the Hydra assembled?\" Men were in the supply room just under the entrance to the roof, getting together the last minute checks on the weapon waiting in case they tried anything like this. \"Weapon is ready?\" \"Stand by to repel boarders.\" Kang commanded as the man nodded, taking in the information before moving to the weapon, beginning to rise it up onto the roof. All the men moved to the weapon just as Mike poked his head through, finally getting a visual of what was going on. He moved further into the room, knowing the men were distracted more with getting everything ready. When he moved to the control panel, he saw what this mystery weapon was along with the loads of ammunition they had. \"Fuck.\" Mike whispered, holding his gun just a little tighter. April was downstairs, finding herself pacing. She was just so worried about Mike. If anything happened to him and she wasn't there, that would be the hardest thing for her to take. As she continued her pacing, she began to hear footsteps from behind her. April looked down the steps she was just above, moving a little closer to hear better. She could hear muffling talking in a foreign tongue, causing her to panic for a moment. She looked around, wondering if there was anything she could hide behind. There wasn't anything around, but the shadows. She could hide there. She didn't want this to escalate, but she was prepared to if she had to. Mike began trying to unlock the weapon, but every attempt was a wrong one. \"Jacobs,\" he spoke like he was talking to a child who had just done something wrong. \"You've got to abort this mission. They've got the Hydra 6.\" In the Pentagon, Lynne turned to look at General Clegg who seemed to stiffen at the mention of the weapon. \"What is that?\" \"Next generation weaponry.\" Lynne's eyes grew wide at that. \"Ours.\" \"How the hell would they get that?\" She demanded as Trumbull moved even closer to the screen, feeling like this plan was sinking before it truly started. \"It doesn't matter.\" Clegg said, eyes trained on the screen, not showing the fear haunting the back of his mind. \"We'll take it out.\" Mike was panicking on the other side of the conversation, knowing he wasn't going to be able to deprogram it and these men were flying into their deaths. \"I said abort this fucking mission!\" Mike could hear someone coming into the room, Mike sighing because he knew there was no way he was going to be able to hide in time. Mike ran at the man, pushing his gun to the side before shooting him in the leg and shooting the man coming for him. He then used the first guy as a human shield before shooting the other men trying to come for him. April put her hand over her mouth so she could take the deep, scared breaths she was holding onto. She gripped her gun tighter, finding herself shaking. She could hear the footsteps and conversation getting even closer. She slowly put her hand down from her mouth and let out a slow breath, curling her lips together to make it even slower. April knew what she had to do. This would be the first person she's ever killed. She had to do it, though. If these people got past her, they would go straight for Mike. She wasn't going to let that happen. As soon as they made it up the stairs and onto her level, she pushed her gun out and pulled the trigger. The first one dropped, but there was one more and he had a bigger gun. \"Shit.\" She cursed before hurrying out the way as the bullets sprayed the area she was just in. She ran up the first few steps before turning around and shooting him. His gun stopped, but he wasn't dead yet. He just stood there, still blinking and moving. And his gun was going for April. She shut her eyes as she pushed her body down and shot her gun off four times until she heard his body hit the floor. She was shaking when she opened up her eyes, seeing the two men she had just killed. With her hands shaking, she dropped her gun and let the tears she was holding in fall. She let out desperate cries as she put her hands to her chest. That's when everything she had done tonight rushed to her like a bad dream. She stabbed someone in the leg before demanding information. She shoved a cigarette into the eye of a man she had once called a friend. She had killed someone. Two people. They had families somewhere. All the men she had helped Mike kill had families somewhere. Sure, they were trying to kill her and they took over her house, but she couldn't help this remorse eating away at her. Once the SEALs made it to the White House, the Hydra extended out of roof, shooting down the helicopter in front. The helicopters weaved in and out of the shard of bullets, getting a spray here and there, but dodging the most of it. Mike could see all the bullet shells fall to the ground, knowing that those men were dying out there. Mike killed the last remaining terrorist in the room before ascending to the staircase that would lead him to the roof, making sure to grab one thing he knew would work in taking out the Hydra. An RPG. The helicopters were dropping like flies as well as the crew in them. One helicopter crashed on the White House lawn, leaving all the bystanders speechless. Only two helicopters were left for Trumbull to demand an abort mission. Mike made it to the roof, the wind hitting him hard as he looked at all the madness before him. The helicopters were still shooting, Mike having to hide by the door so he wouldn't be shot. Once the helicopters were making their way out, Mike took that opportunity to take out the Hydra. Once it blew, he was forced down, the explosion shaking his core. The last helicopter had suffered motor failure from the bullets and ended up spinning on its way down, headed straight for the White House. Once Mike saw it coming down, he got up and ran, falling to one of the holes made in the ceiling, holding on so he wouldn't fall through. Then, the helicopter maneuvered, the blades going right for him. Mike was forced to let go, bracing his body to hit the floor. When he thought he was going to stop at the first floor, he ended up breaking through it and ending up on the floor of the Lincoln Bedroom, losing consciousness instantly. Then, the helicopter exploded, taking out a good chunk of the house. April jumped once she heard that. Mike was up there. She turned around, seeing the fire in the floors above. She pushed herself up, her body sore from all the beating up it had taken. She didn't care about any of that though. It was just a minor inconvenience, fresh tears pushing their way to her eyes at the thought of what had become of Mike. \"Mike!\" In the next half second, something knocked against her head, sending her down, face first into the stairs. She took deep breaths as the pain spread before the back of her shirt was forced up and her arms pinned behind her back. The man who had her, moved to the radio on his shoulder as April found herself woozy from the hit she suffered. \"I have the girl. Making my way to the bunker now.\" stormrunner74: Thanks, love! Daniela: Bueno por lo que estoy haciendo esta repuesta en una aplicacion traductor por lo que el lenguaje pude ser un poco mal, pero muchas gracias y me alegro que te guste Abril. Espero que continue leyendo la historia y al igual que este capitulo Mascota: Thanks! They are living in rough times. Mike will definitely try to save them both and April can kind of handle herself now so he won't be as worried about her. Thanks so much, I'm so close! Mrs. HappyAnarchy: She may have gone slightly more bad ass in this chapter. The therapy is much needed. Kagome309: Thanks so much! I don't feel like I'm good at writing action scenes so thank you for leaving me a comment on them. Igor Blonsky: Thanks! The dirty talk was probably my favorite thing to write in the last chapter. And therapy is a given now. NGArmyWife: I know how life is! It's totally fine! Thank you so much for complimenting my action scenes because I feel like my action writing isn't very good. All your comments brought a smile to my face so thank you. And yes, I will be continuing into London Has Fallen, but I'm not sure when that story will be posted as I have others that need some love, but I will definitely let you guys know when it's up on this story! April has been taken! Also, I found out a few days ago that I have the most reviews in all of the Olympus Has Fallen stories which is super cool. We are so close to 100 reviews, I can almost taste it. You guys are awesome for that! Seriously, I don't think I would be able to do this without you. I hope you guys like this chapter and remember to review! Only one away![Chapter 21] Okay, so I never do one of these at the beginning, but this is a special case. HAPPY BIRTHDAY MISFITCARTER! This is an amazing reader/reviewer whose birthday is actually tomorrow, but I'm going to be at work tomorrow so it's going up today. Everyone wish a happy birthday! 2:27am April was forced through the bunker as the doors opened, alerting everyone. Especially the President. \"April.\" He whispered, completely terrified and beginning to struggle on his restraints to get to her. April looked around the room, knowing there was a lot more terrorists than them and there were a lot of bodies on the ground. She looked to the man who was holding her, noticing he was looking to the man with glasses at the computer. This must be Kang. Hate flooded her body, taking in everything. Her father was tied up. O'Neil was dead on the ground. So were other staff members. Her blood was boiling and all the sympathy and compassion she felt earlier completely melted away. She stomped on the man's foot who held her and then elbowed him in the gut. That didn't stop him from covering his mouth with her hand and pulling her back. That's when she knew she had to get drastic. She had gone harsh with the cigarette, but she was about to go animalistic. She opened her mouth, taking one of his fingers in between her teeth and biting as hard as she could. She could feel blood trickle into her mouth, but she wasn't going to stop. She was too pissed for that. She bit until she could feel his finger separate from the joint. With the finger in her mouth, she spat it in the man's face as he continued to cry from agony and fall back. That's when Kang came up, tired of her behavior, finding himself slapping her across the face as hard as humanly possible. April fell to the ground as Ben screamed from anger at him touching her. April's face was stinging. She had never been hit that hard before. It was like a bus had crashed into her face. Granted, she had bit one of his men's fingers off and then spit it in his face, but wow, did she really deserve that. She was forced up, finding herself still stumbling from that slap. \"Michael told me you made it out.\" \"Yeah, and you said you were a South Korean. A friend.\" She spat out. \"Looks like we've all told a few lies today.\" Kang laughed a little at her spunk before looking back over at the President. \"Benjamin,\" he spoke, impressed with her. \"She has your mouth.\" He turned back to her, slapping her again. \"If you touch her one more time, I swear, I will kill you!\" April's head went back from the slap and she spent that moment her father was talking to let the rage boil before she came back and punched Kang when he was looking at her father. He looked back to her angry and then moved his jaw from the hit, finding a small amount of blood coming out of his lip. \"You are Mike Banning's girlfriend.\" He turned to the first man he could find, calling him over, telling him to hold onto her as he went over to Charlie Rodriguez. The Vice President. \"Wait!\" April yelled, struggling to get out of the man's grip. This one was smarter than the last one, though. He was a safe distance from her so she wouldn't be able to do anything drastic to him. \"What are you doing?!\" He moved Charlie to the computer chair right in front of the camera that would show a live feed to the Pentagon. April turned to look at her father, both of them sharing a fearful look about what this mad man was about to do. \"Speaker Trumbull,\" Kang reported to the live feed. \"That was a very foolish undertaking.\" There was a pause before Kang pulled his gun out and shot him in the head, everyone watching and everyone jumping at the sound. Kang turned around, motioning for the man who had April to come forward. He shoved her down in the seat, Jacobs placing a hand over her mouth from shock. She couldn't believe April had gotten down there with that mad man. She had blood on her face and clothes. What everyone in that room didn't know was that it wasn't April's. \"And now, I have your First Daughter.\" April just looked into the camera, angry. Angry at them for not getting her out of this already. Angry at Kang for everything he had done to her so far. Angry at Mike for forcing her to stay, getting her into this mess. Angry at what Kang was going to make them do. He got even closer to the camera, blocking their view of April, April finding herself giving a hateful stare to his back. \"Her and the President are next. You now have one hour to recall the Seventh Fleet and your troops. Once you do so, I want a helicopter on the North Lawn fueled and ready. Sixty minutes.\" He ended the transmission, April still giving a hateful stare to his back. \"Sociopathic pig.\" Kang turned around to look at her, Ben struggling to get a good view of his daughter to make sure he wouldn't hurt her. Kang leaned down, getting in her face, but April never broke her glare no matter how scared she was of this guy. Once he got at eye level with her, he gave her a wide smile. \"That would be your boyfriend.\" That's when April lost it. She punched Kang in the face again, but he wasn't going to have it this time. He picked her up by the hair, April yelping the whole time he forced her stand before throwing her down to the ground, April sliding a little bit at the force. \"Tie her up!\" The men tied her up next to her father, April glaring at Kang the whole time. \"My boyfriend is gonna kill you.\" Kang then smiled as he got down to her level once the men had finished tying her up, April not breaking her glare. \"It'll be hard for him to do that from the grave.\" That's when April took a moment to blink. She almost forgot. Kang thought he was dead. 4:02am Mike's eyes slowly fluttered open, the pain coming back to him like a bad memory. He groaned as he sat up, moving to lean against the bed frame for support. \"Fuck.\" He muttered, thinking about everything that had happened. He didn't even know where April was. He moved to the satellite phone in his pocket, dialing the number of the Pentagon again. Taking deep breaths before they connected. \"Mike?\" Trumbull was the first to speak. Mike had to gather his strength to say, \"Yeah.\" in the raspy voice his injuries would allow. \"We've been trying to reach you, son.\" Trumbull continued. \"Are you okay?\" \"Mr. Speaker, sir,\" Mike spoke, still trying to catch his breath and the spreading pain. \"If we ever get out of this shit storm, you can hold me for insubordination, but your team needs some serious fucking help.\" \"This is General Clegg, Army Chief of Staff, I am ordering you to stand down.\" Trumbull looked over at him, irritated. He caused these men to lose their lives a few hours ago for nothing. Mike's hand turned into a fist, knowing the same thing Trumbull did. \"Remove your only eyes and ears from the ground, that's fucking brilliant.\" \"We need to pull you out of there before we lose another hostage.\" He explained quickly, getting closer to the phone. \"I am giving you a direct order.\" \"Newsflash asshole, I don't work for you.\" That's when Mike began to think about April again. \"And where the fuck is my girlfriend?\" \"General Clegg,\" Trumbull began, deciding he was going to wait to answer Mike's question. That was something that needed a softer approach. \"I'm the Commander-in-Chief, if I didn't absolutely need you, I would relieve you right now.\" \"I will not let this asshole – \" Clegg began, but Trumbull took the challenge, standing up. \"General, I don't want to hear another word out of you unless I ask you a question!\" The whole room got deathly quiet, everyone looking between the two, wondering what was going to happen next. \"Sir.\" General Clegg simply spoke, scared to get into another argument with him. Trumbull turned around to the phone, ready to give him correct orders this time. \"Mr. Banning,\" Mike didn't respond as he found a bullet in his side. \"Mr. Banning, are you there?\" \"Yes, sir.\" He spoke, not wanting everyone on the other end to know he was hurt. \"What's the plan?\" Trumbull took a sigh, hating to say this, but it had to be done. \"We're recalling the Seventh Fleet, pulling back our troops from the DMZ, and giving them a helicopter.\" \"Sir,\" Mike stressed. \"You cannot do that. You cannot give this guy what he wants.\" \"Mike,\" Trumbull spoke in a calm voice, knowing what he was going to say next would make him rethink it all. \"Kang has April.\" Mike's jaw suddenly clenched as his hand became into a tight fist. \"And we don't know what he's going to do to her, but we can only imagine he's going to use her to get the President's Cerberus code by torturing her.\" Mike leaned his head against the footboard of the bed, taking deep breaths, finding himself swallowing the lump that was resting in his throat at the thought of what they were going to do to April. He took a deep breath, collecting himself before turning back to the phone. \"Sir, I've dealt with these types of men before. Give me some time. Let me flush him out.\" \"We are talking about the safety of the President of the United States and your girlfriend, Mike!\" \"We're talking about a hell of a lot more than that, sir.\" The whole room in the Pentagon got quiet as Trumbull let his head fall in thought. \"With all due respect, you're acting President now. And I'm the best hope you've got.\" Trumbull took a minute to think it over before taking a sigh and sitting down. \"Okay, Mike, you've got thirty minutes.\" Mike smiled slightly before nodding and shutting off the transmission. Megan walked through the hospital, a yawn taking over as she made it to the next patient's room. Before she was all the way in the room, Rachel, her charge nurse stopped her. \"You know, Megan,\" Megan looked up at her, shocked, not quite sure where she came from since she was lacking sleep. \"You've done your part tonight, you should go home and get some rest.\" Megan looked around. The hospital had calmed down a lot, but there was still a lot of people who needed attention. \"You need as many able bodied people as you can get.\" Rachel sighed, looking her up and down, worried about her. \"If you think you can handle it.\" Megan nodded instantaneously, making Rachel smile before patting her on the arm. \"You're gonna be a great nurse someday.\" Megan smiled as Rachel moved past her before going to her patient. Laura was teaching her how to put the medication in the IV bag when Rachel knocked on the door, grabbing their attention. \"Hey, Megan, there's a call for you on the landline.\" Megan's eyes got wide, only thinking of one person who know about that line. \"The emergency line.\" April. With shaking hands, Megan handed over the medicine to Laura before hurrying out to answer the phone. \"April?\" She asked excitedly. \"Close.\" Megan's eyebrows furrowed at that Scottish accent. \"Mike, what the hell? How did you know about this line?\" \"April told me about it once or twice.\" Megan rolled her eyes. Of course she did. \"I really need your help right now.\" \"Mike,\" Megan spoke as she shut her eyes. \"Please tell me you're not in the White House.\" \"I'm in the White House.\" Megan sighed again as she slowly opened her eyes. \"Why can't we all just have a normal friendship?\" \"Megan,\" Mike grunted as he moved to lean against a wall. \"I'm shot and I need you to walk me through fixing this.\" \"Oh, Mike.\" Megan's voice was filled with worry as she tilted her head back. She let a few worried breaths happen before calming herself down, thinking about how she would do this if she was there. \"Find a first aid kit, there should be a needle and thread in there, if not, there should be a flare gun.\" \"Yeah,\" He commented as he moved to the first aid kit near the bed, already knowing the idea she had about the flare gun. \"I'm not doing the second one.\" \"You know I don't have to do this at all, right?\" Mike scoffed as he opened up the kit, looking for the needle and thread. Megan looked around, moving the phone closer to her. \"Where is April?\" Mike stopped searching for a moment, knowing she had a right to know. April was her best friend. \"She's in the bunker, being held hostage by some bastard.\" Megan felt fire running through her veins, thinking about what all April could be going through right now. \"You're gonna kill him, right?\" \"After you talk me through these stitches.\" Megan talked him through the whole process until he was completely patched up, Megan waiting a little bit as he put a bandage on his wound before speaking again. \"Mike,\" She spoke it almost as a plea, getting Mike's attention back immediately. \"Get our girl back.\" \"You know I will.\" \"She loves you.\" Megan spoke while shutting her eyes, knowing that if anything happened, April would want him to know that. \"She really does. So, don't just get her back safe, get yourself back safe too…. For her and for me.\" Mike smiled just a little bit, knowing that through all of this, Megan had become his best friend too. \"I will.\" \"Bye.\" Megan said slowly. \"Bye.\" When the line went dead, Mike looked around a little, suddenly feeling alone again. Down in the bunker, April was tied up next to her father, looking over to him with a slight smile. \"How did that meeting go?\" Ben smiled at her while shaking his head. \"It was shit.\" April's smile suddenly went away, thinking about everything that happened earlier. \"Dad, I'm sorry I went so dark earlier I – \" \"Well, I thought you were bad ass earlier.\" April looked up at him, shocked. She thought he was going to be scared to look her in the eye, but it was the exact opposite. \"Really?\" \"Yeah,\" Ben spoke with a shrug before bumping into her shoulder. \"Just like that tattoo on your shoulder.\" April's eyes got wide. \"You know about that?\" \"Of course I do.\" Ben spoke obviously. \"I'm your father, I know everything about you.\" April blinked a few times, that taking her by complete surprise, making Ben smile. \"April, I actually wanted to apologize to you.\" She looked up at her father with a confused face. \"For what?\" \"For a lot.\" He looked down. \"Mostly for getting us into this mess.\" \"Hey,\" April spoke, getting his attention back. \"This isn't your fault. It's fucked up people doing fucked up things.\" He gave her a slight smile. \"April,\" She waited to hear what she had to say, Ben terrified for how she was going to react to this. \"I'm also sorry I interfered in your relationship with Mike.\" April nodded as Ben opened his mouth again, about to say more. \"I know what you asked Mike to do, Dad, and it's okay, I get it.\" \"You know ?\" April got a sudden smile on her face. \"I'm your daughter, I know everything about you.\" Ben wanted to give her a tight hug in that moment and plant a kiss on her cheek, April wanting to do the same. She settled on resting her head against his shoulder as he kissed the top of her head. Almost immediately after their moment, a feed from the surveillance room came into the PEOC. \"What's the matter, Kang?\" April immediately picked her head off of her father's shoulder, just slightly turning her head to the side so she could see half of Mike's face. \"You look like you've seen a ghost.\" April got a big smile on her face, not being able to contain her excitement. \"Mike.\" \"I guess you don't know who you can trust, huh?\" April looked back straight forward, not being able to take the smile off of her face. \"It's over. No more televised executions. No chopper. No more negotiating with you and the United People's Front of Who Gives a Fuck.\" Kang leaned forward, becoming angry that Mike was still alive. \"I will send the President and his daughter out one piece at a time.\" Mike leaned back in his seat, trying not to seem bothered by that image. \"It won't matter.\" April half turned back to him again, slightly offended at what he had to say. \"Because whatever you think you've accomplished you won't be alive to see it.\" Kang looked to the woman on the computer, trying to keep his cool composure. \"Shut him down.\" She went to the computer, about to do the work when Mike decided to speak again. \"Ah, you're not shutting me down, Kang. I'm here to stay.\" He nodded to him. \"Bring my girlfriend over, will ya?\" Kang looked over to the closest guard, nodding for him to bring over April. The men grabbed her harshly before throwing April down in the computer chair in front of the screen, Kang making sure to put his hands on the back of the chair in case she tried anything. Mike gave her a worried once over. Her face had been bruised which made him want to kill Kang even more than he did before. \"You okay?\" April nodded quickly before smiling a little. \"I'd be better if we were able to go out tonight like we were supposed to.\" Mike smiled as well, knowing she was trying to calm him down for a moment and get his mind off the topic. \"I have a question about that.\" She nodded, leaning in her chair a bit, Kang confused at how easy they could act like nothing was happening. \"Shoot.\" \"Was it really a date?\" April thought for a moment. She had the exact same question, but deep down, she was pretty sure they both knew what this was. \"Yeah.\" Mike smiled just a little bit, but his entire face lit up, Kang shocked he was seeing Mike's soft side. \"Sorry, I got tied up at work.\" April laughed at how simple their conversation had gotten. \"Yeah, well I got tied up with the South Koreans coming in too.\" \"Raincheck?\" April thought for a moment before leaning in just a little. \"My favorite breakfast spot. The café we went this morning. Just you and me.\" Mike gulped a little, finding it hard to think about these plans that actually might not happen. \"What time?\" \"Eight sharp, don't you dare be late.\" Mike looked at Kang who was still behind April, all of it making him nervous. \"Don't worry, after I deal with these fucking pricks, I'm headed straight there.\" \"I underestimated you.\" Kang spoke before tilting his head to the side. \"It will not happen again.\" \"There is no again.\" Mike spoke, getting serious again. \"You're gonna die down there alone, cut off from the rest of the world. My advice, save the last bullet for yourself.\" Mike stood up, not even looking at the screen anymore, just staring straight at the camera. \"Because if you don't, I'm gonna stick my knife through your brain.\" Mike then got a wild smirk on his face. \"And don't worry, I'm gonna leak the photos of your body to the press because I know you like that kinda shit.\" April stifled a laugh, finding herself never being more proud of Mike. \"Later, baby.\" And with that, he terminated the connection, looking down, just hoping April would be able to make it out of this. April leaned back in her seat while crossing her arms, a proud smile still on her face. \"I told you,\" Her eyes went up to Kang as she sang it. \"My boyfriend is gonna kill you.\" The woman then turned to Kang with a panicked face. \"He's locked out our video access.\" \"Clock's ticking.\" April spoke in a slow voice, immediately laughing after saying that before Kang grabbed her by the hair again. He looked April right in the eye as he dragged her, April getting in slight punches in the abdomen. \"Let's get something straight,\" he pushed her down next to her father, Ben getting angry all over again as men tied April up again. \"You're dying down here. Your boyfriend is dying out there. There is nothing you can do about it and there's nothing worth fighting for.\" April shook her head as a small smile played at her lips. \"You know what you pricks don't get?\" Kang turned his head to the side, waiting for more. \"You can kill us, but it's not gonna stop there. There's not just one of us, there's millions of us and retaliation is going to happen. You get that, right?\" There was a twinkle of fear in Kang's eyes, April smiling as she leaned back, getting comfortable again. \"And you said you were gonna stop underestimating my boyfriend. He's putting a knife in your brain so watch your back.\" She winked at him letting Kang smile just a tad at that. In all honesty, he felt like he was losing his whole plan. It was slowly dwindling and there was nothing he could do about it. He was losing control and he hated that feeling. He stood up from April, looking to his men. \"Secure the entrance! Leaving now!\" He then turned to the ones tied up. He wasn't ready to kill April just yet. He wanted to make her suffer more. In all honesty, he wanted to kill Mike in front of her. He had to do something to make her squirm for now. He looked to Ruth, knowing how guilty April and Ben would both feel if their Secretary of State was killed. \"Her!\" The men moved to her as she kicked at them, she put up a good fight, but it wasn't good enough as they began to drag her away. Both Ben and April were screaming at them to let her go, knowing she didn't deserve any of this, Kang just smiling at the two as he walked out with the men dragging Ruth out following.

I hope you all enjoy these last few chapters and whenever I post the London Has Fallen story, I will post a chapter in this story just saying that the story is up and what it's called (spoiler alert: I don't even know what it's going to be called). Enjoy and remember to review![Chapter 22] As they dragged Ruth out of the bunker and into the now destroyed White House, she hollered the whole way there. No way she was going down without a fight. \"Fucking idiot.\" She cursed as she was pulled up by Kang's man to only be thrown down again. A man came to help her up as she gave him one of the nastiest faces she had ever given. \"Your leader is out of his mind.\" She whispered as she was thrown into the insanity once known as the White House lobby. \"Go.\" Kang commanded. She was confused by this sudden freedom, but she knew it wasn't much. Kang did have a gun in his hand. \"Walk.\" She turned forward, looking at the vast empty space of the battle zone that it inhabited earlier today. \"Move!\" Kang's voice boomed through the house, alarming her, but making her walk. In the Pentagon, they were watching the news feed, suddenly seeing Ruth walking into the line of sight. \"McMillan.\" Lynne whispered in confusion, wondering what they wanted with her. Everyone waited in anticipation to see what was going to happen, the camera not being able to see Kang focusing his gun on her. Kang couldn't see Mike either, focusing his gun on his men. Shots rang out, alerting everyone, Ruth running, meeting a team who escorted her off the lawn as Mike continued to shoot the men. Kang scattered, but a few men stayed behind, one actually thinking he could sneak up on Mike. Mike grabbed the barrel of his gun before shooting him in the head and taking his gun. Mike advanced into the lobby, not finding any more people around, trying to figure out how he was going to get to the bunker from there. \"Mike?\" He heard Trumbull from the other line. \"Hey.\" Mike answered, fixing the piece in his ear. \"He got away. He's back in the bunker.\" A pause went over the room before Trumbull spoke again. \"You gave it a good shot, Mike. You saved McMillan.\" Mike sighed, knowing that was a good thing, but that wasn't really the girl he was trying to save. 4:25am Trumbull sat at the head of the table, taking deep breaths as the thought on how late it was truly set in. He looked to the clock hanging on the wall, taking a deep sigh, knowing what that time would mean for them and Kang. \"The hour's up.\" He almost whispered. They hadn't figured out any other plan meaning the President and his daughter were going to be taken. \"Send the helicopter, let's recall the seventh fleet.\" He took another deep sigh, hating that he was actually uttering these words. \"Pull the troops out of the DMZ.\" The message was immediately sent, Lynne hanging her head at that. \"We just lost South Korea.\" In the bunker, the woman who was controlling the computer turned to Kang with a wide smile on her face. \"They're recalling the fleet.\" \"Of course they are.\" Kang told her with a smile. April looked around as everyone moved, getting everything ready. She was becoming worried. She wanted to know what exactly they were going to do with that chopper. Exactly what they were going to do to her. A man came up to her and her father as more men moved to release the ones who were still tied up. The man moved forward with a black bag, April moving her head in every which way in hopes not to get it on her head. With the lack of her hands, he succeeded with the bag, cut her restraints and pulled her up. Everyone else got dressed in the black clothing from head to toe so there would be nothing distinguishing one from the other. \"Dad!\" April called, not really sure where she was right now, but she knew she was sitting down. \"I'm right here, baby.\" He called, her head immediately turning to the left where she heard the voice from. They were able to hear the door to the bunker open, confusing April greatly as the bag came off of her head and Kang was still down there along with a few other men. The doors closed, April's eyebrows furrowing as her father's mask came off too. \"What are you doing?\" She turned to look at Kang who had a playful smile tugging at his lips. \"Why get a chopper if you're not gonna use it?\" Kang's smile got just a little wider at her confused face. \"They're going to use it for our advantage.\" April turned back to the door, letting what he said sink in before realizing what he was talking about. Those people were going to die. He was going to kill them so he could get away with her and her father. \"No!\" She yelled, trying to get up, but Kang pulled her right back down. She wasn't going to try to fight with him on this one. It was a waste of energy. They were already gone and there was nothing she would be able to do about it. \"Mike,\" Trumbull called as Mike continued to walk around the White House. \"We have to get Kang, April and the President out in the open and take our best shot.\" Mike didn't want to put April in the middle of a battle between him and Kang, but this seemed like the only thing that would be able to take this asshole down. \"Copy that, sir.\" Mike began to hurry to where he would be able to see the lawn where the helicopter rested as they began their walk to it. Snipers rested in buildings next over, hoping to be able to distinguish who Kang was in the group. As they walked, though, they noticed there was covers on their feet and heads. Their entire bodies were covered, there was no way they could distinguish Ben from Kang. Once they all piled inside the chopper, the pilots took their place and began to lift it off the ground. It rose just above the White House when the entire helicopter exploded. Everyone around gasped and ducked as personnel tried to figure out what the hell happened. Mike heard the explosion, his gut falling to his feet. They were like lead as he picked them up to walk to the nearest window, gasping once he saw the sight. Once he saw the flames, he had to hold onto the wall near him to steady himself. April was supposed to be on there. And if there was anything left of her, it was just burning on the lawn of her home. \"Mike.\" Trumbull spoke, interrupting his thoughts. Mike sucked in a breath as tears collected in his eyes. \"What the hell happened?\" He knew they would be able to hear the tears in his voice, but right now, he didn't care. \"I'm sorry to report,\" Trumbull began, hating that he had to tell him this. That he had to tell anyone this. \"But the President and April were both on that helicopter.\" Mike had to look up, fighting the tears from streaming down his face. Everything they had worked for paid off today and just like that, it had all been taken from him. Her smile. Her compassion. He would never feel her touch again or be able to listen to her talk about absolutely nothing and everything at the same time. The only thing that would make this better would be killing Kang. \"And Kang?\" Trumbull could hear the darkness in his voice, wishing he would be able to give him some good news, but with a day like this, it was impossible. \"Kang killed himself and all the other hostages.\" Mike rubbed his face as he talked, but something resonated in him as he spoke. Mike began to shake his head, hope pushing through his whole body. \"Wait.\" He whispered. \"This doesn't make sense.\" Trumbull thought Mike would have been way more torn up about that, but there was obviously something else on his mind. \"What doesn't make sense?\" \"Kang would not go out like that, sir.\" Mike spoke without a pause. \"That's not who he is.\" Mike let his thoughts run for a moment. He would feel it if April really died. And he just didn't feel it. \"I think he's still in the bunker and he has April and the President and he's gonna try to slip away.\" Trumbull moved closer to the phone, getting even more serious. \"If Kang is still on the premises with the president, you cannot let him leave.\" Mike looked to his knife, thinking about April, thinking about all she had been through today. He then thought about how he was gonna shove that knife into Kang's brain and not stop until he was cold. \"He won't.\" Men pulled Ben and April up as Kang began to set up Cerberus to detonate. \"I read your bible, Mr. President.\" \"Oh fuck off.\" April complained with an eye roll. She was getting real tired of Kang and she just wished Mike would bust through the door already and kill him. She didn't care if it was a knife in the brain or not. \"It says,\" Kang spoke loudly, trying to let April know she wasn't getting to him. \"'The wages of sin is death.'\" \"You better keep that in mind.\" Ben growled. In that moment, Kang hit a button and the screen in the room blasted \"Cerberus\" big and bright. Ben and April looked to each other with panicked faces before looking back to Kang. \"What are you doing?\" April almost whispered, fear spreading through her whole body. \"Cerberus has been activated.\" The voice from the computer announced. \"We haven't launched any missiles yet.\" Ben was beyond distressed as he spoke. His country was falling apart at the seams because of Kang. \"I don't need to launch them.\" Kang had a sick smile on his face as he spoke. \"The explosive force within each hardened silo will detonate the missiles.\" April let out a terrified breath as Ben just looked to April, scared for her life. \"Tens of millions of Americans will perish. Your country will be a cold, dark, nuclear wasteland. Now too, America will know suffering and famine.\" Ben felt his hands ball into fists and his breathing turned angry. He was going to not only kill his children, but also his country. \"Sir?\" Ray Monroe called to Trumbull, catching almost everyone's attention. \"Cerberus has been activated.\" If Monroe didn't catch their attention before, their attention was caught now. \"What?\" Clegg spoke in fear, standing up from his seat. \"NORAD confirms.\" Monroe spoke quietly. He really didn't want to confirm it, but the bombs flashed across the screen in all of their silos. \"How did it come to this?\" Lynne demanded as she stood up from her seat in fear for what was to come. \"We lost Korea and now our nukes?\" \"They couldn't have broken the code.\" Trumbull whispered. \"That would be impossible.\" Monroe confirmed. \"They'd be on the bunker computer for days to break three codes.\" Lynne shook her head, her eyes shutting at everything that was going to happen in the next few hours. \"He only needed to break one code.\" Clegg's eyebrows furrowed in confusion, their plan not making sense to him. \"But we haven't launched any missiles.\" They all thought on that for a moment before Trumbull's eyes widened, realizing Kang's plan. \"They're gonna detonate them in their silos.\" Silence continued to pass over them, scared for what was really going to happen. \"How many?\" Monroe looked to the screen as all the locations light up. \"All of them.\" Trumbull felt like the country was slipping out of his hands. It literally was. \"He's just opened the gates of hell.\" The timer began counting down from five minutes, both of the Asher's beginning to internally freak out. \"Time to go, Mr. President.\" Kang announced, the man punching the crap out of him, leaving him falling in front of April. \"Dad!\" She screamed, distressed at seeing him writhing on the ground. The man then picked him up by his suit jacket as April was still on her knees, screaming. Another man, came behind her, picking her up by her jean jacket as she continued squirming in his grasp. \"Fuck you!\" She screamed as she was thrown next to her father. \"You think you're gonna get away with this?\" Ben asked, looking Kang dead in the eye. \"The world thinks we're all dead.\" Kang spoke, his composure not breaking for even a second. \"And with you as insurance…\" he trailed off as he blew a hole in the bunker, knocking out the lights before pushing them through it. They hurried into the hallway, Kang turning to the man holding onto April. \"Kill her.\" He commanded. \"NO!\" Ben screamed, trying to push out of the grip to get to his daughter. That chaos was the perfect time for Mike to come in through the elevators, April instantly seeing him and ducking out of the way so he could shoot the man who had a grip of her. Ben then turned around, elbowing the man who was holding onto him as Mike continued to shoot the men around them. April hurried to one of the stray guns, hearing one of the men running behind her, making sure to drop to the ground before shooting him to get the perfect angle. Ben pushed Kang into a wall, holding him there as Mike and April continued to fight off everyone that came for them. Ben and Kang struggled with a gun before Kang pushed it to his stomach and squeezed the trigger. April turned around from one of the men she had just killed to see her father gasping from pain. \"DAD!\" Ben staggered back as Mike ran for Kang and April hurried to her father as he slid down the wall to sit. April's nursing instincts kicking in, moving for his belt. \"Okay,\" she spoke, trying to keep both her and her father calm. \"I'm going to make a tourniquet to stop the blood.\" She spoke, inspecting the wound before doing so. \"It went straight through so the only thing we need to worry about right now is blood loss.\" She tightened the belt around his waist as he leaned for her ear, whispering. \"What?\" She asked, not able to hear him and leaning in to hear better. \"Cerberus.\" He spoke again. April looked over to the computer and then over to Mike who was currently punching Kang in the face. She knew in that moment; she was the country's only hope. She sprung up, ready to do the job she had to do. \"Mike!\" He turned his ear so he could listen as he continued to punch Kang. \"Ear piece!\" He pulled it out of his ear, tossing it, April catching it perfectly before hurrying back into the bunker. Kang tried to run for her, but Mike pushed him into a wall, knowing there was no way in hell that man was getting April. Not again. April immediately shoved the ear piece in her ear when she got to the computer, suddenly becoming overwhelmed with everything sitting in front of her. \"Lynne?\" She asked, not really knowing who to address. \"April?\" She asked, completely dumbfounded with her presence. She thought she was dead. Kang was getting the upper hand in the fight, kneeing him in the gut while pushing him back into the other wall and pulling out two knives. \"I'm here. So is the President and Mike,\" She turned around, watching him knocking one knife out of Kang's hand before April turned back to the screen. \"He's busy killing Kang.\" April looked around at everything not having an idea on where to start. \"How do I switch this fucking thing off?\" \"Hang on.\" Clegg told her, April bouncing at the fact that she had to wait. \"Find a control panel marked 'counterman'.\" April looked around for a moment before finding it, pulling the keyboard close to her. \"Got it!\" A man moved to Monroe with a brief case, Monroe pulling out the kit with the codes in it and breaking it as Clegg leaned even closer to the phone. \"Flip a blue-white switched marked, 'initiate recall'.\" April looked around, finding herself shaking as she pulled the switch. \"Okay, what's the abort command?!\" \"November,\" Monroe commanded, April repeating after him to make sure she was getting it right. \"India, Lima.\" \"Okay.\" April whispered, vigorously typing the letters. \"Five, Oscar, Hotel, Backslash.\" The fighting behind her really wasn't calming her nerves. Neither was thinking about how the whole country depended on her right now. \"Niner, Victor, Kilo, Hashtag,\" April looked around for a moment, not actually knowing where the hashtag was on a computer. \"Where the fuck is it?!\" She screamed out. \"Shift three!\" Lynne advised. \"Holy fuck.\" April whispered as she did as Lynne said. This was way too much pressure. Everything had gotten very quiet behind her so she turned around in fear. Kang was holding Mike's neck, squeezing tight, taking his breath. She could hear them continue to talk, but she couldn't take her eyes off of Mike. Fear spread through her whole body, and she knew, she had to do something. \"Oh, come on, Mike!\" She screamed. And with that, Mike snapped Kang's arm, causing April to gasp from how much pride rushed over her. Then Mike pushed him down, holding his head in between his knees. There was no way Kang was getting out of that, but April had to watch. She had to see Kang dead. Mike leaned for the knife lying on the floor, grabbing it and doing as he always said. He stuck a knife through Kang's brain. April couldn't fight this smile on her face as she turned back to the computer before saying, \"I'm sorry, what was that last part?\" \"Echo,\" Monroe was obviously slightly irritated with her losing her attention on the code, but he was going to let her get this in so she could save all of America. \"Sierra, Foxtrot.\" April took a moment, waiting for someone to say something else, but no one talked. \"Is that it?\" \"That's it.\" Lynne confirmed. April went ahead and pressed enter, everyone waiting for an intense moment before the computer confirmed it. \"Cerberus has been deactivated.\" April let out a relaxing breath, feeling all the stress suddenly melt away as she put a hand over her heart. She got a huge smile on her face at the sound of everyone at the Pentagon celebrating before taking the piece out of her ear and turning around to see Mike and her father staring at her. They both looked proud and for the first time all day, April felt completely at peace. 6:14am April had her arm around her father's waist, keeping him steady, meeting Mike's hand in the middle of his back. Ben's arms draped around their shoulders, finding it a lot harder to walk with a hole now in his stomach. Once they made it close to the entrance, they decided to stop, seeing the sun was rising. They knew the second they walked out there they were going to be bombarded with paparazzi. There would be no amount of privacy, there would be doctors crowding them, TV reporters and just people in general trying to find out what the hell is going on. It was going to be a tough go about, but honestly, they all had each other back. Truly. How hard could it really be with each of them by their side? \"Are you ready, Mr. President?\" Ben looked to each of them before nodding, the three making it out onto the front steps of the White House. April couldn't help but look at the bullets that stained the building, finding it hard to believe that her house was attacked and she survived. It brought a bit of a smile to her face. She survived. Mike survived. Her dad survived. It was like a miracle. Someone was watching over them for this and she believed with her whole heart it was Margret and April Asher. Mike met April's gaze, smiling at her, thinking the same thing she was thinking. Damn, they were lucky. Mike then turned to look at Ben, knowing that if he didn't have his job back after this, Ben definitely needed to get checked out for a concussion. \"I'm sorry about the house, sir.\" Ben turned to him with a bright smile. There was no way he was letting Mike go again. \"It's okay. I believe it's insured.\" The three of them laughed until a team came up to them, different men taking them each. April kept looking behind her to make sure Mike was still there. It was like she was afraid he was going to leave her. She was afraid to be without him again. Even if she was out of that hell hole, she still felt that level of alertness. Something she thought would probably never go away. Something that would definitely increase her hours of therapy. \"Dad!\" They all turned to see Conner hurrying to them out of an ambulance. \"April!\" \"Oh my god.\" April whispered as Ben got down on his knees to give Conner a hug and April joining them, Ben pulling her in before she was even fully positioned. She almost forgot how worried she was about Conner with everything going on in there. Mike watched as he was being led to an ambulance away from them. He had a smile on his face. He loved that he could still watch from afar, make sure she was safe, marvel in her beauty. They would never be together every second of every day. That was impossible. And through that, he just loved to watch her be. April suddenly propped her head out of the hug, looking around for Mike. They weren't able to have a chance to truly reconnect. She could see his back as they helped him out of his bullet proof vest. She had to go to him. She hoped her father would understand. She broke out of the hug completely, the both of them confused for a moment before realizing who she was looking at, instantly getting a smile on their faces. After all this time, those two deserved to be together. \"Mike!\" She called out. He turned around even if the paramedics began to inspect him. Her feet took off the ground before she even knew where they were going, and once she got close enough, she launched herself into his arms. He caught her, her arms holding tight around his neck as he buried his head into her shoulder. April let a few tears slip out, happy that she was out of this mess and that he had turned up okay despite all of the scenarios she had created in her head. When he pulled out of their embrace, all they saw was each other. Mike leaned forward, April doing the same as his hand came to her chin, stroking it with his fingers. April's lips parted, getting ready to take his tongue in her mouth when they were stopped. \"Oh my god!\" They both turned to their left, April immediately attacked in a hug by Megan. \"Wow,\" April commented, her eyes still on Mike as she felt the life being choked out of her. \"You must have been really worried about me.\" \"Hell yeah!\" She spoke, breaking away from her friend. \"I was worried out of my mind, April!\" She sounded like a disappointed mother April had to gasp to. \"Well, I'm sorry the White House got attacked and I was taken hostage!\" \"Girls,\" Mike spoke, looking around to see some cameras trying to snap photos. \"Maybe now isn't the best time.\" Megan threw her arms around Mike's neck too, hardly able to believe he was alive as well. \"Neither of you,\" Megan spoke as she pulled from Mike to look at the both of them. \"Scare me like that again.\" \"Yes, mom.\" April joked as Megan rolled her eyes. April's eyes then traveled back to Mike, knowing that Megan had interrupted something very important. \"Can we actually get a moment?\" She looked back and forth at the two before rolling her eyes slightly. \"Yeah, I was just the worried best friend, but you two go ahead, enjoy each other. Make out. Not like I just got you back too.\" April rolled her eyes as Megan began walking away before turning back to Mike. \"She'll be fine.\" \"She needs help.\" April corrected. Mike turned back to her with a hearty laugh as April leaned into him again, Mike taking the same position he had before their interruption. April gave him a wide smile as she looked into those grey-blue eyes. The same eyes she saw the second she walked into her new home. The same eyes she glanced into before she kissed. The same eyes she wanted to look into for the rest of her life. \"You found me.\" Mike moved his face forward so their noses were touching before whispering his response. \"I told you I would.\" Then, he leaned all the way forward, placing a slow magical kiss on her lips. As expected, cameras flashed around them, but they just didn't care. They could go on with their speculations and wild stories, but when it came down to it, they were just two people in love. And nothing would ever be able to change that. Not any story or fake source that was out there. Mike's hands moved to her back, lifting her in the air as a smile spread across April's face during the kiss. She cupped his face in both of her hands as her feet dangled in the air, never wanting to come down from this. Mike slowly let her to the ground, April arching her back as he leaned forward some more, his hand going to the back of her head to support it. \"Miss. Asher.\" That made them break apart instantly, both looking to the man who sheepishly stood near them in a uniform. \"We were going to start heading to the hospital if you wanted to ride with your father.\" \"Oh,\" April spoke, looking her father's ambulance and then Mike's. Did they really need two ambulances. \"Thank you.\" She nodded as her voice was completely out of breath. \"I'll be right there.\" He nodded awkwardly before walking off. April then turned on her heels to look back at Mike. She put a finger on his chest, hating that she had to leave him when she just got him back no matter how short of a time. \"Remember eight AM sharp.\" Mike gave her a smile, thinking the exact same thing she was thinking. \"I told you I'd be there.\" She gave him another big smile before giving him a peck on the lips and hurrying off to her father's ambulance. \"Hey, Showers!\" She immediately turned around as she was only a few feet away from the truck, Mike smiling at how cute she looked when responding to that name. \"I love you.\" She smiled at him before walking backwards to the ambulance, not wanting to take her eyes off of Mike. \"I looooove you.\" She threw her head back a tad as she recited the O's before climbing into the ambulance as Mike stayed there for a moment laughing before getting into his own ambulance and hurrying off the hospital. Igor Blonsky: Oh, I know! Ben would be rolling his eyes from a mile away at their conversation. Haha, they wanted to get that date out as soon as possible after everything they had been through so that's why a breakfast date. And yes, I love the knife through the brain as well. CoolCat0720: Okay, true. I would definitely be trying to make a date with Mike Banning whether i was being held captive or not. Mrs. HappyAnarchy: Yay! I'm glad you liked it! MisfitCarter: You're so very welcome! I'm glad you loved April going just a tad crazy. Thank you so much for your constant reviews! I'm coming at you guys from a new laptop! I'm so excited, my last one was so bad, but this one is perfect. I've named her Deena. Okay, we have one more chapter left which makes me kind of sad. I hope you guys liked the ending of the movie and I hope you enjoy the last chapter of the story next! Thank you guys so much for continuing to read and review throughout this whole story. Means everything to me! See ya next time![Chapter 23] 7:59am Washington DC was like a ghost town. Everyone was in their houses and not a lot of businesses were open. April just hoped her favorite café would be open. When she walked to the door, she noticed most of the lights were off and the \"closed\" sign was up. She sighed, pulling out her cell phone, about to call Mike for a change of plans when the door opened up. April was still way on edge from everything that happened, jumping and stepping back before anyone could hurt her. When she looked up, though, she noticed it was Mike. \"What the hell?\" April gasped, pushing him just a little bit as he laughed. A smile came on April's face at his laugh. She loved hearing it especially after all they just went through. \"You scared the hell out of me!\" \"Sorry.\" He apologized with a quick shrug. April looked into the building, noticing no one was in there. \"This place is closed today. What are you doing?\" \"Well,\" Mike spoke, pulling the keys out of his front pocket. \"I worked my magic.\" April's eyes grew wide, hardly able to believe that Mike actually had the keys to the place. \"What?\" April asked as she walked in, trying to hide her shock while Mike closed the door after her. \"Did you kill someone for it?\" He gave her an irritated stare that she had to laugh to. April didn't understand how they were so calm after everything they went through. It made no sense to her, but she wasn't going to argue with it. She loved the relaxation she felt after the night of stress she just experienced. \"I called the owner, asked him if he was going to be open and when he said he wasn't, I asked for the keys.\" April furrowed her eyebrows together as she sat down at a booth where Mike had already set a pot of coffee down, pouring herself a mug. \"What did you say to him to get him to give you the keys?\" Mike got a smile on his face, not being able to wait to tell her what he said. \"President's orders.\" April let out a loud laugh as she shook her head at him. \"You are so going to hell.\" Mike shrugged, knowing that was fair. \"Could be.\" April rolled her eyes at him as he moved to sit down next to her, April not being able to fight her smile once he put his arm around her. \"This is a breakfast date,\" April commented, making it obvious she was looking around for the food. \"And I'm starving.\" Mike looked over to the back, picking up his head slightly so his voice would be able to carry that far. \"Hey, Mon, how much longer on those pancakes?\" April's eyes widened once she heard that, looking over to Monica coming out the back of the kitchen, her black hair tied up in a high ponytail and flour on her apron. \"Give it like five minutes.\" \"Perfect.\" She disappeared back into the kitchen, April turning to Mike with an amused face while shaking her head. \"You, Mike Banning, never cease to amaze me.\" She leaned even further into his embrace, taking a deep relaxing breath before taking another sip of coffee. Mike placed a kiss to her temple, April just had to close her eyes to. Mike made her feel so safe and relaxed. She would never be able to get this anywhere else. \"How's your dad?\" She looked up at Mike, taking in all of his beauty as he did the same. \"Fine. They want to keep him for the day, but they're probably going to release him at night. He just needed a few stitches.\" \"Good.\" His voice was so gruff from how tired and sleepy he was. April just snuggled further into him, hoping her presence alone would be able to make him stay awake. \"I was worried.\" He placed his chin on top of her head when she looked away from him, knowing they both had to stay awake. At least for breakfast. \"Here we are.\" They both jumped at Monica's voice, straightening up, but Mike not taking his arm off of April's shoulders. \"Blueberry pancakes for April and strawberry for Mike with a side of bacon and eggs for both.\" April smiled at how gourmet Monica made it all look. She never did anything half assed. No matter if the country fell apart today. \"Thank you, Mon.\" She spoke as she shook her head. \"You didn't have to.\" \"Oh, yes I did.\" She corrected. \"You two get back together after all the crap you both made me go through, I deserve making your first official date food.\" April rolled her eyes at the woman as Mike shook his head. \"You can leave now if you want. Spend the day with your family.\" \"I am.\" She spoke as she took off her gloves. \"You two gonna be fine by yourselves?\" Mike and April both glanced to each other with a playful smile on both of their faces as April already had a piece of bacon in her mouth. Monica rolled her eyes, knowing that was a dumb question. They had both just survived a night in the White House with terrorists at every turn. They were more than fine by themselves. \"Never mind. You two enjoy your date .\" \"Bye.\" They both spoke in unison as Monica walked out the front door, leaving just the two in the café. \"You're welcome.\" Mike spoke with a nod as April began to scoff which turned into a laugh. \"And what am I welcome for?\" \"I set all this up.\" Mike spoke, looking around at everything. April began to laugh again. \"You got the keys to a café.\" \"And I called the best chef I know.\" He spoke, talking through a mouthful of eggs. \"I could have done the same thing.\" She spoke unimpressed as Mike just gave her a fake irritated stare. He couldn't help but smile at her laugh, though. That was the one thing breaking him from keeping a stone cold face. He shook his head at her, giving her a wider smile. \"I love you, you know that?\" April leaned into him again, taking a big gulp of coffee before speaking again. \"Know that I love you?\" \"No way.\" Mike spoke sarcastically while shaking his head. \"I didn't know this was a two-way street.\" \"You're such an ass.\" April whispered while taking a huge bite of her pancakes. \"Yeah, I know.\" April turned to look at him, furrowing her brows, knowing he was going somewhere else with this. He didn't just openly admit to being an ass like that. \"Too bad you're stuck with me.\" April shrugged. \"It's got benefits.\" \"Like what?\" Mike asked through a mouthful of pancake. April looked up, pretending to think, but in all honesty, she could go on all day about why Mike was her favorite person in the whole world. \"You have an amazing body.\" He nodded like it was obvious. \"Your face isn't too bad on the eyes.\" She moved to his hair, ruffling it a little bit. \"I actually like it this length.\" \"Better than Troy's shaggy hair, huh?\" \"Oh,\" April laughed out. \"A million times better.\" April continued to look at him, reasons on why she loved him just dying to pour out of her mouth. \"You're a complete badass. Your heart is tainted, but it's still good. You would do anything for me.\" Mike looked down at her, knowing what she said was true. His heart was tainted, but she made him forget it wasn't. \"And you have the biggest penis I have ever seen.\" \"You're damn right I do.\" April laughed into his shoulder, the two snuggling into each other again, enjoying the rest of their date. When they got to Mike's apartment, their first thought wasn't to have sex until tomorrow, it was their aching bodies and how much they needed rest. Mike started up the shower, the two getting in, helping each other lather their hair and bodies, just enjoying the relaxing heat of the shower and each other's company. When they got out, April stole one of Mike's T-shirts, jumping into bed the second it was on, Mike doing the same as her. April didn't realize she was going to feel so at home here. It was like the apartment was calling for her. Like this was her home too, she just didn't realize it yet. The two took their time just lying there, staring into each other's eyes as they grew heavy. \"What about tomorrow?\" April asked. \"It's going to be so crazy tomorrow. We're going to have renovate the entire White House and we have to go to the Treasury and let them know that you're quitting.\" April then shook her head, thinking about everything she had witnessed in these last few hours. \"How could I ever go back in there?\" \"Hey,\" Mike whispered, his voice even more gruff than it was in the café, feeling himself almost off to sleep. \"Don't worry about all of that stuff right now. You need rest.\" April shook her head as she looked at him. \"The second I walk in there, I'm going to think about everything I did, the people I killed, and I don't think I can handle that.\" Mike moved his hand forward, grabbing hers, looking dead into her eyes. \"You'll have me. You'll always have me.\" Mike let out a sigh of tiredness as his eyes shut. \"And I'll be there with you every step of the way.\" April's eyes closed too, finding it impossible to stay awake anymore as she closed the space between the two. \"You promise?\" Mike wrapped his arm around her waist as their chests pressed together, her head just under his. \"I promise.\" Then in a quick moment, the two fell asleep like that. Ben had been given a hotel suite along with Conner, April deciding to stay with Mike as they worked on renovating the White House. They had no idea how long they were going to be there, but they were all happy for a break. Currently, both Mike and April had been called into Ben's makeshift office in one of the rooms of the suite. They both had no idea what it was for and they were both trying to look everywhere, but in Ben's eyes. \"Will you two relax?\" Ben complained at the look of them. \"April, you look like you're gonna pop a blood vessel.\" \"I might.\" She spoke with a shrug, knowing that was a plausible reaction of this situation. \"April,\" Ben spoke while rubbing the bridge of his nose, finding her unnecessary fear exhausting. \"What am I gonna do, ground you?\" April thought about it for a moment before shrugging. There really wasn't much Ben could do to her. Anything drastic was far from Ben's style of parenting. \"I just wanted to talk to you two about what's going to be happening in the next few days.\" Both Mike and April shared an uneasy glance before looking back to Ben. \"What's going to be happening in the next few days?\" Mike asked. \"Well,\" Ben spoke, standing up and leaning on the desk that stood in front of them. \"Mike, you're coming back to work for me.\" April gave him a bit of a smile before looking back to her father. \"And April,\" She was confused at the mention of her. \"When you graduate college, look out for Lynne. She's already talking about making you Secret Service. Very enthusiastically I might add.\" April nodded, suddenly seeing herself in that position. She never did before. She just couldn't see herself in that job field. But it was hard to see yourself out of it once you've done it. \"And officials have decided that you two need to be awarded something for your work in the White House.\" April and Mike looked to each other again in confusion, not expecting that at all. \"What kind of award?\" Mike finally asked. Ben got a smile on his face as he looked back and forth at the two. If anyone deserved this award, it was them. \"Oh my gosh.\" April complained while shaking her hands. \"I'm nervous. Are you nervous?\" Mike looked her up and down as she bounced. \"Apparently not as nervous as you.\" \"This is a huge deal, how are you not freaking out?!\" Mike shrugged, knowing she was right. He should have been insanely nervous. He should be bouncing around like April or maybe be even worse. For some odd reason, he wasn't. With April, he just wasn't. \"I don't know.\" He spoke honestly while turning to look at her. \"I have you I guess.\" April gave him a tight smile as the blood rushed to her cheeks. She was just happy that everything was just falling into place so simply. April leaned in as Mike stepped closer to her, the two about to share a kiss when the stage manager popped her head in. \"Two minutes, guys.\" Mike and April both took a sigh, not realizing that the two of them finally getting together was going to lead to so many interrupted kisses. \"Thank you, Jan.\" April spoke quickly leaving her to hurry back to the stage. April turned to look at Mike, taking a deep sigh before leaning forward and whispering, \"Do you think two minutes is long enough for us to steal a kiss?\" \"It better be.\" Mike whispered before leaning in and kissing her quick before anyone else could interrupt. When they pulled away, Mike had his hands around her waist as April involuntarily put hers around his neck. That's when Mike decided to ask something that had been spinning through his mind for a while. \"Hey, what about when the White House is done with its renovations, you get all your stuff and you move in with me permanently?\" April laughed a little, shaking her head at that. \"Or I finish getting all of my stuff out and move in with you now?\" Mike pushed his face to hers with a deep smile settling in as April shut her eyes, thinking about how amazing it was that after all this time, they could do this. They could be out in the open in the middle of the day. They could go on real dates. Not just private rooms or hanging out at his house. Finally, they didn't have to hide and that was the best thing April Asher could ask for. \"I like your idea better.\" He spoke with a nod before leaning in to give her a kiss. In the middle of the kiss, the stage manager came out, practically pulling them apart. \"Come on you two, it's time.\" April shrugged at Mike before walking up the steps of the stage, waiting for her father to say both their names, April reaching out her hand for Mike to grab as he stood behind her. She looked back at him, giving him a cheesy smile he just had to smile back at. He really was lucky to have her. \"So,\" Ben spoke, causing Mike and April to turn back to the stage. \"It is my duty and my honor to present April Asher and Mike Banning.\" Applause started as the two walked up the steps and onto the stage. The applause died down, both April and Mike giving each other a nervous look. Okay, now Mike felt it. He was now extremely nervous. Ben gave a quick smile to the two before looking back to the audience. \"These two are being honored today for their extraordinary sacrifice, not just to keep me safe, but all of America.\" Ben looked down to his note cards quickly, but most of the reason for him looking down was because he was thinking about it all again. \"On July 5th, 2013, the unthinkable happened. Our house was taken. A few other officials and myself were taken hostage and these two went above and beyond the call of duty to take back our house.\" April looked down at that. She really felt like she didn't deserve this. If anyone did, it was Mike. She didn't do much. \"Mike single handedly took on every terrorist that stepped foot in that house where he saved both Conner and April Asher along with Secretary of Defense Ruth McMillan and myself.\" Ben then turned to April, noticing her standing the way she was, and in that moment he knew what she was feeling. \"And the next awardee is one very special to me.\" April looked up at him, noticing he wasn't even addressing the audience. He gave her one wink before turning back to the crowd, April getting a large smile on her face. \"Without her, none of us would be standing here today.\" He got a serious look on his face, thinking about what would have happened if April wasn't able to do what she did when she did it. \"The terrorists had gained access to our nuclear codes and they were going to blow them in their silos, leaving our country in ruins.\" Ben turned back to look at his daughter, finding himself extremely proud. \"April was able to break the code, saving every single one of us. And I can tell you all now, I have never been more proud to be her father.\" April bit her lip, trying to keep herself from getting emotional as Mike stared at her in the same wonderment her father did. Ben turned back to the audience with a small smile on his face. \"These two are the reasons this award was created. For people that are willing to exhibit extraordinary bravery, selflessness and courage in the name of our country. So, this is our chance to pay our gratitude to these two heroes.\" Ben turned to look at the man holding the medals next to him before nodding. \"General Clegg.\" Ben grabbed one medal and went to put it on Mike first while General Clegg announced. \"The President of the United States of America, authorized by Act of Congress, March 3, 1863, has awarded in the name of Congress the Medal of Honor to Michael Banning and April Asher.\" The second the medal was clipped onto Mike's suit jacket, he felt this kind of heavy responsibility while thinking of all the other secret service agents who truly deserved this. Ben then moved to the second medal, moving towards April. \"Michael Banning and April Asher distinguished themselves by acts of gallantry and intrepidity at the risks of their lives above and beyond the call of duty.\" As her father walked toward her, she caught sight of Conner watching her in awe. And for a split second where Ben had covered her face from the cameras, she stuck her tongue out at him while crossing her eyes, making Conner laugh. Ben smiled at her while General Clegg continued on their story of bravery and Ben pinned the medal onto April's blazer. April felt the heaviness of the medal just as Mike did, her mind wandering back to the fact that she didn't really deserve this. That's when Ben leaned into her ear, whispering. \"You saved all of America back there and I mean it when I say I have never been more proud of you.\" April gave him a bright smile, feeling herself becoming emotional again. \"Your mother would have been so proud of you.\" That time, April had to take a deep breath as her first tear fell, Mike simply putting a hand on her back as her father turned away, Mike rubbing her back in small circles, calming her almost instantly. \"Michael Banning,\" General Clegg continued, not having that nasty tone he did in the Pentagon, but more of a grateful one. \"Is the first Secret Service agent to receive the Medal of Honor while April Asher is the second and youngest female to do so.\" They both looked to each other, giving each other an impressed stare. \"Extraordinary heroism and selflessness above and beyond the call of duty are in keeping with the highest traditions of military service and reflect great credit upon themselves and the United States.\" They were then both escorted off the stage by General Clegg and to the side with Lynne and Conner, knowing Ben still had to give his speech about the state their country was in after the attack. \"In regard to the attack on the White House,\" he took a pause, looking around at all the people in there and noticing some of his best Secret Service agents were gone. \"We lost good friends. Family. All good people.\" Mike and April turned to look at each other, Mike making sure to hold April's hand as they thought about Roma, O'Neil and even Forbes. \"Heroes, every one of them. Our hearts and prayers go out to their families and they will be remembered nor will we forget those who serve out of the spotlight.\" April looked into the audience to see Megan watching with captivation, wishing Megan could have been up there for all the work she had done. \"To whom we owe our highest gratitude.\" April then turned back to look at her brother, placing her arm around him, sandwiched in-between two of her favorite boys. \"Our foe did not come only to destroy our things or our people.\" Ben turned to look over at the three, intently watching his speech, getting a little smile tugging at the corner of his lips. \"They came to desecrate our way of life, to foul our beliefs, trample our freedom, and in this, not only did they fail,\" \"They got their asses handed to them.\" April whispered in Mike's ear which he had to break his stone cold stare to turn and smile at her. \"They granted us the greatest gift.\" April turned back to her father, becoming serious again. She would hide it, but what had happened to her in the White House really affected her and she was finding one of the ways to get around it was joking about it. In all honesty though, she had never been filled with more pride for her country in her life. \"A chance at our rebirth. We will rise renewed, stronger and united.\" \"This is our time, our chance to get back to the best of who we are.\" April turned to look at Mike, him looking to her out of the corner of his eye with a smile before looking back to Ben. It really was their time. \"To lead by example with the dignity, integrity and honor that built this country and which we'll build it once again.\" He gave the crowd a quick once over before uttering the last part of his speech which he felt obliged to say in this time of crisis. \"May God bless you, and may God bless the United States of America.\" Ben began to step down from the stage, going to the door which Mike opened for him. Ben then stopped in front of Mike, looking to his daughter first and then back to Mike. And in that moment, he had no idea why he thought she was unsafe with Mike to begin with. It was the exact opposite. He offered Mike a small smile before putting his hand out and shaking it. April and Mike both smiled, knowing what this was. This was the handshake a father gives to his daughter's boyfriend as a sign of respect. Acceptance. Then Ben turned around to Conner, put his hand on his shoulders and guided him through the door. April stopped at the door to look at Mike with a big smile on her face before leaning in to whisper, \"Don't sleep with the President's daughter on the first day.\" \"No promises.\" He whispered out the corner of his mouth. April squeezed his arm before following her father and brother, Mike sticking back for a little bit, just remembering how all of this felt. He was back. Back with April. Back in the White House. Back to the old Mike. And it felt damn good to be back. fearthereaper15: I am! Not sure when it's going to be up, though.
