It wasn't that he wanted to take back the words that he had said, because he had meant every one of them, but using his dead brother to tear her down and shut her up hadn't been the best decision. In that moment he hadn't known what to do – there had been a time when they were like siblings, a time when he would've tried to find some sort of way to comfort her as his little sister. But Chase had been the glue that had held them together, and when he had died, so had the bond between Lucas and Jasmine. So Lucas had gotten in his car and sped away from her, trying to leave the guilt behind as well. He began to drive, just randomly going around town, trying to burn some of his emotions into speed, rubber, and asphalt. But as Chase and Michael and his latest confrontation with Jasmine piled up inside, it wasn't enough right then. He turned on the radio, trying to distract himself, tuning into a country station that Chase had always chosen. The lyrics that floated out to him only worsened the pain. Where were you when the world stopped turning on that September day? The song, Lucas knew, was meant to be about 9/11, but the way that it came off to Lucas was concerning Chase. His brother had committed suicide in September; so where had Lucas been then, when his brother had so desperately needed him? Obviously, he hadn't been where he was needed; helping Chase through whatever it was that had made him end his own life. That song was a small breaking point for Lucas. He needed something else, something more to get rid of everything that was going on inside. He swung into the parking lot of his favorite sports supply store and went inside. Sometimes walking around and just dreaming was calming. He stopped in front of a display of baseball bats and picked one up. Getting a feel for it, an idea sprouted in his mind and a salesclerk that he knew came over to talk to him. He halfway paid attention as he put the bat back and chose a wooden one. He interrupted whatever the man was saying with, \"I'll take this one.\" He paused for a second, looking at the bats identical to the one that he held. \"Actually, I'm going to need to take all of those.\" The clerk raised his eyebrows and looked after Lucas as he headed to the checkout counter. \"Okay.\" After leaving the store, Lucas drove out into a field in the middle of nowhere, focusing more and more on thoughts of Chase and their time together. He parked and, taking the bag of baseball bats out of the trunk of his car, he strode towards a large tree in the middle of the field. He dumped the bats onto the ground at the base of the tree, donned gloves and dark sunglasses, and picked a bat up, resolve building. He steadied himself and took a couple of small swings before putting all of his strength behind his next swing. The bat hit the tree, splintering instantly as bark sprayed. You weren't there for him! The thought stuck in his brain, screaming at him, breaking him as he broke bat after bat. Where were you when he needed you? You! Weren't! There! For! Him! One by one, he destroyed the bats, until every one of them, like him, were broken. This is what I originally sat down to right when I wrote \"After the Twin Towers Fell.\" FYI, the song - which inspired this one-shot - is Allen Jackson's \"Where Were You (When the World Stopped Turning).\" Please review, thanks so much! Do I need to continue trying the puppy-dog eyes on people? Will it work this time?:) ","Summary":" Lucas wasn't used to this sort of guilt, the kind that he had essentially brought on himself when h"},{"Movie":"New Hope","Title":"Preacher's Kid","Author":"Kathryn Claire O'Connor","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9118458","Passage":"[Chapter 1] Michael Evans scowled at his reflection in the mirror hanging on his and Jasmine's bedroom wall. He shoved his new, unwillingly acquired, and all too necessary glasses higher onto the bridge of his nose and turned away from the mirror. A very pregnant Jasmine, already dressed for church, came into the room and handed Mike the necklace that she wanted to wear. She turned her back to him, holding her hair up off of her neck, and asked, \"Are you still sulking over the glasses?\" \"I'm not sulking.\" Mike answered, fiddling with the necklace's clasp. \"Faith sulks; I don't sulk.\" \"Would pining for contacts be a more accurate way to put it, then?\" Jasmine asked with a smile. \"If you weren't so pregnant right now, I'd hurt you.\" His wife turned to face him once he finally conquered the clasp on her necklace. She straightened his tie, saying, \"No, you wouldn't.\" He sighed because she was right and groused, \"But I still wish that the contacts had worked out; now I look like a nerd.\" \"You do not look like a nerd… much. And besides, I like your glasses; I think that they look very nice on you. So quit moaning over the fact that contacts irritate your eyes and stop sulking like your teenager sister.\" \"I do not sulk!\" Mike insisted. Jasmine just rolled her eyes and grabbed her purse as the young couple headed out the door on their way to church. Mike was paying a perfectly good amount of attention to the message of his pastor father – an uplifting sermon about the, for lack of a better word, perks of living in Heaven – when Alex Evans did one of the most embarrassing things that a preacher can do, at least in his child's opinion. He called his son out by name. \"And just think, Mike, when you get away from this earth and into Heaven, you can throw away those new glasses that you love so much!\" Out of the corner of his eye, Mike caught his wife grinning from her place at his side. He sighed internally, smiling ruefully as a few members of the congregation turned to glance at him. Oh, the \"perks\" of being a preacher's kid, and this was only one of them. Faith listened intently as her father continued preaching. \"You know, if you can think of the greatest moment in your life here on earth and then just imagine how small a thing that's going to seem like when you and I can compare it to seeing the King of Kings face to face. I still remember the day; it's been over fifteen years ago now, that Faith was born. And as I looked down on my little baby girl, all wrinkled, red, screaming seven pounds of her –\" At this unnecessary outpouring of information from her father, Faith felt her eyes widen with horror as people turned to look at her as they had done to Mike only a minute ago. \"But, folks,\" Alex continued on without noticing a thing about her expression. \"While seeing my new baby was an absolutely amazing thing, it will be like nothing when I see my Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ.\" Faith met her brother's sympathetic gaze from across the church aisle. At least someone here understood this particular \"perk\" – only one of the many – of being a preacher's kid. I confess, this is a little bit of a personal rant being let out here, since I am - I admit it - a preacher's kid. I hope that you liked the story; if so please review! Thanks! Puppy-dog eyes still aren't working unfortunately, so I'm just going to leave it at that.

Lucas grinned at his brother and put a finger to his lips as he snuck up behind Jasmine. Chase gave him a warning look, but Lucas only ignored him and shoved Jasmine under the water. She came up sputtering and screaming at Lucas, who was floating on his back in the water, laughing loudly. She wiped hair and water out of her eyes, so that he could get the full effect of her glare. Chase watched the two of them, shaking his head. Lucas wouldn't care and Jasmine would try to get revenge and Lucas still wouldn't care, which meant that this back and forth could and would probably go on all afternoon. So Chase decided to take matters into his own hands. He tackled his brother and plunged him underneath the water before jumping back out of Lucas' way. Now Chase and Jasmine were laughing when Lucas reemerged. The boys' mother, Sally Green, came out onto the patio carrying a tray of lemonade and grinning at their antics. The three teenagers surged out of the pool and each grabbed a glass. Chase set his lemonade on the patio table and held his dripping-wet arms out to his mother. \"How about a hug?\" Sally held up her hands. \"No, thanks.\" Lucas grinned and reached over, running his wet hand over his mom's arm. She yelped and the boys laughed. \"I swear!\" Jasmine exclaimed. \"What is wrong with you today, Lucas Green?\" \"Chase laughed too.\" Lucas pointed out. \"Did he laugh when you dunked me?\" \"I told him not to.\" Chase answered for Lucas, wrapping his arms around Jasmine's shoulders. \"You did not!\" Lucas objected. \"I did not say 'Lucas, don't dunk my girlfriend,' but you knew what my look meant.\" \"You sound like Mom.\" Lucas muttered with a half-hidden grin, at which point Sally laughed and kissed Chase on the cheek before retreating into the house. \"See,\" Jasmine looked patiently at Lucas. \"That is what a good boyfriend does. You could learn from him.\" \"And then he might get a date.\" Chase added good-naturedly. Lucas narrowed his eyes and shoved Jasmine, and thereby Chase, back into the pool. The laughter of the three teens once again floated into the air. That afternoon, neither Lucas nor Jasmine could have guessed where they would be at the beginning of the impending school year. But as they sat side by side at Chase's funeral, they couldn't help but wonder if, when he was going under the water of the pool – had he been going under emotionally as well, even then? This is an idea that I've had in my head for awhile and I decided to share it with you guys. PLEASE review one of the New Hope stories. Please? Would it help if I tried puppy-dog eyes? I just really want some feedback on these stories.

Author POV Sudah seminggu Sa Rin bersekolah disini,semenjak kejadian itu mereka menjadi akrab,mereka bertiga selalu pergi ke kantin bersama. Mungkin hampir semua yeoja yeoja di sekolahan memandang iri kepada Sa Rin (bebek buruk rupa gelar mereka untuk Sa Rin) karena bisa dekat dengan namja yang tampan tampan dan cukup berperestasi di sekolahan. Namun, luhan dan Tao selalu bilang pada Sa Rin untuk tidak memperdulikan kata orang lain atau jangan pernah takut dengan tatapan tajam dari yeoja yeoja di sekolah ini karena kami akan selalu menjaga mu.

September eleventh was a bad day for Lucas. Because that was the day that the twin towers fell. Not the ones in New York City that had gone down in 2001, but New Hope's own twin towers. When Chase had died that day, a large part of Lucas had died with him. He wanted to believe that there was a reason that Chase had chosen such a monumental date to take his own life, but if there was one, he just couldn't see it. And on the day that Chase had been gone a year and a half, he said as much to Michael Evans, trusting his tentatively entitled as such friend for some good advice, something that the preacher's kid had been forthcoming with in the past. Whether or not Lucas wanted it. Mike rubbed his hands together, looking thoughtfully out of the window in his room. The boy's were seated on opposite ends of Mike's bed, the homework around them long abandoned as Mike had turned his full attention to the confession that Lucas had just wrapped up. Lucas laughed dryly at himself. \"I came here for Trig help, and now I'm asking you to play psychologist. You know what? You can just forget that I said anything.\" Mike smiled just as dryly. \"People tend to trust PKs to be good listeners at an early age. I'm used to it.\" \"Sorry, I shouldn't unload all of my junk onto you.\" Mike shook his head again. \"Hey, it's cool. Like I said, you get used to it, being a PK and all.\" \"PK?\" \"Preacher's kid.\" Lucas smirked and the boys turned back to their homework. Later, as Lucas shoved his homework back into his backpack and prepared to leave, Mike said hesitantly, \"You know, 9/11 in 2001 was an awful day in America's history. Essentially, America lost her innocence that day. But a lot of good things came out of it as well. If I understand correctly, it became a day of prayer. It was a day when Americans came together. Because of the attack\" Mike shrugged before adding, \"And in part because the towers fell, they found faith again, and found strength in themselves and each other. Maybe… could it be, that Chase meant to send you a message like that?\" \"Everything has to come back to faith with you, doesn't it?\" Lucas asked with another smirk as he swung his backpack over his shoulder. Mike shrugged. \"It was just a thought. You did ask for my opinion, so I gave it, that's all. And it's not just about faith. Hundreds of people died on 9/11. Thousands of people – a whole nation, really – was left bereaved. But we – they – scraped themselves up off of the ground, gathered their strength and courage, and continued living. They lost, they learned… and then they… they moved on. Maybe Chase just wanted you to know that it was okay to move on.\" Lucas rolled his eyes. \"Whatever. You didn't even know Chase, and that's just way too sappy.\" So saying, Lucas stalked out of the house, regretting even opening his mouth. But something told him that there might just be a thread of truth in Mike's thought process. And while playing basketball alone in the Greens' driveway two days later, that was a thought that wouldn't let him go. What if Chase had wanted him to move on? Certainly he had expected him too by now. It had been a hard eighteen months now without his brother and best friend, but he had his whole life ahead of him, all without Chase. So maybe Mike was right. Maybe it was time to scrape himself up off of the ground, gather his strength and courage, and move on. Actually, no two ways about it, it was time to move on, to start living again. Because whether or not Chase had meant to send him some sort of a message, Lucas decided that he was going to take it the way Mike had suggested he take it. And maybe he would even start this turning over of a new leaf with something to the order of a much-needed apology to Michael Evans. He threw the ball up into the hoop, undistracted now that his decision had been made. Yep, there it was. Finally he had made a perfect shot. Okay, honestly, I'm not sure where this one came from.

At the beginning of one of those rockier occasions, Jasmine had asked Michael to teach her something else. Referring to the names of the stars, she asked, \"Can you teach them to me?\" But it was the third time that she had made the request that really made the difference – all the difference, actually – in her life. Referring to asking the Lord for His forgiveness, she asked Michael with a small smile, \"Will you teach me to do that, too?\" Michael grinned and Jasmine knew that she had just made his day. \"Yeah. Yeah.\" He laughed a little. \"Hey, it's a lot easier than astronomy lessons.\" Jasmine grinned back at him. They leaned towards each other and kissed quickly before she said, \"Thank you.\" \"For what?\" She shook her head a little. \"For being you.\" Mike lowered his head before lifting their hands, clasped in one another's. And in the next few minutes, Jasmine turned her life over to the Lord. And having Michael with her in that moment also went a huge way towards solidifying her relationship with him. Jasmine raised her head after her prayer, wiping a tear from her eye, and was surprised to see that Michael's eyes were swimming as well. She smiled. \"I am forgiven, Michael. I am!\" Michael burst out laughing, whether from happiness or her expression Jasmine didn't know or care. \"Thank you, Lord!\" he called out. \"Michael,\" she asked, as the thought occurred to her. \"Can you teach me that Bible verse that you quoted on the school roof?

That Kelly was the person that he was supposed to spend the rest of his life with. What if he was letting fear and \"that old serpent, the devil\" lead him aside from that? Those were the \"what ifs\" that were truly important, the ones that he really needed to consider long before all of the others. What was God's will in the matter?

Hey, Lucas, wait up.\" Lucas Green turned from putting his crutches in his Mustang when Michael Evans called out to him. \"Hey,\" Mike continued, \"my dad's having a fellowship for the team at the church later on.\" Mike shrugged. \"Just wanted to invite you.\" Lucas raised his eyebrows. Mike added, \"Oh, you know, the coach is going and everything, so…\" \"Church fellowship?\" Lucas repeated. Mike started rambling, trying to explain \"Yeah, but it's a laid back get together, it's not like anything-\" \"You can,\" Lucas interrupted his ramblings, smiling a little, \"You can stop apologizing. It's alright.\" He looked at the ground and shifted on his crutches before looking back up at Mike and answering, \"Look, I'll go, I just, I don't know, I don't want you to think that I'll be some kind of regular.\" \"Okay,\" Mike shrugged, \"deal.\" \"Alright.\" \"Yeah.\" \"Besides,\" Lucas added, \"God doesn't want anything to do with me.\" \"Do you really believe that?\" Mike asked, eyes losing the happiness of a second ago. Lucas looked away and grinned dryly, licking his lips before looking sideways at Mike. \"Man, you just don't know what all I've done.\" He shook his head. \"Nah, I just… No. God is not for me.\" He went to get in his car but stopped when Mike said, \"I'll tell you what; you and I will go to lunch – together – and, if I can't convince you otherwise, then lunch is on me.\" Lucas laughed, surprised at this proposition. \"A betting man, huh?\" Mike nodded, obviously pleased with himself as Lucas thought it over. \"I like that.\" Lucas decided. \"Yeah, you got a deal.\" After all, who wouldn't turn down a free meal? The next day, a Saturday, Lucas met Mike at a nearby burger franchise before the \"church fellowship\" later in the afternoon. They ordered their lunches separately, deciding that Mike could just give Lucas the amount if – no, when – he lost the bet. Then they settled into a table in a corner of the building. Lucas rolled his eyes and stared awkwardly out the window as Mike bowed his head and offered up a silent prayer for his meal. \"Praying over a burger and fries?\" Lucas asked with raised eyebrows once Mike had opened his eyes and lifted his head. \"Really?\" Mike nodded with a tolerant smile. \"Really. Some people have less or nothing to eat, so yeah.\" Lucas smirked. \"Any less than this stuff is nothing. We're at the cheapest place in town.\" \"You ordered the most expensive things on the menu.\" Mike pointed out. \"Why not?\" Lucas' smirk widened. \"After all, you offered to pay for it.\" \"Not if I can convince you that God is for you.\" Mike reminded needlessly, returning the smirk in kind. \"Alright,\" Lucas challenged, gesturing at the compact Bible that Mike had brought with him and lay in the table. \"Convince me.\" Mike ended up paying for both of their lunches because there was no way that Lucas was going to admit that what the other teenager had said had made an impact on him. But that didn't change the fact that it had. Standing by their cars parked side by side in the parking lot, Mike said, \"Hey, Lucas, I want you to have this.\" He held up the Bible. \"I have another copy at home. You don't have to take it if you don't want to, and it would be fine with me either way. But if you do want it, it's yours for the asking, now or whenever.\" Mike paused before adding, \"Kind of like salvation. Only, we don't really know if we'll have tomorrow or not. One of us might get hit driving out of this parking lot and die on impact. We don't know, Lucas, and that's why salvation is so important today, right now – not tomorrow, not in a half an hour, but now.\" Mike sighed and held out the Bible. \"I've told you all that I know to. Do you want it now or not?\" Lucas' first instinct was to say 'no' and hightail it away from this preacher's kid, but, to his own surprise, Lucas found that he did want it – the Bible… and God, salvation. \"Thanks.\" Lucas took the Bible and hastily turned towards his car. \"You know,\" Mike said, \"If you ever want to talk about this some more, or about anything, I'd be more than willing. So would my dad, anyone in my family actually.\" Lucas nodded, but Mike wasn't done just quite yet. \"And I know that it looks like I lost the bet, but I really do hope that something I said, I don't know, penetrated. Because, I've said it twice and I'll say it again: I'm not giving up on you.\" With that, Michael finally got in his car and drove away, leaving Lucas standing there with a Bible, a head spinning with thought, and two hours to kill before the church fellowship. He got in his car, but just sat there, thinking about what Mike had said about getting hit as he drove out. The idea terrified him; he didn't want to die. \"I'm not ready for that yet.\" He voiced aloud what he had been coming to realize over the past couple of hours. The admission shook Lucas. He carefully opened the Bible that he had just been given. He was surprised to see a sticky note attached to the inner flap of the Book. He recognized Mike's handwriting as he read the note. Just in case you want to see for yourself and look some more into what we talked about. Verses were listed below that. It was only their references that had been written down, but still the paper was crowded with writing. And Lucas looked them up, reading every last one of them. Then the young man who, less than three hours previous, had practically made fun of his teammate for praying bowed his head and, with tears in his eyes, did just that, accepting the free gift of God's salvation. It wasn't ten seconds after he raised his head that Mike knocked on his car window, startling Lucas. Lucas rolled the window down, asking, \"What are you doing back here?\" \"Your parents got worried when you didn't come back home, so they called me. I decided to come back and see if you were still here. Have you been here the whole time since I left? Is everything okay?\" Lucas broke into a wide smile. \"Yes… and better than ever.\" Mike looked confused. \"What does that mean?\" By way of an answer, Lucas dug his wallet out of his pocket and handed his teammate back the money that Mike had forfeited earlier. Lucas saw when it dawned on Mike what the return meant. As if he hardly dared to hope, let alone pose the question, Mike asked, \"You've become a Christian?\" But it was a question that Mike already knew the answer to because the smile on the face of his new brother in Christ said it all. This is an idea that has been hanging around in my head for a while, and I decided to share it with you guys. Please review; it makes my day! Thanks!

It had taken him that long to run out of the house and drive to the edge of the woods before hiking out to this particular spot. He hadn't even known that this was where he was going until he found himself there. He fell onto the log, raking his hands through his dark curls. He and Jasmine had only been married two months. He was not ready for this sort of a step, not ready at all. He closed his eyes and tilted his face up to the bright sun, groaning aloud, \"God…\" Whether it was a prayer or a curse, he couldn't tell right now, and he didn't particularly care to try and figure out which one it was. He had much bigger things on his mind, and he needed to do some serious thinking. Pregnant. His wife was going to have a baby, his baby. He groaned again, dropping his head down into his hands. In his pocket, his cell phone rang. He snatched it out and looked at the picture that served as caller ID. Jasmine. Of course she would call. She had to be worried; after all, he had just bolted from the house like it was on fire. In the picture – taken on their wedding day – she looked so happy. His beautiful wife, she was smiling there, had smiled throughout that whole day. But he knew that if he could see her right now, she wouldn't be smiling. She would be upset, maybe even crying. He knew that he hadn't given her the reaction that she had been hoping for. The idea of a baby had set her off-kilter too, he knew, and she had been looking to him for reassurance, security, and leadership as the head of their apparently growing family. And he had just run from her, from their child. He shoved the phone back into his pocket as the call was transferred to voicemail. He couldn't face her right now, not even over the phone. Not until he got this straightened out for himself. As he put the device back in his pocket, his hand brushed the picture that Jasmine had handed him before he'd fled the house. He took it out and stared at it, sighing. He could barely believe what he was looking at. Right now, the baby just looked like a blob of salt and pepper in the black and white picture, barely distinguishable from the rest of the gray and white fuzziness. But it was still there. Still had a heartbeat. Still growing. Still his. He ran his hand over the stubble on his chin, looking out across the lake. A baby . A little person who was going to end up looking to him for love, care, guidance… everything. And yet, even while this little kid scared him out of his mind, he felt this surge of emotion that was stronger than the fear. Love. Still clasping the picture in his hands, he bowed his head, praying, peace flooding him as he spoke, \"Father, give me the strength to be everything that You're calling me to be. Show me the way to lead my wife and child. Please lead me to lead them with strong hands, to stand up when they can't. I don't want to leave them hungry for love, chasing things that I could give them. I'll show them I'm willing to fight and give them the best of my life so we can call this our home. Lead me, Father, 'cause I can't do this alone. I need You and me to do this together.\" Mike raised his head and stood from the log. He started back towards his car, pulling his cell phone back out of his pocket. He needed to make things right with Jasmine. Here it is, the final story in the You and Me Trilogy.

It's just really nice – the picnic, summer… us.\" \"Well, where else would I be?\" She shrugged. \"With the basketball team? With Lucas?

He stood, digging his Swiss army knife out of his jeans' pocket. \"But wood will work, won't it?\" \"What?\" Jasmine laughed. Chase pulled her to her feet, pointing out a nearby chunk of wood propped up on the ground. He led her forward and they knelt in front of it. Jasmine watched, still confused until she saw what he was carving into the wood. CG \"Your turn.\" Chase said, offering her the knife.

And doubts. Doubts about Jasmine and his relationship with her. Doubts that he didn't want to have, let alone think twice about. But how could he not think about it? How could he not doubt that theirs was the relationship that he needed to be in? Tonight was just one more example of how different that they really were on so many levels. But he simply couldn't bring himself to break it off with her. He couldn't give up on her, on the two of them. Something told him that she was going to change, and he wanted to be the one by her side when she did. But right about now he needed a little reassurance. Because – as much as Michael loved Jasmine – he loved his God more, and he needed to be secure in Him that Jasmine was a part of God's will for his life, at least for right now. Mike would let tomorrow hand the things of itself, but for now even today was suspect, and Mike needed to get it straightened out. So he sat in his room on his bed, Bible open in his lap and head bowed in prayer, letting an hour pass. \"Show me, Lord, what Your will is for me and Jasmine,\" he prayed, \"And give me peace in whatever that is and whatever it brings.\" Prayer is man's way to talk to God and the Bible is His way to talk to people, so Mike began to read the Book in his lap, heedless of the time ticking away. And at the end of that hour, he felt at peace in his situation – here in New Hope, and with having Jasmine as his girlfriend – secure that God had shown him where he needed to be.

Immediately thought up a sequel 'cause, you know, I'm a nerd. (And NO, I don't mean I'm a member of the Nucleic Exchange Research and Development lab. But that would be cool.) So anyway. Here's my intro chapter, and I hope you all like it! Emily Reed pushed her way through three other geneticists to the front of the incubator. She wasn't one of the main doctors, but she'd be damned if she didn't get to see it! This was a once-in-a-lifetime kind of thing, she wasn't going to miss a chance to see it or - God forbid - maybe work with it. It was small, alright, but it was bigger than a human baby. Of course, it was about thirty-three percent human, but it definitely didn't look human. Whatever the other half was, it had dominant genes that overwrote human genes. This was so exciting! The thing must have been at least ten pounds! It was only a few hours old. The scientist who had been pregnant with it, as she understood, had been induced at about nine o'clock earlier. It was almost midnight now - eleven-fifty-something. \"Look at it,\" she breathed, getting closer to the incubator and putting her hand near the spot where the baby's chest was. \"Holy shit . What is it?\" \"It's female, and you're fogging up the glass,\" Andrew scoffed, grabbing her arm and pulling her away from the incubator. \"And it's not doing well, so I think you better stop scaring it.\" Emily scoffed right back, yanking her arm away. \" She ,\" that word was carried with an impossible amount of emphasis, \"was crying before I even got here, so you leave me alone.\" She got right back near it and looked in at the baby. She barely had any arms, and they were thinner than sticks. Her fingers were almost imperceptible, but they were there. Her head was big and creased in the middle, with dark, far-set eyes. And she had a tail, with some kind of protrusion at the end. Emily pointed a finger at it. \"Is... Is that a stinger?\" \"That's what we think,\" Andrew replied with an annoyed look, obviously deciding that trying to dissuade her from being so close was useless. \"We'll find some way to surgically remove it.\" \"Damn, all she's missing is the blue skin and she could be, like, Nightcrawler's daughter-\" (1) \"It'll just grow back.\" Both Emily and Andrew turned around at the voice. Behind them, in the doorway of the room, was a blonde woman in a hospital-style gown, wheeling an IV stand along beside her. She looked worn, and tired of the whole world, as if she just wanted to die. \"E-Elsa, you shouldn't be up.\" One of the other scientists, a meek lab technician named Jeremy, stepped over to the woman. \"You just gave birth three hours ago.\" \"I want to go home.\" Elsa's voice was cold and the only emotion that Sam could detect was barely repressed anger. \"When can I leave ?\" \"In the morning.\" Jeremy put his arm around Elsa and turned her around the other way. \"Come on, I'll take you back to your room.\" With that, both of them left the room. Emily raised an eyebrow. \"What's in her panties?\" Andrew sighed. \"She didn't want the kid. But a lot of industries are gonna benefit from what this thing's got inside it - maybe humans too.\" He tapped the top of the incubator, eliciting a high-pitched whine from the infant inside. \"So Joan Chorot offered her a deal she couldn't refuse.\" \"So, basically we bought the baby?\" \"Yeah, pretty much. Elsa doesn't want anything to do with it.\" Emily leaned down and looked at the infant again. The label on the incubator read H-30 . That must have meant 30% human. H-30 blinked at her, ceasing its cries for a moment. Emily met its reflective black eyes, and wasn't sure whether to smile or be horrified. It clearly wasn't all human, but life was a miracle no matter what it was. After a moment, H-30 continued to scream in the way that infants do for days after birth. Emily stood up and straightened her back, crossing her arms over her chest and scanning the creature. \"I think she's cute. I'd love to be able to work with her.\" Andrew snickered, slapping her on the shoulder. \"Hey. Better you than me, Em.\" \" Don't call me that !\" \"Emily Reed. Do have a seat.\" Emily swallowed hard and did as Joan asked, sitting two seats away from the woman at the head of the table. \"Afternoon, ma'am.\" \"Let's skip the chitchat, shall we, Dr. Reed?\" Joan leaned forward. \"This discussion concerns the infant specimen H-30, who as you know was born last night.\" \"Yes. I saw her.\" \"I know. And thanks to Dr. Reynolds, I also know that you expressed interest in working with her.\" \"Andrew's a bigmouth. Why would he tell you?\" Joan interlaced her fingers, resting her chin on the bridge they made. \"I was in the incubator room, looking for some persons who would be potential caretakers for H-30. And before Dr. Reynolds commented, no one seemed to be keen on the idea. But he said you were fascinated by her and wanted to spend time with her.\" Emily blinked a few times, then nodded slowly. \"Yeah, I... well, I guess so. I've never worked with anything like that before, and it seems like it'd be a great opportunity. Not to mention, so cool .\" Joan smiled slightly. \"That's what I wanted to hear, Dr. Reed. I am offering you that chance. Will you take it?\" Emily felt her eyes widen. \"What, you mean like - like be her babysitter or something?\" Joan shrugged. \"Well, essentially, yes. I want you to work with her. To find out how she processes things, to draw blood and test her, to impart to her new concepts and to help her learn. She has a lot of valuable resources inside her body, but we can't make use of them if she gets herself killed. If she follows the path of her father Dren, the half-human hybrid created by Elsa Kast and Clive Nicoli, she should mature to the equivalent of eighteen years in... a month.\" Emily's eyes bugged out of her skull again. \"But... But that means... she'll... she'll die in less than a year!\" She received a nod in response. \"We're anticipating that. However, we're hoping that since she was conceived inside a real human uterus instead of an artificial variant, perhaps the aging may slow down once she reaches maturity. Or her rate of aging is not as fast as Dren's was. But if you should accept this position, it will be your responsibility to test her, isolate enzymes and proteins. You can hand them off to someone else to synthesize, but I want you to understand that I am putting a lot of responsibility on your shoulders, Dr. Reed.\" Emily glanced down at the slick wood of the table. She put her hands atop it and started playing with the frayed threads on the ends of her too-long sleeves. She thought about it for a minute. If something she did caused H-30 to die, she would be blamed fully. It wouldn't be blamed on an immature immune system, or the instability of hybrids. On the other hand, if she helped the child flourish and she survived longer than expected, it would feel so rewarding. Maybe the child would even come to think of her as a mother figure. It would be great if she would be able to teach something that had come into this world knowing nothing, and maybe not even being capable of fending for itself. Taking care of it and teaching it would be an amazing experience. \"... I'll do it.\" (1) - X-MEN REFERENCE YOU KNOW YOU LOVES IT. lol... Reviews make me muchly happy! And keep me writing!

She smiled at the scruffy looking man sitting across the table. He winked and waited. Elsa leaned back in her chair and toyed the creaminess around with her tongue. The man crossed his arms and watched Elsa's cheeks squeeze in and out. Elsa swallowed the mouthful and tucked a blond strand of hair behind her ear. \"You're staring, Gian.\" \"Observing,\" Gian answered. He leaned over the table and took a bite of the cheesecake himself. \"Not bad.\" \"No, observing is watching without expectations. You're expecting an answer.\" \"So what is it?\" \"What's what? Gian pointed at the plate. \"The cheesecake! What's the verdict?\" Elsa poked the side of the cheesecake with her fork. \"It's very chewy. What's in it?\" \"A special concoction of essential vitamins and minerals made just for you,\" Gian beamed. Elsa looked at the cafeteria around them. There were families and professionals eating out of lunch trays and conversing among themselves about whatever was bringing them together. The white tile floors and walls made everything feel very clean. Elsa was never a neat freak herself. Gian's spontaneity was probably what allured Elsa out of seclusion. She liked his charm and brilliance but overall Elsa knew it was the individuality that counted the most. \"So where'd you make it, in the Hospital Kitchen?\" Elsa laughed quietly as she stabbed herself another piece. Gian laughed with her and shrugged. \"Well…the kitchens in the back aren't half bad but I prefer the intimacy of my own kitchen.\" \"You bake?\" \"I cook more than I bake, but yes.\" \"Impressive.\" Elsa wiped her mouth with her napkin. Gian bowed his head. \"Grazi.\" Elsa noticed Gian's coat pocket blinking with light. \"You're flashing, Gian.\" Gian panicked and checked his zipper. \"Your cell?\" He reached in his pocket and checked the text message that had just been sent to him. His faced grimaced. \"I thought you had an hour.\" \"I did and it was a very good hour. Don't forget about your frequent bathroom breaks.\" \"I'm pregnant, Gian. Sue me.\" Gian got up from his chair and walked over to hug Elsa. Elsa closed her eyes and smiled as the pressure of his arms tightened around her shoulders. \"Good seeing you again. If you didn't like the cheesecake just throw the rest away.\" \"No, no. I liked it. The folic acid will do some good for me anyway.\" \"Awesome. Now I don't want to sound like your practitioner, which I am by the way, but you'll need to come back next week for another check up. I want to see how the fetus is developing.\" Elsa nodded. \"Get some rest Elsie, you look stressed.\" \"I'll be fine.\" Gian's pocket lit up again and he raised his hands up in surrender. \"Duty calls.\" \"Go save the world, Doctor.\" Elsa smiled as Gian walked away from her and the cheesecake. Elsa took another bite before getting up to throw the cheesecake into the trash can. She grabbed her purse and hurried out of the cafeteria. On her way to the bathroom Elsa kept her cool as always and saved the hurting for the lavatory. She cradled her lower abdomen with her hand and bit her lower lip. In her head she knew the pressure was getting more intense but she couldn't afford to tell anyone that, especially not Gian. As soon as she entered the door with the women icon Elsa was home free to cry in angst. Elsa woke up in water. She thought she had been sleeping her bed but after realizing that she was instead drifting away naked on the surface of a calm sea she knew what reality to her was. She looked around her and saw white petals and orchids drifting alongside her body. White rose petals spiraled from the bright blue sky above her. She was in a haven. Elsa flipped her body around and sunk lower into the water. Beneath her there was darkness and warmth. She thought of underwater volcanoes that were ready to burst. She preferred the sunshine and petals that shadowed above her to the emptiness below. As she swam upwards a school of colorful fish danced around her arms and legs. They complimented her curves with their currents. As she followed the fish back to the surface Elsa noticed the water breaking into a fountain of bubbles several feet away. Elsa felt her skin tighten as the temperature in the water began to rise. She floated on the surface, moving her arms and legs around until she felt one with the sea and the fish. Then the fish circled the bubbling on the water until the activity had stopped. Elsa saw something floating where the activity was and decided to swim towards it. But as she neared the thing Elsa recognized its pink fleshiness as an enlarged human fetus. Elsa had no time to react. One tug around her ankle and she was pulled back into the darkness of the water below. She didn't know what it was but she knew that it had gotten a hold of her and it wasn't letting go. She woke up again but in her bed instead. There was no warm water to surround her or beautiful flowers to graze her skin. She was reminded of the blackness by the room she was in. She kicked away the blankets and pulled her knees into her stomach. The city lights shone through the blinds and immersed the room with dark stripes. Elsa touched her chest and relaxed her muscles. It had been two weeks since Clive's death and she was still calling the apartment home. She ate where they used to eat, bathed where they used to wash together and every room she stepped into still smelled of him. But in that moment where her only home was a tomb and her head was still repeating the nightmare, Elsa would've given anything to be somewhere else.

( Bold: Jade , italics: Charlie ) \" Hello?\" \" Jade?\" \" This is she.\" \" It's Charlie.\" \" Hey, baby bro. what's up?\" \" Hey, I need a place to stay. I kind of ran away. Can I stay with you?\" \" Well it's about time. I've been waiting for you to call me about this for a long time. And you are always welcome here.\" \" Hey thanks. I'll be on the next plane into Tennessee.\" \" Ok. I'll see you when you get here.\" And that's what I did. I got on the next flight out and when I got there, there was a huge sign with \"CHARLIE\" on it. Some people were looking at it weird but I didn't care. I ran towards it and jumped into Jade's arms. \"I can't believe you are finally here! And for good!\" she screamed. More people looked at us weird but again I didn't care. Jade was always like this and I love her for it. \"I know. I am so psyched. I can't wait to actually work on a farm.\" I told her. \"Well, then this is your lucky day. I have a horse that needs an owner. And I think he'll be perfect for you.\" \"Really? What's his name?\" \"Rags.\" That is the end. I hope you liked it. And please review.

R for Rich Charlie Prince bukanlah seseorang yang hidup mewah dengan harta yang melimpah atau seseorang yang memiliki kekuasaan yang begitu besar sehingga dia dapat menggapai segalanya dengan mudah. Jika ada yang berpikir seperti itu, maka Kadee akan menjawab lantang dengan kata 'Tidak'. Kadee tahu bahwa Charlie tidak memliki harta atau kekuasaan yang melimpah, dia hidup dengan sederhana. Untuk menghidupi dirinya sendiri saja, Charlie harus bekerja sebagai musisi jalanan dan pelayan restoran di tempat kerabat ibunya. Walaupun dia tidak mempunyai harta yang melimpah, ada satu hal yang dipunyai dari seorang Charlie yang tidak kebanyakan orang lain punya yaitu sifatnya yang baik hati, dia mempunyai hati yang begitu lembut seperti sutra tetapi dibalik sifat lembutnya, ia juga mempunyai hati yang keras seperti baja. Dia tidak pernah mengeluh dengan hidupnya yang ia jalani, dia selalu tersenyum menghadapi semuanya termasuk menghadapi ayah dan kedua kakak tirinya yang tidak pernah bosan menganggu hidupnya. Dia memang tidak kaya dalam harta benda atau pun kekuasaan namun bagi Kadee, Charlie memiliki kekayaan yang begitu besar pada dirinya yang tidak mungkin orang lain punya. Dia mempunyai hati yang besar dan karena itulah Kadee jatuh hati kepada Charlie Prince—seorang musisi jalanan yang telah merebut seluruh hatinya. A for Anxious Resah, itu lah yang dirasakan oleh Kadee ketika ia memikirkan seorang pria bernama Charlie. Entah mengapa hati Kadee selalu di buat resah dengan kehadiran pria yang saat ini sudah mengisi seluruh hatinya, lubang-lubang di hatinya yang dulu sempat terbuka lebar kini sudah terisi penuh dengan cairan cinta yang Charlie berikan kepada dirinya. Kadee begitu resah ketika dia tidak mendapatkan kabar tentang pangerannya seharian ini. Yah, seorang Charlie Prince dapat membuat Kadee Worth resah seharian ini, tidak beranjak dari kamarnya sedikit pun. Mengabaikan makan malam yang sudah dibuatkan untuknya. Ah, seorang Kadee Worth begitu resah hingga ia mengabaikan dirinya sendirinya. Jatuh cinta memang selalu membuat hati seseorang menjadi resah, apalagi ketika seseorang yang kita cintai tidak memberikan kabar sedikit pun kepada kita yang sedang menunggunya. Itulah yang Kadee rasakan ketika sedang menunggu kabar Charlie. Pria itu selalu membuat hati dan pikiran Kadee menjadi resah dan gelisah. Bukankah itu menandakan bahwa Kadee benar-benar jatuh cinta kepada Charlie Prince. Kadee Worth tersenyum ketika nama seseorang yang dia kenal terpampang jelas di layar ponselnya dan segera ia mengangkat panggilan tersebut. \"I miss you so much.\" ungkapan hati seorang Kadee seharian ini kepada Charlie—pria yang berada di seberang sambungan sana. Dengan begitu hati Kadee tidak lagi resah. G for Great Charlie Prince adalah sosok pria yang sangat Kadee kagumi. Bukan pahlawan yang saja yang dapat dikagumi atau pun aktor-aktris yang bisa di puja-puja. Kadee sangat mengidolakan Charlie layaknya orang-orang terkenal. Ayahnya sampai jenuh ketika mendengarkan cerita mengenai Charlie dari mulut Kadee. Jika Kadee sudah menceritakan tentang Charlie maka Kadee tidak akan pernah berhenti bercerita tentang pria itu. Kadee sangat mengagumi Charlie layaknya idola di dunia ini. Charlie sangat hebat dalam segala hal, entah dalam bernyanyi, menari, atau pun untuk urusan ranjang. Yah, Charlie Prince begitu hebat dalam segala hal dan itulah mengapa Kadee begitu cinta dengan pria itu. Ketika memikirkan itu semua semburat merah memenuhi wajah cantik Kadee, sungguh memalukan jika mengingat semua tentang Charlie.

Puedes imaginar que es tu nombre el de la chica ;) Sin más que agregar, espero que lo disfruten. EL CHICO MISTERIOSO Mi nombre es Diana, Diana Méndez, y estoy aquí para contarte algo que me pasó hace un par de meses. Todo empezó cuando iba caminando de regreso del colegio a mi casa, se me hizo tarde y mi reloj marcaba las 7:30 p.m. Tenía que pasar por un callejón oscuro poco antes de llegar a mi casa y cuando lo hice escuché el grito de una mujer y me escondí detrás de la pared intentando escuchar lo que estaba pasando y enseguida vino la voz masculina gruesa que decía -Saca todo lo de la bolsa, ¡Esto es un asalto!-. En ese momento no me importó si era buena idea o no, pero me asomé para ver lo que ocurría, y en efecto, era una señora siendo asaltada por un hombre con una pistola. Estuve a punto de gritar por ayuda, pero solo tuve tiempo de abrir la boca cuando un joven, y digo joven, porque un adulto no podría haberse movido de esa manera, este chico llegó y con una patada al estilo karateka le quitó la pistola al asaltante para luego darle un golpe con su puño derecho en la parte baja del abdomen haciendo que éste saliera corriendo sin recoger la pistola. El muchacho calmó un poco a la señora y luego hizo una leve reverencia y desapareció en la oscuridad del callejón. En ese momento pensé que seguramente alguien le había echado alguna droga alucinógena al jugo de naranja que tomé en el colegio, pero al instante deseché esa idea, porque seamos realistas, ¡esa idea sonaba absurda! Debo admitir que nunca fui una admiradora de los superhéroes ni nada por el estilo, aunque debo decir que este chico cumplía con las características que te dicen en los comics, pero a diferencia de esos personajes, el chico del callejón no llevaba puesto un traje de licra de colores brillantes ni una capa, sino que usaba un esmoquin y un sombrero tipo boisalino de color negro y un antifaz del mismo color que lo anterior en lugar de una máscara que cubriera completamente su rostro. Al día siguiente decidí ir al callejón a la misma hora que el día anterior, aproximadamente a las 7:00 p.m. salí de mi casa y en cuanto llegué al callejón di unos cuantos pasos adentrándome en la oscuridad y me aseguré que no hubiera alguien cerca, después de hacerlo coloqué ambas manos al lado de mi boca y grité lo más fuerte que pude - ¡Auxilio!-. Observé a mí alrededor esforzándome por ver lo más claramente posible a través de la oscuridad. Nadie apareció. Repetí la acción con mis manos y volví a gritar -¡Auxilio!-. De nuevo no obtuve respuesta. Lo volví a intentar, llevé mis manos a mi boca y tomé aire para gritar -¡Auxilio!- por una última vez. Seguía sola en el callejón. Pensé que la teoría de la droga en mi jugo podría en cierta parte ser verdad. Empecé a avanzar con pasos lentos fuera del callejón, pero un ruido de algo golpeando el suelo me hizo voltear a medio camino. –No pareces necesitar ayuda- dijo un chico mientras se acercaba lentamente a mí. Era el \"superhéroe\" que había visto el día anterior y me quede ahí parada sin decir nada. –O puede que sí, hace un rato gritabas y ahora no hablas- me dijo con un tono irónico –Yo… este…- trataba de decir algo, pero no podía, con un par de pasos hacia atrás me recargué de espaldas contra la pared de uno de los muros a la vez que él seguía acercándose lo suficiente para colocar su mano derecha al lado de mi cabeza por encima de mi hombro y recargarse en ella haciendo que su rostro quedara a pocos centímetros del mío –Alguien más podría necesitar mi ayuda de verdad- su voz era firme. Podía oler su perfume desde esta posición y aún en la oscuridad pude ver sus ojos grandes y azules que resaltaban por el antifaz -¿Quién eres?- Pregunte sin titubear. –Soy alguien a quien no le gustan las injusticias- Me respondió y pude sentir su respiración. Mi corazón latía cada vez con más fuerza. No era miedo. Era algo diferente, tragué saliva para poder elaborar mi siguiente pregunta -¿Puedo saber tu nombre?- El chico me miro por unos segundos –Eso es parte del misterio- Respondió negando con la cabeza –Pero puedes llamarme Rags- Esbozó una pequeña sonrisa y se alejó caminando perdiéndose en la oscuridad antes de que pudiera decir algo más. Durante la semana siguiente no pase por el callejón en la tarde, todo había sido tan… misterioso y yo seguía sin querer creer que fuera cierto ero no podía dejar de pensar en sus hermosos ojos azules. Estaba renuente a siquiera creer que él había podido ir al callejón a buscarme. No fue sino hasta dos semanas después que tuve que quedarme hasta tarde en la escuela para realizar un trabajo que tuve que pasar de nuevo por el callejón cuando estuvo oscuro. Iba caminando pensado si me lo iría a encontrar cuando sentí que alguien tiró bruscamente de mi brazo adentrándome al callejón colocándome contra la pared y tapándome la boca con la palma de la mano impidiendo que siguiera gritando. –No grites- Susurró, pues no había necesidad de levantar la voz por la cercanía de su rostro con el mío. Negué con la cabeza a manera de entendimiento y bajó su mano lentamente –Me asustaste- Di un leve golpe con mi puño en su hombro sin lograr alejarlo –Lo siento, no era mi intención pero es que hace tiempo que no te veía y para serte sincero, te extrañé- No pude evitar sonreír como tonta, esperé que él no lo notara pero era demasiado obvio que me alegraba escucharlo decir eso –Yo-yo también te extrañé- Titubeé. Siempre me pasaba cuando él se me acercaba. –Tienes una bonita sonrisa –Me di un golpe mental en la cabeza, tenía que dejar de sonreír de esa manera. Un ligero calor recorrió mis mejillas, señal de que me estaba sonrojando. –Yo… gracias. ¿Por qué te dicen Rags?- Pregunté con curiosidad. –Todo superhéroe tiene una identidad secreta, la gente fue quien me empezó a llamar así -Al explicar quitó un mechón de cabello de mi cara colocándolo detrás de mi oreja -¿Algún día sabré tu nombre verdadero?- No sé por qué razón llevé mis manos a su cuello haciéndolo sonreír –Identidad secreta, recuerda- Esta fue otra manera de decirme que no insistiera. –Está bien, Ty- Mi respiración ya se había normalizado a pesar de la cercanía que tenia con él. Hubo un momento de silencio, nada incómodo. Mi mirada iba de sus ojos a su boca y de vuelta a sus ojos, no estoy segura de cómo pasó pero de un segundo a otro lo vi acercándose lentamente hacia mí hasta que el espacio entre nuestros labios se cerró para fundirnos en un dulce y tierno beso. El mejor que pude haber recibido en mis 20 años de vida. Se separó de mí, me regalo una de sus hermosas sonrisas e hizo una pequeña reverencia como de costumbre y se alejó caminando a la oscuridad. Desde ese encuentro nos hemos visto mínimo una vez a la semana, hace dos semanas empezamos a salir por las tardes cuando el sol ilumina las calles y antes de que me pregunten algo, al fin me dijo su nombre y conozco al chico detrás del antifaz, pero no se los diré porque es un secreto, todo superhéroe tiene una identidad secreta y si les digo su nombre ya no lo será más, para la gente siempre será 'Rags, el chico misterioso' y pues para mí será el chico de mis sueños hasta que el destino nos separé así como nos ha juntado. A/N: Y bueno, esto fue todo por esta vez, espero que les haya gustado, si es así dejen un review y si no les gustó, también déjenlo, agradecería mucho su opinión.

I hear voices, but they're muffled. I try to tell them to stop, but when I open my mouth, the warm liquid rushes in and all I do is make garbled noises. No one hears me and the noises continue. I've been in here for so long. It's so dark and wet in here. I want to be in the light. I don't mind the wet, but I want to feel dry and see what it's like. Most of all, I want Out. It's been too long. I'm starting to feel like I'll never get out. My legs are slow in the liquid, but I try and kick out. I kick as hard as I can, but I don't hear much noise outside. My kicks must not be doing much, so I stop. Maybe I'll try again later. Maybe I won't. The voices come louder and more often now. I wonder what's going on. It gets brighter once and a while, more often then it ever has before. It's not too long before the voices will start up again after they get quiet. Maybe I'll finally get out... The voices are loud today. They're really loud. Today is busy. I hear voices and loud noises outside. Then there's a loud voice. The voice goes on and on and it's the loudest voice of all. It seems to make my whole body vibrate with its volume. I hear it over my head and suddenly I'm being pushed. The liquid is rushing out and I'm being carried out by the rush of liquid. I cry out, but no one can hear me in here. Suddenly, I'm scared. I don't know what's out there, but I know exactly what's in here. It's warm, wet, and safe. I don't want to leave anymore, but I don't have a choice. Then there's a small point of light, it slowly gets bigger and bigger and I close my eyes. The light is too bright...it hurts...it hurts so much...so I curl up inside my small area and pull it closed behind me. I can still see through the thin skin in front, but now I'm safe inside my special area. It protects me. I'm not ready to be outside yet, so this shell of flesh will protect me. It has to... I'm grabbed suddenly and hands wrap around my shell. I shriek. The air! It hurts! Even through my shell, the air hurts. It doesn't feel good like the liquid. I shriek and squirm, trying to get back to the dark. The hands hold me firmer and I shoot my tail out at them. I move so fast through this burning air! My stinger slips free of my skin and I hit a hand holding me. There's a loud noise and then I'm falling! My shell hits something cold and hard. I'm grabbed again and slammed inside something. I yell as a hand moves and the area closes. I'm trapped in this small area. I yell and thrash, but the noises are quieter now. No one notices me and no one cares, except for one person. I see blonde hair that hangs limply around a head. Piercing brown eyes stare at me. They're filled with something I don't have a word for, but it makes me shake inside my shell. It scares me. The face is wet and it looks tired, but the eyes...the eyes are alive...alive with something that makes me fall quiet in terror... Elsa POV I see the lump of flesh I've just given birth too. It's disgusting. Dren, my child, fathered this...this thing. Clive should have fathered any child I had, but because I hesitated, he's dead. Clive...William...Gavin... My eyes narrow as I glare hatefully at the squirming lump of flesh in the incubator. It pauses and I know it's watching me, but that's good. I want it to know I hate it. It looks just like Dren when Dren was born. A strange ball of flesh with a tail and she even stung someone too, just like her father stung me. It's strange to think of Dren as a male when I raised him as a female for months, but it's the male version of Dren that attacked me and raped me, making me get pregnant with this abomination. No...this isn't true. I would have tried to create it on my own eventually, but I wouldn't have gotten pregnant with it. Dren made that happen. He put me through this. They've asked me to do these journal entries to see how I feel each day. Personally, I think it's just to see how stable I am. Either way, I have no problem being completely and utterly honest in these entries. They're going to ask me to name it. I know they will. This...thing. Joan will make sure I'm the one to name it, if it's given a name. I don't know why. Names mean attachment. We need to take samples and treat this like a specimen, not a human. That's where Clive and I screwed up. It will be easier to train it and teach it with a name however... One of the two bit scientists that helped me deliver, approaches me. He's timid and acts nervous. Does he think I'll bite his freaking head off? Well, I have gotten more hostile between Clive's death and the hormones. For a while, I was depressed over the loss of Clive, but when I learned of my pregnancy, I decided I needed to live my life. I couldn't just walk around already dead. When I chose to live, I chose to choose how I live. My demeanor became a bit harsh. I push people away, I know I do, but that's all the better. The only one I can depend on is me. Even Clive betrayed me when he nearly slept with Dren. \"Miss Kast? Do you have a name for it in mind? We'd like to write in the file if you have selected one already?\" 'Selected one.' Not 'picked out a name.' Thesis just a specimen to experiment on to them. So, what is this little lump of flesh to me exactly? I'll figure that out as soon as I deal with this annoying little man. I regard the man coldly. He has so little a clue of the biological goldmine I've just given birth to. Only a select few have significant information about what is going on. \"I couldn't care less.\" My eyes fall on the folder a woman nearby is holding. Dren's heir has been given the experiment title B.E.A.S.T., which stands for Biologically Engineered And Structured Theory. Cute. \"Name it Beast.\" The man nods timidly then scurries back to his companions. Not a backbone among them I notice. I turned my gaze back to the now calm glob of flesh. It turns slightly and I wonder if it knows I'm watching it. I hope it does. Dren was a failure. Attacking her own mother? Killing? No. This time it will be different. This time...I will have the perfect child. So, I just saw Splice and it's amazinggg...definitely recommend it(though beware it can get intense at times with violence and nudity), but still I think it was incredible. So one of the things I want to throw out there is that I had Beast know what hands were and voices and yes if Beast was just born how would it have names for these things. Well, I had writer's block so yea. Anywhooo...let me know what you guys think and if I should continue! Thanks!:D[Chapter 2] Day 30: Handlers Beast POV Two months. It's been two months today I've been alive or so I'm told... About two weeks ago, I shed my shell. It didn't seem very surprising to the people that saw. I've learned since then, ways to act and words for things. The lady that gave birth to me, Elsa, had been angry when I shed the shell. I shudder as I remember that day... It was so terrible...I was so scared... Slowly, I climb out of my shell. I use my tail, sliding out the needle through the tail's shell, to slice down the thin length to my main body. It's a tight area, but I manage to squirm and cut the rest I need to and wiggle out. My legs are shaky, but my tail helps to steady me. Once out of my shell, I notice I have small feelers by my nose that test the air. I can smell the various people around me. They all stare at me, with emotions ranging from disgust on Elsa's face to amazement on a sweet looking brunette girl with glasses. I'm in a room that seems huge for my size. There's different items I'll look at later, but right now my gaze is focused on the two exits: one a currently closed door and two a very large window where the faces currently stare out at me from. I watch a timid man ask Elsa about me. He has short black hair and seems...mousy to me. My instincts tell me when he talks to Elsa he's the victim and she's the attacker, a vicious animal ready to pounce on her prey, and I'm right. When he speaks to her, her words come out quick and harsh. Their voices are muffled through the glass, but I have keen ears. \"M...Miss Kast? We have to i...identify the sex of Beast now that it's come...come out of its shell...\" \"And you're telling me this because?!\" I understand why the man seems scared. The woman scares me too... The man is taken aback by her harsh tone. Unlike me, he didn't expect it. \"We...well, is there any physical way to tell the sex?\" I glance at the others and they seem to be thinking the same thing. Well, they had said I was one of a kind... Elsa makes an irritated noise and enters my room through the door. She kneels and brushes a hand gently against my forehead. Her face seems softer and I coo at the kind gesture. Suddenly, her hand presses firmly on my forehead and she pushes me backward, holding my head to the ground. I thrash with my legs and shriek, but she's far stronger and I'm still young, so I'm no match for her. Her hand reaches and shoves my legs apart, making me go limp with shock. I'm not that old and I don't know much, but I know this is wrong by the way my blood runs cold and the faces of the people watching pale. Elsa points with her free hand and talks in a bitter tone. \"See, this ?! This is usually only on a male.\" Most of the people look sick or ashamed they didn't think of this. The sweet looking girl I noticed earlier seems to barely contain her anger. I don't know why she's so angry, but it makes me feel better. It makes me feel less pathetic as I lay here. The people hurriedly find things to write or check and take their attention off Elsa and me. She looks at me coldly and speaks in a low hiss. \"Don't ever fight me again or you will be punished. Just like you will be now.\" I try to figure out what she means, but before I can her hand moves lower and she grabs me and tears shoot to my eyes. It hurts...it hurts... I scream, but no one understands me and no one seems to care, but I see the delighted look on Elsa's face as she watches me writhe in pain. Finally, after an eternity, she lets go of my flesh and I can breath. I lay coughing and as soon as her hand is off my head, I scramble to my feet and hurry to the corner. One of the more bizarre things in the room, is a small tower made of material. It has shelves to climb on and boxes with holes, one of which I now jump into and curl up in the corner. My body shakes, from pain or fear I don't know, and I croon sadly. Why? Why does she hate me? What did I do? I press my face between my knees and cry softly, fat tears that drop from my eyes like stones down to the plush material at my feet. Elsa POV I stand briskly and wipe off my jeans. It wasn't professional how I acted, but I don't care. No one saw me. Besides, they're all spineless little 'scientists.' In all honesty, I haven't gotten to know any yet to see if any are actually decent scientists. These people will be working with me long enough so I should find out, I guess. My eyes scan the cat climbing tower that Beast has currently hidden himself in. It's a fairly elaborate tower. If he takes to it we may put in a larger one or a small children's playground to accompany his size. We've already started to create a plan to see how lithe and agile Beast can be. If he stays fairly small for a while, I plan to install reinforced cat climbing walls for him. Dren couldn't be properly trained and monitored, but the same mistakes that happened with Dren won't happen to Beast. There'd be no excuse for it. I stride to the door confidently and just before I cross the threshold I glance back at the tower. Beast has his head poked out the smallest bit, but, upon seeing me, he hides back among the shadows. Good. Dren was never obedient enough. We'll fix that with Beast. The door closes behind me and I scan the reports quickly being written. Naturally, they're flawed so I correct them. I call out corrections as I walk behind the writing figures. \"Beast is fifteen pounds, not eleven. He has feelers in front in less quantity than Dren. Beast does not have a head division as profound as Dren's was. We have only given him shredded meat, not chopped.\" I pause behind the last station. It is a smaller woman with light brunette hair, although I see sun streaks in it. Unlike the others frantically writing, she is sitting studying Beast's housing station. Her chin rests on the back of a hand and I see by her posture she is nearly in a trance as she waits for Beast to reappear. \"We do not have regular glass instead of one-way so that you can waste time idly staring into space.\" The woman jumps, startled by my voice. She turns to look up at me and I take in her appearance. Her skin is ghostly white, as if I scared her far beyond I realized, but I can tell by her narrow, offended eyes this isn't the case. Wide, chocolate brown eyes sit above a small nose and small lips. Overall, her face seems to belong more to a girl than a woman, but her body has the full curves of a woman. As a scientist, I'm used to observing things and noticing patterns and while her breasts and curves aren't as dramatic as many men may desire, I can tell she has a sweet face and her curves are more than enough attraction to capture attention. Her work seems to be serious to her though because unlike a woman named Denise three stations down, who has barely more impressive cleavage, this woman's lab coat has only one button undone for breathing room and her hair is drawn back in a thick headband, out of her face. My entire analysis probably only takes about a minute, but you can gauge a lot based on a person's demeanor and appearance. For example, the fact that she is nearly as attractive as Denise, but doesn't flaunt it with a revealing top and gaudy makeup makes me more relying on this woman for useful information. Perhaps it is unfair to judge upon looks, but I feel this is not true. I feel I am free to judge someone on the way they choose to make themselves look, but not physical imperfections beyond their control. \"Ma'am.\" The woman's soft voice draws my attention, but I do not start. I can not allow myself to be seen doing something I just chastised someone for doing. \"I was observing Beast, not wasting time.\" \"Beast is currently in hiding. There is nothing to be gained from observing him at the moment.\" I turn to leave her station, but she hurriedly speaks, making me pause. \"I don't think that's true, ma'am.\" Slowly, I turn back to the woman. \"Pardon?\" She fixes her glasses and stands. \"If someone is observing Beast, when he comes out of hiding we can better tell his nature. For instance, if he comes out slowly, he has more of a timid nature, but...\" \"Then we shall install cameras.\" \"Ms. Kast. With all due respect, witnessing these things firsthand can be greatly different than merely watching on a video screen.\" She stares at me fiercely. Slowly, I smile. This girl...I like her. She has an edge to her unlike the others. This girl isn't stupid, but she is soft enough that she may fill the position I have been at a loss of how to fill until now... \"Well, Miss...\" \"Williams. Kris Williams.\" She smiles at me, but it's a careful smile, a calculated smile. This girl thinks she can appeal to my gentler side. Unfortunately for her, anything I had that may have resembled a gentle side died the day that Clive died. \"Well, Miss Williams, I have been looking for someone to fill a certain position and I think you may be quite suitable for the job.\" She simply nods expectantly, eyes patiently searching my face for a hint or clue as to the position I'm referring to. \"You see, I need to be at different facilities that monitor different readings and samples we extract from Beast. Naturally, I will be performing tests myself and I need to check in on these various testing areas. While away, I need someone to keep an eye on Beast. Yes, I am very much aware there will be various people and machines monitoring Beast at all times, but Beast needs to be familiar with a few select people in person so he is not overwhelmed and it isn't miscommunicated who has the permission to directly interact with him. He is very young and one of a kind, so he needs to be handled with care. So I am offering you the position of co-caretaker alongside myself.\" Something flashes across her eyes, although I'm not quite sure what it is. She glances back at the cat tower and I see Beast poke his head out, feelers sensing for danger. When his eyes land on me, he freezes and quickly withdraws back into the tower. As he vanishes from view, something in the girl's demeanor hardens. Her body stiffens and she turns toward me with a fierce determination in her eyes. \"I accept.\" I nod. \"Very well. I'll have the proper paperwork drawn up as soon as possible for legal reasons, but you can start immediately. Basically, you'll be his handler when I'm not around or I'm busy. However, this will be different than in the case of Fred and Ginger. You won't be held accountable for mistakes made by others, only your own. That will be all.\" The girl nods and her enthusiasm is nearly tangible. \"May I go in now, Miss Kast?\" Her voice holds a note of hope and I know I have chosen the right person for this role. \"Go ahead, but be brief. We'll be wrapping up shortly.\" As she heads toward the door, I turn in the opposite direction to continue my assessments. Kris POV Due to my being co-handler to Beast, I am supposed to do these logs. So here it goes... The day I first meet Beast, I'm terrified. What if he doesn't respond well to me? I so badly want to work closely with him. It would be an incredible experience! I slowly open the door and look around, but I'm pretty sure I'll still find Beast in the cat tower. While everyone was rapidly typing in information or writing notes, I saw what Elsa did. I saw the look of horror on his face and the pain in his eyes. His squealing and squeaking go unnoticed by most of the scientists, but I'm constantly keeping an eye on him, if possible. I couldn't do anything because back then I couldn't get close. Now, I crouch and crab walk over to the tower, keeping a hand cupped toward the ceiling. Beast's nose hesitantly pokes out of the hole, his feelers squishing and tasting the air. He turns his head to focus one eye on me. It's still wide with fear, so I talk in a soothing voice. \"Hey...hey there...my name is Kris. Everyone is calling you Beast, but you're just a sweetheart, aren't you...?\" His head pokes fully out and my hand is less than two feet away, but I very slowly move it closer as I speak. \"Tell you what...I'll be your friend...how's that sound? I'll be your very best friend...why don't you say hi...?\" I smile and his form seems to let the fear instantly fade from it. He chirps softly and leans his cheek into my hand, making me smile. I can't speak freely due to the monitors, but mentally I make a promise. I won't allow Elsa to hurt Beast like this again. He won't be humiliated or inflicted with pain like that again. My hands had held him as he came out of Elsa. He was squirming, noisy, and bloody, just like a human baby, and in his own way, he was just as beautiful as a regular human baby. It's difficult to describe. Most people would say I'm a freak or mental for thinking such things, but that doesn't change how I feel. I'll watch out for Beast. His own mother doesn't love him and won't look out for him so I will. I'll protect him and love him. He croons and I smile. Yes, my little friend. I promise. Well, there's chapter 2! Hope you guys liked it. A couple quick things I want to get out of the way, though. I'm not very good at science so if I include anything of science that doesn't make sense just let me know and I'll fix it. Also, I'm probably only going to have the 3 POVs so it doesn't get too confusing. So any ideas or things you'd want to see just let me know! As always I love to hear from you guys so please review! Till next time!:D[Chapter 3] Hey guys! Been a while! So just a heads up I change perspectives a lot in this one. I hope it doesn't get too confusing, but let me know how it is and I'll try to alter future chapters based on the feedback on my perspective switching. Anyways enough of my rambling...enjoy! Day 60: Experiments Beast POV The door opens and I cry out happily. My legs are really long now so I reach the woman in just a few strides. It's Kris, it always is. Once I had someone else visit who wasn't nice like her. It was a man who was mean and tried to take some of my blood so I attacked him with my stinger. Kris wasn't very happy with me because of it, but I could tell she was angry that the man who had come in hadn't asked her permission so she stopped being angry at me fairly quickly. She takes samples from me all the time, but she's gentle and explains as she does it. The man had tried to use force, that's what had scared me. \"Hey, sweet boy. How are you today?\" I chirp in delight as she rubs my head. Elsa doesn't come as often as Kris does, which makes me happy. Kris is always patient with me and kind. I rarely see her get upset or angry. I can't say the same for Elsa... I now have arms. They're slender, but strong and Kris gently takes my hand as she looks at one. I quietly fold my legs beneath me, like a bird, as I wait for her to finish. She prods the skin and lightly pinches, but her eyes are constantly checking for signs of pain. Kris rarely hurts me and it's never on purpose so I smile and wait. Finally, she finishes and talks into her earpiece in a hushed tone before turning back to me. \"Good boy, Beast.\" I coo happily and she smiles. Kris has such a beautiful smile. I love to see it. \"You've been a very good boy lately, actually. I should figure out some kind of reward...\" I hurriedly shake my head and grab my pad and pencil. They give me all kinds of things to use for writing, but these are my favorite. Kris watches as I write and I show her what I've written. My writing is sloppy and crooked, but she knows what I write. 'Don't have to.' \"Oh?\" She seems surprised. \"Why not Beast?\" I scribble on my pad some more and show her. 'You treat me nice. That reward.' She smiles, which makes me smile. \"Oh, Beast...\" She rubs my head again and I coo. \"You're such a sweet little boy... Now, come on. Sweet or not, you have class.\" I stand and hurry after her as she walks to the dry erase board that takes up a good chunk of the wall. It's what we use for class so I know she's going to be my teacher for a while now, not my playmate, but that's okay with me. As long as she's here, I'm happy. Elsa POV I watch as Kris teaches Beast some mundane lessons. We teach him things so he feels like he's aiming for some kind of goal, but in reality he'll use the bare minimum of what Kris teaches him. It alarms me how at ease around him she is. She treats him like a human boy. She treats him like he's her son. Ridiculous. Attachment shows weakness. I was attached to Clive and he wanted a child. Look where that child got us! Still...I quietly observe the way Kris is with Beast. She is gentle and all her movements lack any sense of hostility. It does well for Beast's growth to be treated so tenderly...but, alas, I worry. Lately, Kris seems...hesitant, to take samples from Beast and to run tests, even harmless ones. She says they violate him and other preposterous notions. I need to do something about this. She needs to realize he's simply a specimen, an experiment to run tests on. And I think I know just how to do that... Kris POV I stand and stretch. It's been a long day, but I don't mind. Beast is always so attentive and he learns so quickly. I'd spend all my days with him if I could... A soft mewing sound near my thigh distracts me. Beast tilts his head, watching me with curious eyes. \"What is it, Beast?\" He picks up his pad and scribbles for a moment before turning it to show me what he wrote. 'Idea for reward now.' I smile at him warmly. \"Yes, dear?\" Beast writes some more and shows me once again. 'A story.' \"A story?\" He nods. I suppose that makes sense. Everything I teach him and do for him is logical and rational. It all has a purpose. A story would probably be a nice change for him. \"Alright. How about when I visit tomorrow I'll bring a storybook? It'll have nice pictures for you to see.\" He immediately smiles and claps his hands, making excited chirping noises. It's rather amusing seeing Beast get worked up over something like this. I can't wait to bring him the book tomorrow... \"I brought your treat, Beast!\" He sticks his head out of his hammock and his eyes light up. Beast enjoys climbing so I thought a hammock would be fun for him to sleep in. Before he got as big as he is now, but when he had grown too big for his cat tower, he wasn't balanced enough and the hammock was too difficult for him to climb into. I had been at the pet store a few days later looking for ideas for climbing structures for Beast, and had paused to look at the various animals. The ferrets particularly amused me. They were curled up in a furry heap in a hammock like bed. It was a large square with rope attached to each corner that made it hang from the ceiling. As soon as I got back to the lab, I proposed my idea to Elsa. She seems to enjoy my initiative and imagination and liked the idea. By the end of the week, Beast had his new bed and loved it. It was this bed that he now poked his head out of and smiled at me from. I wave a thin picture book in one hand and he jumps out of his hammock, running over to me and jumping up and down excitedly. Naturally, we are observed at all times so I have to teach him his lessons first, but we finish quicker than usual and I sit cross legged to read Beast his story. To my surprise, he climbs into my lap, looking at the book. I know I'm being watched...I know I should move Beast from my lap and chastise him for this... Hell, Elsa would probably give me a gold star if I slapped him and walked out. Yet, when he turns and looks at me expectantly, all I can do is open the book and begin to read. \"This story is called Something to Fight For. Once there was a little boy who didn't like to stand up for himself. Everyone pushed him around and told him what to do. He went through life doing what he was told...never questioning anyone. Then one day, a bunch of kids were mean to a girl on the playground. She started to cry, but they were still mean to her. He ran over and stood up for her, helping her. The two of them became best friends. They grew older and had kids of their own. One night, his son asked him if it was ever okay to be mean to people. His father told him it was never right to be mean to people. His son then asked if that meant he should be quiet if someone was mean. The boy's father ruffled his son's hair and told him that he shouldn't do that if it was something worth fighting for, like family and the son was quiet for a while. Finally, he looked at his father and told him he was worth fighting for. His father hugged him close and said he was worth fighting for too. The...End...\" Beast is quiet then snatches up his pad and I watch over his shoulder. 'You worth fighting for.' He turns and smiles at me. \"As are you, Beast...as are you...\" I'm nearly overcome with the desire to kiss his forehead. Odd. Well, not really. He is like a child to me after all. Why does he have to be Elsa's child...? Elsa POV I walk to the bathroom calmly and wash the blood from my hands. I had been so angry, so very angry. My nails had bit into my hands, leaving small smears of blood. Watching Kris treat Beast like he was her child... The audacity of that little bitch... Well, the time has come to teach her a lesson about this...Beast needs to learn one as well... Today, Kris walks in right on time. She's always early for her shifts with Beast. I smile as I go over a graph nearby. She glances in through the window as she heads for the door to Beast's chamber and pauses when she sees he's not in there. I feel a thrill of delight as I watch the happy smile slip off her face and her hand pause above the doorknob. There's soft footsteps behind me and I wait a moment before making an irritated sigh and turning. She looks at me worriedly over her glasses. Inside, I sneer. Kris never shows her emotions except with Beast so I know she is truly worried. \"What is it Kris? I'm rather busy.\" There's an catch in my voice, but it could be misconstrued as irritation instead of excitement so it fits perfectly. \"Umm...Ma'am...where is Beast?\" \"He's clearly just hiding.\" \"No, Ms. Kast. He knows when I come to teach him. He's not in there. Something's wrong...\" \"Oh...that's right.\" I tap my chin as if I only just recalled something. \"Naturally, he wouldn't be in there today.\" I quickly turn back to the computer I'm at so that she can't see the grin spread across my face. There's a long pause and then she quietly speaks, careful and precise. \"...then where is he?\" \"Oh? Didn't you get the notice? He's going through experiments for the next week.\" I spin in my chair, legs crossed and one hand tapping the chair's arm. \"Frankly, I think the timing is ideal. His growth has slowed at adolescence, unlike Dren. We don't know if this is the rate his growth will now progress or if it's a temporary speed alteration, but either way now is an excellent time to act.\" I watch various emotions battle it out in her eyes, but after just a moment she goes back to being calm and collected. \"I concur and as Beast's co-handler, I would like to supervise or at least observe these experiments.\" My eyes scan her face for weakness and I find none so I give her the answer I know will make her blood run cold. \"No.\" She opens her mouth to foolishly argue so I continue. \"There is no purpose. They are operating under my direct orders. They will do as I say. I will notify you when Beast is back in his cell and when you should continue your teachings. Until then, you are dismissed.\" I spin back around and after a few moments there's soft footsteps and the door opens and closes. Ahhh...this will be entertaining... Kris POV I throw open the front door and close it with a dull thud. A happy voice calls from the kitchen. \"Well, someone's early! I started dinner, but it will still be a while before it's done.\" I glance in the kitchen where Jessie is making food. Her wavy red hair is pulled up in a thick clip as she bustles around. \"I'm making your favorite! Chicken parmesan!\" She grins then frowns as she takes me in. \"Hey...what's wrong...?\" I just shake my head. \"I'm sorry. I'm just not hungry. . I...I didn't feel well so I left work early. Now I think I'm going to go shower...\" Hurriedly, I move from the doorway up the stairs. I grab my towel and robe and dart in the bathroom. Jess and I have been together nearly five years now...she'll be able to tell something is wrong. The water rushes from the shower head in an icy burst. I stand under the water numbly for a minute and then the tears come. Goosebumps raise all over my body, but my cheeks grow hot as the tears race down them. I slide to my knees, slouched on the shower floor as I cry. My hands cover my face as my crying turns to full on sobbing. What Beast must be going through...I can only imagine. Elsa treats him like any old experiment, but he's like a human child. It'll be like torture for him! The door creaks open and I hear footsteps, then the shower curtain is pulled back enough for Jess to poke her head in. As soon as she sees me, she turns the water off and pulls the curtain back all the way. I feel the soft towel wrapped around me and she pulls me out of the shower to beside her on the bathroom floor. I sob into her shoulder and she holds me close, rubbing my back until I run out of tears. \"Hey...now will you tell me what's wrong...? Because something is definitely wrong.\" I sniffle against her shirt. \"It's complicated...\" Her fingers guide my chin up to face her and she smiles at me kindly, then lightly brushes her lips against mine. \"Then why don't you get into some dry clothes and we'll discuss it for as long as it takes, okay?\" I nod and she guides me to our room. Once she sees me looking though my clothes she heads out to get us drinks. It's then that it finally comes to me: today is our anniversary. That's why she was making me my favorite food. I instantly feel awful, but it's the way Jess is, no matter how much she was looking forward to this evening, she wants me to be happy and get things off my chest. I'll have to make it up to her...but first I need to talk to her abut Beast. Maybe she can think of something...at the very least she can listen. I head down to my waiting wife, ready to share what's wrong this time. So what'd you guys think? Too many perspective changes? Too confusing? Hope you guys lied it! As always please review and hopefully I'll be quicker to update for chapter 4. Sorry again! ","Summary":" Day 1: Birth Beast POV It's warm in here...and wet. I hear voices, but they're muffled.

Yes I am back with 1 more chapter for you guys. I was inspired by it when I was in the shower (don't think negative) and as soon as I put some clothes on I went to my computer and started typing this. So here is my poem entitled 'What are rags' (this title isn't that good I know it was a short notice poem.) any ways here we go. Disclaimer: only thing I own is this poem but not the movie in which it twas based on (did I just type in twas? Wow I really need to get out more) My people take from there native home. All they had where the rags they owned. But they used those rags and made themselves into something great. You know most of the music we have now is based off of a music called rag time. Oh yes indeed rag music then evolved into Jazz, then R&B;, then Hip hop, to Rap. My people took there rags and made them into something beautiful. They revolutionized a lot of things. With out the people who had to struggle we wouldn't have our freedom or our very first African American president. So why don't we all turn our rags into something good so that the people of the future base things off of your decisions. I hope you liked it even if you are not African American. And yes I know it is kind of hastily put together and it is not that inspirational. But I hope you did learn something new and I hope this helped you.

I absolutely loved the movie Rags and had some inspiration. Enjoy! I don't own Rags or it's characters. Only my OC. Enjoy! Chapter 1: Choices, Destiny, & Dead Parents You make your own choices. My mom always told me. You choose your destiny and the path you will take. My dad would always say. Well, honestly, those two phrases were just a bunch of garbage. Don't get me wrong. I loved my parents very much. Notice how I said loved. That's right. Both my parents are gone. They both died of a rare disease that no one claimed they could cure. The doctors gave us two weeks to say our final goodbyes to each other. Forever. \"Don't worry sweetie.\" my mom started. \"Daddy and I are going to heaven. You know? Like Granny did when she passed? We're going to get to see her again.\" my mother would always finish. The problem wasn't that they were dying. It was how I was going to through life and get by without them. They were my support. I already knew they were going to a peaceful place thanks to weekly Sunday School visits at church. I just didn't know where I was going yet. And it scared the crap out of me. I mean, it's common sense. When you're 9 years old and your parents are about to leave you for good, you tend to get scared. I'm sorry for being so rude. This is too hard to talk about. Anyways, back to my story. 2 weeks later… The funeral was beautiful. Flowers of every kind everywhere. They were from mom's favorite florist, Florist France. The shop was named after Florence France because most of the flowers in there was Italian. It's supposed to be funny, but I don't find it that funny. My mother and father were dressed in the most fancy outfits I had ever seen them in. Mom was wearing a elegant black and white dress with a little white tulip laying beside where her head rested. It made sense. Tulips, especially white ones, were her favorite flower ever. Dad was wearing a fancy black and white suit with a tie and also had a white tulip by his head. I guess this was supposed to represent their love for each other, how the tulip represented their eternal love and bond. They both also had the hands crossed on their chest. They looked so peaceful now. The service lasted 2 hours. I cried the whole time. My relatives comforted me and told me it was going to be okay. My aunt Lisa and uncle Bobby told me that they would be taking care of me now. I cried more. I HATED those two. They made my life miserable. I then hated my parents. I hated them for leaving their 9 year old daughter behind. I hated them for leaving me with my aunt and uncle who hated me back. I just wanted to die along with them. Why would they leave me like this? I had to suck it up though. I didn't hate my parents. I was grieving. My aunt and uncle promised them before I was born that if something ever happened to them, that they would take me in and take care of me. Get me through middle and high school. Pay for college if I couldn't obtain a scholarship. They promised my parents and, in honor of their memory, planned to keep that promise. How could I hate them for that? So what did you guys think? Let me know through reviews and PMs! Thanks![Chapter 2] Disclaimer I don't own Rags or its characters. Only Natalie. It was a chilly fall Sunday evening and I was once again digging through garbage trying to find something decent to eat. How can I live like this? I yell silently in my head. Just like all the other times, I come up with nada to eat. Then, after I give up, my stomach growls indicating that I'm hungry. \"Shut up, I know you're hungry. I'm trying here.\" I say while noticing that some local New Yorkers walking by staring. \"Take a picture. It will last longer!\" I yell to them as the quickly scurry. I sit down with my stomach growling like the lion king. What I would do to get some food. ~Charlie's POV~ I never expected to run into her. She was just…there. That girl, that homeless teen girl sitting on the side of the street passed out with her stomach growling, she looked hungry. She looked tired and cold and scared. I look to my left and noticed that piles and piles of trash are dug out of the restaurant's garbage can. She was digging in the garbage? Just to find something to eat. I decide to go over and see how, if any, I can help her. \"Umm…excuse me.\" I say while poking her. She remains silent and her eyes remain closed. \"Do you want me to buy you dinner?\" I offer while her eyes still remain close and she doesn't move a muscle. \"Wait…are you okay? Hello?\" I rant. She wasn't responding or moving. It was like she was almost…oh God. I dig into my backpack searching for my cell phone. I dial 911. \"Hello 911. What's your emergency?\" says the operator on the other line. \"Uh yes. I have a homeless teen orphan here and I asked if she wanted any food because she was hungry but when I asked and asked and even eventually poked and shook her, she didn't respond at all. She wouldn't talk, open her eyes, move, nothing!\" I am practically screaming into the phone now out of panic. \"Sir just calm down. Where are you?\" the operator asks. I give her our location and about 2 minutes later the paramedics show up. I stop the paramedic concerned for the girl. \"We don't know her current health state. By the way she's dressed and how skinny she is, it doesn't look good. She'll be at the Manhattan Mercy Hospital if you want to see her later.\" the paramedic rants in one breath. I nod in understanding and the medics rush her away to the hospital. Kadee and I outta go see her later. I think quietly while running home. ~Natalie's POV~ I wake up not knowing where the heck I was. My eyes flutter open and all I see are lights. Bright lights. Am I dead? Can I see mom and dad now? I think just as a doctor comes in rejecting my previous though. \"So Natalie Cooke. How are you feeling?\" she asks. I sit up slowly. \"I-I…\" I stutter. I finally spit it out. \"I'm fine. Just sore.\" I answer while finally noticing while my arm hurts like crap. There was an IV attached to it. \"You were found by a young man in an alley totally dehydrated and malnourished. He called 911 and brought you here.\" the doctor answers my thoughts. \"Really? Did you get the guy's name so I can find him and thank him?\" I ask. \"You don't have to do that.\" says a teen boy as he walks through the door of my hospital room. I couldn't believe my eyes. It was him. ~Charlie's POV~ \"You don't have to do that.\" I say entering Natalie's room. The doctors did a DNA test and found her birth certificate. Her name was Natalie Cooke and she is 14 years old. Her parents passed away from a untreatable disease and left her a orphan. She lived with a foster family but ran away because of alleged child abuse claims. She has lived the rest of her life up to now in the streets wondering when her next meal is going to be. As I walk over to her, she looks shocked to see me. \"You're…you're…\" she stutters a moment. \"Charlie Prince?\" I say answering her question. She nods and looks like she is about to either scream or wet her pants. My lucky guess was scream. \"OH MY GOD! CHARLIE PRINCE! IS THAT REALLY YOU?! I'M A HUGE FAN! I LOVE YOU!\" she screams as she suddenly claps her hands over her mouth after the last word. Her face becomes a tomato red. She looks down totally embarrassed. \"Sorry. I sound like a crazed fan girl now. I wouldn't blame you if you just ran out of the room expecting me to chase after you.\" she says ashamed. I felt kind of bad. \"It's cool. Really. You okay?\" I inquire. She looks up with surprise like I wasn't going to ever ask her that. She nods and says \"I am now.\" with a huge smile on her face. I can't help but smile too. ~Natalie's POV~ \"Thanks Dr. Grayson. Natalie and I would like to leave now. Mr. Worth said he would pay you guys later, if it was okay.\" Charlie informs Dr. Grayson. She nods and leads me to the bathroom so I could change into my new clothes courtesy of Charlie and the hospital themselves. After signing discharge papers, we leave. I ask Charlie the question I have been wondering for a while now. \"Where are we going?\" I interrogate. He just chuckles and smiles. \"You'll see. You'll like it.\" he simply answers.

She knows it silly – she's 17, really, too old to be thinking these things. But she can't help it. It's because of the water. She feels at home there – she feels free. It hasn't always been this way. She used to feel at home at home – she used to feel free with her family. When Ben was here. When her brother was still alive. Oh, she loved the water back then too, but not as much as she loved it when Ben and Dad and Mom cheered her on from the stands as she swum – when they smiled those special proud smiles when she won. But Ben is gone now. One day he was here and the next day a stern-looking policeman stood in the door and Mari was told to ' Please! Go to your room' . Instead she stood hidden behind the wall at the top of the stairs and she could hear Mom cry and cry as if she would never stop. Something broke inside of them that day – Dad and Mom, and Mari too. It was like big cracks appeared inside and it began feeling empty and hollow. But a week later Mari jumped back in the water again and suddenly she didn't feel so empty. The water seeped into the cracks and filled them, and though it didn't feel the same as when Ben was here, it didn't feel empty anymore either. Especially when she began swimming again, putting all her energy into every stroke, swimming until she could barely move and even then not stopping. With her head under the water and her arms and legs working and her thoughts on her breathing she can almost hear them cheering her on – Dad and Mom… And Ben. \"Go for the gold!\" But only Mom is here now. And she's not cheering. She's barely smiling and Mari knows that she hasn't filled her emptiness with water. She's looking for something else to make her whole and Mari has a feeling that Mom thinks she can find it here with her but Mari doesn't know how – or if she can even help. Dad didn't have the water to fill the cracks in him either. He's not a swimmer, he's a doctor, and there's no water in a hospital to make you whole – only blood. Blood from patients, from the dying and dead and the ones you save but they'll die too one day. It's not enough. It's not enough for Mom either. She's decided to go on vacation. And she's taking Dad and Mari with her whether they want to or not (they don't really, but they go anyways because Mom is sad and cracked and empty and it makes them both feel guilty). It's going to be tough for Dad, Mari knows. There're no patients or blood to fill the cracks in the lake house. At least she'll be able to swim and wish and pretend that she's free and that it doesn't hurt that Ben is dead. That she isn't broken and sad and alone. That she's a mermaid and that she'll never have to come out of the water again. At least Mari will have the water. ","Summary":" Mermaid Mari sometimes wishes she's a mermaid.

They grabed her and dragged her into the shadowed alley. She tried to tell them to stop. She tried to call for help. But she just didn't had enough strength, she just cried and let them do whatever they wanted, hoping and praying that they will stop befor they killed her. Just when the morning sun rose they stopped. She had no more power, no more hope, she felt herself sink deeper and deeper into herself, into the darkness of her mind, where nothing and nobody could ever hurt her. Some people that passed by the alley heard her sobs, and found her and called an ambulance. Now , 2 years later, she just pretends that everyting is alright, that she passed over her trauma. Everytime someone asks her about what happened she just smiles(a fake smile) and simply replies that \"I'm alright\". She never tells them that she still can't look at herself in the mirror. She never tells them about the nightmares. And she never goes out after 7p.m. Statue X and Club Vam are just some names that I put because I had no other idea. It would have been weird to name them statue X and Club Y… ","Summary":" About a girl that get's raped… She's laying on the bed, with a book in her hands trying to remember"},{"Movie":"Rags","Title":"Charlie's Childhood Drabbles","Author":"ZevieObsessed2012","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8228248","Passage":"[Chapter 1] A/N: Hey, lovelies! Most of you know me for my How to Rock fics! :) Anyway, I thought I'd try something new! RAGS! :D Hope you guys like it! These are only drabbles! It kind of works it's way through Charlie's childhood! Disclaimer: I WISH I owned Rags. He's seven. 'Cause you know I'd walk a thousand mile so I could just see you... tonight! Mrs. Prince sang. Charlie, her only son, was scrubbing down the counters of the restaurant listening to his mother sing. The bell on the door rings as someone enters the restaurant. It's Charlie's mother's husband-to-be, Arthur. Charlie scowls as the man who's replacing his father kisses his mother's cheek. She laughs and tells Charlie to just leave the cleaning stuff for later and go play in his room. Charlie, scowling, walks up to his room and slams his door. It's not fair is father walked out before he was born. It's not fair that he doesn't have what all those other kids have. All those other kids at school have nice things, cool clothes, and both parents. Why can't I have that? Charlie thinks. RAGSRAGSRAGSRAGS He's eight. Charlie kicks his feets as he sits in the waiting room. He's trying not to cry. His mother told him to be brave. She said she'd be okay. He just has to believe it. You're supposed to believe everything your parents tell you, and if they say they'll be fine... well, they have to be right! Right? A nurse comes out and grabs Charlie's hand. \"Your mother would like to see you,\" she says. Charlie nods and follows the nurse down a long corridor past the big, heavy blue doors. \"She's in there,\" the nurse says, pointing to a door of light wood with a small window. Charlie looks up at the nurse, not sure exactly why she's just walking away. He looks back at the door, and pushes it open. His mother's lying on the hospital bed, just waiting for him to come closer. He shuts the door and walks toward his mother. \"Charlie,\" she says, her voice hoarse from coughing so much the last year. She runs her fingers through his hair and he just watches her face. \"You know I love you, right?\" she says. Charlie nods. He doesn't know what to say... mostly because he doesn't know what to make of the situation. Arthur pulled him out of school in the middle of his teacher's lesson and drove him here. \"You'll be okay though...\" Charlie says. \"You told me you would.\" His mother gives him a sad smile and says, \"Well... sometimes people are wrong,\" she says slowly. \"But you aren't,\" Charlie says, defiantly. Stubborn, like all eight-year-old children. \"No, baby... sometimes mommy's wrong, too,\" she answers, watching as the sure expression on his face falters. Charlie doesn't really understand what she's saying. \"What do you mean?\" he asks, stepping back from the bed. \"I mean, Mommy isn't okay. She hasn't been... do you understand?\" she says slowly, feeling horribly awful inside. Charlie shakes his head. \"Mommy's gonna have to leave... soon...\" she says, tears falling down her face. \"Where are you going to go?\" \"Mommy's going away...\" \"But you'll come back?\" Charlie says, trying to keep the hope that's left inside of him. The hope that's quickly slipping away. He doesn't understand this new feeling, but he knows he doesn't like it. His voice cracks a bit with a small sob. She shakes her head and pulls Charlie toward her. She cries into his shoulder, and Charlie forces back anymore of his sobs, but his mother crying is one of the saddest things he's ever known, and so he cries too. A nurse comes to collect him as one of the doctors comes in to check on his mother. He kicks and screams and cries... but they get him out of the room and give him to Reginald who's come back to the hospital to wait. RAGSRAGSRAGSRAGS He's eleven. \"I'll be bringing it in later. My stepson, Charlie, and I will be back,\" Arthur says to Pawn Shop owner. Charlie stands by Arthur's side, pouting. He loves the piano his mother always played. But now Arthur's just going to sell it for a stupid karaoke machine. \"Is this Charlie?\" the Pawn Shop owner asks, pointing to the little boy hiding behind Arthur with a pout on his face. Charlie looks up a second as the man comes around from behind the counter and backs up. \"Stubborn little fella,\" the man comments, shaking his head and laughing a little. Charlie just scowls, failing to see what is apparently funny about the current situation. Arthur grabs behind him Charlie's arm and pulls him forward. Charlie bites back a snide comment and looks up the owner. \"Looks like her a bit,\" Arthur says, trying to seem like he actually cares about anything concerning Charlie. Which is a lie. Arthur doesn't care. Charlie can even quote, \"You're mother died and left me with you and this dump of a restaurant.\" Truthfully, this peeved Charlie off like you wouldn't believe. \"Yeah, I see it,\" the owner says. He goes back behind the counter and into the back room. As he's out of sight, Arthur elbows Charlie in the ribs. He holds in a grunt and walks away to look around the store. He looks at the old objects hanging on the walls and the things people don't want anymore littering the shelves. \"Charlie! Let's go!\" Arthur calls, leaving the store. As Charlie walks to the door, the owner, Bernie his name is, says, \"Charlie!\" Charlie stops in his tracks and turns to face the owner. He shrugs his shoulders with the impatient look of \"Yeah?\" on his face. \"I know how much you want that piano to stay. Tell you what; if you can come up with the money—doesn't matter when... I'll hold the piano until you can afford it,\" the owner says. And for the first time in a long time, Charlie smiles. He nods his head and leaves the store. RAGSRAGSRAGSRAGS He's thirteen. \"You can't do anything right, can you?\" Arthur yells. \"As long as this place has my name on that deed, Charlie... you work for me,\" he storms, tossing a rag down on the counter. Arthur hated The Palace. In fact, given the chance, he'd sell the \"dump\" in a heartbeat. Charlie glares at the man who's replaced both his mother and father. He takes a deep breath and does something he's wanted to do for a long time. He talks back. \" Says who? \" Arthur steps closer to the boy and slams his palm across Charlie's face. He stumbles backward, nursing his cheek and now split lip. Biting his tongue until it draws blood, he runs up to his room. Arthur follows him and halfway up the stairs he grabs Charlie's shirt collar and pulls him all the way upstairs. Stumbling and falling, Charlie tries to break free, or even protest, but Arthur keeps moving. \"Get in there!\" he yells. Charlie runs into his room, still holding his left cheek. Honestly, he feels like throwing up and screaming all at once. This is the first time Arthur's ever laid a hand on him, and the thought makes the contents of his stomach churn. Arthur doesn't seem to have any problem with what had just happened, however. Arthur slams the door closed and locks it from the lock he's placed on the outside of the door. \"Now, I suggest you stay there and make no noise! It should be fairly obvious why you're in there!\" Arthur yells, a small hint of smugness playing at his tone. Charlie takes deeps breaths, trying to make the churning in his stomach stop. He's never been abused before like so, and the idea scares him, but at the same time makes him sick. How could someone, even as bad as Arthur do such an awful thing? Charlie sits down on the bed and grabs an old rag from the night stand. He keeps it for times like these, when he gets hurt. Andrew and Lloyd like to hide the band-aids and such from him. So the rag is all he's really got. Gross really, but sometimes you have to make do with what you've got. His stomach grumbles after a churning's stopped. He listens to make sure Arthur's walked away from the door. He can hear him yelling at his stepbrothers, Lloyd and Andrew, downstairs. Quietly, Charlie slides open the window that used to be locked. He remembers the number of times he sat in his locked room and chipped the lock placed on the window. Anything to get out of that place and clear his thoughts. Anywhere where Arthur is screaming his head off is not the place to do it. Back to the once-locked window, he needed food after all. Charlie lifts the window open and climbs down the drain pipe. There's a fast-food restaurant nearby. He pulls out the money he's earned that's left over and makes his way down the street. It was much easier when you were here mom. RAGSRAGSRAGSRAGS He's fifteen. \"Keep scrubbing,\" Arthur orders. Charlie doesn't reply as he scrubs the counters. It's been almost eight years since Charlie's scrubbed these counters with his mother. \"Scrub harder,\" Arthur demands, his hands on his hips. He's watching over Charlie's shoulder like a hawk. \"I'm scrubbing as much as my hand will let me,\" Charlie retorts. \"What'd you just say to me?\" Arthur yells, probably louder than is really necessary. But he doesn't care, and Charlie's used to this after all. Andrew and Lloyd are laughing in the back of the room, but Charlie ignores them. \"I was just telling you what's true,\" Charlie says smugly, tossing the rag down onto the counter. \"Don't get smart with me, Charlie! This is still my palace,\" Arthur says. \" My name is on that deed, Charlie. Not yours!\" Charlie scoffs. \"I'm going out,\" he says simply, not at all up for an argument with Arthur, or his stepbrothers. \"Hey, maybe he'll finally go missing,\" Andrew laughs, smirking. Lloyd just laughs with his brother, clueless to how cruel both Arthur and Andrew can be. Charlie rolls his eyes and slips on his black leather jacket that's been resting on the back of one of the chairs. \"Curfew's at midnight,\" Arthur yells after him. Charlie doesn't reply as he walks out of the restaurant. I can't wait till I can leave this dump . A/N: And that's it for Charlie's childhood drabbles! :) I hope you enjoyed it and please let me know what you think! :D[Chapter 2] A/N: Okay, so it's literally past midnight and I'm typing this on my iPod. So I apologize in advance for any mistakes, and hopefully you enjoy regardless! :) I really want to continue this story! So, here! Review and let me know what you thought! RAGSRAGSRAGSRAGS He's nine. It's been a little over a year now since Charlie lost his mother. Sometimes realization hits hard. This is one of those times. He sits on the edge of his bed resting his head in his hands. Tears stream down his cheeks, but he doesn't care to wipe them away. Everybody cries. He knows it's normal. And though on numerous occasions Andrew will tease him, along with Lloyd, but cluelessly, (though the boys have no mother themselves), Charlie still cries. But in the privacy of his bedroom. He swings his legs which, at this age, still can't reach the floor yet. He sniffles. That's when an idea hits him. He jumps down from the bed and peeks under it. Underneath it, there's a scrapbook him and his mother had put together ages ago. Or so it felt. He pulls it out, tosses on the bed and jumps into the surface. He wipes the tears off his cheeks and opens the book. Charlie notices the pages are a little crumpled. He remembers the number of times his mother had to push the book forward a little so that his knees would stop crumpling the edges. She'd always laugh whenever it happened. Charlie was always too busy decorating the pages to notice when it happened. And for the remainder of the night, in the privacy of his locked bedroom, Charlie loses himself in the happy memories the photos of the scrapbook harbor. And for once, his tears are of joy. RAGSRAGSRAGSRAGS He's twelve. He's gotten clever at sneaking out of the window his bedroom. After he chipped the lock, of course. Countless hours were wasted on that lock, but for good reasons. As he hops off the city bus, he takes a couple short cut-throughs to Bernie's Pawn Shop. After a couple months that Arthur had sold the piano Charlie's mother once owned, he'd plucked up the courage to ask Charlie for an allowance. Arthur laughed in the little boy's face, but Charlie feigned confidence. He wanted money of his own. He wanted to buy back his mother's piano, and Bernie promised him he'd hold it until Charlie came up with the money. Arthur finally agreed though, but Arthur played favorites. Andrew was his above-all favorite, Lloyd second, and Charlie couldn't even be considered a favorite. So, he had agreed to pay Charlie one-dollar for every chores completed. Charlie found it quite unfair, but he had to start somewhere. And Arthur wouldn't allow the payment go any higher. Charlie knew that much. He walks into the pawn shop with his first payment at-hand. Quite pathetic, he knows, but twenty dollars is a start. He slaps it down onto the counter, grinning a little. He is getting the piano back. No matter how long it takes. \"You got a long way to go, Charlie,\" Bernie's says. Charlie frowns a little. \"But it's a good enough start,\" Bernie says. Charlie looks over at the piano and then back at Bernie. \"I know.\" RAGSRAGSRAGSRAGS He's fourteen. Eighth grade is full of bullies, and Charlie's gotten used to managing his way around them. Well, except Andrew. Lloyd is just the lost, naive puppy. Going along with his brothers schemes, enduring the verbal abuse from his brother that, unfortunately, flies right over his head. Currently, Charlie finds himself trying to keep the money in his pockets. He needs it desperately for the piano. It's his largest payment yet. Fourth-five-dollars and sixty-seven-cents. If Andrew gets a hold of the money, then Charlie has to go back to swiping money off the floors of city-buses and sidewalks. Arthur took away the allowance after Andrew and Lloyd took Charlie's money the first time, and accused him of losing it. Arthur lectured Charlie for more than an hour. Most of the lecture was wasted on the tuned-out, stubborn little boy, and so Charlie doesn't quite remember it all. And sometimes Charlie will play on the streets for by-passers with the ukulele he'd found in a dumpster nearby the Palace. Someone had dumped it there and it was in fixable condition. It just need some string replacements and major tuning, and Charlie had spent weeks working on it. When it was fixed up, he practiced it, enjoying the sounds it made. And so he began to create tunes, and songs. He'd gone through a major voice change around that time, but he sung anyway, and performed normally after school or on his way to the pawn shop. He just has to get by Andrew and Lloyd with the piano money, and everything will be good. RAGSRAGSRAGSRAGS He's sixteen. High school. Not much else to say. But, his payments have become a lot smaller and less frequent. The workload is much too overwhelming for Charlie, but he manages. He knew a long time ago that trying to buy back the piano would become harder and harder. And now that Charlie is waiting on people at the Palace everyday after school for countless hours, without pay, it makes finding time to earn a couple bucks very difficult. So he works for tips from the few customers that come in. The current amount in his pockets is about twenty-two-dollars and seven-cents. Pathetic, he knows. But it's the best he's got. The first chance he gets, with a good amount of payment, he plans to go down to the pawn shop and pay Bernie. Every payment helps. Diego and Martha have been slipping him a couple bucks too, when Arthur isn't around. They know how bad he wants the piano back. But even at the rate he's paying, and the amount he's earning, the piano could take another fifteen years before its his. This doesn't discourage him though. Not at all. RAGSRAGSRAGSRAGS He's seventeen. Charlie's payments are better, now that it's summer and he's off from school. He helps Diego and Martha around the Palace a bit more, since Arthur's been busy trying to teach \"Androyd\" how to put on a good performance. Charlie tunes them out though as he works. At night, once Arthur's locked him into his bedroom until morning, he grabs the songbook from the suitcase packed for when he's legally able to leave his \"guardian,\" and writes the lyrics in his head. Normally, he comes up with them the more Arthur compares him to \"Androyd.\" Other times, his inspiration comes from singing into the handle of the mops and brooms. A guy can dream, can't he? And dreams are meant to come true, that is if you really want them. Who says Charlie can't be the next big thing? \"Someday,\" he constantly tells himself. A/N: So, how was that for a second round? Again, I apologize for any mistakes! It's midnight, and I'm on my iPod.[Chapter 3] A/N: Hello loves! Thank you all so much for your lovely reviews! You're all so sweet! I've decided to continue writing drabbles, so I hope you continue to read and enjoy them! He's eleven. How could you leave the Palace to Arthur? He thinks bitterly, as if his mother could hear him-maybe she could? He couldn't hate his mother for something as silly as a deed though. After all, how many eleven year olds actually had a deed in their name? \"You done with the chores yet?\" Arthur called from his office. Startled, Charlie tripped over the bucket of soapy, grimy mud water. There was an angry sigh from the office, and next thing Charlie new, Arthur stood before him. He grabbed Charlie by the collar of his sweatshirt and pulled him up roughly to his feet. \"Look what you did now!\" Charlie didn't bother listening. It was the same thing all the time. \"Clean it up now. We open in twenty.\" Releasing Charlie's sweatshirt, Arthur stormed off back to his office to continue sorting papers from bills and paychecks. RAGSRAGSRAGSRAGS He's fifteen. Charlie was finally in high school, and although he probably should've been excited, he wasn't. Andrew and Lloyd were in the grade above him, so of course, his first day consisted of his step-brothers slamming his locker door on his fingers, or sticking their legs in front of his so that as he walked through the halls, he tripped and fell. His backpack tore, but it wasn't new or anything. Arthur tossed him some old clothes and shoes of Andrew's and Lloyd's, and the backpack was hand-me-down too. Even as some of the girls had given him shy glances, Andrew managed to make him look like a freak. Lloyd didn't help make things better either. This was only the first day. Charlie could only imagine the next three years of his high school experience. RAGSRAGSRAGSRAGS He's sixteen. Finally, Arthur had extended his curfew to midnight. This gave him more time to do what he wanted to. Charlie was on his very first date with a girl named Alexis. She had long, wavy blonde hair, and sharp features, like cheekbones and jawline. It was eleven-thirty, and Charlie was walking Alexis home. \"I had fun tonight,\" Alexis said, smiling at her shoes-she was too shy to look at Charlie. Her shyness was what attracted Charlie. \"I had fun too,\" he replied. He decided to play her a song, as he kept his ukulele on him at all times. It was like his best friend. Andrew had broken his first ukulele, and he'd given Arthur, Andrew and Lloyd hell for weeks until Arthur had paid him enough money (after hours and hours of chores) to buy a new, better one. \"Maybe we can hang out again sometime,\" he said after a couple minutes of serenading Alexis. Her cheeks were bright red, but the cool, spring night made it difficult to notice. \"I would like that,\" she smiled, straightening her shoulders. They'd arrived at her house at exactly eleven-forty-five, which left Charlie fifteen minutes to get home. He only needed ten. Alexis wasnt the type of girl to kiss someone on her first date-and Charlie was her first date-but the night had been fun, and so, with a quick peck to Charlie's lips, she said goodnight, and went inside her house. Charlie smiled, still feeling her lips on his own. His first kiss had been quick, but sweet, and he was hoping they would all feel like this one. Sweet. He walked home, strumming his ukulele that night, singing the happiest song he knew. A/N: And that is the third set of drabbles of Charlie's childhood!

But, if you guys PROMISE not to freak out, I'll come out.\" \"We... we promise!\" shouted Kadee before anyone could object. As if on cue, a girl stepped out from around the corner. She was around five foot something, had shoulder length brown hair, brown eyes and looked like she was in her early teens. She was wearing black pants, a shirt that had a row of super heroes and the words 'Young Justice' on it, blue and purple running shoes, a bronze bracelet and a necklace with a clock and a mini bottle on the chain with a label reading 'Drink Me' on it. \"I am JewelStruck.\" the girl claims with an over dramatic bow. \"Well, kid-\" \"JewelStruck.\" the girl- JewelStruck, corrects. \"-JewelStruck.

He thought they were brought here to show Android to Mr. Worth. \"Yep.\" \"Will there be snacks?!\" asked Lloyd excitedly, causing many eye rolls. \"Yep. Just for you.

Okay... Sammi, Tammy and... Lloyd... You three take the blue and black couch...\" The did, with Tammy in the middle, Lloyd on the right and Sammi on the left. \"Uh... Diego and Martha... take the orange love seat please...\" They did, and it was surprisingly comfortable. \"Hmm... Mr. Worth, Erma, Finn... see those three black, leather arm chairs?\" they nodded, \"THOSE are for you guys.\" They sat down, Erma babbling about how it was so cool that Mr. Worth and her got the same type of chair. JewelStruck rolled her eyes, wondering if sitting her near him was a bad idea or not. \"Alrighty then...uhh... Andrew, Arthur! That grey mini-couch is for you two!\" They grumbled and sat down. \"Shawn! That dark blue swivel chair is for you...\" \"Great, thanks.\" he said happily hopping into the rolling chair. \"Hmm... Kadee... you can have that chaise longue.\" JewelStruck instructed, pointing to a purple chaise longue. \"Uh, thanks. It's nice.\" \"Glad you like it. And last but not least, Charlie, that recliner is for you.\" \"Sweet! Thanks!\" he said hopping into the plush seat. \"Notice how these three are the only ones who said 'Thank You'?\" JewelStruck grinned, gesturing to Shawn, Kadee and Charlie. \"So, what movie are we watching? And why US. We are VERY busy you know.\" growled Arthur, ignoring the teen. \"Well, first off: RUDE! And second: It's not exactly a movie.\" she said smugly. \"What do you mean?\" asked Tammy. \"This is what happens over the next few days. Few days in YOUR lives. It's kind of... Cinderella... but with a twist.\" JewelStruck explained. Everyone automatically had the same idea. Kadee was obviously going to be 'Cinderella' and Finn would obviously be 'Prince Charming'. JewelStruck grinned. She knew what they were thinking... my, my, my... wouldn't they be surprised... And then what she said REALLY kicked in. \"WAIT! THE FUTURE!?\" shouted everyone. \"Yep.\" \"How would you know the future?\" \"Oh. Well, in my dimension, you're all just a really underrated movie...OH!\" broke off JewelStruck unexpectedly, before running off. She came back with popcorn, two water bottles and two aero bars. \"Here you go.\" she said, handing Lloyd the popcorn, and one of each of the other two things. \"Thanks!\" he grinned, before he began to eat. JewelStruck grinned hopping into her own neon orange/green chair and calling Trumpet to sit beside her. \"Now, without further ado, I present to you the movie... 'Rags'.\" A/N: Hi! Hope you enjoyed the first chapter! I love suggestions, I love reviews and I even love CONSTRUCTIVE criticism! If you like this please let me know. More reviews = Sooner updates! Until Next Time! Au Revoir![Chapter 2] Disclaimer: I don't own Rags. (The actual movie will be in bold) As the movie started, Charlie, Martha and Diego were wondering what they could possibly be doing over the next few days that would bring them into the same movie as Kadee Worth, while Arthur and Andrew simply thought that Android would FINALLY take off. The movie opened onto a good look at New York City. Swirly golden letters spell out RAGS. Shawn (Voice Over): New York City... \"Hey! That's my voice!\" says Shawn, shocked. Everyone's eyes widened, how was this possible?! The camera alternates shots between buildings , bridges and packed streets. Shawn(VO): Not a land far far away, but still one of the most magical cities in the world... It's streets buzzing with people and buildings that seem to go on forever... The shot closes in on a skateboarder holding onto a car to pick up speed and just making it onto the street. \"Charlie! Isn't that you?\" asked Martha, recognizing the tiny guitar on his back. \"Yeah... I think it is...\" he murmurs, confused. \"Well then... WHAT WERE YOU THINKING YOU ALMOST GOT HIT BY THAT CAR!\" she shouted. \"AHEM! You can scold him later.\" whispered JewelStruck. Shawn(VO): It's the kind of place where fairytales seem to be possible, no matter who you are. Closes in on the skateboarder dodging people and moving as fast as we can. Charlie: Sorry! 'Scuse me! Sorry 'bout that! Shawn(VO): This isn't one of your typical Cinderella stories. There's no pumpkin, no mice, no Cinderella. Everyone is confused. How could this be a 'Cinderella Story' without a Cinderella? Shawn(VO): Or at least... not the one you're used to. Meet Charlie. The skateboarder stops and looks a little farther right then the camera. It's definitely Charlie. \"Woah, whoa, whoa, whoa! Wait a minute! Is this thing saying that I'm Cinderella?\" Charlie asked, disbelievingly. \"Yep. Now shush up and watch!\" snickered JewelStruck. Charlie sunk into his chair as snickers sounded around the room. Shawn(VO): He was young when he lost his Mom... All chuckles stop immediately. Charlie winces at the mention of his Mom... he missed her so much... Kadee noticed as 'Cinderella' guy winced. She understood... her mom had died when she was little, too. The setting changes to a dark room, Arthur is staring directly into the camera, behind him are two identical blonde boys wearing red. One is smiling, and the other looks down disdainfully. Shawn(VO): Leaving him with Arthur, his step father. Then there's these two. Charlie's step brothers, who are a little... how do I say this... Annoying. Arthur, Andrew and Lloyd all frown. Arthur and Andrew frown because this is presenting Android badly to Mr. Worth. I mean how DARE that little runt? Lloyd frowns for a different reason. ' I'm annoying?' The camera flips from Charlie writing in a notebook to him being handed a mop. Shawn(VO): Now Charlie's stuck cleaning the place his mom once owned. \"Wow, you know you kind of ARE like Cinderella if you think about it...\" mutters Martha. \" Martha...\" groans Charlie. A record seems to jerk, cutting off the music. Shawn(VO): Wait- wait! The visual switches to a guy break dancing, Charlie cheering him on. Shawn(VO): Before we let our fairytale play out, you should know: Charlie has a talent. \"Ha! The only thing that kid's good for is mopping!\" scoffed Arthur. \"Yeah! Talent? Psshh, in his dreams!\" snapped Andrew. Charlie looks down at his feet while Martha and Diego glare at the two. Shawn(VO): A real gift for music. Charlie: Yo! Come out! Charlie's gathering people's attention for their performance. Charlie(singing): I never doubt my dreams Always live'em out Imma tell the world They gotta hear me out Just gimme one mic So I can scream it loud And I just need someone That I can make proud Cause I can wait for that someday, If that someday it is coming I wanna share my life with someone Who loves me just for me Hey! Hey! I wanna wish up to the stars, I can I wanna see the lights in the crowd, In the stand I see myself there like a dream in the past, (fades out) \"Wow, you're really good! Did you write that yourself?!\" shouts Kadee. \"Uhh... maybe...\" he responds. \"Charlie! How come you never told us you could sing like that?\" asked Diego. Charlie shrugged and turned back to the television. \"Kid, don't brush it off. I think you have a real talent.\" says Mr. Worth. \"Wha- R-really?\" asks Charlie, shocked. Mr. Worth nods and Arthur and Andrew glare. That little nuisance is ruining Android's chances! Shawn walks on screen interested by the performance. Shawn(VO): And this is where I come in. Like I said, this is a fairytale, but with a twist. Charlie continues to sing, camera focuses on the break dancers. Shawn(VO): I'm no Fairy Godmother, but Charlie has a dream. All he needs is someone to hear him... and an open door. A car drives by, hitting a puddle and soaking the spectators. People scream and leave. \"It's just water! Come on, people!\" Charlie shouts in desperation as the spectators AND other performers leave. \"Only you would say that , Charlie.\" Diego chuckles. \"What's that supposed to mean?\" Charlie asks. \"Those people got s oaked by gutter water, and you expect them to stay.\" laughed Martha. \"Well, they weren't SOAKED...\" muttered Charlie. Shawn walks over and places $5 into the bike helmet that had a small amount of money in it. \"Keep it up, man. Next time I see you, it better be on an album cover!\" Shawn says, smiling. Charlie bends over and picks up the helmet. \"Wow... Thank you...\" Charlie says, sounding shocked at the praise. \"Uh... yeah, I have to agree with future me... Thanks.\" Charlie says, a hint of a smile on his lips. \"No problem, Cinderella.\" Shawn grins. Charlie groans at the new nickname. Charlie starts to walk away, \"Who knows,\" Shawn starts, \"maybe one day you'll be as famous as she is.\" Charlie turns to where Shawn's pointing, only to see a bus with Kadee's picture on it, advertising 'Love You, Hate You'. Kadee glares at the advertisement. \"I HIGHLY doubt that.\" Charlie said with a sad laugh. \"Good, cause it'll NEVER happen.\" snapped Arthur angrily. More than a few people glare at him. \"And that's the beauty of this city, you never know what's going to happen next.\" narrates Shawn as Charlie starts skateboarding again. \"Just around the corner could be something amazing,\" The camera zooms in on a magazine with Kadee and Finn on the cover, \"Or some one.\"[Chapter 3] Disclaimer: We've done this before, It isn't really new, I do not own and YOU do not sue. A/N: Sorry I take so long to update, I'm working on that though! No matter what, this story will NOT be abandoned! Don't give up on me! And if you have ANY ideas feel free to send me a PM! Thank you for being so patient and remember, more reviews= faster updates! Enjoy! The shot fades into Kadee dressed all in gold dancing. Electric music plays in the background. Kadee starts to sing. I love you so much, I hate you so bad, Said \"I don't miss you\", You know that's not true, Boy I want you bad, I hate you so much, But I love you oh so bad... Kadee continues to sing, it's obvious that it's for her new music video. Charlie smiles. This is amazing! He's been waiting weeks for the new music video and now he's getting a sneak peak! He glances over to Kadee and his smile falters. She's frowning. He leans over the edge of his chair, so she's within whispering distance. \"Hey, you okay?\" he asks. She gives a weak, unconvincing laugh. \"Yeah, of course. I'm fine.\" she lies. \"Alright... If you want to talk though... I'll listen.\" Charlie offers. He doesn't believe her, but he doesn't want to pry. \"Thanks Charlie...\" Kadee says, with a hint of a real smile. On screen Kadee is still singing. Then I'm calling you again, (Oh Oh) Some days we're on the same page, (Oh Oh) Then we go our sep-our sep- our sep-our sep- \"Is that part of the song?\" asks Lloyd, confused. \"Nope. It's not.\" Tammy said, popping the 'p'. The words continue repeating. \"Wait what?\" \"What's going on?\" \"Huh?\" the background dancers shout, repeating and fumbling through the choreography. \"Cut! Cut!\" the director orders. \"What's wrong with playback?\" the director asks, turning around. The camera pans to Shawn. \"Uh, working on it boss! I- I don't know! This computer decided to have a panic attack or something!\" \"No!\" Shawn whines. \"I thought I fixed it!\" \"Unreal.\" murmurs the director. \"Just give me a minute!\" Shawn calls, fiddling with the machine. \"Alright! Everyone take ten!\" the director shouts through a megaphone. {Bell Rings} Kadee walks off stage, and a huge furry dog comes to greet her. \"Trumpet!\" she shouts happily as the dog barks. \"So, I'm guessing that,\" Charlie begins, pointing at the large dog curled up on 'JewelStruck''s lap, \"is 'Trumpet'.\" \"Yeah, I've had him since he was a puppy.\" she grins, calling the fur ball over. He runs to her immediately. He jumps up on her and Kadee starts laughing. \"Get that dog off my couture!\" shouts Erma, pushing over one or two stagehands. \"Why can't you have a purse-sized dog like all of the other stars, hmm? This horse-dog doesn't fit your image!\" Erma hisses. Kadee glares at screen Erma, Trumpet was part of the family! Kadee was about to defend her choice in canine companions, but the couple on the orange love seat beat her to it. \"Oh come on, the bigger the dog, the bigger the spirit!\" the woman announced with a wide smile. \"Plus, her image is her! She's got a unique dog for a unique singer.\" the man agreed. Kadee can't help smiling, they defended her... the defended Trumpet... They didn't even know us... \"Trumpet doesn't care about my 'image'! He loves the REAL me, and I love him. Isn't that right boy? Isn't that right? Should I rub your belly?\" she glanced up, \"Should I rub Erma's belly?\" \"No one touches my belly.\" she said seriously. Kadee laughs and the movie cuts back to Charlie. \"Alright! Alright! Hold up! Where am I? Apart from a magazine cover I haven't shown up AT ALL.\" growls Finn. \"You'll show up eventually. If you noticed, a LOT of us haven't shown up.\" Sammi said with a huff, mumbling something that sounded suspiciously like 'pain in the neck'. Charlie skateboards to 'The Palace' there are karaoke posters plastered on the walls. He hops off his skateboard and goes inside. \"Wow. 'The palace'? There are SO many hints to you being Cinderella!\" Kadee pointed out laughing. The view changes to someone cutting off the tips of the hot dogs. It pans up, and they see the couple from the orange loveseat working in the restaurant. \"Wow... that's like... REALLY cheap... You're just throwing out good hot dog!\" Tammy scoffs angrily. What a waste! \"Hey, not our idea. Boss makes us.\" he shrugs gesturing to Arthur. \"It's legitimate! People shouldn't get more than what they deserve.\" argued Arthur. Charlie ran up and quickly drummed his hands on the counter. \"Hey!\" Diego greeted. \"Grilled cheese with pickles on rye!\" Martha announced. \"Mmmm! You are the best, Martha! If it weren't for Diego, I would propose to you right now!\" joked Charlie. \"Great, maybe then she'll stop begging me for a bigger ring.\" \"Ha! This guy. He brings me stuff he finds in the street everyday! Why don't you find me a ring in the street? Huh?\" she asked Diego. \"Yeah, and maybe some customers.\" Charlie sighed sadly. \"Well maybe if you weren't a cheapskate on the hotdogs...\" grumbled Tammy. \"GET OVER IT!\" snapped Arthur. \"Customers. That's what we need. You know if your Mom only knew about how Arthur's turned this place into a ghost town... I should do something about it.\" he grumbled, threateningly snipping the end of another hotdog. \"How dare you! I should fire you RIGHT NOW for that!\" shouted Arthur. \"Yeah! He could fire you!\" Andrew agreed. They were ignored. \"Diego's not going to have to do anything, because things are not going to be like this for much longer.\" Charlie stated peaking the two workers' interests. \"Really? Well, Charlie, got a little plan brewing?\" Martha asked excitedly. [Suspenseful music plays] Everyone leans forward a little... \"Nope, I got nothing.\" he sighs. ...and they fall back into their seats. ","Summary":" Disclaimer: Uhhhh, no.

Her mouth is set in a firm line afraid that something would accidently come out… no she was horrified. In the back of her mind she thought she felt something, but no she couldn't every emotion was sucked out of her. Nothing was left, she was… is void of all emotions. Someone must ask her what's wrong. But how can she give a simple answer to such a difficult question; it's like asking why the sky is blue instead of green. Should she say, once upon a time? Or ages ago there was a? So hard to start a good story, but how do you start a terrifying one? Her life as a kid probably is what landed her in this situation. Maybe the fact that her mom was unstable that is why she is in the mess? Or because of that experiment, gone wrong ?[Chapter 2] \"There was him once a upon a time, a man like no other able to love and be loved. He didn't judge anyone especially me. Okay so I haven't gotten a handle yet on telling a story, so what? If you don't want to read THEN DON'T READ IT. Sorry… I just can't take it anymore. \" Elsa tightly closes her eyes unaware of the trail of tears rolling down her pale yet clear face. Her dirty blonde hair in a binding mess and she takes no effort in fixing it. \"I miss HIM do you hear that whoever you are, I miss him.\" She shouts to no one in particular looking at the roof of her family home, or should we call it a nightmare made for paradise. Paradise in the sense that her man; her Clive became close in this house that her mother tortured her in. Her mother how much she hated her, she may have forgiven her a long time ago for all the things... the…the horror she committed against her. But even now she hated that woman, Mrs. Elena Kast with such passion she almost could forgive her father for leaving them at such a young age of barely one years of age. Perhaps this is why her mother lost it? \"Now we are getting somewhere I know where to start my story now.\"[Chapter 3] A/N: none so far. Most people don't remember their childhood much less at the age of ten months. But I do. And I guess at this age everything was has it should have been. Mommy and Daddy were together; therefore all was OK in the world. The big bad monsters under my bed and in my closet could never get me because mommy and daddy were there to keep them away. It's kind of weird, you teach your kids how to count from 1 to 10, or the ABC's before they are one. But I never knew any of that: what I knew was that mommy was called Mrs. Elena Kast, and she sure was beautiful with her blond, shoulder length hair. Her brown eyes often captivated my father always: Billy Kast just your regular average Joe, and he wondered how he caught my mother so to say. My father had shaggy brown hair, and clear blue eyes. These two were inseparable and I thought this would last forever: Daddy, Mommy and me. Flashback (9 months of age) At Home Nine month old Elsa Kast lays in her crib staring up at her parents in glee. She does not much but drools as her father tickles her feet for the umpteenth time. But when her mother joins in on the action, she can't seem to contain the joy so she laughs. \"She looks so beautiful Billy; I have always wondered how you and I created something like that.\" Elena ponders on this. \"She's not as beautiful as you, Elena. And she will never be.\" At this Billy gently strokes his wife's cheek, kisses her goodbye and heads towards their bedroom to catch on some sleep before work tomorrow. \"Goodnight Elsa, don't let the bed bugs bite.\" Elena leaves the Elsa's door wide open in case anything happens, and off to bed she goes where her husband waits. At Work \"SHIT!\" Billy yells as coffee spills on his favorite white shirt, he glares at the culprit only to be stunned into silence. A petite young burnette of 27 appears, \"I'm sorry… I… I didn't mean for that to happen.\" She tries her best to wipe the coffee stain with napkins, only to make it worse. \"Um… if you want I can pay to get you a new shirt?\" \"How about you buy me lunch, instead?\" When Billy utters this ridiculous offer, he knew this was the end of something but he knew not what. Flashback (10 Months of age) In the House \"Where are you off to today, Billy?\" Elena questions as she works on her latest brownie recipe in the kitchen. \"Oh...\" What do I say? \"I'm to work.\" Wow? That ' s a wonderful excuse, especially since I don ' t usually work on Sundays. Elena can't shake off the feeling that something is going on, but she doesn't know what. Therefore she shrugs it off by asking a question, \"But… honey it's a Sunday?\" \"I know… that's what I said. But you know the boss. I'm working for a big law firm, so you would think they would be concerned about my feelings too. You know, help the client out.\" I ' m probably just tired from breastfeeding Elsa. Yep, I bet I just worrying about nothing. \"Ahh… don't worry honey, I didn't mean to stress you out. I was just wondering.\" Mission accomplished… At the Law Firm The brunette asks, \"So, how did you get away from that nagging wife of yours?\" Billy responds with a chuckle, \"She's not that old Allison, she's only 34. Besides I just told her I'm going to work.\" Allison sits across his desk in the office surprised at his revelation. \"I didn't call her old Billy, you did. Which means you might not love her like you say you do.\" Billy doesn't know what to say, he just realized that maybe his pretty brunette is right. Maybe Elena isn ' t right for me anymore. And at the same time, maybe I don ' t want to be a father anymore much less a husband. \"Do you want some coffee?\" Allison offers. \"Sure… Allison I will love to. Just lead the way and I will follow.\" Flashback (11 months of age) At home AHHHHH! Elsa yells at the top of lungs, but her noise is not heard since her two worlds are erupting. Hoping, praying that the screaming from mommy and daddy can just stop. Tears now stream down her red, hot, chubby face and she sucks in air only to yell so more. \"Why, now Billy? Why? What have I ever done to you? What about Elsa? How can you do this… to us, your family?\" Elena screams at the top of lungs. \"Elena, PLEASE?\" Billy pleads with her trying to make Elsa calm down, but to no avail. \"Please, what? You go around buying women coffee, and you pretend as if you are working on a big case, when you are not!\" \"Actually… its only one woman not women and her name is Allison\" I don ' t understand why she is so mad. \"I don't care what her name is; she shouldn't be touching, looking or even thinking about you.\" Elena grabs her head and she feels a killer migraine coming. \"Look, Elena its only coffee. I am not doing anything else with her.\" Not like I am having sex with her, we are just drinking some harmless coffee. \"Billy, you say that now but sooner or later it might be more than coffee. I want you to end it with her.\" \"Really… Elena? You are that paranoid?\" Billy scoffs. \"I'm not paranoid; I'm just scared that I might lose you to someone not even worth your time or effort. We have been together for five years now, please Billie… we can work this out.\" \"Of course… Elena. I will do anything you want.\" \"Thank you…\" Why do I feel like this Allison person has just won t he war? At the Coffee Shop Allison questions, \"You told her that we are over? But you aren't breaking up with me?\" \"Yes… I love you Allison, will you marry me? \" At this, Allison gasps in glee, \"Of course I will, Billy.\" Flashback (12 months= one year old) At Home Elena stares in disbelief at the now empty house. Everything that was Billie's is now gone. Allison that stupid brunette took from me what she shouldn ' t have. \"Promise me, Elsa you will never fall in love.\" Elena whispers to her one year old baby. \"Because all you will find is heartache.\" Tears fall from her eyes, and she gasps for needed air and watches her Billy leave her for a flight attendant. 5 years down the drain … 5 years, but at least I still have you … Elsa to help keep me sane .[Chapter 4] A/N: Sorry I haven't updated this story since a while back, but life doesn't wait for anyone. Please comment on what you think about the story so far. And I thank everyone for their support as well. Since I feel I am actually doing better on this story then the rest of stories like Clones of Sasuke and so on. Which I find so weird, since I dedicate my time to these stories more. Of Dreams, and Hopes The scene opens to reveal Elena crying her heart out for the umpteenth time this month to her best friend, Catherine a.k.a Cathy for short. Elena sits at her kitchen table with her two palms to her face trying to muffle the sound of crying, so she doesn't wake up Elsa again. \"I am so sorry for your loss, Elena. Billy wasn't worth your time and its okay if you didn't get it right the first time.\" Catherine says, \"Besides less than 10% of childhood sweethearts get married, and only 2% of them stay married past the 5 year mark.\" And at this remark Elena cries harder, and her cries wake up 1 ½ year old Elsa. \"What I meant was you are not the only one to get divorced and I am pretty sure you will not be the last. Okay, I'm going to get Elsa because that kid of yours can sure scream her heart out.\" Catherine gets up from in front of Elsa and goes down the hall to put Elsa back to bed again. It's kind of funny, but I can calm Elsa better than I can my own friend? But who am I to tell her when she can stop grieving? That's why I am so happy I have a dog to keep me company. I don't have the time for a man much less a pig. Elena closes her eyes tightly and prays like she has been for the past 6 months that all of this is nothing but a nightmare. That when she opens her eyes Billy is going to come through that oak door begging for her forgiveness. Elena opens her eyes slowly, looks at the oak door Billy built with his hands only to realize that the dream is nothing but that… a dream. Catherine leaves the Elsa's room with a heavy heart. How can I make my friend's life a little bearable? Note to self, if I ever see Billy or even that flight attendant again I will kill both of them with my own bare hands. I have never understood why people get married only to get divorced again that's why I believe there is no such as true love, but people would call me a bad friend if I told Elena that. So I will not burst what bubble she has left. Catherine stands behind Elena's seat and pats her gently on her back.\"It's going to be okay, Elena.\" \"You promise, Cathy?\" Elena sniffles, \"Do you think Billy will see what a tramp she is and come back to me?\" \"One can always hope, Elena.\" False hope that's what I am giving her… false hope. Elena's head slowly turns towards the front oak door once more and she gulps for some needed air begging for her dream to come true.[Chapter 5] A/N- None Life Goes On \"Did you know? Duncan had puppies with the dog next door and they are selling them.\" Catherine says. Elena shrugs her shoulders, \"No I didn't and I do not understand why I should care.\" Catherine looks at Elena long and hard and realizes that her dear friend was and still is going down the drain. Her dreams and hopes vanished to nothingness and she still couldn't figure out how to help Elena. Another six months has past making Elsa 2 years old now, a child without her father and a child slowly losing her mother to insanity. Catherine sighs loudly, \"What I meant is this… I think Elsa should have one of Duncan's puppies for free since he is my dog. What do you say?\" \"If that's what you want, then go ahead and give her a free puppy that you will be taking care of. I know I will not do so.\" \"Elena!\" \"I'm kidding, Cathy. We would love a puppy, especially since Elsa is getting bigger now.\" Elena says rapidly getting up from the kitchen chair. \"Would you like something to eat or drink?\" Catherine looks at Elena weirdly , I have been here for thirty minutes or more and she is now just offering me something to drink? I don't think I can do this anymore… a whole year of grieving over a guy that could care less about you or your daughter isn't worth the tears. \"I met a guy.\" \"The world is coming to an end, right?\" Elena turns to face Catherine, \"You… actually… met… a… guy?\" Elena doesn't say anything for a while, \"we are not talking about the milkman, or the ice cream truck guy, or the post office man from down the block. You're actually going out with a good looking human being with a decent amount of salary to at least put a salad on your table, right?\" \"Yes, John and I have being going out for a year now.\" \"Wait, what?\" Elena glares at Catherine, \"you've been going out with a guy when I have been suffering, what kind of friend are you? How the heck do you get off telling me that I don't need a guy when you off FUCKING one!\" Catherine yells back spittle spraying everywhere, \"Did you just call me out? I have been a very good friend; I have stayed by your side for A WHOLE YEAR. When you needed a shoulder to cry on I lent you mine, when you were behind on your mortgage I gave you the money. When people called you out of your name I beat the shit back into them. When there was no money to get groceries and feed you and your daughter, who was there for you? YOU TELL ME ELENA, WHO? So tell me now, if I wasn't a good friend?\" \"That's not fair… you never even looked at the opposite sex before. Didn't you tell me six months ago that all men are pigs? How could you look into my eyes and tell me that lie?\" \"I did it give you hope and I'm sorry that never was as beautiful as you. So unlike you I was never given the chance to throw away any requests that came my way. You don't know how I envied your position, and now I kind of understand why Billy left. You are a BITCH!\" \"If I'm a bitch, then you're a WHORE! I bet whatever his name is might be going out with you because he couldn't get a better woman like me. I bet he's just settling for you.\" Catherine gulps some spit down, and tears roll down her face. \"You know what? You are right I don't understand why I stood by you and I cannot begin to fathom why I loved you like a sister. Because you never once did anything for me… it was all about you and your life. That's why I didn't tell you for a year because I know you.\" \"Catherine… I … didn't… mean…\" \"No you're right; I have been a horrible friend because I can't seem to get you out of this rut. I understand I might never get to experience what you had with Billy, but that doesn't mean that you to rub that in my face whenever I come. I came here not to talk about my dog or the puppy that I'm still willing to give to Elsa, but I wanted you to be my maid of honor…\" \"I'm so….\" Elena grabs the hands of Catherine in desperation. \"No, I can't… not anymore.\" Catherine stands taller and the air around her changes, \"life goes on whether you or I want it to. I'm not the horrible friend, you are …\" ","Summary":" She sits in the brown, cold, and wooden chair wondering how this could have happened to her. Her mo"},{"Movie":"Last House on the Left","Title":"Living Dead Girl","Author":"Lizzielollipop186","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7682044","Passage":"[Chapter 1] Mari walked into Dr. Autumn's office exactly a month after what happened to her. The young woman smiled up at her, already seated as Mari came in. She told her to just shut the door behind her, never allowing the smile to fade. Mari, awkwardly obliged. \"Take a seat, dear.\" Again, awkwardly. \"So, hello.\" The woman held out her hand to Mari. Mari studied it for a moment before taking it with hers. \"My name is Rachel Autumn. Doctor, technically, but please feel free to call me by my first name.\" When her sentence was finished, she dropped her hand and took into it a pen. \"Can you tell me your name, love?\" Rachel Autumn smiled. Mari noted her smile was almost too white. She looked like she was fresh out of college and nervous, as if Mari were her very first patient. A trauma one, nonetheless. And , a child, to add to it all! How lucky was she? Still, she seemed friendly enough. She was being paid to help her, too. Any doubts that Mari had in the young blonde were pushed away. \"Yeah, uhm, I'm Mari Collingwood.\" Mari mumbled cooperatively. At first, Rachel seemed surprised to actually hear Mari, the rape victim, speak. But as quickly as it appeared, her appalled face vanished. \"Alright, Mari, now on a scale from one to ten, how willing do you think you feel to share with me what you're in here for?\" Rachel was already scratching away at her notepad. The sound set Mari's teeth on edge. She didn't know what bothered her more: the fact that she didn't know what was being written or that she did know what was being written. Mari cleared her throat. \"Uhm, well, I guess I'd say about a four.\" Rachel Autumn scribbled faster so she could speak without much silence in between responses. It made no difference to Mari. Either way, she felt more uncomfortable than she could even express. She popped her knuckles. \"Well, that's a pretty low number. But, I totally understand.\" Mari jerked unintentionally. Throughout her whole ordeal of doctors, psychiatrists, family, and everything, the words \"I understand\" kept coming up. Bullshit . They didn't understand anything. They didn't understand what it was to see your friend dying, murdered. They didn't understand what it was to have your body totally invaded. And they definitely didn't understand what it was to be mocked by those words meant to add a sense of comfort. \"So,\" Rachel began again once she was done writing, \"I just need to ask a few questions. They're just yes or no.\" She cleared her throat. \"So, are you on any medication right now?\" \"Yes.\" Scribble. \"Are you willing to cooperate during sessions such as these?\" \"Yes.\" Scribble. \"Alright, and are you here because a doctor recommended a psychiatric treatment?\" \"Yes.\" Scribble. Rachel then sighed. \"Okay, Mari, let's talk about you.\" Rachel Autumn flashed that blinding smile. There wasn't much to discuss. Mari knew who she was, but she wasn't that Mari anymore. She was too confused right now. Too haunted by everything to figure anything out. She used to be sporty, quietly popular Mari, who had just graduated and was ready to take on the world. She used to be a swimmer. She used to have plans for the future. But now, all she knew was that she was wearing gray tennis shoes today. She knew her mind had taken a break from nightmares at night, and now she was having sickly-sweet dreams about what happened. Rachel broke through her thoughts. \"So, how old are you, dear?\" Mari looked at the floor. \"Seventeen.\" \"Any college plans?\" Rachel continued to smile that encouraging grin of hers. Mari almost felt guilty for being angry at Dr. Autumn for doing her job and trying to be gentle about it. It couldn't have been easy. Mari tried not to sound too heart-broken as she replied to the tough question. \"Uh, well,\" she swallowed dryly, \"I'm kind of, taking a year off...\" She felt almost ashamed to say it. To Mari, it actually sounded cowardly. After everything she'd survived, shouldn't she be able to go to a big scary college? But the thought of being gone from home for nine months, living with a stranger... Mari inwardly cringed. When she told her parents that, they were more than on board with that idea. But then, they had been with a lot. Mari could have told them that she wanted to keep forty-two cats in her room and paint the floor with chocolate, and they would have ecstatically agreed to it. More scribbling. Then, \"Do you have any brothers or sisters?\" Asked the Doctor with near-invisible teeth. Actually, as of yesterday, Mari did technically have a brother. Justin turned eighteen in three days, meaning Mari's parents legally adopted him just in time. Mari didn't think that she'd tell Rachel that, though. That'd be going a little farther past 4 on the \"information I'm willing to give about that day\" scale. It'd be hard to explain without going into full detail about what happened June 22nd. \"No.\" Mari settled for a little white lie. Oh, eventually, when she was at number 10, she'd tell Dr. Autumn. Besides, maybe if Mari seemed exponentially boring, Rachel would have less interest in seeing her. It was a long shot, seeing as her story would make front page news. Rachel sighed. \"Activities you enjoy?\" Immediately, Mari thought of what she would have said June 21st and before that. Swimming. But now, the thought of swimming made her want to vomit more than conjuring up the memory of a disgusting grown man moving insider of her. More recently, though, Mari had fallen in love with walking. At night, later at night, Mari would just walk around for about an hour. She normally left at ten. Walking alone at night didn't frighten her. After all, she'd been abducted in broad daylight. At least she could hide in the dark. \"I walk a lot.\" She told Rachel, a little more sincerely than she had for the past few questions. As if feeling a new kindling in her work, Rachel wrote more fiercely. Mari almost felt accomplishment in seeing her do this. Not everything had to be about that one damn day, right? \"Really?\" \"Yeah.\" \"Why walking?\" Rachel looked at Mari curiously. Suddenly, Mari felt scrutinized by her eyes. She stared down at her shoes as she replied. \"Oh, well, I just like to think.\" Her cheeks reddened. \"You do?\" Dr. Autumn sounded nearly shocked. \"Well, yeah.\" \"What do you tend to think about on these walks?\" She got herself into a position ready for writing whatever Mari said. \"I don't know. Sometimes I think about dreams I had or will have.\" As it came out of her mouth, Mari regretted it immensely. \"Dreams? What dreams?\" Rachel Autumn sounded too eager for Mari to deal with. As if it was meant to save her, Mari heard a small beeping timer go off on Dr. Autumn's watch. Rachel stood up. Mari followed. Rachel held her hand out again. Mari took it again. \"Now, Mari, I'll see you next week, same time, okay? Oh, and if you have an emergency worth discussing,\" Rachel released Mari's hand, fumbled around her desk for two seconds, and then handed Mari a card, \"call me.\"[Chapter 2] Mari never went anywhere alone. She crossed the threshold of the psychiatric clinic out into the humid summer air. It only took her six seconds to register that her mother was already waiting for her, stopped in the middle of the parking lot, their new car stalling. Mari loved and respected her mother, but she found herself to be rather sick of her near-constant presence. Mari walked to the car, opened the door, and slid into the safety. Before she knew her mother would drive, she would have to apply her seat belt. With the satisfying sound of a click, Emma smiled, and away they went. Silence grew to be key in the Collingwood family. What was there to be said? But after two stoplights, Mari's mother grew uncomfortable in the still air and spoke. \"So how was it?\" Vague, easy. A good, unoffensive question a mother could ask their rape victim child. Mari's relationship strains were, of course, obvious, and they branched out everywhere. She felt the most distance with her mother. Emma felt it too, and constantly rehearsed what she could say to her emotionally-vulnerable daughter. Make sure your voice is steady. Mari considered a moment. Emma wasn't the only one who had come up with careful words. \"It was...\" something you forced me to go to, which is never appealing, mother, \"what I needed.\" Her words came out glumly, but Emma was pleased. Should this be a conversation? She decided to try. \"Yeah?\" Emma looked unnecessarily at her rearview mirror, thinking of her words. \"You think it helped?\" She held her breath. When it came to the word \"help\", Mari was never very appreciative. When Mari didn't answer right away, Emma instantly regretted using that awful word. Mari looked at the passing trees. Help . That was almost as bad as \"I understand\". Everyone always pretended like they knew what they were talking about when it came to these situations. Mari would have bet her soul that Rachel Autumn had never been raped. She wasn't in the right line of work. Mari also knew that it wasn't her mother's fault. She always took into account that her mother was trying, and that it couldn't have been easy on her either. But she didn't feel as though she should offer any sympathy out. Was she in as bad of a mental state as her mother, father, and everyone had made her out to be? She didn't think so. Still, she was raped, and she should be the one felt sorry for. Mari sighed willingly. \"It helped a lot, yeah.\" While Mari felt defeat, inwardly, Emma felt relief and... accomplishment? Should she consider it accomplishment now if something she says doesn't silence her daughter or piss her off? Right or wrong, the feeling was there. Encouragement pushed the words from Emma's mouth. \"So, you would like to continue sessions?\" Unconsciously, Emma began to drive slower, to maybe save time in the car with her cooperatively speaking daughter. They were three minutes from home if she just dropped the speedometer a bit. Mari dropped emotion as she spoke. \"Why not?\" If it made her mom happy, she should do it, right? Now, as soon as she figured out how to make herself happy again, she could focus on that. Despite her internal wishes, Emma decided to quit while she was ahead. The rest of the short ride they had they took in contented silence. And just like that, they were home. In the city, where they should have stayed the entire summer, anyway. Mari shivered. Nothing could really get to her as much as the \"what if\" questions. Of all the memories she experienced, all the nightmares, asking herself \"what if\" was the only thing that could get her to cry. Emma turned the car off, and almost considered hugging her daughter. Before her mother could say or do anything, Mari climbed out of the car, knowing Emma would be on her heels within seconds. She heard her mother's door slam as she made her way up the sidewalk. Mari didn't look back as she reached the door, but she knew she had to stop to wait. The front door was locked, as it had been since they arrived home. Only John and Emma had keys. Paranoid? Overprotective? Perhaps. But Mari understood, and stepped aside to give her mother access to the lock. A key turn, and Emma quietly motioned her daughter ahead of her. In Mari went. This had become her existence: escorted leavings, but otherwise, always inside somewhere. A kitchen, bathroom, and bedroom. Mari's new world was now three places in a house. Heaven forbid she be left outside for more than twenty seconds. Yet no matter how much it annoyed her, Mari couldn't really see herself living any other way anymore. A month ago, it was taking the car and taking charge. Mari listened as Emma relocked the front door, taking her shoes off behind her mother. Without saying anything else, once her shoes hit the floor empty of her feet, Mari was walking to the stairs that led to her room. It wasn't an intentional attack on her mother's feelings, but when Emma heard Mari's door shut, her heart almost melted. Mari's room was considerably larger than that of most teenagers. In fact, their house was the biggest on the block. It could be blamed on her parents' successful jobs. For seventeen years, Mari had been grateful and simply thrilled to have something most kids would do anything for. But now, it seemed like a waste and just unnecessary. This room, this house, hell, even life, was meant to be enjoyed by someone who was going to truly enjoy it. Mari didn't really enjoy much anymore. She went and sat at her desk. Did she like being alone? No, not necessarily. Mari felt like the biggest burden to happen to everyone around her. When she was with the company of others, guilt sank low in her gut. She wasn't exactly witty or charming anymore. What was the point? She spent her days in her room to stay out of the way. She slept, did little things here and there, sometimes ate, and tended to do it solo. For whatever reason, Mari decided to grab paper. A pencil followed. Before she even realized it, Mari was writing. Just scribbles, mostly, reminding herself of Rachel Autumn. A loop here, a dot there. Yet when Mari focused in harder at the paper, she was surprised to see that these scribbles were forming letters, and these letters were forming words. She just let her hand go, mildly shocking herself every time another sentence was written. Dear Missing Angel, My name is Mari Collingwood. You raped me last month, remember?Oh wait, you can't, because you're dead. And I'm alive. Now that doesn't seem fair. Why can't I be dead? You win again, I guess. I addressed you as \"Missing Angel\" because I feel like you're missing that crucial factor of being human. I think you need an angel inside of you somewhere to be truly human. You are a monster. And I feel sorry for you. I'm kidding. Sorry. We rape victims have a dark sense of humor. What did the dirt say to the virgin? \"Hi, I'm all over your body because, guess what, you're being raped. Good Luck, Mari Mari considered calling Doctor Autumn as she read the note again. Just briefly, before she came to her senses. She crumpled the short letter in her hands, creating a tight ball, got up, and opened her window. She threw it onto the sidewalk, not caring if it was to be found or not. She returned to her desk, but not to sit. Mari suddenly realized how angry she felt. She encouraged the emotion, allowing rage to take over. She quickly grabbed all of the paper she could see on and around her desk, notebooks, lined, plain, and wadded it all up. Out the window it went, followed by all of her pencils and pens.[Chapter 3] By the time she had begun to throw her bean-bag chairs and radios from the window as well, Mari was screaming. It all needed to be gone. It couldn't be here anymore. This life couldn't be here anymore. John Collingwood burst through the door after hearing his baby's cries. He found her in a heap on her floor, sobbing, her window's glass was all broken out now, probably because of her attempts at fitting her desk chair out of it. Her furniture, for that matter, was missing. So that's what Emma heard outside. Our traumatized child throwing the contents of her room out the window. His first instinct was to bend down and wrap her up in his arms, as he used to do when she would fall off her bike or just miss that bottom step. But he restrained himself. No touching. That was what Dr. Wempler first instructed. Dr. Wempler was a psychiatrist, but not for Mari, for Emma and John. The hopeless parents found that they themselves needed counseling on the matter. Not only on how to deal with their daughter, but on how to cope with becoming what they were. The young couple would never be the same after what they had done. \"Give her a year.\" Dr. Wempler had said gently to the man holding his crying wife. \"Let her be distant. She needs time. These things happen more than we'd like, and it's a terrible tragedy when it happens to someone we love, but there are ways to manage. She'll come back to you, I promise. It always happens. Especially with the young ones. They still need their mommies and daddies. \"Now,\" the doctor continued with a heavy sigh, \"in regards to your, erm, personal situation , all I can say is that you two are honestly the first people I have ever seen dealing with something like it.\" Dr. Wempler's many lectures now resounded throughout John's mind. Don't touch, don't touch, don't touch, don't touch, don't touch, donttouch, donttouch, donttouchdonttouchdonttouch. So, instead, John tried to reach his little girl another way. \"Mari!\" he yelled down at her. He was surprised to find that he had begun crying as well. \"Mari, honey, tell me what's wrong, baby, I can hel-\", he choked on the word, forcing it back down. Mari didn't take well to people who tried to help. Emma was calling for Justin in the hall. He could try to help, right? No, not help, he could do something to console her though. He is the only one closest to knowing the truth to what happened to Mari besides Mari herself. Mari coughed on her gasps, but the tears didn't stop. \"They're looking at me!\" She screamed. \"They're watching me! They're all fucking watching me and I can't do anything to stop it!\" She grabbed her hair and knotted it into her fingers, balling her fists until her knuckles were white. Stop it stop it stop it. It didn't stop. It never stopped. He was there. He was in her. He was fucking her. Justin stood in the doorway, hugging Emma, staring in horror at Mari trembling on the floor, at John Collingwood screaming \"Fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck\" to the ceiling, the sky, or even maybe to God. ( What God? ) Emma's tears felt sticky against his neck and he wanted to let her go. He didn't want to feel anything right now. That's what scared him the most. He felt everything. \"Baby,\" John looked down to his daughter again, \"baby, who's looking at you? Who's looking at you? Tell me who's- NOBODY IS WATCHING YOU, MARI!\" His face was red with blood. Veins protruded from his neck. He looked like a monster. She had done this to him. She had made him a monster. John abruptly turned from his screaming daughter to his crying wife. That boy was holding her. John reached out and grabbed her arm. Emma screamed, being yanked forward by her husband. He threw her over to Mari. Emma stumbled and fell onto her daughter. Through her tears and sobs, Emma could hear John: \"You fix her!\" ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Two Months Later: September~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ John Collingwood shouted to the paper boy that the magazine he had just dropped off belonged to the neighbors. Emma Collingwood chattered away on the phone to her friend, Lucy Firreira. (\"We should go to a movie tonight!\") Justin Collingwood, as he was now being addressed by, was taking in quite a bit of marijuana in his room with a lock. Mari Collingwood was not home. Mari Collingwood was at Bellard Schlider's apartment. Bellard Schlider was nineteen years old, and since Mari had just had a birthday in August, he felt no wrong about having sex with her. Mari had changed a lot since July. After what everyone in the house now called \"the Incident\", when John had gotten frighteningly physical with his family, Mari had started acting more normal. This was the third time Mari had gone over to his apartment to be fucked by him. It wasn't that it felt good, or that she particularly liked Bellard, it was that her parents no longer wanted her in the house. He was moving in and out of her, thrusting harder and harder each time, to the point where it was actually hurting Mari. But she bit her lip and squeezed her eyes shut, keeping quiet. She wasn't going to tell him to stop. For all she knew, her body could just be messed up from having been invaded two- three?- months before. This could all be normal. No reason to stop if it wasn't necessary. She would allow him to finish, he would, then she'd leave. Same as always. He was holding onto her arms, which were wrapped around his neck tightly, pulling him to her. She could feel his hot breath and condensation from his mouth on her neck, just under her ear. She hated it. She hated him. Her legs were hitched onto his hips, causing him to be sheathed in her as deeply as possible. Oh, and she hated it. She wanted to vomit the entire time. From the moment he kisses her lips, to his final grunt, she detests the activity wholly. Still, she wanted him in her. She wanted to be filled by Bellard. She wanted it all. She just wished she knew why. And then it happened. Unceremoniously as usual, Bellard met his orgasm with one last, rough pound, and it was over. He laid there for a moment to catch his breath. Mari patiently waited for him to get off of her so she could go home. Bellard rose onto his arms and hovered above her for a moment. He looked down at Mari. She returned the eye contact. That was something odd about the girl. Bellard had had eight other sex partners already in his entire nineteen years of existence, all of which he was involved in emotionally. These girls would love him and he would love them right back. No relationship ever worked out, though. Mari Collingwood was the first girl Bellard ever just fucked . She didn't want anything else. She made that perfectly clear. \"I just want to have sex with you, Bellard, so please don't think anything will get serious between us.\" Yet, she always looked at him so fondly afterward, and sometimes, even during. None of Bellard's girlfriends had ever even done that. Then, he slid out of her gently. Mari looked down between their bodies to watch them disconnect. She gazed at the sight curiously. How was something so far away from your heart or mind supposed to affect your feelings? It fascinated her. Having emotionally-severed sexual relations with Bellard had made her realize that sex was, indeed, nothing at all. She felt stupid for ever having felt like being raped earned her any special treatment. Bellard stood up, searching around on the floor for his boxers. Mari sat up, holding the blanket up to her front. She felt sore. The feeling was familiar, whether she wanted it to be or not. Bellard found his boxers and gingerly handed Mari her panties. Mari took them without a word. ","Summary":" Mari walked into Dr. Autumn's office exactly a month after what happened to her. The young woman sm"},{"Movie":"Rags","Title":"A Change","Author":"ToriiPheniox","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8256728","Passage":"[Chapter 1] Prologue First Person Point of View Life always has its ups and its downs; when it seems that you're at the top you realize that, like a wave, in a matter of seconds you crash with one wrong step. It's confusing and hard most of the time, second guessing your every step, but no one ever said this was going to be easy. No one ever prepares you for what's to come or how to deal with things; they just teach you the basics and let you live your life the way you choose it to be. 'You have a choice, Cam.' they always told me, but in truth, it was never really was my choice. It had never been up to me. When my parents died, was it really my choice? When they sent me and my brother to an orphanage because there was no one else, was it really my choice? When a family chose only him and forced us to be separated, was that really my choice ? No, nothing was what I wanted it to be. I was miserable and alone with no one to care for me. When couples came in, they wanted the younger, cuter kids than the older ones so it was hard to find a family for me. Then after the hundredth family came and went, I finally made my own decision; I was running away. No one stopped me, even when I told my roommate about my plans she just nodded and kept reading her book. She probably didn't take me seriously, I was only fourteen anyways, but I sure showed her. Even though, someone should've stopped me or at least told me to rethink my actions, because my one decision turned my life into a living hell. It was worse than the stuffy, old orphanage with the children crying and the teenagers bickering. They all had what they needed and sometimes got what they wanted, but out here it was survival. Some days I didn't have food and others I merely got a slice of bread. My clothes were worn and my body weak not allowing it to make the necessary amount of body heat on cold, windy nights when the temperature was colder than what I could handle. Everything had just gone horribly wrong. I didn't know how much longer I could deal with my life anymore, but I knew I had to keep going. Something was going to change; I just had to wait so I did. I waited for three long years and still went on. Every brutal summer and killing winter I told myself that this year was going to change my life and make it into something besides savaging for food and sleeping in the bushes, but there was only so much a girl could take. My body started to shut down and as I lay there on the side walk, people passing me by not giving a care in the world, I knew that my waiting had come to an end. My breathing slowed and my eyes felt heavy; it was the end of the line. The sun beating down on me laughed in my misery as the birds sang my funeral song until finally I closed my eyes. I thought I died.[Chapter 2] Chapter 1 Third Person Point of View Charlie yawned as he sat with his stepbrother, Lloyd in his limo, watching the scenery outside pass him by. He had been down this road many times before, but today it just seemed different somehow. Of course, there were the same old apartment buildings, the busy coffee house, and the luscious green park, but it was like he was seeing it for the first time. It might have been the new paint on the buildings or the flowers that swayed in the gentle breeze, but that didn't seem right. It was something else. \"Charlie, are you ok?\" Lloyd asked him suddenly. Charlie jumped slightly directing his attention to his stepbrother. He looked concerned in Charlie's opinion, which startled him. Was there something wrong? \"What?\" He asked not hearing his question. \"Charlie, you seem stressed. Are you ok?\" Lloyds' eyebrows furrowed in more worry than confusion. The look on Charlie's face as he stared out the window a few moments ago appeared confused and worried than his usual easygoing attitude. He thought that even though Charlie loved his career as a singer; there were times when he just wanted to be alone with no fans or company men around. He just wanted time to himself, which was hard nowadays considering how famous he was since the world found out he was Rags, a year ago. It was fun at first, but when the crazed fans wouldn't give him his privacy, it was frustrating to know that he didn't have time to write songs. \"I'm fine.\" Charlie smiled. Lloyd stared at him for a long minute before nodding and dismissing it. This was probably the only time Charlie had to think. Slowly, he looked back towards the window and stared out of it again. He felt the car slow and stop at one of many intersections, near the familiar park he used to play at. People were walking, running, and talking as the kids played various games. It was all the same. Suddenly, Charlie noticed something out of the corner of his eye. He turned to look and was instantly confused; he couldn't tell what it was, which attracted his attention more. It didn't move even when people walked around it. No one cared about what it was or how it got there, they just ignored it. He was about to forget about it too until it moved slightly, but just enough for him to realize what it was. His body jolted in realization; it was a person, a girl! No one stopped to help or even to call the police, and as that thought ran through his mind he yanked the door open right when the car just started to move. He ran through the traffic quickly, wasting no time at all. Cars honked their horn and came to a sudden stop as the superstar ran in front of them. People yelled rude remarks, but none of that mattered; he just needed to get to her. Lloyd yelled his name and screamed for the driver to stop as he, himself ran out of the limo and after Charlie. 'What's gotten in to him?' Lloyd thought. He had obviously not seen the body lying on the sidewalk yet, only thinking about his brothers' well-being. Charlie felt the heat of the sun beating down on him as he commanded his legs to run faster. The heat was insane and an unconscious girl on a sidewalk was not good. Why hadn't anyone stopped or asked questions? She was hurt or at least unconscious for the entire world to see, and no one cared? Finally he slid on the sidewalk and knelt beside the unconscious girl. Turning her over, Charlie checked her breathing and heard her give one last breath before she stilled. The situation had gone from bad to worse. Frantically, he searched for his phone before realizing he left it back at the car. People started to stop and watch the scene that was held before them whispering incoherent things. This was not the time to be talking. A girl was barely alive on the hot concrete and everyone just sat and watched? Charlie felt anger boil at the pit of his stomach towards the city people, but he masked it easily. \"Charlie! What's going on?\" He heard his stepbrother ask as he ran up next to him. \"Lloyd, I need your phone, now!\" He practically screamed. Lloyd looked at him for a moment not understanding the situation, until he acknowledged the pale body lying beside him. He snapped out of confusion quickly and hurried to fetch his phone, throwing it to him. Charlie said a quick 'thanks' before dialing nine-one-one. The phone rang a few times before a representative answered. \"9-1-1, what's your emergency?\" The lady asked calmly. \"There is a girl unconscious on the corner of Fredericksburg Avenue and Quill Street! She stopped breathing just as I got here; I think this is serious!\" He said into the cellphone. His hand was trembling as he spoke and looked at the girls face. She was becoming paler and paler by the second, but he didn't know what to do. Would CPR work? He didn't know. \"Thank you, sir. An ambulance is on the way.\" Those were the last words he heard before he abruptly hung up the phone and tossed it back to Lloyd. Charlie looked down at the girl and finally understood why no one helped her. The girl was boney and dirty. Her ribs stood out and it looked like she was literally skin and bones. Her cloths were basically rags and shoes were just scraps of leather. Her hair was dull and shaggy, but it didn't matter. She needed help and he was going save her. It wasn't unusual to find a homeless person dead on the streets. Everyone just ignores it and waits until the city people dispose of the body, but she looked just around his age. He couldn't leave her there to die. It wouldn't feel right. The sirens wailed loudly in the distance. He knew that the paramedics were going to take care of her and that he should just leave, but there was just something that told him to wait, to make sure she was ok. He just wanted her to be alive when she checked out of the hospital, but as the ambulance pulled up on the curb and surveyed the situation, Charlie realized that it was going to be a challenge. Their stricken looks and hesitance moves only proved that they didn't expect to rescue a poor homeless girl. None the less, they placed her on the gurney and wheeled her to the ambulance, but before they decided to rush, or at least drive, to the hospital a man walked towards Charlie and told him the girl wouldn't be able to pay for the treatment. Charlie gritted his teeth and clenched his fist. Was money the only reason why they weren't racing down the street to the medical center? His body shook in anger until he wanted to punch the guy in the face, but he held back and said in a surprisingly calm voice. \"I'll pay for all the necessary requirements.\" At that the paramedics perked up and jumped into action, hooking her to all the equipment in their van. They quickly closed the doors and rushed to the hospital. Charlie was enraged. He had never seen such self-absorbed people in his entire life. The thought of them letting her die if she didn't have money sickened him. He just wanted to punch something, but he couldn't stand there; he needed to go to the hospital and make she would get the right treatment. \"Hey Charlie, what just…\" Lloyd didn't finish his sentence as his stepbrother suddenly ran past him, through traffic and into the limo. Lloyd heard Charlie tell the driver to take him to the hospital quickly before the limo took off without him. He shrugged; he needed the exercise anyways.[Chapter 3] A Change Chapter II The heavy, metal equipment beeped in a steady rate as the ambulance sped down the street. Cars drove aside as the city people watched the van roar down the highway. They all turned their attention to it, wondering what could have happened to the poor soul that was being rushed to the hospital. The medics, however didn't see it as a poor soul, though, but a breathing corpse that was on death roll. They knew it was going to die sooner or later, they just didn't see why they had to prolong her death, but still with amount of money offered they continued relentlessly. They knew it wouldn't last long, but they revived her every time the loud, irritating sound of dead echoed throughout the van. They sighed, asking themselves why they had to deal with this nonsense. It wasn't logical in their minds that someone like Charlie would want anything to do with this... streetwalker. It never occurred to them though that she might be a lot like them, craving to be loved, cared about by the people around her and wanting to live for the sake of living. The only thing they saw was their difference in social status and money, the things that hardly defined a person, but nonetheless they still belittled the girl, acting as if she was worthless trash. They didn't see the possibility that she had dreams or goals that had yet or maybe a family, the things they saw in the outside was what they only thought about. Homeless, school drop-out, unsanitary, sinful, disgraceful, a failure to society... And when the medics examined her body thoroughly they cringed in disgust seeing how damaged and dysfunctional it was. Her organs had shriveled up and shrunken, her stomach was bone-dry, and her muscles were hardly even functioning. Her greasy hair was frail and her ghostly complexion was caked with dirt. \"Why is this girl so important?\" the medic thought out loud, not really looking for an answer. They hadn't realized that Charlie didn't look for a special reason to help the homeless girl; he simply wanted to help her because she needed it. They would never understand. Charlie, himself had came from a bad childhood after his mother died, not starving on the the streets though, but was treated as if he didn't matter and in some way he knew that the girl felt the same. She thought she didn't matter, but Charlie learned that everyone mattered. The medics couldn't see it like that though, all they saw was most likely a way for Charlie to get a better reputation and with that they smiled thinking that they had finally solved a complex riddle. It was just another charity case to become more popular and charismatic; now it all made sense and as they pulled into the hospital the medics sighed once again beginning to hush her inside for treatment.[Chapter 4] The Change Charlie ran through the sliding glass doors of the hospital and looked around frantically trying to gain sight of the strange girl he found at the park. His head swam with questions and doubt as he saw the lobby with only healing patients, no one resent. Could the hospital be willing to help her despite her appearance? After the scene at the park, he had the feeling of dread and fear; fear that the girl he so desperately tried to save was being thrown back out on to the ground where she would most likely die, a slow and painful death. No, he couldn't think that way, he needed to keep a straight head and hope for the best. He needed to have faith in that frail girl. He walked somewhat calmly towards to the receptionist who sat at her post at the front desk, typing efficiently. She was a plum lady with a cheerful aura surrounding her despite being surrounded with so much pain and death. Her skin was as dark as milk chocolate and her hair a shade darker than her complexion. She smiled brightly as Charlie stood in front of her showing her white teeth. He looked and saw that her name was Martha; according to the tag that is. \"Can I help you, sir?\" The receptionist, Martha asked calmly. Charlie returned the smile with one of his own and started to explain his situation. He was half way through the story when he realized he didn't know her name. No one did. He looked at the kind lady and instead asked for the room where their most recent female patient was. Martha nodded and pulled something from her computer. It took just a few short minutes before she found what she was looking for. \"Cameron Fitzpatrick?\" She quirked with a cocked eyebrow. Charlie nodded, hoping this was the girl from the street. It would be pretty embarrassing running in a strangers room. \"She has been rushed to immediate treatment, seeing that she has a long list of problems with her digestive, reproductive, circulatory, and respiratory system. Her organs are starting to shut down due to malnourishment and body rejection. Visitors aren't permitted to see her during her aid, until further notice.\" Charlie frowned, but knew that this was the right girl. With the list of different of problems and his common sense, he put two and two together, but treatment of that extent last would for days to get her back to stable health and to have to wait for that long made him more worried. Maybe he could convince the receptionist to allow him to go anyways. He ran his fingers through his hair in frustration. He couldn't ask for that, it could possibly jeopardize the lady's job. He shook his head and groaned. \"Sir?\" Martha drawled breaking him from his thoughts. He look towards the desk lady with a questionable look. \"What is your relation to this poor girl?\" She questioned with a concerned expression. \"Truthfully, I'm no actually related to her in anyway. She was simply laying on the ground on the verge of death. I had to do something. I just need to see if she's OK!\" He yelled as that last sentence pasted through his lips, frustration clearly engulfing his features making him seem almost desperate. Martha looked at him with a look of surprise, but soon her features softened with a look of care and understanding. Her gaze returned to the screen as she continued to type. Charlie sighed and sat down in a near waiting chair realizing that there was nothing he could do, but to tell the truth, he was hoping for something. Now he was forced to watch the minutes roll by as he just sat there. The chair he sat on was cushioned for comfort, to stop the anxiety, but Charlie still felt restless just sitting there watching as time continued on. It might have been hours since his conversation with Martha, but in reality it had be only a few minutes until Martha looked up with a smile on her face. She seemed to be completely proud of whatever she had accomplished, but Charlie was too focused on the matter at hand to even acknowledge her mysterious accomplishment. \"Sir.\" She said with an all too happy tone. Charlie looked up suddenly and after realizing she was referring to him, he walked over to her. \"May I have your First and Last name?\" Charlie looked at her with confusion written plainly on his face, but answered her nonetheless. \"Charlie Prince.\" Her look of surprise told him that she was oblivious this whole time making him smile slightly, but, just like before, her expression returned to her original one and she handed him a card. Charlie examined the laminated piece of plastic thoroughly until he understood what it was. 'ALL ACCESS VISITORS' PASS' it stated in bold letters. His eyes widen with shock. \"Room 314, Mr. Prince.\" She said with an all knowing smile. Charlie looked at her, unable to come to terms on what she just did. He knitted his brows together silently asking if it was really ok. She nodded reassuringly giving him a wink. \"Well, get going.\" She insisted. Charlie smiled widely. He definitely loved this receptionist and without another word he rushed down the hall towards room 314, Cameron's Room. '314, 314, 314...' he repeated tirelessly as he walked down the hall reading the room numbers carefully. His fingers felt the weight of the card in his hands as he fingered it. The notion gave him a sense of tranquility as he ventured further into the building, eying the number plates. The rooms were numbered oddly, but efficiently, even room numbers on the right while the odds where on the left. He read out the numbers slowly, his pace becoming drawn-out as he came closer to his destination. \"Room 308, Room 310, Room 312...\" His breath came out in a hushed tone as if not wanting to wake her from her slumber. He stood in front of her door, his demeanor uncertain. His hold on the card tightened with a vice grip, trying the strangle the piece of plastic. He felt weak in the knees and his stomach flopped around like a fish on dry land. Charlie Prince, the famous Rags, was thoroughly nervous. His rush of adrenaline and urgency leaked out as he stood there, stalling. He took a few slow, controlling deep breaths trying to calm his nerves. They felt twitchy and rowdy making his fidget and shake. Eventually his hand rested itself on the door knob and he dropped his head to the door quietly. Charlie didn't know what to expect from her. Would she be unpleasant? Or grateful? He didn't know. Steadily, after drawing some courage, he turned the knob and opened his eyes. When Charlie walked into the room he didn't know what to expect; maybe more machines, more wires, but as he stared at her small body, it felt stupid to think that they would. The girl, Cameron was still weak and injecting her with more needles and wires would most likely put her in greater danger. This medical stuff gave him a headache. Carefully, Charlie made his way towards the bed, pulling a chair near it and sitting down, his eyes never leaving her sleeping figure. He rested his elbows on his knees and watched her, seeing the rise and fall of her chest, the slight twitch of her muscles. He smiled as he gazed upon her. Cameron was changed from her grimy street clothes to a hospital gown. She was bathed and cleaned, and her light brown hair looked better that what it was moments before when he first saw her. It gleamed from the cleanliness and spayed out onto her pillow instead in greasy chunks. A layer of dirt was scrubbed off her skin making her look lighter than what he had thought. She seemed more peaceful laying there. He moved to brush a stray strand of hair back into place, but was stopped when he heard her take in a sharp breath. Cameron stirred in her sleep ruffling up the sheets and pull the cords; she whimpered. \"No... Don't.\" She breathed, her expression contorting into one of pain. She clenched her hands and released them repeatedly. Her breath came out in harsh pants, sweat collecting on her brow. \"No! Don't! Give him back!\" She cried, a tear slipping out. Charlie stared at her with a look of confusion. Who was 'him'? \"Stop! No! It's not fair! It's not fair!\" She thrashed around violently in her bed signaling the nurses to come calm her down. They told Charlie to leave and he obeyed trying to make sense of the whole ordeal. What had happened to her? Who was this 'him' she referred to? Millions of questions swam through his head as he walk out the doors of the hospital. He vaguely heard the receptionist wish him a good day, being engulf into his thoughts. He walked for ten blocks just thinking until an arm rapped itself around his shoulders and his step brothers face came into view. \"Hey, Charles.\" Llyod said with a smile. Charlie nodded and said an abrupt 'hey' not really caring or acknowledging him fully. Llyod frowned, something happened. \"Charlie, want to get a burger?\" He asked casually tempting him with his favorite food. Charlie shook his head. Llyod's jaw hit the ground almost literally. He never denied a good burger no matter how depressed he was. Whatever was on Charlies mind was serious and he had a hunch that it had something to do with the incident at the park a few hours ago. \"Dude, what's the matter?\" Charlies bother asked out of pure concern, but Charlie only answered with a sigh. Charlie was rarely depressed, but whatever problem he was facing, it was really getting to him, bad. Maybe he should stop thinking about Cameron altogether and let the troubles just wash away, but no matter how hard he tried, she kept popping up in his mind; her small body, her dark hair, it was all stuck in his mind. Charlie shook his head trying to get rid of his thoughts. \"Nothing.\" He smiled, a fake smile. \"You wanna grab a burger like you said?\" He needed to clear his head. His brother sighed, still knowing that there was something wrong, but nodded. \"Sure.\" He responded starting to walk towards their favorite burger joint. Lloyd was being kept in the dark... again. ToriiPheniox Here and sorry for neglecting my story and I realize that I don't really communicate with my readers and all so first. I do not own Rags just our beloved Cameron. :9 So let me ask everyone out there, what do you think of it? I would really love it if you told me what to do to make this better. Perfection is the key! (To writing that is.) Also, HAPPY NEW YEARS! My New Years resolution is to update on my stories more so I just might see ya'll more! Tehe! Oh! I might also write another story for my shippings, like Pokeshipping, Constestshipping, Oldrivalshipping, and Ikarishipping. If you know what all that is and love it Check it out! If not I won't pester you. :)) SO Good Night and Have a Great NEW YEARS! HAPPY 2013![Chapter 5] Chapter 4 It had been a week since the scene at the park where Charlie met small, frail Cameron. He visited her everyday bringing her fresh flowers so when she awoke she would see that someone cared. When he had time he would sit and watch her hoping that she would wake up soon and if he was in a rush he made sure to drop off the flowers with a note attached. There wasn't anything that would force him to miss his daily visits. At first it was uncomfortable, having the nurses scream every time he entered, but now they were content on calling him by his real name and teasing him on his obsession with the girl, but Charlie didn't see her as an obsession. She was just someone who needed help, at least that what he kept telling himself. In reality, Charlie had slowly grown attached to the girl... to Cameron. It was clear to everyone at the hospital and Lloyd that Charlie had deeper feelings, but Charlie was 'in denial'. \"Charlie, where are you going?\" Kadee asked him after their rehearsal for their monthly live concert. Charlie was already halfway out the door when she suddenly stopped him in his tracks. He hadn't told anyone except Lloyd about the mysterious girl and now Kadee was always asking questions. It wasn't that he felt like he needed to keep her as a secret or anything; it was simply that he didn't have time to. If he wasn't off looking after Cameron, he was performing or dealing with concerts and music videos. There was just not enough time in the day to do anything anymore. \"To the hospital.\" He finally told her which gave him a confused look. \"The hospital?\" His friend, Shawn questioned jumping in. Charlie looked at the time on the wall clock. Eleven thirty-six. He was late. \"I can't really elaborate it now guys, but when I get back I'll explain everything.\" He said in a rush, bolting out the door and into his limo. The driver took off the minute he heard the click of the seat belt knowing the daily schedule. Within moments Charlie was stepping out of the car and on the driveway of the hospital with his wallet at hand. Hopefully, the gift shop had the fresh flowers he always ordered, orchids. He read that orchids meant happiness and it was obvious Cam needed all the happiness she could get. He walked through the sliding glass doors greeting Martha as he did. She was always there at her post typing away at her computer or dealing with paperwork like the day a week ago when he needed her help the most. She smiled her charming smile saying a pleasant hello before going back to her duty. He smiled and headed towards the gift shop. It wasn't long before he got what he wanted and was walking down the familiar hallway towards Cameron's room. \"Hello Charlie.\" Cameron's nurse, Kim, addressed grabbing his attention. \"Hey, Kim. How's Cam?\" Kim cleared her throat giving a nervous laugh. \"Good, well, very well.\" Charlie smiled being oblivious to her unusual actions. \"That's good.\" Quickly he turned towards the door and opened it without another thought. He froze at the doorway as he gazed inside as Kim whispered a small 'surprise'. Cameron jumped from the sudden intrusion and turned around to face him as she pulled the new shirt over her head. It was the same shirt that Charlie had bought so when she woke she wouldn't have to wear those tattered pieces of cloth again, but she didn't know that. Cam was wearing the jeans that he bought as well; they were a little too big, but her nurse gave her a nice belt to hold it up. In truth, Cameron was sure she was dead, but now she was in a hospital with nice little presents and flowers as if people cared and a cute boy at the doorway. What was this madness? Maybe she really had died and Heaven was just a place where you lived out your most happiest dreams. No, her brother wasn't with her. \"Who are you?\" She asked curiously. It had been awhile since the last conversation she had with, well, anyone, nonetheless a boy. It seemed to her that he was the one who gave her all these pleasantries, but for what reason she didn't know. \"Charlie Prince.\" He said to her straightening out and staying at the door. He had imagined the day when she would wake from her slumber, but even though he knew what to say it seemed different now. It was as if she would run no matter what he said. For once, Charlie was speechless. He didn't know what to do or what to expect. It was just silence. \"Was it you who brought me here?\" She questioned gesturing to the hospital after awhile. Her eyes casted down as she said it making her seem even more unreachable. \"Yes and I brought you flowers and stuff.\" He replied to her. Stuff? Really? Cameron nodded. \"Thanks.\" Charlie looked around nervously. All his usual smooth talk drained out of him leaving him with a screaming silence. He tried to think of a topic to bring up, but he came up empty-handed. This was all just too much for him to handle; if they weren't going to talk maybe he should just leave. \"Why did you help me?\" Her sudden question made him jump in surprise. Why did he help her? Wasn't it obvious? \"Because you needed it.\" She looked at him with a look of surprise and disbelief. Cameron couldn't believe he simply helped her, but he did. He brought her to this hospital, put her in medical care, and watched out for her, even brought her flowers. She smiled. He was such a caring person. \"Thank you, Charlie.\" Torii: *groans* This is such a bad chapter, but I needed to put one up so *slumps in chair* here ya go! I'll probably just write a chapter soon to make up for this one because nothing really happened. I really don't like this chapter. :(( Well review please and please be nice.

Some days? A week? She seemed to have lost the track of time. Her days and her nights seem to pass without her even noticing it. The only time she slept was when she took those weird sleeping pills the doctors gave her. And this was not a resting sleep. In was a coma like slumber. And most of the time, she would have horrible nightmares. The nightmares seemed so unreal and at the same time, Elsa knew that they were not just mere nightmares. They were memories. Terrible memories about death, about her rape, about Clive's death, but above all, terrible memories about H50. The nightmares she had were always about those terrible memories of Dren. And it made Elsa sick. The nightmare would always start in the same way. She was holding Dren in her arms. She was in her mother's barn. Dren was still a child and was playing with the black and white cat Elsa had given her as a reminder of her love, and the connection they both shared. Not only did they share the same DNA, but Elsa had genuinely cared for Dren. And then, the nightmare would take an abrupt change. Elsa would see the adult version of Dren, naked and having sex with Clive. Then Dren naked female body would then be morphing into a male's body. Her bare breast would disappear and he would become a violent creature. She would morph into the creature that Elsa had to kill. Just before waking up, the last thing Elsa remembers about the nightmare is finding herself pleading. She finds herself pleading Dren, and begging him not to kill Clive. And just then, Dren would return her stare. In his eyes, there were nothing left of the Dren she took care of when sick. That Dren seemed gone. And Elsa knew that was all because of Clive and her. They kept Dren away from everything. They mutilated Dren, and hidden her existence away from the world. Dren was not the monster. She was. And that exact point in her dream, Elsa would wake up, screaming. And then, she would feel it again- A feeling of nausea, and then, a heavy kick in her stomach. Elsa would press her hand against her belly, heavily rounded and curved with maternity, and feel the life inside her. She would often leave the bed, probably going to take a long, cold shower. Sometimes, she would stare at herself, naked for a moment. She would stare at her heavily pregnant state. And she would feel the kicks. There was something about the way the fetuses kicked. Although Elsa was pregnant for the first time, she knew that the fetuses kicked in a different manner. But after all, those fetuses were not human. Not entirely. They were Dren's children. At the beginning of her pregnancy, she thought that she was expecting a single child. However, after the ultrasound revealed three beating hearts, Elsa felt a feeling of fear and apprehension as she thought about it. Elsa was three months pregnant, but she knew that since the embryos were developing at a faster rate, it would probably be just a matter of time before her first contraction would start. What would the children look like? What would they be? But she quickly dismissed any negative ideas. After all, what's the worst that could happen?[Chapter 2] CHAPTER TWO Elsa was resting on a blue chair, holding H60-A, nicknamed A for short, in her arms. The latter was born two weeks ago, but she had already aged to three months during this time. The experiment named A did not look like toddler Dren at all. Dren looked like nothing human at first. Dren had been developing in an artificial environment but A was born from a mother. Elsa had given birth to her. She had Elsa's eyes, and Elsa's blond hair. In fact, A looked almost human. Well, almost. Each hand missed one digit, and her long legs finished by hands instead of feet. And she had a tail but no trace of stinger at the end of it. Elsa did not know her exact feeling for A. After she had decided to keep up with her pregnancy, she often wondered why she had made such a choice. It was definitely not because of the money N. had offered her in exchange of her silence. Sometimes she would think of Clive, and thought that, if she had interrupted her pregnancy and got rid of Dren's offsprings, he would have died for nothing. A made smalls, plaintiff sounds, and flickered her long, pointed and reptile-like tongue, and Elsa knew that A wanted to be fed. She lifted her green shirt and offered her bare breast to A. At the same time, in another room, in the same N.E.R.D building, two other experiments were waiting for their mother to feed them. They were A's twin brothers; H60-B, and H60-C, nicknamed B and C for short. They were identical to A, but instead of blond hair, they had dark brown hair. Two males, who had been born just few minutes after A. N. had decided to separate A from her male counter parts. They were definitely ageing at a lower rate than Dren because, although they were not entirely human, 60% of their DNA was human, as opposed to Dren who had only 50% of human DNA. Yet, their rate of growth was still higher that any normal human, and since the experiment's lifespan were unpredictable, it was difficult to know when they would attain sexual maturity, and in order to avoid such things as unplanned mating, it was better to separate them since birth, and let them ignore each other's existence, unless it was decided otherwise.[Chapter 3] This new chapter focuses on A. B and C are only mentioned. I will focus on the twins in the next chapter. I hope you will find it worth reading. Your reviews are always welcomed. Thank you. \"A, B and C are indeed growing up very fast, this is true. But, because they do remain 60% human, they are growing up at a slower pace than the original experiment. In three months, the three hybrids have reached the maturity of twelve years old children. And they look even more human than the original H50- Dren ever did. A has proved to be smarter than two others. And they have speech abilities and communicate very well. A had started to talk during the first month after she was born -which technically made her around two years old back then- while her brothers managed to speak at a later stage.\" Elsa Kast explained to the new employee assigned to the projects H60-A, H60-B and H60-C. \"Don't forget\" Elsa added to the new employee, and she led him to the lab where A was kept, \"Never mention the existence of B and C in front of A. She has to think that she is the only one. That is, until the administration has decided otherwise.\" \"Yes, Miss Kast\" answered the young man. \"Follow me, Mr Steele.\" \"Please, call me Kyle\" he replied. Elsa stopped in front of a white metallic door. \"You should know that it is not something that everyone gets to see. Even for you, a supposedly brilliant student who just has completed university, this is a great opportunity. Your name has been retained among five hundreds of others. I seize this opportunity to remind you that you are not legally allowed to talk to anyone about what happens here. Not to anyone.\" Elsa spoke up in a very authoritative tone. Then, the scientific proceeded to the opening of the door using her security code. They entered the lab where A was kept. The door automatically locked itself up behind them. There was a young, twelve year old girl sitting on a white chair and she seemed busy reading a book. The room was plain white, and was hurting his eyes. A was wearing a long sleeved white shirt. She was so focused in her book that she did not even seem aware of Kyle's presence. She had blond hair that reached until her shoulders and a fair skin. Without her tail, and her legs that ended up with hands instead of usual feet, Kyle could have mistaken her for an average child. \"Hello, A\" Elsa said, taking a seat near A. Kyle did the same. He glanced at the book that she was reading. \"Alice in wonderland.\" Read Kyle. A raised her eyes and stared of a while at Kyle, as if she had just noticed his presence. Kyle could not help but to find her eyes absolutely stunning. At first glance, they did seem totally normal. But then, he realized that she had crossed shaped pupils. They were stunning. And then, all of a sudden, she started to panic. She jumped on the table, and flung her book away. Then she ran to a corner of the room, and buried her face in her hands. \"What did I do?\" started Kyle. \"The syringe\" Elsa explained, as she pointed at the syringe in Kyle's blouse pocket. \"She must have seen it. I suggest you to hide it, she is scared of needles.\" \"The syringe probably moved upwards when I sat down\", thought Kyle, unaware that he was thinking aloud. Kyle complied and then, when to join Elsa who was now holing a scared A in her arms. \"I don't want to, it will hurt again\" A wept bitterly, burying her face in Elsa shoulder. \"No\" the latter consoled her, before putting A back down. \"Not today.\" She added, almost in a whisper. Kyle went back to pick up the book and gave it back to A. \"Thank you\" A said, as she took it. As she was taking it, her sleeves dropped until her elbows, and Kyle saw A's arms, and he finally understood why the mere sight of a needle made her so scared. The arms were covered with needle scars. They looked like tiny little holes, all over her skin. \"Don't worry\" said Elsa after A had resumed to her place. She was now sitting exactly where she was when Elsa and Kyle had entered the lab. \"I know you saw A's arms\" Elsa added, \"But you should not feel sorry for her. I strongly believe we are all born to fulfill a purpose. And that is her purpose. Don't forget that, Kyle.\" However, the way Elsa avoided looking at Kyle directly in the eyes while she was saying this betrayed her. Kyle understood that she was not the cold scientist she kept pretending to be. As if Elsa had read Kyle's mind, she added. \"If I say otherwise, the administration may think I am too emotionally involved with the projects and they may say that I am not fit to be in charge of the project anymore. I cannot afford to lose these projects.\" \"Yes, I understand your position Miss Kast\" Kyle nodded back. Elsa left the lab, followed closely by Kyle. She locked the door using her security key. \"Do we get to see B and C now?\" asked Kyle, trying hard to sound serious and to hide his excitement. \"First thing first\" replied Elsa. \"First you have to take a shower.\" explained Elsa. \"We will provide you with another clean blouse\" Kyle looked at her with a perplexed look. \"First, it prevents foreign bodies from entering the lab where the experiments are kept, and of course because they have a good sense of smell.\" Elsa marked a pause, and then continued. \"Because if you go in B and C's lab right now, they'll probably smell A all over you and we don't want them to know that there is a female like them, not very far way. They don't have to know. I hope you remember that, Kyle.\" \"Yes\" answered back the young scientist, who could not wait to meet the other experiments.[Chapter 4] CHAPTER FOUR Kyle had slipped into clean, white blouse and was heading to the second lab, where B and C were kept, Elsa leading the way. She had also taken a sterile shower, and was now wearing a clean white outfit, and a white blouse. She stopped in front of a white door and used her access code to open the door. As soon as both got inside, the door automatically shut itself behind them. Kyle noticed that the lab was identical to the previous one where A was kept. Then, he saw them- B and C. Both looked identical, and they were wearing long white pants and short sleeved white shirts. The pants seemed to have discreet opening behind, which allowed their tail to be free. One of them was coloring in a picture book, while the other was playing a memory game on a touch screen computer. Their reaction was the same as A's, that is, they did not seem to be aware of Kyle's presence. Or if they did, they did not care. \"How can you make the difference between B and C when they look exactly like each other?\" asked Kyle. Elsa gave him a don't-ask-stupid-questions look. \"They are perfect twins, so we had to mark them.\" She replied. She walked towards the one who had been coloring, and Kyle followed her. Kyle saw that the \"experiment\" had something tattooed behind his neck. Then, he realized- It was a bar code, and beneath it was tattooed H60-B. His hair was trimmed short so that the tattoo would be clearly visible. Kyle saw that B was not coloring from a book, but he was in fact, drawing. B seemed to be a really talented artist as he had been drawing a very realistic image of the lab where C and he were kept. B continued to draw, and he was not paying attention to whatever else was happening around him. He reached out for another pencil, and in was only then that Kyle saw B's arms. They were punctured with needle wounds as well. His arms were marked by small needle wounds, just like A's arms were. And Kyle had already guessed that C's arms would probably be no different. Then, B carefully placed his pencil on the table and started at Kyle. \"You can talk to him.\" Elsa said, as she ran her fingers in her long hair. \"Hello, B. My name is Kyle\" the young man said, not knowing what else to add. B did not reply. He hastily reached out for his pencil and continued to draw. Kyle walked in the direction of C. The latter was in front of a computer screen, and seemed hypnotized by it. His eyes were doing rapid movement following the game on screen. His tail was erect and moving slowly, almost like a snake. C's arms were also punctured with needle wounds, just like A and B. \"His memory capacity and brain activity are very high. This game is really complex, but he manages to beat his own score every time. I am impressed by their level of IQ.\" explained Elsa, with a hint of pride in her voice. \"I have met only one person who was able to beat C's score easily.\" She added, with a sly smile on her face. Kyle realized that she was referring to A, who was the most intelligent of the three experiments. Elsa led him to a white screen, where x-rays of B and C were exposed. She pointed at an x-ray of C's brain, then to an x-ray of B's brain. \"With their DNA, we have been able to find a cure against Alzheimer. The experiments have four cerebral hemispheres, which is unbelievable. And this is just the beginning. There is still so much we have to learn. This is a unique mutation, that was not present in the original H-50\" said the scientist. \"And they All have it.\" Elsa stressed out on the word \"All\" so that Kyle could understand that she was including A as well. Each of her sentences was punctuated by the tap-tap sounds done by C, each time he was touching the screen with four digit hands. Kyle was genuinely amazed. He knew that the human brain consisted of only the right and the left hemisphere and these experiments possessed four hemispheres. He then went to see B again. The latter seemed to have added a new element to his drawing. B had drawn Kyle, and it was very well executed. \"Oh, that's me?\" asked Kyle. Kyle was impressed by all the details of the drawing, and B suddenly seemed to enjoy the attention he was getting from Kyle. \"Yes\" answered back B, as he resumed to what he was doing. Kyle was a pile of papers in a corner of the table. \"I did all of this since this morning.\" B explained, as he saw that his drawing had captured Kyle's attention. \"Can I have a look at them, then?' Kyle asked. \"Yes\" Answered B. Kyle took the drawings and started to study them, one by one, with a lot of interest. Elsa did not seem interested in whatever B had been drawing. She went back to see C. However, Kyle was impressed by the drawings of B. B had drawn Elsa, wearing a blouse. He had also drawn C, while the latter was sleeping. Another picture showed C, reading a book. And on the next drawing, B had drawn Elsa and C together, as Elsa seemed to be teaching C something. As Kyle was proceeding to the last picture, his mouth dropped wide open. He could not believe what he had seen. He called Elsa. She had to see that. When she came, she seemed more confused than ever. The picture showed the experiment A. \"What does that picture represent, B?\" Elsa asked, as calmly as she could. \"Why did you draw this?\" B did not seem to understand why Elsa was suddenly asking this question. \"I dreamed of her last night.\" he replied. \"And I know C did too…\" B added.[Chapter 5] First of all, I am really sorry to having taken soooo much time to update this fan-fiction. I had exams and I was really busy. I will try to keep updating regularly as from now, and I just hope you will like the direction the story is going. A, B and C were all together, in the lab. A was wearing a navy blue dress, which was short enough to let her tail come out, while her hair were let loose and fell untidily on her shoulders. Her brothers were wearing their usual white outfit. Elsa suddenly felt very uncomfortable in their presence. They were surrounding Elsa. The latter was alone and did not know what to do. The experiments were not saying anything, but they looked at her with cold and cruel eyes. Their eyes were devoid of any human feelings or emotions. Elsa wanted to say something, but even though her lips moved, no words came out. It was a mistake to come here alone. They were three, and she was on her own. She should have brought the new one with her. It would have been better to bring Kyle along. At least he would have helped her if things got out of control. A took a step towards her, and Elsa saw her arms, punctuated with needles wound. At that exact moment, Elsa thought that A's hands would have looked completely normal and human-like if only she had been born with five fingers instead of four. However, no matter what, the experiments A, B and C still looked more human that Dren had ever been. Elsa knew that from the minute she had first set her eyes on them. Elsa placed her fingers on her forehead to chase that idea out. She did not like to think about Dren too much. It was too painful to remember that part of her life. Dren was nothing more than a bitter memory and a dark part of her life that she now had to live with. Her attention was drawn back to A, B and C. B and C did not seem to make any move, but continued staring at her. Then, unexpectedly, A, B and C erected their tails and a poisonous sting appeared at the end of their tails. And at that moment, Elsa almost fainted as she saw that A, B, and C were starting to morph themselves into something else. Their skin seemed to stretch itself in a grotesque manner, and their bodies looked as if the experiments were altering and morphing the shape of their bodies. And to her horror, she realized that they had transformed into Dren. They had morphed into the violent, male version of Dren- Naked, with wings unfolded and they were all staring at her with hate, nastiness and spite. Elsa had now three adult version of Dren ready to attack her. \"INSIIIIIDEEEEE YOOOUUU…\" A (under the shape of Dren) said. Then, all of them jumped on Elsa. Elsa felt a sharp pain in her chest, and the weight of A, B and C over her body made her suffocate. The latter screamed, and woke up. Elsa looked around her. She was in her alone in her bed, her sheets and pillow drenched in sweat. \"That was just a fucking nightmare…\" Elsa whispered to herself as she checked the time. It was almost six a.m. A hot shower - that was what she needed. That was always one of the best things that helped her calm herself down, and think straight. She went into the bathroom, and she slowly undressed herself. Elsa Kast paused for a moment in front of the mirror, looking at her naked figure, and then went under the shower and opened the water. She felt the warm water against her cold skin. Soon, the bathroom became foggy with steam. Kyle and Elsa had finally been granted the permission to introduce A to her male siblings. Elsa felt very nervous about it. She had not forgotten how badly it had all ended up for Fred and Ginger. However, Kyle fell very excited about it. And although he tried his best to look serious, it just could not be hidden. Elsa liked his enthusiasm, as it reminded her of Clive. Indeed, they had the same curious mind. \"Look at that.\" She said, pointing to the x-rays images of B and C's brain, and then showing the X-ray of A's brain. \"We have tried to understand what makes them connected to each other, but their brains remain a mystery to us. This is why the administration is allowing us to introduce the experiments to each other.\" she continued. \"And we will supervise the whole experiment.\" commented Kyle. \"Yes, indeed Kyle.\" replied Elsa, as her attention was drawn back on the x-rays. \"We would not want any of the experiments to change sex, and this is why we have to be very attentive.\" She added. B and C were busy with their daily routine. C was on the computer screen, again doing a complex brain game, while B was reading what seemed to be a huge encyclopedia. Both of them were wearing their usual white outfit. Elsa got it first, followed by A and Kyle was closing the march. A was wearing a white, short dress. As soon as A got in, B and C sensed her presence. \"She came.\" C said, as he turned from the computer screen to face her. \"We knew she would.\" B added, almost in a whisper. Slowly, A went to join them. She still hadn't said a word. Kyle and Elsa could not do anything else but to watch, not knowing what reaction to expect from the experiments.[Chapter 6] \"It has been a week since the experiments had been introduced to each other. They now live in the same laboratory, and they seem like part of the same pack. B and C seem very protective towards A. A seems to be the leader of the pack. Physically, they have aged of about one month during this week. And they share a kind of mental connection with each other. That connection remains a mystery, even to us, scientists. They protect each other, like a pack.\" Kyle spoke in his voice recorder, as he observed H60-A, H60-B and H60-C. \"More like a hive,\" a feminine voice said behind him. Kyle knew it could be no one else but Miss Kast. \"Hive?\" asked Kyle, as he turned around to look at her. Elsa was wearing her usual white blouse but had exceptionally tied her hair in a pony tail. She looked at him with a slightly amused face. \"Yes, they are not like a pack. I would say that H60-A, H60-B and H60-C are more like a hive.\" She explained. \"Hive,\" Kyle corrected himself. \"So A is the queen?\" he asked. \"She is the upper one, the one who takes the decision.\" She replied. Kyle looked back at A, B and C. They were all busy doing their daily activities. All of a sudden, B came to Kyle, holding a story book against his chest. \"What is this?\" Kyle demanded him. Kyle saw that is was the story book of Pinocchio. \"You can read it to me, if you want to.\" He whispered shyly. \"You can read on your own!\" Elsa retorted, her voice suddenly sounding very cruel. \"No, I'll do it. Give me five minutes.\" Kyle said to B. Suddenly, A and C joined B and they all gathered in front of Elsa. Then, one by one, they all approached her and they looked as if they were sniffing her. \"What are you doing?\" questioned Elsa. \"There is something wrong inside you.\" A said \"There is something wrong inside you.\" B and C echoed. Neither Elsa nor Kyle understood what they meant back then. It was only a few days after that Elsa felt a sharp pain in her stomach and when she woke up in the middle of her night, she had a bleeding nose. Soon, the diagnosis fell. She had cancer. After the news of Elsa's sickness fell, she rarely came to the lab. Kyle though it was something terrible. N.E.R.D did not share Kyle's opinion. They saw in Elsa the perfect lab rat. They were planning to start using A,B and C's DNA to find a cure for cancer and Elsa proved to be the perfect candidate to test the effects on a human. When she was asked whether she agreed or not, she replied with her usual leit-motive. \"What's the worst that could happen?\" Elsa found in H60-A, H60-B and H60-C a way to get better, and N.E.R.D had found a way to make more money. Kyle went to pay visits to Elsa as often as he could. She looked weak and a white scarf tied around her head had replaced her blond hair. At first, Elsa started to get better, but then, her health suddenly deteriorated. Somehow it looked like she, herself, did not want to get any better. After ten months, Elsa died. She was, of course, buried next to Clive Nicoli. And H60-A, H60-B and H60-C had aged into adulthood.[Chapter 7] CHAPTER SEVEN It had been ten months since Elsa had died. And ten months since H60-A, H60-B and H60-C had aged into adulthood. H60-A bore a striking physical resemblance to Elsa Kast, and that was something which Kyle found somewhat very disturbing. Each time he would look at her, he would see Ms Kast. They had all grown up and had reached their early twenties, in just ten months time. Kyle found it tragic that the scientist was not here to see them. Kyle knew that losing Ms Kast was a tragedy. She was a brilliant genetic engineer and that he still needed her to understand H60-A, H60-B and H60-C. That woman had still so much to teach him. Kyle stepped into the lab where A, B and C were kept. \"Good morning, Kyle\" A greeted him as she noticed his presence. Kyle though that even her voiced sounded like her mother's. \"Good morning, Kyle.\" B and C echoed in the same monotonous tone. \"Hi A. Hello B and C.\" Kyle replied back as he placed his folder on the white table where B usually did his drawing. Since Elsa death, A, B and C had been subject to more experimenting and testing than usual. The research department of N.E.R.D had made it a priority to use their DNA to find a cure for cancer. \"Who is going to go first?\" B asked, unable to hide the fear in his voice. \"Well, I'll start with your sister then you, then C. Just like we always do.\" Kyle said. \"Did you go through this when you were younger too?\" B asked, in a very sheepish tone. \"Excuse me?\" asked Kyle. \"Were you subject to experiments to, like us?\" B asked again, before quickly adding, \"I have been thinking a lot since Elsa died. I read in a book that people get buried when they die. Or sometimes their body is burned and the ashes are kept.\" B said. \"Yes, Elsa has been buried in a cemetery.\" Kyle said, not knowing exactly what to add next. He had never expected having such a conversation with anyone of them. Kyle glanced around him, and he saw that A and C were not as interested as B to get answers. \"She is buried in the outside world, where A, C and I never get to go.\" B murmured, almost to himself. \"Yes, outside indeed.\" Kyle confirmed. \"Why can't we go outside?\" B suddenly asked out of the blue. To this, Kyle had no answer. And at the exact moment, he truly wished Elsa was with him. She could have handled this situation better. Instead, Kyle brushed off the question and proceeded to take a blood sample of A. B understood that Kyle was tired of his question, and did not ask anymore. Some days later, Kyle had been asked to be seen by a dark hair woman, who introduced herself as the head of the research facility. It was the first time Kyle had ever met her, even though Elsa had spoken of her quite often. Elsa had also told him that the head of the research facility did rarely meet the \"small staff\" and Kyle concluded that, if the latter wanted to meet her, it must have been concerning H60-A, H60-B and H60-C. \"Since they are adults now, this means that they can become sexually active at any time.\" She told him, \"and we are planning to have the female one sterilized the soonest possible to avoid unwanted mating.\" Kyle felt unexpectedly outraged, and shocked by this. He finally understood that he was the only one who saw H60-A, H60-B and H60-C as human, even though that was merely partly. Everyone else in N.E.R.D just saw them as just experiments. \"But I don't think they would want to mate with each other, they know that they are related to each other. They are brothers and sister, and they protect each other. I do not think we should…\" But his sentence was cut short, and he never finished his sentence. \"I am not asking you for your permission, Mr Steele. It shall be done. H60-A will be sterilized.\" That night, Kyle could not fall asleep. The sterilization was scheduled for the next day, and Kyle had to reach for earlier than usual to assist in the intervention. Kyle could not help but to feel annoyed by this. After all, H60-A, H60-B and H60-C were 60% human, and still, they were being treated like mere animals. He wondered how Ms Kast would have felt if she was still alive. He wondered what she would have said about it. Slowly he fell asleep, and he dreamt of Elsa. In his dream, he was with her in the laboratory where they kept A. Everything seemed normal. It was as if he was living his first day at N.E.R.D again, with the same the enthusiasm and the excitement. But then, everything changed. Elsa became the bald and weak woman he had last seen. Kyle tried to talk to her, but no words came out. Then, the ringing of his cell phone woke him up. With his eyes half opened, he picked it up. \"Kyle.\" He managed to mumble. \"Mr Steele,\" someone said in a very serious tone. What followed next made Kyle wake up completely. \"There has been a serious fire in the N.E.R.D buildings. The fire fighters are still trying to extinguish it, but you have to come now. The three experiments escaped.\"[Chapter 8] CHAPTER EIGHT This is the final chapter of SPLICE. I hope you liked the story, and that you are not too disappointed with the ending. I know I took a lot of time to write it but I was really busy lately. Please r&r.; I don't mind if the reviews are negative. And I know there are loads of typo mistakes as well, sorry for that. Once again, sorry for having taken so much time. Kyle felt like this whole week had seemed like a living nightmare. Every day, he felt like if none that had happened was real. He felt like he was all the time walking in a dark room, not able to see anything and bumping into every single item. A whole week since N.E.R.D had caught fire and everything was completely destroyed. That fire. The fire was no accident. Indeed, it was not. Hundreds of activist against genetic manipulation suddenly showed up in front of N.E.R.D, throwing insults and Molotov cocktails. They had started the fire, unaware that the experiments conducted by N.E.R.D were not limited to animal testing only. No one had seen that coming. N.E.R.D was unprepared for this. And H60-A, H60-B and H60-C had managed to escape. The surveillance cameras were useless, having been reduced to nothingness. Where were A, B and C? The phone suddenly rang. Kyle hurried to pick it up. What he heard next over rejoiced him. \"We found the experiments H60-A, H60-B and H60-C\" One week before. A came out running from the building, followed closely by B and C. The whole building was on fire. It was true that they did not know anything about the outside world, but they had read enough to know how deadly it was. Yet, it seemed easier for them to escape compared to the others that were trapped in the buildings. Outside, there was around hundreds of people, all panicked. But A did not think about all this. She just wanted a safe and quiet place for her brothers and herself. They ran away. Everybody was panicked, no else seemed to notice them. They ran as fast as they could until they were in what seemed to be a desert forest. \"Where are we?\" B asked a note of fear and apprehension in his voice. \"I don't know, but this should not have happened.\" replied C, his eyes scrutinising the sky. The sky was dark, and the stars were shining brighter than usual. Then something struck A. It was the first time in her life that her brothers and she were seeing the sky. And it was also the very first time that A, B and C were seeing stars. She had read all about them in books, and in encyclopedias. Her brothers and she had read about how the stars were, in fact, burning gases and that the sun was in fact, a star too. When A was younger, Elsa would even have let her watch a documentary from time to time on stars and far away galaxies. But that was a long time ago, before she even knew that she had two brothers. They had read all about stars. However, nothing had prepared them for what they were seeing. For the first time of their lives, they had completely forgotten about the testing, the needles, the experimentations carried out on them, the non-stop pain, the lab, Kyle and Elsa. It seemed like nothing else mattered. They were free now. And for the first time, the saw the real sky. And thus, they went deeper and deeper into the forest. They were never going back there. They would hide and try to survive. They chose life. That was what they knew. What they did not know is that a search party had been launched by N.E.R.D and that their freedom would soon be cut short. Kyle drove until he saw the farm. That where he was told H60-A, H60-B and H60-C were kept. As he stepped outside the car, he was greeted by six scientists who worked at N. . They explained to him that this was, in fact, Elsa Kast's farm and she had legated it to N.E.R.D since she had no close relatives, and never had any [human] children. Kyle also knew, from Elsa, that this was the place where Clive and she had hidden Dren all this time, until she finally changed sex and got killed by Elsa. This place was ill-fated, Kyle sensed it. Kyle was approached by the head of the research facility, Mr Edward Chen. The latter was a fat guy, wearing weird looking gloves. Kyle had met him only once but the latter did not seem to recall Kyle at all. \"The experiments H60-A, H60-B and H60-C are tied inside the barn.\" He started, after having finished introducing himself. \"How are A, B and C?\" enquired Kyle. \"They are alive, and we have decided that the best thing to do now is to terminate them.\" He added. \"What?\" gasped Kyle, unable to hide his state of choc. \"This is not a request.\" The head of the research facility replied dryly, \"But if you can't do it, someone else will, be sure of that.\" Mr Edward Chen then placed a hand on Kyle's shoulder, and added, pronouncing each word very slowly and very carefully. \"There is no more N.E.R.D. Everything we had got burned. And if the world happens to know about those damn H60-A, H60-B and H60-C, then imagine the situation. We can still rise from out ashes. But some… secrets… have to be destroyed. These secrets are H60-A, H60-B and H60-C. Whatever you chose, the fate of H60-A, H60-B and H60-C is sealed now!\" Kyle accepted and agreed that he should be the one to terminate H60-A, H60-B and H60-C. Kyle stepped inside the barn. B and C were unconscious but A was fully conscious. She had tears rolling down her cheek. She was a smart girl. The smartest of the three, as Elsa would often say herself. She knew what was going to happen to her. And she also knew that her fate was sealed, no matter what she would do or say. \"Don't watch.\" Kyle told her, using the same voice he had used when he had first spoke to her. A closed her eyes. And wondered where would she go after her death. ","Summary":" SPLICE 2- Dren's legacy CHAPTER ONE Elsa Kast had not slept for… How long had it been already?

I forgot how much I liked writing them. :) Yeah, so anyway, this may not be totally up to par since it has been so long, and I've been busy with stuff. Anyway, enjoy. Chapter 1: If You Only Knew Mari stood at the window, lips parted slightly, and let her eyes, which had long since been stricken with the coldness of social isolation, fall to the garden that lay outside. John, her father, was on his knees, ridding the fruitful dirt of the wicked weeds that wished to suffocate the tomatoes that had recently been planted. Mari was a tomato. In her mind, Krug was still out to get her, still out to smite her in the cruel way he'd murdered Paige. It was only a matter of time before he figured out where she was and… \"Mari?\" Mari screamed as a hand latched onto her shoulder, interrupting her train of thought. Instinctively, she panicked and wrenched away, kicking backwards as she struggled to escape. Darting to the corner and breathing heavily, only then did Mari realize it was only her mother. Emma had backed off towards the opposing wall and looked frightfully at her daughter. \"Mari, I'm sorry… I spoke to you when I first came in, I thought you heard me. I'm so sorry. I didn't mean to scare you like that.\" Emma slowly advanced across the room and wrapped her arms around Mari, who immediately became rigid to the touch of another human's flesh. \"I'm sorry. I just came in to tell you…\" Emma's words were lost upon her daughter, who once again, began to zone out. Since her attack three years ago, Mari Collingwood's bad days gradually began to outnumber her good ones, and this was certainly one of the bad ones. Mari's good days included her willingness to speak, though the words were few, and often consisted only of short greetings and small talk with no eye contact. She would work in the garden with either of her parents, and sit outside, as long as someone was with her. Mari was never alone unless she was inside, and even then, her parents were customarily in the next room. During her bad days, she hardly spoke a word, and instead stayed in her room, sitting on her bed with her knees tucked up under her chin. In three years, Mari had lost her youth; now she was an emotionless statue, still and hard as stone. \"Hey, girls!\" John entered Mari's room, still dawning his dirt covered gardening gloves. \"Oh, John!\" Emma exclaimed. \"I wish you would've taken those gloves off outside; they're filthy! And I just vacuumed too. I really would prefer not to do it again.\" John sighed, pulled off the gloves, and shoved him into his pocket. \"What I was going to say was that Mari's birthday is coming up and we should plan a party of some sort.\" John put a loving hand on his daughter's shoulder. \"Doesn't that sound like fun, Mari?\" Mari's cold, unfeeling eyes drifted from the corner of the room to meet her father's. \" Birthday?\" Mari though to herself. \"My birthday?\" It proved to be harder and harder with each passing day to keep track of time in her world which seemed to have no sense of time at all. Mari's birthday was July 14 and she could've sworn it was March. This birthday would commemorate her 19th year on this godless earth, a day that she lost all hope of seeing three years ago when she laid in the mud outside the lake house, covered in her own blood from her bullet wound, in the cold, relentless rain, praying for the sweet release of Death, which never seemed to come. After living in Life's house for 16 years, she had waltzed straight up to the picket fence which divided the property between Life and Death. Death had stood on the other side, beckoning her to come and play on his side for a while and made it look oh so tempting. But Life had unbreakable shackles around her ankles and would not permit her to leave. She was life's prisoner. Mari broke herself from her trance and nodded yes to her father's question. \"A party… might be nice,\" she slowly muttered. \"That's great, Sweetheart.\" John kissed his daughter's forehead before returning to his garden work. Emma soon followed. When they were gone, Mari's gaze returned to the window and the world just beyond the glass. A familiar beat up, dark blue pickup pulled into the driveway. Mari's knees locked as the owner of the truck stepped out. As his slightly worn white tennis shoes stepped onto the gravel driveway, he ran a hand through his thick black hair. She hated him, and somehow she could not look away. He shot a glance up towards her window; her icy blue eyes met his mesmerizing sapphires. It was only after that moment that she was able to turn away from the window and press her back against the wall, and then proceeded to sink to the floor. Mari despised him with every inch of her soul, and yet something about him drew her to him. There was some sort of connection between them, and Mari had made it her life's ambition to destroy it, not matter what the cost. Meanwhile, \"I think she may be getting better,\" Emma told John, who was once again on his knees pulling weeds. She leaned against the white siding of the house and folded her arms. \"She talked a little today. She seemed willing to give the party a try.\" John sighed. \"I don't know. I used to think that way too. But after a while, I discovered I was only harming myself by getting my hopes up. What happened to Mari scarred her mentally and emotionally. I wish we could get her some help, but right now, we've got to stay hidden. Getting ourselves hauled off for murder won't help Mari at all.\" John looked up as the sound of tires grinding gravel grew nearer. A blue pickup pulled into the driveway next to the garden. \"Hey, did you remember to pick up the milk?\" Emma called out to the driver as he stepped outside. \"Would you believe that they were out?\" he replied in frustration, rolling his eyes. \"I keep telling you guys, this place is a shithole. The general store is out of stock of nearly everything almost all day every day. The law \"enforcement\" is off stuffing their fat ass faces with doughnuts, and local the kids that hang around here are a bunch of good for nothing potheads! This place sucks.\" \"Don't forget you used to be a pothead,\" John retorted sternly, raising an eyebrow. \"Small shithole towns are all we can manage right now. No one will recognize us here. It's our home, for now.\" \"Besides, Justin,\" Emma added, \"you're like our family now. We need you and you need us. Where else would you have gone?\" A half smile crept across Justin's black stubbled face, which had become more chiseled and distinguished throughout the years. \"You guys know I'm grateful for saving my ass..\" \"Mari seemed to be a bit more responsive today,\" John told him, his serious tone completely gone. \"Maybe you could go upstairs and see if you could get her to talk a little more?\" Justin glanced up towards Mari's window. He caught a glimpse of her long, unkempt blonde hair that framed her pale face before she ducked away. \"I wouldn't push it,\" Justin cautioned. \"If she's starting to talk more, don't force her into it. I know you guys are excited that she's seeming to get a little better, but don't overdo it.\" And with that, he tromped up the front steps and into the little two story house. He climbed the stairs but on the way to his room, he paused in front of Mari's door, which of course, was closed, and if Mari had her way, locked. Her parents had removed the locks on all the doors because they were secretly afraid Mari would try to commit suicide, again. The first few months after she'd been kidnapped had been Hell. And Justin still blamed himself. Justin knew how Mari felt about him. He could see it whenever they locked eyes; how cold they were, as if they were saying \"You did this to me\". And she had every right to feel that way. After all, if Justin had never laid eyes on her and Paige at that little store by that stupid lake, none of this would ever had happened. It would've all been just a horrible nightmare, and they all would've woken up and gone on with their lives. Justin was the only one who had gained anything at all from meeting Mari's family. He had a family, a real one. His whole childhood, all he prayed for was for someone to love him, and now he had the Collingwoods. But he didn't want his wish if it meant that someone had to suffer for it to come true. Mari didn't deserve that. \"It couldn't hurt to just say hello,\" Justin murmured as he raised his knuckle to knock on the door. Gently, he let his hand tap the wood once, then fall. He couldn't. They'd lived together for 3 years, and he still couldn't face her. Instead, he trudged down the hall to his own room and slammed the door, furious with himself for creating a monster and not being man enough to destroy it. Mari heard him. Huddled in the corner next to her window, she heard Justin stomp up the stairs and stop in front of her door. Mari wasn't the wounded little girl that everyone made her out to be. That was a disguise so that her true motives would remain concealed. Mari yearned to burst through the door and claw him. Her hatred for him gnawed at her heels like a demon. She had to have her revenge, and she would, she swore on her life. For the first year after Mari's attack, she was a wreck; a spineless jellyfish, an empty shell of a human being. Suicide attempt after suicide attempt, nothing seemed to work. Her parents refused to leave her alone for a single second after they came across Mari huddled in the bathtub with no water in it, in the dark, wrists torn to shreds, with her own fingernails, since they knew better than to let Mari around razors, while she was hugging herself, rocking back and forth, and sobbing hysterically. Her mother was with her from dawn to dusk, even in the bathroom. After 6 months, Mari had had enough. For just once she needed to be alone with her thoughts, even if she wasn't trying to kill herself just then. The thought occurred to her one night when she was falling asleep. Her life needed purpose. While it was true that she didn't want to live anymore, Mari figured she had better make use of her time left. On that night she hardened her heart and decided to inflict pain on someone, just as Krug had done to her. And who better than the son of Krug? When she heard his footsteps again and his door slam shut, she cracked open her door and took a peek down the hall. Mari moved like a ghost down the wooden floor, gracefully, yet slowly. When she reached Justin's door, a sadistic grin crept across her face. If only he knew what she had in store for him. If only he knew.[Chapter 2] Chapter 2: Glasgow Smile NOTE: I kind of forgot about this, lol. I never check my email and I finally did and realized I had gobs of reviews begging me to write more so here, I guess. If you have ideas let me know because I have no freaking idea what to write next. I've been busy with dance team and stuff. We got invited to dance at Conseco Fieldhouse. Sorry for the wait. :( Mari tiptoed down the dark hallway, knife in hand. Tonight was the night. Stopping outside Justin's room, she placed a ghostly pale hand on the door knob. The door creaked open as it would if this were a horror film. But this story you'd never see in the theaters. Mari's eyes pierced the darkness and located Justin asleep in his bed. As she crept closer, she noticed he was shirtless; his well toned muscles rippled in the moonlight. She removed a lock of raven hair from his brow. \"You look stunning,\" she murmured. Mari proceeded to raise the knife, then run it into the left side of Justin's face, just below his ear. He awoke immediately and let out a bone chilling cry of agony. Mari laughed murderously, then jerked the knife down to Justin's mouth and quickly repeated the cut beginning under Justin's right ear, finishing the Glasgow Smile. Justin's hands flew to his torn face in shock. \"You frown much too often…\" Mari cooed at him. \"You look so much sexier when you smile.\" She let out a cackle before raising the knife over his head and repeatedly stabbing him in the chest. Blood began to drench the room as Mari's sinister laughing echoed throughout the house. Justin's eyes flung open. He sat up and looked around. Light was streaming in through the bedroom windows. He ran his hands over his chest and face; there were no wounds, and the Glasgow Smile was gone. It was never there. Breathing a sigh of relief, Mari's sadistic laughter found its way into his memory. \"Why the hell did I dream that?\" Justin asked himself, rubbing his brow. What he found most odd was how seductive Dream Mari was. Throwing back the covers, he went to the mirror and took a look at himself. Dark shadows crossed the bottoms of his eyelids, and his stubble was beginning to look more beardlike. It was definitely time to shave. Justin threw on a shirt and jeans and progressed downstairs to the kitchen where Emma was frying eggs. \"Hi, Justin!\" Emma smiled cheerfully at him as she spooned some eggs onto an empty plate. \"Have some breakfast.\" \"Thanks.\" He took the seat next to John and across from Mari. But something was different about her. She looked… normal. Her blonde locks were brushed and pulled back into a loose ponytail and she was actually wearing jeans and a shirt instead of her ghostlike nightgown. She flashed a smile at him, identical to the one Dream Mari had before she began to brutally murder him. Justin's blood ran cold. \"Hello, Justin,\" Mari said sweetly with a hint of malice hidden behind her eyes. \"Mari's so much better!\" Emma exclaimed as she momentarily stepped away from the stove to toss her daughter's hair. \"I think going through with her birthday party is an excellent idea!\" \"Birthday party?\" Justin raised an eyebrow. He knew when Mari's birthday was, but they'd never had a party for her. None of them had a birthday party since they became fugitives. \"Mari's turning 19 soon,\" John stated without looking up from the newspaper. \"It'll only be the four of us of course, but we can have a cake and other party stuff. Emma's in charge of that; I don't know much about parties.\" \"It'll be great! Just wait and see!\" Emma wrapped her arms around Mari in excitement. Mari's eyes met Justin's. \"Yes, just wait and see,\" she told him.[Chapter 3] Chapter 3: Beauty Never Lasts NOTE: OK, so the last chapter was a little short. I just wanted to put out something else. So after this is finished it looks like my next Fanfic will be a super messed up version of Fern Gully because one of my friends threatened to beat me up if I didn't write it, lol. After breakfast, Justin retreated to the lawn to do some yard work that Emma had requested. While his main place of employment was the local convenience store (which was incredibly ironic, as that was where he met Mari for the first time all those years ago), he helped out around the house on his days off. Under the circumstances that it was a blistering July morning and the Collingwoods had relocated to the Deep South (Georgia, to be more precise), Justin removed his t-shirt and threw it over a low hanging tree branch. A pair of teenage girls in Daisy Duke shorts and ponytails called out to him from the sidewalk. \"Hey there, Justin cutie! Can you spare a minute?\" Justin knew the girls from the convenience store. The ginger worked there and her brunette friend stopped in frequently with all sorts of gossip about people in the town. She was reason number one the Collingwoods needed to keep a low profile. \"But what if Aunt Em's flowers die in all this heat?\" Justin asked playfully. He had been masquerading as the Collingwoods' nephew. \"Oh don't be such a silly!\" the brunette, Mae, told him in her adorable southern drawl. \"Come over here! Annie and I have something real interesting to tell you!\" Justin smiled then proceeded to the waist high fence that surrounded the yard where Mae and Annie waited on the other side. \"Now what's so important that you need to keep me from my work?\" he asked with a wink. \"There's going to be a party this Saturday!\" Annie exclaimed excitedly. \"And Mae and I want you to come!\" \"Like a good ole fashioned hoe down?\" Justin inquired, feigning a Georgian accent. \"No silly!\" Annie tapped him playfully on the forehead. \"Like a beer drinking, pot smoking hoe down!\" Justin remembered his drinking/drug days very well. And the last time he touched a joint was the one he shared with Paige, who was murdered by his father later that night. He couldn't touch the stuff. It brought back too many memories. However, if Justin wanted to blend in, he needed to act like the other local teens and join in their fun. He could show up and drink a little, but the marijuana he refused to smoke. \"All right, girls, count me in. I'll need details.\" \"My barn. Eleven. It'll be a real good time,\" Mae said flirtatiously. \"Gotta go,\" Annie added as she blew a kiss. \"Work calls.\" And with that, the two southern belles strutted off. Justin returned to his work. In reality, he wasn't very interested in either girl, no matter how much he allowed them to flirt with them or how much he flirted back. What it came down to was the fact that they were girls. Both were probably 17 or 18, not much younger than Justin, but he had lived through far more Hell than they would ever encounter, combined. And because of that, Justin was a man. Real men don't settle for girls. Mari watched this whole scene from her bedroom window. \"What sluts,\" she said to herself. She continued watching after Tramp 1 and Tramp 2 flitted down the street. \"Back to the whorehouse with you!\" She watched as Justin retrieved the garden house and began watering her mother's flowers along the fence posts. She admired his delicious dark hair and tan muscles that began to glisten with sweat under the sizzling summer sun. As much as Mari hated to admit it, she was in love with Justin. And that is why he had to die. On top of wanting revenge on Justin's father, Mari also couldn't stand to feel so amorously about someone she was supposed to, no, MUST hate. As a result, she planned to kill him. She just hadn't figured out how that was going to happen. The rest of the day came and went and soon enough the sky became dark as the sun went to bed and the moon and stars came out to dance and play. Justin and the Collingwoods retired to their rooms for the night; however, John and Emma were the only ones who slept. Mari knew something was afoot the minute she saw the Bimbo Bitches come traipsing up the sidewalk like a couple of empty headed skanks. Mari thought that maybe if they spent less time on their back that they might have time for a decent education and maybe improve their chances in the real world. Mari watched from her window as Justin opened his bedroom window, crept onto the roof, and shut it behind him, leaving it slightly cracked so he could come back in when he returned. As soon as he carefully climbed onto the tree branches that hung next to the roof and made his way down and across the lawn and onto the sidewalk, Mari followed suit. She dressed in her nightgown only as a show for her parents. They minute they went to bed she shrouded herself mostly in black so that she may hide in the cover of night. Mari was mindful to stay a great distance behind Justin. He was far more observant than the average 19 year old male and would surely notice her if she wasn't careful. She followed him for a good long while, until they were out of town and in the country, and to a house with a barn behind it. It belonged to one of the whores, no doubt about it. Mari watched Justin enter the barn. She sneaked up to it and discovered a hole in the wood to peer through. Meanwhile, Justin had just arrived at the party. Well, \"party.\" It wasn't supposed to be happening so there was no loud music, no fancy lights, nothing very party oriented. All that was there was about three girls and two guys, not including Justin, sitting around smoking pot and guzzling their parents' pilfered beer. \"Justin honey!\" Mae greeted him with a kiss on the cheek. \"You're just in time. And I've got someone I'd like you to meet… Hey Liberty, come on over here!\" The other girl who was sitting next to Annie rose from her seat on a hay bale and came to meet Justin. \"Hi, I'm Liberty,\" she introduced herself, flashing two rows of gorgeous teeth. Justin's eyes quickly scanned over Liberty's body from top to bottom. Her hair was wavy but not curly and as yellow as the sun at high noon. Liberty's eyes were mysteriously colored a medium violet, a shade Justin had never seen before. Her skin tone was normal for a girl of the south, lightly tanned, which nicely complimented her hair. She bore a light pink button up jacket with sleeves that stopped at her lovely little elbows with a white camisole underneath. A pair of long, thin legs sprouted down from a pair of faded jean shorts. Liberty was beautiful. \"Do you speak?\" Liberty asked with a smile. She was used to her beauty stunning men into silence. Justin, who was usually not swayed by appearances, snapped his eyes back up to meet hers. \"Yeah, sorry. I'm Justin. Carter.\" The Collingwoods and Justin had assumed the alias \"Carter\" to make it more difficult to be tracked down. \"He's just a little shy,\" Annie added, jumping up to join her friends. \"Come on, Justin, have some fun with us.\" Mari knew the blonde bimbo was up to no good. You can never trust a girl whose boobs are about to bust out of their top. She watched as Justin took a seat beside Liberty and introduced himself to the two other males in the room, no doubt the bed buddies of the other two trashy wenches. About an hour went by and each teenager became tipsy, then drunk. The whole thing made Mari sick to watch, and she was almost sorry she came, especially when Liberty began to rub her hand up and down Justin's thigh. \"What do you say we take a little walk?\" Justin whispered into Liberty's ear. She smiled and nodded. \"We'll be right back, you guys!\" She grabbed his hand and the two raced out of the barn. Mari crouched down, hoping to remain unseen. Not that it mattered if they did see her; they were too drunk to make anything of it. \"Come here you sexy thing,\" Liberty cooed in her southern twang as she pushed Justin up against the barn wall and began to suck his neck. Mari was lying flat on the ground merely ten feet from where this disgusting act of affection was taking place. He dipped a hand inside her blouse, which made her squeal in pleasure. Mari couldn't look. She buried her head in her hands and was forced to listen as the acts got more and more sexual. After five minutes or so, she was sure they were having sex. Liberty's moans mixed with Justin's grunting noises made it too obvious. But of course, Mari wouldn't look. She couldn't. She'd kill both of them with her bare hands. After a few minutes more, the noises stopped and were replaced by panting and the sound of a zipper going up. The sexual escapade was over. It wasn't until Mari was sure that they were back in the barn that she peered back through the hole in the wood. A few more hours went by, and the teens began to sober up a little for they had run out of alcohol. Justin was the first to leave. \"Well guys, it's been fun but I've gotta go.\" \"Oh please don't leave!\" Liberty pouted as she pulled on his arm. \"We've had so much fun!\" \"I'll see you again, don't worry.\" He kissed her gently on the lips then exited the barn. Mari watched him go, but she didn't follow him home. She had other things to take care of. The other boys left after a while, leaving the three girls. \"You should go home, Annie,\" Liberty said after a while. \"You have to work tomorrow and Mae and I have to spend some quality cousin time together. I'll only be in Georgia for a few more days and then its home to Alabama. Besides, I need my sleep. I've got some more things I'd like to do before I go home and I'll never get them done if I sleep the day away.\" \"Oh, like fuck Justin,\" Annie mocked her jokingly. Liberty's face turned scarlet. \"I don't know what you're talking about!\" \"Oh hush, you. We could here you two when you 'went for a walk,'\" Mae said as she tossed her hair. \"Well you two can sit out here all night if you want to, I'm going to bed! I don't need to put up with this.\" And with that, Liberty turned and walked out of the barn. Mari saw her chance. With the mad ferocity of a mountain lion, Mari dashed and leaped at Liberty, knocking her to the ground. Temporarily dazed, Liberty did not even call out for help. Before her victim could realize what was going on, Mari picked up a decently sized rock from nearby and hit Liberty over the head with it, rendering her unconscious. She then proceeded to sit on top of the girl, straddling her. \"Why do girls have to be such sluts?\" Mari asked to no one in particular as she withdrew the pocket knife from her pocket she'd stolen from Justin's room. She'd brought it along for protection purposes, but it was not Mari who needed protecting. As it happened in Justin's dream, Mari began to carve the Glasgow Smile into Liberty's face, ruining it forever. \"You aren't so pretty now, are you?\" Mari knew she'd have to work fast, for Mae and Annie would soon emerge from the barn. If she'd had more time, Mari would've gotten more creative with her murder, but instead, she slashed Liberty's jugular and allowed her to bleed out. As soon as she was done, Mari rose and took off running toward home. She had just gotten out of sight when she heard the screams of Liberty's friends uncovering her disfigured body.[Chapter 4] Chapter 4: Unmasked NOTE: OK so hopefully this gets a few more positive reviews than chapter 3. Once again, my apologies. Hopefully I'll be writing a lot over the next few days because I really don't have much to do. But my dance team performs at Conseco Fieldhouse on Wednesday. YAY! :) The news was all around town by the next morning. A young girl had been brutally slain outside her cousin's barn. The story was on the front page of the local paper with a horrific picture of the body, which was normally uncommon for newspapers to do, but an exception was made in this case, partially for shock value, partially for the town to realize how serious the situation actually was. The article said that the police had no leads. This may sound completely idiotic considering that Liberty had hooked up with a guy at the party and he would, in any other situation, be the first one that the police would question. However, given the fact that the gathering was in Mae's barn, and she was definitely not supposed to be having a party, or smoking pot, or having a few beers, which were stolen from her father's fridge, Mae had made Annie help her in getting rid of the illegal substances, sent Annie home, and fabricated a story about how she and Liberty were in bed and Liberty decided to go out for a midnight stroll. To any other police department, this would probably sound completely fictionalized. However, since this was a small town where everyone knew each other, the police department decided to give Mae the benefit of the doubt and rule that a homicidal maniac was on the loose. If only this was the department that had been involved in the Amanda Knox investigation. Of course Mari could never be a suspect; no one outside the Collingwood family knew that she existed. They rarely had guests over, and when they did, Mari always stayed upstairs in her room. She was a phantom amongst the shadows. Justin found out about his deceased date when he arrived to work that morning. Annie was there before him, completely shaken up. \"What the hell happened to you?\" he asked sarcastically. She turned to him, eyes welled up with tears, and he realized that something really was wrong. \"Hey, hey, I was kidding, what happened?\" \"Liberty's dead!\" Annie pointed a shaking hand at the newspaper stand. Justin's brow furrowed as he picked one up. He felt his face grow pale as he gazed upon the photograph of his one night stand; the Glasgow Smile torn across her face. Just like in his dream. \"When the hell did this happen?\" Justin turned to Annie. \"We… We don't know! It was long after…\" she lowered her voice, \"long after you and the other guys left. Liberty wanted to go inside but Mae and I stayed behind. We followed only about five minutes later. And… that's when we found her. She was just lying there…\" Annie choked down a sob. \"Mae didn't want the cops to know what was going on in the barn or we'd all get busted so she told the police that she and Liberty were in bed and Liberty went out for a walk. They believed her. No one knows that you guys were there. We know you guys didn't do it.\" They didn't know him, not really anyway. For all they knew, Justin could've done it. After all, he was the son of a murderer. Appearances can be so deceiving. Meanwhile at the Collingwoods, Mari lay in bed staring up at the ceiling with Justin's bloody pocket knife under her pillow and was contemplating what to do with it. She could bury it of course, but her parents would be extremely suspicious if they found her digging up the yard. What else could she do but clean it and return it? Her mother was a tad less cautious of her now that Mari had begun to behave like a functioning member of society, so when an opportunity arose, Mari snuck off to the bathroom and began to clean the knife. She had to scrub a little since Liberty's blood had dried upon the blade. A smile crept across Mari's face as she recalled her little art project on Liberty's body. \"Women like that just don't deserve to live.\" After thoroughly cleaning the pocket knife, Mari put it back where she had found it inside Justin's bedroom. He never even knew it was missing. \"Mari, try these cake samples and tell me which you like best,\" Emma put two slices in front of her daughter the next night after dinner. \"Your birthday is three days away and I have no idea what kind of cake to make for you.\" \"I'm sure either will be fine,\" Mari told her, taking a very miniscule bite of each. \"But if I have to choose, I pick the vanilla.\" \"You're not going to eat the rest?\" John asked. Mari shook her head. \"Well in that case, dibs. Want any Justin?\" John asked as he pulled both pieces in front of him. Justin, who had been scrutinizing Mari, shifted his eyes to John. \"No thanks, I'm full.\" \"Wow, your loss!\" John and Emma began to engage in trivial conversation while Justin's gaze returned to Mari. Day by day she seemed to be getting better, but still he could not help but feel that something was dangerously wrong. As if on cue, Mari's eyes met his, as if confirming all his suspicions. Time stood still as the two locked eyes in a perpetual dance, as if the one knew precisely what the other was contemplating. The corner of Mari's mouth turned up ever so slightly in that sick, sadistic way of hers, the way everyone but Justin was blind to. \"I think I'm going to do some reading in my room,\" Mari broke the lock between herself and Justin. \"All right sweetheart! I'm so glad you're doing better,\" Emma hugged her. Justin's eyes trailed after Mari as she departed from the kitchen. He waited only moments before following her, as the remaining Collingwoods once again resumed their idle chatter. He cornered her right outside her bedroom, careful not to physically touch her, for fear that she'd scream. \"What the hell have you done?\" Justin inquired in a low growl. \"Why my dear Justin,\" Mari smiled innocently, \"I have no idea what you mean.\" Anger began to boil inside of him as he threw Mari against the wall, holding her in place with one hand, the other clapped over her mouth. \"Don't fuck with me,\" he told her. \"I know you, the real you, not the whiny bitch that everyone else thinks you are. I know what you're capable of and I know how sick and twisted you are. I don't know what you did, or even if you've even done anything yet, but you're definitely planning something and I'm going to put a stop to it.\" Sensing that she wouldn't scream, Justin lowered his palm, still mindful of holding her to the wall. \"Oh Justin, you think you're so clever,\" Mari purred at him. \"But really, who is going to believe you? If I cried out for help right now, Mom and Dad would run up here and see you and I like this… And what would they think?\" Knowing she was right, Justin released her. She slipped victoriously into her bedroom. \"You're not going to get away with this. I'll stop you before someone seriously gets hurt.\" An eerie chuckle escaped Mari's throat. \"Someone already has.\"[Chapter 5] Chapter 5: Satisfaction NOTE: Sorry it's been so long. Dance and junior year in high school have taken over my life. Mini update of my life: I have straight A's and my dance team made a music video that won a contest and we won $200! :D And we got to dance at Lucas Oil Stadium (That's where the Indianapolis Colts play if you were unaware). Also my high school football team is undefeated (7-0). It's a pretty good year. Justin lay awake that night thinking of Mari's sinister departing message. Who could she have been alluding to? The only person that came to mind was Liberty but… It couldn't be, could it? The next morning, Justin came to breakfast dressed in funeral attire. \"Liberty's funeral is today. I thought I'd go pay my respects.\" \"Was that the girl they found all chopped up in someone's barnyard?\" John asked nonchalantly between sips of coffee. \"How'd you meet her?\" \"I didn't. She was the cousin of an acquaintance of mine.\" Justin lied. \"I thought Mari might like to come with me to the funeral.\" The kitchen grew quiet. Even Mari stared back at him in surprise. \"No one knows that Mari is here,\" Emma said. \"How would you explain her?\" \"Easy. Everyone thinks that I'm your nephew. We can say that Mari is my sister and she's studying abroad but stopped by for a few days. Besides, Mari's been cooped up here so long, I think it'd be a good idea for her to get out and socialize.\" \"Mari's condition has improved… John, what do you think?\" Emma's husband glanced at their daughter. \"I think it'd be a fine idea. It's a little morbid to think that her first social outing is a funeral, but socialization could do wonders.\" Mari wanted to protest but she couldn't think of a good enough reason for not wanting to go, especially when her parents were so for it. An hour later, Mari was sitting in the passenger's side of Justin's truck dawning a lovely little black dress that she had borrowed from Emma. Much to Mari's dismay, Emma had also done her makeup. It'd been years since she'd worn makeup. Justin climbed in the driver's seat beside her and gave a quick glance. She was actually, well, sort of pretty. \"Don't you clean up nice?\" he asked sarcastically. She stuck her tongue out at him childishly. It was a rather innocent display for two very not innocent people. \"What the hell were you thinking? You knew I wouldn't want to go to some whore's funeral.\" Mari spat her words out like poison. Justin raised an eyebrow as he backed out of the driveway. \"What makes you think she was a whore? You didn't even know her.\" \"I'm a good guesser.\" The two drove along the lonely country road in silence for several minutes before Justin pulled the truck to the side of the road. \"You killed her, didn't you?\" An eerie smile crept across Mari's face. \"I think you already know the answer to that.\"[Chapter 6] Chapter 6: Fatal Attraction NOTE: Yeah, so I know the last chapter was kinda short. Think of it as an appetizer, lol. I have no idea where this story is going; it just comes as I go along. PS: This chapter has a lot of language so if you're just going to get offended and complain don't read it. Justin angrily gripped the steering wheel. \"You psychotic bitch!\" he hotly muttered. \"What's the matter? You don't want to miss the funeral do you?\" Mari inquired as if nothing had happened. \"This wouldn't have even happened if it weren't for you!\" Justin turned to her furiously. \"Everything is always your fucking fault! We're in hiding because of you; all anyone ever cares about is you! It's always about you! I don't know what your fucking problem is. Of all people, you should know how wrong it is to murder. You watched your best friend die right in front of you, yet here you are, years later, guilty of a murder, and for no good reason!\" Mari's eyes widened in shock; she hadn't anticipated this kind of reaction from him. \"In case you've forgotten,\" she retorted as she threw open the passenger door, \"We're in hiding because your father was a fucking cunt.\" Mari slid out the door, slamming it behind her, and disappeared in the tall emerald cornstalks that surrounded the road. Justin sat there in silence and gathered his thoughts. While it was true that he was angry with Mari for murdering Liberty for no apparent cause, he was also mad at himself for blaming things on her that she had no control over. After all, it was Justin's father who had kidnapped Mari, murdered her best friend, raped her, and traumatized her for life. When Mari's parents killed Krug and his friends, it was purely out of revenge. Mari hadn't laid a hand on any of them herself. Maybe he'd been a little short with her, but she did commit a murder. Justin knew he couldn't turn her in. He probably wouldn't even have to tell the Collingwoods. John would want to pick up and move before the police started sniffing around about a murder investigation. They couldn't risk the cops finding anything about their past. Putting his moral dilemmas aside, Justin decided to attend the funeral, merely for a brief amount of time, to keep up appearances. Mari could find her own way home, and he was in no mood to go looking for her. Meanwhile, Mari hadn't gone as far as Justin had thought she did. In fact, she was only four rows back, peering at him from the confines of the cornstalks. She wasn't really expecting him to come after her, but she was utterly shocked when he hit the gas and drove away, leaving her to fend for herself. When he was gone, she emerged from the rows and stood in the middle of the road, contemplating her next move. Mari was hurt by Justin's accusations, yet in her heart she knew they were true. Secretly, she had been blaming herself for her family's misfortune. However, Justin's words only made her want to kill him sooner. \"Stupid jerk. Should've killed him weeks ago,\" Mari muttered through angry tears as she turned and headed for home. The funeral was very mundane, and Justin was beginning to wish he had went after Mari instead of going. On top of that, it was quite uncomfortable to hear people whisper and wonder about who Liberty's murderer was when Justin was the only one who knew. On the drive home, it occurred to him that if he showed up without Mari, the Collingwoods would wonder what had happened, and Justin would have to explain their fight, or at least come up with a pretty damn good excuse. Fortunately, that situated was avoided when he passed Mari lingering on the sidewalk a few houses down from home. \"Couldn't go home?\" Justin asked monotonically as he opened the door for her. A crimson hue came across her cheeks. \"Didn't feel like explaining anything.\" He didn't blame her for not wanting to go home without him, but he was still furious with her over Liberty's murder. The minute Justin and Mari stepped in the door of the Collingwood's home, they were bombarded with questions. \"What was the service like?\" \"Did you meet any people?\" \"No one asked too many questions, did they?\" \"Did you have fun?\" Emma asked. \"It wasn't supposed to be fun, it was a funeral,\" Justin told her. \"The girl who died was fairly young, wasn't she?\" John asked. \"How exactly did she die?\" \"She was murdered,\" Mari murmured. The tension in the air grew thick. \"Murdered?\" Emma's face grew pale. \"We'll have to leave, we have no other choice. The police will be conduction an investigation and they could uncover something about us.\" \"We'll have to be discreet,\" John chimed in. \"If we suddenly uproot and move for no apparent reason, we'll look suspicious. We have to devise a plan.\" Mari and Justin were dismissed to their rooms as John and Emma sat in the kitchen discussing their next move. Justin placed a hand on Mari's shoulder as she prepared to enter her room. \"You and I need to talk.\" She followed him into his room and he closed the door behind them. \"Well, what do you want?\" Mari asked defensively, arms crossed. \"Why did you do it?\" \"Do what?\" \"You know what.\" The pair stood in silence for a moment, eyes locked. \"She deserved to die,\" Mari answered nonchalantly. Justin stared at her in disbelief. Rage suddenly overtook him and he rushed at her, slamming her into the wall. \"No one deserves to be murdered,\" he growled at her through clenched teeth. \"You watched your best friend get brutally slaughtered and this is how you repay her, by killing others! You, Mari Collingwood, are a waste of space.\" He released her. \"She was a whore. I'm surprised you couldn't see it. Or maybe you were too drunk to care,\" she snarled back at him. \"You followed me.\" \"No duh, Sherlock. How else do you think I got to her? Did you think I just happened to be out for a stroll and decided to jump her? Of course I followed you.\" \"But why?\" \"Why not?\" Justin released long groan of aggravation as he ran his fingers through his hair and through himself on the bed, facing the ceiling. \"You don't make any fucking sense. You are one messed up bitch.\" Mari walked to the bed and laid herself on top of Justin, who was very surprised by this action. She leaned down and whispered into his ear, \"You have no idea.\" ","Summary":" NOTE: So this is my first Fanfic in about… 3 years? I forgot how much I liked writing them. :) Yeah"},{"Movie":"Last House on the Left","Title":"When She Smiles","Author":"iwrite.org","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7372828","Passage":"[Chapter 1] I often wondered what I've done in my past life to be so lucky. I must have helped Lincoln come to his decision in 1776, or planted the liberating ideas into J.F.K's head, or wrote songs for Lennon and speeches for M.L.K. Whatever I did, it was paying off beautifully. In the early summer of 2011, I had already managed to graduate from the Rhode Island School of Design, least a galleria with money I saved by selling some paintings, and most importantly, I had just gotten engaged to the most beautiful woman alive. The sky was my limit. Little did I know, my sky was not as far as the average sky? I met her through mutual friends at a birthday party on January 15th of this year, 2011. It was a small gathering held in a local café near Brown University. I'm usually a sports bar kind of guy so I didn't plan to stay there long. I arrived alone and made a beeline to the birthday girl just to hand her a gift of perfume wrapped horribly in a silk scarf. Ana and I were friends since we were little so I knew she wouldn't be disappointed in my decision to leave her party so early. To no surprise, Ana excused my casual rudeness and allowed me to leave with a clear conscience. The place was already crowded and full of Ivy League brats with silver spoons, million dollar looks, and condescending attitudes. Not a place for a starving artist with a plastic spoon. I hated the music being played in the background. Classical music should not be allowed on ipods or any technological devices made after the 90s. As I was walking towards the exit of the café's door, I instinctively glanced to my right and saw her. My entire body froze and I had to meet this beautiful human. She was sitting in the corner all alone like a wallflower. Her eyes were off in a distance yet it still sparkled. A blonde with hair at neck's length and sapphire blue eyes had just grabbed my attention in a way no one ever has. \"Hi, I really want to tell you my name,\" I remember telling her before she introduced herself as Mari Collinsgworth. I was always a cocky son of a bitch. My confidence came from my parents and their constant build up of their future Pablo Picasso. I'm also an only child so I do not know how not to be the center of attention. Although, I never consider myself as a narcissist, my friends often diagnose me with the mental disease of being one. All in all, my arrogant approached towards Mari managed to win me her phone number. I called her number as soon as I returned to my empty and half painted studio apartment. Walking into my place a conjoined living room and kitchen with a mini fridge and a two seated sofa as its only accessories greeted you at the door. My bedroom had only a mattress and closet full of canvases, paint, shoes, clothing, and broken laptops. I kept most of my sell worthy paintings in a storage. It was small yet cozy, just about the only place I've ever felt comfortable living. Looking back, I realized that calling Mari so soon was cheesy and the opposite of game playing. I was never one to play around. This girl was the one. She was leaving the party when I called and we ended up setting our first date in motion. Because I was a stranger to her, she insisted that we meet somewhere nice and in the open. I suggested that she and I attend an art show downtown, a show that I was already invited to days ago. \"That sounds a little boring but ok, I guess it'll be fun…\" I remember her agreeing in a stolen laughter. The first few dates with Mari would consume my heart and I began falling in love incredibly fast. She was everything I ever wanted in a woman. She laughed at my ridiculously lame jokes and even made jokes within them. Every time I called her she came running. Mari had this grace about her presence that almost appeared angelic. I've never known a calmer person. It was as if she were on relaxation pills every time we interacted. Mari was quiet when we went in and shy when we went out, I loved that about her. I loved a lot about Mari Collingsworth. I loved her beautifully hidden smile, her soft and lavender scented hair, her passion for my art, and so much more. She was a pre-med major and worked her tail off to maintain an acceptable G.P.A at Brown. She taught me so much about the human anatomy. I taught her about art. She even redecorated my apartment by painting my walls \"in color\", she chose a dark purple and I went overboard by painting our faces on the wall. We took that on as a project that lasted an entire Saturday. That day in particular, was one of the most memorial moments in our relationship. Relationship ... I remembering calling Mari and I a \"relationship\" but Mari only referred to us as a \"friendship\". It wouldn't bother me until after out 7th date. Technically, it wasn't our 7th date because she was at my apartment almost every night. We would watch movies, play the wii, eat dinner, and I would even help her study. I confronted Mari on the \"friendship\" theory by taking her to my place and planting a kiss on her lips. That was the moment everything changed. I didn't realize how regrettable that action would be at that point. Looking back… \" So is it me or did I overhear you tell someone that you and I have a rare friendship\", I tease Mari while grabbing her hands gently. \"It's true, Brennan, I really think that we have something rare. Lately I've been drowning myself in my studies and I had no time for life but you came and changed that. Altogether. I cannot tell yiou what these past few weeks have been for me,\" she confesses. For the following seconds after she admits this to me, I only stare at Mari, confusingly. I search her eyes for hope that she will say something remotely closer to love instead of friendship but to no avail. I bring her closer towards me by pulling her hands to my waist. I feel her shake terribly but I don't notice how bad until after I stick my tongue down her throat. \" No you can't do this\", I hear her scream as she pushes shockingly away. I look at her frame to see that it's violently shaken. What did I do? Tears swell her red eyes and she stares at me like I'm some monster. I try to think of something to reassure her but she's in a state of shock. Lost in the moment…She wasn't seeing me and she was becoming unrecognizable. We were now strangers to each other because of one stupidly unrequited kiss. \"I'm sorry\", it was the only right thing to say, \"I scared you, and I didn't mean to, I'm sorry Mari.\" My words were true and as I poured them out sincerely. I could feel the tears form in my eyes as I desperately stared into her beautiful face. My pleas were somehow heard as Mari blinks her eyes back into the moment. \" It's, it's late, I have to leave,\" she reveals before running off into the night, leaving me stricken with worry and extreme curiosity.[Chapter 2] She's out of my life. She's out of my life. And I don't know rather to laugh or cry. I don't know rather to live or day and it cuts like a knife, she's out of my life. After that night, I waited an entire day to give her some space, wishfully thinking she would contact me the next day. It was hell without her. I couldn't stop thinking about her soft hands and how they would glaze my skin peeling hands from time to time. I couldn't stop smelling the lavender perfume she always wore. I saw her face every time my eyes closed and every time it opened. I began sketching her face just to keep her in my memory. I must have a hundred sketches of Mari's face. I missed her. I miss how she would stare at me for minutes while I would quiz her on the human body parts. I miss how she would stop my heart whenever she would walk into any door. There were times when I would get the urge to touch her when she would sit too close to me. The next day came and went but no word from Mari. Another day passed and Mari still hadn't contacted me. I tried calling, texting, and even heading down to Brown to reach her but she became unreachable. When a whole week passed, I started going half crazy. I missed her too much to just give up on what little chemistry we had. If she was any other girl I've dated, I would have just kept moving. I spent my mornings researching Mari on social networks but she only had an undated twitter account. My days were devoted to badgering her friends on her whereabouts which was a waste because her friends knew nothing. Things were getting strange as her friends made it seem like Mari lived a double life. \"She's a private person, most of us are only friends with her on the surface, she never really talks about herself,\" one friend revealed to me, and it was true. Mari never talked about her past; it was always her present and future. One evening, I went home and binged on sleeping pills, it was something I did from time through time. When the over-the-counter sleeping pills would hit my bloodstream, for some reason unknown, my brain would overly focus on one thing. This time it focused on Mari's \"secret life\". She never talked about her family, ever. Maybe she was an orphan, but wouldn't that be something she should have told me. I always told her about my past. I even confided in her about my insecurities that developed in middle school because of bullying. Maybe she didn't want to get too close to me because I'm Jewish. Could she be Anti-Semitic? No…She was too warm to hate anything. If I hadn't kissed her, would she be here now? Probably…I'm such an idiot. I have to find her, I just have too.\" And I will walk around this world to find her, and I don't care what it takes, no. I'll sail the seven seas to be near her, so if you happen to see her, tell her this for me: One more chance at love. …. I allowed the cold snow to fall onto my curly black hair as I head out into the night. It was now Valentine's Day and weeks without Mari so I encouraged myself to go out and live. My hair had grown inches longer and I was a striking resemblance to Moses. My heart was hurting, my hands were frozen, my nose was red, and my feet brought me back home. When I arrived there, I realized that I left my cell on the sofa. I check my missed calls and to my surprise, Mari called. I kicked myself for not being available. Fuck, I guess I thought she would never actually call back . I hurry as fast as I could to return a call she made 3 hours ago, hoping she would answer. \"Mari,\" I ask seconds after the other line finish ringing. \"Brennan, hey…\" she replies in an audible tone. \"I didn't think you wanted to ever hear from me again. It's nice to hear your voice.\" \"Yeah, I'm sorry about that, disappearing. I just needed to sort some things out.\" \"Like what,\" I pause for a few seconds but she doesn't answer. \"Mari, if there is something you want to tell me, something important, then I won't judge you. I won't think of you in any other way. Ok? All I want is to stop missing you and in order to do that; you need to stay in my life.\" I hear Mari chuckle from the other line. It was good to hear her laugh. The late of the night forbidden her to leave her dorm room so we agreed to meet tomorrow morning for breakfast. I wished her a happy valentines and she did the same. I wanted to talk with her longer but I guess I could wait for the morning.[Chapter 3] The next morning I sat in my living room admiring the self portrait of myself and Mari on the walls. The Rhode Island snow amuses me through my only window. The birds chirp loudly as they migrate to a much warmer climate. I felt that this day would be a good day. I make plans in my head to walk up to the roof later and paint the snowy Rhode Island town. To avoid intense anticipation, I get up from the couch and walk into the kitchen to brew coffee. Before I can turn the coffee pot on, I hear knocking at my door. It was her, it was Mari. \"Hey,\" she greets me at the door with that hidden smile. \"Come in, please,\" I hear my voice trying hard to sound less needy. She enters and heads straight for the sofa. Before I sit spaces next to her, I close my apartment door for privacy. For minutes, we sat there in silence. I decided not to speak first and wait until she does. I can hear her breathe in normal breaths as my respiration intensifies from nervousness. Ber familiar lavender scent sends tingles up and down my back. I feel her watching me as my eyes focuses shyly on my dark grey carpet floor. This causes my heart to pound loudly and I wonder if she hears the beat, the thuds. I couldn't take it anymore. \"About the other night, or the other month, I'm not clear on how long it was…Mari I want to personally apologize for that kiss. I should have asked your permission, I won't make excuses but I thought you felt that way because I know I do, I mean I did.\" I reveal while looking straight into her beautiful blue eyes. Carefully I watch as she hesitates to speak. There was something in her eyes that's always been there since I met her, but I'm just discovering what it is truly; something horrible, something hidden, something dark, and something heinous. \"You remind me of my brother,\" she begins to finally open up about her life, \"you even look like him and um….my brother, Ben. He died a few years ago and I miss him everyday…I would never try to substitute you in the place of my brother but because of your striking similarities, I realized it would be a really, really bad idea if I just cut you out of my life so early,\" she pours out in exasperation. \"I'm just so relieved that you are even talking to me about your family. I'm so sorry about your brother, death is a horrible tragedy. When I lost my uncle to cancer, it cut me like a knife…We're you and your brother close.\" \"He was my best friend, my biggest fan, and we were inseparable.\" \"May I ask how he…\" \"He was involved in a car accident, the other driver was high on drugs and my brother happened to be the one impacted worse.\" Mari eyes light up as she speaks of her brother. As for me, I'm sitting on the sofa looking at this wonderful human being in a different light. I feel a sense of comfort come over me as she lets me in her world piece by piece. I decide to continue digging into her family tree to keep up the rhythm. \"Do you have any other siblings or are you an only child like me.\" \"It was just me and Ben. Another reason we were so close.\" \"You never talk about this stuff to me. What about your parents? Who are they? Where are they from, where are you from,\" I babble anxiously. \"My parents are living in Europe. My dad works at a clinic in Berlin; he's a doctor and my mom writes children books. She was a college professor but I guess she values writing over teaching. \" \"Are you close to your parents?\" Mari takes in this question and stares at her hands with a long pause. I can't read the reaction on her face because it's beyond blank . Did I say something wrong? Here I am again, overstepping. \"If it wasn't for my parents, I would not be sitting here today…I owe them my life,\" Mari's head faces mine as her haunting eyes look into mine. Usually when someone tells me they owe another their lives, I never take it in literal terms. However, the way Mari's words slid firmly off of her tongue, I had to wonder what she meant. \"Mari, I want to know you everything about you, from the moment you were born to now,\" I sound like an overactive 7 years old. \"I'm not that interesting Brennan, not at all,\" she confesses with an innocent smile. \"Anyone who says that their life isn't interesting usually means the opposite which is, their life is interesting,\" I slouch down into the couch fully comfortable and assured now that Mari's back into my bubble. Unfortunately, just as my body relaxes, her body tense up. Looks like I've bit another button. \"I'm as normal as you are,\" she reveals. I laugh to lighten the mood, \"We'll you're normally weird because that's how normal I am.\" I'm at ease when I hear her beautiful laughter escape from her heart. I decide to discontinue the investigating of Mari Collingwood and just enjoy her presence. She didn't stay as long as I wanted her to stay. After all, it was after midnight and I was hopeful because I would see her tomorrow and the next day, and the next day after that, and so on. I ended up falling to sleep on my sofa with my head lying on the spot where Mari sat. It smelled like her and I know it's creepy but it was my lullaby for the night.[Chapter 4] The passing weeks, everything between Mari and I went back to normal. Sure we were still \"just\" friends hanging out on a daily basis but I was one million percent more in love. I could tell that she liked me as well but it wasn't until last weekend when I realized that like was something more. We were out bowling with some of my friends when my ex girlfriend Bailee shows up coincidentally. Now, Bailee Adler and I had been dating for two years but ended the romance when she found someone other guy with a bigger bank account. Ok, that's not the only reason she left me but it is the only reason that matters. Continuing, Bailee and the guy are supposedly broken up and hearing it through the grapevine, she wants me back. The way she couldn't keep her hands and eyes off of me sort of convinced me that she indeed wants me back. Shameless. \"Hey, you're up. If you get at least a spare then we win the game, so don't feel the pressure,\" I tell Mari as I wait for her precious laughter. \"Right,\" she fires back with a hint of non chalant concern in her voice. Something was not right with her and after this incredibly weird night, I think I knew her damage. I watch her bowl the smaller pink bowling ball down as it aimed for a strike. It was Mari, myself, and my long time friend Reggie who were on team against Bailee, and my two former roommates, Sean and Hayden. When Mari's strike won the game, Reggie and I cheered as I watched Mari quickly engage in a conversation with Bailee. My heart slightly pounded faster than it should when Mari grabbed her coat, purse, and stormed out without saying goodbye. All in five minutes or so. \"What did you say to her,\" I quickly confront Bailee who's facial expression is as puzzled as mines. Shaking my head, I graze pass Bailee and rush out the door, hoping to catch Mari before it's too late. The night air was cold and the fog was deep and shallow. The bowling alley was the only building with lights in the middle of abandon buildings, trees, and stray animals. My vision was magnificent as I spot Mari heading to her car. She was upset and I had some explaining to do. \"Are you leaving? Don't leave,\" I beg. She opens her car door but turns to me, giving me her undivided attention. \"Brennan, I don't belong here. I mean, these are your friends and that's perfectly normal if you wanna hang out with them but this was a bad idea,\" she confesses. I don't understand her logic but I weigh in anyway, \"this is about Bailee? She and I are over,\" I conclude. Mari's sudden yet calming smile surprises me, \"this is not about her. I honestly didn't have a good time tonight. Next time, maybe we should just hang out alone. I'm sorry, I have to get back to the dorm. Goodnight Brennan.\" I watch her drive away into the fog, praying that she makes it back to her dorm safely. When I can no longer see the back lights of her car, I walk back into the building confused. Maybe she wasn't jealous of Bailee. Maybe she just didn't have a good time. I know I asked her to come tonight and she came relentlessly. Everytime we went out, even with just the two of us, she would never appear to be enjoying herself. I'm not an extrovert and I am far from a socialite but I do enjoy getting out from time to time. Mari, however, seems to hate it all together. As I inch my way back inside, I meet Bailee at the door. Before I can apologize for accusing her of sending Mari off, she begins to speak. \"Mari seems to really like you Brenn. I mean not every girl would push another girl on someone they obviously care for,\" Bailee's words shock me. \"What are you talking about?\" I follow Bailee back outside warming up my frozen white fingers. \"She likes you Brenn. She told me so. She says something about me being a better person for you than she and all that junk. Guess she saw all that flirting you did with me tonight and gave up,\" Bailee teases. I grab her right shoulder with my left hand and stop her from getting to her car. \"Listen, you were the only one doing any flirting tonight Bailee and I'm not curious to know why. All I want to know is this. What the hell were you saying to Mari in there?\" I want answers but in the usual Bailee Adler fashion, all I get is the back of her head, legs, and feet as she walks away. I get home an hour later wondering what Mari meant by pushing Bailee into my arms (if it even happened that way). Could it be that Mari wants me to be with Bailee so my focus can switch? Does she think that she isn't enough for me and that Bailee is? I wreck my brain with questions. Or, is it so that she likes me like I like her but is too shy to make any moves? Because if she told Bailee to persue me then that means she's running away from me. And if she's running away from me then that means that she likes me. She likes me! After that weekend, last weekend, Mari only called me but never came over. I didn't let this bother me as I would have previously because I had my own thing going on at this time. I was selected to paint a self protrait of the Senator's first born son. An honor in which took up about all my time. For nine days, I ate dinner, went golfing, attended social events, and painted with the political, rich, famous, and infamous citizens of Rhode Islands. My parents were so proud they threaten to come down from Utah to visit but luckily grand dad was undergoing hip surgery. The last day and the final touchings of a sleeping baby Thomas's protrait, the senator's wife invited me to a very luxiourious resturant. A resturant where you have to wear suits, ties, and ball gowns just to eat breakfast. A resturant where the eggs cost over one hundred bucks. A resturant that I would critize in laughter with Mari whenever we would talk again. However, the food was amazing, I didn't have to pay a dime, and it was my chance to grab some other rich clients. The Senator's wife got up to powder her nose, leaving me alone at the table with her black card, in case the server brings the check. As I gaze at all the pampered faces, I notice a rather strange thing. A guy wearing black sitting alone at a table. It was strange because he didn't have on a suit nor tie. He looked as if he was a normal guy from a rock band. By mistake, I lock eyes with him but rapidly look away. His eyes were cold, like a serial killer's, but sad like an abused child. I now focus on the server who's walking towards me with the check. \"The check sir,\" he says as he hands me the bill. \"One hundred and fifteen dollars? And there are little African children starving for five cent rice,\" I say, getting a laugh out of the older server who looks as if he's spent his better years serving the ungrateful wealthy. \"I'll be right back with your card, sir.\" I stand to my feet, preparing to just grab the card, and meet the Senator's wife outside. I was more than ready to get home and hit up the online stores with all this money I've made. Within seconds later, the server brings back the card. I speed out of the closed up yet elegantly decorated resturant and into the hall that leads to the foyer. I decide to wait for the Senator's wife there. I watch the passerby's in their minks, and furs as they greet me like i'm their equal for about three minutes. \"Ah, Mr. Gross. Did you pay for our amazing lunch,\" I hear the Senator's wife ask. I turn to her with a calm nodding of my head, \"Yes, ma'am. Thank you so much for lunch,\" I say graciously. \"Did you tip him,\" my mouth drops as I didn't expect that question. Picking my mouth up, I nod no as I watch her face turn to dissappointment, \"I forgot. Excuse me,\" I say before making my way back into the resturant. \"A tip? A tip really? You pay hundreds of dollars on things that normal people pay two bucks on and you're worried about a tip? Classic,\" I say out loud as I rush down the ever so elegant halls. When I get closer, I discontinue talking loudly to myself, and take out ten bucks from my own wallet. I usually tip two dollars so this is a come up for myself. I stand by the host's (who isn't there) stand to spot our waiter but I don't see him anywhere. My eyes then focuses on the customers and I try to spot the weird guy wearing no suit. He's still there but he's now talking to some blonde chick who's also in regular clothes. This place isn't as fancy as I thought or as they put on, \"wait a second!\" I say out loud as my entire body feeds off of the nervousness in my stomach. I squinch my eyes to make clear of the visual and when I do, I realized that the blonde sitting with the weird guy was Mari?[Chapter 5] I arrived home rolled up in a ball of confusion. After staring at the gentle touches, caring nods, and that sweet kiss Mari gave the strange guy in the fancy resturant, I decided I had enough. I said my goodbyes to the senator's wife, avoided the cab she paid to take me home, and just opted to walk instead. The resturant was about forty-five minutes away from my apartment but I just didn't care. The bad thing? The rain attacked me from the gloomy skies and I was soaked. I was soaked, I was feeling betrayed and I was definitely confused. It was like a bad romantic movie from the eighties. Mari had a boyfriend. Mari was taken. Mari would probably never be mine. I refused to call her and confront what I saw. I was angry. I saw her kiss his cheeks, caress his arms, and look into his eyes deeper than she has ever looked into mine. There was a connection between them so strong. A stranger could tell that those two had something special, something untouchable. In some ways, a stranger did. I was the stranger, however. I had no idea who Mari really was and I was growing weary of trying to find out. Heading to my shower, I tear off my clothes and allow the water to fall warmly on my shivering body. I could have the cold by now, dealing with soaking wet clothes. I scrub my body just enough to erase the filth, stinch, and bacteria off. It doesn't take that long to clense myself and when I'm done, I finally shave the Moses beared I've been sporting for weeks. It's always liberating to exfoliate. It's been a long day. I crash on my sofa waiting for sleep to take me over. One minutes passes. Five minutes passes. Forty-five minutes passes. An hour or so passes. Nothing. Where are you sleep? I sit up and realizes the heavy burden weighing on my mind. It's keeping me up and I won't sleep until it's lifted. I have to call Mari. \"Hey Bren,\" I hear her soft voice through the other line and my heart melts. Pausing for thirteen seconds, I try to think of the words to say but fail. \"Brennan, are you ok?\" The sound of my breathing vexes me, \"hey,\" I finally speak. \"Is everything ok,\" she continues the conversation. \"I'm ok. I just can't sleep. What are you doing?\" \"I'm in bed. Not sleeping, just doing some homework.\" \"How was your day?\" \"It was ok, I guess. How was yours?\" Her voice becomes suspicious. \"Mari. I have to be honest to you about something ok?\" Clearing her throat, \"Ok.\" \"I saw you today. I saw you at that resturant, um I think it's called Guza's? You were with this guy and I just want to know if he's-\" Mari stops me firmly, \"I'll come over. We can talk then.\" The line goes dead. Whoever this person was, he was important enough to deserve a face to face introduction. This made me feel both relieved and worried. It made me feel relieved because I build up the urge to ask, she wasn't offended, and the weight was lifted. It made me worried because that guy could actually be her boyfriend and where would I stand? On the bright side, if she had a boyfriend then she wouldn't be spending so much time with the Brenmister. On the dark side, the guy was probably in the army and returned all of a sudden. I agonized as the minutes of waiting transpires. I'm wearing only a robe so cover my body with a grey t-shirt and cookie monster pajama pants. I grab a drink of o.j from my vacant fridge and drink the entire pint. I walk back towards the sofa and slouch down. I laugh out loud as I feel sleep in my bones. Of course I get sleepy now, when Mari's on her way . Closing my eyes, I try to imagine the impending conversation between myself and Mari. It, of course, ends with her fucking my brains out. I'm ashamed at the thought of Mari and I having sex because of her innocent childlike self. I realize that I often have fantasies of Mari and I in various sexual positions. I chose not to entertain any of those dirty thoughts of such a clean person. One knock. Three knocks. I hope up to get the door to find something I wasn't expecting.[Chapter 6] As the door swings open from my alarming push, I gasp at the sight. In an instant, I feel like I've enter a twlight zone. Blinking my eyes repetitiously, I'm at a lost for words, once again. \"Hi. Can we come in?\" I hear his voice but never thought to match that voice with that face. I imagined his voice being deep and haunting. A strong baritone that screamed confidence and power. Instead, his voice appears audibly weak, like a scared teenage boy. My door isn't cracked open. My door is halfway open. \"We?\" I finally open my mouth after staring down the weird guy from the fancy resturant. I'm confused as to why he would ask if \"we\" could come in when all I see standing in my hallway was him . I didn't know this guy and I wasn't about to let him into my apartment, friend of Mari or not. I realize that i'm sweating nervously. My mind wonders why Mari would lie and agree to come over to talk in person but send her strange friend instead. Suddenly my heart finds its normal rhythm when I hear, \"it's ok Bren, Justin's cool.\" Mari's tiny frame was standing behind the tall and heavier weighted guy. I was so focused on the guy (apparently named Justin) that I never noticed Mari. She escapes from Justin's shadow and invites herself inside my apartment, in which Justin follows. I stand in the doorway incredibly puzzled. I needed answers! \"Justin? Wait? Who are you?\" I become flustered and begin repeating the same questions as the two guest make themselves comfortable in my apartment. The door closes mysteriously and I find myself closed up in a room with not one but two strangers. Mari is becoming more and more of a stranger to me even though I try not to admot that cold hard fact. \"Justin is my brother Brennan...Not biologically but in every other way that matters...My parents adopted him three years ago. He lives in Boston, he's a student at M.I.T. He's here visiting me for a few days.\" My mouth drops after I hear myself say, \"I don't believe you.\" The look of stupefaction washes over Mari's beautiful face as she takes in the first negative feedback I've given her since we met, \"you don't believe me?\" Mari's words comes out in a tiny voice and my heart loses control. \"I tell you everything about me. I tell you my birthday, my astrological sign, my fears, my goals, my past. My past, especially my past. My family, friends, relationships. My feelings for you Mari...You never tell me anything except that I remind you of your brother Ben, who died because of a drunk driver. You don't like people who drive drunk-you didn't tell me that but I can concur it...You-you never let me in and now he's your adopted brother. You expect me to believe this and just accept it...We've been in this? Whatever it is? A friendship..Yes, a friendship. We've been here for weeks and I just don't feel as if I know who you are but you know me. And that's not fair...\" I slouch onto the middle of the same sofa Justin and Mari were already sitting comfortably. For a second, I glance at Mari's hands. When I was a boy I would always prepare myself for the wind to blow the leaves on the cypress trees. I loved to see the gentle wind shake the leaves as if it would make them dance. Her hands were like the leaves on those cypress trees, nonetheless, the wind that blew to shake her hands were not as gentle. Yet, her hands did dance to a painful melody. What was that melody? \"I'm sorry-I...\" Mari interupts my sudden apology with a soft touch on my forearm. She nods once towards Justin as if she's giving him the 'okay' to lead the conversation. Staring into Justin's cold dead eyes, I wait for him to say something. Anything. However, minutes of silence pass and I get agitated, once more, with the cat and mouse game their playing. \"Mari-..,\" I silence myself as I face a tear face drowning Mari. I've never seen her like this before. Her tears continued to flow as she roughly wiped them with the soft tissue from her purse. \"What's wrong?\" I wonder . \"You ever heard the story about the modern day Bonnie and Clyde..?\" Justin turns his attention away from Mari and towards me after asking that question. I assume his question has something to do with why Mari's so upset so I humor him, \"which one? I mean there are so many.\" \"I'm talking about the one involving the missing girl Paige Daley in Westport, Connecticut? Kruger Joseph and Sadie Hennings?\" The story Justin tells comes to my mind with familiarity, so I only nod in agreement as Mari clenches tightly to my arm. \"I know the story. They killed two cops, turned around and killed a young girl-Paige Daley. Stabbed her to death and just left her in the woods...Then they're never caught, no one ever see them again. I know the story, I mean, who doesn't know the story. Kinda scary, like a real horror movie.\" As I elaborate with Justin to direct him faster to his point in bringing the mythical story up, I can't help but to glance at Mari from time to time. The story of Paige Daley was more horrorifying than sad to me because her killers were never caught. There was so many different stories of what actually happened to Kruger and Sadie around that time. Some said that the couple left town and changed their identity. Others believe that the two killed themselves in a way that there would be no way of finding their bodies. I always thought that they never really left town and that they were still in those woods. Wherever they are, whoever they were wasn't really relevent to who Justin was or why Mari keeps her life so hidden. Or was it?[Chapter 7] As Justin and I continue to elaborate on the sick tale of the modern day Bonnie and Clyde, Mari's eyes drift off into another place. My attention falls on her after she lets out the saddest sigh I've ever heard. For a long moment, everyone is in silence. I felt as if there was an elephant in the room but at the same time, I feel that a bomb is about to drop. \"Why are you telling me this,\" I turn to Justin while trying not to allow my eyes to fall of Mari's. Justin notices the confusion in my eyes and allows his sympathy to show. Tilting his head so that his long black hair would stop bothering his vision of site, Justin lets out a brief sigh, \"look, you're obviously someone very important to my sister...Very important to her if she asked me to tell you about this.\" It's funny how the human heart reacts to anticipation. The blood in your veins runs warm but that feeling is only abstract. Beads of sweat form on your forehead but you only notice that if you touch the salty fluid. The heart, however, the heart's reaction to anticipation is the most obvious. Fast. Disorderly. I listen as my heart frantically beats for something that I have no knowledge yet of knowing. For something that is apperantly a difficult perception. The sound of thuds. Thuds, and then some more thuds. More thuds. Thuds until, \"Kruger Joseph...\" Justin's voice managed to stop the pounding for a second. However, the long pause he takes after saying Kruger Jospeh's name does not help the additional pounding loudly in my ear. Justin's cold eyes becomes sad and mysterious as tears begin to form. My eyes focuses on both him and Mari at this point. In some way, Mari tries to disguise her tears by covering her eyes with her blonde hair. It's as if she doesn't want me to see her cry and also, she doesn't want me to see her, at all. \"Mari? Why are you?...Whatever it is guys? Just tell me, don't leave me in all this suspense,\" I cry. To my surprise, Mari lifts her sullen head and, \"you have to be patient. You have to hear us as clear as possible.\" What was she talking about? \"Brennan you're rare. Beside,...besides Justin, they're are no guys like you exsisting anymore...What-what we're about to tell you is something that you can't repeat and I know you won't because I can trust you. I can trust you with my life...You're a good person Brennan,\" Mari concludes through sobs. \"Kruger Joseph...I'm his son..\" The blow came to me like a punch in the face. At this point i'm afraid. I'm taken back. His son? Before I could collect any other emotions for this shocking revelation, Mari interjects. Taking a tiring stand, \"I knew the girl. I knew Paige Daley, she was my best friend...She was brave, and she was incredibly courageous even in her most frightening moments...She always protected me and she pretty much died...for me.\" Mari's legs begin to wiggle as they become weak and I jump up to catch her before she falls. With my hands gripping her waist, I allow her light weighted body to sway towards mines. Impulsively, I watch for Justin's reaction but there is none. \"I got you...Do you need water? Are you okay?\" My voice appears shaken but I need to hide any emotions that i'm owning at this minute because Mari has something more relevent to reveal. \"I'm fine. I just need to sit down..\" Mari gently takes a seat back in the same spot she leap from while glaring at Justin from the corners of her green eyes. \"She was just an innocent girl, we both were. But they didn't care because we saw them. We knew who they were and they were nnot going to let us just go...\" Mari's voice becomes filled with distain and disgust but I choose not to interrupt as a billion questions swim through my head. As she talks, Mari's glass eyes are focusing on the floor as well as Justin's. They both stare off into another place. I can tell that wherever they are, is somewhere they rather not be. I can coclude that the only reason they're in that place is because they need me to be there with them. They need me to see what they've saw and I don't think I want to. \"It wasn't your fault. It wasn't your fault despite anything he told you,\" Mari softly says to Justin as the two lost souls slowly make eye contact. I stand in this living room alone as they seem to tell this story for the first time out loud. I'm just a gateway, I suppose, because to them, i'm no longer in the room. Whatever is going to be said has to be said and i'm just glad that I get to be here for Mari. I know that i'm now sitting in this room with the son of a serial killer and the friend of his victim. I know that I can consider them strangers but not for long. I find myself trusting these two kindred spirits. I find myself wanting to help both of them. However, with this intense conversation going, I have no other choice other than to allow them full disclosure. In a way, I believe me being the third party helps because Justin and Mari couldn't possibly battle this out alone. They obviously have this harmless yet sordid connection. Justin's father murdered Mari's best friend. How did they meet? I wonder how Mari knows and did Justin tell her? Wait. Didn't Mari say that Paige saved her life? I'm so confused...I guess I'll just have to wait and listen. But if they keep talking in riddles, I will have to ask... \"Yes it was,\" Justin whispers. Mari shakes her head, \"No.\" \"I didn't think they would be back,\" Justin continues. \"Doesn't matter,\" Mari annoyingly replies, as if she's heard those words from Justin too many times. \"He killed Paige, him and Francis, and he..he raped you,\" Justin confesses. My head spins around. My heart pounds faster than a speeding bullot. Again, I don't get enough time to take in this revelation because Mari and Justin continue their confrontation. \"He shot you and he left you to die and so did I. I'm just as a monster as my father was,\" Justin confesses. Wiping her read swollen eyes, Mari turns her attention directly on Justin, whose eyes turns in the oppisite direction. \"That's not true. Justin, you didn't have a choice. You were a victim, you were terrified. Just as terrified as Paige and me...You saved my father's life!\" Mari cries as she tries to persuade her adopted brother of his innocence. \"Everytime you or your parents tell me that I still can't force myself to feel that way...It all could have been avoided if I had just left you and Paige alone at that store. I knew what Krug was capable of, even still, I should have stopped him that day...\" Justin's tears finally falls from his glass stain eyes. Mari grabs Justin's hand to comfort him as they both cry and relive an unimaginable experience. \"I keep thinking...If I would have just not caused that wreck they would have let us go,\" Mari confesses shakingly. As I watch them recollect the horror of their story, I can't help but to notice their uncertainty. For Justin, his uncertainty is the fact of guilt. Could he have prevented what happened? Could he have stopped his father from murdering Mari's friend? Mari, however, is uncertain that Justin could have or could not have helped them escape. She will never say the words out loud. She would never blame Justin due to his own struggle with guilt. What I understand, at this point, is more than I have ever understood about Mari. All this time, I wondered countless number of nights and days about Mari's enigmatic persona. The doubts of me not being her type whenever she would flinch if I touched her in certain places. That kiss I force on her all those weeks ago, my confession of love, her decision of pairing me up with my ex, the way she was always guarded when I asked about her past, and just about every single detail of Mari Collingwood was beginning to make sense at this moment. \"You called out my name, you were begging me to help you. He was crushed on top of you-\" before Justin can finish his statement, Mari quickly shuts him up with, \"he gave you a chance to hurt me but you didn't. I will never forget that.\" The look Justin gives Mari is heartwrenching. He hopes she could forget everything about that day. The words never come out but I hear them loud and clear and so does Mari. After more minutes of sobs and silence I decide to grab Justin a beer and Mari a bottle water from the fridge. Justin doesn't drink so I drink his beer before handing them both water. Minutes of silence turns into hours of silence. I had no idea what to say because I didn't feel I had as much right anymore. They obviously needed to get those things out and they needed a trusted third party on the outside to be present. The voices in my head were holding their own conversations. It was really hard to thiink straight after multiple bombshells like I've heard tonight. But. I have to say something. I have to be included because I loved Mari too much to be invisible right this moment. ","Summary":" I often wondered what I've done in my past life to be so lucky.

So I'm sorry I am not able to post very often. The internet at my house sucks and it can be extremely annoying. I promise I have more written (like 3 more chapters). I'm actually on my mom's computer so this is it for now but I will try my computer later today. Please keep the reviews coming! 3 -CoriHoran[Chapter 2] Hey so I'm going to take the story down for a day or two so I can make some edits…I started reading it again and noticed too many mistakes! So it will be back up by Monday at the latest[Chapter 3] Hi. My name is Corinne Jobco, but everyone just calls me Cori. I'm 19 years-old and I'm from Georgia but I moved to Texas right before my junior year of high school. Truthfully, I hated it, but it got better as the days went. Theatre and color guard are a huge part of my life. For those who don't know what color guard is, we are the people on the football field during half-time spinning flags, rifles, and sometimes sabres, or swords. We make the marching band show pretty. And just so you don't offend one of us, color guard IS a sport. We get more injured, although usually minor, than most sports, we just look cute doing it. Now I know this is short, that's why it's a preface. I just thought you should know something about me before I started the story. This is the story of my life with the five most amazing boys ever. -Cori 3 \"To live a creative life, we must lose our fear of being wrong.\" –Unknown \"I'd like to be more approachable, not less weird.\" –Unknown[Chapter 4] \"Hey, Sarah! Did I get any mail?\" I ask my roommate as I walk in the room. \"Um, ya. Something from some company downtown. It's on the table,\" she replies. I walk over to the table and pick up the envelope that she set aside from all her pen-pal letters. I look at it, hoping it's a letter from Cenica Records. I've been waiting for anything from them for weeks. \"Sarah, do you know what this is?\" I say, trying to hold my excitement and fear in. \"No, I just looked to see who it was for.\" \"This is a letter from Cenica Records. Remember, the people I auditioned for to perform at their big party,\" I say as I see the confusion on her face. She runs over, now understanding the importance, as I turn to open it. I'm so excited and scared, I'm shaking. I open the envelope with trembling hands: Congratulations, Corinne. You have been selected to perform at our black and white masquerade ball on Friday, July 20, 2012. Please come by the studio by Thursday, July 19, 2012 to discuss the details. Sincerely, Travis Cenica I am barley able to finish reading the letter I am so excited. I am going to sing in front of people for money. Something I have never done before. I am so excited I am literally jumping off the walls. It's late, so I figure it's a good time to go to sleep. I need to calm down, though. Maybe if I watch some TV. I turn on the TV and flip the channels. I stop on ICarly because it's a rerun of the IGo One Direction episode. About halfway through the show I fall asleep.[Chapter 5] When I wake up, its 9:30 A.M. Then I realize what day it is. It's the Wednesday before the event. I didn't realize how close to the date it is. I have nothing better to do today, so I figure I'll go downtown to the studio. Plus if I have to go shopping, I have a day to do so. I get up and get dressed. I figure I should look nice so I put on my favorite dress and heels. I go to the kitchen to get some food. After I've eaten, I head off to work. I work as a waitress in a small karaoke café right inside town. Once I clock out, I head further into town to go meet the people at Cenica Records. I arrive at the studio, and when I walk in I'm awestruck. After about a minute, I snap out of it and make my way to the front desk. \"Hello. Welcome to Cenica Records. How can I help you?\" the lady asks. \"I'm Corinne Jobco. I'm here to discuss the details about Friday's event,\" I say, very sheepishly. \"Okay, here's your pass. Take the elevator to the 7th floor. Someone will be there to meet you.\" \"Thank you.\" I make my way to the elevator and up to the 7th floor. When the doors open again there is a man standing there. I recognize him from the audition. His name is Travis Cenica…the CEO of the company. \"Hello, Corinne. Nice to see you again,\" he says with a smile. He is tall with short brown hair and hazel eyes. He looks to be about 25 or so, but I can never tell. \"Please, call me Cori. Nice to see you, too.\" \"Shall we?\" he asks as he turns to head back to his office. Which, it turns out, is the entire floor. \"So let's get to business. Do you know what you're going to sing yet? We need to inform the band so they can learn the music.\" \"I only got the letter yesterday, so I haven't given it much thought,\" I reply, but truthfully I've been thinking about it since the audition. I just don't want to sound desperate. \"Well then let's figure it out.\" Once we start to talk about music, Travis starts to relax and open up, less business like. After about an hour we had come up with a complete set list. By the end of the meeting we had discussed clothing, pay, and my schedule. When I leave its dark outside, so I head home and get some rest.[Chapter 6] I wake up to a sunny day outside. I get up and go to work. Before I go, though, I ask Sarah to come shopping with me for the event. I get off around 2:00 when Sarah picks me up outside the café and we make our way to the mall. \"Travis said he would pay for everything as long as he had a say in it,\" I tell Sarah as we walk into the mall. \"Well that's good. You get new stuff for free!\" I nod in agreement as we walk into the first store. \"So how will he have a say if he's not here?\" \"I have his number. I'm supposed to text him everything I try on.\" We spend our day trying on dresses, shoes, and mask, texting all our favorites to Travis. He say he wants me to really stand out at the black and white ball, so he picks a very flattering, pink cocktail dress, some strappy black heels, and a mask covered in music notes. We buy everything and go home. Sarah is exhausted after our fun day out, so she goes straight to bed. I'm tired, too, but I figure I should go over my schedule for tomorrow. 9:00 A.M. – meet the band at the venue 9:30 A.M.-11:30 A.M. – rehearsal with the band 11:30 A.M.-12:30 P.M. – lunch break 12:30 P.M.-6:30 P.M. – rehearsal with the band 6:30 P.M.-7:30 P.M. – dinner break 7:30 P.M.-8:50 P.M. – get ready 9:00 P.M. – party It's a long day but I think it will pay off. I call my boss at the café to make sure that I'm good for tomorrow, and then I go to sleep.[Chapter 7] The next thing I know I'm at the event and everything is going wrong. My dress rips, my heel breaks, the band knows none of the songs. Everyone leaves very early. I'm freaking out when I hear a gunshot, I guess I was that bad, and everything goes black. Finally I wake up. It was just a dream, but today's the day. I get up and get ready for the long day. I grab my things and head out the door. As I approach the venue, my heart starts to race. I can't tell if its nerves or excitement. I walk into the large white building to find a huge ballroom with a pearly dance floor and an amazing stage in front of me. That's where I'll be all night. I see the band setting up on stage. There are tables and chairs scattered everywhere in stacks. I walk up to the stage to meet the band. It's a group of five guys. They say they've been playing together forever. If we stick to the schedule, we have about 30 minutes to get to know each other, but we only us about 10. So we go ahead and get started. By the time lunch comes rolling around, we've made it through a few songs and we are having so much fun. For lunch we walk down the street to a deli. I get to know the boys better. The two guitarists are twins, John and Tony. Their personalities remind me of Fred and George Weasley from Harry Potter . The bass player's name is Sam, who is very calm and collected. The piano player, who is very smart but still wild and fun, is named Kenny. Finally, the drummer's name is Stevie. He is wild and crazy. Before we know it it's time to go back. When we get there, people have started prepping for the party. We jump up on stage and get back to work. Once 7:30 comes, we have finished the entire set list and a few other songs they knew how to play. We are ready so we leave to get changed. The record company has sent someone to do my hair and makeup, which I'm grateful for.[Chapter 8] The night went great. Nothing terrible happened and everyone loved us. I wake up the next morning insanely tired, but I know I have to get to work. I'm tired, but in a good mood. I figure when I get home I can go outside and spin. It's been too long. I spend my first hour at work thinking about spinning my neglected equipment. The clink the flag makes, the snap of the strap on the rifle, and the pain coming from the blade of the sabre when I catch them. It's relaxing. Suddenly I realize there are now people at one of my tables. As I walk over to take their order I realize that One Direction is at the café and at my table. I start to fan girl but decide it might be a bad idea. I come back with their food, giving it to them by name. \"Is there anything else I can get you?\" I ask, like a good waitress would. \"Actually, could you sing for us?\" Louis asks. \"Um, what?\" I've never had this request before. I usually just get that they need more to drink or a condiment that's not on the table. This feels really weird. \"Your friend told us to ask you to sing for us,\" Zayn says calmly. \"Can you, please?\" Louis asks as he puts on a puppy dog face. \"I guess so…\" I reply hesitantly. It's almost to the bridge of Moves Like Jagger by Maroon 5, so I decide to sing that. \"You wanna know, how to make me smile, take control on me just for the night…\" Once I finish, I look at the boys. There is a look of happiness and astonishment on their faces. \"Well if you need anything else, just call my name,\" I say with a smile, but all I want to do is get away as fast as possible. After I walk away, I try not to look back at the table, but I know I'm going to have to go back soon to give them their checks. A few minutes pass by when I hear the karaoke DJ announce that we have some participants. I hear the beginning of What Makes You Beautiful. As soon as Liam starts to sing I feel a tap on my shoulder. I turn around to find Niall offering his hand and a mic. I take both and he leads me toward the stage. On our way up he tells me to sing the chorus with them. We make it to the stage just in time to sing. \"Sing Zayn's part,\" Niall whispers to me after we finish the chorus. I'm hesitant at first, but I feel at home once I start to sing. We finish the song and I'm on cloud nine. All of a sudden the boys are on one knee. \"Will,\" Liam starts. \"You,\" follows Harry. \"Come,\" says Zayn. \"On,\" Niall pursues. \"Tour,\" Louis says goofily. \"With us?\" Niall finishes. I'm about to cry I'm so happy. Unable to speak, I nod my head yes. They jump up and tackle me with hugs. As we get off stage Louis says, \"Go get your things. You're coming with us.\"[Chapter 9] We drive back to my apartment so I can get my things for tour. I run in (literally) and almost knock Sarah over as she comes out the door. She runs in behind me, looking worried. Then she sees me packing and smiling. \"Whats going on?\" \"One…Direction…asked me…to…go…on tour…with them,\" I choke out in between breaths. \"What?\" She once a looks confused. \"One Direction asked me to…\" \"No,no. I got that much, but how, and… and when?\" she stumbles out. \"They came to the café, heard me sing and asked me! We are leaving today!\" I almost shout as I shove clothes in a suitcase. \"Well then let's get you packed!\" she says as she starts to help me. A few minutes later I hear a knock on the door. I run over and open it to find Niall. \"Hey, come on in, I'm almost ready.\" I run into my room, grab my packed suitcase, and run back out. \"Sarah, this is Niall. Niall, this is my roommate Sarah.\" \"Nice to meet you,\" he say as he shakes her hand. Then he turns to me, \"Can I take that for you? We need to get going.\" \"Sure, I'll be right down.\" \"Okay,\" he says as he takes my stuff and heads to the car. I turn to Sarah, who is crying. I'm not sure if it's because she is going to miss me or because she just met Niall. \"Well, I guess this is goodbye,\" I say, almost scared to leave. \"Only for a little while. You better call me and tell me every detail,\" she says, still crying. \"I will.\" I turn to leave. I know if I stay any longer I'll start to cry, too. I jump in the car and we start to drive to the airport. I'm sad for the first few minutes of the ride. The boys sense this and try to cheer me up. By the time we get to the airport, I'm still crying, but I'm not sad anymore. Now it's because I can't stop laughing at Louis! We get on the plane and Niall ushers me to a pair of seats next to each other. Zayn sits in a seat across from us and the other three sit further up. \"So where are we headed?\" They never told me so I figured I'd ask. \"Actually we are on vacation for a few months. So we are headed home. You can stay with one of us,\" Niall says smiling. I can tell he is excited to see his family. We talk for the next few hours. We will stop in Ireland first, where Niall and I will get off. Eventually, I fall asleep on his shoulder. Louis thought it was so cute he took a picture and tweeted it when we landed.[Chapter 10] Niall and I get in a car and start to drive to his dad's house. During the drive, Niall tells me about the first time he saw me. \"So, was that you at the Cenica Record party?\" he asks. \"Ya, you were there?\" I had no idea. Then again, I didn't know who anyone was with all the masks. \"It's the only reason we were in town. I knew the first time I heard you that you were different. I made the boys stay longer so we could find you. We got lucky finding you the next day.\" \"No one has ever done anything like that for me. So you gave up a day of your vacation…just to find me?\" I can't believe he would do that. \"Ya…\" he says shyly. We drive the rest of the way blasting music and having fun. Once we get there, Niall's dad is already lingering outside, waiting for his son to get home. Niall gets out of the car first and his dad's face just lights up. Then he sees me and a look of confusion crosses his face. He turns back to Niall and greets him with a huge hug. After a moment he turns to me. \"Hello, I'm Bobby Horan. And you are?\"He asks, shaking my hand. \"Oh, I'm Corinne Jobco, but please just call me Cori,\" I say pleasantly. \"Dad, how about we go inside and I'll tell you the whole story,\" Niall says as he pushes us inside. Niall explains the last two days to his dad with a little bit of my input. Once he finishes, Bobby says, \"Well, she is welcome here.\" We go out to get our stuff out of the car and take it to our rooms. Once we've set our stuff down I get a quick tour of the house, then we all sit down again and talk for a while. \"After all this boasting about your singing, Cori, I think I need to hear it\" Bobby says a little jokingly. \"Oh, God. I'll make you a deal,\" I respond. \"I will only sing if Niall sings with me.\" I look at Niall. He rolls his eyes at me and gets up to get his guitar, causing Bobby to laugh. When he comes back, he sits down and starts to play one of the songs I sang at the party. When we finish, Bobby has the same look on his face that the boys had back at the café. \"Wow. Well are you hungry? I can start dinner,\" he says after the initial shock wears off. \"Sure.\" \"Sounds great, Dad, thanks.\" After Bobby leaves the room, Niall turns to me. \"Come on. I want to show you something.\" I get up and follow him to his room. He grabs a notebook and we sit down on his bed. \"No one has ever seen or heard these. Not even the guys. There weren't really meant for the group,\" he says as he opens the book, which is full of songs. \"Well, then why show them to me?\" \"I told you, you're special.\" I feel the butterflies rise in my stomach. \"Will you sing one for me?\" \"Well, most of them are duets,\" he says cautiously. \"Then teach me,\" I say with a smile. \"What?\" \"You said they are duets and I'm 'special'. So teach me a song,\" I answer, putting air quotes around the word special. A huge smile runs across his face. I start to learn the songs in the book. We spend our month at his dad's house learning the songs. At the end of the month, Niall helps me pack my things. \"So I figure we can show the songs to the lads at the bungalow,\" Niall says as we pack. \"Really? Finally ready to show them?\" \"Ya. I mean we both know all the songs. Plus, I think I've kept them hidden long enough.\" \"Well, okay then. Let's do it,\" I say with a smile. I've really gotten to know Niall over the month and I've really started to like him. A few hours later we are ready to go. We say goodbye to Bobby and we make our way to the airport. As we take off, I say my goodbyes to Ireland. I hope to see it again soon.[Chapter 11] One by one we all arrive at the bungalow. Harry is the first to arrive, followed by Liam, Zayn, and Louis. Finally Niall and I arrive. It's late by the time we get there. The rest of the boys are sitting outside around a fire. Niall and I set our stuff down and walk out to join them. As soon as he sees me, Harry jumps up and hugs me. Once he lets go, we sit down. We sit there, talking until midnight. We are all pretty tired by then so Harry shows me to my room and I go to sleep. I wake up late the next morning. I make my way to the kitchen to find all the boys already there. \"Good morning, sunshine!\" Louis shouts as I walk in. I jump and almost fall over, but Niall is right there to catch me. \"Is he always this awake?\" I ask Niall groggily as he helps me up. \"Usually, yes,\" he says, laughing a little. I sit down and someone passes me some food. I'm still half asleep so I don't see who. I sit there and eat as the boys talk. Eventually, Liam breaks my silence when he asks, \"So what do we want to do today?\" I think about it for a minute. I look outside at the beautiful day and think about the day we left the U.S. I remember wanting to spin. It sounds like a good idea until I realize something. \"Damn! I forgot my equipment at home!\" I complain, making the boys jump. They all look confused so I explain color guard to them. \"We could have it shipped if you want,\" Zayn says. \"No, I wouldn't want to be a bother,\" I say as I try to forget about it. \"Well, personally, I want to see you spin. It sounds awesome,\" Niall says. He seems really interested. \"Ok, then. I'll ask Sarah to pack it up.\" Sarah. I totally forgot to call her and tell her everything. I feel bad as I run to my room to grab my phone. I jump on my bed and dial her number. \"Hello?\" I hear a groggy voice say. \"Hey, Sarah! Its Cori.\" \"Dude…do you know what time it is?\" I completely forgot about the time difference. We are about 6 hours ahead. That means it's about 4 A.M. back home. \"I am so sorry! I totally forgot! Do you want me to call back later? Cause I can,\" I feel so bad. \"Nope. I'm awake now. So how's One Direction?\" \" Amazing ! I've spent the last month with Niall. He is so sweet. Plus he taught me a bunch of songs he wrote that no one has ever heard before!\" \"Sounds like someone has a crush,\" she says. I can almost see her winking at me. \"Shut up. But anyways I am actually calling cause I need a favor.\" \"Okay. What do ya need? \"Can you pack up my equipment and send it to me?\" \"Sure. You payin'?\" \"Of course. I wouldn't make you do that!\" \"Ok then. Talk to you later?\" \"Of course. Thank you so much! Bye!\"[Chapter 12] A week or two later my things arrive. I rip open the box. Sarah even sent me tape. She knows me too well. My silk is really wrinkled after being rolled up for so long. So I take it off the pole and iron it. I am taping it back on as Louis walks into the room. \"Oh, sword!\" he shouts when he sees the sabre. He picks it up and starts to play with it. Harry walks in and runs over to grab my rifle. I finish taping my flag and have to wrestle the other pieces from the boys. \"Niall! You wanted to see me spin, right?\" I yell as I make my way to the door. \"Ya,\" he says as he walks into the room. \"Then come open the door please.\" I could do it myself, but that would involve shifting everything into one hand. He is right here anyway. We go outside and I set my things down. I pick a song to spin to as I stretch. I wait for everyone to get outside before asking what they want me to spin first. They don't care. I think about it and I remember a routine I did with some friends to one of their songs. I can recall most of the work so I decide to do that. I find the song and hand my iPod to Liam. I set up and tell him to hit play when he is ready. I finish and they cheer. \"Would anyone like to try?\" I ask. It could be fun. I soon realize all they want to do is play with the equipment. I roll my eyes as I laugh. I turn to go inside to get some water. I close the fridge and turn around to find Niall standing right behind me. I jump and he once again catches me. \"How many times am I going to have to catch you?\" \"Who knows? But don't do that! You scared the shit out of me!\" I say laughing. \"Sorry, I just wanted to talk to you about the songs,\" he says as we make our way out of the kitchen. \"Oh, ya. We still haven't sung them.\" I lay down on the couch. Niall lifts my legs up and sits down. \"I know. I'm just nervous.\" \"Why? They are your friends. They will be supportive no matter what.\" \"Well tomorrow is our last day here, so how about tonight? \"Sounds good to me.\" \"Just don't let me back out.\" \"Never,\" I say giving him a shove with my foot. Once the sun starts to fall, Niall and I start a fire. We gather Harry, Liam, Louis, and Zayn. I sit them around the fire while Niall gets his guitar. We start to sing the songs to them. After a few good responses, Niall loosens up and we start to have fun. The boys love the songs. Liam actually suggest that we should sing them for Simon. We stay out there for who knows how long. I fall asleep on Niall's shoulder and he carries me to my room and tucks me in. We leave the next day and head for their flats.[Chapter 13] I relax at the flat for a few days while the boys go to the studio to record some new songs. I spend the time unpacking, calling Sarah, and watching TV. It gets really boring by about the third day, so I ask to go with them to watch. I sit back and watch as one by one, they go in and record their part of a song. It started to get funny when they started to goof off. Finally it was Niall's turn. He took my hand and pulled me into the booth. He shows me a song and says they recorded most of it a few days ago, but it's still missing something. I look at the song. It's my favorite of all the songs I learned with Niall. He hands me a pair of headphones. I think he is going to leave me sitting in there alone and sing. Instead, he stays and sings it with me. We finish and I walk out and I sit down next to Harry. We play back the track with the other tracks behind it. \"It sounds amazing,\" I say. I'm sure I have a stupid look on my face, but the boys don't seem to notice. \"Yep, and we are going to show it to Simon,\" Zayn tells me. \"But we might have to hold Niall back,\" Louis jokes. \"We don't want him stopping us,\" Harry adds. \"Got it. Come on guys.\" Turns out Liam has spent the time putting the completed song on a disk. We make our way to Simon's office. When we arrive, Simon is waiting for us. Liam walks up and hands him the disk. \"What's this?\" Simon ask. \"It's a song I wrote,\" Niall tells him. There is a scared look on his face. I'm almost positive mine looks the same. \"Let's hear it then,\" Simon retorts as he puts the disk in a drive. When the song reaches its end, Simon says it good. \"But who is the female voice?\" I've been standing behind Zayn and Niall, where Simon couldn't see me. I step forward. \"Me, sir. Hi, I'm Cori,\" I say as I reach out to shake his hand. \"Well I think we have something wonderful here. How would you like to sign on as a part of One Direction?\" I turn and give a shocked look to Niall. He gently nods his head and smiles. \"Sure, I'd love to.\" I can barely get the words out of my mouth. After I sign on, the boys and I make our way home. \"What do you think the fans will say?\" I ask in the car. \"They'll love you,\" says Harry. \"Just like we do,\" Niall adds with a smile. \"But the fans are different. They might not think this is as good of an idea as we do,\" I point out. \"Well if they don't love you then they are crazy,\" Louis retorts. \"Don't worry, we won't let them hurt you,\" Liam comforts me. \"Promise?\" I ask, still nervous. \"Promise,\" Zayn nods.[Chapter 14] \"Free day!\" Louis yells as he burst into Niall's flat. \"I say we celebrate,\" Zayn says as he wanders into the room. \"What are we celebrating? That we have a free day? We just had two months of that!\" I joke. \"No…I think we are celebrating you,\" Niall says as he shoots a questioning look at Zayn, who nods. \"Aw, do we have to? I mean its sweet and all, but I was kinda hoping to stay in and watch a movie or something,\" I say. \"Sounds like a party to me!\" Harry says. I didn't even notice him and Liam walk in until he said something. We gathered a stack of everyone's favorite movies, snacks, and drinks. I pop in the movie on the top of the stack and we all get comfortable. By about 4:30 we start to get bored. So we start to play games. About an hour later, I pull Harry aside. \"So you can cook, right?\" I ask. \"A little. Why?\" he inquires, giving me a weird look. \"I want to make dinner for everyone, but I need some help considering how much y'all eat,\" I say starting with a cautious tone the turning it into a joking one. \"Let's do it! We can go to my flat if you want,\" he replies, beaming his adorable cheeky smile. \"More of a surprise that way! Let's go!\" I say as we walk back to the others. \"Hey we will be back. And stop snacking!\" I yell at them. I hear them laughing as Harry and I head out the door. \"So what are we making?\" Harry ask as we walk into his flat. \"Well, I was thinking breakfast for dinner.\" It's one of my favorites, plus its fun to make. Harry nods and we start to get everything we need. We make a butt load of french toast, scramble about a dozen eggs, and bacon. Lots of bacon, and some turkey bacon just for Zayn. The entire time we blast music and try not to make too much of a mess. Harry sets the table as I text the others to come join us and to bring the rest of the movies. I can tell by their faces when they walk in that they weren't expecting this much. \"Well, come on. Before it gets cold.\" They all run to the table, almost knocking each other over. I'm pretty sure Louis did actually fall. When we finish we all make our way to the couch to watch another movie. They all sit down, leaving no room for me, so to mess with them, I lay on top of them. They don't seem to mind, but by the next movie, I'm on the floor. As we watch the movies we all fall asleep. No one wakes up until the next morning, all on the floor in Harry and Louis' flat.[Chapter 15] A few days later, Niall and I are eating breakfast when I think of something: the fans. \"How are we going to tell the fans?\" I ask. \"I hadn't thought of that,\" he replies. We both sit there thinking about it for a minute. \"I think it's time to bring back the video diaries,\" he says after a minute. \"Oh, good idea!\" We hurriedly get dressed. I run to the other guys' flats and tell them to come to the flat. I'm so excited and nervous, I can't help but run. Niall explains the idea and they all start to get excited. We plan out how we are going to do it, then set up. They all sit on the couch and start the video. We decided to introduce me at the end. They go through the video being idiots and telling the fans about the recent news and the new album. \"Well, I guess that's it, lads,\" Liam says. \"I feel like there is something we forgot,\" Harry says, trailing off like he is thinking. They start listing off everything they've talked about so far. I'm trying hard not to laugh. Finally Zayn says, \" Did we talk about our new member?\" \"No, we didn't. Where is she?\" Niall ask. They decided to faze me in editing. Kind of like they did to Louis a while back. \"Cori! Where have you been? We just did the whole video without you!\" \"What are you talking about? I've been here the whole time! Hi!\" I say as I turn to the camera. I can't stop laughing for the rest of the video. We finish the diary and collapse from all the laughing. We spend a few weeks in the studio, finishing the album. At one point, Simon tells us that we need to make a music video. We meet the director he choose and hear his idea for the video. I start to get excited. \"Now I need you to act like yourselves. This is Cori's first video, so we want to show who she really is,\" the director tells us when we arrive on set a few days later. I start to get nervous. He is right, it's my first video. I start to think to myself: can I pull this off? Will it be any good? Will the fans like it?... Niall walks over to where I'm sitting. \"Hey, you ready?\" I turn to look at him, and he sees the fear in my eyes. \"What's wrong?\" he asks as he sits down next to me. \"I'm freaking out! I've never done this before. I just don't think I'm good eno…\" I start to rattle on. \"Hey! Never say that! You're amazing. Everything will be fine,\" he says, cutting me off. He then gives me a huge hug. I can feel his heart beating and smell his cologne. I want to kiss him so badly, but I don't want to make the first move. Especially if he doesn't feel the same way. We separate and I feel better, but not fully confident. Niall has to push me onto set. By the end of the day I'm exhausted but I feel much better about the whole video. The next day we have a photo shoot for the album cover. The saying 'time flies when you're having fun' came completely true. I can barely remember most of the shoot.[Chapter 16] Its a few days later and all of a sudden Niall starts to ignore me. I try to get through to him by the just won't open up. It's not like him to not tell me things, so I go to find someone else to talk to. I run into Liam first. \"Hey, Liam. Can we talk?\" I say as I pass by. He sits down against the wall and motions for me to join him. \"What's wrong?\" he asks once I've sat down. \"Niall is ignoring me. I can barely get two words out of him. It's really starting to piss me off,\" I say, my voice rising as I go. \"How long has he been ignoring you?\" \"A day or two. I'm not sure how much longer I can handle it. I think I just need to get out of the house.\" I think he can tell that I don't mean just for today. He nods and tells me he will tell the others. I run back to the flat and pack my bag. The next thing I know I'm on a flight back to Texas. I figure I will stay with my parents until things blow over. I know I'm not going to leave the boys forever. I could never do that, they are like my family. To add to that, I still need to tell my parents about everything. After about a week, I fell good enough to talk to the boys again. I told my parents and they came to terms with it and are proud. I still don't talk to Niall out of fear. I spend most of my time at the house, playing my brother's Xbox. I want to go back, but I don't want to be ignored. So I stay with my parents for almost a month.[Chapter 17] It's the end of the month and I still haven't talked to Niall. I'm sitting at home alone when I hear the doorbell ring. It's early and I'm still half asleep, so it takes me forever to get off the couch. I feel bad about how long I take. When I open the door I see the back of a beautiful blonde head walking toward a car parked on the curb. \"Niall,\" I say under my breath. \"Niall!\" I yell at him as I start to run toward him. He turns around just in time to catch me as I jump into his arms. He spins me in circles until we are both dizzy. He sets me down and stares into my eyes. I can't pull my eyes away from his gorgeous blue ones. He softly brushes away the hair that has fallen into my face. The next thing I know, my heart is racing and the butterflies are rising because his lips have crashed into mine. It feels magical. It just feels right being in his arms with his lips touching mine. \"I'm sorry. I couldn't help mys-\" he starts to say once we break apart. \"Stop talking and kiss me again,\" I interrupt him, giggling slightly. \"Gladly,\" he says smiling as he leans in to kiss me again. We break apart and I invite Niall inside. On the way in he says, \"I'm so sorry. Liam told me everything. I'm so sorry! Will you please come back with me?\" \"I thought you'd never ask! Just let me pack my things,\" I shout. On the way to the airport I think about the others. I want to mess with them and I want to keep Niall and me a secret from the fans. I turn to Niall and tell him what I'm thinking. He laughs a little, but agrees to the idea. We decide that when we get back we will act like nothing has happened.[Chapter 18] Niall and I get off the plane in London to find the rest of the band waiting for us with a crowd of paparazzi around them. I ignore the paparazzi and run to hug which ever guy I reach first, dropping my bag on the ground so I can run faster. It didn't matter with guy I hugged first because they huddled around me in a giant group hug. The first thing I hear when I get in the car is Liam asking, \"So did anything happen between the two of you that we don't know about?\" Shit! I think. I had totally forgotten to think of a back story. I can't think of anything. Luckily, Niall seems to be prepared. \"I told her I was jealous she was getting all the attention, so I started to ignore her. I said we were all dying without her and convinced her to come home.\" It's a bad story, but they seem to take it. I do see them look at each other suspiciously, though, but I brush it off and relax. I'm happy to be home. We get back to the flat and Niall helps me unpack. We talk about our back story and Niall even tries to kiss me. I let him, of course. I'm too happy to resist. It's about 12 pm once we finish unpacking. \"Hey, I'm going outside to spin,\" I tell Niall, hoping he will come with me. \"Wait up! Teach me something, would you?\" he asks as we head out the door. We spend the rest of daylight outside messing around and having fun. We try not to do anything couple-like, just in case someone is watching, but we do slip a few times. We go back inside once it's too dark to do anything else. I'm pretty exhausted, so I go straight to bed, kissing Niall good night. Around 2 am I wake up with a start. I can't go back to sleep so I walk to the living room and flip on the TV. A few minutes late, Niall walks out of his room and comes to sit next to me. \"Hey, are you okay?\" he asks. \"Ya. I just had a bad dream,\" I respond. \"What about?\" he is still not quite awake enough to comprehend much, I must have woken him up. I feel bad. \"Well, you left me and the fans hated me. You know, pretty much everything that could go wrong in my life right now,\" I tell him. \"Come on. You need sleep.\" He takes my hand in his and leads me to his room, where we curl up together and fall asleep. It's one of the best night's sleeps I ever had.[Chapter 19] I wake up to the sound of Niall's guitar and the smell of breakfast. I walk out of his room to find him sitting with his back toward me, writing a new song. I sneak up behind him and wrap my arms around his shoulders. He jump and lays his guitar down on top of his notebook. He turns around and grabs my waist, pulling me over the back of the chair into his lap, where he kisses me lightly. \"Good morning,\" he says, pulling his lips away from mine. \"Morning,\" I reply with a smiling. \"What are you up to so early?\" \"Writing. I had a great idea for a song. I was actually hoping to get into the studio today. You hungry?\" he asks, changing the topic of conversation. \"Yes! What did you make?\" I ask as I roll out of his lap and onto the floor. After finishing out toast and bacon, we make out way to the studio with the rest of the band in tow. I can't help but look at Niall while I'm in the booth, and vise-versa. The song he wrote is about us. I sit there hoping the others still think that nothing is going on. I know it's hard for Niall and me to hide it sometimes, though. It makes me laugh just thinking about it. Zayn turns to me and asks what's funny and I have to tell him nothing. The next day we have a photo shoot. I've never seen Niall's smile so real in my life. I have a feeling the others notice, too, but they don't say anything. After the shoot we all head back to Niall's flat, which, I guess, is not my flat, too. We pick up Nandos on the way and have a family dinner. We finish dinner and everyone leaves. I grab my computer and sit down on the couch to relax for the rest of the night. I sit down to realize just how sneaky the boys are. They have pulled up a video chat, I'm assuming, to see if there really was something going on between Niall and me. I decide to pretend not to notice, but I have to warn Niall somehow. So I pull up Word and type everything to him. \"Hey Niall, can you bring me something to drink?\" I hell into the other room. \"Sure, babe,\" he says as he walks in. \"Check this out,\" I say as I point to the computer. He reads the note and laughs. \"So that's how it is?\" he asks. \"Yep!\" We play it off for the rest of the night. As the days have gone by, though, it has gotten harder and harder to act like we aren't together. Obviously the others have noticed. I'm not just trying to keep it from the boys, but the fans, too. I'm keeping myself safe from any hate mail from them. So far it's working, but all I want to do is hold Niall's hand in public. Eventually, I close the computer, kiss Niall goodnight, and go to bed.[Chapter 20] We spend the next few days finishing the album and making it perfect. Now we have to promote it. Somehow, without my knowledge, we decided to have a few concerts. On the inside I'm freaking out, but I don't show it because I don't want Niall to worry. The news has a few days to settle in and my nerves have reached a peak. I'm lying on the floor in my dressing room, listening to calming music, when I hear a knock at the door. I open my eyes to see Niall com in and close the door behind him. \"How are you feeling?\" he asks as he lies down next to me. \"The truth?\" I reply, closing my eyes again. \"The truth.\" I roll over and lay my head on his chest. \"I'm scared,\" I say I'm the comfort of his arms. I can hear his heart beat steadily as mine races inside my chest. \"I thought so,\" he retorts with a small laugh. He kisses the top of my head and reaches into his pocket. \"So I brought something for you.\" He pulls out a necklace with a silver shamrock on it. I sit up and lift my hair so he can put it around my neck. \"Isn't this yours?\" I inquire. I recognize it. I'm almost positive I've seen it around his neck before. \"I figured it would be like having a piece of me with you on stage, since I can't stand next to you the whole time.\" He smiles as I turn around and kiss his soft lips. Its time to go on stage so I tuck the necklace in my shirt and we make our way out. It's almost to my first solo and I notice I am messing with the shamrock. I quickly tuck it back in my shirt and sing. We finish what I think was a great concert. We get off stage and I'm stopped in my tracks. \"So I think they would make the perfect couple. What do you think lads?\" Louis says turning to Niall and I. \"Well isn't that Niall's necklace she's wearing?\" harry asks. \"What? This old thing? I've had this forever,\" I quickly retort. They pretend to believe me and walk away. Niall and I make out way to change and give each other quick glances of relief.[Chapter 21] Hey! so i don't want to be weird or anything but… follow me on twitter you can ask me questions, give me ideas, and talk to me! I would love to know you all I will follow you back if you follow me my name is CoriOfficialH I may also, every now and then, post updates or spoilers so please follow me :D but tell me if you are following me because you saw this![Chapter 22] We spend the next few days on the road doing concerts. The only time we get to sleep is on the plane or in the car. Either way, one of us is always asleep. I never take off Niall's necklace. It comforts me, knowing he is always there. Finally we find ourselves in a hotel and we rent three two-bed rooms. Since Niall and I live together already, we take one room. I try to sleep, but the room is freezing. I'm already wearing a pair of sweats I brought and I am underneath three blankets, but I'm still cold. I get up to get a jacket just to realize I have nothing comfortable enough to sleep in. so I walk over to Niall's bag, pull out his Mickey Mouse hoodie, and slip it over my head. I crawl back into bed and fall straight asleep. \"Wake up, princess,\" I hear Niall say as I slip back into consciousness. \"The boys are here to talk about more promoting.\" I roll out of bed, and walk into the living room. I pull the sleeves of Niall's hoodie over my hands, forgetting that it's not mine and that no one knows we are together. \"Isn't that Niall's, too?\" Harry ask when he sees me in the hoodie. I wake up a little more, look down at what I'm wearing, and reply, \"it was freezing last night and this is the first comfortable thing I found.\" It is the truth for once. I still feel bad lying to them. We finish our meeting and I'm left with Niall to pack. We finish with time to spare. I'm still wearing the hoodie and necklace. Niall is most likely not getting the m back anytime soon. Niall sits down on the couch and I lay in his lap. \"That looks good on you, you know. Better than on me,\" Niall comments. \"Thanks,\" I say with a smile. \"Can I talk to you?\" \"About anything,\" he responds. \"I want to tell them. Just the boys, though. Not the fans yet,\" I say as he strokes my hair. \"They already know,\" Niall claims. \"I know, but I'm tired of pretending like we aren't together.\" \"Okay, before the show later?\" \"Better than after,\" I say getting up. We get our things and meet the boys downstairs to head to the next concert.[Chapter 23] \"Guys wait,\" I say as we are about to go on stage for our last concert. They all turn to face me and Niall walks to my side. \"Meet my girlfriend,\" he says taking my hand. \"Wait, the two of you are together?\" Harry says sarcastically. \"No shit, Sherlock!\" Louis shouts and we all laugh. \"Well, now that that's out of the way, let's go have some fun,\" I say. I jump onto Niall's back and he carries me on stage. We play a great show and quickly jump into a plane to fly home. Right before I sit down next to Niall, Harry pulls me over to sit with him. \"Tell me everything,\" he says once I've landed in the seat. I look over at Niall and see that Liam has taken my usual seat next to him. I assume he is doing the same thing Harry is. I still wish I didn't have to do this, though. I turn back to Harry and tell him everything he wants to know. \"But we can't tell anyone else,\" I finish. \"I don't want the fans to know quite yet.\" \"Okay,\" he says giving me a cheeky smile. We land and go straight home to get sleep. I wake up earlier than Niall and decide to make breakfast. \"Good morning,\" Niall says walking into the kitchen. He comes up behind me and wraps his arms around my waist. He kisses my cheek lightly, and then rests his chin on my shoulder. \"What's for breakfast?\" he asks. \"Nothing for you, food monster,\" I joke as I hand him a plate. \"This is all for me.\" Simon calls in the middle of breakfast and tells us to meet at his office in an hour. We finish breakfast and hurry to get ready. Niall drives us to the studio where we go to Simon's office. \"We are all here now. Good,\" Simon says s as we walk in. \"It seems that a lot of people want to see a video of Moments . Now, we can film it quickly, but we cannot get girls quick enough.\" \"I can ask Perrie,\" Zayn says. \"We could use our girlfriends,\" Louis inputs. His face lights up at the thought of Eleanor. \"But Harry and I don't have girlfriends,\" Niall shoots back. \"Well Cori could be one of the girls,\" Harry points out. \"One more girl and he have a video,\" Liam says. \"Okay. I will leave it to you all. The shoot starts tomorrow,\" Simon informs us and we head out the door.[Chapter 24] Harry magically found a girl for the video. I think her name was Madison. I finally get to meet Eleanor, Perri, and Danielle. They are all so sweet. We each get our own camera man. They tell us to pick a perfect date. Once we all have our instructions, we run off to go on our own adventures. Niall and I head back to our place. We have gotten so used to staying at home for our dates that it's what is perfect to us. Niall makes some popcorn and grabs our favorite drinks, while I pick a movie. The cameraman films us doing this. I turn to him before I sit down. \"If you think there is anything we should do, please tell us,\" I say smiling. He nods his head and we continue. I lay down in Niall's lap and we start the movie. Throughout the movie I change positions, never getting fully comfortable. After lying in his lap for a little while, Niall starts to tickle me and I quickly squirm to the other side other the couch, laughing. I grab the popcorn and cradle it, pulling my knees to my chest. I take a piece out of the bowl and throw it at Niall. \"Catch,\" I say once I have his attention. I throw another piece of popcorn and Niall attempts to catch it in his mouth. He fails and it falls to the floor. I try again and he catches it this time. After a few successful throws, I take a handful and throw it all at him. It explodes and he is covered. Niall gets up and lunges to attack me. I move the popcorn and curl into the smallest ball I can be. All of a sudden the movie is over. We clean up, still throwing popcorn, which takes up forever. We ask the camera man if he has enough and head back to the studio. Once the others arrive, I let the bouts chill alone for a while. I decide to get to know the other girlfriends better. \"So, where did y'all go for your date?\" I ask, trying to start a conversation. \"Well, Harry made dinner for us,\" Madison says smiling. I start to wonder if there might be something between her and Harry. \"I'm going to guess he made tacos?\" I joke. It is his favorite food, though. Madison nods and we all laugh. \"What did Louis do?\" I ask, turning to Eleanor. \"We went for some ice cream and a walk on the beach,\" she replies. \"Will y'all please just get married already? \"I wish,\" she says with a smile. \"I going to guess that Liam took you to an amusement park,\" I propose to Danielle. She nods and we turn to look at Perri. \"He took me out to dinner,\" she says once she notices we are all looking at her. \"Knowing Niall, there must have been food involved,\" she jokes, turning the attention to me. \"Nandos, maybe?\" \"No, but we did make a huge mess with popcorn. I'm pretty sure there is still some hidden in the couch. But no, we stayed in and watch a movie,\" I say, laughing about the popcorn. I feel something poke my sides, right where I'm ticklish, and I scream. I try to turn around, but his arms are already around my waist. \"You ready to go home?\" Niall ask, laying his chin on my shoulder. I nod, say goodbye to the other girls, and we head home.[Chapter 25] The next day we are sitting at home relaxing. I'm reading one of my favorite books, Sisters Red by Jackson Pearce (go check it out, it's really good). Niall is watching whatever sports are on. All of a sudden, I hear a knock on the door. \"Come in,\" I yell, too lazy to get up. The other boys walk in and sit around the room. \"Since when have you ever knocked?\" \"Liam got to the door first,\" Louis complains, as I giggle a little. \"Anyways, we have an interview coming up. We should probably tell them about Cori,\" Liam says once everyone has settled down. \"Wait, what are we talking about?\" I ask, setting down my book. \"We planned to have another interview with Alan Carr before we met you,\" Zayn says. \"Now you've screwed everything up!\" Louis yells jokingly. I kick him, laughing. \"When is it?\" I ask. \"On Friday,\" Liam informs me. \"Let's do it! Just make sure they know there are six of us now, not five,\" I say. Three days later, I wake up to a beautiful, sunny day. It's the day of our Alan Carr interview. My first interview , I think to myself. This should be fun . I get dressed and meet the boys down at the van. I pull out my camera and turn it on. \"So Niall,\" I say, pointing the camera at him. \"Where are we headed?\" \"Alan Carr. Chatty Man,\" he says in his announcer's voice. I laugh, record a little more, then turn the camera off and enjoy the rest of the ride. We get there and I turn the camera back on. \"Well, we are here and we really want to come say hi to all of you but we are running late. This is normal for us apparently. Sorry!\" I say pointing the camera at myself. We go inside and get ready. Alan stops by to say hello. All this time I'm filming random things here and there. Finally it's time for the show. They announce us and we walk in down the stairs. We sit down on the couch and start the interview. Alan offers us drinks and we take them. Then he turns to me. \"I had to get a bigger couch because of you.\" \"Sorry!\" I say acting slightly offended. \"But you didn't have to do that; I could have sat on top of someone or on the floor.\" \"Well, It's too late now isn't it?\" we all laugh and then get back to the interview. \"So, last time the boys were here only two of you had girlfriends,\" Alan says, setting up his first question. \"Are you two still with your lovely ladies?\" \"Yep,\" they both say. \"But now Zayn has a girl, too,\" Liam says, turning all the attention to Zayn. \"Oh, really? What's her name?\" Alan asks. \"Perri,\" Zayn says, smiling. \"And the three of you? Still single?\" Harry, Niall, and I nod. \"Do you hear that, ladies and gentleman? There are still three members single! There is still a chance!\" We continue with jokes and witty banter. Towards the end of the interview Alan gets up and says, \"So as it is tradition for us, we must have our dance off.\" The six of us get up and line up on one side of the carpet. We have and epic battle in which, if you ask me, we beasted. Alan, though, thinks he won. We finish that, and then get back in the van and go to get some food. Once we finish eating, we head back home. \"So next week, they want us on The Late Late Show,\" Liam tells us, looking at a message he just received. \"In Ireland?\" I ask. I remember seeing a video of them on the show. \"I can see if my mom will come up and make us food,\" Niall says, ignoring my question completely, but at the same time answering it. After that we stop talking. Zayn falls asleep against the window and I'm trying my hardest to stay awake. We get home; I edit my videos together and post it on YouTube. Then, I literally fall into bed and pass out.[Chapter 26] I wake up the next morning before Niall. I decide not to wake him so I stay in my room. I pull out a book that Sarah sent me a few days ago. She liked it so much, she just had to send it. I've gotten better about keeping her updated. Even when I forget, she calls or text me. She tells me about things that are happening back home. I had to get a new number with all my old friends trying to get in touch with the boys. She is one of the only people from home with my new number. Eventually, I pick up my phone and check the date. It's September 6, 7 days before Niall's birthday. I start thinking about what I want to do for him. I want to get him an awesome cake, but what? What should it look like? What should I get him for a present? It's almost noon. I'm still in bed reading when Niall walks in and tells me he is going golfing for the day. He kisses me goodbye and is out the door. I call Eleanor and ask if she want to get together. I'm in desperate need of a mani-pedi. Eleanor and I find a nail salon and spend the day planning. She has agreed to help me plan a surprise party for Niall. We call Ireland to make sure his family is willing to help a lot since we will be there for the party. \"So we need to send out the invites, and order the cake. Any plans for that?\" Eleanor asks me over dinner. We have spent the whole day together planning and having fun. \"I was thinking a guitar. An acoustic, with Niall and me sitting in the hole and the boys around the bottom. Is that too much?\" \"No it's perfect!\" she exclaims. We spend the next few days together, again, planning. On Wednesday the boys and I leave for Ireland. Eleanor comes behind us to help set up for the party. On Thursday, it's time to The Late Late Show.[Chapter 27] \"so tonight we have one, well technically six, special guest. Please welcome One Direction!\" Ryan Tubridy announces, once we are set up to perform our first song. We have a whole hour at the show, in which we are the only guest. We finish the song and go to commercial break. We go backstage and I pull niall over to the side. \"if he asks, I want to tell them,\" I say. He seems to be on my page and I don't have to explain more. We go back out and, of course, one of the first questions he ask is about relationships. \"so last time we had you boys here in Ireland, three of you had girlfriends. For the audience, who is single?\" Harry is the only one to raise his hand. Louis, Liam, and Zayn give Niall and me looks of confusion. \"So out of the boys, Niall, you are the only one that's changed. Can I ask her name?\" Ryan asks. He comes straight out with it, no hesitation. \"Cori.\" \"this Cori?\" Ryan inquires, pointing to me. \"yep,\" Niall responds. \"this Cori,\" he says taking my hand. I smile and nod in agreement. By the end of the interview, we have been given our dolls (which all the boys striped in variations, while mine stayed fully clothed because it looked fabulous as it was),played games, and performed several more songs. We make our way back to the hotel and head straight to bed. Tomorrow is a big day, after all.[Chapter 28] I wake up early the next morning. we are staying in a hotel so I leave a note on Niall's bedside table saying I'm running out to do some shopping; in reality I'm going to the hotel where we are having his party. I meet Eleanor outside and we walk in. the people at the hotel have been setting up all morning. There is a dance floor, tables everywhere and a few tables set up for food. All the decorations and table cloths are green, orange, white, and blue. It looks amazing. Eleanor and I are looking around when Bobby walks in. \"So what do you think?\" he asks, catching us off guard. \"Bobby!\" I run up to him and hug him. \"It looks amazing! As do you, Bobby,\" I add with a smile. \"Hell love it. Thank you.\" \"You look lovely as well, Cori. It's great to see you.\" \"So the cake and the caterers will get here at 5:30 and guest should get here at 6,\"Elanoresays as she makes her way over to us. \"Hi Bobby.\" \"Eleanor, still with Louis?\" \"Yes sir, going strong,\" she says smiling. \"Ok so ill bring Niall around 6:30, which reminds me, I should get back. See you later Bobby! Eleanor, text me if there is anything new! Bye!\" I say as I run out and head back to the hotel. It's only about 11:30 when I get back and Niall is still asleep. I run over to Liam's room to grab another little package out of my bag. I lay the gifts next to Niall on his bed. Then I gently shake him awake. \"Good morning, birthday boy.\" \"Good morning. What's this?\"He says when he notices the gifts. \"Why don't you open it up and see?\" He sits up and grabs the gifts next to him. He opens the big one first. \"Are you serious? You got me a new guitar?\" \"And a new notebook to write some more amazing songs. It's in the bottom of the case.\" \"Thank you beautiful,\" he says as he leans over to give me a kiss. \"Now open the other one,\" I say, handing him the package. He opens it and pulls out a dog tag. \"A dog tag?\" he asks confused. \"Well that's only part of the gift. The collar is with a new puppy back home,\" I answer. He just gives me a look of shock, so I continue. \"So what would you like to do today? Go out for a nice lunch or play with your new guitar and order room service?\" \"Room service. But you have to promise not to run out again.\" \"You noticed?\" \"Yea. But it's ok.\" He adds with a smile. \"I promise to stay right here. But you still have to get dressed eventually. I have reservations for dinner at 6.\" \"I can do that,\" he says getting out of bed to get ready for the day. Soon enough it's almost 6 and time for us to leave. ","Summary":" Hey guys. So I'm sorry I am not able to post very often. The internet at my house sucks and it can "}]
