Walt Whitman \"Leaves of grass\" found in the book by John Green. -HOOOOOW? I closed my eyes and jerked the handset away from your ear, because my friend screaming like it was being cut. -Oh my God, Skittles, can you keep it down? – I asked, leaning on the hood of his car. -NOOOO! - again coming from the tube. – Seriously, how could you persuade Tina DeMour to go to prom with you? She is the coolest chick of the school, and you're just a sucker! -Thanks, – I muttered. -No offense, dude, you know it's true! replied Skeeth. That was actually true. I was one of those called a loser and one big tough guys locked in the ladies' room. It was not always, of course, easy for me sometimes as I remembered, and I found myself head in the trash. I was all angry, but I did not complain because they do not see the point. These guys are in any case will make me, so I suffered in silence, gave them enough of it, and when they finished, I sighed with relief. I was happy with such a life. I had friends at school, the same absurd and unlucky guys, like me, and yet I had two best friends, they really are the guys with the strange, but, seriously, we were fine. And Tina DeMour it ... it was Tina DeMour . It was the sexiest, most beautiful and the hottest girl in school. And it was done for a bitch. Everyone wanted Tina DeMour, but, as expected, chose the coolest guy in school, the last bastard Curtis Forster, and they are really well-suited to each other. For their personal life watched the whole school because girls could not wait to get Curtis will be free, and the guys waiting for opportunities to roll up to the Tine without being tucked Curtis in the trash. It was really rubbish. But it was a very steep rubbish, so everything and everyone wanted her. The fact that we were to go together to the prom, it came quite by accident. Naturally, Tina DeMour would not want to ever go even next to me on the same street, not to mention the main party for the whole school life, I just was not at that time in that place. I forgot my textbook in algebra, and at recess I had to go back for him. There I found Tina and Curtis, they loudly swore, she waved a hand, and he told her to calm down. I decided to just quickly take your book and leave, until I noticed, and that's when I almost left the room, Tina suddenly said, \"Well, go to that slut! I'm not going to any prom!\" For anybody not a secret that Curtis is periodically fucked with Hayley Gibbs. «Well, that will show up at the prom alone?» asked Curtis, and I saw Tina's cheeks turned pink. Of course, what could be worse than to come to the prom alone. It seems funny but when you're eighteen, and before the end of school was only one month, there is nothing more important than prom. And then Tina looked at me and said, «I'll go with him!». Curtis initially laughed, but when they realized that dear not joking, he spat on the floor and quickly left the room, hurt hurting my shoulder, and I was left alone with the hottest girl in school, and my palms began to sweat. «Find tuxedo decently and try not to look like a Scarecrow» – threw me Tina and also went out. And then I realized – I'm going to prom with Tina DeMour. Of course, I knew that she only did it to spite Curtis, like such a tough guy as he she traded on this sucker like me, but I'm absolutely not worried about, because Yes, this is Tina DeMour, and she was going to prom with me. Besides, I still didn't have a date. -Do you have any idea how lucky you are? – do not let the Skittles. – But as for me, you don't deserve it. You don't even know what to do with it! In your place I should be, I know how to treat a lady. -That's why you go to prom with bespectacled Susie from a brass band? – I asked. -Well, – said a Skeet. But maybe after the ball she play the pipe in my pipe... I laughed. Skittles was unbearable. Actually his name was Charlie, but in the sixth class he threw up right on the lesson of literature in front of everyone. I don't know what he had for breakfast, but his vomit has had a very strange color. Someone said, \"our Charlie pukes a rainbow\" and since then, the nickname Skittles firmly rooted to him, and we know she's with him for life. Skittles was terribly vulgar and could twenty-four hours a day to talk about pussy and kamasutra, it's disgusting just playing Xbox and decided that he is worth, he will not go to College a virgin. But, it seems that all the girls of our school have agreed, because who would Skeeth nor drove, the answer was always the same: \"yeah, I'm with you lie down in bed, and you're going to puke on me\". Seriously, school is a scary place. Once you mess up, and you will never forget. In general, Skittles was just as loser as I am. Maybe that's why we became friends. We're complete losers, and this unites us. -Where are you now? asked Skittles. – I don't want to call me, I will chop the PlayStation. -I near the house, ' I replied. Sitting on his wheelbarrow. -OK, we all understand that you have got a car and you're a cool guy, but, dude, come on, it's not even new, it is already someone went!– prayed Skittles. I just laughed because the three of us I was the only one who had a car, and I never ceased to remind them about it. Yes, supported and a bit worn, but mine! -I can't come, parents waiting at home, ' I said. – Call Keith, maybe he will come. -This asshole fun with my girlfriend. Keith was the only one of us who was a girl. That is not a desperate attempt not to be left without a date to prom – as I had with Tina DeMour and bespectacled Skeet with Susie and the real girl they had been Dating for three months. She was pretty cute and very sociable, played the guitar and was preparing for admission to a good Institute. We Skeet had no idea what she found in Keith, but he was crazy about her and holding her like a treasure. This is not surprising, he did not find. So, it was us. I, Skittles and Keith. Three desperate loser. Skittles muttered something about the fact that we are all devious bastards, said goodbye until tomorrow and passed out. I was again left in silence. The first day of may came to an end, and I enjoyed the warm wind, thinking that in a month I'll be out of school. -Dude, you have a napkin or something ? turned around and saw that about my car is some guy and carefully examines his t-shirt. -You turn to me? – hesitantly I asked. -Do you see anyone else here? he looked at me like I was stupid. -Uh, no, uh... Frank? -Oh,- he was surprised. – Do you know me? Of course. Who does not know the legendary Frank Iero. Magic tricks, which he constantly threw, was known to everyone in school. This guy is just a celebrity. I heard that once he came in the morning from home to school, and instead drove off in the car his father to California and hung out there for three days forty three bucks. And I someone told me that one night he climbed into our city Park, found there a water-filled pool and swam in it directly into clothing, while at dawn it is not caught by the security guard. Said that this guy was a drug addict. I didn't know whether it's true or not, but there were rumors that someone saw him in the toilet puking blood. In any case, this guy was not all right, because no normal person will not come back at night to swim in the water Park. -Yes, we learn from you at school,- I said. -Really? – he indifferently shrugged his shoulders. – I don't remember you. Of course. All knew Frank Iero, but the Frank Iero didn't know anyone. I looked at him. He was short in stature, very pale and skinny, and it actually kind of confirms the idea that he is taking drugs. On his neck was a tattoo of a scorpion in the lip gleamed the ring, and long black bangs constantly falling in his eyes. I was never with him so close. First, because I've never stood so close to him and secondly, he seldom went to school, so I know it was him. He suddenly coughed, and I realized that it is something I have asked and waited for an answer. I continued to stare. He was just weird. Everything in my life was laid out on shelves: Skittles and Keith – my friends, Tina dear sexy, but lousy, the big boys from school sometimes bullied me, an album of drawings you need to always keep to himself, my brother Mikey the moron parents are annoying, but I love them. It was all orderly, familiar and ordinary, but he was somehow wrong, hurt his eyes as big troubled spot. He knocked out all systems, and he was nowhere, he was something new, fresh and intimidating. -Dude, you have a napkin or not?! – irritably asked Frank, and I finally heard it. -No... no, I don't have, I said, why do you ask? -Yes, I just... -Here it is! Get him! I heard a rough male voice and saw from the opposite end of the street us run two cops. I knew I did nothing but panic and fear swept over me. I stood still and watched from approaching the police, yet didn't feel a real push in the back and have not heard Frank's voice. -Quickly get in the car! he shouted, sitting down on the passenger seat. – Quickly get in and start the engine! Two uniforms were almost there, and I quickly ran to the car, climbed into the cabin, and hit the gas pedal, not even being able to fully close the door. I had no idea what just happened, I just drove on the street the evening clinging firmly to the wheel and Frank beside laughed loudly and shouted something through the open window. -What the fuck was that?! – I yelled, continuing to push the gas pedal to the floor and nervously looking at the road, feeling like heart is beating in my chest. -We got away from the cops cheerfully replied Frank, and I noticed that he was fumbling fastened in place despite the fact that I drove too fast. -Why?! What happened?! Why I ran?! Frank rolled his eyes and showed his hands, covered in green paint, and the same green spot on his shirt. -I just painted a monument to Mark Twain in a green color, and the cops I got caught and had to escape, – he explained, – I thought I lost them, and they still found me! Thanks for help, – he grinned, and I decided that he just laughs at me. -You ruined historical monument?! – I shouted. And got me into this shit?! -Calm down, irritably, he responded, – I think they can remember your face? -They could remember the number of my car! -\"Oh,\" he seemed puzzled - Yes, you're right, they probably did. I muffled groaned and abruptly stopped the car. I wanted to smash the guy's head off, but I was too scared and squeezed, and all that I had is pressed his forehead to the steering wheel and breathe deeply. -Oh, don't worry, they won't do anything, he said. – Believe me! -Believe the guy who only does that to get involved in trouble?! – sarcastically I replied. – Oh, well. He only snorted: -Behave like a cowardly girl. -Not true! – cried hysterically I'm really reminding myself the girl. I just don't want any trouble! Iero sighed heavily and looked at me with pity. -Yes, Yes, I know – he said casually– you don't want any trouble, so as not to spoil its characteristics, being accepted to College and blah blah blah. -Yes, – said I, – just, damn it, for that! Because which College accept me with a police report on file? -\"Of course,\" he sighed tragically. – What could be more important than the Institute? -Tha… - I stopped short, realizing that he's mocking me. – Fuck you. He laughed and said: -You're so sweet. -What?! Iero laughed again, and I felt like a stupid idiot who is bullied, and he just sits and looks at it. -No, but seriously, he said. – All these «Oh no, I need to go to College, I can't skip school, Oh God, I need to be home by ten p.m. » it's really nice, like you're nine years old, he smiled again. -Himself-something very old, I snapped. -Well, at least I'm in good spirits, he smiled. -Yes... I – I hesitated. I wanted to say \"me too funny\", but remembering how to pass my Friday in the company of pizza, vulgar stories of the monastery, forever speaking about his girl whale and consoles, I decided to remain silent. \"Nothing,\" I said, ' I just can't right now afford to. Here you pass the exams, go to College and then come off. -Yeah as if! – he yelled, smiling like a sore. – As always! -How so? I asked in shock, turning away from him. -In school you think that you first need to go to College, and there you will come off, but at the Institute you're thinking well, sure, only will pass the first session and relax, but then you think better to wait until you graduate, and then you'll be free and be able to break away, but then you go to work, and time again, no, you promised yourself that will come off on Friday, and here you suddenly understand that you're eighty, and you kind of want something to do, Oh Yes, relax, but damn, man, your legs will not hold, and the bladder and then leads you, and you're like, \"Oh shit!\". I looked at him as a madman, while he shouted and waved his arm with a perfectly abnormal appearance, smiling broadly, and his eyes reflected the light of street lamps and at this moment, the first day of may Frank Iero in my car looked like absolutely crazy. -You know what I mean? he asked, peering into my face with his big eyes. – Do you understand? I smiled wryly and nodded. -Dude, he made the face with a brick – you have a facial expression like you're now going to shit. And he laughed again, and I felt like blushing. -It's all true, – I mumbled, – I know how to have fun, and I'm not delaying it. -You believe yourself? – he questioningly raised an eyebrow. I just vaguely mumbled something in response. He smiled sweetly. -You know, I have two more weeks, he said. – Want to have fun with me? -What? With you? Two weeks? To have some fun? What? -Agree, – Iero again smiled widely, turning to me. – I promise you seven unforgettable adventure! -What?! – the end confused me. Iero rolled his eyes and grinned. -So, – he said, opening the door of my car for two weeks, we will have fun together. But only for two weeks. -What are you talking about? again I asked, but he already jumped out of the car. – Will we meet again? How?! -I will find you! he shouted and disappeared behind the trees. I have a few moments of staring to where all a few seconds ago was his silhouette, and then started the engine and completely baffled I went home. ================== ==== ============== first adventure: I never======================================= The next day I woke up at two in the morning from a loud noise outside the window. Something persistently banged on the glass, and half asleep I thought of the maniacs who steal children at night from their bedrooms. But then I decided that the maniac wouldn't be so careful to knock, so I got out of bed and went to the window. From behind the glass looked at me pale and happy face Frank. I lifted the latch and gently opened the window in shock staring at Frank Iero, who never talked to me in high school who never noticed me, which I knew a little more than twenty-four hours and who was at my window at two in the morning and non-transferable smiled broadly. -What are you doing here? – I hissed as quietly as possible. -It's adventure time! – he screaming, and I panicked shushing him, trying to shut. -You'll Wake everyone! -Get dressed! -Where?! Frank looked at me wild-eyed, and his smile was so wide that I would have honestly had him asylum, if the clock showed two in the morning, and he wasn't so damn shocked. -What the hell are you doing here? – I whispered, shivering from the cool night air. -What – protested Frank, – what about our seven adventures? -First, I do not agree, and secondly, what day is not? -No, he answered uncompromisingly. I rubbed the bridge of his nose, sighing heavily. -You know I'm serious anywhere with you not going? -You do realize that if you don't come to me, I scream so loud that will Wake up the whole house? -My parents will call the police. -I will say that I'm your friend. -Goat. He smiled, and I yawn, went to look for his clothes in the dark. Ten minutes later we were driving in my car through the empty night streets towards the little round-the-clock eatery, because Frank said he wants coffee, and I would not refuse one Cup. -Today we are going to the zoo, he said, when I parked the car under the dim lamp. -Yeah, good luck – I yawned, pushing the door of the diner and stepping inside. -What is this tone? – asked Frank, when the cashier left to fulfill our order: two of doppio with sugar. -Nothing, I replied, just happy to see how you're going to buy tickets to half past two nights. We got two drinks, paid and went outside, returning to the car. -Well... – said Frank, sitting on the seat with the Cup – it is not very illegal entry. I choked on his coffee and stared in horror at him, for the umpteenth time cursing himself that he go with him somewhere. -No, – cut I don't even think about. Seriously. We're going home. Now. -Don't be a coward – just snapped Frank. – Too late to stop. Don't you wanna have some fun? I hesitantly looked at him. If I wanted to break away? If I wanted to get out of your routine and get away with the craziest guy in school, and then tell everyone about it? Of course I wanted! But we could catch to take to the police, to put it in a personal matter, and then good-bye PA and all my hopes to go to College. But if we get caught... – I sighed. -Let's go! – screamed a joyful Frank. We got ten minutes, but three minutes we spent on the detour, because Frank said that only complete idiots make illegal entry from the main entrance. And another five minutes we had to go on foot, leave the car too close was too dangerous. Trying to be as inconspicuous, we walked in complete silence, but I think something got stuck, and Frank and then hissed at me. In the end we came to a high iron fence two meters tall. Frank was of inches shorter than me, but he was able to climb much easier and quieter, because I could not throw my leg and nearly fell on my head. When I finally sat down next to him, he muttered something about how I'm clumsy, and again we quietly parrales forward. We were at the far end of the zoo, there was overgrown uncut grass, and the cages began only ten meters. Frank went ahead of me, I trailed behind him, getting tangled in the grass and continuing to swear quietly. The first one we saw was the tigers. Three just terribly scary animals slept in his cage, and sleepily lifted its muzzle, when Frank shone on them as its inexplicable flashlight. Apparently, this guy is thoroughly prepared. -Are not you afraid that your light will notice? quietly I asked, getting up next to him. -Gee, look how beautiful they are, whispered Frank, with a delighted smile, watching as a tiger, stretching himself, yawned widely, Baring his huge fangs. -You that, the zoo was never? – I smiled. -Nah – answered Frank. I looked at him in surprise. -That's why we came here, he said. I thought all the children ever been to the zoo. -I'm not all. I just shrugged and we went on. Of course, not all the animals were in their cages, some of them have withdrawn for the night, but we were able to see different birds, wolf, little meerkats, porcupine and sleeping monkeys. Frank long was detained with his flashlight each enclosure, watching the animals happily and without ceasing to smile, reminiscent of a child. -You really never been to the zoo? – I asked while we were trying to see the stork in a cage high above our heads. -Okay, he said, twirling his flashlight in different directions. Then why are you not just buy the tickets and how all the normal people are gone during the day? -Well, Frank shrugged, continuing to look up – we must hurry. Suddenly I die tomorrow, and not going to the zoo? Besides – he grinned – so much fun. -Iron logic, – I muttered, – here it, look! And in that moment, when we have darted white bird, somewhere came the loud whistle of the guard, who apparently noticed that at the zoo there is someone. I didn't have time to figure out how somewhere to run over Frank, who was clutching my arm and dragging. We were already at the fence at the end of the zoo, when someone's flashlight shone on us. -To stand! I said stop! Frank as fast as the first time climbed to the other side, and horribly frightened, I literally flew over the fence, plopping down on his ass in a mud puddle. But Frank did not give me time to hesitate, grabbing my hand and we quickly ran to the side of the machine, catching curses guard who remained on the other side of the fence. Gasping, I fell on the hood of the car, spread-eagled star and frantically gulping air while Frank laughed loudly somewhere behind me. I wanted to say that he's just a jerk, but my heart was pounding so I lay still and breathe deeply until the lunatic jumped and rejoiced, not knowing what in the ass almost got us killed. -Gee, ' he said, still smiling cheerfully, – we have to go, he can call the cops. -Damn! – I quickly jumped to his feet and got in the car, urging Frank to do the same. He was still laughing when we left away from the zoo. At first I evil glances at him, but then this situation suddenly started to seem to me very funny, and I smiled, because it was really fun. If I told anyone that I got in a zoo at night, and then ran away from the guard, I would never have believed it. Because it was me, Gerard way, the guy who's never even been late to school. And this is me at four o'clock in the morning with a wet ass drove through the city in the company of a crazy guy who probably was a drug addict. Frank called me his address and I drove him to the house. We got out of the car, and looking at wet ass of my seat, I noticed how, without even saying goodbye, he went to the porch. -Hey! – I shouted. – Where are you going?! -What, do you have any more suggestions for tonight? mockingly he replied. -But... -We have six more adventures, I'll come for you! And he again ran away from me, disappeared somewhere in the darkness, and I remained lost and hopeless. ======================== adventure the second: the cleanest thing in the world ========================== Two days later at my window knocked again. Frank was a little clueless, because I was preparing for my exam in French, but this time he did not come at two o'clock, and only four nights, and for that I was grateful. -You know that there is such a thing as the door, and you could Lord, what are you doing here in the rain?! He was standing in front of my window again, smiled broadly, gathered again me something to draw and he was soaking wet, his face dripping drops of water, and he, God, still smiling, and behind him the pouring rain beat against the asphalt. -Went for a walk? – happily he asked. -Now? – stupidly I asked. -Yeah. -But it's raining. -This is why right now. -My parents are sitting downstairs, I can't go anywhere! -Get out to me through the window! What was I supposed to do? The street was pouring rain, my room was warm and dry, Frank Iero was pale, drenched and happy, and I wanted to go with him. -Can I at least wear a hoodie? I asked, agreeing to whatever he is now, no idea. -No! – happily replied Frank. I sighed, opened the window wider and climbed out to him as I was in a thin t-shirt, pajama pants and Slippers, and the cold rain immediately enveloped me from all sides, forcing trembled, but Frank looked so incredible with a happy smile on blue lips that I forgot about everything. He quickly grabbed my hand and we ran forward through the mist of rain, breaking the puddles on the asphalt, he in sneakers, I'm in sneakers, the drops on my skin was cold, his palm – hot, my room was a lot more of unlearned lessons, and I was free. I just ran after him, clutching his hand in mine, knowing that this is probably what I so long wanted. I never complained because I never really thought about it. But I ran under cold and fresh rain and realized how dusty, sweaty and muggy was my life. My life was a scorching desert, and Frankie was clean and fresh with rain, and I was holding his hand while he ran, and I have no words escaped him. He took me to the waterfront, such as cold and completely deserted, and with the same confidence he dragged me straight to the water. I said something, but because of the rain nothing was heard, and he kept on walking and when we were standing waist-deep in the river, he flopped into the water, drenching me with icy wave. I would have protested, but I was soaking wet, and Frank laughed again, and he again looked stunning... free, and I laughed along with him, too brizgys, and something was screaming, he jumped on me and we both fell into the water. -Gerard! – shouted Frank, trying to drown the noise of the rain. -What? – shouted in response I. He pointed to the side. -Your sneaker floating away! He laughed again. I've never seen such genuinely happy people. He finely shook from the cold and continued to jump in the water, bringas and laughing loudly, and it seemed to me that in his children's eyes the color of walnut I saw life itself. We swam for another ten minutes until the legs are completely numb from the cold, and the rain has not ended. Frank quickly got to the beach, completely soaked, and I got out behind him. And we went back home, engaging in deep puddles and laughing loudly because his shoes squelched funny, I was in one thin, wet slipper. ==================== adventure the third: wash the make-up - there is only despair ======================== -Gee, that was two days ago? I slammed the fridge and turned to his brother who stood in front of me and with a very serious face chewed toast. -What do you mean? I asked, grabbing up a piece of bread. -I saw you left the house in a rainstorm. -Maybe I wanted to walk. -Frank Iero. -Mikey... I seriously gasped. -Listen, Gee, – he said – about him why not just tell. -And that each rumor be trusted now? – I snapped. -Don't start, retorted Mike. – He's weird, he was seen several times vomit blood, he's doing hell knows what. Yes, you can see for yourself what it's like! I don't want you to... -Know... – I growled. – You... -Well? -Suck! I threw the sandwich on the table, grabbed his backpack from the chair and quickly walked out of the kitchen, catching behind him, \"fucking very Mature of you, Gee!\". I power slammed the front door and walked down the asphalt path, wishing that the words of the brother were not true. I was angry not because he climbed in my life, but because he was right. And I desperately didn't want to think that Frank Iero, the guy that made me feel a little happier, not much more than a drug addict. I just like to imagine all these crazy things is he, and not the drugs he takes. -Hi. I raised my head and saw that Frank was standing in my driveway of my house, leaning on the door of a shabby old Cadillac and a cute smile. -What are you doing here? – I asked, coming closer and looking at the car. -I just today also go to school, ' he replied. Decided to come to you. -Really? You? To school? -The dam and get in the car, he chuckled and walked around the Cadillac and getting in the driver's seat. -Okay, – I agreed, sitting down next to me. We drove in complete silence. Frank was watching the road, shaking his head to the beat of some pop song from a decrepit radio, and I looked out the window at the bright sunshine the streets and thought about his. -Frank? I asked after five minutes. -Yes? – happily he said. -We drove right turn... -Really? – he was surprised. -Yeah... - Well, okay, maybe we're not quite to school. -Iero! – I shouted, suddenly realizing that this fucking asshole just cheated me. What the fuck's up?! He just shrugged, smiled and turned the music louder, turning away from me. -I ask you, what have you invented?! Fuck, Frank, what's wrong with you! – do not let me, but he pretended that he didn't hear me, you fucking bastard, and I surrendered, leaning back and angrily looking at him. -Asshole! We only stayed half an hour, a few hundred miles from home right in front of a huge, new supermarket. It was built a few years and finished just a couple of months ago, and is on it was covered the entire town and covered all local TV. And why are we here? I asked, looking at the bright building through the windshield. -«Come on,» I threw Frank and got out of the car, and I, as always, followed him. What was played in the commercials on TV, did not go to any comparison with what I saw. The higher shelves were like skyscrapers, shelves bursting with all kinds of goods, and the little people, which even at nine in the morning on a weekday there were so many, scurried here and there, from something to something ringing and trucks colliding in the wide aisles. People say that everything is here, but I didn't know that there really has everything from baby diapers to table lamps. I went and looked around as if was never in stores. But everything really was this big and it was so much that I just could not help myself. I got so carried away that did not notice how Frank is in front of me stopped, and I crashed into him. -Damn, Frankie, I'm sorry. Um... we came here for the ketchup? Frank smiled broadly, looking at me and twirling in the hands of the red bottle, which he probably managed to take while I was looking around. I looked around and saw that we were standing in the clothing Department, where there were a few more people. We came for the ketchup and a new shirt? – ironically I asked. We came to commit murder. – happily replied Frank, and seizing my hand, he pulled me into one of the two spacious fitting rooms, zadernuv curtain behind us. – Here, give me your hand. I foolishly held out his hand, and he quickly opened the jar and poured the fucking ketchup directly into my palm! -What are you doing?! – I screamed in shock, staring at him with his dirty hand, and Frank only smiled and did the same with his hand. -\"Look,\" he said, and abruptly slammed his hand into the wall of the dressing, holding it down a bit and leaving a blood-red trail, which did indeed look like the real thing. -What are you doing? – I asked, again smiling at the antics of this guy. Frankie. -Shut up and do as he said and again put his hand in ketchup. And I again was nothing left but to do as he said. We left bloody stains on the walls, on the floor, big mirror and did not stop a silly giggle. \"Imagine,\" puffed Frankie quietly, smiling broadly and chuckling quietly, someone will come and attack. When we finished, the dressing room looked like the site of a terrible murder. The only thing screwed up is the obvious smell of ketchup, but even with this Frankie did: he just sprayed deodorant everywhere, who also managed to grab in the cosmetics Department. And this mixture of ketchup and deodorant that smelled like there really is someone dismembered. -Perfectly, – has taken out the verdict I. – But, Frankie... -We don't get caught, Gee – interrupted Frank. – And if you get caught... we'll run away. He smiled his sly smile, which clearly read: \"I wish you had contacted me, dude, but we're everywhere get out\" and I honestly believed him. With an entirely innocent persons we came out of the dressing room and walked slowly along the shelves with clothes, pretending we're very interested in looking at women's dresses. I was going to get out of this division, as Frank once again pulled on my arm and nodded off to the side. Not far from us near the hanger on which hung a long spring coat, a woman stood and carefully looked at each of them. -«Come on, » Frankie whispered and bent over, went to her side, and I, as always, not understanding anything, just quietly followed him. We got to the woman, standing on the other side of the hanger, still squatting so she could not see. I wanted to say something, but Frank put a finger to his lips, and I shut up. He rose slightly on his feet and, once again, looking at the woman, suddenly whispered: -Buy me... I looked puzzled at him and also rose slightly on his feet. The woman in confusion looked around, frowning, and then exhaling again began looking through the coat, looking incredulously at them. -Buy me... - again whispered Frankie. She was in shock, he straightened his arms and quickly ran away, hitting a couple of shelves, and I broke down and laughed out loud, looking at the pretty smiling Frankie, who was clearly very proud of himself. -Frankie, that was- -AAAAAAAAA! We and twenty others nearby, turned around sharply on someone's cry, and saw a girl, with terrible screams, running out of the dressing room. We laughed, probably too loudly, because people are very confused. Someone just turned away, pretending nothing happened and continued to consider things, and someone carefully put everything back in place and with a straight face, came out of the Department. And Frankie just laughed, and I honestly expected that we now will be asked to leave the store and never going back to back. So we partied for a few hours. Frankie dragged me around the store, managing to do a bunch of different shit and go unnoticed. We would exchange milk sausage ball, fancied myself a cool guitar playing on broomsticks, fought on the baguettes as swords, embraced with huge soft toys, I put little notes in different books, twenty-three, no, really, I counted exactly twenty-three times, rode on the escalator and did a lot of things, which ought not to have done. I kind of had to get mad at him because he lied to me, and because of him I got to school, but looking at how he was talking with live fish in the aquarium, I could only think that he is just incredibly handsome when smiling so sincerely. And then Frank suddenly said we should go because we can start to attract attention. Therefore, taking coke and Oh my gosh, Mentos, he paid and headed for the exit, and I again walked behind him, wondering how in such a small and fragile so vivid and abnormal. We went outside and stopped right in front of the store. Frank opened a bottle of Cola and putting it on the ground under our feet, looked at me. -That I've always wanted to try, he said, and then threw three tablets of Mentos and then ran off to the side, and I was confused and remained standing in place, and a powerful fountain soda poured over me from head to toe. Frankie pressed a hand to her mouth and laughed, people on the street in shock looked at me, and I stood like a moron, and I was dripping Cola. -Why didn't you move? asked Frankie, looking at the scale of the tragedy and laughing – God, Gee, I'm sorry! I said nothing, staring at a large foamy puddle around him, and then looked up and met his amused look and smiled back. And I would probably have stood, but Frankie came up to me and, grinning, took my sticky hand and dragged him toward the car. -What am I gonna do with you? – he lamented, putting me in the passenger seat, despite my protests that I'd get him the car. -It is unlikely I ever will be useful, ' he said, sitting down next to me and a factory engine. -What do you mean? I asked, wiping her wet sticky hands on the wet sticky pants. -Well, drawled Frank, I just leave. -So you said we only have two weeks? -Yeah, he nodded. -Where to go? – I asked. -Far and forever, – he said. I just shrugged, the rest of the ride we drove in silence. Frank drove me home, and when I crawled out of the car, leaving a puddle on the seat, he also came, looking me from head to toe. -You now lick it, ' said Frank, smiling. -Just don't do it, – I smiled. -Well, how much What? -I... -Frank? Frankie? Jesus, Frankie, what's wrong with you?! I stared in horror at Frank, who, clutching his stomach, keeled over and fell on his knees on the asphalt. He coughed heavily, and I stood there, paralyzed with fear, looking at his trembling shoulders, and didn't know what I need to do. And when I already made the first step towards it, it suddenly threw up blood, and I quickly pulled back. -I... I'm fine, – he gasped, lifting his head and wiping his mouth with a sleeve. And I first really saw him. I saw something that was really not what I wanted to see. Frankie was very skinny and pale. Under the eyes, which I admired, took cover dark bruises on his hands clearly were the pale blue of veins under the thin skin, his chapped lips were bitten, and on the fingers and palms everywhere flashed a small scratch. He was dressed all in black, even in such a warm may, and he looked really weak and depressed. -What are you looking at? he asked, noticing my view – fear that they will die from overdose right in front of your house? I suddenly felt terribly ashamed of him for thinking that, and I for a moment closed my eyes while taking a deep breath, and when looked back at Frankie, he was standing in front of me, holding on to an open car door, because his legs were trembling. -\"you know,\" he said, ' when will my funeral, you're in. There are Scorpions , beer and eclairs. -What are you saying... -I'll see you later? I will come for you. And he got in the car, started the engine and drove away – as always – without saying goodbye, leaving a confused and distraught. And I suddenly felt my pain. Because this is the beautiful Frankie Iero was just a drug addict. A drug addict, with whom I desperately wanted to see at least once. ====================adventure the fourth: why'd you bring a shotgun to the party?===== =================== -You won't believe! I turned around, shielding his eyes from the blinding sun, and saw quickly walking to me, Skeet. -What happened? I asked, looking at breathing wrath of the other. -What happened?! – he shouted. – These monsters poured the first year of PISS! -What?! Skeet sat next to me on the bench and threw his briefcase nearby. -Curtis with his friends? – I asked. -\"Yes,\" replied Skeet. – They pissed in the bottle and poured it for Tim, Pete and Danny. -Oh God, are you serious? – I groaned. The Hermitage didn't have to answer, because at this point we were approached by Tim and plopped down beside us on the grass. He was wet and angry. -Washed in the toilet and now all day have to walk wet. Goats! it in his pocket. -And you urine smells – put the Skit. Tim only made a face. -Seriously, why do they do it? – continued Smarties. -Because we allow it to them? – I assumed. -Damn. -Hey, what so funny early in the morning? Terribly happy whale landed on the warm grass next to Tim, and immediately winced. -What is that smell? -These freaks poured the first year, urine – answer Skeet. Sucks – handed Keith. I wanted to say something, but suddenly noticed on the other end of the school yard of Frank, who smiled and waved back, trying to attract attention. I muttered friends, \"see you\" and headed in his direction, anticipating and fearing at the same time that he came up with. -Hey! he said, smiling widely. -What are you doing here? – immediately I asked. -I can't come to school? – offended he. -You? -Well, okay! I laughed softly, and Frankie smiled again. -I will go today to classes, he said. -Yes? -Well, just for one lesson. At first. -Why first? – I asked. -Because! – important Frank said. Because, firstly, it is English that we're going together, and secondly, because it's a lesson Miller. I looked incredulously at Frank. Mr. Miller was the meanest teacher in the school. It was harmful, vindictive, he could not agree, the kind of suffering disciples he was getting a strange pleasure, he often gave all flash tests, is not allowed in class late, never late myself, never took a sick leave in General, represented all the sins, which can only be a school teacher. Love him not only students, but teachers, but Miller, it seems, is not a bit worried: he continued to behave like an ass and was quite pleased with himself. And I knew exactly what Frank was up to something bad, going to class to nasty teacher in the world. -Frank - ' I began, but at that moment we heard the first call, and he waved right in front of me ran off again, not waiting to hear me. You just Frank Iero talking about? Smarties and kit stood next to me, looking at the fleeing and Bouncing Iero. -Whatever, – I gasped. -Here even do not want to know – said Keith, come to class. I sat down at his usual spot and immediately saw Frank, who sat at the next Desk, calm, ready for the lesson and satisfied. Exactly with the second call to the class included Miller, and all was quiet. We were \"Pride and prejudice\" and I just could not believe that on the exam I have to write an essay on this girly novel. -Look who decided to grace us with his presence today! – happily said the Miller, looking at Frank with his trademark look, as always looking at someone when you felt a new victim. Mr. Iero! I thought he shouldn't have done that in vain he even looked at him, but to my surprise... -Hello, Mr. Miller, is quite friendly answered Frank. – Happy to be on your lesson. -And I'm glad to see, ' growled the Miller, and turned back to the Board. Everyone smiled. We knew that Miller deliberately provoke Frank, he always did. Hurt the students, they were angry, snapped, and he had a great reason for punishment. I looked at Frank, smiling. -The best way to deal with goats – it's polite, - he whispered. It took thirty minutes of the lesson. All was quiet, Miller talked about the composition of the novel, we listened and was writing something, and then this happened. Frank suddenly pushed back his chair, rose, and under the surprised looks he climbed on to the Desk. Towering over all, he with a triumphant smile and looked around the class, and then looking straight into the eyes of shocked Mr. Miller and showing a finger at him, said loudly: - Someone kill the DJ, shoot the fucking DJ Voices in my head are saying \"Shoot that fucker down\" And then he just jumped down, grabbed the portfolio and, laughing happily, ran out of room, leaving your textbook, twenty-five of the shocked students and perfect confused Miller. We in silent shock staring at the door, trying to figure out what it was. Some are also puzzled looked at each other and Miller would often blink, and his glasses askew on the bridge of his nose. And we laughed. This crazy bastard looked so uncomfortable that we just could not resist. Always be strict with stupid smug smile, he looked like a small child who has been deprived of candy, and we were loudly laughing at him, banging his fists on the desks and fell to the floor, because that asshole deserved it. After the lesson I found Frank in the school yard, sitting at the dining table and sipping a coke. -Dude, you made a happy twenty-five people at once! I shouted, flying to him and sitting down close by. – God, you're incredible! -I also have made a revolution! He smiled, and the sun was in his happy nut eyes, while I looked at him, alive and present. -I just wanted to do something before you leave. -Relocation and all that? – I asked. -\"Yes,\" he replied. -Okay, let's go to your next class? I said, rising from the bench. -I will not go, ' said Frank. -Why? He slyly smiled. -I said – one lesson. I never come to school. -What about the diploma?! – I exclaimed. -But who needs it – waved Frank. – I have better things to do diploma. I paused. -We have three more adventure. I will come for you. He stood up and walked away from the school, in the side of the road, and I suddenly realized that one of those fourteen days that we had left only five. And it seemed to me that five is desperate enough to forever say goodbye to Frank Iero. =============================== adventure five: «yes» ========================================= Frank showed up two days later on Sunday. I lay on the bed and was reading when he knocked at my window. The dial showed three in the afternoon and it was quiet and Sunny day in may. I opened the window, and Frank immediately got into the room and plopped down on my bed. -Hey, – I said. -You know what I come up with? – conspiratorially he said, smiling widely. -Obviously, no, – I smiled, sitting down next to him. -Today I declare the day \"Y e s!\" happily he declared, looking me in the eye. -And that means... -And this means that today we are going to say \"Yes\"! -Awesome idea – without enthusiasm, handed it to me. -I don't like your attitude, frowning, said Frank. -I just don't see anything cool, – I said – every day I many times say \"Yes.\" -And how many times you say \"no\"? I paused, gazing at Frank. -I bet \"No,\" you say more than \"Yes\"? – frowning, he asked. – Look, – he stood up, Gerard Way, will you go right now in this pajamas with a Bunny to ride on my motorcycle? I stared blankly at my pyjamas with rabbits, thinking that he's serious and offers me direct access to her on the street. I looked at him with a pleading look, but met only with an unwavering commitment to do that. -Apparently, Yes... I gasped. Ten minutes later, we raced on a crazy motorcycle through the Sunny streets and dusty roads, Frank in torn jeans, me in my pajamas and my baby rabbits waving in the wind. I firmly pressed against the back of Frank, hugging his waist, and he gripped the steering wheel and loudly shouted, as we swept past the astonished passers-by. -Gerard! – he shouted, trying to shout over the wind noise in my ears. -What?! – as loud I shouted. -We now go to the store, buy some chips with ice cream and eat it! -Yeah! We stopped at a supermarket. The cashier looked strangely at us, the crazy guy in the helmet and his friend in his pajamas. On the street we quickly found a seat and sat down comfortably, opened a bag of chips. I honestly never could imagine that ice cream and chips is so delicious. Frank just laughed at me while I greedily dipped chips in ice cream and sent it in his mouth. -Iero, you're my life through the ass, ' I said, licking a finger. I'll take that as a compliment, – he grinned. Right now I'll draw you a mustache of ice cream, and you won't even think to resist! -Uh... Yes... – Frank agreed, glancing at me in surprise. I drew him a mustache, which in this warm sun drained him on the chin, and then laughed, looking at how he tried to lick it. -Nice going, asshole,- said Frank, pushing me in the side. We wandered around town, laughing and forcing to do each other silly things. I was just in shock when I found out how happy it can make people simple word \"Yes.\" When we were walking in a public Park, we were approached by an elderly little woman with cardboard box on which was written \"the needs of persons with disabilities\", and without even thinking, Frankie replied in unison \"Yes\" and gave her all the money that was in our pockets. And happy face of this little woman was priceless, but even more I was pleased that after that the rest of the people nearby are similarly approached and threw a couple of dollars in a battered cardboard box. -Sing to me? – asked Frank, when we sat on a bench and watched the slowly setting sun. - «Yes», I answered quietly. I sang to him about what was important. On someone's smile and someone's eyes, someone by the ears in love with life. About happiness from one meeting, about how little time is left and how someone will be someone insufferable to get bored. Frank laid his head on my shoulder and quietly listened, and I was sure he understood everything. -You have beautiful eyes, g he said when I finished. – Do you know what green means? - «No»,- I replied. -Is the color of hope. We said goodbye when it was eleven. He again told me «bye» and ran away in the most unexpected moment, and I quietly went home, thinking only about the fact that we only have three days and two adventures. ======================== sixth adventure: are you ready to feel this revenge?========== ================== -Hi, Gee. I turned around and saw a smiling Frank. -What are you doing here? -Walk. -At ten at night? -Yes. -Frankie... -Okay! he rolled his eyes and smiled even wider. – I came for you, because today we have an important mission! I slammed the hood of his car, wiped his hands on a rag and looked back at Frank in front of him. A dead bulb under the ceiling lights a little, but I still was able to notice that since we last met, he began to look paler and weaker. I was already agree on everything. -What are you thinking? -I heard those cool goats poured the first year urine? he asked. -And... yeah. -I also heard that the house in Brittany, the dumb brunette, the party is today. -Frankie... – I moaned. -I haven't said anything yet! – protested Frankie. But Yes, you right, – he smiled, – we will sneak into this party, we find Curtis and his cronies that did it and a few bucks for them to drink a laxative to these freaks remember forever, where you need to go to the toilet! I did not smile, because, seriously, it was genius. -How do we get there? We were not invited. -Yes, they are all a long time ago in shit, they won't even notice – dismissed Frank. -Again you drag me into some shit, ' I said. - «Yes», bluntly replied he. I had to refuse. To go home and go to bed, because tomorrow have to be up early, but after ten minutes I found myself in his car, speeding through the formal living streets. I looked at him. He looked tired and haggard. And beautiful. Not just a man with a beautiful face, just beautiful. Beautiful completely beautiful in every way, beautiful inside and out, absolutely beautiful in everything: face, smile, breath, thoughts, eyes, feelings, actions, voice, torn jeans, his universe. I could be with him forever. The look in his hazel eyes, to touch his hand and inhale his scent – the smell of fruity shampoo, mint gum and may. I wish I could just be with him. -We came, – suddenly said Frank. I shuddered at his voice, shook his head and looked out the window. We were standing in the driveway of a house, from which came the sound of tearing the ears of music and loud voices. -«Yeah,» I replied. - All right? – he asked worried. -Yes. Yes, he did. We got out of the car. I didn't know what to do next, but Frank took me by the hand and confidently headed for the porch. The door was not locked and we entered. Inside it was stuffy, crowded, and stank of sweat and beer. People jostled each other and laughed loudly, on the couch, I noticed the passionate couple in the room, someone puked in a vase, and at one point it seemed to me that among this crowd I lost Frank, but my fingers immediately clutched a hand, and I breathed a sigh of relief. We pushed our way between the sweaty bodies until he reached the kitchen and found it Curtis. He was so drunk that I'm surprised he's still on his feet. Frank let go of my hand, leaving me to wait in the doorway, approached Curtis from behind and threw in his Cup, which he was holding in hands two laxative pills. Curtis not only protested, he did not notice that someone is, and I again marveled at the stupidity of this moron. Frank deftly snuck back to me, and, again holding hands, we went back into the living room to find the others. It really was fun. Throw the remaining tablets was easy, because these guys was really drunk and wasn't thinking straight. Especially funny happened with Tom Robbins, because he believed that Frankie gives him the drugs, voluntarily put two laxative pills in his mouth. Taking from a table a bowl of chips, we got back on the street, and I took a deep breath, feeling fresh air, beer instead of sweaty stink. I smiled when I heard next to me giggling quietly to Frankie. -He took it for the drugs, – he gasped, – what a dumbass. We laughed softly in the cool night air. I felt calm and good. It seemed to me that now the whole universe came to a standstill to give me this moment alone with Frank Iero, I thought that the whole world is only we two and nothing more. And then we sat in the car listening to the radio and eating stolen chips. Frank shook his head to the beat of some song, and I looked out the window and felt him close. -When do you leave? – I asked. -At the end of the month, he said. -Okay, - I said. Of course, he didn't say goodbye, quickly fleeing into the darkness as soon as he dropped me off at the house, and again I looked after him, falling into despair just the thought that as soon as will end this may, I never will not see it. =============== adventure seven: at the sunset of this world the last thing I'll see will be you ================= The clock was eleven, when my window is tapped. Our last adventure. -«Hi», - panted Frank, as he climbed up to my room and holding something in his hands. -«Hi», -I replied, taking away his big paper bag, so it was easier to climb. -Phew, – he gasped, when firmly stood on his feet. -What do you think for today? I asked, eyeing the envelope. – We will go somewhere? \"No,\" answered Frank, taking from me an envelope and walking into the middle of the room, you have player? -And...yeah. -Great. He took off his shoes, leaving them under my Desk, then walked over to the bed and dumped all of the contents of the envelope on it. It turned out to be the discs. A bunch of regular CD's in thin paper packages without signatures. -Today we are going to listen to the music, he said, choosing a single disc in a pale blue packaging – put. -Really? Just listen to the music? -Yes. Put. I did as he said. Once I finished messing around with the player, Frank immediately turned off the light and climbed into my bed. -«Come here», he whispered. The speakers began to play A Great Big World – Say Something. I walked over to the bed and sat gingerly next to him. We lay side by side, not touching each other, and looked into the darkness in front of him. And it was so weird and so wonderful just to listen to music, lying beside him in the dark, while the world is left somewhere outside. I felt it with every inch of his body, heard his breathing through the quiet music in the dark. I felt its warmth, our fingers almost touch, and my heart was beating so fast and I could barely control my breathing only because he was so close. I frantically gasped and felt my palms sweating. He was too beautiful, too beautiful, too close, he was just too in order that I might not go crazy. I turned to the side, placing his hands behind his head and looked at him. His eyes were opened, he was staring blankly into the void, and in the dark I could see that he looks too serious. -Do you have to go? quietly I asked. He sighed, also turning onto his side to face me. -Yes, – he said quietly. -You can't stay? He touched his fingers to my cheek, gently stroking it and I leaned towards the touch, because I wanted to. -I would like, – he whispered, – but I can't. I put my hand on his waist, pulling closer to him, and he quietly gasped when our faces got very close. I needed to feel him as close as possible, to get enough of its heat before it would run away and leave me alone. -You smell of coffee, – he said. «You may smell like» – I thought. ======================================= Where are you? ========================================== The next morning I woke up to a horrible alarm bells. Reaching to the nightstand and turning off the monster, I suddenly realized I was alone. Frankie was not. I quickly turned back, under the table, missing shoes. It was not anywhere. The only thing left of him is a pile of discs on the floor and the smell of his hair on my pillow. I groaned, again pulling on the bed, and covering head with blanket. He always left without saying goodbye. The door to my room opened, and seemed on the verge of the mother, cheerful and happy. -Good morning! happily she sang, parting the curtain. – Come on, time to get up. -What is the fun? – I reluctantly muttered. -Remember that awful tedious business in which we engaged a few months? We finally finished it. Now I have two weeks of vacation. -Congratulations. -Get up, breakfast is on the table, she patted me on the cheek and left, leaving the door open, and I, unhappy, but smiling, got out of bed. On the way to school I thought about what happened last night. Now I knew for sure – I won't let him leave. I will fall at his feet, locked up in his room, drop everything and go after him, but I will not let him go. Because it is the only thing that made me feel alive. Because Frank Iero was the most incredible person ever, and I just couldn't just let him go. I didn't know why he left. But it's Frank. He could leave because he was waiting for a parent or because he so suddenly wanted. But I was sure that he will come back. Because he liked it, too. I heard that, I felt it. Maybe he needed time to think? Maybe he'll decide not to leave me? It could be anything. I knew that soon he will come again to me. You won't believe! I ran towards the happy whale Skeet, waving his arms and swearing loudly, and I even could not imagine what had happened. -You won't believe, -said Skeet, gasping,' it - appened! -What? I asked, smiling. We sat down on a free bench in the school yard. It was still early, the people only tightened, and the bright sun was shining straight into my eyes. -Recently Brittany had a party, there were all the cool guys and know what happened – almost going to squeak babbled Skeet, CURTIS FORSTER REACHED THE TOILET AND PUT HIS PANTS IN FRONT OF EVERYONE! He and Keith could not stand and loudly neighing, I'm in shock staring at the two of them. -Are you serious? – I asked. – Oh my God! We laughed clutching my stomach, and I just couldn't believe that it's true. Here it is. Retribution. -Say that to him, someone slipped a laxative – squeezed Keith. -Mmm, he said in response to me, again bursting into laughter. The yard slowly filled with students. The three of us collapsed on the bench and silently basked under the warm sun, and everyone thought that it's the day. When the evil got what he deserved. It was so weird because we never believed that this day actually ever comes. But Frank came in and everyone in the world suddenly became possible. It was one of the most fun school days over the past few years. We spent the whole day laughing and having fun, even the lessons and upcoming exams for the first time was not a burden. We started talking out loud, not shy and not afraid, especially the first years it was fun and the guys from the orchestra, over which Curtis abused the most. It was one of those rare days in which I'm really gonna miss when permanently out of school. I was hoping that when I get back from school I find a note from him or something like that. But there was nothing. The same empty room, which I left in the morning, and nothing happened. ======================================== say something ======================================= It's been more than a week, and he still did not appear. I honestly tried not to think about the fact that he could leave and not say goodbye, but just the thought that I will never see again, threw in a cold sweat. I didn't believe he could do this to me, but nevertheless, at eight in the morning on Friday instead of being in school, I went to the house of Frank, and my heart was pounding. I opened the door very thin and pale woman. Her eyes were reddened, and in her hands she clutched a white handkerchief. -Mrs. Iero? – excited, I asked. -«Yes,» she replied gently, smiling warmly. -I... I'm a friend of Frank. -«Oh, » again she kindly smiled on me – you came to Express their condolences? -W-what? For a moment she seemed surprised, but then her features softened, as if she remembered something, and Mrs. Iero smiled again, sad and motherly and with a drop of sympathy. -You must be Gerard, - she said softly. -«Yes,» - I replied, refusing to accept what was right in front of me. Frankie said you can go. He said to go up to his room, there is a letter for you. -Where? – I swallowed loudly. -Second floor, third door. I rushed past her into the hallway, up the stairs, my shoes, without asking permission, but she didn't even called me. Taking a deep breath, I walked into his room, closing the door behind him, and immediately the noise of the houses and streets gave way to a soft silence, filled with the smell of mint gum, fruit shampoo and may. On a small writing table was a white envelope. With trembling hands I took the letter, and my gaze fell to his uneven handwriting. It was worse than the pain. The world has collapsed. Leukemia. Light squeezed the hot air. He died. Clenched in the hands of the letter, I ran out of the room, knocking something on the way, flew past Mrs. Iero, get out of this house into the fresh air, to breathe, I needed to breathe. He died. I ran without feeling. I stumbled, fell, scratched, climbed and ran again. I didn't believe. It's not true. I ran to an empty house, throwing his bag into the wall and dropping the chairs. I had to do something. I had to do something with myself. I went crazy, I cried and cried because I couldn't do anything, I wanted to go somewhere, to do something, only to find it, just look at him, just touch him, just at least know that somewhere in this world is Frank Iero. I broke plates, vase, broke off the pillow, I screamed and begged, and he did not appear. I was crying and scratching at the wall, and he still didn't come to me, I haven't seen it, I felt it, I didn't know where he is, I couldn't find it. I had, I had to find it, I wanted to do something, but I just cried and cried, clutching my stomach from the burning pain inside because I didn't believe it and felt it. I punched the floor, but the fucking world does not return it to me. I tore and broke, all that was me, but I was still alone. He could not, I thought. He's not dead, I thought. But it was not. ========================================= Sunday================================================ I was hiding under a blanket. Came mom to ask if I was okay. I said all right and asked her to leave. ========================================= Monday ============================================== I had to go to school because it was the first day of exams. When I returned home, I again went to bed and stayed there until the next morning. ======================================= == Tuesday ============================================== I lied that I have a stomach ache and did not go to school. All day I lay alone and remembered what it was now so clear. « Suddenly I die tomorrow, and not going to the zoo? » « I'm just leaving » « Far and forever » « I just wanted to do something before you leave » « Can't you stay? -I would, but I can't. » ==================================== ==== Wednesday ============================================ I passed the English exam. Mom said that I can no longer refuse to eat. I had to eat. ======================================== Thursday ============================================= Called Keith and Skittles. I didn't pick up. ========================================= Friday =============================================== Mikey brought me a new comic book. He said they were all worried about me. I said that all is well ==================================== Never again =============================================== Keith and Skittles came to my house. -Gerard. -Yes? -Is everything all right? -Of course. I had to get out of bed, take a shower and wear a tuxedo. It was prom night. I received my diploma. The people around were bright and happy. Tina DeMour came with Curtis and didn't even look at me. I knew from the beginning that it will. I thought that this day will be the happiest in my life. I thought that I would be eternally happy with his friends, but instead, the most important day of his entire teenage life I was slowly died, sitting on the dirty ground of the city cemetery next to his grave. I was supposed to be the normal teenager, with normal problems, I was to have suffer because of girls and eat pizza with friends, but he came, and everything just went to hell. You can't do that, not cool to change a person's entire life, and then to leave it forever, leaving him alone. He was so close and so far away at the same time. Just three metres below me, but I couldn't touch it. He lay there, dead and motionless, and I was crying on a marble slab, and he could not comfort me. Couldn't call me by my name. Could not smile, could not again me something to interfere, couldn't hug my shoulders. Never again. ======================================= thirty-first======================================== - Gerard? - Yes, fathers? - I can enter? - Of course. He quietly passed to my room and sat down on edge of a bed, and I lay under a blanket and waited that he will tell. - Gerard, – he began, – we know that something happened. I won't ask you about anything. I just want to ask something. - What? - Don't turn away from us. I heaved a deep sigh. - You don't understand. - Don't think so, – he told. – We with mother lived enough to understand. - It is hurt. - We understand it too. I was silent. - What there was, you can't carry out eternity under a blanket. - It is a pity. - We will always support you. Without having waited for my answer, he got up and left, closing behind himself a door, and I pulled out the head from under a blanket and stared in a wall before myself. It was right. I couldn't lie eternity here, I couldn't turn away from a family, but just sometimes it seemed to me that my heart it was necessary to lie there, on Frank's grave, and all I wanted, to climb under a bed and to cry as the small child. It was the last day of May. ========== the future never dies ========== There came June. I still wasn't as it should be, but after all could get out from under a blanket. I very much missed it. I went to Mrs. Iero. I apologized to it for that time when I so quickly ran away from her house. She told that she isn't angry with me at all, and then suggested me to remain on tea. We long talked to her about Frank. I told it about all our adventures, having decided that now she will hardly become angry, and she smiled and smiled through tears. She is a good woman. I was in Frank's room. Mrs. Iero allowed me to rise there and told that I can be there so much how many for me it is necessary. I took myself his black t-shirt with the capital white letter \"S\", one photo where he in this t-shirt sits on a floor with a guitar, having crossed legs, and happily smiles, and then long lay on a bed and inhaled its smell. Days went one by one. After final I still few times saw Keith and Skittles. We went to a pizzeria, at first they tried to find out what is with me, but I only waved away and further chewed the pizza. Eventually, they chucked in this business, and any more never asked me about anything, stirred about the things, and I always sat next, listened to them and felt a little better. I told all to parents. I thought, they have the right to know. Because I am their child. I saw how it was painful to Mrs. Iero when she was left without Frank. I didn't want that mine mother and the father were left without me. And therefore I told them about everything. About all our adventures of a trick, how I fell in love with him and as I lost him. They listened to me, without interrupting, only occasionally nodding. When I finished, they didn't begin to abuse me for the fact that in two weeks I broke the law more, than for all the life. They didn't tell anything on the fact that I fell in love with the boy. They strong embraced me and told that everything obligatory will be good. I believed them. So there passed my summer. I something was engaged, prepared for college, read comics from the Undershirt, got out in a pizzeria with guys, listened to Frank's disks, drew the whole nights, sitting in his t-shirt, and just tried to be as it should be. I many times re-read his letter, trying to find there something new that I didn't notice earlier, but words remained just words. But I continued to read because when I held it in hand, it was near me again. I saw his lovely smile between lines and heard his silent laughter behind the shoulder. I already reconciled to the fact that it doesn't exist any more, but sometimes when I walked on warm evening streets, it seemed to me that now it will appear because of turn and will tell that it was only the joke and now we can always be together. But nothing occurred, and I went further, representing that once on this road also it in the same way went, and from these thoughts I smiled. I many times wanted to return back, to live once again those moments of May, but June was replaced July, July August, and I still was here. And there passed my summer. Now the thirty first of August and in seven hours there will come the fall. I rush in the car on roads of the State of New Jersey and the last summer sun sees off me to New York. I spat to Pennsylvania and was admitted to school of visual arts because I wanted it. I still not as it should be, but at me something am. I have the whole world and millions of chances to be happy every day. And I move further. My bags with things shiver on a back seat because the luggage carrier is filled with jars with fruit shampoo. In the player one of its disks turns, and nearby on passenger sitting its photo and the letter lies. And I… And I move further. « Dear Gerard, I'm sorry to tell you this, but I couldn't bear your pity, so I have no other choice. I have a leukemia. And I dying. I am so sorry. It is very strange that to me only seventeen and I already raw up a will. Though I have not so many things which I could give and also not so many people who would need it. If to think, this is only my mother and you. I left her my guitar and a lot of things, although it is a bit silly, it would and it so stay with her. And you I bequeath my collection of disks, a Scorpions t-shirt and the whole world. I spent for you two last weeks of the life. Make so that it wasn't vain. Please, be happy. I always am near somewhere.

I went to a party last night, I had a great time. I was with Orlando, we went to the party together. I didn't know many people there, as for it was his party, not mine. When I first got there, I was polite and acting how I should have. But then he started to noticed that I felt out of place, and that I wasn't comfortable. So he came up to me from behind, startling me. Gently he felt around my side and asked \"so do you wanna go? I have an idea of what we can do\". I should have known he would have flirted with me, but I wasn't too sure if I was ready. But he seduced me into following him. I knew I shouldn't have gone, but he knew exactly what to do. We went out the back door and into the garden, then I looked up to the sky and counted the stars. He looked back at me and smiled. I looked back at him and grabbed him, I kissed him passionately. He picked me up and brought me into a maze, it was night but wasn't cold. I looked at him awkwardly when we sat down on the cool soft grass, he knew who I felt so he told me that I won't regret it. I had few words to say, so I simply played with my hair and looked down and the grass. He slowly crawled over top of me, then took off his shirt. He reached for my hands, and then I slowly removed the tube top I was wearing. He smiled at me, and said quietly \"your so beautiful, I love you\". I couldn't deny the feeling I had lying underneath him shirtless, but then I thought. I only have known him for a couple weeks. But before I hesitated to even think of leaving, he kissed me. I slowly sat up, and we shifted to the other side of the maze wall. So that I was on top. He seductively removed his pants, and I removed my skirt. He held me close to his warm body, I felt around him as he did the same to me. We slowly started to get into a nice technique that was great for the both of us. But before we knew it, his phone rang. He didn't answer it, he stayed with me. A couple minutes later, I noticed someone holding there phone up. They were video taping us! So I quickly got off of Orlando and reached for my shirt, Orlando sat up and yelled to this person \"what in the bloody hell are you doing?\" i was deathly afraid, Orlando got his pants on and stormed over to this person. It was one of his friends from the party, Orlando was furious. While he tried to deal with things, I though of the negative things that could happen. I started crying quietly, Orlando told his friend to leave, and never show anyone that tape. Then he quickly ran over to me, he gave me a hug and told me that I had nothing to fear. I left him and the party. I went home and just went to bed thinking of all the things I can do. I didn't talk to Orlando for a couple days, but then my phone rang one afternoon. I answered knowing it was him, but instead it was some stranger. This stranger said \"damn, that tape with you and Orlando is hot!\" I didn't want to waste time of the phone with this guy. So I hung up, and called Orlando and said \"your friend! He released the tape\" Orlando stuttered and said \"what? how do you know?\" Then I told him about the call I got, we decided he would come to my house tonight. When he got over, I greeted him with a kiss. I led him to my room, he looked around as I grabbed my laptop. We decided that we wanted to see the tape, and see how bad this is. So we lied in bed together, and I searched up the tape. What we found was worse than we thought, it had everything you could see. I put away my laptop, then crawled back into bed with him. He looked at me, and played with my hair. He said \"we've been done this path before\" I looked at him and giggled \"well for starters we aren't in a maze, and there isn't any cameras\". I slowly sat up and he said \"thats gonna make it more enjoyable\" I let him removed my cashmere shirt, as I slowly reached down for his pants. It wasn't the same as last time, it felt right, and real. We spent the night together, but when I woke up he was gone. He left a note saying \"don't worry baby, I didn't leave you, I'm downstairs, come look for me\" I took the note and slid it into my pocket. Then I dashed downstairs, but Orlando wasn't there, it was someone else. And that guy was Justin, Justin Bieber. I was frightened and then I remembered, he looked a lot like the guy who video taped me and Orlando. I asked him where Orlando was, he told me \"you won't be needed him, I'm here now\" I replied independently \"I'm flattered, but I'm not taking a chance on you\". He giggled and pulled me towards him, he said \"you know, if we play, then there will be a chance I'll take the video down\". I didn't say anything, but he wasn't gonna give up. He started touching me, and whispered in my ear \"so... You up for it?\" I thought he would actually take the video down, so I grabbed him and started kissing him. He told me \"ha, nice try, talk dirty to me\" so instead I said \"what about this?\" And I got down on my knees, he said \"I guess this will do\". After that, he said \"you've done good, so it's your choice, do you wanna keep on going, or should are you gonna kick me out?\" I shouldn't have, I really shouldn't have. But I said \"hmmm, how bout we do it my way?\" I led him upstairs to my shower, I turned on the shower and only grabbed one towel. I told him we won't be needing more, he looked at me. And slowly got undressed, I looked back at him, and his body. He walked up to me, and started feeling my clothes. He said \"cashmere? Don't wanna get that wet, why don't we take it off?\" I giggled and said \"go ahead\" he went behind me and undid the buttons. I watched my shirt drop on the ground, then turned around at him. We got in the shower, and felt the warm water. I heard a door open, but I couldn't move an inch away from Justin's body. I closed my eyes and enjoyed the moment, but then I heard a bag dropped. Keeping my eyes closed i tried to ask Justin what that was, but it was hard with all the movement going on. He told me \"dont worry, my pants fell\", what was really going on? Well Orlando walked in the bathroom, then just for bragging, Justin started doing more and faster. Orlando was mad, he didn't even know what to do, so he just stood there, waiting for me to open my eyes. When I did, I quickly moved away from Justin, I tried not to cry finally realizing what I let Justin do. I yelled at Justin, and told him to leave. Then dashed over to Orlando, I told him that is as sorry and didn't realize what Justin did to me. Orlando looked at me and said \"yah, I'm sorry too.\" He left me, I was heartbroken. But I quickly found someone new, we didn't have to worry about any celebrity drama like that. But the only thing was, I loved him, but not like I loved Orlando. So one afternoon, we went out for dinner. I was dressed in a fitted cream coloured dress. After we ordered, I saw Orlando walk in, but he had a new girl. So I tried to ignore him, but I remembered everything. Parties, sex, goofing around, I remembered why I loved him. I told my current boyfriend, I had to go to the washroom. And I slowly walked over to the bathroom, so that Orlando would notice. He stood up and followed me. I was looking in the mirror, as he came around the corner and started kissing my neck. I didn't turn around, I waited for him to say some thing. So finally he looked at me in the mirror and said \"so do you still want this? Or should I leave?\" I turned around and pushed him against the wall, I said \"what does it look like?\". He slowly pulled down my dress, as I said \"I'm sorry, I was doing it for us\". He pressed him finger against my lips, and started kissing me. Then he got undressed and picked me up. He said to me \"wanna re-creat the scene you made with Justin, but this time we can do it our way\" luckily we found a way out without anyone noticing. When we got home, I turned on the shower and said \"you ready for a ride\" then seductively he said back \"just wait until you see what I have instore for you\".

Setelah 3 tahun mereka tidak bertemu, Sehun mengajak mereka ber-reuni menelusuri hutan yang sangat lebat dan jarang di kunjungi orang-orang awam, Kris menulis pesan di grup suatu media sosial untuk menyuruh mereka bergegas. Sampai akhirnya Kris dan ke enam kawannya sedang menunggu Suho. Tak lama Suho pun datang. Mereka menumpang mobil pick up untuk melakukan perjalanan menuju ke hutan, mereka mengisi kegiatan mereka selama perjalanan dengan bercanda, bertengkar kecil ada yang tertidur juga. Pukul 15.30 mereka sampai di tepi hutan itu. \"Terima ka-ini konyol\" belum sempat Lay melanjutkan ungkapan terima kasih kepada sang supir ia di kejutkan dengan posisi supir yang tertidur saat berkendara \"DIA TERTIDUR! MANA MUNGKIN DIA YANG MENJALANKAN MOBIL INI SEDARI TADI\" pekik Sehun ketakutan \"Mungkin saja dia memakai mode otomatis, jadi mobilnya jalan sendiri\" ujar Suho berpikir positif \"Suho, mode seperti itu mungkin bisa di dapat pada mobil-mobil mewah\" \"Lagi pula mode itu untuk mobil yang berjalan di jalanan datar, dan kau tau? Kita melewati banyak jalan dengan tikungan curam yang di pinggirnya adalah jurang, kau tau itu!?\" kali ini Kris frustasi. Tiba-tiba mobil itu menyala dan berjalan meninggalkan mereka yang masih menatap heran satu sama lain. \"Kurasa dia supir gila\" gumam Chen \"Sebaiknya kita pergi menelusuri hutan surga ini, tempat ini Indah sekali!\" pekik Chen girang yang di ikuti oleh, Tao, Lay dan Suho tapi Kris, Sehun dan Luhan masih memikirkan kejadian tadi. Satu jam berlalu. Dengan riang mereka bernyanyi menelusuri hutan indah itu, walaupun matahari hampir terbenam, tak membuat semangat mereka sirna. Sehun, Kris dan Luhan pun sudah melupakan insiden mobil gila itu. Akhirnya langit mulai gelap. \"Aku penguasa hutan! Aku raja rimba\" Racau Kris tak jelas \"aku raja yang berhati sutra\" lanjutnya lagi \"Diamlah Kris, atau aku akan murka\" desis Lay Suasana hening sejak itu. Mereka menemukan sebuah rumah tua cantik yang terbuat kayu. \"Kita tinggal di sana saja selama malam ini, besok kita pulang\" usul Suho. Mereka pun memasuki rumah yang terkunci itu. \"Sekarang beri tahu aku bagaimana cara membuka pintu ini\", tanya Kris pada lainnya \"Kau selalu berkomentar kris, lihat aku menemukan kuncinya tergantung di tembok itu\" jelas Chen sementara Kris hanya cengengesan. Mereka memasuki rumah itu dengan sangat hati-hati, tak di temukan sesuatu yang mencurigakan, jadi mereka memutuskan untuk tinggal di rumah dengan dua kamar itu. Kris sebagai sang Tetua membagi kamar untuk anak lainnya \"YAK! Kenapa harus aku yang sekamar dengan Tao\" protes Chen yang membuat ke enam anak lainnya terkejut dan langsung menjitak kepala Chen masal \"Kau ini! Kamar di sini itu terbatas. kita juga sekamar dengan Suho. Aku tidak akan mengompol kali ini\" ucap Tao yang mendapat tatapan horor dari yang lain selain chen \"Sudah sebesar ini masih mengopol ckckc\" Luhan berdecak heran. Mereka melanjutkan aktifitas mereka seperti makan,bercanda dan tidur. Tapi di tengah tidurnya Tao terbangun dan hendak ke kamar mandi, karena tidak berani sendiri dia pun membangunkan Suho si boncel pemberani. \"Suho...Suho temani aku\" Tao menggucang tubuh suho, sementara suho hanya menggeliat lalu tertidur \"Hhhh dasar kebo\" cibir Tao kesal dan memberanikan diri untuk pergi ke kamar mandi sendiri. Tao kebingungan dimana letak kamar mandi itu, sampai akhirnya wajah pucatnya kembali sumringah setelah menemukan kamar mandi. Dari kamar mandi ia mendengar suara derap kaki. jantungnya berdetak semakin kencang. Ingin ia keluar tapi pikiranya membayangkan hal-hal horor 'Bagaimana kalau ada hantu di depan pintu ini sekarang' ia memilih untuk mengurung diri di kamar mandi luas itu. Tok tok tok Pintu kamar mandi itu terketuk dari luar. Tao sangat ketakutan. Pikirannya berkecamuk. Pintu itu terketuk lagi. Ingin ia menangis. Pintu itu terketuk dengan sedikit keras. Akhirnya tangisnya pecah \"Hei ini aku, Kris\" ucap Kris dan membuat Tao diam seketika, dengan dramatis ia menyeka air matanya. Tak lama ia keluar dari kamar mandi dengan tampang cengengesan, Kris yang jengkel akan tingkah Tao hanya menjitak kepalanya dan menyuruhnya kembali untuk tidur. Tapi tak lama ia memanggil Tao kembali. \"Tao, kau mau kemana? Tunggulah sebentar di sini. Bagaimana kalau ada kecoa?\" \"Sedari tadi tidak kutemukan tanda-tanda kehidupan kecoa di sana\" ucap Tao setengah ngantuk \"Tunggulah sebentar, aku khawatir kalau kecoa itu membawa pasukannya untuk menyerangku karena.. kemarin aku membunuh kecoa\" penjelasan Kris membuat Tao menganga. \"Kau yang benar saja! Bilang saja kau takut\" ucap Tao dengan senyum jahat \"Kenapa aku harus takut? Dasar kau\" Kris ngeles \"Kris\" panggil Tao \"Hmm\" \"Aku mulai merasakan aura aneh semenjak kita ke hutan ini, dan...rumah ini\" \"Omong kosong\" \"Apa kau merasa ada sesuatu di belakangmu? Dia mulai mengintaimu. Perlahan-lahan dia menghampirimu dan kau bisa merasakan auranya di tengku lehermu\" \"Hei kau pikir ini lucu. Hentikan Tao atau aku akan marah\" \"Dia semakin mendekat dan mematikan lampunya\" KLEK \"SIAL KAU SUDAH KU BILANG INI TAK LUCU\" pekik Kris \"Tak lama lampunya hidup kembali\" ucap Tao dengan suara gemetar \"Tao jangan main-main denganku! Akan ku bunuh kau setelah ini\" ancam Kris \"Kris, sesungguh aku tidak melakukan apapun, aku tidak bermain lampu. Aku merasakan ada sesuatu di belakangku. Tapi, aku tak berani melihatnnya Kris\" Tangisnya pecah ketika semua omonganya kembali kepadanya BRAK! Kris membuka pintu kamar mandi dengan sangat kasar. Wajahnya sangat ketakutan, bahkan ia belum sempat membenahi celananya. Ternyata dia juga menangis. Tapi ia belum sepenuhnya sadar akan sesuatu di belakang Tao. Tao memberanikan diri untuk melihat kebelakang dan... \"AAAAAAAAAAAAAAA\" jerit Kris dan Tao histeris \"YAK! KALIAN INI KENAPA! BERISIK SEKALI!\" pekik mahluk itu \"SI-SI- SIAPA KAU\" ucap Kris dan Tao ketakutan \"Kalian sangat lama di kamar mandi. Kau pikir ini kamar mandimu hah? Di rumah ini hanya ada satu kamar mandi\" celoteh Luhan dan berlalu memasuki kamar mandi tanpa merasa bersalah \"Kenapa kau harus memakai topeng seperti itu!\" pekik Tao \"Maksudmu masker wajah?\" tanya Kris yang tak di gubris Tao . Keesokan harinya Mereka bersiap-siap hendak kembali ke kota. Karena tak ada transportasi mereka harus berjalan jauh dari hutan itu hingga ke perbatasan jalan. Mereka memilih perjalanan pagi-pagi sekaligus menikmati sejuknya hutan ini. Tapi mereka melupakan satu hal \"Kenapa banyak sekali kabut di sini\" tanya Lay \"Santai saja bro. Ini daerah puncak wajar saja banyak kabut disini\" ujar Suho sambil menari-nari \"Aneh sekali, tak biasanya dia menjadi setenang ini. bukankah dia orang yang mudah frustasi?\" tanya Chen pada Sehun dan Sehun hanya mengamini pertanyaan Chen 5 jam sudah mereka berjalan. Tapi tak di temukan tanda-tanda jalan raya. Malah mereka hanya kembali ke rumah itu setelah 2 kali keliling hutan \"SIAL! KENAPA KITA KEMBALI KE RUMAH INI!\" kali ini Luhan benar-benar kesal \"Ini konyol. Sudah dua kali kita berjalan menelusuri hutan ini. Tapi kita kembali ke rumah ini\" \"Kurasa ada baiknya kita bermalam di sini lagi\" usul Suho. Karena sudah kelelahan mereka pun kembali ke rumah itu. kini rasa takut menyelimuti benak mereka akan keganjalan tentang hutan ini. \"Sebenarnya hutan apa ini? Kenapa tidak di temukan jalan keluar disini?\" tanya Lay pada lainnya \"Sehun, bisa kau jelaskan hal tentang hutan ini?\" tanya Chen pada Sehun \"Aku tidak tau, yang aku lihat dari internet hutan ini sangat indah. Jadi aku berniat mengajak kalian berpetualang di sini\" jelas Sehun \"Sehun, kau benar-benar gila. Di mana sejarahnya kau melihat orang mengadakan reuni di hutan seperti ini?\" Tao mulai kesal \"Aku tidak suka sesuatu yang biasa. Itu sebabnya aku membuat hal baru\"jelas Sehun dengan wajah polosnya \"Seharusnya kau mencari hutan yang umum!\" Tao sedikit membentak \"Lalu kau pikir ini hutan mahluk halus?\" tanya Sehun membuat suasana saat itu menjadi hening seketika. \"Santai bung. Tidak akan ada hantu di siang hari\" lanjutnya lagi. Tao yang sudah sangat kesal berusaha mencekik Sehun, tetapi ia di cegah oleh Kris dan Luhan. Sejak itu suasana kembali hening \"Stok makanan kita semakin menipis. Kita harus berhemat\" ujar Luhan \"Ini hutan, kau bisa menemukan makanan di mana-mana\" ucap Suho santai \"Maksudmu?\" \"Kita bisa berburu di sini\" lanjut Suho \"Bukannya kau vegetarian?\" tanya Kris \"Aku tidak tahan harus memakan sayuran terus\" lanjutnya . Jam menunjukan pukul 21.45. sebagian dari mereka memilih tidur. Sebagian lagi memilih bermain game di ponsel. Sampai baterai ponsel mereka habis. Kris meminjam ponsel Chen. \"Sekarang kau puas?\" tanya Chen pada Kris \"Apa?\" \"KAU MENGHABISKAN BATERAI PONSELKU!\" amuk Chen pada Kris. Sementara Kris hanya memasang wajah tanpa dosa. Hening. 5 menit 10 menit 20 menit \"Apa kau merasa hal yang ganjal?\" tanya Tao pada Luhan \"Sejak awal kita ke sini aku sudah merasakan hal yang ganjal. Semenjak insiden mobil gila itu\" jelas Luhan \"Bukan itu! tentang rumah ini\" \"Ya, rumah ini memang sedikit horor\" jawab Luhan \"Kau ini bodoh sekali. Apa kau tidak merasa aneh, rumah ini di tengah hutan belantara. Bagaimana bisa ada lampu, kulkas dan perabotan lainnya yang menyala di rumah ini? Dari mana juga ada air? Padahal aku tidak melihat danau atau sungai.\" ujar Tao \"Lalu apa masalahnya?\" tanya Kris masih belum mengerti \"Bagaimana bisa ada listrik di tengah hutan?\" pembicaraan malam ini di akhiri dengan pertanyaan Tao. Mereka benar-benar kalap dan akhirnya memilih untuk pergi tidur, walaupun mereka tidak sepenuhnya tidur. Hari ke dua. Mereka bergegas untuk pulang. insting mereka mengatakan bahwa mereka akan celaka bila terus di hutan ini. Masih sama seperti kemarin, mereka berusaha untuk keluar dari hutan ini, tapi hasilnya nihil. setiap hutan yang mereka telusuri berujung pada rumah yang mereka tempati sebelumnya. Mereka tak menyerah. Mereka mencari jalan keluar untuk kesekian kalinya. \"Sial! Mau sampai kapan kita berkeliling hutan gila ini!\" frustasi Luhan \"Aku sudah lelah, kita istirahat sebentar\" kata Sehun sambil mengatur nafasnya \"Kenapa Jalan itu mendadak hilang?\" tanya Kris masih heran dengan kondisi hutan yang berbeda 180 derajat dari sebelumnya. \"Kurasa kita terjebak dalalm ilusi time\" ujar Tao \"Sadar bung, ini bukan negri dongeng. Jangan terlalu menghayal\" ledek Chen. Setalah lama berkeliling, akhirnya mereka baru sadar akan sesuatu yang aneh. \"Kau merasa aneh?\" kata Tao yang paling kuat instingnya. Tiba-tiba Sehun bersuara \"DIMANA LAY!?\" tanyanya mulai panik. Akhirnya mereka semua mulai mencari Lay. Mereka sangat khawatir dengan kawannya yang satu ini. Lay bukan seperti beberapa temannya yang mudah frustasi dan panik. Dia tenang meskipun dalam masalah, ia tidak akan mengatakan apapun. Justru hal ini yang membuat mereka khawatir. \"LAY!\" \"LAY! KAU DIMANA!?\" jerit mereka memanggil Lay. Mereka mencari Lay. Tapi saat mereka menelusuri hutan untuk mencari lay, Luhan menemukan jalan di tepi hutan itu. \"Aku melihat jalannya!\" jerit Luhan antusias. Merekapun akhirnya delima setelah sekian lama mereka ingin keluar dari hutan ini, tapi mereka terikat oleh situasi yang memaksa mereka untuk tetap di hutan ini sementara waktu. Sehun menyobek lengan bajunya untuk di jadikan jejak saat mereka mencari jalan itu nanti. akhirnya mereka memutuskan untuk tetap mencari Lay. Tak selang lama terdengar suara jeritan yang menggema di hutan itu. jeritan yang sangat memilukan. \"Sepertinya, itu Lay\" ucap Tao bergegas lari menuju asal suara jeritan itu yang terdengar berkali-kali, sampai akhirnya jeritan itu menghilang dan tak terdengar lagi. \"Apa dia disiksa? Kenapa dia menjerit seperti itu?\" tanya Kris yang sudah hampir menangis \"Aku tidak tau, semoga tak terjadi apapun pada Lay\" ucap Luhan yang sudah menangis SREEEK! Terdengar suara sesuatu yang jatuh menimpa ranting-ranting pohon itu. mereka hanya menatap orang itu dengan tatapan yang tak bisa diartikan. \"Teganya! Kalian meninggalkanku!\" amuk orang itu yang tak lain adalah Suho \"Kau tersesat? Maafkan kami tak menyadarimu tersesat tadi. Lay menghilang\" jelas Chen \"Apa maksudmu? Lay di culik?\" \"Aku tidak tau, apa kau tidak mendengar suara jeritan? Kita harus cepat sebelum terjadi hal lain pada Lay\" mereka terkejut saat mereka menemui rumah itu lagi. Tapi bukan itu yang membuat mereka terkejut, melainkan bekas darah yang mengelilingi halaman rumah itu. dengan sigap mereka berpencar di sekitar halaman rumah itu untuk mencari Lay. Akhirnya aktifitas mereka terhenti karena jeritan Tao. Merekapun mengampiri Tao, tapi reaksi mereka tak jauh beda dari Tao. \"Lay\" gumam Suho lirih, tubuhnya melemas melihat kondisi Lay. Sementara yang lainnya masih mematung tak percaya \"LAY!\" jerit Kris, Chen dan Luhan bebarengan. Mereka semua hanya bisa menangis sejadi-jadinya melihat kondisi Lay yang sudah amat mengenaskan. Tubuhnya penuh dengan luka tusukan, tempurung kepalanya yang sudah hancur, Jangan lupakan darah dan bau sengit yang seakan memenuhi hutan itu. rasa takut, sedih dan marah semuanya bercampur aduk. \"Cukup! Kita harus keluar dari hutan ini!\" ujar Tao frustasi \"APA KAU GILA!? APA YANG HARUS KITA KATAKAN KEPADA KELUARGANYA!?\" pekik Luhan frustasi \"Mungkin saja ia di makan oleh binatang buas. Disini bukan tempat aman lagi, Kita harus pergi dari sini\" sambung Tao yang mendapat tonjokan keras dari Sehun \"PERGI!, PERGILAH! SAAT KAU MELIHAT TEMANMU TEWAS DI HADAPANMU DAN KAU LEBIH MEMIKIRKAN DIRIMU!\" amuk Sehun pada Tao, sementara Tao menatapnya tajam dan berkata \"Aku tidak mau mati disini\" desis Tao lalu pergi meninggalkan mereka semua yang hanya mematung melihat temannya bersikap begitu egois. \"Sebaiknya kita mencegah Tao untuk pergi. Bagaimana bila terjadi sesuatu pada-\" \"Biarkan saja dia melakukan apa yang dia mau\" ujar Sehun. Di matanya tampak bahwa ia khawatir pada Tao, tapi kekecewaannya mengalahkan rasa sayangnya sebagai sahabat. Mereka membersihkan jenazah Lay lalu di baringkan di tempat tidur di sebelah Suho. Hari sudah mulai malam. Suho, Chen dan Sehun sudah tertidur, sementara Kris dan Luhan masih terjaga. Mereka mengalami goncangan. Kris memaklumi tindakan Tao yang masih seperti kekanak-kanakan itu. ia terlalu takut untuk tetap di sini. Ia sangat paham tentang Tao. \"Bagaimana keadaan Tao sekarang? Apakah dia sudah keluar dari hutan ini? Dia orang yang sangat penakut. Bagaimana kalau terjadi sesuatu padanya?\" Kris memberi pertanyaan yang bertubi pada Luhan, sementara Luhan hanya menghela nafas panjang \"Ayo kita cari dia\" ujar Luhan yang di beri tatapan 'apa kau gila' oleh Kris. \"aku bersungguh-sungguh\" lanjutnya. Akhirnya mereka menelusuri hutan itu di malam hari, karena gelap Kris mengeluarkan ponselnya dan berniat untuk mengaktifkan senternya, tapi ia di buat heran oleh sebuah pesan di grup chat mereka yang belum sempat Kris buka kemarin karena ia tidak menyetuh ponselnya. \"Maaf, bro. Aku tidak bisa ikut ke perkemahan itu. ayahku menerima undangan di new york. Aku di tugaskan untuk memimpin perusahaan ayahku sementara waktu. Kalau ada waktu luang aku akan menyempatkan diri hadir disana dan mengajakmu bersenang-senang.\" Kris terkejut melihat isi pesan itu. salah satu dari temannya tidak ikut. Tapi kenapa jumlah mereka lengkap? Jumlah akun di grup itu hanya tujuh. Bila satu tak ikut maka jumlahnya enam, tapi kenapa jumlahnya masih utuh? Yang ayahnya seorang pengusaha adalah Luhan, Chen dan Suho. Dan celakanya lagi di grup itu tak di tertera nama pengirim pesan. Hanya ada foto profil. Karena tak ada sinyal Kris tak bisa melihat profil pengirim pesan itu. anggapannya salah satu dari mereka adalah pembunuh yang menyamar. Apakah Chen? Apakah Suho? Atau jangan-jangan Luhan yang berniat membunuhnya saat ini?. \"Kris! Ada apa?\" Pertanyaan Luhan membuyarkan lamunan Kris \"Ah, iya.\" Jawab Kris gugup \"Apa yang terjadi? Kenapa kau terlihat ketakutan? Kita harus mencari Tao\" ucap Luhan yang membuat Kris teringat pada bahaya yang akan menerjang Tao. Kris dan Luhan terus menelusuri hutan dengan sesekali memanggil nama Tao. Sampai akhirnya Kris dan Luhan terpisah tanpa mereka sadari. Kris mulai ketakutan, teringat akan Luhan kemungkinan bisa membunuhnya di sini. Dia sendiri dan jauh dari jangkauan teman-temannya. Bisa saja Luhan membunuhnya di sini. Ia mulai menyesal karena menuruti saran Luhan yang berniat mencari Tao malam-malam begini. Tapi kalau Tao tidak di cari dia juga dalam bahaya. Kris benar-benar delima. Sampai akhirnya ia mendengar suara Luhan memanggilnya. Karena ketakutannya Kris pun berlari menuju rumah yang mereka tempati, ia merasa sedikit lega. Tapi wajahnya kembali memanik saat melihat Chen yang sudah bersimbah Darah dengan belati yang tertusuk di jantungnya dan luka-luka di badanya. Kris menjerit dan membuat mereka semua terbangun, tak lama reaksi yang sama juga di terapkan. Luhan kembali karena mendengar jeritan Kris. Melihat kondisi Chen ia hanya mematung dan bertanya \"Apa yang terjadi?\" tanya Luhan, suaranya begitu bergetar \"KAU JANGAN BERSANDIWARA LAGI! KAU MENGAJAKKU UNTUK MENCARI TAO SUPAYA KAU BISA MEMUDAHKAN RENCANAMU UNTUK MEMBUNUH KAMI KAN! KAU PIKIR AKU SEBODOH ITU\" Kris menarik kerah baju Luhan, Luhan yang masih belum mengerti hanya menatapnya heran \"Apa yang kau bicarakan Kris? Aku tidak membunuh siapapun, aku punya alibi. Untuk membunuh ulat saja aku tak sampai hati, mana mungkin aku membunuh manusia, apalagi temanku sendiri\" jelas Luhan \"Omong Kosong! Kau pikir aku bisa kau bodohi! Kau bukan Luhan! Tapi iblis yang menyamar menjadi Luhan untuk membunuh kami. Apa maumu hah!\" amuk Kris sementara Luhan, Sehun dan Suho masih belum paham akan hal yang di bicarakan oleh Kris \"Kris, jangan main hakim seperti itu, jelaskan pada kami kenapa kau menuduh Luhan seperti itu\" ujar Suho. Kris pun menjelaskan semuanya dan menunjukan pesan itu pada mereka semua. Mereka hanya terkejut dengan pernyataan Kris yang menuduh Luhan dengan alasan dia mencurigakan. \"Kalau begitu ada banyak kemungkinan. bisa jadi Suho\" ujar Sehun. Semua hening dengan pernyataan Sehun barusan \"Kau menuduhku membunuh Chen\" Suara Suho bergetar hebat. Ia tak percaya temannya sendiri menuduhnya pembunuh. Ia sangat terpukul. Bahkan belum selesai mereka menangisi kepergian Lay dan hilangnya Tao, kini mereka harus kehilangan Chen juga. Di tambah mereka masih takut dengan kenyataan mereka sedang bersama pembunuh gila itu disini. \"Hahaha, Kau menuduhku membunuh Chen karena aku mengajakmu untuk mencari Tao malam-malam begini? Dan saat aku bersamamu aku sempat tersesat. Jadi kau pikir saat aku menghilang darimu aku akan berlari dengan jarak 8km dari tempat kita mencari Tao untuk pergi kerumah dan membunuh Chen? Aku tersesat darimu selama 7 menit, kau pikir aku akan berlari selama 7 menit dengan jarak 8km?\" jelas Luhan panjang lebar pada kawannya terutama Kris. Sepertinya Kris mulai mengiyakan pernyataan Luhan yang cukup logis itu. Sehun dan Suho hanya menangis, mereka tak tau harus berbuat apa sekarang. \"Kenapa kau tak mencurigai Sehun? Bukankah dia yang mengajak kita ke Hutan ini?\" lanjut Suho yang melemparkan tatapan sinisnya pada Sehun. Sehun membelakan matanya tak percaya. \"Aku tak bermaksud seperti itu. aku tidak akan membunuh temanku sendiri, percayalah. Niatku mengajak kalian ke hutan ini hanya untuk menikmati keindahannya. Aku tidak menyangka sedikitpun hal ini akan terjadi \" Jelas Sehun yang hanya di beri tatapan tajam oleh Kris \"Apa yang kau mau dari kami?\" Kris terus berjalan mendekati Sehun seakan hendak menerkam Sehun. Sehun tak berani melawannya, seumur hidup baru kali ini ia melihat aura mengerikan dari Kris. \"Baik!, kalau aku yang membunuh Chen, bisa kau jelaskan padaku siapa yang membunuh Lay?\" tanya Sehun pada Kris, tetapi Sehun melemparkan tatapan tajamnya pada Suho. Kris dan Luhan di buat bingung oleh tatapan Sehun barusan \"Sehun, kau sudah menuduhku lagi\" kini Suho berusaha terlihat santai \"Banyak kemungkinan. Yang pertama, kau bukan Suho. Suho orang yang mudah panik, ia tidak akan sesantai dirimu dalam menghadapi masalah seperti ini. Yang kedua, kau menghilang saat kami hendak mencari jalan keluar dan Lay juga menghilang sebelum ia tewas. Yang ketiga, Suho tidur tepat di sebelah Chen, bisa saja saat aku tertidur dan kalian keluar dia mencari kesempatan untuk membunuh Chen. Keempat, ayah Suho juga seorang pengusaha kan?\" penjelasan Sehun membuat mereka yakin bahwa pembunuhnya adalah Suho \"Tertangkap kau sekarang\" Kris tersenyum jahat saat melihat reaksi Suho yang ketakutan. Pikirannya sudah tak waras seutuhnya. Ia tertekan. \"Kalian menyalahkanku! Kenapa tidak ada yang mencurigai Dia! Bisa saja dia sok pahlawan menyelamatkan kalian, tapi sebenarya dialah pembunuhnya\" kali ini Suho angkat bicara \"kalau aku pembunuhnya, bisa kau memberi bukti?\" Suho kalap. Ia tak bisa menuduh Kris karena ia tak punya bukti yang akurat. Kris membuat rencana untuk melindungi dirinya dan teman-temannya \"Sekarang, mau kita apakan pembunuh ini?\" kali ini Luhan terlihat begitu dendam pada Suho \"Sumpah! Aku tidak membunuh siapapun! Kenapa kalian tidak percaya!\" Suho menangis sejadi-jadinya, ntah kenapa ia tak memberi alasan untuk membela dirinya. \"Sekarang menjelang fajar, kita akan pergi dari hutan ini sebelum pembunuh ini merencanakan hal lainnya\" \"Kenapa kalian menuduhku karena sikapku yang berubah? Kenapa kalian berpikir bodoh dengan menganggapku iblis yang menyamar? Apa kalian terlalu bodoh untuk mempercayai pernyataan gila itu?\" tanya Suho \"Baik. Anggap saja kau bukan iblis atau sejenisnya. Tapi bagaimana dengan ke tiga bukti lainnya?\" Suho tak bisa menjawab lagi. Suasana hening sejenak sampai akhirnya Luhan bersuara. \"Kita kurung saja ia di rumah ini! Kita juga tidak bisa membawa jenazah Lay dan Chen. Jadi, bila kita sudah keluar dari hutan ini, kita akan memanggil polisi untuk membawa jenazah Chen, Lay dan kita biarkan pembunuh ini mati membusuk di sini\" bak tertusuk seribu pedang, Suho benar-benar terpukul. Hatinya menjerit dalam diam. Ia berusaha tegar. Sehun mengikat Suho yang terduduk di kursi kayu itu. ia hanya meringis dan tak berkata apapun. Tapi hati mereka bertiga tak tersentuh sedikitpun melihat keadaan Suho tersebut. Akhirnya mereka meningglkan Suho dan menutup tempat-tempat yang memungkinkan untuk kabur. Mereka terus berjalan mencari jalan keluar dari hutan itu. mereka sudah berada di luar rumah, sudah sangat lama mereka mengitari hutan itu. tak sengaja Luhan menginjak sesuatu. \"Apa ini?\" ujar Luhan yang memeriksa benda yang ia injak itu. Kris terkejut saat melihat sesuatu yang tak jauh darinya. Tak lama Luhan tersadar bahwa ia telah menyentuh bola mata. Dengan panik ia melempar benda yang ia sentuh itu dan berlari mendekati Kris, reaksinya tak jauh beda dari Kris saat ia juga melihat sesuatu yang Kris lihat. \"TAO!\" jerit Kris menghampiri tubuh Tao yang terikat di pohon itu. keadaannya sangat mengenaskan. kedua bola matanya tak ada di matanya. Luhan benar-benar ngilu melihat kondisi Tao yang tak jauh beda dari Lay sebelumnya. \"Kris, jelaskan padaku. Apa kau yang membunuh Tao!\" Luhan membentak Kris yang masih mematung. \"JELASKAN PADAKU!\" Luhan mengoncang tubuh Kris yang masih kaku. \"AKU TIDAK AKAN MEMBUNUH MANUSIA DENGAN CARA GILA SEPERTI INI!\" Luhan bungkam akibat bentakan Kris tersebut. Tao adalah orang yang paling dekat dengan Kris. Ia benar-benar terpukul atas kepergian sahabatnya itu. Luhan merangkul Kris. Mereka menangis dan sejenak mereka tersadar. \"Dimana Sehun?\" . Di sisi lain Tap Tap Tap Suara derap kaki terdengar jelas dalam kesunyian itu. Suho terbangun karena suara itu. ia membelakan matanya dan merontah-rontah untuk berusaha lari dari rumah itu. tapi naas, ia terikat erat di kursi itu. \"Ka-kau? Masih hidup? Kumohon jangan bunuh aku\" ujar Suho memohon pada orang itu. Sementara orang itu hanya tersenyum dan berkata \"Terima kasih, telah melindungi ku. Suho\" ujar orang itu, kemudian dengan sigap ia menembak Suho tepat di kepalanya. Suho tewas dalam sekejap. Orang itu pergi meninggalkan Suho di sana . \"SEHUN!\" jerit Luhan memanggil Sehun. Luhan dan Kris mencari Sehun di hutan itu. mendadak sehun menghilang. Tapi mereka malah menemukan rumah itu lagi. Ada yang aneh dari rumah itu, pintunya terbuka. Dengan sigap Kris dan Luhan memasuki rumah itu. mereka di kejutkan dengan kondisi Suho yang sudah tewas tertembak. Luhan masih sangat shock. Kris mengatup rahangnya geram \"Kau tak kan bisa lolos dariku!\" Dengan menggebuh-gebuh Kris pergi mencari Sehun, Luhan segera menyusul Kris. Tapi dalam perjalanan itu, tiba-tiba Luhan tertembak tepat di jantungnya. Kris mematung melihat sahabatnya tewas di depan mata kepalanya sendiri. Ia tersungkur ke tanah. Luhan masih sekarat. Ia memeluk Luhan erat. \"Kumohon bertahanlah, aku tidak mau kehilangan sahabatku untuk kesekian kalinya. KUMOHON JANGAN TINGGALKAN AKU!\" Kris menangis sejadinya \"Setidaknya aku tenang saat mengetahui bahwa kau bukan pembunuh itu\" ujar Luhan tersenyum, lalu ia menutup matanya. Ia tewas. Amarah Kris sudah tak terkontrol, ia sudah tak bisa berpikir dengan jernih. Bahkan ia sudah tidak takut kalau dia harus mati terbunuh seperti ke lima temannya. Rasa bersalahnya terhadap Suho masih menghantuinya. Ia benar-benar terpukul. Ia terus berjalan menelusuri hutan itu. \"KELUAR KAU SEHUN!\" Kris menjerit di tengah hutan pagi itu. ia terus menelusuri hutan itu. setiap pohon ia lewati, dengan geram ia memanggil Sehun. Sehunlah pembuat sekenario ini. Sampai akhirnya, langkahnya terhenti ketika ia melihat tetesan darah dari ranting pohon di hadapannya. Dengan hati-hati ia mendongakkan kepalanya, ia sangat terkejut. \"Se-sehun\" kali ini Kris ketakutan melihat Sehun yang tertusuk di ranting pohon itu. tak lama Sehun terjatuh ke tanah. Tinggi pohon itu tiga meter. \"Siapa yang membunuh Sehun dengan cara seperti itu?\", \"Apakah dia bunuh diri?\", \"Kalau iya, bagaimana cara dia melakukannya?\" \"Kenapa ini serumit seperti Algoritma?\" pikir Kris berkecamuk sampai akhirnya Kris mengambil kesimpulan bahwa pembunuh itu masih di sini, dan mengawasinya. Sadar akan hal itu Kris terus berlari mencari jalan keluar dari hutan itu. dia terus berlari walau sesekali ia tersandung oleh akar pohon, sampai akhirnya ia menemukan jalan dimana mobil pick up itu mengantar mereka sebelumnya. Kris masih ingat arah menuju jalan raya dari jalan ini. Ia merasa sedikit lega. Tapi ketika ia hendak menuju jalan tersebut, ponselnya berdering. Kris dengan sigap melihat pesan dari ponselnya. Lagi-lagi ia terkejut dengan isi pesan tersebut \"Kris, Kau lupa bahwa digrup ini terdapat 8 akun, apa kau melupakanku hmm? Apa kau juga lupa bahwa ayahku juga seorang pengusaha? Aku berkata kalau ada waktu luang aku akan menyempatkan diri kemari bersamamu kan? Kau benar-benar sudah melupakanku? Kita hanya tak bertemu selama dua tahun, tapi kau sudah melupakanku. Sekarang menghadaplah ke belakang. Aku di belakangmu\" Kris menangis ketakutan. Ia tak tau harus apa, tubuhnya melemas. Tapi ia tak berani menghadap ke belakang. Ia merutuki dirinya sendiri karena menyempatkan untuk membaca pesan itu. \"Kris, Wu yi fan , Dhuizang. Bahkan aku masih mengingat nama-namamu semasa sekolah dulu. Aku adalah orang pertama yang dekat denganmu sebelum kau dekat dengan Tao sekarang. Aku sedih kau melupakanku setelah kecelakaan dua tahun yang lalu. Tapi, sekarang aku tau penyebab kau mulai melupakanku. Kau tak mau terus bersedih mengingat kematianku, kau sempat berniat bunuh diri setelah mengetahui kematianku. Tapi ingat kawan, sekalipun aku sudah tiada dari bumi ini, aku tetap menjagamu dimanapun kau berada. Hmmm, anggap saja Tuhan mengirimku untuk menjagamu Kris. Kau sudah kuanggap seperti kakakku sendiri. Bukankah kau selalu berdoa supaya Tuhan mengizinkanmu untuk selalu bersama denganku? Sekarang Tuhan telah mengabulkan doamu. Sekarang kita bertemu di akhir musim semi\" orang itu bersuara, dia benar-benar di belakang Kris sekarang. Kris menangis mengingat semua kenanganya bersama orang itu. Kris mengenali suara ini. Ia membalikan tubuhnya dan menatap orang itu dengan tatapan tak percaya. Suasana hutan itu berubah menjadi taman yang indah. Di sisi lain, ia melihat dirinya sendiri di sisi orang itu. Kris yang berbeda darinya. Jalan tadi kini berubah menjadi jurang yang curam, saat ini Kris berada di tebing itu. \"Baekhyun? Kau masih hidup? Bagaimana bisa?\" Kris masih bingung melihat Baekhyun kawan lamanya yang sudah meninggal dua tahun yang lalu kini ada di hadapanya. \"Ikutlah denganku Kris, aku Tidak ingin kau mengalami kesulitan lagi di sana\" Baekhyun menunjuk jurang di belakang Kris. Tapi Kris masih belum mengerti dengan pernyataan Baekhyun \"Tapi, bagaimana kau bisa di sini? Apa kau yang membunuh mereka semua?\" Baekhyun hanya menunduk. \"Aku terpaksa melakukannya\" ujar Baekhyun \"Kenapa kau membunuh mereka dengan cara tak manusiawi seperti itu?\" Kris mulai geram \"AKU INGIN KAU MENGINGAT KEMATIANKU KRIS!\" Kris menyiritkan dahinya \"Kau ingat? Bagaimana hancurnya wajahku saat kecelakaan itu? aku membunuh mereka dengan cara seperti itu, supaya kau mengingatku. Tapi kau sudah sepenuhnya melupakanku\" ujar Baekhyun \"Aku tidak pernah melupakanmu, aku Teringat padamu saat melihat kondisi Lay. Aku teringat padamu saat aku bercanda dengan mereka semua. Aku mengingatmu. Selalu mengingatmu! Tapi, aku tidak mau terlihat lemah karena terpuruk dalam kesedihan itu\" ujar Kris, Baekhyun hanya mematung \"Pergilah Kris, belum saatnya kau di sini, Baekhyun kau tak boleh egois, kalau kau benar-benar menyayanginya biarkan Kris pergi dan melanjutkan hidupnya.\" Ujar Kris di sisi Baekhyun. Kris masih heran dengan kondisi yang ia alami saat ini. \"Bagaimana dirinya bisa menjadi dua?\" pikir Kris. Baekhyun hanya menatapnya sendu. Belum sempat Kris berkata Tiba-tiba Baekhyun mendekat dan mendorong Kris hingga ia terpental dan jatuh ke jurang itu. pandangannya kini menjadi gelap. . . Kris mulai sadar, ia mengedipkan matanya berkali-kali, ia menatap heran ke sekelilingnya. \"Di mana aku?\" tanyanya \"Syukurlah kau sadar! Kau koma selama sebulan! Membuat kami khawatir saja. Kau di rumah sakit sekarang\" ujar Tao yang mendapat anggukan dari ke lima temannya dan juga orang tuanya \"Apa?\" \"Saat kita hendak ke hutan untuk reuni, kita mengalami kecelakaan. Mobil pick up itu menghantam pohon. Kau, Sehun, Luhan, Tao dan Suho mengalami koma. Dan selamat! kaulah yang paling lama sadar Kris\" ujar Lay \"Aku bermimpi kita terbunuh di hutan itu, tapi aku sempat bertemu baekhyun dan dia-\" \"Sudah kuduga, kita bermimpi sama bung. Dan terakhir aku memilih terjun ke jurang. Aku terlalu takut padanya\" \"Tapi dia mendorongku?\" Kris masih bertanya-tanya tentang mimpinya dan yang lainnya hanya menyiritkan dahinya. \"Dia masih mau kau hidup Kris. Kita harus memanfaatkan kehidupan ini dengan sangat baik. Kejadian ini menyadarkanku bahwa dalam hidup kita harus banyak berpikir positif, dan tidak berprasangka buruk. Baekhyun mengajarkan banyak hal pada kita\" jelas Suho \"Aku terlalu sering berfoya-foya\" \"Aku sering membantah ibuku\" \"Kesimpulannya. Kita harus menjalani hidup dengan sebaik-baiknya\" ujar Chen yang mendapat anggukan dari lainnya. Tapi Kris masih belum paham seutuhnya . . 1 bulan kemudian. \"Terima kasih Baekhyun, kau telah merubah hidup kami\" ujar Sehun \"Kami akan sering mengunjungimu di sini\" ujar Luhan \"Dan akan selalu mendoakanmu. Suatu saat kita semua akan bertemu, baekhyunie\" ujar Kris, mereka semua memeluk batu nisan Baekhyun. semenjak insiden itu kehidupan mereka berubah menjadi lebih baik lagi. mereka berhasil menjadi anak yang patuh dan lebih menghargai hidupnya. Mereka kini telah menjadi orang yang sukses. Reuni akhir musim semi itu telah merubah hidup mereka menjadi lebih baik lagi. Empat tahun telah berlalu. Tapi Kris masih tak paham akan pesan Baekhyun di grup chat dalam mimpinya. Ia masih tak bisa membedakan mana yang nyata dan mana yang ilusi. Pesan dalam mimpi itu, yang menyatakan Baekhyun ada di belakangnya itu benar-benar tertulis di grup itu dan Baekhyunlah penulisnya. . end ","Summary":" AKHIR MUSIM SEMI Di akhir musim semi tahun ini salah satu dari mereka mengadakan reuni, tapi kali i"},{"Movie":"A Crime","Title":"Daydream girl","Author":"Amazing.danasuarus","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11100218","Passage":"[Chapter 1] p style=\"text-align: left;\"19/09/2015, Tuesday. I'm standing right in the middle of the main corridor in school, I'm oblivious of what's around me, people see me but I don't see them. All I could think about was her and how perfect she is with her sparkling eyes and her long lushis hair falling down her back and shoulders, *thinking* she's so beautiful, I just wish I could turn back time and make her mine again. But now she's with \"him\", the other boy, she will never want me back.

As I walked to my computer and typed out; Gab Turner (on top) babysitter (under my name) contact me at 708-342-1023 (on the bottom). I printed one hundred papers, I quickly ran outside to the town like a rabbit in fear. I went inside a store called 'News paper daily\" I grabbed the stapler gently and stapled 2 signs on a bulletin board on a pink neon poster soon I got tired from posting signs in 20 different stores. Later in the week I got a call! A single husband needed a babysitter from 9 am-7pm for ten dollars an hour. Of course I would take it, good money right? Monday morning, slam! My car door closes. I walked to this big lovely house it was like a Michael Jordan house. *Knock* *knock* A guy holding his daughter opened it. \"Hello, are you the babysitter?\" he said. \"Hello! Yes I am, my name is Gab turner and your name is?\" I said firmly. \"I'm Jack Park, welcome to my house this is my daughter Agnes Park\" Jack was holding a little girl who had a dark brown pony tail, bangs covering her forehead and big brown eyes. Agnes was wearing a yellow/grey stripe shirt and overalls over. She was so cute! \"Hello big man!\" Agnes shouted waving her tiny hands, \"hello little girl!\" I shouted smiling. As I stepped in the house it smelt like strawberries, jack was touring me around his house. Showing me what Agnes can and cannot eat, it was a pretty long list a minute later Jack led me to her room. A bed full of minions they were yellow, had on round goggles, and black gloves. \"Okay you are all set, if you need to ask questions call me\" jack said \"Okay thank you so much\" I replied back.

When I walked into the bathroom I looked in the mirror. \"He's gone. He's dead. He's never gonna come back.\" I said to myself. I stared at myself in the mirror. I looked closely. It's couldn't be! It can't! I seen Michael in the mirror. I turned around. Just my imagination. I walked down to the hall to get my niece Jamie. I found out last year Jamie went through a lot, too. Michael tried to kill Jamie. When she touched Michael she went crazy and killed her mom. Then she was sent to a hospital. For a while she couldn't talk but she learned how to talk again. I knocked on the door. \"Jamie, time to wake up.\" I walked in and she was looking out the window. \"What's wrong, Jamie?\" I asked. \"Tomorrow's halloween. He's gonna come back. He'll try to get me.\" She replied. I could see a tear roll down her cheek. \"Jamie, he's dead-\" \"No, he's not, Jazmin. How many times have people told me and you that? He's not gone.\" More tears came down. I could tell she was very frightened. \"How about we go have breakfast?\" She stood up. I took her hand and we walked downstairs. When we got downstairs she sat down at the table. I made her eggs and bacon. She just sat there and looked at her food. \"Come on, Jamie. You have to eat.\" I told her. \"I'm not hungry.\" She said lowly. \"Ok. If you're not hungry go upstairs and get dressed so I can take you to school.\" *Jamie* I looked through my closet. I found a pink shirt and jeans. I heard the sound of glass breaking! I turned around slowly. I seen the picture of me and Jazmin broken. Someone grabbed my arm. I turned around. It was Michael! \"JAZMIN! It's Michael! AHHHHH!\" *Jazmin* I ran upstairs to Jamie. \"Jamie!\" I opened the door and I didn't see Jamie. I heard loud crying from under the bed. I looked under the bed. Jamie crawled from underneath the bed. She hugged me. \"H-h-he's here! In the closet.\" Jamie cried. I picked her up and walked over to the closet. I opened it and turned on the light. I didn't see anyone. \"Jamie, no one is here.\" I put her down. \"How about I let you stay home and we go get you a costume?\" I asked Jamie. She nodded her head. We went to the halloween store. I met up with some old friends. Their names were Tori and Jennifer. \"Hey, Tori. Hey, Jennifer. You remember my neice Jamie.\" \"Hi, Jamie. You looking for a costume?\" Jennifer asked Jamie. \"Yeah.\" Jamie said looking at the floor. \"Hang on, girls. I'm gonna help Jamie pick out a costume.\" I told them. I walked over to where the costumes were with Jamie. She started looking at a princess costume. It came with gloves, the crown, and shoes. \"You like that one, Jamie?\" \"Yes. Can I get it?\" She looked up at me. \"Sure.\" I looked over to see Michael Myer's mask on the floor. It had spats of red liquid on it. I guess a halloween mask. \"Alright, Jamie wants this one.\" I told Tori. Tori scanned it, put it in a bag and handed it to Jamie. \"You wanna be a princess?\" Tori said. \"Yeah. I like princesses.\" Jamie replied. \"I think you'd be a very beautiful princess.\" Tori said smiling. Stuff started falling over. I ran over there. The mask was gone. Tori came back there, too. \"Ugh! Who did that? Probably kids. Someone is going to pick it up not me!\" Tori yelled. I didn't understand. Why would someone knock everything down just to get a mask? \"Ok, well we gotta go. Bye Jennifer, bye Tori!\" I yelled. I took Jamie's hand we walked to the car. I seen a man parked next to us in his car. He was wearing the Michael Myer's mask that was in the store. He stared at me. \"Jazmin, who's that man?\" Jamie asked worried. \"Uhh... No one.\" I got Jamie in the car and we started driving. The man started following us. Why was he sitting there and he leaves when we left? He started getting very close to us. Then he hit us! He kept hitting the back of the car. \"Jazmin! Make him stop!\" Jamie screamed. He got on the side of us and pushed us off the road in a bunch of trees. We kept flipping and we landed upside down. \"Jamie, you alright?\" I said in pain. I didn't get an answer. I started smelling fire so I pulled myself out of the car. I was walking limp to the other side of the car. I pulled the door open. \"Jamie!\" I pulled her out of the car. Her eyes were closed and she was holding her bag. I picked her up and started walking up the hill, trying to get back up on the road. My leg was making me walk limp. I had to crawl the rest of the way because my leg wouldn't let me. I finally got on the road. I had Jamie in my arm and waved around my free hand jumping up and down. My leg hurt so bad. I just needed help. A blue car pulled up. It was Stephanie, Hunter, Roseivelt, and Jaden. \"What happened?\" Stephanie yelled looking concerned. She helped me in the car. I told her everything. Hunter was driving me and Jamie to a hospital. Jamie layed down in my lap. I think she passed out. When we were flipping she hit her head on the window then hit her forehead. I hoped Jamie was ok. I held the tears back. I just held Jamie tight in my hand and looked at her. When we got to the hospital it was getting late so Stephanie and everyone else had to leave. Jamie was in the bed next to me. She didn't move. All she did was sit still with her eyes closed. I wanted to check if she was ok. I hoped all she was doing was sleeping. I got out of my bed. Then I realized I had a cast on my leg. I still walked but limp to Jamie's bed. I shook her a little bit. \"Jamie, baby?\" I whispered. She opened her eyes slowly. \"Thank God!\" I hugged her. \"Jazmin?\" Jamie said smiling. A bunch of noises came from downstairs. Like... stuff falling. I remembered how at the halloween store stuff fell. I seen Jamie still had her costume in her hand. What am I worried about? The nurse probably just dropped stuff. There's nothing to worry about. \"What was that?\" Jamie asked. \"Uhhh... Nothing. Let me check.\" I said. I tip toed slowly to the door. I opened it and looked out. I seen Michael looking rooms! \"Jamie! Get in the closet, now!\" I whispered loudly. Jamie got up with her bag and ran to the closet door. I ran with her. I picked her up and put her on the top shelf. I hid her behind a bunch of stuff on the shelf. \"Don't make a sound.\" I whispered. I hid againest the wall in the darkness. I heard someone open the door. I held my breath. I stood still. I heard the door open. I closed my eyes tightly. Michael walked to the closet. He grabbed me. Chapter 2 \"AHHHHHHH!\" Jamie started screaming with me. I started shaking, squriming, kicking, and punching. I opened my eyes. It was the doctor. \"Hey, hey, hey. It's just me. Are you ok?\" He asked. \"Oh my god! Yeah, I'm fine.\" I answered. I took Jamie off the shelf. \"Ok, you two need to get some rest. You're ok.\" He smiled. He laid me and Jamie down and turned out the lights. We got out of the hospital and today was Halloween! \"You ready, Jamie?\" I called. She was getting dressed. She finally came down. \"Oh my gosh! Jamie you look so beautiful!\" I exclaimed. I grabbed my camera and took a picture of her. We walked out the door and I went trick or treating with Jamie. *Hours later* \"Can we just go to this last house, please Jazmin?\" Jamie asked dissapointed. \"Ok, but after this we go home.\" I smiled. I went with her to the door. Jamie knocked. Someone answered the door. He was wearing a Michael Myers mask. I was surprised Jamie wasn't afraid. \"Trick or treat!\" Jamie said. She held out her basket. He just stood there. \"Umm...Hello?\" I said. He put candy in her basket slowly. He grabbbed Jamie! \"AHHHHHHHH! LET GO OF ME! JAZMIN, HELP ME!\" Jamie screamed on the top of her lungs. I tried to pull him off Jamie. He let go of her. He stared at us for a little bit and then took off his mask. It really was Michael! I picked up Jamie and started backing up. He put back on his mask and grabbed a knife. I started to run as fast as I could. Jamie was weeping. She was so scared I could feel her shaking with fear. I ran and ran. But when I thought he wouldn't get us I tripped over a tree branch. I breath got knocked out. \"Go, Jamie! Run! I'll be there just go!\" I said. Jamie stood up and started to run. I looked to see where Michael was. He was almost to me. I stood up and ran to Jamie. I picked her up from behind. \"AHHHH! DON\"T KILL ME, PLEASE!\" Jamie yelled shaking. \"Jamie, it's just me!\" I was running out of breath. I ran into an empty house. That's when I realized that it was Michael's house. No turning back now. I ran through the house and fell through a hole in the floor. It was the basement. It was dark. The only light was from the moon. I hid againest the wall. \"Jamie, I'm going to hide you in a box just in case something happens.\" I whispered. I kissed her forehead. I hid her in a box behind alot of stuff. I held my breath and made no movement. I seen a shadow. Michael jumped in the hole. He looked around and looked in my direction. He walked over to me. Luckly he didn't see me. Until I started breathing hard he heard me. He turned on the light. He looked at me. Then he started walking over to me. I just kept backing up even though my back was pressed againest the wall. \"Don't kill me, please. Don't kill me.\" I said. Michael finally was close to me. He put the knife to my neck. I kicked him. I just grabbed alot of stuff and started throwing it at him. I then grabbed a axe. I ran over to him and hit his leg. He fell to the floor. I took Jamie out of the box. I grabbed the rope and climbed out the hole. I ran out and to someone else's house. I pounded on the door and rang the doorbell. Someone answered it. I ran in when the door opened. I set down Jamie. \"Help! There's a killer out there trying to kill us. Help us, please.\" I pleaded. It was a family. Mother, father, 2 daughters, and a brother. The mom locked the door. It had four locks on it. I guess they just wanted to be safe. \"Aylissa, go lock all the windows.\" The mom said to the oldest daughter. \"Nick and Bailey go and hide in the cellar with her and your sister.\" The father stood up. \"Come on we need to hide with the kids and turn off everything to make it look like we're gone.\" He said. The mom turned out the light and tv. We all ran to the basement and lifted up an old door on the floor. The kids went in first and we closed it and locked from the inside. Wow, they have alot of protection in the house. We all moved far away from the door and sat in a dark corner. We were so far away we couldn't see the door no more. I had Jamie in my lap. I was shaking with fear. I hoped he didn't come here. When we ran I don't think he seen us. Also if he did see us come in this house how would he know where we're at? So many questions ran through my head. I was just too terrified to think of anything else. That's when we seen a shadow was over the door. Chapter 3 \"Ottis!\" Nick shouted. He unlocked the door and grabbed the dog. \"Nick, you dummy! How could you leave Ottis?\" The older girl, Aylissa screamed. \"Aylissa, shush!\" The mother said. Jamie hugged me and had her head turned away so she couldn't see anything. I held her tightly in my arms. I didn't want anything to happen to her. I could hear her breathing. That's when the basement door slammed open. It got silent and none of us made any movement. I knew Micheal was coming for me but I didn't want everyone else getting killed because of me. We started going deeper into the cellar. \"Ok, I'm gonna go out there. You all go deeper and Jamie stay with them.\" I whispered. I crawled over to the cellar door. I took a deep breath. I unlocked the door slowly and stepped out. Micheal turned to see me. He walked over to me slowly. He pushed me againest the wall. The wall was cold and I started to shiver. I stared at Micheal in his eyes with hate. His big hand was wrapped around my neck and the knife was being held back. \"Go ahead. Kill me. Just don't kill no one else.\" I said. He just stood there. \"Kill me.\" All of a sudden I realized I wasn't scared no more. \"I'm tired of running. Kill me...NOW!\" I had my hands balled into fist. I was getting tired of him just running around killing people. Now, he has me and won't kill me. He stood still like a statue. I could feel his hand getting looser. I think killers didn't like it when you tell them to kill you. So I just stared into his eyes. His eyes were filled with shame, hate, sadness, and kill. He let go of me. I took his mask off. The same face I seen before. A sad, hateful man. He handed his knife to me. He wanted me to kill him like I did last time. I turned to see Jamie standing on the cellar door. Micheal tried to grabbed the knife from me. I pulled it from him and stabbed his chest. He fell to the hard concrete. \"Jamie, why didn't stay with them?\" I asked worried. \"The end of the cellar had spikes and killed them.\" Jamie ran to me and hugged me. I picked her up and that's when a cold hand grabbed my ankle. He made me fall to the floor with him. I let Jamie go. \"Jamie, run!\" I shouted. Jamie ran out the door. I tried to escape Micheal's grasp. I still had the knife in my hand. I stabbed his hand. He let me go. I stood up and ran out the door. I found the front door and grabbed the knob. I could hear Micheal coming. I turned the knob and ran. \"Jamie! Jamie, where are you?\" I screamed. I seen her all the way down the road. I ran as fast as I could to her. \"Jamie!\" She turned to see me and ran to me. I picked her up and ran. I just wanted to run anywhere to get away from Micheal. \"Hurry, Jazmin! He's coming!\" That made me even more frightend so I ran faster. My chest started to hurt. I could feel my heart beating. I seen a police station up ahead. I started to go faster and faster. I ran in the police station. \"Jamie stay here and tell the police what's going on.\" I said. I went outside. I finally seen police all around me. \"Go inside, ma'am.\" One of them said. \"No. He wants me and he'll kill all of you to get me.\" I replied. I didn't turn my head. My eyes were locked on Micheal. The police started shooting. He fell hard. So hard you could hear a crack. Chapter 3 Jamie stared at me. I didn't know if he was still alive or not. \"What are you going to do to him?\" Jamie asked scared. \"I'm going to set him on fire.\" I grabbed gasoline from someone's truck and poured it all over him. A cop gave me a lighter and I set him on fire. I held Jamie's hand and we all stared at the fire in silence. When the fire was gone me and Jamie walked home. I opened the door and she walked in. I walked in with her and locked the door. She ran to me and hugged me. I picked her up. \"What was the hug for, Jamie?\" \"I just wanted to let you know I loved you.\" Jamie smiled and wrapped her arms around my neck giving me a hug. I set her down. \"I love you, too, Jamie.\" ","Summary":" Chapter 1 I woke up feeling drowsy.

He must of chased others, too. Venna has been staying with us until she's returning to college. You know, Venna and I kissed at the hospital, but Fuller kissed her, too, so, I wonder if she likes me or Fuller. Hopefully me, and Fuller has been arrested MANY times, so she might not want him, but who knows. Today, us three are going to my roommate's, Danny's, house party. At age 21, most people go nuts, but I'm going to behave good, unlike Fuller. Once we are on the interstate, Fuller said to me, \"Hey, Lewis, are you gonna find some girls to get drunk with?\" I looked at him and said, \"Fuller, I'm not going to drink, ok? I'm staying with normal drinks.\" Fuller chuckled and said, \"Yeah. Sure. How 'bout you, Venna?\" She smiled and said, \"I'll drink a couple, just not like 15 cups.\" I told her, \"Just don't fall in love with other guys.\" We all laughed and we just kept driving. About 5 more minutes into the drive, I turned up the radio. The guy said, \"Dangerous truck driver, Russell Nail, is now ready to come here to Colorado to kill some more victims.\" I said, \"No!\" The guy said, \"Oh yes! So you might want to be careful!\" Venna said, \"It's alright. He won't find us at Danny's house.\" Fuller sighed and said, \"You make everything better.\" She smiled brightly at him. I said, \"Let's stay away from this freak.\" Venna stared into my eyes and she… is just the hottest girl. I, obviously, love her like a sister. About 2 hours into the party, I was drunk. I think I broke my promise to not drink, but I drank 20 beers. It actually feels good, though. Releasing my \"Fuller\" side. I was hanging out with this other group of girls. The girls were Dylan, Lauren, Corie, Savannah, and Anna. Trust me, they were all hot. I think I was going to go to bed with Savannah, but I'd keep it a secret for a while. Corie said, \"Want another drink, Lewis?\" I smiled and Lauren said, \"How old are you?\" I replied, \"Get me another drink and I'm 21.\" Anna said, \"Are you dating anyone?\" I laughed and Savannah said, \"I love your laugh. Practically your whole sexy body.\" I love her body, too. Fuller was sitting on a step with a girl named Jaden. Fuller was into her and she was into him, so they kissed each other like CRAZY. Venna was hanging out with other girls, who turned out to like Venna. Anyways, I told MY group of girls, \"No, I'm single. But 1 of you, I want to put on my body.\" The girls literally surrounded me, and Dylan said, \"Please choose me.\" I said, \"I have fallen in love… with… Savannah.\" The other girls started crying and they went away. Savannah smiled and I took her hand and I lead her to Danny's room and we did you-know-what. Fuller watched me take her in and he said, \"He loves her.\" Jaden and him started kissing again. Venna was now alone, drinking though. About 1 hour later, I came out with Savannah and she said, \"Okay. I loved you for 2 hours, but now I like someone else.\" I nodded, \"Same. I'll see you later.\" Then we left each other and it was now time to leave. On the way back, I spotted Fuller sleeping and Venna changing the C.B radio channels. She finally heard a voice saying, \"Lewis, Fuller, Venna. You there?\" She froze and she said, \"No way.\" I said, \"Hey, talk to him. See what he wants.\" Fuller instantly woke up and said, \"What does this idiot want?\" Venna said, \"Hello?\" Rusty Nail said, \"How'd your party go? Did it feel good to put Savannah's body on yours, Lewis? What'd she taste like?\" Venna had tears in her eyes and she asked, \"You did that with someone?\" I looked at her and she answered, \"What do you want?\" Rusty Nail chuckled and said, \"Meet me at the next hotel. Room 17. I want to show you something.\" I finally answered, \"Hey, we aren't falling for that. And I don't like Savannah. I only did for 2 hours.\" Fuller said, \"Listen, Russell, one month ago, we made a mistake, and you tricked us into thinking that you were dead. Now, we are grown-ups, and we won't mess with you anymore, so leave us alone.\" Rusty said, \"If you don't show up, you're dead.\" Venna said, \"Just go.\" Then I drove to the hotel. For 30 minutes, Rusty Nail kept saying crap about us. I HATE this guy. When we arrived, Rusty Nail himself was waiting by room 17. We got out and he said, \"Wow. Look how much you've grown. 21 years old.\" Fuller raised his hand and said, \"I'm 26.\" Rusty Nail glared at him and Fuller put his hand down. Rusty Nail said, \"I know you guys love each other. So I want you guys to go wait in the cornfield.\" We went towards the field, but Rusty Nail barked, \"When I said 'guys', I meant guys. Venna will stay here. With me.\" I said, \"Why?\" Rusty Nail said, \"Go to the field!\" Fuller and I slowly walked towards the field. We overheard their \"pep talk\". Rusty Nail said, \"Which Thomas boy do you love better and why?\" I heard Venna start crying. Fuller whispers, \"Who does he love better?\" I shrugged. We heard Venna say, \"I am crazy in love with Lewis, but he obviously loves that Savannah girl. I love him because he's cute and he's just like me and he's nice.\" Fuller said, \"God dang it!\" I felt disappointed in myself. I love Venna, not Savannah. Rusty Nail said, \"Now that you're 21, would you want to do that with him and marry him?\" Venna said, \"Any day. I love him like a brother. He's MY brother.\" I said, \"I feel stupid. I let her down.\" We ran into the field. I kept smacking myself in the head in frustration and I cried in frustration. Then I heard Venna scream and I screamed, \"Venna! Venna, are you okay?! Venna!\" Fuller said, \"Oh my god, what'd he do with her?!\" Venna's scream faded and I heard Rusty Nail start up his semi. He drove out towards us and we started running like wild animals. It turns out, he wasn't heading for us. He was heading for a tree. He crashed into the tree. Fuller said, \"Why would he do that?\" Then I saw him carry a bloody person. Oh my god, it's Venna! She's hurt! \"Fuller, Rusty Nail wasn't driving! Venna was! She's hurt!\" Then he dropped her body on the ground and got back in his truck. He started driving towards us! Now, we ran towards Venna, but Rusty Nail was still chasing us. I shook Venna saying, \"Venna! Wake up! Please wake up!\" The truck finally got close to us and Rusty Nail hopped out of his truck. Fuller said, \"Is she dead?!\" Rusty Nail held up a gun and shrugged. He said, \"Ya'll hear that, Lewis? She loves you, but you got another woman in mind. So I took her. And injured her bad enough.\" I said, \"What does her loving me have to do with you holding a gun at us?\" Venna slowly woke up and it turns out, Rusty Nail dropped another gun. She grabbed it and immediately shot him in the head. He fell to the ground and she went back to \"sleep\". I'm pretty sure he's dead. Fuller and I looked at Venna. I bent down next to her and I rubbed her head. I said, \"Venna, trust me. I don't love Savannah. I'm seriously into you. I've loved you for years. You're always on my mind and ever since little kids, I've been wanting to call you Venna Thomas. I want to marry you and I want to start a family with you. You've said you've always wanted twins, so have them with me. Venna… I really hope you heard what I just said. So please come back.\" I looked at her and Fuller said, \"Wow, bro. That's touching.\" Great news, she started moving and she said, \"Lewis, I'll marry you any day. I love you.\" I smiled at her and then she kissed me. Fuller said, \"You should be darn happy, Lewis.\" I smiled and I asked Venna, \"Venna Wilcox, will you marry me?\" She gasped happily and said, \"Yes! Oh my god! Yes!\" I love her. She's my fiancé now, and later, she'll be my wife, and a mother. 2 years later, mow that Venna and I are now married, we've planned to have kids. Venna's been pregnant for 5 months now, and today, we are finding out the gender of the baby. As she headed into a room, her doctor followed her. He took her temperature and all that stuff. She finally said, \"Do you know how many there are in there?\" The doctor said, \"No. I'll check.\" He did the ultrasound on her, and he said, \"Congrats! It's a girl-.\" Venna shouted, \"Yay!\" He looked confused and continued, \"And a boy. You're having a male/female set of twins!\" Venna said, \"Oh my god! I'm a mother of twins! Sweet!\" Then the doctor gave her a picture and she headed to our home. I was sick with the flu and a cold, so I laid weakly on the couch. I turned on a news channel and the reporter said, \"Flu's and cold's going around here in Denver and there's some people missing events because of this.\" I scoffed and groaned, \"No kidding!\" Venna rushed in smiling. \"Hi. What'd he say?\" Venna squealed happily and said, \"It's a girl-.\" I said, \"Yay!\" She continued smiling and said, \"And a boy! We're having twins!\" I looked astonished and I said, \"Twins?! Sweet!\" I kept coughing and sneezing all day. It's driving me nuts. I couldn't believe I'm going to be a father of twins! Girl and a boy! I'm going to make sure no one hurts my kids. 4 months later, Venna had the twins. I chose the boy's name, Nick, and Venna chose the girl's name, Alaina. I held Nick in my arms and rocked him gently, while Venna did the same thing with Alaina. Fuller came in and said in a high-pitched voice, \"Look at the little babies.\" I laughed and Nick started smiling. Fuller said, \"What are their names?\" I said, \"Nick is the boy. Alaina is the girl. Fuller said, \"Cute names. Hopefully someday I'll have kids of my own.\" Venna said, \"Oh yeah?\" I kissed Nick's head and I kissed Alaina's head. I said, \"We did great, didn't we?\" Venna laughed and said, \"Yeah. We did.\" Fuller said, \"Do you promise me you'd take care of these beauties?\" I said, \"Bro, they're my kids. I have to do what's best for them.\" Venna said, \"Okay, switch kids.\" She gave me Alaina and I gave her Nick. \"They are very quiet kids. That's not a problem,\" Venna explained. Then we all smiled dearly at the babies. It was a day when Venna and I worked longer hours today. We both work at the same place, which is the nearby hospital. We got a babysitter to watch the twins. We couldn't have Fuller because he was working at the nearby bar. Really dumb occupation. The babysitter was so great; she would do anything. Now that we know that Rusty Nail is gone, we don't have to worry about him hurting our kids. Once we were done working, we headed home, hoping everything was alright. I entered the house first, finding nobody. I said, \"Hello?\" No answer. Venna said, \"Her car's here. And she's not outside. Where could she be?\" We walked around our house. No sight. I finally went into the twins' room, and I couldn't believe I found a pile of blood gushing from under Alaina's crib. I was brave enough to look under there, and I found a note, at first. I wonder where the blood was coming from. I read the note, \"Hey Lewis! Look under Alaina's mattress!\" I lifted up the mattress and I saw another note, and the babysitter! She was murdered! I screamed and Venna ran up to me and started crying, \"Oh my god! She's dead!\" I read the second note, \"Hey Lewis and Venna, enjoying the first 4 weeks of having kids? Well, now they're with me! I kidnapped them, and you'll never be able to find them! Signed, Rusty Nail.\" Venna said, \"He has our kids! We have to get them back!\" I said, \"Get in the car. I have to get something.\" I found another note and I read it, \"Meet me at the next town. Boulder, room 17. Do not hesitate if you want to see your kids.\" I ran to the car and Venna asked, \"Where are we going?!\" I replied, \"Boulder.\" Then we drove off. The C.B radio was on, and Rusty Nail talked to us in it. He said, \"I know you thought I was dead. But really, nothing stops me. I knew where you lived and yes, I was getting revenge. Your kids are quiet, and I wonder why.\" I finally answered back, \"Hey, you didn't kill them, right?!\" He chuckled and said, \"Oh no, Lewis. They're still here. I'll give you proof.\" Then I heard Alaina cry and Venna said, \"Oh god! We have to get there!\" Rusty Nail said, \"What a cute kid. Alaina looks just like you, Lewis. And your little boy, goodness, he looks just like you, Venna. No doubt about it. If I kidnapped them, it's like kidnapping YOU.\" I eventually started crying and then we arrived in Boulder, but which hotel? I said, \"Okay. He has a black semi. Where could he be?\" We searched and Venna said, \"Over there!\" I turned right and sped to that hotel. It was his semi. We rushed out of the car and ran to room 17. I knocked loudly and nobody answered. I opened the door. There stood Rusty Nail, holding Nick. Nick was crying and I said, \"Give us the twins.\" Rusty Nail shook his head and said, \"I wonder why he's crying.\" He turned him around and there was a cut on his arm. A HUGE cut, like with a knife! Venna screamed, \"No! You stabbed him! Oh my god!\" He chuckled and he set Nick in his crib. I said, \"Why did you cut him?\" Rusty Nail held up a gun and he said, \"Go to the back! Outside! Now!\" We ran outside and we waited outside. Rusty Nail ran out to his semi and started it up. We heard police sirens and I swear, I wanted to scream. We heard cops opening doors and yelling, \"Get on the ground, show me your hands!\" Rusty Nail was driving towards us and a cop came out to us. He said, \"What's going on here?!\" I said, \"Shoot the truck! He's trying to kill us! He kidnapped our kids in room 18! Go save them!\" The cop ran to grab our kids and another group of cops came out and shot the truck. The truck stopped and I ran to him. Rusty Nail was finally dead. Thank God! I ran out to Venna and said, \"He's dead! He's dead!\" She smiled and sighed with relief. Two cops came out, holding our twins. The one holding Nick said, \"I bandaged him up.\" I smiled and the cops gave them to us. Thank God they're okay! Alaina had dirt and scratches on her face, while Nick had that huge cut and a bloody nose. Venna said, \"We have to make sure that they are okay. From now on, we're going to make sure that Rusty Nail doesn't take them again.\" I smiled at her pretty face and I kissed her. I knew life from now on will be fun, now that I have a family, and Rusty Nail is dead. This time, I actually got proof that he was dead.

Their parents separated because their dad, Clint Collins, beat up his sons really bad and Courtney wanted them to not be by him. At their house, Dylan was playing outside with Zach. They were in their trunks and playing with water guns and the hose. Then while Dylan was aiming the hose at Zach, he saw a ghost and he stared at it and Zach was laughing and firing the guns in Dylan's face. He didn't react and Zach stopped his nonsense and asked, \"What's wrong, bro? You wouldn't even react to my guns!\" Dylan said, \"I saw a ghost. And I'm not kidding. He had a gray face with scars and he was smiling at me. It was creepy.\" Then, Courtney came out and said, \"Boys, please come in and get dinner.\" Zach said, \"Okay. One second.\" Courtney smiled dearly at her sons and walked back inside. Dylan shook his head and whispered, \"I'm crazy.\" The twins walked inside and ate dinner their mother. Later that night, while Zach was getting put to sleep, he told Courtney, \"Mom… I'm worried about Dylan. He's been seeing things all week. He said that he's seeing ghosts and dead people. It's starting to get scary and I'm worried.\" Courtney kissed her son's cheek and said, \"Baby, you can help your brother. That's the point of twins. You help each other out. Try to keep him focused on what he's doing.\" Zach felt tears spill out of his eyes and Courtney rubbed his head and said, \"Zach, don't cry.\" Zach choked, \"Mom, I'm sorry. I wished you'd get married again and have more sons so I can be a good brother and not teach just one person. I want to teach more.\" He started sobbing and was wiping his tears. Courtney said, \"I'll try.\" Zach asked, \"Really?\" Courtney smiled and nodded. He finally fell asleep and she left his room. A couple hours later that night, Dylan woke up and spotted a ghost kid named Milo. Dylan said, \"Milo, hi.\" Milo chuckled and said, \"Dylan, you have to come see this. It's awesome.\" Dylan took his hand and Milo transported them to Dylan's basement. Milo smiled and said, \"Ted, Peter, Catherine. Show yourselves.\" Ted appeared and said, \"Watch mine first, Dylan. It'll be a memory.\" Dylan's body shook and he shakily grabbed his film and started watching it. The film was showing a family of 5 on a fishing trip. \"When's the bad part?\" Dylan asked. Ted said, \"Now.\" Then the film showed 4 family members hanging upside down and shocker, an alligator jumped up and bit their heads off like bait. Dylan turned away and said, \"Milo, stop! It's nasty!\" Milo and Ted put their fingers against their mouths and said, \"Shhhhh.\" Dylan ran up to his room and covered himself up. While Dylan was asleep, he was dreaming of killing his family and becoming Milo and Ted. It scared him so much that he was screaming and wailing so loud, that Zach woke up and ran to Dylan. Zach shook Dylan and kept shouting, \"Dylan! Stop! It's me Zach! Stop!\" Finally, he woke up, his face all wet and red. Zach rubbed Dylan's head and said, \"I'm here, Dylan. Nothing will hurt you.\" The brothers hugged each other and Dylan said, \"I love you, Zach.\" Zach said, \"Love you too, Dylan.\" The next morning, Dylan was going on a walk to clear his head about last night. While walking, he saw a girl sitting under a tree, crying. He stopped and went over to her. She looked at him and he said, \"Hi. Are you okay? I saw you crying.\" The girl smiled and choked, \"How nice of you. (Sniffs) My family was murdered a couple months ago (sniffs) and I cry about it every day.\" Dylan looked at her and asked, \"Who do you live with?\" The girl said, \"This tree. I live here.\" Dylan said, \"Well, I'm Dylan. I live in a white house down the road.\" The girl replied, \"I'm Emma. Nice to meet you.\" Her hair covered her face and Dylan said, \"Mind if I pull your hair back to see what you look like?\" Emma shook her head and Dylan brushed her hair out of her face. The conclusion of Emma was a very beautiful girl. Dylan looked in love at her and said, \"Whoa…\" Emma smiled and said, \"Well, catch me later. I'll be here.\" Dylan laughed and got up and waved happily at her. She waved back and Dylan walked back home. When he walked through his lawn, he noticed Zach talking to Clint. Wait… Clint? Dylan walked up to them and Clint said, \"Hi Dylan.\" Dylan smiled and hugged his dad. He said, \"Hi Daddy.\" Zach said, \"How far did you walk, brother?\" Dylan answered, \"Not far. I met this beautiful girl named Emma. Sad thing, she lives on a tree. No shelter or family. I… kind of love her.\" Clint said, \"Love? You have a crush now?\" Dylan nodded and Clint said, \"Is this Emma pretty?\" Dylan said, \"Totally. She has these gorgeous brown eyes.\" Clint smiled and walked inside and Zach said, \"He's going to talk to Mom. They might get back together. Isn't that great?!\" Dylan smiled and said, \"Yeah! It'll be great!\" Then the brothers laughed and ran inside. Later that night, Clint and Courtney made up and the twins were so excited. Clint stayed in the house for a while until they moved. That whole day, Dylan's mind was set on Emma. \"Man, she's hot,\" Dylan kept thinking. While getting in bed, Dylan told Zach, \"Bro, do you ever think you'll ever have a crush?\" Zach thought, smiled, and said, \"Yeah. I bet she's a hot one.\" Dylan laughed and said, \"Goodnight Zach.\" Zach said, \"Goodnight Dylan.\" Then the twins shut their doors and laid in their beds. 2 hours later, Milo came back to Dylan and said, \"Good morning, Dylan.\" Dylan woke up and said, \"Milo, please. I want to sleep.\" Milo chuckled and said, \"Hey. You'll love this one. I know how much you love that girl, Emma. You'll probably love this as much as her.\" Dylan got up and said, \"Come on.\" Milo smiled and followed him down to the basement. In the basement, there laid a film named \"Christmas Morning\". Dylan asked Milo, \"Who made this one?\" Milo smiled and played the disc. There was a family of 5 on Christmas opening presents and playing with their gifts. Dylan said, \" Who made this?\" Milo and Ted ignored him and then there was a part showing night time in the snow. Then there was a shovel of snow and that snow covered 4 bodies, in no warm clothing. The 4 got so cold and Dylan said nervously, \"Oh my god.\" Milo and Ted laughed and the 4 humans were now frozen to death. Dylan ran upstairs to his room crying and he whispered to himself, \"Calm down, Dylan. But… who made the freakin' film?!\" The next morning, Dylan and Zach both wanted to go on a walk. While walking, Zach said, \"You know, I've been getting bad dreams at night. Like, about murder scenes.\" Dylan said, \"So have I. I can even see dead kids. You know Milo and Ted?\" Zach said, \"Yeah. I have watched two films about one of those kids killing their families. I watched one about fishing and one about Christmas. Ted did the fishing one. It was sick. I don't know who made the Christmas one. Do you?\" Dylan said, \"No. Milo or Ted won't tell me. I will never be like them.\" Zach said, \"Same.\" The brothers then ran into pretty Emma. Dylan smiled and Emma said, \"Oh, hi Dylan.\" Dylan said, \"Hi Emma. This is my twin, Zach.\" Zach smiled and said, \"Hey.\" Emma smiled and she said, \"What's up?\" Dylan said, \"Oh nothing. My mom and dad got back together.\" Emma said, \"Nice. Like I said, I don't have a family.\" Dylan slowly walked up to Emma, put his forehead against hers, and whispered, \"You, Emma, are one of the prettiest girls I've ever seen. Now, I use to not be cute because I got beat up real bad. But if you do think I'm cute, you'd have to come chase me and Zach.\" He backed away and Zach said, \"Wow. I never knew you were romantic.\" Dylan said, \"I got my moments. Now, RUN!\" Emma chased the twins all over the place. For 1 hour, they kept chasing each other. When the kids were tired, they sat under a tree. Zach said, \"God that was fun!\" Emma said, \"No kidding. I probably lost a lot of pounds there.\" They all laughed and Dylan said, \"Now I know what game we're all good at.\" Zach smiled and said, \"Hey, you know what I think you two should do?\" Emma asked, \"What?\" Zach said, \"Kiss.\" They looked at him and Dylan said, \"Are you crazy?! I'll get killed!\" Zach said, \"Here, let me help you.\" He grabbed their heads and put them together and Dylan and Emma kissed. Zach said, \"There you go.\" When they were done, Dylan said, \"I kissed a girl.\" Emma smiled and the twins left. While they were walking, Emma's face turned like a ghost kid and she smirked. She said evilly, \"Bughuul, you got your wish. He'll be us now.\" At dinner, Dylan was thinking about his first kiss with Emma. Courtney asked, \"Dylan, what are you thinking about, baby?\" Dylan didn't hear her and he kept smiling dreamily. Clint said, \"Dylan? Hello? Your mom's talking to you.\" Dylan said, \"Wait, what'd you say, Mom? Sorry.\" Courtney said, \"I said, what are you thinking about?\" Dylan said, \"Oh, nothing. Just daydreaming.\" Courtney looked confused and said, \"Yeah, about what?\" Dylan saw something at the door. He stared at it, and it was Bughuul. Dylan panicked and got up from the table. Clint said, \"Dylan, what is going on?\" Dylan said, \"Sorry, I just saw something.\" Zach said, \"Dylan and Emma kissed today.\" Dylan shouted, \"Zach!\" His parents looked puzzled and Dylan ran upstairs crying. Courtney asked, \"Is that true, Zach?\" Zach said, \"Yes! I saw them doing it.\" His parents went upstairs to Dylan and Zach kind of sat there feeling guilty. Dylan sat on his bed, seeing the ghost kids, besides Emma, saying, \"Shhhhh.\" When they heard a knock on the door, the ghost kids disappeared and Dylan's parents came in his room. Clint said, \"Hey, buddy. What was going on down there?\" Dylan saw Bughuul standing in front of him and Dylan was breathing hard. He said, \"Why would Zach let me down like that?\" Courtney said, \"Dylan, listen. Zach just told the truth, you wouldn't. So he really didn't let you down.\" Clint said, \"Now, did you kiss Emma?\" Dylan felt tears burning down his face. He said, \"I'm sorry. I just really liked her. She was pretty, funny, and nice.\" Courtney smiled and said, \"Dylan, that's fine. Your first kiss, baby.\" Dylan smiled and Clint said, \"Don't be upset, son. Everyone has a first kiss.\" They hugged their son and went back downstairs. Later that night, Dylan was having bad dreams that forced him to go back down to the basement. He saw Bughuul, Peter, Milo, and Ted by the super 8 film. It was Peter's film \"Kitchen Remodel\" that was already playing. It was a family of 4 painting, cleaning, and furnishing their kitchen. Dylan said, \"What the heck?\" Peter said, \"What? I love this one.\" Then, 3 family members were hanging by wires. The kitchen was flooded by sink water and the 3 family members were sitting in the water. Then, Peter took an electrical wire and threw it in the water and the 3 were shocked to death. Burns all over their arms. Dylan shook his head and told all of them, \"Sick. Milo, play yours.\" Milo smiled and asked, \"Really?!\" Dylan nodded and Milo grabbed his tape and played it on the camera. The film played families at a Sunday service at church. Praying, singing, eating bread, and drinking wine. Dylan said, \"Seriously? At church?\" Milo said, \"Watch.\" Then the film showed 5 bodies on the floor, nailed to the floor, heads covered up. Milo smiled and then the film played rats going under pots on the victims. Then, Milo placed hot coal on the pots and to kill them, the rats dug through the victims' bodies and they died. Bughuul put his hand on Milo and Dylan said, \"I can do better.\" Zach came downstairs and said, \"Dylan?\" Dylan looked at his brother and said, \"Yes?\" Zach said, \"Don't trust or be like them. You're a good boy.\" Dylan scoffed and said, \"Oh yeah? Who's going to stop me? I wanna be like them. Catherine, show yours.\" Zach said, \"Dylan… don't!\" Dylan shouted, \"Go away!\" Zach ran upstairs and Catherine's film \"Dentist Appointment\" showed 3 family members' mouths forced open getting their teeth mutilated out. Dylan laughed and said, \"My film is going to be the best.\" The next morning, a deputy came to the Collins' house. He knew so much about Bughuul and all the murders he made kids do. He knocked on their door and Courtney answered. The deputy said, \"Uh, hi. May I come in?\" Courtney said, \"Name or job please.\" \"Private investigator. I study all crime scenes and so much more. Can I come in?\" Courtney let him in and they sat at the table. Deputy said, \"Okay. I was told nobody really comes out here. So, may I ask if you have seen anything on your property like this?\" He showed her pictures of Bughuul's sign and she said, \"No. Let me check with my husband. Clint!\" Clint came to her and said, \"Yeah? Who's this guy?\" Courtney said, \"He's a private investigator. Now, have you seen anything like that?\" He looked at the pictures and shook his head. \"Let's ask the boys. Boys!\" The twins came down and Courtney said, \"Boys, this man is a private investigator and he wants you to look at these pictures.\" They looked at the pictures and Dylan's eyes opened wide. Zach said, \"No.\" Deputy said, \"What about him?\" Dylan looked at him and said, \"N-n-no.\" Dylan started shaking and Deputy said, \"Okay. I need to talk to all of you. Have you ever heard about the book writer, Ellison Oswalt?\" Only Courtney and Clint nodded, while he boys shook their heads. Deputy said, \"Well, he was studying on these crime scenes that happened long ago. It was about these kids filming them killing their families. Then, once he died, the spree just kept going. You, the church and all, I'm pretty sure they're related. I met this guy, Professor Jonas, and he told me that these kids were being forced to do these murders by a demon named Bughuul. So, please be careful.\" Dylan lost it, he ran upstairs and locked himself in his room. Courtney said, \"Thank you so much. We'll be aware.\" Deputy said, \"Do you mind if I come back later tonight?\" Clint said, \"No, but do not do anything stupid around here.\" Zach said, \"Hey, why'd Dylan go up there? He's weird.\" Finally, the deputy left. In his room, Dylan was lying on his bed. The ghost kids, besides Emma, sat by him. Milo said, \"I think you should film that tonight. Be like us.\" Catherine said, \"You could make him so proud.\" Dylan said, \"What about Zach? Don't you want to try him out first?\" Ted said, \"Yeah, why not? We'll go to you if he denies it.\" Peter said, \"Ta-ta Dylan.\" Then they disappeared, leaving Dylan hoping to make a choice of goodness. Outside, Zach was sitting on the porch. Then the ghost kids sat next to him. Zach said, \"Milo?\" Milo smiled and said, \"Hi Zach. Let's see if you're gonna be like us.\" Zach said, \"No!\" Catherine said, \"Let's go watch my last film. You'll like it.\" Ted said, \"Bughuul will love to have you as one of us.\" Zach said, \"No! I wanna be good!\" Then he ran off to the church. He saw Bughuul and he hid under a table. He started crying and whispered, \"Please God.\" He thought he was safe, so he stood up. The kids were behind him and Emma said, \"Last chance to watch the last film. Dylan already watched it and he liked it.\" Zach looked at them and said, \"Guys, stop. Us Collins' were not born to be like you. Even Dylan was born to be good! He's my twin. I'll never be like you.\" Milo said, \"Oh yeah? Well, Emma kissed him and she's the one who made the Christmas one. Since Dylan kissed a ghost kid, he's got a chance.\" Zach said, \"Emma… made… a film?\" Emma said, \"Sure did, Zach. I loved it so much!\" Then they all disappeared and Zach immediately ran back to his home. When he ran inside, he saw the ghost kids heading to Dylan's room. Ach said, \"No.\" He ran upstairs and into Dylan's room. Dylan was looking at the ghost kids. Dylan said, \"Emma?\" Emma said, \"Hi Dylan. Enjoy my film on Christmas?\" Dylan nodded and Zach said, \"No, he didn't!\" Dylan stood up and said, \"Zach, I have made a decision! I want to be like them!\" Zach stood in front of Dylan and took his hand. He said, \"Dylan, listen to me. I know you. You are that kid who obeys people. You are that kid who does the right thing. You are that kid who's generous and gets good grades. You are that kid that dreams. Most of all, you are that kid that's a Collins and my twin brother. I don't want that Dylan Collins to change. I love him.\" Hearing those words made Dylan cry. Catherine said, \"Don't listen to him, Dylan. We are your friends. Inside and out.\" Dylan wiped his eyes and said, \"I'll think about it. I'll say about 50/50.\" Emma said, \"Dylan, don't you love me, too? We kissed remember?\" Dylan looked at them and said, \"I love every one of you. You're my partners in crime. I… just don't know who to trust. I love my twin.\" Zach smiled and the ghost kids angrily disappeared. Dylan looked at Zach and said, \"It's 50/50.\" Zach patted his back and they went outside to play. While their parents were asleep, the brothers snuck downstairs and saw something on the table. Dylan asked, \"What is that?\" Zach picked up the thing and said, \"It's a type of medicine. To stop yourself from doing something forever. I bet the deputy dropped it off.\" Dylan said, \"I hate taking medicine.\" Zach said, \"Me too. I gotta use the bathroom. Please don't go yet.\" Zach set down the medicine and went to the bathroom. When Dylan turned around, Emma stood there and Dylan gasped. She grabbed his face and they kissed, again. Dylan tried to make it stop, but once Emma heard Zach, she disappeared. Dylan was feeling his body shake in fear and Zach said, \"Dylan…\" Dylan turned around and smiled at him. Zach looked confused and said, \"Come on. Let's go to bed.\" Zach went first and Dylan followed him, ready to be like Milo. While sleeping, Dylan was dreaming of killing his family, but this time, he liked it. The next afternoon, while eating lunch outside, Dylan hid in the nearby field and filmed his family with the camera. The ghost kids were there with him. Milo smiled and said, \"Make him proud.\" Then Dylan smiled and he ran to the side so they didn't know where he came from. He poured some drinks for his family and after that, he went back to keep filming it. Peter said, \"Dylan, make the best one.\" Dylan said, \"Oh, I will.\" Zach felt a tingle telling him that the ghost kids were nearby, but he ignored it. Dylan said, \"Yeah, you ignore that tingle, Zach. I'm going with the bad 50 side. I'm like them.\" The kids smiled at him evilly. Later that night, Deputy came back and the Collins never answered. \"Where are they?!\" He asked himself. At the heart of the field, Dylan hung Zach, Clint, and Courtney like scarecrows. He laughed at them and walked closer to them. Dylan said, \"I went bad for good.\" He walked backwards leaving his family screaming his name and help. Dylan held up the camera and started filming them. He held up a fire starter and lit it and dropped it on a trail of gas that lead to where Clint was hung. The fire then trailed up to Clint and he was on fire. Dylan smiled, watching Clint scream and burn to death. Deputy looked around and saw flames in the sky and he said, \"Oh my god.\" He ran inside their house and said, \"Medicine!\" He grabbed the medicine on the table and got in his car and drove towards the flames. Dylan shouted, \"Burn! Burn alive, Daddy!\" Then he held up the fire starter and tried to fire up Zach, but Deputy's car ran over Dylan. Dylan dropped everything and he laid there moving weakly. Zach and Courtney were still screaming and Deputy went to Courtney and said, \"It's me! Hold still!\" He unhung her and he went to Zach and unhung him. Dylan stood up with the camera and said, \"Idiots! You can't stop me!\" Zach said, \"Dylan, please!\" Courtney was crying and she said, \"Baby, no!\" Deputy filled up a shot of that medicine and threw it and it landed on Dylan's chest. Dylan dropped everything and screamed, \"Owww!\" He fell down and he laid there not moving at all. Zach said, \"Dylan?!\" Courtney said, \"Is he okay?\" Deputy said, \"I don't know. That should stop him though.\" Dylan was not breathing; he was laying there. Dead (I think). Zach ran over to him and felt him not breathing. He was crying and put his head on his back. Courtney whispered while crying, \"No. Not my baby.\" Zach said, \"Why, Dylan? Why did you have to die?!\" Deputy said, \"Oh my god. I killed him!\" Courtney grabbed the medicine and she said, \"He's severely allergic to this stuff! Of course he's dead!\" The ghost kids appeared and looked at Dylan and Zach. Milo said, \"Bughuul…\" Bughuul appeared and he flared out his arms and then Dylan started floating. Courtney looked astonished at him and said, \"Zach! Grab him!\" Zach tried to battle Bughuul, but then Zach was pushed really hard and he got a concussion. Zach stood up weakly and he grabbed the medicine and threw it at the ghost kids and Bughuul. They all disappeared and Dylan landed hardly on the ground. He still would not wake up. Then a girl neighbor (Dylan's age) came by and said, \"Oh my goodness!\" Courtney said, \"Kira! Please go call the ambulance!\" Kira looked down and grabbed her phone and called 911. When she hung up she looked at Dylan and said, \"Dylan? His he dead?\" Courtney nodded and Kira went and sat next to him. Zach looked at her with a red and wet face and whispered, \"Help… him.\" Kira looked at Dylan's handsome face and she smiled. Kira said, \"You know, I've always had a crush on Dylan. I liked him. I've always wanted to do this.\" She bent lower to Dylan and kissed him for 10 seconds. Deputy said, \"I think that should work.\" Then Dylan started breathing and his eyes opened slowly. Everyone smiled at him and he said nervously, \"Why is daddy burning?\" Zach said, \"You became Milo and you burned him. Now, they'll leave us alone.\" Dylan smiled and said, \"Hi Kira. What's up?\" She smiled and said, \"I saved you.\" Dylan asked, \"How?\" Kira giggled and she kissed Dylan again. Dylan said, \"Okay. I see your point.\" They all laughed and now none of the Collins will be evil, especially the twins and Clint (because he's dead).

He chuckles. \"What's so funny?\" you manage to say. \"I can hear my mother talking about the wedding outside.\" \"What wedding?\" \"Ours.\" He catches you by surprise. You never expected to get married, especially with him. You start to feel dizzy and topple over. This time you are sure you can hear wedding bells, tears of joy, and gasps of amazement. You go back in time in your dream, and there are women all over you, taking measurements and writing them down. You wake up from the dream, not sure whether it was real or not. You get lifted to your feet and it is just like the dream. All people taking measurements and writing them down, rushing in and out of the tent, carrying white fabrics and sewing them together. You feel yourself being walked over to a sink and sat down in a chair, water rushing through your long brown hair. You can feel them lifting it out of the sink and drying it. While sitting down, they take turns in putting white, high-heeled shoes on your feet, seeing which one fit perfectly. You suddenly come to realise that Atreyu is not in the room. You ask where he is and they say he is being fitted for his suit in the next tent. Suit? You begin to wonder what this is all for. Then you remember the conversation you had with Atreyu, a few moments before you blacked out again. Flashback Atreyu chuckles. \"What's so funny?\" you manage to say. \"I can hear my mother talking about the wedding outside.\" \"What wedding?\" \"Ours\" End Flashback It all comes rushing back to you. You and Atreyu are getting married and you blush at the thought. You fit into the dress perfectly and the shoes are perfect also. You get walked out of the tent into a large crowd of people all looking fancy and dressed up for your wedding. At the end of the rows you see a young man, dressed in his best, looking at you. It is Atreyu. You begin walking down the aisle, in tune with the music. You reach the end of it and stand next to Atreyu, who looks at you in awe. \"You're beautiful.\" He says looking at you. You both turn to the priest and he begins the wedding. \"Do you, Atreyu, of the Plains People, take this woman to be your humble wife through eternity?\" says the priest turning to Atreyu. \"I do.\" \"And do you; take Atreyu to be your loving husband through eternity?\" You look at Atreyu and can't help looking into his chocolate-brown eyes. \"I do.\" \"I then pronounce you as husband and wife. You may kiss the bride.\" You turn to Atreyu, and he does the same to you. He lifts your veil and kisses you. Everyone in the crowd cheers, and claps, and cries. You both blush and he lifts you up in his arms, as if you weigh nothing. He carries you down the aisle and takes you into his tent. He drops you onto his bed. He then climbs on top of you and begins to kiss you passionately. The rest is a blur of wonderment, excitement and wonderful feelings.

Er hatte seinen Raub auf 22 Uhr angesetzt. Polizeikommissar Nakamori, der vor Jahren die Leitung über die KID-Fälle übernommen hatte, schrie seine Leute an, alle Eingänge zu bewachen. Er würde nicht zulassen, dass ihm der Dieb erneut entkam. Er hatte für alles vorgesorgt, jedes noch so kleine Schlupfloch gestopft und war für alles bereit. Seine Tochter würde stolz auf ihn sein, wo sie doch so oft daran zweifelte, dass er es jemals schaffen würde. Ein 17-Jähriger Junge, mit marineblauen Augen beobachtete ihn lächelnd, von der Eingangshalle aus. Der Polizeikommissar hatte ja keine Ahnung. Er konzentrierte sich nur auf die Eingänge, obwohl der gesuchte Dieb schon längst drinnen war. Da wäre es ein leichtes den Edelstein zu stehlen. Er zog sich zurück und schlich leise zum Zentrum, des Museums, wo \"Blood-Eye\" auf einem Podest lag. Nur wenige Polizeioffiziere waren hier. Fünf an der Zahl. Sie bemerkten ihn garnicht, sondern hatten die Blicke auf die Decke gerichtet. Wie nachlässig von ihnen! dachte der Teenager zufrieden und nahm zwei Kugeln aus seiner Jackentasche. Sie waren mit Schlafgas gefüllt und dafür bestimmt die Wachen auszuschalten. Vorsichtig rollte er je eine nach rechts und nach links. Drei Sekunden hatte er, bevor sie ihren Inhalt verströmten. Genau um 22 Uhr, wie er es berechnet hatte, schliefen die Wachen ein und er konnte sich dem Podest nähern. Nurnoch eine dünne Schicht aus Glas trennte ihn von seiner Beute, die er mithilfe eines seiner vielen Werkzeuge zersplittern ließ. Nun lag er vor ihm, der Rubin, der über eine Millionen Yen wert war. Mit einem Grinsen auf dem Gesicht nahm er ihn, steckte ihn ein und machte sich auf den Weg nach draußen. Es war eigentlich ziemlich glatt gelaufen. Er war hereingekommen, ohne aufzufallen, hatte sich den Stein geschnappt und musste nicht einmal einen seiner Tricks verwenden. Es war schon schade, denn er hatte sich ein paar neue ausgedacht, um seine Fans zu begeistern. Vielleicht sollte er seine Tarnung draußen aufgeben, schließlich warteten sie auf ihn, aber er hatte heute noch etwas vor und keine Lust wieder die ganze Nacht von Polizeisirenen gestört zu werden. Erwartungsvolle \"KID\"-Schreie erwarteten ihn, vor dem Eingang. Die Menge wurde ungeduldig, weil das Spektakel noch nicht begonnen hatte, obwohl der angesagte Zeitpunkt längst überschritten worden war. Vielleicht sollte er sich doch zeigen. Zumindest einen kleinen Augenblick. Er war ein Magier, der sein Puplikum unterhalten musste, sonst erledigte er seinen Job nicht richtig und das würde er sich nie verzeihen. Lächelnd entledigte er sich seiner Verkleidung und nahm eine Rauchbombe in die Hand. Nur kurz. Er musste sich nur kurz zeigen, dann konnte er verschwinden. Er sprintete durch die Glastür, die splitternd zerbrach, nach draußen. Ein Schnippen mit den Fingern genügte, um alle Scheinwerfer auf ihn zu richten und seinen weißen Anzug, wie Schnee im Sonnenlicht, leuchten zu lassen. Die Menge jubelte begeistert. Ihr Meistermagier war aufgetaucht und wie es schien, hatte er seine Magie bereits wirken lassen und seine Beute eingesackt. \"Da bist du ja KID!\" ließ sich Nakamori vernehmen \"Los! Schnappt ihn euch!\" Der Magier zischte missbilligend. Der Polizeikommissar ließ ihn nicht einmal seine Show machen. Er hatte keinen seiner Sätze sagen können, um seine Zuschauer zu verzaubern. Dann eben nicht. Er war selbst schuld. Die Leute würden sich bei ihm beschweren und nicht bei dem Phantomdieb. Bevor die Offiziere ihn erreichen konnten, warf er seine Rauchbombe auf den Boden und machte sich ungesehen aus dem Staub. Es gab dort nichts weiteres für ihn zu tun. Flink rannte er durch die Straßen. Das war bereits Gewohnheit für ihn und er kannte die besten Routen, um schnell von einem Ort, zu einem Anderen zu kommen. Das musste er auch, sonst wäre seine Karriere als Phantomdieb schnell vorbei und er im Gefängnis. Seine KID-Kleidung war er in einer Seitenstraße losgeworden. Sie wäre viel zu auffällig gewesen, wenn er sie bis nach Hause getragen hätte und jeder Polizist, in ganz Tokyo wäre hinter ihm hergewesen. Das hätte sein Vorankommen nur unnötig erschwert. Um die nächste Ecke biegend holte er seine Beute aus der Tasche. Er wollte nachschauen, ob es der gesuchte Edelstein Pandora war, weswegen er überhaupt diese Raubzüge beging. Gespannt hielt er ihn nach oben, vor den Mond... und wurde enttäscht. Er war es nicht. Das hieß, er musste ihn, wie immer zurückschicken und nach dem nächsten Riesenedelstein Ausschau halten, so wie schon die etlichen Male davor. Insgeheim fragte er sich, was er machen würde, wenn er ihn tatsächlich irgendwann fand. Er glaubte nicht, dass es ihm leicht fallen würde einfach aufzuhören Kaito KID zu sein. Und Nakamori-keibun würde wahrscheinlich schier verzweifeln, weil seine Beute ein zweites Mal ins Nichts verschwindet, wie schon acht Jahre zuvor. \"Hattest du diese Mal Glück?\" fragte eine bekannte Stimme, hinter ihm. Er drehte sich um. Dort stand, in schwarzer Hose und Hemd ein Junge, der genauso aussah, wie er selbst. Nur die Augen, die ein helles Himmelblau hatten, zeigten den Unterschied, zwischen den beiden Jungs. \"Leider nicht. Aber ich gebe nicht auf.\" antwortete der Magier bestimmt. Ein Lächeln breitete sich auf dem Gesicht des anderen aus. \"Und da will noch einer sagen ein Detektive wäre zielstrebig.\"[Chapter 2] Case 1: Der Alarm meines Weckers ließ mich aus dem Schlaf hochfahren. Schläfrig tastete ich nach dem Ausschaltknopf, während das schrille Piepsen Wellen des Schmerzes durch meinen Schädel sante. Es wurde Zeit, dass ich mir erwas anderes besorgte, um mich morgends zu wecken, doch das Problem war, dass ich nur dadurch dann wirklich aufstand. Als ich endlich die Folterqual ausgestellt hatte, zog ich mich langsam an und machte mich für die Schule fertig. Lieber würde ich mich jetzt in den Sessel in der Hauseigenen Bibliothek setzen und mich in einem Buch vertiefen. In meiner Hinsicht brachte das sowieso mehr, als acht Stunden, pro Tag, in einem stickigen Klassenzimmer, mit lauter nervenden Mitschülern zu sitzen und sich irgendwelches Zeug anzuhören, dass man schon kannte. Interessant wäre es ja, wenn wenigstens etwas neues drankommen würde, doch durch meinen großen Lesebedarf hatte ich das Meiste schon ein Jahr vorher gelernt, bevor wir überhaupt mit dem Thema anfingen. Außerdem war ich hundemüde. Es war noch eine Lange Nacht geworden, mit den ganzen Schreibaufgaben, die wir bekommen hatte. Ein weiterer sinnloser Aspekt von Schule. Meine Freundin Ran Mori, die Tochter des ehemaligen Polizeikommissar Kogoro Mori, der nun sein Leben als Detektiv ohne Aufträge fristete, war da anderer Meinung. Sie fand die Schule als wichtig, weil man so auch mal mit anderen Leuten Kontakt hatte. Es war ja nicht so, dass ich nie rauskam. Um genau zu sein tat ich das sogar ziemlich oft, um zum Beispiel der Polizei bei schwierigen Fällen zu helfen. Ich war nicht umsonst als der Oberschülerdetektiv Shinichi Kudo Repräsentant des östlichen Japans bekannt. Ich packte gerade meine restlichen Schulsachen in meine Tasche, als es klingelte. Nicht überrascht vermutete ich, dass es Ran wqr. Wir liefen jeden Tag zusammen zur Schule, da mein Haus auf ihrem Weg war. Sie kam immer zur selben Zeit, wobei ich manchmal viel zu früh vor der Tür stand und sie manchmal, so wie heute, klingeln musste um mich zu erinnern, dass ich spät dran war. Ich schnappte meine Tasche und machte mich auf. Wenn sie länger als eine Minute warten musste, konnte sie ziemlich unangenehm werden und da sie Kapitänin des Karateteams unserer Schule war, würde das für mich nicht gut enden. Sie nickte mir zu, als ich duch das Tor kam und wir liefen schweigend den langweiligsten Stunden des Tages entgegen. Ich sehnte mich jetzt schon nach dem Abend, bevor wir das Grundstück der Teitan Oberschule überhaupt betreten hatten. Wie sehr wünschte ich mir jetzt doch ein Buch her. In der ersten Stunde hatten wir Englisch. Ich sage nur \"Poor me!\". Der Unterricht war so langweilig, dass ich mich wunderte, dass ich nicht einschlief. Heute hatte ich sogar mal das Glück, dass unsere Lehrerin mich in Ruhe ließ. Nach der Schule rief ich bei Hattorie an. Er war der repräsentierende Oberschülerdetektiv des Westen Japans und lebte in Osaka. Ich hatte ihn kennengelernt, als er einmal nach Tokio gekommen war, weil sein Vater, der oberste Polizeikommissar von Osaka, zu einer geschäftlichen Feier eingeladen worden war. (Inspektor Megure hatte mich damals auch mitgenommen) Am Tag zuvor hatte er mich angerufen, um mich nach meinem Rat, bei einem bestimmten Fall, zu Fragen. Man hatte ihm angehört, dass es ihm schwer viel zuzugeben, dass er Hilfe brauchte. Es ging um einen Mordfall in einem der Außenbezierke von Osaka und es gab gewisse Verbindungen zu mehreren Raubzüge, die in Tokio stattgefunden hatte. Sofort meldete sich die typisch, genervte Stimme, mit Kansai-Dialekt. \"Was is' Kudo? Haste grad' nix andres vor, als mich zu störn?\" \"Sei mal nicht so abweisend, ich hab dir schließlich bei der Sache gestern geholfen.\" antwortete ich mahnend. Er grummelte missmutig, weil er wusste, dass ich recht hatte, auch wenn er das niemals offen zugeben würde. \"Also, wie ist gestern abgelaufen? Habt ihr den Täter geschnappt?\" Mit ein paar Sätzen erzählte er mir, was sich am Vortag abgespielt hatte, nachdem er meinen hilfreichen Tipp gehört hatte. Der Mörder, ein Mann mit dem Namen Katishino Yamamoto, der aus Tokio kam, hatte seinen Geschäftskollegen Iitime Uramu umgebracht, da dieser bei einem der Bankräube in Tokio gesehen worden war und die Polizei mit Phantombildern nach ihm suchte. Dabei hatte er den Fehler gemacht, selbst gesehen zu werden, wie er den Raum, kurz nach dem Mord verließ. Er war in einer abgelegenen Wohnung, in Osaka, gefunden und überführt worden. \"Mein Vater hat sofort ein Fax an die Polizeipräfektur in Tokio geschickt, um ihnen mitzuteilen, dass auch die Raubfälle gelöst sin'.\" endete er und versuchte dabei so wenig Kansai mit einzubringen, wie er konnte. Wahrscheinlich wollte er damit darauf hindeuten, dass er beides konnte und ich nicht. Leider hatte er damit absolut recht. \"Wie sieht's bei dir aus, Kudo? Ich hab' gehört Kaito KID soll wieder in Aktion getreten sein. Hast du endlich 'ne Spur wer er is'?\" Meine Hände verkrampften sich, doch ich sagte so lässig wie möglich: \"Nö, noch nicht. Aber ich konzentrier mich sowieso mehr auf andere Fälle. Inspektor Nakamori hat mich noch nicht um meine Hilfe gefragt und viele der Diebstähle passieren außerhalb von Beika.\" \"Was is' 'n mit dir los? Sonst lasste dich doch auch net bitten.\" In der Überraschung war er wieder zu Kansai gewechselt. \"Is' irgendwas vorgefallen, von dem ich nix weiß?\" Wenn du wüsstest... dachte ich schelmisch lächelndWenn irgendwer wüsste, was ich wusste, würde er aus dem Staunen nicht mehr herauskommen. \"Nichts Besonderes.\" Einen Moment war es in der Leitung still und ich fragte mich, ob Heiji aufgelegt hatte, dann hörte ich ein Knistern und das Geräusch eines Reißverschlusses. \"Was machst du, Hattori?\" fragte ich verwirrt. \"Ich pack meine Sachen.\" antwortete er \" Ich wollt' doch morgen nach Tokio kommen. Hab' jetzt aba entschieden das heut' schon zu machen. Wir haben sowieso hier in Osaka schon ab heut' Ferien.\" \"Warum das?\" fragte ich, so ruhig wie möglich und fing an, mich auf den Weg nach Hause zu machen. Das kam unerwartet. Wenn er jetzt, mit dem Zug, losfuhr, würde er in ein paar Stunden hier ankommen, und es gab noch etwas, dass ich unbedingt vorher erledigen musste. \"Wenn du dich nicht mit KID beschäftigen willst, muss ich das tun. Was bedeutet, dass ich direkt anfangen muss.\" erklärte er, während er in irgendetwas herumwühlte. \"Das verlangt meine Ehre als Detektiv!\" Oh je! dachte ich nur. Der meinte das ernst! Meine Schritte wurden schneller, bis mein Füße nur so über den Asphalt flogen. \"Du, Hattori, ich muss Schluss machen. Mir ist gerade etwas wichtiges eingefallen, dass ich machen muss.\" keuchte ich und legte auf, bevor er noch etwas erwiedern konnte. Ich erreichte mein Haus und schloss, mit einer fließenden Bewegung, das Tor auf, dass hinter mir mit einem Scheppern zufiel. Jetzt wusste bestimmt die ganze Nachbarschaft, dass ich da war. Es würde mich auch nicht wundern, wenn gleich der Professor von nebenan klingeln würde, um mir eine seiner neuen verrückten Erfingungen zu zeigen. Eigentlich mochte ich ihn, da ich ihn schon von Klein auf kannte, aber manchmal ging er mit seinen Ideen einfach zu weit. Ich sprintete die Treppe hoch, schmiss, in meinem Zimmer, meine Tasche auf das Bett und begann hektisch herumzusuchen. Doch ich fand nicht, was ich vor hatte zu finden. Es war wie, als wären die Sachen vom Erdboden verschluckt. Panik überkam mich. Hatte vielleicht irgendjemand in meiner Abwesenheit das Haus durchsucht und sie mitgenommen. Dann bemerkte ich den Zettel, auf dem Schreibtisch, darauf standen fünf Worte: Ich habe mich darum gekümmert! Erleichtert atmete ich auf. Später am Tag: \"Hier bin ich!\" rief Heiji von unten, während er sturmklingelte, als wäre das nicht schon genug. Meine Nachbarn dachten bestimmt, da wäre irgendein Verrückter unterwegs. Seufzend stieg ich die Treppen hinab, um ihm die Tür zu öffnen. Durch das Zauntor ging er wahrscheinlich gerade selbst, da musste ich ihn nicht hereinlassen. Er begrüßte mich, mit einem breiten Grinsen und seiner, wie üblich, geschulterten Baseballtasche. \"Na? Hab ich nich' gesagt, dass ich mich gleich auf den Weg mach'?\" fragte er gut gelaunt. Warum nochmal hatte ich ihn eingeladen über die Weihnachtsferien zu mir zu kommen? Ich wusste es nicht mehr. Konnte auch sein, dass er sich selbst eingeladen hatte. Jetzt hatte ich ihn zumindest an der Backe. \"Wo ist Kazuha?\" wollte ich wissen, als ich merkte, dass er alleine war. Sie war seine Freundin aus Kindertagen und ich hatte das Gefühl sie liebten sich, waren aber zu stolz, um es zuzugeben.Trotzdem gingen sie fast überall zusammen hin. Eigentlich war es die gleiche Situation, wie bei Ran und mir. \"Die hab' ich zu Ran geschickt. Hab' ihr gesagt, dass sie nich' dazu passt, wenn sich zwei Detektive unterhalten. Sie stört nur.\" erklärte er \"Sie kommt dann morgen vorbei.\" \"Ich glaube heute wäre dann auch ein wenig spät. Vergiss nicht. Wir haben schon 11 Uhr abends. Jetzt komm endlich rein. Ich will schlafen gehen. Anders als du hab ich nämlich morgen noch Schule.\" erinnerte ich ihn. \"Warum bist du überhaupt so gut gelaunt? Bist du nicht müde?\" \"Nein! Ich hab auf dem Weg hierher geschlafen, um fit zu sein, damit ich gleich anfangen kann nach KIDs Identität zu suchen.\" Ich führte ihn zu seinem Zimmer, wo er seine Tasche ablegte und sofort wieder hinaus stürmte. \"Ich muss gleich wieder los, zu dem Museum, dass KIDs letztes Ziel war.\" erklärte er \"Ich weiß nicht, wann ich zurückkomm, also lass am besten die Tür offen.\" \"Nimm doch einfach den Ersatzschlüssel mit.\" Schlug ich genervt vor \"Er hängt am Hutständer. Gute Nacht!\" Ich ließ ihn im Gang zurück und lief, mit schweren Schritten, die Treppe hoch. Zwei Nächte hintereinander kam ich nun schon spät ins Bett. Ich hoffte, das würde nicht zur Gewohnheit werden. Es war ja nicht so, dass ich lange schlafen musste. Im Gegenteil, ich brauchte nur ein paar Stunden, um wach zu sein, doch in den letzten Tagen war viel passiert, das mich erschöpft hatte. \"Warum ausgerechnet am Hutständer?\" rief Heiji zu mir hoch. Ich antwortete nicht. Sollte er es doch selbst herausfinden. Irgenwann hörte ich die Tür und wusste, dass er gegangen war.[Chapter 3] Case 2: Heiji weckte mich am nächsten Morgen, mit einem aufgeregten Ausdruck auf dem Gesicht. \"Rate mal, was ich heute Nacht noch heraus bekommen habe.\" grinste er selbstzufrieden und wedelte mit einem Stück Papier vor meiner Nase herum. \"Kaito KID hat den Stein schon zurück gegeben!\" \"Na und?\" stöhnte ich genervt, \"Das macht er doch jedes Mal! Was soll daran also so toll sein?\" Er lächelte wissend. \"Auf dem Rubin hat sich 'n wenig Stoff befunden. Nur 'n paar winzige Härchen, aber genug, um herauszufinden, aus welchem Stoff sein Anzug gemacht is'. Jetzt müssen wir nurnoch die Schneidereien befragen, an wen sie so einen weißen Stoff verkauft haben und der Kreis der Verdächtigen wird eingeschränkt.\" Das war eigentlich keine schlechte Schlussfolgerung, doch er hatte nicht mit einbezogen, dass KID seine Sachen auch durch eine andere Person bekommen könnte, die diesen Stoff kaufte. Außerdem war es ja nicht so, dass er sich immer wieder ein neues machte, sondern immer das gleiche Kostüm anzog. Heijis Sicherheit verschwand, nachdem er meine Einwände gehört hatte. \"Das stimmt. Dann muss ich wohl oder übel nochmal von vorne anfangen.\" meinte er enttäuscht. \"Aber jetzt brauch ich erst mal 'ne Ablenkung. Haste Lust in den Beika Park zu gehen?\" Ich schaute ihn überrascht an. \"Ich hab Schule. Ich kann nicht einfach durch die Gegend spazieren. Wenn dann musst du alleine gehen, oder mit Kazuha.\" \"Oh...\" machte er nur und ließ mich allein. Seufzend stand ich auf und machte mich für die Schule fertig. Warum war er überhaupt in mein Zimmer gekommen? Am Telefon hatte ich ihm erklärt, dass mein Zimmer für ihn tabu war. Es war erstaunlich, wie schnell er sich über diese Regel hinweg gesetzt hatte. Aber er war schließlich ein Detektiv. Und als solcher musste man so etwas machen, sonst könnte man niemals seine Fälle lösen. Das gleiche hatte auch Holmes immer gemacht, auch wenn es bei ihm immer so aussah, als würde er sich die Informationen auf dem rechten Weg beschaffen. Zusammen mit dem Detektiv des Westens verließ ich das Haus. Er hatte sich eine kleinere Tasche geschultert und war unten im Flur gestanden, sobald ich herunter gekommen war. \"Bestimmt geht Kazuha mit Ran mit in die Schule.\" Hatte er erklärt, \"Da wär's das beste, wenn ich auch mitgehe. Is' sowieso nur 'ne Weihnachtsfeier. Außerdem haben die Mädchen in deiner Klasse mal 'nen echten Detektiv verdient.\" Glaubst du. Hatte ich nur gedacht. Tatsächlich stand Ran heute mit Heijis Freundin vor dem Tor und winkte uns begeistert. Sie sah fröhlicher aus als sonst. Entweder sie freute sich darauf, dass ab heute Mittag Ferien sind, oder die Gesellschaft von Kazuha tat ihr gut. \"Und, wie war deine erste Nacht, Heiji?\" Rief die sofort. \"Aufschlussreich.\" Antwortete der nur. Er hatte gleich in seinen genervten Tonfall zurückgewechselt, denn er in ihrer Gegenwart immer anschlug, um sie auch kein bisschen denken zu lassen, dass er sie mögen könnte. \"Toll. Dann können wir heute ja alle Vier zusammen in die Schule gehen.\" Sagte Ran begeistert, nachdem der Detektiv seinen heutigen Plan erläutert hatte. Also ich fand das nicht so toll. Heiji würde in der Schule nur damit angeben, wie viele Fälle er schon gelöst hatte und behaupten, er wäre besser als ich, was garnicht stimmte. Wir waren mindestens gleich gut, wenn nicht, ich sogar noch besser. Aber bestimmt würde er das Gleiche sagen, wenn man ihn direkt darauf ansprach. Und genau deshalb mochte ich ihn so sehr. Er war mir in vielen Dingen ähnlich. (auch wenn ich kein Kansai sprach) Der Schulweg war heute mal kürzer als sonst. Hauptsächlich deswegen, weil wir uns die ganze Zeit über irgendwelche Fälle unterhielten, zu denen Kazuha und Ran Kommentare abgaben, welchen Eindruck sie davon gehabt hatten. Als die Teitan Oberschule dann vor uns lag, gab der Detektiv einen beeindruckten Pfiff von sich. \"Größer als ich erwartete hab'.\" Erklärte er und warf mir einen neckenden Blick zu, \"Auch wenn das ganze weiß sie 'n bisschen zu sauber ausseh'n lässt.\" \"Haha.\" Sagte ich sarkastisch. Das Klassenzimmer war bereits gefüllt mit Schülern. Wie erwartete hatten wir etwas die Zeit vergessen, als wir geredet hatten und jeden Augenblick sollte es klingeln. \"Hey, Mori und Kudo! Wen habt ihr denn da mitgebracht?\" Wollte einer meiner Mitschüler wissen, sobald wir hereinkamen, doch bevor ich sie vorstellen konnte, ergriff Kazuha selbst das Wort. \"Ich bin Kazuha und das ist Heiji Hattori. Wir sind Freunde, aus Osaka, die bei den beiden zu Besuch sind.\" \"Aus Osaka? Stimmt ja. Ich hab gehört die haben einen Tag früher keine Schule mehr, als wir.\" \"Hat sie Hattori gesagt? Ist das nicht der Name des obersten Polizeidirektors von Osaka?\" \"Das ist Kudos Rivale aus dem Westen! Heiji Hattori! Ich wusste garnicht, dass die beiden befreundet sind.\" Leises Gemurmel drang an meine Ohren, erstarb aber wieder, als unsere Lehrerin den Raum betrat. Der letzte Schultag dieses Jahres war eigentlich genauso, wie jeder andere, mit der Ausnahme, dass uns die Lehrer eine Kleinigkeit schenkten und wir nur sechs, statt den normalen acht, Stunden hatten. Die beiden Osakaner hielten es durch ohne zu nörgeln, schließlich war es ihre Idee gewesen mitzukommen. \"Also, was machen wir jetzt?\" fragte Kazuha, als wir aus dem Haupteingang traten. \"Es ist ein schöner Tag und Heiji und ich sind ja nicht jeden Tag in Tokyo. Um genau zu sein, ist das erst unser zweites Mal hier. Deshalb würde ich vorschlagen, dass wir zum Tokyotower gehen.\" Ran und ich stimmten ihr zu. Das war ein beliebter Ort für Touristen, da man von dort oben über ganz Tokyo blicken konnte. Unterwegs liefen wir bei Ran Zuhause vorbei, um ihren Vater zu fragen, ob er uns hinfahren konnte. Der gescheiterte Detektiv tat uns den Gefallen, besorgte einen Mietwagen und brachte uns hin. Ich bedankte mich bei ihm, als er uns am Eingang raus ließ. Er schnaubte nur und fuhr davon. Ich glaubte er konnte mich nicht leiden, weil ich die ganzen Aufträge übernahm, die sonst er bekommen könnte, aber ich kam mit ihm aus und das war die Hauptsache. Heiji und Kazuha liefen, mit Ran zum Ticketstand, um vier Eintrittskarten zu kaufen. Ich stellte mich währenddessen am Eingang an. Das Durchsuchen nach Bomben und Waffen dauerte länger, als das Bezahlen, deshalb kamen sie, lange bevor wir drankamen, zu mir zurück. \"Es scheint ganz schön viel los zu sein.\" murmelte Ran und schaute sich um. Ich folgte ihrem Blick. Sie hatte recht. Der Tokyotower war zwar sehr berühmt, doch es waren wirklich viele Leute, die ihn heute besuchen wollten. Zumindest um einige mehr als sonst. Man hatte fast das Gefühl es gäbe Freikarten. Gerade als wir den Weg zum Fahrstuhl entlang liefen, brummte mein Handy. Es war kein Anruf, sonst hätte es geklingelt, deshalb tippte ich auf eine Nachricht. Tatsächlich war es eine SMS. Interessiert öffnete ich sie. Darin standen folgende Worte: Tokyotower, 20 Uhr, Yellow Sunshine Der Katzes Kind \"Wer is' *der Katzes Kind*?\" fragte Heiji, der über meine Schulter mitgelesen hatte. \"Irgend'n Freund von dir?\" Schnell schaltete ich es wieder aus und antwortete: \"Ja, er schickt mir manchmal Aufträge, möchte aber nicht, dass irgendjemand erfährt, wer er ist.\" \"Komischer Typ.\" murmelte Heiji misstrauisch. \"Aber wenn er dir hilft, wird er schon in Ordnung sein.\" Ich nickte abwesend, als wir in den Fahrstuhl stiegen und dachte über die Nachricht nach. Was für ein Zufall. Ausgerechnet hier und heute, in gerade mal vier Stunden. Das würde auch die Menschenmassen erklären. So wie ich Ran kannte, würde sie hier bleiben wollen, bis es dunkel wurde und der Tokyotower von farbigen Lichtern bestrahlt werden würde, sodass es aussah, als würde er von innen heraus leuchten. Sie liebte dieses Bild am meisten, von dem gesamten Turm. Wir vertrieben uns die Zeit, indem wir uns Tokyo, von oben, anschauten, Fotos machten und etwas aßen. Zwischendurch fand ich einen unbemerkten Zeitpunkt, um meinem Freund eine Antwort zu schicken. Er nannte mir daraufhin den Treffpunkt. Ich lächelte zufrieden, als ich ihn mir durchlas. Es war ein perfekter Ort. Um 19 Uhr gingen die Lichter an, doch die Aufmerksamkeit der Besucher lag nicht auf dem Spektakel, dass sich am Nachthimmel Tokyos abspielte, sondern dem Zentrum der Turmspitze. Dort war eine Absperrung, die die Leute daran hindern sollte, zu dem gelblich schimmernden Diamanten, der ca einen Durchmesser von sieben Zentimeter hatte, zu gehen. Polizisten in Uniformen liefen überall umher und patrouillierten von einer Seite der Plattform zur nächsten. \"Fällt das nur mir auf, oder sind heute viele Polizisten im Einsatz?\" fragte Kazuha unsicher, als sie dem nun schon sechsten Bediensteten, der an uns vorbei kam, hinterher schaute. Ich deutete mit einer lässigen Handbewegung auf meine Entdeckung, sowie Inspektor Nakamori, der voller inbrunst durch die Gegend stürmte. \"Anscheinend hat KID heute Abend wieder einen seiner Auftritte.\" Spekulierte ich anhand der Fakten. Inspektor Nakamori wurde nur dann gerufen, wenn eine Nachricht von KID auftauchte. \"Deshalb also die ganzen Leute.\" Sagte Ran, in ihren eigenen Gedanken versunken. Um kurz vor acht, wir hatten beschlossen bis zur angekündigten Zeit von KID um 20:15 Uhr hier zu bleiben, entschuldigte ich mich bei den anderen, um zu dem Gespräch, mit meinem \"Klienten\" zu gehen. Heiji wollte mitkommen, doch ich erinnerte ihn daran, dass KID gleich auftauchen würde und da er sich ja unbedingt mit diesem Fall beschäftigen wollte, musste er dort bleiben, um sich selbst einen Eindruck von dem Phantomdieb zu machen. Um 20:10 Uhr KID beobachtete das Sicherheitssystem. Es war genauso aufgebaut, wie er erwartet hatte und selbst wenn etwas anderes dabei gewesen wäre, hätte er verschiedene Möglichkeiten durchdacht, um diese zu umgehen. Der \"Yellow Sunshine\" befand sich in einer Vitrine, bewacht von Sicherheitsleuten, die extra für solche Fälle ausgebildet worden waren. Zusätzlich erschwerten die ganzen Leute seine Flucht, indem sie ihm keinen Weg offen ließen. Aber er war nicht umsonst ein Meisterdieb. Würde ihm das so große Probleme machen, dann wäre er schon viele Male zuvor geschnappt worden. Außerdem war das sein Puplikum. Ohne sie, wäre es nicht das Gleiche, seine Tricks vorzuführen. Er ließ den Blick über sie Menge wandern. Da war er! Der große Detektiv, der den Westen Japans repräsentierte. Er lächelte. Endlich würde es einmal spannend werden. Nakamori wurde langsam alt und mit diesem Detektiv würde endlich mal etwas neues passieren. Er schaute auf die Uhr, die an der gegenüber liegenden Wand hing. Nur noch ein paar Sekunden, dann würde die Show beginnen. Er streckte die Hand aus. Ein Schwarm Tauben erschien wie aus dem Nichts, flog einmal über die Köpfe der Menschen hinweg und begann die Vitrine zu umkreisen. Der perfekte Zeitpunkt war gekommen. Die Tauben verwirrten Heiji. Wer kündigte sein Kommen mit Vögeln an? Er wusste zwar, dass KID ein Magier war, aber das war wirklich übertrieben. Als die Tiere sich, eines nach dem anderen nieder ließ, blieb dem Detektiv die Luft weg. Kaito KID stand dort, mit dem Diamanten in der Hand, eingehüllt in den weißen Vögeln. Es sah fast so aus, als bestände er aus ihnen, da sie jeden Teil seines Körpers bedeckten, außer das Gesicht, mit dem Mononokel. Wut überkam ihn. Nicht auf KID, sondern auf ihn selbst. Er hatte sich ablenken lassen, dabei war das der Grund, warum so viele Menschen auf Zaubertricks hereinfielen. Und jetzt hatte der Dieb seine Beute. Nakamori verschwendete keine Zeit mit Nachdenken, sondern befahl allen ihn zu schnappen. Die Sicherheitsleute des Diamanten waren am Nächsten und stürtzten sich auf den Phantomdieb, doch der hatte diesen Namen nicht ohne Grund.. Die Tauben stoben auf, versperrten ihnen die Sicht und als sie in die weite Nacht davon flogen, stand KID auf dem Geländer, nicht weit von Heiji, bereit den Rückzug anzutreten. Der Wind, der auf der Plattform des Turms herrschte, ließ seine Umhang flattern, wie ein Blatt im Wind. \"Vielen Dank für diese Geschenk, Nakamori-keibu.\" Sagte er und hob den Edelstein ins Licht des Mondes \"Doch wie es scheint, muss ich es zurückgeben. Glas hat nicht den gleichen Wert, wie der wahre Schatz, den ich suche. Ich werde ihn ihnen zurückgeben, damit sie damit machen können, was sie wollen.\" Er warf den Diamanten, der anscheinend keiner war, Inspektor Nakamori zu, der ihn überrascht auffing. Heiji war sprachlos. KID hatte mit einem einzigen Blick erkannt, dass es sich um eine Fälschung handelte. Dieser Typ war wirklich ein Meister, in seinem Handwerk. Er schaffte es jedes Mal die Polizei auszutricksen, ohne selbst ausgetrickst zu werden und hielt dabei das Puplikum in Atem. \"Heute mal nur auf einer betrachtenden Position, Meisterdetektiv des Westens?\" Er erstarrte. KID schaute ihn direkt an, als hätte er von Anfang an gewusst, dass er da war und wo genau er sich befand. Plötzlich fiel ein Schuss! Schreie ertönten. KIDs Augen weiteten sich, als er das Gleichgewicht verlor und nach hinten herunter fiel. Dort wo es über 300 Meter in die Tiefe ging. Heiji Kopf fuhr in die andere Richtung, aus der die Kugel gekommen war, wo ein Mann, mit einer Pistole in der Hand und einem zufriedenen Grinsen im Gesicht stand. Der Kleidung nach zu urteilen, war er Polizeikommissar. Nakamori war außer sich. Er stampfte auf ihn zu und schrie ihn an, wie er ddas nur tun konnte. Er hätte Zivilisten treffen können. Außerdem schossen sie nicht auf KID. Sie fingen ihn. Heiji wante sich wieder dem Geländer zu und schaute runter. Er konnte niemanden sehen. Er konnte niemanden sehen. Weder einen KID, der sich irgendwo festklammerte, noch eine Menschenmenge, die sich unten auf dem Erdboden um einen Toten versammelten. Er hatte sich in Luft aufgelöst, doch wie hatte er das gemacht? \"Wen suchst du denn?\" fragte eine Stimme hinter ihm. Es war die von Shinichi, dessen Besitzer sich einen WWeg durch die Menge bahnte. \"Und was ist überhaupt hier los?\" Der Detektiv des Westens erzählte es dem des Ostens, der einen winzigen Moment besorgt aussah. Doch es war so kurz, dass er glaubte, es sich nur eingebildet zu haben. \"Dann hoffen wir mal, dass sie diesen Typen in Zukunft von KID-Auftritten fernhalten, wenn es sie denn nach heute noch gibt.\" sagte Shinichi, sobald Heiji geendet hatte. \"Hast du wenigstens schon Fortschritte mit deinem *Wer ist Kaito KID?* Fall gemacht?\" Er mussteden Kopf schütteln. Um genau zu sein, hatte er garnicht mehr daran gedacht, nach irgendwelchen Indizien ausschau zu halten. Er war zu sehr von dem Können beeindruckt gewesen, dass der Magier besaß, wenn es um Diebstahl und Ablenkung ging. \"Ich hab' nich' mal 'ne Ahnung, wo die Kugel ihn erwischt hat.\" gestand er seinem Freund, \"Ich war nich' bei der Sache.\" Shinichi warf ihm einen mitfühlenden Blick zu. \"Das bekommst du schon irgendwie hin.\"[Chapter 4] Case 3: \"Was ist eigentlich das?\" wollte Heiji wissen und deutete auf das Pflaster, an meinem Unterarm. Schnell bedeckte ich es mit der Hand und antwortete etwas nervös : \"Ach das! Ähm... Ich bin... hingefallen. Ja genau! Ich bin heute morgen über eins meiner Bücher gestolpert und hab mir den Arm aufgeschürft. Schon dumm, nicht wahr?\" Man sah ihm an, dass er mir nicht glaubte, aber mir fiel keine bessere Ausrede ein. Ich hatte einen schlechten Abend hinter mir. Der Auftrag, den ich bekommen hatte, war schnell erledigt gewesen, doch am Ende hatte er eine unschöne Wendung genommen. Heute morgen war ich dann von dem Getrampel des Detektivs gewegeweckt worden. Das einzige Gute an der ganzen Sache war, dass ich endlich mal wieder richtig geschlafen hatte, sodass die Müdigkeit der letzten Tage verschwunden war. Jetzt waren wir auf dem Weg zu einem Tatort, zu dem die Polizei mich gerufen hatte, während die Mädchen shoppen gingen. Ran wollte Kazuha sie ganzen Einkaufszentren zeigen, die es in Tokyo gab. Im Geheimen hatte ich beschlossen ihn den Fall aufklären zu lassen, um ihn wieder ein bisschen aufzumuntern. Er schien die Sache vom Vortag noch nicht ganz weggesteckt zu haben und wenn er glaubte, mich in meiner eigenen Stadt besiegen zu können, würde das seine Stimmung bestimmt um einiges anheben. Der Mordfall war im Beikapark passiert. Eine Person hatte einen Mann namens Yuichiro Habita erstochen. Die Tatzeit war heute Nacht zwischen ein und drei Uhr. Die Tatwaffe, ein Messer mit einer Klingenlänge von sieben Zentimetern, war in einem Busch, unweit der Leiche, gefunden worden, wo es in aller Eile versteckt worden war. Heiji begann den Tatort sofort nach Spuren, die auf den Täter hinwiesen und die die Polizei übersehen hatte, abzusuchen. Währenddessen nahm ich mein Handy zur Hand und schrieb eine SMS an *des Katzes Junge*. Ein leichtes Lächeln stahl sich auf mein Gesicht. Normale Detektive, und selbst die besseren wie Heiji konnte dieser Name täuschen, doch Sherlock Holmes wäre schon wenn er ihn auch nur gehört hätte, dahinter gekommen, welche Person sich damit verbarg. Dabei war es nichtmal so schwer. \"Wie geht es ihm?\" fragte er, kurz nachdem ich die Nachricht abgeschickt hatte. So schnelle Antworten war ich von ihm gewohnt. \"Bin grad' dabei ihn aufzumuntern.\" schrieb ich zurück. Er meinte Heiji. Ich hatte ihm erzählt, wie sehr ihn die Sache vom Vorabend mitnahm. Gerade beugte der Detektiv sich triumphierend über ein Stück Erde, auf dem er etwas ungewöhnliches gefunden zu haben schien. Etwas, dass nicht dorthin gehörte. \"Dann hoffen wir mal, dass er nicht so schnell aufgibt, mit diesem Fall.\" Ich schaute dem Detektiv zu, wie er durch die Gegend lief und auf verschiedene Dinge zeigte, um Inspektor Megure den Tathergang zu erklären. Wie erwartet war es keine Schwierigkeit für ihn, diesen Fall zu lösen. Wahrscheinlich war auch nur seine halbe Aufmerksamkeit wirklich bei uns. Die andere machte sich schon wieder Gedanken, wie er KIDs Identität herausbekommen sollte. Er beendete die Ermittlungen innerhalb von wenigen Minuten, indem er den Mörder bestimmte und zu einem Geständnis brachte, dann drehte er sich herausfordernd, grinsend zu mir um. \"Hah! Ich war schneller als du! Glaubst du mir jetzt, dass ich ein besserer Detektiv bin als du?\" Du wärst besser, wenn du gemerkt hättest, dass ich überhaupt nichts gemacht habe. Sagte ich in meinen Gedanken, ließ seine Frage sonst aber unbeantwortet. Nachdem Inspektor Megure Heiji für seine Hilfe gedankt hatte, gönnten wir uns etwas zum Essen. Es war bereits halb Drei und ich war am Morgen zu nichts mehr, als einer kleinen Schüssel Reis, gekommen. Heiji ging das genauso. Kazuha und Ran hatten uns aus dem Haus gescheucht, weil sie gemeint hatten, es wäre ein schöner Tag, also sollten wir auch raus gehen. Ich hatte nicht gewusst, dass Ran so hartnäckig sein konnte, obwohl ich sie seit dem Kindergarten kannte. Während wir da standen und aßen, begann es zu schneien. Kleine weiße Flocken fielen vom Himmel, die schon bald größer wurden und begannen die Straßen zu bedecken. Eine Weile schaute ich dem Spiel des Wetters zu, bis Heiji mich anstupste und mit dem Kopf zu einer Person nickte, die uns beobachtete. Es war ein etwa 17-Jähriger Junge, mit Basecap, die sein Gesicht in Schatten warf. Ich lächelte und wand mich wieder dem Detektiv zu. \"Wahrscheinlich hat er erkannt wer wir sind und fragt sich, wie wir als Rivalen nur so entspannt beieinander sitzen können.\" Er blinzelte mich verwirrt an, dann fing er an zu lachen. \"Wir werden wirklich als Rivale des andren angesehen? Das hab' ich garnich' gewusst. Ich dacht' immer wir sin' Kollegen. Eigentlich sogar Freunde, die sich halt gern mal messen.\" Genau das war auch mein Gedanke, doch es war schön ihn auch mal von ihm ausgesprochen zu hören. Außerdem musste ich ihn ja irgendwie ablenken. Mein Blick wanderte wieder zu dem Jungen, der sich inzwischen über sein Essen gebeugt hatte. Heiji durfte nichts von dem ganzen erfahren, bevor er sich sicher war, dass der Detektiv vertrauenswürdig war. Aber was machte er überhaupt hier? Ich schüttelte den Kopf. Er würde es mir schon sagen, wenn es wichtig war. Vielleicht war es auch nur Zufall, dass er ausgerechnet in Beika unterwegs war und nicht in Ekoda. Jeder wollte mal was anderes sehen. Als wir fertig waren, liefen wir hinaus, in den Schnee. Inzwischen bedeckte eine feine, weiße Schicht den Boden, die nicht einmal durch die Schritte der vielen Menschen wegschmolz. In den letzten Tagen war es sehr kalt gewesen, sodass der Boden gefroren war und die Flocken darauf liegen blieben. Jemand rempelte mich an. Gleichzeitig spürte ich einen zusammengefalteten Zettel, der in meine Hand geschoben wurde, dann hörte ich ein \"Entschuldigung\" und schnelle Schritte, die sich entfernten. Ich ballte die Hände zu Fäusten, um das Stück Papier vor Heiji zu verstecken, der dem Übeltäter nachschaute. \"Also ich versteh' die Leute hier nich'.\" Sagte er \"Is' grad mal 17 und hat schon keine Zeit mehr, um sich richtig zu entschuldiegen.\" \"Vielleicht kommt er zu spät mach Hause.\" Schlug ich vor. Ich mochte es nicht, wenn er Tokyo, oder seine Bewohner schlecht machte. \"Lass uns nach Hause gehen. Ich bin müde.\" Das war ich nicht wirklich, aber ich wusste, dass er noch unbedingt zum Hafen wollte und wenn wir uns aufteilten, konnte ich das erledigen, was ich tatsächlich vor hatte. Er reagierte, wie erwartet, mit dem Vorschlag und aufzuteilen. Ich verabschiedete mich von ihm, nachdem ich ihm eine Wegbeschreibung gegeben hatte und lief davon. Sobald ich sicher war, dass er mich nicht mehr sehen konnte, bog ich in die nächste Seitenstraße ab. Dort faltete ich den Zettel auseinander und las das Wort, dass dort in aller Eile hingekritzelt worden war. Es war ein Ort. Genauer gesagt, war es der Hafen von Tokyo. Am Hafen von Tokyo, 17 Uhr Es war Schicksal, dass er mich ausgerechnet dort treffen wollte ...oder auch nicht. Auf jeden Fall musste ich dafür sorgen, dass Heiji mich nicht sah, wo er sich doch auch hier irgendwo herumtrieb. Ich spähte um jede Ecke, bevor ich abbog, bis ich den gewünschten Ort erreichte. Es war offensichtlich gewesen, wo genau er meinte, da wie verschiedene Treffpunkte, an verschiedenen Orten ausgemacht hatten, falls nicht genug Zeit blieb, um Genaueres aufzuschreiben. Ich erreichte mein Ziel und wartete. Ich befand mich in einer eher abgelegenen Ecke des Hafens, direkt neben einem blauen Container, auf dem ein großes, weißes Kanji Schriftzeichen stand: 願 (neka/Katze) Warum da ausgerechnet Katze stand, wusste ich nicht. Vielleicht hieß die Firma, zu der er gehörte, so. Ich wartete genau eine Minute, dann löste sich eine Gestalt aus dem Schatten, zwischen zwei weiteren Containern. Es war der Junge von vorhin, doch jetzt hatte er die Kappe abgesetzt und ich schaute in das Gesicht, das genauso gut mein eigenes hätte sein können, wenn man mal von den hellblauen Augen absah. Außerdem waren seiner Haare um einiges unordentlicher, als meine. Lächelnd betrachtete Kaito Kuroba mich. \"Du hast aber lange gebraucht.\" \"Ich musste ja auch noch Heiji loswerden. Es ist ein Wunder, dass ich das überhaupt schnell geschafft habe. Aber sag, was war so wichtig, dass ich sofort kommen sollte. Normalerweise bist du nicht so hektisch.\" Erwiederte ich. Seine Gesichtszüge wurden ernst, als er sein Pokerface ablegte. \"Es geht um den Vorfall gestern.\" Instinktiv fuhr mein Hand hoch zu dem Streifschuss, an meinem Arm. \"Ich glaube wir sollten Kaito KID eine Auszeit gönnen. Nur so lange, wie solche Leute herumrennen. Danach können wir weiter machen.\" Ich erstarrte. Was sagte er da gerade? Wir sollten es lassen? War das sein Ernst? Ich schüttelte heftig den Kopf. \"Nein! Wir können keine Pause machen. Was ist, wenn die Organisation in dieser Zeit den Pandora Stein findet? Dann wäre alles, was wir bisher geleistet haben umsonst gewesen. Willst du das etwa?\" \"N-Nein!\" Sagte er überrascht \"Ich habe aber gedacht du willst nicht mehr, nachdem du gestern beinahe gestorben bist.\" \"Hah!\" Machte ich \"Da war ich selbst schuld. Hätte ich besser aufgepasst, wäre ich nie in diese Situation gekommen.\" Ich erinnerte mich, wie ich auf dem Geländer gestanden hatte, als Plötzlich etwas heißes meinen Arm gestriffen hatte. Ich war so überrascht gewesen, dass ich vergessen hatte mein Gleichgewicht zu halten und hinab gestürtzt war. Mein Glück war es gewesen, dass Kaitos Freund Jii, der uns mit Informationen und Gerätschaften versorgte, den Hängegleiter wieder repariert hatte. Kaito hatte ihn das letzte Mal kaputt gemacht, als er eine Bruchlandung hingelegt hatte. Ich lächelte. Nachdem ich vom Turm gefallen war, hatte ich ihn angerufen, dass er meinen Platz einnehmen sollte, da Heiji sonst Verdacht schöpfen könnte. Dafür hatte ich ihm eine kleine Zusammenfassung der Dinge gegeben, die an diesem Tag passiert waren. Er musste ja irgendetwas einbauen, dass nur ich wissen konnte, damit der Detektiv glaubte, dass auch wirklich ich es gewesen war. Was ich natürlich nicht war. \"Verstehe ich das Richtig?\" Fragte eine Stimme, mit einem Kansai-Dialekt hinter mir \"Kudo, du bist Kaito KID?\" ","Summary":" Prolog: Die Straße, vor dem Museum war gefüllt, mit Menschen, die alle darauf warteten, dass der we"},{"Movie":"Human Centipede","Title":"The Human Centipede: Love at first bite final chapter","Author":"subconscious-majesty","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10049003","Passage":"[Chapter 1] I'm shocked.

I don't want to lose the love of my life, not when I just encountered him. I was really planning a marriage back in America. \"Let's do what we always do. Let's make sex, mein Frau.\" Heiter answered me, taking off his clothes to show me his perfect germanic body. \"Oh, but I like to try something different for a change...\" Something different on sex? Like, a different position? I saw on a shop here in Germany a book that has many sexual positions. Of course, a book like this in California could get the shop owners arrested. Maybe Heiter owns that book... Dr. Heiter send me to the room where I blowjobed him for the first time. He handcuffed my both hands to the wall, which my face is turned to. Wow, he will fuck me anally! That will totally grow our love. All I can look is the wall, not his shiny Excalibur that soon he will put back between the stones (get it?). I started to feel something entering between my buttocks, but it was not his powerful light-saber. It was something big, but uncomfortable. I could feel something piercing my inner skin... and the blood going out my ass - uh, holiest of holes. Maybe I am on period. I don't know. When I tried to think, I passed out. When I woke up, I was no longer handcuffed. But I feel something strange near my hole to Wonderland. Like... a mouth?! Oh no, my nightmare came true! I am the head of a centipede! But why? Dr. Heiter loves me and said he gave up this ideia... No... Why is this happening?! I searched for my Doctor and found him sewing the pit of Katsudo's penis inside (I think it's her) Jenny's vagina ! But, it's like an involuntary rape and he is gay! He can't rape woman! And in the vagina! Dr. Heiter saw me and walked on my direction. I started to cry and scream \"You said you gave up this ideia, why you used me for this centipede, I thought you love me?!\" He laughed. \"You thought wrong. Don't trust your kidnapper.\" This only can be a nightmare... Soon I will wake up in my doctor's arms... It can't be true... The doctor put his penis inside my mouth. It was no longer shinny or beautiful, just a plain long and thin stick. He forced it so deep it touched my uvula. He ejaculated too fast and the semen went through my throat. I couldn't know which flavor was it. Maybe shame or death. Or both. He grabbed my head so I didn't have a choice. I'm not enjoying it anymore... \"You see, 'mein Frau'. Now you learned that fall in love on your first blowjob is too soon, if even it was on your first bite!\" Heiter laughed madly. \"But seriously, violence is the best way to cure the innocence. I'm helping you; you were not prepared for real life. You still believe you can change people with love. POWER OF LOVE my ass!\" My mouth is blocked and so is my nose. He closed its windows with his long fingers. Now I just want a oxygen-flavored semen. Or to breath the California's polluted air again. Oh, why do I fell in love? Why was I so stupid? There's no such a thing as love... But I guess it's too late to think about it now. It's too late to think about anything. ","Summary":" I'm shocked.

He was near the door, but not so close. Just close enough to know what she was up to. Trying to strip herself, she fell over hitting her side onto the hard side of the toilet. XXXX XXXX She struggled big time, and whinced in pain. Heiter had wrapped her broken limbs but not in anything good and useful. She needed something more like a cast. ... She cried and kicked over and over. It got the man's attention: :He wasn't too happy. Not one bit amused. XX He forced open the door, causing it to loose up on it's henges. Lindsay made an attempt to get up, but with aching broken limbs it was impossible: \"Please.\"she begged him to stay back. tears went rolling down her face. \"Take them off!\"he argued with her in a raging German tone, causing her to drag her body back into the side of the porceiling tub. He was dressed in white. In a white surgeon gown, and eyes growing with anger...and not a care in the world. \"Take-them-off!\"he yelled harder, taking a hold of her arm. Both arms, and listening to her scream out it terror. He gotten tired of it, and slapped her across her face. She begged him to stop. She begged and pleaded. XXXX XXXX Soon even before she knew it, she was naked. Besides her white panties being the only piece of clothing left on her body that she tried to hide from him, with her only one working arm. \"I will run the water.\"he told her not taking one look behind his shoulder at her as he leaned over the large tub and started the water like he said he would. She trembled and feared. This man was her worst nightmare...worse than most horror-films and worse than most serial killers. X After getting the water warm enough, he turned around, stood up, and helped her up carefully. She hoped he wouldn't see her like this, but he did anyway. It barely bothered him. \"Step in!\"he shouted, pulling her hair after she didn't listen, and forced her foot into the water. She cried softer. XXXX XXXX Later after getting used to him helping her in, she layed back and let those few bubbles hide her breasts and other womanly areas. \"See. Now shampoo.\"he was kneeled down over in front of the tub, waiting to give her more assistance, while she slowly leaned up to reach for the bottle of shampoo. She looked at him as she did so, and those dark eyes of his never left hers. X . . . X she handed him the bottle now getting the idea that he was here to assist her since she was totally helpless from Dr. Heiter's doing. \"Come closer.\"he told her, holding the bottle, and waiting patiently for her to obey. Lindsay didn't at first, but once he grabbed a handful of her hair, she knew that she was suppose to listen. And she did. She leaned her back against the cool siding of the tub, and bent her head backwards as far as he made her, and squirted the bottle into a palm. \"Don't squirm around.\"he warned her again, and she made sure that she didn't. No matter how scared she was. \"Don't hurt me...please.\"she cried out softly. He said nothing in return. \"Be still.\"he yanked her head back with a tug of her hair, and massaged the shampoo into her hair. .. .. .. .. Minutes after finishing up her thick hair, he helped rinse under the running faucet. She didn't obey like she always did, but started to listen again after he'd inflict pain on her.

As long as that old creep didn't lay one hand on her. \"Rag.\" he told her, putting out his hand, waiting for her to put it in it. She bit her bottom lip, and cried as she reached for the rag. She tried to stand up. But Joseph was faster. He stood up, looking down at her, then up at the shower head where the rag hung, and got back into his kneeling position as before. \"Lay back.\"he told her in a soft voice, and watched her do what she was told to do. She shut her eyes tightly, and felt the rag move across her body. First it glided softly across her face. A face of a once beauty queen but now covered in nothing but purple bruises, and deep cuts. ... she felt the rag move slowly down more. Goosebumps formed over her numb skin, and her toes tingled.

She'd barely had any sleep for the past several days. She couldn't get the images out of her inner eye. She couldn't get the screams and the whimpers and pleads from her mind. They tormented her almost constantly. The only relief she got from the horrible images was whenever her parents came to see her. Or whenever Alexander came to check up on her during his lunch breaks. Alexander, the one she had to thank for everything. Lindsay knew she hadn't exactly treated the detective very well during her first few days in the hospital, even though he was as patient and as nice as he could be to her. \"I owe him\" she thought one morning as said man entered her room. \"good morning, Lindsay\" he said slowly. \"morning, Detective Müller\" Lindsay said quietly, sitting up a bit in the bed as he approached. \"please, call me Alexander\" he said, moving to sit in the chair by her bedside. \"how are you feeling this morning, Lindsay?\" the brunette shrugged. \"better, I guess\" \"well that's good to hear\" Alexander said, reaching over and putting his hand on her arm. \"Detect- uh, Alexander?\" \"yes?\" \"have you...?\" Lindsay hesitated. \"have I what?\" \"have you... told anyone?\" she fiddled nervously with a strand of her long hair. \"I-I mean, about...\" she felt tears in her eyes. \"what happened to me?\" the last few words came out in a whisper. \"only the detectives at the station, Lindsay\" Alexander said. \"they needed to know as much as possible to help you\" \"but no one else knows, right?\" Lindsay asked anxiously. \"no... no news people or anything?\" \"of course not\" Alexander shook his head. \"I would never tell anyone else about what's happened\" \"positive?\" \"of course\" Lindsay nodded slowly. \"I-I'm sorry to question you-\" \"no, don't be\" Alexander said quickly. \"I don't blame you for not wanting this to get out... and I swear to you it won't\" Lindsay nodded again, looking down at her hands, which were clasped in her lap. \"um... when are my parents getting here?\" \"I called them a few minutes before I came to see you\" Alexander said. \"they're speaking with your doctors, but they'll be here as soon as they can\" the young detective slowly turned to look at the wheelchair in a corner of the room by the door. \"Lindsay?\" \"yes?\" \"have you... I mean...\" Alexander rubbed the back of his neck nervously. \"have you had a chance to use that?\" he nodded toward the wheelchair. Lindsay followed his gaze, her expression instantly turning to one of disgust. \"I don't even want that thing\" she said stiffly. \"I keep telling them I don't want it-!\" \"it might help you to get out of this room for a while\" Alexander said. \" no! \" Lindsay said sharply. \"I'm not getting in that thing!\" \"you need to get out of this room, Lindsay\" Alexander said gently. \"I'd...\" he glanced at his watch. Yes, he still had a bit of time. \"I'd be happy to... to go outside with you for a bit\" the brunette sighed heavily, looking hesitant. She was itching to get out of the hospital room, but she did not want to go in the wheelchair. \"okay\" she finally mumbled, a slightly defeated look crossing her face. Alexander stood and walked over to the wheelchair, slowly wheeling it over by the bed. He went to help her from the bed, but Lindsay instantly stopped him. \"I-I can get out myself\" she said stubbornly. \"Lindsay-\" \"I can! \" she said, a little sharper then she'd intended. \"I can \" she repeated, a little softer. Alexander looked like he wanted to protest, but he sighed and nodded slowly, moving to stand behind the wheelchair, holding onto the handles so it wouldn't move. Lindsay slowly pulled the bed sheets off of her, and managed to get her legs over the edge of the bed. They were a bit sore, and she felt the color drain from her face when she saw the heavy bandages around her knees. She slowly tried to maneuver herself from the bed and into the seat of the wheelchair, but she slipped and nearly fell to the floor. Alexander quickly shot forward and managed to grab her before she could fall. Her feet were on the cold hospital floor, and when she tried to bend her knees slightly, she found she couldn't do it, her legs just wanted to crumple limply beneath her. \"Lindsay!\" Alexander said, quickly scooping her into his arms. \"verdammt noch mal, you've got to be more careful!\" Lindsay sighed in frustration, tears welling up in her eyes as Alexander slowly lowered her into the wheelchair. \"you know, it...\" he hesitated. \"it doesn't mean you're weak, just because you might need help sometimes-\" \"don't talk to me like I'm a little kid\" Lindsay sneered. \"you have no idea what I'm feeling...!\" she cut herself off, sighing again. She knew she shouldn't raise her voice at him, but she was just getting so fed up with... well, everything. \"it's okay\" Alexander said gently, moving behind the chair and taking hold of the handles, slowly turning it and wheeling her out of the room.

She wasn't sure, she didn't even know what day it was. Like she even cared. What did it matter anyway? She was going to die, she was sure of it. There was nothing left, no hope of escape or anyone finding her now. She sobbed and sobbed, her tears drying on her face, making it itchy. She sobbed, slowly reaching up to itch her face. she screamed (as best she could) in horror as soon as her hand touched her cheek. She could feel the incision and felt a sick feeling rising in her stomach. She sobbed and sobbed, lying there hopelessly, her entire body aching like fire. Katsuro dead in front of her, Jenny dead behind her. She was trapped. And she knew that there was no possible way of escaping now. No, there wasn't even any way she could try now. It would be close to, if not totally impossible for her to be able to drag around two dead bodies, especially since one was in front of her. \"Dr. Heiter?\" Lindsay's eyes widened, her heart pounding hard in her chest. Had she finally lost it? Had this unthinkable nightmare finally made her snap completely? Either that or... YES , yes, someone was in the house! Lindsay looked around frantically, as best she could in her current situation, trying to find something, anything she could use to alert the person to her presence. \"Dr. Heiter? Bist du hier?\" \" HELP!\" Lindsay thought frantically. \" PLEASE , HELP ME!\" she tried in vain to turn her head a bit, searching frantically for the lamp Katsuro had used earlier to try and break the window. She could just barely see it out the corner of her eye. \"Kranz? Völler? Wo bist du?\" sobbing hysterically, Lindsay tried to reach for the bed, which the centipede was only a few feet away from. If she could just get close enough, maybe she could push the bed against the wall hard enough for it to make a noise. She dragged herself to the side half an inch... then another inch... the dead weight on either end was significantly hindering her movements. Katsuro's body slumped forward a little more, pulling on the incisions in Lindsay's face and making them hurt even more then they already did. Sobbing, she managed to pull herself a bit closer to the end of the bed. Leaning against it, she pushed, pushed with all her might. \"Hallo? ist hier jemand?\" \" I'M IN HERE, PLEASE! \" Lindsay thought, grunting and sobbing as she tried to push against the bed a bit more. Wait... wait, had it... YES , IT MOVED! Not very much, but still, she managed to move it a bit! She pushed her shoulder against the bed, pushing and pushing, hoping in vain that she was close to hitting the wall. \"Hallo? Dr. Heiter, Polizei!\" the door of the room burst open just then, and a young man shot into the doorway, a gun drawn. \" YES!\" Lindsay thought, sobbing desperately and holding her hand out to the man. \"Was zum ... was, was ist das?, was hier passiert?\" Lindsay sobbed, trying desperately to drag herself toward him, pushing Katsuro's body forward with her arms at the same time. \"I-I don't know... i-if you can... understand me\" the young man stammered, obviously terribly disturbed. \"I-I'm Detective Alexander Müller... I- I'll call an ambulance for you... d-do you understand?\" \" YES! YES!\" Lindsay thought, nodding as best she could. \"I-I've got to go to my car and call for backup... I'll... I'll be right back, alright?\" \" what?! NO , NO, DON'T LEAVE ME HERE, YOU SORRY SON OF A BITCH!\" Lindsay thought, shaking her head as Alexander turned and hurried off. \"NO!\" sobbing, she shook her head slightly, pounding her fist on the floor. \"NO!\" ... Lindsay could hear sirens... yes, it was most definitly sirens she was hearing. Did that mean... had that detective really sent backup? Was this whole nightmare about to come to an end?! \"HELP!\" Lindsay thought. She could hear the sound of a door opening and several voices speaking German. \"Wo ist sie?\" \"hier unten\" \"help!\" Lindsay sobbed, her voice obviously muffled. \"help me\" a man and a woman came into the room, followed by Alexander. \"I-I think she understands English\" Alexander said. \"miss?\" the woman said. \"miss, can you understand me?\" Lindsay nodded. \"we're paramedics...\" the woman swallowed, clearly uncomfortable. \"we're going to take you to a hosptial, okay? W-we'll help you\" Lindsay sobbed, tears streaming down her face. The woman swallowed again, kneeling down by her. \"wer könnte dies tun? wer könnte dies tun?\" she mumbled, looking like she might start crying herself. \"miss\" the male paramedic said. \"miss, we're... we're not able to... to seperate you here. We have to get you to the hospital first\" Lindsay nodded. \"we'll have to put you under-\" what? Put her under... NO! No, they couldn't do that! \"no, NO! \" Lindsay tried to sob, flinching away from the man as he knelt down beside her. \"we're only trying to help you... we promise , you'll be a-at a hospital soon\" Lindsay sobbed in defeat and could only lie still as the man injected something into her arm. She slowly felt her eyes growing heavy. And she only hoped that these people would keep true to their word. ... \"Ms. Williams?\" a voice... she could hear a voice... it sounded muffled, as though it were far away and behind a wall. \"Ms. Williams, can you hear me?\" Lindsay slowly opened her eyes. She blinked, the lights in the room were very bright and she lifted her arm to shield her eyes from the glare. \"where am I?\" she thought. Her knees, face, and behind hurt like mad, her mouth felt strange, and she had no idea what had happened. One thing she was sure of was that she felt significantly lighter... wait, did that mean...? she sat up with a start, blinking and looking around. The first thing she did was scream. She screamed and she screamed, the pent up anger, humiliation, the pain all pouring out in a flood of screams. \"Ms. Williams, Ms. Williams, it's all right!\" Alexander was beside her in a flash. Lindsay shoved him back. \"WHERE AM I?!\" \"you're at the hospital, Ms. Williams, just like we said!\" Alexander said. \"just... please , try to calm down-\" \"calm down?! DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA WHAT I'VE BEEN THROUGH?! NO , NO YOU DON'T! YOU DON'T HAVE ANY IDEA!\" Lindsay screamed. She narrowed her eyes at him. \"so don't you dare stand there and tell me to calm down! \" she sneered, sobbing. She covered her face with her hands, but immediatly recoiled. \"g-give me a mirror!\" \"ma'am-\" \" now , damn it!\" Lindsay snapped, still sobbing. Alexander hesitated, but got a small handmirror and held it in front of her. \"oh... oh...\" Lindsay whimpered, staring in horror at her face. Her cheeks were heavily bandaged and her lips... her lips were very red and swollen, almost mishapen. \"oh look at me\" Lindsay groaned in horror. \"LOOK AT WHAT HE DID TO ME!\" she screamed, whipping her head around to glare at Alexander. \"Ms. Williams-\" \"how do you know my name?\" Lindsay demanded. \"I did a fingerprint analysis, ma'am\" Alexander said. \"I've notified your parents-\" \"I want to go home\" Lindsay said. \"I want to get out fo this room , out of this country! \" \"I-I understand\" Alexander said. \"but... you're not in any condition to leave yet-\" \"you can't keep me here!\" Lindsay shouted, coughing. Her thorat was beginning to hurt from the screaming and the strain of crying. \"I WANT TO GO HOME NOW! \" \"I'm sorry Ms.-\" \"and stop calling me Ms. Williams!\" she looked him right in the eye. \"I have a first name, you know. my name is Lindsay! \" \"alright, alright... Lindsay\" Alexander said gently. \"look, I can't even begin to imagine what you're feeling right now... but you've got to understand that you can't just get up and walk away from something like this\" he sighed. \"you've got a lot of healing to do, and moving you right now would just put unecessary stress on your mind and your body...\" he hesitated. \"do you understand, Ms.- um, Lindsay?\" the brunette heaved a heavy sigh, shoving her fingers through her hair. \"I guess I don't really have any choice, do I?\" she mumbled hopelessly. \"I'm sorry\" Alexander said. \"if I could, I'd let you go home right this second\" \"c-can I...\" Lindsay hesitated, starting to calm down just slightly. \"can I call my mom? Please , I... I need to talk to my mom\" \"of course\" Alexander said, getting up from the chair by the bed that he'd sat down in. \"here, you can use mine\" he took his cell phone from his pocket and handed it to her. She snatched the phone with an overeager hand and fumbled to flip it open. Her fingers shook as she tried to dial the number. \"um...\" she hesitantly held the phone back. \"c-can you... dial for me? I-I can't-\" \"I understand\" Alexander said, taking the phone from her and dialing the numbers she told him. He handed the phone back to her. Lindsay's heart was pounding as the phone rang. Once. Twice. Three times. \" come on, please pick up!\" Lindsay thought desperatly. A few seconds later, the phone was picked up. \"hello?\" her mother's voice stammered. It was clear that she'd been crying. \" mom! \" Lindsay sobbed. \"oh mom!\" \"Lindsay?! Lindsay , you're alive!\" her mother cried. \"oh honey, the detective, he told me... oh Lindsay, I just can't beleive this has happened-\" \"mom, I need you here\" Lindsay choked out, swallowing. \"please mommy, I need you here with me!\" \"your father and I are going to get a flight to Germany as soon as possible, honey\" Mrs. Williams stammered. \"oh Lindsay, I... I'm so sorry -\" she fought back a sob. \"i-it's okay, mommy\" Lindsay sobbed. \"it'll be okay, I just... just need you here\" \"I know... we'll be there soon, Lindsay\" Mrs. Williams said. \"just h-hold on... we'll be there in the morning\" Lindsay sobbed, nodding. \"o-okay\" \"I have to go now, sweetheart\" Mrs. Williams said hesitantly. \"we've got to leave now if we're going to catch the plane\" \"okay\" Lindsay whispered. \"mom?\" \"y-yes?\" \"I...\" Lindsay swallowed. \"I love you, mom. I love you so much ... and I'm so sorry I never told you that enough\" \"I love you too, honey\" Mrs. Williams said, sniffing. \"g-goodbye... we'll see you soon\" Lindsay nodded. \"okay... bye, mom\" heaving a shaky sigh, she handed Alexander his phone. \"th-thank you\" she mumbled quietly, lowering her head, letting a bit of her hair fall forward and cover her face. \"try not to worry, Lindsay\" Alexander said, putting a hand on her shoulder. \"your parents should be here either late tonight or tomorrow morning\" she nodded slowly. \"I...\" she swallowed. \"I'm s-sorry I yelled at you\" \"hey, I don't blame you one bit\" Alexander said. \"no hard feelings, Lindsay\" he smiled slightly at her. \"just get better, okay?\" \"yeah... okay\" she said quietly. \"do you... do you want to be alone for a while and rest?\" Alexander asked. Lindsay looked up at him. \"I want to rest, but... stay\" \"pardon?\" \"stay... in here\" Lindsay siad slowly. \" please , I... I don't want to be alone... please \" she was practically begging. Alexander hesitated, but nodded slowly. \"okay... okay, I-I'll stay\" he slowly moved to sit back in the chair by her bedside. \"th-thank you\" she said quietly. She was exhausted and she felt her eyes getting heavy. She didn't want to sleep, terrified of the nightmares she was sure to have. But at the same time, she hadn't had a decent sleep in what felt like years. She slowly sank back against the pillow and allowed her eyes to fully close. She hoped, prayed that she wouldn't dream of Heiter. ... \"Lindsay?\" \"hmm?\" the brunette's eyes felt heavy as she slowly opened them. She was greeted with the sight of her mom and dad standing over her. \"Lindsay!\" \"mom!\" Lindsay sat up quickly, wrapping her arms around her mother and pulling her into a hug, dissolving into tears. \"I'm here, Lindsay, I'm here, baby\" Mrs. Williams said, hugging her daughter tightly to her. \"don't worry, Linz\" Mr. Williams said, hugging his daughter when his wife pulled away. \"we'll be staying right here while you recover\" \"I'm so g-glad you two are here!\" Lindsay said, smilign slightly. Although it pained her to think of what hse must look like now beneath the bandages. \"do you need anything, honey?\" Mrs. Williams asked. Lindsay sighed and shook her head. \"n-no, not right now... I just want you two here with me\" Mr. Williams nodded. \"we'll be right here, sweetheart. We've got a room at the hotel right across the street. We even made sure we got a room where we can see each other from the windows\" he nodded toward the window on the other side of the room. Lindsay nodded, then suddenly frowned. \"J-Jenny's parents-?\" she started. She wondered how angry her best friends parents were at her. \"they're relieved you're alright now, Lindsay\" Mrs. Williams said. \"they send their love\" \"y-you mean... they don't...\" Lindsay swallowed. \"hate me?\" \"of course not\" Mr. Williams shook his head. \"what happened...\" he took a deep breath. \"what happened was not your fault, Lindsay\" his wife nodded. \"don't blame yourself, sweetie\" Lindsay nodded slowly. \"I-I'm trying not to... I'm really trying\" \"you shouldn't\" Mrs. Williams said. She sighed. \"you should get some rest, honey. The doctors are going to be checking on you in a little while\" Lindsay stiffened slightly at the word 'doctors', but she just nodded quickly and tried not to show her discomfort. \"okay, mom\" \"we'll be in the lobby, Lindsay\" Mr. Williams said. \"we'll leave you alone for a while so you can get some rest\" \"okay, daddy\" Lindsay said quietly, watching as they headed out of the room. \"mom? Dad?\" her parents turned to her. \"yes, honey?\" Mrs. Williams said. \"I... I love you\" \"we love you too, Lindsay\" Mr. Williams said, smiling as he and his wife left the room. Lindsay heaved a heavy sigh and laid back down. In spite of things, she did feel a little better now that her parents were there. Deep down, she knew that she would forever be scarred, both physically and emotionally. But she also had a new appreciation for life and her family... and for that, she was greatful. aanndddd DONE! phew, SO glad I got that out of my system. hey, I think I actually feel a bit better now. just a litlte bit...

Keep in mind that I didn't have any sound on my computer when I watched this and I can't read lips so I have no idea what was said in the movie other than what the subtitles (few and far between) gave me). This is my take on it because, naturally, I have to add a bit of my own femslash to every fanfic archive I com across, especially if they don't already have femslash. This one had ONE femslash story and it was amazing. Now go on and read while I work on some other stories. This was edited grammatically and spelling wise, but it's not separated at all because there is no reason for it to be separated. I don't own the Human Centipede, that high honor goes only to Tom Six. Lindsay couldn't believe this. She was stuck behind a dead Japanese man who had committed suicide without a thought to the two women behind him, relying on him for help. They couldn't think of just themselves anymore because there would be consequences for the other two. But that was exactly what he had done. This man had killed himself without thinking of Lindsay or the dying Jenny behind her. Tears slowly began slipping from Lindsay's eyes as she felt Jenny becoming limp behind her. She tried to tug at the Japanese man in front of her to move around to face her head toward Jenny, but he was too heavy. Deciding to go with what she could do, Lindsay grabbed a hold of Jenny's hand and looked into the mirror to see how her friend was doing. So many times, Lindsay had wished to tell Jenny how much she meant to her, so many times she wished she had had the guts to confess to her friend. But that chance had been flushed away as soon as she awoke to find her mouth surgically attached to the ass of a man in front of her and Jenny's mouth attached to her own behind. She held onto her friend desperately, wishing she could die with her so that she wouldn't be without her, but there was no chance of her dying very quickly. As Jenny began fading away to nothing, Lindsay's tears increased, feeling the pressure on her hand weakening until it no longer closed around her own. The straight haired girl began sobbing helplessly as she realized that her love had died, after everything they had gone through together—with getting lost and meeting that madman that, by now, was probably dead—they had gone through a lot and now, she would never be able to tell Jenny how she felt. Her friend was gone and Lindsay was alone in a house full of corpses. I know, kind of twisted, but as I mentioned before, I didn't have sound so I can only go off what I've read on the movie.

UPDATE: Dec 31st, 2014; I have decided to leave this as an AU-ish one shot drabble thing. More details at the end. I don't own the Human Centipede. Lindsay watched as Heiter moved to Jenny and growled as she felt him touching her friend. She wished she was able to cuss the man out for even subjecting Jenny to this. The girls had been constipated for weeks because this man decided that he wanted a new pet. \"You seem to be healthy as well. My pet is in perfect condition, then.\" Heiter grinned happily and Lindsay glared at him, wishing she could kick him. Without the use of her knees, she was kind of out of luck though. Just then, there was a loud banging followed by a crash. \"US army, come out with your hands up!\" Heiter cursed angrily as about a dozen different camouflaged officers filed into his medical area. \"Stay back!\" He snarled. The officers advanced and he pressed a knife to Katsuro's throat. \"I mean it! Stay back.\" When none of the officers followed his command, Heiter slashed the poor Japanese man and let him bleed out. One single shot was fired and Heiter went down as two officers approached the girls. \"Stay calm.\" One of them said softly. \"We're going to fix this. We have trained doctors on the way.\" The other turned to Lindsay and said, \"Miss, we're sorry, but we have to cut the man away from you.\" Lindsay nodded slowly to show she understood and closed her eyes tight as the men went to work cutting Katsuro off her. When they were finished, only a few pieces of skin were still attached to her mouth and Lindsay sank down in relief. \"Ma'am?\" She looked up at the guilty looking officer. \"We now have to cut you away from your companion.\" Lindsay took in a deep breath... and fainted. When she next awoke, she and Jenny were on side-by-side operation tables with numerous machines around them. Looking down at herself, Lindsay found that she could bend and straighten her knees somewhat and that she had dentures in her mouth. Her legs, backside and head were pounding with pain, but she wanted to make sure Jenny was alright first. \"Jenny?\" She called softly. The other brunette groaned and slowly opened her eyes. \"Lindsay?\" She asked groggily. \"Jenny, thank God!\" Lindsay cheered. \"How do you feel?\" \"Sore as hell. You?\" \"Same. Do you need a nurse?\" \"Not as much as you probably do.\" Lindsay chuckled and pressed the button to call a nurse in. A stout woman with red hair, brown eyes and a warm smile strode in with two trays of food and set each down. \"Glad to see you're both awake.\" She said in a friendly tone. \"Would you like some food? How do you feel?\" \"Yes please.\" Jenny said eagerly. \"And really sore.\" Lindsay added. \"Well, I have some food for you right here, and I can provide a small dose of morphine for you.\" \"Thanks.\" The girls chorused, taking their trays carefully. While the nurse checked their vitals and made sure their tubes were tight, Jenny and Lindsay ate the food brought: Salisbury steak, peas and rolls with water. \"Well, I have some good news for you both.\" The nurse told them. \"You'll both be able to be released tomorrow afternoon.\" \"But... where will we go?\" Lindsay asked. \"We don't even know where we are.\" \"You're back home in Pierre, South Dakota.\" The woman replied. \"Wherever you lived before you went on that traumatic trip to Germany is most likely where you'll be going.\" The girls looked at each other in shock before turning to the nurse. \"We're back home?\" Jenny whispered. \"Yes, you are. Now, I'll be back in an hour to check you again. Press your button if you need anything.\" With that, the nurse left and the friends were left to themselves. \"Lin, we're back home!\" Jenny cheered. \"We're not in Germany anymore with that sick twisted scientist.\" \"We're not attached to each other!\" Lindsay whooped for joy. \"We can bend our legs!\" \"And talk!\" \"And walk!\" \"And dance!\" \"And eat!\" \"And go to the bathroom!\" \"And we don't have to endure anymore beatings!\" \"Or yelling!\" \"Or operations!\" They cheered together, celebrating their freedom. Decided to leave it as just a kind of drabble, AU-ish one shot instead. I may expound upon it in the future, but as it stands, it's probably not going to get much work on it for a while. So, sorry to those who followed and I'll be sure to warn all of you in the future if I bring this back to life. And there you have it.

THIS IS THE GREATEST MOVIE I'VE EVER SEEN IN MY LIFE!\" \"Incy Wincy Spoilers climbed up the water spout.\" \"There's…there's…\" the Bum chuckled in disbelief. \"There's this…this is the silliest movie I've ever seen that's not intentionally funny!\" \"I think.\" \"There's this EVIL German doctor who likes to perform these EVIL surgeries, so he decides to go and stitch up his dogs by connecting their mouths to their anuses.\" \"BWA, HA-HA-HA! But it doesn't work out and they die.

It's a lot better than being a penis.\" \"I heard that!\" The high-pitched voice of the Bum's talking penis remarked. \"SHH!\" \"So the EVIL German doctor kidnaps this fat truck driver who just so happens to be in the neighborhood…\" \"Then we cut to these two young ladies who are driving in the middle of the night to this dance club. When all of a sudden, they're lost! And what's worse, their tire bursts and they can't call anyone with their cell phones because there's no signal!\" \"That's the most original scenario I've ever seen! Unless you count Friday the 13th, Halloween, and every other senseless slasher movie made in the 80s.\" \"So then this fat German dude drives by and sees them, and he's like-\" \" Ya ich schtein furt unt ein stein nacht ick david hasselhoff!\" \"And the ladies are like-\" \" Wha…?\" \"And the German dude is like-\" \" Aw, to hell with you sluts.\" \"So he drives away and the ladies wander off into the woods in the rain, where they stumble across this house made entirely out of chocolates, lollipops and all sorts of tasty-gorgeous candy!\" \"Or was that just my crack fantasy?\" \"Either way, the EVIL German doctor lives there, and he invites the ladies into his comfortable home, where he comfortably drugs them so that they could be part of his next experiment.\" \"I was in an experiment once! Doctors said they wanted my urine sample, but I ended up drinking it because I thought it was Gatorade.\" \"So the ladies wake up in these beds right next to the fat truck driver seen previously, and the EVIL German doctor comes in and is like-\" \" You're no good, anymore. I will inject you with this dangerous liquid that I don't even know the name of.\" \"And the fat truck driver is like-\" \" Who, me?\" \" Yeah you, Porky.\" \"So the EVIL German doctor gets a replacement, and it's this non-English talking Asian guy, who doesn't know what the hell's going on! And while the EVIL German doctor is explaining his experimental procedures, the ladies are like-\" \" NO! Please, don't do this!\" \"And the Asian guy's shaking in his bed and is like-\" \" Kore ga nanda koto iu jya nai darazo ura!\" \"So one of the ladies breaks free, but instead of running away to find help…\" the Bum stopped to hold his giggles. \"…now get this! She ACTUALLY goes back into the basement to free her unconscious friend, and wouldn't ya know it, she gets caught…AGAIN!\" \"Way to go, Nancy Drew!\" \"So the EVIL German doctor pulls out all these teeth and skin and stitches the first lady's mouth to the Asian guy's anus, and the first lady's anus to the second lady's mouth. And whaddya get? A HUMAN CENTIPEDE!\" \"GYA, HA-HA-HA-HA-HA!\" The Bum collapsed to the floor in a painful fit of laughter, kicking his feet to the ceiling. \"So the EVIL German doctor takes his pet around the garden and feeds it dog food. At one point, the Asian guy needs to take a dump, and since his digestive system is connected, the lady, whose mouth is attached to his anus, swallows all his crap up whole.

Okay "},{"Movie":"The Good, the Bad and the Ugly Il ...","Title":"Less Than a Fistful","Author":"Pantsman76","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9389697","Passage":"[Chapter 1] Less than a Fistful Garth Stetson looked over the canyon on which his horse stood. Underneath was a vast valley, with towns and lakes in the distance. He took off his hat, wiped his brow, and removed his eye patch. It was scorching hot out, and it made his face feel uncomfortable. He rubbed his dirty, scraggly head of hair. He'd been searching for days. Based on the information he'd received on his search, this was where he was supposed to be. He put the patch back on, covering the empty hole in his head. As he put back on his hat, he jumped off his horse. When he hit the ground, dust and dirt flew all around. It was about 2 o'clock now. His time would come any minute. He took a swig of water from his canteen. He had to be ready at a moment's notice. He went over to his saddle. With a quick flick of his wrist, a string was pulled, allowing a carpet of weapons to unroll and hang in front of him. Each of them was unique, and had a special purpose. He looked over each one, thinking about which would be best. Indecisive, he looked over the canyon again, at the road in the distance, thinking about the range of the weapon he should use. He moved back over to the saddle. The 1874 Sharps carbine had a large, powerful round. That would do it. He pulled it out, and grabbed a box of ammunition out of his saddle bag. He opened the breech of the rifle and pushed in a 50-70 Gov't. He closed it, aimed it at the road, and pulled back the hammer. As if on cue, his target began to ride through the road below. Garth drew in a slow breath and squeezed the trigger. Though the way down was a little treacherous, Garth made it down, found the body of his prey, and began to search it. It was him, alright. Charlie Ross. Garth drew the wanted poster from his pocket. One-hundred and fifty dollars dead or alive. An army deserter turned bank robber. Storing away the poster, Garth whistled for his horse. He picked up the body and threw it over his shoulder. He laid it on the back of the horse. Blood was on the shoulder of his vest. As he began to wipe it off, he noticed something shining over by where the body of the outlaw once laid. It looked like a bag. Garth cautiously walked over to it. Once he recognized what it was, he began to sprint. It was a sack of coins! He looked around nervously and grabbed the bag. He walked over to his horse, still eyeing around to make sure no one was watching, and laid it gently in his saddle bag, tucking it in tight. He climbed back on his horse, and pondered about where poor Charlie had gotten so much money. Bank-robbing? He must have. There was more than a month's worth of money in that sack. But it wasn't time to think about that now. Garth still had a mission to complete. He had yet to receive payment for his latest bounty. People stared at him as he slowly rode into the small town. The citizens of Lago were obviously not accustomed to fierce men riding into town with dead people lying on the back of their horse. His eye patch made his other eye stand out. It was focused on the sheriff's office. His beard, dirty and unkempt, displayed his experience and wisdom. They watched in awe as the cowboy hitched his horse in front of the sheriff's office, pulled the body off of his horse, slung it over his shoulder, and walked inside. This man was obviously not one to be reckoned with. Garth dropped the body right in front of the sheriff and handed him the poster without speaking a word. The officer didn't speak either. He just sighed and knelt down in front of the body. He studied the face on the body, comparing it to the one on the poster. After switching gazes between Charlie's face, Garth's face, and the face on the poster, the sheriff grunted. He made small, slow steps over to a safe tucked behind his desk. Garth stared him down as the sheriff seemed to take forever opening it. After what seemed like infinity, the sheriff rotated around and threw a stack of bills on the table between him and Garth. Eying the sheriff and the money, Garth picked it up and began to count it. \"Not enough,\" Garth muttered. The sheriff still gazed at him as Garth looked out the window to his saddle bag, which contained a bag with more money than he had just made. Money that had been made by robbery. Bank robbery. Charlie Ross had made more money robbing one bank than Garth had in one hunt for an extremely dangerous criminal. Garth slipped the money into his front pocket, and without looking back at the sheriff, or uttering another word, marched out the door. The citizens examined the strange man as he took long, determined steps out of the sheriff's office. The expression that came from behind his rustled beard and furrowed brow told them he was angry. This definitely was a fellow who you didn't want to be around when he was angry. He climbed up on his horse and trotted away. He passed over a hill in the distance, and was soon out of sight. Garth flicked his wrist, holding the string attached to his saddle. He looked at the vast array of rifles and carbines that unrolled before him. The 1866 Yellow Boy would be good. The brass frame shined blindingly in the sun. He took it, slipped it into the rifle holster on his back, and rolled the arsenal back up. He checked his six-gun. It was fully loaded. He pulled his bandana from his satchel and tied it around his long and messy face. All that was visible was one squinty, black, and intimidating eye. After checking his equipment, he sat down and laid back on the hill, closed his eyes, and took a short nap. He would need to be alert later. A figure came over the hill. The town of Lago looked as it came on a horse, spraying dust behind it as it sprinted onward. Was this the man who had been there not less than a few hours ago? Why was he chasing toward them? Lago was such a small town, it couldn't defend itself against such a man if he intended to do harm to its people. They only had two policemen! What were they going to do? Garth jolted his horse to a stop in the middle of the street. He drew the rifle from his back, his single eye scanning the area for trouble. He hopped off, rifle in hand, and ran over to the bank on his right. As soon as he burst inside he fired his rifle in the ceiling. Nobody was there to hear it but the teller. Garth struck the lever forward and back again as the empty cartridge hit the ground, making a sharp ping. The noise of the shell bouncing around on the floor filled the empty air, clinging endlessly for what seemed like eternity, like an orchestra of bells playing to a vacant crowd. Garth's hearing began to clear back up again. A barred door stood between him and the vault that held his prize. His fortune. \"Open it!\" he screamed to the coward of a man behind the bars. The teller came to the door, fumbling with his keys which flew around his hands. He struggled to fit the key into the lock, but he eventually got it. As he opened the door with a loud shriek, he met the eyes of the outlaw who stood before him. Was he going to die? Was this it? Would this man spare him? Who was he? Why was he doing this? Garth took his gaze off the cowardly banker, staring at the safe where all his money lay. Keeping his focus on his goal, Garth threw the banker into the wall where he curled into a ball and began to weep. Garth opened his satchel and pulled out one stick of dynamite, and a box of matches. He shoved the stick into a crevice in the vaults lock. He pulled out a match, struck it on his shoe, and lit the TNT. Drawing his pistol now, he walked back to the front of the building, pulling the banker along with him as he lay on the floor. The teller's big, spectacled eyes and long, bony face were covered by his skinny hands as he hid in shame. Garth muttered at him, \"Get outta here, coward.\" The teller ran off screaming and crying into the street. Garth pointed his revolver at the door, laid his palm on the hammer, drew it back to full cock, and pulled the trigger. As soon as he drew his hand back, the hammer would strike forward, hit the primer, ignite the gunpowder, and send a bullet flying forward towards the opening of the door. The inexperienced sheriff rushed inside, eager to defeat his new opponent. Garth drew back his hand. A bullet whizzed through the air, striking the young sheriff in the heart. The sheriff's Peacemaker slipped out of his fingers, and he grasped his chest. He stumbled around, trying to grab something to keep himself steady. Blood began to trickle onto the floor from the hole in his tin star. The sheriff took one last look at the bounty hunter and regretted not paying the full amount. With one last sigh, the lawman fell to the floor, dead. Behind Garth, the dynamite blew, sending shrapnel throughout the back room. Keeping his eye on the door for another moment, and taking a quick glimpse at the bloody body of the sheriff, he holstered his handgun and went to the safe. Three bags, filled with dollars and coins, called out to Garth as he grabbed them with his left hand. He smiled crazily underneath his bandana as he realized that he was much richer than he could ever dream. Bags in hand, Garth traveled to the very back part of the building, where a door lay in wait for his escape. He redrew his pistol and cocked back the hammer. Kicking the door open, he pointed it side to side, seeing no one. Thinking it was safe, he stuck it back in his holster, and whistled for his horse. Just then, a stray bullet struck on the empty land that lay in front of him. He was being shot at from above somewhere. He pulled out his rifle took cover behind the back of the building to his left. The rifleman was probably on top of the bank. Garth drew in a deep breath as he spun around the corner with his sights on the bank's roof. The rifleman's silhouette stood out as it stood triumphantly in front of the sun, rifle aimed. As Garth pulled the trigger, the silhouette stumbled down, falling off the roof of the bank, and on to the dusty, dry ground below. His badge gleamed in the sunlight. Garth's horse came to him from around the corner, its silver fur glistening like gunmetal. The outlaw opened the saddle bags and threw the bags of money inside. He then pulled himself up on top of the animal. He pulled down the rag that covered his face. He breathed in a sigh of relief as the air hit his cheeks, cooling them down, like a bucket of water had just been poured on his face. The townspeople watched from the windows as Garth, with one wipe of his brow, rode back into the middle of town, and began to trot the opposite way from which he came. In his fit of rage and robbery, the outlaw Garth Stetson had committed his crimes in a town where his face was known, even if he did where a bandana during his spree. Being a bounty hunter of such professionalism and efficiency, it wasn't long before the county authorities knew exactly who had committed such horrendous acts of brutality. Such a dangerous man would require a special squad of men to take down. The best bounty hunters in the state were formed into a posse to hunt down the menace. Five-hundred dollars dead. That was the only way they wanted him. This killer must be killed. There was no other way to do it. The peace and quiet the empty barn pleased Garth, who sat on an old bale of hay, contemplating his escapade. He had made a promise to himself early in life that he would never kill anyone that fought for what was right. He had broken his promise. Hadn't he? The old sheriff he killed didn't give him what he deserved for working so hard to find his target. But then again, he was only an old man trying to do his duty to the people he had sworn to protect. And the deputy. Garth had caught a glimpse of him as he lay in a grotesque position on the ground before the bank. He was young and innocent. Garth could tell. Just like him before he became a killer. What had he done? His rage and greed led him to stealing, hatred, and murder. Cold-blooded, ruthless, and gruesome murder. But what could he do now? What was done was done. What could he do? His actions had led him to almost certain death. He stood up and walked over to the door at the front of the barn. He stuck his single eye up to one of the cracks in the wood. A covered wagon sat in front of the door, with a mysterious object in the back. Around it were about twenty armed men. Pistols, rifles, shotguns, you name it, it was all there. It was clear they were here for one thing. It was time to face justice. Garth was at peace. His killing days were over. Now, it was time for him to face death. Pushing the doors open, Garth marched into the deathtrap. The mysterious object in the wagon that faced the door was a Gatling gun. Its barrels, all pointed at Garth, began to rotate. Before he could mutter a word, every hunter in the battalion unleashed a hail of gunfire onto their target. Each man fired until their magazine was empty. The bounty hunter fell to the ground. His gruesome body laid in front of the posse. As a pool of blood began to form around the former outlaw's body, the bounty hunters contemplated how they would divide up the money.

The Wandering Coyote Author's note: I'm a believer that chronologically the films go in order of The Good, The Bad and The Ugly to A Fistful of Dollars to For a Few Dollars More, so this particular fanfic is set - as a vague marker - some time after the events of The Good, The Bad and The Ugly. The Man with No Name is a wonderful antihero. I love the slight but subtle character development he experiences during the trilogy, as we see him evolve from a cruel and remorseless killer to a man who pauses to comfort a dying soldier or free an enslaved woman, who can perhaps come to value human life and honour in the harsh American West. But as I wrote this fanfic I was very much aware that he is still a man rooted in crime and death. He is by no means a flawless hero: the land he inhabits does not enable him to be. By the end of The Good, The Bad and The Ugly, Blondie has earned himself a small fortune of $100,000. One unexplained mystery in the trilogy is why he would work for money in A Fistful of Dollars if he was already a rich man. Personally, I believe the Man with No Name has lost his money somehow between these two films. I don't believe a man like him could hold onto such a large amount of gold for too long, as he will always be a penniless wanderer at heart. As for the \"coyote\" part of the title: the more I learnt about coyotes, both as a creature and a symbol, the more I drew parallels between them and the Man with No Name. The coyote is well-known in Native American mythology as a sly trickster, determined on getting his way, but also capable of great compassion. I also thought that it was apt to draw comparisons between the scruffy, untamed appearance of both subjects. :) The Man with No Name does not seek friendship or close companions. He does not seek heroism or renown. He does not seek connection, understanding, approval, redemption. He is not a wholly good man, but neither is he a wholly bad one. He is not classifiable in any of the simple ways people like to classify each other: he is not the clean-shaven hero, the dark monster hiding in his cellar, the giddy young man out to prove himself. He is not a bandit - not a champion - not a figure easy to discern. These are all the things he is not. He is a figure who consists of shadows and ambiguities. The Man with No Name is a trickster coyote, one who has broken away from the pack. He is a coyote, wily, scruff, lean and mean. When he sidles into town on horseback with the sun beating down, he is not looking to win admirers. He plays by his own rules. He spits his cigarillo away like it is of particular annoyance to him, but he will light up a new one only minutes later. He eyes stray around as freely as bullets when he takes in new surroundings. His gun is for hire, but his loyalty is not. And various other services may also be on offer in the right circumstances. It is not uncommon for impressionable young girls to trail him with hungering eyes, day dreaming of wild romances with wild men. If encounters take place, he does not make much of them. He is a drifter, and if he desires company it is only fleeting, with girls who are too eager to refuse. He is lone, but he does not appear to be lonesome. The elders in these towns cannot understand such schoolgirl obsession with dangerous strangers. The Man with No Name does not care - he passes on with a smirk. The life he leads is not an easy one to understand, much like himself. In such treacherous lands, where drought and heat can be as deadly as thieves and brigands, most people seek the security of small towns and settlements, of family communities and mutually supportive societies where safety in numbers is the only saving grace. The badlands of the West are not lands to traverse alone. Here, lawlessness is king. And yet wanderers do exist - mainly aggressive young men who ride fast, fight hard, and die too soon. Those who are settled wonder what kind of a life such solitariness can provide. The Man with No Name cannot provide an answer to that, but this is the only way he knows. Like a coyote he is strong and harsh. Born and raised upon the unforgiving land of the Wild West, he is no more able to change his instinctive ways than the coyote is able to sit down in a saloon and play poker. The Man with No Name stands alone in a barren land, surrounded by winds of red dust, broken carriages and screeching vultures, but he does not falter. The Man with No Name is stuck halfway between hero and outlaw, reluctant to make commitment to either side. As he enters this particular settlement the townspeople disappear through closed doorways and shaded archways, slinking away as though ashamed of their shabby colony. All townships along the Western frontier look innately foolish, thinks the stranger: small outposts huddled together on the endless prairie, pretending to be legitimate settlements when they are merely disordered specks upon bare terrain, battling against colossal forces of rage, greed, and fire, both on the scorching plains and within the human soul; the last barrier protecting the cultured East from the savage West. He brings his mount to a slow trot. His dark eyes say he is trying to weigh up if it could be worth his while to stop in this dusty old town. A man sidles towards him, with hastily stifled reluctance, as stifled as the hot midday air. These people don't want dark and dangerous strangers threatening their fragile way of life. They'd just as rather be left well alone, thank you and good day. The stranger looks down upon the approaching gentleman. A dull sheriff's badge glints unconvincingly from his shirt, and his moustachioed face is set in a suitably serious mask. This wandering coyote does not need to hear what the sheriff has to say: he has heard it many times before, and he can conjure the words in his own head. So he continues on, through the town centre, scouring his glare across building and dry earth alike. The sheriff watches after him, arms crossed. The Man with No Name thinks he may find somebody willing to hire him here. There is a saloon, a store, and one or two more stately houses where wickedness is likely to lurk in extravagantly furnished corners. Surely someone will have a bounty to offer, or an unpleasant errand to propose. One thing he has learnt on his travels: the more order is present, the more anarchy it will inevitably breed. If he were a rich man, he would have no need to pass through towns such as these, toiling for dollars. He had riches once, briefly, he remembers still, although that memory is aging and lingers on his tongue like aging tobacco. He had plans once too, but now he knows better than that. Better to take what life gives you and run with it, run far away before misfortune or justice can track you down. Plans can only be shattered - never fulfilled. But he does not waste time on regret. As the stranger is passing the saloon, he hears a commotion from within, of breaking glass and desperate shrieks. It is the music of the West. Suddenly a woman tears through the saloon doors, leaving them swinging in an erratic tangent, where they are stopped forcibly by the dark silhouette of a man. She races past the stranger's horse, and it shies away before he can control it. The man from the saloon steps onto the street, his gun already cocked, snarling like a feral wolf. He is bellowing an almost indiscernible string of obscenities towards the cowering woman. \"You filthy bitch! You second-rate whore, you dirty demon woman!\" The Man with No Name takes quick stock of the situation. The woman has taken advantage of her circumstances and hides trembling behind his horse, out of sight of the enraged man. He swings his arm, motioning violently for the stranger to get out of the way. \"Move aside, amigo.\" \"Why are you yelling at this woman?\" \"I really don't think that concerns you, you bastardo. Move!\" But the tall coyote of a man stands his ground, his black horse shifting to better conceal the woman. His eyes are dark slits and their intent is shadowed by the brim of his hat. The infuriated man cannot really believe this idiot outsider is getting involved. By now a hushed crowd has begun to gather by the saloon, and the stranger can feel the eyes of the sheriff piercing the back of his head. He gestures with his head towards the saloon. \"Go back inside.\" This stranger's voice is so hushed and calm, so authoritative without being raucous, it seems like a direct insult to the other man's vicious cries. It only serves to madden his foe even more. He grimaces, exposing teeth like wolfish fangs. \"I'll do whatever the hell I want! She's my wife, and if she chooses to go sleeping around like the sluttish hussy she is then it's only right that I discipline her. I won't tell you anymore. Get out of the way.\" The man advances on the stranger and his horse, eyes blood red like hellfire. Coolly the stranger folds back his sarape and takes his pistol, cocks it, and aims it in the man's direction. Now they both freeze. They have created a shallow cross in the centre of the street, a disruption at the heart of this sleepy town. Only the woman's ragged breathing can be heard. Both wolf and coyote stare each other down. They fondle their weapons. \"Now, the smart thing to do in this situation would be to head inside,\" says the Man with No Name. \"I only hope you've got enough brains to make the right decision.\" The other man falters. He seems to be weighing up his pride with his life. But perhaps it is not much of an choice; in this chaotic territory a man's life can only truly be measured by reputation. If his life has no worth, pride can at least bring him value and comfort in his own heart. An eagle calls out from high above. The stranger's horse shifts on its legs, a warm wind stirs the sand in the street. The angry man makes his decision, twitches his finger, is too slow for the stranger, takes a bullet to the chest before he can react, and in a heartbeat and cloud of gunsmoke he is dead. The Man with No Name takes a moment to survey what he has done, then holsters his pistol. The newly deceased crumples to the ground. A patch of bright red seeps into the dust around his body. The stranger knows he cannot stay here now. He must move on, before his actions can cause him trouble. If he feels any remorse for his behaviour, it does not show, and the townspeople sense that he would not hesitate to do the same thing again. In fact it was something of a similar circumstance, almost painful in its ironic parallel, which caused him to lose the elusive fortune which he has been chasing ever since. He had had so much, more than most men could dream of. But the right of possession is only an imprecise idea in these lands, and he knows it well, and if the money belongs to other men now it is through some fault of his own, so he cannot mourn the loss. Just as this dead man can only attribute his death to his own foolishness. It is difficult to say how the inhabitants of the town as a whole feel about what has just transpired. The crowd at the saloon is beginning to disperse, some of them gazing at the stranger with awe and admiration, others with arresting fear, others with raw disgust. The body in the street looks back up at its killer in disbelief. The surviving duelist strikes a match upon the leg of his jeans, then lights up a cigarillo. He urges his horse forwards past the watching people, past the corpse, past another quiet town he has left behind on his travels. He wonders if he is a fool for drifting while aspiring for stability, for toiling for dollars while so freely partaking in activities which rid him of them. And perhaps worst of all, for killing and murdering and betraying the minute, hopeful warmth within him that perhaps a certain honour can exist in even the most ruthless of men. But killing crooks is nothing. The stranger should know, because he counts himself as one; all bloodthirsty and brutal, the lot of them, without a hope or a virtue between them, and he is no different. But killing innocents - women and children - well, that's something else. They aren't signed up for a life of immorality, aren't yet sinners or felons, and they don't deserve to suffer the consequences. Taking the life of an innocent is a sin no man can easily be forgiven for, a blood which is harder than most to purge from the skin. A life may be a life but this stranger knows that some are worth more than others. This is why he never regrets, why he never falters. If he has one law to live by, it is only one, and this is it. When you must kill, kill without guilt, but never kill the pure. The late man's wife is sobbing softly. Her muted lament follows the Man with No Name as he rides back out of town as quietly as he arrived. The earth is dusty and the sky dustier as the wandering coyote continues on across the sprawling scrublands, sarape on his back, cigarillo in his mouth, warm pistol at his side. He stands halfway between here and there, forever in the middle, never quite reaching his destination. Like the coyote he is adaptive and enduring. Like the coyote he is a nomad, a restless roamer unable to defy instinct or the solitary beat of his own pulse. He is alone, alert, alive. These are all the things he is. ","Summary":" .

Un recueil de textes courts sur l'univers de la Trilogie du Dollar de Sergio Leone nous plongeant dans un instant ou une pensée des protagonistes de l'histoire, avec une prédilection marquée pour Et quelques Dollars de plus Et pour quelques dollars de plus Ce thème, ce bruit, ce carillon obsédant qui ne le quitte pas, qui est là pour lui rappeler qu'il a échoué... Ce texte a été écrit dans le cadre des Nuits du FoF sur le thème \"Thème\". (Rappel des règles : 1 thème pour une 1 heure entre 21h et 4h du matin) Non mais franchement, j'étais là en train de chercher une idée et je n'arrivais à rien et puis allez savoir pourquoi je suis partie me laver la tête et là, j'ai la musique du carillon de cette fichue montre qui m'a \"assailli\" et je me suis dis... \"Oh ben voilà un thème pour le thème\". Comme quoi y a bien que la Nuit qui nous fais écrire des trucs pareils ! Bon et dans le doute, je préfère ouvrir un recueil ! En espérant que cela vous plaise Bonne lecture PS : Au fait j'ai commencé à faire du tri et à remettre de l'ordre dans mes publications en faisant une sorte de table des matières dans mon profil alors n'hésitez pas à y faire un tour ;) . Montre et carillon Là où la vie n'avait pas de valeur, la mort, parfois avait son prix. C'est ainsi que les chasseurs de primes firent leur apparition. C'était quelque chose qui collait bien à l'esprit du colonel Mortimer, même s'il savait tout de suite que c'était aussi une façade. Il y avait une chose bien plus violente qui l'animait, une chose qui le reprit aux tripes dés qu'il se pencha sur le corps de l'Indien pour prendre cet objet qui symbolisait tellement de choses pour lui. Dés qu'il lutta contre un frisson et qu'il ouvrit cette montre. Dés que le carillon tinta à ses oreilles avec une violence surprenante. Dés que ce thème entêtant et entêté le ramena à ce jour maudit. Oui, ce sentiment qui l'avait animé derrière son masque d'impassibilité ce n'était pas l'envie de Justice, c'était la Vengeance. Il le savait… Il la sentait encore le consumer lentement, même si l'objet de sa haine était mort… Et ce thème qui résonnait dés qu'il posait les yeux sur cette photo en noir et blanc, participait à ce sursaut de rage froide qui l'avait fait avancer. Il se souvenait… Oh oui… Il se souvenait du corps de sa sœur, de son corps recouvert de sang… De ce geste de désespoir qu'elle avait eu pour échapper à son bourreau, mettant fin à ses jours alors qu'il abusait de son corps. Il se souvenait de sa fureur, de son désespoir de n'avoir pu la sauver, elle qui n'était que beauté, bonté et joie de vivre. Il se souvenait de sa promesse de vengeance, de tout ce qu'il avait renié pour cette traque, de cette étiquette de chasseur de primes qui ne lui allait même pas. Contrairement au Manchot, il se moquait bien de la prime ! Ce qu'il voulait s'était étancher sa vengeance et voir ce porc mort à ses pieds, une balle entre les deux yeux, tout en priant pour que cela l'apaise… Mais non, cela n'avait rien d'apaisant… Cela ne changeait rien au final… Elle ne reviendrait pas. Elle était morte. Il lui avait pris et rien ne pourrait changer cette tragédie… Et surtout pas ce thème… Ce thème récurrent, obsédant, entêtant qui ne cessait de jouer tant qu'il gardait cette montre ouverte au creux de sa paume. Un thème qu'il ne pourrait jamais oublié. Un thème qui serait lié à jamais à la mort. C'était dingue comme un simple bruit, un simple carillon pouvait faire plus mal qu'une balle. D'un geste il referma la montre, faisant taire ce bruit assourdissant avant de jeter un dernier coup d'œil au corps de l'Indien et de s'éloigner, laissant au Manchot la prime qui allait son cadavre… Il s'en moquait bien de la prime. Il voulait juste le voir mort pour apaiser ses remords et faire taire ce fichu carillon, ce thème fantôme qui sonnait encore à ses tempes quand il enfourcha son cheval pour disparaître.

Well if you've never done any of the above or aren't planning to, then the West isn't the place for you I can assure you. The modern day man takes a gun everywhere, fearing constantly that he'll suffer a jump from some posse or another. In this world there are people who take the law into their own hands, vigilantes and lynch mobs alike, but the real law in the West is: \"The man who bakes the bread must protect the wheat, water and yeast by his own hand, lest it be taken from him utterly.\" The view comes in on a small town, which is composes of generic buildings in the west, a saloon, stables, several houses, a sheriff's office, a gunsmiths, a doctors and a train station. Then the heaving noises of the 19th century steam train can be heard and down the rail line the head lights of the mentioned strain approach the station. The train slows to a standstill and is followed by a long hissing. The controller steps off of the train and blows his whistle. Controller: Bedrock Town! Next station; North Ridge! People begin stepping off of the train, both well dressed and some skanky looking figures are amongst the passengers who step onto the platform. Then at the edge of the platform a pair of brown leather riding boots step onto the platform. The camera moves up the man showing him to be wearing dark riding bottoms, the tail of his long brown coat is also shown, he wears a satchel, a bullet belt, a repeater carbine on his back, a holstered revolver at his side, a white and red shirt, a leather over vest, a red ascot and a dark brown desperado hat. He has light stubble on his face; he has sharp yet attractive blue eyes. He then puts a cigar in his mouth and strikes a match against his sleeve and lights the cigar he takes a drag from it and then exhales, he looks at the town with his hands on his hips. Man: Even in the daylight this shit-hole doesn't look any better. I hope Miguel hasn't skipped town. The man steps away from the edge of the platform and walks towards the town. The view then switches to the town, the man is walking down the buildings in the shade. Some men and women look at him, he simply glances back at them and they turn away. He then takes the cigar from his mouth and throws it aside. He leans out to see ahead, he is nearing the saloon doors. He steps up to them when suddenly he hears the screams of a man. He looks up and his eyes widen. The man then steps aside as the other man flies down and hits the floor with a grunt and a thud. The young man then looks up. A girl dressed un-modestly looks down at him. She has brown curly hair and dark tanned skin. She gasps as she sees the young man's face. The view then switches again. A chubby hand is shown with a smoking cigar in it leaning on a desk. The person is wearing a white suit and is facing a door over a desk. There is a knock at the door. Man in White Suit: Enter! The girl walks in with the young man. Girl: Miguel, I think you will want to see this person. Miguel: I very much doubt it Veronica, but whatever, they found me in a decent mood- Miguel then notices the young man and he pauses. Miguel: Shit... Man: Buenos Dias, Miguel. The young man takes his hat off revealing his brown hair, he then grins. Miguel: Veronica leaves us. Veronica looks between them both with fear. She then however turns away and closes the door behind herself. Miguel: So, you came crawling back eh? Man: Not quite, I caught the train. Miguel: Ah, so you've taken to modern transport rather than ride like it is done so out here eh? Man: Give me reins any day Miguel, but you needn't be worrying about that. The Man draws his revolver and points it at Miguel. Man: Because I'll be leaving this town... Miguel raises his hands and a sweat bead drips down his temple. Man: ...With the prize. He releases the grip on his revolver and lets it hang from his finger. Miguel smiles and begins to laugh, the other man joins in. Miguel then stands up and walks over to the young man open armed. They share a hug of greeting before releasing each other. Miguel: Reilly Edward Daniels, the Red Ranger. It's been to long amigo. Reilly: It has Miguel; business is good I take it. He points over his shoulder at the door. Miguel: Ah yes, it truly is, this town is on the half way point to the cow town, and I just take in the wages and business of the drivers seasonally. I can't complain amigo. How about you? Still working the bounty hunter game si? Reilly: I do take in the occasional bounty yeah, but I've moved on now. Miguel: Good good, don't need young men like you getting killed out there now do we eh? Reilly shrugs and Miguel chuckles before looking down at the pistol, he grabs it and ispects it as he walks over to his desk and sits behind it. Miguel: Hmm, swing-out chambers, on heavy barrel, fitted grip...customised? Reilly: Just the grip, I just swapped out the pieces. Miguel then aims it and closes an eye. Miguel: Hmmm, well balanced, looks like it could fire an easy 250 feet. Reilly: 300 Miguel, looks like you're getting rusty. Miguel: What can I say? Being rich gets to you amigo. He sits behind his desk and motions to Reilly to sit on the opposite side. Reilly does so. Miguel then slides the gun over to him; Reilly catches it and holsters it. Miguel: Now I'm going to assume this isn't a social call eh? Reilly nods. Miguel: Who's the guy? Reilly: Norman Harris. I hear he was a big time bandit in these parts. Miguel: And you'd be right too amigo, but I'm not letting you get to him. Reilly sits forward. Reilly: Why the heck not? Miguel: Eh, amigo, chill, okay? Reilly holds his hands up in apology and sits back. Miguel: As I was saying, you cannot get to him because I know you'll kill him. And this man is a good contact for me, lets me know who's coming into town and all so I can \"advertise\". Reilly: Miguel this man is a killer. Miguel: Aren't we all? You won't sway me so easily amigo. Norman trusts me and me him. We have a lasting and weathered business relationship. So I'm not letting you but a revolver to his jaw, amigo. Sorry about that. Reilly: That's alright Miguel. I'll see you. Reilly stands up and turns to walk out of the office. Miguel: Hey, Reilly! Reilly turns to him. Miguel: No hard feelings eh? Reilly: Right Miguel, no hard feelings. Adios. Reilly opens the door. Miguel: Hey! Reilly at least have a drink eh? On me! Reilly stops and turns to him. Reilly: Sure. The view switches to the saloon bar, Miguel is sat with Reilly and both of them are leaning on the counter. The bar maid walks over; she is wearing a purple and white fitted dress, and has blonde tied up hair with blue eyes. She hands them both glasses. Her and Reilly's gazes meet. Reilly: Thanks ma'am. The barmaid smiles. Barmaid: No trouble, name's Linda Bernet stranger. Reilly: You've got French roots? Linda: Yeah on my pa's side. Reilly: I've been to France actually. Linda: It's my dream to get there someday mister, once I earn the money and more from working here. Reilly: Hey Miguel. Miguel turns around chuckling. Miguel: Si amigo? Reilly: How much you paying Miss Bernet here? Miguel: 15 dollars to the week. Reilly: Make it 20. Miguel chokes on cigar smoke. Reilly: Come on you cheap-ass Mexican. Miguel looks at him with a raised eyebrow, Reilly then grins at him Miguel then nods. Miguel: Alright then Miss Bernet, you got 20 to the week sound good? Linda: Oh yes sir. That sounds mighty fine. Miguel: Good, now do a strip tease. Linda: Heck no sir, you ain't getting around me so easy. Miguel hits the table in defeat. Linda nods and smiles at Reilly. Linda: Thank you Mister... Reilly: Daniels, Reilly Daniels. Linda: Reilly. She looks at him endearingly for a moment before looking away and getting back to work. Miguel: Is there any woman you can't have over your knees amigo? Reilly turns around and leans back on the bar. Reilly: Of course. Those I don't want over my knee, and the posh tarts from the eastern cities. Miguel: Ah, you've had a taste of the eastern cuisine. Miguel chuckles. Reilly: Yeah...I spat it back onto the plate without remorse. Miguel: Ah, I love this life. This segment of time is a time of opportunity amigo. We got it all ahead of us. Reilly: That's certainly one of the truths Miguel...one of them... To be continued...

This is my new fanfiction in which Blondie and a female OC are paired. I know. No flaming necessary because barely any romance will be played until the end. It's mainly Tuco, Blondie and Eleanor trying to find the gold on Sad hill. I hope you like it, please review! I do not own The Good, The Bad, And The Ugly. Faster. I tried, but my feet could only take me so far. If I didn't get away from him, I wouldn't be able to get the money to Stanton. \"Shit!\" And down I tumbled. The hem of my fairly revealing dress caught on a rock, and I was defenseless, and just waiting to be slaughtered. If he wanted me dead so bad, then why didn't he do it when I was in the flesh? But no, he had to send his goons (seven of them) after me. A Harmless girl. Well, I'm not sure if you want to call me harmless. \"GO! We've got the girl!\" A round, squat man with a filthy mustache approached me, and grabbed my chin with a grin. I noticed he had five missing teeth, and he was so close that I smelled his breath, which smelled of alcohol. \"C'mmon, let's have our way with her, first!\" Another fat man laughed. I shuttered. \"Let me go, pig.\" I bit his finger. He dropped me with a couple of words in Spanish that could NOT have been decent. I went to stand and run, but before I knew it, ropes were surrounding me, and I blacked out. \" Let me go! You bastard! Let me free, I swear, I'll give you anything. A fancy night, anything! You swine!\" I cursed, and kicked my feet, trying to escape. I suppose after all the crimes, they had finally caught me. And on the rope I went. \" Eleanor, Yvonne, Straton, Johnson. Guilty of robbery to: banks, homes, civilians on the street, sheriffs. Charged with many cases of murder, including prostitution with murder following, robbery-murder, smuggling money from other countries, and murdering Robert .J. Straton, your ex-husband.\" I gave a miserable laugh. \"Sounds about right? I'm sorry, but you forgot about the murder of the man reading the list.\" I threatened. \"Proceed, Let god have mercy on her soul.\" And he walked out. \"YOU BASTARD!\" I screamed. And they let go. My oxygen supply was getting cut off. Fast. My face was turning red. I was really going to die, wasn't I.?. The sound of a gun blasting gave me temporary shellshock. And before I knew it, I was on the ground. The rope was shot… The rope.. Was.. THE ROPE WAS SHOT! I took off running as fast as I could. I heard the gasps of men and the cat calls of other criminals on the street. Probably because my dress was hiking up. Who the hell cared? I was getting my ass out of there! I was about to jump on my horse when another shot rang. Right next to me. \"You've got yourself quite a background, miss Johnson.\" I turned to see a man with sandy brown-blonde hair. I frowned. \"And still, even for saving your life, not an ounce of gratitude.\" I sighed. \"One night, that's all I'll give you.\" I glared. He lit a cigar. \"I'm not here for that, miss Johnson. You have information, I need it. We're partners until I get what I want.\" He said. I swore he was biting that damned cigar. \"Give me one of them,\" I said, pointing towards his cigars. \"Then I'll help ya'.\" I laughed. He frowned but gave me one. \"So, what do ya' need help with?\" I asked, after taking a few puffs. He swallowed, and turned and looked for people in the nearby vicinity. \"I need to know..\" He trailed off, but mounted his horse. \"They're looking for you.\" I gave a sharp intake of breathe. I jumped on my horse. Should I follow him? He gave me no indication he was GOOD. But… Why did he have to be? I'm no ways near the title 'good'. I rode off in his direction. \"Where are we going?\" I asked loudly, trying to gain attention of the man. No answer. Until, \" To get money. And he's worth two-thousand dollars.\" I lit a cigar.

They all knew the name of the cemetery, but only Blondie knew the name on the grave. \"200 000 dollars is a lot of money. We´re going to have to earn it.\" Blondie said challenging them into a dual…They were all after the treasure, but only one could get his hands on it. But which one of the three? Sad Hill Cemetery Angel Eyes had arrived at the Sad Hill Cemetery. Now, he knew he needed to find the two, who knew the name on the grave…Blondie and Tuco. It didn´t take long for him to find them. He caught the two in front of a grave…\"Arch Stanton\"…was the name written on the grave…\"Arch Stanton\"…He noticed that Tuco was digging but Blondie was just standing there watching Tuco do his job. …but two could dig faster… He threw a shovel towards them, surprising them. \"Two can dig a lot quicker than one.\" he told them pointing his revolver at them \"Dig\" Tuco did what he was told, but Blondie just stood there, lighting his cigar. That made Angel Eyes ready to pull his trigger. As Tuco noticed that, he grabbed his shovel, ready to fight. Angel Eyes turned towards Blondie: \"You´re not digging.\" Blondie:\"If you shoot me, you´re not gonna see one cent of that money\" he answered calmly. His answer surprised them both. Angel Eyes:\"Why?\" Blondie:\"I´ll tell you, why…\" he told them and kicked the wooden cover off of the grave revealing only a skeleton…\"there´s nothing in there\" Tuco:\"You son of a…\" he shouted to Blondie lifting his shovel up ready to hit him. Blondie:\"you thought I could trust you?\" So, Blondie had it all. He was the only one, who knew the name on the grave. He had tricked them. Blondie:\"200 000 dollars is a lot of money. We´re going to have to earn it.\" Angel Eyes:\"How?\" Blondie looked around him, and picked up a stone. \"I'll write the name on the bottom of this stone\" Blondie looked at the gun that Angel Eyes was pointing at him. He wasn´t going to write anything on the rock while Angel Eyes had his gun. \"The gun\" Blondie said, and Angel Eyes put it away. After that Blondie started walking towards the square of the cemetery while writing the name on the stone. Blondie walked to the middle of the square, stopped and turned around, so that both of his rivals could see it, how he put the stone onto the ground…after which he straighten himself up, threw his poncho onto his shoulders revealing his gun belt. All this time he had been closely watched. He looked at them as he started to retreat slowly backwards. That was a sign that the battle between life and death had begun… A dual…for three… Then Angel Eyes took few steps forward, and that alerted Tuco. The two were staring at each other. Angel Eyes lowered his gaze only to be certain that Tuco wouldn´t use his gun too soon. He watched while Tuco slowly freed his gun to hang on his right side. Then Angel Eyes slowly started to walk, again. This time he turned around so that he could keep an eye on the two, while he was walking to take his place at one corner of the square. After he started to move, the other two did the same. It was all quiet, only separate croaks of the birds broke the silence. The three men slowly advanced to their positions, each one standing at one edge of the square, only a gunshot away from each other. The rock that would make any man happy, was in the middle of the square, and the one, who could draw fastest, would have all the money… This was worthy of it. All of it. It was still morning, but it was hot already. But it wasn´t the heat that made both Tuco and Angel Eyes sweating. It was the excitement and anticipation of the final battle…all three of them were now in position. Their gaze became more intense, their nerves were on the edge of bursting, but they all knew that this wasn´t the time for that…they needed to concentrate, keep a close eye on the two rivals, each in their own turn. The question was: Who would draw first? Seconds felt like hours as they watched each other, slowly their drawing hands started to advance towards their revolvers. Blondie was still holding his cigar in his mouth not making any expression… Angel Eyes slowly advanced his hand towards the gun on his belt… The moment drew closer… Then… The moment had come… They all grabbed their revolvers as fast as they could… It was Blondie, who fired the first shot, but he was only slightly faster than Angel Eyes. Tuco had pulled his trigger, but it didn´t do anything. He tried again, but nothing…it was empty; at that moment he realized that Blondie had tricked him, again: this time by taking his bullets off at some point without him noticing… Meanwhile Tuco was struggling with his gun, Angel Eyes, who had been injured by Blondie's bullet; fell onto the ground, right between the two newly dug graves. At that instant Tuco lifted his gaze towards Blondie, who was repairing to shoot again, and he had a sudden sense of fear, but Blondie didn´t seem to care about him: he had another target: Angel Eyes, who repaired to fire his revolver, again. But, just like the last time, Blondie was quicker, and his bullet killed Angel Eyes, who fell into one of the graves. Blondie then looked at Tuco… Then Blondie started to walk towards the middle of the square, towards the stone…Tuco watched, as he walked closer, at the same time firing his gun twice: first to shoot Angel Eye´s hat into his grave, second to accompany the revolver that Angel Eyes had dropped at the edge of the grave. Only then Tuco got angry, he ripped off his gun of his shoulders, seeing while Blondie smiled and reached the stone taking it into his hand. Tuco:\"You pig! You wanted to get me killed! When did you unload it?!\" Blondie:\"last night\" he said approaching Tuco and taking his revolver into his hand \"you see, there´s two kinds of people …my friend, those with loaded guns\" pulling the trigger of the empty gun…\" and those, who dig… you dig\" he looked at Tuco. Tuco:\"Where?\" Blondie showed Tuco the right grave. As they approached the grave, Blondie dropped Tuco´ s gun on the ground. The grave was right beside the grave of Arch Stanton…\"Here\" he said pointing at the grave. Tuco:\"Un…unknown\" he read the writing on the grave…\"there´s no name on it!\" Blondie:\"There´s no name here, either\" he said showing the other side of the stone. It was empty, he hadn´t written anything on it. \"You see, that´s what Bill Carson told me; it was the grave marked \"unknown\" right beside Arch Stanton\" he explained while taking a shovel and placing it onto the sand on top of the grave. Tuco:\"Eeh?\"He asked Blondie as he saw the shovel. Blondie:\"Go ahead\" Tuco started to dig, he was anxious to get his hands on the gold. He quickly cleared the sand that had been on top of the grave, opened the cover, took the gold packs from the grave and placed them onto the ground. Then he took the shovel and broke one of the packs revealing the coins. He was in ecstasy. So much money. Just for the two of them. Tuco: \"Blondie!\" he shouted happily \"It´s all ours, Blondie!\" \"Blondie?\" he looked up, and as he saw the rope hanging from the three his ecstasy turned into…fear? The gold coins flowed from his hands as he stood up. Tuco:\"You´re joking, Blondie. You wouldn´t play a joke on me like that?\" Blondie: \"It´s no joke, it´s a rope, Tuco. Now, I want you to stand up there and put you head into that noose…\" Tuco said nothing, but he knew Blondie was serious; he was pointing his revolver at him. Tuco silently got on the wooden gross, the same one that had hidden the gold. It was unsteady, put he was able to get on it, and then he put his head into the noose… Blondie tight first Tuco´ s hands on the back of his body, and then the rope around his neck. Tuco felt how the rope started to strangle his neck. He watched as Blondie took his horse closer to the square. Ready to leave… Blondie:\" Well… now seems just like in the old times…\" he said while approaching the packs…\"four for you…and four…four for me.\" he said as he put the packs onto the back of the horse. After that, he himself got on his horse. Tuco:\"Hey Blondie, Blondie…\" Blondie: \"Sorry, Tuco\" and gave a sign for the horse to start off… Blondie started to ride away, leaving Tuco all on his own on the unstable wooden gross. Tuco looked at the packs that were still lying there on the ground. Those were all his, but… Tuco:\"Blondie…\" Tuco:\"Blondie!\" he became more desperate. Surely Blondie wouldn´t leave him like that? Not on the unsteady gross, that would break anytime soon…or would he? Tuco watched as Blondie rode further away, eventually disappearing from his sight. \"Blondie!\"he yelled after him. Tuco:\"Blondie!\" …then, Blondie reappeared, now with a rifle, took a steady position, aimed…and shot the rope so that Tuco fell onto the ground, hitting his head on one of the packs… That made Tuco angry…Blondie was just… Tuco got up, and ran after Blondie as he rode away… Tuco:\"Hey, Blondie!\" he screamed after Blondie \"You know what you are?! Just a dirty son of a…\" a...a...a...a... AAAAAH…. The End.

It was clearly what appeared to be the week-long decomposed body of a man hanging off the back of a prairie schooner wagon, with a tattered cover, and broken wheels. Probably deliberately so, he had thought to himself. The oxen were long dead as well, again badly decomposed. The smell was nearly unbearable the closer he drew towards the ominous sight. He wrapped a navy blue bandanna around his face, and tried to cover the nostrils of his nose with his hands as he stepped closer to examine the corpse. At this point, his breathing was drawn in entirely by his mouth. The man seemed to be a rather well-off man; he was wearing a dark grey frock coat, trousers, tattered black leather boots, vest, and a cravat necktie at the time of his death, whatever the cause may have been. As he looked closer, he found the man's facial features hard to make out, due to the horrid mixture of dark green and grey on the tone of his skin. Besides these effects, the surface of his skin was also skeletonized in certain areas. He dared not to touch him. By now, he was terribly decomposed, so he could not make out the man's age, although his hand's appeared to be very wrinkled and calloused, what little he could make out that didn't seem to be the result of rotting in the heat of the Indian Territory. \"Must have been Indians,\" he thought to himself cynically, \"Can't say I'm surprised, I'm in their territory after all…\" The man passing through found nothing of interest he'd be willing to keep off the dead man's possessions. They were few that he spotted; a pocket watch visibly tucked inside of his vest, or waistcoat, a silver walking cane, fashionable in the eastern cities, and an old beaver felt top hat, one of which appeared to be reminiscent of the styles most common during the 1840s. Apparently, he must have owned it for many years, as the narrow brim was warped, the crown was tapered in a bit by the constant rains, and the hat itself was dusty and moth stained. He seemed to be a rich man, probably a gentleman of the eastern cities such as New York, Boston, or Atlanta, but one which did not care very much for keeping up with the latest fashions of the day, like a dandy. The lone rider thought it best not to interfere with anything; the wagon, the body, or the possessions inside. It was already clear what had happened, two possibilities, in which he had either been attacked by marauding Indians, or he had been held up by the roadside to be robbed and killed by outlaws from the United States. At the very least, he thought it would be decent to take off his hat and say a prayer. His hat was weather-worn, and showed signs of hard-wearing throughout the years he had owned it. It was a fairly narrow-brimmed gaucho hat, it must have been no wider than three inches, and it featured a telescope crown, with very subtle front pinches. The brim had its sides curled up slightly; a kettle brim, as it's called. After his regards for the deceased, he immediately left the ghastly scene. He must have spent no more than five minutes total, but what five minutes those must have been with the stench. For what seemed to be a long time, he rode his horse hard and fast; furiously. Time was too precious a commodity for him to waste out here in such dangerous country. He wasn't planning on any unnecessary encounters with hostile bandits or natives. The man then pulled out his pocket watch. The time was 4:38 PM. Knowing that there was going to be only three more hours of daylight, he started scouting for a location along the trail to spend the night. Preferably, he wanted an area that he had access to water nearby, and perhaps a den of rabbits, in which he could roast one over an open fire for supper. He was hungry, having not eaten since dawn. He was constantly on the move. He knew all too well why; to cash in his bags of Confederate gold that he had obtained from the Sad Hill Cemetery. He had defeated his two rivals there, also in pursuit of the buried Confederate gold. Greed had consumed all three men, and as a result, one met his end violently, although another had emerged from the struggle more fortunate, ultimately having four bags to himself, due to the winner's surprising and unexpected generosity. It was uncalled for, and perhaps even irrational. The good man felt it in his heart to reward one of his rivals, at times a companion during his travels, half of the loot for his efforts. This rival in particular, the Mexican bandit known as El Tuco, had made it far, granted. Nevertheless, he was ungrateful towards him in the end. About two hours later, he had already set himself up with a meal for the evening. He was hunting for small game, and ended up with a rabbit suitable for his meal. To supplement this, he had picked a handful of berries he knew to be edible, that he had found along the trail. After a hearty meal, he had gone to sleep. He first hitched his horse, making sure to reinforce his makeshift hitching post of a log, with rocks and sticks. It was not perfect, but could be enough to prevent it from escaping. Then he had used the leather saddle to function as a pillow to lean his head against, wearing his hat sitting lopsided on his head for additional warmth. It may have been August, but the nights were bitterly cold. To be continued.[Chapter 2] August 4, 1862 It must have been approximately 6:00 AM when he rose from his sleep, as rough as it had been out in the cold night of the Indian Territory. It was certainly an uncomfortable slumber, if at all. He knew that he had to be wary of hostile Natives. There were still rebellious tribes and bands of warriors, despite the Federal government allowing them land to settle in the region. Politics interested the traveler, but he was cynical and distrustful of the empty words that came out of rich, corpulent or rail-thin fops. People have a tendency to lie for their own gains. The game of politics, he knew, was very Machiavellian. The man may not have looked like it, but he actually received a decent education throughout his childhood years, and learned to read and write. This led to his foray into politics, history, and theology. Such knowledge was not very useful in the brutal frontier, though. Before the Civil War between the North and South, he had a job with a rancher herding and driving cattle along the Sedalia Trail to their destination. He had been a ranch-hand for two years, an experiences which had proved quite useful in shaping his ability to survive the almost-lawless, ruthless west. He respected the law, but was not afraid to take matters into his own hands; after all, plenty of bandits get away with a life of crime. What difference does it make to employ the use of less-than-legal methods in order to prolong one's life? For what seemed to be ten minutes, he still lay on the ground. The sun had already begun to rise from the east. \"Well, I'd better pack my things together and get moving. It'll do me no good, staying here...\" he thought to himself. He was on the verge of shivering, as it was a particularly cold morning, but his wool poncho had worked well-enough to keep him warm. He had found it in the ruins of what appeared to be a chapel, alongside a dying soldier. In an act of mercy and pity, he ended up leaving his trench coat on the dying man to keep him warm for his last few minutes of life, and offered him a side of his cigarillo too, that short cigar. He carried a pack with him on the saddle-bag; they were usually imported from Mexico, although they weren't too hard to find around town either, especially in the southwest. He rose from the dusty ground, put his saddle bags together, and mounted his horse. Before he really took off, he scouted the area, all-the-while searching for water, and letting his horse graze on the grass to eat. He reached for his pocket watch, and upon opening it, the familiar melody played while he was looking at the time. It was already 7:28 AM. He still had a whole day ahead of him, but if he wanted to cover any actual distance, he would have to make the effort to ride all throughout the day until dusk. His destination at this point was any well-to-do town in Texas that would accept his recently-found Confederate gold. He still had the sacks firmly placed on the saddle, although it was not too obvious as to what the contents were, to passersby, he would imagine. These sacks could just as easily be essentials to survival in the wilderness; food, water, a cup, plate, utensils, and maybe even a harmonica or flute. They were anonymous enough so as to not be suspecting to anybody but the more-determined bandit. Even so, he was skilled with a six-shooter. His Colt 1851 Navy revolver was one of his most prized possessions. It had a pattern of snakes engraved on the handle, and it was in good condition, despite having used it for several years. Whatever the case, he was calm, and self-assured that he could handle much of what may come his way, whether the circumstances were to be favorable, or troublesome. After glancing at his compass, he rode towards the direction of the southwest. Riding hard, he adjusted his weathered brown hat, turned the brim down to cover the sun from his eyes, and stared at the plains ahead. From the way it looked, it would be a long while before he would reach civilization. At 3:37 PM, he dismounted his horse, for there was another unsettling discovery. A charred \"prairie schooner\" wagon and three human remains lie on the ground. The man walked closer to inspect the carnage, and he had once again attributed this gruesome finding to be the work of Indian raiders. He looked at it with disapproval, at the same time readying himself for such advances. He knew he was handy with a gun, but likewise, the Natives were handy with their bows and arrows. Two of the remains he could identify as men, due to their ragged pants and shirts, while the other victim was a woman that wore a plain brown dress and white bonnet. All three of them were badly decomposed, charred from burns to the body, and must have been out in the elements for well over a week, not dissimilar to his first discovery of remains the other day. No money however, whether Union or Confederate, was to be found, and he had just decided it was time to move on. He knew that a marauding band of Indians was active in this region recently, if not still in the vicinity. They must have been nomads, but they still did not cover wide distances as in, say, the Great Plains Natives did up north. For the purpose of mentally preparing himself, he had just assumed that they could be spotted around at any given moment. He prided himself in his ability to be determined against all odds, and essentially omitted the concept of impossibility from his mind since an early age. He attributed much of his current experience from his service during the United States' war with Mexico about fourteen years earlier; the year of 1848 was a rough, yet powerful one in his life. He had emerged from the conflict a new man, willing more than ever to survive against all odds, and take on the challenges that life may present him. One of the most memorable moments during that war was when he had to escape Mexican captivity, the aftermath of which was not without blood being shed for the sake of his own freedom, as he had stabbed, then fired upon a total of seven troops as he had struggled to escape. He ended up taking a mount for himself to ride northward, and rejoin the rest of the U.S. forces. After this incident, he was never captured again, and he never actually got to be dangerously close to the enemy either. He ended up leaving the service shortly after the war to take up work with the ranchers of the Midwest, and herding cattle. The rest that followed was opportunity seeking, and taking the law into his own hands, although he had a brief partnership with the bandit \"El Tuco,\" freeing him after the beginning of his hangings, town after town. Ultimately, all of his past actions and experience were not without the rewarding benefits of a superior ability to use firearms and strategies for overcoming the hardships, so he was led to believe. After what seemed to be three miles of a distance away from the burned wagon, towards the southwest, the rider came across a creek. He decided to take this opportunity to replenish his supply of water. He had two metal canteens inside of a saddle bag, and that was all that he could carry at any given moment. He had to ration his water, and food carefully. His food at this point consisted of berries, a bit of corn, and salted meat, salted so as to preserve the quality for later preparation. He looked around the plains. Absolutely nothing, it seemed. No trees, but a number of bushes and tall grass and weeds. Inside of the creek, he spotted many fish, although he had no method in which to catch them. He would have to invest in a fishing pole at the next American settlement, and that would not be for another hundred or so miles, potentially. He did not want to risk being seen at a fort, as both the Union and Confederate Armies were drafting whoever they could muster, of the right age and strength. He happened to be eligible, but that would be redundant. He felt that he did his part in the war, although with another motivation in mind; the Confederate gold of Sad Hill Cemetery. If he becomes careless, a guard could ask to inspect his saddle bags, and his gold will have been given away. The more he thought of this, he felt reminded of the passage in the Holy Bible upon which he was raised, \"Naked came I out of my mother's womb, and naked shall I return thither: the LORD gave, and the LORD hath taken away; blessed be the name of the LORD.\" So it seemed true... that one is born with nothing, and leaves the world with nothing. However, when one gains, particularly money, one may do well to make use of it, rather than squander and waste it. At dusk, he hitched his horse to a strong, sturdy bush, and fortified it with large stones, so that his horse may remain for the next morning. He checked his pocket watch, the chimes let out their mournful, yet soulful melody, and it was 8:36 PM. The sun had just set by this time, as summer days are typically long, and he planned on waking up at just about the same time as the other morning, with the sunrise. Before his rest, he ate berries and some of his meat, preparing a bit over an open fire he had started half an hour before. He was quite sure of his survival abilities in the wilderness, and up to this point, they have served him well indeed. To be continued.

It was bright, and it took the man a couple of seconds to ajust his eyes, but in time, he could see everything in plain sight. He sat down at a chair across the table, and the lady threw a pair of keys across the table. Colin quickly grabbed them, and in quite under a half of a minute, he was out. \"Mr. Haze, Mr. Haze,\" the woman said. \"What have you done\" She said with a half smile, mentally noting to Haze that she had made a joke, almost. \"Actually, a lot of things. Why do you think I am still alive?\" said Colin. The woman leaned into the table. \"Look, Haze, we were just wondering why the world is wondering questions about the events that happened recently that we cannot answer. And every research piece on this whole entire crisis leads to you, Colin. Now start talking.\" The woman said in a firm tone. Colin laughed. \"So, Ms. Handolf.\" The woman looked with curiosity because only twenty people in the world knew her first name, if not last, and he was obviously not one of them. \"…How about you start talking, and explain to me why random people just looking like the people that killed my father, trying to kill me? Isn't that strange? What kind of stuff are you after, then bring in innocent people into the mess.\" said Colin. \"You are not innocent, Haze! Why do you think we brought you here!\" The woman said with a firm voice, not sounding like the woman she was two minutes ago. \"So, you want answers? Ok, you got them Somewhere in this freaking building, Joan! But if you want to hear what happened to the boy who lost his father twenty three years ago to some assassin, then you better listen pretty closely because that is all there is to my story!\" Said Colin, sounding even more firm, then he relaxed in his seat. The woman grabbed her notepad and tape recorder and pen. \"It all started years ago…\"[Chapter 2] Chapter One Colin sat in his bed, knowing he had to fall asleep sometime. The geography quiz was tomorrow and he could not miss a single minute of tonight's sleep. It was 10:30, and he was wide awake, knowing that he had to wake up nine hours from now. As much as young Colin didn't like school, he excelled in every class, and it seemed to be important to him. But it wasn't. His father was put on top of every single thing in his entire life. He loved him as much as his Father loved back. Mr. Haze was a police officer, and he was good at his job, too. But there was something about him, how he was very secret, but despite that, he always had time for Colin. It was his only son, and he loved him very much. Then, there was a break of a window. Colin sat straight up in his bed. This was unusual. Yes, on occasion, there was a doorbell at this time, but those were pranks. Somebody had meant to break the window. Colin slowly and steady got up, and put on his best super-spy shoes (that is what he called them) he put on to spy on people without making noise. Colin creeped down the hallway like a sly fox, with every sudden noise, he stopped, looked around in a circle, and then continued down. When he got near his parents' bedroom, he heard his parents. Terrified. Well Mrs. Haze was. The closer Colin got, the more clearly he heard. Sudden change in tone caused Colin to hear more and more words until he was directly next to the door. The door was cracked, and then Colin peaked in. There was a man, dressed in all black except for his gun, which was slightly grey. The window was broken, with a rope hanging inside. The all-black man was pointing the gun at Mr. Haze, and a faint peak of his wife behind him. Colin was awestruck on the sight. The man said no words. He just continued to point the gun at Mr. Haze. Mrs. Haze just stood there, whimpering in fright. Mr. Haze noticed Colin, and then quickly looked back at the man with the gun. But he was too slow, and the man noticed Colin. He let out a tiny yelp, and then Colin looked away. The man looked back at Mr. Haze, and then pulled the trigger. Mr. Haze collapsed to his knees, his eyes having a blank stare, and he fell to the cold, hard wood on the ground. Mrs. Haze screamed, and a gunshot went off, but then silence. The all-black man grabbed the rope outside of the window, and a helicopter residing on the roof took off in to the cold black sky, as a teardrop fell to the ground off a little boys face named Colin, because he was alone in the dark, evil world.[Chapter 3] Chapter Two Colin sat in the dark room, looking gloomy with his now cold breakfast right in front of him. Two police officers sat in front of him. Colin barely heard any words, and responded only with a yes for every question. \"..Gunshot...\" said the man at one point. The memory seeming as though it had happened a thousand years ago came clear back with the sound and the picture of his falling father pounding on the ground, the stare could go for a million miles. He had lost it all. Every tiny bit of it. He belonged to nobody. A tear drop fell on the table out of a blank face. No expression. Just tears. The two men got up and left Colin in the room alone. They stepped out and there faint resemblance showed that they were talking to many people. To Colin it had felt like an hour had passed. Then he had left. A day, maybe a week, maybe a month had past, thought Colin. He was sitting in his room. Wait no, he thought. There was a man, another man sitting in the room. He was dressed in a formal outfit with a eyepatch on his left eye. He had a war veteran hat from Vietnam on his head. \"Look, I knew your father...\" said the man. \"You didn't know me, but now you do. My name is Sgt. Johnson,\" said Mr. Johnson. Colin didn't understand any of these words, but he has not said any words for the past forty-eight hours, so this was not a surprise. Mr. Johnson sat up in his chair. \"What you saw two days ago was top secret, but we can't do anything about that..\" he said. Colin's memory came back to him like a cutting knife, but it was faded and seemed like it was years and years ago \"..But your fathers will told us to put you in custody of me\" said the man. The words came with shock. I will be in custody of this man, thought Colin. His emotions made the man tell he was confused. But the stern face on the man made Colin know that he was not lying. Colin went to open his mouth to speak. The dry air gave the instinct to Colin to close his mouth, even know in his head he was begging for answers. Who killed my father? Is he coming for me? Where am I? The assumed answers from Colin all did not fit. The man turned around and got a bowl of rice and passed it to Colin, and Colin's reflexes were a bit scratchy. He hated rice. But he couldn't say anything, for this could be the only meal this man has to make. Maybe for the rest of his life he will have this same meal. Colin mindlessly picked up the spoon in the bowl and scooped a tiny bit of rice. He brought it to his tongue. It burned like none other. He was screaming, inside his head. On the outside, Colin seemed to have no soul, and he didn't seem to be changing anytime soon. Colin didn't remember going to school. But he did, anyways. The students in the hallway were a blur. He was just standing in the middle of the hallway alone with books and a backpack. Seconds to minutes or maybe an hour he was in class. All the students were staring at him. They knew. They knew his father died. Chances are, thought Colin, they don't know how. It felt like he was the odd-one out. He wished he could curl under the desk, without people noticing. But even if he tried, everybody would know. The children didn't stop until the teacher got in, and gave a fake cough. Everybody quickly turned and faced him. The expression on the teachers face knew that he knew too. But the teacher was kind, not staring. It wasn't long until the recess bell rang, loud and clear. The room cleared out faster than a speeding racecar. Colin slowly got up, got his books, and almost got out the door if it was not for two men wearing a suit and tie with earphones, and anxious, staring children looking behind them, confused and interested.[Chapter 4] They walked as though they were controlled by a greater power. You could never tell whether they were happy or sad. They had no expression on their face. They paced in a straight line, unless the sidewalk curving changed. Colin was confused and scared, atleast for the first day. But the next year, he was fine. And the next. And the next. It never ended. Every day was the same. Every single day. Nothing happened. No friends came. He never went out to eat. He did nothing. Ever. For seven years, this happened. He made friends, lost friends, broke things, fixed things. His universe expanded at school, but at home, the same people came and go. There was a doorbell every month or so, but it was always a solicitator. Nothing happened until June 8th, 1993. Graduation. Prom. College. Worries. The words scrambled in his head as he walked down the hallway of Beachwood High School. Sgt. Johnson had told him that he was going to the police academy. But he could be lying. He knew for the past seven years that there had been mystery men walking through the house. But for all we know, Colin could be going to Harvard. Or maybe Yale. Or just a community college. Something that Colin learned is that he never made the desitions, never did the talking, never did anything. But sure enough, Colin received a letter from the Police Academy that indeed he was going. This was not his first pick. He would have gone to Ohio State University. That would be where Marcus is going, he thought. The fresh air of the outside of Beachwood High School felt great on his skin as he stepped outside. The men stood out in a crowd, like they usually do. But this time, they were with other men, strange men in uniform. He rushed to the group of people fairly quickly. \"Come on Colin, you are going to College\" said Mr. Johnson. \"Wait what? School ends in two days and my clothes and belongings are..\" Mr. Johnson interrupted him with an answer. \" All your belongings are with me. Your teachers and the school is informed. Now if you please step in the automobile\" said Mr. Johnson. He was pointed into a black limo with government plates. To Colin, it looked like a big dark hole to suck him in to a bloodcurling death. Colin got inside, and he tensed his stress with the comfy seats of the limo. The other men got inside. They started the car. The man in the front seat gave the men next to Colin a mental signal. The man grabbed a shot in his hand and slammed it into Colin's leg. Colin's hands began quivering, and then his eyelids started to close, with his eyeballs rolling back and forth, giving the impression he had seven years before.[Chapter 5] The loud noise banged into his ears. He was hallucinating. The blinding colors went back and forth, from red and green to blue and yellow. He let out a grunt of pain. His vision cleared up, and a bright light was right in front of his eyes. He couldn't see anything. Had he been in a accident, he thought. Then the car, the limo, everything came back to him. Why were they trying to kill him? Where they trying to kill him? He looked to the right of the light, and then rolled out of the mattress he was unconscious in. He was in a small hut, with light creeping in the cracks in the wall. There was a door, and on the door there was a note. Colin picked up the note, and read it. You are to complete the challenge. Travel across the mountain region within two days. Meet us at the sight of a forest. –Sgt. Johnson He looked around the hut and then opened the door. Cold air, frigid came right through the door. He quickly shut the door as a reflex of his. His eyes were filled with shock. What is going on? Why did they drop me off in this frigid place? He took the note and read it again, more carefully. A Tundra, he thought. They drop me off in a tundra, he thought with a disappointing look. He turned around to look at his small hut. The same things he saw just a minute ago were right there, no difference. He looked down to see that he was wearing different clothes than he was when they were back in Beachwood. Instead of shorts and a tee shirt, he was wearing a warm jacket with boots and thick pants with pockets. He looked in his pocket, hoping for another note that can give him more clues, but instead he found a hat and gloves. He looked in the other pocket and found a gun. A 32. Caliber, Semi- Automatic Pistol. He put that on the bed with the lamp. He was desperate for some clue of what to do. He looked under the bed, and then found a compass. He paced and paced for a long time. Then, out of the blue, he heard a rumble. A low rumble sounding clear as it came closer. He opened the door, this time prepared for the frigid air. It was snowing, but Colin could tell what the object was. It was a plane. He waved his hand and yelled messages to the flying device. It came closer and closer to the hut. He stopped waving his hand. The plane was too close to land. It was coming in fast. The plane let out a rumble, and a missile let out below the left propeller. It went in fast. It took Colin a few seconds to realize what was going on. He somersaulted down the hill where the hut was. The missile hit the hut with a bang. Wood chunks flew everywhere, flaming or not. The plane flew up and out of site. Colin, on the side of the hill, half startled, half exhausted, sat there for a minute or two. Then he got up and looked at the damage that the bomb had done. The snow on the ground was black with ash, and few smoldering pieces sat on the ground spread out from each other. The bed had blown to pieces, along with the lamp. Then, Colin looked out in the distance. He didn't have a choice. Either complete the challenge, or die a cold, freezing death.[Chapter 6] Deep down in the northern Canadian tundra, the cold air rushed to and fro. Colin trudged his boots up and down through the snow. His fingers were as cold as ice. He had walked for about ten miles from the hut, or now, a pile of ash. No sign of any forest. Young Colin wondered if he would die out here. The low sounding walk of his boots fit in with the sound of cold, frigid air. Snow was twirling all around. No sight of any trees. He slowly walked, and then he tripped. His face fell flat on the freezing snow. The pain of the snow gave him the instinct to get up. Within seconds, Colin was at his feet. He looked at the object he tripped on. It was a beaker. Small and yellow with a flashing red light, and a small box on the left side. He quickly opened the box, and found some matches and wood, with tinder. Colin quickly made a fire, for which he learned in the fourth grade \"survival day\". The fire, blazing with flame, grew larger at every wind stroke. Colin was soothed with the heat from the flame. Nightfall came fast, and Colin fell into a deep sleep. A large howl woke him in the middle of the night. His eyes flashed open, and then got up. It was still snowing, and his fire was still hot coals. He looked around to the left, and then the right. The howl came again, this time chorused with other howls. There was a wolf pack. Colin grabbed the pistol in his pocket. The wolf pack was getting closer. All out of the blue, a four foot wolf pounced out of darkness. Colin fired the gun, aiming it at the dog. The bullet hit right in the forehead. The dog fell to the ground, and let out a whimper. The whimper seemed to travel forever. All of the pack heard the call. Then, several barks came from the distance. They were all coming very fast. He didn't have enough ammunition to carry them all. He looked around quickly, trying to find a weapon of some sort. The fire, he thought. He took a flaming piece of wood from the fire. The dogs came like a hurricane. Seven of them came all at one time. Colin swung the flaming piece. The heat of the flame caught their attention, and they backed up. He swung again, and carefully aimed for one of the wolf's coats. The fur ignited almost immetitly. The flaming dog screamed a cry of terror. The others followed the horrible sound. They ran quickly out of sight. Colin, exhausted, threw the piece into the fire, causing sparks to fly up. He got into his small clearing of snow, and within minutes, he was fast asleep.[Chapter 7] Chapter 6 The snow drifted over his face by the howling cold air. It seemed to crawl up his face, and then onto his forehead. The heat of his body hit the snowflake, and it melted into a small raindrop. Colin's eyes flashed open almost immediately. He slowly got up, and then scraped the snow off his jacket. He stood up and stretched a little. Two minutes later, he was on the move. After the incident last night, he decided the best thing to do is to keep moving. He walked for hour, after hour, after hour. He was hungry, and tired, but he kept moving. Late afternoon, he arrived at his destination. The forest. It was a large, pine forest. Seemed so new with the tundra he had been in for the past fourty-eight hours. He sat there for quite a long time. Minutes later, he kept walking. They were waiting there. Fourteen men, looking simulur to the men that walked him home. The long walk to the forest base was just like the usual. exept with fourteen men instead of two. When he reached his destination, they fed him, gave him rest, and then sent him off. Colin traveled to places he had never heard of, completing challenges, doing tasks. It was just like those seven years. Nothing ever happened. He trained, and trained and trained. But after four years of training, all of it was just a big waste. He completed it. Wherever he was. And then he got a job. And then lived a normal life. But if you thought I would end the story right here, you are wrong. It had just started. The events. The story. All of it.[Chapter 8] I decided to continue on this book, because it gets soooooooo much better. -IamHay Chapter 7 It was a chill October evening, with long cast shadows spread across the city line like blankets to warm the frosted streets of Cleveland. Taxicabs and various cars zoomed past like blurs around a old concrete building towering over the city so high it can almost touch the clouds. As the blazing sun fall in the east, rays of sunshine cast upon the shore of Lake Erie. The Terminal Tower was open all night, in fact. Up above the city, high overlook, stood a lightly lit room, containing fourteen lockers, seventeen chairs, and one man with a unwillingly nightly shift. This man's name was Colin Haze. He had brown eyes, black hair, and a blue uniform with patchwork stating that he is a Terminal Tower Security. He was hired three years earlier, they barely even looked at his job application. He was a young man, only twenty-three years old, the time only 7:10 pm. He sat upright in his chair. Silence fell over the room. Colin looked at the time, waiting for his shift to start. Get there early, the last thing his commander ever said to him after he left for the job. Colin had not seen him in three years, but the words stuck in his mind. Colin's radio mike made a clicking noise, a familiar sound. He picked it up. \"We have a report of a incident on floor six, please report. Over\" said the man in the mike. \"Coming. Over\" Colin said. His feet jumped up off the seat to the incident. He sped through the hallways, familiar sights. He knew what to do, but he didn't know what was coming.[Chapter 9] Chapter 8 His legs moved swiftly step by step across the long hallways of the Terminal Tower. Colin Haze's black shoes skid to a stop. On the right side of the hallway, large windows overlooked Cleveland with weak light shining through. A white wall lined the left. Colin stepped carefully and silent, grazing the wall with the touch of his fingers with one hand, and another on his belt. A large plastic sign marked the direction of the movie theater. Colin Haze directed the corner at a angle. A steel knife blade flew out of a large mans hands, towering at six and a half feet, wearing a white shirt and black suit and tie. Colin, as instict, ducked and avoided the knife. The alarms blared as the knife hit the window, shattering it. The man then grabbed Colin's neck collar and dragged him down the hallway towards the food court. Abanded drinks and food spread across all the tables. The man then took Colin and flung him across the floor, causing several tables and drinks to flip over. As Colin got to his feet, the man pulled out a black grenade and threw it into the pizza shop. Flames curled all around the neon sign as whatnot flew out of the explosion. Colin tackled the man, who then went for a punch. His reflexes were not as fast as Colin's though. A pistol flew out of it's holder and shot the other man. You can guess who. Colin grabbed the grenade, luckilly not lit. He then ran down the the bottom level, and ran out the door. News Reporters lined the streets, and helicopters sprayed water on the flames licking the old skyscraper. Colin however, ran through the crowd of civilians to the parking garage across the street.

It was generally known in San Francisco at the time that Mr. Carson had acquired his fortune through questionable means. That was all that was generally known about Mr. Carson. He rarely spoke about his past, and when he did he offered vague and contradictory accounts. He had been on the losing side of the War Between the States, that much I knew. Although he didn't seem particularly devoted to the confederacy. It was not my job to pry into his personal affairs. Rather, my job concerned itself with his public affairs. I was to be his assistant and apprentice, to aid him in the managing of his investments. In this fashion I hoped to gain enough financial acumen to find employment at a bank or accounting house or some other such respectable business. Working for Mr. Carson paid well, but it was by no means a respectable occupation. I had inherited no money from my father, but I had inherited his peculiar hair color. At the age of 21, I had the white hair of a much older man, nearly a match for the nonagenarian Mr. Carson. This hair coloring was a singular trait of the Alabaster family and, I am told, the reason why the man at Ellis Island chose that particular surname for us. From a young age, my friends and schoolmates had called me Whitey. I have been called Whitey for so long that, if pressed, I'm not sure if I could remember my proper Christian name. Mr. Carson, however, was the one person I knew who did not call me Whitey. He called me 'Blondie.' He said I reminded him of a man he once knew. I was wise enough not to pursue the matter any further. No doubt Mr. Carson had his reasons for being shy about his past, and as his employee, I was obligated to respect them. For a man of such advanced age, William Carson was remarkably healthy. He could walk under his own power when the mood took him. More often then not, though, I found myself pushing him in his wheelchair. He owned, in whole or in part, a good many businesses around San Francisco, and he liked to check up on them periodically. He paid particular interest to the bars and taverns that he had purchased, often sampling their product to be sure that everything was 'up-to-snuff.' His favorite, by far, was one on the corner of Laguna and Walnut that he had renamed The Mission St. Antoine. \"There are two kinds of people in this world.\" He often told me as he sipped expensive whiskey out of a cheap glass. \"Those who got money, like me; and those who want money, like you.\" The last half of that little saying was always different, but often it was vaguely insulting. Usually I'd just sit next to him and watch as he relieved the establishment of two or three of their finest bottles. Since I was \"on the clock\" I did not, myself, partake. I would watch as Mr. Carson sunk lower and lower into another fit of drunken revelry. These fits were the only times Mr. Carson spoke candidly to me, and it is only through piecing them together that I am able to form some coherent vision of his history. On this particular night, February the 18th, he spoke of a place called Sad Hill. It was a cemetery, from what I could gather, where they used to bury soldiers during the war. No wonder the subject seemed to drum up such emotion within him. No doubt some of his closest friends had been buried on that hill. He had spoken of this cemetery before, bit tonight he made mention of something new. He spoke of a headstone that only read 'unknown,' a grave for a man with no name. I was not aware, at the time, of the significance of this grave. I was chiefly concerned with getting Mr. Carson back to his place of residence before he succumbed to alcohol poisoning. Still, in the furthest recesses of my mind I filed away these new details about my employers past: the grave of an unknown soldier, and a man who had no name. In my imagination, these two distinct concepts existed as one for a time. It would be roughly two months before the great quake hit San Francisco. During that time I was to become much better acquainted with Mr. Carson, as well as his friend with no name.[Chapter 2] Chapter 2: There was a Certain Grave There was a certain grave, not far from the city limits, that Mr. Carson liked to visit on Sundays. Since the graveyard was on a hill, and I was Mr. Carson's primary means of locomotion, I usually accompanied him. Of the deceased, I knew only what I read off of the gravestone. He was a priest, Father Pablo Ramirez, 1810-1874. If the caretaker of the old cemetery was to be believed, Mr. Carson had made the arrangements, and paid for Father Ramirez's burial himself. Though the headstone was worn through years of exposure to the open-air, it was still clearly a very intricate work of very fine craftsmanship. Prostrate angels rested atop it, and there was gold trim along one side. Assuming the unseen coffin was of a similar quality, the father's burial had been quite an expensive preposition. This was one great mystery about my employer. He didn't seem to have any great respect for the Catholic Church, or any religion. Why would he spend all that money to bury some priest? It seemed odd that he would hold a man of the cloth in such high regard. Were he alive to see it, Father Remirez might not approve of such an ostentatious memorial. Perhaps that was Mr. Carson's private revenge, giving a king's burial to a willfully humble man. That was the only explanation I could think of that made sense. \"You know Blondie,\" Mr. Carson said after twenty odd minutes of silently staring at the grave. \"When I was young, not quite as young as you are now, but young, I had a wife, and a couple of children.\" I wasn't expecting to hear that. I'd always assumed Mr. Carson to be a lifelong bachelor. I spent a great deal of time in Mr. Carson's estate, and had seen no evidence of a family. No portraits, no photographs, not even any letters. If Mr. Carson had had a wife and children at some point, they must be long since dead. With this in mind, I consciously changed my expression to one of mourning and regret. It's good for business to have the same mood as your employer. \"But who knows where they are now?\" Mr. Carson continued. I hadn't expected that either. If he wasn't sure where his children were, it was safe to assume they weren't dead. In my experience, the dead remain relatively stationary. \"Pablito, he did the ceremony,\" Mr. Carson gestured toward the gravestone. \"Every time I saw him after that, he asked about her.\" He was silent a few moments before finally adding \"I didn't tell him about the others.\" I wasn't sure what to say, so I said nothing. If I offended Mr. Carson, I might lose my livelihood. Better to play it safe. \"There are two kinds of people in this world, my friend: those who got families, and those who got nothing like poor Tuco…\" I wasn't sure exactly who 'poor Tuco' was, but I nodded in agreement. \"I'd like to find them, Blondie.\" He said softly, the dull rasping of his voice nearly drowned out by the wind. He scowled, \"I knew a man once who could find anybody. Whenever he set out to find somebody, he found him. That's why they paid him.\" Mr. Carson turned to me. \"What the hell do I pay you for?\" \"I push the wheelchair, manage the accounts, drive the car…\" I rattled off mechanically. Mr. Carson often spoke to me. I rarely spoke to him. When I did, I limited myself to answering specific questions. \"Now I pay you for finding my family.\" Mr. Carson said matter-of-factly. \"You think you can do that, Blondie?\" I was not at all qualified for that sort of work, but I wasn't going to refuse a request from the richest man in San Francisco. \"Whatever you say Mr. Carson.\" Mr. Carson smiled. \"Good Blondie, very good. Let's drink to it, huh? I buy all those bars, I should have a drink whenever I want!\" I wheeled Mr. Carson back down the hill and helped him into the Silver Ghost. Mr. Carson was one of the very few people to own an automobile, and I was one of the very few people who knew how to drive one. My expertise in this field almost made up for my embarrassing ineptitude as a rider. Mr. Carson would have used any occasion as an excuse to go drinking, but that night actually seemed special. It marked the transition to the next stage of my career. He drew up a contract for me the next day, or rather he had someone else draw it up. Mr. Carson was not unintelligent, but I suspect he was not literate. I was to receive $100 dollars for each erstwhile relative I was able to find. I had all of Mr. Carson's resources behind me, including the Silver Ghost and a considerable expense account. Why he trusted me, a mere lad of 21, with so great an undertaking I could not say. Perhaps it was because I reminded him of his old friend. Perhaps he was just going senile. The next morning was to be the start of a grand adventure. I would gather what information I could from Mr. Carson, then travel to New Mexico, the last place he had seen his wife and children. If I had not found the object of my search so quickly, I might have been spared the ravages of the quake that spring. Sometimes when God visits us with a curse, we mistake it for a blessing.[Chapter 3] Chapter 3: The Girl with Angel Eyes. Even in the heady days of the Wild West, marriages had been matters of public record. My employer, Mr. Carson, made in known to me that he had not used his real name for any of his marriages. Certainly there was much to say on the ethics of marrying woman under false pretenses, to say nothing of marrying four women and abandoning them in quick succession, but since I was fond of employment, I held my tongue. It was generally known in San Francisco that Mr. Carson was not an honorable man, but I had never imagined him to be the type to abandon his children. He remembered only one name, even that was surprising considering he was long past the age of senility. Taking an automobile through the desert was a dangerous and stupid proposition, although it was tempting to make use of the expensive machinery Mr. Carson had put at my disposal. Nevertheless, my own good judgment prevailed, and I took the train to New Mexico. Those train tracks had been like the fingers of civilization, grasping on to the American west and holding it firmly in its clutches. As recently as my own childhood, the world had been a very different place. At the age of six, while traveling with my late father, I had had the bad fortune to witness an actual gunfight. In those days, men shooting each other in the street, in full view of God, the law, and anyone else who cared to interfere, was not nearly so uncommon as it has now become. I can still vividly recall the two men who had been fighting. One was short, with black hair and a trim mustache, and he wore chaps with gold embroidery along one side. The other was tall, with blonde hair, and he wore a poncho. Evidently, one man had offended the other in some way. I was too young to understand and my father did not wish to explain it to me. The 'rules' of the battle, however, were simple enough for a child of six to understand. The men stood back to back, each held a gun in their hand. They took ten paces forward, turned, and each fired a shot. Oftentimes, a third party counted off the ten paces. In this case, the black haired man had conscripted a local preacher. \"Count us off padre,\" he'd shouted at the passing minister. From the way he angled his gun, you could tell it was not a suggestion. My father kept hold of me to make sure I staid inside, but he had no problem with me watching through the general store window. I counted along with that unfortunate preacher, not knowing quite what to expect when they finally got to ten. I was not disappointed. Before I could blind the blonde man had turned around and fired a clean shot into the other man's chest. The duel was over almost before it began, and yet the blonde man kept standing there. He stared as his vanquished opponent with his piercing blue eyes. \"Why's he still standing there?\" I demanded of my father. \"He won, it's over.\" My father simple shook his head. \"It ain't over.\" He said solemnly. \"Not till the other man takes his shot.\" It was a pathetic display, almost cruel in its supposed mercy. The blonde man just stood there, presenting himself as a target. The other man could barely stand, but he made a token effort. He managed to raise his gun, and fired one shot wildly into the air before collapsing. That memory has stayed with me all the days of my life. After seeing that remarkable display, I became obsessed with the frontier. For a time, my sole ambition in lie was to become a gunfighter. This ambition so worried my father, and he decided not to take me on his next trip out West. I never travelled with father again. He died in a train crash during that next trip. In a strange, roundabout way, that blonde man in a poncho had saved my life, and I didn't even know his name. These thoughts and more ran through my mind as I sailed past the western landscape at nearly 40 miles per hour. Out of the windows of the train I could see new towns, new train stations, signs that we had put those wild western days behind us. There was no place for bad men in the 20th century. Albuquerque had barely been a watering hole at the time of Mr. Carson's first marriage. Now it was a genuine city. The records I had to search for in the town hall were older than the town hall building itself. The name Mr. Carson had given me was Ana Ramirez. And sure enough, after a solid week of searching through the antiquated record room, I managed to find a certificate for Ana and Tuco Ramirez, married in April of 1840. I surmised that the late Father Ramirez had been Mr. Carson's inspiration for this particular alias. From the information present on the marriage license, it wasn't hard to find Mrs. Ramirez's current location. There was an address on the marriage license, an address Mr. Carson had been unable to remember. Once obtained, it was simply a matter of searching the yellowing town hall records again to see who had purchased the homestead at which the young couple had resided, and from then on it was a matter of detective work. I'll spare you all of the insipid details, but suffice to say that, by day's end, the majority of the petty cash Mr. Carson had provided me with had been spent as bribe money. It's amazing what information a town hall or an old farmer will give up when faced with a sudden financial windfall. The Ramirez had had two children at the time of Mr. Ramirez's departure. Apparently Ana had explained her single motherhood by claiming her husband had died. I gave an involuntary shudder, thinking just what kind of man William Carson was, to leave a woman to raise two children on her own. One of the children, a boy name Juan, had been lost to sickness at a young age. The other, a girl named Maria, had died just last year, and was survived by a husband and daughter who both resided in Albuquerque. After a lifetime of evil, Mr. Carson had begun to regret one year too late. It would have been heartbreaking, except Maria Ramirez was undoubtedly better off believing her father had died. Knowing the truth, that he had up and left her due to a restless spirit, might have been too much for her to bear. Still, I had been paid to render a service. When I set out to find somebody I find them, that's why they pay me. A little cash spread around at the Newspaper offices got me last years funerary notices, and the location of Maria's grave. It was strange, after seeing Pablo's grave a dozen times, to see the resting place of another Ramirez. Of course, the girl had not been buried under her maiden name, and the tombstone read Gomez. I resolved to send Mr. Carson a telegram telling him both his son and daughter had died, and then never speak of the matter again. I probably would never have given a second thought to the Gomez family if fate had not intervened at that very moment. A beautiful girl of about my age also approached Maria Gomez's grave. She stood next to me in silence for a moment before finally asking: \"Did you know my mother?\" I could have lied. I could have said I was the son of some old acquaintance come to pay my respects. In fact, I planned to do just that until I turned to see the young Miss Eliza Gomez. She had the most brilliant blue eyes, like an angel's eyes. Of course, my gaze did not linger on her eyes for very long, and the rest of her was up to the same exacting standard. It suddenly occurred to me that telling this girl that I worked for her grandfather would be a way of surreptitiously insinuating myself into her life. It was a foolish thing to tell her, but even now I don't regret it. It wasn't long after that I found myself at Mr. Gomez's house, explaining to him that Maria's father, long thought dead, was living comfortably in San Francisco. Eliza's father was no interested in the least until the subject of an inheritance came up. Mr. Gomez was under the impression that Maria's father, in addition to being dead, had been dirt poor. No doubt he had been poor when Maria had last seen him. No one knew exactly where Mr. Carson got his money, but like so many other who stood to benefit from the Carson fortune, myself included, Mr. Gomez did not particularly care. After a quick exchange of telegrams, the matter was settled. I was to escort Miss Eliza Gomez back to San Francisco to meet her grandfather. Once there, we would discuss the matter of her expectations, and possibly a family share in some of his businesses. Mr. Gomez was, at first, reticent about entrusting his young daughter to a man of twenty-one. He himself had once been a man of twenty-one, and knew exactly what they might do if left alone with a beautiful woman. I explained to him that my livelihood depended on maintaining my good standing with Mr. Carson, and any dalliances with his granddaughter would undoubtedly put that standing in jeopardy. When it was put into that kind of language, Mr. Gomez immediately understood. He and I both shared that noblest of vices, greed, which can often be counted upon to make a man remain virtuous. It wasn't long after that I was sitting next to Miss Eliza on a train bound for San Francisco. My mission had been, in some sense of the word, a success. Still, one thing bothered me. The false name Mr. Carson had used when he was married, Tuco Ramirez, sounded oddly familiar to me. The name kept swimming through my mind. Tuco Ramirez, where had I heard it before? I couldn't be sure, and I paid it no mind. Perhaps if my memory had been a bit sharper, I would have been able to save myself a great deal of trouble in the long run.[Chapter 4] Chapter 4: The Bunkhouse Boys Upon our return, we found Mr. Carson in high spirits. His sorrow for the loss of his son and daughter was curtailed by his joy at discovering Eliza. He insisted we spend our first night in celebration. Like every celebration Mr. Carson initiated, this one was held at his tavern, the Mission St. Antoine . I tried to explain to him why such an establishment was not a proper place for a young lady, but he either didn't understand or didn't care. Eliza, for her part, was delighted to see a hide of the world her father had tried desperately to hide from her. I wanted Eliza to think her grandfather was a respectable man, so I fished my old valet's uniform out of mothballs and drove her and her grandfather in the Silver Ghost. She'd never been inside an automobile before, and she was suitably impressed. Before arriving at the mission, we made a stop at a tailor on the more fashionable side of town. There wasn't time to have a dress made for young Eliza, so Mr. Carson instructed me to buy the most expensive one 'off the rack' and have it hastily altered. It was evident just by looking that the dress had been made for a much larger woman. The cut of the bodice was all wrong; it jutted out in places where Eliza didn't. Still, there was no denying that she looked absolutely radiant. \"Lou, hand me down a whiskey!\" Mr. Carson called out as I wheeled him up to the bar. From his sitting position, he couldn't quite reach the bottles up on the shelf. I would never grow tired of looking at that endless row of blown glass bottles behind the bar. Tonight, perhaps, I would indulge myself, despite being in the company of my employer. Eliza was a popular with the regulars, but not too popular. They were all wary of Mr. Carson. This fear did more to protect Miss Eliza's virtue than any action on her grandfather's part. He spent the better part of the night in a drunken daze. One thing I can say about Mr. Carson is that he was always consistent. When he was depressed, he drank to excess, and when he was happy he did the same. I had never seen him in quite so good a mood. Perhaps to him, young Miss Eliza represented a chance at redemption, a way to atone for past mistakes. Of course, deep down he knew as I did that men like him could never attain redemption. While nearly everyone in the was in high spirits, there was one gloomy face. The man behind the bar, old Lou Basset, looked as if he'd seen a ghost. I asked him if anything was wrong, more out of politeness than concern. \"Couple of fellas came in here today, said we had to give them half our money every week from now on.\" Lou explained, with a worried look on his face. \"Why, whatever for?\" I asked, genuinely puzzled. \"Were they Internal Revenue men?\" Lou shook his head. \"They didn't look it. They said the money was for protection.\" \"Protection from what?\" I asked. If that seems naïve of me, remember that this sort of racketeering was a fairly new concept at the time. Lou shrugged. \"From them, I s'pose. I tol' em we wouldn't pay, and they got awful mad. Said we'd be sorry.\" \"You did the right thing, Lou.\" I said. He had done the right thing. No competent employee would hand over half the week's earning to a gang of mystery men who offered only vague threats in return. My gaze turned to Mr. Carson. In an unprecedented feat of strength, he'd taken Miss Eliza upon his shoulders and was carrying her about the room. Sometimes I wondered if he really needed that wheelchair. If he was at all concerned by these demands for protection money, he gave no outward sign. Suddenly it dawned on me: he didn't know yet. How could he? It had only happened today, and he'd barely spoken to Lou the entire evening. My eyes moved from his face to Eliza's. Both of them were beaming, he due to liquor and she due to joy. \"Pray do not speak of this matter to Mr. Carson.\" I said. \"It would be a sin to give him bad news tonight.\" Lou moved to protest, but I cut him off. \"I am the manager of Mr. Carson's affairs, if there's a problem I'll deal with it. Now tell me, what did these men look like?\" Lou's vague description of the three enforcers was less than helpful. However, I was soon to receive vital information on these men from another source. Mr. Carson wished to devote as much time to his newfound relative as possible. Is it true, I wonder, that men grow soft in their old age? Or is it just the fear of death and hellfire that compels them to act the way they do, as if a few weeks of good could make up for a career of evil? Either way, it didn't matter to me. By the third day, he even had Eliza pushing his wheelchair, which made our trips to Father Ramirez's grave considerably less strenuous for me. His desire to spend more time with Miss Eliza meant that he gave me a far greater degree of autonomy. It was I, and I alone who went to check in on all of his businesses that week. I was deeply concerned to find that nearly every manager of every business had a story like Lou's to relate to me. Three men had come, and they had demanded half of the prophets every week in exchange for 'protection.' Each manager had his own vague, not altogether useful description of these three enforcers, but by piecing them altogether I was able to sketch an accurate portrait of them in my mind. Once you know what a person looks like, finding him becomes that much easier. I wasn't sure if this ring of extortion went beyond Mr. Carson's property, but if every single business Mr. Carson owned was a target, it couldn't have been a coincidence. No, someone was specifically targeting Mr. Carson. Truthfully, there couldn't be a better target for extortion. As I said, it was well known in San Francisco at the time that Mr. Carson had come into his fortune by questionable means. He didn't seem like the sort of person who would welcome any sort of police involvement in his affairs, which left him open to exactly the kind of scam our mystery men were enacting. Visits to local taverns and inquiries about men fitting the descriptions eventually bore fruit. They were a trio of thugs whose individual names were not known, but who were collectively called the bunkhouse boys. Evidently they had been cattlemen at one point, and had lived together in a bunkhouse on the ranch. Those were the only details about their past that the bunkhouse boys had ever volunteered, and even that was just to explain their name. No longer cattlemen, the bunkhouse boys were now hired guns. But the market for hired guns was running dry in 1906, so they'd taken up a new form of business, and become a new kind of gangster. It's amazing how much one can learn in a local tavern when one has a generous expense account. So the bunkhouse boys had taken up a new trade, and they had decided that Mr. Carson was easy money. Involving the police seemed out of the question, and telling Mr. Carson would only have upset him and ruined his reunion with Eliza. I told every manager, clerk, and headperson at every one of Mr. Carson's businesses to refuse the bunkhouse boy's request, and to hold firm like a stonewall. My orders were not questioned. As far as the employees were concerned, I spoke for Mr. Carson directly. I would have to force their hand into some more obvious crime, one they could be arrested for without anyone looking into Mr. Carson's accounts or business affairs. At least, that was the initial plan. At long last the appointed day came. The day the bunkhouse boys had promised to return to collect their payment. If one of them threw a punch or smashed a window, I could have them jailed for disorderly conduct and leave the whole extortion business out of it. I felt quite proud of myself that day as I strolled down to the Mission St. Antoine ,secretly hoping for it to be a scene of devastation. If mother were alive, she would no doubt scold me for forgetting my bible verses, specifically what they have to say on the subject of pride. When I got to the Mission however, I was surprised to find both the bar and bartender intact. Lou handed me a letter the so-called bunkhouse boys had given him. It was addressed to William Carson, but as his manager I had no qualms about reading it myself. What I read put ice water in my veins. One word, written in surprising formal penmanship: Eliza. The message was clear. Mr. Carson had not kept his granddaughter a secret, and her presence in San Francisco had given him something he had never had before: a clear vulnerability. She was to become the first strike in a violent war. I knew that I couldn't allow this to happen, but at the same time I wasn't sure exactly what to do. A million possible plans of action raced through my head, and each of them seemed equally doomed to failure. I thought for a moment: When would they come for Eliza? The answer seemed obvious: during the night when there would be witnesses. So it was my mission, therefore, to become a witness, and possibly even a protector. I asked to stay at Mr. Carson's house that night. I forget what reason I gave, probably something ridiculous. Mr. Carson was in too good a mood to say no, I could have given him any reason that popped into m mind. My plan was a simple one. I would set up a chair in front of the front entrance and stand guard all night long. That would take care of one night. I'd have to come up with a more long-term plan of action in the morning. One of the more menial tasks Mr. Carson delegated to me was to replace his clothing in its proper drawers after it had been laundered. In so doing I had become aware of something that was essential to my plan. At the bottom of the chest of drawers in Mr. Carson's room, below his woolen socks, was a gun. It was an old gun, perhaps dating from Mr. Carson's service in the Civil War. It looked as if several pieces had fallen off and been replaced with bits from other guns. I wasn't even certain if it still worked, but I was certain of one thing: it was still loaded. I waited until fairly late to try and sneak the gun out of Mr. Carson's chamber. Most elderly men tend to be heavy sleepers. I thought I had gotten away scot free, and had already taken my position in front of the doorway when I heard the telltale squeak of Mr. Carson's chair come from behind me. \"What the hell are you doing with my gun, Blondie?\" Mr. Carson asked. From his tone of voice I could tell that he was not at all pleased. I was completely at a loss for words. I had hoped to deal with the whole matter discretely. I was saved from answering by a sudden banging at the door. Far from being relieved, I was terrified. The bunkhouse boys had made their presence known. \"Oh Jesus!\" I exclaimed, though I was not usually one to curse. \"They're going to break down the door!\" I held the gun at the ready, but my hands were shaken too much for it to be more than an empty gesture. \"What the hell is going on?\" Mr. Carson demanded. The door gave another shake as the bunkhouse boys pounded on it again. I could stand it no longer, I could feel hot tears falling down my face as I tried to explain the situation to my employer. \"They wanted your money, I said no, now they say they're going to kill Eliza.\" I hung my head in shame. \"I didn't want to trouble you. I thought I could handle it on my own. Forgive me, Mr. Carson!\" There was another loud bang at the door. The wood was beginning to splinter. It wouldn't be long. Mr. Carson looked right at me, his face to perfect image of serenity. \"Give me the gun, Blondie.\" He said coolly. \"Mr. Carson, you might hurt yourself.\" I protested. \"Give me the gun, Blondie.\" Mr. Carson repeated more forcefully. I conceded and gave him the gun. In what was possibly the last few seconds of my life, I might as well act as a loyal employee. Finally the door gave way, the bunkhouse boys poured into the antechamber, guns already drawn and a mean look in their eyes. In one fluid motion, Mr. Carson raised the gun in his right hand and fired off three shots. Half a second later, all three of the so-called bunkhouse boys were lying on the ground, stone dead.[Chapter 5] Chapter 5: The Man with Many Names For a moment I just stood there in stunned silence. I had never expected to see another shooting, and I certainly hadn't expected to see one in San Francisco. Mr. Carson lowered the gun to his side, and suddenly he looked his age. Every wrinkle, every white hair, every discoloration stood out like a star against the night sky. For the first time since I'd known him, Mr. Carson looked truly old. \"They still do things the old way.\" Mr. Carson said, glancing at the three fresh corpses on the ground. \"That's no good. We can't do things the old way anymore.\" Suddenly, as if he remembered where he was, Mr. Carson sat bolt upright and trained the gun on me. \"And you!\" he shouted, his tone accusatory. \"Why din't you tell me about this thing from the beginning?\" I tried to defend myself, but Mr. Carson wouldn't let me get a word in edgewise. It was probably for the best. I've found that in most conversations, it's best to yield to the party with the loaded gun. \"I know you're young, you make mistakes, but there's two kinds of people in this world! The kind who make mistakes and the kind who work for me! I ought to shoot you myself!\" I winced in anticipation of the bullet entering my temple. Bu the bullet never came. \"Of course, if I was going to shoot you, I'd have done it already.\" with a worn-out smile, he lowered the gun back to his side. \"When you gotta shoot, shoot, don't talk. That's what I always say.\" He paused for a moment. \"Well…I said it once.\" A soft feminine voice came from upstairs \"Grandpa, are you alright? What happened?\" Evidently, the gunshots had woken young Miss Eliza, hardly surprising. \"You're lucky she's here.\" Mr. Carson said, hiding the gun under his dressing gun. \"You're lucky you found her, or else maybe you wouldn't be so lucky, eh?\" I had to concede the point. Eliza would never know it, but her presence had probably saved my life that night. No man, no matter how bad he may be, wants his children to regard him as a killer. Perhaps that was why Mr. Carson had run away from so many families, why he had never used his real name. Who could say? No need to worry about a police investigation now, it was a fairly open and shut case. Three men burst into a house in the middle of the night with pistols drawn, and a man rightly defends himself. In fact, the whole incident brought Mr. Carson a new level of fame in the community. Strange that he was once reviled merely for being mysterious, but now that he had openly killed three people, he was celebrated as a hero. I continued to work for Mr. Carson, but I was never again granted the same degree of autonomy I had had during the first few week's of Miss Eliza's visit. Mr. Carson's house had always been a solitary place, even after Eliza had come to stay. It was an old man's house, and Eliza seemed distinctly out of place there. After news of Mr. Carson slaying three criminals started to spread, something happened that had never happened before: he began to receive visitors. The first one was a man from the newspaper. Despite this being the first visitor during the term of my employment, it was somehow agreed that it was my job to answer the door. If pressed, I don't think I could tell you what my job under Mr. Carson actually was. After the fiasco with the bunkhouse boys, I certainly didn't manage anything, and Eliza had taken on my former duties as a personal assistant. It seemed my only remaining tasks were to answer the door and to drive the Silver Ghost. After the man from the newspaper, more came. A little old lady baked him a cake. I dare say the little old lady was younger than he was. That was no great shakes, since by my reckoning Mr. Carson had to be at least ninety. From the way he'd looked after shooting the bunkhouse boys, I would have believed he was a hundred. In any case, he was too old to properly digest so rich a cake, and Eliza and I profited by that. Eliza and I spent a great deal of time together. He grandfather needed his rest, and so more often than not the task of keeping her entertained fell to me. My first take was to have a proper dress made for her. Mr. Carson insisted that all of her clothing be bespoke, just as his was. That first dress was one of dozens he had made for her. Each was a different color and a wildly different pattern. Evidently, now that he had found a living relative, he was determined to show her off. He also sent me to buy parasols, hats, formal gloves and whatever other bric-a-brac a girl her age could ask for. I began to wonder if Eliza's presence had affected Mr. Carson's accounting practices, with a special concern towards my own personal expense account. If Eliza had been at all disturbed to see three corpses lying at her grandfather's feet, slain by her grandfather's hand, she kept it quiet. Perhaps the endless flood of gifts was Mr. Carson's way of ensuring this silence. Often I would take Miss Eliza out in the Silver Ghost. To the opera, to the theater, wherever she wanted to go. It had been a mistake to wear my valet's uniform that first night, since she know expected me to wear it at all times, and made the most upsetting face when she saw me in my normal clothes. It was on one such night, when Eliza was out at the opera, that we received a most peculiar visitor. I had returned to the Carson house to wait out Miss Eliza's show. If I timed it right, I would arrive just at the final curtain call. I was going over Mr. Carson's books with an eye towards my own personal wellbeing when the doorbell rang. I answered the door, as was my duty, and asked whom I could say was calling. \"Archibald Stanton.\" The man in the doorway replied. He was a tall thin man, with white and wispy hair. In a way he resembled my father, except for his face, which looked like it had been hewn from sunburned leather. He wore a well-maintained suit that was several years out of date and a cape rather than an overcoat. I say a cape, but in the state it was in it more resembled a ratty old poncho. \"There's a Mr. Archibald Stanton here to see you.\" I announced from the door of Mr. Carson's office. Mr. Carson pricked at the name. Evidently Mr. Stanton was some old acquaintance of his. \"Arch Stanton!\" he exclaimed, \"You sure?\" \"I have no cause to doubt the man, Mr. Carson.\" I said with a shrug. \"Shall I show him in now, sir?\" Mr. Carson nodded silently. He had the most terrible pallor about him, as if he'd seen some supernatural creature out of the corner of his eye, some dark specter that now haunted his every waking moment. I thought nothing of it at the time. Mr. Stanton entered the room as if it belonged to him. Mr. Carson seemed to recognize him right away, and he didn't seem happy to see him. \"So now you're Arch Stanton?\" Mr. Carson asked flatly. Stanton smiled. \"My little joke Tuco. One I knew only you'd get. I had to be sure.\" Stanton shot a sideways glance at me. \"I'd hoped we could talk alone.\" \"I'm Mr. Carson's business manager. Whatever you have to say to him, you can say to me.\" Perhaps I was speaking above my station, but I was dreadfully curious. Evidently this man had known Mr. Carson long ago, at the time of his first marriage. How else would he know the name Tuco? \"Blondie has a point.\" Mr. Carson said, nodding in my direction. \"He can stay.\" \"Blondie?\" Stanton muttered to himself. Evidently Mr. Carson's nickname for me amused him somehow. \"Only one other person besides me knows about Arch Stanton, and I'm pretty sure he's dead.\" \"Did you really think you'd outlive me?\" Stanton asked, smiling. Stanton was definitely old, but he looked a great deal younger than Mr. Carson. \"Why do you come to me now, after forty years?\" Mr. Carson asked, a hint of sadness in his voice. \"Forty years?\" Stanton repeated in disbelief. \"So it's forty years. I didn't come to see you because I didn't know where you were.\" Stanton said with a shrug. \"Then I saw the name Bill Carson in the paper, I figured it couldn't be a coincidence. Imagine my surprise when I found out we lived in the same town. Thought I'd look in on my old friend.\" \"It's good to see old friends.\" Mr. Carson said warmly, his manner then grew cold. \"But you want something. You always do.\" \"Nothing big.\" Stanton said, drawing a small cigar from his pocket and placing it in his mouth. \"You see,\" he explained, \"back when you knew me, I had a lot of money, and no name, but now the whole situation is reversed.\" He lit the cigar, the smoke was noxious enough to make my eyes water. \"You see Tuco, I'm flat broke, but I've got so many names. Joe, Manco, Josey, I've even been a William like you. And what was it you used to call me?\" Stanton gave me a meaningful glance. At least, I assume it was meaningful to him since I wasn't able to glean any meaning from it. \"Ah yes, I remember.\" Stanton said, taking another puff of his cigar. \"When we last met you called me a dirty son of a bitch.\" \"I don't think you are my old friend.\" Mr. Carson said dismissively. \"He never talked this much.\" \"Oh, I'm a changed man, Tuco.\" Stanton replied. \"In the old days I was afraid of what I might say, but a husband has to talk to his wife, and a father has to talk to his children.\" \"Children!\" Mr. Carson exclaimed. His voice held surprise mingled with jealously. \"That's right Tuco, children, one boy and one girl. Their mother died before she could give me any more. It's for their sake that I've come to you.\" \"For their sake?\" Mr. Carson said with a sneer. \"What can I do for your filthy children?\" \"I don't have much to leave them when I'm gone.\" Stanton said, at once losing his former confidence. \"Just my little shop down on Hayes Street, and maybe not even that. Some people came by last week, said they wanted money. I said no and they wrecked my store.\" Mr. Carson laughed. \"I thought you said you read the paper. You don't have to worry about those sons of bitches anymore.\" Stanton just shook his head. \"The bunkhouse boys were the worst of them, but they weren't the only ones. There's a whole organization. There are a lot of old bad men in San Francisco, people who can't go to the law, and they're tracking us down and making us pay.\" \"How many people are in an organization?\" Mr. Carson demanded. \"I killed three, how many left?\" \"Over three score.\" Stanton answered. \"It's more than just a gang Tuco, it's a whole mob of people. They're not all like the bunkhouse boys, some of them are younger, smarter, I can't deal with them on my own.\" \"So that's why you came to Tuco.\" Mr. Carson replied. It was the first time I'd heard him refer to himself by that name. No, upon reflection, it was the second. \"If we get organized like they are, we can fight this.\" Stanton said. \"We could be partners again, Tuco.\" \"And you could leave me to die again, out there in the desert.\" Mr. Carson replied coldly. \"We're too old to fight amongst ourselves, Tuco.\" Stanton said insistently. \"I don't want anything you have, I just want to keep what I have. Just tell me you'll think about.\" There was a long silence. Mr. Carson stared at Stanton. He almost looked frightened of the man. \"I make no promises to pigs like you.\" He said finally. \"Now get out of here. And if you come to my house again, I'll kill you.\" I held my tongue until Stanton had left before I spoke with Mr. Carson. \"Sir, I'm not sure what your dealings with that man were in the past. But it seemed to me that he had a good motive at heart, and that he could have been a help to you.\" \"You don't know him like I do.\" Mr. Carson said dismissively. \"He acts friendly now, but for a fistful of dollars he'd kill you, and for a few dollars more he'd kill your family too.\" \"Perhaps he's changed since the old days.\" I suggested. I was taking a tone of familiarity wit Mr. Carson that I never had before. \"You think a man can change that much?\" Carson asked. \"Haven't you?\" I said. I didn't know the answer, and I don't think he did either. I had to cut our conversation short to go pick up Eliza at the Opera House. It was strange, I suppose, to send a girl out of the house alone, but neither I nor Mr. Carson could have offered much in the way of company, and her association with a known killer afforded her some degree of protection. Still, I was glad to see her safe and sound outside the Opera House. Mr. Stanton's dire concern for his own children had led me to fear the worst. Away from the cramped confines of Mr. Carson's office, Stanton's story seemed more and more ridiculous. A mob of criminals, organized like an army? It simply wasn't possible. Perhaps it had just been the ranting of a demented old man, and yet it still worried me greatly. It was that night that the first early tremors hit, and I mistook the mild shaking of the Earth to be a symptom of my unease.[Chapter 6] Chapter 6: A Ways Down Hayes Street. Those of you who are primarily interested in Mr. Carson may not find this next episode to be particularly interesting. Still, I hope you can recognize why it was particularly interesting to me. I was going over Mr. Carson's ledgers in one of the many dreary little rooms of his house, when who should walk in but young Miss Eliza. Hardly surprising, since she now lived there, but it was still the last thing I had expected. She was wearing one of the new dresses that Mr. Carson had commissioned for her. I would merely embarrass myself if I attempted to describe it in any detail. Suffice to say that, even to a man like myself, no follower of fashion, it appeared supremely fashionable. \"Mr. Alabaster,\" she began tentatively. It's worth noting that to this day, she's the only person who ever called me that. \"I shall be going to the theater tonight.\" \"Ah,\" I replied, trying not to look up from the ledgers, \"and I suppose you want me to take you there.\" Inwardly I shuddered. The prospect of putting on that chauffeur's uniform again alarmed me. \"Actually, I thought you might like to go with me.\" Miss Eliza replied. Now this was something new. \"I've grown bored of going to the theater by myself.\" \"I see.\" I replied, finally closing Mr. Carson's ledger. \"And am I really the best you can do? No society friends, no gentleman callers?\" \"None to speak of.\" She said, blushing a little. I realized that since it was my job to answer the door, I would probably have known about any gentlemen callers. Suddenly, like a brick striking me in the head, I realized why Miss Eliza desired my company. It was simple psychology really. The firs twenty odd years of her life had been a dismal, dull affair. My arrival had signified a great change. I had taken her away from her relative poverty in Albuquerque and into a world of wealth and elegance. Never mind that I had just been an errand boy. I wasn't foolish enough to believe this was anything more than a childish infatuation, and I certainly wasn't foolish enough to not take advantage of it while it lasted. That evening I accompanied Miss Eliza to the theater, and it was perhaps the most magical evening of my young life. Naturally, this new revelation rekindled my interested in Mr. Carson's past. What had once been a mild curiosity was now an urgent need. If I was to pursue a relationship with Miss Eliza, I wanted to know if my life would be in danger. I'd seen him kill three men before my eyes because they posed a threat to Miss Eliza. If he saw me as another threat, it would not bode well for me. I'd often suspected that Mr. Carson had been a bad man in the old West. Recent circumstances had seemed to confirm my suspicion. The real question was: how bad of a bad man had he been? I felt almost foolish for being afraid of such an old man, almost foolish. The tall white-haired man, whose name was evidently not Arch Stanton, had mentioned having a ship down on Hayes Street. This was the only tangible connection I could trace to Mr. Carson's past, so I decided to look into it. The play was some nonsense about an Englishman with an American cousin. I could scarcely concentrate, the twin distractions of Mr. Carson's checkered past and the newly affectionate Miss Eliza both clawing at my mind. I have never been what some might call 'the cultured type.' I was as much a stranger in a playhouse as I would have been in darkest China. I could feel those eyes that weren't focused on the play curiously probing me. My clothes were clearly a servant's uniform, and yet I was sitting next to a very refined looking lady, seemingly unaware of the impropriety. I quietly thanked God that Mr. Carson was a dedicated recluse, else he was likely to hear of Eliza and me indirectly through upper-class gossip. So consumed was I by the thought of violent reprisal by Mr. Carson that I sought out the tall man's little shop directly upon leaving the theater. An astute reader may note the logistical problem here: that Miss Eliza was still with me. I told her I was visiting a friend. She was kind enough not to ask whom I could possibly be visiting so late at night. No doubt her logical faculties were dulled by fatigue. Or perhaps, horror of horrors, she had begun to trust me without question. The shop would be closed at such an hour, but at that time it was customary for shop owners to take up residence above their shops. Even if I had to wake him, any information I could gather on my employer seemed to be of the utmost importance. Miss Eliza had fallen asleep, her delicate form draped onto my shoulder. It made it exceedingly difficult to drive the Silver Ghost, but I wouldn't have moved her for all the gold in the world. It was already dark by that time. I was having a time of it, trying to navigate the car by street lamps. Headlights are a modern inventions I thank god for everyday. I was surprised to see an incredibly bright point of light coming from a ways down Hayes Street. It was much brighter than any gas lamp I had seen before, not surprising because it was much, much bigger. There was no name on the sign, the fire had scorched it off, but there was no doubt in my mind that this raging inferno had once been the tall man's little shop on Hayes Street. So this was what 'protection money' protected people from. I shuddered at the thought of Mr. Carson's old friend still inside. The fire department did was on sight, scrambling madly trying to put out the flames. There was a very real danger of the fire engulfing a large chunk of the city. Despite the constant fog, San Francisco had a rather dry climate at the time. Perhaps disturbed by the heat. Miss Eliza stirred a little. She asked what was going on. I told her nothing, and kept driving. All the tall man had done was refuse to pay the organization. Mr. Carson had killed three of them. I shuddered to think what fate awaited him, and I saw no reason to worry Miss Eliza with that notion. I considered not returning to Mr. Carson's house. It wouldn't be safe there. The organization was in a killing mood. I thought about driving as far as the Silver Ghost could take me, taking Eliza with me to someplace far away. Of course, she would probably object to that idea, and once I ran out of gasoline we'd have to continue on foot. There were a thousand places to feed and rest your house, but very few convenient places to refuel an automobile. Silently I cursed myself for never learning how to ride. I finally resolved to return to Mr. Carson's house. Realistically speaking, I had nowhere else to go. I had just made my decision when it happened. The earth shook, the ground split open, and everything started to crumble and fall.[Chapter 7] Chapter Seven - Hell on Earth I don't remember falling asleep, but I must have. More likely I concussed myself. I had swerved to avoid a piece of falling debris, and in so doing I had driven Mr. Carson's precious Silver Ghost into a wall. Eliza shook me awake. On any other day, I would have been overjoyed that her radiant eyes were the first things I saw upon waking. But today it filled me with sadness, because it meant she was here with me in this terrifying peril. Still groggy, I took note of my surroundings. By some contrivance I have yet to understand, a great deal of Eliza's red carmine lip makeup had rubbed off on my clothes and face while I was asleep. No doubt the paper tube in her handbag had fallen out during the crash. As a result, I looked much more badly injured than I was, although the apparent bloodstains were all vaguely reminiscent of human lips. I probed at the car door and by some miracle it opened. Even thought it was still the dead of night, the sky above me had taken on the dark red pallor of a sunset. It nearly matched the deep carmine on my shirt and face. It didn't take long to find the cause of the strange luminescence. That tidy little fire at Mr. Stanton's shop, which had seemed so dreadful to me a moment ago, was now just one small part of a raging inferno. The fire, which would not have had much difficulty spreading, even in ideal conditions, was helped along on its way by the massive earthquake. Up and downs Hayes Street for what seemed like miles, I could see nothing but a red and yellow blaze. And this was not the only fire in San Francisco that night. The quake must have knocked over every lantern and broken every gas lamp in the city. What few buildings had not crumbled in the initial onslaught were now on fire. No doubt the fire patrols were hard at work all across the city, but this task was insurmountable. I gazed around me and beheld not San Francisco in the state of California, but rather a state of hell on Earth. I later learned that Chief Sullivan of the fire department died that night, hardly surprising. It's also worth noting that crumbling and ablaze are not mutually exclusive states for a building, especially an older building. Mr. Carson's holdings were almost exclusively older buildings, to the extent to which a building in San Francisco in 1906 could be considered 'old.' I shuddered to think of my employer's assets literally going \"up in smoke.\" This led me to think of my employer himself, an even more troubling prospect. No matter what kind of man Mr. Carson had been in his youth, he was undoubtedly old and frail now. I couldn't even be certain he had survived the initial earthquake, and his house was so full of glass and lamps and lanterns that after such a seismic event it could very well be a death trap. I imagined Mr. Carson's great mansion collapsing down around him. Burying him in a deluge of excess and luxury. Burying him and all his wonderful money. That's when I knew I had to do something. To her credit, Eliza was not especially hysterical. At least, she was not any more hysterical than was reasonable at a time like this. There was pandemonium in the streets. In the immediate vicinity alone, I caught sight of seven bodies lodged within the rubble, two of them children. \"What about grandfather?\" was all she said, but she said it more than once. I couldn't answer her question because I didn't have an answer. The odds were good that he was already dead, but I couldn't give up on him before I even looked, at least, not while Eliza was watching. This was a dark and troubling time, perhaps the single most dreadful experience of my entire life. But it was also a great opportunity. Every man longs for a chance to prove his bravery in front of the woman he loved. I resolved then and there that I would brave the inferno, the crumbling buildings, and the raging mob in order to rescue Miss Eliza's grandfather. But damned is I was going to do it on foot. The only reason the mob had not turned on Eliza and I, with our fine looking clothes and our apparent wealth, was that they were, for the moment, too preoccupied with their own survival. In a few moments, the majority of them would escape immediate danger, some through death. But those who remained alive would realize that society could not punish them for crimes committed in such an atmosphere, what survived of San Francisco would be theirs for the taking. Miss Eliza, a pretty girl in expensive clothes, was exactly the sort of unattainable treasure a man might seek on a night like this. I know that, had I not been the one charged with her protection, I would most certainly have cast an eye to her in that regard. With Eliza's help I managed to drag the Silver Ghost into the street. I was ashamed to ask a woman for help with physical labor, but I was still groggy from my injuries, and it was a necessity of survival. To gain better footing, Miss Eliza had to remove the very expensive, and very impractical shoes that Mr. Carson had bought for her. The Bunkhouse boys and Mr. Stanton were the two farthest things from my mind at that moment. All the problems of the past few weeks seemed to suddenly shrink in significance. I began to think of Lou and the boys at the Mission St. Antoine , not to mention the friends and companions of my childhood. I'd lay good odds that most of them were dead, and that thought sat in the back of my mind and felt like knot tied twice over in the pit of my stomach. Not two hours ago Ms. Eliza and I had been watching Carmen at the Grand Opera House. For one brief shining moment, I had been in high society. Now, as if God had crafted a grand punishment for my impertinence, I found myself in a city of endless flames. It was to the same God who crafted that punishment that I said a silent prayer as I ignited the Silver Ghost. Automobiles were tough, built from the hardest metals, made to withstand impacts. Even if the Silver Ghost was not nearly so aesthetically pleasing as it had been before, it was not ridiculous to expect it to still run. At first, the engine did not ignite. I cursed, out loud. Miss Eliza heard me. She seemed appropriately shocked, and I was appropriately shamed. No doubt I had revealed myself as the coarse person I was, but perhaps that had been my appeal to young Miss Eliza all along. A second attempt at restarting the Silver Ghost was equally fruitless. I felt like a fool, standing in front of my auto and turning a tiny crank while the world burned around me. Off in the distance, I heard an explosion, then another. It was unmistakably the sound of dynamite. When a building was too far-gone, the fire department would often destroy it utterly, reasoning that stable pile of bricks was preferable to an unstable tenement. The frequency of the explosions alarmed me. Perhaps tomorrow a good portion of the city would be naught but dust and echoes. The last explosion I head was softer than the rest. It took me a moment to realize that it was the engine on the Silver Ghost bursting back to life. I did a brief sign of the cross, although I was not too familiar with the gesture and probably did it wrong, and I offered God my undying thanks. Presently, I climbed back into the driver's compartment of the Silver Ghost, that crown jewel of the Rolls Royce Motor Company, and was surprised to fine Miss Eliza sitting next to me. She claimed that she was far too frightened to sit alone in the passenger compartment. I certainly wasn't going to complain. In a brief second we were off and away, winding through the crowds and the fire and the crumbling debris. The city was barely recognizable, but I knew that I had to find my way back to Mr. Carson's house. It might already have been too late, but I had to try.[Chapter 8] Chapter 8: Known As The Rat It was a miracle that Mr. Carson's house was still standing. However, aside from the fact that it was still standing, it wasn't in terribly good shape. The great glass windows through which my employer had spied upon his city lay on the ground, a shattered mess. The entire building was not in flames, but the surrounding flames licked eagerly at the walls. The grounds were lost to us. Mr. Carson's magnificent garden, the vast hedges, the rosebushes he paid a man $50 a week to cultivate but never touched himself, all gone in mere seconds. What an unrelenting force, is fire, what cunning and cruelty it displays when unleashed upon the world. By the world, I should say, for it was the earth itself that unleashed this nightmare upon us. The earth shook, and San Francisco shattered. It was a patchwork of fire and glass, just like Mr. Carson's house had become. It wasn't bravery that compelled me to go inside and search for Mr. Carson. I would never describe myself as a brave man, and if I wouldn't it's safe to assume that no one else ever would. No, it was Miss Eliza's tearful eyes that forced my hand. If it had been mere bravery, I would no doubt have insisted that Miss Eliza remain in the car, and stay safe. Instead I let her follow me in, crying for her grandfather all the while. I could hardly blame her. Her father had all but sold her, and her mother was dead, there wasn't much left for her in this world except William Carson. The main hall was a scene of devastation. The assorted relics and trophies Mr. Carson had collected throughout his lifetime, once proudly displayed in glass cases, lay strewn about the floor in a sea of jagged glass pieces. As Mr. Carson's valet, I had spent a fair amount of time polishing those cases, and had familiarized myself with every knick-knack, every souvenir from the bad old times. Eliza was off like a shot before I could stop her, she clambered up the staircase to face god knows what danger on the second floor. For a moment, I was too stunned to follow after her. I spotted dark spot on the floor in the shape of a man's body, and I feared the worst. Upon closer examination, I couldn't help but last. The shape I'd seen on the floor was not Mr. Carson's body, but his old uniform. He'd kept it in a case in the main hall too, and it had retained its shape as it fell. Although I was by no means \"out of the woods,\" the sight of that gray Confederate uniform with \"Carson\" stitched to the front filled me with hope. As a general rule, Mr. Carson didn't like to talk about his past, but he was all too eager to tell of his heroic exploits in the Third Cavalry. His stories were often vague and haphazard, details shifting between each telling, showing the limitations of an old man's memory. He had one particular favorite story though, that he recalled with all the crispness of his old uniform. How often he'd tell me about the battle at Branston Bridge, how he'd heroically struggled through a days long siege to push on westward. He'd told me of a captain, another man without a name, who drank his courage before the first and second attack each day. In the end, Mr. Carson destroyed the bridge, ended the fighting and saved hundred of lives. I found out sometime later that the Third Cavalry hadn't been at Branston Bridge, and the confederates that were there were retreating to the east, not pushing west. That wasn't the only peculiar thing about Mr. Carson's military records. In the arduous, ultimately fruitless process of trying to claim Mr. Carson's military pension, I'd stumbled upon a hospital report that claimed he'd lost an eye. So far as I could tell, Mr. Carson didn't wear a glass eye. He might have just been very good at hiding his injury. Upon examining the fallen uniform, I noted an eye patch tucked discretely under the hat. Of course, how utterly fitting. While lost in my reverie, I didn't notice Mr. Carson descending the staircase, leaning on Eliza for support. \"Hey Blondie!\" he called out from across the room. I nearly died of fright. \"What the hell is going on out there?\" \"There's been a quake.\" I said. It sounded so simple when put into words, but that quake had brought with it such pandemonium, such utter terror, that mere words could never do it justice. \"The city is burning.\" I offered weakly. Mr. Carson let go of Eliza and walked towards me. I saw then that she had been leaning on him for support, not the other way 'round. Eliza slumped onto the stairs, near unconscious. Mr. Carson looked out one of the holes where a window had been, and saw the distant flames of San Francisco. \"Blondie, would you say I own about…half of this city?\" Mr. Carson asked, staring off into the distance. It seemed to me a very generous estimation, but not wanted to offend, I replied in the affirmative. \"My half is not going to burn.\" Mr. Carson said with much too strong a sense of conviction. Before I knew it we were both in Mr. Carson's armory. The display cases in this room had suffered the same fate as the cases in the main hall. Weapons and ammunition were strewn about the floor. From out of the rubble, Mr. Carson pulled out the gun that had been in his room. It was almost an antique, assembled from pieces of older guns that had worn out long ago. \"Mr. Carson, this is foolishness.\" I said, perhaps a bit too firmly. \"You're an old man, all you're going to do is get yourself killed.\" \"No, I'll tell you what I'm going to do: I'm going to put out the fires, get the people off the street, protect my goddamn investments. Isn't that what you're supposed to be doing?\" \"There's panic out there, pandemonium, hundreds of people looting rioting it's impossible.\" \"Blondie, there's two kinds of people in this world. The kind who say 'it's impossible' and let the whole world go to hell, and the kind who say 'no.' As long as my granddaughter is up there, I'm not going to be the first kind.\" \"If you really love her, you'll get in the Silver Ghost and drive away. Take her somewhere safe.\" I suggested. It seemed like the only logical course of action. \"Just run away, eh?\" Mr. Carson said with contempt. \"And then keep on running, one town to another? No, I gave that up, Amigo. A long time ago.\" \"Mr. Carson,\" I said as calmly as I could under the circumstances, \"the city is lost.\" \"No, the city is still there.\" Mr. Carson retorted. \"The fire may burn, and we all may crumble to dust, but San Francisco stands unbroken.\" \"You'd need an army, Mr. Carson.\" \"Ah, you forget, Amigo, an army came to see us just last week.\" It took me a moment to realize what Mr. Carson meant. \"You mean the bunkhouse boys?\" I asked in astonishment. \"Si. If there's as many of them as they say, we can get the city cleaned up, not problem.\" \"Why would they want to help us? You killed three of them, remember?\" \"Who says they want to? I'll explain things to them my way, the old way. I tell them they got no choice.\" Upon saying this, Mr. Carson made a threatening gesture with his piecemeal pistol. \"If you're going to kill yourself.\" I said with a sigh. \"I might as well go with you, or were you gonna die alone?\" I reached down to grab one of the pistols on the floor, but Mr. Carson slammed his foot down in front of my hand. \"Oh no, no. No pistol amigo.\" \"You mean you don't want my help?\" I was almost relieved to hear this. Duty compelled me to accompany my employer into battle, but as I said before, I am not a brave man. \"No, I mean you take a rifle.\" Mr. Carson replied. \"You can't soot for shit, maybe with a rifle you do better.\" \"What about Eliza?\" I asked with some trepidation. I didn't want Mr. Carson to drag her along into a warzone. Mr. Carson simply shook his head. \"She stays. Safer here. Not safe, but safer.\" I couldn't help but agree. \"The bunkhouse boys won't be happy to see us.\" I offered, somewhat superfluously. \"Ah, don't worry about those idiots. They cross me and leave me alive? They know nothing about Tuco.\" \"What's Tuco?\" \"My name, Blondie. Maybe you better start calling me that, if you're going to be my son-in-law.\" My heart skipped a beat when Mr. Carson said those words: Son-in-law. Evidently, in her agitated state, Miss Eliza had told Mr. Carson more than she'd planned to. His non-reaction to the news was a great relief to me, although I hadn't seriously considered the prospect of marriage before now. The two of us said our goodbyes to Miss Eliza before heading back into that hell. We were the men in her life, we two, I the lover, he the father (or grandfather as the case may be). Though both Mr. Carson and I had done out share of evil deeds, and Mr. Carson had the deep regret of abandoning a family, we three were the finest family I have ever been a part of. Mr. Carson, or Tuco, as he liked to be called, rode shotgun in the Silver Ghost. The idea of riding shotgun in an automobile would have seemed ludicrous to me mere days before, but now it was a sad necessity. With Eliza safely tucked away in the crumbling mansion, Tuco and I set off to enlist the bunkhouse boys, and restore order to the city.[Chapter 9] Chapter 9: The Ivory Sickle The main headquarters of the so-called \"Bunkhouse Boys\" was not at all difficult to find. A tavern of ill repute on the harbor's edge called \"The Ivory Sickle.\" I was loath to admit it, but it wasn't too terribly far-removed from the Mission St. Antoine. The key difference was not found in the clientele, who were of a uniform coarseness in appearance and demeanor. Rather the key difference between the two establishments was that Mr. Carson's tavern did not have rooms to let. The Ivory Sickle had several rooms on the second floor, and one permanent resident. He went by the obvious alias of \"Bill Black\" and served as the de facto leader of the unruly mob known as the 'bunkhouse boys.' No doubt at some time in the distant past, he had been a resident of the gang's namesake bunkhouse. It struck me as odd that a former cattleman, or \"cow-boy\" as we now refer to them, would sink to such depths of depravity, to robbery and violence and extortion. True, members of that profession were not known for their civility, but they were to a man trustworthy enough to be left in charge of a herd of livestock in the open desert for days on end. Of course, not everyone who had lived in a bunkhouse was a cattleman, and perhaps I had romanticized the profession in my mind. If I had, I was certainly in good company. In any case, the Ivory Sickle seemed as good a place as any to begin our search for Mr. Bill Black. Negotiation was not a strong suit of mine, nor, I suspected, a strong suit of Mr. Carson's. However, in light of the current circumstances, if Bill Black refused to put the considerable manpower at his disposal to use in cleaning up the city, he was even less of a man than I thought he was. A racket like Mr. Black's required civilization in order to function. That's why there were no 'protection rackets' in the untamed reaches of the West. Only here in San Francisco where civilization had taken hold. But its grasp on the American West was tenuous at best, and after this night of reckoning, San Francisco may well have fallen beyond repair. If there were any semblance of a soul within Mr. Black, he would recognize that helping the city was the right thing to do. And if there weren't, surely he would realize that it was good for business. The trip over was eventful to say the least. The last vestiges of law and order had been burned away by the fire. At every street corner we rounded, a gang of ravenous looters claimed what they could from the smoldering remains of San Francisco. I drove as fast as I could, over the roads that weren't damaged. However, the debris and crowds that cluttered the streets slowed our pace enough to make us vulnerable. For a moment I considered gunning the accelerator and running over the thronging crowds. It would certainly make for a funny obituary, a man trampled by a horseless carriage. Still, my conscience prevented me from doing anything that extreme. After all, there people were just afraid, trying to escape the fires and the tremors in any way they could. Mostly, they parted in front of our Silver Ghost, and left a clear path. The sight of Mr. Carson riding shotgun was enough to deter most of them from trying anything funny. I must say, Mr. Carson is the only man I've ever known who could \"ride shotgun\" with a pistol. At one point, as we careened down Battery Street, a crowd of angry, desperate men blocked out path. The fact that we were in an automobile made it clear we were among the city's elite, and like always, that made us the target for the people's aggression. As if any person could be blamed for an act of God. The men were unarmed, but had no intention of moving. One of them stepped to the front. He seemed to speak for the whole crowd. He recognized Mr. Carson, and apparently had some sort of enmity for him. He'd managed to rile the crowd enough to go along with him. Apparently the man was a resident of one of Mr. Carson's substandard apartment buildings, and somehow blamed him for the fire. The point was that there men had no intention of moving, and they were halting our progress. I suggested that Mr. Carson attempt to negotiate with them, but he had other ideas. He pulled out his piecemeal pistol and fired into the crowd five times. After a brief pause, he fired once more. The crowd scattered, and to my amazement, there were no bodies left on the ground, nor any trace of blood. Mr. Carson aim had to be supernaturally bad in order to fire at such close range and miss. I made a comment to that effect and Mr. Carson trained his gun on me. \"Don't laugh, Blondie.\" He said with a snarl. \"When I miss I miss very good. And I don't kill anybody who owes me rent.\" With that, he pulled the trigger one more time. I supposed I should have realized the gun was empty, but I still flinched. That was enough to get a laugh out of him. \"You mean, you shot directly at a crowd that thick and hit nothing? That's amazing!\" \"Eh, it's nothing.\" Mr. Carson replied. \"I know one guy, he can shoot through a rope at 500 feet.\" \"500 feet? That impossible.\" I said with a laugh. \"Eh, maybe so.\" Mr. Carson shrugged. \"So are we going or not?\" I stared up the Silver Ghost again and we headed directly for the Ivory Sickle. Usually driving around the city at night, even by gas lamp, was an unpleasant ordeal. However, the fire that night would put any gaffer to shame. Sand Francisco was as bright at one o'clock in the morning as it had ever been during the day. As if to prove that there was no justice in the world, The Ivory Sickle was one of the few buildings in the city that seemed absolutely untouched. Neither the earthquake nor the fire had left any visible mark on the façade. Mr. Carson wasted no time. He walked in, drew his pistol, and shot the first person he saw. Five then one, like before. \"There are two kinds of people in the world!\" He bellowed at the bars remaining patrons. \"Those who work for me, and those who got holes in their head.\" He waved his gun around the bar. I, for my part, kept my rifle at the ready. \"You the bunkhouse boys?\" He demanded. It was so like him to ask this question only after he had killed a man. Most of the members of the crowd nodded. \"Well now you're Tuco's boys, understand?\" The crowd nodded again. \"The city's on fire, and you boys are gonna put it out.\" \"Why should we listen to you, old man?\" One of the boy's asked incredulously. He was dead before he hit the floor. \"That's why!\" Mr. Carson roared. \"Any man doesn't do what I say, I send him to hell! Go and tell Bill Black that!\" One of the former Bunkhouse Boys, no doubt fearing for his life, explained to use that Bill Black was no longer there. He'd seen the two of us approaching from his upstairs window, and fled. That was, perhaps, the worst thing Bill Black could have done. Now his men knew he was afraid of us, and their diminishing respect for him became an increasing respect for us. I won't bore you with the details of our other late night raids that evening, but suffice to say that the remainder of the Bunkhouse Boys switched allegiance fairly easily. Of course, we didn't merely take the underling's word that Bill Black had fled. Tuco insisted on checking himself. After some gentle prodding with my rifle, the concierge informed us that Black was in \"Room four, senor.\" Of course, we checked rooms one through three along the way, and upon finding them to be deserted, Mr. Carson and I broke into room four. The window was open, showing signs of Mr. Black's recent departure, and lying on the bed was a hastily scrawled note from the man, only three words long. It read: See you soon.[Chapter 10] Chapter 10: You Know What You Are The fire brigade suffered heavy casualties that night, as did the Bunkhouse Boys, although that was partly Tuco's doing. The army arrived the following morning, ready to provide additional support. In what seemed like no time at all, the fires were out, the angry mobs had been quelled, and all seemed right with the world. Mr. Carson received a commendation for mobilizing so many \"volunteer firemen\" at such short notice. The authorities quietly forgot any signs of the two murders at The Ivory Sickle. Buildings had crumbled and the turned to dust, but San Francisco stood unbroken. I had never been, nor was I ever again, so very tired. Mr. Carson and I had been out all night and all day. As a leader of the community, it was expected for Mr. Carson to be involved in the reconstruction, but no one had expected his contributions to be more than monetary. For my part, I had never seen Mr. Carson so alive. He walked without the aid of a cane, and jumped and shouted and generally carried on like a much younger man. For that day, I felt almost as if he were my contemporary. It wasn't until after we'd helped to set up the emergency aid tents, and after the interim fire marshal and the General in charge of clean-up operations had personally thanked him that he began to show the first signs of fatigue. He climbed into the back of the Silver Ghost, and suddenly he seemed four decades older. It was easy to forget that Mr. Carson was nearly a centenarian. His breathing was heavy and stilted, and he slumped over in his seat and remained quiet for what seemed like an eternity. \"Shall we go home, Tuco?\" I asked when I could bear the silence no longer. \"No, Blondie, not right now…\" He said. \"I want to go back to that place we used to go, back to that sad, sad hill…I want to see Pablo.\" Mr. Carson didn't have to say another word. I took him to the same place I had taken him every week for over a year: the cemetery. We didn't have the wheelchair with us, so I had to support Mr. Carson on his way up the hill. In no time at all we were in front of the grave of Pablo Ramirez. It wasn't until now that I noted the shared surname between this Pablo and Mr. Carson's true identity. Suddenly I saw all those past visits to Pablo's grave in a new light. Mr. Carson struggled to stand in front of the gravestone under his own power, and I attempted to give him some privacy. He spoke to the tombstone in Spanish. He must have thought I didn't know the language. If it weren't for my father's insistence on international schooling in my formative years, I would never have known what he said. \"Well Pablo,\" he said in a hushed tone. \"One time you asked me what I'd done with my life, aside from evil. I just kept the city from eating itself…I put out the fires…that's something, isn't it? That's something….\" Mr. Carson trailed off for a moment. I pretended not to notice there were tears in his eyes. We pulled up to the house a half hour later, and it was immediately clear that something was wrong. There was an unfamiliar horse tied up outside, and the grounds were eerily quiet. Suddenly the words of Bill Black's note took on a whole new meaning, \"see you soon\" indeed. The two of both arrived at the same conclusion wordlessly. We each grabbed our respective firearms and readied ourselves. There are a very few occasions where having a large house is a disadvantage. This was definitely one of them. Miss Eliza could have been anywhere in the house, and so could the rider of that horse. \"You realize that that's probably Bill Black's horse?\" I asked. Mr. Carson nodded in ascent. \"And if he is in there, Eliza is in there with him.\" Mr. Carson nodded again, and brandished his pistol. \"Tuco...\" I said with some trepidation. \"I've never shot anybody before.\" \"You picked a hell of a time to start.\" Mr. Carson said, smiling. \"Come on, let's go.\" And with that, we rushed into the house, guns at the ready. Our search didn't go on for too long. Almost immediately we heard a piercing feminine shriek from the top of the stairway. We turned to see Miss Eliza, still clad in her gown from the night before, gripped roughly by a gargantuan man who held a pistol to her temple. He wore a pinstriped suit and a bowler hat, and had a scare running down the right side of his face. \"Senor Ramirez!\" he shouted down into the main hall. \"So good to see you! And your little dog too.\" No personal insult could make me as angry as Bill Black mistreating Miss Eliza, but referring to me as a dog came fairly close. \"Come on up.\" Black said, affecting an affable tone. \"Step into my office.\" His so-called \"office\" was a broken down section of the upstairs hallway where the rafters were exposed. Black was ready for us. He'd draped two hangman's nooses over rafters and set one of Mr. Carson's expensive mahogany chairs under each of them. \"One for you, one for him.\" Black said to Mr. Carson, somewhat superfluously. \"You killed five of my people, made me look like a fool.\" \"You didn't need any help to look like a fool.\" I interrupted, somewhat unwisely. \"Shut up!' Black snarled, pressing his gun against Miss Eliza's breast. \"Who the hell are you anyway?\" I had no answer for that. At that moment, I could not even remember how I'd become entangled in this disastrous chain of events. \"Get up there.\" Black commanded, gesturing towards the chairs with his head. \"I don't need to tell you what happens if you don't.\" He didn't. Dutifully, Mr. Carson and I climbed onto the chairs and put the ropes around our necks. \"Good.\" He said with an evil smile. He pulled his gun away from Miss Eliza, but my relief at seeing her out of danger was short lived. A split second later he turned the gun towards us and fired four shots. Suddenly the chairs were no longer beneath us. I could feel the noose tightening around my neck, and I swear I could feel the devil bite me on the ass. My breathing became labored, and in a few more seconds, my vision faded, and all I could see was a deadly, silent blackness. There was a sound of thunder, then another, and another. The next thing I felt was a sharp pain in my shoulder. I opened my eyes to see that I was lying on the ground. Mr. Carson was lying next to me. He smiled, a firm, knowing smile. \"I told you.\" He said. He gestured to the end of the rope and, to my amazement, the end of both ropes had been burned through, as if by a bullet. The window in front of us, one of the only windows in the house left intact by the earthquake, had been shattered, and Bill Black lay dead on the floor in front of us. Eliza was still in a state of shock. She had been under that maniac's power for an entire night, who knows what horrors she had seen? She embraced Mr. Carson warmly, and then turned her attention to me. \"What just happened?\" I asked, astonished. \"Even a filthy beggar like me has got a protecting angel.\" Mr. Carson said, turning to the shattered window. \"There's a golden haired angel watching over us.\" The next few weeks were some of the happiest of my life. Mr. Carson, Miss Eliza and I all lived together, just like a family. The city was rebuilt, bit by bit, until it was stronger and more magnificent that it was before. For one brief, shining moment, all the joy in the world seemed to be within my grasp. But nothing lasts forever. The exertion of that night was too much for a man his age to bear. It wasn't long before his heart gave out. He went out silently in his sleep, and we found him with a smile on his face. He left nearly all his worldly possessions to Eliza, as expected. I say nearly all because he bequeathed one very special object to me: his automobile, the 1906 Rolls Royce Silver Ghost. It was a message, plain as day. It was Mr. Carson's last instructions to me from beyond the grave. Miss Eliza wanted us to be married. She said that we could share the money as equals, and live together in her grandfather's magnificent house. I sometimes wonder what would have happened if I'd stayed, how different my life could have been. But Mr. Carson gave me the Silver Ghost for a reason. He knew what I was, and so did I. I climbed in that very evening and drove away, and to this day, I have never looked back. No matter how happy I was with Eliza, I'm sure the itch would have hit me eventually. I didn't want to be like Mr. Carson, leaving a chain of broken families in my wake. Instead, I wandered, doing odd jobs, seeking my fortune. When people ask me my name, I don't say Whitey Alabaster anymore. I tell them to call me Blondie. ","Summary":" Chapter 1: Tombstone for a Man with No Name It was in the winter of nineteen aught six, at the age "},{"Movie":"Human Centipede","Title":"Syndromia","Author":"idreamedofstardust","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7480986","Passage":"[Chapter 1] Alright, so as disgusting and poorly acted as this movie is, I couldn't help but be interested in the surgeon's character. Yes, yes, call me disturbing, call me gross, call me a waste of space. BUT, I've made a promise to myself to not make this story descend into how the movie was. Meaning that I'm not going to write too much gore or bad dialogue...although that was pretty entertaining in a very comedic way. This story will actually have a plot centered around an OC of mine who was picked up by Jenny and Lindsey before they got their flat tire, and the surgeon whom I really wish to explore and analyze. And I hate boring stories so of course I'm going to add in my spice and mystery and change certain things. I just hope that you keep an open mind despite the fact that this is one of the last movies anyone would every write a fanfic for. Call me demented, but my idea just morphed into something I had to write. Anywho, as always, enjoy! Chapter 1 - Abrasive Autumn \"Abby Post,\" she introduced with a breathless grin, throwing her knapsack into the back seat. \"I'm Lindsey and this is Jenny,\" the two American women introduced with friendly smiles. Don't look like serial killers. Thank god they speak English. My butchered German would have probably gotten me killed eventually. \"Kind of late to be hitchhiking,\" Jenny noted as the door slammed shut. \"Well try telling that to Hans \"the Assgrabber\". He's this cute German guy I met who wouldn't keep his paws off me. I ditched him at a diner a few miles away when he went to the bathroom.\" Lindsey and Jenny exchanged glances, pleased with the answer. Smiling reassuringly, Abby was only thankful that they believed the lie. And that they offered her a ride. \"I'm surprised you guys picked me up. It's the kind of hour that I expected killers to be lurking about,\" she commented, studying the darkness that had swiftly encompassed the woods as the car began moving. \"Please. I told Jenny that you looked cool and here I was, right all along. We're actually going to a party right now.\" \"Oh?\" \"Yep. I think the party is in a large city so I'm sure that you can find a ride back to wherever you're staying,\" Jenny answered, studying the shivering girl in the rearview mirror. Lifting the corner of her lips up again, Abby sighed internally. What a great mess the whole day turned out to be. And the worst part was that she was no closer to finding what it is that she came to Germany for. Tuning out momentarily Jenny and Lindsey's argument regarding directions, Abby closed her eyes in solace, attempting to fight back a cancerous migraine. The past three days were spent locked up in her hotel room, attempting to understand the puzzle before her eyes. So many loose ends remained to it and her mother's involuntary help certainly wasn't doing any good. I remember he said Berlin. Something about Berlin. Acknowledging grudgingly that the thought wouldn't reach her, Abby ripped her focus away from the past and set it firmly into the present. \"A little trouble?\" Abby questioned. \"No,\" Jenny spat before throwing an apologetic glance toward Abby. \"Sorry. It's just...I swear that these directions are like reading a fucking encyclopedia in Chinese.\" Abby expelled a tired laugh as Lindsey rolled her eyes. \"By the time you learn to speak Chinese, it'll be next year. Just let me look at it, alright?\" Grabbing the map from her hands, Lindsey flipped on a car light and studied it. \"Shit,\" she answered two minutes later. \"We passed the road.\" \"Damn it!\" Jenny yelled, slapping her palm against the steering wheel in frustration. A loud POP! erupted from outside as Jenny momentarily lost control of the car before getting control and pulling it slowly off to the side. \"You have got to be fucking kidding me,\" she ground out again. Although Abby didn't say it out loud, her thoughts were along those lines exactly. Being stuck in the middle of nowhere and not being able to continue what she'd came to the country for, especially when she was so near to the answer, was nearly death itself. Luckily, Abby was resourceful and one of her first of many failed relationships had been with a mechanic. Not only had he inherited his father's business, but also his intense love and devotion to cars. Not much happened in the relationship department, having been in love with his vintage Mustang much more, but their first date did involve her learning how to replace a tire. \"I'm guessing this is a rental car?\" Abby asked once Jenny had calmed down. \"Yes.\" Nodding her head, Abby swung open the door and felt her teeth chatter loudly. It was brutally cool out and a storm was approaching. The smell was embalmed into the atmosphere. Her eyes were forced to spring open and nearly teared up as the wind whipped at her vision without mercy. Briefly glancing at the large tear in the tire, Abby hugged herself tighter as the wind picked up and splayed her black tresses around. Jenny popped open the trunk from inside the car and as Abby took in the empty space, a frustrated \"Shit\" flew through her lips. \"What's wrong?\" Slamming the trunk down, Abby threw herself back inside the car. \"No spare tire. Not in the trunk, not under the car either.\" Visibly shaking at her words, Jenny attempted to breathe in calmly as Lindsey glared at the road ahead. And right on cue, thunder sounded loudly in the distance, followed by the pouring of rain that fell like pistols. Is this really happening? Please let this be a prank. You can come down God and tell me that your sense of humor got carried away and stranding a 22 year old girl in the German woods was your entertainment for the night. Alas, Abby's wish never came true and within minutes, the rain evolved into a near deafening beat as it slapped the metal on top of the car with vicious precision. \"We could try to find a town or house?\" Lindsey suggested. \"I am not getting my hair wet,\" was Jenny's firm reply. Studying the two, Abby blew out a lethargic breath. While she did end up lucky with who ended up picking her up, Abby noticed the lack of real life experiences the two women held. It wasn't anything horrible per se, but it only reaffirmed that she'd have to be the negotiator. \"Well, it's either wait in this car until morning or until someone passes by or we try to find some place to dry off,\" Abby input with an air of finality. They both shared a look, mulling over their options. \"We're walking,\" Lindsey stated, swinging open her door. Abby followed and after a few minutes of mumbling to herself, Jenny poked her head out of the car and begrudgingly set after the duo. APHAPHAPHAPH As soon as the house staggered into view, Abby felt a cold chill rush through her. It had nothing to do with the storm banging away at them, nor the continuous bickering from her companions. No, this was a legitimate chill that had crept down her shoulders, all the way to her spinal cord and ended with a splurge, somewhere at her lower back. \"Finally!\" Jenny cried in relief. Before Abby had a chance to voice her discomfort, the two women were sprinting across the vast lawn. \"My god, this is just like a horror movie,\" Abby muttered as raindrops meandered down her cheeks. \"And they usually get killed if they don't follow their instinct.\" Abby's instinct was very obviously letting her know that the whole area had nothing but a malignant vibe about it. \"C'mon Abby,\" Lindsey shouted from the distance. The rain had become so heavy that Abby could only make out deformed bodies through the downpour. \"What are the chances of it being a serial killer's house?\" But no amusement reached her lips and against her will, Abby began a sprint toward the massive house. APHAPHAPHAPH \"Hello! Help! Hey!\" Lindsey repeated the same words, banging hopelessly on the door. Abby stood behind them, keeping her lips in a straight line. The closer she'd gotten to the house, the more unease she felt. It was ridiculous of course to feel malicious vibes from a house, but the feeling refused to leave her no matter how many comforting thoughts she'd tried to pick at. Jenny pounded on the door again while Lindsey shouted. It was as if the door had been made for incessant banging at eleven in the evening by two American women. Abby's gaze however strayed toward the window and with squinted eyes, she took in the man staring at them. His eyes first zoned in on the two women at the door, banging harshly against it before setting back in an almost surprised gesture, at Abby. Meeting his eyes, Abby tilted her head. The level of strange only seemed to intensify as she briefly wondered why he took the time to peek out his window. If he had nothing to worry about, wouldn't he just open it without checking to see who it was? Did he have something to hide? The man tore away his gaze first and Abby knew what was coming. For goodness sake, this is just a house. We're going to get in, get help, and go home. The door slowly opened and a tall man greeted them with cautious eyes. \"Thank god,\" Jenny sputtered. \"Our car broke down a few miles away. We've been walking for a really long time. Could we come inside?\" Lindsey simply nodded her head, her teeth chattering so badly that a proper word couldn't leave her lips. The man observed the two women silently before resting his gaze on Abby. Abby only stared back, her green eyes narrowing almost challengingly. After what seemed like a minute, he gestured with his head inside. Jenny and Lindsey threw themselves in to the heated house with relief, but Abby stayed glued to her place on the ground. Am I really going to deny myself warmth just because this guy's house is setting me on the edge? \"Are you coming in?\" he demanded, his dark brown eyebrows forming a straight, steel line. \"I-,\" Abby began, unsure where all of her caution came from, especially since Jenny and Lindsey didn't seem to feel it around the man, \"yeah.\" Glancing down at her feet, Abby stepped into the house and immediately responded to the warm with a purr that had her tongue rolling at the sensation. \"Thank you,\" Abby responded, turning her form toward the man. All the peace that had momentarily settled in her, vanished as she watched the man lock the door not six, but seven times before pocketing the key used for five of the keyholes. \"Paranoid about a home invasion?\" Abby joked, her voice coming out weaker than intended. Taking in a breath, the man focused on something behind her. \"You can never be too careful,\" he replied, his obvious accent causing the words to come out distorted and aggressive. Nodding her head, Abby turned back around and began to walk forward. I am not going to compare this to the Green Mile. I am not going to compare this to the Green Mile. Instead, she focused on the striking paintings marring his white walls. The further down the hall she got, the more obvious it was that the man was rich. Nearly screaming out luxurious, the house indicated just in its vastness from the outside that it was bought with a sense of superiority. Not too many furniture pieces littered one place and as Abby entered the living room, the bleak manila couch and matching recliners nearly showcased a sign above them that signified their expensiveness. Currently seated on the ornate furniture were Jenny and Lindsey, soaking and dripping wet. \"Could you call the nearest rental car place?\" Jenny questioned as soon as the man entered the living room. Abby stood next to the seats, unable to find the will to sit down. The man met her eyes with a somewhat confused glance before seating himself. \"Our car broke down a few miles away,\" Jenny added again, as if her statement would explain their sudden appearance. \"Yes,\" he answered slowly. This time, Abby was proud to notice that the way he answered had set off some sort of alarms in her friends' heads. \"Alright,\" Lindsey stated uncertainly. \"How far do you live from Berlin?\" The man carefully took his time answering the question. It was as if he was calculating a difficult math problem. \"50 miles,\" he gruffly replied. \"So you don't mind if we crash here until the ride comes, do you?\" Abby hid a smile as the man's eyebrows scrunched up. It was obvious that he wasn't one hundred percent up to date with American lingo. \"Can we stay here until the car service shows up?\" Abby translated after a minute of silence. Turning his head sharply, the man leaned back into the couch and monotonously answered, \"Yes.\" Seemingly satisfied with the reply, Jenny stood up and Lindsey soon did the same. \"Where's your bathroom?\" \"Nearest hallway, first door on left.\" It was said in the same detachment that he'd greeted them with. \"Right...well, we'll be right back.\" For a second, Abby thought that Jenny was referring to her but Lindsey soon crossed in front and followed Jenny down the hallway. Are you guys really leaving me with him? Really? Refusing to meet the gaze locked on to her, Abby's eyes flew over more paintings in the room. One in particular had her crinkling her brow in interest as her eyes explored a symmetrical blob coming together. \"Fascinating paintings,\" Abby muttered distractedly, \"do you live here with your wife?\" \"No,\" was his quick reply. This caused Abby to glance down and finally take a seat as his eyes seared straight through her. Leaning back, he lifted his head up as a hand clutched on to the couch in deep concentration. \"I don't like human beings.\" Lowering his head, he met Abby's eyes again with an open stare. \"You don't like human beings?\" Abby repeated in confusion. The words bounced around on her tongue, strange and foreign. \"Why not?\" she finally asked, her curiosity on overdrive at such a statement. Blowing in a genuine air of surprise, the man studied Abby skeptically as if deducing how serious she was about the question. \"I like being alone.\" Abby leaned back and expelled a giggle through her throat. \"What?\" was his sharp reply. \"You didn't answer my question...which technically is your own question. Being lonely doesn't justify your dislike for human beings. There are people who enjoy their privacy but still enjoy human company. In fact, I think human contact is necessary, good or bad, to be able to function. If we never had human contact, we'd still be in the age of the apes.\" This time, the man was the one to scrutinize her with something building behind his expression. Finally, he let out a short, quipped laugh that ended as soon as it began. \"What?\" Abby questioned this time, her cheeks sprouting a cherry red. \"Your childish psychology is amusing.\" Clenching a fist slightly, Abby observed the man lift the corner of his lips briefly as he stood up. \"I will go call the rental service.\" Nodding her head dumbly, Abby attempted to come up with something witty to reply. However, the opportunity passed by as quickly as their conversation had and she was only left to ponder on her own thoughts. Jerk. I bet he learned human compassion at the bottom of a lake...or from a pack of wolves. If Abby wasn't in such deep thought, she might have noticed that as the man spoke into the phone in German, his words didn't quite make sense. Having learned most of her German from a little phrasebook she'd kept in her knapsack as well as the residents of Berlin, Abby still wasn't completely deaf to the most basic interpretations of the language. These interpretations included questions regarding transportation. But she paid no mind to the conversation and allowed her scurried thoughts to drift from her current situation back to the reason she was in the country in the first place, unaware of the ways that her life would shortly and strangely become derailed. APHAPHAPHAPHA \"What the fuck did you do to her?\" Abby couldn't recognize whether it was Lindsey or Jenny that had screamed. Honestly, she wouldn't have been able to discern the difference if she tried. The world around was slowing down and all of the voices in the room had melted into a melodic pot. She had no sense of falling into unconsciousness, but a part of her understood her dangers clear and present. The glass of water slipped lazily from her hand and as the surroundings became blurry, Abby could only ponder her cursed situation. Damn it, damn it, damn it. I knew as soon as he asked...as soon as he brought the water. As soon as he yelled at Lindsey for spilling the water. But no...I just had to shove aside my discomfort to make it seem like I wasn't judging him on first impressions. Once I reach consciousness, I'm going to rip off his-. Another piercing yell lit up the warm surroundings as Abby gracelessly slipped against her own will into an unwanted sleep. I'm ready for the criticism. From most people's out look on the movie and some of the reviews I've read for other stories, I'm prepared to take a beating. Still, if there is interest, let me know your thoughts in a review :D![Chapter 2] So I have 1 review, thank you very much...I find it kind of cool that someone who's never even seen the movie, thought the chapter was alright. No alerts however, so the only person I'm writing so far is myself...I'm such a loser. But if anybody does decide to get into it, this chapter requires a thorough knowledge of the German language...or you could just scroll down to the very bottom of the page and read the translations I put for each phrase/word I used. Anywho, enjoy as I dissect my character and everyone around her...figuratively of course! Chapter 2 - Belligerent Bombshell As Abby's eyes struggled to flutter open, the brutal pounding of a five ton truck smashing into her was what electrified her entire body. From head to toe, a constant throbbing coursed through. This alone caused her to pause in the attempt at opening her eyes. Her mind cleverly used this time to recall all of the things that had led to her current limbo between consciousness and unconsciousness. And it was remembering the creepy house, the decision to ignore her instinct, Jenny and Lindsey, as well as being drugged at a most inconvenient time, that renewed Abby's will at attaining visual contact. As soon as her eyes sprang open however, Abby regretted it. The light, while it was dim, was intense and hit directly in the retinas causing her to slam her eyes hastily. Twitching, her nose picked up a sickeningly cleansing smell reminiscent of an overly polished hospital. Licking at her dry lips, Abby ventured another attempt at opening her eyes. This time she wished she'd kept them closed. \"Jesus.\" She was laying in a cot with her clothes nowhere in sight. Instead, a teal hospital gown covered her freezing form. But, that was not the worst part. Abby's eyes landed on her left hand just to see it bound to the side of the cot with an IV stuck in to her vein which wriggled every time she moved her arm. Swinging her head to the other side, Abby nearly groaned when the same thing met her glance. And then her eyes flickered up. Lindsey? Jenny? Both girls were passed out, but in the same garb as herself a few feet away. Their hands were bound to each side of the cot and they looked just as helpless. This isn't happening. Keeping her mouth shut to prevent herself from screaming, Abby heard a small squeak from her left. Turning her head reluctantly, Abby couldn't contain a gasp at the sight of a man who was wide awake with a gag in his mouth. He was struggling against his binds in vain but as soon as he'd seen Abby come to, his voice emerged. \"Mphm.\" Abby pulled harshly against the binds as panic crept into her. She noticed an IV in his arm as well and his pale complexion. He looked ill and the more he thrashed around, the less of a chance he had at savoring his strength. \"Don't struggle or you'll lose your energy,\" Abby softly commanded. The man met her eyes with fear and only continued fighting the binds. Abby felt her pulse jerk unsteadily as a new worry entered her. What the hell was she doing here? And when was the guy who'd drugged them, coming back? Most importantly, what did he want? \"Please, just calm down,\" she pleaded, her eyes glancing at the pacemaker beside him. The beat of his heart was increasing steadily, too fast for the amount of oxygen he was inhaling through his nostrils to catch up with. Whether his eyes finally took in the machine and realized his current danger or Abby's voice calmed him, the man eventually ended up restricting his movements and laying back on the cot. The entire time, his frightened blue eyes never strayed from Abby's. \"Do you speak English?\" Abby gently asked as his heart beat gradually became normal. Lifting an eyebrow, the man turned his head to stare up at the ceiling. Pearls of nervous sweat beads rolled down his face and tears soon mixed in. \"Shit,\" she mumbled, realizing that there was only one way to communicate with him. Mulling over everything she'd learned in the month that she'd been in the country, Abby took in a deep breath. \"Sind Sie gut?\" The man's head whipped around to stare at her, faint hope residing in his irises. He nodded his head uncertainly and Abby was relieved to find an established way of communication. All she had to do was make sure she worded things the right way. \"Gut. Wissen Sie...,\" Abby trailed off, her forehead crinkling in concetration. \"Sie sind hier gewesen?\" Although Abby knew that her German didn't translate perfectly, she trusted the man to know what her questions were. Nodding his head rapidly, the man's eyes welled up with more tears and Abby sucked in a breath. She had never seen so much pain, so much sorrow, so much unrelenting fear in a person's eyes before. It made her breath catch and heart quench. \"Ich heisse Abby,\" she informed softly, lowering her tone to make the man feel somewhat at ease. \"Ich bin von Vereinigte Staaten.\" She didn't know why she was telling him where she was from. It's not like that could magically cure his hellish predicament. Still, the more Abby talked, the calmer the man seemed. \"Halten Sie an,\" she stated, turning her head to her companions. Both Lindsey and Jenny hadn't stirred since Abby had awoken. Either they'd taken much more of what ever knocked them out than she had, or they were incredibly sound sleepers. \"Lindsey? Jenny?\" Abby whispered. Neither girl moved so Abby called their names again, louder this time. No result. \"Hmph.\" Switching sides, Abby met the man's gaze again. His eyes traveled up to the ceiling once more with fear fully replacing the blue in his eyes. Abby followed his gaze and heard the patter of footsteps above. \"Oben?\" she questioned more to herself than to the man. Her ears perked up only to hear the footsteps slowly fade away. Peeking cautiously at the door, Abby prayed that the man wouldn't make an appearance. The room they were currently lying in was set up like a makeshift laboratory or worse yet, doctor's workplace. Surgical tools as well as normal hospital gear lined some of the tables her eyes had trailed over. Near Lindsey and Jenny was a long, metal slab that glittered coldly in the grim room. Closing her eyes Abby finally allowed sputters of fear to enter her. Up to this point she'd hoped that there was some sort of misunderstanding. That her current placement could be explained as some cruel joke. That the man beside her was acting and Lindsey and Jenny were in on it. However, as more time trailed on and the two girls beside her failed to return from their nap, Abby felt a furious hopelessness strike her. This was not supposed to happen. All she'd wanted to do was find her-. Roughly shaking her head, Abby met the man's eyes beside her and took advantage of the fact that she could speak. \"Haben Sie eine Familie?\" The man nodded his head as the tears finally ceased their gravitational spiral down. \"Kinder?\" Another nod. \"Ein?\" A firm shake of the head caused Abby to visualize the phrase book's descriptions once more. \"Zwei?\" Another firm shake sideways. \"Drei?\" she asked in surprise. This time the man swung his head up and down eagerly as his eyes lit up. \"Gut. Alle jungen?\" He shook his head no. \"Alle Madchen?\" No was his answer again. Letting out a sigh, Abby asked, \"Zwei Madchen und ein Junge?\" Abby grinned as the man nodded his head in near excitement. Or as excited as one could be when they were forcibly restrained to a cot. \"Schone kinder?\" The man nodded his head again with obvious light in his eyes. \"Gut.\" After that, Abby's brain seemed to pause. No more German came to her and worse still was the sound of footsteps returning above. \"What the hell?\" Abby snapped her gaze to find Lindsey coming to, shaking her head in confusion. Her green eyes met Lindsey's who recognized just by her stare that something was off. And that was when she began screaming. \"What the fuck? Oh my god!\" Flinging herself up from the pillow like a jack in the box, Lindsey pulled against the restraints in vain before taking in Jenny's form to her right. \"Jenny! Wake up, Jenny. Oh god, please wake up!\" \"Lindsey,\" Abby warned, hearing the footsteps pause momentarily before shifting the opposite way of their original direction. Her stomach churned and insides rattled as her own form ascended into a sitting position. The man was coming down stairs. \"Jenny! Wake up damn it!\" Lindsey cried, tears falling freely down her cheeks. \"Lindsey,\" Abby stated again, this time more firmly. \"Wha-at?\" she sobbed without turning her body. \"He's coming.\" This had Lindsey struggle even more as she kept on screeching for Jenny to wake up. Abby on the other hand laid back down on the cot and stared up at the ceiling. If the man wanted them to escape, he would have kept the binds looser. But the fact that they cut painfully into her wrists made Abby realize that escape wasn't possible at the moment. Not only that but drugs don't wear off as quickly as assumed. Even if she was to get on her feet, there was no guarantee that her body would be supported. Her mother had worked countless years at a pharmaceutical company and Abby had learned sometimes more than she wanted to know. Like how painkillers had been stolen for 13 years straight from the store, only to be found inside her mother's blood system once an autopsy was performed. The overdose came three months before Abby had decided on leaving the country. \"Lindsey?\" Inhaling sharply, Abby listened as Jenny's confused screams began to fill the room. \"No, no, no. Fuck. What the fuck?\" \"Please, let us go!\" Meeting the man's eyes beside her, Abby attempted to give him a soothing smile. It was anything but what she felt. Still, Lindsey and Jenny were too hysterical to understand it; their screams and pleads nearly becoming deafening. And that's when Abby's ears caught in between the screams, the first slam of a foot on the step. Don't panic. Whatever you do, don't panic. Maybe he can be reasoned with. Maybe I can-. Pondering back on the evening, Abby attempted to decipher whether the man could be reasoned with at all. His actions had seemed so cold and unattached. Like he wasn't part of humanity, merely observing its' complex features. \"HELP!\" Lindsey shrieked for ten seconds straight until she became deprived of oxygen. Abby shifted herself into a half sitting position, keeping her eyes glued to the man beside her. Unfortunately, the man had heard the footsteps also. Tears began to flow in thin cascades down his cheeks. Why this guy? He's got a family he loves and a life worth living. What's he done to deserve this? No miraculous voice answered her plea. In fact all the voices that had been screaming, died suddenly in the air. Hesitantly shifting her gaze, Abby's eyes froze as she took in the man who had first allowed them into his home. He stood with a small grin on his face that made Abby want to rip it off and shove it through a paper shredder. \"Ah, and so they are awake!\" he couldn't help but exclaim. \"Let us the fuck go you fucking psycho!\" Abby remained mute as Lindsey's threat was ignored. \"First,\" he muttered, slapping his white lab coat pocket as if he'd forgotten something. \"Help! I swear to God that when I get out of here I am going to report you to the fucking authority!\" Approaching all four of the captives, he studied the pacemaker near the man who couldn't keep his heart beat still. \"Sich enstpannen,\" he muttered to the man lying helplessly in the cot. Frustrated that she didn't understand his command, Abby tried to reignite her knowledge of German words. The man beside her was going to have a heart attack if he didn't calm down. \"Who the hell are you?\" Lindsey screamed. The need to find the right words increased tenfold as what she assumed now to be a doctor, made his way over to the man in the cot. He dismissed all eye contact with Abby as he placed himself in between her and the man's cot. \"Let us the fuck go!\" From her vantage point, Abby could meet the man's eyes easily but worry entered her as the doctor pulled out a syringe from his pocket. \"I am sorry,\" the doctor spoke, \"but your blood tissue does not match.\" \"No.\" This time it was Abby that let out the plea and for a second, it seemed that the doctor had paused too, surprised to hear a different voice besides the two screaming at him. Abby felt shivers run through her as she understood why the needle was levitating over the IV. For whatever the doctor had planned for them, the man's blood tissue wasn't permittable. That meant elimination of the body. And the man in the cot knew because his eyes widened and head shook in harsh protest. \"Es tut mir leid, mein Freund,\" the doctor stated, his fingers examining just where to puncture the IV with the syringe. \"Hmphm!\" the man cried, unable to stop the downpour of tears. And although Abby didn't see it, the man's petrified fear caused his lower body to release urine all over himself. Mixed in with the vulnerability and unrestrained terror in his eyes, Abby couldn't help the sob which broke through her quivering lips. She'd understood the doctor's words perfectly, but she'd be damned if a selfish apology was the last thing the man was going to hear before the end of his life. \"Horen! Denken Sie daran Ihre Kinder. Ein Junge und Zwei Madchen. Ihre schone kinder!\" The man ceased in his struggles. His eyes connected with Abby's and the pool of tears slowly retreated into concentration. \"Denken Sie an Ihre schone Familie,\" Abby begged, relaying a last command through her green eyes which had began to water. The doctor's back stiffened, but he made no move to turn around. His hand lingered over the IV for a few seconds before he glanced down at the man's closed eyes and stabbed the syringe into the plastic tube. The man's body jerked briefly before it settled and an echoing scream resonated from Lindsey and Jenny as Abby felt two tear drops meander their way down her cheeks. The pacemaker turned into a straight green line and beeping soon indicated his passing. He did not deserve to die! Remembering some of the local dialect being thrown around at a Berlin bar she'd strolled into what seemed like a lifetime ago, Abby hopelessly whispered, \"Verdammt.\" For the next few minutes, she furiously ignored everything going on around her. The doctor turning around, Jenny and Lindsey's empty curses and threats, even the sound of her own heart beat. It felt like she'd been repeatedly punched in the face, her eyes throbbing with unshed tears. Every time she attempted to take in a large breath, a sharp pang sliced into her chest accompanied with a loss of oxygen. Abby had never seen anybody die...who didn't deserve to. And this only amplified the loss. The man hadn't deserved to die. That statement kept repeating in her mind like an answering machine, causing her to slip out of reality and take shelter in her subconscious as long as her frailed mind would allow it. It only took a snap of a finger in front of her face to bring Abby back to the cold room and shrieking friends and psychopathic doctor. Her eyes stubbornly glanced at the doctor's and nearly fled at the barely suppressed apathy there. No sympathy, no emotion. Simple indifference. And his next statement only fueled her dislike for the man deeper. \"Your blood tissue is not a match either,\" the doctor murmured. He met her eyes again as if he was expecting a raging reaction just like the man's. Abby simply leaned back in the cot and stared ahead without a trace of emotion on her face. \"You can't! You can't kill her!\" Lindsey yelled through her hoarse throat. Jenny chimed in even louder and Abby couldn't help but smile. She always did hope that somebody would be sad when she died. \"Guys,\" Abby stated, her voice oddly calm, \"it's alright. I'm alright.\" The two women paused, staring at her in silence. \"I'm alright,\" Abby repeated, casting her gaze toward them. \"Thanks for picking me up though. Not exactly what I imagined would happen, but you can't always get what you want.\" And her own statement struck her rather soberly. She'd naively assumed that getting to Germany would automatically guarantee her puzzle being pieced together. That the random flashbacks and dreams would make sense. That the father she'd last remembered as a 10 year old, would suddenly come charging into her life with a regretful story as to why he had to leave. Most of all, she had let down her guard. This was the price she paid for it. The cool pressure of the needle made her blood freeze as it traveled teasingly up her arm before transferring up the IV. Should I look him in the eye when he does it? Is that what dad did to his victims? A weak laugh shook through her as she realized just how ironic the situation truly was. But, Abby decided why not. Surely she could pick out the motive inside the doctor's brown, cold stare. So she turned her head on the pillow and met the doctor's eyes. Fear nor surprise registered as he stared at her back. Call it a battle of wills or last minute musings, but Abby found herself fascinated because fascination was exactly what greeted her back. She didn't know whether it was from any deep, inner turmoil pounding away through his blood system or the excitement of having the power to end someone's life in his hand. As her stare increased in intensity, the answer she declared was neither. He seemed so casual, even meek. As if he'd never been around so much bloodshed before. His actions were proper and precise. Definitely a near perfectionist. Still, something else fueled that fascination and she had no idea what it was. He doesn't kill for pleasure. This thought took a bit of convincing to make her believe it. He had murdered a man before her eyes without any alternative choice. Like it was the only option available. Did he have another option? He has plans for Lindsey and Jenny. If he was going to kill us all, he probably would have done it already. It must mean that he's keeping them alive and wanted them to see the man's death as well as my own. Why? In case they tried to escape? A glimpse of events to come? Abby hated to admit it but a building curiosity began to sprout inside her. Questions spanned into subcategories ranging from the simple to the meticulous. Questions that despite her soon to come death, she had a sudden desire to have answered. For so long she had been able to study and pick apart people just like her father had. Their emotional stability, pandering desires, and every flick or twitch that mapped out the contours of the face like an accurately drawn map. The doctor for whatever reason, was incredibly well at hiding what it is that he felt. Or perhaps what he was feeling was so obvious that she'd overlooked it. Why am I caring about how he's feeling? It was at this point that Abby jolted herself with a shiver and realized that he hadn't stuck the needle into her IV yet. She must have been giving him a death glare for quite a few minutes, yet his hand still lingered...uncertainly? No, that couldn't be it. Just because his motive for killing wasn't one based on tribunal passions didn't mean that keeping her alive would be a wise decision. But like sticky honey cascading from the bark of a tree, the minutes floated by and the doctor gave no sign of any imminent decision. In fact if Abby's eyes were seeing things correctly, the doctor had retracted his hand a few centimeters away from the IV. \"What are you doing?\" Abby barked, her voice almost angry. For a moment, the doctor seemed just as confused with his actions, until he slid back into a mask of indifference. But Abby knew that it was no longer indifference. Something had changed in the minutes that they had taken to stare each other down. Instead, the doctor switched his syringe from a table near him and then stereotypically flicked the needle with his fingers, causing liquid to squirt out. \"I thought my blood tissue wasn't right,\" Abby noted, suddenly on edge. \"It is not,\" he agreed without looking at her. \"Then why-.\" Abby never had a chance to finish her question as the needle divulged darkness before her eyes once again. In turn, this caused Lindsey and Jenny to renew their shrieks as the doctor carted his rolling trolley toward them next. Translations that I hijacked from YahooBabelAltavista since I don't understand a lick of German: Sind Sie gut - Are you alright? Gut - Good Wissen sie - Are you...

Let me know what you're thinking in a review :).[Chapter 3] So I got 2 absolutely fantastic reviews and um...yeah, this story is for you two who reviewed this past chapter...you know who you are. Thank you so much because it was an absolute joy reading them. Hope you stick with me as I inch along this story. Chapter 3 - Cataclysmic Centipedes For the next two days, Abby Post drifted in and out of conscious through a severely drugged state. After the first time the doctor had drugged her, she'd woken up to the pungent smell of decomposing flesh. The doctor hadn't moved the dead German man from his cot and well aware that it only took a day for a corpse to begin smelling, Abby had determined a day to have gone by at least. Those thoughts however, were only limited to a few minutes. Slowly but surely, her eyelids eased shut as if two heavy weights were lying on them. The next time she came to, the body was gone. There was no sense of knowing whether it was morning, afternoon, or night as the doctor cleverly wiped away any way of figuring the answer out. Actually, said doctor was never in sight. Severely limiting her head movements, Abby was only able to discover her own position had been changed. Where she once was in the middle of Lindsey and the German man, she now was to Jenny's right. At the very edge of the three cots. God I hope he's not searching for another victim. But Abby remembered what the doctor had said. The man's blood tissue wasn't right...then again, neither was hers and she was still alive. Again, a forceful sleep denied her the ability to cognitively sort out her situation. And so she embraced it unwillingly. Finally, Abby awoke on the fifth day of captivity with no sleepiness residing inside. Her stomach hadn't growled so she guessed he'd fed them all through a feeding tube, a very disconcerting thought considering the food could have more denotative drugs. What really had her glued to her bed in panic however was the fact that when she awoke on the fifth day, the doctor was downstairs with them. Keeping himself busy, he plugged in wires attached to a projector. A white screen in front of his audience sat in a teasing manner, almost begging them to figure out what their futures would include. \"Jenny, are you alright?\" Closing her eyes, Abby listened to her friends slowly shake off their grogginess. The last thing her head wanted was more screaming, but she had no right to tell them that. The situation they were in now was incredibly appropriate for screaming. \"Let us go, you sick fuck!\" Breathing in calmly, Abby sat herself up in the cot and watched the doctor ignore the two women as he shuffled in front of them, double checking everything. \"Are you guys alright?\" Abby questioned softly out of the corner of her lips. Her eyes were locked on the screen ahead and she swallowed past the rough pain pushing down on her throat. A few days of not communicating verbally or hardly using her throat at all had left it itchy and sensitive. Before either of them could reply, a new, high pitched voice broke the atmosphere. So new that all three women snapped their heads to the left and took in someone lying in the nearest cot to the stairs. The man was of Asian heritage with short black hair sticking up from the sweat matted in it. He was slightly on the chubby side, but from the way he thrashed in his binds, Abby determined it wasn't a simple task kidnapping him. And the worst part? He didn't speak a lick of English. For the next few minutes, the Asian man let out a steady stream of screeching insults in his native language. The only reason Abby was able to figure out he was Japanese was because he began a count down from three. Having memorized numbers one through ten in many different languages, Abby could only guess he was trying to negotiate his release. But his threat was empty and the doctor paid no mind which only frustrated the man more. \"Aahhh!\" he finally let out as agonizing drips of precipitation rolled down his back. Jenny and Lindsey only shared terrified looks with each other, unsure whether anything they could say at this point would make a difference. Meanwhile, Abby was slowly boiling. Not in the physical sense, but eternally, her body refused to cool down to a normal temperature. The unfair nature in which they'd all been tricked by someone who knew nothing about them, frustrated her to no end. How dare he take people out of their lives and use them for his own sick pleasures? They have done nothing wrong. It was with this thought that the German man swung back into her mind. His senseless death and how his children would forever be without a father. And boy did Abby know that pain personally. So as Lindsey became livelier with her shrieks and the Japanese man as well as Jenny joined her, Abby studied her binds with deep concentration. There was always a flawed mistake that murderers took in caging their victims. The doctor's way was to keep them drugged, but surely he wasn't impeccable in every sense. In his excitement, he must have forgotten to do something that would ensure their containment. \"Hello, my name is Dr. Josef Heiter.\" Abby's blood ran cold as her eyes glanced up and witnessed the doctor throw a sarcastic wink at his audience. \"We don't care who the fuck you are! Let us go!\" Heiter simply smiled, overlooking the outburst. \"I am a world renounced surgeon who specializes in the separation of Siamese twins.\" With that he pressed down on the remote in his hand and all four individuals watched as the projector identified what appeared to be some of his successful procedures. For those with weak stomachs like Jenny, the image was truly revolting. It had come directly post surgery with no time for the twins to have been cleaned up. But Abby believed that the doctor wanted the picture this way. It showed him the miracle of what he had done. Tune him out and look for a way to escape. Against her better judgment, Abby pushed out his authoritative voice and instead focused back on her binds. However, it was a difficult conversation to keep her ears out of. \"-my 3 rottweilers-\" He bound us as if he was afraid we'd run away in our sleep. Tugging uselessly on her restraint, Abby narrowed her eyes. There was no way she was giving up, especially since her dad was a-. \"-shortly died after surgery-.\" Lindsey's scream caught Abby off-guard but she dutifully went back to twisting her wrists within her binds. Perhaps somehow if she could slip her hand out or maybe find something sharp. \"-beautiful pet. Why not humans then?\" Another scream ripped through her friends' throats, only this one was shaky and immersed within fear. Like he's going to have a sharp utensil casually lying around here somewhere. C'mon. Something sharp, something sharp. Staring puzzlingly at her bound wrist, Abby felt like smacking herself in the face. Of course! He may have tied us with material preventing us from slipping our arms out, but that rarely means the material is tough enough to withstand punctures. Or tears. \"The Human Centipede.\" Glancing up, Abby nearly recoiled at the image on the screen. And then her heart sank as she peered out of the corner of her eyes at Lindsey, Jenny, and the Japanese man. Tears poured down their cheeks in uncertain buckets as hoarse pleads whisked through their frightened mouths. Surgeon. Siamse twins. Human centipede? He's going to-. A grotesque frown spilled over her features as Abby began to grasp on to just the reason why they'd been captured. Glancing up at the screen again, Abby studied the picture and the points on the body in which he would operate on. They all have to have the same blood tissue...the Japanese man must since he's still alive. Blinking once as if she couldn't quite believe what she was seeing, Abby took away her glance and met Heiter's stare. It was directed only at her and his expression was set as if he could read her mind. He has no idea what to do with me either. \"Let them go,\" Abby heard herself finally protest. \"If you let them go, I'll let you perform any type of surgery you want on me. You could attach my fingers to my forehead. Split my legs into angles. Cut open my diaphragm and stick something in there, I really don't care. Just...they don't deserve this.\" She didn't know why her words seemed to amuse him because as soon as she'd spoken, he lifted the corner of his lips. \"And you deserve this?\" he replied. Abby fell silent, aware of the eyes on her from the side. They still had hope that she could somehow remedy the situation. That the disgusting, pervasive, and unethical treatment they were to undergo could be prevented. \"More than they do,\" Abby answered quietly, but enough so he could hear her. This blasted a thoughtful look on Heiter's face for a moment. \"No.\" His answer vibrated in finality over the confines of the room and three panicked groans expressed their hopeless dislike beside her. Abby stared furiously back at the doctor, her teeth shutting firm on her tongue. She had to play this situation out wisely, if only to save them. \"Then what are you going to do with me? If you try to attach me to this...experiment, I'll die.\" \"You will not be a part of the experiment,\" he answered. Taking in a deep breath, Abby bit down on her lip. \"Why are you doing this?\" It came out as a plead and was nearly unrecognizable to Abby's own ears. In fact, her voice came out like she was 8 years old again, standing in her basement, overlooking the dead body lying on an old gurney. \"I would have expected a more creative question from you,\" Heiter remarked. Biting back a harsh reply, Abby felt her teeth grind at his answer. The same teeth she'd been planning to use in order to escape her binds. \"I expected a world renounced surgeon. You can't even keep three rottweilers alive,\" Abby spat back. And the cold frown that emerged made Abby want to raise her hands in a silent victory. \"Do not worry, I'll try my best on your friends,\" Heiter vowed. Lindsey unsuccessfully fought back a choke at his words. \"You won't touch them,\" Abby promised. \"We'll see in a few days,\" the doctor replied, approaching them. The same syringe he'd been using for the past few days on them was revealed from a white coat pocket. Renewing his screams, the Japanese man was the first receipient of the needle. I won't be able to live with myself if this happens to them. And when Heiter turned his way toward Jenny, Abby lowered her head down to her binds and began biting, a muddled plan forming in her panicked mind. Hmm...so in your mind, does Heiter's personality seem like how he'd actually act? In my mind, I say yes but I always like to push through something different just to make the character more interesting. Let me know what you're thinking in a review.[Chapter 4] I would just like to give a very special shout out to the-dark-poetess-911 whom gives some of the best reviews ever! You honestly make me keep on writing, along with Angel 1932. I hope you guys like this chapter and to answer your question darkpoetess, he is...NOT the father as Maury would so dramatically say. They have absolutely no relation, but Abby has one hell of a history behind her and we may or may not figure it out. So...enjoy! Chapter 4 - Diabolical Duties As Abby chewed viciously at her binds, attempting to undo one arm, a plan began to sprout. It wasn't genius by any means, but it would at least give Lindsey, Jenny, and the Japanese man a chance to escape. Or so she hoped. What it involved was using a bit of self defense skills she'd learned along with attempting to remember just exactly which drug did what. Because her mother worked in a pharmaceutical company, Abby was able to faintly recall a lot of the drugs she'd seen or learned about. One in particular she'd remembered had become rather popular at one time was called Modafinil and it was prescribed to those who had trouble waking up or staying vigilant. The drug went through numerous restrictions by the FDA because of its' constant abuse, but it worked just as well as speed and just as quickly. There was no way Abby could accurately predict whether it would actually wake up her sedated friends. She didn't know what the doctor had used to make them pass out in the first place. It could have been liquified choloroform or Rohipnol once again or even something as simple as crushing Xanex into powdered pieces and then entering it into the syringe. So many different choices had made Abby hesitant about the side effects of feeding her friends the drug. Hell, the doctor might not even have the drug. But then again, Heiter seemed like the type of man to have the drugs on hand just from what she'd seen of his storage and his status. There were entire cupboards dedicated to countless liquified and sold medical drugs. She had to at least try in that sense. With this plan settling itself hopefully in her head, Abby was able to hold on to the strap surrounding her wrist with the tips of her teeth and slide it toward her. This loosened the constriction and she was able to slip her left hand out. Hurriedly, Abby threw her eyes toward Heiter and stilled as he stepped in between Lindsey and herself. His mind was preoccupied on his task and for this, Abby was eternally thankful. She had a horrible inkling that this might be the last time she'd see her friends' separated. As soon as Heiter's form leaned over Lindsey, Abby turned to the opposite hand. Breathing in calmly so as not to indicate her dangerous actions, she bit on to the wrap and tugged. C'mon you bastard. And just like that, her arm was tugged out of the binds. Two seconds later and she'd managed to unwrap the tape keeping her IV in. Hearing Lindsey's scream, Abby stilled herself as Heiter injected the sedative. In between soft pants, Abby began pushing herself up on to her elbows. The sweat cascading down her back only indicated how weak she really was from the drugs. Just as she was about to sit up, her muscles crumbled and she fell back into the bed. Meanwhile, Lindsey's protests grew softer and softer. C'mon, one more time. Please, don't fail me now. Abby gritted her teeth and pushed with a mix of core and elbow until she was in a firm sitting position. With nimble fingers, she swiftly released the binds on both of her legs. Heiter's form straightened and Abby felt the beat of her heart racing a million miles per hour. However, she managed to spin her form so her legs were hanging off the cot only inches from the doctor. It dawned on her right then and there that this would probably be the only chance she'd ever have to escape. And that thought shot such a frigid blast of fear to her heart she nearly choked. So with this newfound survival instinct laying residence in her body, Abby prepared herself. And for a horrifying moment Abby thought Heiter knew she'd escaped from her binds. Why else would he take so long to turn around? But when he did, the surprise on his face was something Abby would have liked to take a picture of. Mouth open, eyes wide, jaw slack. And while he took her unbound form in, Abby swung her fist forward and connected with his lower jaw. The strength even took her by surprise as Heiter's form flew back into the trolley. At this, Abby took the final jump and landed shakily on her legs. She flung herself out of Heiter's grasp as he came back at her and with reflexes like a fox, kicked him as harshly as she could in the stomach. Down he went and she wasted no time falling on top of him. A choked gasp flew from his lips as her form landed on his stomach. Her hands immediately went to his throat. Heiter thrashed underneath her, eyes bugging as she increased pressure on to his throat. As much as he did try to throw her off, Abby felt her body's sluggishness and found it aiding her as it held the man down like an anchor. It was when Abby had managed to hold on for eight seconds straight that Heiter's clawing at her arms began to lighten up. Three more seconds, with the pressure on his throat increased each second, Heiter finally managed to blink lazily before five more seconds had his head fall back with a thud on to the cold floor. Abby's body was shaking as her hands refused to unclench from their position around his throat. Anytime she believed he'd come back up at her. But a few seconds passed by and the man still laid unconscious. The others. Pushing herself hesitantly off the floor Abby made sure not to stare at the doctor for too long. Even his unconscious form seemed threatening. Instead, she dragged her body toward Lindsey's bed and placed a shaky, sweaty palm on her cheek. For a second, Abby's brain refused to work. All she could do was stare helplessly down at her friend. Every detail of her plan threatened to disappear within the recess of her mind. Snap out of it. Snap out of it! Shaking her head, Abby's eyes trailed down the length of Lindsey's arm. All the while, her brain tried to insert the same surviving instinct that had caused her to choke their attacker into unconsciousness. The Modafinil! Twirling around, she studied the rows of medication the doctor had displayed on the opposite side of the room and nearly gave up at the thought of looking through each case. Mom said that a good doctor has them alphabetized. Ignoring the bile rising through her Abby shuffled to the medicine cabinets. Her eyes scanned over medications until to her great relief, they began in alphabetical order. Her fingers slipped swiftly over the packages and boxes until the M's caught her focus. She inhaled deeply and read off in her mind the different medicines. Some were distinctly German while others were internationally well known. And when her fingers found the Modafinil, Abby nearly teared up. But, she remembered that time was of the essence and the doctor might wake up at any time. Grabbing the box, she tore it open and smiled at the yellow, oval pills. Keeping her hands steady Abby took one out, found a surgical steel knife and placed it firmly atop the pill. Slamming it five times over the pill finally caused its' recession into powder. Scanning the perimeter, she searched above her and threw open two doors to a glass cabinet. Inside were packaged syringes. As she worked on liquefying the drug she attempted not to think too much about the man behind on the floor. He could be waking up right about now. Biting harshly down on her lip Abby willed these thoughts to leave her. If they stayed, there was no way they could leave this place alive. In minutes, the Modafinil was liquefied and Abby shuffled back to Lindsey's bed. Holding the IV as carefully as she could, a silent prayer entered her head. Before she could hesitate she stuck the needle in and ran back to the other side of the room. For ten minutes straight, Abby followed a strict pattern of crushing the Modafinil, forcing the pieces into the syringe, adding the briefest amount of water in before sliding the needle part into place. It was when Abby shuffled over to inject the Japanese man did Lindsey begin to stir. \"Uhhhh.\" Pushing the remainder of the drug into the IV, Abby drifted her gaze to Lindsey's slightly active body. Oh yes...thank you for working! Rushing back to the medicine counter, Abby threw the syringe down and gathered a cloth. She wetted it under the cool water coming from the sink and was just about to rush to her friend's side when something caught her eye. You never know...this might not work out. Where would I be after that? Abby attempted to ignore this thought but before she knew it, her fingers grabbed the bottle and slipped it into the hip band of her underwear. APHAPHAPHAPH \"Abby?\" Lindsey gingerly whispered. \"Shh,\" she cooed, running the cold cloth over her forehead. \"I can't-.\" \"I know it's going to be tough, but you have to try. If you don't try, you will face a fate worse than death,\" Abby stated. Lindsey recalled the doctor's mad use for them and nodded her head aggressively. Squeezing her hand assuredly Abby ran to Jenny's cot and gracefully slid out the IV. Slicing through the binds, Abby positioned Jenny as carefully as she could so that she'd be able to steady herself on both elbows. She then repeated the same patting motions over her forehead until her eyes began to open. Rushing over one last time, Abby gently applied the cloth to the Japanese man's face, praying he'd feel the change in body temperature. If he didn't... I am not leaving him to that kind of fate. In the meantime, her eyes kept trailing over to the doctor's form on the ground. I should just kill him. But this thought was firmly denied for a reason far too engraved within her to comprehend. She would not be a killer like her-. \"Argh!\" Jumping, Abby spun around and watched the Japanese man's eyes open in confusion. Just as he was about to begin another screech Abby threw her palm over his mouth and put a finger up to her lips. Gesturing her head behind she allowed him to see the doctor's form on the ground. Once more she put her finger to her lips and nodded. The man nodded back and allowed her to help him push up into a sitting position. \"We have to get out of here,\" Lindsey whispered as she slipped Jenny's stumbling form off the cot. Abby was about to agree when a fearful thought struck her. Facing Lindsey, Abby remarked, \"He has the keys to the front door and probably his car.\" \"Shit,\" Lindsey sputtered, glancing at Heiter's form. They then met each other's eyes and Abby nodded her head in affirmation. \"Alright, I'll do it. You get upstairs and help this guy too. Wait for me at the front door.\" Lindsey's answer was a nod as she momentarily let go of Jenny's balancing form and instead, walked over and took one of the Japanese man's arms, letting it fall over her shoulder. Jenny watched in confusion but ventured a few steps forward on steady feet. \"Grab his other arm and get upstairs,\" Abby softly commanded. \"What are you going to do?\" she slurred out. \"I'm getting the keys.\" APHAPHAPHAPH Please don't wake up. That was the only thought soaring through Abby's mind as her hands traveled into Heiter's white lab coat. No keys were in either pocket, but she checked his pants only to discover one set of keys she determined to belong to his car. Upon further inspection however, those were the only keys she found on him. Damn it, he doesn't have the house keys. Blowing a dejected sigh, Abby stood up and backed away. But as she did so, her leg accidentally brushed against his and to her horror, his leg reacted to the touch. He's waking up. Smothering the keys into her palm Abby wasted no time as her legs carried her out of the hospital room and up the stairs, hoping it'd be the last time she'd ever see the place. APHAPHAPHAPH \"Lindsey? Jenny?\" Abby questioned into the open hallway. The front hallway was vacant however. \"Abby!\" Jumping up in her place Abby placed a hand to her heart as Jenny's form peeked out of one room. \"We've almost broken through the glass with a pan we found in the kitchen,\" she answered, moving into the room. The sound of metal smashing into glass increased the closer Abby got to the room. But then she remembered what happened down stairs. So before Jenny could enter the room, Abby pulled at her arm and faced her. \"Don't panic, but Heiter is waking up.\" Jenny's eyes widened and her body tried to pull free of Abby's grip. \"NO,\" Abby commanded, \"please, you have to listen to what I say if you want to survive. He's going to come up here, but you will have the keys.\" With this, Abby pried one of Jenny's hands open and placed the keys within her palm. \"What about you?\" she whispered out. \"I'm going to distract him. I'll go one way and that should buy you guys enough time to-.\" \"You're not going to make it,\" she noted solemnly. Abby nodded her head. The need to cry was there, but no tears formed. \"No, I'm not. But that's alright because I've got my own little plan B for that. But as soon as you get inside that car, I want you to get the hell out. Don't wait for me, don't try to come back, don't even think about doing something noble. This is where your flight instinct is at its' greatest so please, take advantage of it.\" Jenny nodded her head as tears slid down her cheeks. \"Now go,\" Abby demanded. Sniffing, Jenny studied Abby one last time. \"I-thank you so much,\" she sobbed. And with one last squeeze of Abby's hands, Jenny turned around and sprinted into the room behind her. When the final sound of glass smashing reached Abby's ears in the hallway, she knew it was time. APHAPHAPHAPH Abby watched Heiter's form stumble up the stairs. Only three minutes ago the trio had smashed through the glass door and were hopefully in the car by now. The doctor's eyes searched that way, but before he could take a step in that direction, Abby kicked a glass cup at her feet. The clamor alerted the doctor to her presence and with a look of false surprise, Abby took off in the opposite direction of her friends with the doctor following soon after. APHAPHAPHAPH \"Let me in!\" he yelled, one fist slamming against the door. Abby slithered further into the room. There were no windows inside of it and the walls were thin enough for her to have heard the start of the engine. But just barely because Heiter's bangs against the door nearly blocked them out. At least they'll be safe. Another slam against the door caused a crack to trail down and it was at this moment that Abby reached under her gown and pulled out the bottle she'd stashed there. Observing the liquid, she sighed. Three months ago and she would never have imagined what she'd be doing right now. Still, life has that strange way of creeping up on you and sometimes actions are taken out of your hands. A piece of wood splintered off the door and scurried across the floor. It landed near her feet. All the things she'd wanted to do, not just in Germany but in life, came crashing down as she uncapped the bottle. I'll never be able to find out what happened to dad. Or get married. Or have my own little cottage in Europe. Screw that. If I get the chance, I'm never coming back to this country again. But it wasn't the country's fault. Simply one man possessed by the idea. Toasting to the dimly lit room, Abby lifted the bottle to her lips and smelled. That's ghastly. Closing her eyes Abby tilted her head back and swallowed the bottle of opium. The bottle she'd taken would be just strong enough, just enough in quantity to kill her. And that, she reasoned, was a better fate than anything this madman had to offer. 30 seconds later, Heiter finally broke down the door and found Abby slowly retreating into her own piece of mind with the empty bottle resting nonchalantly in her hand. He cursed violently in German and somewhere further away, Abby heard the words and smiled in victory. I was tempted just to end it there...and maybe some of you want me to, but I do have more up my sleeve. Let me know what you're thinking in a review :).[Chapter 5] Thank you as always for the reviews. I honestly think that they are some of the best I've ever gotten as a writer, period. Thank you, thank you, thank you. And now I have decided to keep on moving and I hope the rest makes sense. Things in italics are flashbacks and Abby won't quite be herself for a few chapters what with working the opium out of her system which causes an extraordinary high as drugs do, but also an incredible period of dependency on the drug. I'm sure I don't quite have all the side effects of the drug down, but these I'm simply playing around with two effects I know are there. Which means more fun for me...anywho, enjoy! Chapter 5 - Endless Entertainment \"Where's dad?\" Abby's only reply was a disapproving glance from her mother. Five minutes passed by agonizingly slow and Abby stopped picking at her food. \"Where's Berlin?\" Her mother remained tight lipped, but a slow breath flew through her lips. \"Abby, eat the rest of your chicken.\" Abby nodded her head, but she felt no appetite. It'd been three months since her dad left and only frustration built in when her mom refused to say anything about his whereabouts. Although 10 years old, she still deserved a right to know why dad wasn't coming back. \"Is he coming back?\" \"That is enough Abby!\" her mother screamed, slapping her palm on the table. Stilling, Abby flushed red as her mom stood up and left the kitchen. APHAPHAPHAPH A bright flash slipped underneath her eyelids as a small moan flew out her lips. There was no sense of feeling in her entire body, but Abby was aware of movement around her. \"Dummes madchen, dumm.\" \"Dad?\" Abby questioned aloud, the plea breaking through her numb lips. The movement around her stopped. Suddenly, Abby felt a cool touch run across her neck. It sauntered up until her forehead met the same touch. A satisfied smile reached Abby's lips as the light beneath her lids slipped further away. APHAPHAPHAPH \"How's Labyrintha today?\" \"I don't like that nickname.\" Her dad laughed, throwing a hand over one sagging shoulder. \"Cheer up Labyrintha. Do you want to see something neat?\" Abby shook her head lethargically. Her solemn green gaze traveled over their sparse back yard. The few beautiful elegant trees danced in the autumn wind as the grass tickled her swinging feet over the deck. \"Mom says you shouldn't be showing me that kind of stuff,\" Abby answered in a low voice. \"Ahh,\" her dad observed, studying the scenery as well. \"Guess she has a point. But you gotta admit, it's pretty cool, huh?\" Abby shrugged her shoulders indifferently. \"I don't know. I don't like the way they look at me,\" she admitted. \"Then,\" her father answered, mouth lingering near her ear, \"I promise to make sure their eyes are closed next time you see them.\" Smiling, Abby allowed her father's hand to lead away from the house and toward the warehouse. APHAPHAPHAPH This time Abby awoke with a shock and nearly passed out again from the pain. Cramps shook her stomach as her eyes attempted to shake off the white appearing before her. Something tried to fly past her throat, but it was shut out with a raw pang. Her breathing increased severely as a shaking enveloped from head to toe. \"Calm yourself,\" a voice commanded. Abby's vision still prevented total sight, and the voice only made it that much more difficult not to scream. Hands pressed softly down on her shoulders and the voice gave the same command, only calmer this time. Just the change in voice caused Abby to slow her breaths to a delicate whimper. \"Ca-ca-,\" she tried to explain, but her throat closed up. \"Relax.\" Abby's mind couldn't pin point just exactly who this voice belonged to, but she listened wisely. In between the internal, hellish cramps striking her stomach and the feverish flash running over her body, Abby wanted to submit back into slumber. Somehow, memories were pouring out that she hadn't remembered having. The small spat with her mom was something she was aware had happened, but she'd nearly forgotten all about her dad's nickname for her. The deeper in slumber she resided, the more came back to her. And so she forced herself to detach her body away from the pain with a cetain excitement and soon after, a dizzy spell encumbered her. APHAPHAPHAPH \"Don't worry, he isn't looking, Labyrintha.\" Abby hesitated, but a timid hand hovered over the form. \"He's going to be alright, isn't he?\" she softly asked. \"Of course,\" her dad smoothly replied from behind, \"just taking a small nap.\" \"Okay.\" Her small hand lowered until it met the cold skin of the man lying on the gurney. \"What does it feel like, Labyrintha?\" Grazing the skin, her nails trailed over the skin carefully. \"It feels cold.\" \"What else?\" Crinkling her nose, Abby allowed her palm to replace the trailing. \"There is some warm at first touch. But the cold is too much. The skin is very smooth.\" \"Good,\" her dad mumbled, stepping beside her. \"And if the skin was recently warm, what does that mean?\" The words wanted to spring through her throat, but Abby kept silent. \"Don't be shy, Labyrintha. You know he's only pretending so I can help teach you some stuff.\" \"I know,\" she whispered, \"but his body is colder than anyone else's I've ever felt.\" \"I'm sorry for that. But you are going to have to learn some things when I'm go-.\" Abby's head snapped around, her green eyes widening into two child-like ovals. \"You're leaving?\" Her dad smiled, shaking his head. \"Never, Labyirntha. When I go on vacation, I want to make sure you remember everything I taught you.\" \"Can't I go on vacation with you?\" \"Not this time. But I promise when I come back, I'll hug you till you're blue.\" Accepting this answer, Abby's glance found the body again with a sigh. \"He was recently breathing, but his pulse stopped. That means he has no blood that can flow through him because his brain also stopped. But dad,\" Abby began, turning toward him, \"you'll revive him like you do all the other patients, right?\" \"Absolutely, Labyrintha. Now, let's get you something to eat.\" Abby happily nodded, grabbing his hand. APHAPHAPHAPH When Abby was first able to open her eyes, one thought reached her. White is such a boring wall color. The fact that she was alive reached her three minutes later, but was greatly overshadowed by the fact she couldn't move. There were no restraints on her, but from head to toe it felt like she weighed two tons heavier than her actual body weight. Her surroundings sauntered back into her mind a few minutes after and one good thing did come of the observation. At least I'm not in the basement. But this thought reminded her why she was there in the first place. So with words jumbled in mind, Abby prepared herself to scream. But, she had no idea who or what to scream out. Instead, she closed her eyes and attempted to make sense of all the flashbacks suddenly easing back into the forefront of her subconscious. APHAPHAPHAPH \"How did you get the opium out?\" The question lingered eerily between the two and was the first spoken words ever since Heiter had entered the room a day later. Abby had been casually battling with herself on her mindless actions as a child when the doctor had walked in. In his hand he had another needle and she had briefly hoped it would be to help put some movement back into her muscles. She couldn't move a limb if she tried. But he wasn't prepared to see her awake and simply stood across the room, frowning. And although Abby had a million questions flying through her arsenal that needed to be answered, only one slipped out. \"Oh my gosh,\" Abby reprimanded after his silence, \"I'm such an idiot. Hello, you're a surgeon.\" Her words left her with a laugh and a giddy feeling began rising inside. \"Your system will have to work out the opium,\" he noted, observing the same effects currently overthrowing Abby's mind. The smile Abby sported only grew as her mind began to fog. Somewhere deep inside of her she understood just exactly what was happening. He hadn't pumped the opium out because she hadn't drank enough to kill herself. Measuring fluid ounces was always her weakness. But this meant that the opium was still coursing through her body and that explained the muscle spasms as well as the high she was currently experiencing. Her body was high on the large amount of opium she'd taken in and in fear of a shut down, her brain paralyzed the muscles. This in turn only left her able to function mentally which was just as wired as the rest of her. These understandings were quickly replaced with a drunken suptor. \"Keep the opium coming,\" Abby demanded lightly. Heiter began to approach, but Abby's eyes slowly shut and her body soon followed. APHAPHAPHAPH \"This will help easily stimulate the muscle's functions.\" Abby's eyes lazily followed Heiter's movements as he plunged the needle deep into her vein. A giggle spilled out. A confused scrunch of the eyebrows met her eyes. \"What can I say,\" she slurred, \"I'm a masochist.\" Heiter said nothing and instead, stood up. \"I will give you your lunch in an hour.\" Abby watched him leave with another laugh. It was like a never ending gas had spilled into her mind, not allowing her to see logic. \"See ya later, Schwarzenegger.\" APHAPHAPHAPH Abby woke up later in the evening or what she guessed to be the evening, feeling absolutely horrible. For the past two weeks, and she'd only known it'd been two weeks because of Heiter's wardrobe having changed each day, the opium had been assaulting her system. Initially it had been gentle in perfecting a high Abby hadn't ever experienced, as she knew it would. Each day, Heiter would inject her with a muscle stimulant, but it was far from a true stimulant. On good days, she could perhaps lift her arms. Otherwise, a wiggle of a limb was her best means of communicating. Not that she wanted to communicate with him, or so she told herself in her dreams that had been oddly disposed of the childhood flashbacks she'd been accustomed to having. But each time she awoke, the opium had time to mess with her mind and she became a woman possessed. The doctor never even stayed in the room long, but each time was a struggle for her to bite back words. For example, some time last week Heiter had came in with dinner for her. She was allowed breakfast of toast and eggs, lunch of a grilled cheese and apple, and dinner of steak he cooked her with potatoes. It was incredibly lucky that she loved all of those foods. Once he had placed the food down next to him, he began his usual routine of slipping gloves on. Abby wasn't sure whether it was for her benefit or his. However, this appreciation was overshadowed by her next thought which was unfortunately, spoken out loud. \"You know that my dad,\" Abby began assuredly, \"will kill you if he finds out I've been kidnapped.\" Heiter had been cutting the steak into pieces when her words reached him. \"Of course he will,\" he muttered slowly. Abby had really struggled to bite back her next words, but something lifted off her chest and the words simply flew out. Plus, the superiority in his tone bothered her too. \"My dad was a serial killer.\" And although her mind panicked slightly at divulging the information, a grin set itself on to her lips. Heiter had actually paused in his slicing to take a long look at her. Abby had merely stared back with her grin becoming wider and wider until there was no way he couldn't have believed her statement. Whether he actually did believe her or not, he never indicated. Instead, he repeated his earlier words. \"Of course he is.\" And Abby had struggled to keep in her words rather avidly from then on. There were some things in her mind that she wanted to keep secret until she reached her grave. What she really wanted to ask was why he decided on keeping her in a room instead of the basement. She wanted to know why he appeared indifferent toward the fact that three escapees would tell the authorities of his whereabouts. And the biggest thing she wanted to know was why he was making the effort of keeping her alive. But of course she never commented on any of the logical issues flying around in her subconscious. Quite simply, if something was on her mind, she'd let it out no matter how silly it was. And save for a few embarrassing personal details having to do with a few former boyfriends of hers, Abby had otherwise kept up a wall between the important and unimportant stuff running around in her mind. Still, when she woke up that evening, Abby would have divulged any sort of information to make the pain stop that was cramping up in her body. The cramps had been irregular and few over the two weeks, but their brutal arrival indicated the disappearance of the high which had so happily kept her amused for the past two weeks. Now, the painful part was beginning. Fighting back her need to vomit Abby struggled to roll herself on to her side. And she succeeded. However, her reward was the release of her dinner over the edge of the bed and a returning need to allow sleep back into her body. And so she did. APHAPHAPHAPH Abby knew she wasn't supposed to watch her parents fighting. Nor hear it. Her parents had told her that if she ever heard them beginning to fight, she was to leave the room or surrounding area immediately and go far enough to where she couldn't hear them. But her dad had been acting strange lately and she'd been having more lessons with him in the warehouse than usual. Sometimes she'd catch a regretful twinkle in his eye that had caused her heart to numb. She never wanted him to leave. And so when the fighting began, instead of leaving the area, she had crept near a vent connected to her parents' bedroom. Their shouts were loud and clear. \"If the police ever find out-.\" \"They won't,\" her dad insisted. \"You are so sure of yourself that you are willing to put your daughter and I through hell.\" \"Labyrintha is smart enough to-.\" \"And for God's sake, stop calling her that!\" A pause greeted Abby's ears as she scooted closer. \"I'll be gone to Berlin for a month, tops. You have nothing to worry about, I promise.\" \"Except the bodi-.\" \"Alice, you have nothing to worry about, alright?\" Her mother must have relented because their voices died down soon after. APHAPHAPHAPH This flashback turned dream had been quite common in Abby's subconscious, but as it gradually disappeared, an unfamiliar one replaced it. APHAPHAPHAPH Abby had been allowed to finally invite the neighborhood kids over to play and they were currently running through the house, trying to find a spot to hide. She absolutely loved hide and seek, but her parents had to remind her constantly to keep the game inside the house. If anyone was to go outside, they'd be sent home. It was obvious to her that her parents didn't want the other kids to participate in the lessons she was having at the warehouse, so Abby had been firm in her demands. However, as she was flying through the air, she'd tripped and slammed her hip into a nearby coffee table. The phone that had been hanging off it, fell to the ground with a thud and met Abby's vantage point as she struggled to keep from crying. Her hip pounded intensely and the need to lie there indefinitely was incredibly tempting. The phone's hanger was near her feet and the corded receiver nakedly rested beside her ear. It was her father's voice coming through the other end which caused her to bite back her tears and move her ear to the phone. \"-sure you're coming?\" \"Yes. Alice packed my bags and I've already said goodbye to my girl. Where is Steffan meeting me?\" \"At your hotel once you land. Just remember that he's going to have a lot of questions. He's a good guy from what I've heard, but you know what they say.\" \"Never trust a German?\" \"Exactly. Especially in a country where communism just fell.\" \"He won't have me stay for more than a month, right?\" \"You never know with these things. The guy is smart and he's not going to let you off the hook when he's got dirt on you.\" \"Fucking Germans.\" \"I'll drink to that.\" \"Keep me posted and I'll see you once you get to the airport.\" \"Got it. See ya there.\" The phone soon began a drawn out beep and shaking herself off, Abby stood with the phone and hanger. Placing one atop the other, she quickly pondered on the information. But the sound of Billy's triumphant yell of 100 caused her to file the information back within her mind. She'd have time to pick at it later. And so she began her run, unaware that the information would come back to her not a few days later, but years in a far more serious situation than hide and seek. So I'm hoping you're all alright with the whole flashbacks during sleep scenario. I know that one of any drug's side effects, especially the heavy ones like opium, is regaining memory or flashbacks, usually during the proceedings. I feel like I may have rushed the chapter a bit, but I'm just trying not to reveal too much about either character and settling the situation down. Let me know what you're thinking in a review ;).[Chapter 6] Thank you for the review, Angel1932. I'm taking this part slowly only because the recovery isn't going to go away just like that. But, I want to make it interesting of course. So I hope you and whoever is reading this chapter (guiltily I assume since I've only got 2 story alerts), enjoys this next chapter that I very much enjoyed writing. Chapter 6 - Feeling Fire \"How is the cramping today?\" Abby studiously ignored the question. One part of her was genuinely surprised he'd asked while the other just wanted to tell him to fuck off. Then again, he fed her and tried to neutralize the pain as best as he could. Don't think about it that way. I should not be thankful because he feeds me and takes care of me like a pet. That's how the brain begins to crumble. When we allow ourselves to be thankful that our captor is keeping us alive. Still, Abby felt like she owed him some words. He could have killed her a thousand times already for causing his patients to escape. \"If I answer your question,\" Abby began, wincing as another teeth chattering cramp ignited within her, \"then you have to answer one of mine.\" Silence met her ears and Abby was tempted to turn over just to see his expression. But all of the moving about would only intensify the pain stirring inside her and although her muscles had become looser over the past two days, she still couldn't manage a rollover without choking at the pain. After a few lingering minutes, Abby listened to Heiter's feet shuffle to the door. Once it was shut, she cursed at the room. Her curse was directed toward her situation and the pain tearing up inside her. It was excruciating. Each breath felt like a slice into her kidneys. Perhaps I should have reconsidered plan B. But there truly was no alternative. If she hadn't distracted Heiter he would have gone after her friends. And the rage he was in once she'd managed to lock herself in one of the many rooms would have sentenced her to death most certainly. Why else would he keep her alive when his patients were gone? Yet, he'd done it again. Carrying her to a room, bringing her food, putting up with the stages of the offensive drug. Worse yet was that she felt indebted to him for it. Like she owed him a thanks. It was ridiculous of course, but she was ridiculous enough to love her father despite everything he'd done. And she'd only discovered that the lessons shared between the two in her muddled childhood weren't really the type typical of a father-daughter relationship. Why did he do it? Now, it was time to decipher her own father. For some time Abby had thought she had him figured out. He shared the same murderous gene as John Wayne Gacy Jr or Ted Bundy. His charm allowed him to be anyone he wanted. But beneath his charm, he hid a secret. And he had a wife who loved him enough not to say a word, coping in her own self destructive way - prescription drugs. I was only 10. Again, Abby believed her father had known the fragile and naive child psyche. If he put on his charm and managed to make her believe that his victims were nothing more than props in the lessons he shared with her, then Abby would wholeheartedly believe it. At such a young age, she couldn't comprehend that the man who swung her up in the air, tucked her into bed, went to the movies with, was actually a serial killer. To believe that would shatter her. That was something her mother understood more than perhaps her father. So the lessons were far and few in between, but toward his vacation, they'd increased for a short time. He must have known somewhere inside that he might not return. This time she pondered back on the last flashback witnessed. The game of hide and seek she'd so casually brushed off and the information learned, sunk into her mind like quicksand. And out of all the times to have remembered this information, it just had to be under the supervision of a mad surgeon whose own intentions were unclear. I sure know how to attract them. APHAPHAPHAPH \"You rolled over.\" Abby glared at Heiter for a second before grabbing the apple. \"If you put a leash on me and start petting my head, I might do more,\" she bitterly replied. A part of her winced at the hate in her voice. Rolling herself over had been more painful than she'd realized it would be. The pain in turn, fled through her voice. \"I simply meant it must have taken a great deal of strength,\" he noted. Pausing in her bite Abby met Heiter's stare and shrugged. \"It'd be nice to have the sun shine in here,\" Abby casually let out after a few minutes of munching. \"No windows,\" he stated firmly. \"Big house,\" she indicated. \"No.\" \"Bastard.\" They both paused at the last word and Abby blushed. \"I meant to keep that in my head,\" she explained. Heiter said nothing more until she'd successfully eaten the grilled cheese sandwich. Just as he was ready to leave her for another five hours he stopped in his tracks. \"Are you aware of the stages in recovering from drugs?\" Abby nodded. \"Then you are aware of what comes after the pain, yes?\" \"Of course,\" she answered matter of factly. \"But what does withdrawal have to do with anything?\" Heiter's gaze trailed to the opposite wall. \"Complete solitude will be needed when the dependence hits you.\" Abby's eyes widened as she followed Heiter's gaze. \"Oh.\" \"No windows,\" he responded, leaving the room quietly. \"No windows,\" Abby repeated, lost in thought. APHAPHAPHAPH A week passed by before Abby began to feel the first signs of dependence. It came in subtle at first, telling her how much better opium would be instead of the food Heiter was feeding her. She brushed this off, understanding the mindless plead as nothing but the drugs talking. However, all that was needed to let the drugs begin screaming rather than talking was anger. Abby had thought she'd done a fair job of containing said anger. In small ways, life was beginning to get better. Her legs were becoming more mobile each day, although she never let Heiter know this. All of the questions she wished to vocalize began to emerge in their own silent ways to her. The flashbacks were still minimal, but it allowed her much more time to reflect on her real feelings toward her father. Yes, anger was surprisingly distant from her as she recognized there were much stronger emotions inside of her. Once much more useful. The anger however, couldn't be prevented and neither could the thoughts a week after Heiter had the window discussion with her. It started out innocently enough, or so she believed. Just one simple request. \"Can I take a shower?\" Heiter actually spilled the orange juice he'd carried in and cursed at the mess. Abby waited patiently until he'd cleaned up the mess before asking the question again. \"No.\" \"What a surprise,\" she muttered as she picked at the eggs. Today however, something was stirring inside her. Something that told her she'd been complacent for far too long. That she hadn't fought back and the power was gradually shifting in his direction. So after a few short seconds, Abby asked, \"Is no your favorite word?\" The doctor said nothing, but a hand trailed back to his head and Abby understood just in that common little gesture, the nervousness she'd ignited in him. She wasn't sure whether this spawned from her asking him personal questions, or the question itself, but a part of her felt it was time to follow it with guns ablaze. \"You let me go to the bathroom by myself,\" Abby pointed out, \"a shower isn't that much different. Actually, I think my stink is starting to stink. Pretty soon, your entire house will start smelling like a stinky American until it consumes your yard and then eventually the neighbors will start to smell it and think you threw someone into the oven and poured mustard on them-.\" \"No.\" The one word sliced through the optimistic tone Abby had, but she was determined not to let that word erase the need to pursue an answer. So she tried a different approach. \"I could shower with you.\" And although it was meant to be a joke, a red blush traveled up Heiter's cheeks so quickly that Abby let out a loud chortle. She kept on laughing as he stood up and took the tray off her form. Just as she thought her words had scared him out the door, he paused. \"Do you not remember what I did to your friends? What I did to the man you first woke up next to?\" Abby's smiled disappeared immediately as she observed Heiter's still form. His words had come out harsh, as if he'd long debated the question himself, but did not care for any of the answers he'd gotten. \"I try not to think about that,\" Abby admitted. \"Why? A girl like you does not simply overlook such acts.\" Silence filled the room as Abby grappled inside her mind on what to say. \"When a man like my father,\" she began, \"raises a girl like me, thoughts are bound to be a bit different. I still remember what you did, what you wanted to do and a part of me cannot wait until the day you become distracted and the knife you use to cut the steak ends up in my hand, but I was born with an irritating patience and through the experiences I've been through, my sense of judgment has decreased while my ability to overlook things, increased. My perception of the world is off.\" She didn't know what she expected him to do or say, but when he turned around with hate chipped into his features, Abby held her breath. His emotions had been so stable around her for the past three weeks and to see such sudden hate made her weary. \"If you live by such stupidity, it does not surprise me that you fell into a situation such as this. I pity the way your parents raised you.\" Abby's jaw dropped open. A long forgotten sensitivity stirred at the cutthroat words it received. Her one fist clenched while another remained open and brushed against something hard. Feeling the object beside her Abby returned Heiter's gaze, the frustration only building the longer he stayed in the room. My parents did the best they could to raise me! He does not know enough about me to assume that being compassionate is a weakness. I'm going to-. Gripping the empty glass he'd forgotten to pick up, Abby focused all the strength into her left arm. Just as he was about to turn away, Abby whipped the cup at his head. \"Bastard!\" she yelled as he ducked the object and watched it smash into a million tiny pieces against the door. Her body heat shot up as a vein noticeably stuck out in her neck. Throbbing from the sudden usage of muscle, her arm laid limply by her side. The need to punch or throttle something was immense and when Heiter's smile appeared, Abby only wanted to have another chance at throwing the cup. \"Is bastard your favorite word?\" he mumbled, loud enough just to make sure she heard it. Knowing she was still too weak to chase and rearrange his face, Abby gritted her teeth and flipped him off. And with those actions, a part of her opened up, becoming susceptible to the nagging voice of dependency in her head. She understood that while anger was an incredibly weak emotion, it was also a very destructive one. Addiction was destructive and having managed to open this wound caused her to shift from anger into want. Besides wanting to kill the doctor a thousand times over, the primary want became opium. APHAPHAPHAPH Later in the evening, Heiter entered the room with a pan and broom. He knelt on the floor and began sweeping up the glass. Abby on the other hand, tightened her entire body. A brand new pain infected her, emerging not from her stomach but from her mind. About an hour ago, some sweats began. Sweats partly from the need to have something that would cause a high and partly from trying to use her legs to leave the bed to potentially find that high. She'd almost made it out of the bed, but the adrenaline had deserted her just as she was in the middle of taking the first step. So back down she went. When Heiter informed her about dinner being an hour later, Abby hardly heard. A determination throbbed inside of her. A craving she knew would only cause her to spill out the dinner he promised. Curling, Abby's hands dug into the sheets as the need intensified. I don't need it. It's just a drug. Her body fought in protest, causing a slight shake to speed through her limbs. Involuntarily, Abby remembered what it was like to have allowed the opium to invade. To have no limitations and all the freedom in the world. Freedom from logic, freedom from responsibilities. A freedom so immense it transported her away to where she wasn't stuck in a bed, in a house, in a country. She was free, free, free. Please don't let me do something stupid. If I survive this stage, I only have to worry about it leaving my system. This was the last reasonable thought she shared with herself before the need for opium clouded everything else. I'm only going to divulge this piece of information...it's about to get interesting. And there was a reason Heiter mocked Abby on her lifestyle (give it a shot if you think you know why). I purposely leave out the personal thoughts Abby has with herself on the flashbacks and her ideas because I may hint at them or have them be revealed later in the story. So, till then, hope you like. Let me know what you're thinking in a review ;).[Chapter 7] Thanks both of you guys for your reviews. And thanks for giving a guess to the question because it's probably not one I'm going to address later on in the story. The reason Heiter snapped at Abby like that was because...he was confused as to why she was able to overlook everything he'd done to her up to that point. He knew he'd caused her terror, yet she still conversed with him normally. It almost unnerves him because he talks to her back and perhaps this type of communication isn't something he's used to. Which gets me to ask another question I'm kind of concerned about...is my dialogue good? I have a problem with it and that it's not interesting enough or isn't relaying the emotions I want it to. Anywho, I hope you enjoy this next chapter which I suppose is more interesting in my mind rather than yours because I'm picturing it happening and kind of going :O. Enjoy! Chapter 7 - Going Gray \"Eat.\" The command was simple, but ineffective. \"EAT.\" This time force was added, but Abby kept her lips tight. Her stomach had been growling all day and as evening approached, Abby fell further back into her subconscious. She argued constantly within herself, intent on not getting food unless some opium entered her body. Of course she never voiced this out loud because hell would freeze over the day she asked Heiter for something. But she could not deny how fierce the temptation was. \"If you do not eat, I will force you.\" Abby nearly lashed out at him, but the cogs in her mind churned. \"If I eat,\" Abby began levelly, \"my body will push it back out. I thought a doctor was supposed to know that.\" The last part came out aggressive, but compared to how needy Abby actually was at the moment, it sounded fair to her ears. \"I am a surgeon,\" he corrected. \"And I'm the Queen of England, but you don't see me flaunting my status,\" Abby sarcastically bit out. Heiter stood with tray in hand. Abby risked a glance at him, but a pang hit her as she did. Just staring at the man who was close enough to give her what she wanted, brought enough pain. Still, indecision washed over his face as he pondered the problem. Abby guessed he was torn between threatening her again and handling her little problem. \"Can't you just-,\" Abby choked out, her arms falling to her side. Her eyes screwed shut as sweat stormed down her back. \"Just-a little bit. An ounce.\" Heiter studied her and if Abby wasn't in such a lucid state, she'd have called him out on the pity that briefly fluttered over his features. Instead, said pity caused Abby to push herself up. \"My mom worked in a pharmacy for 13 years. It took her that long to finally succumb to her addiction. What's the harm of just an ounce?\" And the needier her tone became, the more Abby began to believe herself. Snap out of it! Finally, Heiter's lips turned up. In return, Abby's did the same. He's finally seeing reason. \"To think once I thought you of equal intelligence.\" Abby's eyes widened as her heart picked up. \"And to think I didn't kill you when I had the chance!\" she yelled back. Her brain urged her feet to move and attack him, but the logical part held back. Yet, the comment hit with an unprecedented fury. \"I think death would have been more honorable than to watch you grovel.\" And before Abby knew what she was doing her hand pushed down on the bed and lifted her form out. By the time her eyes lifted up, Heiter had retreated to the door. Staggering slightly, Abby straightened herself and observed the man with shakes breaking her insides. \"Grovel?\" Abby began with a laugh, anger replacing the need once present, \"I do not grovel.\" \"Oh of course not,\" was the mock reply. The tone was what did it in the end. Abby lunged forward and began a full on sprint at the man who stood still for a second before retreating through the door and locking it. Abby couldn't stop herself from plummeting body first into the door and cursing at the throb scattering through her head. Leaning gently on the door, Abby pounded once with her palm and only heard soft laughing in reply. Heiter stood directly on the other side. \"You-,\" Abby spat, but couldn't finish the words as a dizzy spell coursed through her. \"Cannot even finish a sentence,\" was the low reply through the door. Abby's eyebrows thinned into anger. \"I swear to God when I get my hands on you I'm going to beat you to death with the fucking tray!\" Abby screamed out, stumbling back from the door in her fury. Expecting a reply back, Abby stood in the spot for a few minutes. Nothing was said. \"Oh, so now you're afraid. You should be!\" she remarked, anger seeping out slightly. Still nothing. Blowing out a frustrated breath, Abby sunk down to her knees and glanced at the bottom of the door. No shadow greeted her vision. \"Fucking coward,\" she muttered. Although temporarily the need for opium subsided, Abby's body was still not used to such activity. And with her brain beginning to shut down from her lack of drugs, Abby found it only a matter of time before she slumped to her side in exhaustion. APHAPHAPHAPH When Abby awoke the next day, she was back in the bed. Her eyes shifted over the surroundings, but closed in remembrance of the night before. At least I can walk now. This thought did nothing to calm her. In fact, with the bed being the only object in the room, it was simple for the dependency to crawl back in to her mind. Today, it was worse. Not only did her body shake, but the need to vomit was staggering. And so she did with little coming out. But at least the food made it to the floor this time. \"Ugh,\" she moaned out. Just a little bit of opium...c'mon Abby, use your charm. Abby nearly vomited again at the thought of what that charm included. I can't live like this. I'll be nice to him. Surely being nice will let him see what's beneficiary for me. The logical side was brushed away when it reminded her just who exactly she was dealing with. APHAPHAPHAPH \"Sorry about the floor,\" Abby carefully noted, observing Heiter wipe away the last of the cream colored bile. \"It is to be expected,\" he muttered. His tone was cold and detached once again. Whatever verbal spar he'd decided to involve her in yesterday, was gone. \"Did you bring any breakfast?\" she tried again, gritting her teeth. Just the idea of eating caused her body to shudder. \"Hold on.\" He left the room momentarily and before Abby had the chance to wonder whether he locked it, Heiter was back with sliced apples and water. \"Normally your meal should be large. However, your body is not reacting as well to the opium. That is the cause of the pain. Small ingestion's are what I recommend.\" Nodding her head numbly Abby reached for the water but it was held out of her reach. Her eyes met his with confusion. \"I only have so many glasses that do not shatter upon impacting a door,\" he answered. Abby nearly choked at the comment. Did he just try to make a joke? Studying his features, Abby dismissed the thought. His lips were in their natural frown and his eyes bored into her like she was a petulant child he had the unfortunate duty to watch. Still... Another shake ascended inside. Abby shook her head in reply as her eyes tightened shut. I need it. I need it. I need it. God, to be so high again. To be so free and not worry. If I don't get it...I have to get it. Wearily raising her head, Abby leaned back as Heiter methodically poured water in her mouth. The journey down was smoothly, but Abby's brain still shouted at her. Get it! Get it! Get it! Get it! \"Josef,\" Abby meekly let out. She could feel rather than see the surprise on his face. \"I think I'm going to die. You don't understand,\" she sobbed, \"how difficult it is to keep telling myself to be strong.\" Risking a glance up, Abby scolded herself for not adding in the tears. \"I think I may kill you just to put myself out of the misery of watching you.\" Abby's mouth hung open as Heiter set the sliced apples in a plastic container, atop her sheets. Without another word, he turned and left the room. APHAPHAPHAPH The next three days were quite possibly the worst days of Abby Post's life. She'd thought hanging on the first few days were bad, but as her brain turned against a determined need to be strong, her emotions soon left their normally neutral state. When Heiter made an appearance, the food he gave her was always in small portions. Abby had tried with all her might to not beg him for the drug, but somewhere along the line, the will inside her broke. Pondering on it unconsciously, Abby was slightly unevred by having been broken down so easily. Even while facing death, her will had been stronger. It had told her to prevail no matter what. That nothing was certain until the actions were taken. To be strong and overcome. But the addiction and dependency broke through each of these repeated rules. Every time Abby had urged herself to be strong, the calm surge of opium resonated in her body. It tore and scratched and forced her to remember how relieving the drug had been. How it had transported her to a place where not even Heiter could reach her. How much happiness it caused when she'd been without it for so long. And perhaps that was when she finally understood why her mother never stopped. What made her continue using and abusing until it poisoned her system in return. She'd needed comfort and her husband wasn't there to provide it for her mind and body. Pills had done that instead. Abby's predicament and the small voice in the back of her head constantly mocked that she'd never be free of Heiter or his home, made the need to depend on something, anything, so simple. Why drugs had broke her down faster than the fear of death, Abby was unsure. Maybe because she'd seen death so often as a child, facing it herself was overdue . Whatever feelings fueled the surge of dependence, Abby knew in her heart of hearts that the only way to turn away from addiction was to say no to it. Addiction wasn't something out of her control. It wasn't something that could take her over and never give her back. She had a choice in it and to fall apart when the end was so near would be death itself. However, facing Heiter was an entirely different matter. One day, she had attempted to convince him that if he fed her another vial of opium, he'd no longer have to worry about her. That the constant cleaning up after her and feeding would finally be over. She'd be out of his hands for good. Dead. His only reply was a condescending nod of the head which forced Abby to dig into the covers. If she didn't, she'd have flung herself at him and perhaps have never gotten the opium. On another day, Abby wasn't feeling as complacent and as soon as he'd walked into the room, she lunged at him. She'd however greatly underestimated how quick his reflexes would be and by the time she was at the door, it'd been shut and locked. At these moments, Heiter had a peculiar habit of standing outside the door and listening to the curses she'd throw at him. \"You communist, fascist, son of a bitch pig!\" Which he would reply with, \"Is that the best you got?\" In turn, this would infuriate her more so she'd scream out, \" Fucking communist, fascist, son of a bitch pig.\" And in return, he'd either say something to set her off and start pounding at the door, or he'd leave. The madness was trying to determine which one he'd do next. While Abby always got the last word in, it never felt like a true victory. Although, one evening as he shuffled in with a sense of careful awareness and trickled water into her mouth, Abby blurted out something that caused a personal victory in her mind. \"Are you a virgin?\" Heiter's face stoned immediately, but that same blush scattered up his cheek. Abby laughed and laughed and laughed until the need for opium was overwhelmed by the need for oxygen. By the time she was able to glance around, Heiter was gone. Of course, she should have known that the victory wouldn't last long. The last few days, when the dependency and withdrawal were at their worst, Heiter walked in and in his palm, he held a bottle of the drug she so desperately craved. At the moment, Abby sprung up in her bed excitedly. Her body nearly burned at the thought of having it in her system again. However, Heiter had also brought in a trash can. Before her eyes, Abby witnessed the doctor uncap the bottle and slowly pour it in the can. The sound alone nearly drove her insane. \"Why would you do that?\" she'd half choked, half screamed out. And Heiter simply retorted, \"Because you don't need it.\" If Abby really wanted to decipher it at the time, she'd suppose those were words of incredible encouragement. Certainly better than the insults he'd thrown at her which she later came to realize had been to distract her from the withdrawal. But, just the way he smiled after pouring the opium out. That's what gnawed at her. So it was no surprise to find them at their same positions on each side of the door, less than three minutes later. This time, Abby was releasing her emotions with the intensity of a bipolar schizophrenic. \"You are the worst human being to ever walk the face of this Earth!\" No reply, but Abby sensed movement behind the door. Her fist swung out and met the door. However, this only caused her knuckles to crack and bleed as a howl of pain was bit back. The door was still intact. \"Surely you can do better,\" Heiter baited from the other side. Abby's breaths came out in frustration. The anger tuned out every other logical emotion trying to have a say in her words. \"Emotionless, ancient bastard.\" \"Whiny American.\" Abby's head retreated in confusion at the insult. \"Jackass.\" \"Idiotic, pathetic girl.\" The need to step up her words was immense. \"Disgusting, talentless son of a fucking donkey.\" Perking up at the silence, Abby wondered if he'd left her again. \"A donkey?\" And Abby nearly laughed at the reply. It was asked in such confusion she nearly felt sorry for saying it. Nearly. The anger still pounded at her veins with the beat of a Latin drum. \"Yes,\" she answered, \"donkey.\" \"I suppose I am thankful,\" Heiter responded after a moment, \"that I am not coward enough to take my own life.\" The air Abby had been holding in, flattened out. The insult was direct and hit hard. Not only was her pride caught in the crossfire, but so was her mind. \"Are you listening to this, Heiter?\" Abby softly asked. There was no reply, but one foot stepped closer to the door. With all the air she could muster, Abby screamed out at the top of her lungs. \"ASEXUAL NAZI!\" APHAPHAPHAPH Eventually, the dependency dissipated. Not to say it cleared out just like a flick of a switch, but it subsided enough to where Abby could have a fair argument with her body. It started a day after she'd had the blow up with the doctor. A grumble in her stomach indicated for once, an actual appetite. Although susceptible to urges, Abby forced all thoughts back that had nothing to do with her well being. But this forced her to refocus on her situation. Not only could she move now, but her head was clearing up. On the down side however, she'd been at the house for over a month and yet still no rescue came. There was no doubt her friends' had made it out of Heiter's clutches, but would they really stay silent on such a matter as kidnapping and attempted torture? That thought accompanied a slew of other questions and pretty soon, Abby promised herself no more waiting. She had to talk to the man whether she liked it or not. APHAPHAPHAPH To her surprise, it was Heiter who'd spoken up first. Two days after the incident (as she called it in her mind), Abby stole a glance at Heiter and lowered the apple slice she'd been about to take in. \"Sorry for swearing at you.\" Heiter met her gaze and he must have seen the honesty reflected because he lowered his gaze soon after. Despite everything the man had done, Abby understood her mindless assaults to be pushed forward by withdrawal from the drug. No one deserved anger directed toward them if the person was having the anger fueled through a selfish purpose. That purpose being opium. Still, her statement seemed to make him uneasy for he stole glances at her each time he didn't think she was looking. Finally, the tension in the air was heavy enough to use as a blanket. \"Tomorrow, we will discuss things.\" Abby said nothing, but she nodded her head in reply. Minutes trailed on and before she knew it, Heiter had taken the tray and was opening the door. \"The part about me calling you an asexual Nazi,\" Abby spoke up as his form lingered in the doorway. \"Yes?\" he questioned, his brown eyes meeting her green ones from across the room, expectantly. Another minute trailed by before something was said. \"You're not a Nazi,\" Abby admitted. With that, she laid back down in the bed and a smile spread over her lips in content. No one said all her comments were untrue. Heiter watched her slumbering form and determinedly attempted not to say something. This attempt failed however as the words traveled out, but just so he could hear them. \"And you are of equal intelligence.\" Abby's slight instability of moving the drugs out of her body and her mind telling her she needs them would in my POV at least, cause her to act out. Hopefully you didn't think it was too stupid. Anywho, let me know what you think in a review, my beautiful reviewers ;).[Chapter 8] Firstly, sorry for the long wait. I had to catch up with school and get back into writing. Second, holy crap! Amazing reviews! Of course I still love my two faithful reviewers, Angel1932 and dark poetess. But now other people have jumped on and I only hope this story continues to interest you all. So without further ado, enjoy! Chapter 8 - Healthy Hazards \"Are you going to rape me?\" The question didn't set loose a single stray emotion from Heiter's face. \"No,\" he finally answered, \"that is not my intention toward you.\" Nodding, Abby leaned back in the bed and stared up at the ceiling. \"Pardon my french and all, but I'd take being fucked in the ass rather than having someone attached to it, any day.\" A choked cough breached the room and Abby found herself smiling slightly at the choice of words. \"Now it is my turn,\" Heiter informed. Biting her lip, Abby rose back up into a sitting position. A half hour ago, Heiter had entered the room with breakfast. It took her 15 minutes to chow it down and another 15 for her captor to explain as briefly as he could, what was to occur. Each day, she was entitled to ask three questions. Yep, magic number three. Heiter had said he'd try to answer them as truthfully as possible. On the other hand, he was able to ask three from her. Initially, the idea seemed strange in her mind. So she voiced it. \"What if I run out of questions?\" Heiter had seemed surprise by the possibility. \"I never believed that to be an option.\" That silenced Abby temporarily. But he was right. Millions of questions bounced around inside her mind. Some general, some reminiscent of her dependency days. The doctor never explained any further and this left Abby more confused than ever. Surely there was a reason he wanted to know things about her. Maybe that could be one of her questions. Stranger still was an almost...casual attitude toward her? From all the signs she'd witnessed eminate from the man, he was the least likely candidate for Mr. Chat of the Year. Then again, he'd continuously surprised her. That could be another question. Whether he had ever been voted Mr. Chat of the Year. Probably voted in by the deaf. In the end however, a long time fear of hers eventually caused the first question of hers to slip out. And luckily, the answer was no. But now it was his turn and Abby's stomach was in knots from all the possible questions he might ask. Would she hold up on her end of the bargain and come clean? \"How did you come to speak German?\" An internal sigh flew through her lips. \"I knew a little from high school. A friend of mine took the class and would often threaten me in German. Later on, I came to realize that his threats were nothing more than asking me how my day was or my name. Still, I think German is a very aggressive language and very easily interpreted as brutal just by the tone one uses. When I came to Germany 3 months ago, I bought a phrasebook. Although I didn't understand everything at first, I remembered my friends' threats toward me. The way he pronounced the words made it a little bit easier to understand. After that, it was just mingling with the locals and picking up what they said.\" Heiter gave a firm nod. I wonder if he's absorbing any of this. Scratching at her wrist, Abby considered how to word her next question. \"How come I haven't been found yet? Surely my friends have made it somewhere populous by now and informed the authorities.\" The doctor's face was somewhere in between cautious and timid. \"When I informed you of my dislike toward others,\" he began, \"I was slightly...untruthful.\" \"So my youthful psychology was right!\" Abby proclaimed with a raised fist. \"Is that your third question?\" he threatened. Shaking her head harshly, Abby's arm fell back to her lap. \"I have...colleagues I keep in touch with. Not often. The few I do, are in-,\" he paused, trying to figure out how to phrase it. \"The legal system?\" Abby questioned sullenly. \"Yes. After the escape, I called them. I've earned one man's respect long ago when I performed on his conjoined twins. The other tends to not care about justice. Without killing the patients, I asked the men to contain the problem.\" Abby was stunned. With all the questions streaming through her mind, she'd be here for years. \"Are they okay? What did he mean? I don't care how powerful you are within the justice system. There is no way Jenny or Lindsey would get sidetracked from something as insane as this. They were kidnapped, drugged, and were about to have an unethical surgery performed on them. They escaped with what I assume and hope, the need to tell the authorites. Are you really saying that something your allies could have said, would prevent them from doing that?\" \"A month of no interference from the police should answer that question.\" \"It wasn't even a question. It was a complaint!\" \"I did not recognize the difference.\" Biting back her frustration, Abby crossed her arms defiantly. But her frustration quickly descended into hurt. The thought of Jenny and Lindsey being so easily persuaded to not tell anyone about the predicament she was in, stung more than she realized. The familiar feeling clawed insensitively at her. \"What do you think your friends did to them?\" Heiter flinched at the terminology, but shook his head. \"You are out of questions until tomorrow.\" A growl rose up her throat. \"And you are-.\" She paused. There was no use further angering the man. Besides, in the cases of abduction she'd heard, this was a very rare opportunity a captee had. Not only was she still alive, but she could get news from the outside world. No matter how badly she wanted to know several things at once, the trick was to have patience. Asking the right questions would surely have an unforseen, but helpful consequence. So Abby inhaled five deep breaths before turning to Heiter. \"I will ask another at lunch,\" he stated, rising. Abby clenched her jaw, but didn't say anything. \"I'd still like a shower,\" she called after him. The man's only response was closing the door. APHAPHAPHAPH \"How are you feeling?\" \"Is that your second question?\" \"It is a general one.\" \"General my ass.\" \"Yes, you have refered to your ass numerous times.\" \"Because I would like it to remain just an ass.\" \"In what terms?\" \"Is that your second question?\" \"Yes.\" Abby paused, mulling over her thoughts. \"What you showed me a month ago...what you planned on doing to Jenny, Lindsey and the other man...that was sick. I don't think I could even fathom doing something so disgusting to a human.\" Heiter said nothing. His face gave away no remorse or sympathy. But no glee or pride set in either. \"This experiment that you want to perform,\" Abby explained, \"I don't want to wake up one morning to have had it done on myself. I would like my ass to remain just that...an ass. Normal, human, and oral free.\" \"Ah.\" One of Abby's eyebrows rose. \"Ah? That's it? You're almost as ruthless as-.\" Her voice trailed off, fighting back a dangerous comparison. A brutal silence stretched between them. Abby wondered whether Heiter had figured out already who she was going to compare him to. That subject wasn't one she was ready to talk about just yet. \"I will not perform the experiment on you.\" Abby's eyes widened. A gasp brushed through her lips. \"You're kidding.\" \"I am not.\" Studying him, Abby forced herself to calm down. The excitement had to be concealed to a certain extent. If she allowed herself to be thankful for a privelege, it would issue the man a sense of control over her. \"Wow. I'm very, very relieved. If only I could take a-,\" she trailed off. Heiter rolled his eyes and Abby nearly grinned at the display. For such a strung together man to act out on a childish gesture was a very pleasant experience to watch. \"Perhaps some time,\" he finally expressed. \"Really?\" \"Your questions have already run out.\" \"How am I supposed to figure out the difference between a general question and a question I'm allowed to ask? Think about it. If I run out of my questions one day and then ask if I can go to the bathroom, what kind of question will that be considered? And what's the point of asking questions when we could do it endlessly without a time limit?\" The confusion scattered on Heiter's features only made Abby continue in elation. \"We could get to know each other and become pen pals. I had a pen pal once. He was a really nice British boy. We sent pictures back and forth to each other for months. When I turned 17, he sent me a picture and told me only to open it when I was alone.\" \"And what did the picture reveal?\" \"Is that your seco-.\" \"YES.\" \"His penis,\" Abby expressed with a slight grin. \"He sent me a picture of his penis. It was about the length of a magic marker, give or take a few inches...probably take.\" \"Charming,\" he noted. \"Hey, don't you dare be a negative Nancy. It's not like you'd have anything to send me anyway what with you being asexual and all.\" A strange look came over the doctor's face at the statement. \"You really believe I am asexual?\" he questioned. Abby scanned Heiter from head to toe carefully. \"As sick as this is going to sound, you'd have to have been asexual not to have done anything to us while we were knocked out on all the drugs.\" Heiter stood abruptly. His long legs were at the door in seconds. \"Just because I did not do anything to you while unconscious, does not mean I did not want to.\" Abby's mouth dropped open. \"Damn.\" \"Indeed.\" And in seconds, the doctor was gone. APHAPHAPHAPH When Heiter entered the room for the third time that day, bringing dinner with him, Abby was somewhat unnerved. Not that she hadn't been unnerved up to this point, but the last statement he'd left her with had really challenged her thoughts. If her dad tried to analyze Heiter, he would have assumed the same thing she had. He had no emotional, physical, or sexual needs. Something hung unbalanced within his mind, overriding normal human needs. Of course Heiter could have been lying about his sexual interest. Just to surprise her. If this was the case, her synopsis of the man had gone back to square one. So her mind began working and finally, she developed a plan. It was incredibly stupid, incredibly dangerous, but it had to be done. Based on his reaction, Abby could then gather a better sense of the man. She needed this information in the long run so when escape was possible, she wouldn't underestimate anything about him. Abby would get to know him just as well as her father go to know his victims. \"I think my hand is infected. I didn't wash it out to well after I punched the door,\" Abby commented after Heiter had set down the tray at the foot of the bed. His face immediately stoned as he leaned toward her. His eyes shifted down to her arm and lifted it, observing the knuckle area carefully. It's now or never. With the gracefulness Abby was capable of, she leaned in just as Heiter's gaze met hers. His mouth was open to retort that she'd washed rather consistently. Instead, Abby's mouth met his. Heiter was absolutely still as Abby moved her lips around his. Her tongue peeked out and ran its length across his upper lip while her teeth lightly bit down on his lower lip. It must have been 30 seconds before Abby got the biggest shock of her life. Heiter responded by pushing his lips into hers. He gently met her licks and offered in more pressure. Ten seconds passed before he paused. Abby's mind was filled from emotions A to Z. She didn't expect him to respond. She especially didn't expect him to enjoy it or actually be a decent kisser. No. No! NO! It was with even greater shock that she found herself pinned to the bed, but not in the good way. Heiter's hand was currently wrapped around her throat and gazing up at the man let her know that she commited a very, very bad mistake. She tried to claw at his hold on her, but he only forced more pressure before things began to swim around her. \"Why?\" he gritted out. Abby tried to say something, but her oxygen was cut off. \"WHY?\" he nearly yelled. A slight ease on her throat loosened the tension and alowed oxygen to flow through. \"Tr-tried to-.\" Another centimeter eased off her throat before Abby could finally get a word in. \"Trying to understand you,\" she choked out before darkness met her vision and she slumped back into the bed. Yeah...so this thing between them has just gotten awkward. I'm glad I did it though. To have a happy go lucky \"relationship\" between them is a bit too unrealistic. I try to see it as in Abby's mind, she wants to figure out Heiter so badly just so she can know who he is and potentially find a weakness in him (same thing her father did). However, she greatly underestimated the reaction she'd get. But fear not...perhaps things will get better for my favorite captor and captee. Anywho, let me know what you're thinking in a review![Chapter 9] Thank you for the reviews my lovely reviewers! This next chapter is kind of...more on the thoughtful side. But things go down, even if it's not in dialogue per se. Enjoy! Chapter 9 - Ill Indifference The night was pitch black and the only noise littering the atmosphere was Abby's rhythmic breaths as she slept. Heiter entered the room carefully. Through the darkness, he could just make out her form. His hand scattered across the wall and found the light dial. Easily, he rotated it until the room lit up to a slight dim. Enough so that her shape was recognizable. Gripping the object in his right hand, Heiter observed the girl thoughtfully. When she slept, her sleek black hair sprayed across the pillow. She complained numerous times about not being able to shower, but he really didn't see how it could make her appearance finer. As far as women were concerned, she had nothing to be embarrassed about. This thought made him uneasy, so he forced himself toward her. He could see even from a distance, nightmares engraved in her face. Like a puppet, her limbs would move like spasms rocked them. Although normally calm around him, her eyebrows shot down as if she'd just inhaled something rotten. And her mouth would curl back or rest in a silent scream. The night she'd first overdosed, Heiter had been able to witness first hand all of these symptoms. He couldn't tell as of yet whether she was more vulnerable as she slept or while awake. But he knew something was processing and with the opium running through her bloodstream, whatever processed would only get worse. As he reached the side of the bed, Heiter wondered for perhaps the hundredth time, whether he should have killed her as soon as he'd found her blood type not favorable. But an unspoken instinct inside him reveled in her persistency to not show fear around him. And someone intelligent. He could tell just by the way her eyes had lingered when she'd entered his home or the communication she'd set up with the man he'd killed. It only progressed worse from there. He had prided himself for so long on being able to slice open a human with no considerable interest for the being itself. It was merely a medial experiment. But he couldn't force that through his own head when he had the chance to kill Abby as she'd lain helpless on the cot. Nor when he'd cursed at her overdosed form and his own stupidity at following her when she'd just been distracting him from the others. He hoped desperately that she wouldn't ask why he was keeping her alive. Not because he didn't know, quite the opposite in fact. He knew very well why he was doing so and the irreversible change she was having on his normally indifferent emotions. And when she'd kissed him- Shaking his head harshly, Heiter lifted the gun and pressed it gently to Abby's forehead. Of course it had to be at this exact moment Abby noted even within her garbled sleep, the sudden coolness of an object upon her. Like an electric shock to her system, Abby's green eyes sprung open. The crust gathered around her lids, scrambled out of the corner of her eyes. \"Oh,\" she breathed out. Heiter stared back at her with not an ounce of information she could gather on his face, holding a gun to her head. The room was silent for a moment. That is, until Heiter pulled back the trigger and Abby involuntarily shivered at the vibration. For some reason, maybe due to the intense stress of keeping up such a tough façade around him or perhaps not even realizing how unbalanced her mind truly had gotten over the past month, Abby couldn't keep back the wetness from gathering like a pool, in her eyes. Very shortly, her gaze became bleary and with a gasped choke, the tears began pouring down her cheeks. Initially, they were big, fat drops and their intensity picked up when Abby squeezed her eyes together. She made absolutely no noise but the occasional sobs she couldn't keep inside. Her face became red and slippery while her arms shook from keeping her form up. All the ferocious pain Abby had kept built up seemed to overwhelm all her senses. She didn't even become aware anymore of the gun at her head or the man whose features shifted at witnessing such a strong woman weep. It was perhaps a full ten minutes before Abby's tears thinned and her bloodshot eyes opened. And upon observing the room twice, making sure her vision was accurate, she found herself alone. \"Oh god,\" she mumbled wearily, gripping the blanket to herself. Her head fell back and without any warning, her body gathered itself into the fetal position. For the rest of the night, and well into morning, Abby slipped in between bouts of intense weeping or uncanny staring at the wall ahead of her with not a trace of emotion on her face. And that was how Heiter found her the next morning. APHAPHAPHAPH Heiter watched with hidden anxiety as Abby slowly ate her breakfast. Her normally animated features were removed completely, replaced by trembling lips and unfocused eyes. The robotic movements in which she'd eaten her breakfast further set him on edge. He didn't know why, but something in his gut was informing him that the current fracture in her mind was his fault. \"Planning on killing yourself again?\" he questioned. He was trying to rile her up like he had when she'd been going through the withdrawal. Just so some sort of emotion besides the one she was in, would peek within her. Abby barely shot him a glance as she ate up the rest of the eggs before vacuuming down the orange juice. When Heiter lifted the tray, Abby slithered back into the bed, turned away from the man and wrapped her hands around herself. APHAPHAPHAPH Lunch and dinner went much of the same way. Abby ate the food provided, said nothing to the jabs Heiter threw at her, and held herself after the food was in her stomach. Somewhere far away in her mind, a part that was normally logical and sturdy, gasped at the broken down doll she'd become. But it couldn't blame her too much. When Heiter had placed the gun to Abby's forehead, she finally believed without the shadow of a doubt, he was going to kill her. And with this belief, something inside her didn't snap, but simply dissolved. There is a common phrase one uses when they face death. \"Your whole life flashes before your eyes.\" This held nothing but the truth for Abby. Over and over, she replayed her childhood like it was a cheaply made VCR tape. Constant heartache pounded within her veins when she realized what her father put her through. He brought home and killed people in the shed of their backyard. And sometime around her 10th birthday, he decided on including her. She never physically harmed any of the \"patients\" her father had, but she was just as guilty as he. She'd touched them and marveled at them and ignored the questionable voice in her mind that wondered whether the people were still alive or not. Yet, she learned. She learned where the trachea or the jugular or the brain stem was. She learned how to prevent a bruise from forming or close a wound before it became fatal. She learned how to not show fear when that's all your mind insists on doing. She didn't morph into a killer, but she sure held the instincts for one. This thought not only petrified her, but made her wonder what she'd be if her father was still around. Would he bring home victims on a nightly basis and they'd drink Sprite while plotting the best way to cut off their victims breathing? This thought alone made Abby clutch on to herself tighter. But that didn't happen. Her father taught her as much as he believed she needed to know, not just for that time period, but for the rest of her life. He knew...he had to have known that he wasn't going to return. But why would he have placed false hope within her mother? Surely he saw how delicate to the situation she was also. He must have been able to prevent her descent into prescription abuse and then eventual death. Or my own pain. That's why I dated so many guys, knowing how hopeless the relationships truly would be. And this only caused her to grow confused. She hated and loved her father at the same time. Two opposite, yet passionate emotions that whirled inside her and blocked out everything logical around her. It was the reason she came to Berlin. It was the reason she stayed holed up in her hotel room for 3 months, trying hard to make sense of the only postcard her father had sent to them before his disappearance. And why do I even want to find the bastard? All he did was cause misery not only to us, but to the families of his victims. For some reason, Abby negated this thought. A childish part of her still couldn't accept her father as the big, bad man police had warned her about meeting. But perhaps those were the functions of a sociopath. To be charming, #1 dad one day, then vicious fiend the next. APHAPHAPHAPH Throughout the rest of the week, Abby stayed cocooned not only in her position but in her mind. The heartache had turned into guilt when she'd thought of all the victims who'd died. She'd only asked the identity of one of them one time, and the rest remained unnamed John Doe's. Toward the latter part of the week, this thought sparked a curious inquisition inside her. And the more she thought about it, the more she wondered how she could be so stupid as to not check out the possibility. In turn, this excitement began to expand to her features. By Wednesday, she was eating her meals in a slightly less catatonic state. What forced away straight on excitement was the fact that even if she were to try out her theory, there would be no way Heiter would allow her anywhere near what she wanted. Said man also refrained from questioning her for some odd reason, at least for a little while. But this newly branded spike of inspiration accompanied with all of the other possibilities sprouting inside her mind, lifted up her hope to a place it hadn't been in a while. So after 9 days of her weary entrapment, Abby should have been ready to answer Heiter's question. More than ready, really. APHAPHAPHAPH \"Come again?\" she croaked. Abby's lunch had been eaten long ago and the tray was lying on the floor near Heiter's feet. \"I want to know why you wandered in the middle of a woods in Germany?\" Her first instinct was to share the same excuse she'd thrown at Lindsay and Jenny. But, she knew he wouldn't buy it. His questions were picked out carefully and if he asked them, he generally wanted to know the answer. \"I was looking for an address.\" \"Whose?\" \"I don't know. I discovered it nearly a year ago, written with invisible ink of all things, on a postcard my father had sent from Germany.\" The tale seemed to have engrossed Heiter. His eyes were wide and curious. But he said nothing else. Abby knew he wanted to know more, but his last personal question was on the line for the day and he wanted to use it carefully. Despite the fact he would have killed her had she not opened her eyes at the exact time he'd put the gun to her head, Abby was craving the need to divulge the mystery, even a little bit, to the man ahead. Not only was he smart, but he might even know the address she was talking about considering the location of his house. So, she went on. \"My father left unexpectedly when I was 10, nearly 11. I only knew it was to Berlin because I overheard him arguing about it with my mom. I didn't even know he'd sent a postcard until my mom died. Some of her belongings I inherited included the postcard. My dad had sent it two months after he promised to return. It was from Berlin, but I could tell that wasn't his location. I don't know how...but I could. Anyway, at the time, I was dating a forensics student in college and he had access to a lab. I only wanted to know what the dried stain on the card was, but I ended up finding out a lot more.\" Abby met Heiter's intense gaze and continued. \"Not only was the stain blood, but he'd put the postcard under different lightings and found the invisible ink. It scrawled out an address we immediately realized to be foreign, but I knew to be in my dad's handwritting. When I came to Germany, I looked up the address on a map and eventually, set off to find it.\" Heiter studied her in nothing short of amazement. \"That was a very...smart thing to do.\" He didn't elaborate on which aspect, and Abby accepted the compliment without asking. \"What was the address?\" he asked. \"I have it in the bag I had with me when I took shelter here.\" The man across her had the audacity to look uncomfortable. \"What?\" \"I burned it.\" \"You...you burned my bag?\" \"I had to rid all possessions.\" \"Well...what if I had a puppy in there? Would you burn the puppy just because it was in my possession?\" Heiter rolled his eyes at the question while Abby grumbled in reply. \"Had my favorite pair of jeans in there,\" she muttered. \"Why did you not take a vehicle to find this location?\" Drowning out the annoyance, Abby thought about the question for a minute. \"If I did find something at this address, I didn't want anything to link me to it. It was thankful that I had a taxi driver who managed to go as far as he did. The rest though, I had to do on my own.\" \"Hmm.\" \"You're out of questions.\" The doctor frowned in confusion before opening his mouth. \"And do not tell me that the 3 question rule doesn't apply to you!\" Just as quickly, he closed his mouth and in a few short minutes, left the room. APHAPHAPHAPH During dinner, Abby asked her first question of the day. \"Could you look up a name for me?\" \"Name?\" \"Yes.\" Pondering the thought, Heiter shrugged. \"Okay.\" \"Good...and I need another favor.\" Heiter's body stiffened, but he didn't say anything. \"I would really appreciate it if...if you could ask your...acquaintances in the justice department, to look up the name.\" This sparked a visible interest in the man. \"What for?\" \"Out of questions.\" One of Heiter's fingers twitched, but otherwise, he nodded. \"His name is Sebastian Coulter. He died about 12 years ago in Livonia, Michigan. That is, in the United States. He had no children, no wife, but was wealthy. He owned 3 homes, one in Miami. He was 35 when he died.\" Technically murdered. But Abby refrained from this little drop of information. She could see Heiter's need to know why this information was important, but he could ask another day for all she cared. The answer, if her theory was certain, could potentially change everything she knew about her father. APHAPHAPHAPH Abby awoke to find Heiter watching her. This was most definitely a first considering he always came into the room at the exact same time each day. But she could tell that he'd done what she asked and the information was important enough to have entered well before the usual time she awoke. So the creepiness wasn't too bad. \"Sebastian Coulter,\" he began with a strange light of the eyes, \"was known very well by another name.\" He paused after this and Abby nearly groaned. \"No time for dramatics, Heiter!\" This seemed to amuse him slightly. \"Others in the United States as well as newspapers may know your friend better,\" he explained, \"as the Countryside Killer.\" All of the air left Abby's lungs and despite her promise never to do so again, she soon found darkness surrounding her as her head met the pillow. I really do have plot, I promise. I just hope you all can follow it as I write it. We'll be finding out some interesting things about Abby's daddy. Anywho, let me know what you're thinking in a review![Chapter 10] Thank you very much for the one review! I feel like I've scared other people off now that I've included plot. Ah well. To the lovely reviewer who is probably the fifth person to think Heiter is her father...I lol'd at your incest theory. I know some authors say things just to throw their readers off, but I am here to say that without a doubt, 100%, Heiter is NOT NOT NOT NOT Abby's father. I'm trying to shift the plot so that they interact using Abby's fathers mysterious disappearance which will have more ground to it as the story goes on. But thank you for the review nonetheless because it made me squee. Very loudly. Anywho, there will be some translations at the bottom so feel free to read them before, during, or after. Enjoy! Chapter 10 - Joyful Jitters \"You faint so often, I almost wonder if it's a condition.\" Abby ignored the man's amusement as she finished the remainder of her eggs. She needed the food to process just exactly what she'd learned. \"The Countryside Killer,\" she replied to herself, tasting the words bitterly. Heiter glanced at her, then back down at his hands. He let out a large breath before speaking. \"You did not know the man Coulter, did you? His murders are rather...appauling.\" \"Wow. I never thought I'd see the day you found something appauling.\" He didn't crack a smile, but Abby grinned for the both of them. Then with calm hesitancy, she passed her tray to him and leaned back on the bed to collect her thoughts. \"I did know him,\" she explained. \"Not while he was alive however. Sebastian Coulter was one of my dad's victims.\" \"Your father, the serial killer?\" Despite the seriousness of the topic, Abby smiled at the way Heiter pronounced it. \"Yes, my father, the serial killer. I only thought to ask one time the name of the person we'd be working on. I really believed they'd just wake back up after we got...done with them. That their names didn't matter.\" \"And you have a reason for asking me to check in on the man?\" Nodding, Abby scratched at her chin. \"I think my dad, the serial killer...well, I think he murdered other serial killers.\" As soon as she'd said it, Abby knew it felt right. Not because she was still trying to defend her father years after his sudden disappearance. But because the cogs in her mind were churning and the sudden information about Sebastian Coulter made sense. Plus, if her father was an all out serial killer, there was no way he'd have been able to be around as long as he had. The police may even have picked up on his trail, but upon learning that the residential serial killers were being knocked off, may not have proceeded with as much intensity over the case. Less work for them if someone else was doing their job. \"I just wish,\" she continued on, \"that I would have asked more of their names. I feel like I'm half right.\" She was about to ask Heiter what he thought, but stopped herself in time. The man across from her could have been one of her father's victims quite easily. And maybe this was some sort of karma. For all the potential serial killers her father killed, it was only fair that she be captured by one. Oh cruel irony. \"What was your father like?\" Abby didn't hesitate to answer. \"He was intelligent. Really, really intelligent. There was never a question he didn't know. Sometimes he'd over analyze situations...but that was just his way. He also loved my mother and I very much. Enough to shelter us were he to ever get caught. After he disappeared and my mother died, I got left a lot of money. They planned ahead, both of them, in case anything ever happened. But, I also think that my dad could be colder than the bodies he hoisted on to the gurneys. I don't think he was the kind of man to grin away while chopping up a body or stopping a man's heart. He could be calculative and very intense. And he brought me into that side of him at times. But...I trusted him to always lead me out and he always did.\" \"You must have loved him even before you discovered why he killed.\" \"Yes,\" Abby agreed. \"Maybe that's a bit sick, but he was my father. That might be an old excuse, but it's the truth. I loved him and after I got over him being gone, I accepted him as a role model. That is, until I got into high school and began thinking about what he and I had done in our warehouse.\" \"Did he ever make you kill someone?\" Heiter questioned curiously. \"Never. He wanted me to know the human body and how the brain worked. He wanted me to know emotions and facial expressions and how to tape yourself up after you'd been shot or stabbed. Most of the time, the bodies were just props, but on occasion, he'd ask me where a certain area of the body was or to describe its' condition. They were all dead by the time I layed a hand on them. Not that I took that in at that age.\" \"Just a child,\" Heiter agreed. A comfortable silence soared between the two as Abby lost herself in her thoughts. \"About kissing you...\" she suddenly remarked. Heiter didn't say a word, but she could sense how uncomfortable he was about the situation. \"My dad taught me to know your enemy. That the human face expresses a hundred emotions each minute. To gather the advantage, understand the other person. I kissed you,\" Abby indicated, a blush crawling up her cheeks, \"because I was trying to understand you. I didn't register how shocking or disturbing it'd be to you, but if there was something inside you that responded, I very much was willing to use it against you.\" The doctor was silent for a minute, studying Abby with a deep frown. Finally, he stated, \"Some of your father's mannerisms were passed on to you.\" For a second, Abby was confused. \"You think he kissed men to figure them out?\" Choking back a laugh that even surprised him, Heiter shook his head. But he didn't need to explain. Abby believed the statement without a doubt. \"You do not ever feel the urge to kill?\" Abby's eyes widened at the question. \"Of course not. I...it's not like if my college roommate wore my shirt without my permission, she'd wake up to me taking out a kidney without her permission. I don't really have a vengeance streak, something that made dating me very easy for guys.\" Heiter nodded as if it was the explanation for the universe. \"Were you really going to kill me that night?\" she suddenly asked again. Running a hand through his hair, Heiter's dark eyes met hers. \"No doubt you have already concluded an answer to the question.\" \"I have,\" Abby immediately answered. \"I just need to be sure of it. You know...so I can rearrange my plans.\" A flash of annoyance briefly flickered over his face before he nodded once more. \"Yes,\" he stated. \"I was going to kill you.\" Abby was relieved at the bolt of fear that shot through her. But when she glanced back up, Heiter seemed like he was on the verge of divulging more. However, something inside him decided not to, so he stood up with the tray and shortly left the room. APHAPHAPHAPH As soon as the door shut behind her, Abby observed herself in the mirror. At least 3 times a day, she was alowed out to use the bathroom. On days when she wasn't up to speaking to her captor, she simply indicated her need by standing up and crossing her fingers. Other days when their relationship was less hostile, she'd simply ask. The bathroom was completely empty of any potential weapons. No poisonous chemicals underneath the sink nor any medicine of any kind. The mirror was thin and even if she decided to try to smash it with one of her body parts, she doubted any pieces would come out. Heiter was even clever enough to remove the top of the toilet drain just in case she lifted it off and decided to smash him across the head with it. Abby quickly discovered that the bathroom would only be used for just that - a bathroom. But, upon studying her thin hair in the mirror and tracing a finger across her forehead and cringing at how greasy it was, a frustrated sigh flew through her lips. The doctor always waited on the other side, but he'd removed the lock to the door so he could enter any time he chose. Usually, Abby washed her face with the small amount of soap she was provided with, used the toilet, then tried to clean the rest of her body with the soap. However, this was a complete pain. She had to take off her gown to do this act and while it made her feel clean some of the time, other times she simply wished warm water would spray over her and she wouldn't have to worry about having the soap slip out of her hand or not being able to reach her back. And the more frustrated she grew, the faster her eyes scattered across the room. This couldn't continue any longer. Oh my god...I've got it! Mulling over the plan once more, Abby cringed at the loopholes. But they'd been especially tolerant toward each other as of late and surely he wouldn't think much about-. Inhaling slowly, Abby tucked a stray piece of hair behind her ear before opening the door. Heiter stood there as usual, ready to escort her back to the room. I have to make my move now. \"Do you have any tampons?\" The doctor stared at her as if she'd just asked him to donate one of his testicles to a medical facility. \"You know tampons?\" Abby questioned. \"When a woman has her time of the month, a tampon prevents her from bleeding out a river.\" And another internal surge of happiness ignited in her when she saw the red beginning to appear on his cheeks. \"Let me look in the other bathroom,\" he finally answered. His body however, turned toward her room first. \"Wait!\" Abby exclaimed. \"I'm going with you.\" A suspicious eyebrow raised at the request. \"Unless you'd rather I bled all the way down the hallway and then into the bed.\" Barely supressing a cringe at the image, Heiter swiftly grabbed her wrist before retreating down the opposite hallway. Yes! He moved at a rapid pace, but Abby was still able to glimpse at the objects she passed. He'd kept her in a bedroom isolated from the rest of the house, nearly the opposite end of the entryway. A sudden sharp turn nearly made her trip, but Heiter's strong grip on her wrist kept her on her feet. The intended bathroom soon appeared before her and Abby swallowed her joy upon seeing a shower inside. Okay, careful now. Very careful. Heiter paused suddenly, glancing at the door and then back at her. With a reluctant step, he pulled her into the bathroom behind him with one hand while reaching for a drawer with the other. Abby's feet grew chilly with the tile, but her eyes warmed at the sight of the shower. She risked a glance down at Heiter who was carefully running his hand over the far end of one of the drawers. His eyes were completely focused and this gave Abby the final go ahead light. Taking in his hand around her wrist, Abby neared herself and ever so slightly, raised the two entangled limbs. Just when Heiter found what he was looking for, Abby brought her mouth down to her wrist and bit down on Heiter's hand. HARD. A yelp flew from his lips and he immediately withdrew while Abby took quick advantage of the brief distraction. She ducked under his bitten arm and glided past him. He spun around to grab at her, but Abby swung out a leg and kicked him square in the chest. And like a Rambo film, Heiter flew back from the impact. His body fell to the floor, right outside the door to the bathroom. There was a moment where they both stared at each other, baffled at the positions they currently found themselves in. Abby inside the bathroom, and Heiter laying on the floor. Soon, the moment dissolved and Abby grabbed the door just as Heiter picked himself up. With a triumphant slam, she locked it with shaking hands and ignoring his yells and violent poundings, turned around. Nimble fingers threw off her gown and within seconds, Abby was stepping into a shower for the first time in nearly 2 months. APHAPHAPHAPH If a shower could ever give someone an orgasm, it would be Abby Post. When the hot beads first slammed into Abby's rigid form, she cried. They weren't great sobs, but simple drops she couldn't keep in. Such a pleasurable experience to have been withdrawn from her for so long was an occasion to rejoice in. As the tears subsided, Abby allowed herself to forget everything but the rhythmic tap! tap! tap! of the water spraying her body. Once, twice, three times she twirled around with a laugh and raised her arms proudly. She opened her mouth, then closed it and shivered as the cold in her body was quickly replaced with heat. She rubbed at her arms and let her fingers explore each crevice of her body, truly cleaning it. One eye strayed to the side and her grin became brighter at noticing not only soap, but shampoo. Grabbing the soap, she lathed her entire body and laughed at the smell. It was a mix of lavender and pear blossom. Studying the shampoo minutes later, Abby's eyes couldn't translate the German. She momentarily hesitated about using it. It was Heiter's and there was something incredibly strange about using her captor's shampoo. Might make my hair thin out. But she'd noticed the thickness of his hair and knew this shampoo wasn't for baldness. Only one way to find out. Squirting a pale pink glob on to the center of her palm, Abby risked a sniff and smiled once more. For a man so dark and insane, he certainly had good taste in hygiene products. She spent five minutes scrubbing at her scalp before rinsing her hair. The entire shower took 20 minutes, but it was one of the best 20 minutes of Abby's life. APHAPHAPHAPH Abby was slightly surprised upon stepping out of the shower, to still see the door in tact. This made her a tad nervous, but whatever Heiter's retaliation would be, at least she'd die clean and happy. Her eyes scanned the room almost shyly before locating a separate door. Keeping her balance on the slippery floor, she prayed Heiter wouldn't choose that exact moment to enter. He really didn't need to see her any more naked than she already had been. Swinging open the door, Abby grinned at the abundance of white towels. Picking one out, she wrung her hair out twice before wrapping it tightly around her body. Now what do I do? She glanced at the door and then back around the bathroom. Through the steam, she didn't note any obvious objects to use for defense. And at the moment, her heart really wasn't into searching. Desperately, she wanted to crawl back into the bed and sleep. So with nerves bouncing around inside, she pulled the towel tighter to herself and with a sigh, slowly opened the door. No one there. \"What a relief,\" she mumbled. Taking a brave step out of the bathroom, Abby quickly observed the opposite ends of the hallway. Heiter could just be watching right now, waiting for me to make a run for it. But that wasn't the case for in that exact same moment, she heard said man speak from somewhere in the kitchen area. Mindlessly following his low voice, she couldn't distinguish the German from English he was speaking. With built up curiosity, she passed his bedroom, turned a corner and suddenly walked smack dab in the middle of a conversation. With only a towel covering her body. Three pairs of eyes turned to her and Abby couldn't have faked her blush even if she tried. Without meaning to, her eyes glanced toward Heiter and noted how wide his eyes were. She then shifted her focus to the two men staring in interest at her. \"Hallo!\" she exclaimed in a sudden rush, lifting a wet hand. The current embarassment of the situation weighed down on her heavily. She was standing, wrapped in a towel in front of three men. I'd kill to know what they think of me right now. But she hadn't missed the unease Heiter had been expelling before she'd entered and quickly understood why. The two men had badges attached to their front pockets. Oh my god. I'm saved. Her eyes found Heiter's once more and something inside her churned at his gaze. This is my captor, damn it! I am not staying here a moment longer. It was obvious now that they'd been grilling him before she'd entered. Tell them. Tell them I'm the missing girl they're most likely looking for. But despite everything, Abby couldn't get the words out of her throat. Instead, she began saying the complete opposite. \"Es tut mir leid. Ich hatte keine ahnung Josef mit gasten wurde.\" Now it was time for both men to look confused and Heiter's wide eyes to evolve into unabashed astonishment. What the hell am I doing? However, she babbled on as if it was a normal occurence for her to protect her kidnappers. \"Liebling,\" Abby stated in a somewhat breathy tone, forcing her feet to move across the carpet, \"sie viersprach, mich zu begleiten.\" And she pouted as an afterthought. She had to hand it to the man for being so quick to keep his emotions in check. Otherwise, the two men opposite him would have continued without a doubt, their suspicious questioning. \"Sie sind...?\" one of the men asked. Throwing a meaningful glance at the man before her, Abby spun around with a large grin. \"Freundin,\" she lightly answered. \"Ist Josef in schwierigkeiten?\" To emphasize her false concern, one hand immediately found Heiter's and squeezed it. Finally, one of the detectives sighed as if what he wanted to happen, didn't. \"Nicht. Eine frau vermisst hier in der nähe. Sie haben gesehen, etwas seltsam hier in der Gegend in letzter Zeit?\" Abby was only able to decipher about half of his sentence. Luckily, her \"other half\" took over for vocals. \"Nicht. Ich habe hier entweder arbeiten oder mit Emilie,\" Heiter smoothly responded. Smiling at the name, Abby couldn't help but admire how quick he was to think of not only being alright with her sudden half naked appearance, but providing her with a false name. The two men exchanged looks with each other before finally nodding. \"Vielen dank fur ihre zeit,\" one detective stated. \"Jederzeit,\" Abby answered with another overbearing smile. Their departure took no longer than two minutes. And after the sound of their car sliding over the gravel met Abby's ears, she finally had the chance to back up from the door and try to understand what she just did. Without direction, her feet found their way into the living room with Heiter following behind. He too was filled with curiosity and kept his distance to a certain degree. Abby sunk down on to the sofa Heiter had first been sitting on the night she'd been drugged and shook her head. Why didn't I tell them? Good god it would have been 3 against one. They probably had guns! Keeping one hand on her towel, Abby lifted the second and slowly traced it through her damp hair. I cannot be experiencing Stockholm Syndrome. I still assert my own independence (as obvious by the shower) and I certainly have no fondness toward my captor. Squeezing her eyes shut, Abby practiced inhaling and exhaling slowly. There was something in his gaze. He looked to me with a troubled expression and I froze. I looked at his well being before my own...and now I'm back to being a prisoner. But no. It was deeper than that. He hasn't killed me. He found out the information about Sebastian. He was generally interested in the mystery of my father. And that was it. Since she'd begun her journey, Abby had no one to confide in. She followed a postcard blindly, expecting the answers to appear like some sort of Scooby Doo episode. When they didn't, her confusion grew. Then remembering Sebastian Coulter and learning of his identity, thus sprouting a whole different view of her father, excited her. She knew it interested Heiter as well. He'd waited however long it was for her to wake up, just so he could tell her the news. He'd know she'd make something of it. Did I really just give up my freedom because I enjoyed sharing the mystery of my father with a madman? This thought required another deep breath to pass through her lips. She didn't register the weight drop beside her or Heiter's eyes searching her face. All she focused on was her breathing. Then suddenly, Heiter smiled. Abby had the fortunate opportunity to see the smile and silently marvel at it. It made him look boyish, nearly 10 years younger. \"What?\" she whispered out. \"You smell like me.\" The statement couldn't have puzzled her more if he would have suddenly pulled an elephant out of his ass and rode it into the nearest town. \"I suppose I do,\" she finally answered. Heiter's face transformed back into seriousness, but something shifted between them. Something Abby couldn't quite put her finger on. \"I'm surprised you let me shower,\" she stated for lack of a better thing to say. \"They knocked just as I was about to get the sledgehammer.\" \"A sledgehammer? Really? What's so bad about me taking a shower?\" She said this with a huff, throwing one hand in the air. The doctor had no well thought out reply so Abby leaned back on the sofa triumphantly. They stayed like that in silence for five minutes before Abby for the second time in two days, began to see black appear before her. \"You might actually have to check this fainting thing out,\" was Abby's last mumble before her eyes drifted shut.

Mad cause now the plot is coming! The plot is coming! Oh...and this plot may force you to remember things from previous chapters so make sure the information doesn't spill out of your mind like loose change. Let me know what you're thinking in a review![Chapter 11] So I've been gone...for a LONG time. I just want to apologize to anyone who was actually following this story and to my reviewers. Honestly, and I can't say this enough, I really, really can't - you're some of the best I've ever had on this site. I feel privileged just hearing what you guys have to say. It was reading through some reviews which eventually forced me into action to start writing this next chapter. So thank you very much to everyone who has reviewed up to this point, and those faithful. I can never express my gratitude. During the hiatus, I ended up starting and finishing a story on here and I've got to say that not even those reviews could rival everyone's here. Thank you so, so much. Now, since it's been such a long time, this might require you to read back a bit just to remember where things are headed. In fact, I might even recommend it. But otherwise, events are steadily moving along and I promise myself and everyone else not to leave this story gone for so long. Hope you enjoy. Chapter 11 - Kind Killings \"Dad's not coming back, is he?\" Abby's mother clutched her cigarette tighter in between her thin, bony fingers and ventured a dead glance at her daughter. \"No Abby, I'm afraid he's not.\" Nodding, Abby glanced out the window, hoping the bus would appear. For the past six years, she had asked her mother the same question. Every year, she was given the same answer. Moments after the question was asked seemed to laze on like a summer afternoon. Only, they weren't enjoyable. Abby knew without meaning to, that she opened up the same wound her mother worked so desperately to keep closed each year. And she was left feeling a mix of guilt, pity, and grief. But this year was different. She'd began analyzing the things she'd done with her dad as a 10 year old; wondering why such privacy was needed or where indeed her father had gotten his props. \"Dad killed people, didn't he?\" It was out of Abby's mouth before she had time to think about saying it. But at least it was out in the open and not bouncing around in her mind like a horde of irritable wasps. Abby's mother studied her daughter quietly before answering. \"Yes, he did. But you musn't look down on him. They weren't really people.\" This shifted Abby's interest, but her mother shook her head as if she'd accidentally spilled a long guarded secret. Her lips pursed and after a moment, she turned toward the window. \"Bus is here.\" Abby understood a dismissal and with one last lingering glance, left the house. APHAPHAPHAPH Abby's eyes sprinted open, glancing at the unfamiliar ceiling above. Momentarily, her dream was discarded for confusion. Why is the ceiling higher? \"Your vasovagal syncope is partly my fault.\" Jumping at the sudden voice, Abby's head rolled over to observe Heiter sitting beside the bed. She didn't quite understand his words because of shock. Shock being from finding her gaze shifting behind the man, to a window. Did he recently get that installed? A dull thumping in the back of her head forced her comprehension to slow down. \"I knew you'd eventually see my reasoning,\" she mumbled with a smile, eyes pasted to the window. From her vantage point, she could see the intense vibrance of green grass and a lagoon blue sky dipping into the ground. Sure, the metaphors might have been a bit exaggerated, but it was the first time she'd seen the outside in a very long time. Such blissful metaphors were welcomed. Heiter didn't reply and Abby turned to stare back at him, inquisitive about his silence. And that was when she noticed a picture behind him. It was much like the symmetrical one representing two children she had noticed upon first entering his home, except the object of the painter's obsession was a human hand. In between each finger, the artist had sliced a murderous, black line. It's intent had been to cause distress and disorder, or so Abby imagined because it certainly didn't bring any uplifting feelings to her. And then it dawned on her. Bolting up in the bed, Abby's eyes hastily took everything in. The new room was far larger than the old cubicle one she'd been confined to. Besides the window and painting, a desk chair rested beside a neatly polished, mahogany desk. It's price had to have ranged in the thousands alone. While still white, the walls seemed less inclined to depress her. Maybe because the light bounced off them, causing a strange luminance to filter through? Swallowing her shock, Abby trailed a finger over her abdomen. Still wrapped tightly around her was the towel she'd fainted in and thankfully, she'd kept it glued to her form. \"You do realize,\" Abby noted, studying the wide open door, \"I could escape at any moment. Call the police and send you to prison.\" Her eyes settled on his form and for a second, his lips remained in a firm, thin line. \"Yes, you could do that,\" he answered. \"You could have also informed the police of who you were.\" Abby's tension spread underneath the muscles in her back, keeping them taut and alert. But when Heiter only stared back at her, Abby slowly eased her trepidation. \"So...what are the rules then? I don't want to wake up to the sight of a gun aimed at me again,\" she noted. \"And I am taking a shower again, whether you're there with me or not.\" Heiter yet again stayed silent, but she could sense the concentration rumbling inside him. Even though it was swallowed down, shock still resonated within her. How had their relationship changed so drastically in just a few minutes? Maybe by covering for him, I showed him trust. Certainly doesn't seem like the type of man who gets it a lot...well, from people other than his patients. \"You may go anywhere in this house, but you must first inform me of where you are headed to.\" Wanting to argue, Abby bit back all defensive words as she noted the strain in Heiter's features. While he may trust her a bit, they certainly weren't at the point of demands. \"If I want to go outside?\" \"I will accompany you.\" Nodding, Abby glanced up at the ceiling once more. \"Why are you still keeping me prisoner if you're allowing me to wander around?\" she questioned. \"Would you rather I put you back in the old room?\" A harsh shake of the head was his reply. \"But I can run away now,\" she argued. \"You can try.\" Abby kept her body numb as a flinch passed through. \"But why am I still here?\" she asked in slight frustration. \"You're basically allowing me freedom inside this house. Why not outside?\" \"When you are ready to venture back to your life, I will let you. For now, your place is here.\" The staring couldn't continue at the statement. With a swift glance, Abby raised a curious eyebrow. \"What do you mean by 'when I'm ready'?\" \"You wish to figure out the mystery of your father's whereabouts. Once that is completed, you are free to go.\" \"But-.\" She cut herself off, however, when no words came to her. \"A part of me is hesitant,\" Heiter admitted, \"about letting you go. Despite your clever replies to the police, you can just as easily tell them of my practices once I allow you to leave. So you will be free, but monitored within reason. Just as well, I have found myself becoming truly interested in your father's proceedings. You know as well as I, you were not going anywhere based on the assumptions you sought. I can provide you with information or contacts you need.\" \"I-.\" \"Not an inch of you will rest until you figure out what happened to him. If you do not face your curious obsession now, it will only consume you later in life. I am the best chance you have at finding out what you need to know.\" \"I don't trust you to help me out of the goodness of your heart,\" Abby finally answered, studying the doctor carefully. \"And you are right in not doing so. Then again, perhaps I am feeling the slightest discontent for my actions.\" Now, Abby was all ears. She forced her mouth to move, but no words came. \"D-do you feel remorse for your actions?\" \"You may call it what you wish. Aiding you in your investigation offers a slight release from this discontent.\" \"What an odd way to release your guilt. By helping the victim you originally planned to perform an unethical surgery on.\" \"Would you rather I search for victims with your blood type?\" For some reason, Abby tilted her head and grinned. \"That's not what I meant. It just seems like a German thing to do.\" \"And it would be American of you to say yes.\" \"We're not all that easily persuaded,\" Abby argued. \"Having said this, I do accept your intentions. Although, there is one thing I'd like to stop.\" Heiter's silence was her cue to continue. \"The three questions thing. Great thought, but I think it irritates us both to have to limit ourselves from knowledge.\" \"An interesting way to put it.\" \"I'm going to assume that's German for yes.\" \"Never assume.\" And back we are to being a grump. Ah well. At least you're a grump who's going to help me. This thought allowed Abby to fully comprehend the extent of his words. Instead of blindly stumbling in a direction she believed relevant, Abby would have a decently intelligent person assist her. No matter that the same man originally intended for her mouth to be connected to another woman's ass. Nope. No matter at all. Shivering, Abby broke her gaze from the room and moved slowly to her feet. A faint dizziness spiraled around. \"My vasovagal syncope,\" she muttered, stilling herself. \"How's it your fault?\" \"Prior to your stay here, your blood pressure and heart were quite healthy. Certain circumstances here have put you in a position of constant fainting.\" Mulling over the words, Abby studied her feet. \"Like intense stress?\" she offered. \"Or my opium intake. Sudden onset of extreme emotions. I know my mom would take something for that. Trauma. Lack of sleep. Nerve malfunction. No wonder you're feeling guilt.\" \"That is not the term I wish to use,\" he quipped, his stare harsh. \"Okay. Discontent. I'm guessing that's another reason you're going to let me walk around. To get my blood pressure back to normal.\" \"Yes.\" \"Good. I think I'm starting to put on some pounds.\" The doctor rolled his eyes. \"Right,\" she shrugged. \"So...what about clothes? I'd really, really enjoy having something to wear other than a hospital gown.\" For a moment, the doctor seemed indecisive. \"Most of the clothes I've burned.\" Sighing, Abby rubbed at her forehead. \"Well...do you have any clothes? Sweats or shirts too large on you? I know you didn't throw out any of my underwear or bras so I'll just rewash those. Might have to get more pretty soon though.\" An awkwardness seeped into Heiter's features and this time, Abby felt it as well. Wearing my potential killer's clothes? Smooth, Abby. Real smooth. Then again, her option was a hospital gown or a towel. Her eyes brightened momentarily. \"You know I need clothes,\" Abby offered. \"But I suppose I could always walk around naked.\" This put the man into motion. With a strict glare, he raised his hand in a sign of order. Stay. \"I'm not a pup-.\" But he had fled before she could offer up a rebuttal. Studying the room again, Abby couldn't help but feel the vibrancy of the area seep into her. The lights, the color, the scenery. She hadn't even realized what stuffing a person in a windowless room for two months, could do to their psyche. And this is my room. For now. As soon as I figure out what happened to my father, I'm getting the hell out of here. This was fact. Yes, Heiter was being incredibly trusting of her and she thanked him dearly for it. Where once she was his victim, now she was like a partner of sorts. But this freedom he allowed her didn't displace the facts. He had a severe case of antisocial personality disorder or most likely, was a sociopath. Or at least showed signs of being one. No sympathy for anyone else. Didn't recognize the rights of others. Incapacity for love (based off his awkwardness each time she provoked him sexually and lack of compassion). Authoritative. Complete control over his victims. Secretive. Conventional appearance. And perhaps the grandest display was his emotional urge to justify his actions in order for her to trust in him. Most likely, that's where his sudden need to help me is coming from. Whatever \"discontent\" he's feeling, only will be quenched when I accept his methods. For the time being, Abby was fine with following this strange partnership they'd developed. She'd attempt to dislodge any lost memories stolen in the thick fog of time. If they proved to be important, she'd voice them and hopefully her 'curious obsession' would be discovered. Soon. It wasn't just her wish to leaveGermany. It was her wish to figure out the mystery once and for all. To figure out her heritage and why her father abandoned their family. I'll pursue this for as long as it takes. And Abby briefly wondered if the complete devotion she had to those words, was healthy. APHAPHAPHAPH \"Oh, baby. I've been missing you for soooo long.\" A clearing of the throat interrupted Abby's proclamation. With lit emerald eyes, she turned toward her former captor. With a triumphant grin, she lifted up the brewed coffee. \"My college days were only possible because of this sweet delicacy.\" \"Rots your teeth,\" he muttered. \"And water can easily carry Rohipnol,\" she mentioned, narrowing her eyes at him pointedly. The doctor didn't answer, but he gestured her to sit at the table. \"The address marked on the back of the postcard. What was it?\" Sipping from her mug, Abby paused for a moment. Complete disbelief overran her once more as she realized just exactly what she was doing. Chatting over coffee with a probable serial killer. How utterly strange. \"Could I have a pen and paper?\" Abby questioned softly. Within seconds, both items were in front of her. Biting down on her lip, Abby closed her eyes as the pencil tip dented down on the paper. With a calm inhale, her eyes blasted open and her hand rapidly sped over the white parchment. When she was sure the address was correct, Abby slid it back to Heiter. His eyes fell over the paper, reading it over a few times. Then, he met her gaze. His face revealed no emotions and that in itself caused her to grip on to her coffee cup. \"This house,\" he explained, glancing at the paper once more, \"is only 15 miles away from mine.\" Feeling her eyebrows rise, Abby straightened in her seat. \"So I was close,\" she finished, surprising stirring inside her. \"Really, really close. I probably would have made it to the house if I hadn't given up and asked for a ride. Tell me, what do you know about this guy?\" \"I have not taken the time to get to know those living around me,\" Heiter hinted. \"But this man is one I've met on two occasions. He lacks intelligence, but not initiative. He designed and helped build his home.\" \"He's good at developing plans,\" Abby surmised. \"What else?\" \"I cannot recall. He rarely discussed his work, but I believe he has business in the city.\" \"Okay. He's a traveler. What's his name?\" Heiter thought for a moment, his eyes running over the paper. \"Steffan Mahnkompf.\" Abby shook her head just to make sure she'd heard right. \"Steffan Manhkompf?\" she repeated. That's the name of the man my father talked to on the phone. The one he was meeting in Berlin. But...what are the chances this is the same Steffan? \"You recognize the name,\" Heiter noted. \"I think I do. I think this man met my father in Berlin. Otherwise, it's too big of a coincidence for my father to have written down the address of a man named Steffan.\" Both were silent for a moment and Abby reveled in the information learned. Why did you write down his address, dad? You wanted the address found, but you didn't want others to detect it. Hell, you might have even put the blood stain on the postcard on purpose, just so I'd have to go investigate the strange mark in a lab. \"I want to meet him,\" Abby announced, suddenly not in the mood for coffee. \"I cannot guarantee he is at his home.\" \"Please, could you find out?\" Nodding, Heiter ventured to the nearest telephone and lifted a book near it. Abby guessed it held phone numbers. What if this guy killed my dad? Or knows who killed him? Or maybe my dad is alive and Steffan knows where he is. Heiter's voice broke through her pondering and for a few still minutes, she listened to him speak. She caught bits of phrases in German, but wasn't in the mood for deciphering them. \"He is at his home,\" Heiter confirmed, setting the telephone down. \"He has agreed to come over. I did not mention you.\" \"Better that way,\" she agreed. \"The last thing we want is for him to know I'm here.\" \"What do you plan on doing once he is here?\" Frowning, Abby met Heiter's gaze. \"What would you do if you were in my situation?\" The doctor seemed surprised at the question, but he thought over the question regardless. \"Make a list of all the questions you want answered. Do not let him leave without getting them.\" \"Do I detect a hint of a threat there?\" \"You did ask.\" Abby nodded. \"So I did. I don't think I'll go to quite extreme lengths, but it wouldn't hurt to question him. Gently. No one likes being accused of anything.\" Heiter remained silent, so Abby moved to her feet and stretched her limbs. One of his white t-shirt covered her and her bottoms were black sweatpants. Abby had been initially shocked to discover that he owned something so casual, but then she attributed the oddity to his physical appearance. A man had to have worked out periodically to keep his appearance. Wearing the clothes was odd in itself, but she believed it was personally more awkward for Heiter. A victim in HIS clothes. It was utter blasphemy! This thought made her grin and Abby took a short moment to pride herself in finding the creepiest things amusing. Otherwise, she'd have been dead long ago. \"Well, I'll just be heading off to bed,\" she decided, fighting back the remainder of the chill coffee. \"I need to rest for tomorrow.\" Outside, the sun had retreated behind the trees, springing forth the last shadows before night firmly took a hold. God, I missed seeing this. \"I will wake you before Steffan begins his journey here,\" Heiter offered, studying her movements. \"Good,\" she yawned. \"And thank you. I appreciate this.\" Damn it, I'm not a beauty pageant queen, thanking her sponsors! He. Is. Mad. Why can't I get that through my head? But perhaps he reminded her of her father in certain ways. His cold mannerisms or glee toward his practice. Let me think about this some other time. So with a tired wave, Abby passed her former captor and retreated into her new room. Tomorrow had the potential to be a very important day. Let me know your thoughts in a review! Confrontation with the mysterious Steffan is coming up next.[Chapter 12] Alright, one review. I expected nothing less with the hiatus I was on. Thank you, Angel. Your thoughts really helped me move along forward. And so here we are next and I hope you enjoy reading. Chapter 12 - Little Labyrintha Waking up to the sight of autumn trees swaying outside her window caused Abby to momentarily assume everything that had occurred within the past two months, was nothing but a strange, ugly dream. For a moment, she was able to drink in the sun creeping up over the horizon and send its glorious rays in between the thick tree trunks. It was like a breath of life from the morning, kissing the beautiful lips of nature. Of course reality set in when Abby's eyes strayed over to the cruel painting with the thick, black strokes slicing in between each finger of a hand. The one that had made her uneasy the day before. Without having a keen sense of her actions, Abby hopped out of bed and ventured over to the painting. She studied it for a while, attempting to feel anything other than a dismal hope. Unfortunately, no other emotion could top it. So, with a soft grunt, she stood on her tiptoes and lifted the painting off its nail. Surprisingly, the piece was lighter than expected. As if the force of the subject matter would add weight on to the finished product. Eventually, Abby settled on lying it face up atop a nearby desk. That way, it would not be one of the first objects she'd see in the morning. \"The painting dissatisfies you?\" Jumping at the voice, Abby turned to find Heiter standing at the open door. She guessed he'd kept it open all night to ensure she wouldn't escape. \"Well...,\" Abby mused, studying the sharply dressed man, \"that's not exactly it. By nature, I'm a social person. Ask any exboyfriend or old friends from school. So seeing this painting, while I understand its imposing nature, has done nothing to help me embrace my situation.\" The doctor frowned. \"Did you study art?\" he finally asked. Surprised, the auburn haired girl crossed her arms and thought over the art history course she'd taken in college. \"Most notably, the popular artists. DaVinci, Van Gogh, O'Keefe, Picasso, Salvador. My favorites are the Starry Night dual paintings by Van Gogh. Something inside me stirs at the drawings. Like if I reached out my hand or stared at them long enough, I'd be right inside. Those are the most spectacular paintings for me. The ones so beautifully realistic that you could jump inside and run away for a short time, from the problems occurring in your life.\" \"Running away does not solve everything,\" he noted. Her lips upturned for a moment, green eyes fixed on the man. \"Neither does surrounding yourself with loneliness.\" Heiter immediately shifted the intensity of his stare, but something softened in the gaze. \"Steffan will be here in an hour. He understands I am to talk with him about building another home.\" The moment passed, but again, Abby noted there was some sort of invisible significance in it. What it was, she had yet to discover. \"Alright. Just let me take a quick shower and I'll be ready,\" she answered, glancing toward her bathroom. Which by the way, was fully equipped with a shower! \"Wait...I have something for you.\" Abby didn't comprehend the words at first on account of the metaphorical fist slamming into her stomach. For thirty seconds straight, her lips moved open and then closed like a startled fish. \"I'm dreaming,\" she told him, watching in sudden apprehension as he pulled out a black bag. \"I probably died sometime during the night and in the afterlife; you're paying in karma by buying me gifts. Oh the irony.\" \"Had I known you could not handle it, I would have never done this,\" Heiter commented. Slowly, he placed the plastic, black bag down and lifted out the items inside. \"You went shopping!\" Abby exclaimed, helpless to stop the laugh from spilling out her throat. Indeed, in Heiter's hand laid a pair of blue jeans and a white, long sleeved shirt with Berlin written in slanted, sparkly black letters. Her feet carried her over to the man, eyes pasted to the articles of clothing. \"There are more shirts inside, and pants.\" Shaking her head, Abby glanced up at Heiter in a mixture of disbelief and confusion. \"You didn't have to.\" But even before Heiter said a word, Abby's mind kicked itself into action. He doesn't like me wearing his clothes. And without the doctor having a proper reply, Abby knew this to be true. \"Thank you,\" she opted for instead. \"How much did all of this cost?\" \"Why does that matter?\" he asked, almost defensively. \"So I can pay you back. I'm not in the business of letting people buy things for me. It's cheap. How much was it all?\" Heiter seemed perplexed at her statement. His eyes fell into a squint, as if he was attempting to figure out what sort of specimen was conversing with him. \"Consider it a peace offering.\" \"Even peace has a price. Do you really want me to start playing the guessing game?\" she threatened. She felt like she was five years old again, arguing with a neighbor boy about where the clouds in the sky came from. \"Three-hundred and eighty-one euros.\" Abby repeated the number in her head, striving to remember how strong the U.S. dollar was. In euro terms, that was a lot. But once it transferred into American dollars, she'd finally gain the true extent of it. \"Has the U.S. dollar gotten weaker or stronger since my captivity?\" Picking up the now empty bag (she'd emptied all of the clothes out), Heiter observed her quietly. She couldn't tell if he was pondering her question or not. \"Take your shower.\" Then, he spun around and exited the room. How in the hell is he able to make me feel like a child at 22 years old? Grumbling, Abby glanced over the clothes Heiter had picked out and silently gave the man a tip of the hat. But the prices had all been torn off, and an uncomfortable weight settled in the pit of her stomach just at wondering how much Heiter had spent on the clothes. She didn't like feeling like she owed people. It wasn't until she was under a steady stream of hot water, rubbing shampoo through her hair, that Abby completely stilled. The calculations were running through her head non-stop and she got the approximate amount down. He spent $500 on me. APHAPHAPHAPH She stayed silent upon reaching the kitchen, regarding his shopping spree. The thought of him shopping for clothes, unnerved her, especially since the clothes fit perfectly. In fact, the blue jeans gave her long legs a curvaceous shape she'd never had before. Heiter of course would never consider the differences between skinny, bootleg, boyfriend, or curvy jeans. Luckily, she didn't have to worry about that kind of stuff with him. Bless his asexuality. However, Abby didn't want to come off ungrateful. The doctor really, really, really did not have to spend his money to accommodate her needs. The reality of it was almost kind of...comforting? Or maybe puzzlement mixed in with relief at having something familiar on. \"I set your clothes on my bed. Wasn't sure where you wanted them,\" Abby mentioned, studying his form leaning over the oven top. If that doesn't sound like I had sex with him, I don't know what does. Shaking off the eerie thought, Abby glanced past his silent form and into the small window above the sink. The once radiant sun had long ago retreated behind a gang of ash clouds. I don't even know what month it is. Jesus. Or what date. What happened in the world. What winter temperature in Germany is like. Heiter turned toward her, eggs completed in a frying pan. \"You appear in thought,\" he observed. Surprised, she gave a slow nod. \"What day is it? Or month?\" \"14th of November.\" Abby couldn't hold back her shock this time. She knew she'd been vacant from the world for awhile, but actually hearing the date was far different than imagining the time that had passed. I left to find the man on the back of the postcard - Steffan - on the 3rd of September. She didn't send out any more distressing signals toward the doctor, but continued to marvel at the reality of it. Thank God I paid in advance for a six month stay at my hotel. My hotel! In a month, the staff will clear my room out. Including money and passport. I'd be stuck in Germany. \"Relax,\" came Heiter's calm suggestion. \"You are physically exhausting yourself with your thoughts. Relax for a moment and eat.\" Nodding, Abby shuffled to the table and slid down into a chair. She didn't think much about the eggs she was eating or the fact it was the first time she'd eaten at his kitchen table or even her eventual eviction. Instead, she focused on her breaths. Easy, slow, even, and calm. This method eventually subdued the familiar dizziness threatening to surface. A few times, the corner of her eyes began to softly blacken. But, Abby fought back by keeping her body relaxed. When she was sure another fainting spell wasn't going to occur, Abby glanced up at Heiter. He'd been watching her cautiously the entire time. \"Did you go early this morning to Berlin?\" \"No. Last night after I made sure you were sleeping.\" Oh my god. I was alone for an entire night? She met his eyes and witnessed her thoughts reflected. \"I locked all doors and windows.\" \"Good,\" she answered nonchalantly. \"It's not like I was planning to escape or something.\" The doctor fixed her with a tired stare, but Abby knew he found some sort of humor in her statement. Otherwise, he'd scowl. Come to think of it, she was getting rather good at reading his gestures. If not the good ones, then most certainly the bad. \"Do you have questions to ask Steffan?\" Heiter said. \"Not yet. I need to know first if it is him. There's a mentality a person can force themselves into where they've convince themselves of something because they want it to be true. I'd hate it to be that kind of situation.\" \"I do not think you would allow yourself to do this,\" he admitted. \"Regardless...I have to see. Maybe I'll mention my dad's name right away. Maybe I won't. But I need you to make him feel comfortable. Maybe...put a little Rohipnol in his water?\" The doctor scowled and Abby grinned at his annoyance. Strangely, her first day of freedom inside the house, was going rather smoothly. No yelling, fighting, or killing of any kind...yet. Just as she stood with her plate and Heiter extended his hand to grab it, the doorbell rang shrilly throughout the house. Both occupants shared a long look with each other before Heiter dropped his hand. Abby indicated for him to go with two of her fingers marching over an invisible floor. Only when the bell rang again did he finally exit the room. Abby placed her empty plate in the sink and slowly took in a few breaths. I shouldn't be nervous for this. I experimented with dead bodies of serial killers at age 10. Okay...maybe experiment isn't the right word. It's too closely associated with my captor. But I've been around the gruesome stuff and dad showed me the ins and outs of people and their emotions. We'll just see what happens. Tugging up her sleeves, Abby glanced at a nearby mirror on the opposite side of the kitchen. Her reddish brown hair had grown out nearly an inch and a half. This changed her appearance, giving her face a rounder structure. Damn. It's amazing how fast this change took place. Physical and mental. That was her last thought before she followed the voices conversing in the den area. APHAPHAPHAPH \"So you are an American student interested in medicine?\" Abby nodded. Although relieved that Steffan could speak English, which she assumed he could, understanding his words was not the easiest thing in the world. His r's were nearly nonexistent in his accent and the strength he put in the vowels, made the question sound far more menacing than it actuall was. But she was a master of disguise. And despite his sloppy accent, she determined his words within thirty seconds. \"Yes,\" Abby agreed. \"I was visiting the Hamboldt University of Berlin, fascinated by the study of stem cells. It's a bit of a hot topic in my country right now. Morality and ethics of the practice. Someone from the university recommended I speak with a Dr. Josef Heiter about the surgical procedures regarding such an operation. Of course Dr. Heiter's specialty lies more in the biological field rather than cellular diversification, but I was still able to learn new things.\" \"Any particular reason you pick Germany?\" You. The reason I'm here is because of you. The reason I got picked up by Jenny and Lindsey is because of you. Youyouyouyouyouyouyouyou-. \"I was also actually trying to track down an original copy of Freud's Interpretation of Dreams . The 1899 edition was printed in German and I'd heard a rumor that the university carried it.\" She slowly watched the man's attention diverge. Once topics got analytical or for that matter, intelligent, Steffan decided to step out. \"Never got the copy,\" Abby mentioned. \"But I'm glad I came here- That one took a lot of confidence and courage to say. \"-because Dr. Heiter's home is magnificent.\" Immediately, Steffan was reeled back in. For a short while, she listened to them discuss houses and famous architectures. She couldn't determine whether Heiter was generally interested in the conversation, or speaking to build trust. Probably a bit of both. Regardless, for a man who did not like human beings, she was impressed at the naturalness at which he spoke. It made her briefly wonder if a part of him still resided inside from his surgeon days. He'd had to have interacted with his patients and parents of the patients. Most of them might even consider him their hero for the work he'd done. Now that was a hell of a thought. An entire half hour soared by before Steffan glanced back at Abby with an apologetic shake of the head. \"Could I get you water?\" Heiter asked. Abby forcefully kept her gaze down, afraid she'd laugh if meeting Heiter's features. To spike with Rohipnol, or not to spike with Rohipnol? That is the question. \"That'd be excellent. I only have beer in my refrigerator. The tap tastes like rust.\" The doctor shuffled out of the room shortly after. \"So your name is Emilie? I must say, it is beautiful.\" Abby blushed appropriately, studying the man under her lashes. In years, she considered him a few younger than her dad. His shoulders were wide and this leanness extended down to his stomach. Bright, blue eyes scanned the room every now and brown hair in the process of graying, slept like a lion upon his head. Only creases in his eyes and wrinkles besides his mouth, indicated him to be in his mid-40's. Steffan suddenly laughed, leaning back on the couch with a grin. \"What?\" Abby asked, well humoredly. Shaking his head, Steffan mumbled, \"Reminded me of someone for a moment.\" Abby's heart nearly convulsed. \"In what way?\" She made sure to add the slight disbelief in her question. That way, it didn't sound overly suspicious. \"The way you watch me. It reminds me of-.\" But the man abruptly cut himself off, his grin disappearing like a star when the sun rises. Coughing uncomfortably, Steffan's eyes traveled behind her, anxious for his drink. \"My real name isn't Emilie,\" Abby began. Briefly, she wondered if this was the time. Then again, she nearly died trying to find the man. Staying mute was not an option. \"Oh?\" he questioned, humor bouncing into his smile. \"What is your name?\" \"Abby. My dad used to call me Labyrintha.\" For a moment, confusion was petrified onto Steffan's features. As if he'd remembered something and couldn't for the life of him, figure out its origins. \"His name was Gregory Post. And about 12 years ago, he went to Berlin to meet a man named Steffan. Unfortunately, my dad never returned and he led my mom into depression and an eventual drug overdose. As for me...well, I constantly wonder if I'm like him. I seek approval in the men I date because I feel like I never got the proper version of it while my dad was in the picture. And to be honest, you and I would never be having this conversation if not for something quite peculiar. Just as I believed my dad to be dead, a postcard came to my attention. This being before my mom's death, about six months after he left us. It was in our belongings after she passed. The postcard carried a blood stain on it and ever so curious in my intentions, I took the postcard into a labratory to determine the nature of the stain. Do you want to know what I found?\" Steffan was having difficulty breathing and keeping his eyes on her. It was as if someone was slowly sucking out the oxygen in the room. \"What?\" he managed to gasp out. \"Your address, Steffan. Written in invisible ink. Quite simple to make, actually. And with the intense heat of the lights coming down on to the postcard, the message revealed itself. So...here I am. I've followed the postcard, and you don't even want to begin to know what the hell I've been through to get here. All I want to know is information about my father. Surely you can do that for me, can't you?\" Her last question came out softly, even though the rest of her words were more of a rant. \"I-I-.\" But the man could not get a proper word out. \"Steffan,\" she tried again, \"please. You don't know how horrible it is, constantly wondering if he's dead or not. Or worse, if he's alive. Wondering why he stayed away for so long.\" He glanced her over once more, truly taking everything in. \"I knew I'd seen those eyes before,\" he breathed out. \"Where? When?\" Hesitantly, Steffan studied the room cautiously. \"Anyone else here?\" \"Just Heiter and I,\" Abby promised, leaning forward. \"I cannot.\" \"Steffan, please.\" \"You do not understand the secrecy I am sworn too.\" \"This is my father!\" Abby nearly yelled, bouncing to her feet. \"I watched his disappearance slowly eat my mother away. I tried to deny none of it bothered me, but truth be told, if I'd had the option to follow her path, I would have. The only reason I didn't is because I had hope. Hope that he was still alive somewhere. And this fucking postcard proves my fucking point! Please, Steffan. Please, tell me something.\" The man took a long sigh, his eyes scattering around the room. Neither registered the silence coming from the entire house. \"You are really Abby Post, daughter of Gregory?\" \"Yes,\" she expressed, trying to keep her tone level. \"He talked about you often. Back when I saw him.\" \"He met you in Berlin?\" she gathered. \"Yes.\" \"Why?\" \"I cannot say.\" With a frustrated groan, Abby fell to the couch. \"But,\" Steffan mentioned, \"he was in my presence for a month. We explored Berlin, shopped, ate. He bought gifts to take back for you.\" \"Did he trust you?\" \"Not at first. But we worked into a slow friendship.\" \"I heard you had some dirt on him. That was one of the reasons he flew to Germany to meet you.\" Steffan studied her intensely, shaking his head every so often. \"How did you come to know this information?\" \"Does it matter?\" \"Well...yes. Your father's disappearance is not a matter to be taken lightly. When he left one day without telling me where, I understood him to be in trouble.\" \"Trouble?\" \"My fault. This \"dirt\" I had on him was-.\" \"-about him killing serial killers?\" He paused, rubbing at his sweaty palms. \"He had hoped you'd never find out.\" \"Then he severely underestimated everything he taught me. Now...why do you say he was in trouble?\" \"Others knew about this.\" \"You just went around, telling random people that my dad killed serial killers?\" \"No. It was not like that. These people approached me one day, curious about your dad. In fact, they knew before I had a chance to lie. They had proof.\" \"Just like that, these people found you, ready to talk about my father?\" The man stayed silent for a minute. Pondering over the information, Abby took it in from a different angle. \"Okay, so you won't tell me why you came to Berlin. But, I'll try to figure this out. Let's say you found out about my dad somehow. Whether these friends of yours had already told you or not, I can't say. Having this information could ruin his life and send him to prison, maybe even to death row. So, you research this man and know that despite his middle class home, he's quite wealthy. That's when you think to blackmail him. You've got dirt on this man and a few extra bucks won't hurt.\" She stopped, waiting for a reaction. \"The blackmail was my idea,\" he finally stated. Reeling in her shock, Abby nodded. \"But,\" Steffan interrupted swiftly, \"I did not carry through with it. He had a beautiful home with a beautiful family. He helped take truly horrible people out of this world. For this month, I enjoyed Gregory's company as opposed to destroying it. This is why him leaving worried me. I believe those people who knew about him, had something to do with this.\" \"Like what?\" \"I do not know. They were aware of his status, but I don't think they wished to blackmail him. He spoke with them often, but did not repeat anything to me. After a month, he simply vanished. I never heard from him ever again.\" \"How did you know he contacted them?\" Steffan mumbled something underneath his breath. \"What?\" \"Sarah Kappel. If you find this woman, she will help explain the rest.\" With that, the man stood uncertainly. \"I am very sorry for contacting your father,\" he declared, eyes focused on her. \"I would have never done so had I known what kind of man he was or the trouble he would become mixed up in. His disappearance is my fault as are the problems I have burdened you and your mother with. I recognize this and only wish your forgiveness one day.\" \"Wait,\" Abby urged, seeing him ready to bolt, \"I think you're afraid of saying the rest. I think you know who these people my dad went with are. I think you know just as much as Sarah Kappel does. If you've told me this much already, why not say the rest?\" Steffan sighed, clenching his weak fingers. \"My guilt outweighs my courage at this moment.\" He turned to look at her. \"But perhaps...if you wish to stop by tomorrow morning, I can be of more help. By then, I hope I will be ready to do the right thing and tell you everything. But know this...I am unaware of what happened to your father. And him leaving my address on the back of a postcard indicates he trusted me far more than I trusted myself. So please, come over tomorrow. With your friend as well. He has been listening in the kitchen for some time. Now, I must depart.\" Before she could throw in a word, the man fled to the front hallway. Soon after, the slam of the door met her ears. APHAPHAPHAPH By the time Abby spoke again, four hours later, Heiter was making dinner. They'd both skipped lunch, and Abby wouldn't have eaten it anyway. What kind of trouble did you get mixed in with, dad? The blackmail wasn't so surprising, but she couldn't for the life of her figure out how Steffan found out. Maybe he's lying about finding out on his own. Maybe these mysterious people who approached him, knew already. Put the idea in his head so he'd lure my dad here. But that sounded like some ultra-complex Tom Clancy novel. What was the possibility that Steffan was merely a pawn in the scheme? That the real people who wanted to meet her dad, were the same ones behind his disappearance? Steffan hadn't elaborated on how many or who these people were, but apparently he believed the name Sarah Kappel would help. \"I wish to know your thoughts.\" For the first time, Abby refrained from finding his words amusing. They were both sitting at the kitchen table. He'd just set her plate down, but all she could do was stare at it. \"This whole thing doesn't make sense,\" Abby admitted. \"My dad leaving with what I assume to be the same people who told Steffan about my dad's profession. Why wouldn't these people just take the blackmail route like Steffan originally planned? The postcard was dated six months after he didn't come home. That gives me the information that he was alive for that long of a time and intended for either my mother or I to find out what happened to him...maybe ease our minds? He trusted Steffan to say the truth and believed he'd be gone for a long period of time. But did he even know how confusing his involvement was with all this?\" She looked up at Heiter. \"How about you? What do you think?\" Setting his fork down, Heiter rubbed at the table with a thumb. \"Steffan is not intelligent enough to have a motive other than blackmail. If he was involved with others, he was not made aware of their plans. But I do think he has an idea on what these people might have wanted. If he gave out a name to you. Sarah Kappel.\" \"I hope he wasn't cheating on my mom.\" Heiter didn't reply. \"Ugh!\" she cried, head clinking down on the table. \"The closer I get to figuring out what happened, the more frustrating it gets.\" \"Self-abuse does not help.\" Rolling her eyes, Abby glanced up. \"Neither does destroying doors. I remember how angry you were when I hid myself in that room. I can't believe I find it funny now.\" The doctor pressed a hand over his mouth, eyes studying her. \"I was not angry.\" \"Bullshit,\" she laughed. \"Unless banging against doors until they split open, is a German greeting, I'm pretty sure you're lying.\" He looked away, but the corner of one lip tugged up in a silent admission. \"We should go see him now,\" Abby proclaimed. \"I think he was ready to give us the information this morning, but talked himself out of it. If we're in his house, a safe haven for him, he may be more attuned to really explain what happened and what exactly my dad was involved with.\" \"You are sure?\" \"Yes. Steffan might lose motivation tomorrow. He seems like a very weak willed man to me.\" \"Eat. Then we will go.\" \"Yes, Hitler,\" Abby mumbled, pulling the plate toward me. \"It's Heiter,\" he warned. \"That's what I said,\" she innocently replied, smiling at his glare. APHAPHAPHAPH \"How long have you had your new car?\" she asked, remembering she was the reason behind the disappearance of the first. \"It has been in the garage in case I needed it.\" Nodding, Abby's eyes scurried around the area. \"Don't you ever listen to music in here?\" Heiter shrugged from behind the wheel. \"I do not find the need for it.\" They'd been on the road for not even five minutes before Abby began peeking around for a CD case. The silence inside the vehicle only got heavier the more nervous Abby got about seeing Steffan again. The last thing she wanted to be when facing the man was nervous. Around them, the November sky was a murky black, night rapidly descending at only six in the evening. \"Mind if I turn on the radio, then?\" The doctor turned to her, eyes unreadable in the dark. \"Fine.\" Abby reached out and flipped through the stations. Unsurprisingly, most were German based. Talk shows, news, interviews. The man's radio stations included the works. Finally, she was able to reach a station that played old rock n roll tunes in English. Currently, 'Pinball Wizard' by the Who was ending its last notes. The music worked its magic and eased away the tension Abby felt at meeting Steffan again. Such big of a mystery, so little answers. Did you go willingly with these people, dad? Did they threaten you? Threaten to expose you? Her fierce thinking was interrupted by the disk jockey's smooth voice seeping into every inch of the car. \"Never forget, the Bee Gees are proud members of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. This next one is for all you lovers out there. Stay happy.\" Closing her eyes, Abby's cheeks began to burn as 'How Deep is Your Love' flowed through the speakers. \"I know your eyes in the morning sun. I feel you touching me in the pouring rain. And the moment that you wander far from me, I wanna feel you in my arms again. And you come to me on a summer breeze. Keep me warm in your love and softly leave. And it's me you need to show-.\" The sheer sexuality of the song caused Abby to throw a few quick glances at Heiter. She loved the song personally, but it definitely took the award for being played during one of the most inappropriate moments in history. Heiter glanced at her just as the chorus ended. \"I believe in you. You know the door to my very soul. You're the light in my deepest darkest hour. You're my savior when I fall. And you may not think I care for you when you know down inside, I really do. And it's me you need to show.\" His gaze dropped, but she felt the same tension from him. \"How deep is your love? I really need to learn. Cause we're living in a world of fools, breaking us down. When they all should let us be. We belong to you and me.\" Despite the manner of the lyrics, Abby found herself grinning. \"I love that song,\" she mentioned just as the Bee Gees faded away. Her eyes met his once more. \"How about you?\" She knew a part of her just wanted to see him cringe, but then there was another side that was interested in his interpretation of it. \"It is a good song,\" he agreed. Surprisingly, no mockery or sarcasm slumbered in his voice. It was genuine. Knowing she should shut up, Abby firmly pressed her lips together. But this didn't stop her thoughts from falling out. \"When I meet new people, the first song we listen together to, becomes our song. For example, my exboyfriend Frankie and I first listened to Freebird by Lynyrd Skynyrd together. That became our song. Another exboyfriend, Travis, happened to have Gin and Juice by Snoop Dogg playing. Even though the moments were never appropriate, that became our song. And I've got a girlfriend from high school. First song we ever listened to together was Toxic by Britney Spears. Some things you'd just like to forget. Nevertheless, it was our song.\" \"What does this mean?\" he questioned, not quite understanding. \"It means,\" Abby explained with another laugh, \"no matter how awkward that was listening to, this is our song.\" Heiter shot her a disbelieving glance, but stayed silent on the matter. One of the most romantic songs of all time happens to be the anthem of a complete madman and myself. Splendid. But the amusement about the situation far overrode any panic or disgust. APHAPHAPHAPH The tall, two story house loomed over the winding pathway leading to it. It appeared Victorian in its entirety, thrown in with a few Ottoman type architecture. Mostly all a mahogany brown, the glass windows were like eyes into the mysterious structure. \"It's beautiful,\" Abby marveled as Heiter threw the car into park. Although the entire place appeared dark, Abby guessed this was one of those houses that had secret passageways or storage areas invisible to prying eyes from the outside world. Fighting off her shakes, she slowly opened the door and breathed in deeply with the strong wind blowing into her. On the other side of the car, Heiter stepped out, locking the vehicle. Together, the two journeyed forward, feet crunching over the rocky path. The night air was chill and Abby wished she'd have asked for a jacket. But that meant he'd have to give her something of his and if that really made him uncomfortable enough to buy her new clothes, she wasn't going to ask. No need to run up her debt. \"Wait,\" she expressed, hand mindlessly reaching for his arm. Heiter paused when she wrapped her fingers around his wrist. Turning to him, Abby gestured with her head, toward the door. It was partly slid open. They turned to each other once more, having a silent conversation with just their facial expressions. \"I'll go first.\" Before he could stop her, Abby stalked forward determinedly. Her eyes picked out nothing out of the ordinary while climbing the steps and just before opening the door further, she observed the handle as well as the entryway. \"Doesn't appear like its forced entry,\" she mumbled to the man beside her. \"No broken locks or damage to the wood here.\" She refrained from touching the entry, and instead, peeked at the oppressive darkness inside the house. \"Steffan?\" Heiter called from outside the door. Neither was surprised with the lack of response. \"Car is gone,\" Abby mentioned, meeting Heiter's fixed gaze. \"Think he left?\" \"One way to find out,\" he replied. Nodding, she gently eased open the door with one hand. The light from behind them certainly didn't help illuminate much of the front hallway. Quietly, Abby stepped inside the home. It held a woodsy scent, as if the building had been completed only recently as opposed to more than a decade ago. She ventured forward as Heiter entered behind, eyes scanning the darkness. \"Is there a light switch anywhere?\" she whispered through the thick black. Just as her next foot came down, the weight underneath it grew slippery. With an oof, Abby flailed her arms, but could do nothing as she collapsed down on to her butt. \"Abby?\" came Heiter's voice from somewhere above. \"Yeah,\" Abby answered, surprised the man used her name. \"I'm fine. Just slipped in-.\" Her hands felt alongside her curiously. \"I found the switch,\" he voiced from a few feet away. Abby nodded into the darkness, fingers rubbing into the liquid she'd slipped in. Whatever it was, there was a lot of it. With a sudden blast, the lights flickered on. Glancing down, Abby's heart nearly stopped. \"Blood,\" she immediately said, keeping back her panic. \"I slipped in blood.\" The red liquid successfully ruined her jeans, smeared into the fabric from knee to ankle. She gathered her butt area held some as well, as did her coated, scarlet fingers. She glanced up at Heiter's wide stare. He offered one hand, and Abby carefully wrapped both of hers around it, lifting her weight off the slippery pool. As soon as she was on her feet, she glanced down. The puddle had been large, but led away into another hallway. \"C'mon,\" she gestured, ignoring her bloodied clothes for the time being. They followed the splatters of blood on the wooden floor, careful not to turn a corner too carefully lest they lost their trail. The very trail seemed to lead along the lines of a chase. Short little drips would patter the floor, then bigger, fat drops. Whatever had occurred happened in the front hallway. That's where the biggest amount of it was. But someone winded it through the house. The trail abruptly stopped in front of a closed doorway, but a handprint outlined the doorknob. Suddenly, Heiter fumbled around behind him. She watched the movements carefully, until finally, he pulled out a metallic gun. \"Always carry that around with you?\" Abby asked in slight amusement. \"I was hesitant to let you see I had it.\" \"Just as long as you don't use it against me,\" she answered, glancing back to the door. With a final inhale, Abby wrapped her palm around the door and pushed it open. It took a few moments to comprehend just exactly what she was observing on the bed. \"Is that-?\" she gasped. Heiter's silence answered her. Lying grotesquely on the bed in a pool of his own blood, with three bullet wounds in the back, was Steffan Manhkompf . Really enjoyed writing that chapter. Hopefully you enjoyed reading. And...check out How Deep is Your Love by the Bee Gees. It's a 70's classic and I had a huge grin on my face, writing the scene in the car when the song played. The awkwardness and hilarity of the situation was only something that could happen to Abby. Let me know your thoughts in a review.[Chapter 13] Thank you very much for the reviews. They help INCREDIBLY. Honestly, you don't even know how much they mean until you start writing. Thank you, thank you, thank you! Anywho, I've had two of my reviewers wonder about my absence and the future of this story. So...I want to make this clear because I hadn't earlier. I WILL complete this story. No matter how long it takes (I'm trying to get at least two chapters up a week), or how bad they are, I will get this finished. Because I've had the end of this story made up since the idea first began in the summary. I'm one of those people who can't write unless they already have an ending (susceptible to change, of course). But know this...I will finish it. Hopefully that doesn't discourage you to stop checking your mail for a new chapter. And on we go, since the plot kind of thickened. Don't ever rule out anything and I hope you enjoy as things start picking up! Chapter 13 - Mundane Murder They rode back to the house in a brutal silence. Several times, Abby urged her lips to open just so she'd say something. Anything regarding what they'd seen. But Heiter's promise of everything being handled, silenced all protesting thoughts. Currently, she rode without jeans, shoes or socks. While once this would have made her meek and embarrassed, now it was necessary. Her blood stained clothes could easily leave behind traces in the vehicle or on the cobblestone outside. There could be no chances taken as to their appearance at the home. \"I will call my acquaintances,\" Heiter had promised, referring to the same men who'd made sure Lindsey and Jenny hadn't said anything. Surprisingly, it was one of those rare moments where the man actually was trying to calm her anxiety, probably due to her fainting spells most likely. Abby wasn't normally one to panic, but seeing her only source to discovering what happened to her father, lay in a mangled pool of his own blood with three bullet holes through the torso, seemed to sprout a touch of unease within her. Steffan said he was sworn to secrecy. What if whoever it was he was sworn to secrecy to, found out about him meeting me? But no...that doesn't make sense. If they were aware of that, then they'd have found out Heiter's home was the center of the meeting. They'd have given him a visit as well. Closing her eyes, Abby pressed a tired hand over her eyes and let out a timid sigh. \"According to body temperature and the texture of the blood, Steffan had been dead sometime between two to four hours. Within an hour of returning from your home,\" Abby mumbled, rehearsing the facts while they were still fresh. \"The significant blood loss inside the home indicates that his guest was invited in and was in fact, someone Steffan personally knew. After the shot was fired, Steffan had to have been able to knock his assailant over. Otherwise, he would have never made it through his home. Following the blood stain pattern, Steffan began to lose control of his footing sometime between the den and his bedroom. Once inside the bedroom, I cannot determine what he considered doing. However, his murderer entered shortly after and managed to permanently silence the man. Perhaps Steffan was trying to retrieve a secret weapon within his mattress. Damn it, I should have checked there.\" The last words came out an aggressive mutter, but already, Abby's panic was disappearing. It always did when the facts became less obsolete and the truth revealed itself. When she glanced over, Abby found Heiter studying her. He seemed just as puzzled at her outburst as she felt toward Steffan's murder. \"Courtesy of my dad,\" she expressed with a humorless smile. \"I theorize when a body is presented.\" \"Your age deceits your intelligence.\" Now it was Abby's turn to study him in surprise. She wasn't sure if he was just trying to make her feel better - an anomaly of its own - or if he genuinely believed his words. Whatever the reasoning was, Abby's mind forced itself back into action. \"What are your friends going to do?\" The doctor no longer cringed at the term. \"Disposing the body and cleansing the area. If they decide to dust, your fingerprints will be everywhere.\" Abby's eyes squinted, searching for his hands. \"Were you wearing the gloves the entire time?\" she questioned, angry she hadn't thought of doing so herself. But it wasn't like she was expecting to find a dead body either. \"I wear them only when entering a home not my own,\" the doctor mentioned. He didn't elaborate, but Abby, on a roll, attempted to find the reasoning behind the method. \"Just in case you decide to kill them,\" she surmised. Heiter didn't answer. \"Okay. So your friends are going to clean up the mess. But we've still got to determine why he was murdered.\" \"Your thoughts?\" Pausing, Abby mused over her assumptions. Then, at the neutral tone Heiter had developed. He seemed just as removed as she felt. In fact, on normal circumstances, neither of them should have reacted to the dead body the way they did. He with casual indifference and she with morbid curiosity. In some aspects, they were the perfect crime fighting duo. I can't become as cold as him. If I lose my compassion for the victim, who knows what kind of person I'll end up as? Well, actually, she had the answer to that. He was sitting mere feet away from her. \"I think someone knows I'm in Germany,\" she stated, more sure of the statement now. \"Someone Steffan was nervous about.\" \"They do not know your location,\" Heiter added. \"Or you would be dead as well.\" \"But I know how they might have discovered it.\" This time, her nervousness piqued. For a short moment, she threw a few glances at the doctor, unsure what his reaction would be to the request. He'd been so intent on keeping a firm hold on her that a sudden loss of power may very well mean her death. But she also remembered his words. Her fascination with the mystery of her father would only grow the longer it remained unsolved. Surely, he'd understand that? \"I have to go back to Berlin. To get my passport, money, and anything else I left in my hotel room,\" Abby said, keeping her voice confident and stern. Just as she imagined, Heiter didn't reply right away. \"If you don't take me, I will find a way there. Even if I have to crawl,\" she threatened. \"I am not opposed to the idea.\" \"Really?\" The second look he threw her, gave away the answer. \"Tonight?\" \"Yes,\" Heiter agreed. \"Gather everything you have. We leave shortly after.\" Abby nodded while her thoughts spun around in a whirlwind. Once Steffan's death had been absorbed, the next awe came from Heiter's attitude. The man wasn't just being helpful. He was being...kind? Was that even possible? Why am I thinking about the madman when I should be picking out the reason Steffan was murdered? Abruptly, Abby's mind sank back into the complex events of the entire day. It was time to reexamine everything and figure out why the only man with information regarding her father's disappearance, lay murdered in his bed. APHAPHAPHAPH The entire task of collecting her items went swiftly. Nearly everything she owned were clothes. Heiter had burned all of her possessions, but re-payed somewhat by the clothes she now wore. A new pair of jeans had quickly been tugged over her freezing legs as soon as she'd entered the home. After she was done, Abby watched the man stroll from room to room to make sure everything was tidy. Not because of some winter cleaning fetish, but because he didn't want her traced back to him. At least that's the way she thought of it. Which wasn't a bad thought. It hopefully meant this would be one of the last times she ever saw the place again. But it also depicted his commitment to her in a way. If indeed people were searching for her, Heiter was allowing his safety to be jeopardized by traveling and continuing to help. She knew she shouldn't think of it in such a generous way, but the longer she did, the less it seemed to matter. However, it was seeing the doctor take in his paintings longingly that finally did it. \"You don't have to help me,\" she blurted. \"The last person who did, ended up murdered. Just drop me off at the Berlin Inn and let me continue the search alone. It's not worth it to you...especially if you die.\" To her befuddlement, Heiter shook his head. \"I am involved in this mystery as well as you. I also have the resources.\" Crossing her arms with her bag of clothes clenched between two fingers, Abby lifted a brow. \"Are you sure? Last chance.\" The man hardly blinked. \"Yes.\" Within minutes, Heiter had made his phone call and the two were back inside the vehicle, cruising into the night. As Abby glanced back at the hellish home from in between the trees, she did something she hadn't done in a very long time. She prayed. Prayed that this would be the final time she was ever inside, near, or on the premises of Heiter's home. APHAPHAPHAPH When 30 minutes had passed by and Abby was ready to fall into a restless sleep, she felt a gentle nudge on her shoulder. Turning, Abby accepted the slip of paper Heiter handed over and wiped at her bleary eyes to gain a better look. The car light turned on as her eyes scanned over the scribbled writing. \"Sarah Kappel,\" she read, curious eyes turning to Heiter. \"When you stepped out of the home after seeing the body, I looked around the man's room. This was stuffed into his desk drawer. He dated the note at the bottom.\" Observing the scribbles again, Abby successfully picked out not only the current date, but squinted at what was written underneath her name. \"Do...do you think he knew they'd come for him?\" she questioned. \"I do not know.\" Beneath Sarah Kappel's name was a number. Abby recognized the separated digits as an area code, followed by the customary phone number in the country. And beneath that was an address. \"Neuruppin. How far north is that?\" \"An hour. Perhaps tomorrow we shall take the trip?\" \"Fantastic idea. If you hadn't found this, we'd just be stuck with the woman's name.\" \"You should sleep. I will wake you once we are at the hotel.\" For a moment, the auburn haired girl pondered over how to ask the next question. \"I don't like expecting you to provide me food and shelter,\" Abby admitted. \"So when we get to Berlin and check in - somewhere isolated, I imagine - I'm paying for the stay and for the food.\" \"Unless you have false identification, you will not do that,\" Heiter argued. \"If you are indeed wanted, they will look for your credit card to be used. You may not enjoy it, but you will stay under my name.\" Only the thought of her dad prevented Abby from disagreeing. \"Fine. But don't be angry when your money runs out. I'm a high class lady.\" She could practically feel Heiter's eye roll. \"I have enough money for you, I am sure,\" he responded. The soft hum of the vehicle rushing through the thick, black night eventually lulled Abby into a tense sleep. APHAPHAPHAPH She was still in dream land when Heiter's voice broke through her subconscious. \"Are we here?\" she mumbled with a raspy voice. \"Yes.\" The bright lights of the city blinked through the glass windows, blinding the girl enough to close her eyes for a few moments. \"My room number is 245,\" Abby informed. \"You should find my passport and other belongings by my bedside. Ignore the papers I have scattered across the floor. They're nothing but print outs I had when first attempting to decipher Steffan's location. Insignificant now.\" They had both agreed sometime during the trip that he would be the one to enter her room. If she was being tracked, information would be leaked to the person doing the tracking. Then, her location would be known and she'd be in a deep pile of trouble. \"Get any spare clothes I have. God damn...it's been so long, I can't even remember what I left in there. If you suspect that I might want it, bring it. That goes for the underwear as well.\" His brown eyes found hers in the dark and she couldn't help but grin at the slightly exasperated look falling over his face. \"Good luck,\" she offered. \"And try not to imagine the people inside as your future experiments.\" That comment earned her a glare. But again, because something had shifted between them, the glare had lost its maliciousness. What it was replaced with instead, Abby couldn't quite pin point. The doctor turned to the Berlin Inn and ripped out the car keys. \"Stay,\" he ordered. Too tired to deny his request, Abby only raised an arm in response. Sometime between the time he departed and the time her hand switched on the radio, Abby's eyes slammed shut. Her pulse bounced like a basketball underneath her skin. All of the stress of the day was successfully seeping into her, ready to usher in another journey to the familiar darkness. I'm going to run Heiter over with his own car if this fainting becomes a chronic event. And back into the darkness she went. Lol...how many times have I ended a chapter with Abby fainting? But hey - the man has put her through a lot and now with what's going down, she has proper reason to not be able to control herself. Also, if you thought Abby got over Steffan's death a bit too easily, I just want to note that she really didn't know the man too well, and because she'd been around stiffs so often as a child, the prospect of death no longer really frightens her. Also, she wasn't there for the murder, unlike the German man Heiter had killed beside her in his basement. Because Abby was able to witness the murder and understand the guy's life and realize he had family, made him more real to her, and easier to sympathize for. But she was also concerned about her reaction to Steffan's death. She's afraid that if she continued to react in such a manner, she'll end up like Heiter. Well...let me know your thoughts in a review![Chapter 14] Thank you for the reviews, as always. I love hearing your reactions to whatever you find interesting. I would have never imagined any reviews, to be honest, when I first began writing this. Again, a heartfelt thank you for everything everyone's said to keep me writing this long. If you haven't noticed, each chapter are two words from the alphabet. So approximately 26 chapters I'm going to do. Maybe with the exception of X, Y, and Z. Depends if I come up with anything for them. So, onwards we go! Chapter 14 - Never Needed The night of Steffan's murder passed by in black and white glimpses. For example, Abby remembered falling asleep after Heiter had left to get her things, but she didn't remember him coming back. Minutes or hours later, she awoke to find both of them on the outskirts of Berlin. The city lights gathered in one big pile a few miles away. \"Where are we?\" she managed to mumble, only half coherent. \"Somewhere undetectable for now.\" It took a full three minutes for the words to make sense in Abby's mind. \"I'll just sleep in the car.\" More darkness entered her soon after. She had no true sense of time. Snarly dreams found their way to her, morphing into nightmares whenever guilt sprouted up at not having done enough. Abby wasn't sure what exactly she was apologizing for. Her dad's disappearance? Steffan's murder? Or maybe the German man she had made a duty to forget because his senseless death saddened her far more than she was used to? But through this murky land of thorns, bright light did seep in. The next time her eyes opened, it was to greet the morning. The only difference was her surroundings. Definitely not inside of a car. Instead, she slumbered in a bed with thick, wool covers warming her chill form. Wisely, Abby blinked a few times, getting used to the sudden brightness. Once her eyesight adjusted, she observed three rectangular windows facing her. Through their transparency, she could see the skyscrapers of Berlin and hear the traffic noises blasting away the nearby birds. Stretching her arms high above, Abby hopped off of the King sized bed. The room, nothing especially extraordinary, was large. Larger than any of the bedrooms inside Heiter's home. In fact, Abby felt a ridiculous urge to see if the walls would echo the sound of her voice. \"San Francisco,\" she declared, voice breaking through the thick sleepiness in her throat. Just barely, Abby heard the same vibrations mimic her back. With an accomplished grin, the girl's eyes fell to a nearby desk. More importantly, what sat on it. \"Thank God,\" she muttered, sprinting to the bag. Inside laid her passport, her wallet, various hygiene products, and about a weeks worth of clothes. Often, the days blended together inside the hotel. Jeans and shirts would be reworn and whatever she was done wearing, would be thrown into the washing machine on her floor. Sometimes she'd be so focused on whatever she'd been studying, the clothes in the washing machine would be picked up days later. Glancing around the room, Abby caught the sight of a door leading into a bathroom. I could be stranded in Antarctica for all I care. Just as long as there's a shower. APHAPHAPHAPH A black tank top slipped over her form, one she hadn't worn in a ridiculously long time due to a certain man's fetish for terrorizing people. Not that she was naming any names. Old, torn blue jeans wrapped loosely around her and with the shower, Abby felt like the world's cleanest woman. When voices met her ears, she ran a final hand through wet locks, shaking the strands loose. Then, she edged open the door and slipped into the carpeted hallway. Only a few steps were taken before she noticed Heiter's form in a makeshift kitchen. \"Hi,\" she greeted somewhat awkwardly, remembering he had carried her from the car and into the bed. Nothing says trust between two individuals like tucking someone into bed. \"Abby,\" he responded neutrally. \"There are three men I would like you to meet.\" Nodding, she watched his eyes slowly fall over her form. There was a minute of prolonged silence. \"Am I wearing the wrong clothes?\" she asked, fighting back the urge to cover up the skin showing. The heat from the shower shot up her body temperature. The doctor shook his head and gestured her to follow. In the den stood just as he'd described - three men side by side. \"This is Rudolf.\" The first man in the line, stepped forward. He had thin, brown hair and a walrus sized mustache giving his appearance that of a jolly man. Only his ice blue eyes deceived him from having a comforting presence. Just glancing at the man's eyes told Abby he'd often been on the wrong side of the law and had no problems being there. \"Abby Post,\" she introduced, shaking the man's firm grip. Rudolf didn't say anything, but he offered her a nod. \"His partner in the law department, Jakob,\" Heiter mentioned. The second man stepped forth as well. Perhaps not even a full year younger than Rudolf, Jakob's blonde's wavy hair ended in wisps and the depression lines on his face indicated the stress of his job. His scrawniness didn't help either. \"Josef performed on my lovely daughters,\" Jakob informed, his grey-blue eyes a fraction kinder than Rudolf's. It was seeing the appreciation there which really blew Abby away. Because of Heiter's actions, Jakob's daughters were alive. This would be a great Twilight Zone episode. Both men spoke through thick accents, but Abby had no trouble detecting their meaning. So much of Heiter's complicated wording taught her to figure out the complex German accent. Once the men had both stepped back, Heiter introduced the final person. He too was male, but about half the age of either men. Forest green eyes and black, shaggy brown hair with sideburns were a part of the man's features. The lop sided smile eased tensions in the room as well. \"This is Klaus. He studied medicine in the University of Berlin and is now a psychiatrist.\" Puzzled, Abby offered a hand and relaxed when Klaus shook it. He looked right at her and the lack of malice in his gaze was something quite relieving considering the other three men were masters of the stare. \"I understand Rudolf and Jakob's presence, but why Klaus?\" Abby questioned, turning toward Heiter. Before the doctor could explain, Klaus spoke up. In a very clear English, minus the g's and h's. \"I am aware of your grave situation thanks to Jakob.\" Jakob didn't say anything about the acknowledgement, so Klaus continued on. \"Mrs. Kappel is one of my patients. I hand deliver her medication. If you are not myself, a gardener, a family member, or security, you will not be allowed on the premises.\" \"You're going to help us get on the property?\" Abby said, filing in the blanks. \"Yes.\" \"That's really nice of you. But do you mind me asking...why?\" The other men had been paying careful attention to their conversation. All eyes were on Klaus to respond. \"I lost my father at a young age,\" he admitted. \"He lived in East Germany during communist rule. One night, the packaging company he worked for recruited a group of men to take a business trip to what was the Soviet Union at the time. Claimed it was a retreat for a few days. That was the last time I saw him.\" Eyes wide, Abby's brows knitted together. \"Did you ever find out what happened to him?\" Klaus bit at his lip, the first signs of anger blasting through his eyes. But quickly, it faded. \"I did find out, but not for a hell of a long time. Not until communism fell and some of the KGB's records became public. Apparently, one worker at my father's company was a Western sympathizer with ideas to spread democracy in the communist East. The government couldn't determine who, so they took everyone that worked on my father's floor. He was wrongfully tortured before the real man became apprehended. Because my father survived with the knowledge of what occurred, he was killed to prevent publication of his story.\" Abby kept back any urge to feed him her sympathy. She was in the presence of people who scowered for such weaknesses. But, she did reach out a hand. And to her relief, Klaus took a firm hold of it. \"I appreciate you having the guts to help me,\" she thanked in her own way. \"It's hell, not knowing. This opportunity blindsided me, but if I can prevent another person from going through the terror I did, it would be well worth it.\" Their enclosed hands stayed together an entire minute before being interrupted by a clearing of the throat. \"Now, Miss Post. You and I must have a chat,\" Rudolf expressed. \"In private.\" Abby glanced at Heiter, but the man nodded his head in affirmation. \"If I scream for help,\" she mentioned just as she passed the doctor, \"you better get your German ass in there.\" A reluctant lifting of the lips was her only reply. APHAPHAPHAPH \"I just wish to ask you general questions regarding your father,\" the man began. \"Such as?\" Rudolf brought his hands together and gave a big bellied sigh. \"You heard the name Steffan as a child. Any other information you can think of?\" \"No.\" \"You sound sure.\" \"I've had twelve years to think over the time spent with my father. I assure you, anything I've said, Heiter is aware of.\" This time, Rudolf's steel gaze softened in confusion. \"Are...you two-?\" Widening her eyes, Abby quickly shook her head. \"Not in a million years.\" \"I did not think so,\" Rudolf inferred. \"He is an emotionless man. You must imagine my surprise when he calls me to ask about a serial killer from the USA. Then, days later, to clean up a murder before the police can tie you to it. And now, he is sheltering you from harm. I would have never thought this to be the same Josef months ago.\" Hesitating, Abby's gaze fell to her shoes. She felt an uncomfortable prickling in the pit of her stomach from Rudolf's words. \"This may sound cold, but my only focus at this point is finding out what happened to my dad,\" she admitted, pulling at her fingers. \"And anytime I feel guilty for thinking that way, I realize Heiter could have killed me numerous times. He's also the reason for a man's death and three people's near unethical treatment. A part of me, as sick and disturbed as it is, will forever be thankful. If Heiter hadn't come along, I would still be wandering around a forest, searching for Steffan's address. But I've got to consider what's happened as well.\" Rudolf nodded, hands parting. \"It is wise to think this way.\" Those were his only words on that matter and Abby didn't wish for him to elaborate. \"Josef has informed me your father was blackmailed by Steffan Mahnkompf. And you believe Steffan was informed of your father's identity by an independent group?\" \"Does that sound too outrageous?\" \"Not if we find a motive.\" For the next half hour, the two scanned over the known information. Initially, Abby felt nervous about discussing such personal facts with a stranger. But, Heiter had more or less explained everything to Rudolf and their talking was nothing more than attempting to see the possibilities at every angle. While indifferent, Rudolf was a talented detective. His mind analyzed as opposed to simply working for the hell of it. He offered more point of views along with a sordid history of disappearances. Abby wasn't sure what Rudolf's intentions were. The man couldn't have been helping her just out of the goodness of his heart. But she forced this unease away when they mutually agreed on a decision. \"I'll give you money to get some,\" she promised. \"Josef has agreed to-.\" \"No,\" Abby denied. \"If he pays for one more thing, I'll feed him to a pack of wolves.\" Rudolf's entire expression shifted into fascinated amusement. \"What?\" she muttered. \"The man will be back with his family.\" The detective's lips parted, ready to say something, but at the last moment, he held back. Instead, a frown settled itself. And his frown ignited a question within her that Abby immediately had long ago wanted the answer for. \"You're the reason Jenny, Lindsey, and for lack of a name, I'll call the Japanese man, haven't gone to the authorities. How did you do it?\" A sigh made Rudolf's mustache flutter. His eyes, shining only minutes ago, hardened. \"If you killed-.\" \"We would not be so rash. No, it was easier than that. Deportation.\" Surprised, Abby raised an eyebrow. \"You just deported them?\" \"Rather simple,\" Rudolf explained. \"Once they came in to the station, I made sure to be the one who took their statements. I noted in my report, their claims to be unsound, and ordered them to all undergo a night's stay at a hospital. While there, another report was written stating each patient to have an illegal amount of drugs and alcohol in their systems. The report went through and back to their countries they went.\" Shaking her head, Abby blinked rapidly. \"So if they ever tried telling their story-.\" \"No one would believe them,\" Rudolf finished. \"And due to their \"known\" drug use, it would be difficult to enter the country again.\" Abby was speechless. \"Well, shit. You guys are really good.\" \"Yes,\" the man agreed, \"we are.\" APHAPHAPHAPH When Abby and Rudolf exited the room, they only found Heiter standing there. \"Klaus is testifying on a case for Jakob,\" Rudolf informed her. \"He is not due to Mrs. Kappel's home until tomorrow. You can wait one more night, Josef?\" \"Yes. This is okay with you?\" Feeling his stare reach her, Abby nodded. So, Rudolf ushered himself to the front doorway. Just before he was out of the house and right as Heiter turned away, Abby slipped the detective fifteen euros. \"Pick something I'd like,\" she whispered with a smile. Unsure if the detective's nod was an answer, Abby watched the man depart to his vehicle with a contained hope. Then, she slammed shut the door and exhaled. Heiter stood at the end of the entryway, observing her curiously. \"Have any thoughts of your situation?\" \"Rudolf,\" she began, taking a step forward, \"believes they found out I was in Berlin by accident...sort of.\" At Heiter's puzzled expression, Abby continued. \"Just like you have friends in the justice department and the law department, so does this mysterious person or persons. They'd have to if information about my father was given out. Rudolf and I both believe Steffan was approached by more than one person with the information about my dad. Now, when I first came here, I hadn't planned on staying long. A month or two, at most. And although I did eventually end up paying for a six month stay, my travel visa expired sometime during my captivity. Germany will extend expired visas and put you on a holding list, so that's where my name went. Unfortunately, the hotel is informed of this and has an obligation to give my name to the justice department, just in case I try fleeing or permanently taking refuge in the country. Rudolf believes this is how they found out I was in Berlin. Tell me...when you went inside my room, did you find anything out of the ordinary? Like something had been shuffled through?\" The doctor paused for a moment, absorbing the great tide of information. \"Your passport was open on a table. Your wallet open as well, but nothing taken.\" Although Abby had been gone for two months, she knew she wouldn't be stupid enough to leave her information for everyone to see. She'd have kept it in a secret location. \"They look at the passport and it confirms my identity,\" she relayed. \"Look at my driver's license which gives away my state and address, and they know exactly who I am. Realizing I'm an unforeseen complication, they sever off the weakest link. Steffan. They knew he'd talk because he never carried through with the blackmail. Question is...have they silenced Sarah Kappel up as well?\" \"Klaus called the woman while you were with Rudolf. She is fine and he is notifying her of the visit scheduled for tomorrow.\" \"What's wrong with her?\" Abby asked, genuinely curious about who they were dealing with. \"Neurological damage common of schizophrenic patients. She acts out every now and then if medicine is not taken. She is aware we are coming as well. My name still has relevance in this country. Klaus explained I would see if any major surgery could be performed to fix the epilepsy slowly becoming more common.\" \"What else do you know about her?\" \"Perhaps in her mid-40's. Lives with her husband, Ivan. His investments into East Germany's economy immediately after the fall of the Wall, paid off when the two sides reunited. Once the unified economy expanded, Ivan became a very rich man. No children. No previous crime records for either. They prefer the privacy, and their home has been gated for years. Ivan is on a business trip in Prague, or so Klaus has informed.\" \"I wonder why Steffan thought she could help us. If the woman is a bit gone mentally, what's to stop her from telling us the wrong information...if she gives us any at all?\" \"All things I have wondered about myself,\" Heiter admitted. \"But without her, there are no other options.\" Sighing, Abby nodded. She glanced around the room, wondering what to do with herself. Prolonged thinking about the facts would only make her more anxious. Luckily, it was her stomach that spoke up. \"You have not eaten,\" Heiter noted. \"I can make something.\" She didn't reply for a moment. \"Why don't we go out? Maybe some fast food.\" The man visibly blanched, but she wasn't sure if it was toward the unhealthiness factor or the prospect of being in a social setting. \"What you made me was good. Hell, probably the most healthy I've eaten in a long time. But, I'm afraid I'll start pooping out potatoes at this rate. A nice hamburger and fries really would do the trick,\" she offered. He still seemed hesitant. \"It'll be fun,\" she promised. \"I'll talk to the drive thru window in a funny voice and they'll think I'm mentally diseased!\" \"Well...if your voice did not do the deed, your face certainly would.\" Abby's mouth charged open, but Heiter only shrugged. However, he wouldn't meet her eyes and edge of his lips twitched a bit at her expression. \"You are such a bastard,\" she laughed out. \"I would feel worse if you did not make it so easy.\" Rolling her eyes, Abby nodded in an awed defeat. APHAPHAPHAPH The journey to McDonald's was actually enjoyable. Which is saying something considering the man beside her had nearly murdered her on more than one occasion. She knew this was very uncommon. To share this type of bond with a captor. But as she'd discussed with Rudolf - it was her continued understanding of what he did to her that prevented Abby from forming an attachment to him. She did not remain so disillusioned to the gruesome facts. Still, she had an irritating trait of seeing the best in people. And Heiter, while completely bonkers at times, almost passed for a \"human being\" on the way to Berlin and back. The man had pushed her away when she attempted to creep over his seated form and yell in a half French, half Russian accent about wanting her French fries as crunchy as a human finger. She could barely contain her laughter when the man who worked the drive thru, asked her to repeat her order while Heiter barely held back his curses. Once her food had been taken care of, they drove back in a comfortable silence. His vehicle reeked of salted fries and cooked hamburgers. She assumed him to be a health nut, but she did catch the few glances he'd thrown at her noisy fry devouring. \"Based on your hungry gaze at my French fries, I'm guessing you don't go out to eat often,\" she observed as the last major skyscraper passed by. \"I prefer to keep to myself,\" he defended. \"Because you don't like human beings,\" she finished. \"Doesn't that ever get lonely?\" Surprised, Heiter tightened his grip on the steering wheel for a second. \"No.\" But Abby didn't believe it for one moment. And the reason why was because he fixed a direct stare on to her while saying the word. As if his voice was saying no, but his eyes were disagreeing. Of course she could not exactly determine this. His eyes were unreadable, as they always were. Why would he make sure to meet my eyes after saying that? \"Excuse me for asking, but have you ever been married? Or in a serious relationship?\" The silence following her question was excruciatingly long. Multiple times, she believed he decided wasn't going to answer. So, the green scenery passing by was her only sanctuary for asking such a personal question. \"Foolishly I believed a woman would bring me joy,\" he suddenly said, his voice low and just barely detectable. \"Nearly a decade ago, I was going to have a wife.\" Keeping her hands clenched to prevent a finger from straying to a French fry, Abby carefully observed Heiter out of the corner of her eye. His admission stunned her. Whether it was toward the fact that he had once almost been happy or normal, she wasn't quite sure. But she did know that their conversation had steered in completely foreign waters. And while she felt nervous about him suddenly losing it, curiosity piqued just as prominently about his backstory. She knew without a doubt that since his engagement a decade ago, this was the first time Heiter had decided speaking about it. Just in the timid tone of voice and sudden anxiety he displayed, informed her of this. \"What happened?\" she asked gently. \"Another man.\" Squinting, Abby met Heiter's forceful gaze directly. She didn't say anything, just merely stared back. \"The man told me about it before she did.\" Widening her eyes, Abby looked back at the road. \"You called the wedding off?\" \"Of course,\" he replied swiftly, and with a fair amount of hate. \"The whore was carrying his child.\" APHAPHAPHAPH Neither said a word when he stopped the vehicle. His words and decision to open up for a moment had long ago vanished. But that didn't mean she had dislodged his words. A part of her reasoned out this betrayal at not just toward women, but toward humans in general. Someone he had thought loved him, cheated and ended up carrying another man's child. There was no easy way to forget that kind of pain. Of course his personality did not develop with just this single event. She guessed he had felt inferior in many ways during his life. Becoming a surgeon wasn't just a decision to help people. It ultimately made him God in a way. He wielded the decision to keep a person alive. Most likely, that's what intoxicated him. All along, he had probably been antisocial. But with enough events such as his fiancé cheating on him (that sounded just as weird in her head), he could have steadily descended into an apathetic state where only his own survival and needs were important. Is it possible he's not actually mad? Just kind of got screwed over by life? Whatever the answer was, she didn't deny that he had a breakdown somewhere along the way. With the accumulation of his malice and distrust for everyone, it was no surprise for his tendencies to become merciless. Others had deceived and looted his trust. What should prevent him from doing the same? This realization and sympathy of sort made Heiter much more realistic in her eyes. Knowing that he'd once been susceptible to the type of pain everyone has gone through. \"You will not speak a word of this to anyone,\" he threatened as she exited the car. \"I don't have a death wish,\" she promised solemnly. \"And I'm sorry that happened. I've never really cared enough about my former boyfriend's to be upset when I found out they cheated.\" His dangerous expression shifted into something different. \"This has happened to you numerous times?\" he questioned. \"Well…yeah. You open your heart and you can't always guarantee to get it back in one piece. But that hasn't prevented me from searching. Although, I'm kind of a weirdo. So whoever this lucky guy is, he'll have to have one hell of an open mind. I mean, I don't even understand my actions half the time.\" The man studied her curiously, but did not say anything else. So, the two ventured back into the house. APHAPHAPHAPH Rudolf returned to the house sometime around five o'clock. Prior to that, Abby had either stayed in bed and pondered over the importance of meeting Sarah Kappel, or re-read Catch-22. She was happily surprised to have found the small, paperback edition stuffed in between two pairs of jeans and wanted to thank the doctor for bringing it with him. But, the man had been doing his own reading and due to the nature of their conversation, realized this was for her benefit. When the bell rang and Abby heard Heiter call for her, she realized with a sudden excitement, that things were going to change. Sort of. And this change excited her...if it turned out right. APHAPHAPHAPH Two hours later and Abby stared at herself in the mirror with a stupid grin. Rudolf's purchase sat discarded in the trash, and a pair of scissors lay haphazardly upon the sink. \"Are you finished?\" Heiter called from behind the door, irritation firmly set in his voice. Neither she nor Rudolf allowed the man to see what was bought and she could clearly note the man's annoyance. \"Hold on, Kim Kardashian,\" she yelled back. Shaking her head, Abby ran her hands through her hair. Having it stop just below her shoulders was a surprise, as was the new, thick bangs protruding from her forehead. But the trait that made her unrecognizable was the formerly auburn brown being transformed into a platinum blonde. Her green eyes soaked in the brightness and adjusted her face to appear not only European, but suave. Like she'd done it at a salon for $400. During her conversation with Rudolf, they'd hypothesized the chances of whoever killed Steffan, also knowing what she looked like. So, she volunteered to alter her features. And now that she did, Abby was incredibly pleased with the result. Not that she didn't love her natural fiery brown. Instead, it was like chopping off and painting away a part of her life she didn't quite care to go back to. So, as casually as she could, Abby grabbed the bathroom door handle and swung it open. The shock on Heiter's face was priceless. \"Awesome, no?\" she asked, swinging her hair back and forth. Heiter only continued to stare. In fact, he remained speechless for so long Abby formed the urge to slap him. \"I'm glad I'm an independent enough woman to love what I do with myself. Otherwise, your silence would be rather insulting,\" she expressed. \"It is different.\" \"Unrecognizable?\" \"Yes.\" Nodding, Abby crossed her arms and blew upward. Her bangs bobbled in mid-air for a moment before retreating to cover her forehead. \"That's what we're going for. I might have to change my personality a bit as well. Steffan noted the similarity between my dad and I just in the time we were alone. Whether Sarah met him or not, I don't want to risk her kicking us out before we have a chance to talk with her.\" \"I will make sure that does not happen,\" he promised, still studying her. \"Just don't pull out a gun. I'm depending on Klaus to make sure she's in the right mind,\" Abby warned. His answer was interrupted by the shrill tone of a telephone ringing. He raced to it, and Abby followed behind. For a moment, she watched him listen as his brow furrowed. The entire time, he did not say one word, but his nods indicated the information to be important. Finally, after three or so minutes of nodding, he hung up. \"What happened?\" she asked, hands gripping on to the counter. Heiter glanced at her once before speaking. \"Sarah Kappel committed suicide.\" Let me know your thoughts in a review![Chapter 15] Thank you for your reviews! Amazing inspiration! I just kind of wanted to mention this - don't think Heiter's gotten soft. I know I may have made him appear sort of broken because of his fiance cheating on him, but he was on the way to isolation and hostility before then. That event simply defined the rest of his actions. Cold, indifferent, and uncaring to any other person but himself. But damn...I seem to be changing that? Enjoy. Chapter 15 - Ominous Operations Abby stayed mute for a full hour. Her mind was on a silent overdrive, set in between frustration and hopelessness. No one wants me to find out what happened. That's exactly it. Heiter only watched in that way of his which indicated a thousand things in a subdued manner. \"Do not think this the end,\" he offered, brown eyes unreadable. Shaking her head, Abby stubbornly kept quiet. But, eventually, she answered him. \"This isn't the end,\" she agreed, glancing up at him. \"In fact, this is only the beginning. I'm more determined than ever to not only find Steffan's murderer, but the reason why Sarah killed herself. Whoever this is that's scaring everyone, probably thinks they can prevent me from getting what I want. They won't.\" Even he seemed surprised at the announcement. Or perhaps the harsh tone she'd taken on. \"I will find them,\" she vowed again, more to herself. Because there was no beating around the bush anymore. This was the last person who would die protecting something that happened over a decade ago. She briefly realized that the situation could not be good if two leads were cut off from her, but the same rash anger charged through this. It cared no longer of the dangers involved. She wanted answers and she wanted them now. Rudolf, Jakob, and Klaus appeared at the house shortly after. Heiter speaking with them hardly registered to her, nor Klaus's decision to accompany her on the couch. All she did was stare frivolously off into space, attempting to wrap her mind around why this was a secret people were dying for. Whether it'd been minutes or a full hour, Abby didn't know. But eventually, Heiter's stern voice pulled her out of the fast paced thinking. \"I must discuss matters tonight with Rudolf and Jakob,\" he informed. He no longer looked distrustful of leaving her alone. He knew, as did she in a way, that they'd be sticking together for this mystery until it was solved. \"In Berlin.\" The last statement barely processed and she only waved an annoyed hand at him, like swatting at a persistent fly. \"I'll stay with you,\" Klaus promised, eyes searching for hers. \"Don't think you carry this burden alone. I had many dead ends while trying to find my father.\" \"Did your only leads ever get murdered? Or decide to commit suicide as opposed to helping out a girl who knows absolutely nothing? Were they selfish enough to leave you without that choice?\" She stood, ignoring the voluminous and threatening voice speaking for her. She knew deep down that none of them deserved the blunt of her frustration. But the hurt was unimaginably raw. \"And what the hell are you doing?\" she turned her attentions to Rudolf. \"I know you don't give a shit about people, but is this really the best you can do?\" \"Abby.\" Heiter's voice was firm and biting. \"Fuck you,\" she spat, glaring at the man. \"When you lose someone so close to you and the answers continue to be obliterated, you can then tell me to calm down. I'm losing my dad day by day. I can't even remember what he looks like anymore. Don't. Tell. Me. I'm. Out. Of. Line.\" By the time the last few words flew out, Abby's body shook like a wet puppy. The wall she'd built to keep back so much of her guilt and fear, slowly cracked within the concrete. Before any of them could witness its crumble, she stalked out of the room. Through the kitchen, past a hallway and into her temporary room. With a furious slam of the door, Abby's fingers tugged at her new blonde locks as her knees sank to the floor. In moments, she was reduced to a sobbing mess. Tears poked out of the corner of her eyes at first, then decided on being more direct and succeeded in blinding her. But Abby welcomed this. She didn't want to see herself groveling. Herself defeated. So for a few good minutes, she let out a superfluous flow of tears. For her dad. For whatever it is he had gone through. And for the complete anger she felt at Steffan and Sarah. How dare they take away the truth from me? Who is so close to breaking down and screaming out until my lungs are raw? Wondering, constantly. What the hell happened to my dad? By the time a soft tap befell the door, Abby's eyes were dry and sleepy. But her mind worked like a swift machine. She was ashamed of the way she'd treated the people who probably had gotten her closer to the truth than she'd ever be. But at the moment, it wasn't a time to apologize. Not when she feared more outbursts in the future could destroy a former apology. The tap continued, unrelenting despite her obvious need to disassociate herself from everyone else. \"Please, go away,\" she called through a scratchy voice. Instead of heeding her warning, the door slowly swung open. Abby felt the soft footsteps close in on her back, then pause once as if unsure. Finally, they continued until the person joined her on the floor. \"I'm sorry,\" she immediately bit out. \"That was not one of my better moments.\" Klaus shrugged, his green eyes solemn and honest. It was like observing an innocent pup. \"My fits were far worse,\" he mentioned after a moment, wrapping his arms around his knees. The posture made him look childish, but he was only copying her. \"You are right. I never did have my sources of information murdered or decide to kill themselves. But I've felt the same raging frustration you're feeling right now. There are many people I hurt with my words that I am not man enough yet to apologize to.\" Biting at her lip, a timid hand slipped under Abby's chin. \"How long did it take before you found out?\" The brunette gazed into open space. It was the first time Abby fully noted the extent of his own personal hell. A person went to a psychiatrist because they were unsure about what their actions could indicate about themselves. Their own feelings. The purpose of them and potential effects. Klaus, in his own way, appeared just as unsure. Only, he masked it better. But how badly did his search affect his nights? Or his view of the world? Could such disappointment have deteriorated a part of him? \"I was about four. Hardly an age of spectacular memories, but I have this memory of my father tucking me in every night after getting home from his job. His job that just barely afforded us food and clothes and shelter. Communism fell about three years later and the records haven't been publicly released. However, friends I've gained over the years - sympathetic to my situation or perhaps searching much of the same answers - were able to sneak me a glimpse of some records in Russia. I'm twenty-six now, and two years ago I was able to finally put my mind at ease.\" Their eyes stayed on each others as if by otherworldly force. \"Did it help...knowing what happened?\" He took in a deep breath, but his eyes barely flickered. \"Yes and no. I wish I'd read that he went peacefully. But that was hardly the case. Soviet prisons were some of the most intense cells of solitude and cruelty. On the other hand...I finally knew. No more wondering or worrying. I was able to get on with my life, even if a part of it was unlawfully stolen.\" Abby nodded, lost in her own thoughts. \"Why do you really want to help me?\" she asked. One of Klaus's lips twitched before he shook off his stare. \"You remind me of myself. That's cliche to say, but the longer you live without the truth, the more hopeless telling it becomes. I really believe that a part of us dies when we give up. Whether it's for a short moment, or for as long as we continue to withhold that ability to overcome the obstacle we're faced with. I did find the truth. If I hadn't, I would have never become a psychiatrist. I would be so bitter and so lonely and so filled with grief that everyone else's pain would dull in comparison to my own. Whether you believe this could happen to you, that's your own call. But if I can prevent that kind of sorry excuse for a life for you, then maybe what happened to my father might make a little more sense.\" She mulled over his tragic admission, wondering just how fresh his wounds still were. But none of this could be outweighed by the gratitude. Someone who was once in her place, understands her frame of mind, and knows that going home is not an option. That was a comfort she hadn't yet known. \"Tell me what happened,\" she said. \"At Sarah's.\" Klaus took in a breath, but otherwise, his body stayed at ease. \"Security guard found her with the pills.\" \"How do you know it wasn't just her schizophrenia?\" \"If she'd been off her pills, I would know,\" Klaus said, sounding very matter-of-factually. \"What she had clutched in her hand was the common sleeping pills you could find at the pharmacy. Except she'd taken ten times the amount recommended. There was also a suicide note.\" Surprised, Abby pushed to her feet. She held out a hand for Klaus to do the same and when he finally stood to face her, she brought up a curious eyebrow. \"It only said 'I'm sorry'. Nothing else,\" he expressed. \"We're still trying to contact Ivan in Prague. He's not aware yet. Suicide is always tough.\" Abby's mind pulsed at the information. \"Is she still there?\" Klaus carefully studied her, eyes calculative. \"No. Police cleared the place and security's gone home.\" She took a step back, eyebrows furrowed. \"What are you thinking?\" he asked. \"You could get in trouble for what I'm thinking.\" \"For all the police know, I'm just gathering the unused prescriptions from her,\" Klaus informed. \"Tell me what's happening in that head of yours.\" Puzzled at the choice of words, Abby couldn't help but feel eager about her idea. \"I want to go to her house and see if we can get any answers.\" Nodding, Klaus answered, \"Okay.\" \"Aren't you-.\" \"Like I said - we're just going in to get medicine, if anyone is there at all. And I'm sure Josef won't mind.\" For a moment, Abby had forgotten all about what Heiter's reaction to her wandering would be. But then again, with her outburst, hopefully he'd understand the urgency she was filled with. \"Do you know when they're going to be back?\" she asked. \"An hour, maybe. I'll just call them and say where we're going.\" At Abby's hesitancy, Klaus stopped the fingers dialing his cell. \"I've got my own suspicions...but what is the nature of your relationship with Josef?\" he questioned. \"He's a-.\" But Abby was at a loss. They weren't friends. They weren't sworn enemies either. \"An acquaintance,\" she finally answered. Even that sounded odd. \"And you two-.\" \"Not in a million years,\" she found herself repeating, confused as to what in their actions made them appear so chummy in the sexual way. \"Why do you think that?\" \"I don't,\" Klaus admitted, surprised at the thought. \"Just had to make sure. His constant isolation would really be damaging if you were with him.\" \"What?\" Now she was interested and confused. \"I studied psychology in the university,\" Klaus explained. \"Josef's isolation from others and his emotions, are subtle, but there. He's like Hannibal Lecter - without the charm.\" \"You noticed that just in the time spent around him?\" \"Among other things I won't divulge into since you're his acquaintance. I don't discriminate against people's actions. I just wanted to make sure you were aware of the potential hostility and wariness he has for others.\" \"Yes, I'm aware.\" And she was. Actually, she had the sudden urge to divulge her two month vacation to Klaus. But this information was hardly relevant. It happened and someone else's sympathies couldn't change that. She'd survived. That's all that mattered. \"No, he's just helping me find out the same thing you are. Go ahead and call him. Tell him we're going no matter what he says.\" APHAPHAPHAPH The drive to Neuruppin seemed to take forever. Abby hadn't asked what Heiter's reply was, but she found herself angry at the thought of planning her actions around him. It was a trait common of a victim and she was hardly that anymore. Regardless, a part of her was worried that he'd hop in his car and speed after them. \"You're fidgety,\" Klaus noted, taking her in. Abby offered a small smile, but didn't say anything back immediately. Instead, she focused on his eyes. When alone, the nature green tended to be the most expressive orbs Abby had ever gazed into. They were warm and sophisticated and truthful. Whatever Klaus had to hide, one look at his eyes would show his experiences. She didn't know where this sudden observation came from, but soon, her eyes couldn't help but admire the curve of his jaw and the patch of dark brown forming there. The trail pattered around his chin and his red lips every so often would purse in concentration. I guess with all the time spent in Heiter's presence, Klaus's face is like a canvas of light, color, and action. A beautiful canvas, I might add. Blushing at the thought, Abby turned away before her treacherous eyes could deceive her intentions. The man was doing her a huge favor by taking the trip to Sarah's house. She wasn't about to ruin it by commenting on the physical attributes of his features. No matter how handsome they appeared. So, she answered him dully and without much consideration for her own feelings. When entering Sarah's house, she couldn't afford to be distracted. APHAPHAPHAPH Neuruppin was a massive region with sub-cities off the Rhin river and beautiful, magnificent buildings. All of Germany in fact carried that ancient, European flair that set it distinctly apart from the New World. But this area in general seemed to magnify the beauty tourists flocked overseas to snap pictures of. \"Minus the homes, this could be any town back in my country,\" she muttered, eyes taking in all of the lights at once. Night had already descended, but this didn't darken the city any. In fact, the lights illuminated the streets, making it appear like it's own little luminous center. \"Do you miss your home in the States?\" Klaus said. \"There wasn't anything for me there,\" she replied. \"No family and no friends. I think that's why I like traveling. I can immerse myself within a town and just for a moment, believe I'm welcome.\" When she turned to Klaus, the man was watching her curiously. \"Maybe one day settling down won't be so difficult,\" he offered. They stayed silent after that, and Abby focused on memorizing the beauty for her own purpose. Just in case something happened to her, she'd be able to remember this last image stamped sharply into her head. Sarah's house called for a deviation away from the lights and glamour of the city. If Neuruppin had a rural area, it wasn't far. Houses were spread in greater amounts once they began driving up a hill, but otherwise, it resembled the outskirts of any massive town. \"It's the first house on the right,\" Klaus pointed out. Through the darkness, all of the petrified homes appeared malignant. As if their intentions were swallowed up inside the oppressive black, beckoning and warning you at the same time. Finally, the house they'd been searching for, slipped into view. \"Why'd they feel the need for guards?\" she wondered aloud, watching Klaus fumble in his coat pocket. He pulled out a remote not much bigger than a garage door opener and pressed down on it. The rusty, aged gates slowly opened before them. \"My guess is Ivan's investments. Probably paranoid about someone trying to steal everything he's gained.\" That sounded plausible to her. As they drove down the curved path, the place wasn't so much of a house as it was a mansion. Green lawn extended on either side of them, touching far past the road. Hedges, a fountainhead, and a garden were objects Abby managed to pick out through the dark alone. The time and money it took to keeping the place looking attractive far exceeded perhaps even Heiter's income. \"Are you ready?\" Shaking herself out of the reverie, Abby noticed the vehicle had stopped at least a full minute ago. \"We might not find anything here.\" \"Now look who's the one with cold feet.\" Sighing, Abby unbuckled herself and took in the gloomy home before her. \"Let's go.\" APHAPHAPHAPH The entire inside of the house was like a never ending labyrinth. Ivan and Sarah Kappel didn't only live in a luxurious mansion, they showed off the appropriate lifestyle. Dinette sets, antique chandeliers, carpets flown in from the Middle East. Whatever was fancy, the Kappel's made a notable effort to purchase it. Abby started on one half of the hallway staircase and Klaus investigated the other. Having the place lit was a relief, but knowing a life had been taken only hours prior, caused Abby to handle everything far more delicately. This time she kept a careful watch on everything she touched. If a drawer was opened, she used Klaus's coat to open it. The man had been nice enough to lend it to her once the wind had caused an involuntary chatter to spill from her lips. What the hell am I really expecting to find here? A descriptive note explaining everything I want to hear? Fat chance. She continued sliding open drawers, even knocking on the bottom to see if it was hollow. In the movies, sometimes the bottom held a secret compartment. But the Kappel's did not. \"Did you find anything?\" Abby finally asked after an hour of peering at replicas by Delacroix and Monet. At first glance, no one would have suspected them to be copies. But she detected the faint smell of oil on one piece, indicating the work to have been recently painted. Another painting had the audacity to still leave paint bristles upon the piece. They were wedged underneath the paint quite cleverly, but the cheapness of it didn't blind her. They have to have known these pieces were replicas. Even if their guests didn't. And like a light bulb illuminating, Abby's fingers shook off the coat sleeves and extended forward. They paused in their ascension however, when her eyes took in the four paintings to the left. Which one? Slowly, Abby braced the painting ahead of her with both hands and gently lifted the pieces off its hanger. The wall remained bare, but this didn't discourage her. Moving on, Abby repeated the same process on the next painting. Once it too was leaning against the wall, Abby's palm drifted over the wall. Nothing. \"What are you doing?\" Keeping back her shriek, Abby turned to Klaus. She'd nearly forgotten he was inside the house as well. The man eyed her curiously, inquisitive toward her findings. \"Anything interesting?\" she tried first. \"A few bank notices. The Kappel's fortune was slowly being sucked away.\" Studying his speculative look, Abby shook her head. \"That's hardly a reason to commit suicide. I mean yes...if money was everything, it would be. But Sarah Kappel had bigger concerns than her fortune.\" Klaus nodded before fixing his gaze on the pictures. \"They're replicas,\" he deduced after a moment. \"You see it as well?\" \"The Stormy Sea in Etretat. I remember seeing it in a French museum when I was a teenager. This...it doesn't give off the same feeling Monet's did. There's something...off about it.\" Abby observed it as well. \"Why are you taking them down?\" \"It's a bit difficult to explain.\" Throwing her a sarcastic frown, Klaus said, \"I may not be graceful with art, but I know my way around the reasons behind actions.\" Shrugging, Abby asked, \"When did Sarah become diagnosed with schizophrenia?\" \"She said the symptoms developed shortly after her 25th birthday. They became prominent, and properly diagnosed at age 33. She was 45 when she died.\" Nodding, Abby's eyes strayed back to the paintings. \"A Young Tiger Playing With It's Mother. Delacroix's piece. Beautiful, but reproduced. In fact, all five of these paintings are. I can still smell the oils used to make them. Now...I'm going to assume Sarah was an intelligent woman with a particular fascination for art. I mean look at the surroundings. Also, she must have known these were duplicates. Everything in their home appears to have been bought with precise prior knowledge...except these paintings.\" \"And you think there was a reason she bought the duplicates,\" Klaus finished, stepping up to her. \"Yes. In her mind, I think she was trying to make sense of the responsibility looming over her. A responsiblity she'd inherited 12 years ago.\" \"Your father's disappearance?\" \"It's a stretch, I'll admit. But what if whatever she knew had become so frustrating to keep in that she had to find a way to express it. So...these paintings come along. Fake, but they make sense in her mind.\" \"Perhaps a reflection of the failed duties she did not voice?\" Klaus mumbled, eyes scanning each piece carefully. \"Often, the mind of a schizophrenic, after a traumatic event, finds clues or meaning in otherwise useless objects. They are a meaning of escape.\" \"She knows they're fake, but sees an alternative use to them. Her husband, nonethewiser, buys them. His eyes are in the financial business, not art.\" \"And beneath the paintings...\" His comment trailed off, but she nodded in reply regardless. \"These are the only paintings I've found in the entire house since my visits,\" Klaus admitted. \"I never took the time to observe them properly.\" \"Now we can.\" So, Abby stood in front of one painting while Klaus ventured in front of another. They shared a gaze with each other for one second before lifting the paintings off. \"Shit,\" she murmured, eyes wide. Klaus followed her awed stare and smiled. \"A brilliant observation.\" Not quite hearing the words, Abby pressed two fingers over the wood. It was a four by four inch piece that hadn't been painted over by the bright white paint within the interior of the room. A small, finger sized hatch sat snuggled within the varnished cherry brown. Slowly, she wedged her index finger within the space and pulled back the door. Inside, papers lay crumpled atop each other - old but preserved. Her hands immediately scooped up the pile. Some felt thicker than others while a few envelopes were stuck in between. \"Read them on the way back?\" she suggested. \"Good idea. I don't know when Ivan's going to be home. Last thing we want is him to see us snooping around.\" For a moment, Abby stayed rooted to the ground. \"Do you think Ivan knew about this?\" Klaus took a careful amount of consideration for this question. \"I doubt it. When money's on your mind, everything else becomes secondhand.\" She glanced down at the pile, fingers buzzing. Please let there be something informative. Something that will keep me from ripping out my hair in frustration. APHAPHAPHAPH Despite the urgency she felt, they'd both decided on waiting until they were back within city limits before inspecting the letters. This drove Abby mad, but this information would be better understood under a light and experienced eyes. So, the ride back was filled with a laced tension of excitement. Abby's knee rocked up and down, and soon, this excitement had her struggling to breathe properly. Klaus looked over in concern. \"Are you alright?\" \"Yeah, yeah,\" she mumbled. \"Just...kind of on edge.\" A silence built in and Abby took that time to calm herself with steady breaths. \"I can't believe I hadn't thought of it,\" Klaus declared after Neuruppin had long ago passed by. \"I was her doctor. I knew her symptoms. She used to not want to throw away scraps of paper because she thought they'd be useful in someway. But the paintings. God damn, Abby. That was really perceptive.\" Shrugging, Abby felt another blush spread through her cheeks. She wasn't sure how to react to the praise. \"Thank you,\" she responded. \"I think I only made the connection out of desperation. And the oddity of the paintings.\" \"You're-.\" But he didn't finish his thought. Even when she glanced at him curiously. It seemed the man had wanted to say something important, but shied away from it. This only warmed the blush in Abby's cheeks. APHAPHAPHAPH Jakob and Heiter watched Abby and Klaus enter the house just as eleven in the evening struck. She wasn't sure how long they'd been waiting, but Klaus offered a friendly smile. \"We found something,\" he acknowledged. \"Well…Abby found it.\" \"I've gotten word back on the Geiper case,\" Jakob redirected. \"You're testifying again tomorrow morning.\" Klaus didn't visibly deflate, but Abby noted the slight slumping of his shoulders. Because it was around eleven in the evening, shuffling through the letters would take a good few hours. \"Get some sleep, Klaus,\" Abby offered, taking him in. \"And thank you. For everything.\" Her voice lowered at this and the same tingle shivered through her upon taking the deep green reflected in his eyes. \"Good night, Abby.\" Before she knew what she was doing, Abby opened her arms. To her relief, Klaus didn't hesitate in greeting them with a great pull into his body. The contact felt heavenly. Like a mixed sensation of warm flesh, strong muscle, and pleasant tightness. She forgot how long it'd been since she'd had any human contact with someone. To hear a heartbeat so close. To feel breaths flinging her blonde hair around. Hugging Klaus was a sanctuary she did not take for granted this time around. Their unification was interrupted by a cough, but this hardly penetrated the incredible feelings associated. \"Sorry,\" she mumbled, pushing back from him after a minute. Klaus only grinned. \"I needed that after today. Have a good night, Miss Post.\" With that, the man glanced over at Jakob in confirmation and the two voiced their goodbyes to the doctor before heading to the door. Abby still watched the hallway even when the rumble of their joint vehicle met her ears. When her eyes fell back to Heiter's, she fought back the need to step back. The gaze he aimed at her was a bit too reminiscent of the animosity he'd held toward her from her first few days of captivity. Her relaxed smile receded and immediately, her body shifted into a defensive position. But before she could analyze it more, Heiter's face smoothed over and all previous ill emotions were cleared. \"You found something,\" he indicated, eyes finding the stack of papers in her hand. Shaking off her unease, Abby too drank in the papers. \"Yes. She had installed a secret, wooden compartment behind a replica of a Monet painting. I haven't looked them over yet. I thought we could do it together.\" And for a brief second, Abby understood exactly why Rudolf and Klaus were curious about the nature of their relationship. She treated him like an equal. Not someone to be feared or loathed. Like his aloofness toward her didn't matter. \"That would be wise. Your German is not the best.\" \"Have you ever heard yourself speak? It's like your words were taken through a wood chipper,\" she relayed. The man glared at her, but this made Abby's grin return. \"And...about telling you to fuck off earlier. That was my frustration talking.\" Visibly surprised, Heiter said, \"You are very honest, aren't you?\" Puzzled, Abby shrugged uncertainly. \"Why wouldn't I be? We both know when the other is lying. What's the point?\" \"You do not know me so well,\" he defended. \"Don't I? We'll try a little test. You give me two statements. Let one of them be the truth, and the other a lie. I'll pick out which is which.\" \"Must I?\" \"The 'I'm so disgusted an American girl thinks she knows me' look is unappealing. Go ahead.\" Heiter thought for a moment, indulging into her experiment for unknown purposes. \"Your hair color is hideous. This mystery with your father will be solved.\" Pondering, Abby placed a finger beneath her chin and tapped along with her train of thought. Only a minute went by before she voiced her findings. \"You're lying about the hair color.\" \"Prove it,\" he retorted. \"Had you thought my hair color despicable upon it's initial transformation, you'd have told me. You wouldn't pass by an opportunity to comment on my lack of physical appeal. Mentioning my hair color's unattractiveness is a bit short notice now. Also, you know we're going to find out what happened to my dad because you're determined to rid yourself of me. If this mystery isn't solved, I'd be stuck in your company for the rest of eternity.\" He seemed perplexed by the last statement. \"Your whole speech about keeping me under your thumb until the mystery with my dad was solved? I took that to mean I could go home afterward?\" For a horrifying moment, Abby was afraid he was going to shake his head. Say no. Anything to disprove her words. Instead, he finally responded, \"Yes.\" \"So,\" she mulled, diving back to her theory, \"I had to wonder if you were more dedicated to disliking my hair color, or to solving my dad's disappearance.\" \"This is how your brain operates?\" \"Neat, huh?\" \"Troubling. How did you complete activities without taking an hour to think over them?\" \"Was I right?\" He didn't answer. \"Point proven. So now I'm in a good mood. You like my hair color and we're going to solve this mystery.\" The roll of his eyes was a further self satisfaction for the blonde girl. \"The papers,\" he acknowledged. \"Place them on the table.\" Nodding, Abby glanced down at the messy pile in her hands and hoped desperately that a clue layed within the distortment of a turbulent, and dismal mystery. Hope nothing was too confusing for you. Let me know your thoughts in a review because I appreciate them desperately :). And I actually am taking an Art History class online. It's not as descriptive as what I write on here, but I enjoy marveling and gazing at pictures greatly.[Chapter 16] Thank you for the review! Very much appreciated. And on we go! Hope you enjoy. Chapter 16 - Peculiar Patterns \"What does that one say?\" Abby questioned, blowing a stray bleached lock out of her face. \"Much of the same,\" Heiter answered, eyes peering intensely at the writing. \"A letter to a lawyer in Berlin. She asks the man what the capital offense for-.\" He paused abruptly, glancing up at her. Abby met his gaze expectantly. \"Capital offense for what?\" \"It does not matter,\" he decided, placing the letter down. \"Heiter,\" she bit out, pushing back her sweaty bangs, \"we've been shuffling through papers for an hour. Besides the deed to the house and letters to her parents, there is nothing here. If there is information on that paper, you have got to tell me.\" Picking up the paper once more, he reread the information. \"She asked the lawyer what the capital offense is for helping to conceal a murder.\" Tearing away her gaze, Abby glanced down at her fingers. Letters written in hasty German covered her fingernails while a stack of envelopes in the right hand corner still waited to be opened. \"We don't know what she meant,\" she confirmed quietly. When the man remained silent, Abby's glance turned into a glare. \"Read the date,\" he suggested, letter outstretched. Grabbing the paper, she scoured the upper hand corner. \"February the 26th, 1998.\" She knew Heiter would want the significance of the date to dawn on her, but a tiny hope inside still refused to believe it. \"My dad disappeared the year before in July,\" she responded evenly. \"The postcard he sent was marked in December 5th of 1997. If he stayed alive for six months, what are the chances of him being killed in less than two?\" \"Perhaps they were simply biding their time. Or Mrs. Kappel waited a few months before sending the letter. After the murder was completed.\" \"Stop it!\" she spat, eyes two fiery orbs. \"Stop saying he's dead.\" \"You are blind to the facts, Abby. They are not simple for you to grasp, but denying them will gain you nothing.\" Scraping her nails across the marble table, the blonde girl shook her head vehemently. A few calm breaths pressed from her lips. \"I am going to follow this as if he's waiting for me to rescue him,\" she answered determinedly. \"He is not dead.\" Heiter appeared to want to retort, but for once, it was her forceful gaze that caused him to lower his eyes. And back to the papers they went. She'd passed all of the German written letters to him and he'd give her a brief summary of what each letter detailed. The one to her lawyer was as of yet, the most informative. \"I'll start looking through the envelopes,\" she tiredly motioned, grabbing the six she'd found inside the secret compartment. Once the first was torn open with her finger, Abby sat back down and rubbed at her eyes. The excitement of the day was slowly starting to wear her out. Not only that, but she was beginning to lose faith. This time, permanently. Sighing, she retracted the letter and was prepared to hand it over to Heiter when her eyes paused. Everything was written in English. Her eyes scanned over the date and a further intake of breath was taken. November 14th, 2009. \"This letter,\" she mumbled, eyes wide, \"was written on the day of her suicide...and-.\" \"What?\" Mouth open, Abby found Heiter's brown eyes glued to her. \"It's addressed to me,\" she voiced quietly. At his perplexed gaze, the blonde found the letter again and began reading. Dear Abby, I know nothing of you, and I feel an apology is required. For my actions, for the actions of Steffan, and the other men who were involved in the atrocity that took place 12 years ago. Death has freed me, but you are still living, still grieving, and I only hope the answers I attempt to provide will finally ease your soul. My shame is too great to put into words everything that happened. This is why I have assembled the other five envelopes. If your intelligence brought you this far, the findings inside will be easily connected in your mind. But know that I am sorry for standing by and saying nothing. Another regret that I hope death will relieve me of. It is cowardly, but I do not think I would be able to face your disappointment. Study the items in the other envelopes carefully and you will find the answers you are looking for. There is also something I wish to admit. Something Steffan did not know, for I did not wish to mention it. Something you must know, but I take no pleasure in informing you. Your father - Gregory Post of Livonia, Michigan - is deceased. My hand shakes each time I struggle to write the details of it for the death he suffered was cruel and wrong. He was a good man with good intentions. The two men responsible for his death overlooked this and were only focused on their own sense of right and wrong. Their actions were in retaliation of something your father had done. And although your father is long gone, I want to thank him for doing what he did. I hope what you find does not poison your life forever and I desperately hope you are able to eventually move on. Sincerely, Sarah Kappel Abby had been biting down on her lip so hard that she hadn't acknowledged the coppery blood blasting through an open gash. Her hands shook while her brain fought to drop the paper. He's dead? She closed her eyes, attempting to prevent the image of Sarah's words from overrunning her mind. The shaking extended from her hand, to her body and soon after, her head hit the table with a thump. Squeezed shut, Abby kept back all tears while she quivered in silence. He's dead. He's dead. He's dead. He's dead. He's dead. The words repeated like a rhythmic metronome. Mocking, and hypnotic. Heiter's hand uncharacteristically settled down on her shoulder, but the girl hardly responded. \"I will open the other envelopes,\" he suggested. For a moment, she didn't speak. In fact, something quite strange happened. Instead of taking in the grief as she normally would have, her mind strayed to the facts of the letter. Two men had murdered her father. The doctor's arm slipped off when she sprung back up in the chair. \"Okay.\" He studied her for a second. \"You are sure? For such a loud girl, you are taking this very calmly.\" Abby's eyes squelched the vulnerability she'd momentarily felt and with a determined grimace, she nodded. \"I'm fine. Let's just find out what happened.\" \"You are sure?\" \"Heiter. When I'm ready to break down and cry, I will break down and cry. Right now, I want to find out what the hell happened.\" The last statement was said with a bit of frustration, but Abby didn't care anymore. I'm going to kill both of the bastards. I'm going to kill them just like how they killed dad. APHAPHAPHAPH By the time all of the envelopes were open, Abby was ready to commit suicide herself. Although Sarah had claimed the answers were all there, the clues hardly made sense with each other. In one envelope there were newspaper clippings of three unsolved murders ranging in an area beginning in Neuruppin all the way to Berlin. Five women - all brutally mutilated, tortured, all in their teens. The years ranged from 1990 to 1994. Another envelope held a black and white photograph of three men along with a youthful looking Sarah. The light catapulting off the lens had caused the men's faces to become distorted and unrecognizable, but Heiter inferred that one resembled Ivan. The third envelope carried something that did make sense, but not in a relieving way. When Abby was a child of seven and had been given her first $20 bill, she sprang to the nearest store. Trinkets & Things. Father's day was just around the corner and the man she called daddy, deserved something special. So, she purchased a Donald Duck watch. The band was a yellowish, aged leather with the background of the clock holding the duck's famous, grinning face. To her elation and surprise, her dad wore it constantly. Whether it was because of his love for her or he genuinely enjoyed the childish device, Abby couldn't say. But, she'd hardly ever saw it off his wrist. Inside the envelope was the sacred watch, a faint blood stain covering five of the holes. No longer appearing a bright yellow, the resulting color appeared crimson mustard. The two tickers were stuck on the time 2:02. \"It was my dad's,\" she indicated after a moment, slipping the watch back into the envelope. The emotion associated with the object was too much to bear at the moment. Heiter didn't say anything and for this, she was glad. Once another envelope was opened, Abby began to feel the exhaustion of the entire day weigh down on her. \"It's an address in Munich,\" Heiter mentioned after a few seconds of staring at the notebook paper. \"Recognize it?\" \"No. Most of this information I will take to Rudolf in the morning.\" \"Oh-.\" She stopped herself upon his heavy look. \"Tell me,\" he insisted, \"what you are thinking.\" Biting at her gashed lip, Abby sighed. \"If Sarah thought I could gain all of the information I needed just from these envelopes, then I trust her. Let's not involve Rudolf until our minds have burned out from every possibility.\" \"I'm afraid I don't understand the point of this.\" \"I want to make my dad proud,\" she expressed after a moment. \"By completing this without everyone leading me the way. That's now the way the world works. And yes...this is a bit hypocritical to say considering I was ready to murder someone after Steffan and Sarah's deaths. But we have the answers in front of us. It's just a matter of figuring them out.\" Heiter kept his eyes on her for a full minute before replying. \"You do not trust Rudolf.\" \"No, I don't,\" she admitted. \"He was kind to have gotten me some hair dye, but otherwise, I trust him as far as I can throw him.\" \"I did not expect you too fully.\" Crossing her arms, Abby leaned back in the chair. A sly smile rose over her lips despite the grim circumstances. \"What dirt do you have on him?\" The doctor scrunched his eyebrows. \"Let me rephrase. What do you know about Rudolf that makes him so ready to help you?\" His further puzzlement didn't fool Abby this time. \"You know something. I know you know,\" she tiredly accused, her grin expanding. \"Sleep deprivation is getting to you,\" he replied. The laugh flew from her throat before she could contain it. \"God damn it, Heiter. How in the hell have I gotten to know you so well? You are a class A bullshitter!\" A yawn broke through her laughter, but the doctor continued staring at her as if she was clinically insane. A funny thought considering the man was most likely as sane as a rabies infested bat. \"I do not know.\" The reply made her cease the chuckling and blow out a few breaths. \"Maybe it's one of those really unique events,\" she offered. \"That happens once in a millennium. Two people who inexplicably understand each other.\" Around them, the silence tensed. She hadn't really thought over her words before announcing them, but there was no point in doing so. He'd either scowl at her or grimace. To Abby's surprise however, her words had set off a thoughtful look over his face and the warmness seeping in was too foreign for her mind to comprehend. But apparently not her mouth. \"You look so at ease right now,\" she observed, green eyes wide. \"Like you're really happy for once.\" Heiter didn't respond, and after an abundance of facial extensions, Abby recognized he wouldn't. \"Maybe you're right. It is the lack of sleep making me so loopy. I'll open this last envelope and then I'm calling it a night.\" She didn't wait for his response. With a steady hand, Abby dragged the remaining envelope across the table and studied it for a brief second. Then, she tore it open. Another tired laugh broke through her lips. This time, there was a slight sullenness in it. The black and white image before her was of the Spree River, vast and great with a tourist ship sailing by. The sky was a murky gray, and some sort of mist had settled over the area. Through the mist stood a figure with their back to the river. Not quite in his mid-40's, the figure didn't smile at the camera even though he was aware of its presence. Instead, a slight grimace marred his face. The way his body was positioned toward the river announced that he'd been caught off guard by the shot. \"What is it?\" Glancing up, Abby clutched the photo to her chest. \"My dad.\" And with a slight nod to the man, Abby turned into the hallway, photo in hand, and proceeded to her room. At least she gained something tonight. APHAPHAPHAPH \"I'll wake her up.\" \"You sure, Josef? I'm on my way to the bathroom and her room-.\" \"I am sure.\" Abby's ears just barely detected this conversation before the footsteps entered her room. They slammed against the carpet in agitation, but calmed upon taking her in. \"Yes?\" she weakly called out, clutching the blanket tighter to her. For once, her dreams were not a reflection of the nightmare her life had turned into upon traveling to Germany. She was with her dad by the river, attempting to decipher why exactly he seemed so forlorn. Heiter didn't answer, so Abby reluctantly shuffled out of her reverie and exposed her body to the cool room. \"Don't tell me someone else has died,\" she mumbled, rubbing the sleep out of her eyes. \"Not this time. Despite your preference to keep out Rudolf, I made an effort to give him the photo of the three figures and Mrs. Kappel late last night. He is in possession of the photo with the faces clearly dialated.\" Raising a brow, Abby breathed out. \"That's wonderful. Have...you seen it yet?\" \"No. I felt...at odds looking upon something which holds more meaning to you.\" Unsure how to feel about that comment, Abby offered up a grin. Her eyes strayed behind the man to the open door. \"They're all here?\" \"Only Rudolf and Klaus.\" \"Klaus is done testifying?\" \"For now.\" A grin lit up her features, but it paused when she glanced down to the picture she had gripped in her fingers. \"Alright,\" she finally acknowledged. \"Let's see what Sarah is trying to tell us.\" APHAPHAPHAPH Klaus shot her a quick smile as she entered the room and Abby nodded despite herself. The primary goal was to be focused, not act like a lovesick puppy. But, the man had a way about him. Deep thinker, intelligent, art enthusiast. How many of her boyfriends actually possessed one of those aforementioned qualities? \"Miss Post,\" Rudolf greeted gruffly, hand outstretched. \"It appears this photo is quite informative in regards to the persons within it.\" Taking the photo from him, she studied the scenery. \"This is the original photo,\" she responded. \"Yes,\" he agreed, taking out a manila folder from his coat pocket. \"The blown up version is right here. Now...the figures in this photo need a bit of explanation. The female figure is indeed, Sarah Kappel. Her husband Ivan is beside her. However, the other two men, previously unidentifyable, are suddenly very interesting. They are Ivan's brothers.\" \"Ivan's brothers?\" she repeated. \"Why would she give me a picture of them?\" Her gaze befell Klaus's first, then Heiter's. Neither answered. Fumbling with the photo, Rudolf studied the picture carefully before blowing out a sigh from beneath his thick mustache. \"The brother on the far side is Jonas. Interesting thing about him. When I called his home, his wife informs me she has not seen or heard from him for over two months. When I checked up on this, I found he has been on our list at the station as a missing person just as the wife told.\" Now that's strange. What if Jonas also was aware of what occurred? Did he disappear because he wanted to tell me? \"And the other man?\" she asked, curiosity piquing. \"Nearest to Ivan is Luca. He was the middle child, and the most outspoken. He did not have any trouble with us until-,\" Rudolf dug around for a moment in the folder, tiny eyes scattering rapidly. \"-he was arrested in 1993.\" \"What for?\" \"I did not work the case myself, but it would appear Luca was a prime suspect in the Highway murders from Neuruppin to Berlin around 1990-1994.\" Abby stilled immediately and threw a quick glance at Heiter. His eyes hid his emotions well, but she knew he was just as shocked as she was. \"Five teenage girls. They were raped, then mutilated.\" She didn't need to hear it. The newsclippings of the murders were already in an envelope Sarah had left for her. \"Was it him?\" Klaus asked inquisitively. \"Not enough information to prosecute him. Although it is common knowledge in the precinct that he was the one who performed the crimes. Now...the odd thing is that he too is missing. Only...he's been missing for a far longer time than Jonas. About thirteen years.\" Composing herself, Abby felt the thump of her pulse increase its beats against her neck. \"He disappeared in Germany?\" Rudolf gave a tight smile before meeting her eyes. \"No. He disappeared in the United States.\" Mechanically, she took the newly developed photo from his hands and brought it before her. Out of the corner of her eye, she caught Heiter approaching from behind. The three men sat on a fence with grins on their faces while Sarah stood, eyes crinkled at their silly mannerisms. The background appeared rural and isolated. Maybe a farm or field. And without the sudden glare of the sun, all of the faces were clear as day. \"Heiter,\" Abby suddenly voiced, eyes widening. \"Yes?\" Her eyes squinted as her finger rested on the face of Luca Kappel. \"This man...I recognize him.\" They simultaneously met each other's eyes. \"How?\" he asked in deep confusion. \"He's-.\" Abby closed her eyes, forcing her mind to reach back into time. It was one of the few times that she physically had to dig around for the memory instead of waiting for it to come. \"He's one of the men my father and I worked on in the warehouse,\" she breathed out, eyes opened. \"You are sure?\" Rudolf questioned. \"Yes,\" she retorted, swinging her head to him. \"Yes. He's smiling in the picture here and he's got two deep dimples. I remember commenting on them to my dad. And the way his jaw is set. I saw Luca Kappel's dead body.\" One hand shook at this new information, suddenly observing everything from a new perspective. \"And the other?\" the detective wondered. \"Do you recognize him?\" \"I doubt it,\" Abby muttered, seemingly in a faraway trance. \"Why would I-?\" She trailed off and instead, glanced down at the remaning brother. Jonas. And this time, neither she nor Heiter could keep back their surprise. Carefully, Abby took in every feature of the man just to make sure it really were the eyes that had stared back at her. \"Heiter,\" she began, eyes catching his, \"I watched this man die in your basement.\" Let me know your thoughts in a review![Chapter 17] Thank you very much for the reviews! They keep me writing on. Just want to make sure you all understood the last chapter - Sarah's husband Ivan is brothers with Luca and Jonas. Luca was a German serial killer who traveled to the United States for a little while to avoid detection and Abby recognized him as being one of the bodies she and her father worked on. Jonas is also connected and is the man Heiter killed off toward the beginning of the story, the one Abby had talked to in German and asked about his family. Just wanted to make sure you weren't too confused as they try to piece everything together. Oh, and Quaesitum means something sought such as an objective or an end. As I get into the XYZ letters, you'll hear the chapter titles become words not often used in the English language. I'll put the definitions of them so you're not confused. Anywho, enjoy! Chapter 17 - Quarrelsome Quaesitum Abby hadn't realized how the room would react once she voiced the very dramatic ending of Jonas Kappel. She herself hardly was able to get her head around what was just learned. First, there was Klaus. \"You killed someone in your basement?\" he shouted, more stunned than everything. \"This guy has a wife at home waiting for him. What the hell is wrong with you?\" He directed all of his harsh remarks toward Heiter, but Abby felt a need to explain the situation despite the fact that she silently cheered on his anger. Until she realized Jonas was involved somehow in her dad's disappearance. That was when Rudolf stepped in. \"You did not inform me Jonas was a part of your hobby as well.\" She detected the cold fury beneath the comment. The man was pissed off because Heiter had kept back this very valuable information. But it horrified Abby that Rudolf understood exactly what the doctor's taste were and did nothing to prevent it. Before the situation could further erupt, Abby threw out two hands. \"Calm down, alright? We're working together, not against each other,\" she declared. \"This was before I realized our source was a murderer,\" Klaus angrily answered. Sighing, Abby waved off Heiter's response and instead, approached the furious man. \"I'll explain what happened, okay? Let's go somewhere private.\" Klaus appeared unsure, but when he realized Heiter nor Rudolf would be following, he visibly relaxed. \"Fine. But from now on, I only answer to Abby's requests.\" Abby ignored the glare he shot behind her and instead, led the man out of the den hastily. He was still tense when they entered her room. \"You lied to me,\" he stated, taking her in with stormy, green eyes. Mouth open, Abby wasn't sure what to say. \"In what sense?\" she finally tried. \"Your relationship with him. You watched him murder a man.\" \"I never said that!\" \"But your words implied it. And now you're defending him.\" Sighing, Abby gathered her breathing under control. \"It's not like that. There are things you don't know about-.\" \"Then tell me yourself, Abby. I immediately trusted you because of the shared experience we have. And maybe that trust was misplaced because a whole bunch of other feelings I hadn't felt in a long time, rushed in as well.\" Backing up at his forceful pace forward, the blonde kept back the nerves flushing through her. \"I'm sorry if your trust has been tainted. But Klaus...I can't explain what happened. I can barely understand it myself, much less figure out how it happened.\" Klaus studied her for a long moment before nodding. \"Then let me try figuring this out.\" Knowing she owed him at least that, Abby gestured her go ahead as she sank down on the bed. Suddenly, she was far too tired for amount of sleep she had gotten. \"He insists on you not going to the police with your information, but to a crooked detective. He is constantly making sure you are within the house. And even if you think you hide it well, you are nervous about his reactions.\" Caught between being appreciative of his talents and anxious about his words, Abby shrugged. \"That's not a normal relationship between two people.\" \"And having our father's taken away and murdered is normal as well?\" she countered. \"I am not saying this is your fault,\" Klaus said, voice lowering somewhat, \"In fact, I think you were caught at the wrong place, at the wrong time.\" When she remained silent, Klaus stood directly in front of her and tipped her chin up to meet his gaze. \"Has he hurt you?\" he all but whispered. Abby didn't know how to respond. It was a simple question, but the answer suddenly seemed too complex. \"Please, tell me Abby. I can help you get away from him if he has.\" \"He's not hurting me. I hurt him before he could hurt me.\" At the puzzled expression on Klaus's face, Abby sighed. One that nearly took all of the energy out of her. \"When we leave this room,\" she began after a hesitant moment, \"you're not to say anything. Understand?\" \"A-.\" \"No. Consider this patient confidentiality. What I'm going to tell you can not alter your view of Heiter.\" \"You're afraid he'll kill you if you tell?\" \"The less people who know, the better. Plus...he really has helped me.\" She had one last second thought about divulging her two month stay inside the hell home. But, this didn't undermine the ease she felt around Klaus. The sooner they got this problem out of the way, the sooner they could get back to deciphering exactly what occurred. \"I was looking for Steffan Mahnkompf's address when-.\" APHAPHAPHAPH Klaus had kept his face flawlessly indifferent throughout the duration of the story. This didn't worry Abby. Especially after how easily she'd been able to get the story out. Save for Jonas's death, and the maddening effects of withdrawal, Abby's voice remained relatively smooth. However, it was only when she began describing how relaxed their relationship got, that Klaus shifted on the bed. \"And he responded to this kiss?\" he'd asked. \"Not exactly. Later in the night, he attempted to kill me.\" On she went, relaying the story as quickly as she could. There were some parts Klaus wanted said again or to be explained more in depth. Abby recognized it was the psychiatrist in him attempting to grasp on to what he was hearing but, it still made her uncomfortable discussing it. It felt like he was twisting her words and making them seem something they were not. \"Now I'm here and I've just found out that the man Heiter killed, was brothers with one of my dad's victims and brother in law to a woman who committed suicide. Give me a bit of a break to take this in.\" Respectfully, Klaus did as such. But she could literally hear the mental cogs churning in his head. However, his next words completely surprised her. \"If you want me to act like nothing happen, I will.\" \"Really?\" She didn't even try hiding her disbelief. \"Ultimately, this is about your father. Heiter's presence is not necessary, but effective. You understand everything he's done leading to figuring out something that means more to you than survival. In a way, you feel thankful despite your nonchalance. This is why you most likely safeguard what occurred. I will keep my lips closed because you are doing this for your father, and because you are a beautiful person for tolerating his disgusting actions.\" Smiling weakly, Abby grasped Klaus's hand. \"That's more than I could have asked for.\" APHAPHAPHAPH Upon venturing back into the den with a smile, Abby paused with Klaus directly behind her. Rudolf was regarding Heiter mutinously, lips formed into a tight, pale line. Heiter barely acknowledged the detective, eyes pasted on their presence. Somebody's conversation didn't go well. Which means he'll be cranky. \"I-.\" \"Shut up, whore.\" The words slapped Abby across the face two times before realizing they'd come from Rudolf. \"You have no right to speak to her that way,\" Klaus defended, bringing a hand to her shoulder. Heiter didn't say anything. \"My presence here is not needed anymore,\" Rudolf spat, backing down at Klaus's furious gaze. \"This case has been solved.\" With that, he threw a quick glare at Heiter before stomping out of the room. Klaus and Abby watched him retreat before letting their eyes fall on the doctor. \"What happened?\" she asked. \"Rudolf's kindness has ran out,\" was his only answer. Knowing not to argue, her eyes searched for the dilated picture Rudolf had brought over. From a distance, she saw the grinning men as not peaceful, carefree guys, but cynical, vicious beasts. \"Let's show Klaus what we found inside the envelopes,\" she suggested. The doctor still didn't reply, so Abby gestured him to the kitchen. She watched the various expressions fly over Klaus's face. The harder he concentrated, the more thankful she was that she'd revealed everything to him. Not only was there a weight lifted off of her back, but it seemed like Klaus deserved to know something this important. So maybe one day, their tainted trust could filter out and only the good would remain. When Klaus glanced up at her, she realized he'd said something. \"Huh?\" \"The address is probably where this picture was taken,\" he deduced. Fighting back the urge to glance at Heiter, Abby moved closer to him. \"I've also thought about trying to find Ivan. Sarah claims there were two men involved in my dad's murder. Either he was one of those men, or he too stood by just as his wife did. Although, it's difficult to believe considering it's my father who murdered his brother.\" \"You've got this figured out, haven't you?\" Shrugging, Abby leaned her hip against the table. \"Now that a lot of things are out in the open, I think I can understand what happened. It all started with Luca's murder spree in the early 90's. Which explains the newspaper clippings. After the near catch in 93', Luca terrified the country with a few more murders before heading off to theUnited States. Most likely an elongated vacation.\" \"Your father would have known instantly,\" Heiter spoke up. \"If his claimed intelligence truly lives up to your words, he would know.\" Nodding, Abby's eyes strayed to Heiter. \"So my dad kills him, nonethewiser. He's always killed those who take away innocent lives from other people. But he wasn't counting on Luca's family to be so wound together. Either Jonas or Ivan found out about his disappearance and discovered what had become of him. How they came to know that, is still a mystery, but nothing I'm willing to stay focused on.\" \"They approach Steffan because they don't want their intentions known. And see Steffan as a clueless pawn in their scheme. Steffan contacts your father and lures him toGermany,\" Klaus replied. \"During the trip,\" Abby answered back, body buzzing with the information, \"they make their presence known to my father. Probably say something to make him leave Steffan's comfort - considering the man was beginning to get suspicious after a month. And then...\" \"Perhaps he survives the initial encounter,\" Heiter surmised. \"But understands he will not live to see you grow up. He sends the postcard while he still has the chance.\" \"He knew I'd be smart enough to understand it,\" she mused. Scanning the envelopes on the table, Abby felt like she was still missing something. The photo of her dad for one, seemed random as well as the address. If they already connected what happened, why the need for the extra items? Keepsakes? I already know. I'm just not admitting it. And Abby did know. Because behind that relief at discovering what happened, lay an intense urge to retaliate. To ravish and plunder and murder and tear apart the man responsible for ruining a family. Then again, he probably sees us equal now. Dad takes away one of his family members, so he takes away one of mine. But she remembered what her dad would say. \"These men here, Labyrintha, are meant to be here. Whether it was through action or aggression or situation. These men have done something and we get to try to figure out how they tick.\" And then again, her mother. \"They're not really people, Abby.\" Sure, Ivan or whoever did murder her dad, felt justified. But they are denying also the horror their own brother brought upon the world. And the fact that Gregory's actions just took away one scumbag from the world. Did she want revenge? Yes. She wanted it desperately . The more she thought of her mother's descent into substance abuse and depression, the more the answer became clear. She didn't just have her life invaded by some external force, she had it sucked away - never to be returned again. And there was not enough sympathy in her heart to override that sort of deceit. \"What's on your mind, Abby?\" Klaus wondered, noting the flexing of her features. For a moment, the blonde stared at the address on the table. Her gaze was so fixed she thought she'd never be able to release it. \"Nothing you'll approve of,\" she finally answered. \"If you want revenge on Ivan, just hold it back.\" Clenching her jaw, Abby's eyes focused on Klaus's in frustration. \"Had you the chance to go one on one with the bastards who murdered your father, I know you would. This isn't up for discussion. I will find Ivan and see if he's responsible for what happened. And then-.\" Klaus's eyes flung to Heiter's. \"Talk her out of this,\" he insisted. Heiter stared at Abby curiously. He didn't say anything for an incredibly long minute. \"It is her decision to make. Sarah placed the photographs and address inside the envelopes on purpose. She understood that Abby might want revenge. If she was willing to give up her husband's location, this means a part of her thought him just as deserving to die.\" Klaus remained silent, but his disbelief soon turned into worry. \"So that's what you're going to do?\" he said, advancing on the blonde. \"You're going to find him and kill him?\" \"Yes,\" she determinedly answered, \"especially if he's responsible for Steffan's murder.\" \"But-.\" \"Klaus…I want you behind me on this, not because it's murder, but because we both know it's right. A part of you has got to feel that sense of justice coursing through you. Not a justice where the killers are never found and are left to throw the world into chaos, but where they are killed before they can tear apart another person's family. Please, tell me you understand that.\" His worry turned into hesitancy. \"As a doctor-.\" \"Same as him,\" Abby gestured to Heiter, \"and he's one hundred percent for this. I won't go into the details regarding why, but he understands to a degree, my need to have this man or anyone associated with the murder, dead.\" Glancing between the two, Klaus sighed before wearily rubbing a hand through his hair. \"Or you could leave,\" Heiter suggested, his voice taking on a coldness Abby hadn't heard before. \"If this task takes away so much from your pride, I will happily take Abby to find Ivan myself.\" Slightly confused, Abby looked at Heiter, but the doctor was staring unblinkingly at the psychiatrist. After a second entirely too tense for Abby, Klaus let out a quick chuckle. \"Are you ready, Abby?\" His words were a challenge, but the blonde couldn't determine for what. Still, she offered a nod in reply. Whatever his sudden interest was, she ceased to care. The man who might have murdered her dad, sat in wait somewhere in the country. Nothing else mattered than his death. Hope you enjoyed that chapter. There are undertones to the character's actions, but I'm not going to explain them. I'll leave them up to you to decide.

I would have never been this far without you guys. Thank you and enjoy! Chapter 18 - Risky Rendezvous Abby tried not to notice the new found tension between Klaus and Heiter, even when both men were doing an ill job of conceiving it. She offered to sit in the back seat of Heiter's car to get some rest, but the decision to do so seemed premature. The two glared every so often at each other like they were on opposite sides of a cage, ready to rip each others throat out. She felt like she should have a tazor in hand, just in case. \"Show your teeth any longer and the spit will start flying,\" Abby sighed with closed eyes. Even the air indicated the thick atmosphere in the vehicle. Neither said a word. Klaus had called Jakob back at the house to see if they were able to contact Ivan in Prague. Now that Rudolf had kindly retreated from the project, Jakob was their only source of information. Fortunately, Jakob had gotten word Ivan had entered the country at least five days ago. Unfortunately, this made him far more difficult to track down. Since he'd been able to fool his workplace into thinking he was still in Prague, his location was virtually unknown unless he used a credit card. Abby desperately hoped the address Sarah had left would produce the man. They were heading north again, far further than Neuruppin. Two hours and a half to a farm just outside of Grimmen. Enough time for Abby to properly rethink her options. I know I want whoever is responsible, dead...but would I be able to kill them? She tried not to answer, but the question was important. If she had the gun pointed at the man who murdered her dad, would she be able to take the life? Knowingly? As a result of a crime having occurred 12 years ago? Wasn't there a rule about forgiving and forgetting? Grimacing, she squeezed her eyes tighter and settled for making herself pass out. Anything to keep back the sudden regret she was having at her course of actions. The next time she awoke, Klaus was gently prodding her shoulder. With a tired mumble, Abby's eyes fluttered open as she observed their scenery. \"The car won't run forever,\" he noted listlessly, gesturing at Heiter who was currently filling it up with gas. In his hand, he offered her a muffin. \"Hmm,\" she laughed, fingers wrapping around the blueberry treat, \"I love this snack. I always feel like I'll have a heart attack afterward, but I find it's worth it. Thank you.\" Klaus nodded, seating himself beside her. In the distance, thunder sounded like multiple feet scurrying across an ancient ceiling, ready to give out. Abby hungrily bit into the muffin, grinning at the sugary sweetness riding a roller coaster through her mouth. \"Have you pondered over what you want to do?\" he softly questioned. Taking in the man's grim features, Abby laid her head down on his shoulder and ate the last bite of the muffin. He didn't disapprove of her action, almost seemed comforted by it in fact. \"I have to kill him.\" \"Abby-.\" \"That's my decision. Whether this vengeance would always reveal itself, or it was just hiding, I'm not sure. But I will not allow the man to walk in this world alive anymore.\" A heavy, clear drop slammed against the windshield, startling the blonde for a moment. \"Maybe you inherited this thirst for vengeance based on your time in captivity,\" Klaus quietly offered. Abby lifted her head off his shoulder and stared at him with a firmly set jaw. \"Don't you dare think I'm like him,\" she threatened. \"You should know better.\" Klaus met her stare with a hardened one of his own. \"Do not tell me what I should know. You are choosing murder as opposed to reason. That decision will be on your hands.\" \"And I am perfectly fine with that, Klaus. Whether that's my dad's mannerisms or Heiter's or the Queen of England's, who knows? But I am fine with that.\" He continued his stare and when Abby couldn't levelly relay her point again, she huffed. \"I'm going to the bathroom.\" Before he could reply, she flung open the car door and slipped outside. Heiter stood beside the car, eyes scanning her, and then back inside. \"Problem?\" \"No,\" she argued. \"Just have to go to the bathroom.\" She didn't wait for his response before entering the gas station - a small, 7/11 type establishment. When her business was done, Abby strolled down the only aisle of the station. Her eyes glanced toward the entertainment magazines, wondering who'd gotten married or divorced since her capture. \"-not know, but the house is being investigated.\" Abby's eyes froze. The German processed through her mind rapidly, instilling an immediate anxiety. I know that voice. Carefully, she peeked through her bangs at the figure standing by the counter. He spoke into a walkie hanging at his side, spit flying through his inflection. That's one of the detectives that were at Heiter's house. Only when she ran a nervous hand through her hair, did Abby realize she looked different. Almost unrecognizable. It'd be a miracle if he could pinpoint me. Still, when she urged her feet to move, she did so slowly and with great trepidation. The last thing she needed was for attention to be called to her. She walked past the counter with a careless frown, nodding at the man behind it before taking the final few steps through the ringing door. Only when she reached the car, did she visibly relax. \"What happened in there?\" Klaus asked as soon as she slipped inside. \"You looked tense.\" \"One of the detectives at your house,\" she murmured, eyes flickering to the rear view mirror. \"You handled it well,\" Heiter said, starting up the car. \"Let's just get out of here.\" APHAPHAPHAPH This time, Abby managed the entire back seat for a makeshift bed. Slightly uncomfortable, but it did the job. And back into her dreams she traveled. A part of her hoped for an answer to the dilemma she faced. Should she kill a man who took something from her first? Or could the deed be settled with letting it go? But logic and reason ceases to matter in the dream world. Instead, she dreamed of the oddest thing. A great, massive, roaring lion sat perched upon the street of her childhood home. After a long moment of a mixture of gawking and taking it in, Abby approached the beast without caution. It seemed there was an unspoken agreement between the two of a harmless encounter. Night had long ago settled down upon them and only the street lamps offered a visual glimpse at the events unfolding. With a blink of its long, magnificent lashes, the golden animal knelt from its former perch and placed its paws over its nose, as if having just inhaled something odorous. Abby laughed at the display before coming to stand before it. For some reason, she felt like the lion was submitting to her from the position. And this made her feel uncomfortable. So, she knelt down and sat Indian style before it. She could feel the fuming oxygen sputter from the lion's nose and into her fingers. The sensation tickled and a feeling of renewed calm entered her. \"You are a very peculiar lion,\" this dream version of her admitted. \"And you are a peculiar human,\" the lion answered lazily, hardly moving his jaws. \"How so? I am very normal.\" \"The beauty is your lack of understanding for events to come.\" Abby tilted her head at this. Another strange thing was the disappearance of her blonde hair. Her old, auburn locks reached down to just below her chest. \"I don't understand.\" The lion didn't reply right away. Instead, its furry mane tilted up toward the sky. Abby followed the motion and watched in awe as the navy black sky above them ceased to exist. In its place, a coating of pink drizzled across, like it'd been squeezed out of a tube of frosting. \"I greatly enjoy this time,\" the lion acknowledged. \"The time of great change.\" \"What changes besides the sky and stars?\" \"The fate of those who depend on the sky and stars,\" he answered prophetically. \"Does mine?\" \"No. You are of the few with the option of lucid control.\" \"It doesn't feel like it,\" Abby muttered. They watched the sky edge into a new dawn, a dazzling warm fuscia covering every edge of the ceiling above. \"Who can determine fate?\" she asked after a long moment of gazing up. \"We are all so small and fragile in the conquering timeline of our lives.\" \"You can.\" Before she could glance back at the lion, a sudden jolt woke her. With a discontent sigh, Abby's eyes traveled open only to find gray woods speeding by. She lay in the position for awhile, not wanting to be detected. As far as strange dreams were concerned, that one ranked pretty high. Its origin and meaning had various interpretations, none of which she felt divulging into. She was looking for an answer to murder, not her fate in some riddled lion. \"Who can determine fate?\" \"You can.\" The words came back to her in a haunted demeanor, begging to be deciphered. Never eating a German muffin again. But despite the jab, she couldn't keep away the dream even when they finally entered Grimmen. APHAPHAPHAPHAPH \"Its got to be at least 200 acres,\" Abby surmised, eyes raking over the plain. They'd found the farm quite easily and took a parking spot far from the house's view. That way, they'd have the element of surprise for a moment. After fifteen minutes of walking, the trio's journey ended just a few feet short of the quaint farmhouse. No car sat in the driveway, but the Kappel's property stretched at least a hundred feet each way. The man could easily have found shelter somewhere else. \"Ready for this?\" Klaus asked, extending a hand. Abby glanced away from the scenery and into the psychiatrist's eyes. For a moment, they were focused behind her toward Heiter. But before she could analyze the gaze, all of the forest green was fixated back on her. \"Sure,\" she answered, placing her hand in his. The contact didn't bother her, nor his suggestion about her becoming like Heiter. Such things couldn't be fretted over in her state of mind right now. Not when only one thing mattered. Hand in hand, with Heiter falling in step behind, the trio approached the farm house. No livestock littered the area and Abby guessed they'd sold them long ago. Perhaps because they were going bankrupt? Or maybe they had no use for this farm anymore? \"Did you see that?\" she suddenly paused, eyes squinted on the nearest window to them. They stood only twenty feet from the small structure. \"What?\" Klaus whispered. \"I thought I saw-.\" Her voice dropped as they all observed the black shadow quickly stalking across the inside room before disappearing. They all pulled away from the window. As of yet, the figure inside wasn't aware of their presence. It'd do well for them to keep it that way. Abby slowly released Klaus's hand and began a stomp toward the door. It lay at a comfortable position away from the window, unseen except from an outside vantage. \"Abby.\" Unsure which man called her name, Abby turned to them with barely held back frustration. \"What?\" As soon as her attention was on them, each man revealed a weapon. She recognized Heiter's gun, but was surprised to see Klaus sporting one as well. \"Did I not get the memo or something?\" she asked in slight puzzlement. \"I will take the back entrance,\" Heiter relayed. \"The door we observed as we first approached.\" \"I'll be beside you,\" Klaus vowed. \"If Ivan decides to get agitated, I'll be there to protect you.\" \"I don't need your protection,\" she bit back. \"And I thought you weren't for using violence.\" Klaus gave a shrug. \"Your words stuck with me. And to send you to the front door, unarmed, is a bad idea.\" \"There's another door just on the other side of this one,\" she indicated. \"Watch that one.\" \"And leave you alone? I'm not doing that.\" \"Don't worry, I'll be fine. Just guard the doors so he can't leave.\" \"Abby-.\" \"Klaus-.\" \"Will both of you shut up?\" Abby's gaze fell to Heiter, surprised at the sudden outburst. \"You claimed to only answer to Abby's orders,\" the doctor began, glaring at Klaus. \"Do as she says.\" It only took a few moments for Klaus to concede, but not before throwing an equally dirty look back at Heiter. \"I'll knock on the door. He hears it, panics...most likely, he'll spring for one of the two exits,\" she explained. \"Both of you will be covering them.\" Heiter nodded, and Klaus finally did the same. \"Go!\" she quietly gestured. The two went their opposite ways while Abby turned to the door. It was a chipped, wooden board straight out of a 50's home catalogue. Cheery, bright, but very misplaced in their green environment. It appeared like it'd done some hard times, maybe nearly flung off a few times due to someone's anger. With a calm breath, Abby prepared herself. Worst case scenario? Ivan was the killer and had a gun on her. I've got to at least ask why. I think that's also bothering me. From the way Sarah made it sound, someone tortured dad for a long, long time before killing him. Someone who enjoyed it like a leisure activity as opposed to revenge. Keeping her fist steady, Abby threw her knuckles down once on the door, then twice. She kept telling herself not to panic or make any sudden movement. This is where all of those months and years of depression and confusion would finally end. This was the place. So she waited. And waited. And continued to wait, ears struggling to pick up something. And that's when she heard the shot ring out. Like a voluminous blast, rustling the nearby birds into the sky. Stilling, Abby's ears tried to pick out the side of the house the shot had come from. Either Heiter or Klaus had released their guns. Or maybe Ivan. She hesitated to raise her voice, but the continued silence fried her nerves. A scurry of footsteps suddenly pounded inside, followed by an angry yell and then the sound of glass breaking. Immediately, Abby sprinted to the front of the house. In the window furthest from her, Ivan was stumbling out head first, glass shards on the dirt below him. Not in a million years could she figure out why she didn't try to apprehend him. Just a few feet was all she needed to go. But Abby stood there like a gawking teenager. She wanted to see the man's face. To see the expression on it. To see his reaction to her. All of this unfolded in a very quick time period and she was still frozen in place when Ivan finally reached his feet. He glanced up at her, then briefly fled backward. \"You,\" she mumbled, just loud enough for him to be heard. The man pushed off the house and sprang past her. Abby, however, needed no more time to think. Within seconds, she sprinted off after him. A yell follwed behind her, but she couldn't determine whose it was. Her legs pumped instead as hard as they could, attempting to cover the ground Ivan had gotten on her. There was no plan of what she'd do once she got to him, but one thing was clear. He could not escape. Because she knew. Just a split second before he took off, his eyes had met hers. In them, she witnessed the knowledge she'd craved to know a hell of a long time ago. Ivan was the man who had murdered her dad. Call it instinct, intuition, or some unknown inner sense, but of this fact, she was sure. It was when his face had contorted into fear, and then in a triumphant smirk - that's when she knew she wanted him dead. \"Abby!\" a bellow came. The blonde only sprinted ahead faster. She was unprepared, however, for Ivan to briefly turn behind with a gun held loosely in one hand. His finger pulled the trigger back at the same exact moment she ducked to the ground. The bullet whizzed over her head as Abby's lungs screamed for more oxygen. But as soon as she glanced up and saw how far he'd gotten, she forced herself after him again. Only when he entered the woods, some one hundred feet away from the farmhouse, did she realize he had an advantage over her. He knew the area. She had a fairly athletic endurance, but Ivan's exploration of the area suited him. He was able to take cuts she just hardly managed not to run past. Worse still, the trunks blocked his form well. \"Abby!\" Her feet dug into the dirt, and finally halted. Pants flew through her lips at a rate matching that of her heart beat. Head whipping around the area, Abby brushed angrily at the bangs pasted to her forehead. Somewhere between a thicket of trees and bushes, she had lost the man. \"Ivan!\" she screamed, feeling the veins pulse out of her neck. A few birds scurried out of their nests at her yell, but otherwise, the woods remained stubbornly quiet. \"Ivan!\" she tried again, this time with a little less hope. The same silence greeted her. \"I will find you,\" she loudly vowed, spinning around. \"And rest assured I will kill you for what you did to my dad! Do you hear me?\" Her voice echoed back to her, frightening a few more animals. But no human voice came back. It took five minutes before she finally admitted Ivan had gotten away. Perhaps the only time she'd ever be face to face with him. With a shaky hand, Abby brushed back her bangs. A laugh broke through her lips, but there was nothing amusing about it. In fact, it made her feel ten years older and a hell of a lot more bitter. \"Abby.\" Sucking in a breath, the blonde girl turned to where her voice was called. \"He got away,\" she tried to explain, arms shaking. Heiter took another step forward. \"If I would have thought to bring a gun-,\" she muttered, closing her eyes. \"Are you hurt?\" he asked. Shaking her head, Abby's eyes sprang open. \"No. The bullet went over my head.\" The doctor nodded slowly. At his further lack of words, Abby glanced behind him quizzically. \"Where's Klaus?\" APHAPHAPHAAPH She patted the man's sweaty forehead with a cool, white cloth. \"Keep pressure on your abdomen,\" she instructed, keeping her voice free of the anxiety she was feeling. Klaus nodded, but already, his eyes were set on staying closed. \"Heiter went to get the car. We'll get you to the Grimmen hospital.\" One of Klaus's bloodied hands shook, and Abby grasped it within hers. Now that the vengeance phase had passed, her concern was able to overwhelm everything else. According to Heiter, when she had knocked on the door, Ivan couldn't figure out which one it was. Three doors to choose from. At random, he chose the door Klaus was behind and took a shot through it. The bullet ripped clean through the wood and into Klaus's stomach. After the injured man had made a noise and Heiter attempted to charge his way through, he reasoned the last door was guarded as well and made for the window. The rest was left for Abby to fill in. \"You're fine,\" she assured, her voice growing soft. \"They'll be able to fix you up in no time.\" Klaus's eyes were wide and another brutal shake forced her eyes closed. It's my fault he's like this. I should have told him not to come. Told him he couldn't come. \"I'm sorry,\" Abby said, brushing a hand through his brunette locks. \"I'm so sorry, Klaus.\" \"Don't blame-,\" he choked out, shaking his head. Feeling the fever start up, Abby lowered her head over his. The very ends of her bangs touched his heated forehead. \"Closer,\" he indicated, breaths coming out as wheezes. Making sure he was keeping pressure on his stomach, Abby leaned further down. Before she could pull away, Klaus's lips gently found hers. The kiss wasn't meant to be mind blowing or passionate, but Abby kissed back all the same. Through his lips, she could feel his nerves. The hot breath. But just as well, she felt his tongue trace her lower lip and realized this meant so much more for him. For that, she continued the kiss until they both had to come up for air. \"Thank you,\" Klaus said, giving her a weak smile. And that was all he was able to get out for a long time. There you have it. Eight chapters left. Let me know your thoughts in a review![Chapter 19] On we go! Luckily, this one is lengthy...or perhaps some of you hate this story and only review to give me false hope. Ah well. Thank you for the review! Enjoy! Chapter 19 - This Tragedy \"He is doing well. In surgery right now,\" Heiter relayed, sitting himself down beside her. Abby nodded, not really hearing the words. Guilt overrode everything else she could feel. They'd entered Grimmen Hospital not even a full hour ago, carrying Klaus's limp form from the car through the downpour. He'd passed out for a final time on the way there and wouldn't wake no matter how many times Abby demanded him to. Everyone inside the emergency room shouted German at her, but she was too distracted to speak it back. So Heiter handled translations. Now that she'd gotten the prognosis, she was far more at ease. Unfortunately, it remained clear that she was at fault. If not for her, Klaus wouldn't have a bullet lodged in his stomach. \"You should clean yourself off,\" Heiter suggested a few minutes later. \"I'm not leaving him.\" Her eyes met his and she saw the frustration there at her defiance. But there was something else as well. Something she hadn't seen before. \"Are you actually concerned about Klaus?\" she asked, a reluctant grin sprouting. Heiter frowned before glancing away. \"My concern is not for him.\" Further studying of his features caused Abby's grin to fall. \"Clean yourself off,\" he said, far softer this time. Blowing out a breath, Abby stood. An ache crawled through her thighs and down to her calves. Running after Ivan had reawoke muscles she hadn't used in a long, long time. In the morning, she was sure the soreness would spread to her entire lower body. \"Fine,\" she conceded. \"But if anything changes, you tell me.\" With his nod, Abby removed herself from the hallway and into the nearest bathroom. She had a lot of blood to wash out of her clothes. APHAPHAPHAPH Three hours later and she was locked in a heated argument with her former captor outside of what would be Klaus's room. \"Fine, go back to Berlin! But I am not leaving him alone.\" \"Do you really think Ivan will wait until Klaus is alright?\" She bit back her next words, fists clutched at her sides. \"I'm the reason he's in the hospital. I'm not going to leave him, not when we-.\" Her gaze fell down, but the anger did not retreat. \"You go back for the night. Pick me up in the morning.\" Heiter gave her a withering glare before narrowing his eyes. \"Remember why you came here,\" he spat. \"Not for some little boy.\" \"What has he done to make you hate him so much?\" she sputtered back, stepping into his comfort zone. \"His childish antics kept us from attaining Ivan.\" \"He was shot! It's not like he knew the bullet would go through the door.\" The surgeon tensed, before finally retreating. But not happily. \"If not tomorrow, then forget about ever finding your father's murderer,\" he darkly determined. \"Fine,\" she just about yelled back. And that was how they left each others presence. It was the first big argument they'd indulged in in what seemed forever. Abby had been so focused on solving the mystery, she'd completely forgotten how at peace their relationship had gotten. \"Abby.\" Glancing up from between her hands, the blonde scanned for the source of the voice. A nurse stood with a cot before her and snuggled inside was Klaus - exhausted, but alive. \"Oh thank God,\" she muttered, rising to her feet. \"How are you feeling?\" \"Like I've been shot.\" Letting out a quick laugh, Abby's forehead scrunched. \"How long are you going to be in here?\" Klaus glanced up at the nurse behind him, a heavyset woman in her mid 50's, before meeting her eyes. \"They claim three months with physical therapy, but I'm guessing maybe a month.\" She moved out of the way as the nurse rolled him into the new room. Only when Klaus's voice called her back in and the nurse had left, did Abby oblige. She shut the door quietly before approaching him with the slightest of caution. Physically observing him made the guilt weigh in that much deeper. \"What time is it?\" Klaus asked, sensing her nervousness. \"Just after two in the morning.\" \"You should get some sleep.\" \"Klaus-.\" \"Abby, don't.\" Sighing, she crossed her arms in resignation. \"I went with you willingly,\" he argued. \"I knew the dangers involved. Don't blame yourself.\" \"But-.\" \"Surgery is all done and I'll recover in a month. That's a fairly good outcome compared to what could have happened.\" Biting at her lip, Abby stepped toward the man. One hand reached out and he grasped the limb with a smile. For awhile, they simply held hands in silence. It was a drastic change from the constant action Abby's life had been thrown into in the past week. \"I'm leaving with Heiter tomorrow. We're going to try to locate Ivan. Don't know how...but I've got an idea.\" Klaus's lips fell into a frown, then opened as if he wanted to say something. \"What?\" she smiled. \"Still have a problem with me killing Ivan?\" \"Is he your father's killer?\" \"Yes...he is.\" \"Then I suppose all of my reasoning means nothing now. However, I do wonder-.\" When he didn't continue, Abby furrowed her brow in confusion. \"Wonder what?\" \"I-never mind. I'll talk about it in the morning. It's only the medicine keeping me from passing out right now.\" Releasing his hand, Abby backed away. \"I'll leave you to rest.\" \"Abby...will you stay?\" \"Of course. I'll bring one of the chairs in here and-.\" \"No,\" Klaus protested softly. Further confused, the blonde studied the injured psychiatrist for a long moment before her eyes lit up in understanding. \"Are you sure?\" \"If you don't have a problem with it.\" Abby thought back to the kiss and how far it would have gotten had Klaus not been injured. \"If it'll help you rest, I don't mind.\" She watched as he did his best to scoot over on to one side of the cot. The machines beeped as his heart rate increased, but after a few minutes of struggling, Klaus had managed to open a spot up beside him. Throwing a glance at the door, Abby hesitantly pulled herself atop the cot. She squeezed herself underneath the thin blankets before lowering her head on to the same pillow. Laying on her side was no issue since this was often the way she fell asleep. But facing Klaus's expressive green eyes was an entirely new experience. \"Your eyes look like a whole different world,\" she expressed quietly, thumb flicking her front teeth. \"My father had the same kind of eyes, but they were blue. My mom used to tell me everytime she looked at him, she had the sudden urge to go swimming.\" Grinning, Abby scanned Klaus's drowsy features. \"Does chasing after Ivan open up old wounds?\" \"None that can't be closed. Your constant pursuit makes me wish I would have done more,\" he admitted sullenly. \"Shh,\" she interrupted, placing a finger over his lips. \"You wanted an answer to what happened. What I want is something more complicated. Something I think you're too kind to ever do. Don't ever be sorry for that.\" Again, he wanted to say more, but the drugs finally weren't able to hold back the desire to sleep. So with her finger still over his lips, Klaus's eyes closed in submission. Abby brought back her finger, wondering what this detente between them met. Unlike Heiter, whose kindness was always for a greater reason or not entirely sincere, Klaus went out of his way to make her feel like she hadn't royally screwed things up. And the kiss as well as their current sleeping position, desperately made her want to explore the possibilities of what they were creating. However, Heiter's words did make sense as well. Although shouted out of anger, he did speak the truth. Abby came to Germany for her dad, not for a relationship. And no matter how strange and comforting her and Klaus's relationship was, ultimately, she'd drop it in a heartbeat if she had a chance to find Ivan. So, it was with a solemn resignation that Abby ran a stray finger through Klaus's shaggy hair. Here lay a man she got excited at just when he looked her way, but could not do anything about it. Or perhaps wouldn't let herself. Even if I wait for him to get better, Ivan could be continents away by that time. Or worse. Klaus could get hurt again. It was for the better, she decided. Following Klaus would lead her away from her initial goal, and she couldn't afford to become distracted when the margin for error remained so thin. \"Maybe in another life time,\" she whispered, fingers splayed over his cheek. Soon after, sleep indulged the blonde. APHAPHAPHAPH The last time Abby remembered being awakened by someone running a hand through her hair, it was during her childhood. She'd fall asleep during a movie on an old, lavender sofa and would wake up to the soft combing of her dad's fingers. Usually, this was a strictly maternal gesture, but her dad displayed peculiar habits around people and this one of comfort never ceased to make Abby snuggle in deeper into his side. When the same combing continued to run playfully through her hair and Abby's mind registered it did not belong to her dad, the blonde opened her eyes. \"I sometimes forget the beauty in people,\" Klaus mumbled, cool breath blowing over her face. \"Thank you for reminding me.\" She couldn't contain her smile at the kind words, nor her pleasure at the sensation. \"How long have we been out?\" \"Nurse came in about a half hour ago. Said it was 10:30 in the morning.\" Squeezing her eyes, Abby felt another calm shake coarse through her. \"How are you feeling?\" she asked, opening her eyes. \"I can move a bit more, but it still feels like I'm ripping my limbs open by doing so.\" Flinching, Abby's eyes attempted to fall into the same guilt of the night before, but Klaus gave a half shake of his head. \"Not your fault,\" he reminded. She remained quiet, content with the gesture. That is, until two things happened at once. One, Klaus's expression changed. Drastically. It went from relaxed to intense in a matter of seconds. She noted the shift directly after his eyes scanned over her lips. And he followed the shift by leaning his head closer across the pillow. Already during the night, they'd both found themselves involuntarily moving toward each other, bodies seeking the nearest heat source. So it would have been only mere centimeters the man had to lean in before their lips touched. And then, the second thing occurred. Abby thought it was the nurse who opened the door at first, but the lack of a voice threw her off. Reluctantly, she moved her head toward the entrance, only to find Heiter standing there. His completely emotionless stare almost seemed inhuman. Even when he'd held her in captivity, he had never displayed an expression so effortlessly blank. For a moment, she stayed frozen in place, unsure of what his next move would be. Only when he continued to stay firmly grounded, did Abby find the courage to say something. \"Sorry,\" she said, pulling herself up on one hand. \"I should have been ready to go earlier, but I just woke up.\" Klaus shifted beside her, attempting to sit up, but failing. His indifference did not dissipate and this made Abby all the more uncomfortable. Finally, both of his eyes closed for a second before reopening. His features regressed into a barely concealed politeness. \"Hurry up.\" The two words made her want to yell back at him, but time was of the essence. \"Okay. I'll be out in the hallway shortly,\" she promised. He took one last look at their position before retreating, shutting the door behind him. Abby let out a breath she hadn't known she was keeping in and pushed up into a seating position. She was ready to slip out of the bed when Klaus reached out and grabbed her arm. \"I need to tell you something before you go,\" he mentioned quickly. \"Something I feel like you have to know.\" Surprised, Abby slipped her arm out of his grip and pushed herself on to the floor. Just as she'd predicted, her entire lower body tingled painfully at the action. \"What?\" she asked curiously, facing him. Klaus watched her for awhile, eyebrows in a straight line. \"You appear like you're well equipped with studying emotions,\" he finally admitted. \"Something I inherited from my dad,\" she agreed. \"Have you ever taken any psychology classes?\" Unsure where he was going, Abby said, \"In college, I took an intro class and an advanced placement. Just to make sure I knew what I was seeing and talking about.\" Nodding, Klaus grimaced as he tried again at pulling himself up into a sitting position. When Abby was ready to ask if he needed help, the man succeeded with a pained sigh. \"Do you need me to get the nurse?\" \"No, no, I'm fine. I need to have this conversation before you leave, most likely forever.\" Fighting back the urge to frown, Abby bit at her lip. \"What are the chances of it being forever?\" she asked. \"I know you want to go home,\" he pointed out. \"You've been in this country for nearly six months.\" Shrugging, Abby met Klaus's green stare. \"So, continue on.\" Klaus glanced down at his knees for a moment, eyes calculative. \"In your psychology courses, had they ever discussed a mental disorder called Syndromia?\" Furrowing her brow, the blonde crossed her arms. \"Not that I remember. What is it?\" The psychiatrist brought his gaze back to hers, but the warmness had seemed to seep out of his eyes. Just as he was ready to reply, a bang sounded through the door. \"I'll be out in a few minutes!\" she shouted. The banging ceased. Turning back, Abby sighed. \"Now...what is Syndromia?\" \"Not many specialists acknowledge its existence because of how little amount of cases there are to study it. But it is a situation that may happen more frequently than realized. During an instance of kidnapping-.\" As soon as the word kidnapping was out of Klaus's mouth, Abby's eyes narrowed. \"If this is some Stockholm Syndrome bullshit you're going to subject me through, I'll leave without even saying goodbye. I swear I'll do it.\" Before he had a chance to reply, Abby backed further away from him. \"From the moment Heiter had me in that basement, I made sure to never become a victim. In every fucking sense of the word, Klaus. I made sure not to depend on him until it was necessary to survive. I made sure to never form a bond or attachment. If you think-.\" \"Abby,\" he interrupted harshly, then softened his voice, \"I know you don't have Stockholm Syndrome. If you did, you would have never left his home. You are far too self sufficient.\" She relaxed slightly at his words. \"Syndromia is different.\" \"And you feel like I need to know what it is?\" \"Yes,\" he stated. \"Yes I do.\" \"Okay...go ahead.\" \"From what I learned, Syndromia is like a reverse case of Stockholm Syndrome.\" Confused, Abby felt her mind latch on to the information. Anytime knowledge about the human psyche was presented to her, she couldn't help but feel a sort of devotion to understand its origin. \"Explain.\" \"In Stockholm Syndrome, the patient forms an attachment to their captor. Sees their captor's decision to keep them alive as an act of love. And over time, as the kidnapped victim becomes more at ease with their captor, their bond becomes stricter. Nearly to the point where each terrible thing their captor does, the victim is able to find a counteractive excuse for it.\" Abby nodded, thinking over the most famous case. The case that first termed the phrase in Sweden back in the 90's. \"When the gunmen were finally found,\" she recalled, \"the victims payed for the trial.\" \"You understand this then?\" \"Of course.\" \"Well...Syndromia is what happens to the captor in the case of their victim remaining independent.\" Puzzled, Abby said, \"In what way?\" \"It starts with the captor clearly seeing their victim's refusal to bend to their whim.\" \"Doesn't the captor simply kill the victim if they get like this?\" \"That's what distinguishes Syndromia. Throughout this time process, as the victim keeps their own sense of control, the captor observes it and becomes in a sense, attracted to it. Of course it all depends on the person. Too much defiance or incorrigibility and the victim is easily killed as you mentioned. However, in the rare cases, the captor's motives for keeping the victim start to subtly shift. Outwardly, they may still threaten the victim's life or make it seem like their days are numbered, but on the inside, they are slowly becoming not only attracted to their victim, but in a sense, obsessive. This continuous spiral may ultimately change the reason why the captor had kidnapped their victim in the first place.\" Abby slowed down Klaus's words, attempting to make sense of them. \"So...if some crazy guy kidnapped a girl and intended to kill her, Syndromia would force him to...become attracted to her and decide not to kill her?\" \"It's a bit more complex than that. The captor doesn't even realize this shift is occurring. They justify their actions not to kill or harm their victim as nothing more than mercy. All the while, the attraction becomes intense and undying.\" Hesitantly, the blonde tugged at her lower lip before releasing it. \"Why are you telling me about this?\" she asked, eyes fixed on his. Klaus exhaled carefully. \"Because I think Heiter has been in the process of experiencing Syndromia for quite awhile now.\" Nothing could have prepared her for the words. Absolutely not one single, fucking thing. Abby just stood there, not believing the explanation. \"He doesn't,\" she argued. \"I mean sure, he definitely doesn't hate me as much as he used to, but that hardly means anything.\" The brunette studied her features further, contemplating his words. \"Abby...you may not see it because you're so distracted about what's going on, but Heiter has formed an entirely unhealthy attachment to you.\" \"Klaus-.\" \"And before you go off on me, let me explain. I noticed his behavior around and toward you even before you informed me of the actual events that took place. On purpose, I acted out certain demonstrations just to gouge his reaction.\" \"Like what?\" she asked in disbelief. \"Holding your hand before we entered Ivan's home. Standing closer to you than needed. Looking at you. Being more possessive toward you than he initially was.\" Her disbelief morphed into hurt. \"So you acted like you liked me to prove a theory?\" \"No,\" he argued, fighting to leave his sitting position. \"No. Everything I initiated, every contact, was intentional. Because I enjoyed being around you. But I couldn't help studying Heiter's reaction either. To see if I was right so I could warn you.\" Huffing, Abby shook her head. \"Warn me about what?\" she asked with a dangerously low voice. \"About what his Syndromia could turn into,\" he indicated forcefully. \"All of the results with the few studies we had, were not a good outcome for the victim. Most of them were never seen again.\" \"How could you possibly think he has Syndromia? He. Doesn't. Like. Me.\" \"You're the first person he's going to hide it from,\" Klaus bit back. \"Whenever I stood near you, there was a split second of fury on his face. When I took your hand, you didn't see his step forward to rip it away. You don't see it because you're distracted. No one blames you for that. But the man does not act toward you like he should. That initial hate he had in the beginning, should have resulted in your death numerous times. I hate to say this, but it's the truth. Haven't you wondered why he hadn't killed you for having the wrong blood type? Or saving your friends? Or kissing him? The way he's opened up to you, but refuses to anybody else, is not typical of a captor-captive relationship. If these aren't the exact symptoms I learned about, then I don't know what the hell is going on. But I am giving you this warning, Abby. Heiter cares for you far deeper than you do for him. And you know how dangerously intelligent he is. Eventually, something will shift in your relationship. Unfortunately, I can't say it will be in your favor.\" Inhaling a few careful breaths, Abby met Klaus's eyes. \"I appreciate your attempt at diagnosing him,\" she voiced softly. \"When in captivity, I attempted to do the exact same thing. In fact, I nearly drove myself crazy just deciphering why he did what he did. But Klaus...Syndromia? Really? I would have noticed some sort of change.\" \"Your case is entirely different. Probably the first of its kind. No longer are you two restricted to one setting. He is forced to put his trust in you, hoping the same will be given in return. The change in your relationship has come so subtly you probably haven't given much thought to it. And if you have, you most likely attribute it to him having a good day. But it is there.\" Rolling back her shoulders, the blonde glanced at the door. \"Logically, Klaus. That's what I'm looking at. You weren't there the night he held that gun to my head. If I would not have opened my eyes, he would have easily killed me. The thing that you confuse as Syndromia, is nothing but his hate receding for the time being. Yes, we have gotten more used to each other. But I'm leaving after Ivan is found and Heiter has absolutely no qualms of stopping me. He was even the first one to suggest it. I do appreciate your time at explaining this, but you're mistaken. Maybe I haven't explained the events that took place between us greatly enough. He hates being responsible for me, even more, when I make him do something completely foreign from how he usually acts. I know these symptoms first hand. What he's feeling right now is probably nothing more than confusion as to why I'm not dead yet and irritation about me not having said goodbye to you quickly.\" Abby could sense Klaus wanted to continue the discussion, perhaps even have mentioned it the night before, but she was completely sure of her viewpoint. The truth was, Klaus wasn't in her shoes during Heiter's phases of malignant anger and chaotic insanity. There was no way he could diagnose the man's actions in just a few days, with something she'd never heard of, much less witnessed the symptoms to. Not just that, but Heiter didn't feel those kind of things. As childish as it was, Abby still believed the doctor to be somewhat asexual. \"I'm sorry I couldn't convince you then,\" Klaus said, frowning. \"And I'm sorry we have to part like this.\" \"Klaus...,\" she paused, \"I'm glad I met you. If not for your leads, I'd have never discovered everything that I have so far.\" His frown switched directions. \"You're making me sound like an old man.\" Grinning, Abby shrugged. \"I think we're both a bit older than our ages give us credit for.\" He nodded in agreement. \"Thank you. Maybe someday after all of this chaos, we'll meet again.\" Instead of the smile she expected, Klaus's features turned forlorn. He glanced at the door, then back at her. \"I know you don't want to discuss it any longer, but I just want to mention...the expression on his face when he came in and saw us laying in the cot together...had you ever seen that before?\" Despite the instinct not to, Abby found herself remembering the completely naked expression. \"No,\" she said. \"I haven't. But I've only known him for a minimal portion of his life. I'm sure he reacted the same way when his fiance-.\" She stopped herself just in time, shocked at the words that were ready to leave her mouth. C'mon, say them. Say them and get this awkwardness over with. Blinking, one of her thumbs brushed at her jeans. When his fiance cheated on him. But saying it inside her head did nothing to cover up the actual comparison. \"Goodbye,\" she said. When Klaus voiced his, she pretended not to have heard it. She couldn't afford to no matter how adamant he was about his observation. I know why I came to Germany. The events unfolding within people's lives are not things for me to become involved in. She squelched the voice that asked if she hadn't already done just that. APHAPHAPHAPH They rode back in silence. That was the only way Abby could describe the drive. No words, no exchanges. Just silence. She was too tired to start up a conversation about Ivan's whereabouts, and too busy trying to pry away Klaus's words. It was no surprise that by the time they'd reached the capital city, Abby was ready to have a long, clean shower. \"Have you any theories of Ivan's whereabouts?\" she asked as he turned on to the house's driveway. \"None circumstantial,\" he admitted formally. Relaxing at his coldness, Abby studied her knees. Some of Klaus's blood still stayed soaked inside of the jeans despite her harsh cleansing. \"Is it safe to assume the bullet shot into Klaus was the same found inside Steffan's body?\" Heiter stopped the vehicle and ripped out the keys. \"I would think so.\" \"Me too. The diameter on both of their abdomen areas were nearly identical. And Steffan nearly bled to death from that exact shot to his stomach. Most of Klaus's blood came from the same area as well.\" \"A multiple homicide murderer,\" Heiter commented. \"His death truly will not be grieved.\" Nodding, Abby placed a hand underneath her chin. \"I've got an idea,\" she finally announced. \"Actually, I've had it since last night. It's about where Ivan could be.\" \"Really?\" Gazing at him, Abby found herself containing a laugh at his expression. \"I'm not that stupid,\" she mumbled, hand over her mouth. \"I understand he's got a very huge jump on us and the chance that my idea is accurate, is slim at best. But...it has to do with the two objects we found in Sarah's envelopes. The two we hadn't yet used as a clue. In fact, at first, I thought they were just mementos Sarah had saved to remind me of my dad.\" \"The watch and the photo,\" he finished. \"Yes...I think she was trying to tell us something about Ivan. Something that he had in common with my dad.\" When she explained her theory, Heiter gave her such an astonished look she was convinced she'd recalled the square root of pi. \"You are really surprised at my ability to think today,\" she noticed, arms crossed as she studied him out of the corner of her eye. \"The task of you thinking never ceases to surprise me,\" he answered with a slight up turn of his lips. Again, Abby had to keep back her smile. This time, it was because of what Klaus had said. Is this our relationship becoming so at ease that I haven't even realized it? She punched the thought away, metaphorically yelling at it to never come back. There was simply no time. \"I'll shower later,\" Abby said when he gave her a hesitant scan. \"Then we will depart.\" With a flawless U-turn, Heiter maneuvered them back on to the road leading into Berlin. Note that Syndromia is not a real mental disorder. It was invented in my imagination. Let me know your thoughts in a review![Chapter 20] I can't believe I've got 20 chapters for this story. What's more? I've got 50 reviews! Thank you every single one of you for contributing to this story, even when it was at its worst. It means so, so much to me that readers could still be enthralled with a topic like this. It shows your brilliant open mindedness and your resolve with sticking to a story. Again, thank you so very very much! When I'm done with the story, you're all getting a handful of internet and an inclusion in my future Oscar speech (it'll happen, damn it! even if I'm dragged off the stage by force!). As always, another chapter for my beautiful readers. Enjoy! Chapter 20 - Unique Understandings Sentimental. This one word alone happened to be the basis of Abby's entire theory regarding Ivan's location. As they navigated through the busy traffic of afternoon Berlin, Abby found herself recalling their former conversation and hoping desperately, even if the possibility was narrow, that her theory proved accurate. Otherwise, everything she'd gone through in the past five months would mean absolutely nothing. And that loss was far too harsh to even consider bearing. \"I don't think Sarah sent us the Donald Duck watch and photo of my dad by the Spree River just for keepsakes',\" she had explained to Heiter in the dead silence of his car. \"Are you sure?\" \"No...but something about Ivan has been bugging me. The man had an extraordinarily opportune moment to leave the country and make sure I'd never find him. Instead, he kills Steffan, then retreats to his farm house in Grimmen.\" \"Perhaps it is stupidity?\" \"Killing Steffan wasn't stupidity. He wanted all of the loose ends sealed shut. And I could agree with you about him returning to the farm house. Especially if he thought Sarah might key us in about his location.\" At this, Heiter had stopped her with a hand. \"I do not believe Ivan knew we'd find him. With Sarah dead, he thought it just another loose end sealing itself. The farm house was safe.\" \"But there's still the fact that he went back to it. Could have easily retreated. Very easily, in fact. He doesn't. Why?\" He stared at her for a long moment, acknowledging the excitement in her features. \"Why?\" he asked. \"Because he's sentimental. Places and people mean something to him. The farm house is connected to a time of intense bliss and relaxation. Then Steffan. He carried out his death far longer than he had to. We both saw the blood stains lead through various areas of the house. Steffan must have been bleeding heavily for five minutes straight before reaching his room. His body had three bullet holes. Overkill.\" Heiter still seemed confused, but he inclined his head to show she had his attention. \"The Spree River,\" she mentioned. \"My dad stood in front of it, but we don't know who took the picture.\" \"Why would this area be of value for Ivan?\" \"Maybe the last place my dad was seen alive? I know in it, he didn't look pleased about the picture being taken. I don't think it had to do with the scenery, but rather the person taking it. For some reason, this place was of importance for Ivan.\" \"This is a very improbable idea.\" \"At least it's something,\" she argued. Sighing, Heiter rolled back his shoulders. \"And the watch?\" \"The watch,\" Abby explained. \"Again, could have been just a random keepsake. But...the arrows were stuck on 2:02. It could mean AM, or PM. I think the latter just because of the lighting when the picture was taken.\" \"Ivan took this picture of your father at 2:02 in the afternoon...so how does this explain his whereabouts?\" \"He's sentimental,\" she repeated with a sly grin. \"Before he leaves Germany for the final time, he'll want to come back to the same place. I'm betting he knew exactly what time period he'd taken the picture during and the area provides a source of excitement for him. Imagine having the photo of a man you know you're going to kill in a matter of hours, posed at a certain area? Once the person is dead, a part of you will want to return to that area. Maybe to remember what occurred or to get a sexual fix? Who knows. But the area is like a relic. One that I believe Ivan will go back to a final time before he runs for it.\" \"That is very risky to do,\" he commented, but not disbelievingly. \"Had we not had the photo and watch, you and I would be searching everywhere BUT a crowded street in the capital city. In fact, we'd assume he was long gone. But, we DO have the remaining two clues that haven't been used yet and Sarah was counting on her husband being sentimental after her death. She knew if we didn't get him at one location, there was still the opportunity to get him at the other, provided we connected the two pieces of information.\" This was when the barely concealed astonishment had materialized on to his features. And although both of them were aware it was one hell of a long shot, the sudden reality of giving up didn't settle well for either. APHAPHAPHAPH \"Right here?\" he asked, turning off the ignition. Abby squinted through the throngs of people passing by the Spree River. \"Yes,\" she said after a second. \"I engraved that photo into my head. This is the place.\" She glanced down at the car's digital clock and internally breathed a sigh of relief. With over-sleeping at the hospital and the two and a half hour journey back, they'd just barely got to the place in time. Slowly, 1:59 switched to 2:00. Her eyes shot back up, doubting her theory already. But without it, she had nothing. Clutching on to some sort of hope was better than admitting there was none left. So, the two waited patiently. There was a long stretch of area to cover and far too many persons to trace. Some strolled by in groups, blocking out others standing near the edge of the river. Others simply stopped in place to tie a shoe or light a smoke. Other than that, no one from their vantage point appeared like they were standing in place to observe the scenery because of some sick fascination. When 2:01 was dangerously close to unveiling the next number, but Ivan was still a no show. What are the chances of me being right? It's completely ludicrous to attempt to connect a time and place together. Ivan is probably on a train into Switzerland right now, laughing at the display of some American girl. This thought made her so furious she nearly punched the dashboard. Without incident, 2:02 came and went. Everything was as normal. No sign of drifters hesitating in a spot for too long of a time, nor a man with Ivan's physique. The disappointment didn't strike as brutally as she imagined it would. Still, Abby reckoned there was enough time for that later. 2:10 was glowing in black numbers when Abby suddenly inhaled. Without meaning to, her eyes had strolled lazily to the street across. Something in her mind briefly entertained the idea of an observation other than the ideal spot. Ivan would want to be cautious as well. And that's how her emerald gaze found the man sheltered beneath a news stand. He wore a long, brown trench coat with a fedora. With the chill Berlin weather, he hardly seemed out of place. But Abby recognized that stance immediately. \"Directly ahead, in between the lamp post and the news stand,\" she indicated quietly, feeling like just the tiniest raise in volume would alert Ivan to their presence. \"I see him,\" Heiter expressed, one hand slamming the keys back in. The man stood glued to his position, not acknowledging his scenery nor any of the persons passing him. \"How long do you think he's been there?\" \"Difficult to tell,\" he muttered. \"Once he makes a movement, I will begin following him.\" Nodding, Abby fought to keep back her hyper-activeness. She wanted to do nothing more than fling herself out on to the street, gun in hand, and unleash a round of bullets into the statuesque man. People passing him by would never know he was a murderer. God, just the casualness is freaky. When she was just about to suggest getting out of the car and dragging him back, Ivan made his move. Immediately, Heiter threw the vehicle into drive and slowly maneuvered into traffic. Trailing him was a far easier task than finding him. Since the traffic lazed on like a senior citizen's fair, they were able to successfully keep Ivan in their view. A few times he'd been thrown into a mass of people, but his irritated form always made its way out. \"He's turning,\" she said. They waited a few seconds until he was further down the street before doing the same, keeping back the speed slightly under the limit. If he was made aware of their presence in any way, he'd sprint. And that would be a mess to find him in. The next ten minutes really was a test of wills. Ivan would glance behind him, paranoid perhaps of a person walking too close. At this time, Abby sunk back into the car seat, nervous that his gaze would stray toward the road. The more turns he took, the more sparse of scenery he surrounded himself with. After a particularly close call in which he'd stopped walking completely and the vehicle behind them wasn't as patient with their sluggish speed - honking their horn angrily in the process - Abby realized something. \"Heiter...does Ivan know what you look like? I mean...did he actually see you at the farm house?\" \"No,\" the man answered slowly. \"If he sees me,\" she continued, eyes glued to the side street, \"our cover will be blown. Let me jump in the backseat.\" He didn't protest this. Once she was crouched on the leather seating behind the driver, Abby felt safer. Their trail lasted a full 20 minutes, leading them further and further from the busy center of Berlin. Abby wasn't sure whether Ivan had walked the entire way there, or brought a car. Either way, it was impressive how intricate he had made his pathway. An abrupt stop caused Abby's form to slip across the seats and drop into the leg compartment below. \"Ouch,\" she mumbled, rubbing her head. \"Who taught you how to hit the breaks?\" \"The same person who taught you to remain quiet,\" he replied. \"Ivan is getting in his vehicle.\" Carefully, Abby lifted herself off the car floor and glanced up. At the same time, Heiter slammed his foot down on the pedal. Back into the seats she went, hitting her head. \"Damn it, Heiter, you jackass! I'm starting to think you're doing this on purpose!\" She was surprised to hear his quiet laugh, but he didn't say anything afterward. Instead, when she lifted herself, she saw Ivan had indeed made a speedy recovery onto the road. \"We will have to put careful distance between us now,\" Heiter relayed back to her. Nodding, Abby quickly sat herself down behind the driver's seat. She didn't want to end up back on the floor. APHAPHAPHAPH Initially, following Ivan was easy. He was less of a paranoid driver than he was a walker. However, as they departed from the inner city limits, the man began to speed up. Most likely, this was his nervousness sprouting up. He'd weave his way around cars impatiently, passing them like a man on a mission. If only they knew. \"Any idea where he's heading?\" she asked after they'd merged on to a highway. \"East,\" he answered. \"There are no major cities this way and if he continues on, we will reach Poland by the end of the night.\" \"Son of a bitch,\" she muttered. The next hour was spent in relative silence, keeping back two or three car lengths from Ivan's. He rode in a cheap, black, Chevy Impala. From her view, the vehicle had no damage and appeared in good shape. The more distance they'd covered, the less optimistic Abby felt. My travel's visa is getting renewed right now. If we enter Poland, it'll have to be by smuggling me in. Although the thought was dismal, Abby found herself completely willing to do it. Now that they had a trace on Ivan, it would take death for her to part from him. She'd haunt him after death were she given the opportunity. \"Heiter?\" she gently stated. \"Yes?\" he said, the tiniest hint of surprise in his voice. For a moment, Abby glanced down at her jeans. She ignored Klaus's blood still splattered inside the fabric and instead, pulled at a loose string on the innards of her knee. Clearing her throat, she let out an inaudible sigh. \"Thank you,\" she voiced. \"For what?\" There was definite confusion in his tone now. Shrugging, she glanced up at the rear view mirror. His brown gaze was fixed on her, eyes narrowed as if she was partaking in some practical joke. She didn't say anything momentarily, simply staring back at him. \"Everything you've done for me.\" And this admission did concern her briefly. She was thanking the man who'd intended to do some truly repulsive things to her, murder being one of them. But some part of her - maybe a personal brand of idiocy - couldn't hold back the gratitude. Without his help, they'd be back into the role of captive and captor inside his house, in the middle of nowhere. A role that eventually would have forced her to attempt suicide again. No one could live that way forever. This journey they were on had opened up Abby's eyes the way a grandfather bestows wisdom to his grandchildren. Because of it, she was stronger. Because of it, she was smarter. Most importantly - she was aware. No longer in the dark about her dad's fate in this mysterious country. And being aware, even if the information wasn't what she wanted to hear, made EVERYTHING worth it. Heiter didn't respond, but this hardly came as a surprise. To him, it was most likely just another comment his wacky American companion threw on to him. Still, she hoped a part of him did understand her gratitude. Maybe in seeing he had helped someone rather than harmed, life around human beings would be just a tad bit more bearable. Maybe. The whole bit about Abby explaining sentimentalism with a photo - remember in the movie, Heiter carried that photo of his 3 centipede dog. I'd like to think he knew exactly what she meant about looking at certain pictures and feeling the same emotion they'd felt during that time period. Whoa, we only have a few chapters left! Aren't you excited? Let me know your thoughts in a review my faithful readers![Chapter 21] Thank you SO SO SO SO much for the reviews. Ugh, akdhfhhgnzkjpaoe! That's what they make me do. And then I go and write a chapter, talk to my therapist on the phone about how I got the idea to make such a strange story, before finally repeating the cycle. I will say there are German to English translations at the very bottom of the page for a few instances of dialogue. Also, I'm very excited that everything is coming to a conclusion...and many of you have speculated as to how I am going to end this. Well, I will say again that I've been set on the ending from the moment I first wrote the summary of the story and since I adore it, there's very little chance of me changing it. It may not exactly be what you expect, but I find that those are the best stories. I do want to mention that Abby wants to go home...badly. I may not write that in often, but she's exhausted from her ordeal and wants nothing more than the comfort of her own home. The ONLY reason she's stayed so long is for her dad's sake. Anyway, enjoy! Chapter 21 - Vulnerable Virtue \"He's turning off the highway.\" Abby's eyes scanned for his vehicle. \"Is there some sort of town this way?\" she asked, confused. \"No, but a few miles ago indicated a gas station.\" Biting at her lip, Abby held on to the seat as they veered off the highway and continued their stealthy pursuit. \"We've got to make up some sort of plan,\" she finally voiced. \"This might be the only stop he'll make before entering Poland.\" \"What do you suggest?\" \"You approach him. Act like you're lost or looking for directions. He won't recognize you. Try to get him to a deserted area.\" \"And then?\" \"Then-.\" The thought of Heiter physically over powering Ivan without the use of some sort of drug, was laughable. In fact, she nearly informed him of this. But midway through, realized it was only the sort of humor she'd find funny. So, she thought of a Plan B. \"You approach him,\" she began again. \"I'll watch the direction you guys go and follow.\" \"What good will that do?\" \"A whole lot since I've got a gun.\" At his puzzled look, she pulled out the loaded glock. \"Klaus's,\" she mentioned. \"I took it off his body before we entered the hospital. It'd be a bit suspicious if he was found carrying it.\" \"You will threaten him?\" \"I might even shoot him right away,\" Abby admitted. Although not formally agreed upon, the plan was at least some sort of step toward apprehending Ivan. So, their car continued another three miles of turning off more and more frequently deserted roads. \"It would appear we must catch him now,\" Heiter mentioned. \"We are the only car behind him and if he recognizes us on the way back to the highway, he will become suspicious if he has not already done so.\" Abby inhaled, trying not to let her anxiety mingle in with her task. Finally, Ivan pulled off the road into a grungy looking gas station. Four pumps sat outside while a separate garage stood for oil changes. \"Down,\" he ordered. She did as told, but not before seeing Heiter pull past the Impala. He took another sharp turn, wheels bouncing over the bumpy ground. Eventually, he must have parked next to a pump because his keys were soon thrusted out and eventually, into his hand. \"We are lucky to be the only ones here,\" the man commented. Abby's ear picked up the grumbling of the highway six miles off. Even the distance couldn't completely mute the sound. That way, if I pull the trigger, it'll be less of an ordeal to explain the noise. \"I would hate to use my gun before you do,\" Heiter expressed, still staring ahead. \"Make sure to come right away. And Abby...it would be ideal not to kill him here. We have been fortunate to have our messes cleaned up. This one will be on our hands if it does not go well.\" That's got to me the most sensible thing he's said since I've met him. \"I know. Go do your magic, Johnson.\" She could practically visualize the confusion overrunning his features. \"It's an American thing,\" she whispered. His reply was to swing open the car door and step out. After that, Abby was forced to keep taking careful glances through the windshield. Ivan was parked directly ahead, and for the moment, stood facing the pump. He made no move to look around or observe his surroundings. Heiter stood on the opposite side of the vehicle, making a note of glancing down at his car and then at the pump. As if he was unsure whether he would make the journey he'd embarked on. Finally, the surgeon glanced over and began his approach. Abby would have paid a fair amount of money to witness Heiter interacting with a complete stranger in a polite manner. Unfortunately, her duty was to observe as little as possible. Their words were muffled from inside the car. But Abby wouldn't have been able to hear them anyway. With the source of heat gone, her form began shivering quickly. It must have been in the mid 30's outside. God, what I would do for a shower. Ducking down as both men did a casual scan her way, the blonde gripped on to the leather seat. One hand reached for the gun imprisoned within the waste-band of her pants. Why not from here? Clean, straight shot. But she knew this thought to be ridiculous. Ivan may have murdered her dad, but even he would be disappointed with the lack of invention taken to bring the murderer down. It wasn't like her dad simply mowed over his victims without planning. He took careful steps and intricate detailing before luring the men to their deaths. So focused on her plans, Abby nearly missed altogether the two men's sudden shuffling away from the gas pumps. Snapping herself into focus, the blonde lifted her head up a bit to peek over the dashboard from the backseat. Where are they going? Carefully, she grasped on to the car door and as easily as she could, inched it open. One by one, her body crawled out of the vehicle and upon a final crouch, she pressed the door back. The snap made her slowly move upward until she was able to see over the roof of the car. Already, Ivan and Heiter were halfway to the separate garage. Whatever Heiter had said, Ivan was convinced enough to follow him. Abby gripped the gun through her jeans as she reached the first gas pump. The garage was about forty feet away from the main station. Fucking brilliant. Heiter wasn't just heading that way for fun. He was casually leading Ivan into the garage rather than behind it. That way, the confrontation would be far more private. Just before he took the man inside, he inclined his head over the station pump area. I'm guessing that's the signal. With an agility far too graceful for the discomfort she was feeling in her lower body, Abby broke into a sprint. No cars passed by the entire time from her take off nor did the station manager think it odd that some woman was running across a stretch of land like the Jehovah's Witness were personally trying to convert her. Already, she could hear the voices resonating from inside the garage and with one last thought, Abby pulled out Klaus's gun and aimed it directly ahead of her. By the time she entered the spacious area with dim lighting, Heiter had his gun trained on Ivan as well. The man in question looked neither surprised nor fearful. His hands weren't raised either, bugging the blonde far more than it should. \"Get down on your knees,\" she demanded through chattering teeth. \"Machen mir, hure,\" he spat. Whatever his garbeled German was made Heiter step closer and force the tip of his gun into the side of the man's skull. \"Nach unten oder ich mache dich,\" Heiter threatened, pushing the gun in more insistently. Ivan's eyes traveled quickly to the gun at his head before exhaling. When Abby's murderous expression ceased to make an exit, the man finally began kneeling on the cold concrete. \"Check him for a weapon,\" Abby suggested, inching further into the garage. Heiter did so with his gun pointed directly at Ivan's forehead. He pulled out the man's own loaded weapon seconds later, then slid it toward her across the floor. She stopped it with the front of one shoe. \"Keep the gun on him,\" Heiter ordered. \"Shoot if he attempts to move.\" \"I was planning on it,\" she replied. Heiter briefly lowered his weapon, only to pull out a pair of handcuffs. He went to stand behind Ivan and tugged his arms up. This forced the man into a bending position before him as Heiter worked on throwing one wrist within a cuff, and then another. Finally, he withdrew and went to stand beside him again. Both were caught offguard when the man started cackling, softly at first, then louder until the echoes could be heard around the entire garage. Through his graying, caramel hair, Ivan's nearly black eyes locked on to Abby's. They seemed to be conveying a silent message. When his mad laughter finally ceased, he twisted his lips into a triumphant grin. \"Your father,\" he began, voice gravely and low, \"begged like a little girl. I promised to kill his own after I get done with him.\" And when he smirked, Abby couldn't control her next instinct. Her feet stomped the distance toward the man. Heiter seemed not to care what went on from there since he had successfully handcuffed the man. But he retreated from his position cautiously, gun still pointed at the man's head. Just before she reached Ivan's kneeling position, Abby swung out a foot and threw it forward. The bottom of her sole solidly connected with Ivan's face and sent him sprawling backwards with a short cry as his bound hands were forced to carry his weight. A muffled clunk! was heard as skull met concrete and before he had a chance to complain, Abby swiftly moved to kneel over his stomach. With a firm grasp, she grabbed his chin and forced it up toward her. Then, with careful precision, she turned off the safety on the gun and slowly moved it closer and closer to Ivan's mouth. When it was barely a centimeter away, she stopped. \"You seem to think,\" she whispered, her voice light and completely devoid of any sympathy, \"that I have a problem killing you in a public place. I assure you I do not.\" Ivan stretched opened his mouth to reply, but Abby was hoping for this. Before he could close it, she stuck the barrel of the gun straight into his mouth, knocking at his marble teeth, and paused just over the hole leading down to his throat. \"Now...what was this about my dad screaming?\" she asked, eyes narrowing. The man still showed no fear, but the signs of trepidation did become apparent. As if he wasn't quite believing the rage barely contained inside her. \"I will go get his car,\" Heiter mentioned. \"He has already pre paid for gas with his credit card.\" Abby hardly heard him, but she did acknowledge his sudden grip on her shoulder. \"For a minute, refrain from doing it.\" She nodded, eyes glued to the man on the floor. When Heiter was out of hearing distance, she leaned down a little further. \"You better hope my finger doesn't accidentally slip.\" APHAPHAPHAPH As Heiter exited Ivan's vehicle, he glanced down at the unconscious man with bewilderment. Blood was seeping from his nose while a puffiness began forming across the crown of his forehead. \"I had to knock him out,\" Abby reasoned, standing a good few feet away. \"We can't have him alerting people to what's happening. All of this would have been a waste then.\" \"Reasonable,\" he slowly answered. \"Two vehicles have just pulled in as well. We will keep his body in his car.\" After concealing their weapons, the pair stood on opposite sides of the unconscious man. \"Lift on three,\" she motioned. After a silent count down, they grabbed on to the man and carried him over to the backseat of the Impala. Heiter had already opened the door and they made a hasty movement of throwing his body inside. Especially when Abby caught a glimpse of all the people scattered by the pumps. Heiter retrieved Ivan's weapon soon after and threw it in the passenger seat. \"I'll follow you,\" she indicated, eyes straying toward the driver's seat. \"No.\" Glancing back, Abby let out a sigh. \"I'm not going to-.\" \"You might,\" he ascertained. \"With the emotions driving you at this moment, you very well might. Take my car and follow. I want you calm upon interrogation.\" She fought internally against his command, but ultimately knew he was right. If Ivan woke up while she was driving and continued to bait her, there was no telling what sort of position they'd be in. \"Fine,\" she agreed. With a final shared look, Abby retreated from the parking garage with Heiter's keys wrapped tightly in her palm. God forbid I do kill him quickly. Maybe I'll carry it out like he did to my dad. For a moment, she stopped in her footsteps. It's been so easy to fuel my actions based on the raw emotions. But if I do kill him and get pleasure out of it...will that make me just as bad as him? Minutes later, she was pulling out of the gas station, trailing the Impala. At least I've got a good hour and a half to think this over. More lovely German to English translations : Machen mir, hure : make me, whore Nach unten oder ich mache dich : down or I will make you Whew! They FINALLY got the bastard. And of course after 5 months of searching, Abby isn't going to take any bull hockey from him! Personally, I love passive-aggressive Abby. Let me know your thoughts in a review![Chapter 22] Thank you as always for the reviews. They helped get a third chapter up in just three days. I might have this entire thing finished by the start of next week! Now that is a strange thought. One phrase at the very bottom is translated from German to English. I was just going over interviews from the cast members of this movie, the bored/interested duck that I am, and realized how disappointed the director would be with what I did to his idea. I humanized an inhuman character and made him seem likeable - even when that wasn't my intention, at least not directly. I took away what was horrifying about the movie and gave it a twist that makes it cringe-worthy. Thank god none of the cast members are bored enough to look up a fanfic story on this movie. Mr. Six and those associated with the movie call it a master piece and I've got to admit that it took writing this story for me to catch a glimpse of the reason why. But then there's that disappointment of ruining that master piece for them. I guess there's really nothing I can do about it. I had the idea, I had the inspiration from the character (most notably, Dr. Heiter), and I gave it my best shot. I only hope that's enough to consider it reasonably well intended. Ah well. Here's the next chapter. Chapter 22 - Wild Wanderlust The steam washed around her like a mist, but Abby stalked through it without so much as an impressed glance. One hand swiped at the mirror, rubbing away the steam gathered there. The other declined to wrap a towel around herself. Instead, she stared at her naked self. Her entire body burned from the much needed shower and each blonde lock dripped with the weight of the world, droplets gathering at her feet. She sighed, then blinked. But this gesture did nothing to help spur on a decision. What the hell am I going to do to him? A sadomasochistic side begged for sweet revenge. A side raised on her dad's values and beliefs, offered a far more clever solution. Both resulted in death eventually. And there in lied the problem. She'd never killed someone before. Ever. Hell, she didn't even have the guts to strangle Heiter to death a few months ago, and that was him at his worst. If I can establish guilt and innocence based upon non circumstantial evidence, what kind of person does that make me? A vigilante who knows no bounds and believes the law to be strictly black and white? She rotated her neck, hearing a pleasant crack in reply. Not only was she desperately deprived of food, but sleep as well. Maybe I can take this slowly. How slowly? Days? Weeks? All Abby wanted was to feel safe and comforted again. Even if that home was devoid of any family members, at least it was still home. I can't afford to go slow. This whole ordeal is so tiring. So many months, leading into so many different directions. I'm just ready for this to end. And yet...she still felt at odds. Perhaps with the person who'd revealed themselves inside the garage? Vicious, cruel, and merciless. That wasn't her. I need to hear a confession. A description of what happened. And then I'll-. Well, she'd make up her mind when the time came for it. APHAPHAPHAPH Abby was in the process of piling all of her clean clothes together when Heiter appeared at her door. Even months later, he still cared little for the invasion of privacy toward others. Turning toward him, she offered a smile. Realistically, it felt more like a grimace. She went back to her work, expecting the surgeon to began a conversation regarding their prisoner. Instead, he remained silent. \"Has he said he was sorry?\" Abby mumbled, folding the last pair of jeans before setting them down in a pile. \"No.\" Abby observed all the clothes neatly stacked upon her bed and the bag full of the items first found inside, plus two new prizes. The photo of her dad by the Spree River and his Donald Duck watch which she'd try to clean the blood out of, but didn't quite succeed. I'll call Jakob in the morning to see when my travel's Visa will be renewed. If not that, there's always the US embassy. Her fingers plucked out a roll of money from the bag and slowly, she counted the euros. \"This...is for you,\" she explained, approaching Heiter. \"The clothes you bought me and the McDonalds that you look down on me for eating, but insist on paying for.\" He looked at the money as if he'd never seen it before. \"You're taking this,\" she insisted, thrusting the wad at him. \"It's the least I could do.\" His gaze found hers and the intensity of it nearly made her recoil. \"Listen to the words you are saying,\" he expressed. \"To the man you are saying them to.\" \"I've stopped asking myself why I'm thankful for your help a long time ago. Just take my debt and it'll make us both stop wondering.\" Briefly, she thought she detected anger shift on to his features. But upon further study, it was just the slightest bit of disbelief. Despite this, Heiter did grasp on to the euros and flick his fingers through. \"This is too much,\" he mentioned, not even halfway through counting. \"You helped me prove my dad wasn't a cold blooded serial killer. You helped me get into connections with people who knew my dad during his stay here,\" she listed, voice growing louder. \"You helped me pursue someone that could have easily killed you. You helped persuade Jakob to let us use his home to hold our person of interest. And yes...what you did...what you attempted to do will NEVER be rid from my mind. But...I think there's a whole story behind your evolution into who you are now. And somewhere inside me, the same person who stopped me from murdering Ivan in cold blood, is sympathetic even to the most repulsive of human behaviors. Maybe I inherited that not from my dad, but from my mom. She had to live with someone whose fascination included hunting and murdering humans, no matter how inhuman they were themselves. I don't really know anymore. My priorities are kind of skewered. But I do know that I want you to have this money.\" Her speech forced his fingers to stop counting, but again, Abby felt that same revolutionary shift between them. As if her words, her actions, had spewed out some sort of new, unacknowledged agreement in their \"relationship\". \"Thank you.\" She was just as surprised to hear it as he was saying the words, but she offered a nod nonetheless. When Abby watched his gaze travel behind her, she turned toward the bed. \"Whenever we're done with Ivan...I'm ready to get the hell out.\" \"You miss your home?\" Tilting her head, Abby bit at her lower lip. The thin nerve of raw emotion was just barely pressed upon with that question. \"I never thought I would after I left. What would be left for me there? But...I think that's been my safe house. The place I go when I have nothing left. The place I'll go to begin again. A fresh start.\" Heiter didn't respond. Instead, he switched the subject to the man in the cellar. \"I came to say he is awake. Successfully gagged and restrained.\" Taking a careful inhale and exhale, Abby glanced down at her feet. \"What are you going to let me do to him?\" she asked, uncharacteristically shy. He didn't answer until she physically met his eyes. \"Whatever you want.\" APHAPHAPHAPH Initially, Abby had given Klaus's gun to Heiter. Although they lived within a reasonably desolate portion of outer Berlin, she had a slight fear that someone at the right time would hear the gunshot go off. Most importantly, however, she didn't want to use it. It felt cheap and too easy. \"If you wish for some alone time with him, tell me,\" Heiter suggested. Abby didn't reply, but inclined her head toward him to show she understood. The cellar was really a very small area, comparable to a kitchen or dining room. But Ivan sat rigidly in a chair, arms and legs securely bound to the wood, and made the room feel far more spacious. Maybe it's because of how submissive he looks. \"Hello, Ivan,\" she began evenly, moving toward the gagged man. \"My name is Abby Post. My dad was Gregory. Remember him? I just want to talk about what happened twelve years ago. Could we do that?\" When he didn't reply, the blonde paused before him and carefully pulled down the dirty rag out from his lips. \"Rot in hell, spawn of Satan,\" he choked out, eyes full of hatred. \"Nice to meet you too,\" she greeted, crinkling her nose at the smell resonating from him. \"I will answer nothing. You are too weak to kill someone.\" Shrugging, Abby backed up. \"Maybe you're right. But I am equipped with a level head and tons of information.\" \"You know nothing,\" he spat. \"I know that my dad killed your brother,\" she said. \"And I know that made you rather...upset.\" Internally, she grinned at the furious expression his face molded into. \"Upset? Your father deserved what Jonas and I did to him!\" Keeping her face indifferent, Abby glanced up. \"Jonas was involved as well?\" \"Of course! He was Luca's brother. Our brother would have pissed in his grave if he knew we had left his murder unresolved.\" I helped death become easier for a man who helped murder my dad. Shaking off the revelation, the blonde began a pace. \"But your brother was a murderer. Killed plenty of innocent people-.\" \"Innocent?\" Ivan interrupted with a condescending laugh. \"There exists no innocent people. Only those not yet corrupted.\" \"By society's standards, a teenage girl who just barely got her first kiss, is considered innocent. In no way does she deserve to be raped, tortured, and murdered.\" \"My brother-.\" \"Fuck your brother!\" she denounced in a yell, facing him. \"You are denying Luca's rampage because he is your brother. That's understandable. But do not try to convince me that what he did was in the name of good.\" Ivan's glare turned mutinous, and then a small grin crept on to his features. \"Why were your father's actions justifiable? Perhaps you are feeling this denial as well.\" \"This isn't about my father's nature.\" \"But it is. His nature led to his death.\" \"How?\" The man opened his mouth, ready to retort, when he suddenly paused. \"That is clever,\" he admitted. \"Trying to work me up emotionally. It will not work. I will face death before I tell you what happened.\" To her own puzzlement, Abby wasn't feeling frustrated. Instead, she was confused. I've got most of the information. He's got to know that. Then why does he still guard it like it's a lifeline? \"Luca comes to the US so he can escape suspicion from all of the murders taking place,\" she started, arms crossed. \"After a few months, he stumbles into my dad's path and my dad being the far more clever one, kills him.\" This comment forced one of Ivan's veins to throb through the thick skin of his neck, but his lips remained slammed shut. \"You and Jonas start to wonder when Luca will return. Try to contact him, contact US officials, but the man practically disappeared off the face of the earth. You don't want to make this a huge, international affair because you're afraid they may discover Luca's love for murdering innocent people. You've certainly got enough money to investigate yourself. What do you do? Hire a private investigator? Bribe someone in the justice system to check out what happened?\" The man still remained tight lipped, but Abby knew she was on the right track. \"Your mysterious source confirms that Luca is dead. But they also come bearing the information of my dad's true identity. Rather than share this information with the world, you decide you want to personally handle this. Personally show how pissed off you are about your brother's murder. But again, you can't do it outright. Everything has to be meticulously planned. You'll tell me if I'm wrong, won't you?\" Ivan continued his harsh, stony facial resistance. \"In comes Steffan. I'm guessing he was picked off some sort of convict or felons sheet. You see his crime of embezzlement or blackmail and realize he's the perfect person to lure my dad here. You convince him that he will solely profit off the idea and suggest how to make the story believable. So my dad will come and meet him. But...you didn't count on Steffan not going through with it. I guess that did work out in your favor in the end. You were able to slowly inch yourself into my dad's life here in Berlin.\" \"Mund halten, hure,\" Ivan retorted. \"What is it with your love of calling me a whore?\" Abby asked, slightly amused despite the derogative term. \"Have you personally been in the bedroom with me? I'm a very progressive person. I'd like to get to know someone first.\" She smiled despite herself when the faintest trace of red seeped into Ivan's cheeks. \"Now...where was I? Yes. Soon, you and Jonas are able to pry my dad away from Steffan and slowly reveal your intentions. During this time period, I'm quite sure my dad met Sarah. And you may have convinced her that killing my dad was for the better for what he did to Luca. But I don't think even when the deed was done, she was still completely satisfied with what had happened.\" Licking her lips, Abby stretched her arms above her. \"What I can't understand,\" she admitted, \"is why there's a six month gap in which my dad remained untargeted, during which time he was able to send me a postcard with Steffan's address on the back. I mean...you had your man. And while his trust may have been not complete toward you, it was enough to make him stay. Why did it take six months for you two to finally kill him?\" For the briefest moment, Ivan's lips parted and a shadow of guilt etched into his wrinkled features. \"Why?\" she asked again, softer. \"Y-you know nothing.\" After that, he shut up. Physically, emotionally, and mentally. As if someone had sucked the life out of his features and gloated about the information she would never gain. What is he safeguarding? What could have possibly prevented him from carrying out the murder for six whole months? Then suddenly proceeding with it in a completely abhorrent manner. Whatever the answer was, Abby reluctantly understood that tonight, she wasn't going to get it. If ever. \"He's not giving in,\" she mentioned to Heiter. The man had been near the staircase the entire time, observing the proceeding. \"In fact, I think this is all he'll say until he dies. But, there's something he's not telling me. Something I don't think even Sarah knew about, or else she would have given me a clue.\" Heiter glanced over at the man, mouth set in a straight line. \"Perhaps I can convince him.\" As soon as the words were said, Abby knew what he was asking. But was he asking, or was it already a premeditated choice? \"I don't know if that's a good idea.\" \"You have another idea of making him talk?\" the surgeon asked, eyes set on hers. She shivered at the look before glancing down. This time, the act nearly made her sway. \"You are hungry and tired. Go upstairs and rest. Let me take care of this.\" \"But-.\" \"Abby,\" he commanded, one hand grabbing on to her shoulder. \"By the time you wake up tomorrow morning, he will be able to supply all of the information you desire. Can you honestly walk away from not knowing what it is he is hiding?\" Her gaze refused to ascend, but the words were everything she wanted to hear in that vicious, twisted part of her. Taking a deep breath, Abby continued her stare for a good two minutes before meeting Heiter's fixated stare. \"I don't want to come down here and see his penis surgically attached to his armpit.\" \"That is a waste of my talents,\" he mentioned dryly. God damn it, that is not funny! But there that demented humor of hers came in to just barely suppress a smile. \"Okay. Just...know when to stop. And make sure he doesn't scream too loud. It'd be bad for the police to make an appearance.\" The surgeon released a cold smile. \"Jakob promised the cellar to be soundproof.\" Abby pulled away her gaze for fear of caving in. She was willingly condoning one human to torture another. There was simply no easy way to swallow that one. I'll get what I came for. As dehumanizing as that sounds, it's the truth. She risked one last glance at Ivan. The man had been studying them from across the room, most likely defiant about whatever they planned to do. If only you knew. Her eyes offered up a split second apology before her feet ushered her up the stairs. The firm click! of the door seconds later would haunt her dreams for years to come. More German to English translations: Mund halten, hure : shut up, whore I really wanted to stress how uncomfortable Abby is with allowing Heiter to torture Ivan. Yes, she's aware that Ivan did the same to her dad and that he's a pain in the ass, but she feels the dehumanizing effects of this decision almost immediately, even before leaving. She wants the answers so badly at the end of the journey, but her conscience wonders how humane her intent to gather it is. Let me know your thoughts in a review![Chapter 23] Thank you for the reviews! I went three whole days without them after the chapter was up and thought perhaps it was really bad. But I did continue writing the next one and here it is! Hope you enjoy as the mystery draws closer and closer to a conclusion. Also, a Xenagogue is a guide or someone who conducts strangers. A Xyster is a surgeon's instrument for scraping bones. Enjoy! Chapter 23 - Xenagogue Xyster Abby grabbed an apple before bed, but by the time she entered her bedroom, all thoughts of eating ceased. A graceless thump on to the soft mattress was heard before she stumbled off into dreamland. Unlike the peculiar dream of the lion full of wisdom, this time, the dreams were more of nightmares. She dreamed of Ivan most often, contained in the cellar. There was a tiny bell that would ring, indicating it was time to interrogate him. But that meant venturing down the stairs and seeing what horrors lay in the room. The first time she went down, the man was missing both eyes. The sockets sat like two empty, gaping holes with dried blood smeared around the lower eyelid. She had just been able to keep back her scream. The second journey down stairs found her taking in the man who appeared like nothing had been altered. Until he attempted to speak. No tongue. Instead, a stubble of slithering, thin, blood tissue wiggled at her. Again, a scream was suppressed, but the terror was not. Like an unbreakable fit of the shivers swarmed over her, polluting each bodily function. Her breaths were ragged and quick. Eyes flinging back and forth beneath her lids like a haywire metronome. And a few times, one arm flung out over the edge of the bed, fingers grasping at something, but never gaining it. She didn't want to go back down stairs the third time, but she was hardly a lucid dreamer. There was no control she had over her actions. No ability to stop them. And perhaps a part of her really didn't want to. It knew she deserved to see what happened to the man as a result of her choice. The third image had her let out an ear piercing scream that made her throat sore. She was still screaming when the door was flung open and the light slammed into her focal point, causing her eyes to instantly water. \"What happened?\" Taking in a few careful breaths, Abby's fingers dug into the covers beside her. Her chest heaved intensely, heart not yet willing to settle down. \"I had-.\" Another shake coursed through her, gripping on to her nerves and thoroughly shaking them. She swallowed thickly. \"-nightmare,\" she gasped out, eyes finally adjusting to the invasion of light through the black room. \"Just a nightmare.\" Heiter observed her cautiously, not quite stepping into the room, but not ready to sprint either. \"What about?\" he ended up asking. Abby shook her head at first, willing the image to disappear. It was the man in her entryway who was the cause of the image. Of the gruesome experiment he first had in mind all those months ago. Maybe he still does. I don't know what I'll find when I come downstairs. \"How's Ivan?\" This got the surgeon's full attention. \"You are worried about the condition of the man who murdered your father? Perhaps being the daughter of a serial killer has influenced your right and wrong.\" \"Not everyone can handle the guilt of allowing someone to be tortured,\" she bit back, anger rumbling inside her. His gaze hardly faltered, but he did tilt his head and cross his arms. \"I once was told a person becomes easier to understand the more you know them. Often, first impressions are repulsively accurate. But you...you, I do not know what to make of.\" \"This isn't about me,\" Abby argued. \"Is Ivan still in one piece?\" The stare he gave her made Goosebumps immediately surface. \"Physically...he is still in one piece. I was getting a drink when I heard your scream. You have not been asleep for more than four hours.\" \"I don't know,\" she mumbled, leaning back, \"if I could go back for another four.\" Her eyes sprung up to the ceiling, awake and alert. At least to a form of degree. \"Do you wish to join me?\" One hand rubbed at her forehead, ignoring the oddity of the request. The man didn't ask, he demanded. If I fall asleep again and see-. \"Vodka sounds really good right now.\" APHAPHAPHAPH They sat at the kitchen table, neither saying a word. Abby took gradual sips out of her glass, enjoying the sting of alcohol and the buzz she felt as a result. Her apple lay devoured and despite nearly a day without food, her stomach wasn't up to digesting anything else. The silence was comfortable, but Abby feared at any moment that the topic would turn to Ivan. He'd have no problem with torturing my dad. Why am I so against this? Because she knew right from wrong. And that revenge that drove her dad, seemed to be misplaced inside her. She took another gulp, closing her eyes as the liquid traveled down like a wildfire. \"There are certain things,\" Heiter began, hand beneath his chin, \"that need to be done. Things not considered moral, but necessary.\" \"No offense,\" she muttered, \"but that was the Nazi's excuse.\" \"Yes...but they enjoyed their work. The thought of what I am doing to him, is hardly one you can stand.\" \"Doesn't that make me worse of a person though? Doing nothing to stop it?\" Heiter's gaze fell down to his cup. For a long moment, he was fixed on it. \"Your father had these moral fights with himself, I am sure,\" he replied. \"But he knew it was worth it if those who could hurt you or his wife, were out of the world. He did not consider himself God, but he did believe he was serving others.\" Nodding, Abby found her green gaze falling to the surgeon's in surprise. \"I think he needed a release as well,\" she admitted. \"He probably had the instinct to take people apart far before he started murdering them. But his sense of right and wrong wasn't skewered like a lot of people's are.\" They stayed silent for a moment after. \"Were you just trying to make me feel better?\" she asked, not quite sure how to make her voice sound. \"Your room does not come soundproof,\" he answered swiftly. \"Oh,\" she laughed, \"just wanted to shut me up.\" He didn't respond. \"You could always kill me.\" She didn't know where words came from, but they were out and she could do nothing to retrieve them. \"To shut me up,\" she continued, glancing up at him. Again, his brown eyes seemed to have molded into a flame of intensity. \"There are far more effective ways of shutting you up,\" he responded. When his eyes fell away, Abby stopped the second sip she was ready to take. \"Such as?\" \"Use your imagination,\" he gruffly suggested. Her lips twitched up, unsure just exactly what her imagination was trying to display. \"I am,\" Abby stated. \"I'm not quite sure if what I'm seeing is what you were implying.\" Heiter slammed his palm down on the table once, the vibrations causing her to raise a brow. But for whatever reason, she didn't react. He didn't say anything after the action. \"Just felt like abusing Jakob's table? Yeah,\" she mentioned, fingers rubbing the light brown features, \"mahogany can be a real bitch.\" \"Stop.\" His tone wavered at the request. \"Doing what?\" she inquired, generally curious. \"Stop being so-.\" \"Open?\" she suggested. \"Calm? Trust me, if I could feel the appropriate emotions right now for someone in my position, I would. But this is my quirk. The one oddity I have that many other sensible people don't. You've dealt with it already. What's making it so difficult now?\" He didn't have an answer. In fact, he gulped down the rest of his beverage and stood. Abby's eyes were glued to him, wanting to desperately say something. His behavior didn't make the slightest of senses. Not that it always did to begin with. \"Oh,\" she realized, eyes growing wide. \"Oh.\" Heiter met her stare, eyes narrowed. \"What?\" he nearly spat. \"I understand. I understand,\" she repeated. They held contact for a full thirty seconds before his eyes fell. \"Good,\" he said. \"Then I will continue my work.\" The man left in a hurry, feet swiftly padding against the carpet. Once the door to the cellar was closed, Abby sighed. One hand reached for the bottle of vodka, the other stayed gripping her knee. Do I really want to be intoxicated while interrogating Ivan? Just as soon, her hand released the bottle. Once inflamed nerves now sat like a buoy out on the ocean. Whether it was the alcohol, or the impact of understanding just exactly why her actions suddenly made the surgeon uncomfortable, she didn't know. But the latter thought did not cease to amaze her. APHAPHAPHAPH When Heiter returned upstairs - four hours later, Abby sat on a cozy couch, studying the photo of her dad. Through that tense waiting, she couldn't help but fall back to the six month gap. The gap that he'd remained alive in, only to be killed shortly after. What happened, dad? Did someone try to help you? Did Ivan not have his mind made up? And slowly, the photo brought on an entirely new meaning. \"No,\" she mumbled, eyes scanning her dad's posture. \"No...that's ridiculous.\" But the more her idea pestered her, the more Abby wondered if it could possibly be true. Ivan hates me. Good God does he hate me. Maybe it's not just because I'm the daughter of the man he murdered. Maybe it's because-. \"Are you ready?\" Shooting her gaze up, Abby pushed herself up from the couch. Her lower body still ached dully, but it was easily something she could get over. \"I need to ask you something,\" she began carefully, photo clutched tightly. \"And I want you to be very, very specific.\" \"About how I-.\" \"No! No...I don't want to know what you did to make him talk. Ever.\" She was clear and firm on that, knowing that if the information was made aware, guilt would destroy her mission. \"I just want to know...how he acted once I was gone. Toward you.\" A puzzled expression froze itself on his face and if the situation were any less grim, Abby would have laughed. \"How he acted?\" \"Yes,\" she continued, nearing him. \"Not during your interrogation of him, but immediately after I left. How did he act?\" \"At ease,\" he answered, still unsure the basis of her question. \"Far more willing to barter for his life with me.\" Nodding, Abby glanced down at the photo again. Maybe its purpose isn't just that of a sentimental portrait. Of a time or place. The uncomfortableness on my dad's face...it's unique. If Ivan is the taker of the photo, maybe it wasn't the place he was attempting to save in his memories. It was the person. But...WHY? \"What are you thinking?\" he finally asked. Meeting his eyes, Abby's brows flexed into a determined manner. \"I can't quite say. It's a bit...strange.\" \"Tell me.\" So, she did. And Heiter...well, his answer was a half shrug, half raise of the eyebrows. \"Possible,\" he determined. \"I mean he-.\" She ended it there. \"Go ask him yourself,\" he gestured. Taking a deep gulp of air, Abby's head stretched into the proper direction. \"I could be wrong.\" \"The more I think of it, the more truth I see. Do not talk yourself out of this when you have made extraordinary connections to get here.\" Lifting a brow, Abby couldn't suppress her grin. \"Extraordinary? That's called a compliment.\" To her surprise, Heiter didn't snap back. \"Yes,\" he stated. \"It is.\" And those were the last words either said before descending down the cellar stairs. Just want to quickly explain Abby's understanding since I don't feel like going into detail in the story about it. She was being carefree around him - open, just like she'd been before. But...when a person plans on torturing another individual, they have to get into the rigid and emotionless mindset. Abby's infectious attitude was taking that away from Heiter. He was regressing into someone who was making conversation with her. When he snapped himself out of it by slapping the table and telling her to stop, he meant acting the way she did because that would take him out of the mindset he had built for himself. Also, the unspoken thought is that he knows exactly what her imagination conceived about him shutting her up. And Abby understood that, was even awed that she carried the ability to make the man alter his attitude for the time being. So, yeah. That's that strange bit of gravy. Hmmm...I bet you're all wondering what it is Abby figured out about Ivan. Or think she has at least. Maybe one of you readers will pick up on it. And I'll be honest, I never planned on writing it in...but I think it'll give the story that one last punch of \"are you serious?\". Anyway, let me know your thoughts in a review![Chapter 24] Dark poettess - glad you loved the chapter. I'd like to answer your question by saying yes, Abby did think of Ivan as a centipede in her nightmare - the one that eventually woke her up screaming. Also, when Heiter wanted Abby to shut up, he meant by smothering her with a pillow. But Abby's imagination is vast and of course she thought of kissing. Knowing he'd never do such a thing, she mentioned the image in her head as a joke. Heiter was a bit flustered and angry at the thought so he didn't respond well (as always). Also, Yapness means hunger. Yird means to bury. And before I forget, there are some translations at the very bottom. And on we go! Gah...so, so crazy! Enjoy! Chapter 24 - Yird Yapness Heiter's attire for the entire eight hour session with Ivan had been a pair of blue jeans appearing to have been sewn together from the late 1970's, and a crisp, white t-shirt. Neither bore any mark of what occurred in the cellar, but Abby reasoned that he could have just as easily changed. \"How long did it take before he actually gave in?\" she questioned from the bottom step, facing away from their captive. She wasn't ready to see him yet. Then again, the relief of gaining the proper knowledge made it exciting. \"A surprisingly long while,\" he admitted, eyes on her. \"The man was brothers to a serial killer. I can only assume Luca had instilled some of his will inside him.\" The thought of the brother made Abby unbelievably tense. It were his actions that led to her dad's murder. Well, technically it was my dad's…but he wouldn't have had to kill the man if he didn't murder innocent people. This was a pointed thought, one that could easily be taken apart from any angle and still not provide a correct answer. Multiple actions interrupted multiple fates. Could she really pick out one lone perpetrator? \"Just in case,\" Heiter mentioned, \"I will have a gun.\" \"Okay. Wait...in case what?\" His dark look didn't carry the proper time for analytical thought. \"Do you really think he'll talk to me?\" she asked instead. \"He will know the consequences for his disobedience.\" Abby's eyes widened, but that was the only physical sign of unease she gave. Like a prisoner ready to face execution, the blonde finally turned to observe Ivan Kappel. He doesn't appear physically harmed. The man still sat in restraint, but no obvious scarring or bruising showed on his features. He sat rigidly in his seat, as if the thought of sitting otherwise would cause great disapproval. Abby stepped forth a few steps, eyes glued on his own weary ones. Although she made the conscious decision to never ask what occurred between the two men, she could tell just in Ivan's eyes that the interrogation had messed with him. Badly. What is that? Fear? Trepidation? His eyes were wide open, but a terror danced inside his black pupils. Not completely focused on her, Ivan's breaths flew out in a near choke each time his eyes traveled behind her. He's terrified of him. The curiosity sprouted over what occurred, but again, she pushed it away. Now was not the time to carry that sort of guilt. \"Ivan, can I ask you something?\" He fixed his sight on her approaching form immediately, but the only aware act he gave out was a clearing of the throat. \"Fragte die frau sie eine frage,\" Heiter harshly noted. \"Entschuldigung. Entschuldigung,\" Ivan muttered, eyes focused on Abby. His voice carried a slight waver in it, but otherwise, he stayed in one piece. \"What do you want to know?\" he gave in, not quite able to keep out the bitterness in his tone. Biting at her lip, Abby thought over how to word her theory. \"Were you happy being married to Sarah?\" She could tell the question visibly shocked him. His eyes lost their fearfulness for a moment and instead, squinted at Abby as if she was a ball of sunshine. \"In what way?\" he finally asked. \"Was she someone you could confide in? Someone you loved?\" \"We will know if you are lying,\" Heiter added. Ivan cringed, but, remained lucid enough to answer. \"Love was not exactly the reason we married. A friendship from early age brought us together. I trust her with most of my secrets. She trusted me. Together, marriage was option both of our parents approved of.\" \"But you weren't in love with her?\" \"No...not sexually.\" \"How come you never left? Surely you'd met other people who'd caught your attention?\" Ivan frowned in annoyance. \"Only a cruel man would leave a woman suffering from schizophrenia.\" Offering a sympathetic nod, Abby retreated a few steps. So far, her words did not come off accusatory. Unfortunately, that would have to change if she wanted to delve in deeper to the truth. \"Did you ever cheat on Sarah?\" The man's lips slammed shut, but involuntarily, his eyes shot to Heiter. Whatever he saw made him respond in half a second. \"Very few times.\" \"Was she ever aware?\" \"I don't know.\" \"Did you cheat on her when you went away on business?\" \"Yes.\" \"Did your brothers know you weren't faithful?\" \"Yes, but that hardly is the point. Luca murdered teenage virgins and Jonas was busy trying to distance himself from family. It was hardly a topic to lose sleep over.\" Abby stopped her pacing, wondering how to proceed. \"The first time you met my dad...what did you think of him?\" \"What did I think of him?\" Ivan sputtered in disbelief. \"What the hell do you mean? He killed my fucking brother!\" \"You didn't answer my question.\" Ivan smashed his teeth in between his bottom lip, eyes furious. \"He was a bratty excuse for a human. Stupid, foul, and deserving of death. I was only too glad to hand it to him.\" The blonde tilted her head. \"You're lying,\" she pointed out after a few tense seconds of staring. \"My dad was unnaturally patient, excessively intelligent, always dressed impeccably for social events, and was one hell of a survivor. Now...I'm going to ask again. What did you think of my dad when you met him?\" He still seemed unwilling to speak. \"Luca isn't here,\" she mentioned softly. \"Neither is Jonas. They can't hurt you for what you're saying.\" A few short breaths were taken before Ivan finally nodded. \"I could not believe it was the man who murdered Luca. He was very intelligent and charming. He knew all about Berlin and when I offered to give him tour, he would tell me histories of the city that I did not even know.\" \"Did you and Jonas decide immediately to murder him?\" Again, the same hesitancy dashed over his features. \"No. In fact...there was talk of letting him go back to home country. Steffan did not want to blackmail him, Jonas did not want to kill him, and eventually, I did not either. Sarah met him numerous times and found out what we planned on doing to him in the beginning. She talked me out of it.\" Keeping her breaths level, Abby brushed at a strand of blue fiber on her jeans. \"Did my dad figure out what you planned on doing to him?\" \"Yes,\" Ivan softly answered. \"This made his trust difficult to gain after. And to keep him in line, I kept threat over his head about telling what he did.\" \"So he stayed?\" \"Yes.\" \"With you?\" \"He insisted on hotel room.\" \"And during these months, who would you say you spent more time with - Sarah or my dad?\" \"I will not answer that.\" Abby could practically feel the surgeon begin to approach, but she intercepted the man before he could reach Ivan. \"Don't,\" she whispered, eyes boring into his. \"He's doing fine. Right now, he's feeling guilt.\" \"Guilt?\" Heiter said, frowning. \"For what?\" Making sure she didn't glance behind, Abby drifted away from their captive. \"He's feeling guilty because he's partly responsible for Sarah's death. That time he didn't spend with her, led to her schizophrenia getting worse. Medicine or proper treatment during that time could have prevented her death.\" Heiter visibly didn't care for the explanation, but he didn't argue. \"If I really need you to get him to talk, I'll say something. Just let me give him a chance to explain himself first,\" she gently commanded. He didn't quite sigh, but the frustration was evident. \"I will never understand your kindness toward him.\" Shrugging, Abby crossed her arms. \"If you want, call it mercy.\" With that, she turned back to Ivan's seated form. \"Alright...so we've established that my dad was intelligent,\" Abby announced, arms behind her. \"And reasonably perceptive.\" Ivan didn't agree or disagree. \"So after awhile, he'd have figured out you weren't planning on releasing the information you originally planned on blackmailing him with.\" \"How do you know I never planned to?\" he bit back. \"Because to do so would mean hurting him. And other than killing Luca, my dad hadn't done anything to provoke you. In fact, you, Sarah, and Jonas all liked him. Plus, my dad would only have to mention Luca's extracurricular activity and then his act would soon be thought of as a blessing.\" The man mumbled something, but didn't respond. \"After my dad figured out you were bluffing, he probably planned on returning back to his family, right?\" \"Something like that,\" he venomously replied. \"I mean...six months in a foreign country! It'd make anyone home sick. I would know. Plus, he's probably anxious as hell that you might give out the information.\" \"You don't know what you're talking about.\" \"I don't?\" Abby maintained. \"Then enlighten me.\" Ivan looked up at her, eyes hard and vengeful. \"Gregory did not want to leave. He was perfectly fine with individuals who valued his exquisite tastes and charming persona. Why go back to a wife he stopped loving and a sensitive child?\" Abby froze. \"Sensitive?\" she repeated despite herself. \"He really said that?\" \"He hated you and his wife,\" Ivan assured. \"That life was boring and uneventful. Paying bills, going to job he hated. He craved excitement that the city life could provide. What you call \"disappearance\" was actually his decision to stay.\" For a moment, all the air in Abby's lungs thinned. It seemed like she couldn't attain enough oxygen. Without really meaning to, her fingers twitched with a sharp twinge. He's lying...isn't he? I was only 10 at the time. I had no proper understanding of his wants and needs. Did that mean he really-? She felt a brush past her shoulder and before her brain could comprehend what was happening, high pitched yelling broke out as Heiter blocked her sight of their captive. \"Nein, nein!\" Ivan screamed. \"Bitte. Nicht weider.\" \"Wenn man nicht die wahrheit sagen, sie haben keine verwendung für eine zunge,\" Heiter replied, moving closer. Picking up only half of his words was frustrating, but the thought of the surgeon physically dismembering the man, nearly made her gag. \"Stop!\" she yelled, approaching Heiter. The request barely registered inside the man. Reaching out a hand, Abby hesitated about touching him, partly nervous about him turning on her. When she realized he'd only continue to fall deeper into his merciless mindset, Abby calmly laid her outstretched hand over his shoulder. The muscles were taut as a bow upon the contact. \"Bitte, stoppen,\" she tried, voice as soft as she could make it. The impact her touch and soft spoken words had, couldn't have been more overstated. Quietly, Heiter turned back to her. The edge was lost from his expression and no murderous sneer graced his lips. Instead, he appeared surprised. Like the act of her touching him was the last thing he ever expected. They both stared at each other for a moment, drinking in the sudden silence of the room, save for Ivan's ragged breathing. \"Geht es dir gut?\" She didn't know why she felt the need to ask in German. Then again, touching the man was a rather intimate act already. \"Ja,\" he answered. \"But my patience is not. It would be nice for this to end soon.\" Her eyes strayed toward Ivan. The man's cheeks were wet from tears he probably wasn't even aware he'd let out. Trailing down, Abby grimaced at the wet spot having formed on the inside of his thighs. In fact, there seemed to have already been a patch of darkness already, covered again. Shit. Whatever Heiter did before, this is the second time Ivan's peed himself. \"I can do that,\" she said slowly, disentangling herself from the troubling image. \"But I need Ivan to have a tongue in order for that to happen.\" \"How unfortunate.\" Still, he did move back toward the stairs. \"Okay,\" she redirected, throwing out her hands. \"So if my dad wanted to stay in Berlin, why did you kill him after six months?\" Ivan swallowed thickly, not trusting his voice to speak. \"I've got a theory,\" she expressed. \"But I want to hear your view on the matter.\" \"I-I lied.\" \"About what?\" \"Gregory wanting to stay here. He missed you very much.\" She could tell it killed him to say it, but the information could not afford to be severed at this moment. \"Okay. He wanted to go home. So why didn't you let him? You didn't plan on killing him.\" \"Because-.\" It took a few minutes for the man to collect his breaths, but the tears kept on coming. In fact, they were so abundant Abby felt the urge to grab a tissue and wipe away the wetness gathered. Oh Ivan, if only you knew how much like your brother you look right now. \"Ivan?\" A sob broke through his lips, but no words. \"Don't even think about it,\" she threatened, one hand signaling the man behind her to stop. \"If you know,\" Ivan suddenly cried, eyes defiant, \"then why don't you say it!\" In that moment, all of his wrinkles disappeared. The yellowness in his eyes dispersed. Crows feet? Somehow blotted out. Before her sat Ivan as he was upon meeting her dad. She didn't know how, but this man presented to her for just a brief moment, was the epitome of cleverness and wit. Of charm and incredibal beauty. So much more than just a business man. Taking in a deep breath, Abby brought her hands together. As soon as the young man appeared, the ancient features seeped back into his face. \"Because it's not my story to tell.\" The words sunk into Ivan's brain, and gradually, his breathing was maintained. Even his eyes stopped leaking for a quick part of a second. Enough to at least admit exactly what Abby had already assumed. But she needed to hear it with her own ears. \"I-I,\" he tried, sucking in a breath. \"I was in love with your father.\" Gulping, Abby felt a prickliness form inside her dry throat. \"You're...gay?\" she said, wanting to make sure. \"It is far more accepted lifestyle here.\" She heard Heiter's footsteps stalk forward, but they paused beside her rather than get near the sitting man. \"Before you did whatever you did to him,\" she observed, talking to the surgeon on her right, \"Ivan was more at ease with you. Probably explains why he went without much of a thought, with you into the garage. He trusts men far more than women. It explains his extreme hate toward me.\" \"I also think,\" Heiter offered, \"it is your heritage. You are the daughter of the man he...loved. What a strange way of showing it.\" \"Ivan,\" Abby broke in, \"if you loved my dad...why did you kill him?\" The waterworks just as turned back on. It's difficult to believe this man survived the cut throat business world. \"Ivan?\" she tried again. \"You must be firm,\" Heiter noted. \"Thank you, Mao.\" The man grimaced, remaining tight lipped. They continued watching Ivan sob and although the wild animal noises that flew from his lips, tugged at her heart strings, Abby found herself unbelievably impatient to move on. What the hell is wrong with me? The guy is clearly in a turmoil. But again, a grave amount of information had just been learned. To suddenly pause just when the end was near made her want to act on Heiter's suggestion. \"You were in love with my father,\" she reminded once Ivan's tears momentarily subsided. \"How'd it happen?\" \"Immediately,\" he choked out. Abby's eyebrows rose into her hair line. Figuratively, of course. \"He was so different,\" Ivan continued, seemingly in a faraway place. \"Had a bit of insanity to him, had to if he was able to take down Luca. But so vulnerable as well. When I had that power over him-God, I just wanted his love so badly.\" The admission shouldn't have surprised her as much as it did. But the pain in which it was said. That's what caused her to pause. \"How did my dad respond?\" Shaking his head mutinously, Ivan spat down at the floor. The white liquid landed only inches from Abby's own naked feet. \"He knew I wanted him. He knew .\" \"And?\" \"It took five months for him to say he did not love me.\" The time gap. Ivan spent it trying to get dad to love him. \"And then?\" God damn it, do I want to know? Do I really? \"And then...\" He slowed down his breathing for a moment, glassy eyes focused on her tired green ones. \"I asked him to stay,\" Ivan laughed, nothing warm in the gesture. Tears began descending again. \"I begged him. I tell him he will have perfect life. Perfect friends. Perfect lover.\" One of Abby's hands started shaking, but she ignored the possessed limb. \"What did he say?\" \"He say? Oh...he say his real family is in the States.\" And out came the man Abby had first laid her eyes upon. The one at the farmhouse, so eager to sprint away. The one triumphant of the death and destruction he'd caused. \"You couldn't let him leave,\" she stated, hating the words. \"Of course not,\" Ivan objected, shaking his head rapidly. \"He tell me of wife whose troubles martyr his plans for future. He tell me of daughter too sensitive for life he leads her into. I could not let him go back. I would not.\" \"You were angry. Betrayed.\" Stop goading him. Ivan's eyes brightened with a barely concealed giddiness. \"Very much so. I call Jonas, tell him Gregory tried to finish job he started with Luca, on me. Jonas had distanced himself enough to where this was not a matter he investigated too deeply. He met me.\" Her body radiated a frying heat, but the tips of her fingers and toes remained frigidly glacial. \"And then?\" Another laugh spilled from the man's throat. \"First, we knock him out. Then, we chain him. Luca had special part of house where he liked to bring his virgins. It was perfect place for torture.\" She was ready to stop him, but her brain ignored the command. It had to know. \"Once gagged, real fun began. I had to tell Jonas of the torture Gregory put Luca through. That was the only way he would participate. Oh how we slashed. Over, and over, and over again. Cut beneath each rib, inches deep. Blood run down body like a coat of oil. Jonas insisted on messing his face up. Soon, our fists met every part of Gregory's face. Jaw dislocated. Nose bashed in. Eye permanently sealed, perhaps permanently obliterated.\" The breath was sucked in swiftly, but she gritted her teeth and continued listening. An insistent hand from the man beside her, attempted to reach out, but she grabbed on to the wrist with inhuman strength and simply held it there. The grip only tightened as the story went on. \"After Jonas leave to bathroom...oh, I had own fun.\" When Ivan smirked, Abby felt the first stir of revenge lace her veins. The battle began for her resolve. \"I was able to touch what I could not for months!\" he exclaimed, his accent becoming sloppier the more excited he got. \"Even with blood, your father tasted like cinnamon. I was able to devour it and for once, he could not say no!\" Her eyes slammed shut, portraying the image. He was tough. Even during that, he'd have preserved. \"I only let gag out once. The cinnamon was delicious in mouth as well.\" Peeking from beneath her eyelashes, Abby tightened both fists. \"But then that fun end when Jonas return. After, we continue slashing and stabbing. You would be amazed at amount of times human can be stabbed and still not bleed to death. But Jonas and I wanted his death to be special. He killed Luca! So, we snap wrists and ankles. No longer he need chains. We make him crawl, beg for life.\" It took a second for the blonde to realize her cheeks were wet. A harsh breath was released, but a worse one was inhaled. \"Bones break shortly after he attempt crawl.\" \"Stop.\" The words came out quicker than her brain could bring them back. \"Your father begged for life! Begged.\" \"Stop.\" Her voice didn't change tone, but the emotion behind it sounded like an avalanche just barely being held back. \"I tell him as I cut off finger one by one, how I would like to do same to family. I do it slow too. Nice and easy.\" \"St-.\" But the command couldn't express itself. The hand previously wrapped around Heiter's wrist, released itself and flung straight to her mouth. Hot, short breaths shot into her palm. \"Jonas begin cutting through neck, and I cut toward heart. Why not stab his when he stab mine? Then...oh, it is great. Jonas gets idea, but does not try it out. So, I do it for him. I pull down pants and release-.\" Her mind physically blocked out the next words. Unfortunately, the anger only built within that avalanche of emotions. \"-wet from head to toe. Finally, we take pity. He smells horrible and could not possibly live for much longer. I take knife and put it in heart. Dead. We bury underneath floor boards. Let's say this. Luca had more victims than police found.\" A silence exploded inside the room after Ivan paused. The shift in power seemed to be held in his restrained hands. \"Did you enjoy story?\" he goaded. \"Of how the brave man you called your father, really nothing more than a weak man who begged for life.\" She didn't respond. Inside, her brain processed the information. It insisted on one emotion to overtake everything. Anger. And why not? Ivan and his brother had defaced, dehumanized, and tortured her father before killing him. What in the hell gave her the right not to be just as merciless toward him? A hand wiped at her cheeks, sliding across slippery flesh. To her and the entire room's surprise, a chuckle spilled from her lips. Am I finally going mad? After all this time, it was the information of what happened that finally did it? Heiter threw her a concealed look of concern, but she ignored it. Look at him. He wants death. He wants it badly. He's already felt the proper guilt for killing my dad. And for isolating Sarah. Whatever is left inside, is no longer compassionate or able to be redeemed. It's evil. \"Do I remind you of Gregory?\" she ended up asking. Ivan studied her cautiously, weary all of a sudden. \"Simple question,\" she continued. \"When you and I first saw each other at your farmhouse in Neuruppin. Was I the splitting image of my dad?\" His lack of an answer suited Abby just fine. \"So you planned on killing me?\" she surmised. \"When I was running after you and you suddenly turned with the gun. When you shot at me, did you imagine it was my dad or did you actually see me?\" \"He shot at you?\" Heiter interrupted, taking a step forward. \"Just a second,\" Abby mentioned from the corner of her lips. \"Don't do anything yet. I need to figure out how to approach this.\" \"Kill me,\" Ivan stated. \"Kill me.\" \"But that would be easy,\" she reasoned. \"In fact, too easy. And you know what's strange? Sometimes, living is far more difficult that dying. Because think of everything that's killing you inside. Every demented action you've taken. Every harmful word you've shouted. Every loved one you pushed away or slaughtered. Allowing all of that to rot within you, I think, is true death. So...you're asking me for death. Actually, I'd go even as far to say as you'd beg me for it. Why? Because you can't stand the pain anymore inside you. This person sitting there...well, I don't think even you recognize him anymore. Luca may have been the one who took pleasure in the kill, but you certainly inherited the lack of a soul. And my dad saw right through it. In fact, he was clever enough to guide me to you. Clever enough to know Steffan would lead to Sarah who'd lead to you. He had it all planned out, even as he took his beating. You said you laughed? Think of the riot he had going inside his head. He signed your death certificate far before you even realized it. He knew his daughter would stumble upon the same pathetic excuse of a man and get such a kick out of it. And that...dear God, that is so fucking hilarious I can barely stand it.\" She shook her head once, smile creeping up despite her best job at containing it. Ivan's lips moved, but nothing came out. In fact, the momentary shift in power he'd held, sprang out of him like a black cat. \"For once,\" Heiter mentioned, observing her, \"your sense of humor does not leave me confused.\" \"Isn't it funny?\" she laughed, meeting his gaze. \"Yes.\" And so she continued her enlightened observation of the restrained man. \"What do you wish to do?\" the surgeon asked. Breathing in, Abby tilted her head. One finger tapped insistently on the corner of her elbow. \"The only thing I can do,\" she realized. \"The only thing that will be far worse than death.\" He pulled out his gun from the back of his jeans, but Abby didn't say anything. In fact, she stayed mute for a few minutes. When his puzzled expression finally met her green eyes, she smiled. \"We're going to let him go home and live with himself.\" Fragte die frau sie eine frage : the woman asked you a question Entschuldigung : sorry Nein : no Bitte : please Nicht weider : not again. Wenn man nicht die wahrheit sagen, sie haben keine verwendung für eine zunge : if you can't speak the truth, you have no use for a tongue. Bitte, stoppen : please, stop. Geht es dir gut : Are you alright? Ja : yes Also, when Abby called Heiter, Mao, she was referring to Mao Zedong - the communist leader who was responsible for millions of deaths in China due to his policies and oppression ranging around 49'-76'. Oh...and Dark poetess - your long shot was absolutely correct! I was hoping someone would get it and I'm glad you took a shot at it. Hopefully you guys don't think it's too out there. But then again, love makes you do strange, horrible things some times. Gregory Post was the unfortunate recipient of an unwanted love from a man whose own brother's actions helped mold him into a cold blooded killer. Anyway, hope you enjoyed that! I can't believe she's letting him go! Or maybe I can. It's all in my head, damn it! Almost done! Let me know your thoughts in a review![Chapter 25] Thank you for reviewing! Always thankful. Honestly, those reviews have gotten me as far as they have today. So really, just thank you! My gratitude can not express enough how much they have meant. Two translations at the very bottom. Other than that, Zoetic means living or vital and Zetetic is a search or investigation. Enjoy! Chapter 25 - Zoetic Zetetic \"NO.\" The word met Abby's ears from both males. Two entirely different reasons fueled the requests, but she already made up her mind. \"You said I could do whatever I wanted with him,\" she began, advancing on the surgeon. \"I want to let him go. He's suffering enough and left alone with himself, he'll continue to deteriorate until there's nothing left.\" \"It was my belief that you planned to kill him eventually,\" Heiter hissed back. \"Think of everything we've done to find him.\" \"I've thought it over,\" she nodded solemnly. \"Actually, it didn't take until I discovered the truth for this decision to become clear. In this case, acting out on revenge also declares Ivan the winner. A release for him. He hates himself already. Just think of the turbulent life that'll consume him.\" \"Töte mich!\" Ivan cried. \"Maul halten!\" Heiter spat back, ignoring the man's request. \"You cannot let him go. He will tell the police-.\" \"What? That two people kidnapped him? All we have to do is give them Luca's address and they'll find more than just my dad underneath those floor boards. It'd be simple to mention that Ivan participated in the murder spree as well. He has nothing against us, lest he wishes for us to reveal the truth. And considering he attempted to flee to Poland, I really don't think he wants any more to do with this country.\" Heiter's frustration was evident. The grip he held on to the gun, tightened to the point where Abby was slightly concerned it'd accidentally go off. \"He is filth,\" he tried. \"I'm not disagreeing with you,\" she slowly protested. \"Actually, every nerve in my body is urging me to rip that gun out of your hand and finish this. But I came here to gain closure. To figure out what happened to my dad. I did just that. Anything else is outside my realm of control.\" \"But letting your father's murderer go is not closure!\" he insisted. \"Try to think of it this way. One of Jonas's children grows up and plans to investigate his murder. What he finds-.\" \"What the fuck are you talking about?\" Ivan harshly interjected. \"Murdered? You, bitch, murdered my brother?\" \"I killed your brother,\" Heiter answered back, eyes aimed on their captive. \"And I enjoyed every minute of it.\" Ivan straightened suddenly in his seat, eyes watering. Out of all the men Abby had ever known, Ivan had the greatest cycle of tear production. \"You-!\" He cut himself off by attempting to break through the bonds. Unfortunately, the ropes dug in and had cut off a fair amount of circulation. This meant less of a blood flow and eventual invalid muscle use. All he ended up doing was rocking back and forth a bit in the chair. Other than that, murder was left to glisten in his cold eyes. When he was done, Abby continued. \"But this offspring of Jonas Kappel, finds you and inquires as to why you murdered her dad. By some divine miracle, you tell her. If guilt were eating away with you, you'd welcome death in a heart beat. You'd know you were deserving of it. But think if she kept you alive, constantly pondering over what you'd done. Letting your conscious eat away everything that makes you alive. Now that is real torture.\" \"You forget that I lack an ability to feel guilt.\" \"You felt guilty when I went through that phase of constant fainting. You knew you were the cause of it.\" \"That was hardly guilt!\" he argued, having the audacity to cross his arms. One corner of Abby's lip twitched up. \"Well...whatever it was, it led you to make a decision to help me. Anyway, Ivan's going to go through the rest of his life, understanding that it were his actions alone which led to the crappy existence he lives in now. That's kind of brilliant.\" \"That is sloppy and stupid.\" \"That is meticulous and ingenious.\" \"Abby-.\" \"I get it. I do. We chased this bastard down. Met countless dead ends, watched our links dissolve before our eyes. I let you have free reign of his mental condition for eight hours. But, I feel like this is the right decision.\" \"It is a clumsy and foolish decision.\" \"I've already heard your take on the matter.\" \"And yet you still insist on following your logic. He is dangerous. Or perhaps you have forgotten what he has done to your father.\" She froze for a second, eyes narrowing. \"Heiter,\" she stated firmly, \"I will never forget what he did. If you could see the images running through my head right now, it'd make you shiver. But...I want him to go back into the world and live with the life he created for himself.\" \"Perhaps you are wrong! He is actually happy at this moment. Once you let him go, he will spend money on his lavish lifestyle. Flee the country and start a new life.\" \"Two problems. Number one, I'm pretty sure if left alone in a room with you for eight hours, he's feeling anything but happiness. In fact, I'm guessing his psyche is permanently scarred thanks to you. Number two, he's bankrupt. Or at least going that way. The cash you found on him? Enough to hop from hotel to hotel for awhile. The rest of his money is now being stashed away somewhere in a Frankfurt bank. Only it's not his money anymore. So I assure you, his life will not carry the lavish requirements it once did.\" Obviously unhappy, Heiter threw another glare at Ivan's struggling, red-faced form. \"I have watched you make decisions,\" he started. \"Decisions I may not have supported in the beginning, but found myself thankful I let you continue. Your ability to work around human emotions is beautiful. Your insight and ability to analyze objects could easily earn you a great career in the justice department. Despite all this, you decide to keep this man alive. I do not understand this.\" \"I've tried explaining it as best as I could. I don't know what else to say.\" There was an uncomfortable pause between the two, and Abby briefly wondered how smart of a decision this was. Ivan did atrocious things to my dad. That warrants some sort of torture. But I don't think I could carry it out, especially when he's so willing to die. \"Have something to eat first and think it over,\" he suggested, eyes falling back to her. \"It's not going to change my mind.\" \"At least eat something,\" he ordered. \"Okay...but there's no way in hell you're staying down here with him.\" \"Fine.\" With an uneasy peace, the two turned on their angry captive and ventured toward the stairs. \"Get back here!\" Ivan screamed, voice reaching an unbelievably high pitch. \"Tell me what the hell you did to Jonas!\" The two simultaneously ignored the request and ascended back upstairs. APHAPHAPHAPH \"Abby.\" Sighing, the blonde pushed away her grilled chicken. It was only half eaten, even though the taste was sensational. Jakob had a variety of spices to choose from and cooking for herself again made Abby far more at ease. Unfortunately, her stomach still didn't feel like ingesting large quantities of food. \"I haven't changed my mind,\" she informed. They'd been upstairs for an hour, both in a silent deliberation. She was quite aware of his need to make her see that a dead Ivan was the ultimate form of closure. But this couldn't displace her own sense of reason. \"I understand this.\" Surprised, Abby glanced up to find Heiter staring at her. His plate was clean and she was sure he'd went through five glasses of water already. \"I want to know what time you are leaving.\" \"Oh,\" she said, momentarily forgetting about everything that was packed in her bedroom. \"I guess I'll call Jakob after Ivan leaves. See if my visa has been renewed. If not, there's the US embassy in Berlin. If anything, I'll get deported back to my country because of an illegal residential stay from an expired passport. But however I get home doesn't bother me.\" Heiter nodded slowly, processing in the information. \"Your mother is dead.\" \"Yep.\" \"As is your father.\" \"That too.\" That realization still swam around inside, but she understood that the real heart ache would most likely hit when she returned. So, she tried not thinking about the final days of her dad too much. Instead, she marveled at his ability to have set up an intricate web of clues. \"You have no boyfriend.\" Smiling, she shrugged. \"Not that I'm aware of. You never know, though. Maybe in a month or two, I'll come back and visit Klaus.\" \"You have no friends.\" \"Some,\" she argued lightly. \"I guess we kind of broke apart after I dropped out of college. Maybe we'll reconnect.\" \"So you are only going back for the possibility of starting a new life?\" \"Isn't that enough?\" Her eyes were glued to the kitchen table, attempting to hold back tears. The longing to go home was ferocious and unwavering. She was tired. So, so tired of her ordeal. Of seeing people die without any ability to stop their deaths. Of constantly chasing after something out of reach. Tired, tired, tired. \"Who wouldn't want to walk away from this?\" she asked softly. Understanding reflected back at her when she glanced up, and for a moment, Abby realized the man sitting across from her would be thrust back into his old life. Of isolation and murderous intentions. Perhaps even allowing his mad idea to guide him again. I can't do anything about it. I really, really can't. The longer she stared, the less aware she became of her surroundings. I could tell someone. An authority figure about what Heiter planned on doing. I know it'd eat me up if I let this man continue on with his experiment on some other unfortunate victim. But this thought was met with firm resistance. The least I should do is not say anything. Think of everything he's done for me. He is the reason I am getting closure. There was no clear answer to her dilemma. Staying mute could put future people at risk of going through everything she and her companions had. And that was when his victims had gotten away. Imagine if he completed his experiment. Alerting someone made her feel guilty and deceitful. Like the trust they'd built with each other had been doomed from the start. And the parts of himself he'd put on display for her, parts she was sure had been hidden from the world for a long time, seemed sincere and sparked a potential change inside the man. Like there was really someone with a beating heart beneath the cold, inhuman exterior. That's selfish of me. To not say anything and endanger someone's life just so I don't feel guilty. Think how much guilt there would be if he did get away with his cruel experiment. Three ruined lives right there. \"You are thinking of turning me in.\" Widening her eyes, Abby shook off her brain's protests of answering. \"Yes,\" she admitted. \"I am.\" \"It is a struggle?\" \"More than you're aware of. I've got to know, though. When you first let me have all of that freedom inside your house, did you think in the back of your mind that I'd really stay quiet?\" Scratching at his chin, Heiter set his head upon his open palm. \"Honestly, I am more surprised you are thinking it over. I would have thought the answer to be clear.\" \"I did too,\" she murmured stubbornly. \"You are dangerous. If I say nothing, I can only think of the horrors I'm putting future lives into.\" \"Always thinking of others,\" he mused with a shake of the head. \"This isn't about me,\" she determined. \"My ordeal, while excruciating and terrifying, has passed. I've found new people to haunt my dreams. New words to replace my veins with ice. But you're still the same, I think. Are you?\" \"It would appear so.\" \"And you still want to perform unethical experiments on innocent people?\" He didn't respond immediately. In fact, his eyes journeyed down to the same table he'd slapped. \"The past few months,\" he finally said, \"have forced me to resort my intentions.\" \"Really?\" she asked in concealed amazement. \"You are not the only who has had revelations.\" The bitterness couldn't quite edge out of his comment in time, but Abby's awe didn't disappear. Could it be possible that his interaction with people made him realize humans weren't perishable? \"There were some good times,\" she admitted after a silent second. \"Even in the midst of the turmoil.\" \"Such as?\" Abby cleared her throat, index finger running across the table. She closed her eyes, parted her lips, and let loose an uneven voice. \"I know your eyes in the morning sun. I feel you touching in the pouring rain-.\" \"Please, stop.\" She edged open one eye and nearly followed his command, if he hadn't been attempting to contain his smile. \"-and the moment that you wonder far from ME, I wanna feel you in my arms again. And you come to me in a summer breeze, keep me warm in your love and softly leave. And it's me you need to show. How deep is your love,\" she sang brightly, notes stumbling all around the place. I should have just tortured Ivan with my singing voice. When both eyes sprang open, Abby had to cover her mouth or else a demented laugh would spill out. \"What band sings that song again?\" he asked. Using her palm like an oxygen tank, Abby said, \"Bee Gees.\" \"Let us keep it that way.\" The laugh blasted out like a jack-in-a-box, forcing her hand away and her eyes to close back up. Her entire face turned a tomato red and she had to keep her legs crossed or else she'd pee her pants. \"I don't know how many times I've said it,\" she mentioned, neutralizing her laughter, \"but you are a bastard.\" \"And I do not know why you find this amusing.\" \"Because you make me laugh. The stern surgeon with little empathy for others, making a joke. Something strange inside me likes that.\" Her smile didn't waver even when his expression turned solemn. \"Will you be telling others of what I had almost accomplished?\" The thought sobered her. But...she did have the answer. \"No. I know I could come to regret this decision, but a part of me trusts your supposed revelation.\" \"That is good.\" He said this with a relief, but Abby noted the way his eyes stayed on her a second longer than normal. \"Trust me like I've trusted you,\" she offered, holding out a hand. For a moment, she was sure he'd simply let it hang there for the rest of eternity. \"It won't bite,\" Abby promised. Finally, he brought his pale arm on to the table and grasped her hand. The grip was tight, but assertive. They shook once before releasing. \"Alright...now we've only got one last business to take care of,\" she announced. Töte mich! : Kill me! Maul halten : Shut up! Lol, I've actually got one more chapter left to put up. Some of you thought this was the end, but if you look up, this is Chapter 25. The English alphabet has 26 letters. But now you're thinking to yourself...wait...we're in the letter Z. What the hell? Well...I actually skipped a letter and that letter will be the title of the last chapter. Now you're all probably going to go scanning through the story, trying to figure out which letter I skipped. Maybe some of you realized it, but didn't mention anything. It was intentional, don't worry. Oh, and StrangeKindofMirror, as I was writing the last chapter, I made the exact same connection you had. Like I mentioned previously, making Ivan in love with Abby's father was completely a last minute choice. So as I was writing how in love Ivan was with Gregory, I thought of Gregory's daughter - Abby, and her situation with Heiter. I'm not saying whether anything is there or not, but it is most definitely an interesting concept of something so irresistible within the father-daughter that others become enthralled against their will toward the pair of them. Anywho, let me know your thoughts in a review![Chapter 26] Oh my gosh! Last chapter! Just want to say thank you to EVERYONE who reviewed. You will never know, EVER how grateful I am for them. So I'll leave you with this thought. If you had never reviewed, this entire story would never have been completed. I hope you feel absolutely wonderful about yourself and I want to thank you for continuously reading and continuously reviewing. These have been by far some of the best reviews, and some of the kindest readers I've ever gotten on this site. Whew...enough with the gushy talk. I've got a long chapter for you all and I needed a good few days to work on it. The ending is EXACTLY what I first decided on when I wrote the summary, the rest was just finding events to fill the eventual climax. So, I'm happy with it, but not everyone may be. Who knows? A lot of things happen this chapter though! I better shut up or else you'll never get to it. Please, as always, enjoy! Chapter 26 - Syndromia \"You are really as stupid as you look?\" Ivan questioned, eyes rigid as Abby sliced through the ropes binding him to the chair. \"Very easily, I can make this your burial ground,\" Heiter threatened from behind her. But the words were empty and Abby continued slicing through the ropes as if she hadn't heard either man. The knife she used was a harmless kitchen utensil, not particularly sharp or large. Still, it did its job. Her slices were deliberately slow, making sure Ivan didn't have to stumble out of the ropes once free. \"You will never see me again after this,\" Ivan vowed, feeling the blood flow back into his restrained limbs. \"I will continue living the rest of my life with the knowledge of what I accomplished. Killing your filthy father!\" Heiter glanced over at the bent woman, but her eyes remained focused on Ivan's feet, knife shredding through the rope keeping them immobile. \"Perhaps while I sit here, I will recount story of Gregory's final days,\" the man declared proudly. Within a second, the tip of Abby's knife was directed over Ivan's heart. It happened so quickly that the bound man hardly felt the breaking of skin. \"Just remember why he chose my mother and I over you,\" she said, voice neutral. And just like that, his cockiness disappeared. With a lingering stare, Abby brought the knife back and continued working on his legs. A great abundance of doubt raced through her mind during this time, but she forced it all out. Her decision called for a different type of torture. A torture she condoned because Ivan had led himself to this point in his life. When able to continue living in an existence of self hate, the individual slowly loses their own sense of self. This sort of tearing away of the soul was far more excruciating than anything she could ever think of doing to Ivan. Thus, the decision appeared impeccable. Finally, it came to where the last strand of rope sat poised in Abby's hand. Hesitation led her movements from then on. \"There is still time for me to kill him,\" Heiter mentioned. She didn't answer. Instead, her gaze traveled upward to meet Ivan's. \"You're not sorry for taking him away from me. Taking away the only man I've ever loved and the only man you've ever loved. But I do want to know this. Was life better for you when he was gone?\" Ivan's glare receded and momentarily, his anger was not so brash. He opened his mouth once, ready to answer, but decided against it. Still, the somber look did not disappear. \"It wasn't better for me either,\" she answered. \"My mom slowly killed herself when he didn't return home. I had to watch that. Day by day, unsure of how to stop her. Parentless before the age of 11, imagine that! Some good did come of it though. The reliance and confidence I have in myself is really quite amazing. I'm independent, and thanks to my dad, able to read the unspoken words on strangers faces. My mom also taught me a few things about medicine which actually helped me save the lives of three people. What about you? What good came to you from my dad's death?\" He remained stubbornly silent, so Abby responded for him. \"By the looks of it, you probably felt the happiness for half a day. Then, you woke up one morning and realized the person you were in love with, would never be there again. No longer could you attempt to make them love you. No longer would you see their smiling face. No longer would you be able to converse with them. They were gone. Just like that. A lifetime of happiness obliterated just for a few hours of pleasure. Pleasure you won't get back or feel ever again.\" \"Shut up.\" \"Okay. But I want you to think about that very carefully.\" And with a last minute glance, Abby cut away the remaining piece of rope. She stood up, observing the man carefully. Behind her, Heiter had revealed his gun just in case. \"Thank you for telling me what happened,\" she ended up expressing. \"Even if you were the low life responsible, at least I know.\" Ivan only clutched on to the wooden handles of the chair, head hanging down. She couldn't confirm what it was he was staring at, but she did know enough to take another step back and allow the man room. A blanket of heavy silence covered the cellar and left the slightest discomfort rumbling in Abby's stomach. Heiter's ready to kill him. All I have to do say is say-No! It must have been a full three minutes before Ivan lifted his head. After this, Abby turned her back on him. She didn't need to see his face anymore. A part of her was fearful that the person staring back at her would only provoke her into action. Her eyes moved to the cellar stairway instead, wondering already about what going home was going to be like. I cleaned the entire place after mom's death so everything should be emptied out, ready for a redecoration. Of course I'll still keep it like she had it, just with a few minor alterations. It's too homey of a place to redo completely. And the picture of dad...it'll go right next to the picture of mom. The one of her sitting alone at the kitchen table, looking down with one of her rare smiles, over a birthday cake. That cake took the whole fucking day to make, but it was worth it to see that look on her face. Last year before she overdosed. So preoccupied with this memory, Abby didn't realize what had transpired behind her right away. While she'd pondered over her mother, Ivan had let out a piercing scream and sprinted blindly out of his chair. Like a horsepowered, wind up toy. With a hunter's aggression, he fully intended to attack her from behind and brutalize her as awfully as he could, if not for Heiter. The sudden blast, followed by a deafening echo of the gun releasing one lone bullet, displaced any thoughts stumbling around in the room. After the echo died, Abby realized her entire spine had stiffened and for a moment, she stood petrified. Eyes wide, lips parted, breaths just barely flowing out. Seconds later, she lifted an arm, just to see the back of it sprayed with scarlet blood. \"Shit,\" she mumbled, the gun blast still vibrating voluminously inside her ear drums. Slowly, her gaze drifted over to Heiter's form. One hand levitated before him, gun clutched tightly and barrel just about losing its smoke. He met her eyes with a blank stare. Hesitating, Abby continued turning, fully aware of the sudden wet patch through her back. She guessed the t-shirt was ruined forever. Ivan laid spread out on the floor, blood quickly gushing out of the bullet hole in his chest, seeping into the brown carpet. Both hands were spread in a falling motion and from her height, she realized death had taken him while his eyes were still open. \"He was ready to attack you,\" Heiter defended before she could get out a word. Abby stared at the body for two whole minutes, memorizing the small details. Cartoonish, wide eyes. Mouth parted in a fit of rage. Fingers set in a sort of clawing motion, surely intended for her. Then, she smiled. \"You are not angry?\" the surgeon questioned, taking a few careful steps toward her. He'd carefully noted the exchange of emotions on her face, but did not expect happiness to be one of them. Her eyes traveled up to meet his and there was an inaudible knowing playing out on her features. \"No,\" she answered, \"I'm not.\" Heiter's forehead scrunched in confusion. Quickly, he scanned the dead body, then the woman standing before it, still wearing a content grin. Abby could literally visualize his brain attempting to make sense of everything at light speed. \"You baited him,\" he finally determined, eyes widening. \"You said the right words to make him react once he was free.\" She tilted her head, but the green in her eyes spoke for her. Once she saw he wasn't going to continue, the blonde sighed, smile falling. \"I was hoping you'd pull the trigger.\" The shock couldn't quite scurry out of Heiter's face fast enough. \"But you-.\" \"Do you really think I was going to let the bastard keep living in this world? Never mind killing my dad for a minute. He murdered Steffan and if left on his own, would do the same to who knows how many people.\" \"So-.\" \"One of those last minute decisions in my head. I had to make it appear like I was going to let him go. Make him inhale that hope that he might actually survive, because you are right. Despite the guilt and hate inside him, he would have lived long enough to forget the incident. Not completely, but comfortably.\" \"Then why-.\" \"I couldn't do it myself,\" she admitted sadly. \"The thought of killing him still tied to the chair, made me uneasy. I mean he didn't even have a fighting chance, restrained. And I'd never ask you to do such a daunting task. Kill someone who hadn't physically provoked you. That's a bit more inhumanity then I'd like to see.\" The man still couldn't wipe away the sudden turn of events. \"You had no guarantee that I would shoot him.\" Biting at her lip, Abby shrugged, studying her shoes. \"I trusted you. That was enough guarantee.\" At his heavy stare, she glanced up. \"Are you alright with that?\" \"I wish you would have told me.\" The grin returned. \"I don't know if I could have been convincing enough if you knew. Besides, I genuinely wanted to see what Ivan would do. Maybe he would have left. I didn't have a plan for that.\" \"There was little doubt he would attack.\" \"Yes.\" \"Hmm,\" the man mused, finally displacing his surprise, \"I did not think you capable of such a trick.\" \"I guess he just got to me,\" Abby muttered. \"And I'm sure the guilt will come. But you were right once again. This is closure.\" Nodding to himself, Heiter glanced down at his gun, then at the body. \"Should have thought about the stains in the carpet,\" she observed, thinking of Jakob. \"Nothing says thank you for your hospitality like a dead body in the cellar.\" \"He has the tools to rid the carpet easily.\" \"Doesn't mean we shouldn't tidy up the place.\" They shared one last look with each other before approaching Ivan Kappel's dead body. APHAPHAPHAPH Two hours later found the duo scanning over the newly cleansed carpet. Abby was sure that deep within the fiber strands, they'd missed a few red specs. But otherwise, the area appeared just as even as the rest of the room. Of course it helped having the carpet a dark color as well. They'd first moved Ivan's body onto a separate white bed sheet. Abby had cleaned the wound so no more blood would flow out and seep through the sheet. The body still lay in the cellar, upon a sturdy, ancient dining table. Heiter only reaffirmed that Jakob would take care of the problem once she'd voiced her concern. Next, they'd grabbed a six pack of paper towels, and filled a bucket with cold water. \"Dish washing soap would work best,\" she had mumbled, observing the five foot by six, circular splatter. \"If not that, then Bleach.\" So, they set to work. As Abby dabbed at the blood, she did think of the consequences of her actions. I purposely provoked a man to his death. But her mind only worded it one way. It was the lesser of two evils. And Ivan's death didn't mean she was a cold blooded killer. At least that's what she tried to reason. I wanted him dead not just because of what he'd done, but what he might do if he had gotten away. Heiter hadn't commented anymore about her elaborate scheme, but he seemed to have held nothing against her. In fact, there was a brief flash of triumph upon his face right before they'd covered the dead man's body. Still, even as she worked at cleaning away the evidence of what she'd done, there was unease resting inside her. Whether it was from the potential guilt she knew would come for her later, or something else, she didn't know. Nonetheless, it sat there like a ten ton stone, stubbornly waiting to be removed. \"Abby.\" Shaking herself out of her thoughts, the blonde stepped back from the newly washed carpet and met the surgeon's eyes. \"Yes?\" \"Do you want to know what I did to him?\" All of a sudden, her pulse began thumping like a basketball, directly in tune with the steady increase of her heart rate. Vaguely, the echo of the gunshot resonated through her head. She was sure the slight buzz would continue to echo for the next few weeks. \"There is no guilt to feel anymore,\" he offered. \"He is dead.\" \"Why do you want to tell me?\" \"Because you still appear unsatisfied.\" Far more unnerved at the simple surveillance, Abby's eyes found the body wrapped tightly in white sheets, across the room. Is that the source of my unease? Or will that only make my unease greater? \"What the hell,\" she shrugged. \"Just let me get a new t-shirt on first.\" APHAPHAPHAPH Inside the kitchen, Abby sat at her usual place while Heiter stood across from her. If she'd have known any better, he seemed more nervous than she was. \"Removal of certain body parts are an incredible enforcer of obedience,\" Heiter began, hands behind him. He still wore his white t-shirt and blue jeans, but this didn't take away from the superior stance he had settled into. \"Did you?\" she asked. \"No. However, he did not believe me at first. Only when I dug the knife into his groin, did he finally begin to understand what was to happen. But, his voice still remained defiant. The man would not shut up for two seconds, even when he was frightened. So, it came as no surprise that I grabbed on to his tongue and pushed the blade into it.\" Abby forced back a twitch, imagining the scene. \"He stopped talking so often after then.\" \"So...if you didn't physically harm him, what made him so ready to tell me everything?\" \"I did not threaten to kill him. Instead, I told him of my profession.\" Understanding the knowing look in his eye, Abby quickly glanced away. \"You were going to...I mean, you thought about-.\" \"I even explained how close I came. His horror was very similar to yours when I first captured you. But unlike you, the idea could not disappear easily. As I told him of how I would perform on him, he released his bladder. And once that fear was instilled, I could not stop myself. There were some very dark ideas coming out of my mouth. Ideas that even I am not comfortable with, but at one time, am sure have crossed my mind.\" Despite herself, Abby had to ask. \"No,\" Heiter argued. \"I will not repeat them.\" \"But they terrified Ivan?\" \"Yes. As the interrogation carried on, I came to find out what kind of man he was. Very vain and could not bear the idea of disfigurement or physical pain. At one point, he attempted to rebel against me. Move in his chair and scream.\" \"What did you do?\" she said, sickeningly engrossed. \"I tore out a great chunk of his hair in the back. You did not see it, of course.\" Thinking of her own hair, she thought of it being viciously yanked out all the way from the roots inside her skull. This made her blanch and involuntarily reach for the back of her scalp. \"When he cried, something I had hoped for, I brought out tape.\" \"Tape? What for?\" A sly grin appeared on his features, but at her fixed stare, he dropped it. \"I put the tape over his mouth. This restricted the air flow and sent his body into a panic. Afterward, I pinched his nostrils shut. I told him for every time I see another tear, I will add on another second of holding his nostrils shut.\" \"And?\" \"He passed out after the tears could not stop, but not before nearly suffocating on his own spit.\" \"And this is when you went upstairs for a drink,\" she connected. \"Yes. By this point, he was still not completely compliant. And I understood your discomfort about leaving physical scars. So, I had to search my imagination for more ideas.\" Abby momentarily thought to ask Heiter to stop. That further explanation would sicken her to her stomach. But, the fascination had built up to an unbelievable peak. And she knew the man wouldn't tell her if he didn't think she could handle it. Reluctantly, she kept her ears open. \"He had been deprived of sleep for a full day, perhaps more. He was awake by the time I came back down, but each time he closed his eyes, I pressed the tip of my knife underneath a finger nail and slowly lifted up.\" Her eyes widened, fingers twitching at the words. \"I had brought down with me some water, but I did not give it to him. His need for thirst was obvious and I made a great deal of informing him he would not get the water if he did not answer the questions. With the threat of physical repercussion, sleep depravation, starvation, and solitary confinement, he began to slowly unravel. Of course I was not exactly civil toward him. Every threat imaginable, I voiced toward him. So often and so commonly that he began to believe I would actually carry them out. Finally, I offered him a sip of water. He lapped at it as if he was a dog, so I held it back and practiced obedience. I would not give him water if he did not repeat certain things.\" \"You humiliated him,\" she finished. \"The way he humiliated your father,\" he noted, the slightest hint of defensiveness in his tone. This quieted her. \"I almost wish you would have been there. The transgression from mouthy, elusive man to bumbling, submissive boy was...incredible.\" For a moment, she wished she was too. \"What finally broke him?\" she coughed, throat suddenly parched. \"More threats.\" \"Oh...how were they different than the ones you'd originally told?\" \"I had every intention of carrying these out, and he knew this.\" \"So...were they something like 'tell us what you know or I'll cut off your balls'?\" \"Make sure not a single detail is misplaced or I will snap the tendons in your achilles,\" he repeated without a bat of the eyelash. She blinked. \"Or more importantly, make sure Abby gets what she came for or you will no longer have teeth to run your tongue over. His mouth was a sensitive subject, I think. He prided it very much.\" \"You directly involved me as part of the threat?\" \"Only to make his instructions clear. After I was done, he was completely at your disposal.\" Without a word, Abby shifted through the eight hour journey with Heiter. Only this time, she was in Ivan's position. No wonder he was so fearful. That's not even a strong enough word for it. No sleep, and then your nails being torn off if you tried. Constant fear of a knife being used to slice off your tongue or other body parts. No food or water. Being left alone for hours, then suddenly in the presence of a man who explains in great detail, what he plans on doing to you. The humiliation of begging for water, then repeating whatever it is Heiter wants. Pissing yourself. Crying. The trauma can't be overstated. And that was when he refrained from incorporating medical tools. \"I don't know what to say,\" she finally proclaimed. \"I am to guess a thank you would be pushing it.\" \"Right off a cliff. But...we needed this. And despite my repulsion, I still can't believe you accomplished what you did in eight hours.\" And only after his admission did Abby finally admit the unease she had felt being lodged within her stomach, vanished. Maybe the images of my dad attempting to crawl with broken wrists and ankles while Ivan pisses on him, is canceled out with what Heiter did. And God knows I could have easily ordered him to use the knife. \"I'm really at a loss. So...consider my bewilderment as a thank you...I think.\" A smile briefly flung itself across his features. Then, for the first time since Abby first stepped into the country, she realized with incredible clarity - it was over! Every grueling, challenging, harming, mentally stressful, event was done. A clean, safe home awaited her back in the States. A new life. A new sense of understanding the world. And just these thoughts alone nearly made black spots appear before her eyes. \"It's over,\" she announced softly, her grin refusing to be contained. \"It's finally over.\" Somewhat in a daze, she lifted herself up. In the back of her mind, a voice commanded her to attain freedom at all costs. Which meant phoning Jakob to see if her traveler's visa was ready. But midway through venturing to the kitchen phone, she switched directions to her bedroom. Maybe I should get my things first. He might be in the area. The relief continued to course through her like an electric current, forcing her body into a state of relaxation for her own benefit. Because anything else would surely cause another fainting spell. Abby paused in both steps just before the kitchen parted way into the hallway. The silence from her companion, while not uncommon, seemed odd all of a sudden. What else can I say? He planned on performing on me as if I was hardly a living being, then killing me, and then decided on keeping me captive for two months. But then there's the side that I caught a glimpse of and couldn't quite believe existed. The time he put into helping me and of course, pulling the trigger at the time I needed him to most. Those are things I can't leave unsaid. So, Abby turned around, intent on saying at least something . Nothing could have prepared her for the sight she met. Heiter stood not even a full fifteen feet away, gun pointed directly at her. Not only did she not see it coming, but she'd hardly heard him prepare himself. That's what I get for constantly thinking. His face was completely unreadable and eerily reminiscent of when they'd first met. Or more specifically, when she had stared at him, staring at her, through the window of his home on that chill, autumn night so many nights ago. She made no qualms on trying to hide the disbelief shining on her face. \"After all this,\" Abby began, voice far more level than her emotions were, \"you're going to kill me. Granted, I am a loose end. But after everything I've been through, you're going to put a bullet in my body.\" He didn't answer. \"How long had you been planning on doing this?\" she nearly sputtered, swallowing back her panic. Their positions were suddenly regressed back to captor and captive in seconds. But, she made an urgent note to keep playing up their current positions as equals. Inequality made death a simpler option. When he continued to stay silent, Abby sighed. I can't believe it. There was a bitter pang of embarrassment at not having picked up on this elusive emotion, rocketing through her bones. How could I have? The only guy better at hiding his emotions than him is my dad, and I hardly knew him. Maybe I'll be seeing him sooner than I realize. This was further supported when Heiter took another calculative step toward her. The safety was clearly off and his finger stayed frighteningly close to the trigger. Then, he cleared his throat. As if his next words were unrehearsed. \"I am not going to kill you.\" Her confusion was immediate, but she uttered not a single word, no matter how enormous her curiosity was. \"The last thing I want to do,\" Heiter explained, gun still aimed directly at her, \"is kill you.\" Blinking, Abby responded, \"You have a strange way of showing it.\" \"That is to be expected.\" \"Okay...then why exactly are you pointing your gun at me?\" She swore that all of the traffic, and the birds, and the generator, and all other sound, completely vanished after the question was asked. All that was left were the two beings inside the kitchen. \"Because if I don't, you will leave.\" Her body simultaneously fought back a shiver and a gulp. \"I thought you were insistent about me leaving,\" she reminded. \"I thought I was too. But perhaps even then, I was denying my fondness of you.\" \"Fondness? I'm afraid I don't follow.\" But the look he threw her made her realize he'd been thinking over this far longer than she could ever have guessed. \"No,\" she argued, waving a hand. \"No, no, no. You hate me.\" \"I never said this.\" \"But you-.\" \"I will admit that my actions may have expressed this.\" The shaking couldn't be contained this time. \"I-.\" But she was speechless. Not a single word could calm or alter the confrontation. This was really happening. So, she listened helplessly to his words. Words that were just as difficult for him to say as they were for her to ingest. \"For a very long time, I have been on my own. And experiences have taught me this was best. I must have met the worst of humanity in my life. They are the ones that kept me hating it. How easy it was to label you no different. Some tourist girl, maybe. Lost, selfish, and expendable. Just as the other girls.\" Abby's gulp got stuck in her throat, and tears nearly bunched up as she inhaled. Do not cry, damn it. Do not fucking cry. \"It must have been immediate, my interest in you. From your childish psychology. Or I would have killed you before you were able to speak to Jonas. But watching you usher him into death in my language, kept that interest in my head constantly.\" \"Stop-.\" \"I will not,\" he argued firmly. \"Not this time. Not when I have reserved what I have felt for so long.\" \"I thought you preferred it that way.\" \"As I mentioned, I've had a revelation. And you have never judged me as of yet.\" An incredulous frown befell her lips. \"You are saying you did not notice the change?\" he questioned indignantly, taking a step forward. \"What your personality made me act like? I felt everything from the deepest hate to...things I have thought were not relevant to feel anymore.\" The last was said harshly, as if she personally denied the words. \"How-.\" \"Your attitude. Your perception of life. Talking to me despite what I had put you through. Trusting me. And of course never giving in. You did it in such a beautiful way.\" \"I-.\" \"Your intelligence,\" he continued, seemingly lost within his own declaration. \"Finally someone to communicate with who had a decent mind. Watching you pick apart people - situations. That was far more stimulating than you could imagine. Like I choose instruments before surgery, you chose emotions off the plates of each person you met.\" Each time Abby tried to get out a word, she stopped herself at the intensity Heiter's face progressed into. \"You can't like me,\" she finally tried, denial settling in. \"You never-.\" \"Not everybody is as forthcoming with their feelings as Klaus,\" he noted bitterly. Her eyes expanded into two saucers, heart beating at break neck speed against her chest. If she didn't relax herself, her heart would surely break through her ribs. \"I do not know,\" he mused for a moment, \"who I would like to have killed more. Ivan or Klaus.\" \"Klaus did nothing wrong,\" she defended. The more intense Heiter's features became, the less she was able to decipher them. \"Nothing wrong?\" he laughed, gun hand shaking a bit. \"He attempted to separate you from me.\" \"Maybe with good reason.\" For a brief second, something so incredibly dangerous and dark flashed across the surgeon's features that Abby hoped he'd pull the trigger just to escape what ever poisonous thought invaded his mind. \"You are not taking this well,\" he finally commented, tilting his head. \"You've got to pardon me for not jumping for joy at having a gun pointed at me.\" \"Like I said, I do not plan on killing you.\" \"I don't know why else you'd have it in your hand then,\" she retorted, fighting down the vulnerability her voice was set on adopting. \"In fact, if you really wanted to kill me, you'd have done it already. I think maybe it's for scare.\" He didn't answer, nor indicate whether her words were accurate or not. With heart still drumming like a woodpecker, Abby took a cautious step backwards. Her green eyes stayed focused on Heiter, unsure exactly what she'd do upon the slightest of movements. When no move was made from her captor, she sucked in a deep breath and allowed another foot to fall behind. \"I'm going to go to my room,\" she began as bravely as she could. \"I'm going to get my clothes. Then, I'm going to go home. This is what I want, Heiter. I appreciate everything you've done for me, but I can't take anymore stress. Anymore pressure. I need to go home.\" When he continued to remain silent, Abby let out a calmer breath. Maybe he's not serious enough to do this. Carefully, she took him in a final time before spinning around. With her back to him, the level of vulnerability increased. But she had to do it eventually or else she'd have stood in that kitchen for ever. Unfortunately, her palms were sweating like crazy, something that's never happened before, and her vision seemed to blur at the edges. No, I will not faint now. Stay awake, damn it! Finally, an opening presented itself in which her fears did not prevent her from attempting a first step into the hallway. But as soon as the foot sunk down, Abby's ears picked up the cock back Heiter's thumb initiated on the hammer of the gun. \"If you try to run -.\" She cringed at the forcefulness of the last word. \"-I will put a bullet through your leg. That would force at least a six month stay in bed.\" Her heartbeat nearly ceased altogether. \"Why are you doing this?\" she exclaimed, twisting back toward him. \"I still don't understand how you're suddenly interested in me when all your actions implied 'get away'. And now...you're going to be selfish enough to keep me from moving on just because I've entered your life? That's not right.\" She said this last part tiredly, not exactly sure which emotion to feel. Her ability to empathize with the man still had not yet been removed even as he threatened to shoot her. And there in lay the problem. Despite his threat, Abby had formed an unacknowledged bond to him. All the singing and teasing she'd carried on around him, made her realize she'd enjoyed it just as much as had. The actual solving of the mystery and witnessing some spectacular events, gripped her down in her feet. If that didn't showcase her own fault for letting it escalate to this point, she didn't know what else properly could. He's threatening more than to just shoot me. C'mon, dumbo. You know what this is. She tried desperately to fight off the thought, but it rose from beneath the ground she'd buried it in. \"It is selfish of me,\" he agreed. \"But after all of these years, I find that I can afford to be so. And even if you did run...Jakob would have nothing to offer you. He does not have your passport. I do. I burned it shortly after we came here.\" The undying hopelessness physically made her sick. \"Is there anything you carry about? Reason? What's right?\" \"I care about you very much.\" They both seemed surprised once the words were voiced out loud. \"You're lying.\" \"I would not be threatening to shoot you in the leg, if I did not care.\" The snort came out faster than the horror on her face, and mixed in together, Abby was sure she looked like an elephant who'd accidentally snorted cocaine. \"You certainly have a way with words.\" \"And despite all of this,\" he observed, \"you still keep a sharp tongue and level head.\" \"Disability,\" she mumbled. \"Appeal,\" he counter argued. \"If you're not going to shoot me...then what do you want from me?\" He seemed stuck between a few options, none of which Abby particularly thought she'd enjoy. I could always try running for it. But Heiter had been clear. If there was anything she was absolutely sure he'd do, it was shoot her in the leg. To prevent her from leaving. Just because-. \"Why are you telling me this?\" \"Because I think Heiter has been in the process of experiencing Syndromia for quite awhile now.\" No. No, no, no. No! \"Abby...you may not see it because you're so distracted about what's going on, but Heiter has formed an entirely unhealthy attachment to you.\" The conversation poured into one ear like one would pour tea into a cup. Make it stop. Make it stop! \"But I couldn't help studying Heiter's reaction either. To see if I was right so I could warn you.\" \"Warn me about what?\" \"About what his Syndromia could turn into. All of the results with the few studies we had, were not a good outcome for the victim. Most of them were never seen again.\" No, it wasn't real. Abby knew it wasn't real. A fictitious disorder discovered by a desperate psychologist after a bad week of sleep and an incoming divorce. They hadn't even taught it in her own university as she pursued the psych classes. No . \"Whenever I stood near you, there was a split second of fury on his face. When I took your hand, you didn't see his step forward to rip it away. You don't see it because you're distracted. No one blames you for that. But the man does not act toward you like he should. That initial hate he had in the beginning, should have resulted in your death numerous times. I hate to say this, but it's the truth. Haven't you wondered why he hadn't killed you for having the wrong blood tissue? Or saving your friends? Or kissing him? The way he's opened up to you, but refuses to anybody else, is not typical of a captor-captive relationship.\" Abby tried making the words stop by blasting it out. \"I know your eyes in the morning sun, I feel you touching in the pouring rain-.\" Her eyes slammed shut together in panic. Nearly drowning out all other noise, Abby's heart raced as if it were working for multiple persons. The sweat continued to gather on the inside of her hands like a waterfall. No. No. No. No. No. The repetition, however, was entirely unnecessary. Somehow, the words kept on filing in like cars to a baseball stadium. \"But I am giving you this warning, Abby. Heiter cares for you far deeper than you do for him. And you know how dangerously intelligent he is. Eventually, something will shift in your relationship. Unfortunately, I can't say it will be in your favor.\" With eyes bolted tight, she failed to notice the other man approach her. All Abby felt was fear unlike any she'd ever experienced. Like she'd just rode a rollercoaster to the top of Mt. Everest and all she could do was wait in anticipation for the drop back down into an unrecognizable blackness. The drop was not pleasant, nor one she would easily be able to ascend from. In fact, at the bottom lay an unknown she hadn't ever considered. Wouldn't consider. \"The thing that you confuse as Syndromia, is nothing but his hate receding for the time being.\" Truth or a lie? Even as she recognized herself the speaker of the sentence, Abby suddenly for the life of her, couldn't determine which. Wouldn't. He can't be experiencing it. Briefly, she wondered why she was so against the thought. Beside the obvious instability of the man and the manner in which they'd first met, his declaration could be considered sweet to some people considering how aloof he was usually. I think I'm petrified about what this means. And angry that I dismissed it. Because it couldn't have been real. It-. \"Abby.\" The low grumble in which he'd said her name caused the blonde to pop open both eyes. She nearly recoiled at how close they were. He stood not even a full five feet away, gun still aimed at her, only further down. So if he approached any closer, the barrel would run directly into her thigh. \"What?\" she sputtered, seeing her options suddenly vanish before her eyes. \"I don't wish to hurt you.\" \"You'll let me go home?\" she asked hopefully. \"Only if that home is with me,\" he answered with no room to argue in his voice. \"You're mistaken then. My only home is back in the States. Where my family lived. Where I will continue to live.\" Her gutsy speech was interrupted by his hand outstretching, gun suddenly far closer to her leg than it previously was. \"I had hoped this would not be by force,\" he admitted. \"I am not going back to that place,\" she nearly spat, trembling at the thought of the countless, white bedrooms. And the basement. Dear God, not the fucking basement. \"We won't. That is simply a villa I own.\" Her heart sunk into the digestive system of her stomach. \"You own another home?\" she questioned quietly, legs shaking. \"Far more secluded-.\" He said it like it was a proud investment. \"-and less detectable. In fact, the purchase is not even under my name.\" His brown gaze filled in the rest of the story. \"No one will find us,\" she concluded. \"No. And I am tired of sharing you with the rest of the world.\" There was an irrational note of possessiveness within his tone, something she was sure he wanted her to pick up on. \"But…I want to go home.\" \"Think of your place with me as that,\" he answered, his features softening briefly. Run. Just run. \"Don't,\" he commanded. And he was finally close enough to press the tip of the metal weapon into her thigh. One quick scan over his expression informed her of two terrifying things. He would do it in a heartbeat. And. She would be subjected not only to a bed for six months, but to his constant care. If he truly wished to, he could keep the wound from never closing properly. In that case, she'd be his prisoner forever. The sob broke through from nowhere, sounding like a wounded animal caught in a sharp trap. She didn't cry, but the need to was nearly overwhelming. \"Do not think this a bad thing,\" he explained, voice growing unnaturally soft again. \"I will never hurt you and I will provide the attention and affection you will not get upon your journey back.\" \"That is not yours to give,\" she nearly growled out. Her words had no impact on him whatsoever. \"This life will be everything you want,\" he promised his free hand extending until it reached the back of her head. With an uncommon gentleness, he ran his thumb through a blonde lock and set it behind her ear. His other fingers splayed over her neck, enjoying the warmness there. It felt like her tongue had permanently sealed itself to the roof of her mouth, allowing not a single protest. What else could she say? If she fled, he'd shoot her. But if she stayed...well that nearly caused her to drown in the fear filling her up. And the worst thing yet? The formally blurred edges she'd come to know, made a sudden vengeful appearance. Only they did not stay contained to the edges, but drifted instead, into her focal point. \"Please,\" she murmured, unsure who she was talking to. \"Please, don't.\" Heiter immediately recognized what was happening. In reply, he pulled the gun back from her leg and instead with his free hand, pulled her into him. The hug was awkward and tense. The further she tried to tug away, the harsher he tried to keep her in his embrace. \"Shh,\" he soothed, head resting in the crook of her neck. \"It will be alright.\" \"No,\" she moaned, \"no. Please, no.\" But her head only pounded in response as the grip on her tightened. Suddenly, she could smell the shampoo she had used so long ago, on him. The sweet smell contributed to the dizziness her brain stumbled through. One hand clutched on to his shoulder, tear drops squeezing out from between her lids. Her body could no longer control her body's response to shut down. Without wanting to, her feet crumbled. Just let me fall, damn it. So I can try crawling away. Heiter instead, did the gentlemanly thing. As her body anchored itself down to the ground, he supported her weight with arms still locked around her. The entire time, his face stayed in between her collarbone and jaw. \"I cannot wait for you to smell like me again,\" he remarked as the blackness seeped into Abby's vision for a final time. Still, despite the visual incapacitation, her ears could detect every mumble underneath Heiter's breath. \"You will come to love it, I know this. We will have an unlimited amount of time to know each other. This time, I will not be so harsh and cold. We will talk about art and I will try teaching you better German and you teach me better English. I will laugh at your jokes instead of trying to deny they were funny. I will do so much for you. So much.\" If her eyes were still open, they'd have widened into an unheard of diameter. \"Please,\" she muttered back weakly. The weight of his head suddenly disappeared and based on the clutch she had on his shoulder, the man was facing her directly. There was a disquieting moment in which Abby was absolutely sure Heiter would begin leaning his head in. Why else would he just sit there and stare at her semi conscious form? With a flinch, she suddenly felt both man's cool hands settle on each side of her face. One was tilting up her jaw and the others fingers trailed through the mass of blonde her hair. \"You will hate me at first,\" he all but determined, voice reaching that unbelievably soft texture again. \"You value your freedom. I am expecting this. But that is how we began before. \" Abby wanted to spit something back to him. Something about how wrong this all was. Unfortunately, the only thing to come to mind was the dream she'd had of the lion. Is this what it meant by choosing my own fate? Because I had so steadily ignored Klaus's warning, I deserve this. \"The next time you awake,\" his last soft words promised, \"you will be home.\" She tried to plead, but darkness swam like an impeding tsunami. It might not be so bad. This thought lasted half a second before being obliterated. The man who currently promised her asylum with him for the rest of her life, hardly made decisions based off of reason. That's why he likes me. Why he can't bare to let go. Because I rarely do so myself and it's so seldom to find someone who sees so much potential in the worst of beings. Soon after this thought passed, her hearing gradually dimmed until dying altogether. All Abby knew was a familiar darkness. And all she feared before the darkness took her away, was the future she'd unknowingly created for herself with a madman she had unwittingly come to understand. I want to stress something about Heiter. With the exception of one time (when he pointed the gun at Abby's head toward the beginning of the story, intending to kill her), I never wrote anything in his POV. So, I wanted you all to feel like Abby was. To be focused on the mystery of her dad, completely unaware of what was going through the surgeon's mind. Even as Klaus hinted at it, I think the thought of Abby reaching closure is far more important. If you think his sudden shift into an obsessed madman is very, well...sudden, then I'm glad. He had been gradually building and building with his emotions, constantly wondering what he should do with Abby. The more oblivious she was to his attention toward her, the easier it was for him to want her. Completely. While I may not have written this, I wanted to explain that this was what was happening inside him. That, and Syndromia - again, false disorder but I thought it'd be interesting to have a reverse case of Stockholm Syndrome and not write a character in love with their captor. Because know this, while Abby understands at the very end why exactly Heiter has this deep affection for her, it doesn't mean she accepts it. She wanted to go home, and at the end of the story, still remembers despite everything, what Heiter had put her through. That sort of logic is what made fainting for the final time, such a bittersweet moment. Also, I want to explain why in a very messed up way, these two are perfect for each other, even without meaning to be. Abby is a naturally open minded person, but this is extended tenfold with her dad's history. She's come to see that all killers are not emotionless, cold blooded people. In fact, with the affection her dad showed her, she does the same without realizing it, upon other people. This other person being Heiter who really does not give a crap about anyone else but himself. He simply finds those type of feelings weak and unnecessary. And after such a long isolation, there is very little to him emotionally. So, upon their first meeting, Abby didn't capture his attention like some school boy in love. Instead, she appealed to him through something he valued greatly above all - intelligence. This included her knowledge of German language, vocal opinions that sounded well thought out, knowledge of medicine, and even her incredible strength mentally. Gradually, he discovered that she was very strange. She was often calm, and responded back to him as if he hadn't done everything he had to her. First, this is a frustrated topic of confusion for him, but later on, I think it morphs into a hope that she'd be able to forget about what he did to her once he realizes her importance to him - something he denies like a madman. After months within each others presence, they gain a mutual understanding of each other - to a certain degree. Abby realized there's more to the surgeon than meets the eye and a part of her cannot stop the curiosity from building. And added in with Gregory's disappearance and eventual murder, this brings them closer together - to understand who the other is. The rest of the story is just Abby pushing that boundary (joking around, singing like a mad woman, or being very kind), not really realizing that Heiter is coming to enjoy it. I don't know how else I can put it into words, because they are in my head, but not really coming out on here. Still, I hope that explained something. Finally, the end of this story is meant for your imagination to go wild and wonder what Abby's life will be like from here on. She's not happy, and you can't guarantee it will end like it did the first time. He is forcibly imprisoning her, and it's scarier because he's doing it out of an emotion he hasn't felt that often in his life. And despite Heiter's softness toward her, he is still just as calculating and dangerous. If he spent all of this time carrying out this plan, there is very little he won't do to make sure she does not leave. This is where his steel resolve would snap back into place. In some ways, he's completely different than he was at the beginning of the story. In other ways, completely the same. Now, I would at this point begin thanking my reviewers like crazy...except that...well, I have this idea for writing one more chapter, only, it's not really a chapter. It's like more of an aftermath or epilogue. The setting would be after an undeterminable amount of time from this past chapter and I'd kind of touch on, but not go in as deep description wise, of what life is like for Abby after the second kidnapping. It would definitely be far darker than how this chapter ended. However, it does not have to be written. I've got an idea, but if you guys think it's wise to just end it here, I will do as such. For some of you, it might be better just to use your imagination rather than me write the next installment. So, as always, let me know your thoughts in a review, and specifically, whether you want one last piece. Otherwise, my thanks can not express what your words have meant to me. Thank you all so very, very much and I love you all.[Chapter 27] I began this Epilogue with the tremendous support of some incredible reviewers. You will all be credited at the bottom of the page so look for your name. As promised, I didn't delve into a full on description and this is simply a snapshot of two months into Abby's captivity. Funnily enough, this Epilogue was started three different times, but none of them seemed to work out. Which ended up being incredibly frustrating. So then I decided to switch POV's and what I got is...well, I am warning you, it's disturbing. Then again, not as disturbing as the movie. But there's well...I want to warn you, but I fear that it will ruin the ending. So, I am telling you that it is not mandatory to read this Epilogue. Especially if you are easily discomforted by what I ended up writing. It's disgusting and sickening and I really delved into a very creepy activity. Please, keep an open mind and enjoy, despite the grimness of the situation. Epilogue - How Deep is Your Love? Only when the midnight hour passed did Heiter slowly edge open the door. He didn't have to be concerned with a squeak or a groan from the ancient wooden structure. Abby was out deep, something he made sure of just like he had other nights. Entering the room, he wondered whether she was aware he'd added extra sedatives into the food he'd been cooking. Since it had been only a week long occurrence, he guessed it'd be a few more days before she caught on. Perhaps this is one of those times her intelligence works against me. The window projected the glare of the moon through the turbulent, gray clouds blocking its path. The snow helped reflect the illumination as any animals outside lay silent in the dead of night. His eyes slowly traveled from one end of the room to another, starting with the window. At first, he had been furious with the house first built nearly a decade ago. The windows were way too damn high, this room in particular. The builders attempted to claim it'd bring in sunlight faster and was the ideal room for someone who appreciated nature's beauty. Initially, it had been for-. He stopped himself, shaking the whore's name from his mind. Now, however, the room had worked out to his complete satisfaction. Could it have been possible it was always meant to be this way? Used for his future captive? An ironic smile tugged at his lips as he continued his scanning. He'd been unsure at first whether to provide the room with a desk or table. Abby had a frustrating ability to be creative and surely one of those objects would in someway be used against him. So, he refrained. At least until she began accepting her place. The room was sparse without furniture, but at least it had a window. He prized himself on accomplishing that, remembering it was one of the primary things Abby had complained about at his villa. It took three more silent minutes before his eyes fully adjusted to the dimness suffocating the room. By now, she will hardly recognize the light. Still, he hesitated before flicking on the switch. If she had even the slightest idea he'd been drugging, then entering her room at night, she'd react unfavorably. And considering what her reaction to him \"kidnapping\" her was so far, it might literally drive him insane. Moderation. I cannot do this every single night. But this didn't settle well in his head. Ever since her \"captivity\" over two months ago, she had remained irrationally cold toward him. He was expecting anger. He was expecting rage. He was expecting a constant battle over every single thing he commanded of her. Instead, she ignored him. That, he quickly determined, was far worse than any form of stubbornness she could have emitted. And he was quite sure she was aware of that. But not even the hostility could mar the three attempts she'd made at escape. Which brought him to one of his favorite features to observe. Wrapped tightly around the base of her ankle was a monitor. He'd often heard of its use in house arrest cases, and the piece of technology worked perfectly to keep Abby from fleeing. Not only did it blast a sharp, high pitched wail each time she left the house, it also sent electric current flowing through her leg, making it near impossible for her to properly walk, much less run. Of course this hadn't prevented her from crawling. Eventually, the electricity got to be too much and the first two times, she simply passed out on the lawn. Nothing he was too concerned about. He hadn't been lying when he mentioned they'd be settling down somewhere vacant. The nearest neighbor was over a three hour drive away. And his home by the sea did not straddle a main road. In fact, there were such a grand tangle of roads on their way that Heiter had nearly forgotten altogether how to get to their destination. The third time she attempted an escape, he realized just how desperate she was. And crafty. She'd taken a shower before her last attempt, and he didn't think much of it even as he'd heard the wail break out, indicating her venture outside. However, when he observed the smoke spewing from her bent form on the lawn minutes later, he was sure he'd seen white. On purpose, Abby had remained wet in hopes of the current electrocuting her to death. After she'd regained consciousness, he threatened to rinse her with a towel himself until she was dry from head to toe, every single day. The horror on her face had been gratifying and disappointing at the same time. But it taught her a lesson. His eyes darkened in the bright room, staring at the monitor encompassing her pale, smooth leg. For such a naturally brunette individual, the hairs on her limbs were a near bleached blonde. This made it incredibly convenient to deny her a razor. Slowly, his brown eyes traveled from leg to hip. Abby normally slept on her side with the sheets bunched up in random areas of her body. Heiter had found this oddly amusing upon first glimpse. It seemed like a different portion of her body was cold each night and she couldn't quite figure out which part to cover. A few minutes passed by, but the surgeon was only content with staring. Despite his invasion of privacy, Abby was different than other people he'd met. He naturally cared about her, and even a task as simple as observation (or maybe voyeurism was more appropriate), seemed like a breach in trust. But her constant evasive behavior had finally worn him down. It wasn't like he expected they'd regress back to the relationship they had before. Still, two months of silence at the dinner table, the den, her bedroom, and anywhere else he attempted to converse with her, snapped the last of his patience. In his mind, he classified it as such - if she wouldn't give him her attention whilst conscious, he'd attain it while she was asleep. And for the past week, his routine had been working quite nicely. I do not have to see the hate in her eyes. Or the disgust. With this thought in mind, Heiter gravitated toward the sleeping woman and gently lowered himself on the edge of the bed. Normally, he'd begin speaking to her in German at this point as he had done in the week past. Her petrified state of sleep allowed him to mention things he didn't think he had ever made public before. This time, however, one of his hands shot out. It hesitated for a moment, unsure of the response it'd get were she awake. That's the point. She is asleep and I may do to her what I wish. When his cool palm finally met her forehead, he released a sigh. One that spilled out from a place deeper than just relief. Beautiful. Simply beautiful. His fingers extended and soon, he found his hand wandering down to cup her chin. With fingers splayed possessively over her jaw, Heiter took a rare opportunity to simply enjoy something he hadn't been able to do for awhile now. In fact, the last time he had been able to place a hand on her was during her drug transition phase in which watching her dream became absolutely engrossing. She'd struggle with a blanket, kicked at her sheets, even cursed underneath her breath, all while slumbering in a nightmare. Those rare moments were when he indulged himself with a pat or a prod on to her skin. Of course then, the touches meant little compared to what they meant now. A light sigh passed from her, into the atmosphere, but Heiter fought back his anxiety. Instead, the noise soothed his ears and allowed him the confidence to lower himself gently beside her. In minutes, he too was laying on his side, facing her. One hand still rested on a pale cheek, while the other strived to place itself in the next available spot. \"So very beautiful, meine liebe,\" he whispered, eyes taking in each angle of Abby's skin. When his confidence - mistaken for, quite honestly, his lust - began to grow, cupping her cheek simply was not enough. He brought his hand to the front of her nose, making sure her breaths were still even. She will be gone until morning. He tried to quench the thrill that shot up his spine and spread through his body like a wildfire, but the feeling was far too strong. Quietly, he lifted a hand and slid it over her hip until his fingers pressed into the flesh of her back. His breaths were quick, and he was thankful he'd kept his attire simple. White shirt, black pants. He waited another minute, making sure his hands would properly work for the next set of instructions. Inch by inch, he began a motion of sliding their bodies together. His body moved in calculative squirms, closer and closer. Hers were simply dictated by his arm. With a delicacy he only reserved for her, Heiter pulled at Abby's dormant body until it rested only a centimeter away from his own. When they were finally close enough to his liking, the surgeon wordlessly marveled at his body's reaction to the blonde woman. A titanic clench in his stomach, excited tingles rushing through him, even his damned pants were starting to become uncomfortable. These reactions were hardly typical reactions he'd felt in his life, even when he was still with the whore . And that offered him a forbidden pleasure he had not yet indulged in. The inaudible silence of the room spurred the man to make a decision. Abby's scent, completely immersed within his own hygiene products since he'd refused to give her anything other than his own, crawled into his nostrils and assaulted his senses. It knew what he wanted, what he hadn't made clear to Abby while she was awake. And it begged him to take it. The opportunity is here. She would never know. When he exhaled, tiny blonde hairs scattered from the crown of her head. Carefully, Heiter extended his head until his lips pressed into her forehead. Simultaneously, he inhaled and the powerful urge shot up tenfold. Where once his hand rested on her back, it now began a crawling descent down to the waste band of her own pajama bottoms. What a shame I will be doing this as she sleeps. But Heiter was a reasonable man. And if there was anything he was sure of, it was that Abby would understand his actions. The woman was incapable of not feeling sympathy for him, just as he was incapable of harming her for fear of losing the presence he so much desired. \"One day, meine liebe, you will see our potential.\" Those were the last words he promised before beginning a relentless chant of her name while his fingers set out to explore every evasive inch of the woman he wanted with an unwavering lust. APHAPHAPHAPH From the second Abby's eyes shot open on a chill, February morning, she recognized something to be...off. For one, she felt warm. Not because of the blankets, but internally as well. As if she'd swallowed a flame and the burning ball had kept her ignited all night. Secondly, there was the lack of tension in her shoulders. Every single night, Abby fell back into the bed as if each muscle was stringed as tightly as a bow. Now, however, the muscles seemed to have all but disintegrated whatever anxiety kept them so straight. The last peculiar incident wasn't something she noticed until she got to her feet. Did I pee in my pajamas or something? She entered the bathroom shortly after, intent on changing into new clothes after a tumble underneath the shower head. When she lowered her panties off her legs and took the time to observe the fabric in the middle, a white substance greeted her horrified gaze. Oh my God? Did he-? A sensible side of her tried to reason otherwise. I've been out like a rock for the past week. How is that possible when most nights I went sleepless? And waking up feeling so relaxed-. One trembling hand shot to her mouth as a choked sob spilled out. She nearly had a heart attack when the entire house exploded with sound. Most likely, it was the CD system in the den Heiter used to play his Viennese classical music. Nevertheless, it didn't cease to calm her sudden panic. Her eyes dropped back down to her panties as 'How Deep is Your Love' drifted underneath each door, barging into every room of the house. By now, every fiber in her body hated the song. He played it constantly, as if it would change her mind about what he was doing to her. What he's done. Growing wider, Abby's eyes fluttered shut as she stumbled back into the shower, preoccupied with the white stain. Is it his...or mine? Yep, I'm leaving it right there. THE END! And yes, if you need some clarity, Heiter did touch her while she was sleeping. Intimately. Abby's question in the end is your own interpretation. Would he be just content with a touch, or would he want more? Did he rape her or just molest? Either option is really a fucking creepy thought. And by the end, Heiter really believes her sympathy is expansive enough to over look the fact that he did touch her while she slept. Something he did because he was frustrated at the isolation she held toward him as opposed to the confrontation and banter which made him like her in the first place. So I hope that was kind of messed up for some of you and didn't disappoint too much. Meine liebe is a German phrase you'll just have to look up if you don't know it. I feel like the prospect of Heiter calling her that is something you'll squeal about on your own time with Google Translate. I do have something for you all as well. It's like a credit list. So find your name and you will begin to understand how important your reviews have been to me. Angel1932 - First and foremost, you are the reason this story was written. I was completely inspired by your fantastic portrayal of life post-centipede for Lindsey in Infection. It was a petastool and if I hadn't read it, I would never have began this. You were the first review, the first story alert, the first everything! Thank you so so so so so so so much. Not only that, but your reviews were heart warming to read. You explained in great deal, the things you loved and I tried writing the next chapter based off that review. You never gave up on me and got through with me from Ch 1 to the Epilogue. Thank you, again and I only would hope to have a reviewer again as thoughtful and incredible as you. I really can't wait where you continue to go with Infection and if you ever get stuck, just steer back to the brilliance in which you first began it. Much Love, - SM. the-dark-poetess-911 - I can't even begin to describe how ultimately important your reviews were. Second person to add this on story alert, you and Angel1932 were my only reviewers for awhile. You did this thing that I've never had any reviewers do before. You went into depth and you made me feel like I was the best damned writer on the face of this planet. Your constant support for whatever direction I took the story made me believe I could write anything. Honestly, your reviews made my entire fucking day. Beautiful, uplifting, and if I close my eyes and think for a second, might even be true - for a second, of course. Don't ever stop reading because some other author will gain just as much joy and inspiration as I have with the feedback you give. Thank you so very, very much. I literally came to reread your reviews for a second spark of inspiration and your words were some of the kindest I've ever gotten. In fact, you are undoubtedly one of my favorite reviewers of all time and are worth a definite mentioning in my future Oscar speech. Much Love, - SM. StrangeKindOfMirror - You sort of crept in with your reviews later on, but you stuck with contributing your thoughts and I gained incredible confidence with whatever I was writing as a result. You voiced your support effortlessly and even though I felt like I had committed a million mistakes, you only saw the good and pointed it out. Your reviews were an absolute pleasure to read and I'm so glad you enjoyed the ride. Author's live for reviewers like you and I can't imagine where this story would be if you hadn't offered up insight about the story. You have incredibly intelligent things to say and I feel priveleged to have some one so well spoken and intellectual review my story. Thank you so very, very much and I hope the ending satisfied some part of you. Much Love, - SM. Explodingsushi15 - To me, you seem like a very hyper individual. Your reviews always seemed like they couldn't wait to be written and for that, I am thankful. They were a pleasure to read because you accepted the plot and appreciated things in it that I didn't even think twice about. Your constant excitement for the next chapter made me want to not only upload a chapter quicker, but write it in a manner that you'd greatly enjoy. I also loved how into the story you got and hearing my plot being talked about in a review is something so mindblowing and heart warming that I can only offer up a bazillion thank yous. Thank you so, so, so very much. And the fact that you feel like I've taught you writing ideas and styles (I'm only a Junior in High School), is something I can't properly wrap my head around. Thank you for inspiring me, thus being the inspiration for yourself all along. Much Love, - SM. YinYangSisters - Okay, you've actually reviewed on multiple stories of mine - DW stories are the ones that come to mind. I never got to thank you for those reviews properly because of the kind words you said. You claimed I was one of best authors you've ever read from and my brain literally died. Hearing that, especially when I detested my writing so much at one point, brought up my confidence up to a level I never had it at before. THANK YOU SO MUCH! The fact that you continue to follow my stories which transcend genres and ideas, is really quite fantastic. I feel like I have a real fan each time you review. They help in a manner you wouldn't believe and to have a fan who enjoys the good and the bad I write, makes me want to kidnap you just so I can plop you beside me and listen to your thoughts. Can't ever thank you enough for everything you've done to contribute inspiration and determination. Thank you, thank you, thank you. I hope to continue to see your reviews on other stories, especially if I ever get the motivation to begin another Donna/Master fic. Much Love, - SM. I didn't forget those others who reviewed one or two times, and I want to thank those. But above...you guys are just unbelievable and I want you to know that. This story is here because of all of you. Words can't describe my gratefulness. Just...thank you. That's all I can say.

Particular thanks to Artemis Acorn who let me have a lot of information about the region and some of its denizens, scenery and stories; and for encouraging me to go for it. It's down to her that I actually got around to writing past the first 4 chapters. Yes I know this is in Good Bad and Ugly and is actually a follow on from 'For a few dollars more' but this fandom seems to be used for the Dollar Trilogy films so I haven't bothered to either try to espatblish a new category or ask for it to be changed to Dollar Trilogy. Chapter 1 The black clad man sat alone at the table in the saloon, with a well deserved drink. He was the sort of man that most law abiding people might take at first glance to be a lawyer or a business man; until they looked into his eyes. Those narrow, almost almond shaped eyes were devoid of any emotion but watchfulness; they were eyes that had gazed on death so often that they almost held an echo of the grave in them. The face was bland and gave little away; but the discerning might note that not all the lines about the eyes were from squinting at the bright desert landscape; some were emissaries of humour in a man who had known laughter, as the faint lines by his mouth told a similar story. Some might say that his humour was as dark as the death that looked out of his eyes; others that he had buried it six feet under. But those who had most cause to complain about his humour were themselves beyond complaining in the land of the living. He was a man who, once they had looked into his eyes, the law-abiding avoided as dangerous. He was a bounty hunter. He was aware of the light step behind him and used the mirror behind the bar to ascertain that it was not the barmaid as he had initially guessed but a youth who could be no more than a boy. There was no apparent change to his demeanour; but he was ready. Even for a boy. The man in black had never seen this boy before. But that did not mean that the boy was not trouble. And the boy made his way purposefully, threading through the rickety tables to approach the only currently occupied one, lithely making his way across the room. \"Colonel Mortimer?\" the boy spoke softly. \"Mm'Mm?\" said the man in black. \"May I join you?\" asked the boy. \"It's a free world\" said the Colonel. His tone was not encouraging. He gave his attention to his pipe, filling it carefully; seeming not to even look at the newcomer. Seeming. The piercing eyes missed nothing though they seemed to concentrate only on the pipe as though that was the only thing in the world he cared about. It did not seem to deter the youth – he did not even shave yet thought Mortimer – who sat down opposite. \"I was looking for you\" said the boy \"You ARE Colonel Mortimer aren't you? You didn't exactly confirm it.\" Mortimer looked up from his pipe and regarded the boy. \"I am\" he said. \"I believe you have the advantage of me.\" The youth flushed. \"Robert\" he said. \"Robert …Lee\" \"Well if you claim a middle initial of 'E' I can't say I'd be sure I'd believe that\" said the man in black. \"I was named for General Lee; plenty of people were\" said the boy \"Most people call me Bobby.\" Mortimer grunted. \"It's a little boy's name. You ARE a little boy. What's a little boy doing in a bar talking to a bounty hunter?\" he laid down the pipe and took a pull on the liquor in his glass. Bobby grinned shyly. \"I wanted to ask if you'd take me as your apprentice\" he said. Mortimer almost choked on his drink. \"Boy, you are insane\" he said \"It's not the sort of thing a young kid like you does by choice. Go back home to your mammy and pappy.\" \"I've nowhere to go\" said Bobby \"And I figured that in this world, one is either predator; or prey. I don't want to be prey. A predator has to be either against the law; or working for it. And a criminal is a slave to his need to stay out of gaol; and a lawman is a slave to Uncle Sam. The bounty hunter has the precarious freedom to starve or eat well in his own sweet way.\" Mortimer regarded the youth through his narrow almond shaped eyes. \"Well you've not got too many illusions\" he said \"You're a sickly looking brat.\" Bobby shrugged. \"I come from out east. Easiest way to travel without too many questions asked was to claim to be taking something akin to the Prairie Cure. A consumptive gets left alone. So I have been careful not to let my skin darken yet. I dare say it will and if I have someone to work for I shall be eating more regularly and lose the skinny look.\" Mortimer regarded the boy malevolently. He disliked being made to feel driven into a corner. He would maybe give the kid a square meal and tell him to get lost…. He regarded the thin, nervous hands playing with the empty glass the youth had picked up. Their fingers were long and delicate. He grunted. \"Well maybe we'll give it a trial; you fetch and carry for me and saddle up the horses – do you have a horse? Do you now how to care for them?\" The boy flushed. It showed more on so pale a skin. \"Of course Colonel, sir. We've always had horses…. Before I had to leave you understand\" he added. \"I came with my mare.\" The colonel nodded. \"Very well; I'll check her over in the morning. I'm in no hurry to leave so we can take our time. I was about to order supper; I take it you'd like to eat? I'll pay you with board and you sleep wherever I sleep and when I take a man in I'll pay you a proportion according to how well you earned it. Suit you?\" \"Yes sir; suits me just fine\" said the boy. oOoOo Mortimer watched Bobby eating. The lad ate with the concentration of hungry youth but with a delicacy that spoke of a gentle upbringing. Well, the boy bore watching. And that was why he had taken this strange youngster under his wing; because there was a story there. This place was no place for a child who knew nothing of the world; the evenings brought rough customers and a kid like this might easily accidentally cause offence and find himself shipped back east in a wooden box. Mortimer sighed. Sometimes having a conscience was a serious problem. Well, first of all there was much to find out; and then he might make decisions.[Chapter 2] Chapter 2 \"I had hot water sent up ahead of us\" said Colonel Mortimer \"I need a bath. You can bath right after I've finished; I shan't take long the water will still be hot.\" He was undoing his string tie and shrugged out of his jacket; then proceeded to start to take the rest of his clothes off and hang them neatly on the chair that lay by the hip bath in the small room he had hired at the saloon. He got as far as his red flannel underwear and turned to grin cynically at the youth who was looking slightly horrified. \"All right little miss; now that I've got your attention would you care to tell me the real story?\" She gasped. Her shoulders spoke of resigned acceptance that he had the truth; good, thought Mortimer, she is not going to make me force her to admit it. \"Do I have to?\" she asked \"It's not especially interesting; and what I said was true as far as it went. Only the name is Roberta and the surname seemed to fit.\" \"So I surmised\" said Mortimer dryly. \"Here, help me with the blanket; I'll pin it to the beam with a couple of knives as a screen. I really DO need a bath and you can carry on talking while I take it.\" Roberta held the blanket meekly while he drove a pair of throwing knives through it into the ceiling beam. It was not perfect but it would do. She heard the sound of further undressing and a quiet splash or two. \"I don't think there's a lot to tell\" she said. \"Oh I think there's plenty to tell\" said Mortimer. \"Now you've acknowledged the corn. Why were you seeking ME out for instance? Not surely on my reputation? Because I don't usually work under my name you know. Most people only know me as the Man in Black. Colonel Douglas Mortimer is a name that is dead and almost buried.\" There were a flurry of splashes and she could imagine that he had emerged. She could hear him towelling himself vigorously. \"I – I think we might have an enemy in common\" she said. \"Go on\" \"Gamaliel Gellibrand\" she said. The curtain was jerked back in sudden disbelief as he stared at her. He had got as far as the lower half of his red flannel underwear and she blushed. \"Don't make inflammatory remarks like that if you don't expect me to react\" he said. It was almost a snarl. \"Why should Gamaliel Gellibrand be an enemy of a young girl?\" \"Because my parents want me to marry him\" said Roberta calmly. Mortimer stared. \"How old are you?\" he demanded. \"Almost nineteen. I got back from finishing school and he desired me; and the next thing that I knew of the matter was that he arranged with my father to wed me. My father is a great friend of his; they came from the north together. He married my mother – you probably know her. Her maiden name was Lilian Redcastle.\" \"I recall young Miss Redcastle\" said Mortimer. \"Her fiancé died at Gettysburg. She swore she would never marry.\" \"I doubt she had much choice\" said Roberta. \"Her father shot himself – or so I've been told – and my father wanted the property.\" \"He doesn't seem to have brought you up to be a good little carpet-bagger\" said Mortimer. \"My father has had very little to do with my upbringing\" said Roberta \"I heard most of the history from my maid. Also about you, the greatest shot in the Carolinas. And how you were ousted from your family home by Gamaliel Gellibrand. I find him repulsive; so I considered that his enemy had to have the advantage of being a lot better. Besides, though they don't dare speak out, the older negroes who remember you are very loyal, Amaryllis says. She's my maid. Seems slavery is relative and freedom in name isn't always freedom in fact. Mr Gellibrand is a cruel man.\" Breath hissed through Mortimer's gritted teeth. \"I never returned… I thought – I KNEW – it would stir up trouble\" he said. \"So. I can quite understand you fleeing such a man – he's ten years older than I am and when I last saw him he was as fat as a hog.\" \"That's because lawyers are the most successful of criminals\" said Roberta. \"He's awful; and it's his calculating eyes and the way he looks at me that is worst. He brought a necklace as a betrothal gift and he was pawing at it as he displayed it to me and I could see he wanted to paw at me too; he tried to put it on me. Papa excused me for dodging out of the way by saying that I was overcome and turned shy.\" \"And have you told him you don't want this match?\" \"YES!\" cried Roberta \"Over and over; and he tells me not to be ungrateful and that it's a good match and that I'm my wilful mother's wilful brat and he can cure my obstinacy with his belt. So I ran away\" she said \"And here I am.\" He shook his head, bewildered. \"But why seek me out? Don't you have any relatives? Schoolfriends who might put you up?\" \"And where is he going to look first?\" demanded Roberta. \"Relatives I have not. A few schoolfriends yes; and he'd find me and drag me back and all perfectly legally. There are a limit to the number of jobs a woman might take; so I became a boy and decided to head where nobody would think I would go. My mother is broken; she won't defend me. I sent Amaryllis to her auntie so papa cannot question her; I doubt he would recognise her in the street if she's not dressed in her maid's costume. I thought that if you would teach me to take care of myself I could either be a help or move on if you found me an irritation because you're not used to working much with a partner. How did you guess?\" \"You approached me with a woman's step. You have a woman's hands. You flush easily. I knew you were lying about your name. I was fairly certain; so I decided to test you with the old bath trick. And speaking of which you may as well take your turn while the water is still hot; the curtain will do for you as well as for me.\" He had been dressing while she spoke, and finished buckling on the belt with his Buntline specials in their custom holsters. Roberta nodded and went round to the bath as he strode over to sit on the bed. She would hear it creak if he got up; so she made a hasty ablution and emerged clean. oOoOo Mortimer nodded. \"We'll still share a room; it will look suspicious if we don't. You can have the bed and I'll have the floor\" he said. She shrugged. \"It's wide enough\" she said \"We can put our packs down the middle.\" He considered; then nodded. \"Very well\" he said. \"Sleep is valuable to retain the wits. I won't treat you in any way other than I might a boy. Which will be hard for you. But you cannot afford any whispers that you are not what you seem to be. I counted Lilian Redcastle my friend; she was the best friend of my sister. I'll keep an eye out for her daughter.\" \"Thank you Colonel\" said Roberta. His smile was not altogether pleasant. \"You may not be thanking me by the time you start to learn the ropes\" he said \"But I can't afford to drag a weakling around; you need to get fit and strong beyond what a girl normally attains; because my life depends on it. And if my life depends on it, that means, young shaver, so does yours.\" She nodded. \"Yes sir; I accept that and understand\" she said. \"I expect I shall hate you a little bit; but it won't be the same as the way I loath Mr Gellibrand.\"[Chapter 3] Chapter 3 \"You black-clad bastard! I know who you are! You are going to die!\" Colonel Mortimer and Roberta had saddled up ready to leave for….. well, Mortimer knew and Roberta had decided it might be as well not to irritate him too much by being unnecessarily curious. It was perhaps unfortunate that he had paused to make some purchases before they moved on; or they might have been gone before the newcomer had arrived. He was a rangy creature, unkempt and unshaven, with the patina to his skin of a man accustomed to the most perfunctory of ablutions at none too regular intervals. His dark eyes glittered with malice as he came face to face with Mortimer. \"I believe\" said Mortimer mildly, in answer to the wild shout, \"That may not yet be determined by fate.\" The greasy fellow sneered. \"You put me away, you…..\" – Roberta did not even understand the epithet he added to this – \"And now I'm going to kill you. I have my gun out, you tarnal old son of a bitch and you'll be dead as a door nail!\" The man's hand jerked up and there was the sound of a shot. The second shot was almost an echo and a chip flew off the overhanging upper story of the saloon as the foul mouthed stranger toppled backwards slowly. Mortimer holstered his Buntline and gave a quizzical smile to Roberta who had got as far as picking up the bucket by the horse trough and was standing there feeling foolish as she had been preparing to hit the interloper on the head. \"You're too slow\" he said \"It'll need training. You froze in shock for several seconds.\" \"I- I'm sorry sir\" said Roberta, putting the bucket down sheepishly \"And that could have killed you if YOU hadn't been so fast. I didn't even SEE you draw!\" \"He talked too much\" said Mortimer. \"Come on, we're shipping out!\" \"Don't we have to wait and see the sheriff and…. Er, make it clear he was…. That he drew first?\" asked Roberta. Mortimer laughed a mirthless laugh. \"I should think the whole town heard what happened, kid; why do we need to tell anyone? S'far as I know he's got no bounty on him yet, so we won't be richer for waiting on him.\" Roberta shrugged and swung herself into the saddle. Mortimer sighed. Maybe it was just because he knew but she even mounted like a girl. That was a habit he would have to break. oOoOo They followed an arroyo to the rearing rocks of a mesa; and through a narrow gulch and thence a trail that rose up the side of it like a giddily precarious stairway. It opened up to a wider pass as they rose, with a plashing laughing waterfall that issued from the cliff face and gurgled its way to a sink hole where it disappeared in a pool. A dark opening on the side of the cliff made Mortimer grunt in satisfaction. \"Our new quarters until you can pass properly as a lad and have learned some measure of skill with a gun\" he said. \"Nice and private.\" \"Have you stayed here before?\" asked Roberta. \"No; but a man I killed did\" said Mortimer. \"He figured it was impossible to find him; a dry place to stay out of sight, all the water he needed, game available. He forgot one small essential.\" \"What was that?\" asked Roberta. \"Cigar smoke rises\" said Mortimer laconically. \"And I shall be eschewing my pipe save when we're out in the desert training.\" oOoOo Roberta had never been so tired in her life. Colonel Mortimer drove her ruthlessly; not just in her manner of walking and riding, but in riding techniques she never would have guessed existed, and in shooting the Smith and Wesson she had bought to come West with; and in general fitness. A Southern Belle was not expected to be athletic; and though the sheer privation of the journey West had hardened her to some degree, still she was lacking in muscles. Mortimer treated her like a raw recruit to his regiment. Roberta did not resent the harsh regimen of training; though she sometimes went to her bed roll almost weeping with tiredness. She had talked herself into this; she had nobody to blame but herself. And she knew, and reminded herself, that being the property of Gamaliel Gellibrand would be infinitely worse. Here at least she was learning skills and learning to master herself. And the Colonel did it for her protection as well as his. Gellibrand would be likely to cause her pain for his own entertainment. \"So\" said Mortimer, as they ate one evening \"How DID you track me down?\" he was taking a 'dry smoke' chewing on the stem of his unlit pipe. \"Can you believe, the newspapers?\" said Roberta \"There was a story about the capture of a famous bandit, some man called 'Indio' and there was an artist's impression of the two bounty hunters who went against him and his band. Ma exclaimed and declared that one of them was Colonel Douglas Mortimer. The rest? Well, the rest was a matter of finding out the name of the town from which the artist had sent the picture, then travelling there and following rumour. Ma spoke to the editor of the paper that ran the story because she wondered what had become of you; so I had that information when I ran away.\" Mortimer stared into the distance, taking the pipe from his mouth. \"He killed my sister\" he said. \"El Indio. It took many years to track him down. I almost returned east once he was dead but there was nothing there for me…. I thought all the credit had gone to Manco – the man I was working with.\" Roberta shrugged. \"I gather he mentioned that it had been a joint effort\" she said. \"You were well enough known to be depicted recognisably. I copied the picture in the paper to be sure of recognising you. My education may not have included gun fighting but it did include art. Also music, deportment, poetry and flower arranging. Nothing especially useful I'm afraid.\" \"Show me the sketch you made\" he demanded. Roberta got up and extracted it from her pack. It had become crumpled on the journey; but there was enough to it to recognise Mortimer, his narrow eyes less humorous than Roberta knew they usually were; but the shape was there, the neat moustache and the sensitive lips and narrow chin. \"Here; it's not that much like you. I was copying another man's recollection\" she said. He nodded. \"Draw me from your own memory\" he said. Roberta looked startled, but got her sketch block and pencil. He had walked round the corner of the little plateau so he would be out of sight. She did as she was bid. He had made a guess how long she might take and returned as she was adding finishing touches. He examined her sketch. He nodded. She had not made a bad job; there was life in his eyes. They crinkled appreciatively mirroring the look she had drawn into her sketch. \"Well if you can recall faces that you see for less time and make as good a likeness as of the copy from the newspaper it might be handy\" he said. \"For a bounty hunter to ask 'have you seen this man' rather than give a vague description.\" Roberta grinned. \"Well I suppose I did not waste my time totally\" she said. \"Looks like you didn't\" he agreed. \"I do have a lot to learn\" said Roberta \"For instance, there was a word that man used – the one you shot back in town – that I don't know.\" Mortimer got out his pipe and toyed with it. \"And we're going to keep it that way\" he said. \"Won't it look suspicious if I don't know it?\" asked Roberta. \"It'll look more suspicious if you blush because you know what it means\" said Mortimer dryly, cleaning imaginary dottle out of his pipe bowl. \"Or if I blush because I've explained it to you.\" \"Oh!\" said Roberta blankly. He laughed and ruffled her hair. \"A kid the age you look might not have come across it anyways\" he said. \"And if I had a son your age I'd thrash him for using it.\" And with that Roberta had to be content. And she acknowledged that the Colonel was probably right; though what kind of word could make HIM blush for explaining it quite escaped her![Chapter 4] Chapter 4 Colonel Mortimer had been thinking. He watched Roberta wash up after a meal as he pondered; and called her over. \"Come here Bobby; I want to talk something through\" he said. Roberta ran over cheerfully; and he nodded approval that she was running more like a boy now. \"I'd protect any young female from Gamaliel Gellibrand\" he said \"And my sister's friend's daughter even more. I had wondered though if I did you no favours encouraging this masquerade as a boy; whether I should find you some respectable chaperone\" he held up his hand as she opened her mouth to speak. Roberta shut it again to let him finish. \"It occurred to me that in this sort of district, the only RESPECTABLE female I could find who would leave house and home to be a chaperone would be the widow of a man killed grading the railroad\" he said \"Who would either be rather rough and ready herself; or would treat you bad because she would assume a young girl travelling alone was a hussy who was no better than she ought to be\" he took a pull on his pipe. \"I considered – purely for your convenience to travel – marrying you; but a young thing like you wouldn't want that sort of tie even for convenience. So I have to say I can't see any alternative to you continuing to dress as a boy. I'm sorry.\" Roberta gave a squeal of delight. \"Oh Colonel Mortimer, I AM glad! Boys have so much more fun; even though it's hard work this is the best time I've ever had in my life.\" He laughed disbelievingly. \"I've shouted at you, cuffed you, made you work like a slave and this is the best time you've had in your life?\" he said, quirking up one expressive eyebrow. \"Oh yes sir; you can't believe what a sense of freedom it gives feeling that I've achieved something when I manage to earn your praise for doing well\" said Roberta \"And I feel that I have the chance of actually REALLY being a good partner to you and earning my own way. It's very liberating. So is not wearing female accoutrements\" she added with a slight blush. \"Not that I'd OBJECT to being married to you; I mean, though it's no real compliment you are much better looking than Mr Gellibrand and it would mean I would be safe from being married to anyone else, so please don't think I don't appreciate the offer.\" He laughed a short laugh. \"Well anyone is preferable to that man…. And if I had thought it necessary, you need not have worried that it would be anything but a marriage in name only…. Bless the child, you don't even know where babies come from, do you?\" \"Doesn't God send them?\" asked Roberta. Mortimer groaned. \"If you think I'm going to tell you about the birds and the bees you can think again\" he said. \"Oh dear.\" oOoOo In the end Mortimer drew some diagrams and wrote a concise explanation about those things that gave the bare bones of reproduction and gave them to Roberta telling her almost harshly to read them when they could not see each other to spare no end of blushes. \"You'll see men urinate, not knowing there's a woman present\" he said roughly \"So you need to know what er…equipment they have and ….. just go away and read it!\" oOoOo Roberta was not sure if she were shocked or deeply fascinated by the document. She read it carefully and then burned it. That meant nobody could find it in her possessions. She told Mortimer what she had done. He nodded. \"Wise\" he said. \"We cannot guarantee that someone might not rifle through our belongings. It was why I made you get rid of your corsets. Some men wear corsets but they are of a different design; and you, as a slender youth, would not need to do so.\" She nodded. Corsets, which had been the most embarrassing thing she had ever talked about with him suddenly seemed a relatively safe subject. \"I – I appreciate your excellent explanation\" she said in a rather subdued voice \"And now I know what I feared most from Mr Gellibrand even if I didn't know why I was fearing it. It is disgusting enough to have to shake his damp and pudgy hand; it feels like shaking hands with an overripe fungus!\" Mortimer gave a wry grin. \"Oh the only ambitions I have so far as Gellibrand and flesh touching flesh are concerned is the prospect of sinking my fist into his blotchy face\" he said. Roberta brightened. \"Well that's something to look forward to\" she said. \"We really OUGHT to get married so you can defend me from him by doing just that!\" Mortimer laughed. \"Almost tempting\" he said. \"Now, you have exercises to do; we're tackling climbing now you've the muscle to sustain it.\" Roberta had little time to ponder on any embarrassing subjects as Mortimer put her through some gruelling tests and started to teach her the art of climbing, an art that any boy might learn almost by instinct; which instinct was ruthlessly crushed out of a nicely brought up girl as unladylike. The exercise brought them back to the rapport and camaraderie that had been starting to form before Mortimer realised just how many holes a nice southern belle might have in her education; and by the evening Roberta was chatting animatedly as was her wont; and Mortimer drawing on his pipe – he now felt it safe enough to smoke as his protégé could more easily carry off her imposture – listening in tolerant amusement as she regaled him with tales of her schooldays peppered with ironic asides about the use – or rather lack of it – that she had had from her expensive education.[Chapter 5] Chapter 5 The new Amarillo Hotel was painted a bright yellow. \"Garish\" remarked Roberta. \"Well as 'Amarillo' means 'Yellow' and the town is dubbed 'The Yellow Rose of Texas' I presume it's a means to make it memorable\" said Morimer. \"It's that all right\" said Roberta \"But not necessarily in a way that's advantageous. Still it looks clean.\" Mortimer laughed. \"THAT is the talk of a Lady from back East my infant. This is the pride of Texas; cost forty thousand dollars to build, has two stories, forty rooms, bathrooms – communal I'm afraid – and outside toilets. A showplace.\" \"And I wager the vaunted facilities are still earth closets and not taking advantage of Thomas Crapper's excellent refinements on the English systems\" sighed Roberta who was more interested in the comfort of facilities by now than she was embarrassed about discussing them. He laughed. \"You'd win that bet\" he said. \"The town is such a scar on this pretty valley too\" sighed Roberta, glancing back up the valley they were riding down, where cottonwoods and withies nestled along the little stream. The painful newness of so many of the buildings in the town and the haphazard tent city where the railroad grade was being built were indeed almost an affront to the lovely valley. The corralled cattle added to the noise and confusion that abounded; Amarillo was a permanent stopping point for cattle being transported and a trading post too. The shouts of the men, the noise of the horses working the grinding gears of the grading machinery, the lowing of cattle added to the general shouts and bustle of town life seemed quite deafening. \"Well it's a busy enough place to make it likely to pick up news of work\" said Mortimer. \"And railway building often attracts some lawless elements; as do cattle. Plenty of opportunity for us to find wanted men and pick up a job or several.\" Roberta brightened. \"There is that\" she agreed. \"Bless the child, that's why we left our secure, but unprofitable arroyo\" said the Colonel \"You DID say you wanted to learn the business. And I am rather addicted to eating.\" She grinned at him. \"It's one of those things I find I'm addicted to as well\" she said. \"Can we afford a hotel like that?\" \"Oh yes\" said Mortimer \"Apart from the fact that it's an investment to stay somewhere decent I have my extravagances and my pride.\" Once they were installed in a front room of the yellow hotel – and only the quality of the Colonel's clothes persuading the proprietor that he could afford to have such dangerous looking people there - Mortimer sent Roberta out to buy newspapers. \"It'll give us an idea what conversations to listen to in bars\" he said \"And before we do THAT we'll also mosey on down to the sheriff's office to see if there are any wanted posters.\" Roberta suspected that a cosmopolitan man like Mortimer also wanted to catch up on what was going on in the world after having been buried from news training her. She purchased papers without difficulty; and was stopped on her way back by a lean man in a poncho which may once have been green who looked as though he belonged to the desert they had left; for he looked as though he might as well be made of stone. In a face that seemed to have been rough-hewn from granite, two slate-grey eyes gave a flinty stare through narrowed lids, puckered and prematurely lined from squinting into a too-bright landscape. It was inevitable; for the man looked as though the very landscape had spawned him, a rocky outcrop as harsh as the desert itself. \"You're with the Colonel.\" It was a statement not a question. \"You worked with him to catch El Indio\" Roberta could make statements of her own; and she had seen the picture in the news report. \"Tell you about me did he?\" he asked laconically. \"I can make my own deductions\" said Roberta. \"Smart kid, eh? He your pa?\" asked Manco. \"No; I'm his apprentice\" she hesitated \"My ma knew his sister.\" The man paused to light a noisome looking cigar; and nodded. He evidently understood this as an obligation. \"Are we after the same prey?\" he asked. \"Why, did you want in?\" asked Roberta. \"You're a cheeky brat. Who are you after?\" \"Reckon you might want to talk that over with the boss\" said Roberta knowing full well that Mortimer had not yet fixed on a target; but equally certain that saying so would not suit him. \"We're keeping our options open.\" \"Just got into town and not checked out the wanted notices eh? I saw you ride in\" said Manco. \"Well I may as well come up and say hello – for old times sake.\" \"And then you can discuss the train robbery at your leisure\" nodded Roberta who had managed to get a look at a little more than the headlines in the papers. An eyebrow went up. \"My mistake; you aren't fishing for jobs\" said Manco. Roberta grinned. \"Come on up\" she said, darting coltishly into the hotel. She entered the room several steps ahead of the tall bounty hunter who had accosted her; the newspaper held in front of her and a finger pointing at the story. \"Boss, your partner from Tucumcari is here to discuss working together over taking the train robbers\" she said.[Chapter 6] Chapter 6 \"Hello Manco\" said Mortimer \"How's it going? I thought you'd have retired on the proceeds of that last venture.\" Manco shrugged. \"It isn't about the money\" he said. \"The thrill of the chase?\" Mortimer knocked out the dottle of his pipe and carefully refilled it. All his concentration seemed to be focussed on that but Roberta had a shrewd idea that he was also reading the article. Manco ignored the question. \"I thought you and the kid might not have acquired a target yet; until he invited me in on chasing the train robbers\" he said. \"He says you're keeping your options open though.\" \"Hmmm\" said Mortimer through the stem of his pipe as he struck a match on the wall. It could have been a noise of agreement. It could just have been the noise a man makes when getting his pipe going. \"Point is, old man\" said Manco \"D'you reckon you and I – and the kid – can succeed in tracking down Doc Sharp and his gang when a bunch of Indian trackers couldn't find a trail?\" \"Run through the facts for the kid; I haven't had a chance to familiarise him yet\" said Mortimer. Roberta grinned at him from the position she had taken quietly at the side of the room. That was clever of the Colonel to get his own familiarisation! Manco shrugged. \"It goes this way; this gang holds up a train by putting warning detonators on the line; but the only danger it's warning of is them. Masked, they hold up the driver and demand that the Wells Fargo Messenger open up the express car and let them get at the safe or they'll dynamite the car. So there they are with a good big haul and plenty from the mail as well. Well they make the engineer tell them how to drive the locomotive and uncouple it and they drive off towards Albuquerque; and when the loco is discovered, there ain't any tracks around. Seems like they disappeared into thin air. And if even Indians can't find 'em…. Well the reward ain't so great but I kinda have a thing against brigands disappearing into thin air.\" Mortimer took a long pull on his pipe and released three smoke rings one after the other. \"Me too\" he said. \"Feel like riding out then?\" said Manco. \"I confess I'd like to see how a gang of eight managed to leave a railway engine without leaving any signs of their leaving.\" Mortimer took a pull of his pipe and grinned. \"Did you see the locomotive itself?\" he asked. \"No; what was the point?\" said Manco. \"Didn't talk to the engineer that drove it back to one end or the other either?\" said Mortimer. \"No. Why should I have?\" asked Manco looking wary. Mortimer removed his pipe from his mouth and gestured with it. \"Because I'd be prepared to bet that the lever was thrown into reverse when they found the engine\" he said. \"You mean they drove a longer way than people think, got out, put it into reverse and left it to go back until the steam failed for nobody to stoke it?\" asked Roberta. \"That's exactly what I do mean\" said Mortimer \"Unless you're willing to believe they all emulated Daedelus and Icarus and flew away, or maybe had a gas bag and flew by balloon.\" \"Flying by balloon might be feasible\" said Manco \"But I never heard of those other fellows you mentioned.\" \"Ancient Greek legend\" said Roberta \"Daedalus and his son Icarus were prisoners and they made wings out of beeswax and feathers to fly away but Icarus didn't listen to his father's advice and flew too close to the sun and the wax melted and he fell to his death.\" Manco gave her a sideways look. \"Now that's a dodgy story\" he said \"Sun's millions of miles away; I know that much.\" \"Well the people that made up the story didn't\" said Roberta. \"It was an allegory of trusting parental advice I guess. It's only a story but it's an old and well-known one. Must be; my education was pretty poor\" Manco spat the stub of his cigar into the brass spittoon in the corner. It landed with a damp squelch. \"Better than mine son\" he said \"Learned to read; and how to add up the price of bounties. Don't need no more.\" \"The point being\" said Mortimer with a touch of asperity \"As it's highly unlikely that the legendary and impossible actions of Daedalus and Icarus were emulated, and somehow the idea of them lugging the massive weight of a balloon around seems not only highly dubious but unlikely not to have been noticed by the people at the train.\" \"Balloons don't weigh much do they?\" asked Roberta \"Or why would they float?\" \"Never heaved the washing for your ma?\" asked Mortimer. \"Yes\" said Roberta. \"Well a balloon has about twenty times as much fabric in it\" said Mortimer. \"I've seen the abortive attempts the South made at war ballooning as observation platforms. They're unwieldy things until the hot air or hydrogen fill them to make them float and then they're difficult to control. I shouldn't fancy making an impromptu escape with one.\" \"Okay; the point's taken\" said Manco \"We ride up the line and see where we might pick up a trail.\" \"Yup\" said Mortimer. \"And it's too late to start now; be near dark by the time we get going. We set off before dawn to have all day to travel\". Manco nodded. \"They likely to do you breakfast that early here?\" he asked laconically. \"Nope\" said Mortimer. \"The kid will cook the three of us something and I'll leave a note to have it left on account. I paid up front for the room for a week; they have nothing to complain about.\" Manco spat again. The brass rang this time. \"D'ya wanna bet?\" he said. Mortimer laughed. \"Let me then amend the comment to say that they OUGHT to have nothing to complain about\" he said. A/N Based on a real series of train robberies at the time except that the messenger of the first heist with the 'disappearing' robbers had managed to hide the dough. This is fiction and the truth is there to be plagiarised…. Only the names are changed [slightly] to protect the guilty…..[Chapter 7] Chapter 7 Roberta had no difficulty coaxing the hotel stove into life. She let Manco in the back and the three of them ate sausage balls, bacon, eggs and thick slices of bread. Roberta did extra bacon and sausage balls and secured the same between slices of bread with butter and mustard and wrapped the sandwiches in greaseproof paper. She wrote a neat accounting of what they had used and left it on the kitchen table. They also left the washing up. \"Long ride to Tucumcari which will be half way there\" commented Manco. \"Ride all the way to Albuquerque? If you want to go that way you can do it alone\" said Mortimer. \"For my part I was going to ride the train that runs from Fort Worth to Trinidad then get on the main line down to Albuquerque. It's a bit of a roundabout route but quicker and easier to go by Fort Worth and Denver City then Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe than by horseback.\" Manco fell silent. \"That's very clever boss; it would not have occurred to me\" said Roberta \"I was just thinking what a shame it was they were only now grading the railroad that will go on to Albuquerque.\" \"I don't believe in making extra effort for myself\" said the Colonel. \"At least there's that rail road in place; saves going three hundred miles north to Wichita and four hundred miles back. And even that would be an improvement.\" Manco might not have any comment to make; but he rode north with them. \"How long will it take?\" asked Roberta. \"Well now, it's about a hundred and eighty miles to Trinidad\" said Colonel Mortimer \"And about a hundred and twenty miles back south. The average speed with stops is around forty miles an hour. How long do you make it?\" \"four and a half hours plus three\" said Roberta \"But it depends on the frequency of the trains; if we miss a connection it could still mean two days.\" \"And a better rate of travel than going cross country two hundred and fifty miles even if we average twenty five miles a day\" said Mortimer. \"I should say so\" said Roberta. \"Why when the railroad has been built all the way it will eat the miles and it will take no time at all!\" \"We shall leave THAT rate of travel to the likes of Jules Verne I think\" murmured the colonel. \"The passenger train leaves Fort Worth at five oh five. It stops just outside of Amarillo where the station is being built to take on fuel and water, where we shall join it, at around ten o'clock. We shall arrive at Trinidad in the middle of the afternoon and we should have an hour to wait to catch a train to Albuquerque. We shall dismount at the stop before Albuquerque, a place called Lamy since by my reading the robbery took place between Lamy and Las Vegas and the train was found between those stations. Therefore we can ride north from Lamy looking for the place it stopped first before being placed in reverse.\" Manco nodded. \"Got no complaint with that\" he said. \"Why did we get up so infernally early?\" \"In case they send a freight train through earlier and we can negotiate an earlier ride\" said the Colonel imperturbably. oOoOo There was no freight train; but the passenger train was well on time and they embarked, leaving their horses in the truck provided just forward of the caboose. Manco settled down in his seat, put his hat over his face, and promptly went to sleep. Roberta had ridden the train before to come east but she was young enough to find rattling through changing scenery interesting and peered out of the window. Mortimer gave her a tolerant smile before he too settled down to catnap. Even Roberta had lost interest by the time they arrived; though she had found another reason to be pleased that they were not riding, especially in company with Manco. Here on the train the lavatory was a small private place; not like the desert where privacy was harder to find when not wanting to go too far from the camp. They ate their sandwiches on the train and Roberta offered one to an envious looking child travelling with her mother and a fretful baby. \"Sir, I – I do not permit her to take food from strangers\" said the mother. \"I did not know it would take so long.\" Roberta glanced at Mortimer, who shrugged. \"Come and share with us, ma'am\" said Mortimer \"I'm Mortimer; the boy is Bobby. My associate\" he waved a hand at Manco who pulled a funny face at the little girl. Manco disliked people but he liked children fine well. In his book they had not yet learned to be nasty. He would have scowled if it had only been the woman. As it was the little girl giggled uncertainly, informed him that her name was Ada and the baby was William. \"You are very good\" said the woman \"Eva Piper; my husband is on the railroad. I'm joining him with the little ones.\" \"Well, it's a good job the railmen do\" said Bobby. \"Will you be going on to Denver?\" \"We're going right through to Cheyenne where the tracks are being extended; I know there's supposed to be a long enough delay at Pueblo so we can go to a hotel to get food\" said Mrs Piper. \"We get out at Trinidad\" said Bobby \"I'll leap off and sprint to a hotel and see if I can't get something for the little ones. I'm sure that the Colonel can come up with a way of delaying the driver for a minute or two.\" Mortimer sighed. \"Your apprentice is a brat, old man\" said Manco. \"I'll delay the train. Got a few questions to ask the driver anyroad.\" oOoOo Roberta had no difficulty purchasing some food for the young family while Manco asked the driver questions about how long a locomotive might go without being stoked. The little girl waved shyly as the train pulled out. \"Brave woman\" said Roberta \"Braving travel with small ones too. I – I don't know what you thought, sir, but I thought that travelling alone she might receive insult in a hotel…. I might be wrong, but it's rougher out here than she's used to.\" \"Oh you seasoned traveller\" laughed Mortimer. \"And I don't say you're wrong at that. I talked to the guard while you were buying food and put Mrs Piper into his care. She'll reach Cheyenne safely.\" The three did eat in the hotel which was raucous and rowdy, and Roberta thought that if the hotel in Pueblo was anything like it, Mrs Piper would dislike it intensely; it would be a couple of hours before the train they wanted came in. And as Mortimer said, a good meal of sandwiches did not necessarily go far when they had a busy time ahead and a wise soldier or bounty hunter never turned down the chance to fulfil any bodily comforts. The connection was caught without trouble; and as they led their horses away from the train Manco laconically explained the intelligence he had gained from the engineer he had spoken to. \"Excellently done\" said Mortimer. \"Another pre-dawn start; same tactic with the hotel but you must reckon up how much we eat and take, Bobby, and we shall leave money. We may not be back this way in a hurry.\" \"If we leave as much mess as we did in Amarillo that might be a good plan anyway\" said Manco dryly.[Chapter 8] Chapter 8 Lamy was a tiny settlement that had not yet seemed to have realised that with its railroad spur to Santa Fe it was a major rail junction. There was talk of building a hotel but talk was all there seemed to be. Manco spat out the butt of his cigar. \"Boondocks\" he said. \"There's a saloon; it will have to do\" said Mortimer. The buildings were few and far between and were either hastily erected board shacks or showed Spanish influence. The saloon was at least a fairly familiar sight and one could probably rely on a room there. Though getting two rooms was not going to be easy. Mortimer shrugged. They must shift as best they could; and he would shield Roberta as best as he might. Indeed they must share a room between them. \"Well the bed will be too cramped; I'll have the floor\" said Roberta firmly. That way she would not be too close to either of them; and could use the po more surreptitiously if she needed to; and would be able to hide her face more easily when they did. At least they were only likely to be stripping to their flannel underwear; and she need go no further. It was sufficiently all enveloping that with a bit of help from the Colonel and keeping her back turned she should manage. It was a good job he had made her burn her corset. Quite apart from the comfort. The binding she had devised that she wore on her chest helped to hide things as well as keeping THAT more comfortable. It was only for one night. In camp they would sleep in their clothes. oOoOo By slipping away earlier than the men rose, Roberta managed a quick wash in the stables with a bucket of water drawn from the pump after feeding and watering their mounts; then she started cooking. \"What do you think you're doing you miserable little thief?\" the saloon keeper's wife, a big brawny woman, advanced on her. \"Beware who you call thief woman\" said Roberta \"On the table is my precise accounting for what I'm using. I suggest you keep your vulgar tongue behind your vulgar teeth.\" The woman raised a hand to strike Roberta; only to have it seized in a grip of iron and borne forcibly down. \"Touch the boy and I'll see you pay\" said Mortimer. \"As he says we are making a precise accounting; not expecting to see you up when we left. Indeed\" he eyed her voluminous nightgown \"I'd say you weren't up yet.\" \"I came to see who was in the kitchen\" she hissed venomously \"And how were you planning on paying if you were gone before I was up?\" \"Dollars generally do well\" said Mortimer coldly. \"Ah, you brighten; I think I will send you to rouse your husband. I shouldn't like to pay YOU and then find that HE cries thief on us because it stuck to your fingers.\" \"How dare you say I would steal?\" she cried. Mortimer gave her an unpleasantly reptilian smile. \"With more justification I am sure than you miscall the boy\" he said. \"Go get him up.\" \"I'm not leaving\" said the woman \"I want to see exactly what you're eating not rely on the scarcely literate scrawl of some guttersnipe.\" Mortimer picked up Roberta's beautiful copper-plate account. \"My!\" he said \"Your Majesty is obviously so far above an educated young man that you consider the product of education to be scarcely literate; I am so sorry we did not recognise your royal presence here.\" The woman could see the accounting now; and flushed. \"She's mighty good at jumping to conclusions\" said Roberta. \" I'll go rouse the beerslinger\" said Manco. \"He won't like it\" he added, giving the woman a nasty look. \" Into each life some rain must fall\" said Mortimer grinning impishly. Roberta proceeded to dish up breakfast and had finished when Manco returned with a sleepy landlord in his underwear. Manco had evidently explained that the man's wife had given them no reason to repose any trust in her, for he glared at her. Roberta passed him the accounting; and Mortimer counted out gold dollars. Roberta then wrapped up sandwiches. \"Ain't ya going to clear up?\" demanded the woman. \"If you can read\" said Roberta sweetly \"You'll see I added a service charge; which covers the clearing up. Cheerio; we shan't be coming back and we won't recommend you.\" oOoOo It had been raining; and a rainbow stretched its glorious arch over the distant Rocky Mountains as the sun rose up into the sky. The morning was damp and fresh and the ground more green than brown with the freshly watered shrubs. \"Not so much a pot of gold to be found at the end of it but maybe a pot of stolen bills\" said Roberta gaily. \"Well to all appearances the foot of it must nestle about the place Manco calculated that the train reversed from\" said Mortimer. \"Well I don't believe in omens\" said Manco \"Preparation beats it any time.\" The rainbow of course appeared to recede when they moved towards it but by and by they came close to where Manco had determined might be the place the robbers had dismounted. They descended into a small valley running up into the hills that grew into the Rockies. \"Thought so\" grunted Manco. \"Perfect place. Look up to the grade.\" Only a culvert was needed for this small stream; and scars on the grade showed where several people had scrambled down with more haste than care. Straggly weeds clinging tenaciously to a precarious position had been pulled out by hasty heels and lay wilted and dead. There were hoof tracks in the mud by the stream bed. \"Someone met them with horses\" said Mortimer. \"Yup\" said Manco. \"Tough to follow after all this time\" said Roberta. \"Especially after rain.\" \"Tough but not impossible\" said Mortimer. \"This is one of the things Manco excels at. And I'm better than most.\" \"They're also more likely to be careless\" said Manco. \"Having thought out a way to throw followers off the scent with the loco; yes I see that\" said Roberta \"Shouldn't they have ridden the horses single file down the centre of the stream? Apart from here, they approached like that, came out of the stream and the prints are heavier; that's when they were mounted\" Manco nodded. \"You read it good, kid\" he said. \"And unless it's another bluff rode off in a gaggle. Very foolish\" said Mortimer. \"You think it might be another ruse, Manco?\" Manco considered. He chewed on his cigar and spit the end out. \"Nope\" he said. \"Why not sir?\" asked Roberta. He gave her a jaundiced look. \"If y'must call me anything kid, Manco does as well as any handle\" he said. \"Because crooks can be clever but never that clever.\" \"Why?\" asked Roberta. Manco glared. \"Steady kid; you've already made him use up a fortnight's quota of words\" said Mortimer. \"Think that's funny, huh, old man?\" said Manco. \"Yes\" said Mortimer. Manco snorted. \"If they were real smart\" he said \"They'd do their crookery as lawyers or real estate agents all legal.\" \"That makes a lot of sense\" said Roberta who was beginning to interpret all the things Manco did not say \"They feel dead clever in finding a way to hoodwink authority and assume that nobody's clever enough to figure it out – because they're cleverer than any of the low life types that crooks are forced to associate with, so they figure they're cleverer than anyone and so fail to take reasonable precaustion.\" \"What I said\" said Manco.[Chapter 9] Chapter 9 After putting the railroad well behind them the tracks turned south. Broken vegetation showed up more clearly against the green verdant growth that followed the rain; careless hoofprints might be found in softer soil; a silvery smear of iron on a stone. \"Mexico?\" asked Roberta. \"El Paso\" said Mortimer \"It's a big place – ten thousand or so, many of them pretty lawless. They don't call it the Six Shooter Capital for nothing. Gambling, prostitution, hired guns; you name it.\" \"We going to follow them all the way?\" said Manco. \"No guarantee they didn't ride south of Albuquerque and board a train like regular people\" said Mortimer. \"We got the sketches from the newspapers. We may as well ride the train all the way. It's several days hard ride, let alone at tracking speed.\" Manco grunted agreement. \"I suppose I expected them to hide out in a secret cave in the desert away from people\" said Roberta \"But amongst all those people I suppose they would be pretty anonymous!\" \"It's what they'll count on\" said Mortimer \"Besides, it's a good place to lollygag about and spend their ill gotten gains. Most people are lazy; show them a wanted poster and if they saw the man on it half an hour later, chances are they wouldn't recognise him; because they couldn't be bothered to recall the face; or because they didn't want to recognise him because it means too much trouble. That's why there's work for us; because if every joe on the street used his eyes we'd be out of a job.\" oOoOo It was another train ride away. \"I feel like Yankee Doodle\" said Roberta when they got off and walked into the hubbub that was El Paso. \"Unable to see the town, there are too many houses?\" said Mortimer with the ghost of a smile. \"You've passed through places as large.\" \"Passed through. That's different\" said Roberta \"Not had to search for a needle in a haystack or a bandit in a boarding house. And I think the heat makes it seem bigger, and louder.\" \"That's a point\" said Mortimer. \"Let's get us some rooms first; then we can think better\" said Manco. \"At least there should be a little more choice here than in Lamy\" said Roberta dryly. \"And I had a thought, boss; if those men have changed their appearance might it not be worth while to spend a little time sketching them with beards or without them?\" \"A good point\" said Mortimer. \"The kid can draw\" he said to Manco, who had raised an eyebrow. \"There's a joke waiting to be made about being quick on the draw\" murmured Roberta \"But somehow I fancy I should pass on quickly and not make it.\" \"Wise decision\" said Manco. Mortimer's brown eyes crinkled in a half smile to her. Manco raised an eyebrow at Mortimer's decision to stay at an expensive hotel; and took himself off to find a cheaper boarding house. \"More leads\" he said. \"Louder nights\" shrugged Mortimer. Roberta certainly appreciated being in a hotel that was likely to be quieter and less rowdy than the sort Manco considered good for leads; the time for frequenting rowdy spots was when actually looking for the bandits. \"Life and work need separation\" she opined to the Colonel. He nodded. \"You and I are used to the finer things in life, Bobby; I certainly have learned to get what rest I can even in low dives, but it's worth being comfortable enough to have all our wits about us for decent rest. And besides, I'd rather not have you in the sort of place where the more importunate prostitutes are going to find it a challenge to get a handsome young man into their beds and won't take no for an answer.\" \"I hadn't considered that\" said Roberta \"Are there a lot here?\" Mortimer gave a wry laugh. \"This is the place most of the vice in the whole of America fetches up sooner or later. Drinking, whoring and gambling are the major occupations here – with the odd gunfight to ring the changes of the entertainment.\" \"I think I'll stick close to you, sir\" said Roberta \"It sounds a bit terrifying.\" \"Oh believe me, some of the harridans are\" said Mortimer. \"Harpies aspiring to be Erinyes I assure you.\" The hotel had a room for gambling but it was quiet and discreet. They were handed a slip with the hotel requests – rules by another name – on it, mostly along the lines of settling any differences outside and not annoying other guests; which had a written note at the bottom to be aware that the border to Mexico was closed and quarantined owing to Yellow Fever. Mortimer grunted. \"Well if they thought to slip over the border if anyone came close to them they're in for a disappointment\" he said. \"Unless they already went over before it was closed\" said Roberta. \"A point\" said Mortimer \"SONNY!\" he called to the youth who had registered them \"How long has the border been closed?\" \"A matter of three weeks sir\" he said. \"Thank you\" said Mortimer. \"Well, they are that much ahead of us; so it's possible. But I think unlikely. I doubt they'd resist submerging themselves into the entertainment to be found here; because the average bandit likes his pleasures quick and easy. It's why he steals to get them.\" Roberta nodded; that made sense. They settled in to their room and Roberta occupied herself copying the artists' impressions of the bandits with more or less facial hair to give them as wide a variation of appearance as she might. \"Assuming\" as she said gloomily \"The original pictures were close at all.\" \"Fortunately one of the rail men recognised a couple of the robbers as having held up a train previously; and their known associates had been depicted before too\" said Mortimer. \"You're doing a good job there; we'll eat and then we'll go call in some of the seventy odd saloons this town possesses.\" \"I think I am just numbed\" said Roberta in resignation \"not so long ago I'd have wondered if there were enough people in the world to drink so much liquor as could be contained in so many saloons!\"[Chapter 10] Chapter 10 The saloons were louder than any Roberta had yet been in with the Colonel; games of cards and dice more prevalent, and there were a plethora of ladies whose virtue was so much more relaxed than the adjective easy could describe adequately that Roberta wondered why they actually bothered to get dressed – or what passed for dressed – between clients. One of the card players seemed to take offence that Roberta refused to join him and his fellows for a game. \"What's wrong with ya kid, go to Sunday School or sump'n?\" he growled. \"You have something against Sunday School?\" said Roberta. \"Yeah, plenty\" said the man with a snarl. \"If you ain't playin' what you doing here?\" \"I'm looking for someone\" said Roberta. \"Well you found me, kid. Play or get out.\" \"I'll make a bet with you\" said Roberta \"But not at YOUR game.\" \"Yeah? Wassat?\" he demanded. Roberta smiled. \"I bet if you don't stop hassling me that pack of cards in your hand is going to have a hole through it\" she said. \"Aw, shucks, what crap is that? Siddown kid!\" said the man advancing on her menacingly. Roberta was not in the same league as Mortimer or Manco; but the target was close and slow moving. And she had the speed of youth and the ability to draw fast that Mortimer had taught her. The detonation of her own Buntline – the Colonel had seen fit to have her equipped similarly to him – was horribly loud indoors; and the man yelped as her bullet nicked the web of his thumb after passing through the pack of cards. \"I don't play cards\" said Roberta returning her gun to its accustomed place across her belly in imitation of the way Mortimer wore his. \"Where'd ya learn to carry your gun like that kid?\" asked another man sharply. \"From my…uncle\" said Roberta \"He taught me to shoot too.\" \"Solly you fool\" said the second speaker \"You're only trying to pick a quarrel with someone trained by the best shot in the Carolinas. You carry on kid and ignore him; he's drunk, that's what it is.\" Roberta nodded and passed on. Having a reputation like Colonel Mortimer's had its uses; though if it got about too far their birds might skip town. \"Having fun?\" asked Mortimer coming over. This was the sort of saloon where a shot drew attention briefly then everyone went about their business if there were no obvious fire fight going on. \"No\" said Roberta \"Was I supposed to?\" \"I guess not\" said Mortimer. \"Colonel, sir!\" the second speaker got up and came over \"You won't remember me; Corporal Ned Hackley. I served with you.\" \"One of the best scavengers we had as I recall\" said Mortimer \"Well Hackley, how's life?\" \"Oh so-so, sir\" said Hackley \"Still mooching, cadging and fixing, information brokering and a little bit of gambling on the side; I bet on the odds, see, it doesn't bring the big wins but it means I win more than I lose.\" Mortimer nodded. \"Judging by your shoes it does you well enough.\" Hackley grinned. \"Well I do pretty well for myself\" he said. \"See, I don't get the buzz outa gambling; it's just a job.\" Mortimer nodded. \"You always were the shrewdest man I had under me\" he said. \"Can I pay you for some information?\" \"Colonel, sir, if you'd give me the honour of drinking with me, any information I can help you with is on the house!\" said Hackley shocked. \"I heard you'd turned to bounty killing; we got someone you're after here?\" Mortimer passed him copies of the pictures. \"Nice piece of work changing them\" Hackley said. \"That's the kid's work\" said Mortimer. \"Talented lad, your nephew\" said Hackley. \"And makes me hesitate less. I seen that one and that one\" he stabbed a finger at two of the pictures \"The rest I wouldn't swear to; they hang out in a gaming dive on the south side of Downtown. Place called Fat Bob's. I do the rounds\" he added \"Gives people time to forget me.\" Mortimer laughed. \"Hackley, that's excellent intelligence; you shouldn't turn down pay for it\" he said. \"Colonel, sir, you got us all out of more than one tight spot\" said Hackley \"If it wasn't for you I shouldn't even BE here; and anything I can do for you and yours I will, yes SIR!\" \"You're a good man, Hackley\" said Mortimer, shaking the man's hand. The pair went in search of Manco having decided to work their way down opposite sides of the street and methodically cover every saloon, street by street. Manco had evidently managed to irritate someone in the last bar he had entered because there were several people groaning and one unconscious, Manco grinning in grim satisfaction and nursing his knuckles while the girls screamed shrilly. \"Having fun?\" Mortimer addressed him in much the same ironic tone with which he had asked the same question as he had previously asked Roberta. \"You could say so\" said Manco. \"He wanted to leave without paying the girl. His friends reckoned they constituted an argument on his behalf. I disagreed\" and he bent to extract the wallet of the unconscious one, extracted some bills and tossed them to one of the prostitutes before putting the wallet back. The other men were coming to enough to ensure that their friend would not be rolled; and Manco, seeing that Mortimer had news followed him out. Mortimer gave a grim smile. \"We were lucky enough to run into an old soldier who knew me back in the old days\" he said \"We've a target to check out in a place called Fat Bob's over to the south of Downtown. And I should think they might be ready to be planning another heist.\" \"I get your drift old man\" said Manco. \"one on the inside, two on the outside?\" \"Only way it can work\" said Mortimer.[Chapter 11] Chapter 11 \"I don't shave\" said Roberta – with perfect truth it has to be said – \"So I could dress as a woman, a respectable woman so it doesn't show how much there isn't to show\" she blushed \"And maybe make like my husband was killed grading the railway and be bitter about them.\" \"Bobby\" said Mortimer affectionately, removing the pipe from his mouth to gesture \"Any woman who went into a dive like that might go in respectable but she wouldn't remain that way. A lone woman without a husband as a protector would be fair game; and the clientele would be game for rape. And a lad dressed as a woman would be likely killed\" he added. He hardly needed to point out that the rape would be going ahead when they found her to be a young and nubile girl under any widow's weeds. \"He's right\" said Manco. \"I was on the inside last time; reckon it might be your turn, old man.\" \"I believe it is\" said Mortimer. \"And the cover story is that I am a clerk late of Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe; drinking confusion to them because I was sacked for a small error when, as pay clerk, I miscounted some figures. In other words I was fiddling the books – which makes me a crook to start off with, so attractive to them. I also have knowledge at my finger tips of how much pay goes out and on which trains. Starting to look like good bait?\" \"Starting to look irresistible\" said Manco, who was lying on the bed in the hotel room Mortimer had hired. \"I could get used to your bed, old man.\" \"I like sybaritic luxury\" said Mortimer. \"Don't get too used to it however; you're going to case the joint for me before I go in to join the gang and let me know anything I need to know. The kid stays outside; watching the back entrance. He's too much of an innocent and that might blow cover.\" Manco nodded; and Roberta looked chagrined. She acknowledged that the colonel was correct however. Mortimer had memorised enough railway timetables that he could sound like an employee of the AT&SF; Railway; and he sat down to work out how many people might work for the railway in the section of rail south of Santa Fe – in which office he was to declare himself to have worked – to give some idea of how much was likely to be carried. It was certainly enough to be tempting for any train robbers. Where the casual labourers on the new grades might be paid in company scrip the regular employees were paid in cash. The payroll for those on just a short section of line was quite staggering; and the idea of knowing exactly which day it would be carried under the guard of a messenger of the Wells Fargo company would be something no robber could pass up. The story that Mortimer concocted sounded plausible enough; that the wages were made up monthly but were paid two weeks in arrears on the fourteenth of the next month. It was the sort of thing big businesses did, to claw in as much interest as they might from the banks before paying out what was owed. It also gave room for firing on the spot and the wages made up to the precise day. Mortimer also made up a tale of how he had managed to supposedly defraud the company by making his 'mistakes' on the cents column, that nobody checked as carefully, failing to carry forward all the full dollars made by the addition. A small but significant addition to a humble clerk's income. Adding to that a supposed fatal attraction to gambling that would make him ripe to look for a quick return would – he hoped – soon make the gang want to know him better. oOoOo Armed with such intelligence as Manco had obtained of the layout of Fat Bob's and the confirmation that all the birds of a feather had indeed flocked together there, Colonel Douglas Mortimer, dressed in a now slightly old fashioned but eminently respectable charcoal grey sack suit that had seen better days and a low derby rather than his usual grandee hat. His tie was quiet and respectable, neither the string tie that he wore in a bow nor the wide flamboyant tie he sometimes affected; and his vest was single breasted with an extra row of covered buttons to look as though it had the extra material in it to be double breasted. Somehow, although his normal frock coat was a touch conservative, the new costume made the Colonel look much shabbier even without the cloth being well enough worn to be shiny. And the plain woollen notched collar vest was a far cry from a double breasted shawl collared brocade one that was his usual taste. That the border was closed was to his advantage; that he was supposedly heading south half a step ahead of a company detective who wanted the company money back and was stymied at the border made a good story; seduced into a game of cards which he managed to lose from a position of strength and subsequently drowning his sorrows he played a convincing part. And Manco, quietly winning at another table, watched the gang as at first they ignored the supposed loser, then listen as he poured out his story to the barkeep, then buy him drinks to get him to talk more. Drunk or sober the supposed clerk was not about to give away his knowledge for free; and soon found himself drawn into Doc Sharp's gang with his encyclopaedic knowledge of the railway timetables as his bargaining chip. The bounty on the gang should be payable anywhere; but the closer they could get them to Albuquerque the more likely the bounty was to be recognised. Fortunately the gang recognised the concept that the further north they went the more booty they would get as it would diminish at every stop to pay one or more railway clerks; and certainly they had to go north of Rincon where the line divided and which was, as a busy junction, likely to take a significant amount of the wages itself let alone the wage packs dividing to go along the two lines. Rincon was some hundred miles north of El Paso; and riding the train there tickled the humour of the bandits. They promised Mortimer a horse and some more suitable clothes; and bore him off with them to keep an eye on their acquisition before anyone else got wise to his supposed inside knowledge. oOoOo Mortimer had insisted on paying Ned Hackley to provide him with surveyors' maps of the grading of the railroad; and Manco and Roberta knew exactly where he would be headed with the bandits; where they would set up an ambush. \"How many things can go wrong that we should prepare for?\" Roberta asked Manco as they boarded an early train to be sure to be in position well ahead of schedule; the next day being the fourteenth of the month and chosen for that reason to suit their own timing. Manco shifted his cigar from one corner of his mouth to the other. \"Plenty\" he said. \"The old man might be found out and killed. Or they decide to wait for next month. Or they decide to hit the train sooner than the place he's chosen.\" \"That's why he was going to draw a map; make them choose the only logical place\" said Roberta \"Working on the principle that Doc Sharp is a meticulous man who might even get large scale maps for himself. Of course if they go a stop further and ride back from San Marcial we might well be sunk.\" Manco spat the cigar butt out. \"Train'll go past. If they're still on it the old man will let us know\" he said. Roberta nodded. \"Yes; you're quite right\" she said. \"He'll find a way. Tell me, Manco, does the Elephant Butte look that much like an elephant to you?\" she asked as they passed the landmark. \"Nope\" said Manco. \"But then I never saw an elephant. Did you?\" \"Only in pictures\" said Roberta. oOoOo The canyon of the Rio Grande was harsh and rocky at any distance from the river; there were canyons in plenty that might hide an army of bandits. Mortimer had indicated one that came close to the line of the railroad that would do to conceal the gang whilst providing them with an easy climb to a lookout post to watch for a train. It had a spur to it that would equally well conceal Manco and Roberta who would ambush the ambushers. There was a lot that could go wrong; but Roberta had every faith in Colonel Mortimer's ability to lead the bandits into doing exactly what he wanted them to do. She worried about him however; alone in a bunch of murderous and desperate men, without his accustomed weapon, wearing a colt six shooter awkwardly like a tenderfoot after the manner of a man in a dangerous town who feels he ought to be armed and is more afraid of the weapon than of the men he might have to use it on. He also carried a derringer in the back waistband of his trousers; and a second one taped to his calf under his trouser leg. Each had only two shots; but Roberta knew that for the Colonel that meant four dead men even if he had his six shooter taken from him. It had every chance of success.[Chapter 12] Chapter 12 Roberta lay on a rock overlooking both the railroad and the rest of the valley. She had a lightweight sheet over her that she had scrubbed well in the local mud; it kept the sun off her head and helped her blend into the rocky landscape. The sheet was raised on sticks to permit such little breeze as there was to caress her body. Above the sheet the relentless sun beat down like hammer blows from a ruthlessly cloudless pewter sky; and Roberta was glad of a full canteen of water. There was at least a cold sweet stream in the canyon; they did not have to conserve water. The steam of the train was the first thing that was visible, a ragged trail of broken white against the glaring sky, hard to see with the sun high in the sky right in front of her. She used the colonel's telescope to bring it nearer. Yes, it was the passenger train. What might the Colonel do if he were on it? Well likely he would wait until he was nearer – perhaps if he was watched he would draw the attention of his current confederates to the place and lean out of the window. And he would probably take the opportunity to lose the ugly Derby that did not suit him. Roberta kept her eye on the train; it passed without incident. Well, either he was prevented from making sign or they had got out where they were supposed to. It was a two hour ride at least to reach this canyon; in two hours they would know if the bandits were coming or not. Roberta wriggled out from under her protective sheet, wincing as the sun's heat assaulted her as she was putting her hat back on; and scrambled down into the welcome shade that was minimal but at least deliciously cool. She took the opportunity to empty the canteen over the back of her neck, as the water was now unpleasantly warm, and refill it at the little waterfall of a stream that trickled down the canyon wall, cupping her hand to take a drink at the same time. \"No sign?\" asked Manco. He had heard the train of course and seen its tell-tale plume of smoke. \"Nope\" Roberta decided that she could be as laconic as him. He grinned. \"Take a kip, kid\" he said \"I'll take a heads up from time to time. May as well rest.\" She nodded thanks; and scringed her slender body into the shade with her head on her pack. She was learning to sleep when and where she might; it was a skill a bounty hunter needed. oOoOo She slept for an hour and a half; and woke of her own accord, proud that she was learning to wake after a set time. Manco was looking down at her with a curious look on his face. \"Well you're learning the ropes\" he said \"I was about to wake you. 'F I was you I'd learn not to talk in my sleep.\" \"What – er what did I say?\" said Roberta. He shrugged. \"Enough to make me wonder one of two things about you\" he said. \"Either way ain't my business; but 'f I was you I'd bear it in mind.\" \"You can be infuriating, Manco\" said Roberta. He shrugged. That was his full answer. He WAS infuriating. Roberta splashed her face in the cool stream, took a long drink, and climbed up the rock. She took advantage of being out of Manco's sight to duck behind another rock and relieve herself quickly. One never knew; he might decide to join her. There was the faintest of clouds low on the horizon to the south; the telescope made it clearer. It was no cloud; it was disturbed dust and that could be seen long before horses came into view. She stuck her head over the canyon and whistled. Manco waved that he had heard. The whistle meant that she had seen something. Manco would ready the horses now; and presently she would climb down and join him in the spur to the canyon. Before the approaching horses were close enough for the sounds of her climbing to carry if they slowed right down. She hunkered down under the sheet; it would be half an hour before she would be able to make out much. It was a little cooler now but not much; she must make sure and not let the sleep she had taken overcome her again. It did not; she was too concerned for the safety of Douglas Mortimer. She had an uncomfortable feeling that she had dreamed about him because of her concern. What had she said? Well Manco did not care; he had said as much. Odd sort of man, Manco. And then they were close enough; and she had the telescope up, her vision slightly obscured with the finest and transparent of muslin handkerchiefs over the end; it would stop the glass flashing in the sun it was pointing towards. It was a trick the Colonel had brought out of the war; and it might keep him safe. Roberta scanned each of the horsemen; it was hard to pick out faces under wide brimmed hats; if the Colonel was there evidently they had made him change his hat for a more practical one. He would not have been displeased. She might not be able to see faces; but she would know the tall figure of Colonel Mortimer anywhere from his body language and the way he rode. He had decided not to pretend that he could not ride well; that was an imposture that was too hard to carry off. His story – if asked – was that he had been a supply sergeant in the War Between the States and he had done a lot of riding. It would account for the ability of those used to travel long distances to slouch half sleeping in the saddle; a very distinctive way of riding. It was distinctive to lawmen, bounty hunters, bandits, horse thieves and cowboys; and other ranks in the army who travelled a lot. Well he was there; he seemed to be at large and no prisoner; and he looked unhurt. Roberta scrambled down. The time had come to set their own ambush.[Chapter 13] Chapter 13 The bandits were clever and shrewd – up to a point. They were also very self satisfied, and the trick with the locomotive had left them mightily complaisant with their own abilities to put one over the authorities. Mortimer found very little difficulty in leading them to make exactly the decisions he wanted them to make; and they all duly travelled out by train to San Marcial. They had made him buy secondhand clothing to blend more with their own look; as Doc Sharp said, the wide brimmed hat was more effective against the sun anyway. Mortimer was not displeased to shed the disguise though he made sure to keep pulling nervously at his gun belt. As luck would have it, Doc Sharp purchased a map from Hackley; and before Mortimer had changed his clothes. The fixer did not even show recognition to his former colonel, something Mortimer was grateful for. They had taken the train out, with horses, and proceeded to ride out once they had arrived at San Marcial. Mortimer was alert to see any sign that they were being watched; was there the faintest of sparkles on that high butte that concealed the canyon? He could not be sure. Well, if he who was looking for watchers could not see them, Roberta and Manco were well concealed. Assuming they had got there without mishap. Well if they had not he must go along with the robbery on the morrow and be utterly amazed that the monthly pay chest was NOT travelling in the caboose. Whilst worrying about what had occurred. Time to worry if they did not appear in the canyon. Doc Sharp laughed. \"Nervous, clerk?\" he jeered. \"I – yes a little\" said Mortimer. \"We'll take care of the strong arm stuff – and any killing\" said Doc. \"We know how to kill; we killed that guard who wanted to defend money that wasn't even his, the fool! It's better just to frighten them of course, but you do what you have to do. It's the way it goes.\" \"I- yes, right\" said Mortimer. Doc laughed at this squeamish-appearing man. \"What was so great about you that you got to be a sergeant?\" he demanded. \"Good at stealing\" said Mortimer. \"My officer made me up to sergeant so I shouldn't get trouble; because I could always see he got better rations.\" \"And you spent the war hiding under bushes, sneaking into houses and the only fighting you did was in the blankets with any pretty girl regardless of what side she was on?\" said the Doc, half in amusement and half in contempt. \"I – I never raped any girl\" said Mortimer working on not grinding his teeth. \"No? Oh well, you really are a total worm then\" said the Doc. He never knew quite how close he was to death; and how the man he was taunting lowered his eyes not in shame but to hide the blaze of hatred. This one was not insane as El Indio had been but he was ruthless and cruel just the same. Mortimer would have no trouble bringing him down. There were those robbers who avoided killing; who were even courteous enough in a rough sort of way. And then there were the scum of the earth. oOoOo The bandits and Mortimer rode into the canyon; and the Doc surveyed it. \"Not a bad place to have to wait\" he said \"Even water available. Ideal. Good; let's set up camp\" and with that he swung off his horse, the others following suit. Mortimer did not dismount. \"Okay if you'd like to get your hands up we can do this the easy way\" said Manco. The wanted poster said dead or alive; having them able to walk would make life easier. The Bandits, staring at the direction from which the voice had come, saw only a man and a boy ride out of a side canyon; and predictably went for their guns. \"Make my job harder, why don't you\" murmured Manco, fanning his pistol with deadly efficiency. Roberta joined him in firing, if with less efficiency. Mortimer did his part from behind; and felt no compunction in so doing considering what he had learned of the ways of Doc and his villains. One of the bandits however had managed to get off a lucky shot; and Mortimer picked out the high cry of pain that was in Roberta's voice; and when he had finished shooting glanced at her. She held her hand to her chest and a red blossom of blood grew on her shirt. Mortimer swore. A quick glance told him that there was no immediate threat; and he kicked his heels into the horse to bring him to her side where she swayed in her own saddle. \"You check we made a thorough job, boy; I'll see to the kid\" he said to Manco. Manco raised an eyebrow; spat out his cigar end and nodded. \"Douglas…. Am I going to die? It hurts a very great deal\" gasped Roberta. \"I'll have to cut away your shirt to see\" said Mortimer grimly \"I will not be disrespectful.\" \"Please…. Just fix it\" said Roberta \"And…. if you can't you will tell me?\" \"I will\" he said. \"For what it's worth\" said Roberta as he helped her off her horse and laid her down in the shade \"It's been worth it.\" \"Roberta, if it's in my power I will not let you die\" said the Colonel, deftly cutting her shirt away.[Chapter 14] Chapter 14 Manco hitched a buttock onto a projecting rock while Mortimer probed for the bullet. \"She going to make it?\" he asked. \"You guessed huh, boy?\" said Mortimer. Manco shrugged. \"Figured that had to be the explanation for some things\" he said. \"Don't reckon no-one else'd figure it though.\" \"Looks like the bullet's not gone anywhere too deep\" said Mortimer. \"Why don't you take the bodies to Albuquerque and bring me back some medical supplies? I'd rather not move the kid.\" \"I don't think they want to get up and walk\" said Manco. \"So? Just stop the train\" said Mortimer \"They should be pleased to have dead train robbers not live ones.\" Manco spat. \"Just as you say, old man\" he said. oOoOo \"The bullet went through your breast, Roberta\" said Mortimer as he cleaned and dressed the wound \"Doesn't seem to have hit anything vital; it fetched up against a rib but it hasn't broken up; I got the whole bullet out. It'll be sore and you may have a fever but you should recover totally.\" \"Does it look bad?\" asked Roberta. \"It looks as much of a mess as any bullet wound\" said Mortimer \"Does it look like it's going to be causing you any trouble? No. I'm going to sew it up; I'll have to take the stitches out in a week or so. But it'll be best.\" \"You know what you're doing\" said Roberta. She did not want to die; having an ugly scar must be lived with. Right now she just wanted it to stop hurting so much. The brandy Mortimer poured on it stung enough to make her cry out and pass out; for which he was thankful when it came to sewing the wound. It would hurt her less if she was in a swoon. And when Roberta came to, it was to a dull ache. The colonel's flask was beside her. \"Drink a swig of brandy if the pain gets too much\" he said. \"It won't do you any good; but it will help you not to notice the pain.\" \"Horrid stuff\" said Roberta making a face. \"At least it is if it tastes anything like it smells.\" He laughed. \"I rather like it\" he said. \"Where's Manco?\" asked Roberta curiously. \"He took the train\" said Mortimer. \"Quite a treat to watch; he used the detonators from the bandits to tell the driver to stop; and when they did he told 'em calm as you like that he had freight to load. So when they shouted at him that this wasn't a scheduled freight pick up he whips the blanket off the bodies and mentions that being stopped and held up wouldn't have been scheduled either and wouldn't they rather do it his way than the way the bandits had planned. They capitulated around then. He'll collect on the bounty and share it out. After he's got me some more field dressings and another bottle of brandy.\" \"I – did I dream that he guessed?\" said Roberta. \"He won't talk\" said Mortimer \"What's more he's fought beside you; seen you in action. You accounted for one of them and wounded another. He'll give respect where it's due; he won't treat you any differently.\" \"Good\" said Roberta. \"Well it's just as well I can make my way as a boy; because even if I wanted to, no man is going to want to marry me with an ugly scar.\" \"Roberta, don't talk rubbish\" said Mortimer. \"Any man who loved you would love you for yourself – and would appreciate such a scar as a proof of your bravery.\" \"But men always talk to the bar girls about their perfect globes; doesn't being perfect matter?\" Roberta asked blushing. \"No\" said Mortimer. \"Those girls, poor things, have nothing but their usually rather er extensive assets with which to make their way in the world. And the sort of men who go with them have only limited abilities to appreciate feminine pulchritude and only limited ideas about what constitutes the same. You are…. You are a lot more than them. Now try to get some sleep; I don't want you turning feverish on me!\" Roberta obediently shut her eyes. She thought that the pain might prevent her from sleeping; but the trauma had exhausted her and she drifted off into a doze. Mortimer regarded her tenderly. She was as game as they made them! oOoOo Roberta slept through the night and felt better enough in the morning to be faintly embarrassed that Colonel Mortimer had of necessity been touching her rather intimately; but he chatted cheerfully through breakfast of how to read the landscape, making her repeat lessons he had taught her when they had first gone into the wilderness together and she soon lost her shyness and spoke eagerly of the green smudge that showed up from some distance to indicate the presence of water and that whilst weeds at the edge were green and healthy the water was unlikely to contain anything like lead or antimony or any mineral that could be poisonous; or at least not in dangerous quantities. Manco returned half way through the morning having stopped the train by the expedient of pulling the communication cord. \"Heard it worked for you, old man\" he said. \"Won't they fine you?\" asked Roberta \"It's for emergencies.\" \"So? I told 'em one of my buddies was wounded fighting brigands to save THEM; and I needed medical supplies for my partner. They agreed it was an emergency\" said Manco, not troubling to mention that the sight of his guns had unnerved the engineer and guard sufficiently that they had been happy to take his explanation. \"I'm a lot better\" said Roberta. \"And not fully well\" said Mortimer \"You've a flush that tells me you have a slight fever; and the dressing should be changed daily. I can tell you how to do it if you wish; until I have to take the stitches out.\" Roberta acquired more of a flush than could be accounted for by fever; and swallowed hard and nodded. It would be less embarrassing to do it herself! Even if it might not be unpleasant to have the colonel's competent fingers deftly performing the operation. Manco nodded. \"'F you want to tell me about why you're being a boy that's fine; but you don't flinch. I'm happy with you as a partner eitherwise\" he said. \"Well as you are the Colonel's friend I guess I don't mind you knowing\" said Roberta \"You know about his sister?\" Manco nodded briefly. Roberta outlined her story. Manco spat out his inevitable cigar. \"Seems to me I've heard the name Gamaliel Gellibrand before; it ain't a name you can forget easy\" he said. \"Indeed?\" the Colonel leaned forward. \"Well\" Manco considered \"The story goes this way. I took in a couple of smugglers; and one of the things they were doing was passing off the gold they was paid as gold from a mine owned – according to the crates - by this here Gamalial Gellibrand. It's my guess he was financing the smuggling; but I hadn't an interest in following that up and the schmoes got stupid and tried to escape; so they wound up not able to talk to no lawman. But they tried to interest me in some real gold mine this Gellibrand was hoping to find; some mine out west, supposed to have been the Superstition Mountains over in Arizona. Some fellow called Jacob Walz is supposed to have stolen it from some big Mexican family and killed his partner over it. Well I've never been one to think that shovelling rock was a good idea so I laughed. But if this is the same fellow….\" \"I can't say I put much credence in a gold mine story\" said Mortimer \"But if there's smuggling involved in it, and it can be brought home to Gellibrand – he always was greedy – I could maybe get my home back!\" Manco laughed. \"You wouldn't stay there, old man; you're too fond of the peripatetic life.\" \"Maybe; but it's the principle\" said Mortimer. \"Besides if we can legitimately shoot him he can't marry me\" said Roberta \"Because he'll be dead. And even if we don't shoot him, he'll be in gaol and that would be very nice. And I'd visit him with flowers.\" \"All right you minx, I'll buy\" said Mortimer. \"Poison ivy\" said Roberta. oOoOo They camped in the canyon because Mortimer did not want Roberta subjected to the strain of riding any distance; and the AT&SF; were going to get irritable, he said, if they stopped the train to their own convenience too often. They discussed the perfidy of Gamaliel Gellibrand and decided that if he was looking for a gold mine in the Superstition Mountains they might look for him looking; and moreover the more lawless West would be the best place to be organising border crossings than somewhere relatively well policed as in El Paso. They might take the train from Rincon on the other line from the one that went to El Paso to a town called Benson and then follow, said Manco, whose knowledge of the terrain was as encyclopaedic as Mortimer's knowledge of the trains, the Oro Valley north to Phoenix which was a good base from which to look for both smugglers and gold hunters. \"And once we know what we might find we can plan better\" said Mortimer. \"My thoughts exactly, old man\" said Manco. oOoOo Roberta was nervous about having the stitches removed. Manco took himself to a respectful distance to see to the horses, he said. \"Are you scared, Roberta?\" asked Mortimer. \"Not really\" said Roberta \"I expect it will hurt but not as much as the wound did.\" \"I wondered because I fancied you were trembling\" said Mortimer kindly. \"I – I am afraid that it is too ugly\" said Roberta flushing \"I know that is perhaps foolish when I have been so lucky…..\" moreover the thought of his fingers on her skin made her feel rather pleasant inside; and for some reason that made her body tremble uncontrollably. \"But you are young and lovely and do not want to be marked, hmm?\" he asked. \"Let me get the pain over…..\" Roberta bared her breast and he deftly snipped and pulled away the stitches; and she grit her teeth and bore it. \"Thank you\" she managed as the last one came out. \"You are a brave lass\" said Mortimer softly. \"And the scar is mostly out of sight underneath.\" She flushed. \"But supposing you wanted to touch it; would it feel horrid?\" she said. It was Mortimer's turn to blush. \"Any man who loved you well enough and who you loved well enough for you to permit such liberties would take it as a badge of your bravery and would trace the line of it in lovingly in wonder that you are so full of fortitude\" he said. \"Douglas…..\" she said. He gasped. \"Roberta! Can you mean….\" \"I – I think when it is healed….. I should not be averse to you t-taking liberties\" said Roberta. \"I am an old man next to you, Roberta….. you can do better….\" \"You have cared for me and taught me to survive; what more tender care would any husband give?\" she whispered. He took her hands and looked searchingly down at her. \"Roberta….. believe me, nothing would make me happier than to be your husband. But I will not let you throw yourself away out of gratitude and perhaps a touch of hero-worship\" he said firmly. \"IS it that it's too ugly for you?\" she asked wistfully. \"NO!\" he almost shouted at her. \"No, it is not ugly; any man would be proud to …. Dear God I don't want to think along those lines; Roberta, I don't want you to regret…..\" Roberta wrapped her arms around his neck and pulled his head down to hers; and then they were kissing with an intensity that spoke wordlessly of the fears of her being shot. He raised his head. \"We will speak of this more in Phoenix\" he said \"We cannot let this rule us while we are travelling.\" \"If you wish that, Douglas\" said Roberta \"So long as that is not a way not to speak of it at all.\" \"Have you ever known me to avoid an issue, even a difficult one?\" said Mortimer. She thought of his careful anatomy diagrams and blushed! \"No Douglas; I apologise\" she said. \"If we are to try to stand aside from this glorious thing we had better pack and join Manco hadn't we?\" \"Indeed\" he agreed; and his heart was singing at the way she smiled at him.[Chapter 15] Chapter 15 \"All I know about Benson is that it used to be a one-horse town\" said Manco \"But then someone ate the horse.\" The Colonel took a puff on his pipe and released a careful smoke ring. \"It was built in 1880 when the railroad reached that far to replace the wagon depot; it's there solely to carry ore and refined metals dug out at Tombstone, Fairbank, Contention and Bisbee mines\" he said \"It's a place that makes the cliché 'Rough Dive' into a paradigm; because where there are miners there are liquor stores, brawls and other trouble.\" \"Not very quiet then\" said Roberta. As soon as she had been able to ride they had ridden back to San Marcial to take the train to Rincon and then down to Benson; they were discussing their destination as they awaited a train. Most trains to Benson were freight trains; with only one stop beyond it on the line before Mexico, the border town Nogales, there were not many passengers. Mexicans who had managed to cross the border and were then going north travelled in larger numbers; but not often on the railroad. It cost too much; and many of them were on the verge of destitution. Manco fell into conversation with a Navajo Indian who was travelling with them; such other travellers as there were seemed to treat the man with mistrust so Manco nodded to him to join them and make up the fourth in their double seat. \"I am called Niyol\" the Indian said \"Because like the wind I travel; I act as a scout and I do some trading and carry messages where the less hardy wish to go. You are killers of evil men; I see it in your faces.\" \"Does it show so much?\" asked Mortimer. The Indian smiled a small, grim smile. \"Your eyes look always on death, soldier; and not of death in war. But you have kindness and goodness in those eyes too. So I see that you kill evil men; and I am not afraid to travel with you.\" Other than these initial introductions Niyol said very little; but his presence made others give them a wide berth, which suited all three of the bounty hunters. It was only a few years, after all, since the surrender of Geronimo and the end to the Apache wars; and as the Colonel said cynically if one person in five could tell one tribe from another he'd be surprised. \"The Apache were betrayed, lied to and treaties broken\" said Manco \"I'd fight back under the circumstances.\" The tales of Cochise and his sons and of Geronimo had reached even to the East Coast; Roberta had no need to ask questions about such notorious figures! oOoOo Benson was no big town but it was busy. The San Pedro valley in which it was situated was alive with traffic of all kinds, mostly wagons of ore. The train from Bisbee, on the Arizona and South East Railroad, was lengthy, the freight wagons unloading to be smelted in the smelting works before ingots of metal were loaded on a freight train to take the silver and copper pigs north. The men unloading were foul mouthed and quarrelsome and Mortimer sighed. Roberta was likely to hear a lot more than he would have liked. The men who worked smelting the ore were hardly any less rough. Maybe coming here had been a bad idea; but it was too late for regrets; and too late in the day to set out without reprovisioning. A lot of conversation was about the disaster of a recent flooding of the copper mine at Fairbank; but the stevedores were principally interested in getting into the bars for drink and women. And they must take their pick of the saloons that would doubtless also be full of rough men to stay overnight; the major population here was transient, and at a glance Mortimer could see that many of the buildings were not just saloons but gambling establishments and brothels. They may have eaten the one horse as Manco had said, but it had been replaced by two railroad companies, and the place was a transportation hub. There were a sufficiency of obvious cowboys and men dressed as regular settlers to guess that this place also served a farming community as well as the mining; well at least nobody would remark their passage. Mortimer headed for the most salubrious looking joint he could see – the one with the new paint and no bullet holes immediately obvious – with the other two in his wake. \"Well HELLO, Colonel\" the sultry voice almost made him jump as he walked in the half-door. The voice belonged to a woman with rather brassy golden curls that looked suspiciously as though artifice might have been involved in their hue; and she was painted rather extensively and the paint lay in all the little irregularities and wrinkles of a face long past the dewy smoothness of youth. \"Good G-d!\" he said \"it's…. Susannah, isn't it? I thought you were in Tucson\" \"Well I'm glad our time together was memorable\" purred the woman. She was provocatively dressed; and her assets were, in Roberta's somewhat disapproving eyes and in her mental description, all laid out on the counter on display. \"I thought that the opportunities here were greater; but I must say I didn't expect to see an old acquaintance\" Susannah laid a hand on Mortimer's chest. He firmly removed it. \"We had a good time: once\" he said \"And I paid you well for it. And now I'm planning on getting married and I'm not interested.\" Susannah pouted. \"Say, she ain't here, though, is she?\" she said. \"What has that to do with it?\" said Mortimer \"I'd be discourteous to her to look on another woman and I'd be discourteous to you in thinking only of her if I was with you; and you'd not thank me to wake with another name than yours on my lips, now, would you?\" She pouted more. \"She can't be prettier than me, Colonel\" she said, tossing her golden hair and advancing on him with all artillery trained on him. \"Now, Susannah, I'm not about to upset you by answering that\" said Mortimer. Susannah gave a little shriek. \"You mean she IS? Oh that's TOO bad! I don't believe it!\" Mortimer shrugged. \"Believe what you like Susannah; but there's not going to be anything between you and me.\" She looked at his companions. Manco was frankly grinning with malicious enjoyment; Roberta was frowning. \"Don't look at me, sister\" said Manco \"Ain't never had to pay yet; and you couldn't afford ME'. \"What about the boy? Looks like he needs to be shown how to have a good time\" said Susannah. \"He's in my care; and I ain't about to let him become corrupted\" said Mortimer. \"Besides\" said Roberta \"There isn't a bounty high enough that would get me to take on such a scary proposition.\" Susannah said a short, ugly word. \"Let's try a different place to stay\" suggested Manco. \"Good idea\" said Mortimer \"More off the beaten track.\" Roberta wondered if that comment had been meant to be taken two ways or not. oOoOo \"Well, old man, you're full of surprises\" said Manco. Mortimer shrugged. \"There was a moment when I was lonely; she was there. Poor creature hasn't worn well. I'd not have recognised her but for that voice. She took a liking to me because I suggested she'd do better for herself singing. It was never going to work; glorious voice, can't hold a tune in a sack. Bobby wouldn't have been in double figures last time I saw her.\" \"I guess that makes me feel better\" said Roberta. \"If you cared for her it wouldn't matter that she had got old.\" \"If I cared; no it wouldn't. She's nothing to me though I wish her no ill. I spent a week in her company\" said Mortimer. \"Which was quite long enough to realise that I preferred being lonely. The ruddy woman never stops talking, which would not be so bad if she had anything worth saying. It's why I quarrelled with Manco at first; he talked too much\" his almond shaped eyes twinkled a smile at Manco who gave a grunt of laughter. oOoOo The next saloon they tried seemed quieter; and had no prostitutes attached to it. A few labourers were in the bar, with their dust-covered boots and flannel shirts; mostly this seemed the haunt of sober looking claim holders in dungarees or who had changed into suits of varying stages of decrepitude to come into town; and a half dozen cowboys who had brought, judging by the noise from a corral near the train station, their steers into town to be shipped by rail. They were distinctive, rangy fellows with bright kerchiefs knotted at the back, where they could readily pull them up to cover their faces from the dust; their wide brimmed hats hung by the strings down their backs. They looked on the three new comers with some distrust. \"Howdy stranger\" said one. \"Good afternoon\" said Mortimer. \"I ain't seen you around here before\" persisted the cowboy. \"That could be because I've never been here before\" said Mortimer \"So, who are you and who are these joes?\" asked the cowboy. \"Well, I'm Me Myself; this here's my wife\" Mortimer indicated Manco \"And my horse\" indicating Roberta. The cowboy's eyes narrowed. \"Think you're a wise guy?\" he said. \"No neighbour; I KNOW I'm wise not to be too open with strangers\" said Mortimer \"And all I want is somewhere to bed down tonight then we'll all be passing on through. I don't intend to start anything.\" \"He WILL however finish anything you start\" said Manco \"Along o' our help if need be; but as there's only a half dozen of you, if your buddies joined in; he has you outnumbered and me and the kid will eat nuts and enjoy the show.\" The easy assurance of the three seemed to speak a sufficiency of volumes to make the cowboy back off; but he scowled. Mortimer negotiated two rooms for the night; and called for drinks. It had been a thirsty day. When Niyol walked into the saloon there was an ugly mutter. \"Hey, get outa here, you Apache scum!\" said one of the farmers. \"For what it's worth\" said Mortimer loudly \"He's Navajo; as anyone with two thoughts to rub together that hasn't had his brains baked might tell. And for another thing he's here with me so I'd not push it if I were you.\" \"They were spoiling for a fight anyhow\" said Manco philosophically \"Here Bobby; unless anyone goes for guns, you grab a bottle to hit people with; you ain't up to weight for brawling.\" \"Why are we going to be brawling?\" asked Roberta. \"Because Niyol gave them an excuse to get the farmers in on taking us down\" said Manco. The cowboys had all got up. Mortimer sighed. \"Some people have no discrimination\" he said.[Chapter 16] Chapter 16 \"NO GUNS!\" shouted the barkeep, diving down behind the bar and taking his most expensive bottles with him for safekeeping. The leading cowboy had already launched himself on Mortimer; and found his roundhouse punch blocked by a forearm that seemed to be made of steel. He hardly realised that a short pile driver of a fist was on its way before it connected with his chin; and he went down. Two others were heading for the colonel; and Roberta felled one with a bottle laid hard across the head. \"Thanks kid\" said Mortimer, kicking the feet out from under the other. Manco seemed to have dealt with the other three cowboys on his own; Niyol stood and watched impassively, deigning only to grab the wrist of a farmer coming for him with a knife. The Indian's hand moved faster than a snake striking; and a fist of steel squeezed until the knife was dropped. \"Don't draw steel on a man unless you are prepared for consequences\" said the Navajo. He swung the farmer round and pushed him back onto the general melee where he was promptly knocked down by the flailing elbow of one of his fellows. Mortimer picked up his saddle and bag. \"C'mon Bobby; let's go and see the rooms\" he said \"Niyol, if you're staying you'll share with my partner?\" he nodded at Manco. \"If he'll have me\" said Niyol. \"Depends if you snore\" said Mortimer walking off. \"Boss, aren't we going to stay and help Manco?\" asked Roberta. Mortimer glanced at the brawl, which was rapidly degenerating into unconscious bodies. \"What for? He seems to be entertaining himself well enough without our help\" he said. oOoOo \"I had been going to leave you the room on your own\" said Mortimer to Roberta \"But we couldn't leave Niyol. If I don't miss my guess he's scout to a Federal Marshall; and seeing him safe out of this prejudice-ridden hole seemed like a good idea..\" \"Absolutely!\" agreed Roberta \"Though if we're going to be married we don't really need the packs down the middle of the bed.\" \"We need them more than ever my innocent darling\" said Mortimer \"Because knowing that you were within touching distance without an obstacle and, hem, not necessarily averse would be enough to drive a man to insanity. I'm a man not a saint; and the mind plays tricks on a man when he wants something, to justify having it. Like the idea that I helped heal part of you, and the concept that it gives me a right to it….. and the thought that being symmetrical in such touching makes sense….. and things go downhill from there in a man's head if he lets them.\" \"Well they could go downhill Douglas\" said Roberta \"Unless – unless\" she looked nervous \"Unless you mind that I don't have as MUCH there as Susannah\" Mortimer jerked her into his arms and kissed her hard and ruthlessly. Roberta gave herself up to the enjoyment of it even though his hands were almost painful on her shoulders; the kiss was sweet and filled with longing; and she kissed him back with enthusiasm. \"I don't CARE what that ruddy woman has or has not\" he said in a low, intense voice \"YOU have all I could ever want, Roberta; but I need to give you room to find out if you're mistaken. Which is why I am hurting you by gripping your shoulders too tight to make sure I know where my hands are.\" \"Dear me, are they insubordinate to the Colonel?\" said Roberta, wrapping her own arms around his waist. \"Intolerably\" said Mortimer. \"Almost as much as you. Now let me give you room, love; I couldn't bear for you to feel that I had tied you to me when you had the chance to meet other men and – and fall in love with someone nearer your own age.\" \"Colonel, sir, sometimes you're a jackass my dear\" said Roberta. oOoOo \"I take it you got bored, Old Man\" said Manco knocking and coming in on invitation. \"You seemed to be handling it\" said Mortimer. \"I take it the kid had been going to have a room to herself\" said Manco. \"Not that I disapprove; unless Niyol snores.\" Roberta giggled. \"Douglas told him that would be the only reason you might object\" she said. \"Well he's going to travel with us too\" said Manco \"He knows the way and all the best places to camp; I wasn't about to turn that down. He's meeting someone in Phoenix.\" \"IS it a Marshal?\" asked Roberta. Manco raised an eyebrow. \"Didn't ask\" he said. \"Well if he chooses to tell us, all well and good; if he chooses not to, that's all well and good too\" said Mortimer. \"I'm off to shop for provisions while it's still light. Anything you want in particular, boy?\" Manco shrugged. \"Some cigars if they have them\" he said. \"Failing that, a chaw of baccy. You know what to get for the trail. Kid going to carry for you?\" Mortimer glanced at Roberta. \"Feel like braving the roughest dive I yet saw?\" he asked. Roberta shrugged. \"As you say from time to time, I won't learn any younger\" she said. \"If I can handle myself here I guess I need be afraid of no place.\" \"Well said cub\" said Manco \"I'll keep an eye on the horses and our packs; those rednecks are well bruised but I don't put it past that cowboy playmate of yours to make trouble.\" Mortimer nodded thanks; and headed into the town with Roberta at his heels. They could hunt for some of their needs but to have some jerky as well as replenishing their meagre supply of beans and flour and corn meal would not be a bad idea. And some more ammunition. Coffee was getting low too. He added some concentrated vegetable cubes and remarked to Roberta, \"In the army they called this dessicated vegetable; so the troops showed what they thought by calling them desecrated vegetable. Vegetable matter is good to keep us healthy.\" \"There's dried onion here as well as the vegetable cubes\" said Roberta \"That will add to the flavour of a stew or baked beans in addition to the salt pork and molasses which we haven't got yet.\" \"Quite right\" said Mortimer. \"They fed the Yankees on canned pork and beans, you know; and that was supplies we preferred not to capture because it was all beans and very little pork. And I was planning on buying bacon not salt pork because there's more flavour to it, and we can fry it for breakfast too to eat with Johnny cake or pancakes; and I want some powdered mustard to add to the pork and beans the way my ma used to make it; since you're a good enough trail cook to make it worth bothering.\" Roberta grinned; she had been taught to cook of course; every woman needed that skill. And she had soon adapted to cooking on a makeshift fire using a pot suspended over it, and a spider to fry on. She had quickly learned to make the Colonel's favourites, too, like cracklin' bread; in the time he was training her, he would cook while she watched, exhausted from her endeavours and she learned by seeing how he did things. And pork and beans had been a staple for its ease of preparation, the beans soaked overnight then boiled in the pot with a bit of fat pork and molasses to flavour it. \"So the Yankees were the origin of the song about Captain Jinks of the horse marines?\" she said \"More corn and beans than pork and beans?\" \"He was a Yankee; had to be to be that stupid\" said Mortimer cheerfully. \"The song was written just after the war as I recall.\" They bought oats as well as a supplement to grass for the horses for where vegetation was sparse; and oatmeal to make oat cakes and thicken stews; and of course essentials such as salt, and clarified butter in tins that would travel better for being so treated . The butter might be used to fry when the bacon was gone; but a good fat joint of bacon would see plenty of fat to rub into the spider to fry with as well as making cracklin's for bread. And then they returned to the saloon with Roberta singing, \"I'm Captain Jinks of the Horse Marines I feed my horse on corn and beans I often live beyond my means I'm a captain in the army!\" oOoOo Roberta awoke in the night to find Mortimer's arm flung over the packs, unable to reach her; and gently kissed each finger before sliding her own hand under his when she lay down again, facing him; and his hand closed around hers. It made her feel immensely secure, and she drifted back to sleep to dream rather vaguely of what she wanted from him that was linked rather hazily to his very clinical anatomy notes that had been made what seemed such a very long time ago. Colonel Mortimer's dreams were along more experienced lines. Both enjoyed their dreams. oOoOo Next morning's start was early. The horses grumbled slightly at having heavier saddlebags with the provisions divided out amongst them; they had been carrying smaller loads recently. \"They've got soft travelling by rail\" said Manco. \"We'll take it gently\" said Mortimer \"No point straining a hock by over-riding them; they have softened. So have we. A couple of days gentler going to get back into the swing of travel won't do us any harm, nor the horses either. That all right with you, Niyol?\" The Indian shrugged. \"It is always best not to abuse your horse\" he said \"I too have been much on the train; my horse will thank you for a gentle start.\" They left town before many people were about; the barkeeper had got up to feed them, glad to be rid of dangerous people; otherwise only the earliest workers were abroad, those tending livestock or bringing in the early milk to the saloons and such private houses as there were who bought milk in and did not have their own cow. They had barely left town when Niyol stiffened. \"I hear horse fittings ahead that are not ours\" he said \"And there are fresh tracks of a dozen men. I think there is an ambush prepared for us.\" \"I see the sign\" said Manco looking. \"There is horse dung not an hour old; is that how you tell the track is recent?\" asked Roberta. \"One way, yes, young one\" said Niyol. \"You will learn well if you remain observant; if we all survive this.\" \"If they want trouble\" said Mortimer grimly \"They can have it.\"[Chapter 17] Chapter 17 The trail led through a narrow valley filled with tumbled rocks alive with scrubby bushes, some of them in flower; it was still cold early in the morning as autumn drew in and the beautiful little valley was encrusted with a delicate silver frosting that turned an already beautiful scene into a fairyland. Roberta rather resented the concept that so pretty a ride was to be spoiled by a fight. \"How do we behave in this situation?\" she asked \"Do we refuse to give fight so as not to hurt them?\" \"No kid; we kill them\" said Mortimer, grimly. \"You don't ambush travellers unless you are prepared to use guns, because you know that guns will be drawn. Unless they none of them have guns ready; when I think we're all good enough to hold our fire.\" \"We spring it head on or go round and ambush THEM?\" asked Manco. \"Ground is too broken to leave the trail unless you want to go on foot\" said Niyol. \"Up to you, old man\" said Manco. Mortimer considered. Ambushing ambushers had its attractions; and too they might then be surprised and maybe captured not killed. Maybe. They'd probably still fight. Their kind were too foolish to know when they were outclassed; even Roberta, with her intensive training, was now a professional gunfighter not a cowboy who could fire a gun well enough to fill the pot. \"We spring it by riding into it\" said Mortimer. \"Guns ready. And at cavalry pace.\" Manco nodded. They set forth at the canter; and as the dozen cowboys rode out to bar there way, guns aimed, kept right on going, firing as they rode. A rapidly approaching target that also jinks and swerves is hard to hit; the distance changes so rapidly. To the disciplined gunfighters taking down a couple of the cowboys each before they were even upon them was no real trouble; and Roberta was pleased to see that her targets went down. There was an unspoken agreement that they would fan out and take those opponents within their own sector of approach; they worked well together. And Niyol seemed able to read the way they did things without difficulty. The cowboys fired off a load of wild shots but none connected. Manco took four; Mortimer three. There was one man left on his horse staring in horror. Mortimer reined in. \"Banditry's something they hang you for, boy\" he said to the remaining horseman. \"I suggest you render assistance to your wounded and eschew the business of setting ambushes in the future. I can't be bothered to take you in to the sheriff and finish off these other bandits.\" \"We ain't bandits!\" said the cowboy \"Only Rusty said as you needed to be taught a lesson about respect!\" \"Well\" said Mortimer \"Looks like he's the one that learned it. Better hope you learned it too, boy.\" They rode on. oOoOo They followed the green San Pedro Valley for a while to the north before turning west on one of its tributaries; following valleys was easier than going across the harsh desert or trying to follow where the new railway line was being graded; and much easier on their mounts. By the time they had negotiated the meanders of the river it was time and more to stop to eat; which they did at the confluence of the rivers. The valley they followed was largely dry, meaning that the going was easier by riding up its bed; but water might be found at intervals, They would follow this to a small town called Mescal where, said Mortimer, the railroad from the west had certainly made it to go on into Tucson and thence to Phoenix. They camped overnight and without any serious ado made it to Mescal late the following morning. \"At least the railroad is almost completed\" said Mortimer \"Soon it will be less than an hour to travel from Benson to Mescal.\" \"We live in a wonderful age, Douglas\" said Roberta in awe \"How quickly things are changing! And on the whole for the better, too; with such rapid transport there is very little that cannot be accomplished, and goods may be shipped by rail so easily that one day no community will ever be isolated or in danger of starvation from a local flood or fire.\" \"Indeed\" agreed Mortimer. \"The days of cowboys such as those who set upon us is almost gone; before long ranch hands will drive cattle to the nearest railhead, and that will not be far from anywhere, and load the cattle for transportation onto special cars for their transport; and then the meat will arrive in good order, not tough from long travel.\" They were to eat in Mescal before catching the train to Tucson. It was perhaps unfortunate that a bravo looking to make a name for himself decided that even if the hard faced man in the poncho and the eagle eyed man in black were too dangerous, and the Indian insignificant, their comrade might prove easier game. He jostled Roberta and spilled her drink. Roberta eyed him coldly. \"What are you looking at?\" said the stranger. \"Apparently someone too rude to make an apology for clumsiness\" said Roberta coldly. \"I, clumsy? It was you who was clumsy, jackass!\" said the man. \"Oh? Then I'm so sorry about how clumsy I can be when jostled\" said Roberta and poured the rest of her drink over his crotch. Mortimer sighed; but this newcomer was spoiling for a fight. Roberta had had no way to avoid it. \"You'll answer for that you little jerk!\" said the man. \"Let's take this outside!\" \"Fists or pistols?\" asked Roberta, her heart sinking. \"Pistols\" said the man. \"As you wish\" said Roberta. He left. \"No way out of this I suppose?\" said Roberta. \"Only by killing him\" said Manco. \"You could wound him; but then he'd be a live enemy to worry about\" said Mortimer. \"And he's only out to add your scalp to his collection in terms of notches on his gun. Make it a clean kill.\" \"Can I?\" asked Roberta. \"Of course you can\" said Mortimer \"I trained you, didn't I?\" She nodded a little tremulously. Fighting in a group with the others against desperados was one thing; fighting mano a mano for something utterly trivial was something else. \"It's silly\" she said in disgust. \"Of course it's silly\" said Mortimer \"It's also the only way second rate punks like him can make a name for themselves. Now out you go before he gives out that you're yellow\" Mortimer was angry; and afraid for Roberta; but there was no way out. She could not afford to be called yellow, she would attract violence from everyone. And now she was a good shot. Roberta nodded and made her way outside with a firm step; the three men went with her to see fair play. \"Thought you weren't coming\" the gunslinger jeered. \"You can think? My, how impressive\" said Roberta. There were some chuckles from those who had assembled – tucked safely under stoops – to watch the entertainment. Sensible folk might have withdrawn within and bolted their doors; but there were always those happy to watch a gunfight. The sun was almost overhead; almost. Roberta walked down the street towards it. \"What are you making a run for it?\" cried her opponent. \"Oh is the distance too great for you, boy?\" said Mortimer with a sneer. Roberta had withdrawn about a hundred feet; two or three times the distance most gunfights took place at. It favoured the accurate. \"Watch it; you might be next\" said the furious gunslinger; who did think it too great but did not care to be sneered at. He dared not fire until Roberta turned; he would have no name but an unpleasant one for shooting a man in the back. And with his quarry's friends around it was unwise in the extreme. Roberta turned; she had wanted to give herself the advantage of having the sun over her shoulder, even if it was at too oblique an angle to cause her opponent much dazzle. He would have to squint a little but not much. She also wanted the advantage of distance; because Douglas Mortimer had drilled her ruthlessly in getting the best range out of her Buntline. It took slightly longer to draw than a gun with a shorter barrel; but had the advantage of accuracy over distance. And she wore it across her belly like Douglas did to improve the speed of the draw too. It was one of the two ways a gunfighter wore his gun; the more common way that distinguished a gunfighter was the thong about the thigh to hold the holster steady. This man wore his tied thus. She saw her opponent's hand move; and she was drawing, aiming, firing in one movement, in the way that had become automatic, requiring no thought or decision. She heard her own gun fire; and the sharp crack of a shot from her opponent. And then he was crumpling and falling to the ground. Roberta spun her gun around her finger with a flourish and returned it to the holster; and then there were men around her, shaking her hand, patting her on the back. \"Say kid, that was some shot!\" said one \"That skunk's taken down six men already; you are one cool hand! And a hole drilled right through the forehead at THAT distance!\" \"When I shoot a rattlesnake I like to be a long way from its bite\" said Roberta. \"If he couldn't manage accurate, he didn't ought to play with real men.\" She nearly giggled saying this; and that was partly from a mildly hysterical relief. The remark was repeated; and Roberta found herself treated and toasted. She also earned the appellation of 'Snakekiller Bobby'. \"You did good, Bobby\" said Mortimer. \"I was terrified, Douglas\" admitted Roberta \"I heard him fire; but I didn't even feel it pluck my clothing; did he actually miss me entirely?\" \"Yes\" said Mortimer, grinning. \"A masterstroke to take the distance; and good shot by the way.\" \"Not really\" said Roberta \"I was aiming for the centre of his body like you taught me. I fired high.\" \"That's why you aim for the centre of the body\" said Mortimer \"So that a slight deviation from line doesn't matter. We'll work on it though.\" \"Yes Colonel sir\" said Roberta, grinning at him.[Chapter 18] A/N Thanks to both Clio1792 and Artemis Acorn who have been very helpful with both the dynamics of slavery in the south and the speech patterns I need to use without falling into the Uncle Remus trap. I'm trying here too to explore the idea that there's more than one kind of slavery than one with shackles and to note that the Civil War wasn't a quick fix for slavery. If anyone wants to send me hate mail you either probably missed the point or are a sad creature who needs a sheet with eyeholes in it. Chapter 18 When the train came into Tucson it was supposed to be for only a short stop; but Roberta gave a cry, glancing out of the window and leaped up to exit the train. \"Get the horses\" said Mortimer, in a resigned voice, to Manco, getting hastily to his feet and picking up Roberta's baggage as well as his own. \"I will stay on the train if you not mind\" said Niyol. \"You have a safe journey, friend\" said Manco. \"Our best to the Marshal\" said Mortimer, enjoying the effect on the Indian who half started at that. \"What, you think you're the only one who can read men?\" \"I guess that will be a good lesson to Niyol\" said the Navajo wryly. \"The marshal will laugh; I pass on your good wishes.\" oOoOo \"Amaryllis! What are you doing so far west?\" demanded Roberta, having come up to the black girl the sight of whom had elicited her hasty exit of the train. The girl turned. \"Excuse me young massa, dis po' girl don' know you\" she said \"Tho' you knows ma name sho' 'nough.\" Roberta dropped her voice. \"Look again Amaryllis; last time you saw me you dressed me in a red velvet gown; it's me, Roberta!\" Amaryllis gave a little shriek and put her hands to her face. \"Land sakes!\" she cried \"not ma own sweet Miss 'Berta?\" \"HUSH\" said Roberta \"Mister Robert now; can you come and have a coffee and tell me what you're doing here?\" \"Honey Ah have to wait fo' – here he is, ma uncle Joseph\" said Amaryllis. \"Joseph!\" Mortimer had caught up with his quicksilver beloved and recognised the man who was nervously approaching his niece and the – as he thought – young white man. \"Massa Douglas as dis ol' negr' does live and breathe!\" cried Joseph and flung himself on Mortimer's neck. Mortimer embraced him back. \"Joseph, an unusual amount of effusion\" he said \"You aren't supposed to feel that way for an evil slaveowner when you have your freedom. And I wish you'd not speak like that.\" \"Huh\" said Joseph \"You rises beautiful like you always did, Massa Douglas. As for that blood-suckin' ol' carpet-bagger, he 'spect more from we poor negros on his land, as should be yo' land by rights than ever even ol' Bubba Carmichael wanted outta his slaves when he owned de next plot to yours; and as Gellibrand won't pay more'n what he thinks fair, which ain't fair by a long stalk now we has to buy our own food as free men, we's free to starve unless we does his special jobs. He have lost most o' the people, who've gone lookin' fo' work elsewhere, but me I'm tied wit' ma family; tho' yo's ma family too, Massa Douglas, the scrapes we got into together man and boy; and if yo' say the word I'd work fer you fo' ma food, yes SIR rather than be tied to that ol' skinflint and be de one to bring disgrace on ma family if it come out dat dis poor old man been smuggling, fo' who would believe it was on de orders of de rich white man wit' his generous freeing's of us po' slaves?\" \"Less of dis po' ol' man\" said Mortimer \"You fraud, Joseph; we were born on the same day so I know to the second how old you are and I ain't ready to be old yet. You shall certainly work for me and on good wages too. I am on the hunt for the wrongdoing of Gamaliel Gellibrand; and anything you can tell me is of great moment. And could mean a proper freedom for your family if we can swing this. Let's find somewhere quiet to discuss this.\" oOoOo \"Right; shed the poor old negro accent and the massa crap and let's get down to brass tacks\" said Mortimer when they were seated in a quiet corner in a bar – the guns of the three bounty hunters having stilled the protests over serving blacks before they even rose to the lips of the barkeep – with Manco assimilating that the Colonel had just had the lucky break of falling in with old friends. Joseph grinned. \"It's hard, Douglas\" he said \"Gellibrand really likes the idea that we is all uneducated and speak like it; he done dream of being a slaveowner, and one of the stamp of Bubba Carmichael, may his bones rot.\" Mortimer chuckled. \"HOW many of his slaves did we manage to spirit away to the underground railway between us?\" he asked. \"Plenty\" said Joseph. \"And your father swearing blind that he would never let runaways cross his land; good thing they never asked the young master. Such an angelic and innocent face as you had!\" \"Hey, let's not descend to insults\" said Mortimer. \"I bet he was a cute little boy\" said Roberta. Amaryllis had whispered to her uncle rapidly; and Joseph grinned unrepentantly at Mortimer. \"Oh I know a few stories his future wife would be glad to know\" he said. \"We has lied for each other him 'n' me; his mammy was sick all the time, poor woman; he growed up 'long o' me with my mammy and if there was any mischief on the estate, and it wasn't him and me, well I daresay we knowed about it.\" \"That, I'm afraid, is true\" said Mortimer \"And we covered for my sister and her young man too.\" \"Did you run that murderin' bastard to earth?\" asked Joseph. \"Yup\" said Mortimer \"Manco here helped me hunt down El Indio. He's dead.\" Joseph stuck out a hand. \"Any friend o' the Colonel is a friend o' mine\" he said. Manco shook. \"We're partners\" he said. \"We cuttin' your friend in here, old man?\" \"That's his choice\" said Mortimer. \"I'd as soon go back to being a farmer – well most of the year anywise – and gathering up my people who have been abused by Gellibrand. They don't come much worse than him; hypocrites who want to be Southern Gentlemen with precious little of the gentleman about them. With the bounties we've been taking I can afford to get the land back into good heart and subsidise pay until it's running more profitably. Sorry Manco; pipe dreams without tobacco until we can oust Gellibrand.\" \"Yeah\" said Manco. \"You ain't the usual cut of slave owner I guess.\" Mortimer shrugged. \"Maybe it was growing up alongside Joseph and seeing him and his family more as people than being blinded by tradition of seeing them only as assets\" he said. \"When you've gone fishing and hunting and set booby traps together you ain't master and slave, you're friends. And pa himself, who died believing in the rights of one man to own another, always preached the philosophy that you took care of them even so. Carmichael suspected him of helping his slaves because he reckoned he was soft. We'd have played a load of tricks on Carmichael only he'd have blamed his own slaves\" he added regretfully. \"VERY like Gellibrand\" said Joseph. \"The long and short of it is that we're smuggling guns into Mexico and liquor to the Reservations as a sideline; and the gold and silver that pays for them coming out. It's all covered in the agricultural goods we're supposedly trading; nobody stop de po' ol' negr' shippin' de massa's goods, sah.\" \"MMMmmm\" said Mortimer. \"What you doing in Tucson, Joseph?\" \"On my way up to Phoenix to investigate if there really is a gold mine, or has been a gold mine as belonged to one Jacob Walz\" said Joseph. \"And I brought Amaryllis account o' how I don't trust that dirty old man to keep his cotton-pickin' paws off o' her. If there's even the whisper of a mine, it helps to make the gold for smuggled goods look legitimate. O' course the greedy fat bastard is hoping there's a gold mine too.\" \"What's the story?\" asked Roberta \"This mine is supposed to be abandoned?\" \"Yes\" said Joseph \"Jacob Walz, who may or may not have murdered his way into owning it died and is said to have given a few people some clues as to its whereabouts. Gellibrand would like to have it; but so long as one of his po' ol' negr's can claim to have found it for him he'll be happy to just pretend to launder the smuggling money.\" \"I'm amazed he trusts you so well\" said Mortimer. Joseph shrugged. \"He think he have the hold over me of my mammy; she's old and frail but she looks on you like another son, Douglas; she would want me to do what's right. And I know you'd see about taking care of her.\" \"I would\" said Mortimer grimly. \"And he is aware how clever you are?\" \"Oh I is smart for a negr' massa but no he hasn't a clue\" said Joseph. \"Nor that you learned me to speak near as clear as any white man.\" \"If Southerners can be said to speak clearly at all\" said Manco. Joseph grinned at him. \"Oh at least we speak clearer than you dam'yankees\" he said. \"But he knows I have the gift of the gab – and can make my way though tricky situations. So he sends me; and it's a living, and I don't care so much that Uncle Sam gets diddled, because after all, we never got a whole lot of change outa being free; only thing we gained was the resentment of the po' white trash who can't look quite as much down on us as they used to. All they have to despise is our colour. And o' course we don't get paid near as much as a white man doing the same job; even when his pay ain't scarcely enough.\" \"Well I ain't goin' into politics\" said Mortimer \"I'd be tempted to shoot all the other politicos.\" \"And that's a bad idea in what respect?\" asked Manco. \"Po' black man have to clear up de mess' said Joseph in a flash. \"Or the women\" said Roberta. Amaryllis giggled shyly. \"Wus for me, de po' black women!\" she said. \"Ain't it just true\" said Mortimer. \"Bobby, if Amaryllis will join us as your maid you could stop masquerading if you wanted to.\" \"Have I got to?\" asked Roberta. \"I get the fun this way. Besides, I want to find out how long it takes for Snakekiller Bobby to be notorious as a bounty hunter. Mortimer cuffed her gently. \"If we can pull this business off you won't need to be notorious as a bounty hunter\" he said \"We just have to find a way to show that Gamaliel Gellibrand is doing this; because I wager there aren't many sheriffs who'd run against a rich man when he can be talked into believing that all this freedom went to the head of his black factotum and have Joseph well and truly fitted up; and I sort of object to that.\" \"Not as much as I do\" said Joseph. \"Well\" said Manco \"'F you'd ask me, I'd say a federal marshal that Joseph can lay information to 'd be just dandy.\" \"That, boy, is a damned good idea\" said Mortimer fishing out his pipe. \"You got a spare one up your sleeve wit de white man's magic massa?\" said Joseph. \"Well we know a Marshal's scout\" said Mortimer. \"To Phoenix!\" cried Roberta. \"But not until after lunch\" said Manco.[Chapter 19] Chapter 19 \"Douglas, I AM glad you were involved in helping slaves escape\" said Roberta quietly as they sat together on the train. Joseph and Amaryllis were banished to some less salubrious carriage; freedom did not necessarily mean any kind of equality. \"Well there's no real virtue in it you know\" said Mortimer \"It was very much a joint motive of doing a bad favour to our next neighbour, Bubba Carmichael, who was a most unpleasant man, and a boys' lark. Oh to be sure, I was sorry for the people we got away for belonging to such a man; but I can't say I had ever reflected deeply upon the state of slavery at all. Joseph was my friend; and he was just Joseph, and in front of others he had to remember to call me Master Douglas; but I don't think that I ever connected that at all with his state of slavery: small boys are monsters of selfishness you know! And by the time I was starting to reflect on the inequalities, well we were going to war with the North. And right at first, the war was NOT hung on the issue of slavery – though to be sure it was an issue insofar as the slave owning South would be able to exploit California and the new territories more effectively if we ended up with ownership of them.\" \"So when did it become an issue?\" asked Roberta. \"When Britain, who depended heavily on our cotton for her manufacturing industry, was preparing to come in on the Southern side, using as her excuse the idea that it upheld the original constitution that left open the idea that states should be permitted to secede\" said Mortimer. \"But Britain had led the way in the abolition of slavery; and Lincoln made one of the cleverest and most astute political moves ever in the history of mankind when he declared the War of Northern Aggression – as we called it, since we saw the North interfering in our rights to govern ourselves – to be a war on slavery. That's boiled down and simplified but it more or less covers it. Suddenly we weren't the heroic rebels doing no more nor less than the whole of the United States had previously done to Great Britain; no, suddenly we were the bogey-men. Of course Britain might have still offered aid on the condition that we phased out slavery; and of course if we had succeeded in secession they would have been able to enforce it with the Royal Navy. But it didn't happen that way; and instead of a gradual emancipation that might have enabled a better integration of society it was all done by decree that had not been thought through. Perhaps had Lincoln lived he might have been astute enough to do it better; but he was assassinated, and slaves were suddenly free, and their former owners not always in a position to start to pay them, and so the economic crisis that had been started by having to pay for the war deepened. So help me, Roberta, if we can deal with Gellibrand and make a fortune in bounties along the way, I plan to overcome that deficit with my people at least and see that their children have equal education to any Northern kids, black and white both. When you own land you have a duty to those on that land, labourers or tenants; and I guess when you reduce your labourers to the state of cattle by owning them, too many people forgot that. And I abandoned my duty; because I wanted to avenge my sister; and because the land was no longer mine because being a staff member of the Confederate Army someone managed to make my land forfeit. Probably some lawyer's trick of Gellibrand's who picked the richest small estate he could find. And why was it rich? Because our people, our slaves, were well fed and well treated and it was in their self interest to work hard for that. It would still be fairly rich if they were paid good wages too; not perhaps so much but it's good land. I suspect however that Gellibrand is an abusive employer who uses terror to gain compliance. As well as underpaying his – my – people. Sorry my dear; that was a bit of a polemic.\" \"I think that it would be good to make enough to make sure that we CAN improve matters\" said Roberta \"Even if it's only for the few. Shall we look for Jacob Walz's gold mine too?\" Mortimer laughed. \"I fancy it exists more in the imagination than the actuality\" he said. oOoOo Phoenix was a town that was fast growing; the railroad had made it a hub and though it was still no more than a few streets in each direction, it was very busy. There was enough traffic to make it interesting crossing the wide streets; indeed main street, called Walsingham Street, was a hundred feet wide. \"Why Phoenix?\" asked Roberta. \"Politically neutral\" said Mortimer \"It was founded by Jack Swilling; he, being an ex Confederate, wanted to call it 'Stonewall'; that was a hot potato though, and the name 'Salina' was suggested.\" \"Well that's a bit of a stupid name\" said Roberta \"Though I guess there are stupider ones. Rincon, meaning 'corner' being one.\" \"When you have a country that's still growing naming places is hard I guess\" said Mortimer \"And physical features or names of people you admire sometimes seem the best compromise. And Phoenix had the distinction of being on the site of a long extinct civilisation so when the name Phoenix was suggested as a town that had grown out of the ashes it seemed like a good idea; especially as it's so hot you could imagining yourself being on the pyre\" he added. \"I guess that makes sense then\" said Roberta \"What was this previous civilisation then?\" Mortimer laughed. \"I'm not enough of a historian\" he said. \"Excuse me\" a man passing had heard this exchange and raised his hat. \"I should like to enlighten the lad if I may, in brief, to understand the region's history.\" \"Thank you sir\" said Roberta, raising her own hat politely. \"The Hohokam civilisation rose, we think, some seven hundred years before Christ's birth\" said the man \"And built more than a hundred miles of irrigation canals. Which may be able to be re-used more extensively with work\" he added \"Jack Swilling, who founded the town, reopened many of them to fulfil the agricultural potential of this vicinity. It's generally believed that in the middle ages there were conflicting series of droughts and floods that destroyed the culture. Alas that there is relatively little known as yet; but those of us who are interested do search for antiquities associated with the culture.\" \"Thank you very much sir!\" said Roberta \"Such natural disasters can be terrible for an isolated community; I was remarking only the other day how the railroad will be invaluable to bring aid to any struck by fire or flood.\" \"And not an option open to the Hohokam\" said the stranger \"Adoph Bandelier at your service; I am an archaeologist.\" \"Then I should warn you, sir\" said Mortimer \"That if you are asking questions or digging in the Superstition Mountains, that there is a gang of desperate men, potentially killers, looking for a gold mine there. I'm tracking them down; and trying to satisfy my nephew's curiosity about all things at the same time.\" Bandelier looked grave. \"The Indians have been concerned over white men bringing danger\" he said. \"There have been gunfights in the Superstition Mountains; I wish you luck bringing them to justice. I hope to conclude my studies here soon because I have been offered the chance to examine the Inca civilisation; but your words added to the warnings of the Indians means I shall certainly take care.\" They parted from the archaeologist to find somewhere to stay that would be near to a place Joseph and Amaryllis might also stay. oOoOo Phoenix sported around a score of saloons, the inevitable gambling parlours and the convenience of horse-drawn street cars pulling rather rickety looking carriages on rails for the convenience of those too drunk to walk across town from one gambling establishment to another. Roberta thought that you would have to be drunk not to notice how much they seemed to sway. There seemed to be no problem with having a couple of black people in their group; the mix was so disparate in this frontier town that the modest white-painted board hotel with sleeping porches to the rooms accepted all of them cheerfully and their dollars even more cheerfully. They took two rooms; one for Roberta and Amaryllis, and, said Mortimer, if people wanted to draw there own erroneous conclusions let them; and one for the men. Mortimer paid for a large room with a truckle; after all they might be here some while going in and out of town and trying to figure out what to do next. He admitted to Manco that he had no very clear plan as yet. \"Well old man, I thought you had no plan at all\" said Manco. \"He's clever; he'll pull the best plan of all out of the bag all in one go\" said Joseph. \"He's a good planner; I give him that\" said Manco. \"First thing is to find that Federal Marshal\" said Mortimer \"And see what HE says.\" \"Nope\" said Manco \"First thing is coffee and something to eat.\" A/N Adolph Bandelier, like Joseph Walz was a real man; you can google either one if you want to know more. The Dutchman's mine has [probably] never been found[Chapter 20] A/N Thanks to Artemis Acorn for digging up the legal position on getting wed Chapter 20 Federal Marshal Falk Peters listened to the story Joseph had to tell; and the explanation of why Mortimer was involved. He was impressed by the way Joseph turned to Colonel Mortimer for corroboration, not as a men turning in fear to one who had once owned him, but one who was trusted utterly; a truly unique situation in his knowledge of the South. True there had been some few previous slave owners who had managed to come to an amicable arrangement with their former slaves – and they were rare enough – for having been well meaning souls; but he had never seen the sort of bickering that usually one only found between siblings. It crossed his mind that they might indeed be half siblings; but that was none of his business. \"You are aware that though I count your deposition valid there will be plenty who will discount the word of a black man against a white one?\" he said. \"Yes sir\" said Joseph \"But Doug – The Colonel, he say we do this by law and hear what you advise.\" \"You ain't used to deferring judgement to others I'd say, Colonel\" said Peters, turning a penetrating pair of grey eyes on Mortimer. \"No, Marshal, I can't say that I am\" said Mortimer \"But you see, I want more than revenge; I want this tied up legal so that Joseph and his family can have true freedom; and I want to marry the girl that Gamaliel Gellibrand tried to force into marriage and I would like the option to go home. And without that I have the word of a law man that I can go after Gellibrand that ain't going to happen.\" \"I see\" said Peters. \"I'd like to give you word to bring him in; but I fear this might not hold up in court. Now if he was to write a letter about the smuggling, or were himself involved in it, that would be a different matter.\" \"You mean you'd like us to set him up\" said Manco. \"I'd like to hear from him words that tie him to it\" said Peters. \"Well that's easy\" said Roberta. \"You do the Uncle Remus act so very well, Joseph; why don't you write to him and tell him that there's a snag because the people you ran guns to won't give gold to a black man? Say it's some hidalgo wanting to make a bid for power who's got more pride than sense.\" \"That's a brilliant idea, Bobby, but for one thing\" said Joseph, who had fallen in with the way the others addressed Roberta. \"Mr Gellibrand, him not know dat dis po' ol' negr' can write.\" \"DAMN!\" said Roberta. \"But Uncle Joseph, I wuz learned to read, write and figure, t'make lists for Miss 'Berta\" said Amaryllis \"Sho' I can write dat yo' has telled me to write.\" \"Excellent and astute suggestion\" approved Mortimer. \"Should work\" agreed Manco. Joseph nodded. \"I'm not expecting to take anything over the border for a while; I wouldn't want to excite his suspicions right away, for now I'm supposed to be looking for the Walz mine.\" \"And I\" said Peters \"Am supposed to be stopping bloodshed over the wretched thing.\" \"Fine\" said Mortimer \"Deputise us all and we'll help you out; we ain't doing anything else until Joseph doesn't write his missive as you might say. Manco, you'll be an Hidalgo when the time comes? He doesn't know you.\" Manco grinned. \"Social climbing from bounty killer to Spanish grandee? I could get used to that\" he said. \"All right\" Peters agreed \"I might have sent you away while I did some digging about you; but the Man with No Name and the Man in Black are well known bounty hunters and known to be scrupulous. As well as having the personal recommendations of Niyol who has never been known to be wrong in his judgement. And I'll put my trust in those you vouch for. Raise your hands and make the oath of allegiance and I'll have to get some stars for you later.\" oOoOo Being deputised had its interesting moments. Mortimer insisted that as the Marshal was engaged in preventing bloodshed over the Dutchman's mine it behoved them to get involved with two groups of prospectors whose quarrel had spread out of the Tiger Saloon and onto the street; and was about to come to a shooting matter. Rapping the main protagonists sharply over the head with pistol butts seemed to work to quite rapidly make them lose interest in fighting each other since that activity was carried out before the half drunken would-be miners had realised than another, and more dangerous group had joined the fray. Mortimer drew attention to the deputy badge he was wearing to the followers amongst the combatants; and told them that they were all going to have the worst of it if they continued in a like manner. \"I can't be bothered to take you all to the lock up\" he said \"So I suggest you disperse. And by the way, if you want to dig for your own gold, all well and good; but forget the Dutchman's mine; it's been found, and claimed, by a group of God-botherers who have enough funds to guard it properly and enough sanctimony to dispatch anyone ungodly enough to go after their gold to stand before Holy Judgement. And that, my boys, supersedes the judgement of Uncle Sam.\" There was much discontented muttering; but the rivals departed, in opposite directions, taking their wounded with them. \"Where did you hear that?\" asked Manco. \"I made it up\" said Mortimer \"Which was why I was careful not to specify any sect or church. Hopefully the rumour might spread and help diffuse the trouble.\" Manco slapped his thigh and laughed his silent laugh. \"You sometimes do take the biscuit, old man!\" he said. oOoOo Mortimer knocked at Roberta's door; Amaryllis insisted on answering, and seeing who it was slid tactfully out of the room. \"I did promise we'd discuss things in Phoenix\" he said. Roberta ran to his arms and raised her mouth for a kiss; and his arms tightened convulsively about her and he bent his mouth to hers. If his hands wandered at all in that hard, passionate embrace it might be said that he felt a need to check that his handiwork had healed properly; but as he seemed to be enjoying it as much as Roberta was it never occurred to her to look for so spurious an excuse. At length he raised his head. \"Roberta….\" His voice was not steady. \"Do you really want to marry me? It seems so extraordinary to me…..\" \"Douglas!\" said Roberta \"When you bear in mind, my dear, that you are fitter than any eastern boy my age and probably like to live longer if nobody shoots you first – as can happen to a man of any age – as well as having the wisdom and knowledge boys my age rarely have, can it really surprise you that much that I prefer you to some callow youth?\" \"Yes\" said Mortimer \"But go on; I like having my ego stroked as well as the back of my neck. You have such an intoxicating touch…..\" Roberta was unable to go on for a short while because this led to another long kiss. \"Your ego doesn't need stroking\" she said \"Because you are self assured; that's attractive too, being self assured enough not to worry about what other people think, but not arrogant to make assumptions or put others down. And you are clever, knowledgeable, the best shot in the Carolinas and you've chosen to teach me. And you don't mind that I like being a boy; and I suspect that when we're married you won't mind if I don't ever go back to horrid old corsets and ride astride and do all the sorts of things ladies don't do.\" \"You don't need a corset\" said Mortimer \"And they're horrible things to break into. Then I'll make it a formal question my dear: will you do me the honour of becoming my wife?\" \"Oh yes, Douglas, with all my heart\" said Roberta. \"You may kiss me again.\" Mortimer was quite happy to comply with this instruction. Some time later, he said, \"I should like to marry you quickly to protect you; but of course we can't be married here where you are seen as Bobby the er, Snakekiller. Should you object to being married by Mormons?\" Roberta giggled. \"So long as I don't have to have four husbands\" she said. \"Over my dead body\" said Mortimer firmly. \"On the way to Gold Canyon there's s settlement called Lehi, it's a Mormon settlement. You could change into female attire right before we get there, we get married, then you change back after we leave.\" \"Sounds good to me\" said Roberta \"Then I have a marriage certificate; nice. I also\" she added thoughtfully \"Get to be given a PERSONAL anatomy lesson by you.\" Mortimer had not realised how easily he might still blush. \"Would you like that?\" he asked. Roberta was also blushing but smiling shyly. \"I would like it very much indeed\" she whispered. \"Then my dear, I shall obey the requirements of the law by posting a notice of intent in the local newspaper – it won't even be read by most people – and take that with us as proof of publication of intent\" said Mortimer \"Which might or might not be required but let's be on the safe side. You're over sixteen so you don't need parental consent; and last time I looked I was over eighteen, so all we have to do is to draw up a contract of intent to wed each other and find ourselves a preacher. I'll see if I can't buy a licence as well to be on the safe side; I don't think that there'll be a problem about a waiting time, Phoenix is too full of transients to enforce that very strictly! I don't think we'll have to make an official elopement to Yuma; even with the railroad it would take us in the opposite direction to the Superstition Mountains and I don't suppose Joseph is the only one of Gellibrand's employees looking for that mine. I'd like to get there. Time to consider Yuma if the Mormons in Lehi make a fuss.\" \"Oh, if they do, well think again or just live together until we can tie the knot legally; though I'm glad that I'm considered of age\" said Roberta \"Though after we have enjoyed marital relations in wedlock or out of it, it is too late for my father to complain.\" \"Quite so\" said Mortimer, kissing her again.[Chapter 21] I actually dreamed this one and I'm not about to pass up a good story if it presents itself to my subconscious. Chapter 21 Roberta was rudely awakened out of sweet dreams of being in her Douglas' arms by first a clap of thunder, followed rapidly by a hammering on her door and her lover's less than lover like voice shouting to get up and get dressed. Amaryllis was hiding under the bedclothes. \"Amaryllis, honey, get up and get dressed\" said Roberta, pulling the sheet off the frightened girl \"When Douglas uses that tone, you don't argue.\" \"I don' much like storms, Miss Berta; you knows that\" said Amaryllis \"I been that sceert; loudest one dat I ever knowed!\" \"Well you silly girl, why didn't you wake me?\" said Roberta \"I never noticed it; I'd have given you a cuddle, because I do know how you hate storms, and it's my father's fault for telling you that it was God coming to punish you when you were first my maid way back when. My father tells lies when it suits him and the Almighty has better things to do than punish ordinary sinners when he hasn't made a push to do anything to Congress or other great sinners\" and she threw Amaryllis' dress over to her as she pulled her own clothes on rapidly. The two girls left the room, holding hands; Douglas and Manco and Joseph were waiting. \"The storm's a bit close; and I picked a hotel on high land to prevent being caught in flash floods\" said Douglas \"There's a house up the road been struck; we were going up to help.\" \"We'll come\" said Roberta \"Outside's safest place to be so long as there are taller things to hit.\" \"What I figured\" said Mortimer. oOoOo The house that had been struck was a two story building; and the householder had managed to get his heavily pregnant wife out. She was screaming for her son; and as they ran up, an upstairs window opened and a girl in a nightgown leaped out. She struck the sidewalk heavily and lay ominously still. \"My baby! Where's my BABY?\" howled the pregnant woman. A child's cries could just be heard above the crackle of flames. \"Douglas; throw me\" said Roberta. It was something they had practised; she, being light had a chance of getting higher. Mortimer briefly clenched his fists in half rejection of the idea; then turned back to the house, and made a stirrup. Roberta ran a few steps, jumped lightly to place one foot on his hands and with his toss reached the second storey window. All the climbing paid off; she hung a moment then pulled herself up with main strength. She might not have the upper body strength of a boy her size but she had more training to use the muscle that she did have. In an instant she was in the window. Douglas Mortimer turned and stared up; all he cared for in the world was in a burning building. And then she was back at the window with a screaming child, lowering the toddler by the wrists. Mortimer stood under the window; and Roberta dropped her burden. Mortimer caught him easily and passed him off to Amaryllis who was sobbing in terror. Giving her something to do would be good. \"Take him to his mother\" said Mortimer tautly as Roberta swung herself over the sill; glanced backwards and called \"DOUGLAS!\" as she threw herself off the sill. Manco was at his back to brace him as he caught her; as the roof fell in. \"Steady old man\" said Manco \"Can't have you bowled over by love.\" \"Go to hell\" said Mortimer \"And thanks.\" \"That was a little close\" said Roberta. \"The storm is making a little bit of a noise too\" said Manco \"You did okay kid.\" This from Manco was fairly high praise so Roberta grinned shakily at him. \"I need a stiff drink\" she said. \"You don't like strong liquor\" said Mortimer mildly, hustling her away before any of the building fell any further forward. \"I could change my mind\" said Roberta. The young couple wanted to shake her hand, tearful and grateful; it seemed that the girl who had jumped had been the nursemaid who had chosen to try to save her own life and leave her charge; the young husband was busy contrasting that with the bravery of this mere boy. \"Bobby has cast iron ones\" said Mortimer with his tongue firmly in his cheek. A hook and ladder cart had arrived at the gallop and a bucket chain had already been organised; and then the heavens broke with torrential rain. \"A bit late\" said Roberta, who had excused herself from being thanked volubly to join the bucket gang. The rain soon did what willing neighbours could not; the young couple might hope to salvage some of their possessions from the debris; the rain was what Roberta heard a local describe as 'raining straight up'; each huge drop hit the ground so hard it was jumping nearly a foot right up. It was actually painful. \"And this is what causes flash floods\" said Mortimer \"I didn't like the look of the sky over the Superstition Mountains when we rode into town and I suspected this might be coming\" he paused to pass a bucket as the last few flames were doused inside the house \"But the mother and father of electrical storms I did not expect first – though I should have done. Bobby you look all in; this is under control. Let's get back to the hotel.\" oOoOo Roberta was shivering violently; and it was not just from having been soaked right through. Mortimer helped to rub her down and undress her, talking quietly about the causes of thunderstorms just to have something to talk about, as to a skittish horse; Amaryllis, surreptitiously stripping her own wet clothes off, listened in fascination. \"Colonel, sah, I ain't never gwine t'be sceered o' storms again\" she said \"It just part o' God's nat'ral world.\" \"Good girl!\" said Mortimer. \"All of nature can wreak havoc but by avoiding being stupid you can usually avoid getting the worst of it. If there'd been a lightning conductor on that house this would not have happened. Actually\" he added \"I heard tell of a town where the church was next to a brothel; and the brothel had a lightning conductor; and the parson called for the sinful to be struck down. Next storm, church burned to the ground; the brothel was fine. The next Parson, who was as Godly as anyone but didn't believe in tempting providence, put in a lightning conductor when he rebuilt the church. That's better\" as a giggle escaped from Roberta. \"Douglas I want to be held tight\" said Roberta \"I had to do that but I've never been so scared! I held my handkerchief over my mouth and nose not to cough, but the smoke made it dark and confusing; and the baby was starting to choke on the smoke! I got back to the window all by guess…\" \"But you got back\" said Mortimer, sitting her on his knee, swathed in a blanket. \"and you got out in time, my brave love, which is better than getting out just too late. Or we shouldn't be having this conversation. You did good\" he added. Roberta clung to him and cried sobs of relief and shock; and Amaryllis quietly left them to it. After Roberta had finished a good cry, Mortimer kissed her sore eyes, swollen from the smoke as well as from crying; and it was a short trip down to her mouth. Roberta kissed him back, feeling the longing in his kisses, made more passionate from a fear that he might have lost her so soon after having found her; and she moved against him. \"Not until we're married my darling\" said Mortimer firmly, wrapping her up again where she had contrived to become unwrapped. \"You go to sleep; the storm has moved away and we're in no more danger of a lightning strike.\" She murmured a protest; but he laid her firmly upon the bed, kissed her once, quickly, and left her. Amaryllis came back in at his bidding; and the two girls embraced. \"Busy night\" said Roberta laconically. \"You is so brave, Miss 'Berta!\" said Amaryllis. Roberta shrugged. \"It happened so fast there wasn't time to chicken out\" she said . \"Well, I'm ready for some sleep if you are.\" \"Sho' thing, Miss 'Berta!\" said Amaryllis \"And dis good rain make it cooler and easier to sleep too; specially as I'm plum tuckered out!\" \"You and me both\" said Roberta and promptly fell asleep.[Chapter 22] Chapter 22 The next morning showed a very different town to the one in which they had gone to sleep. There was a stream instead of a road outside the hotel and much of the town was flooded out, and people living in the usual one storey buildings with false fronts had been driven from their homes, if they could get out in time, as the waters rose. Corpses were being laid out of those drowned in the rapidly rising waters; or, as Manco said, those who had died of exposure for being in cold water and unable to get to higher ground and died of being wet through. The dead were largely women and children. \"They're like you were before I trained you\" said Mortimer to Roberta \"Willing, and tough enough to come west; but still essentially not fully fit. Add to that skirts to weigh them down and the poor creatures never had much of a chance. The waters rise fast in the desert; no chance to sink in. That storm in the mountains swelled the river, the rain here just put the lid on it.\" \"Rose fifteen feet overnight, mister, above the normal river level, and still rising\" said a passer by. \"Glad I listened to the missus when she told me to pick a lot on a rise. 'George' she said \"You've seen drownded people in arroyos as we came west; don't you let us be one of them. Sent me down to give a roof to them as have been flooded out; are you people all okay?\" \"Thank you; yes\" said Mortimer \"We're at a hotel – and I picked one on a rise because I didn't like the sky. Just passing through. But if we can contribute to a soup fund if your wife's expecting to feed people…..\" he handed over some bills; and Manco and Roberta did likewise. \"Well thank you kindly\" said the man \"I won't say no; and any left, that'll go to a fund to help get people clothes again.\" The gesture was not unnoticed and the man found himself the recipient of more spontaneous offerings from those people who had not suffered much if any damage. One pair of eyes was speculative; and Mortimer strolled over to the man speculating. He looked part Mexican, as indeed did many of the townsfolk; who were otherwise as disparate in their features as any might be from blonde, blue eyed Scandinavians to those of obvious Chinese descent. \"If that good man gets rolled\" said the Colonel \"I shall be taking issue with you, hombre; so if I was you, I'd just stop thinking any thoughts of profiting from the misfortunes of others and the generosity of their neighbours. Me entiendes, amigo?\" The man scowled. \"You got a nasty mind\" he said; but he had taken in the easy way Mortimer wore his gun, and the way he moved; and he turned and left the scene with almost unseemly haste. \"Well spotted old man\" said Manco. \"Oh just living up to the badge\" said Mortimer. \"No, enjoying terrorising the baddies\" said Roberta. \"That too\" agreed Mortimer, getting out his pipe. \"Think we'll wait over another day before travelling to let the waters drop a little.\" \"And I need female clothing\" said Roberta. \"Tuh you can borrow a dress from Amaryllis\" said Mortimer. \"'Less you're looking to cut a fashionable dash; which you ain't going to do in a dress bought in Phoenix anyroad.\" \"Depends if Amaryllis minds\" said Roberta. \"Yo' take whatever yo' needs honey\" said Amaryllis generously. \"Thank you\" said Roberta \"We shall BOTH cut a fashionable dash back east; I might even wear corsets briefly to make a point. And Amaryllis will be my companion not my maid.\" \"Are y'all hoping to get shot at?\" said Mortimer. \"Well I wouldn't want life in the east to get too boring, would I?\" said Roberta. \"Yup, she's your born mate all right\" said Manco. oOoOo Mortimer utilised the time in writing out a marriage contract for himself and Roberta; Roberta had of course given Mortimer her full real name for the contract, Leroyna Roberta Everard; explaining with a sniff that her father's name was Leroy and he wanted his daughter to have a version of it, but that he was the only person to use it. \"I can see why most people use your second name\" said Mortimer. \"It was mama's father's name; Robert Redcastle\" said Roberta. \"That's why my father don't like it above half. And it was partly for Robert E. Lee; mama's little rebellion. Back when she could still manage them\" she added softly and regretfully. Mortimer kissed her gently. When he had his property back he would take her mother into his own household; and let Leroy Everard complain about it! Next thing to be done was to sign the contract in front of witnesses; so Mortimer took Roberta and Manco to see the Marshal. He was not about to have any redneck questioning the legality of the document by having Joseph or Amaryllis sign it. \"There's a long story here, Marshal\" said Mortimer \"And when a villain like Gamaliel Gellibrand wants to paw a young girl you can see that she would take some desperate measures.\" \"If you're trying to tell me that Snakekiller Bobby is a girl, Niyol already worked that out\" said Peters calmly \"I'd never have guessed; but Niyol sees further than most people do.\" \"Well that cuts out a lot of time and embarrassing explanation\" said Roberta, pleased. \"We're signing a wedding contract and we hoped you'd be a witness for us.\" \"Can't get much more legal than a marshal\" said Manco. \"Miss, er, Everard, is it your WISH to marry Colonel Mortimer or is it just an escape from Gellibrand?\" asked Peters Roberta snorted. \"I HAVE escaped Gellibrand\" she said. \"I want to marry Douglas.\" \"Fair enough\" said Peters \"I had to ask. Fine; you sign it and Manco and me'll sign too.\" \"And I wouldn't for anyone else old man\" said Manco, appending his signature to theirs after Mortimer and Roberta had both signed in front of their witnesses. Mortimer glanced at his signature. \"No, I can see why not\" he said \"Parents who saddle their kids with names like that have to be sick in the head.\" \"Well if you use either of them I kill you\" said Manco. \"Manco, if I used either of them, I'd deserve it\" said Mortimer, folding up the document and putting it away in his inside pocket. \"Can I ask?\" said Roberta. \"Best not\" said Mortimer. \"I heard he killed a man for laughing at his mule. Who knows what he'd do if you laughed at his name?\" \"Manco if they're that bad, you have my sincere sympathy\" said Roberta. \"That's why I'm the man with no name\" said Manco \"Makes it easier not having any.\" \"If it's worse than my father's – Leroy – I can see why\" said Roberta. \"Far worse\" said Manco. His tone said that this was the end of the discussion. Roberta gave in with good grace; after all, to her he was Manco, and a friend. She might itch with curiosity but it was none of her business and not information he wanted to share; so that must do for her. oOoOo Many of the trails followed arroyos or streams; and following them would be out of the question until the flooding subsided. However with the flawless blue skies and the metallic taste of heat in the air from the earliest hour when they arose it was plain that the floods would not be there for many days; and though they would pick the higher ground to follow going east, the going would be easier for the bloom of grass and flowers soft under the feet of the horses. Bottlebrush was green and the scent of myrtle was redolent in the air after the rains. Bright flowers bloomed and reproduced quickly in the respite from the usual drought; and though it was going to be hot later it started cool enough to be pleasant. Less pleasant were the bodies of animals and the odd human who had been caught by the floodwater roaring down dry streambeds, stranded now on the sides of streams become innocuous as they receded back almost to their normal beds, or to slender trickles that would soon disappear. Roberta drew all the faces; by the time anyone came to collect them, wild beasts and the rapid decomposition of hot lands might well render them unrecognisable; with sketches at least the Sheriff's office had a good chance of finding someone who might put a name to the faces. It was the last, and only, service that might be readily rendered to them; Mortimer, Manco and Joseph threw up hasty cairns for the unfortunates to keep the worst ravages of wild animals from them and made a note of where they were; but it was all they could do. And presently Roberta went behind a pile of rocks and with help from Amaryllis put on one of the girl's dresses; Amaryllis insisting that Miss 'Berta wear her Sunday best frock. It was a practical as well as smart garment, black sateen cotton, heavily pintucked on the waist into the narrow waistband and more material in the skirt than an everyday dress, with a heavy flounce. The sleeves were plain and straight with fullness at the head enough to make it comfortable to wear; and Amaryllis sighed in satisfaction. \"Oh Miss 'Berta you look better in that than ever I done\" she said. \"Black isn't a flattering colour for you\" said Roberta. \"No Miss 'Berta; but it does for funerals as well to be respe'cable in\" said Amaryllis. \"Yo' pretty rose coloured dress yo' done give me that wuz took off me by yo' ma bein' too fine fo' a po' negr' girl.\" \"WELL!\" said Roberta, her eyes sparking angry fire \"I never knew that; and after she told me to give it away because of the tear you mended so beautifully for me; I have no time for someone who may be downtrodden before the master of the house but takes it out in petty unkindness to her servants! You will wear rose pink, dear Amaryllis, and ivory and you and I will be a picture together!\" Amaryllis giggled. \"Folks will say I'm the master's mistress\" she said. \"Let them\" said Roberta \"If it's thought he has a personal interest in you of that kind it will protect you.\" \"But Miss 'Berta, his good name….\" Amaryllis worried. \"YOUR good name is more important\" said Mortimer, who had heard the last bit of the exchange. \"And you will live in my house as what I believe you to be – my NIECE. Your mother was likely enough my father's daughter; and I shall claim the relationship and then life can be as interesting as my please even Roberta.\" \"Oh HOW that will annoy people!\" said Roberta in delight. \"Remind me not to visit you at home, old man, without life insurance and a lot of ammunition\" said Manco.[Chapter 23] Chapter 23 Lehi might not be built on the mesa that had given the unoriginal name to its sister town Mesa, where the Mesa company had settled to open more canals, but the community had avoided being badly flooded out. There really was a community spirit that pulled together; and it was noticeably mixed Indian and white. The strangers were welcomed; and the preacher, taking in immediately that Joseph and Amaryllis were obvious friends not servants drew his own conclusions over why the group had come out to Lehi to celebrate the nuptials of two of their number. His own community had been split when he had invited the local Indian population to become a part of the community; and he had his own views on racism. Accordingly he was delighted to see what he referred to as sisters and brothers in the Lord with such close friendships transcending skin colour. The preacher was more interested in knowing if the happy couple were good Christians than if their paperwork was spot on; and offered to baptise them into his church. Roberta firmly said that she had been baptised at birth and she didn't think that the Good Lord had missed noticing this so a second time was quite unnecessary; and Mortimer agreed. The ceremony was simple and moving, and all the details were scrupulously recorded. The law called for scrupulous record keeping on births marriages and deaths but in many places was more noted for the absence than the observance of the same. Roberta handed over the drawings she had made too; the preacher seemed more efficient than a lot of the law men she had seen to date bar Marshal Falk Peters, whose record had got around Phoenix fast enough – together with the ruthless handling of miscreants by his new deputies – to keep most gold hunters quiescent. Preacher Jones looked them over gravely. \"One of these is a brother of ours; another I know by sight from Mesa; the other two, the man and woman, are strangers to me\" he said \"I will organise carts to collect the bodies and give them a Christian burial; and apprise the relatives of those I know. You are a young woman of fortitude to execute such excellent sketches of the dead like this; a God-given talent.\" \"It was all I could do that was practical\" said Roberta. \"I pray that the relatives of those you do not know might be found.\" \"If it is God's will they will\" said Jones \"And if not, HE knows who that are and that is what really counts.\" Roberta decided that disagreeing was not a good idea and just smiled; though frankly she thought it a trifle fatuous when they might be the parents of a young family who would starve if not quickly found and cared for. It was probable that they were a childless couple travelling West in search of work and opportunity; and had they left small children with a waggon then surely her own party must have found sign of it. But it was the principle. She reminded herself that Preacher Jones was a good man who did not care for colour or race; and hoped that with pictures available his obvious energy would manage to get the matter resolved. Roberta belonged to the race of Martha and felt that merely being glad that God knew who the dead might be was a bit more of the style of Mary. She was now a married woman; and beamed upon her husband. \"Do we stay over here or get back on the road?\" she asked. Mortimer dithered. \"You're entitled to one night's honeymoon old man\" said Manco. \"Gellibrand won't expect miracles from Joseph; and another day won't make much difference.\" oOoOo Douglas Mortimer assisted his wife to undress. Though the desert night would drop in temperature it was still quite warm; and it was not a chill in the air that caused her to shiver. Mortimer kissed her gently on the lips. \"I wish I were taking jewellery off as well\" he said \"My mother's jewellery; which I hope may be safe where I buried it. The pearls may have rotted though\" he added sadly \"Pearls like to be handled.\" \"I don't need jewels\" said Roberta \"I need you and I like to be handled too.\" Mortimer chuckled; and ran his hands down her body. \"You do, do you?\" he said \"Well fair's fair; you must help me undress too.\" \"I thought you'd never ask\" said Roberta pulling at hie tie. The next few minutes were a trifle frenetic; and Roberta was left blushing, laughing and breathless by the time her husband was divested of clothing while he hindered her in that endeavour with kisses and caresses. \"Oh my!\" said Roberta \"It works just like in the drawings you did for me! All that for me?\" Mortimer chuckled. \"Well it sure as hell ain't for Manco\" he said. \"I swear, like Captain Jinks' horse you must feed it on corn and beans\" said Roberta, tentatively touching. Mortimer groaned and picked her up to sit her on his lap on the bed. \"I ain't about to rush this, Roberta\" he said \"I don't want to scare you….\" Roberta giggled. \"I guess I might have been a little taken aback without the instruction manual on how to keep your weapon greased that you drew\" she said. \"Roberta!\" he flushed and laughed \"It was a purely impersonal description …..\" \"Well I DO have enough of an imagination to make it a bit more personal\" said Roberta, wriggling at him. \"You talk too much, woman\" said Mortimer, kissing her to rectify that. He rolled back onto the bed, pulling her with him; and lifting her with ease to lower her down, ready to draw back at any moment that she should stiffen or show distress. Roberta assisted the operation with great enthusiasm and Mortimer decided that miraculously his wife was quite ready for anything and gave himself up to her demands. The night passed in a great deal of enjoyment; Douglas Mortimer had never realised just how demanding a wife could be and how somehow he was sufficiently obsessed with her that he could manage to be ready to live up to her demands. They rested together, Roberta lying cradled in his arms in the deep velvet desert night, stars like diamonds shining through the square of the window. \"Douglas?\" asked Roberta \"Mmm'mm?\" said Mortimer, breathing in the scent of her soft curls. \"How do married people stay awake all day if they're this busy all night?\" she wanted to know. Douglas chuckled. \"Normally after a few days of exploring each other – the purpose of a honeymoon – they are ready to settle down to a more survivable rate of lovemaking of once or twice a day for weekdays at least\" he said. \"Though I've heard it said some people manage on once a week or even once a month.\" Roberta digested this. \"Must be poor diet\" she decided. \"Douglas?\" her hands went exploring. \"What, again, woman?\" he teased, pushing her back down onto the bed. The couple finally fell asleep as the first grey light of dawn banished the stars from the sky; and when they awoke the sun was high and lying together was uncomfortably sticky. \"Ugh\" said Roberta \"It's wooden houses; adobe wouldn't get so darn hot.\" \"Practical as always\" said Douglas. \"No complaints?\" \"Yes\" said Roberta \"You haven't kissed me good morning.\" This being rectified – which led to the decision that being hot and sticky was something that could be lived with – Roberta twinkled at him. \"Of course some of the physical manifestations of being married are a trifle SHOCKING, Douglas\" she said. \"They are?\" he looked concerned. She giggled. \"Yes; you've grown a cactus on your chin overnight\" she said. He placed a smart rebuke on her backside. \"Don't worry me like that you minx!\" he said, laughing with her. \"I'll shave presently; there's water in the ewer I think.\" There was a knock at the door. Douglas pulled the sheet over both of them. \"What is it?\" he called, hoping it was not an emergency. \"Are you ready for water for a bath, Colonel?\" called Joseph who was compromising the way he addressed Mortimer here. \"Joseph, you got your wings and a halo laid out for you!\" called Mortimer. \"Do you think we could both fit in it together?\" said Roberta. \"No; and we aren't even going to try\" said Mortimer. \"They've had one flood here; another might be too much to take.\" oOoOo When they emerged and met up with the others, Manco gave Mortimer a look of respect and a nod. Mortimer reflected that the wooden walls in the house that had been turned over to their use had been quite thin, and went a dull red; and hoped that the thought would not occur to Roberta. Fortunately she was enough of an innocent not to think about the sounds of enthusiastic lovemaking carrying; and probably did not recall how vocal she had been. He gave a rueful grin. Well they were married so it was quite legitimate! He took refuge in filling his pipe carefully for a morning….. well, afternoon…smoke. They would be on their way after eating; and then Roberta might go back to her boy's clothes if she chose. And when they had Gamalial Gellibrand proven a crook she should dress in silks and velvets if she chose or pants if she preferred.[Chapter 24] Chapter 24 Roberta was glad to get back to the comfort of male attire; and besides the tight trousers showed off her legs rather nicely and Douglas had professed an admiration of them more than once during the night. She blushed fierily just thinking about it; and caught his eye. It was too eloquent an exchange of looks to be permitted if there were others present! \"You two want to watch the way you look\" said Manco. \"It is a little obvious\" said Joseph. \"It's romantic\" said Amaryllis. \"Well, I guess we'd better hope to get a lot of the looking out of our systems while there's only you bunch of rapscallions who know our guilty secret around\" said Mortimer. \"Old man, if I'd had any idea you were that spruce I'd have suggested a three day honeymoon instead of one night in the hopes of exhausting you both\" said Manco dryly. \"Well we ain't like to meet nobody except prospectors and bandits out here and the one'll be looking mostly at the ground and t'other will be gazin' into the unromantic eyes of our six shooters.\" Once they were on the trail the rather spooky silhouette of the Superstition Mountains could be seen, away to the east and blue and insubstantial in the haze. The closer they came the more obvious it was that its sheer cliffs and deep gorges were not for the fainthearted; it appeared to have been cloven as though, said Roberta, by a giant having a tantrum with a felling axe. \"Not hardly surprising the mine ain't been found by anyone else\" said Manco. \"Reckon it'd take you a day to go four-five miles on what look flat on the map, never mind looking for anything as well.\" \"Which is why we're not going to bother\" said Mortimer \"We're going close enough for Joseph to have a look so he can make some kind of description to be convincing; to, er, add verisimilitude to a bald and unconvincing narrative.\" \"Best description is downright spooky\" said Joseph \"That was a quote, Doug; what's it from? It ain't Shakespeare.\" \"Gilbert and Sullivan – English writers of operetta\" said Mortimer. oOoOo There was a small settlement at the end of the valley called Gold Valley; where indeed a large scale war appeared to be taking place while the few locals hid. \"Way I see it we have two choices\" said Manco, spitting out the end of his cigar \"We can go in there and stop them fighting and arrest 'em all; or we can let them do our job for us by killing off a sufficient proportion to make it easier for us.\" \"We don't know if either side has any right to them\" said Roberta. \"Pardon me Mrs Mortimer\" said Manco \"But when half of each side have their holsters tied, likelihood is there ain't a lot of right on either side.\" \"A point\" said Roberta \"Why did I stop being Bobby by the way?\" Manco grinned. \"Because it made you jump, kid, to get called by your married name.\" oOoOo Watching the battle it became more obvious that the two groups were indeed opportunist bravos not genuine miners; and then Roberta spotted and pointed out the man tied to the post. This was the point at which the posse rode into the village, stopping to cut the man down and assist him to the nearest adobe shack. He had been badly beaten. \"Amaryllis, care for him\" said Roberta \"I don't care for people who beat on old men.\" The man was lined with years, and what proportion of his heritage might be Mexican and how much Indian Roberta did not care to guess; but he was in a parlous state and the woman of the house where they had taken him came forward to give him aid. The three gunfighters clinked out onto the dirt road while Joseph took charge of the horses; as he said, give him a rifle and he was as good as any man, but he had never used a six shooter. One of the men of one of the entrenched groups of bravos had noticed that there were more protagonists in the battle; and that the captive was gone. He yelled, \"HEY! TRUCE! GET THESE NEWCOMERS; THEY HAVE OUR SOURCE!\" \"Recognise any faces Bobby?\" asked Manco. \"I make it a total of pushing twenty thousand\" said Roberta, interpreting that question liberally. \"Me too\" said Manco. \"Ain't you going to earn it then?\" said Mortimer, starting to clinically take down the advancing bravos at extreme range. \"Well ma'am you sure put some pep into him\" said Manco as he and Roberta joined in the gun fight. It was a short, ugly battle; the two rival groups were as wary of each other as of the newcomers and were, thought Roberta, surprisingly bad shots. She supposed it was probably something to do with the criminal mindset that wanted quick returns for little expenditure of effort; that they did not practice, on the whole, every day. Mortimer and Manco dropped every man they shot at; Manco cursed to be winged on the cheekbone and if anything increased his rate of fire. And the three bounty hunters fired at a range that was beyond that of most gunfighters; and fired accurately at that. Roberta fired more slowly than the other two; but made every shot tell. The loud CLANG behind them as they mopped up the last of the resistance made Roberta swing round; to see that Joseph had cheerfully plied a bucket and had felled a man who had crept round behind them. \"Excellent Joseph; a prisoner!\" she said gaily. Joseph grinned and proceeded to tie his prisoner up. oOoOo \"So what did those miscreants want of you, grandfather?\" asked Roberta now the poor old man had been cleaned up, given water, and looked a lot better. \"I'm part Goshute young one\" said the old man \"Brought up a slave to Apaches. Well I was just a boy – younger than you – when my master and his son happened on a man with bags full of gold. They attacked him; but he had a partner, who shot them with a rifle. Me, I rolled behind rocks; they never saw me, the two white men. I watched them for days; not out of any desire for revenge, I was glad enough to see my master die. I watched how they dug out the gold, and hid the mine; and how the one who had saved me from slavery and his partner from certain death was gunned down in cold blood by that very partner. And then he went away. I know now his name was Jacob Walz and that he's dead and that other people want to know where his mine is.\" \"And how did they come to think that you knew?\" asked Roberta. \"Because I wanted to serve him a bad turn; and when this village took me in – they're mostly Hopi – I brought down gold to help out. And to buy my way to not being enslaved by them. Not a lot o' gold; just enough to make a difference. We don't need much; we don't have to be greedy. But someone I sold ore to talked about it I suppose. I suppose you want to know where it is?\" Roberta shrugged. \"To be honest we don't really care that much; we're supposed to be helping a marshal stop brigands making a blood bath of the area. Looks like our job got done for us by some of the precious villains on our list. We can go back to Phoenix now.\" The old man looked around the newcomers and laughed. \"Well I never did see so many honest men in one room before\" he said \"Untouched with the lust of gold. YOU\" he pointed to Manco \"You want to know; but you ain't greedy.\" \"Curious, old man\" said Manco \"Curious what all the fuss is over.\" \"It's a hole in the ground\" said the elderly Indian. \"A hole in the ground with a bit of gold in it; nothin' more, nothing less. I won't live many years more; when I die the last one who knows where it is will be gone. Then the trouble will be gone. I ain't showin' you.\" Manco shrugged. \"Your right\" he said. If he was disappointed at all he did not show it; indeed his eyes held admiration for the old man's integrity. \"Are there any others in the mountains looking for it?\" asked Mortimer. \"Yup\" said the old man \"Mostly harmless fools. They won't find it though. It ain't where any successful and sensible prospector would think o' lookin'. I ain't goin' out there again; ain't worth it. Let the secret die; let the story die.\" \"It won't\" said Manco cynically \"It'll grow with the telling.\" \"But it won't have no fuel\" said the elderly Indian. \"And we'll spread the word that the last man who knows died along o' these murdering bastards killing him\" said Mortimer. \"Hopefully you won't have any more trouble.\" \"My thanks\" said the old one. oOoOo The prisoner swore a lot. \"I don't like your language in front of a lady\" said Manco. \"There ain't no ladies here\" said the prisoner sullenly \"Just a black piece o' tail….\" He broke off with a yelp as Manco hit him on the mouth. \"I still don't like the way you talk in front of the lady\" he said. \"I'm used to it, Mr Manco\" said Amaryllis. \"Well you didn't ought to be\" said Manco. \"We need his head to display for the bounty; we don't need nothin' else. If he's wise he won't talk his head off like that.\" \"I should however like him to talk about his associates, whether there are any more of them, their adversaries and any possible allies they might have\" said Mortimer. \"Well, let's get out of town and I'll build a nice fire to put his feet into\" said Manco. The prisoner started talking about relevant matters very quickly. They had wiped out two whole gangs of opportunistic ne'er do wells; who eked out a living as sometime gunslingers, the odd bit of bounty hunting, especially of Indians, banditry, gambling and the occasional kidnap on the side, of attractive Indian girls to sell to brothels. His gang had affiliated over the lure of gold more by default than any ties of friendship or kinship, to oppose the Marston cousins, who they had been fighting and who had been first to have the idea of torturing the old Goshute. The prisoner's only regret seemed to be not having got to him first. At this point he diverged from telling the list of his crimes by way of a boast to suggest that if the old man's feet were placed in the fire, they might all of them split with more money than they could possibly imagine. \"I doubt that, you second rate punk\" said Manco \"I could imagine quite a lot. But I like mine clean.\" \"Doesn't trying to bribe a Marshal or his assistants carry a mandatory death penalty?\" said Roberta brightly. \"We could string him up now and save the county the cost of the rope by using his own belt.\" \"Your Marshal won't want me dead! I can testify that a Mr Fellowes who works for a fellow out East wants the mine to launder money from smuggling!\" said the prisoner. \"Yeah? What's this fellow from the east's name then?\" said Manco sounding sceptical. \"I dunno; I forgot. Sumpin' like preserves\" said the man. \"Could it be Gellibrand?\" asked Roberta. \"Yeah, could be\" said the prisoner. Mortimer grunted. \"Leading question, Snakekiller. And he ain't that certain of it that that'll stick. Well to get Fellowes he's worth keeping alive; but if he makes trouble he don't have to be undamaged. I'd be careful if I was you, punk; Snakekiller here shoots snakes and practising on your pinkies won't upset him any.\" \"I'd have to take his boots off though\" said Roberta \"Or I might take more than one toe at a time; and that would be just too bad for my reputation.\" Terrorising people without any intention of harming them was good fun; and the man's terror was a little bit of payback for the poor old man they had been willing to torture for real.[Chapter 25] Chapter 25 The dead bodies had been tied to hastily constructed travois; the horses of the bandits would help to take them back to Phoenix. The horses would fetch a reasonable sum in addition to the bounties; and Roberta and Mortimer would of course pool their shares to help build up his house and lands when he had possession of them again. There would be a lot to do. \"I want to dress you in silk, Roberta\" he said \"But I don't know if there'll be enough over.\" \"Well wasn't your mother the best dressed woman in the district even when she was so ill?\" said Roberta \"I don't much like sewing but if you will buy me a sewing machine it will be an investment and you can use that to employ a girl to help Amaryllis and me to dress ourselves by using over fabrics. I wager they're all laid away in lavender and mothballs in the loft and Gellibrand never got his fat body up there.\" \"Well, I have to say I never thought of that\" said Mortimer \"If you didn't mind….\" \"I'm woman enough to be itching to get amongst those chests of old clothes\" said Roberta happily. \"Anyway, it takes me into a daydream well away from our accompanying disciples of flies who are more than fond of our cargo. Shall we pass south of the mesa to avoid shocking the good people of Lehi either with out bodies or er…\" \"Or your body?\" laughed Mortimer. \"It might be as well.\" \"Douglas\" said Roberta \"I was just thinking. I wondered if I should go back to skirts; you know, so I can be your wife properly. And live with you.\" \"Roberta, I should like that; but I do worry for your safety.\" Roberta chuckled. \"Well I think that anyone who tried to attack me would be in for a shock, don't you? I learned enough dirty fighting techniques off you and Manco, and they certainly won't expect me to plug them with a Buntline Special.\" \"There is that\" he conceded. \"You could have your gowns made with special pockets and furbelows to conceal it.\" \"Douglas, not across my belly! Haven't you SEEN Godey's Ladies book recently?\" \"Can't say I ever have\" said Mortimer. \"Well I know that wearing a gun is a sartorial solecism but that goes for men too.\" \"The fronts of skirts are tight and pull back, even though the bustle is disappearing\" said Roberta \"It would show. I might go for a divided skirt out here though – admit my sex but also carry a gun openly. I'll have to go for a shorter gun with the holster tied to the thigh and a slit in the skirt to get to it if I want to wear proper skirts.\" \"Whatever you wear, my dear, you will be beautiful\" said Mortimer warmly. oOoOo Back in Phoenix the bodies were turned over to the Marshal, together with a report; and he was glad to have a prisoner to question. They returned to the hotel where they had retained rooms, with Roberta smuggled in; and Mortimer gave some money to Amaryllis to purchase some ready-made clothing to be going on with for Roberta. Amaryllis returned with several purchases. \"Sho' honey, we can do a lot with this lot\" she said cheerfully \"Way I done figure it, yo' want to be feminine but be able to move; well, seems to me, yo' still young enough to have yo' skirt no longer than mid calf and nothin' t'stop yo' wearin' yo' riding boots to meet the bottom of the skirt. So long as we make sho' it's longer than a bar girl's skirt yo' be jes' fine, Miss Berta, honey. And this one done be so wide, sho' I though it might make into a divided skirt and be longer but still jes' so easy; and with an apron over, why, Miss Berta, yo' look jes' as 'spectable as any po-faced ol' besom if yo' need to.\" Roberta laughed and embraced Amaryllis. \"You're a darling, Amaryllis!\" she said \"And I wish you will stop calling me MISS Berta; after all, if you want to add any qualification to my name, it should be AUNT if Douglas acknowledges your mother as his sister.\" \"Land sakes!\" said Amaryllis \"That is jes' downright foolishness!\" \"Well I can't say I feel much like an aunt\" said Roberta. \"Now let's get me dressed; Douglas is busy hiring a single room for you so that he and I can take over this one as a married couple, now he's told the proprietor that his brother in law has taken him to his bride.\" \"Won't he notice how alike yo' are to Snakekiller Bobby?\" asked Amaryllis, who was plying a rapid needle taking up the skirt of one of the secondhand costumes by the expedient of turning the extra length into a flounce to make it hang better as well; and which could, as she did not need to point out to Roberta, be rapidly let down at need. When they went East for example. \"The reason for declaring him my brother\" said Roberta. \"And we say, yes, we are very alike as befits twins but Bobby's hair is darker. It doesn't have to be as we won't be seen together; and if I wear my hair brushed forward in bangs for as long as I can bear having it on my forehead until people are used to me being me, and a big ribbon to simulate hair tied up, you'll be surprised what a difference it'll make; especially if I'm careful to wear only bonnets or a little frivolous sun hat not a wide hat such as I have been.\" \"Oh yo' will look so lovely in this blue linen suit!\" said Amaryllis \"Blue match yo' eyes so well; and oh! I does weep fo' yo' lovely hair that yo' have cut. But don' worry, honey; Amaryllis will make it look as pretty as if yo' never done cut it!\" Once Roberta was dressed in female attire, her slender waist emphasised by a wide waistband of the cornflower blue skirt, and froths of lace on the white cotton waist above it, and the wasp-waisted tailored jacket with navy velvet lapels she was every inch a woman and not sufficiently like Snakekiller Bobby to arouse more than a comment that there was a family resemblance. Amaryllis teased her honey coloured curls into little ringlets of whispy bangs and tied a navy blue chiffon scarf into a big bow which she ruthlessly pinned to the back of Roberta's head with hair pins. Roberta gazed into the rather fly-blown mirror. \"Not bad\" she said. \"You guessed my size pretty well.\" \"Sho' M- er, Berta, and me havin' dressed yo' from when we wus both li'l girls!\" said Amaryllis in satisfaction \"Same as yo' knowin' how far yo' target is when yo' is shootin'.\" \"I hadn't thought of it that way\" said Roberta. \"It's comforting though that even without a corset on I have a narrower waist than the previous owner.\" \"Yo' is jes beautiful\" sighed Amaryllis in satisfaction. \"We are going to be a most fetching pair\" said Roberta cheerfully. \"Amaryllis, is Joseph Douglas' half brother?\" \"Sho' honey I does not know\" said Amaryllis. \"And I ain't never axed him neither.\" \"Oh well, I shall\" said Roberta. \"I'd like to know if he's my brother-in-law or a family friend; etiquette and all that bothersome stuff.\" oOoOo Tripping into the small lounge bar where the men were, Roberta was rewarded by the gasp of appreciation from her husband. She went over to him. \"I suppose that even out west, it would be improper to sit on your knee, Douglas?\" she said. \"Vastly, Mrs Mortimer\" said Mortimer pulling her onto his knee. \"Well I knew my wife was a lovely woman but these new kickshaws set you off admirably.\" \"Yo' wait 'til we see her in silks and satins, Uncle Douglas\" said Amaryllis, still a little shy of using the family appellation. \"Indeed!\" said Mortimer \"I'll need to keep my guns about me when all the other fellows flock round! Manco, I'll have to call on your services!\" Manco grinned. \"Well old man, if you thought I was going to pass up the chance of seeing you being a fine gentleman and Mrs Mortimer seeing off the Ku Klux Klan with tea, cake and a Buntline you can think again\" he said. \"Actually considering my cooking skills, rock cakes might indeed prove offensive weapons\" said Roberta. \"Douglas, are you and Joseph brothers?\" The men exchanged looks. \"We ain't never discussed it\" said Joseph \"It was one of them things that was tacitly left alone.\" \"But more than likely\" said Mortimer. Roberta studied them critically. \"You both have those almond shaped eyes that can't be so common\" she said \"Like Amaryllis. Well, that makes you my brother too; so you count as a chaperone if need be.\" \"I hadn't got as far as thinking about that level of propriety\" said Douglas. \"Well one of us has to\" said Roberta sweetly. \"I take it that we're kicking our heels in town while our brother wires to the Lard Ball that he's having trouble getting payment on a shipment and that he's found the general location of the Lost Dutchman Mine and as nobody else has found it he can claim that he has?\" \"More or less\" Joseph answered \"I need to pick up the shipment first; it'll be through soon. Mr Gellibrand has friends in the US Army who get him the weapons. Dis ol' negr' done make it good by'n'by.\" \"Better and better\" said Douglas \"THAT's treason. Peters will be pleased – well not pleased, but needs to know – that. Wire him about the mine, tell him that a Marshal has clamped down on people searching so that if you say you found it already he knows it's not likely to be really discovered. Actually you don't need to wire that; the Mail should get it there within a few days and then Amaryllis can write that she's writing on your behalf. So when he gets a wire it won't seem so odd.\" \"We have to kick our heels for as much as a couple of weeks then?\" said Roberta, dismayed. \"Well, my darling, I don't know about you but I can think of a few things to fill in time\" said Mortimer. Roberta went scarlet and grinned at him adoringly. \"I guess\" she said shyly \"The timing could not have been a lot better\". \"What I thought\" said Mortimer.[Chapter 26] Chapter 26 Colonel and Mrs Mortimer were not in to callers for several days; Amaryllis amused herself by exploring Phoenix to find out where there might be a haberdasher to purchase ribbons and lace for the purpose of, as she explained to Manco who volunteered to escort her, redding up Roberta's hastily purchased female clothes. \"Doubt she's wearing much right now\" said Manco. \"No, Mr Manco, and the better for me to get ma hands on her clo'es for to make them pretty\" said Amaryllis. Manco laughed. \"You're going to be a fairly wealthy woman if the Colonel's acknowledging you as his niece\" he said \"You don't have to act the maid to Bobby.\" \"No Mr Manco I do not; it's ma pleasure to do so\" said Amaryllis firmly. \"Ain't I allus looked out for her? Helpin' her 'scape from the house when that pa o' hers is in one o' his bad moods; sho' that po' girl done had more whippings from that brute than any o' Mr Mortimer senior's slaves ever did; 'Berta's pa and that Gellibrand, what's his friend, they done be of the same stamp. Missus Everard, he done broke her spirit though she done take it out on ev'one else. Mr Manco, I'm going to buy some pink ribbons for ma Sunday black sho' I am!\" \"You do that Miss Amaryllis\" said Manco. \"I wonder how Mr Everard is going to take the news that his daughter is married?\" \"You know what, Mr Manco? I don' care because he can't do nuthin 'bout it\" said Amaryllis \"And when the Colonel come into his own again, sho' the old bugger will grind his teeth and smile acoss the Colonel will be the richest man in the neighbourhood. And he'll be mighty afraid of him too\" she added in satisfaction. oOoOo \"Did we ought to get up for more than just the odd meal, Douglas?\" asked Roberta. \"Why, was there anything else you wanted to do?\" asked Mortimer, running a caressing hand down her body. Roberta shivered in pleasure. \"No, but I was wondering if we were being rude to the others.\" \"Manco don't care, Joseph has my interests at heart and Amaryllis has your interests at heart and they'd be upset if we didn't take advantage of the delay\" said Mortimer. \"I'm an old man, Roberta and I need to take things slowly and savour them.\" Roberta chuckled at him. \"You're a fraud, Douglas\" she said \"You're younger than a man half your age; whatever that actually is.\" Mortimer laughed. \"You really truly don't care, do you, my darling?\" he said. \"Well I'm on the shady side of forty by a few years…. Nearer the fifty end than the forty.\" \"You must be very good to have been a colonel so young\" said Roberta. \"There were a few of us who were colonels young; those of us who were survivors\" said Mortimer. \"Besides I lied about my age to join up. I was a veteran by the time I was your age my dear. Let's not talk about that; it was a very messy time. Let's move forward.\" \"Yes indeed\" agreed Roberta \"Are you going to shoot my father if he objects to me being married to you?\" \"It wasn't on my agenda\" said Mortimer. \"Oh? Pity\" said Roberta. \"Your father can go to hell\" said Mortimer. \"I don't want thoughts of him in bed with me. Come here, woman!\" Roberta giggled and came there. It seemed like a very good idea… oOoOo The couple did get up the next day because, as Mortimer said, one could have too much of a good thing and sometimes a change was as good as a rest so they would spend a few days just looking around. And besides, they needed some target practice so they did not grow soft. Roberta was happy to do anything her husband suggested; and as she said, some things were so very special that it was perhaps best to keep them special because you could not live on cake all the time however marvellous it might be. A couple of slices a day would do just fine she added grinning. Her husband kissed her and spanked her gently. Wearing her cornflower blue suit, suitably trimmed by Amaryllis with a ruching of navy satin ribbon along the top of the flounce that shortened it to show some four inches of leg above Roberta's ankle and a navy straw bonnet trimmed with more ribbon by the indefatigable Amaryllis, Roberta knew that she looked very well indeed and in no wise appeared shabby next to her husband's well cut and expensive suits. Amaryllis had furbished up all her clothes with a touch of eastern modishness and the aid of the latest Godey's Lady's Magazine that she had been able to get her hands on. The woman in fairly fine and moderately fashionable clothes who came up to the couple and said 'excuse me' also had a touch of eastern style about her. Mortimer raised his hat. \"Ma'am\" he said, neutrally. The stranger smiled brightly; she was an attractive woman with shining chestnut hair caught back in a knot under a flowered straw hat. \"I do hope you'll forgive me for accosting you; but there are so few respectable women out here who are anything but miners wives or pioneer women; so I thought, perhaps that nice looking girl and her… husband…..will be kind enough to help me.\" Her eyes had flicked to Roberta's finger where she wore the plain gold band Mortimer had purchased along with the wedding certificate. As Douglas Mortimer was a stickler in public there was nothing of the lover to betray their married status, other than the courtesy he displayed, that Roberta had to admit he would show any woman he walked with. His eyes rested on her warmly but if it was a guess on the part of this stranger it was a fortuitous one. \"And in what way do you need help?\" asked Roberta. \"Perhaps you wouldn't mind coming into the hotel where I am staying so I might explain\" said the woman. \"I prefer not to speak in so public a place.\" Roberta glanced at Douglas, who gave a brief, almost imperceptible nod and a small gesture that suggested being careful. \"Very well\" said Roberta. They followed the woman into a respectable looking hotel; she led them to a sofa in the lobby area, away from the youth on reception. This area had a number of potted plants in it so seem more homely. The plants looked in need of care. \"My name is Jacqueline Walz\" she said. \"I expect you know the surname; it's the name of my grandfather.\" \"It's a little hard not to have heard of Jacob Walz around here\" said Mortimer, getting out his pipe. Jacqueline Walz smiled. \"Quite so\" she said. \"However, most of the people who have heard of my grandfather and his mine are opportunists hoping to find it and make a killing. They won't\" she added \"It's far too well hidden. But my inheritance was the deed to it and the map. I own the mine legally.\" \"Indeed?\" Mortimer sounded polite as he filled his pipe with care. \"Yes; and theoretically I'm a rich woman\" she gave a brittle laugh \"But there's a couple of small problems.\" \"Quite a number of small and not so small problems actually I'd say\" said Mortimer. Miss Walz smiled a thin smile. \"Indeed\" she said. \"Once I can exploit the mine my troubles are solved. But in order to exploit it I have to have working capital for both miners and for guards to guard it when it is discovered that it is working again. I am looking for a partner to invest – oh for a half share in all the profits from the mine, or at repayment with interest. I found a lawyer who understands how these things work but he couldn't find me an investor…..what?\" Mortimer had put down his pipe and was giving a slow hand clap. \"Very pretty ma'am\" he said \"One of the best attempts to scam me I've ever seen. And if I was in a hurry I'd not make a song and dance over it, but since I'm in no hurry, and since I AM carrying a deputy marshal's star, I'm afraid I'm going to have to ask you to accompany me to the hoosegow.\" \"The hell I will!\" she jumped up \"Arnie! stop him!\" A thin man dressed like a lawyer appeared from where he had been loitering behind a rather sad looking potted plant, pulling a gun. Mortimer's gun barked once and the man called Arnie yowled in pain as the gun was shot from his hand. Roberta dived on the counterfeit Jacqueline Walz and brought her to the ground with a tackle to the knees. Mortimer grinned. \"And not what she'd have expected from a demure lady like yourself my dear\" he said, grabbing and manhandling the man. Roberta patted the woman down ruthlessly and took the derringer from her waistband where it nestled in a concealed pouch in the small of her back; and they took their prisoners away. The receptionist looked rather pale when he emerged from under his desk; but otherwise a single gunshot did not seem to have elicited much more response than a few doors being opened to see what was happening, and being closed again once it was clear that the show was over. Frontier towns had the odd touch of excitement like that. oOoOo The lawman on duty was taken aback to have a couple of criminals, one of them a pretty woman, brought in by an immaculately clad gentleman and an obvious lady; but was all ears when Mortimer flashed his badge at him. Mortimer wrote out a report in his beautiful copper plate and Roberta dictated a statement and signed it, beaming at the lawman and telling him that apart from at their wedding this was the first time she had signed her married name. \"Purty lady like you must find it hard bein' a dep'ty's wife\" said the lawman. Roberta beamed. \"Oh Douglas manages to find me a bit of excitement in the pursuance of his duty\" she said. \"Have you a clothes brush? I have dust on my skirt.\"[Chapter 27] Chapter 27 \"Douglas\" said Roberta \"I could tell she was lying from the way she kept firmly looking me in the eye while her mouth's smile didn't reach her eyes and her hands said different things to her mouth. But what I don't understand is why was she lying?\" \"Because she wanted us to give her money\" said Mortimer. \"As an investment in the mine; it would make a mint if it hasn't been worked out. Knowing where it is surely is half the battle?\" said Roberta. \"Innocent babe!\" teased Mortimer \"She has less idea of where it is than we do; she wanted the money. Once we'd invested and had a nice gilt-edged contract drawn up by her friend the counterfeit lawyer, do you think they'd hang around for us to find that the contract was worth zippo? She might have tried it on a few people before she quit town, but quit town she would have done – with the investment dollars of those who thought they were onto a good thing.\" \"But that's worse than just STEALING!\" said Roberta, shocked \"She was ready to lie and shake hands on the deal! And have PAPERWORK about it!\" Mortimer laughed. \"After gaining our confidence; that is why such is called a confidence trick\" he explained. \"The simplest form is to ask a mark to hold and administer a large charitable fund but as a sign of confidence they must put some sum of money up themselves that will be returned once their bona fides is established. This was a neat twist in utilising the old Dutchman. In my book it's akin to cheating at a card or dice game. But there is some more sympathy to be had with such characters; because only the greedy who hoped to take advantage of a lonely woman's predicament were likely to be caught out. But it had to be stopped\" he added. \"I can see I still have much to learn about the seamier side of life\" said Roberta sadly. \"Never mind, my dear; better to learn by explanation than from experience\" said Mortimer. \"This is quite a new crime; it relies on people wanting to get something for doing very little; and on people being unwilling to look like untrusting misers. The first instance of it – a very crude version – was back in 1840's when a man called Thomson asked gentlemen with whom he had pretended an acquaintance if they had the confidence in him to take care of their watches. Naturally their confidence turned out to be misplaced; because what he did was unthinkable for a gentleman. This was in New York.\" \"Oh New York!\" said Roberta \"I did hear that you have to be careful leaving New York not to look back in case you get turned into a pillar of salt!\" Mortimer laughed. \"I don't believe it is quite as bad as the Cities of the Plains but any big city will attract vice and criminals; look at El Paso! I'm sure we should have met with con artists – as they are commonly known – had we stayed there much longer. We obviously look eminently respectable.\" \"You look quite delicious, Douglas\" said Roberta. \"Do you know, I think we should return to the hotel and explore that concept\" said Mortimer \"Besides, your linen suit has taken quite a wrinkling from grabbing that wretched woman. It's the one drawback of linen.\" Roberta sighed. \"Yes; I believe I should stick to calico and cotton challis\" she said. \"They wear better than finer cottons…..Douglas, I must be being very stupid today, I just realised why you suggested going back to the hotel! And I concur utterly!\" she added, flushing prettily. oOoOo It was early evening before the Mortimers sallied out again; and Roberta looked very crisp in a pale pink chambray waist and the navy divided skirt that Amaryllis had completed, there being enough fabric in an extensive and now unfashionable bustle – though plenty of women in the town were still wearing them – that Amaryllis had been able to piece a jacket with three quarter sleeves to complete the taille of the suit over the waist. Trimmed with pink ribbons, and a pink chiffon scarf tied about the navy straw made it a chic enough ensemble for Roberta to be both satisfied with her appearance and glad that Amaryllis was clever enough to make it a lot more easy to move in than it looked. A pink-trimmed apron garniture hid any signs of the division of the skirt and provided a clever pocket to permit Roberta to wear her buntline under the frou-frous. There had been a LOT of material in the bustle. oOoOo The whole group had sallied out to eat in the nearest approximation to a restaurant offered in the town; it served drinks at a bar as well as having an eating area, and offered a dance floor with pianist for those who wanted a little social contact. It was, even so, not a place where men checked their guns before entering. The moderately competent looking man in a sharp suit whose holster was attached to his thigh with a fancy tooled strap eyed up Roberta with interest. He moved over to their table. He was about thirty; and he wore some kind of scented pomade to slick down his hair. \"I could give you a better time than the old man, sweetheart\" he said. \"Are you addressing me?\" asked Roberta. \"Oh excellent; plummy eastern voice too. But you're far too pretty to be respectable\" said the man. \"You hang out with professionals; one rather scabrous looking and one past his best. I'm a pro and I could give you a good time and dress you in silks too.\" \"You haven't got a clue, have you?\" said Roberta, deciding to treat it with an air of amusement. \"My husband and his friend are many times more competent than you; because you haven't noticed my wedding band; or that my husband wears his Buntline in the way only top professionals do; nor have you recognised him and the man with no name which means you're a Johnny-come-lately. You also have a pretty odd idea of fashion if you think that any woman would be fool enough to wear silk in a climate like this where it's going to mark easily with perspiration, stick to her uncomfortably and look very sad very quickly. It's also not hard wearing. Why I daresay if it came to a contest I could outshoot you too; you poor apology for a half-baked bounty hunter, you look the part but you're all squeak and no trousers.\" \"Couldn't have put it better myself Mrs Mortimer\" said Manco. \"I suggest sonny that you get the hell out of here or I'll knock your teeth through the back of your neck for casting aspersions on my wife\" said Mortimer. \"Bring it on, old man\" said the stranger, an ugly look in his eye \"And when I've finished with you, your – wife – gets to belong to me as the spoils of victory.\" Douglas Mortimer unwound his long body and yawned in the stranger's face; but was ready to block the angry blow aimed at him. His own blow was a fast jab to the jaw that caused his opponent to lose all further interest in the proceedings. Douglas signalled for a waiter; he got immediate service. \"Waiter, I'd be obliged if someone carried out the garbage\" he said pleasantly, passing a folded bill. \"Yessir!\" said the waiter, beckoning another of his kind to collect the now groaning semi-conscious body to propel faster out of the door than he had come in. \"And I wanted to humiliate him by being a better shot\" said Roberta. \"Very likely my dear; but you see, a man is not going to stand by and let that bastard call his wife a whore, however obliquely put, as he did\" said Mortimer. \"I DID understand his inference correctly then!\" said Roberta \"I am glad you hurt him, Douglas.\" A brawl was apparently no reason for the pianist to stop playing; and Mortimer suggested a turn about the dance floor while they waited for their meal. Roberta was delighted. \"Now I can show off some of the things I had well drummed into me in that fancy school\" she said. \"I only hope I can keep up\" Mortimer's eyes twinkled. \"But they do say that a Southern Gentleman is born knowing how to dance, ride and shoot Yankees.\" oOoOo After an enjoyable evening Mortimer warned them to be careful on leaving in case the other bounty hunter was still around looking for trouble; and indeed his warning was justified. The man was waiting outside. \"You and me, old man!\" he shouted \"Your gun against mine!\" Mortimer eyed him with dislike. \"As you choose, you young fool\" he said. \"Excuse me while I put some distance between us; whatever you have on your hair smells of the whorehouse you presumably live in.\" The other man started to pull his gun while Mortimer was still walking away; but evidently thought better of it hearing Manco's gun cock on a faster draw. Roberta did not bother to cock hers but kept it loosened and ready. She knew better than to interfere in a fight but if this fellow even wounded her Douglas, he was going to die, she vowed. She did not really feel any concern; the best shot in the Carolinas was not about to have any difficulty. And Mortimer turned; saw his opponent was already half drawn and sneered as he went for his own gun. The stranger's shot was wild, but still good enough to carry Mortimer's hat off; because he had the edge of having started to draw before his opponent was ready. He did not see his near success however since his heart was stopped by Mortimer's bullet and he was dead before he even started to crumple and fall. \"The difference between self-assurance and stupid cockiness\" said Mortimer. \"I thought you were like that at first, boy; but you had the skills to back it up.\" \"I don't recall I ever insulted women or got into fights over them though\" said Manco eyeing the dead bounty hunter with distaste. \"A man doesn't have to be an idiot as well as cocky.\" \"Nope\" said Mortimer. \"You never were an idiot. And when we tangled it was because of both wanting the same bounty. That's different.\" \"Yup\" agreed Manco spitting out a cigar stub. \"Well that's the floor show over for the night; might as well go home.\"[Chapter 28] Chapter 28 It might have been tedious kicking their heels had not Douglas and Roberta been so besotted of each other that all days held something of a roseate hue; Manco had the capacity for patience, as did Joseph and Amaryllis was content to occupy her days reading such fashion magazines as she might – especially when she discovered that she might order them from out east – and purchasing fabric and second hand clothing to make up and make over for herself and Roberta on the generous allowance Mortimer was making her. Once he discovered that she was buying fabrics and trims for the both of them he gave her a wad of notes and told her to play with that. Amaryllis was quite content to stay in Phoenix as long as was necessary! Roberta loved to look around the town looking innocent and respectable with her husband and seeing the difference it made to how she was treated to the way a young gunslinger was treated. \"And an irony\" she said \"That I am given more respect in some ways and less in others; I am treated with courtesy as a lady but not expected to actually be able to DO anything.\" \"And you'll be given more respect in that way out here in the West than back East\" said Douglas, taking his pipe out of his mouth to wave it for emphasis. \"I was a babe when a ship sank – it was in England, I think on the Thames – and all the men and boys were saved and all the women and girls drowned. It wasn't just their skirts; they literally didn't have the strength to hold onto ropes to save their lives, and women in America were, and often are even today, no different. Women and girls are often encouraged to be useless ornaments. Now in the war, women and girls did a lot to help their menfolk; but real ladies are still coddled rather. Well, you know how tough you found my training of you; and you were no shrinking violet to have come in search of me in the first place. America is a land of paradoxes, my love; we praise the strength of the pioneer woman whilst holding up delicate beauties on a pedestal. And that's another paradox; American manhood puts American womanhood on a pedestal – and then can't resist peering up her skirts. There's a lot of whores around who are exploited because nice girls are too revered and aren't expected to enjoy the physical side of marriage.\" \"Poor things\" said Roberta \"I enjoy the physical side of marriage a very great deal.\" He grinned. \"Funnily enough I'd noticed\" he said. They were watching the spectacle of a harassed – and it must be said, rather officious – Claims Officer trying to deal with half a dozen miners and their assorted families who were not ready to take any excess officialdom from him. It was, as Mortimer said cheerfully, none of their business and one might as well just enjoy the show as the government representative's voice grew shriller and more desperate while the miners told him where he might get off. They were genuine miners looking to stake proper claims, not go searching for legendary mines and as such quite entitled to do so. What fascinated Roberta was the way people came and went; this was definitely a town of transient populations alongside its permanent population, most of whom were employed in such jobs as served the more transient members. The satisfaction of such requirements as liquor, food, women and gambling – not necessarily in that order – were obvious; and stores of supplies for those heading for mining camps or heading further West or to stake claims; saddlery shops, haberdashers and hardware stores to replace essentials; and a large number of laundries, mostly run by those of Chinese extraction, who seemed to live largely in their own part of the town in Montezuma street and around it; all the servants in the hotel were Chinese who seemed to occupy the lower status jobs in the town, as labourers, servants and miners. However the restaurateurs seemed to be largely Chinese too, and a significant number of those who brought vegetables into the town for sale. Apparently the population was unpopular with many other residents of Phoenix; Roberta heard a number of complaints about laundries supposedly operating without a licence and grumbles that the Chinese had a monopoly on laundries, restaurants and market gardening; her comment was that if they had the industry to found businesses, other people should get off their backsides and do likewise rather than moaning. Roberta, being Roberta, had discovered that the maid who cleaned their rooms was known as Rose Yee and that in her own language would be Yee Méi because Chinese surnames came first; that Ah was a diminutive often given as a name to children or servants and that Sam was sir; so that Ah Sam who owned a laundry was Little Sir so far as Roberta could judge. Rose – she preferred to be given an American name than be mispronounced – had grown up in America, one of a mere handful of Chinese women. She told Roberta that there were moves afoot to move Chinatown somewhere where it would offend rich white businessmen less. Roberta sighed; it was going to happen. What businessmen wanted generally came to pass; really she preferred more honest bandits who pointed guns to demand what they wanted in a more up front way. oOoOo Colonel and Mrs Mortimer were eating out, a quiet dinner for just the two of them, at Rose Yee's uncle's restaurant when they were able to see how the attitudes of the more subtle bandits of society influenced the less subtle ones. The group of four men who came into the restaurant produced guns. \"Give us the week's take; I know you ain't banked it yet\" said the leader. \"Do you 'spect to get away with this?\" asked Jim Yee. \"Sure we will; our word against a Chink\" said the leader offensively. \"Hhmmmm\" said Mortimer \"I think you'll find him adequately backed by witnesses.\" The robbers turned to the sound of his voice. \"What are you a race traitor?\" sneered another. \"I\" said Mortimer \"Am an honest man who fails to see where race is an issue when four thieves hold up an honest businessman. I'm also\" he added \"An acting deputy marshal; so if you'd care to come quietly…..\" \"Kill him\" snapped the leader \"And if his woman squawks at all, cut her eyes out.\" There were four rapid shots. Two of them were Roberta's. \"Don't worry Mr Yee, I'll write a full report\" said Mortimer. \"You velly kind; missy velly good shot!\" gasped Mr Yee whose English was by no means as good as his Spanish. He clicked his fingers for the inexhaustible supply of nephews and sons he commanded who quickly carried the bodies out; and refused point blank to present a bill for the meal when the Mortimers had finished eating. \"I recognised one of those bravos\" said Douglas quietly to Roberta. \"One of the ones you shot; the leader in fact. He's the son of a grocery store owner. One of the vocal ones against the Chinese being permitted too much licence.\" \"Well!\" said Roberta \"As if it wasn't bad enough having to worry about some of our putative neighbours back east having trouble with our black relatives, the people out here pick on the Chinese; I really can't see why people don't realise that we're all God's children and that it's as silly as me picking on people that don't have blondish hair!\" \"Oh quite\" said Mortimer. oOoOo The consequence of the incident was when the couple were confronted the next day by an angry man demanding of Mortimer if it was true that he had shot his son in cold blood. \"Actually\" said Mortimer \"It was not I who shot your son if he is who I think he is; he was shot – and not in cold blood since he already had weapon drawn – by my associate whom he had threatened to blind. We took down two each.\" \"Then I'll see your associate at his earliest convenience\" snarled the shopkeeper \"I can shoot down any two-bit gunslinger; I don't believe my son threatened to blind any man!\" \"No: he threatened to blind a woman – me\" said Roberta. \"To stop me testifying to him telling his three associates to murder my husband in cold blood for protesting their robbery. But I'll meet you happily; is now soon enough? I shan't have any trouble shooting down a two-bit cracker!\" There was much laughter from bystanders. Mortimer grinned nastily. \"Of course if you are too scared to draw weapon on a woman – your son was quite happy to do so by the way as well as to threaten to cut her eyes out – maybe you'll fight me. After all, I'm only an accredited deputy at the moment and a long term bounty killer, so really much more weak and feeble than the fearsome and dangerous Chinese laundrymen and restaurateurs you usually prefer to go after. Alternatively you can get the hell out of my sight before I go for my horsewhip to show you what I think of a man who can encourage his son to be a thief; though I reckon the good people of this town will realise that a thief in one way is a thief in others and will start to wonder what ways you're cheating them in your store; how much chalk and alum is in your flour, how much gypsum in your tea and so on.\" The grocer stared, open mouthed. Whether it was in horror at the accusation or at the ready way those listening murmured assent was debatable; and too at the idea of taking on - for very different reasons – either an experienced bounty killer or a very young lady. Killing a deputy marshal would mean he would have to flee, even assuming he managed to cheat somehow to get the drop on so dangerous a man; and he would get nothing but scorn for killing a woman, the more so if she managed to nick him. \"I – this is preposterous!\" said the grocer \"NO woman can fire straight!\" Roberta was finding him irritating; and she had heard tell of Manco's trick with Douglas' hat and her husband's return trick shooting. She drew her gun and shot the man's hat off his head, waited for it to come down, shot again to throw it up, and again; and once more. Anyone who knew anything about marksmanship would recognise the skill in that. She blew imaginary smoke from the end of her gun. \"I still have two bullets if you wish to meet me\" she said. \"One more than I need.\" He was a ghastly hue. \"I – I don't think it's necessary\" he said. \"Wise move\" said Roberta. \"Oh, and lay off trying to terrorise the Chinese. We'll come back and reason with you if you don't.\" oOoOo \"Reason with?\" queried Mortimer. \"Well it sounded reasonable enough to say if it came to anyone accusing me of threatening him; what's to take exception to in being reasoned with after all?\" said Roberta \"But he thinks I mean shoot his manhood off because that was where I was looking as I put my gun away.\" Mortimer chuckled. \"You do a very good line in threats my dear\" he said \"I have a most excellent wife!\" \"Good; I think you should take me back to the hotel and prove that\" said Roberta. Her husband was ready to comply![Chapter 29] Chapter 29 Finally – or so it seemed – Joseph received a rather snide letter in reply to his report of knowing the general vicinity of the mine and the information that the government had cracked down on fighting over and searching for it, telling Joseph that he'd better be sure that this was not because someone in government had got their hands on it for himself or worse on behalf of the government itself. A shipment of guns was coming hidden in crates of cotton and Joseph had better meet it at Albuquerque or Gellibrand would know the reason why. His tone was generally offensive and 'you stupid nigger' was not the most unpleasant thing he called Joseph. Mortimer read it. \"I'm going to pulverise him\" he said. \"Get in the queue Doug\" said Joseph. \"Damn, that puts me third\" said Roberta. \"Hell, Bobby, you're a good enough shot to shoot his nuts off even with the difficulty of finding them in all the folds of flesh\" said Joseph \"Ladies first; you do that for you and for the way he looked at Amaryllis and THEN Douglas and me'll pound him!\" Manco laughed. \"Well Joseph, reckon you and the Colonel must be brothers; only a brother would have the balls to mention nuts to his wife.\" \"Oh I took it as a compliment to her\" said Mortimer. \"Probably would have done from you for that matter. I'd have shot anyone else.\" They packed up and prepared to travel to Albuquerque. Another long ride back to Benson to regain the railroad was to be in order and then they would be on the railroad all the time, taking the contraband to Nogales. This time Falk Peters and Niyol would be accompanying them; and it may be said that Peters stared at the letter and read it over several times. \"Mr Mortimer\" he said to Joseph \"Am I to take it that this man is stupid enough to write about guns and so on in clear without even any kind of attempt to hide it by calling it 'the goods' or any such euphemism? It almost looks like a frame of him.\" \"Well that it isn't\" said Joseph \"See, how else is de clebber white man gwine t'c'mOONicate wit' de stupid negr' bo' y'all know is to daft t'have any thought under de wool on his po' black head as might unnerstand dis YEWfeminism\" he paused, and frowned \"Did I go to far in mangling euphemism?\" \"Yes, but it gave me my first laugh of the day so I'll pass on complaining\" said Peters \"Does he really think you're that stupid?\" \"Yo' bet yo' ass, boss!\" said Joseph. \"He believes as truly as he believes he deserves to be rich – which is to say fervently and sincerely – that all blacks are dim and that I am a prime example of Homo notverysapiens.\" \"I see\" said Peters. \"Well I've seen examples of all your handwriting; I can't see that it looks like a forgery and I don't want to disbelieve you all; but I have to be suspicious because it's my job and I know you loath him.\" \"I have no axe to grind save that he's done down people I respect\" said Manco, shifting the toothpick he was chewing from one side of his mouth to the other. \"I saw the letter arrive; and I am certain nobody in our group wrote it. Besides, I had previous information that Gellibrand was involved in smuggling. That do you Marshal?\" \"Oh I'll take the word of any one of you\" said Peters \"If you give it. And I'll be looking for more proof throughout the er problem you'll be manufacturing. I want this straight down the line and no accusations able to be levelled of improper treatment of the evidence that some shyster lawyer could twist.\" \"Gelliband is a shyster lawyer\" said Mortimer \"And I give my word to add to my brother and my friend that this is the way he feels it necessary to talk to one of his employees, especially the black ones. The more threads to tie him up that you have however, the better I shall be pleased. I don't want him to find a way to wriggle out. I also don't like the names he calls Joseph.\" \"Not likely to inspire loyalty I shouldn't have thought\" said Peters dryly. \"But de boss man done have rights t'abuse po' negr'\" said Joseph \"Seeins as how po' negr' has a mother dependant on bein' fed by de great boss…. He thinks that we have obedience born into us for having been slaves, Mr Peters, and to back that up he recognises that we have ties of family so where he can tie up his four legged animals to stop them straying, he can tie up his two legged animals by threatening relatives. And my loyalty is to Douglas but I want to protect Ma too if I can. But she'd be ashamed of me if I didn't do what was right if given a chance. You are that chance, Marshal.\" \"I see\" said Peters \"Then I will do what I can to avoid any harm coming to your mother. What a very unpleasant fellow Gellibrand is to be sure!\" oOoOo The railroad took them back to Mescal, almost to Benson; and the shortest leg of the journey would then take the longest time. It looked as though there might be a hold up in Mescal too before they left; since there was a lot of excitement and the sheriff and a posse seemed to be watching the small bank. The sheriff had a sling on one arm and a bullet graze on his cheek. \"What's the problem?\" asked Peters, flashing his marshal's star. \"Bandits raided the place; left one of their fellows wounded. He has a lady cashier and is threatening to kill her if he isn't given medical aid and allowed to leave\" said the sheriff tersely. \"They kill anyone?\" asked Roberta. \"Yes; three men so far shooting their way out, and presumably the two male bank clerks and the manager\" said the sheriff. \"Bounty?\" said Roberta. \"I'll say\" said the Sheriff \"Why,ma'am? And a lady didn't ought to be so close to danger.\" \"Listen to her\" said Peters. \"She's the wife of the Man in Black; she knows what she's doing. \"Tell him that you're sending in medical supplies and as a sign of good faith a woman will bring them\" said Roberta. \"But – what woman will do that? And why should we accede to his demands? That only gives him another hostage – ma'am do you mean YOU?\" said the sheriff \"What can you do?\" \"Kill him\" said Roberta. \"I owe that to another woman; if he hadn't been part of killing I might have felt like seeing if there was another way. You can get the bounty money ready.\" \"But…..\" \"Goats but\"said Roberta. \"Give me medical supplies.\" \"But if you're going to kill him….\" \"For one thing he needs to see I have them; for another the cashiers might still be alive and the longer you argue with me, the less likely that is going to be\" said Roberta crisply. There was a shout from the bank door. \"HEY! Sheriff! How long are you going to be?\" \"Listen you scum\" called the sheriff \"I've had to find a volunteer to bring medical aid; it's now coming and a lady is going to bring it and treat you as a sign of good faith.\" \"Okay! I'll accept that!\" called the bandit \"Be nice if she's easier on the eye than this scrawny old bird!\" \"BASTARD!\" muttered the sheriff \"That's my sister he has in there….. be careful, ma'am, I implore you!\" \"I'll be careful. He'll be dead\" said Roberta calmly. She picked up the medical supplies someone had hastily brought; and set off, grinning as she heard the sheriff asking Marshal Peters if she were really of sufficient fortitude and a good enough shot; and hearing the Marshal reply dryly that as women went, Mrs Mortimer was a better man than most he knew with a star. She also heard the sound of hooves, and knew that her husband, Manco and Joseph together with the Marshal and his man were on the trail of the other bandits. Joseph had been taking lessons in shooting a handgun from Manco while they kicked their heels in Phoenix and apparently he had the eye; another thing that suggested that he probably WAS Douglas' half brother as born shots often run in families. If this was a recent raid they would have time to run them down and bring them in without losing much time on their journey; and one did not turn down the chance to earn. oOoOo The bank stank of blood. The middle aged woman was on the scrawny side but not unhandsome; nor cowed. She was staring down her nose at the bandit who was propped up on a makeshift crutch. The mark of a pistol butt stood out on her pale cheeks. \"Well you ARE easy on the eye\" said the bandit \"And the threat to let you out without having too much fun with you should hold; you ain't a whore dressed up as a lady, you're the real thing! Come here and bring those bandages\" he pointed his gun at her. \"Yes I am the real thing\" said Roberta, smiling reassuringly at the sheriff's sister; and then she shot him. It hardly registered in his mind that she had smoothly drawn her Buntline before her shot flung him backwards, his own shot jerked upwards for being too slow to react to the threat. It grazed passed Roberta's hair and a single curl floated down. \"OW!\" said Roberta as the crack of the bullet made her eardrum pop. She put a hand to her ear. \"No blood; always good\" she murmured. \"Ma'am are you hurt anywhere but that nasty bruise? Are there wounded?\" \"Yes, all the tellers are hurt badly\" said the lady \"Are you sure he's dead?\" \"Aimed for the middle of his head; easy at this range. He may not have had a lot in there to start with but it's not about to get up and think any more\" said Roberta. The woman gave a grunt of slightly hysterical laughter. \"You're some gal\" she said. \"What have you got?\" \"Bandages, whisky to clean wounds, sal volatile, needles and sterilised thread I think\" said Roberta. \"Do you know how to stitch up wounds? I've never done it.\" \"I can at need\" said the woman \"Julia Preston.\" \"Roberta Mortimer\" said Roberta. \"Let's get on with it.\" oOoOo One of the tellers was past aid; he had a belly wound. All they could do was make him comfortable – and, suggested Miss Preston, drunk – and do what they could for the bank manager and the other teller. Both had been shot in the knees – Miss Preston said that the remaining bandit had done that to protect himself – and that he had knocked her cold for long enough to establish himself in a defensive position. \"And Harry\" she said to the bank manager \"I shan't be accepting your proposal. When a woman sees a man beg on his knees for his own life without thinking of those young boys or the woman he swears he loves, she knows he's a failure. This young gal here has three times the manhood you have!\" \"Some people are just prey I'm afraid\" said Roberta. \"And some of us find we can fight; or at least not beg\" said Miss Preston. \"Your brother ought to have deputised you and given you a gun\" said Roberta. Miss Preston gave another bark of laughter. \"I don't think he realises women can shoot straight\" she said. \"Ah here he comes now it's all safe; ready see if I'm shocked. I should have stuck to teaching school not joined him out here where the school isn't going yet.\" \"Ma'am, if you'd like to come with us, learn to shoot and catch a smuggler, there'll be a school waiting to start for a lady with spirit\" said Roberta. \"Well!\" said Miss Preston \"That I must think on seriously!\" A/N yes there's a Star Wars reference. I couldn't resist it.[Chapter 30] Chapter 30 The five men cantered back into town in the middle of the afternoon with a cart they has acquired somewhere with a dozen or so bodies and a safe on it; and it may be said that the Bank Manager greeted the return of the safe with more lover-like fervour than he had shown over the safety of the woman he had asked to be his wife. \"I hope they'll be very happy together\" murmured Roberta to Julia Preston. \"You are a bad girl\" said Miss Preston without a touch of censure in her tone. Roberta had introduced her to Amaryllis and explained Douglas' plan to educate the children of all who worked for him especially since it seemed likely that half of them were related to him. To say that Miss Preston was taken aback was a slight understatement; she had never even spoken to anyone of negro descent in all her life. However, the idea that a man should stand by his kin regardless of public opinion and a stern and uncompromising belief that the war had been fought to bring about emancipation of slavery, she and her brother hailing from a New England family, she concealed her surprise and set about making mental plans to make sure that there would be no segregation in HER school because such was contrary to God's laws. Roberta suggested that she meet them at Rincon in a couple of days rather than have to pack and make her farewells in a hurry; and this was agreed. The Sheriff was in for a surprise. In the meantime he was glad that the Marshal and the bounty hunters and their women had been at the right place at the right time; and equally glad that they were leaving more or less right away. He had the Bank Manager pay out the bounties to be reimbursed by the state later. Here, a slight altercation arose over the bounty on the one Roberta had killed because she was a woman not a bounty hunter. \"Did I or did I not check that there was a bounty on him?\" said Roberta, icily. \"Yes, and thank you my dear lady, but really, the idea of a woman collecting bounty is risible!\" said the sheriff. \"You mean you don't want to put it on the receipt because it will make you a laughing stock\" said Roberta. \"Well, Sheriff, I can make you a laughing stock by spreading the story all up and down the railroad if you don't pay up; and what's more, I and my gun can do damage in your town to far more than the value of the bounty just by breaking every window in the jailhouse, the bank and the railway station.\" \"She accepted the job on the bounty; pay her\" said Peters, losing patience. \"If you don't, I shall, and you and your town will be mentioned in my report as to why it came out of my expenses.\" The sheriff paid up. oOoOo The ride was essentially uneventful. This time they were following the grade of the new railroad being built; it had gone further so the journey would be easier, and too, following the bottoms risked being swept away in flash floods. The higher ground might be harder to traverse once the grade's end was reached but it was much safer. Huddled bones of some animal, picked clean and shiny white was a reminder of the harshness of the desert; at least it was cooler now in what was essentially winter. Even so it was still hot during the day; and late in the day as it was when they set off the parched land underfoot reflected back both heat and glare. The horses could not go fast for long and they must amble at an energy saving pace, bearing in mind too that the ground was both rocky and uneven underfoot and a stone in a shoe would cost a long delay; and a broken leg from a carelessly placed foot would cost them a horse and a longer delay. At least there was water to be found her at the moment to water the horses frequently; The seasonal streams also attracted game; and a startled deer did not have a chance to get far as Joseph's rifle cracked. Food was assured for the whole journey and there would be enough left over to bargain with in Benson, and the hide too. Joseph and Mortimer salted and rolled the hide to keep it supple ready to be cured properly. \"Don't look but we're being followed\" said Manco. \"Yup. Been there since we passed those men grading the railroad\" said Mortimer. \"I suspect thieves of some kind; where there's grading there's plenty of horses; where there are horses there are horsethieves.\" \"What do we do, Uncle Douglas?\" asked Amaryllis. \"We ignore them\" said Mortimer \"They didn't disturb our supper that Joseph took down so we shan't bother. Until they bother us. We sleep in relays tonight; too bad that the late start means we can't push on in one day but that's life.\" \"Profitable delay\" said Manco. \"We'll take them in alive I suppose?\" \"They're hardly going to trouble our ingenuity to take alive\" said Niyol \"Right boss?\" \"Right\" said Peters. \"These types typically follow travellers, expecting to remain unseen, waiting until the travellers have bedded down for the night; then make off with their mounts. I despise them because in certain seasons and some of the less salubrious places that's tantamount to a death sentence for the poor devils they rob who are then unable to make it to water or shelter without a mount.\" The venison was delicious; and Roberta saved some gravy to have with cracklin' bread for breakfast. Then they made as though to go to bed. Manco and Niyol were on first watch, rising silently as soon as all was dark to slide like shadows to wait near the horses. The others were just keeping ready. The thieves did not hang about. The two men slid quietly up to the horses, and if they were not as silent as Manco and Niyol it was doubtful that they would wake any genuine sleepers of tired travellers. The nasty click of a gun being cocked and the comment, \"Forgot your calling card did you?\" from Manco allied with a cold steel circle just above the ear froze one; Niyol had just laid his wicked looking knife blade against the other's neck. It was short work to tie them and collect their horses that they would be tied to in the morning. It may also be said that Roberta fed them plain Johnny cake for breakfast while they had to endure the rich brown smell of the venison gravy and hot cracklin' bread heated on a plate set on top of the gravy Dixie. oOoOo Part of the evidence against the two horse thieves was the horse one of them had chosen to ride for himself. It had once belonged to a prominent citizen in Benson who recognised it right away and there was almost a lynch mob formed. Falk Peters took over the proceedings. The bounty hunters were recognised by one of the citizens. \"Hey, bounty killer, did that boy you were with get killed?\" asked one of the loafers outside the saloon. \"Nope\" said Mortimer \"He stayed out West; took me to his sister that I was engaged to, saw us hitched, and branched out on his own. Snakekiller Bobby is competent enough to work alone.\" That was a compliment to Roberta as well as being an explanation; Mortimer would not have said it if he did not think it was true; and Roberta flushed in pleasure. This, and her look of adoration at her husband, changed her into a very different character to Snakekiller Bobby; which had been partly the idea of passing the compliment. This pretty, blushing bride would never be associated with the dangerously competent youth Bobby. It might be said however that news spread fast; and the brassy blonde Susannah pushed her way through the crowd come to see the trial of the horse thieves to gaze upon the Colonel's wife. She gave a shriek half of woe, half of anger. \"Colonel, you're nothin' but a BABYSNATCHER!\" she cried, pointing at Roberta. \"Susannah\" said Mortimer \"You're making a fool of yourself.\" \"You married that – that CHILD? It's disgusting!\" wailed Susannah, most of whose grief was jealousy of Roberta's looks. Roberta never claimed to be a beauty; but glowing with health, her hair with lights in it from the sun and with the indefinable loveliness that seems to settle on a woman in love she passed as one, at least out here, and would be an uncommonly pretty girl anywhere. But it was her youth and dewy freshness that really showed Susannah up for what she had become. \"I am not a child\" said Roberta crossly. \"I'm nineteen. And I've seen enough of life out west to feel more mature – if not as raddled – than anyone who uses the bottom of a whisky bottle to look through more readily than a telescope and who travels from bar to bar.\" \"Miaow\" said Manco. \"Tell y'what, honey\" said Joseph to Susannah \"As my brother is married, how's about you entertain me instead?\" Susannah fell back with an expression of distaste. Mortimer dropped an arm about Joseph's shoulders. \"Allow me to introduce my half brother, and our niece\" he said, indicating Amaryllis. \"Colonel! You LIED to me!\" she shrieked \"I thought you was white!\" \"Well that I am\" said Mortimer \"But my father's mistress wasn't. Aren't you going to shake hands with my brother and niece?\" Apparently this was too much for Susannah who fled shrieking. \"Gee, Doug, I didn't think I was that ugly\" said Joseph \"Specially next to you and Manco.\" \"Well now\" said Mortimer getting out his pipe and cleaning out imaginary dottle \"Seems like she don't think I'm such a great catch after all.\" \"Good\" said Roberta \"Because whilst a man may not strike a woman if she tries to cause trouble I so will be putting my slipper across her well padded backside.\" \"You know you've no need for jealousy\" said Mortimer. \"Hell no! I'm not jealous; I'm angry at her casting aspersions on my abilities to make you a good wife and accusing me of being too young to be efficient!\" said Roberta crossly. Mortimer laughed. \"My dear, it was me she was accusing of using some skulduggery to obtain so young and lovely a wife\" he explained. \"Well I wish I HAD spanked her well then!\" said Roberta.[Chapter 31] Chapter 31 The crates of cotton had to be signed for at Albuquerque but otherwise not the slightest bit of notice was taken of them. It was not hard to remove one quietly to an office when Peters flashed his star; and he searched it. The guns were hidden in the cotton, not too many per crate so the weight would not be too significant. There was a name on the manifest signing them into the care of the railway company; and Peters sent some telegraphs. The men at the other end were to be watched, but not arrested until his word, he told his posse. \"So now we go through the palaver of taking the wretched things south and pretending to sell them\" said Joseph. \"We need a hacienda not far the other side of the border we can take over\" said Mortimer. \"There's an abandoned one where I do a lot of the deals\" said Joseph. \"I think it's supposed to be haunted; the tales are told expressly to keep people out.\" \"That'll do nicely\" said Mortimer. \"Do we empty out the guns here and have them put under lock and key?\" asked Roberta \"No\" said Peters \"We need the boss to agree that they are the guns he's asking for money for.\" \"Somehow I feel doubtful that we're going to persuade Gellibrand to come himself\" growled Mortimer \"This isn't going to work.\" \"Ever staked out a bar to pick up a lead that will take you to a bandit's girlfriend who might then lead you to him?\" said Peters. Mortimer nodded. \"I take your point, Marshal, I'm just a bit impatient; I'd rather like my first child to be born in my family house.\" \"I don't see you'll have any fear of missing out on that, Colonel\" said Peters. \"Can we wait until I'm certain it's a happy event that we're expecting please before we discuss it?\" said Roberta tartly \"I'm not superstitious but there's such a thing as tempting fate.\" \"Sorry ma'am\" said Peters. Mortimer took her hand and kissed her fingers. \"You were rather frugal in your eating this morning\" he murmured. \"I felt a little queasy…..OH!\" said Roberta. \"I take it\" said Manco, firmly picking up the conversation to give Roberta a chance to adjust to what was now making her blush furiously \"That he'll be likely to send someone high enough in the organisation who might be persuaded to rat up the big man for a deal?\" \"Something along those lines, yes\" said Peters \"Plus the results of those telegrams I sent; I have buddies who know what to do and how to spread the net. One of them will be following up the military aspect too; and whoever is selling these guns on is going to squeal to avoid execution for treason.\" \"Seems likely\" Manco nodded. \"The joe that our prisoner from that Hopi settlement talked of – Fellowes – seems likely to be the one that gets sent.\" \"He's a mean bastard is Fellowes\" said Joseph \"I've met him a few times. He used to be a slave owner; but he ain't accepted by all the society types account of being part Hispanic; his grandmother was some Hidalga but being a Mexican counts for more than being their kind of aristocracy.\" \"Humans are crazy\" said Roberta, re-entering the conversation after having surreptitiously embraced her husband. \"No honey; we ain't all crazy\" said Amaryllis in her soft rich deep voice \"It de rest o' the world dat's crazy.\" Amaryllis rarely made a comment so when she did it carried more weight. \"You sure have got a point, ma'am\" said Peters. \"And as well as a lot of people being crazy – which by the way is what's going to sell the story, that this pretend Hispanic of ours won't give money to a black man – they are also greedy and careless. Greed will bring as Manco says probably Fellowes; but you see there's such a thing as what we call a paper trail. Letters in his room perhaps; or on him. Once he's arrested we can look at bank records. We can requisition copies of any telegraph he has sent from anywhere he has been; and if he's over confident for it always having worked, he may have stubs of his railway tickets so we can trace exactly where he's been, check out any message he's sent; pay the hotel servants to tell us if they know if he met anyone. You know the score; you've done it many times. But I get to requisition the copies of messages, I don't have to bribe someone to let me see them, or find a way to er, acquire them.\" \"Generally I take the next form down and blow powdered graphite across it because most people are careless enough to fill in the telegraph form on top of the others\" said Mortimer \"Ain't never thought to find out about telegraphs sent in places I haven't watched them be sent from. It's a good tip.\" \"So's the graphite\" said Peters \"And one I'll remember.\" \"And Niyol will make sure to keep powdered grapite ready\" said Niyol dryly. \"Because you're the best scout and number two a man could have\" said Peters. \"I'd fall apart without your efficiency\" Niyol grinned. He did not agree out loud but his agreement was loud in his silence. oOoOo By common consent, the Mortimers were found an empty carriage of their own while Manco drifted to one end of it and Joseph to the other to menace anyone who tried to enter it. Peters and Niyol took Amaryllis with them pretending to know nothing about the tactic. \"We have some good friends\" said Mortimer. Roberta giggled. \"I think it's neat the way Manco calls me Mrs Mortimer in public and to tease me\" she said \"He and Joseph are good friends. I could half wish Manco might marry Amaryllis to make him family.\" Mortimer shook his head. \"Isn't going to happen\" he said \"Only sort of woman Manco's going to marry is when he finds one like you who can adapt to his world. Amaryllis takes hardships without complaining – she's a good girl – but she's never once made a push to learn to shoot. She prefers to sew.\" \"Yes, it seems strange to me\" said Roberta \"But she said to me, if she's really going to be a lady as your niece she can sew all day and have a maid to do the washing and ironing.\" Mortimer laughed. \"Well she shall have a sewing machine too! When we go home….. my dear, I do apologise for being abrupt in sharing the news; I was not a gentleman to lack such tact. But I DO want our first child to be born at home if at all possible.\" \"I'll be happy to have your baby if he or she is born under a haystack\" said Roberta. \"I was being slow I suppose, working it out; but aren't you supposed to actually be sick every morning?\" \"Not necessarily\" said Mortimer. \"I think some women experience no symptoms at all. I suspect that leading an active life and not wearing a corset might help too.\" \"Oh like the Hebrew women who were quick\" said Roberta. \"That's what that is about, isn't it, that because they were enslaved they worked hard and were active and the Egyptian women were indolent and so sluggish.\" \"Exactly\" said Mortimer. \"Douglas\" said Roberta \"Why do people say unpleasant things about Hebrews, Jews? I mean the ones of today. I mean, Jesus was a Jew wasn't he?\" \"Yes my dear\" said Mortimer. \"Like Amaryllis says, everyone else is crazy. Now come here; as we have some privacy I want to kiss you.\" There is a limit to how much further than a kiss a loving couple might manage in a swaying railway carriage, even when they are certain that their privacy is fairly guaranteed; but that limit was certainly approached and the timely warning shouted by Manco through the door, \"Better be decent for the station old man!\" was not an entirely superfluous warning. oOoOo Julia Preston was joining them here at Rincon; and Roberta thought she looked years younger for being out from under the censorious eye of her stuffy brother and embarking on an adventure! Roberta embraced her warmly. \"I'm glad you didn't get talked out of joining us!\" she said. \"Well I might have done but for one thing\" said Miss Preston, a martial light in her eyes \"My fool brother, after worriting like a hen about a woman travelling alone – as if I didn't travel alone when he sent to ask me to join him – decided he would exert his influence as my brother and FORBID me to join you. Well, I asked if he planned to arrest me and lock me in his jailhouse because he had some crime he thought I'd committed; and when he had admitted that this was absurd I pointed out that it was the only way he had of preventing a woman who has attained her majority long since from doing as she pleased in a free country. Well he prated about Arizona law and how a woman needs protection and that being why the Mormons began the habit of polygamy – which I believe is to be outlawed – so I said I was returning to civilised parts in the east with you where competency to be a human being was not measured on being able to relieve oneself standing up. It was coarse and crude, I admit; but he riled me that much!\" \"Yes, I can see why\" said Roberta \"Some men keep all their brains in that relatively limited compartment that makes up their manhood. I can't say I was that impressed by your brother though to do him justice he was more concerned for YOUR safety than for that of a strange woman he did not know.\" \"Oh he is a good man\" said Miss Preston \"And I do love him – better when we haven't spoken for a while though I admit. It was why I consented to join him; he spoke of a growing town and implied that by the time I got there I should have a school to take on. Well nobody has yet built a schoolhouse, and he objected to me taking pupils in his house, and then he tried to object when I took the job in the bank, for I cannot be idle and I wanted besides to be independent. It was, I confess, irritation with my brother that led to me even considering Harry's – the bank manager's – proposal. I suspect though\" she added cynically \"It was in order to obtain a live-in skivvy for free. What do we do first?\" \"A lot of sitting idle kicking our heels while messages pass and we wait for a criminal to walk into the trap we are baiting\" said Roberta. \"However, we might contrive to work on costumes to fulfil the story we tell; and perhaps turn you into an hidlaga, for your are darker in complexion than I – as well as having the concern that the chief evildoer knows me – to treat our smuggler with distain.\" \"Why, I do believe I shall enjoy that!\" said Miss Preston. \"While we are travelling you must fill me in on more details!\" Roberta proceeded to do so, not concealing her flight in boy's clothing, and Mortimer's care of her for her reputation until such time as he realised that she had come to love him as well as he loved her. Miss Preston, a forceful lady, had seen too much of the way women could be treated to censure the disguise; and had, however deeply buried, a spinster lady's love of romance such that she had to dab a surreptitious tear! She declared herself firmly behind the Colonel's quest and informed Roberta that such a man who had the courage to admit to his irregular relatives was a man of more moral fibre than the likes of Thomas Jefferson who had sold his own daughter. With which encomium she adopted the group firmly and took Amaryllis under her wing as a young girl in need of a mother figure. Orphaned at an early age and alternately roughly loved and scolded by her aunt and by Joseph's mother, her grandmother, Amaryllis rather enjoyed the experience of collecting another kindly aunt figure![Chapter 32] Chapter 32 The journey to Nogales was enlivened only by the group of travelling soldiers who were being posted west; they were inclined to try to flirt with Roberta and make free with Amaryllis until Roberta smiled at the man who was trying to chuck her under the chin and kneed him hard, and kicked in the shins the one who had his arm around the waist of a protesting Amaryllis. Mortimer and Manco and Joseph had been moving into action but Mortimer relaxed once he saw his wife was more than capable of dealing with the situation. So did Peters who was wondering how to prevent the soldiers being turned into meat. \"Listen you joes and listen good because I shall only say this once\" said Roberta putting an arm around the scared Amaryllis \"If you are stupid enough to try to rape the wife and the niece of a deputy marshal you are not going to get to face court martial because the marshal and his deputies here are going to smear your sorry carcases all across the carriage.\" \"You mean you've engaged in miscegenation?\" the officer of the soldiers looked horrified \"That's a crime you know!\" \"What in tarnation are you talking about?\" said Roberta. \"He thinks that you're wed to my half brother\" said Mortimer. \"You boys shut the hell up and don't give us any more crap; I'm not in the mood to take a bunch of Johnny-raws thinking they can fool with my wife, nor with my niece who is under my protection. YOU HEARD ME SOLDIERS SIT DOWN!\" he barked. They sat. \"All that Colonelling was good for something then\" murmured Manco \"Oh the parade ground voice comes in occasionally\" said Mortimer. oOoOo A cart was procured to carry the bales of cotton across the border; this was all apparently quite normal and in order. A couple of ounces of tobacco saw that no trouble was made by the rather nominal official presence. Travelling across the border was no big deal; and Joseph was known to travel on behalf of a big cotton grower. He and the cotton and Amaryllis crossed alone; the group had decided, or rather Mortimer in consultation with Peters had decided, that in case of spies, Joseph and Amaryllis should have no truck with the rest of them until they were in Mexico. There were no real interruptions as they headed south – at least one could hardly count as an interruption an ambush by Mexican bandits who changed their minds and fled at the competent way their would-be victims suddenly became armed and dangerous – and they reached the hacienda. \"And now we kick our heels again\" said Mortimer. \"Never mind; you can spend the time profitably teaching me how to shoot\" said Julia Preston cheerily. \"You are one helluva lady!\" said Joseph in admiration. Miss Preston flushed. \"Why thank you\" she said demurely \"I suppose I have to learn to accept rough language too.\" Joseph's face was too dark to show a flush but he certainly looked embarrassed. \"Beg pardon ma'am\" he said. \"Granted\" said Miss Preston. Manco raised a cynical eyebrow, spat out the stub of his cigar and muttered to Roberta, \"I think you talked us into being schooled by the schoolmarm, Bobby.\" \"If you ask me, she's so unused to receiving compliments, Manco, she doesn't quite know how to do it without taking it a bit two ways and with a tart comment\" said Roberta. \"She'll lighten up when she realises she is considered admirable by us for her courage.\" \"Mebbe\" said Manco. oOoOo The hacienda was abandoned but not too ruinous; and the women drove the men outside as they were, said Miss Preston, underfoot while the ladies might bring it to reasonable living conditions 'If we are to stay here for the time it takes to spring the trap' as Roberta said; having calculated that they should give it three or four days at least for Joseph to meet with a buyer, a day or so of arguing, and then the couple of weeks it would take to send to Gellibrand and for him to either come himself or send a surrogate. Even if Joseph sent a wire, it would take time for someone to travel there. They disturbed a pair of rattlesnakes whose heads Roberta blew off without thinking – the gunshots brought the men back at the run – and Manco gave his odd truncated grunt of laughter. \"Snakekiller Bobby living up to the name\" he said \"You want to cure the skins and when you collect more have a vest made of them for when you're being Snakekiller Bobby.\" Roberta regarded the snakes thoughtfully. \"Nope\" she said \"Sartorially gauche. I shall cure these ones to wear as a hat band; more subtle.\" They resumed their cleaning untroubled by anything more dangerous than some rodents. The men were fulsome in their praise of the change that had been wrought and duly appreciative of being fed as well. \"Are they normally this polite Mrs Mortimer, or are they afraid of your marksmanship?\" asked Miss Preston. \"Oh call me Roberta….. they are pretty polite actually\" said Roberta. \"And you must call me Julia; dear me, I must say that I had anticipated bounty killers being rough men; not men with more manners than town dwellers.\" \"Well ma'am\" said Manco \"Seems to me when everyone carries a gun and knows how to use it, manners as a matter of course can stop all sorts of little misunderstandings from becoming fatal misunderstandings.\" \"I never looked at it like that\" said Julia. \"Well, as we're settled here for a while with an excellent well, if you boys will haul fuel for a good fire tomorrow we women will have wash day.\" \"Ain't it against a bounty killer's religion to be totally clean?\" laughed Joseph. \"Speak for yourself\" said Mortimer \"I for one would be grateful. The laundry in Phoenix was well enough but I'm ready to have my washing done; thank you ladies.\" oOoOo As it happened a group of Mexicans rode up while they were waiting, dismounting in the hacienda courtyard. Having seen them come from some distance the gunslingers of the party were ready and quietly waiting; Julia and Amaryllis were safe hiding upstairs. \"Hey Jose!\" the leader called. \"It's what they call me\" said Joseph to Mortimer. Mortimer nodded and walked out. \"My name ain't Jose\" he said. \"I don't think I'm the person you're looking for; 'f I was you I'd turn right around and leave. There's nothing here for you.\" There is something of the psyche of the bandit wherein backing off tamely is somehow anathema; and the leader went for his gun. He was falling off his horse before it was clear off the holster. Naturally the others also went for their guns; and were cut down. \"I hope that nobody damaged the fancy hat one of them was wearing\" said Manco \"I rather fancy it if I'm to play Hidalgo bandit.\" This incident necessitated digging scrapes to bury the bodies and piling stones on them; but Roberta pointed out that apart from Joseph none of the group were going anywhere and might as well be usefully employed giving the bodies a decent burial. \"Sometimes my darling, being right can be a most unattractive trait\" said Mortimer, his eyes laughing to belie the words. \"And we do want to keep scavengers off them; we'll want to avoid cairns though; might draw too much attention to ourselves. shovel the desert on top of those stones people; it'll be better than nothing.\" Niyol, who could be almost invisible when he put his mind to it, was to accompany Joseph and Amaryllis back to Nogales to send a telegraph, shadowing them there and back. And as they had now been found by bandits it was reasonable for them to leave. Having the horses would also add verisimilitude; figures in ponchos looking out would do for bandits from a distance even if Gellibrand himself came and might recognise any of those figures close to. Manco was quickly tricked out in a suit that would pass as an hidalgo and Julia as his arrogant wife; she was at least finding her way around a weapon. Niyol returned alone the day after they had left. \"Joseph sent a telegram 'buyer won't pay black man advice'; and the reply returned. Gellibrand seem not to care about paying for extra names he call Joseph. He say sit tight, and man will come.\" \"Mmmhmm\" said Mortimer. \"That means he is sending a surrogate.\" \"Well we shall soon find out\" said Peters. \"Reckon you can get a good look at the man when he arrives and get well ahead of them Niyol?\" \"Boss, I ain't become stupid yet\" said Niyol. \"I guess not\" said Peters. \"Sorry.\" Niyol gave him his half grin and accepted a drink of water for himself and his horse before riding back. \"You got yourself a good deputy there\" said Mortimer. \"One of the best\" agreed Peters. \"I'll be sorry to lose you people to cotton growing too.\" \"I ain't takin' up farming yet awhile\" said Manco \"Reckon I might see my way to working in contact with you. I don't gen'ly work under no man. But you're not bad as lawmen go.\" \"He says he likes you as well as he likes anyone\" laughed Roberta. \"Niyol's a good man\" said Manco \"Gotta trust his judgement.\"[Chapter 33] Chapter 33 Niyol rode in looking as cool and unhurried as usual though his horse was certainly sweating from the pace at which he had ridden. Roberta took the bridle from him to walk the animal to cool it and give it water to drink from the trough that had warmed in the sun so cold water would not give the poor beast cramps. Niyol beckoned the others to join her so that all might hear what he had to say and nothing would need repeating. He took up wisps of straw to help Roberta rub the horse down as he spoke. \"Man called Fellows come; he bring six men, six hard men. They mean to threaten buyer. I come on to tell you; they leave, hour, maybe two behind me.\" \"Well done Niyol\" said Peters. \"Excellently done\" nodded Mortimer. \"Seven eh? Well Joseph might not be in a position to fight; and Amaryllis is his main charge. That's five of us.\" \"Six\" said Julia \"I can handle a rifle well enough; I can be at a window as an extra.\" Mortimer nodded. \"Very well, ma'am. Your job shall be specific; watch that none of them tries to use Joseph or Amaryllis as a shield or hostage. Kill anyone who tries.\" \"Yes Colonel\" said Julia. They settled to wait in heat that beat down and beat back up again as it reflected off the desert's stony surface; the sky was the colour of unpolished pewter save around the sun itself where in a halo of too great a radius it was polished to a silver too bright to even look near. Even the lizards found the surface of the ground too hot to stay on as the sun rose inexorably and the lizards scuttled for the shade; And the heavy stillness of midday crept over the scene. The sound of approaching horses could be heard from a great distance; and broke the mesmeric spell of the heat-induced lassitude that threatened the watchers. oOoOo The horses clattered into the hacienda yard; Manco was there to greet them, Mortimer and Peters to each side of him. The boxes of rifles were there. \"I hear that you don't want to pay, you stinking po-bean\" said the leader, a big, man who was all muscle, and every ounce of it sweating and peeling redly. \"I don't pay the messenger boy, gringo\" said Manco. \"I only pay to someone I think I can do business with. You think you can intimidate me with your men? I have men at the windows. You are outgunned. But you shall have your money if you can prove to me we can do business.\" \"You're not the usual one – my agent said so\" said Fellowes, dismounting. His men cautiously followed suit. Mortimer frowned slightly; they were all dismounting together, any old how. MOST unprofessional. If they were his men they would be on punishment for such carelessness and risking each other. Manco grinned. It was not a pretty grin. \"The usual one…..no. He and his men met with a little case of sudden lead poisoning\" he said. \"They're in the vicinity; but I wanted the shipment. And I wanted to know what else you could get for me.\" \"Why, you running a revolution?\" asked Fellowes. \"That's not your business. The cargo and the price is.\" \"Getting a large quantity of guns might be a problem; I may have to ask more\" said Fellowes. \"More bribes.\" Manco nodded. \"That is understood. But you can get more guns and bring them across the border for me?\" \"Easy as falling off a log\" said Fellows. \"I have to consult with my boss, but Mr Gellibrand won't have any trouble; he has a contact in the army.\" \"Excellent\" said Manco. \"You're under arrest.\" It was in exactly the same tone as before. It took a while for his words to sink in. By which time Roberta and Niyol had moved smoothly outside and Joseph had been handed a pistol. Amaryllis had slid inside. \"Kill them!\" screeched Fellowes. He pointed his own gun at Manco who shot it out of his hand. \"United States Marshal! Surrender!\" called Peters. He was more or less obliged to give them the chance. Niyol, Roberta and Joseph kicked the feet out from under the three who hesitated and half raised their hands; Mortimer accounted for the other three. \"Not very tidy, Colonel\" said Peters. \"Looks tidy enough to me\" said Mortimer. \"They won't know anything you know, Marshal\" said Manco. \"I know; but I have the obligation to give them the chance to surrender\" said Peters. \"Nathan Fellowes, I can hand you over to my temporary deputies or you can tell me everything you know about your principle Gamaliel Gellibrand whom you have already named in my presence.\" Fellows had a few choice words to say. Manco slapped him hard. \"You didn't ought to use language like that in front of ladies\" he said. Fellowes was a big man; his hand hurt where the gun had been wrenched from it but he knew he had just one chance. He flicked his fingers at Manco's face and while Manco was briefly distracted, kicked at his ankles and immediately swivelled to run for a horse. He went down with a scream. Mortimer had put a shot through his ankle. \"Pretty shot old man\" said Manco \"There was I wondering if you'd not had enough practise lately with THAT weapon.\" \"Oh I manage to practise all I need\" said Mortimer. \"Fellowes, you are facing a charge of treason on grounds of selling weapons belonging to the United States Army which might be used to levy war against the United States. Co-operate and I fancy the Marshal might let you plead to smuggling only.\" Fellowes, already half swooning with pain, went a ghastly hue at that and passed out. \"Nice touch Colonel\" said Peters. \"We'd better get him into the shade and ask Miss Preston if she'd physic his ankle or we'll lose our chief witness.\" oOoOo Julia made an efficient job of making Fellowes' ankle comfortable enough to make him ride north; and when he came to he was ready to be as loquacious as Marshal Peters wanted him to be. Gamaliel Gellibrand had, it appeared, done some work as a military lawyer and had got a systematic military thief unconditionally discharged from a number of charges at a court martial; of which the little thief was undoubtedly guilty. Once the war was over, they had been in partnership over a number of small frauds and thefts, Gellibrand helping with the paperwork; and then the idea of selling surplus weapons to Mexicans had been mooted and the whole scheme hatched. Fellows had also been in the army and had caught the dishonest supply officer at it; and had demanded his cut. He had been in the partnership ever since, he and the other man, Gruder, deferring to Gellibrand who was undoubtedly the brains in the operation. He yammered a lot about his rights when made to mount up to ride north. \"You have the right for me to match up the other ankle if you don't quit whining and ride\" said Manco who was irritated about being caught out by a child's trick. Fellowes looked into those flint grey eyes that were as hard and pitiless as the sky. He mounted up. oOoOo Back in Nogales Peters had a lot of telegraphs to send as soon as his prisoners were under lock and key and Fellowes' statement read out to him to be signed in the presence of a notary. Fellowes remained co-operative; he was a greedy opportunist and he respected Gellibrand's brains but he was not about to take the fall for him. He agreed with the statement and signed it. \"And now we go after Gellibrand\" said Mortimer, his face hard. \"I don't think so Colonel\" said Peters. \"Now you will go and take over your house which will be awarded back to you square and legal once the criminal has been arrested. Another Marshal is on his way to arrest Gellibrand. I've become fond of you; and I don't want to hear that you've overstepped the mark so that I have to come after YOU.\" Mortimer scowled. He wanted that revenge. He wanted to shoot Gellibrand; and he wanted it for the creature's advances on his lovely Roberta as much as for himself. And his fists slowly unclenched as he thought of Roberta's face if he made himself a criminal by doing it; thought of their unborn child growing up without a father. He nodded curtly. \"I get to give evidence against him in court though?\" he said \"Indeed yes\" said Peters. \"You get to face him in court.\" \"Good\" said Mortimer. \"Well in that case, my wife and I will be on our way to get the sort of clothes a lady and gentleman should be wearing for their homecoming.\" \"And I will write to my parents\" said Roberta \"It shouldn't arrive until Gellibrand is arrested and shown to be a criminal; that way my father can do all his ranting and blustering on his own time and get it out of his system.\" \"He won't\" said Mortimer \"Get it out of his system I mean; but he should at least get far enough to take stock that DOING anything about it is pretty foolish. Remind him that I'm the best shot in the Carolinas just to save him getting silly ideas.\" \"I will, my dear\" said Roberta. \"Dear me! It feels quite flat, stale and unprofitable!\" \"Yes\" said Mortimer \"But fortunately it has been profitable in reality even if it doesn't feel that way having to pass it into the hands of another. However we are now free of Gellibrand and may enjoy the thought of parenthood.\" \"Oh yes, Douglas!\" said Roberta, gazing adoringly at him.[Chapter 34] Chapter 34 Memphis was not technically a city but it was certainly looking as though it would not be many years before it regained city status after the tremendous dislocation caused by the Yellow Fever of more than a decade before. The main streets were broad and lined with shops and buildings of many storeys, and the river brought people to and fro by the big paddleboats that plied their trade up and down the imperturbable Mississippi, whose flow stopped for nothing, be it war, fever or the ever growing rail network. The brand new Grand Opera House looked, Roberta said in awe, like some great civic building, a court house or the like; on the corner of Main and Beale the arched entrance stretched up two storeys, each one of which was high enough to house two floors, and the rusticated and reticulated stonework that defined the arch looked very grand indeed as did the high embrasures like the classical architecture Roberta recalled having seen in a picture of the Coliseum in Rome. The posters on display offered equestrian shows, boxing matches and comedies as well as opera; there was no end to the entertainment to be found there! There was even to be a Wild West show with fancy shooting and trick riding by what were billed as 'real Western cowboys'. \"Huh\" said Roberta, losing interest \"They don't know a thing.\" Mortimer chuckled. \"No my love\" he said \"And the good folks of Memphis who come to be thrilled by the dangerous wild westerners would be horrified at the real thrills you have faced with equanimity.\" \"No point getting excited over things you can't change and less point getting excited when it's better to get even\" said Roberta. \"You've been taking lessons from Manco\" said Mortimer. \"And from you\" said Roberta. \"And I want a proper hot bath and clean clothes; I have all the smuts from the railroad on me. I expect Amaryllis and Julia feel the same, even if you and Joseph don't.\" \"Well I certainly do\" said Mortimer. \"I thought we'd fix a hotel room and have a tailor come to call on us, a man's tailor and a woman's tailor, to see about our outfitting. Our people deserve us to come home looking fit to trot not faded and crumpled as we are. And don't hesitate to demand divided skirts my dear.\" \"I shan't\" said Roberta. \"I'm half scared to go back to Oak Grove; it feels like a lifetime, and as though my former life is almost a dream.\" \"Me too\" said Mortimer \"But we have our duty. And your father is NOT going to demand you back; he'll maybe call us some hard names but you're not what he considers saleable.\" \"You mean he can't get a good deal on my maidenhead from some ageing lecher\" said Roberta. Mortimer grinned ruefully. \"Some would describe me thus\" he said \"But actually, watch your father fawn when I am the one who is the owner of Oakridge House.\" \"I can almost hear the drool hitting your boots\" said Roberta cynically. \"Had you thought what exactly you're going to do on our arrival?\" \"Yup. First off I'm going to give a big feast for everyone who works for me so I can start to get to know faces. Then I'm going to announce that there will be some changes because I'm going to incorporate the cotton growing and the cotton gin as a company; and forty nine per cent of the shares will be divided between my workers. I'll have it all tied up legal that if they want to leave they have to sell the shares back. And when the company does well, they get a better dividend. Best incentive to hard work is reward.\" \"That's going to need a lawyer\" said Roberta, wrinkling up her nose. \"Yes; but whatever the saying is about the only good lawyer being a dead lawyer, there ARE honest lawyers out there\" said Mortimer. \"If you say so, Douglas\" said Roberta dubiously. \"I expect there are peace-loving Apaches too and a few sane Hatters.\" \"Oh if you look far enough\" said Mortimer. Manco had bade them farewell; he was a man of the desert and its towns and the idea of the east was not what he found attractive. He had nodded to Mortimer and told him to send to Tucumcari if he needed him as it was a town he generally passed through once a year at least; and people there would see he got a message. Roberta had sniffed and said that a personal advertisement in the newspapers would find him quicker as any Bounty Killer kept abreast of the news. Manco had grinned and agreed that perhaps sometimes Mrs Mortimer had the better ideas. oOoOo The hotel was a grand looking building too; and the receptionist pointed at Joseph and Amaryllis. \"We don't have their kind here\" he said. \"Whites only!\" \"No?\" said Mortimer, taking out a wad of notes and fanning them. \"Well looks like you won't be taking anything green either. Have a really bad day, son\" and dropped an arm over Joseph's shoulder to walk out. \"I have heard that there are moves to make segregation law not just custom\" said Julia. \"Foolishness\" said Mortimer. \"And dangerous foolishness to rock the boat too much Doug\" said Joseph. \"We'll find a hotel that has a floor where blacks are allowed and Amaryllis and I will stay there. Let's not make trouble; we've seen enough without making more.\" Mortimer sighed. \"My brother the wise one\" he said. oOoOo Once settled into a hotel with a more liberal policy Mortimer and Joseph stepped out to find a tailor; and Roberta, Amaryllis and Julia went to find a haberdasher's and to place a small advertisement for a dressmaker willing to visit for fittings. There was much discussion on the rival merits of velvets and silks and cottons and on ribbons or fringes as trim. Fashion magazines were also pored over; Les Modes Parisiennes in Peterson's magazine, and Godey's Lady's Book among others. It appeared that sleeves had fullness at the sleevehead and waists were low, with a point at the front. Classical style drapery was still in fashion in a very controlled sort of way – Roberta thought it looked silly on a corseted silhouette and said so – and skirts had a little more fullness at the back than at the front but a fairly smooth line all round seemed to be in order, but with the skirt so arranged as to form drapery at the front, as it were following the waistline where it dropped at the centre front. \"Doesn't favour a lady with broad hips\" said Roberta \"Good job we're all slim hipped.\" \"Scrawny in my case dear\" said Julia. \"Nonsense; under fed and under appreciated\" said Roberta. \"You've actually filled out even with the privations of travelling with us.\" \"Happiness does do wonders\" admitted Julia. \"This drawing which might be of a panel let in at each side or might be a front and back draped overskirt would admirably conceal a divided skirt in the side fabric's material; it's matched by the deep semicircular yoke see.\" \"I like that\" said Roberta \"And the hat isn't as wide as some. Mind some of the little chip hats aren't so much hats as frivolities.\" \"Nothing wrong wit' frivolity honey\" said Amaryllis. \"I sho' would like to be frivolous.\" \"And so you shall be\" said Roberta. \"I am glad that the style of a full taille is still in fashion so a waist and skirt might be worn with it as a suit. I feel more comfortable now with separates.\" \"And sho' 'nuff there's 'nuff garniture, Berta honey, to hide a multitude of changes\" said Amaryllis. \"Yes; very adaptable\" said Roberta \"Peterson's shows sleeveheads as less full, but there's some ease in them; I like that for the ease of movement.\" They returned to the hotel with an employee of the haberdasher's bringing their purchases, and were enjoying continuing their planning in the sitting room that was part of the Mortimers' suite when the men arrived. \"You know, ladies, I'd not grudge you going to a modiste and telling her, make up this, this and this model in such and such colour and fabric\" said Mortimer. \"Uncle Douglas, 'deed that's profligate!\" declared Amaryllis. \"Quite so\" said Roberta \"I know we took bounty and to spare and there's more than enough to boost the plantation but there's having plenty and then there's being extravagant!\" \"Indeed!\" agreed Julia \"And me being grateful to you for your generosity, Colonel!\" \"Makes me feel a bit of a dandy now getting our suits made up\" said Joseph ruefully. \"Well we men have less need of different clothes for different times of day I guess\" said Mortimer. \"Just our extravagant vests to cheer up sober garb.\" \"Exactly\" said Roberta. \"We've advertised for a dressmaker though to help us; with an extra pair of hands, especially if she has a sewing machine, we can get our clothes made up in a trice, and enough cut and basted to occupy us on the rest of the journey. Amaryllis is clever about cutting out even without paper patterns; and we have bought adaptable patterns too. And don't you think that Amaryllis is going to look sweet in this pretty challis with pink roses on a beige ground, trimmed with this matching pink silk? And this blue and light brown tartan style check wool with the gold line in it on a beige ground teamed with the blue merino will do me just fine for a day dress, and Julia will be stylish in brown with a subtle golden brown stripe to it trimmed in scarlet.\" \"We'll be beating them off you all with sticks!\" laughed Mortimer. \"Oh has the paper been delivered? Anything in it?\" \"Douglas, we haven't even unfolded it\" said Roberta \"We got in right before you did.\" \"Well then, I shall take the privilege of the head of the household to read it first\" laughed Mortimer and picked it up. Then he froze and read rapidly, fury on his face. \"What is it?\" asked Roberta. Mortimer flung the paper down for them to look at, too angry to speak. A picture of Gamaliel Gellibrand sneered from the front page, accompanied by the headline 'Treasonous Smuggler kills Marshal and gets away'. Roberta picked up the paper and read out: \"'Gamaliel Gellibrand, believed to be a respectable lawyer was proven to be a long time traitor and smuggler recently, his activities uncovered by Marshal Falk Peters with the aid of one of Gellibrand's victims in a big fraud perpetrated on him. Former Confederate Colonel Douglas Mortimer and his wife and other relatives aided Marshal Peters in following the trail that led to the confessions of confederates of Gellibrand naming him as their principal. Not only has the US Army been defrauded of materiel by this sordid gang but weapons have been sold to foreign nationals, posing a risk to National Security. Gellibrand received Marshal David Somerlees who was sent to arrest him and according to Gellibrand's own servants snatched a gun from a drawer and shot the Marshal dead. He is believed to be armed and dangerous. A bounty has been posted on him of five thousand dollars.' WELL!\" she said \"That poor marshal!\" \"Indeed\" said Mortimer \"But probably too just a trifle over confident. To go alone when his quarry has servants – true, nobody seems to have backed him, but they might have done even if only out of fear, is stupid. Well looks like we're back to bounty hunting.\" \"No\" said Roberta \"You have your responsibility to your people – our people – first. The story goes on in a sickly sort of way about the marring of the romantic homecoming of the exile – that's you – and his lovely bride; I guess they had to assume that your bride is lovely to make up the rest of the fairy story that is here. And you need to get the plantation running properly and appoint Joseph as steward or whoever seems most suitable if he wants to turn bounty hunter and THEN we go after Gellibrand. He's as slippery as a buttered rattler in a tub of lard; I doubt they'll catch him quickly. Besides, then the bounty will go up and Uncle Sam can buy us an extension to the business. Mind, there's nothing wrong with dropping Manco a line.\" Douglas Mortimer gave a shout of laughter. \"Practical as always, my love!\" he said. \"And you are right about reassuring our people. Now the rest of you go away; I want to kiss my clever wife properly and you are all cramping my style.\" They laughed and left; and Roberta and Douglas might take out the bitter disappointment and anger in physical activity that restored their good spirits as they loved together and recalled that there were more important things in life than the fate of Gamalial Gellibrand.[Chapter 35] Chapter 35 The riverboat was called Princess of the Billows which was, as Roberta muttered a rather pretentious name. \"They're pretentious sorts of boats my dear\" said Mortimer \"All top hamper; rather like a blowsy bar girl. There's only a foot or two of freeboard; it's said they can make way on a heavy dew.\" \"It's not being able to float on a heavy dew that bothers me\" said Roberta, eyeing the big wooden boat and its side wheels with disfavour \"It's staying afloat on a deep river. I do not swim.\" \"You don't? after growing up on the Roanoke Lake?\" Mortimer was surprised. \"With a father like mine? Douglas, you know how genteel my riding was\" said Roberta. \"Well then; I shall have great enjoyment teaching you to swim\" said Mortimer. Roberta blushed prettily. \"I look forward to that\" she said \"But in the meantime, if God had meant mankind to travel by these washtubs with boilers he wouldn't have sent Trevithick to invent steam locomotives.\" \"Sho' honey, the Good Lord can't mean to drown us when we has our new clo'es\" said Amaryllis comfortingly if, as Roberta privately thought, irrelevantly. They had found a seamstress who had a daughter to help her and were dressed in such of their new finery as had been completed while waiting for the men to be outfitted. And their finery was enough to earn the deference of many people; even Joseph and Amaryllis were given more respect than that to which they were accustomed. As the women were also bedecked with furs lining their muffs, trimming their coats and as hats they were obviously people of substance. The weather was not cold by the standards of the locals, being well above freezing; but to those not long up from Mexico, however cold the desert nights might get, a constant lower temperature was noticeable. \"With luck we can celebrate Christmas with our people\" said Roberta. \"If all the connections are running\" said Joseph. \"If not, don't worry, Bobby: we'll celebrate Christmas late and with New Year together.\" \"And we won't get anywhere unless we get aboard before the wretched boat goes\" said Mortimer testily. \"Sorry Douglas\" said Roberta. \"Let us get on board; and stay above decks as much as we may. I have read too much of Mark Twain's books not to be nervous of an engine explosion such as killed his brother. Being shot by bandits is one thing; being boiled to death is another thing. It gives me a whole new perspective on the feelings of crawfish.\" Mortimer offered her his arm to mount the gangplank, smiling tenderly. His Roberta was game to go on a vessel that plainly disquieted her; and had she cried off and insisted on going by other means of transport he would have humoured that whim. Her pregnancy was causing her but few physical symptoms to date but he knew that ladies in a certain condition could get unexpected fancies and needed to be humoured. But her courage was unimpaired! Soon it would be possible to go easily by rail almost anywhere; the building of a bridge over the Mississippi was to be begun soon to carry a railroad; and that would be the only bridge south of St Louis to make a new connection. oOoOo The noise of the big side wheels beating through the water against the inexorable flow of the mighty river and the throb of the engine driving them were like a heart beat in the big vessel. It would take a couple of days to travel up to St Louis; and though there were perhaps more direct routes, Mortimer thought it might even so be the most efficient and certainly the easiest way to travel since the rail connections to be found in St Louis were extensive. Goods of all kinds as well as passengers were being transported on the decks; boxes of fruit, crates of chickens, kegs of kerosene, corn, live cattle – their pens looked none so secure – and alligator skins were among the things Roberta noticed. There was no real cargo hold as most of the ship was above the waterline, but the lower deck seemed given over largely to cargo, the passengers congregating on the upper deck and tending, those whose cabins were on the lower deck, to find it more convenient to descend to their cabins within the superstructure not by an external companion way. It was interesting to stand at the bow for a while to watch the ship start to make her way up river, the high protecting levees on each bank protecting the countryside beyond from all but the worst of the floods of the great waterway. And as the sun set the view across the wide landscape was spectacular with a sunset spreading across the whole horizon in a gaudy tapestry of scarlets, vermilions, oranges and gold, the clouds a dark skein of bruised purple against the vividly bleeding sky. It grew rapidly very cold and Roberta allowed Mortimer to draw her inside to the passenger lounge. There seemed to be a lot of gambling going on here; in fact it did not look much different to some of the saloons out west that she was used to. The obvious card sharp was not so obvious to some of the total rubes who were losing money hand over fist to him. Roberta watched and then turned to her husband. \"Douglas, I don't know that game\" she said in a clear, cheerful voice \"I never knew that it was allowed to make marks on the cards with fingernails, the gentleman with the burgundy coloured vest is much better at it than the other players, isn't he?\" The fight started right after the rubes had picked their jaws up off the floor. \"Minx\" said Mortimer. \"I don't like seeing people fleeced\" said Roberta \"And I didn't think the Anchor Line would like me to shoot him.\" \"Probably not\" said Mortimer \"I swear, Mrs Mortimer, you are more dangerous being a fluffy and empty headed lady than ever Snakekiller Bobby was.\" \"Well I have to have some hobbies in skirts\" said Roberta. oOoOo Stewards broke the fight up and the pack was examined. The Captain himself came, summoned to pass judgement, and the gamblers were ordered to take back whatever they had started out with and call it quits. The sharp was hustled off. Rumour had it that he was either thrown overboard or fed to a live gator being transported in the cargo; but Mortimer, who liked to make it his business to know everything, discovered that he was to be put off at the next stop unceremoniously and would be banned from Anchor Line ships at least forthwith. Gambling was a part of the revenue of the line; professionals paid a percentage of their winnings to the company for the privilege of holding court, as it were, with the passengers. A cheat however could only get the company a bad name. Whether other lines were warned about the man's behaviour would doubtless depend on the level of rivalry; though Mortimer privately thought that rivals or no, a sharp would be exposed in any case, since the river boats were all under threat from the ever expanding railway network. Doubtless the shipping companies would hope that he would take his cheating games onto long haul railway journeys. oOoOo Next morning the sun came up on the starboard bow like a golden dollar drowning in whiskey; and with it all the wild fowl on the river rose heavenwards in a cacophonous paean of praise to the morning, the honking raucous cries almost drowned out by the resounding drum-roll of thousands of beating wings. The golden sky turned black momentarily with the mass of flying bodies before they resolved themselves into their disparate skeins to go about their own business silhouetted against the brightness of the dawn. A few hardy souls were fishing off the levees; and children going to the fields to work waved to the boat. Roberta, one of the few to be abroad on deck, waved back. She had already breakfasted on coffee and poached eggs with bacon served with a good sized bowl of hominy grits flavoured with cracklins and hot corn bread dripping with butter; and felt well set up for the day. \"It's a good day when someone else prepares breakfast\" she said, laughing, to Amaryllis \"I hope we don't turn soft with hotel living and being carried by steamer.\" \"Somehow honey, I don' see yo' becomin' soft\" said Amaryllis. \"Gib'n half a chance I'd like to though.\" \"And so you shall\" said Roberta cheerfully. They watched a snag boat trawling the river for snags, dead tree branches that could stove in the hull of an unwary boat passing over them. The snag boat had a split bow and would manoeuvre over the snag, which was then lifted from the water with the A-frame crane that was mounted forward of the superstructure. Roberta thought it a pleasure to be able to see the snag boat at work, removing a large piece of tree; something new that she had never seen before. Presumably it was a common enough sight to those living on the shore of the river; there were a number of attractive houses with balconies and wide stoops and verandahs under the balconies. Roberta wondered cynically how often they flooded. At least the people of Memphis had resort to the mounds built by long ago Indians presumably because they had the sense to avoid the river instead of trying, like some latter day King Canute, to assume that a control of such technologies as steam meant that natural hazards might be ignored. oOoOo The boat stopped several times on its way north, though not for long at each stop; and Roberta took an instant dislike to the affected looking girl of about her own age who was issuing loud orders to the stewards and who called Joseph 'boy' and told him to bring her case for her. \"Why?\" said Joseph. \"What did your last servant die of that you can't manage a civil 'please' even?\" That he should refuse left the girl staring and open mouthed. Her rather protuberant pale blue eyes bulged yet further. \"I'll have you sacked!\" said the girl \"You filthy creature!\" \"Well that'll be a treat to see you try\" said Joseph \"Douglas, can you be sacked from holding shares in any venture?\" \"Nope\" said Mortimer \"Missy, try for some common sense; and don't try to be sassy with your elders and betters; it doesn't make you look big, only very, very childish.\" \"You can't talk to me that way!\" gasped the girl. \"And how can you call HIM my betters? He's only a…\" \"Brother of mine\" said Mortimer \"Funny though; I thought I just did talk to you that way\" and he turned away to fill his pipe. The girl stamped her foot; and looked at Roberta; who had the drop on her in terms of fashion accessories for being so recently clad. \"YOU look like a nice girl; you won't let those awful men behave like this will you?\" she said. Roberta regarded her. \"Sweetlips, I didn't like the way you addressed my brother-in-law nor the way you spoke to my husband and if I get another peep out of you on this voyage I'm going to drop your sorry ass in the mud\" said Roberta. This was the point at which the girl had hysterics. Mortimer strolled aft to the wheel. \"Any chance of sounding the hooter to drown that out?\" he said. The wheelsman grinned and pulled the string. The steam whistle was equal to the task of rendering the new passenger's hysterics entirely irrelevant. oOoOo The great arches of Eads Bridge in St Louis showed that the end of the journey was in sight. \"It was quite revolutionary when it was built around fifteen, sixteen years ago and is still impressive today\" said Mortimer, seeing Roberta's interest \"It was the first use of true steel in a major bridging project; the ribbed steel arch spans were considered pretty daring; and the use of cantilevers. It was one of the earliest uses of pneumatic caissons; I just lost you didn't I?\" \"Yes love\" said Roberta \"What is a caisson and why is a pneumatic one exciting?\" \"To drive the foundations of a bridge pier you need to have a watertight structure to go down into the river bed\" explained Mortimer. \"If they're shallow you can have them open at the top and just keep pumping water out; but this is soft mud and the caisson had to go deep. It's I think the deepest in the world. Then the top is sealed; the workers go in by a special chamber called an air lock, and compressed air is pumped in to keep mud and water out. It causes an awful crippling disease called caisson disease, which causes agonising pain and nobody knows why.\" \"They'd do better to find out and learn how to cure it rather than worry about more bridges until it's curable\" said Roberta \"Why will people work in such conditions if it causes such trouble?\" \"Because it's pay\" said Mortimer. \"And because it's at the edge of what man can achieve; and enough find that exciting enough to risk it. Engineers have suffered as well as labourers. It's a grand memorial to those who died.\" Roberta considered; and sniffed. \"Well that's a matter of opinion\" she said. \"Clever engineering is only clever when it becomes foolproof.\" \"Are you interested in the elephant?\" asked Mortimer. She eyed him suspiciously. \"You are not telling me that an elephant was a necessary adjunct to bridge building\" she said. \"No; but he was for the testing\" said Mortimer. \"It's said than an elephant will not walk on any structure that is unsafe; so an elephant was driven across the bridge to test it.\" \"I have a better test\" said Roberta. \"Go on then\" said Mortimer. \"Drive a load of lawyers and politicians onto the bridge. If it stays up, it's a good bridge. If it falls down it's a GREAT bridge.\" Mortimer laughed ruefully. \"You do have a point my dear\" he said.[Chapter 36] Chapter 36 St Louis was the noisiest place Roberta thought she had ever been. The sounds of shunting from the railroad were rivalled only by the many human cries and the sounds of coal rattling through chutes as it was transferred from the many mines of St Clair County; the packing factory had its own noise too. Wherever one went there was the sound of busy industry. The city itself was built on terraces well above the river, and this was an obvious advantage, because of the amount of springs that ran into the river that had been notable on the way in. Flooding was a real danger if a city was not high enough. Tall Brownstone buildings reached for the sky amongst the bustle, set firmly on their secure foundations. St Louis seemed everything a city should be. It was the end of the Riverboat trail; and the hub of more railways than Roberta know the names of. The self opinionated girl had of course disembarked here; bound, by all accounts for New York. She had looked for a moment as though she were about to make some ill natured remark as she swept past Roberta and the others; but Roberta glanced over at the evil smelling river mud and looked pointedly at her; and the girl hurried on without comment. Roberta was not sorry that they had likely seen the last of her. The street cars were prolific and plentiful; many steam powered, a revelation to Roberta, who had only seen horse drawn street cars to date; and the new electric lines that were being erected over the streets were apparently for the new electric street cars that would be faster and more economical than the steam powered ones. \"What a very modern and innovative city!\" marvelled Roberta \"I suppose one gets used to the noise of so much modern convenience!\" \"I prefer old fashioned inconvenience to live in myself\" said Mortimer \"Though I do like to rubberneck at the engineering marvels in a place like this.\" \"Old fashioned inconvenience has its place but be assured I will be making sure that our home has the latest of washing machines, sewing machines and a really good closed range for the convenience of myself and our servants\" said Roberta firmly. \"Oh as to that, I agree wholeheartedly\" said Mortimer \"And of course I will be sure that the cotton gin is as up to date as may be for the convenience of the workers. I only meant that such a place as this makes me feel like Yankee Doodle.\" \"Who swore he couldn't see the town there were too many houses\" said Roberta \"Yes; this is all engineering wonder and it's hard to see it as a place people live.\" Mortimer actually needed to check timetables here and work out carefully where they wished to go; with such a vast array of lines coming from all over, careful checking was required. oOoOo The work on a new station had not yet begun, but for the convenience of passengers an artist's impression of the mighty barrel-vaulted grand hall with Romanesque arches and stained glass windows had been painted, and a view of the exterior, with a massive clock tower so that nobody had any excuse to miss their train! It would incorporate an hotel as well. \"Good grief!\" said Roberta, studying the drawing \"It seems to me that the railway men of today are like the old royalty of the old world and this is one of their palaces!\" \"It sho' is grand!\" said Amaryllis, awed. \"Dat window has mos' elegant ladies on it\" \"It is the New Art style\" said Roberta \"That I have learned something about at school; pioneered in Europe by Mr Morris and taken up by others. It is very decorative; I like it.\" \"So long as you don't want stained glass windows in our house\" laughed Mortimer. \"Oh stained glass windows are all very well for public buildings; but in a private residence they cut out the light and make the whole point of having a window entirely irrelevant\" said Roberta. They had time in hand to eat; and found a restaurant that would seat them all together. There were a few curious and even slightly hostile glances their way, but the group was fairly inured to that. That they were plainly wealthy spoke louder than any other consideration. They went to the platform to make sure of being in plenty of time for the train; and because Roberta wanted to watch the plethora of trains pulling in and out, never colliding and all regulated as if they were toys operated by an unseen force to make them come and go on the proper lines at the proper time in a mechanical dance of precision. And on the track across from theirs Roberta saw an all too familiar figure before it was obscured by a plume of smoke from an incoming train. \"DOUGLAS!\" she cried \"It's Gellibrand!\" and looking quickly to make sure nothing was coming she pelted across the tracks. Mortimer followed her, Gellibrand was indeed on the other platform, about to board a train headed east; and Roberta almost ran into him as the smoke cleared. An angry comment on his lips at being so nearly cannoned into turned to a look of surprise; and lascivious pleasure. \"Wel, well WELL!\" he said \"If it isn't little Roberta!\" \"Mrs Mortimer to you, you fat creep\" said Roberta \"Are you coming quietly to be arrested?\" Mortimer had come up behind her by now. Gellibrand regarded him with loathing. \"You can't escape, Gellibrand\" said Mortimer. Gellibrand looked wildly about; and took the way out that neither Roberta nor her husband would have guessed, bowling right through a family of small children who appeared to be there to wave somebody off, leaping into the train almost through the person they were waving to. One of the little girls fell heavily, right between the train wheels as the whistle blew and the first movement of the rods announced its imminent departure. Roberta dived right after the child and threw her clear to Mortimer, rolling out of the way herself as the mighty engine's wheels thundered past her head. Her stylish chip hat had come off as she dived and was a casualty of the inexorable power of the steam locomotive, cut cleanly in half. Roberta shuddered, recalling that the child's arm had been right where her hat landed. She stayed crouched low as the carriages howled and thundered past as the train picked up speed, knowing that the suction of the passing coaches could still drag her under the train if she did not stay low. And then it was gone, carrying Gellibrand away. Roberta got up and brushed dust of her skirt. It would wash. She was embarrassed to find the small girl's mother kneeling to kiss her hands. \"I say! That's not necessary!\" said Roberta, taking the woman's hands to raise her. \"Miss yo' is de bravest woman dat ebba I seen\" said the woman, tears running down her dusky cheeks \"I thought, ma baby is gwine fo' sho', then you done saved her!\" \"That fat pig wouldn't have pushed her if we hadn't been trying to arrest him\" said Roberta \"It was my responsibility. Is she all right? Scared I expect; you'll want to take her to a wash room and clean her up some.\" \"Miss, I can't git over how you, a white lady who's sho' nuff wealthy, put yo'self out for ma baby!\" said the woman. Roberta leaned forward and kissed her cheek. \"Well, I'm expecting my first; and our babies are precious to all of us\" she said. \"You'll excuse me; I feel most shaky now it's over and I want to sit down!\" Mortimer picked her up and carried her unceremoniously to a seat. \"Don't frighten me like that again\" he said. \"What else was I to do?\" asked Roberta. He gave a rueful grin. \"Nothing else you could do\" he said. \"And far more important to save the child than go after that man. I'll wire to Manco what train he's on, and to Peters too; he might manage to wire to someone to meet him somewhere. It's worth a hope.\" \"What has he done?\" the small girl pulled Roberta's arm to ask, much to her mother's horror. Roberta put an arm around her. \"Well sweetie, he's been paying people very low wages, and as well as that he's been stealing guns from Uncle Sam to sell to foreigners so he's a great big traitor, and a thief and he's had men killed as well so he's also a murderer\" she said. \"But don't you worry; my husband here will wire a marshal we know who will have him arrested.\" \"Good\" said the little girl \"He done made me bump ma head and ma knee and darty ma dress!\" \"A very wicked man indeed\" said Roberta gravely. She was glad to sit quietly; her head swam and she felt quite sick. She was not hurt; she was athletic enough not to have strained anything in that mad dive, but the memory of the proximity of the thundering wheels made her feel light headed. Mortimer brought her a glass of water and added a generous nip from his hip flask. Roberta sipped it, shuddering. She still did not like the taste. \"You tell me if you feel any effects on baby\" said Mortimer in a low voice. Roberta blinked surprised. \"On baby? Why should it affect baby?\" she said. \"I understand a shock can make a woman miscarry\" said Mortimer. \"Stuff and nonsense\" said Roberta. \"Well it might with weak willed ninnies I suppose; but I thought you knew me better than that!\" \"I suppose I ought to\" said Mortimer ruefully. \"Damn right\" said Roberta \"Douglas, take this horrid stuff away and get me a nice cup of tea or coffee. I hate spirits.\" \"Yes ma'am\" said Mortimer. oOoOo They returned to their own platform and Roberta drank tea in the waiting room thankfully. Soon they would be on the last leg of the journey and then they would be back in Oak Grove; it seemed so long since she had been there! So much had happened in the past year or so; she was a different person to the determined but only too ignorant little girl who had run away; now she was a married woman, to be a mother; and had tasted the delights of the freedom of being a bounty hunter as Snakekiller Bobby! She would miss that. But at least her beloved Douglas did not expect her to be a demure stay-at-home wife doing nothing but sew a fine seam; she would leave that to Amaryllis who was – ironically perhaps! – far more suited to the life of a Southern Belle![Chapter 37] Chapter 37 Douglas Mortimer was particularly tender towards his wife on the last leg of the journey; though there had not been time to fear for her more than momentarily he had subsequently dwelled upon the thought of losing everything that was dearest to him in the whole world under the uncaring wheels of a locomotive. He would not have her be any other sort of girl of course; but it made her, and his child within her, all the more precious to him. Roberta was not averse; she had been badly shaken. \"Oh Douglas!\" she whispered \"This is so foolish! Why I was not even hurt; not like when I was shot; but I feel quite unnecessary!\" \"I suppose\" said Douglas \"We were too busy for you to worry over much when you got shot; and moreover it was a part of the way of life you had chosen. There's something inhumanly frightening about the power of machines perhaps.\" \"I suppose that may be it\" said Roberta \"I have time sitting in a railway carriage to brood – and to brood on what might have happened to that little girl. I never found out her name you know! But I think too it is because I have another to worry about as well as my own safety.\" He put an arm around her. \"I will do all I can to ensure the safety of both of you my love\" he said, wishing it did not sound and feel so inadequate. Roberta did not find it inadequate and sighed with satisfaction and leaned on him. \"You know just the right times to be protective, Douglas, and when to let me do what I know I can do\" she said \"It's nice to know that you respect me as well as love me. Do you think Peters will get Gellibrand?\" \"No\" said Mortimer. \"If I was him – and as you said he is a wily creature – I would jump train at an earlier stop than I initially intended and go by another route or hole up and go another time or to somewhere entirely different. Even supposing there's a law man ready to take him at the other end. I think he'll elude the law.\" \"Ah well\" said Roberta \"We'll just have to go after him ourselves. Though it will either have to be before I start to show or after baby is born.\" \"You are amazing!\" said Mortimer, ignoring the carriage full of people to kiss his wife and caring nothing for any censorious comments that might be made! oOoOo The very final part of the journey was accomplished by horse and carriage; and having arranged ahead by telegraph for the feast to be taken on by carrier, Mortimer purchased a carriage and good horses since he doubted Gellibrand had any idea how to pick good horseflesh. It was certainly less chilly here than in the interior of the country which had been very cold; and Roberta looked out of the window at the familiar and yet somehow unfamiliar landscape. Mortimer pulled up at her parents' house. \"We need to get this over\" he said. Roberta pulled a face but nodded. The butler let them in, grinning all over his face. \"Miss 'Berta, large as life!\" he said. \"I always knowed you'd be safe!\" \"Ben, didn't father and mother apprise you of that?\" said Roberta \"I wrote to them some time since to tell them that I was married to Colonel Mortimer here.\" \"Well Ben\" said Mortimer \"I recall you well enough; you've clipped my ears and Joseph's for trespassing in Roberta's grandfather's woods before now.\" Ben grinned again. \"Yessir, that I recall well too!\" he said \"Yo' people will be right glad to have yo' back, sir!\" Leroy Everard was sour looking. \"Well Leroyna, I can't say that I'm pleased\" he said \"I'm not even sure that a runaway marriage like yours is legal!\" \"It is in Arizona where it took place and full faith and credence dictates that it is so here too\" said Roberta. \"And besides we can afford better lawyers than you.\" Her father went purple. Roberta grinned. \"Oh Roberta, you worried us so!\" whined her mother. \"And to marry a man so much older than you!\" \"Well you worried me in not standing up to father over forcing me to marry Gellibrand\" said Roberta \"Who's older than my Douglas. And certainly not as much a man\" she added. \"AND he's a proven traitor. I'd watch your step, father: if anyone thought you, as so close a crony of his, was consorting with his business schemes….\" \"You wouldn't dare, you little snake!\" hissed her father. \"Try me\" said Roberta. \"Now y'all must excuse us; my husband and I have a homecoming to see to. Farewell; but don't expect me to feel too fond. Good afternoon.\" \"Well done\" said Mortimer after they had left. \"I wanted to HIT him\" said Roberta. \"I was more concerned you might shoot him; the congratulations were for managing not to\" said Mortimer, dryly. oOoOo Oakridge House stood as the name implied on a ridge. Oak trees stood around it and too ringed the plantation and made up much of the woods that also belonged to the house, where Roberta knew that birch, maple and sycamore also grew. The house was much in the colonial style with a big portico held up with classical columns in the Ionic style, and long sash windows piercing the white stone walls. Steps down from the portico were edged by colonnades which continued in a sweep around to enclose a paved area under the windows, which on the ground floor opened out onto this paved area. One side was fully lit though it was not yet dark, the crepuscular hour approaching fast however. This was the ballroom where the feast was to be held. Mortimer handed Roberta out of the coach; then swept her up in his arms to carry her over the threshold as if she were as light as thistledown; and put her down to lead her into the ballroom where all the workers were gathered on his orders. Roberta had dressed for the occasion as her new people were owed as pretty a bride as she could be; and her happiness made her as much a beauty as any had ever seen, even though Roberta privately thought that Amaryllis was the lovely one of the two of them! Roberta was in cornflower blue silk garnitured with a ruched silk ribbon in darker blue with a fine gold line in it. Her fichu was snowy white lace. Amaryllis was in dusky rose silk trimmed with white lace and Roberta thought that nobody could look as stylish! She felt fine enough however not to feel too intimidated by so many people that she must come to know; and smiled upon them as they stared at the newcomers. The entire of the Plantation workers were black; a sea of dark faces greeted the Colonel and his wife and party; the older ones smiling, the younger ones uncertain. There had been, according to the lawyer's report, a white steward whose own actions had not born investigating; and who had left in the middle of the night with as many negotiable small valuables as he could manage. \"Howdy all\" said Mortimer \"I'm Douglas Mortimer; this is my wife, Roberta, my half brother Joseph and our niece Amaryllis. Along here we have Miss Preston who is going to be running a school for all the children on the plantation and such other local children as care to attend. Joseph, whom you all know, is going to be my steward. Now I've read myself in as they say at sea, I'll beg you excuse me because I want to see Mammy Beth.\" \"Mr Douglas, Ah is right heyah!\" The woman was old and walked with the difficulty of rheumatism; and Douglas swept her right into his arms. \"Mammy, I'm home, and I'm home for good!\" he said \"Well, barring the odd excursion! Come and give my wife a hug; you know Roberta, for surely you've heard about her from Amaryllis!\" \"Sho' Ah have, honeychile\" said Mammy enfolding Roberta into an embrace \"And Ah'm that glad t'see Mr Douglas so happy - and ma Joseph lookin' weller than ever so long!\" \"Comes of managing to split on that creature Gellibrand, ma\" said Joseph. \"Now what about that feast? Miss Preston, you'll do me the honour of letting me lead you in to eat?\" \"I'd be delighted, Mr Mortimer\" said Julia demurely. Roberta raised an eyebrow. THAT might be difficult to handle. Well enough to worry about anything that happened in the future when it happened. The feast was a spread. The eyes of the children were wide! \"We got everything that sounded nice\" said Mortimer \"And a proper Christmas goose or several for this combined homecoming and Christmas feast with I don't know how many kinds of stuffing; and all the trimmings. Permit me to drink a toast to you all; and to the way we're going to lick this place into shape. To Oakridge Plantation and all its people!\" The toast was drunk rather gingerly. The children were drinking it in ginger beer; and, it may be said, so was Roberta. She liked it better than wine or beer. \"To the Colonel!\" called Joseph. That was drunk to with more enthusiasm as the first swallow went down. \"And his wife and future generations!\" added Amaryllis. Roberta blinked. \"Speech!\" shouted someone. \"I don't want to be long winded or the food will get cold\" said Mortimer \"But things will change and you will be getting a better deal; the New Year will see a new broom. And you'll be up for shares to; so what you put in, you will get out. I'll explain that properly another time. Will my wife have a word or two?\" Roberta rose. \"I'm delighted to come home here\" she said \"And to know that we're all safe from Gellibrand; and I'm glad to be mistress of the house married to its rightful owner not, as my father initially planned, married to Gellibrand. However we do NOT want to waste the good food; so I urge you to dig in and enjoy; and note that we sent to England for the jams, preserves and jellies for your bread and to eat with the fowl. If I may offer a toast to Wilkin and Sons of Tiptree – to the Jelly Brand you can trust in!\" There was a moment's silence then a roar of laughter. \"Oh very well done my dear\" said Mortimer. \"You have made yourself theirs by sharing a joke. It was the worst pun I ever heard.\" \"Thank you Douglas\" said Roberta. oOoOo Much later, after having decided to get acquainted with the big bed in the master bedroom, Mortimer listened as the long case clock struck midnight. \"Merry Christmas my darling\" he said. \"Merry Christmas, Douglas\" said Roberta. \"Now how about you come right here and give me a Christmas present?\" Douglas Mortimer of Oakridge House, Oak Grove, North Carolina, home at last, did just that. The End for Now A/N sycamore to an American is the Platanus Americana, NOT what a Brit would call a sycamore which is the Acer pseudoplatanus. When in America use American nomenclature.
