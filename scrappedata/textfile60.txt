[{"Movie":"Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagir...","Title":"Always Love You","Author":"iamnoelle6","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6082621","Passage":"[Chapter 1] Sharkboy and Lavagirl Ok, so I saw some of the stories for here, and I write some Twilight stories, um, please read this, because I think you may like it a lot! Love you all for reading. Rated 'T' for language. Sharkboy/lava girl, sort of plot less, so if you want a plot, then sorry. This is just a one-shot, sorry. Lavagirl's POV Ahh, planet drool. Ever since Max came and visited, everything has been running amazingly. Kids are happy here and the ice princess and I are sort of friends I guess. We talk, but well, we aren't really friends. We are supposed to be enemies, but I don't care, she can be nice. My now boyfriend, wow. Sharkboy and I just got together a few months ago. We live happily in Planet Drool with Max only visiting, well, I haven't seen him ever since before Sharkboy and I got together, together. I ran down the volcano and to the beach in between the ocean and my volcanoes. I smiled as I saw Sharkboy walking up the shore. My heart started to flutter. This has been happening often. \" Hey.\" Sharkboy said with a smile and gave me a quick kiss on the lips. The only problem about me being light or heat and Sharkboy being water is that we could never really kiss for that long. Well, I could, just it would be hard for Sharkboy since its sensitive for that. \" Hey sharky.\" I whispered. \" What do you want to do today?\" He asked flashing his big and bright smile. Now that is light. \" I don't know.\" I said quietly. \" Hmm, well you are looking amazing today.\" I blushed. The only thing about my blushing is that it turns really red, like bright! \"I love it when you blush. It's so beautiful. Just like you of coarse.\" I smiled and blushed even more. Sharkboy caressed my cheek softly and made it colder. \" Thanks. You look great too. What were you thinking of doing?\" he smiled devilishly. That sort of made me scared for some reason. \" Well, would you want to just do a picnic, right here.\" Suddenly he was gone. I looked around. \" Sharky? Sharkboy this isn't funny! Where the hell are you?\" I said whipping myself around in circles. \" Right here.\" He whispered behind me into my ear that made me shiver. I never shiver! I smiled. \"I love your smile.\" He complimented. He took my hand and brought me to a table right behind us. \"Sushi?\" He asked. I flinched at him asking me this. \" Sushi? Sharky, I love you, but sushi isn't always the best thing…\" I trailed off at seeing his smile grow wider and him laugh and shake his head. \" This is good sushi. Not as raw really.\" he said to me as he sat down. He pulled out a plate that was filled with sushi that was raw pieces of fish, but they were rapped in sticky and burned rice and seaweed. Just how I like it. \"I made Max dream me up some. It took a lot of work.\" He said with a smile. \"and then water, hot tea for you.\" he said pulling out a cup of water and a hot cup with a tea packet. I loved tea for some reason. \" Thanks so much. You know, this is the sweetest thing that you have ever done.\" I complimented touching his hand softly. \" I wanted today to be special.\" I looked at him in confusion. \"Its our anniversary. Our six month anniversary. I told you I would do something special to you for like a week.\" He said. He sounded a little upset. \" I'm sorry. I didn't remember. I wasn't paying attention probably. I was probably looking at how amazing your smile is.\" I complimented trying to get me to see his smile again. \" Well, all you need is some seaweed and some slime and that makes your teeth clean. The smelling good is hard, I just eat some mint leaves which surprisingly grow around here.\" He said smiling now. \" Happy six month anniversary.\" I whispered. \" you too. How have I become so lucky?\" He whispered to himself while he put sushi in his mouth. I smiled. \" I got lucky here. Look, the sun is just about to set.\" I said pointing over at the horizon of the beach. He smiled. \" Come on.\" He said holding out his hand. I grabbed it but didn't wrap my hand around it. We walked closer to the water but not too close. We sat as we saw the waves crashing and coming close to us. A large wave crashed and it began coming really close. \" Sharkboy…Sharkboy.\" I whispered as it came closer. I got up and ran back a bit. \" Come here, its safe. It can't get to us.\" Sharkboy reassured me. He reached out his hand and gestured for me to come over to him. I smiled and walked over to him. I trust him. \"Come here.\" He said opening his arms. \" I don't think I should…\" he smiled. \" Just stay relaxed, and it would be worth it, just knowing I have you and I can keep you. Come here.\" He demanded sweetly. I smiled and leaned into his arms. I stayed nice and relaxed so I wouldn't burn him. \" this is nice.\" I whispered. \" It is. Your amazing, Lavagirl.\" I smiled as he kept bringing the compliments. \" If there was a Shark girl would you date her instead of me.\" He pulled away a short distance just so I could see him roll his eyes. \" How could I ever do that. If you would have maybe asked me a year ago I probably would have said, what? Where? Now, that's a really dumb question. I love you, I wouldn't trade you for the world.\" He said laying back as it became night time. I was the only thing bright, still glowing, still alive. \"Would you leave me if there was a lavaboy?\" He quizzed. \" Oh yeah.\" I said sarcastically. \"No, I couldn't ever be with anyone but you. I love you Sharky.\" I said and kissed his lips. This time, instead of just a peck, it went deep. His tongue licked my bottom lips asking for entrance, I granted it with no hesitation. I moaned loudly in the kiss and I could feel his corners of his lips creep up. I pulled away. \" You're a good kisser.\" he complimented. I laughed. \" you too. Hmm, I love you so much.\" I whispered. \" Me too. You are the only person in my life. I promise. I will always love you. I don't need anyone but you.\" He said and kissed my neck. \" you know, I have never seen such a sweet side of you.\" He smiled and rolled his eyes following with a shrug. \"I sort of like it.\" He chuckled. \" Don't get too used too it.\" He whispered. His lips connected with mine. And we kept kissing until this dream would end. Hopefully never. Sharkboy, I will never leave you either. Always love you. THE END Okay, so let me know what you think. Yes, it is short, but I really ran out f things to sort of do, so it is really romantic type things. So review if you liked it…: ) or review if you hated it…: ( Just let me know your opinion!

Images flooded his mind every time he closed his eyes. Haunting images that would never leave his mind for the rest of his life. Sharkboy had been in this state for much too long now, only hiding it when others were around. Even Lavagirl. Especially Lavagirl. He kept on trying to close his eyes and relax, but his mind wouldn't shut down. It was taunting him, keeping him from living a normal life. It was driving him crazy. He felt a hot tear escape from his tightly shut eyes and slipping down the side of his cheek, but he didn't make a sound, just laying there on the sand of the beach. The stars were glittering brightly in the dark heavens above, the beautiful crescent moon smiling down upon the planet of dreams. But not even that could distract him. He felt a slight source of heat, the smell of somehow-sweet magma reaching him. He shot up into a sitting position, concerned that she might see the dried tracks of occasional tears on his cheeks. \"Hey.\" Oh, how he had feared many times that he might not hear that sweet, light voice again, a laugh almost always hidden in it. \"Hey,\" he said, his own voice gruff and slightly hoarse. He cleared his throat and cursed himself for appearing so weak in front of her. She sat down next to him, her natural heat enveloping him in a comforting embrace. Shure, he'd admit it: she made him feel better without saying a word. She comforted him without even touching him. She could warm his heart and brighten his day with something as simple as a smile. She was his whole world. And he couldn't shake the horrible guilt about the fact that he had almost lost that. \"What're you doing out here? Souldn't you be home?\" He was quiet for a moment. \"Couldn't sleep,\" he mumbled. She didn't immediately reply. After a few minutes of silence, he turned his head, catching the knowing look she was giving him. \"What?\" She frowned. \"Sharky.\" He stayed silent. \"You know I can see right through you, you can't lie to me.\" It was true. She knew him better than anyone else, perhaps even Max. He has never succeeded in lying to her in the past. \"Then what do you see?\" he wispered, lying back on the sand. She followed him, lying down next to him. \"Something's bothering you. Has been for a while now.\" Of course she would know. In the corner of his eye, he could see concern flickering across her face as she saw the traces of tears on his cheeks. \"What's wrong?\" she asked softly, and he could feel her hand gently nudging against his. He complied, cautiously slipping his hand into hers and thankfully finding that she has cooled down. Thier fingers intertwined and he relaxed. He turned his head to face away from her, afraid that she might see the obvious hurt in his expression. There was just no way he could tell her, she would just be reminded of how stupid and selfish he really is. He hadn't been thinking of anyone but himself that day, but he regretted it now. Because of his ignorance, because of his temper. His selfishness. Had he listened to her, none of that wouldhave happened, and she wouldn't have... He growled, grabbing a fistfull of sand with his unoccupied hand. \"Sharks, hey. It's alright, just calm down.\" He hadn't realized his grip might be too strong until he heard the slight strain in her voice. He quickly dropped her hand and sat back up. He clenched his teeth, the sharp edges nearly touching the roof of his mouth. He felt like kicking himself! When would he stop thinking about himself?! He felt his teeth sharpen as anger boiled up inside him. \"Woah, Sharky! Calm down, you might break something.\" He calmed himself a little, but not without punching the sand next to him as hard as he could. Lavagirl was quiet for a few minutes, although he wasn't shure wether it was out of fear or to let him cool off. When he sighed, she put a hand on his shoulder. \"Sharkboy. You don't have to tell me if you don't want to, but if there's any way I can help-\" He immediately felt himself snap. Her? Helping him?! When it was actually all his fault?! That just wasn't fair to her! \"I can't stop!\" he barked, making her shrink back. He sighed in defeat, turning his face downwards. \"I...I can't stop,\" he repeated softly. \"I just can't stop hurting you.\" \"What?\" she said, sounding quite surprised. He couldn't believe she could be so oblivious. \"I killed you!\" He was absolutely furious now. \"I lost my temper, got myself into shit and you just wanted to help. I killed you, Lavagirl! If I hadn't acted like such an ass, you wouldn't have had to save my butt!\" At the moment he was at the brink of suicide. \"I friggin killed you! Aren't you...I don't know, mad at me, at least?\" He huffed, glaring at his boots. Maybe she would kill him, or even blast him with lava, at least. She was probably planning some sort of revenge or something. ... Silence. ... \"Sharky.\" He could hear her sitting right next to him, almost against him. But he didn't respond. He didn't notice her hand sneaking toward him unil she had already turned his head towards her, and then she kissed him. He was almost positive that his heart was about to explode from exellerating a thousand times so suddenly. It was a soft, sweet kiss. He couldn't help but relax, letting the entire world fall away as he slowly put his arm around her waist and his other hand rested on her cheek. He felt her arms snaking around his neck. She was cooled enough not to burn him, but warm enough for him to take comfort in holding her. When she pulled away, she pulled him closer and buried her face in his shoulder. \"It wasn't your fault,\" she whispered. \"You saved me then, anyway, right? That's all that matters.\" Sharkboy held her even closer. \"I would always protect you,\" he replied softly. \"Even if it means giving you my life, I will always be there for you. No matter what.\" AN: Yes, this story is, in fact, also on my Wattpad account. But, I felt like putting it on fanfiction, for some reason...I don't know... ...I'm bored... Anyway, hoped you enjoyed that story, and if you have ANY questions at all, wether you don't know what a word means, or I might've misspelled something, just lemme know. Also, ideas for other stories are more than welcome. Thanks, bye! !Watcha!","LastChapter":"It was probably around midnight, but he could never sleep.

No matter what.\" AN: Yes, this story is, in fact, also on my Wattpad account. But, I felt like putting it on fanfiction, for some reason...I don't know... ...I'm bored...

Pairings: Sharkboy and Max. Takes place three years after the movie. Sharkboy is 16 and Max is 15. The kiss had been an accident. It wasn't meant to happen, and I in no way wanted it to happen…at least that's what I keep telling myself… I had once again visited Max, because Lavagirl had left me to myself and I was bored out of my mind. So I, like every other time, went to visit the little twerp. I know, I know, I shouldn't call my friend a twerp but let's face it, he's not the coolest guy… Anyway, I walked into his room, after acknowledging my fish friends in the aquarium, and found myself smelling an intoxicating aroma. I felt my stomach churn as I followed the stench… It was coming from Max's mouth. Max was soundlessly sleeping in his bed as I crawled over the edge of the bed to study him. Why was he reeking of fish…? Why was it so…so intoxicating? My stomach churned again as the boy moaned while rolling onto his back. So intoxicating… The churning continued as the boy panted heavily with another moan. His breath washed over me making my eyes roll into the back of my head. I could hear a faint voice telling me to stop and pull back, but my shark senses threw me forward. I landed on top of the boy making him quickly yelp in surprise and awake. He looked at me with wide eyes as I straddled his lap \"S-Sharkboy…?\" He asked unsure as my teeth bared. \"Intoxicating\" I hissed as I smashed my mouth against his. I inhaled the aroma as my lips and tongue washed over him. Max squirmed a bit at first but settled down and, to my surprise, pushed forward. My hands wandered over him as he panted while deepening the kiss. I pulled back and then started attacking his neck, leaving small bites along his jaw. \"W-what are you…?\" He said trailing off as I returned back to his mouth. Max ran his hands through my hair as he thrust his hips into mine. His groin slammed into mine making me realize how hard I was. I wanted to take him, I wanted to…to… Suddenly I jumped back with a gasp. What…what was I doing? Max gasped loudly and looked at me with huge eyes. He panted as sweat ran down his forehead. \"W-what…was that?\" He asked slowly as I tried to restrain myself from pouncing back. \"Shark frenzy\" I shot back quickly. \"B-but you kissed me\" He said back as his face blushed. I felt myself blush as well but ignored it. \"Well, you didn't stop me\" \"…I didn't, did I?\" \"W-why?\" I asked wanting a real answer. Why had he kissed back, why had he allowed me… \"It felt good\" He answered as his eyes fell to the floor. I gulped as Max turned into a darker scarlet. \"…it felt…\" \"Hot\" I shot out before thinking. Max looked up at me suddenly with a look of awe making me gulp again nervously. \"H-hot?\" \"I have to go\" I said before dashing out the window. As I ran to the spacecraft I heard Max yelling after me. I knew it wasn't right to leave like that, but I had to get away…if I had stayed, or if I had continued…I would have… I would have fucked his brains out. That's how I ended up here… I sat down on the rocks and watched the seas; my shark friends were off with my newly found father doing who knows what. Our reunion was touching and I've never felt happier…but now I am utterly confused. \"Hey, Sharky\" Lava girl greeted as she appeared next to me. \"Hey LG\" I said back. \"Where's your dad?\" \"Off with crunch, bite, and shred\" I said referring to my shark friends. \"Something wrong?\" She then asked a bit worried. \"No\" I lied defensively. \"I know, you're lying and I know you're upset, so just tell me what happened\" \"I can't\" I said sadly. \"Why not, I thought we were best friends\" \"We are but…I did something bad, something unforgivable\" \"Like what?\" \"I…err…well, I kinda went to visit Max…\" \"So?\" She interrupted after waiting several more seconds for me to continue \"And I kinda lost control…\" \"You shredded his room again!\" She hollered out in disbelief as she stood on her feet in anger. \"No\" I shot back as I prepared myself for a lava blast. \"Then what did you do!\" \"I kissed him!\" I hollered out before I clasped my mouth with both of my hands. I stared at Lavagirl for a few seconds, awaiting a burst of anger but she just burst out into laughter. My face heated up as the girl fell to the floor in hysterics making my fists tighten. \"Stop laughing\" I hollered with another blush. \"B-but it's so funny\" She said in between laughs. \"No its not, this is serious\" I shot back. After a few minutes she calmed down and re-stood and then gripped my shoulders. \"So what made you finally do it?\" She asked as she looked me in the eyes. \"Finally?\" I asked back in shock. \"Come on Sharky, it was so obvious that you liked him\" She said with a grin. \"What are you talking about? I don't like him\" \"Sure you do, after all when you use to like me you would treat me like I didn't matter\" She said making me nod. Despite that dating and break up phase we managed to remain friends. \"Okay\" \"Well, you treat Max like you don't care about him but we all know you do. Face it Sharky you like him and he likes you\" \"Even if that was true hothead, how would you know if he liked me back?\" \"Because I've seen the way he looks at you, when you guys first met he looked up to you and despite how vicious you were to him he stayed\" I rolled my eyes and then looked at the sea. \"I can't like him…\" I muttered under my breath. \"Why not?\" \"Because he's human and I could hurt him. I mean Christ; I almost raped him last night\" \"Wait, you almost raped him!\" She hollered in utter shock. \"But I didn't\" I shot back as a defense. \"But you wanted to?\" She asked with a smirk. I nodded and then looked at the ocean. \"So did he kiss you back?\" She asked with a hopeful smile. \"Actually…he did\" \"Then he likes you too\" After that Lavagirl forced me to go back to Earth to see Max. Despite everything she said I was freakin nervous about it all. I opened his window slowly and to my surprise found Max sitting at his desk writing. He didn't turn to look at me so I realized he hadn't heard me. I crept forward and read over the paper he was writing, 'He's cute and witty, but full of stupidity and despite it all I have fallen for him. Sharkboy is his name and for this my heart is to blame.' \"Hey Max\" I greeted making the boy jump from his seat. He fell to the floor with a thud and quickly crumpled the paper he held. \"Hi\" He said as my heart lurched. I've never noticed how adorable he was… \"So…you think I'm cute?\" I asked making his cheeks heat up more. \"D-depends…\" He answered slowly. \"On what?\" I asked curiously. \"O-on whether you think I'm…cute\" \"Oh…\" I said with a blank face. \"I don't\" I shot out making his face fall a bit. He looked at the floor and then nodded to himself as he began heading to his bed. But in a quick flash I turned him around and threw him onto it. I quickly jumped on him and sat down as he looked up at me; our groins were once again straddling each other. \"I think you're adorable\" I said with a seductive grin before I captured his lips for the second time. After a couple of seconds he twitched under me and then pushed my face away. I looked at him hurt but found his eyes scanning me. \"What?\" I asked unsure. \"What are we doing?\" He asked innocently. \"Well, I'm surrendering to my urges on you\" I answered with a smirk making his cheeks grow red. \"No, I mean what are we…?\" \"You want to know if I like you, huh?\" I asked cutting him off. He looked up at me for a few seconds and then nodded a yes. \"Well…let this be your answer\" I said as I leaned over to his ear \"I've wanted to fuck the shit out of you for the longest time.\" With that said I pounced back onto him and sucked on his lip as he moaned beneath me.

There was now a peach tree outside of a cave near the ocean. That cave was where Sharkboy and Lavagirl lived. Some afternoons Lavagirl would sit under the tree and read. Some mornings Sharkboy would sit under the tree and look at the ocean. Some nights they would sit under the tree together, both wanting to scoot closer to the other. Neither of them ever did. One night something changed. Lavagirl walked out onto the beach. She looked out into the ocean and screamed Sharkboy's name. When she saw his shiny fin gently gliding towards her, she smiled straight from her heart. When he arrived on land, he raised an eyebrow and said \"what\". Lavagirl's heart sank at the mere sound of his voice. Then she responded, \"It's getting dark, I was worried,\" \"Don't worry about me I have the sharks, you are the one unprotected\" he said warm heartedly. When they sat down it was much more awkward than usual. Trying desperately to break the silence, Lavagirl asked, \"You like the Ice Princess, huh?\" Sharkboy gave a dry smirk and said, \"Not really, I mean she is pretty but she never smiles and she is always gloomy,\" Lavagirl sat up straight and smiled hearing that last remark \"oh?\" she said trying not to make herself too obvious. Time passed and no one said a word. Then, the strangest thing happened. Sharkboy put his arm around Lavagirl. Lavagirl could have sworn she just stopped breathing. Than she leaned in to kiss Sharkboy. As her lips met something spiked, she realized that he had turned his head away knowing what she was trying to do. She just kissed Sharkboy's head! Why hadn't he wanted to kiss her? Was there something wrong with her? Lavagirl trembled as she realized a tear was flowing down her face. She tried to hide her face in her hands. Sharkboy already noticed and felt so bad. She got up and began to run for the cave. She was humiliated could she ever be friends with Sharkboy again? Does he hate her? Will she have to move out? Then she felt a mass on her shoulder. It was like the 1 Jonas fan getting her hand touched by Nick himself! Sharkboy had grabbed her shoulder to stop her from running. It worked too well. She was standing there shaking like a cold Chihuahua under his hold. Wow, his cold hand felt good on her hot shoul-. Wait. Wait. Wait. Why wasn't she burning him!? Oh, yea… she was sucking on ice. She tended to do that while reading. \"LG, wait!\" Sharkboy took too long to say. Guess he felt it ,too! She turned around and said \"what Sharkboy, what reason do I have to wait!?\" All he could think was \"Wow she looks pretty!\". \" Umm, Sharky? You alive?\" she asked sincerely unaware of what he was currently thinking. \"Huh? Oh, um… yea I'm fine.\" he said snapping back into reality. \"You were saying …\" she guided. \"Lavagirl… you are so special to me that I can hardly find the words to describe it! When I look at your face and I remember all the times we have had together, you make me feel…\" he looked around in desperate search for something. His eyes landed upon the peach tree. He finished his statement \"… peaches, you make me feel peaches!\". She looked at him confused \" Peaches Sharky, really?\" she asked. \"Yea, peaches are warm, soft, and fuzzy… the way you make me feel\" he said sure as could be. Lavagirl looked at him with a smile the size of Russia and said \"Sharkboy that is the… sweetest thing anyone has ever said to me! I love you too… Sorry I got caught up, you probably don't love me, just like me.\" Her cheeks turned bright red and she looked down, smile faded. Sharkboy took her chin in his hands and lifted her head to look at him. \"I love you, don't ever doubt that\" he said to her. He then captured her lips in a kiss. Both went to sleep that night, and wind whistled through the branches of the peach tree, as if to say \"something simple can mean so much to one in search of love\".","LastChapter":"Okay, if you read Teen Titans then you probably are thinking \"OFF WITH HER HEAD!\", but I am really stuck in terms of where to go with \"Through Masked Eyes\".

There was now a peach tree outside of a cave near the ocean. That cave was where Sharkboy and Lavagirl lived. Some afternoons Lavagirl would sit under the tree and read. Some mornings Sharkboy would sit under the tree and look at the ocean. Some nights they would sit under the tree together, both wanting to scoot closer to the other. Neither of them ever did. One night something changed. Lavagirl walked out onto the beach. She looked out into the ocean and screamed Sharkboy's name. When she saw his shiny fin gently gliding towards her, she smiled straight from her heart. When he arrived on land, he raised an eyebrow and said \"what\". Lavagirl's heart sank at the mere sound of his voice. Then she responded, \"It's getting dark, I was worried,\" \"Don't worry about me I have the sharks, you are the one unprotected\" he said warm heartedly. When they sat down it was much more awkward than usual. Trying desperately to break the silence, Lavagirl asked, \"You like the Ice Princess, huh?\" Sharkboy gave a dry smirk and said, \"Not really, I mean she is pretty but she never smiles and she is always gloomy,\" Lavagirl sat up straight and smiled hearing that last remark \"oh?\" she said trying not to make herself too obvious. Time passed and no one said a word. Then, the strangest thing happened. Sharkboy put his arm around Lavagirl. Lavagirl could have sworn she just stopped breathing. Than she leaned in to kiss Sharkboy. As her lips met something spiked, she realized that he had turned his head away knowing what she was trying to do. She just kissed Sharkboy's head! Why hadn't he wanted to kiss her? Was there something wrong with her? Lavagirl trembled as she realized a tear was flowing down her face. She tried to hide her face in her hands. Sharkboy already noticed and felt so bad. She got up and began to run for the cave. She was humiliated could she ever be friends with Sharkboy again? Does he hate her? Will she have to move out? Then she felt a mass on her shoulder. It was like the 1 Jonas fan getting her hand touched by Nick himself! Sharkboy had grabbed her shoulder to stop her from running. It worked too well. She was standing there shaking like a cold Chihuahua under his hold. Wow, his cold hand felt good on her hot shoul-. Wait. Wait. Wait. Why wasn't she burning him!? Oh, yea… she was sucking on ice. She tended to do that while reading. \"LG, wait!\" Sharkboy took too long to say. Guess he felt it ,too! She turned around and said \"what Sharkboy, what reason do I have to wait!?\" All he could think was \"Wow she looks pretty!\". \" Umm, Sharky? You alive?\" she asked sincerely unaware of what he was currently thinking. \"Huh? Oh, um… yea I'm fine.\" he said snapping back into reality. \"You were saying …\" she guided. \"Lavagirl… you are so special to me that I can hardly find the words to describe it! When I look at your face and I remember all the times we have had together, you make me feel…\" he looked around in desperate search for something. His eyes landed upon the peach tree. He finished his statement \"… peaches, you make me feel peaches!\". She looked at him confused \" Peaches Sharky, really?\" she asked. \"Yea, peaches are warm, soft, and fuzzy… the way you make me feel\" he said sure as could be. Lavagirl looked at him with a smile the size of Russia and said \"Sharkboy that is the… sweetest thing anyone has ever said to me! I love you too… Sorry I got caught up, you probably don't love me, just like me.\" Her cheeks turned bright red and she looked down, smile faded. Sharkboy took her chin in his hands and lifted her head to look at him. \"I love you, don't ever doubt that\" he said to her. He then captured her lips in a kiss. Both went to sleep that night, and wind whistled through the branches of the peach tree, as if to say \"something simple can mean so much to one in search of love\".","Summary":" Okay, if you read Teen Titans then you probably are thinking \"OFF WITH HER HEAD!\", but I am reall","MetaData":"Rated: Fiction  K - English - Romance -  Sharkboy, Lavagirl  - Words: 790 - Reviews: 11 - Favs: 28 - Follows: 3 - Published: 2 20 2010 - Status: Complete - id: 5762801 "},{"Movie":"Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagir...","Title":"7 more reasons and responses","Author":"ThornyRose463","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8413879","Passage":"[Chapter 1] 1-Mash name \"People will probably want to give us a mash name, like 'Sharkgirl' or 'Lavaboy'.

Thanks so much for the continued support, you're my first reviewer ever! Enjoy! \"Is the launchpad ready?\" \"Check.\" \"Security's good?\" \"Check.\" \"You're a buttface?\" \"Check.\" Lavagirl turned around, a smug smile on her lips. Of course, Sharkboy was in his seat, playing with the PSP he got from Max. She walked over to him, placing a hand on the device and lowering it to get his attention. \"Toys put away?\" He smiled and rolled his eyes, putting it back in his pocket. \"Check,\" he stated pointedly, making her smile in satisfaction and turn back to the controls. \"Well, everything seems to be in order, so we're ready to go.\" Lavagirl was just about to turn to her seat when she remembered. \"Oh! We forgot the mechanical gloves Max wanted us to bring to earth.\" Since Max's powers only worked on Planet Drool, sometimes they had to help out when he needed something he had dreamt up. Lavagirl quickly turned to the door, but stopped in her tracks when she reached it, turning around to where Sharkboy was sitting. \"Uhm, where is it again?\" Sharkboy stood up and walked up to her. \"Oh, I put it back on the display after I tested it.\" Her perky smile returned and she went out and to the lab. As promised, the red-and-black super strength gloves were on the pedestal where she had last seen them. She quickly grabbed them and sped back to the rocket like a hyper puppy. As she walked up the metal slope to the entrance, she noticed Sharkboy standing in the door. She brushed off the fluttering inside her stomach when she noticed him staring at her. She slowed her pace when she reached him, brushing past him while trying to ignore the feeling it gave her when his hand lightly touched her waist to escort her into the room, her hand automatically landing on his chest. For a brief moment, their eyes met. At first it seemed like it would go on forever, but Sharkboy turned away, walking further into the rocket's main room. Lavagirl felt like she should probably forget what had happened, but as she sat down and secured herself, she knew she couldn't. Sharkboy stared at the planets flying by the window. Of course, not all the planets were ever there for them to see, but some were always there. Pluto passed, then came Saturn and Jupiter. Mars was a little further away, but still in sight. His vision was blurred as his mind was distracted from getting his eyes to focus. It had happened again! He was waiting for her to come back, and the next thing he knew, she was there and he couldn't get his eyes off her! But he just couldn't help it. He closed his eyes tight at the memory of when she had run up to him, her hair blowing in the wind, her eyes sparkling in the early morning sun... Wait, did he just think that?! Woah, this girl really has his mind going nuts. He shook his head and tried thinking of anything other than her. Worst fifteen seconds of his life. Finally, the rocket touched down on the surface of the earth. Sharkboy was quick to jump up and exit the ship, the door not even fully opened yet. The fresh air calmed him down and the starry night sky cleared his mind. It was early in the evening, wich meant Max and his family were still awake. Lavagirl calmly walked out after him, walking past him as he was still gasping for clean air. He felt a little stupid for reacting this way, so he pulled himself together and followed her to the house. They had always been welcome in the Daniels' home, so Lavagirl simply opened the backdoor and walked in, greeting Max's parents who were sitting on the couch, watching a movie. Sharkboy cringed when he noticed them cuddling, a longing feeling tugging at his heart when he looked forward at Lavagirl. They automatically went upstairs, to Max's room. His door was open, and he was sitting at his desk with a bunch of textbooks in front of him. Sharkboy silently felt thankful for the millionth time that he and Lava never had to worry about school. \"Hey guys,\" he chirpily greeted, happy to leave his homework for another time. At fifteen, Max was growing out of his scrawny kid-body and was becoming an attractive teenager. He was wearing black shorts and (Sharkboy had to keep himself from rolling his eyes) a white shirt with a cartoon rocket on it. His flowing blonde hair was now cut shorter, too. Sharkboy sat down on the bed as Lavagirl stood next to Max, talking about his homework. Sharky smiled at the way she was able to help him with his Math as if it was kindergarten stuff. She was just so smart, even without completing school, and that was only one of the million things he loved about her. He blocked the conversation out, lying back across the singlebed, making shure his fin was just off of the bed and draping an arm over his eyes, trying to get his mind to relax. He couldn't help them anyways, Math was the one thing he totally sucked at. So instead, he just let his mind wander, letting his own imagination take him wherever it wanted to. Of course, he couldn't get the events of a mere half-hour ago to leave his mind. She had placed her hand on his chest, and he couldn't help but put his hand on her waist when she had moved past him. But he had torn himself from her. She hadn't burnt him, in fact she had been quite cooled around others recently. He was just afraid. If something happened, everything would fall apart, and it would just be a life full of confused emotions and maybe even broken hearts. The last thing Planet Drool needed now was for it's only heroes to be caught up in a dramatic Romeo and Juliet love-fest. That and...if he was dating her and something would happen... He tried shaking the thought from his mind. A semi-light weight on his stomach pulled him from his train of thought. Lifting his arm and easily moving his upper body so that he was parallel with the floor, he saw that Lavagirl was sitting on him, arms crossed and an amused-annoyed expression on her face. \"Oy, do I have to wake you up the same way I did with Max?\" He faintly noticed Max in the corner of his eye, lightly touching his rear-end at the memory. But his mind was a little too fogged to fully concertrate on that, what with the most beautiful girl in the universe sitting straight on him, and all. \"Do you want hot chocolate, or not?\" she asked, him replying with a quick smile and wiggling his brows. She rolled her eyes at this, as she understood the message of 'You know how I like it.' He didn't like his hot chocolate completely hot, of course, just warm. And Lavagirl definately knew that by now. Once she was out of the room, Max shut the door behind her and pulled his chair up to the bed, sitting next to Sharkboy and leaning forward like a child engrossed in a fairytale. \"So?\" Sharkboy only looked at him, a little freaked out by the way his creator's eyes were sparkling mischievously. He had no idea what Max was getting at, but the single word had already put him on high alert. \"Uuh...so what?\" Max threw his hands in the air in frustrasion, as if it was as obvious as blue skies. \"Uh duh! What's happened between you and Lavagirl since I last saw you?\" Sharkboy rolled his eyes at this. \"Seriously, sometimes you're like a freaking girl about this. You've been obsessed with us hooking up for years now,\" Sharkboy said, frowning at Max. He only brushed it off, having heard that a lot. \"Yeah, whatever. So?\" he repeated. Sharkboy sighed, trying to keep himself from just walking away. Sometimes that boy could just suck out his last drop of patience. \"Nothing has happened,\" he stated as clearly as possible, but Max only gave him a dissaproving look. Sharkboy stood up and walked over to the door, planning on joining Lavagirl in the much more interesting task of boiling water. \"No, Sharkboy wait!\" He stopped when Max put a hand on his shoulder, having to take a deep breath to refrain from tearing the kid apart. He turned around, willing to hear him out. \"Look,\" he started, his teen girl attitude suddenly replaced with concern. \"I know you guys totally like eachother. No, scratch that, you love her.\" Sharkboy couldn't ignore the knots in his stomach at the sound of that word. \"And I know she feels the same.\" \"Yeah, I know that,\" he said, trying to hold back on the biting tone. He turned away again, walking a few steps forward before stopping again. Images flooded his mind from five years ago. The sight of her pale, lifeless face. The darkness where lava was supposed to be flowing. The feeling of her limp body in his arms. He couldn't protect her... \"I can't go out with her, Max,\" he said softly. His eyes staring off in the distance, an emotionless expression on his face. \"Why not?\" Max asked behind him. Sharkboy wasn't prepared for that question, the key question, and he spinned around in a blind fury. \"Because...I...\" he couldn't find the right words to describe his feelings as he clawed at his own hair, so he just spewed out the first thing he could think of to get the meddling boy off his back. \"I just don't want to, okay!\" His blood froze as his bionic ears picked up a soft gasp from the other side of the door, and footsteps hurrying down the hall. He groaned, raking his hand through his hair. She had heard him! He punched the nearest solid wall in a crazed tantrum before nearly ripping the door open and running after her. He was outside in under a second, desperate to find her. \"Lavagirl! Lavagirl, where are you?!\" He paused for a moment to think. He went through his mental files of everything he knew about her, a lightbulb quickly appearing above his head. Of course, she would be somewhere that was familiar to her. He ran around the house, breathing a sigh of relief when he saw that the rocket was still there. For a brief moment, he had thought she might leave without him. He ran to the rocket, entering through the open door and climbing up the ladder, to the bedroom. Lavagirl was sitting on her bed, her arms tightly wrapped around her knees as she sat curled up, staring at the wall next to her. Tears were burning in her eyes, but she didn't let them flow. Rhythmatic clanking revealed that someone had found her, and she prayed for it not to be Sharkboy. If she had to see his face one more time, she'd fry the living crap out of him! Damn selfish jerkhole. She wished she knew better insults, but unfortunately Max had dreamt her up too sweet to know anything other than mild swearwords. The person climbed up the ladder and stood up on the metal floor, and came to stand on the other end of the bunkbeds. The shadow revealed spiked hair, a dorsal fin and that the person was lazily leaning against the wall as if by habit. Sharkboy. She ignored him, only ducking her nose behind her arm as her cheek rested on her knee. He had clearly shown signs of liking her before, but now suddenly he wasn't interested. The only logical explaination she could think of, was that he had been playing her, and that only made the urge to toast his ass stronger. She heard him taking a deep breath. So what now, was she frustrating him? Her hair blazed up, noticibly scaring him a bit, almost making her smile in satisfaction. \"L-Lavagirl?\" he softly asked, concern and cautiousness mixed in his voice. She still ignored him, knowing that seeing him now would be too much, and even though he had been a total buttbrain, she didn't want him getting hurt. He sighed, and his shadow revealing him raking a clawed hand through his hair. \"Look, Lava... I didn't mean it that way, I...\" Trying to make excuses? Tsk tsk. So typical. She turned to him, a bloodcurdling glare with her hands forming fists and the tears in her eyes making him retreat back a step. Although, she couldn't decide if the emotion on his face was fear or regret. He looked down and bit his lip, slowly stepping forward again and looking at her. He looked like a kid who had been sent to the principal's office for doing something bad, albeit cute, like accitentially hitting someone's potted plant while shooting slingshot: scared and guilty but wearing an obvious mask of bravery. Before she could allow her heart to melt at the sight, she turned away again, trying to remind herself that she was supposed to be mad at him. \"Okay,\" he wispered, almost to himself. \"If you don't want to look at me, that's fine. Just please, hear me out, okay?\" She didn't move or answer, just sat there, staring focusless at the wall. \"Yeah, it's true, I don't want to go out with you. But not because I don't like you, I really do! It's just...\" And here comes the dumb excuse: \"I just love you too much to only give you what I have. You're the most amazing, sweet, beautiful girl in the whole universe. What are you going to do with a guy like me,\" he said, his voice cracking up. \"You deserve only the best. A guy who could give you the world, a guy who can protect you from anything and everything. You deserve a handsome, patient, loving and selfless prince on a white horse. A knight in shining armour, even.\" She felt her tears flowing, but her reasons have changed. \"And what am I?\" he chuckled, dejected. \"A retard in tinfoil.\" It was quiet for a minute before he spoke again, his voice soft like he was going to cry. \"And the real reason...what if something happened to you? And I wouldn't be able to protect you? What kind of a boyfriend would I be if I let you get hurt? Like when...\" She knew exactly what he was talking about. When they were kids, Mr. Electric had killed Sharkboy, and she had jumped into the water after him. This had caused her to die, too, but Max's dreaming, together with Sharkboy, had saved her. She knew that he blamed himself for her death. \"So, yeah,\" his voice was thick, and she knew he was holding back tears. \"That's why I don't want to go out with you.\" He was just walking back towards the exit when she decided that she had probably punished him enough. She jumped up and was in his arms within two strides. She threw her arms around him, and he held her, too. Looking up, she saw fear, nervousness, unstability and even a bit of care in his eyes. And also, a flicker of hope. She smiled up at him, nearly laughing when he returned it shyly. Now when did he decide that he was suddenly not good enough for her? He was cute, goofy, handsome, strong and maybe even a little smart. And she knew he would always protect her. \"Hey,\" she said softly. \"If I'm supposed to deserve such a great guy, then why can't I have you?\" His smile widened, and she felt her heart flutter when he came closer. She did the same, and in no time thier lips met. Having waited for this for a VERY long time, Lavagirl couldn't help but melt into the kiss. Of course, she had to be careful not to actually melt. The heat that was building up inside her from the feeling of his lips against hers was a little hard to keep low, and she felt him slightly cringe for a moment, but she managed. She moved her hands up his chest and her arms snaked around his neck as he held her closer. It was the most wonderful, most energetic ten seconds of her life. When they both pulled away at the same time, she opened her eyes to his. When she had finally caught her breath, she asked: \"What now?\" Sharkboy pondered for a moment, then beamed at her. \"Let's go tell Max.\" AN: Bat: That's probably the sweetest thing I've ever written!

She rolled her eyes at this, as she understood the message of 'You know how I like it.' He didn't like his hot chocolate completely hot, of course, just warm. And Lavagirl definately knew that by now. Once she was out of the room, Max shut the door behind her and pulled his chair up to the bed, sitting next to Sharkboy and leaning forward like a child engrossed in a fairytale. \"So?\" Sharkboy only looked at him, a little freaked out by the way his creator's eyes were sparkling mischievously. He had no idea what Max was getting at, but the single word had already put him on high alert. \"Uuh...so what?\" Max threw his hands in the air in frustrasion, as if it was as obvious as blue skies. \"Uh duh! What's happened between you and Lavagirl since I last saw you?\" Sharkboy rolled his eyes at this. \"Seriously, sometimes you're like a freaking girl about this. You've been obsessed with us hooking up for years now,\" Sharkboy said, frowning at Max. He only brushed it off, having heard that a lot. \"Yeah, whatever. So?\" he repeated. Sharkboy sighed, trying to keep himself from just walking away. Sometimes that boy could just suck out his last drop of patience. \"Nothing has happened,\" he stated as clearly as possible, but Max only gave him a dissaproving look. Sharkboy stood up and walked over to the door, planning on joining Lavagirl in the much more interesting task of boiling water. \"No, Sharkboy wait!\" He stopped when Max put a hand on his shoulder, having to take a deep breath to refrain from tearing the kid apart. He turned around, willing to hear him out. \"Look,\" he started, his teen girl attitude suddenly replaced with concern. \"I know you guys totally like eachother. No, scratch that, you love her.\" Sharkboy couldn't ignore the knots in his stomach at the sound of that word. \"And I know she feels the same.\" \"Yeah, I know that,\" he said, trying to hold back on the biting tone. He turned away again, walking a few steps forward before stopping again. Images flooded his mind from five years ago. The sight of her pale, lifeless face. The darkness where lava was supposed to be flowing. The feeling of her limp body in his arms. He couldn't protect her... \"I can't go out with her, Max,\" he said softly. His eyes staring off in the distance, an emotionless expression on his face. \"Why not?\" Max asked behind him. Sharkboy wasn't prepared for that question, the key question, and he spinned around in a blind fury. \"Because...I...\" he couldn't find the right words to describe his feelings as he clawed at his own hair, so he just spewed out the first thing he could think of to get the meddling boy off his back. \"I just don't want to, okay!\" His blood froze as his bionic ears picked up a soft gasp from the other side of the door, and footsteps hurrying down the hall. He groaned, raking his hand through his hair. She had heard him! He punched the nearest solid wall in a crazed tantrum before nearly ripping the door open and running after her. He was outside in under a second, desperate to find her. \"Lavagirl! Lavagirl, where are you?!\" He paused for a moment to think. He went through his mental files of everything he knew about her, a lightbulb quickly appearing above his head. Of course, she would be somewhere that was familiar to her. He ran around the house, breathing a sigh of relief when he saw that the rocket was still there. For a brief moment, he had thought she might leave without him. He ran to the rocket, entering through the open door and climbing up the ladder, to the bedroom. Lavagirl was sitting on her bed, her arms tightly wrapped around her knees as she sat curled up, staring at the wall next to her. Tears were burning in her eyes, but she didn't let them flow. Rhythmatic clanking revealed that someone had found her, and she prayed for it not to be Sharkboy. If she had to see his face one more time, she'd fry the living crap out of him! Damn selfish jerkhole. She wished she knew better insults, but unfortunately Max had dreamt her up too sweet to know anything other than mild swearwords. The person climbed up the ladder and stood up on the metal floor, and came to stand on the other end of the bunkbeds. The shadow revealed spiked hair, a dorsal fin and that the person was lazily leaning against the wall as if by habit. Sharkboy. She ignored him, only ducking her nose behind her arm as her cheek rested on her knee. He had clearly shown signs of liking her before, but now suddenly he wasn't interested. The only logical explaination she could think of, was that he had been playing her, and that only made the urge to toast his ass stronger. She heard him taking a deep breath. So what now, was she frustrating him? Her hair blazed up, noticibly scaring him a bit, almost making her smile in satisfaction. \"L-Lavagirl?\" he softly asked, concern and cautiousness mixed in his voice. She still ignored him, knowing that seeing him now would be too much, and even though he had been a total buttbrain, she didn't want him getting hurt. He sighed, and his shadow revealing him raking a clawed hand through his hair. \"Look, Lava... I didn't mean it that way, I...\" Trying to make excuses? Tsk tsk. So typical. She turned to him, a bloodcurdling glare with her hands forming fists and the tears in her eyes making him retreat back a step. Although, she couldn't decide if the emotion on his face was fear or regret. He looked down and bit his lip, slowly stepping forward again and looking at her. He looked like a kid who had been sent to the principal's office for doing something bad, albeit cute, like accitentially hitting someone's potted plant while shooting slingshot: scared and guilty but wearing an obvious mask of bravery. Before she could allow her heart to melt at the sight, she turned away again, trying to remind herself that she was supposed to be mad at him. \"Okay,\" he wispered, almost to himself. \"If you don't want to look at me, that's fine. Just please, hear me out, okay?\" She didn't move or answer, just sat there, staring focusless at the wall. \"Yeah, it's true, I don't want to go out with you. But not because I don't like you, I really do! It's just...\" And here comes the dumb excuse: \"I just love you too much to only give you what I have. You're the most amazing, sweet, beautiful girl in the whole universe. What are you going to do with a guy like me,\" he said, his voice cracking up. \"You deserve only the best. A guy who could give you the world, a guy who can protect you from anything and everything. You deserve a handsome, patient, loving and selfless prince on a white horse. A knight in shining armour, even.\" She felt her tears flowing, but her reasons have changed. \"And what am I?\" he chuckled, dejected. \"A retard in tinfoil.\" It was quiet for a minute before he spoke again, his voice soft like he was going to cry. \"And the real reason...what if something happened to you? And I wouldn't be able to protect you? What kind of a boyfriend would I be if I let you get hurt? Like when...\" She knew exactly what he was talking about. When they were kids, Mr. Electric had killed Sharkboy, and she had jumped into the water after him. This had caused her to die, too, but Max's dreaming, together with Sharkboy, had saved her. She knew that he blamed himself for her death. \"So, yeah,\" his voice was thick, and she knew he was holding back tears. \"That's why I don't want to go out with you.\" He was just walking back towards the exit when she decided that she had probably punished him enough. She jumped up and was in his arms within two strides. She threw her arms around him, and he held her, too. Looking up, she saw fear, nervousness, unstability and even a bit of care in his eyes. And also, a flicker of hope. She smiled up at him, nearly laughing when he returned it shyly. Now when did he decide that he was suddenly not good enough for her? He was cute, goofy, handsome, strong and maybe even a little smart. And she knew he would always protect her. \"Hey,\" she said softly. \"If I'm supposed to deserve such a great guy, then why can't I have you?\" His smile widened, and she felt her heart flutter when he came closer. She did the same, and in no time thier lips met. Having waited for this for a VERY long time, Lavagirl couldn't help but melt into the kiss. Of course, she had to be careful not to actually melt. The heat that was building up inside her from the feeling of his lips against hers was a little hard to keep low, and she felt him slightly cringe for a moment, but she managed. She moved her hands up his chest and her arms snaked around his neck as he held her closer. It was the most wonderful, most energetic ten seconds of her life. When they both pulled away at the same time, she opened her eyes to his. When she had finally caught her breath, she asked: \"What now?\" Sharkboy pondered for a moment, then beamed at her. \"Let's go tell Max.\" AN: Bat: That's probably the sweetest thing I've ever written!

I'll post the secondnchapter in a couple days. I hope you enjoy it! c: xxxxx ValentinesnDay. Anholiday most closely associated with the mutual exchange of lovennotes in the form of \"valentines\". Modern Valentine symbolsninclude the heart-shaped outline, doves, and the figure of the wingednCupid. Morenlike complete nonsense. Sharkboyncouldn't comprehend the reason for having a holiday aboutnmushy-gushy love. Humans must have nothing better to do with theirnlives, he thought, than make up holidays for themselves. Why wouldnyou need to waste money on overly expensive chocolates that won'tnlast more than a day? Or cards that will just collect dust in a boxnsomewhere? Or flowers that will simply wilt in a week? He will nevernunderstand human logic. He was above humans, after all. Thenyoung cartilaginous(1) contemplated over these thoughts whilenhovering over a large selection of inflorescence. The floral scent,nthough weak to a human nose, stung his nerves violently. He let out anlow growl and wiped his gloved hand across his irritated nose.nOnlookers stared questioningly in his direction, their faces mixednwith confusion and fear, for it wasn't everyday that you saw anyoung boy with claws, fangs, and a dorsal fin protruding from hisnback standing on the sidewalk. But Sharkboy was oblivious to theirnfixation, and continued to mull over the thoughts in his head whilenglaring down the delicate flowers. xxxxx \"Wherenis Sharkboy?\" Maxnlooked up from his essay at the fuming, pink haired girl. \"Inhaven't seen him since this morning,\" he said, feeling as thoughnhe'd repeated himself several times already. \"He mumblednsomething about going out for awhile and left.\" \"Goingnout where?\" Thenyoung boy simply shrugged his shoulders and went back to writing hisnschool paper. \"Well,\"nLavagirl huffed, placing her hands on her hips. \"It's very rudento just leave when visiting a friend from another world.\" \"Whatnelse do you expect from Sharkboy ?\" \"True,\"nLavagirl agreed. \"But still rude. I won't stand for it.\" Maxnchuckled at his creation's strict attitude. Always the voice ofnreason and how to do things the right way. But he knew there was a deeper meaning for her to feel anger atnSharkboy today. He could tell from the way her cheeks gave off anslight blush, the way her brows knitted together, the way hernpresence was blazing, and the obvious way she's been questioningnhis absence for the past two hours. It was Valentines Day, andnLavagirl wasn't pleased with the stubborn shark's decision ofnleaving. He couldn't really blame her. Sharkboy clearly had a crush on the girl, and she clearly returned his feelings, yet he continued to be an idiot about it. \"Younmight as well try making the first move. Otherwise, this relationshipnwon't be going anywhere.\" Max'snsudden statement made Lavagirl uneasy. \"What? What relationship?\" Thenboy just stared at her with a look that basically translates ton'You-know-what-I'm-talking-about'. Lavagirl shook her head andnfrowned. She held her hands up in defense before saying \"No, no,nno,\" and then blushing, totally killing her response. \"Listen,nLavagirl, I'm not stupid. I created you guys, what… three or fournyears ago? I know the both of you inside and out,\" Max stretchednhis arms above his head casually. \"And, to put it simply, you guysnhave the hots for each other.\" \"Donnot!\" was the retort. Then came the explanation, \"How could younsay that, Max? Sharkboy and I cannot like each other! How cannSharkboy possibly like anything that's not covered in scales or isnmissing a ph level? That boy is too stubborn to fathom liking anything. Especially me.\" Maxnraised an eyebrow. \"Why's that?\" \"Well,\"nLavagirl let a sigh slip threw her teeth. \"My element, I guess youncould say, is fire. His is water. The two don't really mix verynwell.\" \"True,nbut not in your case.\" Itnwas Lavagirl's turn to raise a questioning eyebrow. \"Care tonexplain?\" Maxnset down his pencil and turned his body sideways to face her. \"Okay…non Earth, lava that flows from volcanoes will spill into the ocean ifnone borders it. But, it doesn't really harm the ocean,\" He waitednfor Lavagirl to nod in understanding. \"The ocean cools the lava,ncalms it, and lets it settle at the bottom. The cooled lava willnsometimes rise out of the ocean and create islands. That's how thenHawaiian islands were formed.\" \"So,nyou're saying… ?\" \"Evennthough the two elements are opposites, they are constantly workingntogether,\" he paused to smile at her. \"Like you and Sharkboy, thentwo need each other. Opposites attract.\" Lavagirlnstared at him for a few moments, taking everything he said in andngoing over it. \"Wow,\" she said, truly amazed. \"You really paynattention in school.\" Maxnhung his head. \"Thanks for ruining what could have been a nicenmoment,\" he then chuckled before picking his head up and saying,n\"But do you understand?\" \"Yeah,\"na flushed hue settled over her cheeks. Ansudden knock came from the bedroom door, making both pre-teens jump.nLavagirl strode over to the interruption, and opened the woodennentrance. Hernsoft brown orbs eyes connected with fierce blue ones. Shenfrowned, crossing her arms as the anger she held minutes ago camencrawling back into her nerves when seeing the guest's face. \"Andnjust where have you been?\" Sharkboynignored her question and tilted his head to look at Max. The boyncouldn't help but shudder under his piercing stare. \"Out.\" Maxnimmediately jumped out of his chair at the simple command andnshuffled out of the room without question. He learned to never go against anything the carnivorous boy demanded. He didn'tnrecommend attempting it. Lavagirlngaped at him. \"Out? You command Max to leave the room afternignoring spending time with him all day? What could you possibly benthinking by telling our creator to leave? I swear, Sharkboy, you mustnthink so highly of yourself sometimes to-\" Hernrant was cut short to a muffle when a bundle was shoved into hernface. She was about to yell at the boy before realizing just what was shoved in her face. \"What…nWhat is this?\" Sharkboyncrossed his arms in defensiveness and answered, \"Flowers.\" Lavagirlnlooked down at the arrangement of flowers in her arms with shock. \"Don'tngirls like this kind of stuff?\" he said with a scowl, seriouslynwanting to rip the little things to shreds for making his nose stingnwith their awful stench. He even bore his teeth at them in instinct. Lavagirlnnodded, utterly speechless. Sharkboy was giving her flowers?nSharkboy, King of the ocean and everything that has to do with beingnimpossibly stubborn, was giving her something so fragile? She justncouldn't believe it. \"Well…\"nSharkboy seemed flustered at her silence and ran a shaky, clawed handnthrough his hair. \"Happy Valentines day... I guess.\" Lavagirlnsmiled up at him. \"Oh, Sharky…\" Sharkboynhissed at the sudden rush of heat to his face and jerked away,ncovering it with his gloved hands and wishing he could rip it offnwithout taking a trip to the emergency room in the process. \"There!nYou got your stupid present!\" he said, before striding down thenhallway in a rush. \"I'm going home! I've had enough of thisnridiculous planet!\" Lavagirlngiggled at his obvious embarrassment. She held the bundle up to hernface, careful to keep her body temperature low, and took in theninvigorating fragrance. \"Inguess that's what he was out getting this whole time.\" Max said,napproaching the girl when he was sure Sharkboy was out of sight. Lavagirlnimagined the silly boy standing in front of the flower stand fornhours in discomfort, working up the courage to purchase them… ornpossibly steal them? \"Inguess he really came through, huh?\" Max chuckled, entering his roomnto finish his report. Lavagirl'sneyes lit up with delight. Oppositesnattract . xxxxx A/N: 1.

Truthfully,nsharks scare the crap out of me, and just seeing a picture of onenmakes me want to curl up into a ball of fear. I downright hate them.nBut Sharkboy is an exception since he's cute… and because TaylornLautner plays him in the movie.

D:[Chapter 2] Here'snthe final part of this twoshot, so I hope you guys like it! xxxxx Sharkboyntapped his foot impatiently against the metal floor of his rocket'sncontrol room. He glared daggers at the red launch button in front ofnhim as it glowed a bright red, urging him to push it and leave planetnEarth and all of it's emotions behind. The only thing keeping him from actually leaving was the factnthat Lavagirl was still with Max. He glanced up at the seat acrossnfrom his, taking in the pink designs etched into the red cushionednseat, courtesy of Max, and felt heat spread across his face. Hengot Lavagirl flowers… and it was completely and utterlynhumiliating. Notnlike him at all, he thought. Uncool. He felt like going into a sharknfrenzy. And it was all because he couldn't stop thinking about what she thought. \"Damn,\"nhe whispered, gritting his pointed teeth together. How the heck wasnhe supposed to face her now? Andnthat's when he heard it. The sizzling of grass as boots sprintednacross their surface. His sharp hearing could pick up her uniquenfootsteps anywhere. And he panicked, in his head at least, but triednto keep a calm expression upon his face. Sharkboy heard her bootsnclunk against the metal landing, her hand quickly hitting the switchnto raise it once she was inside, and then her climbing the metalnstairs. He took a deep breath and let it out slowly, calming hisnspeeding heart. He didn't understand how he could be so nervousnover seeing Lavagirl when he's been at her side for years already. \"Sharky?\" Henfroze as she called his name, then swallowed hard before answering innhis coolest voice possible. \"Yeah?\" Lavagirlnpopped her head around the corner, looking timidly at him, but soonnholding a small smile. \"Um, is everything ready to go?\" \"Yeah,\"nhe looked back to the launch button. \"I got everything ready.\" \"Good,\"nshe whispered to herself, approaching him gingerly with her handsnfiddling behind her back. \"All I have to do is the fuel checksnthen.\" Sharkboynglanced at the digital clock hanging on the wall of the ship, andnasked, \"Why aren't you still with Max? It's not that late yet.\" \"Maxnhas Valentines Day plans with Marissa.\" \"Oh,\"nthat just brought back the reminder that it was indeed Valentines Daynon Earth. Somehow, it was more like Embarrass Sharkboy Day to thenyoung predator. At that thought, he couldn't help but glance aroundnher form, noticing something missing. \"Where's the flowers?\" henblurted out, irritation stinging his tone. Thenpink haired girl giggled. \"Max's mom put them in a vase with somenwater. She's keeping them for me.\" \"Why?\" Lavagirlnslightly flinched at the way the word held a growl. \"Well, theynwouldn't last very long in a volcano. Or around one for thatnmatter.\" \"Oh,\"nSharkboy felt stupid for not realizing the obvious. \"Right.\" \"They'renbeautiful,\" she walked closer to him, wishing for him to makeneye-contact with her. \"I didn't think you'd get me anything fornValentine's day, Sharky. Or even realize that it was today.\" \"Yeah…\"nhe didn't know how else to respond. \"I'dnlike to give you an, um, present, too.\" Henlooked up at her, violent blue orbs meeting calm brown. \"What…nkind of present?\" he couldn't help but ask, curious. \"Closenyour eyes.\" Henraised an eyebrow. \"Why?\" \"Justnclose them.\" she said, biting at her bottom lip. \"Why?\"nhe repeated. \"Please,nSharky?\" Hensighed before mumbling \"Fine.\" and shutting his eyes. A fewnmoments of silence followed, his ears only picking up the sounds ofnher faint breathing and… her thumping heart? He wasn't sure. Henwas about to question her pause when he felt her hands caress hisncheeks, emitting a flow of warmth, but not torrid enough to harm him.nHis breath hitched in his throat, a butterfly feeling swirling aroundnhis stomach… and then he felt tepid lips press against his. Shenheld her lips on his, a quick inhale of breath engulfing her lungs atnhow perfect his felt meshed against hers. Soft and ample; Not at allnwhat she expected from someone so vicious. Her heart was beatingnfuriously in her chest, wanting to burst out of it's confinement.nIt made her on edge, making the blood in her veins flow faster andnfaster. Sharkboynfelt a sizzle against his lips before Lavagirl pulled away slowly. Henopened his eyes and looked into hers. Her hands still held his facencarefully as a moment of silence passed between them. It was whennLavagirl glanced back down at his lips that it was broken. \"Oh!\"nshe exclaimed. \"I'm sorry!\" Itntook a minute for Sharkboy to realize she even spoke, his eyes glazednover in a daze. \"… huh?\" \"Yournlips!\" she ran a finger carefully over them, concern filling hernface. \"Lips…\" \"Yes,nI slightly burned them,\" she said, snapping him out of his daze. Henbought his fingers up to graze the delicate skin, and felt a smallnscab forming. She gave him a shy smile. \"I got excited and heatednup.\" \"Oh,\"nSharkboy felt his face start to heat up and pulled away from her hold. \"It's fine,\" henran a hand through his hair before continuing. \"We… we better getngoing.\" \"Right!\"nLavagirl said, forgetting their destination for a minute. She wentninto co-pilot mode immediately. \"I'll get the check started.\" Withnthat, Lavagirl ran over to her seat, buckled herself in, and checkednoff the fuel levels of the rocket. Sharkboy kept his gaze on thenblinking red button, his mind shutting out her mumbling of 'checks',nand keeping his fingers placed over his bottom lip. xxxxx Thentwo walked silently side by side down the beach, heading toward theirnhomes. Each was filled with numerous thoughts about the other, notnmaking the walk awkward in any way for them. It wasn't untilnLavagirl spoke that Sharkboy realized they arrived at the break off;nVolcano on one side, and a dock leading to the ocean on the other.n\"I'll see you tomorrow?\" \"What?\" \"Wenstill have our 'superhero' duties,\" she chuckled a bit at thenword 'superhero', but still being completely loyal to her dutiesnas the Light ofnplanet Drool. \"And I'm sure your royal subjects miss you by now,\"nshe joked, poking him in the chest. \"King Sharkboy.\" Hencouldn't help but chuckle at her. \"Of course they do,\" henstruck a pose, showing off his muscles through his thin uniform. \"I am King of the ocean after all.\" Lavagirlngiggled, playfully hitting his arm. They exchanged delightful smiles,nstaring into each others' eyes. She took his clawed hands in hersnand gave them a slight squeeze, smiling, before turning and walkingnoff with a wave. Sharkboy watched her sprint up the charred pathway,npink hair flowing behind her in perfect waves. She halted suddenlynand turned back around to look at him. \"HappynValentines Day, Sharky!\" she yelled, before shining anothernbrilliant smile and sprinting off again. Oncenshe was out of sight, Sharkboy turned toward the dock and begannwalking toward the calling of his kingdom. He stopped at the edge ofnthe wooden platform, and brought his fingers back up to touch hisnlips, flinching at the stinging sensation running through them, butnfinding himself actually enjoying it at the same time. TheirnValentines exchange wasn't passionate, lovey-dovey, or any of thenother things people would expect to have with their significantnother, and it may not have been a long day of activities either, butnSharkboy felt like it was an accomplishment. \"HappynValentines Day, LG.\" he whispered, a small smile forming on hisnfeatures, before diving into the tempting waves below him. xxxxx Wasnit good? Please let me know! Inplan to do another oneshot for Sharkboy and Lavagirl, and it willnhave more kissing and heat, so look for it in the future. ;) I'mngoing to work on it a lot to make it good for the readers, and it'llnmost likely be under 'T' for teen.

She gave him a shy smile. \"I got excited and heatednup.\" \"Oh,\"nSharkboy felt his face start to heat up and pulled away from her hold. \"It's fine,\" henran a hand through his hair before continuing. \"We… we better getngoing.\" \"Right!\"nLavagirl said, forgetting their destination for a minute. She wentninto co-pilot mode immediately. \"I'll get the check started.\" Withnthat, Lavagirl ran over to her seat, buckled herself in, and checkednoff the fuel levels of the rocket. Sharkboy kept his gaze on thenblinking red button, his mind shutting out her mumbling of 'checks',nand keeping his fingers placed over his bottom lip. xxxxx Thentwo walked silently side by side down the beach, heading toward theirnhomes. Each was filled with numerous thoughts about the other, notnmaking the walk awkward in any way for them. It wasn't untilnLavagirl spoke that Sharkboy realized they arrived at the break off;nVolcano on one side, and a dock leading to the ocean on the other.n\"I'll see you tomorrow?\" \"What?\" \"Wenstill have our 'superhero' duties,\" she chuckled a bit at thenword 'superhero', but still being completely loyal to her dutiesnas the Light ofnplanet Drool. \"And I'm sure your royal subjects miss you by now,\"nshe joked, poking him in the chest. \"King Sharkboy.\" Hencouldn't help but chuckle at her. \"Of course they do,\" henstruck a pose, showing off his muscles through his thin uniform. \"I am King of the ocean after all.\" Lavagirlngiggled, playfully hitting his arm. They exchanged delightful smiles,nstaring into each others' eyes. She took his clawed hands in hersnand gave them a slight squeeze, smiling, before turning and walkingnoff with a wave. Sharkboy watched her sprint up the charred pathway,npink hair flowing behind her in perfect waves. She halted suddenlynand turned back around to look at him. \"HappynValentines Day, Sharky!\" she yelled, before shining anothernbrilliant smile and sprinting off again. Oncenshe was out of sight, Sharkboy turned toward the dock and begannwalking toward the calling of his kingdom. He stopped at the edge ofnthe wooden platform, and brought his fingers back up to touch hisnlips, flinching at the stinging sensation running through them, butnfinding himself actually enjoying it at the same time. TheirnValentines exchange wasn't passionate, lovey-dovey, or any of thenother things people would expect to have with their significantnother, and it may not have been a long day of activities either, butnSharkboy felt like it was an accomplishment. \"HappynValentines Day, LG.\" he whispered, a small smile forming on hisnfeatures, before diving into the tempting waves below him. xxxxx Wasnit good? Please let me know! Inplan to do another oneshot for Sharkboy and Lavagirl, and it willnhave more kissing and heat, so look for it in the future. ;) I'mngoing to work on it a lot to make it good for the readers, and it'llnmost likely be under 'T' for teen.

So I wrote this last year. If you don't like it, don't read it! If you love it, read it again and comment, favorite, and follow me! Calista: So when do I come in? Madi: When I tell you! Calista: So, this chapter is about *BLEEP* Madi: AND CONTINUE! Max told me about his two dreams, Sharkboy and Lavagirl. At first, I didn't believe him, but when we went fishing this summer, I knew he wasn't fibbing. It was a warm summer afternoon (obviously) and Max and I were on the dock. Max's pole started to shake, so we tried to haul the big one in. Next thing we knew, a shark fin protruded from the water, swimming closer and closer toward the dock. That's when a head appeared. Sharkboy was the cause, and he seemed to be lost, so we snuck him home. Sadly, our parents were to \"busy\" to notice. We kept him in our shared bathroom, keeping him fed and in water. He told us that he had been traveling the universe in search of his father and his latest adventures on a planet that was so cool, it would make you drool. He told us that we could go there someday, all the while staring at my emerald green eyes with his chocolate brown one. I would then look away, blushing a deep scarlet. Suddenly, we were met with a glowing pink light. At that point, only Max was able to speak. \"Lavagirl,\" was the only thing he muttered. She smiled at the three of us, that seemingly to be her name. She was amazing; purple flames for hair and skin of molten lava rock. She told us that she needed Sharkboy to return with her to Planet Drool, because a great crisis was developing. She asked if we could go with her. \"We can't, we have school tomorrow,\" I had answered. They looked at us sadly before they left. I haven't seen them ever since, but Max told me that he dreams about them sometimes, saying I was there with super powers. I would only smile and go to my room, silently crying and drawing pictures and comics about different adventures we've never had. And that's what I did this summer. Little did I know that this was going to be the start of the biggest adventure of my life.[Chapter 2] Hey! How Y'all doin'? So, I want to personally thankmy reviewers; Mist Hitachiin SilentStorm1999 Orange Mystic Force Ranger And Sandra They have all been given virtual cookies!

By the way, if I'm inspired to write a quote, you will get one. ~Capndesdes (Youtube)- How the ***k is a toad supposed to carry a broomstick? I closed my locker and grabbed all of my stuff from the floor. My best guy friend, Nicolai watched as I struggled with my books to get to my next class. He chuckled and took some from the top of my little stack. \"I got it,\" I muttered going to take them back. He only shook his head. \"I will do anything to make this the best day after your real birthday...birthday.\" I laughed at his stupidity before heading out of the building and sitting in the grass under the window of my brother's class. \"Hey, Callysta, what do you want for your birthday tomorrow?\" Nic asked. I looked at him through the corner of my eyes. \"Why?\" \"I told you what I was going to do today.\" I shrugged. \"I don't know really. If I were to get anything, I would either get a camera, or something to put my wildest dreams and writing ideas in,\" I answered. He smiled in thought and we continued to look out into the warm, blue sky. (ha, that didn't make a lot of sense) When school ended a long 7 hours later, I walked home alone, considering Max had to talk to my old teacher, MR. Electricidad. He is super crazy, but that's why he's my favorite teacher. I walked into the house and headed to my room, knowing that my parents weren't the best when it came to talking. I laid down on my bed after tossing my bag next to my desk. Today was a wierd day. My teachers were as boring as a couple of rocks, except for my History teacher. He was almost a short as me, and had a knack for basketball and track. Max was doing fine in his class from what he told me, though I didn't really believe him, and Mom and Dad are close to a divorse. Yeah, life kind of sucks. I heard the door slam shut in the next room. That must have been Max. His room is the only one near mine. I went over and knocked on the door. I heard a sniffle and took that as my cue to go inside. \"I looked around the room, and couldn't find his dream journal. \"Max, where's your journal?\" I asked. He lifted his tear-streaked face from his bed and frowned deeply at me. \"Linus stole it,\" he mumbled. I frowned as well. Linus was his bully as of two years ago. It was sad really. I hugged my brother and rubbed his back as he soaked the shoulder of my shirt. \"If you want,\" I pulled away and looked closely at him. \"I'll buy you a new one.\" He smiled and nodded. That was all I needed. I smiled at him and headed out. I took a much wanted shower and put on an off-the-shoulder red top and black flannel pajama pants. I then brushed out my long and curly dark brown hair. I put it in a pony-tail, ate dinner, and listened to music before falling asleep. I tossed and turned for some of the night when I heard voices talking. One sounded like an agressive boy while the other sounded like a girl that just wanted to be the nice person. The boy kept shouting at me to wake up while the other sounded nicer. I opened my eyes. . . to nothing. I shook my head and pulled my headphones off of my head. I heard voices talking downstairs and ripped the covers off to see who it was. When I got to the bottom of the stairs, I saw Mom, Dad, and Max talking about the cookies that Mom and I had made for Max's class. I thought nothing of it until my eyes widened at one of the cookies that had a huge shark-bite and another that was singed enough to turn it into a hockey-puck. \"What happened?\" I asked him, completely ignoring my parents. They all looked at me and Dad shrugged it off. \"It was nothing. . .\" \"Max ate all of the cookies that we baked!\" Mom said. I rose an eyebrow at everyone then looked back at the morphed cookies in front of me. \"Somehow, I doubt that,\" I said with a hint of sarcasm in my voice. I rubbed my head and the sleeve on my right shoulder dropped, adding to my I'm too tired to deal with all of this crap this late at night face. Max looked greatfully at me. Mom sighed. \"Eyes closed, mouths closed,\" she instructed us. Max copied her sigh and I looked tiredly at her. \"Now?\" we inquired together (See guys, I can use big words too!). Mom nodded. \"Now,\" she stated. We looked at eachother and did as told. I got as far as the stairs until I tripped and I heard a bang come from the kitchen, assuming that Max ran into the wall. \"You can wait until your in bed to close your eyes,\" Mom told us. We smiled at her sheepishly then headed back to bed. When I finally reached deep sleep (is it REM sleep or the other one?) I had the strangest dream. Dream Sequence I was holding a pen, and every time I moved it, a stream of light would follow. I was playing around with it, which is pretty entertaining let me tell you, when I spotted a figure drowing in an ocean nearby. I swan dove into the freezing water and swam as fast as I possibly could. When I did reach them, I pulled them to shore. I dragged them onto the sand of the beach and took a better look at them. Shark suit, shark fin, dark hair, tanned skin. They weren't breathing. I started doing CPR on them when I felt their pulse and they opened their eyes.","LastChapter":"Hey! How Y'all doin'?

I felt like writing. I like this movie. Here is the result of all these things combined. I hope you like it! Oh, and I don't own The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl or any of the characters in it, blah blah blah. Ok, on with the story! Summary: \"We are each other's opposite. But, in being so, we balance each other out. With all our opposing features, our minds and bodies are able to form a perfect relationship that fit together like puzzle pieces.\" SharkboyxLavagirl. Rated T for mild sensuality. Sharkboy's POV Oh, how I love her. The way her flaming pink hair flows about her face like dancing fire; the way the lava that criss-crosses across her suit becomes brighter when her emotions flare; the way her skin is as hot as an inferno, and yet I still wish to hold her hand. How can feelings this strong go unnoticed? She acts as if there is nothing between us. The last time she showed any sign of affection was when we last saw Max. She held my hand then. Well, it was actually my finger. But still, it's something, right? Now there's nothing. She hasn't even touched me since then. I just wish she would do something to show she feels the same way about me. That is, if she does feel the same way about me. Lavagirl's POV Oh, how I love him. The way his hands flex menacingly whenever someone does something to upset me; the way his body moves fluidly through water; the way his temper rises at even the slightest thing. I can't stand holding these feelings inside anymore. It's killing me. I feel like I might explode at any moment. I haven't touched him since our last goodbye to Max, for fear of hurting him. I'm getting hotter every day. I can feel my temperature rise each time I see him, each time we talk. I don't know how he feels about me, though. He doesn't appear to have any feelings toward me that are more than friendship. The thought of living like this for the rest of my life, \"just friends\" with the boy I love, makes my heart ache and my body hurt. Yup, extremely short chapter. :P I'd appreciate a review.[Chapter 2] Last chapter as of now. I don't know what else I could do with this, unless I went into a \"more involved\" scene, in which case I'd probably have to change the rating to M, so... This is all for now. All from Lavagirl's POV. \"Sharkboy,\" I whispered, touching his shoulder gently. He woke and sat up, rubbing his eyes and looking around confusedly. \"What is it?\" he asked. \"I need to tell you something,\" I said. \"Can't it wait until morning?\" \"No, I don't think it can.\" Worry flashed in his eyes. \"What is it?\" he repeated. \"Is something wrong?\" \"No, no. Nothing's wrong,\" I replied. \"It's just…\" \"Please tell me,\" he said. He reached over and took my hand. Right now I was literally burning up, and I was sure it was hurting him, but no sign of pain crossed his face. \"I love you,\" I said plainly and quickly, just wanting to get it over with before I could change my mind. He stared at me like I was insane or something. \"What did you say?\" \"I love you,\" I said again, this time with more confidence. I heard him breathe deeply. He was still staring at me intently, his eyes never leaving mine. \"Lavagirl,\" he whispered, sounding exactly like I had when I had whispered his name, soft and caring. He leaned closer to me, so close that I could feel his cool breath on my face. \"I've been waiting for you to say that for so long,\" he said. His gaze flickered down to my lips, and I knew what was coming. I briefly thought about what the heat that was now radiating off of my body might do to him, but that notion was extinguished in a flash as his icy lips pressed firmly against mine. I immediately felt cold, as if all the warmth in my body had been stolen away and replaced with ice. I felt him cringe, but his lips didn't leave mine. I somehow knew that he was experiencing the same as I was, only the other way around. He probably felt like he was on fire. Suddenly, all the heat rushed back into my body, but then left again as soon as it had arrived. I didn't even have time to react, though, before the warmth was there again. Eventually everything leveled out, and for the first time in my life, I felt like my temperature was normal. I didn't feel hot or cold. It felt like my body was a perfect blend of fire and ice, warmth and coolness, lava and water. Of course, he isn't Waterboy, but he might as well be. It felt as if cool water was flowing through my veins, mixing with the burning lava that normally filled me up. It felt absolutely amazing. Sharkboy shuddered, and I almost pulled away, but he brought me closer, deepening the kiss. I suppose the shudder was one of happiness and pleasure. I didn't care just then, though. All I could think about was the fact that I was kissing the boy I loved, and that was all that mattered. My hands ran through his spiky hair just as he reached behind my head to run his hands down through my wild, pink fuzzball of a hairdo. Suddenly, Sharkboy's tongue flicked out of his lips, running along my own. I gasped and pulled away, and I immediately felt my body return to its normal boiling temperature. \"What's wrong?\" he asked. I reached up and touched my lips. It had felt as though an electric current had run through my entire body when he had done that. \"Nothing,\" I said. \"That was just… unexpected… but nice, actually.\" He smiled. \"Well, that's good, isn't it?\" He leaned in again, and I met his lips full on. This time it didn't take quite as long for my body's temperature to balance out. The kiss soon became more intense, and Sharkboy once again advanced to the next step. The electricity ran through my body like lightning, but I enjoyed every moment of it. After a while, it was Sharkboy who pulled away. He looked into my eyes, and then pulled me into a tight embrace. \"Doesn't it hurt you?\" I asked, concerned. \"Not at all,\" he breathed. \"In fact, it feels wonderful.\" We are each other's opposite. But, in being so, we balance each other out. With all our opposing features, our minds and bodies are able to form a perfect relationship that fit together like puzzle pieces. \"I assume this means you feel the same about me,\" I said. He felt him nod briefly against my shoulder, and I was fine with that for an answer. I knew that he would tell me straight out when he was ready. Until then, I was content to just be in his arms forever, my heat balancing out his cold, his cool water dousing my burning flames.

When i looked at my hands they looked transparent, and so did the rest of me. It took a few seconds for the transparency to pass, but when i looked at myself afterwards i realized i didn't know who i was. I looked around at my surroundings, and they were also unfamiliar. There was no one, it seemed deserted. I saw a tall tower, and a volcano. There were still no people. \"Hello? Is anyone here? Hello?\" I yelled, but there was no answer. Where was I? Who was I? And why wasn't there anybody here? These were the questions that were going through my head. I began to pace,my legs felt sore. When i was walking to my right i saw a note on the ground, i bent over and picked it up. 'Dear New Dream, I know you are probably feeling strange. You are probably wondering where you are, well...you are on Planet Drool. A planet i created. Your name is Saltwater, since you grew up in the ocean-' \"Yes can i help you?\" I was interrupted by a voice from behind me. When i turned around i saw two eyes, and a mouth just floating. They seemed to be made out of metal, and after a few seconds the mouth smiled,which made me feel a little better. \"You can help me actually. Who are you? And why am i here?\" \"I am Tobor, and you are here because someone here needs your help.\" \"There are other people here?\" I asked. The mouth let out laugh. \"Of course! Ha ha.\" Okay so i wasnt alone here. Great. \"But who am i here to help?\" \"Sharkboy, he's the king of the ocean. And he has been lonely, so Max dreamed you up to become Queen.\" I was shocked. I just got here and now i was going to become Queen of the ocean, this was so strange. Who was Sharkboy? I had never heard this name before. \"Well where does Sharkboy live? Where can i find him?\" \"He lives at the bottom of the Sea of Conciseness. You'll see his castle when you swim down there. He should be waiting for you.\" The floating face turned and floated away. I was left alone, i walked to the edge of the large body of water and stared into the water. I looked at my reflection. I had long brown hair, it went past my shoulders. My eyes were a greenish blue. I stood up and looked at my body. From my shoulders down, it looked like i had on a green scalely top, and from my waist down it looked like a blue scalely pants. I was thinking i was a mermaid without a tail, but i was pretty sure that would change when i hit the water. I back up a few feet. I ran and dove into the water, but when i was under the water i could breathe,it felt good to be here in the water. I was right about my legs, they became one tail when i was in the water. I began my dive, there were many animals in these waters. Mostly sharks, but they count as animals. They all could talk, and they all knew my name, but i didnt stop. I kept diving. Down down,down through the crystal clear water. I soon found the castle that Tobor had told me about, it was amazing, it was large, and beautiful. \"Wow,\" I thought \"' amazing.\" I swam down to the large door and knocked, and it opened by itself. My tail split into legs again, and i walked in. The sharks stayed outside to guard. When i walked in there were a few other guards half fish, or shark, half human. They led me into a great hall, with high ceilings, and a magnificent thrown. \"Stay here, the king will be out soon.\" The guard said to me, then he walked away. His voice was deep, and he wore a helmet so i couldnt see his face. I waited there pacing looking at the pictures that were painted on the celing. Soon i heard trumpet, without thinking i kneeled on one knee, and put my head down, chin to chest. I heard someone walk up in front of me, but i didnt dare look up, and the person didnt dare to speak. My started to beat faster when i heard the person kneel as well. \"It's okay,\" I thought to myself \", this is why you're here. CALM DOWN!\" I lifted my head, and to my surprise the boy in front of me was smiling. He seemed to be laughing as well. This made me feel better. \"Okay,\" I now thought \", this is going to be fun.\"[Chapter 2] Queen of the Ocean Chapter 1 I felt strange, like my body wasn't put together. When i looked at my hands they looked transparent, and so did the rest of me. It took a few seconds for the transparency to pass, but when i looked at myself afterwards i realized i didn't know who i was. I looked around at my surroundings, and they were also unfamiliar. There was no one, it seemed deserted. I saw a tall tower, and a volcano. There were still no people. \"Hello? Is anyone here? Hello?\" I yelled, but there was no answer. Where was I? Who was I? And why wasn't there anybody here? These were the questions that were going through my head. I began to pace,my legs felt sore. When i was walking to my right i saw a note on the ground, i bent over and picked it up. 'Dear New Dream, I know you are probably feeling strange. You are probably wondering where you are, well...you are on Planet Drool. A planet i created. Your name is Saltwater, since you grew up in the ocean-' \"Yes can i help you?\" I was interrupted by a voice from behind me. When i turned around i saw two eyes, and a mouth just floating. They seemed to be made out of metal, and after a few seconds the mouth smiled,which made me feel a little better. \"You can help me actually. Who are you? And why am i here?\" \"I am Tobor, and you are here because someone here needs your help.\" \"There are other people here?\" I asked. The mouth let out laugh. \"Of course! Ha ha.\" Okay so i wasnt alone here. Great. \"But who am i here to help?\" \"Sharkboy, he's the king of the ocean. And he has been lonely, so Max dreamed you up to become Queen.\" I was shocked. I just got here and now i was going to become Queen of the ocean, this was so strange. Who was Sharkboy? I had never heard this name before. \"Well where does Sharkboy live?

His chocolate brown eyes sparkled. \"You know, for as long as i've been king. No one has bowed for me.\" \"Well sorry, it just was what seemed right.\" \"Don't apologize, it's alright. You know you can get up.\" He gave another little chuckle. I came up out of my daze, and looked down at my knee that was still against the tile floor. The boy grabbed my hand and lifted me to my feet. I looked up. The boy was quite tall, he had fins, gills, and white teeth. but he had straight brown hair that was styled on top of his head, and chocolate brown eyes, all set on tan skin. \"So,\" he interjected \", what's your name?\" \"I'm Saltwater, what about yourself?\" \"Sharkboy. Max told me you would be coming.\" Sharkboy still held my hand, fingers laced through mine, and lead me up the stairs by the large thrones. I looked around, but I was afraid to look at him, but i didnt know why. \"You do know why you are here, dont you?\" He asked me. He put his hand under my chin and pulled my face to look at him. \"Yes, I do. I am to be your queen.\" He smiled again and pulled me through the house, still holding my hand. He opened this large door, and when i walked through i saw this colossel bedroom. Beyond anything i could've imagined. \"Here sit down on the bed. I'll be right back.\" I went to the edge of the large four post bed, and sat down. Sharkboy went into what looked like a closet, which was also large, and dissappered for a few","LastChapter":"Queen of the Ocean Chapter 1 I felt strange, like my body wasn't put together.

The sound of the rolling waves as they slapped against thenhot sand. The vast sea life that made it mysterious. The way thensunset made it shimmer. Everything… Henloved it all. Sharkboynlet the gentle waves carry him. He always found it relaxing to floatnon his back, clearing his mind and letting his built up anger bencarried away with the gentle flow. Without the ocean, he would surelynbe lost. \"Sharky….\" Anothernthing that calmed him was the voice that called him by that sillynnickname. It was so gentle and soothing. \"Sharky…\" Sonloving… \"Sharkboy!!\" Sharkboy'sneyes snapped opened. He hesitantly tilted his head back towards thenshore. A glowing figure was waving to him from the dock, flashing himnthe most dazzling smile he'd ever seen. Henwhispered her name \"Lavagirl…\", and submerged himself below thenwaves, letting his dorsal fin stick up through the water as henquickly swan toward her. Lavagirlngiggled, letting her arms drop to her sides. Henlifted his head from the water and gave her a toothy grin. \"What'snup?\" \"Maxnis looking for us.\" she said, helping him up onto the dock. Sharkboynsighed. \"Don't tell me his head got stuck in the bucket again?\" \"Nonno no,\" she laughed, lightly slapping his arm. \"He wants us to gonsomewhere with him.\" \"Where?\" \"Indon't know. All he said is that he needs us to come to Earth, andnhe'll explain when we get there.\" Sharkboynnodded, but bared his teeth in a vicious frown as he said \"But ifnhis head is stuck in that bucket again…\" \"C'mon,nSharky.\" Lavagirl giggled, pulling him toward the shark shapednrocket. XXXXX Maxnstood in front of the wide clearing; the clearing where he first sawnthe amazing rocket that brought Sharkboy and Lavagirl to him fromnplanet Drool. He shielded the sun's rays with his hands as henscanned the sky and nervously shuffled his feet. Henbit his lower lip in anticipation as a stream of smoke came intonview, hurdling toward him. \"Comenon, guys. You can do it…\" Thenrocket did a vertical spin so the tip of the shark's nose wasnfacing the sky. It started to slow down as it neared the ground,nlanding with a thud and releasing smoke from the tail end. \"Yes!\"nMax smiled and sprinted down the hill in excitement. Anlarge door opened as the smoke cleared, making his best friend'snvisible as they stood in the entrance. \"Youndid it perfectly!\" Sharkboynglared at him as he walked down the lowered ramp. \"Of course I did.nWhy wouldn't I do it perfectly?\" \"Chill,nSharky,\" Lavagirl said, putting a hand on his shoulder. She gavenMax a smile. \"It's easy to land now that you dreamed the controlsninto the rocket, Max.\" \"Yeah,nit needed them after those numerous crashes and failed attempts atnlanding.\" he laughed, earning another piercing glare from Sharkboy.n\"But c'mon! I have something to tell you!\" Maxnled them past the school's campus and across the street to hisnhouse. He let them in and up to his room, closing the door behindnthem. \"Ok,nguys, just wait 'till you see these!\" he said, opening hisndresser drawer and shuffling through cloths. He pulled what he wasnlooking for out, and turned to his two companions. Henplaced a small strip of paper into their hands, beaming with joy. Sharkboynstudied the paper before giving Max a doubtful look. \"You callednfor us to come all the way to Earth so you could give us paper?\" \"It'snnot just paper, Sharkboy.\" Max said, holding his own strip.n\"They're tickets.\" \"Tickets?\"nLavagirl asked. \"Yeah.nFor the new amusement park that opened up across town.

Thanks!\" Maxnreturned her smile. \"We are renting out one of the cabins for thenwhole weekend, so we'll be able to go through the whole park andnall of the rides.\" \"Great,na whole weekend at an amusement park with a baby.\" Sharkboynmuttered, earning him an elbow in the side from Lavagirl. \"Thisnis awesome, Max.\" she assured. Maxnscanned his ticket and passed a glance over at his calendar. \"We'rengoing to leave on Friday, so two days from today. You guys can staynhere until then if you want.\" Sharkboynsnorted. \"As if.\" he said, crossing his arms. \"Well,nI'll stay, Max.\" Lavagirl said, giving him another smile. Sharkboynwhipped his head in her direction. \"What?\" \"Great!nI'll go get the spare bedroom ready.\" Max said before running offnto the extra room located down the hallway. \"Whynare you staying?\" Sharkboy asked. \"Wouldn't it be better if wengo back to planet Drool and make sure we can even go on this stupidntrip?\" \"It'snnot stupid! It's very important to Max.\" she defended. \"Andnwhat's the worse that could happen, Sharky? It's only a couplendays away from Drool; I'm sure it will take care of itself until wengo back.\" Hengave her a pout, crossing his arms and looking away. \"It is stupid. But of course you'd like childish things like this. I, onnthe other hand, have better things I could do.\" Lavagirlngave him a disbelieving look. \"It's not childish! And you have toncome. Do it for Max, cause I know you love him like a little brotherneven if you don't show it.\" \"Tch…nwhatever. It's stupid and I'd rather go back to Drool instead ofnstaying here with a bunch of babies until we get this thing overnwith.\" \"Fine.nGo back instead of staying here.\" Hengrabbed her arm and anxiously pulled her toward the door. \"Great,nlet's go then… ouch!\" he screeched, pulling away and lookingnat the new burn mark on his hand. \"I'mnstill staying. You can go back.\" Henlooked back to her. \"Without you?\" Shennodded. \"Yeah, you can just return before we leave. If that willnmake you feel better.\" LeavenLavagirl on Earth by herself? Without him by her side? Sharkboy knewnwell enough that she could stand up for herself without his help, butnjust the thought of her being on a different planet without him…nand staying in the same house with another boy without him. Oh,nthat got his insides boiling. Sure,nMax wouldn't try anything, knowing that he'd be fed a knucklensandwich, but those creepy boys in his class would.

Chaptern2 \"I'mnleaving now!\" Max called up the stairs as he quickly slipped on hisnshoes. \"I'll be back by 4, okay?\" \"Okay!\" Lavagirlnwatched Max run across the street and join his friends on their waynto school from the spare bedroom's window. She smiled, happy thatnMax now has friends to be with while her and Sharkboy were in Drool. \"Nnnh…\" Lavagirlnlooked at the bed occupied by a jumbled mess of blankets and pillows,nand couldn't help stifling a giggle. Shenwalked over to the bed and lifted the blanket covering the sleepingnform underneath. \"It'sntime to wake up, Sharky.\" Sharkboynpeeked open his eyes and looked up at the smiling girl. He frowned,nturned over and groaned out, \"What time is it?\" \"8:30.\" \"Thennit's not time to wake up.\" Henpulled another blanket over him and snuggled deeper into the pillows.nThough Lavagirl thought his sleeping arrangements were utterlynadorable (and quite awkward for someone like him) she flipped thenlast of the blankets from the bed. \"It is .\" Sharkboynshivered from the sudden rush of cold air against his warm skin.nDamn, they need to turn their air conditioner down. \"C'mon, LG…n\" Lavagirlnsighed, looking down at the shivering form. \"If you're cold, whyndon't you just wear more than a pair of boxers when you sleep andnnot steal all of the blankets?\" Sharkboy,nin fact, was only wearing black boxers. Henblushed, sitting up and rubbing his hands up and down his arms. \"It'snuncomfortable to sleep in my uniform.\" \"Thennwhy didn't you just borrow a t-shirt and shorts from Max?\" shenasked, pointing to the red shirt and navy blue shorts given to her bynMax the previous night. Seeingnher in Max's clothing made his stomach knot. \"Hmph…nlike I'd borrow cloths from him.\" he muttered, standing up. Lavagirlngave him a disbelieving look. \"You know, you could try to be atnleast a little bit nicer to Max. He is our creator and, mostnimportantly, our friend.\" Sharkboynjust shrugged, putting his arms above his head to stretch, yawning. Ansudden pull on his fin made him jump. \"Ah! What?\" \"Justntry to be nice, okay?\" Hensighed, \"Yeah, yeah…\" and rubbed the sleep from his eyes. Lavagirlngave a small smile and went to making the bed and putting away thenextra blankets. She glanced over at Sharkboy, seeing he was standingnin a tired daze with uniform in hand. She walked over and gave hisnshoulder a light tap. \"Why don't you take a shower? That willnwake you up.\" \"Lettingnme sleep longer would be better.\" Lavagirlnpushed him toward the door. \"Shower.\" Henmuttered an annoyed \"Meh…\" and made his way to the bathroom. XXXXX \"Goodnmorning, Lavagirl,\" Max's mom said, giving her a cheerful smile.n\"Sleep well?\" \"Yes,nthank you.\" Lavagirl replied, taking her seat at the kitchen table. Max'snmom picked up two plates from the counter and brought them to thentable, now giving the pink haired girl a questioning look. \"Indon't know what kind of things you like to eat, dear,\" she said.n\"So, I was hoping that simple eggs and bacon would be okay?\" Lavagirlnlooked at the lump of eggs on one plate and the individual pieces ofnbacon on the other, taking in the delicious smell. She took some eggsnwith her fork and cautiously put it to her mouth. \"It's good!\" \"Good!nI'm glad.\" the excited mother exclaimed, delighted that she likednher cooking. Shenthen set a plate with thin slices of, what seemed to be, cooked fishnon the table. \"And I know Sharkboy will like this?\" \"Ofncourse, he loves fish.\" Lavagirl said, now trying a piece of thencrisp bacon. \"Inhope he likes the way I cooked it. He looks like a picky littleneater.\" Lavagirlnshrugged. \"I think he'll like it better than that sickly raw fishnhe eats everyday.\" Thenmother cringed at the thought of someone eating a raw fish (and notnthe sushi kind). And,nspeak of the devil, the \"picky little eater\" entered the kitchen.nHe was nice and clean, smelling of sweet shampoo, with his hairnperfectly spiked and uniform on. \"Goodnmorning, Sharky.\" chimed Lavagirl. \"G'morning.\"nhe replied, taking his seat at the table. He spotted the cooked fishnand eyed them with interest. \"Inmade them just for you, Sharkboy,\" Max's mother smiled, pouringnorange juice into his glass. \"I hope you like them.\" Hentook a slice and cut a small portion with his fork. It smellednalright to him. Not like the fish he was used to eating, but stillngood. He noticed Max's mom watching him, waiting to see is reactionnto her cooking. He took a bite and chewed, finding the flavor ofncooked fish good… really good actually. \"It'snokay.\" he said, taking another bite. \"Good.\"nthe mother smiled, continuing her cooking at the stove. \"So,\"nLavagirl said, turning her attention to him. \"I was thinking wencould pick Max up from school today, Sharky.\" \"Oh,nMax would love if you two were to pick him up!\" his mother said,nnow washing the pan she used to cook breakfast. \"Donyou want to?\" Lavagirl asked. Sharkboyndidn't really want to go across the street just to have to walknright back. Couldn't Max handle walking home by himself? \"Do younreally want to?\" \"Yeah,\"nshe said, scooping up another fork full of eggs. \"ThennI don't care.\" Ifnit made Lavagirl happy, he didn't mind. \"Thanks,nSharky!\" Sharkboy'sncheeks let off a pink hue. \"Whatever.\" XXXXX \"Nonfair! No fair! No fair!\" yelled the spiky haired boy, quicklynpressing buttons on a playstation controller. \"No no no no no!\" \"Inwin again!\" Lavagirl shouted excitedly, as Sharkboy's fightingncharacter fell over and the words \"Player 2 Wins!\" flashed acrossnthe TV screen. \"That makes the score 5 - 0!\" Sharkboynthrew the controller down and stubbornly folded his arms across hisnchest. \"This game is rigged!\" \"Don'tnbe such a sore loser, Sharky.\" Lavagirl laughed at her friend'snpouting face. \"You want to try again?\" \"No,nI'm bored of this thing.\" he said, pushing away the PS2 consolenwith his boot. \"Doesn't Max have anything else?\" \"Hmm…\"nLavagirl looked around Max's room, searching for something else tonpass the time. There wasn't really anything to do in Max's room;nit was pretty plain, having only a bed, side table, TV (withnplaystation), and a shelf with knickknacks and action figuresncarefully positioned on it. \"Ugh,nthis is so boooooooring!\" Sharkboy fell to his back, sprawling outnacross the floor. He huffed, \"Is it time to get Max yet?\" Lavagirlnlooked over to the rocket ship shaped alarm clock. It read 2:53 itnbig red numbers. \"No,\" she said. \"We still have over an hour.\" Theynboth let out heavy sighs. \"Bored,nkids?\" came a voice from the door. They looked up to find Max'snmother holding a basket of laundry. \"Yeah,nwe played Max's game machine and don't know what to do next.\"nreplied Lavagirl. Max'snmom beamed. \"Well, you could always help me with the chores!\" \" Chores ?\"nSharkboy gave her an annoyed look. \"Incould use the help.\" \"Sure!nWe'll help! Right, Sharky?\" Lavagirl chirped, looking over to thenyoung shark still lying on the floor. \"ButnI-\" \"Excellent!\"nthe mother said. \"You two can straighten up Max's room and thenspare bedroom while I do this laundry.\" \"Sure,\"nsaid Lavagirl. \"Thanksna million, guys. The cleaning supplies are in the hallway closet.\"nshe said, and with that she made her way downstairs to start thenlaundry. Oncenhe couldn't hear her steps anymore, Sharkboy sat up and whippednaround to face Lavagirl. \"Indon't want to do chores!\" \"Inwas only being nice.\" she defended. Sharkboynlet a growl slip from his sharp teeth in annoyance. Lavagirlnpulled on his arm, urging him to stand up. \"C'mon, Sharky. Itnwon't be that bad. At least it will pass the time. Please?\" Sharkboynsighed, standing up. \"Alright.\" Lavagirlngave him a big smile, and pulled him out of the room to fetch thencleaning supplies. XXXXX \"Done!\"nLavagirl wiped her hands clean on a towel and looked over her worknwith satisfaction. She wiped down all of the bedside tables and evennthe head boards on the beds. The beds were neatly made and everythingnwas put away.

Shenwalked down the hallway to Max's room and peeked inside. Sharkboynwas laying on Max's bed, sound asleep. Lavagirl sighed, walkingnover and taking a seat at the edge of the bed. She stared down at thensleeping boy's face. Itnlooked so calm and innocent when he was sleeping. Not like when henwas awake, bearing his razor sharp teeth and frowning. He hardly evernsmiled and it made Lavagirl wonder if we was ever happy. She gentlyntouched his the side of his face with her finger tips and ran themndown his cheek. \"Younweren't supposed to fall asleep.\" she whispered. Lookingnat the clock, she noticed it was already 3:46. Time to get Max. Shenlooked back to Sharkboy and smiled. \"I'll let you sleep just thisnonce.\" she said, leaning down and placing a light kiss on hisncheek. Ansizzling sensation filled Sharkboy's body, sending a shiver downnhis spine. Evennwhile sleeping, he felt the amazing sensation. Lavagirlnleft the room and down the stairs to tell Max's mother she wasnleaving. Sharkboynslowly opened his eyes and sat up. He lifted a gloved hand to hisncheek, blushing like crazy.

Holden sighed, sitting at the bar, sipping his beer. Sean was playing pool with several other guys, looking up at him frequently and flashing him that beautiful grin. They came here every weekend because no one knew who Sean was, and they welcomed gay couples without any complaints. Sean and Holden had been dating nearly half a year and Holden thought they would move in together soon. They spent a lot of time together into the night at each other's homes, but they had yet to sleep together; Holden really wanted it to be special. Holden sipped at his beer, watching Sean play pool and felt warmth spreading through his chest just at seeing the other male. \"Hey, what's your name?\" Holden turned to the voice coming from in front of him. It was a large, muscled man with brown hair and tan skin. He was attractive, but Holden had no interest. He was more then happy with whom he had. \"Holden.\" He replied, not really wanting to strike up a conversation. \"That's an odd name. You're kinda cute; you wanna come with me back to the restroom?\" He asked, reaching out and playing with the top button of Holden's button-up shirt. \"No thanks.\" Holden said, trying not to sound rude. \"Come on, don't be shy; I'll take it slow for you.\" He said, smiling and pulling at the button until it popped loose. \"Please, I'm with someone else.\" Holden replied, trying to pull away from the other man. However, he placed his hand on Holden's thigh, rubbing it. \"Oh come on, don't make me force you.\" He said, voice getting harsher. Holden looked up at him and got a bit scared. The man's eyes were filled with frustration, and the muscles in his arm were bulging, Holden's leg stinging in pain. Holden worked out regularly, but he wouldn't be able to stop this man if he wanted to do something to him. He looked over his shoulder at Sean, who was eyeing them, face contorted in concern. He seemed to catch the fear in Holden's eyes, but then the man was speaking again. \"Look, I don't get any no's to this sort of thing. Come with me or I might have to make you.\" He said through gritted teeth, hand moving to grip Holden's arm tightly. \"Hey, do you have a problem?\" Holden breathed in relief inwardly at Sean's voice, and the man turned, revealing Sean with his arms crossed over his chest, looking at them. \"No; do you have a problem?\" The man questioned, letting go of Holden's arm to turn fully to Sean. \"Well, you had your hand on my boyfriend, so yeah, I do.\" \"Oh, this is your boyfriend?\" The man asked, turning back to Holden. Then, he grabbed Holden's arm, and spat on him. \"He's a dirty little bitch.\" The man stated. Then, Sean punched him in the jaw, sending the man toppling to the ground. Before Holden could do anything, Sean was on top of the man, punching him relentlessly in the face. Finally, with people crowded around the brawl, Holden snapped out of his shock and hopped off the stool, grabbing at Sean's arms, attempting to pull him off of the other male. \"Sean, stop!\" Holden said, with more of a begging tone then he intended. But it got the desired effect. Sean immediately stopped throwing punching, allowing Holden to hold his arms still as he panted, chest heaving. \"Call him that again or even come near him and I'll do a lot more then that!\" Sean roared. \"You guys need to leave before I have to call the cops.\" The bartender said to Holden, knowing the two of them well and being sympathetic. Holden nodded, and grabbed Sean's arm tightly, leading him out of the bar and back to the Hummer. They stood at the front of it, Sean grabbing Holden's arms gently and turning him around to face him. \"Are you okay?\" Sean asked, reaching a hand up and wiping the forgotten saliva from Holden's face and shaking it onto the ground. \"Yeah, I'm fine.\" Holden reassured him, but Sean was already pushing Holden's sleeve up gently to see where the man had grabbed him. There was a bruise already forming. \"That dickhead, I should go back in there and kick punch his face in…\" Sean said, beginning to turn back toward the bar. \"No, Sean, stop!\" Holden said, grabbing his arm and pulling him back toward him. Then, he leaned in and kissed the other male gently, hands holding his face. It took Sean a moment to settle down from his rage and then he groaned into the kiss, gripping Holden's hips and lifting him onto the hood of the Hummer, returning the kiss passionately. Holden ran his hands down Sean's chest, and Sean's hands went flat along the small of his back, caressing the skin under the fabric. Finally, they pulled apart, and Holden was glad the parking lot was vacant. Sean ran a hand along the side of his face. \"Did I ever tell you how beautiful you were?\" He asked. Holden blushed, pressing his forehead against the other male's. \"Yeah, once or twice. I hate how turned on I get when you stand up for me.\" Sean chuckled, running his hand down to weave their fingers together. \"I told you I would never let anyone touch you like that.\" Holden nodded, \"I know…thank you.\" \"It's kind of selfish you know,\" Sean went on, \"I do it because I want to be the only one that can touch you like that. I want to be the only one who gets to be this lucky.\" Holden blushed again, and then Sean was kissing him again. Holden's legs weaved around Sean's back, and their hands were everywhere, touching, caressing. But Sean knew where to stop, knew how far Holden was willing to go and respected it. They pulled apart again, both breathless now. \"Time to go home?\" Sean asked. Holden nodded, running his hands through the other male's hair before Sean lifted him off the hood and back onto the ground. They got in the Hummer, and when Sean turned the key, Holden spoke. \"We can still make out in the parking lot, though.\" Sean grinned widely at him, and then they drove away.","LastChapter":"Wreckless Love By: KellyCRocker59 This is pure fluff, I won't lie.

I really wish there were more stories about these two; please review, I love encouragement (or constructive criticism if necessary)! Holden looked out the window of the Hummer thoughtfully, watching the building pass by as the vehicle followed its course from his apartment to the restaurant that they would be attending that night. The other male in the vehicle was none other then Sean Jackson. While Holden wasn't too into sports, he did in fact know who Sean Jackson was. Now, however, as he rode with the other male in his extremely expensive car, he wondered if he truly knew the other man at all. This whole thing started last week, when he had decided to accompany his sister to a football game; she was way into sports, and had begged him to come with her. It had been sweltering hot outside and after the game he had been walking down to use the bathroom when he bumped into someone bulkier then him, the impact knocking a bit of breath from his lungs. He looked up and saw Sean Jackson, garbed in a tight white t-shirt and shorts, in front of him. \"Oh, I'm sorry.\" The football player said. \"It's fine, I wasn't really watching where I was going; you're Sean Jackson, right?\" Holden asked, being sure that he hadn't mistaken him for someone else. \"I guess you're not much of a football fan, are you?\" Sean responded with a broad smile. \"Well…not exactly. I mean I just came because my sister was begging me to. Why are you out here anyway? Shouldn't you be celebrating your victory in the locker room or something?\" Sean laughed; it was a full, deep sound. It also kind of made Holden's stomach leap a bit as he smiled back at the other man. \"Usually yeah, I guess; I came out this way though because my manager told me that she overheard a big group of girls talking about sneaking in and bombarding me as I was showering.\" Sean explained. \"Oh; I'm sure you're used to all the women being all over you.\" Holden replied with a slight smile. However, Sean gave a sort of sour smile back. \"What, do you not like all of the women? I mean I'm sure that's one of the benefits for a lot of football players.\" Holden continued, intrigued by the taller male's response. \"Would you like it if women were all over you all the time?\" He countered, his eyes now containing a questioning nature that Holden didn't know whether or not he was comfortable with. This was Sean Jackson and he was a nobody…why not tell a big football star the truth? \"Well, not exactly…I'm kinda not into women…\" Holden said, eyes averted downward to the pavement; it was more difficult then he thought it would be telling this almost-stranger that he liked men. Sean was silent for quite some time, then spoke. \"Would you want to…go out with me sometime?\" Holden was absolutely shocked. His head jerked up to looked into the other male's eyes, which were sincere, banishing any possibility of a joke. Sean Jackson was gay. It was then that Holden realized Sean was just kind of staring at him, still waiting for an answer. \"Oh, sorry, it just caught me a bit off guard. Yeah, sure.\" He said, not wanting to sound too eager. He wasn't one to gush, but Sean Jackson was one very sexy man. Sean smiled, \"Good; here, can you give me your phone number?\" He fished in his pocket, then the other, and made a face. \"Dammit; I forgot it in the locker room.\" \"That's fine, here…\" Holden said, reaching in his pocket and finding a pen that had been complimentary with his purchase of a water bottle earlier that day. He reached down and grabbed Sean's hand, something far more forward then he would normally do. The football player's hand was large, callused, and warm in his as he scrawled his number on the other male's palm. Once he was done, he let go of Sean's hand and put the pen back in his pocket. He smiled up at the football player, who smiled back. \"I'll call you as soon as I can get my manager to free up a night; I promise I won't be a douche about it.\" Sean said, grinning now. Holden chuckled and nodded, \"Good; I'm not sure I could go on a date with a douche.\" And now here he was; Sean had called him that night and apologized that it would take a week to be able to go on the date, but Holden said he was fine with waiting. He looked over now at Sean, whose eyes were on the road. \"Where is it again that we're going?\" He asked. \"Just this little hole-in-the-wall restaurant that I discovered a little while ago. It's Greek; is that okay?\" Sean asked, taking his eyes off the road for a moment to look at the other male. \"Yeah; I haven't had a lot of Greek but it sounds good.\" He replied. The rest of the ride was spent with a bit of small talk, but overall it was fairly quiet. Holden just couldn't seem to find anything to say around the football player; it was like anything in his life would pale in comparison to the other male's celebrity routine. They arrived at the restaurant and were immediately seated under Sean's reservations. It was a very nice place, though there were only one or two other couples in the small vicinity. The two were seated at a table and placed their drinks orders, both ordering water. As they were waiting, Sean spoke. \"So, I really don't want this to be awkward.\" He said slowly, looking at Holden. \"What do you mean?\" He replied, trying to act like he didn't know what he was talking about. \"It's just…I don't want this to be the kind of first date where all we talk about is my life and football and stuff like that.\" The football player explained. \"I don't know the first thing about football so don't worry about that.\" Holden said, smiling at the other male. Sean chuckled and the mood was immediately lifted, now light and carefree. \"So, tell me about you.\" Sean said as their drinks arrived. Holden did so, telling the other male about his family and how close he was with his sister. He told him about his job and how much he loved it, and how he hadn't been on a date in a really long time. Sean listened, seeming interested the entire time and asking questions when they came to him. \"But what about you? And it better be things I can't read out of Us Weekly.\" Holden said jokingly after they placed their meal orders. Sean went on to tell him about how he had been playing football since he was little and loved it, even though his parents had definitely pushed him to go pro. He told him about how his parents didn't know that he was gay and had been waiting a long time for him to bring home a nice girl. He also explained how only a few very close friends knew about it, and that they would never tell anyone. \"It must be difficult meeting people when you're always in the spotlight.\" Holden commented. \"Yeah…that's why when I bumped into you and made sure to find out if you might be interested; it's very rare that I ever see someone as sexy as you at a game.\" Sean said with a smile, though his eyes showed that he was being totally serious. Holden blushed deep red and reached for his water, but a server was walking by and bumped into his elbow. The beverage, half-full, spilled all over his lap. Holden, already flustered, gasped at the cold liquid that saturated his pants and grabbed a napkin, hastily trying to wipe it up. Sean popped out of his seat and stopped the server, telling him that he better 'watch the hell where he was going' and then pulled the clean towel that draped from the man's hip and walked over to Holden, handing it to him. \"Thanks.\" He said, using the towel with much better results then he had the napkin. \"No problem; it's not your fault that jackass doesn't know how to walk.\" Sean said, kneeling beside Holden. Finally, once he had picked away the cubes of ice and placed them in the wet towel, Sean took the towel and stood, walking back to the kitchen. He returned and sat back down. \"They will have another water out in a second.\" Sean said. Silence ensued, before Holden finally spoke. \"Well…that was kind of awkward.\" \"I'm sorry; I wouldn't have brought you here if I knew the new workers didn't know how to actually do their job.\" Sean said, glaring at the server that had bumped into Holden. \"It's fine, really; it was probably my fault anyway.\" Holden said as their food arrived. The two ate in silence for a bit, and then Sean spoke. \"So, now that you've been on a date with the great Sean Jackson are you gonna watch a little more football?\" He asked with a smile. \"Maybe if I know you're playing.\" Holden replied, smiling in return. The rest of the date was filled with small talk and just enough laughs to make everything seem easy. Holden found it extremely easy for him to open up to the football player; he wasn't self-absorbed and was light-hearted just enough to be fun. The ticket arrived, and while Holden had brought his wallet, Sean snatched it up and pulled out his, placing the required amount of money in the pocketbook. \"Did you like the food?\" Sean asked. \"Yeah; it's definitely the best Greek food I've ever had.\" Holden replied. \"Are you sure it wasn't just the company?\" Sean joked. \"Maybe it was.\" He replied, both joking and serious. They left a few moments later and got into Sean's Hummer, heading back to Holden's apartment. \"So…if you don't mind me asking; do you date very many guys?\" Sean asked. \"Well…\" Holden thought about what exactly to say, and settled on the truth, \"no. The way I see it is that if I can't see myself with someone for the long haul, then why would I want to waste my time for the short term? I know a lot of gay guys tend to have a hard time being monogamous but I've never seen what's so difficult about it.\" \"Does that mean you can see yourself with me for the rest of your life?\" Sean asked, smiling. Holden blushed, not realizing that that was exactly what he had said. \"Because if so, I definitely feel the same way.\" Sean continued, and Holden blushed an even darker red. Sean looked over at him and grinned wide, \"You know, you're really adorable when you're embarrassed.\" \"Yeah, you seem to make a habit of making me that way.\" Holden replied, not angry but not exactly joking either. That was when he felt his hand taken in a warm, firm grip. He looked over to see Sean gripping his hand, the football player's eyes still on the road as their joined hands rested on Holden's leg. Holden gripped the hand back, comforted by the warm, firm callousness of the other male's grip. He eyed Sean's expression and felt his heart thump heavily when a smile broke the other male's expression, eyes still on the road. The rest of the drive was silent, but in a nice, comforting way. Like neither one of them needed to say anything; they were content to be in one another's company. Sean walked Holden to his apartment door, no one else in the hallway. Holden unlocked the door and then turned toward the football player, leaning against the frame so that he could be comfortable. Sean smiled down at him, and then spoke, hand resting on the frame of the door slightly above Holden's head. \"So…do you want to do this again sometime?\" He asked. Holden nodded, trying to speak but realizing that his voice was caught as his eyes locked with Sean's intense gaze. \"Good, because I don't think I've ever wanted to stay around someone so much in my life.\" Sean said. And then he was leaning down, and their lips were together. It was the most amazing feeling Holden had ever experienced; the stubble along his jaw against his chin, Sean's hands moving to rest securely on his body, one on his hip the other on his neck. Holden reached up and held Sean's face, feeling the ruggedness in his fingers. That's exactly how the football player tasted; rugged and yet clean, tough and manly, yet gentle. He smelled of pine wood mixed with a calming earthy scent that was intoxicating. Finally, they pulled apart, both gasping for air. Their foreheads were pressed together, and Sean smiled brightly, something that Holden had gotten used to in the short time and didn't want to ever have leave his mind. \"So; I'll see what I can do about getting myself free for tomorrow night?\" He asked. Holden nodded, \"Yeah, that'd be…great.\" Sean chuckled, and leaned down, placing a final gentle kiss on the other male's lips before pulling back and straightening up. \"Have a good night's sleep, Holden.\" He said, smile immediately back on his face. Holden blushed and smiled in return, \"You too, Sean.\" Sean went to leave, but then turned back around, \"Will you…say that one more time?\" \"You have a good night's sleep too, Sean.\" Holden repeated. Sean smiled even wider (if that was possible), \"I'm not used to being just Sean. I like it, especially when you say it.\" Holden blushed as Sean turned and left. He closed the door behind him and leaned against it for a moment, just taking in the night. It could very well be the first night of the rest of his life.","LastChapter":"First Date By: KellyCRocker59 The second fluff story for what is becoming my favorite couple ever!

Holden chuckled and nodded, \"Good; I'm not sure I could go on a date with a douche.\" And now here he was; Sean had called him that night and apologized that it would take a week to be able to go on the date, but Holden said he was fine with waiting. He looked over now at Sean, whose eyes were on the road. \"Where is it again that we're going?\" He asked. \"Just this little hole-in-the-wall restaurant that I discovered a little while ago. It's Greek; is that okay?\" Sean asked, taking his eyes off the road for a moment to look at the other male. \"Yeah; I haven't had a lot of Greek but it sounds good.\" He replied. The rest of the ride was spent with a bit of small talk, but overall it was fairly quiet. Holden just couldn't seem to find anything to say around the football player; it was like anything in his life would pale in comparison to the other male's celebrity routine. They arrived at the restaurant and were immediately seated under Sean's reservations. It was a very nice place, though there were only one or two other couples in the small vicinity. The two were seated at a table and placed their drinks orders, both ordering water. As they were waiting, Sean spoke. \"So, I really don't want this to be awkward.\" He said slowly, looking at Holden. \"What do you mean?\" He replied, trying to act like he didn't know what he was talking about. \"It's just…I don't want this to be the kind of first date where all we talk about is my life and football and stuff like that.\" The football player explained. \"I don't know the first thing about football so don't worry about that.\" Holden said, smiling at the other male. Sean chuckled and the mood was immediately lifted, now light and carefree. \"So, tell me about you.\" Sean said as their drinks arrived. Holden did so, telling the other male about his family and how close he was with his sister. He told him about his job and how much he loved it, and how he hadn't been on a date in a really long time. Sean listened, seeming interested the entire time and asking questions when they came to him. \"But what about you? And it better be things I can't read out of Us Weekly.\" Holden said jokingly after they placed their meal orders. Sean went on to tell him about how he had been playing football since he was little and loved it, even though his parents had definitely pushed him to go pro. He told him about how his parents didn't know that he was gay and had been waiting a long time for him to bring home a nice girl. He also explained how only a few very close friends knew about it, and that they would never tell anyone. \"It must be difficult meeting people when you're always in the spotlight.\" Holden commented. \"Yeah…that's why when I bumped into you and made sure to find out if you might be interested; it's very rare that I ever see someone as sexy as you at a game.\" Sean said with a smile, though his eyes showed that he was being totally serious. Holden blushed deep red and reached for his water, but a server was walking by and bumped into his elbow. The beverage, half-full, spilled all over his lap. Holden, already flustered, gasped at the cold liquid that saturated his pants and grabbed a napkin, hastily trying to wipe it up. Sean popped out of his seat and stopped the server, telling him that he better 'watch the hell where he was going' and then pulled the clean towel that draped from the man's hip and walked over to Holden, handing it to him. \"Thanks.\" He said, using the towel with much better results then he had the napkin. \"No problem; it's not your fault that jackass doesn't know how to walk.\" Sean said, kneeling beside Holden. Finally, once he had picked away the cubes of ice and placed them in the wet towel, Sean took the towel and stood, walking back to the kitchen. He returned and sat back down. \"They will have another water out in a second.\" Sean said. Silence ensued, before Holden finally spoke. \"Well…that was kind of awkward.\" \"I'm sorry; I wouldn't have brought you here if I knew the new workers didn't know how to actually do their job.\" Sean said, glaring at the server that had bumped into Holden. \"It's fine, really; it was probably my fault anyway.\" Holden said as their food arrived. The two ate in silence for a bit, and then Sean spoke. \"So, now that you've been on a date with the great Sean Jackson are you gonna watch a little more football?\" He asked with a smile. \"Maybe if I know you're playing.\" Holden replied, smiling in return. The rest of the date was filled with small talk and just enough laughs to make everything seem easy. Holden found it extremely easy for him to open up to the football player; he wasn't self-absorbed and was light-hearted just enough to be fun. The ticket arrived, and while Holden had brought his wallet, Sean snatched it up and pulled out his, placing the required amount of money in the pocketbook. \"Did you like the food?\" Sean asked. \"Yeah; it's definitely the best Greek food I've ever had.\" Holden replied. \"Are you sure it wasn't just the company?\" Sean joked. \"Maybe it was.\" He replied, both joking and serious. They left a few moments later and got into Sean's Hummer, heading back to Holden's apartment. \"So…if you don't mind me asking; do you date very many guys?\" Sean asked. \"Well…\" Holden thought about what exactly to say, and settled on the truth, \"no. The way I see it is that if I can't see myself with someone for the long haul, then why would I want to waste my time for the short term? I know a lot of gay guys tend to have a hard time being monogamous but I've never seen what's so difficult about it.\" \"Does that mean you can see yourself with me for the rest of your life?\" Sean asked, smiling. Holden blushed, not realizing that that was exactly what he had said. \"Because if so, I definitely feel the same way.\" Sean continued, and Holden blushed an even darker red. Sean looked over at him and grinned wide, \"You know, you're really adorable when you're embarrassed.\" \"Yeah, you seem to make a habit of making me that way.\" Holden replied, not angry but not exactly joking either. That was when he felt his hand taken in a warm, firm grip. He looked over to see Sean gripping his hand, the football player's eyes still on the road as their joined hands rested on Holden's leg. Holden gripped the hand back, comforted by the warm, firm callousness of the other male's grip. He eyed Sean's expression and felt his heart thump heavily when a smile broke the other male's expression, eyes still on the road. The rest of the drive was silent, but in a nice, comforting way. Like neither one of them needed to say anything; they were content to be in one another's company. Sean walked Holden to his apartment door, no one else in the hallway. Holden unlocked the door and then turned toward the football player, leaning against the frame so that he could be comfortable. Sean smiled down at him, and then spoke, hand resting on the frame of the door slightly above Holden's head. \"So…do you want to do this again sometime?\" He asked. Holden nodded, trying to speak but realizing that his voice was caught as his eyes locked with Sean's intense gaze. \"Good, because I don't think I've ever wanted to stay around someone so much in my life.\" Sean said. And then he was leaning down, and their lips were together. It was the most amazing feeling Holden had ever experienced; the stubble along his jaw against his chin, Sean's hands moving to rest securely on his body, one on his hip the other on his neck. Holden reached up and held Sean's face, feeling the ruggedness in his fingers. That's exactly how the football player tasted; rugged and yet clean, tough and manly, yet gentle. He smelled of pine wood mixed with a calming earthy scent that was intoxicating. Finally, they pulled apart, both gasping for air. Their foreheads were pressed together, and Sean smiled brightly, something that Holden had gotten used to in the short time and didn't want to ever have leave his mind. \"So; I'll see what I can do about getting myself free for tomorrow night?\" He asked. Holden nodded, \"Yeah, that'd be…great.\" Sean chuckled, and leaned down, placing a final gentle kiss on the other male's lips before pulling back and straightening up. \"Have a good night's sleep, Holden.\" He said, smile immediately back on his face. Holden blushed and smiled in return, \"You too, Sean.\" Sean went to leave, but then turned back around, \"Will you…say that one more time?\" \"You have a good night's sleep too, Sean.\" Holden repeated. Sean smiled even wider (if that was possible), \"I'm not used to being just Sean. I like it, especially when you say it.\" Holden blushed as Sean turned and left. He closed the door behind him and leaned against it for a moment, just taking in the night. It could very well be the first night of the rest of his life.","Summary":" First Date By: KellyCRocker59 The second fluff story for what is becoming my favorite couple ever!

You this above all for you are a wonder you are a dream you are everything... To me. --- You know, if you had asked me to come back here on New Year's, I would've refused. Vehemently. You couldn't have paid me to return to the home of Sean Jackson. Not after the fight we had before I left. I sighed deeply as I recalled the harsh words that were said and the broken expression on Sean's face as I turned on my heel and walked away from him, ignoring Sean's pleas for me to come back. \"I can't be in a relationship with somebody who's embarrassed of me.\" I'll tell you this much - nothing had surprised me more than when I opened my eyes on the plane to see Sean Jackson coming out of the closet live on air. Originally, I'd been going to Los Angeles to pick up my stuff from Sean's house, but now, I was going back for an entirely different reason than what I had intended. I recalled how agonizing the plane ride was after I heard Sean's announcement - if someone had given me a parachute I would've jumped from the plane. ... Okay, no I wouldn't have, but at that moment in time, I would've done anything just to be in his arms again. Suddenly, the fact that it was Valentine's Day no longer upset me. In fact, I was lightheaded and my heart felt... not whole, but better. It wouldn't be whole until I was with him again. So there I was, standing outside Sean Jackson's huge house by the beach, in which the love of my life was probably passed out drunk in his living room. I couldn't help but chuckle slightly at the thought, selfishly comforted by the idea that he missed me that much. I wondered idly to myself whether or not the Captain had been reunited with her family by now. She was a good woman, she deserved more than to just see her son for one night. Twirling the lily flower I held in my hands as I stood outside the front door, I waited until I had the courage to step inside. Was I really going to do this? I thought to myself, pressing my lips together. Did his coming out of the closet live on air really change anything? It was a hard question to answer. But I loved him, I knew that much, and growing up I was taught to always work with what you've got. Our problem before had been the secrecy of our relationship - I hated that. I hated not being able to hold his hand in public, or show him any kind of affection. Whenever I had tried to, stubbornly he'd turn away and scold me for it. Eventually I'd just had enough, snapped, we fought, and that was it. I took the first flight out of Los Angeles and I vowed never to look back. But I did look back. Jesus Christ, I'd barely seen the end of the announcement before I had decided to go back to him. It hurt me horribly to leave him, my heart broke into pieces again just thinking about what we had said to each other. \"This isn't how you treat someone if you love them - you don't treat them like they don't exist in public!\" I recounted all the times I'd called up his publicist's office, before I quickly hung up. There had been so many times over the long two months when I ached to talk to him. When I realized I didn't have the guts to talk to him on my own, I'd watch some of his old interviews, just to hear his voice, tears streaming down my face. I'd stubbornly wipe them away before my sister, whom I was staying with before I got my own place, could see them. But she did. Every single time. My sister had deemed me pathetic, and I knew I was, but not being a stranger to heartbreak, she never commented on it. All of the hurt from the time I was with him to the time I had without him came flooding back to me in one giant wave of agony and I couldn't tell which pain was worse; the heartbreak I went through of him denying me and our love or the heartbreak of not having him at all. My thoughts trailed back to what the Captain had said about my disdain towards heart-shaped candy, and just how right she had actually been. --- \"Why do you hate heart shaped candy?\" Captain Kate Hazeltine asked, an amused smile on her tired face. \"I think it's because that it reminds me that this is Valentine's Day, and I'm... recently single.\" I tried to look as amused as she did, ignoring the gnawing, empty feeling inside of my chest. \"Oh.\" Kate said quietly, turning away from me. \"Yeah - no, we just... weren't on the same page.\" I said quickly, not wanting to make her uncomfortable. \"Sorry.\" She gave me a small, half-hearted smile. \"It's okay.\" I looked down at my lap, willing myself to stay strong. \"It's over.\" I looked over at her so that she could look into my eyes and hopefully believe me. I had always been a shitty liar, but I didn't feel like talking about it, and the conversation would get awkward if details had ot be involved. Most women got angry with me whenever I was nice to them and they found out I was gay - like I was expecting something from being nice. \"Nothing to be done?\" She asked. \"No, no.\" I clarified. \"I've seen the enemy, and the enemy is me.\" --- Despite the fun I had with Kate on the plane, I didn't want to think about it again. Thinking about her analysis of why I hated heart-shaped candy and all the pain I had been put through would just make me think twice about going back to Sean and I didn't want my subconscious telling me it was a bad idea. Instead of thinking about all the times he'd hurt me, I thought of all the times he held me, kissed me, touched me, made love to me - he hadn't told me he loved me, but I knew he did. He didn't have to say it, although sometimes it bothered me that I could tell him a hundred times in one day and all he could manage was a feeble \"You too.\" But none of that mattered now. Nothing else mattered, except him, and the fact that I loved him. All you need is love, right? Letting out one final sigh, I took the key to the front door out of my pocket and unlocked the door as quietly as I could, before stepping inside. Just as I expected, I could see him sitting down on the couch, his head in his hands. He obviously hadn't heard me come in, because his head didn't turn... was he asleep? I approached silently, and with every step I took my heart beat grew faster and faster until I felt certain it was going to jump out of my chest. Oh my God, I'm actually doing this. Had crossed my mind more than once. And I couldn't help but smile. I suppressed the urge to gasp when I actually saw his face. He was within reaching distance of me. Despite how badly I just wanted to jump on him and surprise him, I thought being subtle was a better approach. But dear God was it good to see him again. Suddenly it was as if we'd never broken up. But I knew things would be different this time. I just knew. I ran the lily across his cheek a couple of times softly. He pulled a face in his sleep, before on the fourth time he finally opened his eyes. There was a few moments of silence between us where he looked down at where I was kneeling on the floor, unsure of whether or not I was real, while I just couldn't take the smile off my face. He looked so sad and alone in the dim light of this big, dark house. \"You saw it.\" He said simply, a smile spreading across his face. \"Yeah.\" I replied quietly. \"Yeah, I did.\" And then I couldn't hold back any longer. Replacing the flower with my hand I cupped his cheek, before I stood up from my position at his feet to crush his lips against mine. I'd forgotten the way my body responded to him; suddenly all my senses were alive, and I'd never felt better in my whole life. He tasted like whiskey, and he smelt the way he always smelt - musky, manly - it was intoxication. It took Sean a moment to respond - for a moment I was afraid he wouldn't, but when he responded, he responded. With a low growl, he pulled me forward so that I sat on his lap, and clamped his hands around my face to deepen the kiss. I licked his bottom lip, tasting the strong alcohol on my lover's lips. He opened his mouth, accepting my offer. So for a while, we kissed hungrily, desperately - our hands were everywhere - gripping onto hair, clothes, slipping underneath shirts. I rocked my hips softly into his, and we both groaned from the friction. \"Not now.\" Sean pulled back suddenly, breathlessly. \"Not now.\" \"What?\" I couldn't help but be offended. I had been yearning for him for so long, and to have a kiss like that and not want to get jump each other's bones straight afterwards was a little off-putting. \"Why?\" \"Because...\" He stroked my face with his hands and any negative emotion I had slipped away. \"I want to know how you've been.\" I laughed - I laughed because of how careful he was being with me, and I laughed in relief. I slipped beside him on the couch so we could talk, but Sean put an arm around my shoulders to hold me close. I was glad he did. \"I haven't been doing so well.\" I responded, swallowing the lump in my throat. I looked down at my fingernails. \"I've been missing you. A lot.\" \"I've missed you too.\" I felt his hot breath against my ear as he kissed the spot of skin just beneath my earlobe. His kiss sent shivers of excitement down my spine and I leaned against him. \"I can't believe you actually did it.\" I sighed contently, but I still couldn't look at him for some reason. \"You actually told the whole world that you're gay. I sure didn't see that coming...\" My voice betrayed me by breaking at the end of my sentence. \"Holden...\" Sean said gently, and I felt his finger run under my chin as he tilted my face up to look at his. His blue eyes were full of something I hadn't seen before, but I couldn't place my finger on what it was. \"I'm sorry. You have no idea...\" He cut off for a second, before he licked his lips. \"You have no idea, the guilt I feel for what I put you through - I've had a lot of time to think about what I've done, and I'm sorry I couldn't have done that before I became involved you. I was... I was a coward. Before you came along, I didn't think anything mattered more than football. But when you came along, you changed everything . You meant more to me than anything else in my life, and I let you slip through my fingers because I was an idiot. You know that old saying; you don't know what you've got till it's gone? You were the best thing that has ever happened to me, because you loved me for me, not because I'm Sean Jackson. You loved me; you never cared who I was. That's why you put up with my shit for so long...\" He was looking at our hands, and I gave him a reassuring squeeze. \"I'm not sorry I've fallen in love with you, I'm definitely not ashamed of you, and I want nothing more than to wake up every morning with you laying beside me. I love you, and I don't want you to leave me again. I'm sorry for being such an asshole, and I promise... I promise if you take me back, I'll spend the rest of my life making it up to you.\" I realized then that I was crying. But finally, these tears I was shedding weren't ones of anguish - they were ones of the utter joy that I just could not express with simple words. \"Sorry.\" I said in an small voice, trying to chuckle. I reached my hand up to wipe my tears away, but Sean beat me to it. Sean wiped my tears away with his thumb, and he smiled comfortingly at me. He brought his hands to mine, and we laced fingers. I looked down at our entwined hands and felt as if my heart was about to burst. \"I've always loved you, Holden.\" He repeated, putting his lips against my jaw, before our lips met once more. \"I've always loved you too.\" I whispered against his lips. \"And of course I'll take you back, you stupid jackass.\" Sean laughed - it was my favourite sound in the whole world - and I was pushed back against the couch and my shirt was discarded before I could even blink. We kissed again. But this kiss wasn't hungry and desperate like it had been before; this one was slow, sensual loving - it was a promise of the happiness to come. And that's when I realized I could never leave Sean again. Because when it's real, when you love someone so much that you forget you're your own person and every fiber of your being hurts when you're not around them, you can't just walk away and never come back. No matter how hard you try... you just can't. Because if someone is meant to be yours, they'll always come back to you in the end. --- Okay, so I know it was very lovey-dovey romantic, but hello, the movie was called \"Valentine's Day\".

Instead of thinking about all the times he'd hurt me, I thought of all the times he held me, kissed me, touched me, made love to me - he hadn't told me he loved me, but I knew he did. He didn't have to say it, although sometimes it bothered me that I could tell him a hundred times in one day and all he could manage was a feeble \"You too.\" But none of that mattered now. Nothing else mattered, except him, and the fact that I loved him. All you need is love, right? Letting out one final sigh, I took the key to the front door out of my pocket and unlocked the door as quietly as I could, before stepping inside. Just as I expected, I could see him sitting down on the couch, his head in his hands. He obviously hadn't heard me come in, because his head didn't turn... was he asleep? I approached silently, and with every step I took my heart beat grew faster and faster until I felt certain it was going to jump out of my chest. Oh my God, I'm actually doing this. Had crossed my mind more than once. And I couldn't help but smile. I suppressed the urge to gasp when I actually saw his face. He was within reaching distance of me. Despite how badly I just wanted to jump on him and surprise him, I thought being subtle was a better approach. But dear God was it good to see him again. Suddenly it was as if we'd never broken up. But I knew things would be different this time. I just knew. I ran the lily across his cheek a couple of times softly. He pulled a face in his sleep, before on the fourth time he finally opened his eyes. There was a few moments of silence between us where he looked down at where I was kneeling on the floor, unsure of whether or not I was real, while I just couldn't take the smile off my face. He looked so sad and alone in the dim light of this big, dark house. \"You saw it.\" He said simply, a smile spreading across his face. \"Yeah.\" I replied quietly. \"Yeah, I did.\" And then I couldn't hold back any longer. Replacing the flower with my hand I cupped his cheek, before I stood up from my position at his feet to crush his lips against mine. I'd forgotten the way my body responded to him; suddenly all my senses were alive, and I'd never felt better in my whole life. He tasted like whiskey, and he smelt the way he always smelt - musky, manly - it was intoxication. It took Sean a moment to respond - for a moment I was afraid he wouldn't, but when he responded, he responded. With a low growl, he pulled me forward so that I sat on his lap, and clamped his hands around my face to deepen the kiss. I licked his bottom lip, tasting the strong alcohol on my lover's lips. He opened his mouth, accepting my offer. So for a while, we kissed hungrily, desperately - our hands were everywhere - gripping onto hair, clothes, slipping underneath shirts. I rocked my hips softly into his, and we both groaned from the friction. \"Not now.\" Sean pulled back suddenly, breathlessly. \"Not now.\" \"What?\" I couldn't help but be offended. I had been yearning for him for so long, and to have a kiss like that and not want to get jump each other's bones straight afterwards was a little off-putting. \"Why?\" \"Because...\" He stroked my face with his hands and any negative emotion I had slipped away. \"I want to know how you've been.\" I laughed - I laughed because of how careful he was being with me, and I laughed in relief. I slipped beside him on the couch so we could talk, but Sean put an arm around my shoulders to hold me close. I was glad he did. \"I haven't been doing so well.\" I responded, swallowing the lump in my throat. I looked down at my fingernails. \"I've been missing you. A lot.\" \"I've missed you too.\" I felt his hot breath against my ear as he kissed the spot of skin just beneath my earlobe. His kiss sent shivers of excitement down my spine and I leaned against him. \"I can't believe you actually did it.\" I sighed contently, but I still couldn't look at him for some reason. \"You actually told the whole world that you're gay. I sure didn't see that coming...\" My voice betrayed me by breaking at the end of my sentence. \"Holden...\" Sean said gently, and I felt his finger run under my chin as he tilted my face up to look at his. His blue eyes were full of something I hadn't seen before, but I couldn't place my finger on what it was. \"I'm sorry. You have no idea...\" He cut off for a second, before he licked his lips. \"You have no idea, the guilt I feel for what I put you through - I've had a lot of time to think about what I've done, and I'm sorry I couldn't have done that before I became involved you. I was... I was a coward. Before you came along, I didn't think anything mattered more than football. But when you came along, you changed everything . You meant more to me than anything else in my life, and I let you slip through my fingers because I was an idiot. You know that old saying; you don't know what you've got till it's gone? You were the best thing that has ever happened to me, because you loved me for me, not because I'm Sean Jackson. You loved me; you never cared who I was. That's why you put up with my shit for so long...\" He was looking at our hands, and I gave him a reassuring squeeze. \"I'm not sorry I've fallen in love with you, I'm definitely not ashamed of you, and I want nothing more than to wake up every morning with you laying beside me. I love you, and I don't want you to leave me again. I'm sorry for being such an asshole, and I promise... I promise if you take me back, I'll spend the rest of my life making it up to you.\" I realized then that I was crying. But finally, these tears I was shedding weren't ones of anguish - they were ones of the utter joy that I just could not express with simple words. \"Sorry.\" I said in an small voice, trying to chuckle. I reached my hand up to wipe my tears away, but Sean beat me to it. Sean wiped my tears away with his thumb, and he smiled comfortingly at me. He brought his hands to mine, and we laced fingers. I looked down at our entwined hands and felt as if my heart was about to burst. \"I've always loved you, Holden.\" He repeated, putting his lips against my jaw, before our lips met once more. \"I've always loved you too.\" I whispered against his lips. \"And of course I'll take you back, you stupid jackass.\" Sean laughed - it was my favourite sound in the whole world - and I was pushed back against the couch and my shirt was discarded before I could even blink. We kissed again. But this kiss wasn't hungry and desperate like it had been before; this one was slow, sensual loving - it was a promise of the happiness to come. And that's when I realized I could never leave Sean again. Because when it's real, when you love someone so much that you forget you're your own person and every fiber of your being hurts when you're not around them, you can't just walk away and never come back. No matter how hard you try... you just can't. Because if someone is meant to be yours, they'll always come back to you in the end. --- Okay, so I know it was very lovey-dovey romantic, but hello, the movie was called \"Valentine's Day\".

Holden sat up slowly in the large bed, rubbing his eyes with the palms of his hands. The blankets fell in a pool at his waist, exposing his chest to the warm temperature of the room. He remembered the night before vividly; Valentine's day, going from being completely distraught on the plane to being unbelievably euphoric upon hearing the news to finally arriving here at his… their …home, and being able to spend the night with the only person he wanted to. However, as he looked around the room, he realized the man that was inhabiting his thoughts was gone. He shouldn't be nervous; he knew that Sean was probably just downstairs getting breakfast or something. Sean wouldn't just take off…but it had been quite some time since Holden had seen him. Maybe overnight he realized coming out was a bad idea, and he was currently trying to retract his earlier statement. Then, he looked out the large window and saw Sean jogging in only his sweats through the sand and to the door of the beach house. He immediately cursed himself for always finding the need to over think everything. Moments later Sean appeared through the doorway, glistening with a light sheen of sweat and holding two coffee cups. A massive grin split the football player's face as he spotted the other male in the bed, torso exposed. \"Damn, I forgot how sexy you were in the mornings.\" He said, walking over and handing one of the cups to Holden, who took it while he uncontrollably blushed a deep hue of red at the comment. \"And how self conscious you are sometimes.\" He tacked on, leaning down and placing a gentle kiss to the other male's lips. Sean then turned and walked into the bathroom, grabbing a towel from the counter and wiping the sweat from his face and neck. Holden couldn't help his eyes running down the male's strong back. Sean then turned and Holden's eyes moved to look into the other male's. \"You're really quite...are you compensating for those noises last night?\" Sean questioned, grinning once again as Holden blushed once more. \"No, I just…\" He paused, searching for the right way to say what he was thinking. Sean took a seat on the edge of the bed, expression shifting to genuine concern, \"Seriously, Holden; what's wrong?\" The other male sighed, averting his eyes to the sheets and then spoke, \"It's just…I really didn't think you were gonna choose me.\" He then felt a callused hand running along the stubble of his cheek and down to his chin, which it coaxed up so that Holden was looking back into Sean's eyes. \"Holden; I love you. I never had any doubts about wanting to spend the rest of life with you. It's just…your family just accepts you for who you are, no matter who that turns out to be. Mine, they pushed me into football the second I could toss the ball; I mean, I love it, but…my parents have always had this image in their minds of what a man was supposed to be.

But then, after you forced the choice on me-\" \"I never wanted you to choose between your parents or me…\" Holden interrupted. \"Just let me finish,\" Sean said before starting again, \"-but then I realized that if they ever loved me, then they love me , and that's regardless of who I love.

Sean smiled and leaned in, capturing Holden's lips in his. Then, Holden was sliding onto his back, covers tangling around his lower body as Sean's knees slid between his spread legs, their lips not parting. Their fingers laced together, the calluses on Sean's feeling right at place against Holden's slightly softer ones. Then, Sean pulled back, both males panting. The football player had the other male pinned to the bed, their interlaced hands spread out on either side. \"I love you too, Holden.\" He whispered, that wide smile spreading across his face. With those words, Holden knew it was this man that he would spend the rest of his life with.","LastChapter":"The Morning After By: KellyCRocker59 I absolutely adore this couple to no end; I hope this is good.

You're words are endlessly encouraging :) This turned out longer then expected, so please tell me if there is anything wrong or that just doesn't work well. PLEASE review! I LOVE FEEDBACK! :) Holden wasn't one to get nervous over second dates. First dates, he was a mess almost without fail. But by the second date, he either knew he liked the guy and said guy liked him back, or he was barely interested and was trying to give the person one more chance. But Sean Jackson was different. Despite that fact that their first date had went amazingly well and Holden had blushed like a girl until he went to bed that night, he still just wasn't sure about the football star. He knew that Sean liked him, that wasn't the problem. He was just so afraid that he would do something to make him change his mind. All this went through his head as he drove over to Sean's home for their second date. Sean hadn't been able to go out the night after their first date but the following day he had been sure to free up. Sean had called and told him to wear jeans and a t-shirt, something Holden was less comfortable in then a suit. Plus it left him having no idea what the date would consist of, which was driving him crazy already. He found Sean's house easily; it was massive as expected and sat by the beach without any close neighbors. He walked to the door and rang the doorbell, Sean answering within seconds expectedly. The taller male was dressed in a tight grey shirt and jeans, a smile on his face. He looked like a Greek god. \"Ready for this?\" Sean asked, closing the door behind him and leaving them both very close. \"I'm not sure what 'this' is but yeah…I think so.\" Holden replied, backing up a bit to accommodate Sean's closeness. However, Sean grabbed his hand and held it, warmth spreading immediately through both Holden's hand and then his chest. Sean walked them down to where his Hummer was parked and then let go of Holden's hand so that he could get in. Then they left, driving away from the beach and into the city. The ride was fairly quiet at first, and then Sean spoke. \"So…how's life been since our last date?\" He asked. \"Good, I guess; I mean not much can happen less then 48 hours.\" Holden responded, mentally hitting himself for saying an answer that was both boring and possibly rude. Sean just smiled though, \"Man, I was hoping you were gonna say that you missed me…you're pretty much all I could think about yesterday.\" Holden blushed a deep red, and Sean turned to him; damn his face and its timing to change hues at a red light. Sean reached out and touched the side of his face, thumb running along his jaw. It took Holden's breath away. \"You're so beautiful…\" Sean whispered, and then leaned over and kissed him. It was intense, breathtaking, and everything Holden wanted it to feel like. He kissed Sean back but couldn't move as the football player cupped his cheek and kissed him intensely. However, they were forced to break apart as the car behind them began honking impatiently. Sean pulled away and turned back to the wheel slowly, still eyeing Holden. Then he started driving, and silence ensued. \"I don't usually do something that forward…I'm sorry if I kinda freaked you out.\" Sean said, breaking the tension. Holden found it difficult to speak for a moment, and then finally managed to form a sentence, \"No, it's…it's fine.\" \"I just really like you, Holden…\" Sean continued, \"and I just feel like you could take me or leave me…I'm just trying really hard…\" Holden turned to look at Sean, his hands gripping the steering wheel tightly with a look of distress on his face. \"That's kind of ironic…I was feeling the exact same way.\" Sean looked at him briefly in surprise, \"Really?\" \"Yeah…I feel like anything I could come up with of mild interest is going to pale in comparison to everything going on in your life.\" Sean chuckled, \"Being a famous football player isn't all that special, Holden. I do my thing on the field, chat with my team in the locker room, and maybe talk with the paparazzi once a week. But for the most part, I do my job – which I love – and then go home, so don't feel like I'm any better then you. I'd love to know about your job.\" Holden felt immense relief more then anything. \"Well I'm just part of real estate; there's not much to tell.\" \"Tell me about the houses you've sold; there's got to be something interesting about them. You went into real estate because you love real estate, right?\" Sean asked. \"Yeah…it's just…well, my friends tell me I get pretty obnoxious when I start going off about the houses I see.\" Holden replied, turning a bit red. \"I won't make fun of you, I promise. I just want to know what your passion is.\" Holden sighed, \"Alright…but I'm not making any promises as to how interesting it'll be.\" Sean chuckled, \"Alright.\" Then, Holden started talking about some of the houses he had seen and been in. He told Sean about how beautiful some of them were, and how ridiculous the prices were, and about the couples who he helped. He turned in his seat to face Sean as he got really excited, talking about the way the stone was so intricately placed on certain homes and how some couples hated the great landscaping in the backyard, and how the singles were so much more flexible. Sean listened to all of it. Finally, they arrived at their destination. \"Wow…I'm sorry, I got kind of hyped up about that.\" Holden said as they got out of the vehicle. \"No, I liked seeing you so into something, it was really…cute.\" Sean said with a big smile. Holden of course blushed, and they walked inside. He hadn't looked when they were outside so when they entered, he was surprised at what they saw; they were at a skating rink. \"A skating rink?\" He asked, becoming nervous. \"Yeah; I thought it would be nice doing something besides dinner and a movie.\" Sean explained, grabbing Holden's hand and walking them over to the desk where they could get their skates. Holden was getting really nervous; he was terrible at skating. What if Sean wanted to speed around the rink and all he could do was clutch the railing. Thankfully, there was no one else at the rink. That meant he could at least fall without having a little kid laugh right in his face. Sean got their skates and they sat down at a table, taking off their shoes and putting on the skates. Sean stood with ease, and stretched out a hand to Holden, who took it gratefully. Even with the other male's help he found it difficult to stand, wobbling to his feet. \"Are you okay?\" Sean asked, the shadow of a grin on his face. \"Yeah, let's just get onto the rink.\" Holden said quickly, now gripping Sean's forearm tightly as they headed in that direction. Finally, they made it to the rink (only ten feet from their table) and Sean let go of Holden. The football player rolled out into the middle of the space quickly, gliding along. Holden, however, immediately grabbed the bar on the side, watching the other male without being able to withhold the fear from his eyes. Sean skated over in his direction, stopping in front of him. \"Are you just going to cling to that bar the whole time?\" Sean joked. \"Maybe…\" Holden muttered, eyes locking on the floor. Sean, however, grabbed his arm before Holden could react, and pried him easily from the bar and pulled him just outside of arm's length from it. Holden eyed the bar in horror, and then looked up at Sean, unable to speak. \"Oh, come on, you need to at least try.\" Sean said, smiling. \"I'd rather not snap my neck, thank you.\" Holden stated indignantly. \"Well I would really rather you not either; you're way too cute to walk around with a neck brace.\" Sean said, grinning widely now. Holden got lost in the other male's expression, and then Sean let go. Before the smaller male could grapple to him, Sean skated along the floor to the middle, nearly thirty feet away. \"Come on, you can make it this far,\" Sean encouraged to a frozen, horrified Holden, \"I'll let you kiss me if you do.\" \"That's not that great of a prize.\" Holden grumbled, just loud enough for the other male to hear. Sean laughed, that full sound that made Holden's chest warm, and he was immediately attempting to scoot toward the other male's destination as the laugh reached his ears. Sean stood completely still, crossing his arms as Holden scooted inch by inch closer. Finally, after nearly ten minutes, Holden was within arm's distance of Sean, who was at that point attempting not to burst out in laughter at the sight of the other male stiffly moving each leg in front of the other. Holden reached out suddenly and grabbed Sean's arm, attempting to pull himself the rest of the way to reach the other male. However, Sean wasn't prepared for this, and lost his balance. The football player pulled Holden into his chest instinctively, wrapping his arms around him as they both toppled to the ground. This led to Sean on his back with Holden lying on his chest, their noses nearly touching. Both were left breathless, and then Sean reached up, running his fingers through Holden's hair. \"Do I still get my prize?\" Holden asked, hands clutching at Sean's shirt. Sean nodded, and Holden leaned down, pressing their lips together softly. Sean groaned into the kiss, hands moving to Holden's hips, whose hands rested on Sean's face. Finally, they pulled apart. \"Skating isn't so bad, is it?\" Sean asked. \"It still sucks.\" Holden replied with a smile. They left the skating rink after a few more moments (with absolutely no more skating on Holden's part), heading to eat at a restaurant undisclosed by Sean. On the drive over, Holden, feeling much less nervous then he had at the beginning of the date, pulled Sean's hand from the consol between their seats into his own hand, resting it on his upper thigh. Sean's eyes left the road only briefly to give the other male a bright smile, and for once Holden was able to prevent a blush from spreading across his cheeks. They reached a tiny Chinese restaurant downtown after about twenty minutes, with a steady flow of conversation about family and friends keeping the trip from seeming long at all. They got a seat fairly easily; there were only four other couples in the restaurant, all older. \"This place is amazing; it's the most authentic Chinese restaurant I've ever been to,\" Sean said as they sat, \"I hope you like it.\" \"I'm sure I will.\" Holden replied with a smile. They both ordered water when the waiter appeared, and then the conversation picked up again. \"So, you haven't really told me much about your past.\" Sean began. \"What do you mean?\" Holden asked as the waters arrived. \"You know…like past relationships, college, stuff like that.\" Sean replied. \"Oh…\" Holden said, sipping at his water, \"it's kind of embarrassing.\" \"That's what you said about your job.\" Sean countered. Holden sighed, \"Alright…what do you want to know?\" Sean shrugged, \"I don't know; how was your last relationship?\" \"It was in college,\" Holden began, \"and he was this kind of buff, rugby player.\" Sean nodded, acknowledging that he was listening. \"It lasted about three years, and then…some bad things happened.\" Holden said, eyes trailing to the tablecloth. \"What do you mean?\" Sean asked, curiosity in his tone. \"He just wasn't who I thought he was.\" Holden said. \"Holden, you can tell me…\" Sean urged, concern now lacing his tone. Holden looked up into Sean's eyes and melted. Something about the other male made him want to pour out his heart. \"Well…it was our last year and he was kind of tight on money. This friend of his, he was kind of curious, and he wanted to…try stuff out with another guy. Well, Jake, my ex, talked to me about it and I didn't want to. But his friend really liked me, so he offered Jake some money for me. Jake took it, and then one night when he was over at my dorm, he slipped some roofies into my drink when I was in the bathroom. His friend came over, he left, and…his friend had sex with me.\" Holden's eyes were on the tablecloth again, unable to look into Sean's eyes as he retold the story. Hardly anyone knew. \"He…he raped you?\" Sean asked, his tone tightly restrained. Holden nodded, taking another drink of his water. Then, he looked up. Sean was gripping his napkin so tight his knuckles were red, his eyes locked on Holden. \"Sean, are you…okay?\" Holden asked. \"Was he taken to court?\" Sean asked. \"No…I didn't want anyone to know about it. My parents didn't know I was gay yet and I just…I was ashamed.\" Holden said. \"People should not get away with shit like that!\" Sean exploded, causing several people to look their way. \"Are you okay?\" He asked in a more hushed tone. \"Yeah…yeah, I'm fine now, I hardly think about it anymore.\" Sean relaxed a bit, but was still tense. \"I would never let anyone do that to you.\" He stated matter-of-factly. \"Thanks.\" Holden said with a small smile. \"I mean it…if I see anyone lay a hand on you when you don't want them to, I'll break their wrists.\" Sean said. \"Sean, I'm fine…just tell me about your last relationship.\" Holden replied, trying to change the topic. Sean sighed, sitting back in the chair. \"There was this one guy when I was starting off, right after college. We were kind of together; I mean we messed around and stuff for a while, but neither one of us were very comfortable with being gay yet, so we kind of just let it die away.\" Holden nodded, and then the conversation basically flat lined. They placed their orders, and then sat in relative silence before Holden spoke. \"I'm sorry.\" He said. \"Don't you apologize…you did nothing wrong.\" Sean said, sitting up and reaching over to grab his hand. \"Can we just…talk about something else?\" Holden asked. Sean nodded, \"Yeah…tell me something else that gets you excited.\" Holden thought for a minute, then spoke, \"I really like music.\" Sean raised an eyebrow, interested, \"What kind?\" \"Any kind; I just like listening to it and feeling…free. It kind of unites people, you know what I mean?\" Sean nodded, smiling. \"Who's your favorite singer?\" Holden asked. \"John Mayer; the guy's got some awesome talent.\" Sean replied, \"You?\" \"It's kind of…\" Holden began. \"Embarrassing? Yeah, so it seems like everything about you is, according to yourself.\" Sean interjected with a grin. \"Alright…I really like Mariah Carey.\" Holden said. Sean nodded, \"She's got a crazy voice. I like her.\" Holden smiled, relieved. They talked about music for a while, pretty easily until their food arrived. They ate and allowed the conversation to switch to a more detailed discussion on friends. \"I just feel so lost when I can't talk to my close friends, you know what I mean?\" Holden asked. Sean nodded, \"Yeah; I mean, sometimes I just need advice, and I know any of the guys on my team are gonna be there if I need them to be. It's a really comforting feeling.\" \"Would you rather have a few really close friends, or a bunch of not as close friends?\" Holden asked. \"I'd say a few close friends; I still talk to a few girls I went to college with. They're the only ones that know I'm gay. I talk to at least one of them every night either through text or a call. It's nice just being able to pour out my day to them, good or bad.\" \"I'm the same way; there's a girl I talk to from the office that I don't get to see much at work who just gets me. She's really pretty and works out a lot, but she doesn't waste her time on short relationships or dates that she can't see developing. There's a guy from college I still talk to; he's straight, but has been one of my biggest supporters. It's refreshing knowing that not every straight guy on the face of the earth is homophobic.\" Sean smiled, nodding. They continued on like this, the conversation easy and comfortable. They finished and Sean paid for the meal as he had last time, and then they left. \"Are you taking me home?\" Holden asked as they got into the Hummer. \"One last stop.\" Sean replied. They drove for a ways in comfortable silence, until they arrived at a fairly empty park. The night was filled with stars, and all major roads were a good distance away, which meant it would be fairly quiet. Sean got out and opened the back of the vehicle, pulling out a few blankets. Holden got out and stood, waiting. \"Are you good with sitting out here for a while?\" Sean asked. Holden nodded sincerely, \"Yeah; I haven't gotten to look at the stars in a long time. \"Good,\" Sean said with a smile, \"me either, and it's one of my favorite things to do.\" He walked ahead of Holden, who followed. The football player laid the blankets out far away from anyone else outside, and then sat down, motioning for Holden to do the same. The smaller male sat and then hesitantly leaned against Sean; they had yet to be so close for a long period. Sean didn't seem nervous at all; he pulled Holden in, arm wrapping around the other male's shoulders so that he was tucked against his side. Then, Sean pulled them back, the layers of blankets soft on their heads. Holden curled against Sean's side, feeling the rise and fall of his strong chest. The stars glimmered brightly in the sky, taking his breath away. \"I forgot how beautiful stars were.\" Holden commented. \"Yeah.\" Sean replied softly, hand running along Holden's arm. They just lay there quietly for a long while, looking up at the stars. \"Do you…think we're moving too fast?\" Sean asked, breaking the silence. Holden looked up at him, turning in his arms. \"I don't know; why?\" Sean shook his head, \"I don't know…I just feel so drawn to you, and I don't want to be overwhelming by trying to move past the awkward early dating phase.\" Holden nodded, \"Yeah, I understand…I feel different around you, Sean. I…I don't know, I feel like we've been together for years just since the time at the skating rink. I feel like I could…\" \"Could what?\" Sean asked, hand now trailing to move along the small of his back. \"Like I could be with you for the rest of my life…\" Holden whispered, \"That sounds crazy, I know…\" But Sean didn't reply; instead leaning up and capturing Holden's lips in his. Holden returned it, and they kissed under the stars for a long time, neither wanting to pull away. Sean then rolled them over so that he was on top and Holden wrapped his arms around the other male's neck. Finally, they pulled apart and Sean turned them back around so that Holden was on his chest. \"I just thought we should do it differently then we had at the skating rink.\" He explained. Holden chuckled, and they laid there in silence. \"I feel the same way, just so you know. I'm not sure I can let you go, Holden.\" Sean said. Holden curled tighter against Sean in response, and they just laid there underneath the stars. Holden felt his eyes flutter closed, and had a feeling this was the first of many times he would find himself drifting to sleep in Sean's arms. He couldn't be more content.","LastChapter":"Second Date By: KellyCRocker59 Sorry this took so long; thanks a ton to everyone who reviewed! You're words are endlessly encouraging :) This turned out longer then expected, so please tell me if there is anything wrong or that just doesn't work well. PLEASE review! I LOVE FEEDBACK! :) Holden wasn't one to get nervous over second dates. First dates, he was a mess almost without fail. But by the second date, he either knew he liked the guy and said guy liked him back, or he was barely interested and was trying to give the person one more chance. But Sean Jackson was different. Despite that fact that their first date had went amazingly well and Holden had blushed like a girl until he went to bed that night, he still just wasn't sure about the football star. He knew that Sean liked him, that wasn't the problem. He was just so afraid that he would do something to make him change his mind. All this went through his head as he drove over to Sean's home for their second date. Sean hadn't been able to go out the night after their first date but the following day he had been sure to free up. Sean had called and told him to wear jeans and a t-shirt, something Holden was less comfortable in then a suit. Plus it left him having no idea what the date would consist of, which was driving him crazy already. He found Sean's house easily; it was massive as expected and sat by the beach without any close neighbors. He walked to the door and rang the doorbell, Sean answering within seconds expectedly. The taller male was dressed in a tight grey shirt and jeans, a smile on his face. He looked like a Greek god. \"Ready for this?\" Sean asked, closing the door behind him and leaving them both very close. \"I'm not sure what 'this' is but yeah…I think so.\" Holden replied, backing up a bit to accommodate Sean's closeness. However, Sean grabbed his hand and held it, warmth spreading immediately through both Holden's hand and then his chest. Sean walked them down to where his Hummer was parked and then let go of Holden's hand so that he could get in. Then they left, driving away from the beach and into the city. The ride was fairly quiet at first, and then Sean spoke. \"So…how's life been since our last date?\" He asked. \"Good, I guess; I mean not much can happen less then 48 hours.\" Holden responded, mentally hitting himself for saying an answer that was both boring and possibly rude. Sean just smiled though, \"Man, I was hoping you were gonna say that you missed me…you're pretty much all I could think about yesterday.\" Holden blushed a deep red, and Sean turned to him; damn his face and its timing to change hues at a red light. Sean reached out and touched the side of his face, thumb running along his jaw. It took Holden's breath away. \"You're so beautiful…\" Sean whispered, and then leaned over and kissed him. It was intense, breathtaking, and everything Holden wanted it to feel like. He kissed Sean back but couldn't move as the football player cupped his cheek and kissed him intensely. However, they were forced to break apart as the car behind them began honking impatiently. Sean pulled away and turned back to the wheel slowly, still eyeing Holden. Then he started driving, and silence ensued. \"I don't usually do something that forward…I'm sorry if I kinda freaked you out.\" Sean said, breaking the tension. Holden found it difficult to speak for a moment, and then finally managed to form a sentence, \"No, it's…it's fine.\" \"I just really like you, Holden…\" Sean continued, \"and I just feel like you could take me or leave me…I'm just trying really hard…\" Holden turned to look at Sean, his hands gripping the steering wheel tightly with a look of distress on his face. \"That's kind of ironic…I was feeling the exact same way.\" Sean looked at him briefly in surprise, \"Really?\" \"Yeah…I feel like anything I could come up with of mild interest is going to pale in comparison to everything going on in your life.\" Sean chuckled, \"Being a famous football player isn't all that special, Holden. I do my thing on the field, chat with my team in the locker room, and maybe talk with the paparazzi once a week. But for the most part, I do my job – which I love – and then go home, so don't feel like I'm any better then you. I'd love to know about your job.\" Holden felt immense relief more then anything. \"Well I'm just part of real estate; there's not much to tell.\" \"Tell me about the houses you've sold; there's got to be something interesting about them. You went into real estate because you love real estate, right?\" Sean asked. \"Yeah…it's just…well, my friends tell me I get pretty obnoxious when I start going off about the houses I see.\" Holden replied, turning a bit red. \"I won't make fun of you, I promise. I just want to know what your passion is.\" Holden sighed, \"Alright…but I'm not making any promises as to how interesting it'll be.\" Sean chuckled, \"Alright.\" Then, Holden started talking about some of the houses he had seen and been in. He told Sean about how beautiful some of them were, and how ridiculous the prices were, and about the couples who he helped. He turned in his seat to face Sean as he got really excited, talking about the way the stone was so intricately placed on certain homes and how some couples hated the great landscaping in the backyard, and how the singles were so much more flexible. Sean listened to all of it. Finally, they arrived at their destination. \"Wow…I'm sorry, I got kind of hyped up about that.\" Holden said as they got out of the vehicle. \"No, I liked seeing you so into something, it was really…cute.\" Sean said with a big smile. Holden of course blushed, and they walked inside. He hadn't looked when they were outside so when they entered, he was surprised at what they saw; they were at a skating rink. \"A skating rink?\" He asked, becoming nervous. \"Yeah; I thought it would be nice doing something besides dinner and a movie.\" Sean explained, grabbing Holden's hand and walking them over to the desk where they could get their skates. Holden was getting really nervous; he was terrible at skating. What if Sean wanted to speed around the rink and all he could do was clutch the railing. Thankfully, there was no one else at the rink. That meant he could at least fall without having a little kid laugh right in his face. Sean got their skates and they sat down at a table, taking off their shoes and putting on the skates. Sean stood with ease, and stretched out a hand to Holden, who took it gratefully. Even with the other male's help he found it difficult to stand, wobbling to his feet. \"Are you okay?\" Sean asked, the shadow of a grin on his face. \"Yeah, let's just get onto the rink.\" Holden said quickly, now gripping Sean's forearm tightly as they headed in that direction. Finally, they made it to the rink (only ten feet from their table) and Sean let go of Holden. The football player rolled out into the middle of the space quickly, gliding along. Holden, however, immediately grabbed the bar on the side, watching the other male without being able to withhold the fear from his eyes. Sean skated over in his direction, stopping in front of him. \"Are you just going to cling to that bar the whole time?\" Sean joked. \"Maybe…\" Holden muttered, eyes locking on the floor. Sean, however, grabbed his arm before Holden could react, and pried him easily from the bar and pulled him just outside of arm's length from it. Holden eyed the bar in horror, and then looked up at Sean, unable to speak. \"Oh, come on, you need to at least try.\" Sean said, smiling. \"I'd rather not snap my neck, thank you.\" Holden stated indignantly. \"Well I would really rather you not either; you're way too cute to walk around with a neck brace.\" Sean said, grinning widely now. Holden got lost in the other male's expression, and then Sean let go. Before the smaller male could grapple to him, Sean skated along the floor to the middle, nearly thirty feet away. \"Come on, you can make it this far,\" Sean encouraged to a frozen, horrified Holden, \"I'll let you kiss me if you do.\" \"That's not that great of a prize.\" Holden grumbled, just loud enough for the other male to hear. Sean laughed, that full sound that made Holden's chest warm, and he was immediately attempting to scoot toward the other male's destination as the laugh reached his ears. Sean stood completely still, crossing his arms as Holden scooted inch by inch closer. Finally, after nearly ten minutes, Holden was within arm's distance of Sean, who was at that point attempting not to burst out in laughter at the sight of the other male stiffly moving each leg in front of the other. Holden reached out suddenly and grabbed Sean's arm, attempting to pull himself the rest of the way to reach the other male. However, Sean wasn't prepared for this, and lost his balance. The football player pulled Holden into his chest instinctively, wrapping his arms around him as they both toppled to the ground. This led to Sean on his back with Holden lying on his chest, their noses nearly touching. Both were left breathless, and then Sean reached up, running his fingers through Holden's hair. \"Do I still get my prize?\" Holden asked, hands clutching at Sean's shirt. Sean nodded, and Holden leaned down, pressing their lips together softly. Sean groaned into the kiss, hands moving to Holden's hips, whose hands rested on Sean's face. Finally, they pulled apart. \"Skating isn't so bad, is it?\" Sean asked. \"It still sucks.\" Holden replied with a smile. They left the skating rink after a few more moments (with absolutely no more skating on Holden's part), heading to eat at a restaurant undisclosed by Sean. On the drive over, Holden, feeling much less nervous then he had at the beginning of the date, pulled Sean's hand from the consol between their seats into his own hand, resting it on his upper thigh. Sean's eyes left the road only briefly to give the other male a bright smile, and for once Holden was able to prevent a blush from spreading across his cheeks. They reached a tiny Chinese restaurant downtown after about twenty minutes, with a steady flow of conversation about family and friends keeping the trip from seeming long at all. They got a seat fairly easily; there were only four other couples in the restaurant, all older. \"This place is amazing; it's the most authentic Chinese restaurant I've ever been to,\" Sean said as they sat, \"I hope you like it.\" \"I'm sure I will.\" Holden replied with a smile. They both ordered water when the waiter appeared, and then the conversation picked up again. \"So, you haven't really told me much about your past.\" Sean began. \"What do you mean?\" Holden asked as the waters arrived. \"You know…like past relationships, college, stuff like that.\" Sean replied. \"Oh…\" Holden said, sipping at his water, \"it's kind of embarrassing.\" \"That's what you said about your job.\" Sean countered. Holden sighed, \"Alright…what do you want to know?\" Sean shrugged, \"I don't know; how was your last relationship?\" \"It was in college,\" Holden began, \"and he was this kind of buff, rugby player.\" Sean nodded, acknowledging that he was listening. \"It lasted about three years, and then…some bad things happened.\" Holden said, eyes trailing to the tablecloth. \"What do you mean?\" Sean asked, curiosity in his tone. \"He just wasn't who I thought he was.\" Holden said. \"Holden, you can tell me…\" Sean urged, concern now lacing his tone. Holden looked up into Sean's eyes and melted. Something about the other male made him want to pour out his heart. \"Well…it was our last year and he was kind of tight on money. This friend of his, he was kind of curious, and he wanted to…try stuff out with another guy. Well, Jake, my ex, talked to me about it and I didn't want to. But his friend really liked me, so he offered Jake some money for me. Jake took it, and then one night when he was over at my dorm, he slipped some roofies into my drink when I was in the bathroom. His friend came over, he left, and…his friend had sex with me.\" Holden's eyes were on the tablecloth again, unable to look into Sean's eyes as he retold the story. Hardly anyone knew. \"He…he raped you?\" Sean asked, his tone tightly restrained. Holden nodded, taking another drink of his water. Then, he looked up. Sean was gripping his napkin so tight his knuckles were red, his eyes locked on Holden. \"Sean, are you…okay?\" Holden asked. \"Was he taken to court?\" Sean asked. \"No…I didn't want anyone to know about it. My parents didn't know I was gay yet and I just…I was ashamed.\" Holden said. \"People should not get away with shit like that!\" Sean exploded, causing several people to look their way. \"Are you okay?\" He asked in a more hushed tone. \"Yeah…yeah, I'm fine now, I hardly think about it anymore.\" Sean relaxed a bit, but was still tense. \"I would never let anyone do that to you.\" He stated matter-of-factly. \"Thanks.\" Holden said with a small smile. \"I mean it…if I see anyone lay a hand on you when you don't want them to, I'll break their wrists.\" Sean said. \"Sean, I'm fine…just tell me about your last relationship.\" Holden replied, trying to change the topic. Sean sighed, sitting back in the chair. \"There was this one guy when I was starting off, right after college. We were kind of together; I mean we messed around and stuff for a while, but neither one of us were very comfortable with being gay yet, so we kind of just let it die away.\" Holden nodded, and then the conversation basically flat lined. They placed their orders, and then sat in relative silence before Holden spoke. \"I'm sorry.\" He said. \"Don't you apologize…you did nothing wrong.\" Sean said, sitting up and reaching over to grab his hand. \"Can we just…talk about something else?\" Holden asked. Sean nodded, \"Yeah…tell me something else that gets you excited.\" Holden thought for a minute, then spoke, \"I really like music.\" Sean raised an eyebrow, interested, \"What kind?\" \"Any kind; I just like listening to it and feeling…free. It kind of unites people, you know what I mean?\" Sean nodded, smiling. \"Who's your favorite singer?\" Holden asked. \"John Mayer; the guy's got some awesome talent.\" Sean replied, \"You?\" \"It's kind of…\" Holden began. \"Embarrassing? Yeah, so it seems like everything about you is, according to yourself.\" Sean interjected with a grin. \"Alright…I really like Mariah Carey.\" Holden said. Sean nodded, \"She's got a crazy voice. I like her.\" Holden smiled, relieved. They talked about music for a while, pretty easily until their food arrived. They ate and allowed the conversation to switch to a more detailed discussion on friends. \"I just feel so lost when I can't talk to my close friends, you know what I mean?\" Holden asked. Sean nodded, \"Yeah; I mean, sometimes I just need advice, and I know any of the guys on my team are gonna be there if I need them to be. It's a really comforting feeling.\" \"Would you rather have a few really close friends, or a bunch of not as close friends?\" Holden asked. \"I'd say a few close friends; I still talk to a few girls I went to college with.

I'm sorry it has been so long; I hope this is good! Enjoy and please please PLEASE boost my motivation by REVIEWING! I see all you out there favoriting but not reviewing; PLEASE do both. It helps me immensely! \"They're going to love you, so stop worrying.\" Sean's hand finding his, holding it in his lap, calmed Holden's nerves slightly. But his eyes were still just a bit unfocused and his ears were still just a bit red. These weren't just any parents, these were Sean's parents. Sean, the man he had been with for three years. The man he planned on spending his life with. The man who had come out of the closet for him on national television. The man whose parents had found out that their son was gay the same way all of America had. \"I've never met a boyfriend's parents before.\" Holden muttered, gripping Sean's hand tightly in his, fingertips running along rough calluses nervously. \"Well neither have I. But my parents really want to meet you, Holden. And as long as you're yourself, they'll love you.\" \"I thought you said they were really conservative, were always pestering you about bringing a nice girl home?\" Holden asked, turning to study the other man's face. \"Yeah, they did. But then, after I came out, my mom called me one day when you were away for business and we had a really good talk. She can't wait to meet my sexy, smart, sophisticated boyfriend.\" Sean said, not taking his eyes off the road but smiling brightly. Holden blushed, \"I hope I don't let her down.\" \"Trust me, you won't. I'm sure I didn't do you enough justice.\" Sean turned onto a road that led even deeper into the countryside. Holden had never been in a rural area for a prolonged period of time, and their current surrounding would have fascinated him, had his head not been full of the various terrible scenarios that he was sure would play out over their dinner. Finally, they reached a nice homely house, not too large, but two stories and proof that Sean's parents were of the upper middle class. Sean parked the Hummer in front of the house, cut the engine, and they both sat there. Sean turned to Holden, attempting to gain a smile but granting one of his own. \"I love you.\" He said, and Holden smiled, turning toward the football player. \"I love you too. I just hope your parents feel the same way.\" \"Yeah, well I'm not too excited to meet yours either.\" \"My parents practically already know you, Sean. My dad is obsessed with football. You could show up to their house in a trashcan and they would think Jesus was walking the earth again.\" Sean laughed a full, deep sound that filled Holden's ears. Then he opened his door. Holden tightened his grip on Sean's hand and he turned back to look at his horrified boyfriend, still frozen in his seat. \"Come on, Holden, we have to go inside.\" \"Maybe just a few more minutes?\" Holden proposed. Sean chuckled and pulled their hands apart, closing his door and walking around the vehicle to Holden's side, pulling the door open. Holden sighed, and when Sean offered his hand, he took it, weaving their fingers together. \"You're going to be great.\" Sean said, and Holden nodded, as though it would help to cement the words into his mind. They walked up the stairs and Sean knocked on the door. It opened almost immediately to reveal an older woman with brunette hair that fell to her shoulders, tan complexion accented by the simple white dress she wore. \"Sean! We were worried that you two would never make it.\" She gave them only a brief period to enter the house before she threw her arms around her son, hugging him tight. Sean returned the embrace, hand unlocking from Holden's. She then turned to Holden, granting him a bright smile that was saturated with sincerity. \"Mom, this is Holden…\" Sean began. \"You are just too adorable!\" She cried, pulling him into her arms. Holden hugged her back and felt a sweeping relief overwhelm him. His own mother rarely embraced him like this. She pulled back but kept her hands on his forearms, looking at him. \"Sean did not do you justice! You look like a guy off of one of those GQ magazines I read at the dentist's office!\" \"Thank you; you look very lovely, ma'am.\" Holden replied, controlling his blush and instead attempting a smile. \"No, no; you call me Mom. You're part of this family, regardless of what the government says!\" She replied, patting his arm. Then, a man who looked about the same age as Sean's mom walked in from the hallway. He was a foreboding figure, standing the same height as Sean but bulkier. His similarly tan complexion went well with his dark hair, and he wore a neutral expression on his face. \"Hey, Dad; this is Holden.\" The man walked over, looking Holden up and down. \"Ever since that day, I wondered what kind of guy Sean was going to bring home. Thank God you don't dress like a girl.\" Then, just as Holden was deciphering the comment, he was pulled into a tight embrace, Sean's dad patting him firmly on the back. Holden returned it, and the hug was over quickly. \"It looks like my son has good taste.\" He said with a smile. \"Thank you, sir.\" \"That's Dad to you.\" He replied, grinning widely the way Sean did. Holden immediately felt as though he belonged here, with this family. \"Well, dinner is ready; let's eat!\" Sean's mom said, walking into the dining room. The three men followed, and when Holden went to help carry dishes in from the kitchen, Sean's dad turned to him. \"I don't think so, Son. You're our guest; have a seat.\" Holden nodded, taking a seat as Sean brought in the first dish, giving Holden a big smile. Holden wasn't sure Sean even expected things to go this well. After two trips per Jackson family member, the table was set and everyone was sitting, Mr. and Mrs. Jackson across from one another and Holden and Sean similarly seated. However, before anyone began to get food, Mr. and Mrs. Jackson reached for the other two's hands. Holden complied, and followed their lead, bowing his head. \"Dear God,\" Mrs. Jackson began, \"thank you for this food, thank you for blessing us with an amazing son, and thank you for bringing such an amazing man into his life. May you give them love, joy and peace for all their lives. Amen.\" \"Amen.\" They all repeated, and then it the prayer was finished. While Holden was a religious man, he wasn't sure how Sean's parents would be. However, he was deeply relieved that they shared a similar belief as him toward homosexuality and God. They all got food from the various dishes, Mrs. Jackson having prepared turkey, mashed potatoes, vegetables, jell-o salad and rolls. \"So, Holden, what do you do for a living?\" Mr. Jackson asked. \"I'm work with real estate across the country.\" Holden replied. \"Selling property?\" \"Yeah; I really enjoy helping people find homes that are perfect for them, you know?\" Sean's dad nodded. \"It's nice to see that you aren't just living off of Sean's money.\" Holden shook his head. \"I'm not sure I could do that. I mean, that would be an uneven relationship.\" Mr. Jackson nodded, and Holden believed he had the other man's approval. \"Do you go to Sean's games, Holden?\" Mrs. Jackson asked. \"Yeah, when I can. I mean, I just recently started going since he made everything public. The other football player's wives were all very welcoming.\" \"Well that's nice to hear. You never really know how other people will react to that sort of thing. People can be so set in an uneducated view that they don't think to consider anything else.\" Holden nodded, \"Yeah, I was kind of nervous, but I was pleasantly surprised.\" \"You haven't slept with any of them have you?\" Mr. Jackson asked suddenly. \"Dad!\" Sean exclaimed, choking a bit on his food. \"No, I haven't.\" Holden replied, chuckling. \"Sorry, you both just seem so…straight to me.\" Mr. Jackson replied. \"Eric…\" Mrs. Jackson trailed off in warning. \"No, it's fine. I…I know a lot of people think that. I've told people and they've been like 'what, no you're not, you act like a guy.' It's just what the media has skewed gay lifestyle as being for so long, and the most vocal gay individuals are the ones that fit every stereotype. There are a lot of people out there that think gay men have to like pop music and fashion and wearing women's clothing.\" \"And that's why our son is making history.\" Mr. Jackson added, smiling at his son. Sean turned a bit red at his father's pride, and continued eating. \"We would love to come to a game sometime and sit with you, Holden.\" Mrs. Jackson said. \"Yeah, that would be nice. I have to warn you though, I get a little…\" \"He gets really intense.\" Sean finished, looking up to smile at Holden. \"Really? I can't picture that.\" Mrs. Jackson replied. \"Well, I don't exactly know anything about football, but whenever Sean gets tackled or gets called out or anything like that…\" \"The other players have told me that the wives have to hold him down sometimes from running down to talk to the referee.\" Sean said. \"Yeah, I'm really…competitive.\" Holden said, looking down at his plate. \"Oh, really? Then we simply have to play Catch Phrase after dinner.\" Mrs. Jackson said excitedly. \"Catch Phrase?\" Holden asked. \"It's kind of a family tradition. You'll get the hang of it fast.\" Sean explained. \"But don't expect to win, Son. Christina and I have never lost a game of Catch Phrase.\" Mr. Jackson said. \"Oh, well then I guess you may need to take a breather after our match, because you've never played a game against me.\" Holden replied, smiling. \"I'll take that challenge.\" He replied. They finished eating and cleaned everything up (with the exception of Holden, who was forced to wait in the living room). Then, Sean's mom retrieved Catch Phrase from a cabinet, and they all took seats in the living room. The small device was to be passed around between the four of them, and Holden got used to it quickly, shouting hints as to what word Sean was supposed to guess hoarsely within five minutes of starting the game. After seven rounds of the game, Sean and Holden were forced to call it quits, realizing that with a score of 5 to 2, they weren't going to win. After a bit of friendly gloating from Mr. Jackson, Mrs. Jackson headed into the kitchen, grabbing a cake that was being warmed in the oven and slicing it. They all stood to get a piece; it was chocolate, which happened to be everyone's favorite. Mr. and Mrs. Jackson took a seat beside one another on the couch, bodies lingering close to one another. Sean sat down on the love seat, and when Holden went to sit a normal distance from him on the piece of furniture, Sean reached out and pulled the smaller man toward him, shoulders touching as they ate. \"So you two are spending the night, right?\" Mrs. Jackson asked. \"Well, we weren't planning to…\" Sean began. \"But you must! I got out fresh sheets and everything for your bed. It's too long of a drive back to your house.\" She replied. \"Thank you so much…Mom. We don't have anything important to do tomorrow anyway.\" Holden replied, smiling. She returned the smile brightly, and stood, grabbing everyone's empty plates and putting them in the dishwasher before returning to her seat. Mr. Jackson turned on the television to the nightly news before putting an arm around his wife, the woman leaning against him. Sean pulled Holden closer now, back pressed to chest. Holden leaned against him, the familiar position immediately soothing as the food settled in his stomach. He leaned his head against Sean's shoulder, and Sean's fingers ran gently along his arm. After about an hour, it was getting late. Mrs. Jackson stood before speaking. \"Well, I don't know about you boys, but I'm exhausted. I think it's time for bed.\" Holden nodded and stood, Sean immediately following him with his hand against the small of the other man's back. Mr. Jackson stood as his wife took turns hugging both boys. \"We will see you both in the morning.\" She said, and Mr. Jackson nodded before they allowed the two men to walk back toward the stairs in the hallway. \"It was nice meeting you, Holden.\" Mr. Jackson called. Holden turned, smiling at the older man. \"It was great meeting you too, Dad.\" \"So, I'm hoping you had a good time?\" Sean asked, wrapping a towel around his waist as he walked into his old bedroom. \"Yeah, you're parents….Sean, you're parents are amazing.\" Holden replied, climbing into the queen size bed, under the sheets in his boxers. \"I know…I don't know why I had any doubts about telling them who I was.\" \"It's a hard thing to do; I'm sure they don't blame you for waiting so long. Now come on, I'm cold under here without you.\" Sean chuckled, pulling his boxers on quickly, towel forgotten on the ground, before he climbed into bed. He settled against the seats, pulling Holden forward so that they were chest to chest. Then he leaned in, kissing the other male softly on the lips. It wasn't the most extravagant or lingering kiss, but it was perfect, Holden pressing his lips in response against Sean's before they parted, foreheads pressed together. It was what they did every night in bed, like a final 'I love you' before either or them fell asleep. \"I'm so glad this went well.\" Sean said as Holden curled against him, head nestling into the football player's chest. \"You have no idea.\" Holden replied, and the soft rumble of Sean's chuckling in his chest was the last thing Holden remembered before drifting to sleep. The following morning, Sean and Holden ate breakfast and then prepared to leave. They stood in the entryway, Mr. and Mrs. Jackson exchanging goodbyes between them. She pulled Holden into a powerful hug, and he felt her sniffling. \"I…I never thought anyone would come into Sean's life. I'm…I'm just so thankful that my son can be happy.\" She said softly in his ear, tears wetting his shoulder. \"Oh, don't cry. I'm as lucky as he is.\" Holden replied as she pulled away, touching her arm gently with a smile. Then, he turned to Sean's dad as Sean said goodbye to his mom. \"You know, I never thought anyone would be good enough for my son. I thought he was this perfect guy, the only one out there, and I had my mind made up that I'd have to be satisfied with whoever he brought home, because he's my son. But you, Son…you're the only exception.\" Holden smiled larger then he was trying to and hugged the older man firmly, more lingering then their original embrace. Then, he pulled back and after a few more muttered goodbyes and see you soons, Sean and Holden were seated in the Hummer. However, before Sean started the engine, he turned to Holden with a big grin on his face, the one he got from his dad. \"What?\" Holden asked. \"I just love you so much.\" Sean replied, and Holden knew he was holding back tears. Holden leaned across the space between them, and kissed him powerfully, hands holding the football player's face. He pulled back and smiled. \"I just love you so much too.\" He replied.","LastChapter":"The Only Exception By: KellyCRocker59 Man, I have missed these two. I'm sorry it has been so long; I hope this is good! Enjoy and please please PLEASE boost my motivation by REVIEWING! I see all you out there favoriting but not reviewing; PLEASE do both. It helps me immensely! \"They're going to love you, so stop worrying.\" Sean's hand finding his, holding it in his lap, calmed Holden's nerves slightly. But his eyes were still just a bit unfocused and his ears were still just a bit red. These weren't just any parents, these were Sean's parents. Sean, the man he had been with for three years. The man he planned on spending his life with. The man who had come out of the closet for him on national television. The man whose parents had found out that their son was gay the same way all of America had. \"I've never met a boyfriend's parents before.\" Holden muttered, gripping Sean's hand tightly in his, fingertips running along rough calluses nervously. \"Well neither have I. But my parents really want to meet you, Holden. And as long as you're yourself, they'll love you.\" \"I thought you said they were really conservative, were always pestering you about bringing a nice girl home?\" Holden asked, turning to study the other man's face. \"Yeah, they did. But then, after I came out, my mom called me one day when you were away for business and we had a really good talk. She can't wait to meet my sexy, smart, sophisticated boyfriend.\" Sean said, not taking his eyes off the road but smiling brightly. Holden blushed, \"I hope I don't let her down.\" \"Trust me, you won't. I'm sure I didn't do you enough justice.\" Sean turned onto a road that led even deeper into the countryside. Holden had never been in a rural area for a prolonged period of time, and their current surrounding would have fascinated him, had his head not been full of the various terrible scenarios that he was sure would play out over their dinner. Finally, they reached a nice homely house, not too large, but two stories and proof that Sean's parents were of the upper middle class. Sean parked the Hummer in front of the house, cut the engine, and they both sat there. Sean turned to Holden, attempting to gain a smile but granting one of his own. \"I love you.\" He said, and Holden smiled, turning toward the football player. \"I love you too. I just hope your parents feel the same way.\" \"Yeah, well I'm not too excited to meet yours either.\" \"My parents practically already know you, Sean. My dad is obsessed with football. You could show up to their house in a trashcan and they would think Jesus was walking the earth again.\" Sean laughed a full, deep sound that filled Holden's ears. Then he opened his door. Holden tightened his grip on Sean's hand and he turned back to look at his horrified boyfriend, still frozen in his seat. \"Come on, Holden, we have to go inside.\" \"Maybe just a few more minutes?\" Holden proposed. Sean chuckled and pulled their hands apart, closing his door and walking around the vehicle to Holden's side, pulling the door open. Holden sighed, and when Sean offered his hand, he took it, weaving their fingers together. \"You're going to be great.\" Sean said, and Holden nodded, as though it would help to cement the words into his mind. They walked up the stairs and Sean knocked on the door. It opened almost immediately to reveal an older woman with brunette hair that fell to her shoulders, tan complexion accented by the simple white dress she wore. \"Sean! We were worried that you two would never make it.\" She gave them only a brief period to enter the house before she threw her arms around her son, hugging him tight. Sean returned the embrace, hand unlocking from Holden's. She then turned to Holden, granting him a bright smile that was saturated with sincerity. \"Mom, this is Holden…\" Sean began. \"You are just too adorable!\" She cried, pulling him into her arms. Holden hugged her back and felt a sweeping relief overwhelm him. His own mother rarely embraced him like this. She pulled back but kept her hands on his forearms, looking at him. \"Sean did not do you justice! You look like a guy off of one of those GQ magazines I read at the dentist's office!\" \"Thank you; you look very lovely, ma'am.\" Holden replied, controlling his blush and instead attempting a smile. \"No, no; you call me Mom. You're part of this family, regardless of what the government says!\" She replied, patting his arm. Then, a man who looked about the same age as Sean's mom walked in from the hallway. He was a foreboding figure, standing the same height as Sean but bulkier. His similarly tan complexion went well with his dark hair, and he wore a neutral expression on his face. \"Hey, Dad; this is Holden.\" The man walked over, looking Holden up and down. \"Ever since that day, I wondered what kind of guy Sean was going to bring home. Thank God you don't dress like a girl.\" Then, just as Holden was deciphering the comment, he was pulled into a tight embrace, Sean's dad patting him firmly on the back. Holden returned it, and the hug was over quickly. \"It looks like my son has good taste.\" He said with a smile. \"Thank you, sir.\" \"That's Dad to you.\" He replied, grinning widely the way Sean did. Holden immediately felt as though he belonged here, with this family. \"Well, dinner is ready; let's eat!\" Sean's mom said, walking into the dining room. The three men followed, and when Holden went to help carry dishes in from the kitchen, Sean's dad turned to him. \"I don't think so, Son. You're our guest; have a seat.\" Holden nodded, taking a seat as Sean brought in the first dish, giving Holden a big smile. Holden wasn't sure Sean even expected things to go this well. After two trips per Jackson family member, the table was set and everyone was sitting, Mr. and Mrs. Jackson across from one another and Holden and Sean similarly seated. However, before anyone began to get food, Mr. and Mrs. Jackson reached for the other two's hands. Holden complied, and followed their lead, bowing his head. \"Dear God,\" Mrs. Jackson began, \"thank you for this food, thank you for blessing us with an amazing son, and thank you for bringing such an amazing man into his life. May you give them love, joy and peace for all their lives. Amen.\" \"Amen.\" They all repeated, and then it the prayer was finished. While Holden was a religious man, he wasn't sure how Sean's parents would be. However, he was deeply relieved that they shared a similar belief as him toward homosexuality and God. They all got food from the various dishes, Mrs. Jackson having prepared turkey, mashed potatoes, vegetables, jell-o salad and rolls. \"So, Holden, what do you do for a living?\" Mr. Jackson asked. \"I'm work with real estate across the country.\" Holden replied. \"Selling property?\" \"Yeah; I really enjoy helping people find homes that are perfect for them, you know?\" Sean's dad nodded. \"It's nice to see that you aren't just living off of Sean's money.\" Holden shook his head. \"I'm not sure I could do that. I mean, that would be an uneven relationship.\" Mr. Jackson nodded, and Holden believed he had the other man's approval. \"Do you go to Sean's games, Holden?\" Mrs. Jackson asked. \"Yeah, when I can. I mean, I just recently started going since he made everything public. The other football player's wives were all very welcoming.\" \"Well that's nice to hear. You never really know how other people will react to that sort of thing. People can be so set in an uneducated view that they don't think to consider anything else.\" Holden nodded, \"Yeah, I was kind of nervous, but I was pleasantly surprised.\" \"You haven't slept with any of them have you?\" Mr. Jackson asked suddenly. \"Dad!\" Sean exclaimed, choking a bit on his food. \"No, I haven't.\" Holden replied, chuckling. \"Sorry, you both just seem so…straight to me.\" Mr. Jackson replied. \"Eric…\" Mrs. Jackson trailed off in warning. \"No, it's fine. I…I know a lot of people think that. I've told people and they've been like 'what, no you're not, you act like a guy.' It's just what the media has skewed gay lifestyle as being for so long, and the most vocal gay individuals are the ones that fit every stereotype. There are a lot of people out there that think gay men have to like pop music and fashion and wearing women's clothing.\" \"And that's why our son is making history.\" Mr. Jackson added, smiling at his son. Sean turned a bit red at his father's pride, and continued eating. \"We would love to come to a game sometime and sit with you, Holden.\" Mrs. Jackson said. \"Yeah, that would be nice. I have to warn you though, I get a little…\" \"He gets really intense.\" Sean finished, looking up to smile at Holden. \"Really? I can't picture that.\" Mrs. Jackson replied. \"Well, I don't exactly know anything about football, but whenever Sean gets tackled or gets called out or anything like that…\" \"The other players have told me that the wives have to hold him down sometimes from running down to talk to the referee.\" Sean said. \"Yeah, I'm really…competitive.\" Holden said, looking down at his plate. \"Oh, really?

He'd needed Holden, needed him to understand how much Sean loved him. notes. I have had Valentine's Day on repeat for several days - this bloomed out of that. . one . Holden had been waiting in line at the taxi counter, listening to a small boy scream and fling himself against the floor, when the television behind the counter had caught his eye. He and Sean hadn't seen or spoke to each other in several weeks; Holden had headed to his parents' vacation residence in France after their breakup, choosing to lay low in the countryside rather than have to deal with seeing Sean on every television in the tri-state area. He was unsurprised, at first, to see that his assumption had been right – the media had always had a significant interest in Sean – then the program changed to a press conference. It didn't take more than a minute for him to recognize Kara, blackberry in hand as usual, and then to zero in on Sean. He looked tired, a little bit less enthusiastic than was typical; Holden forced himself to look away, moving up in the line and out of the sight of the television. Moving, however, had put him within a strained earshot and his throat caught as he heard Sean's words. Holden mumbled an apology to the gentleman he pushed out of his way, eyes locked on the screen even as another worker told him to remain in line. He heard nothing, all of his attention on the words now scrolling across the screen over a freeze-framed screengrab of Sean and Kara at the podium, the talking head on ESPN asking questions of the team manager. \"Sir?\" Holden looked over at the annoyed woman, glanced at the other customers in the line now staring at him. Chuckling nervously, he gave her a somewhat deprecating half-smile, saying, \"Sorry,\" and returned to his place behind the stanchions. . two . There was a florist shop on the way that he paid the taxi driver extra to stop at, grateful that it was still open. He didn't need an arrangement or a bouquet or any of that drivel, just a couple of whatever flowers were sitting around, but the girl at the desk argued with him when he said as much. \"There a problem, Nikki?\" Reed asked as he came through the door to the storeroom, then looked to the customer and laughed. \"Oh, man, you look like hell .\" \"Where as you look like sunshine yourself,\" Holden shot back. \"Listen, I only need like a stem of something yellow. That's it. I'll pay you whatever you want for it.\" Reed eyed his cousin. \"This about Sean?\" he asked, crossing his arms. Holden sighed and nodded, replying, \"Yeah,\" and knowing he would get an earful about it – Reed had been ready to go after Sean when he'd heard of the breakup and had been quite vocal in his dislike ever since. \"You know I'm gonna punch him in the nuts the next time I see him, right?\" \"I know,\" Holden said with a laugh. He expected no less from Reed, a late-twenties florist with no upper body strength to speak of, than to try to take down Sean, a thirty-five year old quarterback who could snap Reed like a twig. Reed nodded, satisfied Holden understood and disappeared into the back room; when he returned a moment later it was with a decent sized stem of yellow flowers, soft and only just starting to wilt. He didn't reach for the paper or the cellophane, instead handing it over to Holden, saying, \"Go save your boyfriend from himself.\" \"Thanks... I owe you one.\" Holden raced back to the taxi, clutching the flower in his hand as the sedan took off and he headed for home. . three . It was so late that Holden knew Sean would be asleep, though he hadn't expected to find the man passed out in a chair in the living room – one of the chairs he'd always complained were uncomfortable, but he'd bought because Holden had liked and wanted the – and he debated waking Sean for all of a second. Then Holden grinned gently and ran the petals of the flowers over Sean's cheek. Sean started, rubbing his face over the ghostly sensation, and opened his eyes; he kept his gaze on Holden as he shifted in the chair as Holden's hand threaded through his hair, and said, \"You saw.\" \"Yeah.\" Sean relaxed finally and the tension he'd carried for weeks eased. He'd been under so much pressure for so long... he'd needed Holden, needed him to understand how much Sean loved him, and Sean had managed to get the message to him. \"You look tired,\" Holden remarked. His mouth was so close, Sean could feel Holden's breath on his lips. He'd missed that mouth, missed the feel of Holden under him and around him, and missed the scent of him. Sean had slept in their bed most nights (he wasn't some simpering codependent reject), but once the sheets had been changed and Holden's smell had gone, Sean hadn't slept as well. So there was no soul on earth who could have blamed him for leaning in, pulling Holden close, kissing him, happy beyond words that Holden was there. \"Sean,\" Holden whispered when they parted, \"Come to bed.\" Sean didn't need to be told twice and he followed Holden to their bed in silence, unable to stop touching as they went – fingers brushed over shoulders, flanks, hands. Sean very nearly tripped them both as they ascended the stairs; he caught Holden as the man fell backward and flipped them, pressing Holden's back into the stairwell wall. \"Where'd you go?\" Sean asked, pushing his chest into Holden's and placing kisses to his neck. One hand lifted from its place on Holden's hip to rest on his neck; Sean was worrying Holden's throat so perfectly that Holden knew there there would be a mark there later. \"France.\" Holden tilted his head, giving Sean more skin to nip at. \"My parents' vacation house in Bordeaux... couple of days in Paris.\" For a moment, hurt bloomed in Sean's chest as he thought of the promise Holden had made him months ago – to not go off to Bordeaux without Sean the next time he decided to go – and realized how much they'd hurt each other those last few months. Holden never broke his promises, not unless he figured they wouldn't be missed. Sean sighed and traced Holden's lips. \"Got a lot of things to make up for, huh?\" Holden nodded, replying, \"We both do, but we'll figure it out.\" . four . Sean woke first, unsurprised to find Holden's face buried in the pillow, sheet pulled low over Holden's hips: it was the perfect tableau of skin. He grinned, moving until he was on hands and knees over Holden. Sean knew Holden wouldn't appreciate being woken after a fourteen hour flight, that he'd grouse about jetlag and hunger, but Sean needed this. Slowly, he settled himself onto Holden's back, cock in the cleft of Holden's ass, and nipped at the nape of his boyfriend's neck. \"Mmm, mornin',\" Holden mumbled as he came awake minutes later and jumped when Sean licked at just the right spot behind Holden's ear. \"God, Sean...\" \"Please,\" Sean whispered, grinding his hips into Holden. Holden smiled over his shoulder, and nodded, stretching out until he was comfortable with his legs wide; Holden stuffed a pillow under his hips before crossing his arms under his head and wiggling against Sean. \"Come on,\" he prodded when Sean didn't move, \"Baby, you awake?\" That got Sean's attention. \"Admiring the view,\" he growled, pushing Holden's knees farther apart with his own and reaching for the lube they'd dropped over the side of the bed the night before. Holden was still pretty slick, but Sean still took his time, sliding two fingers into Holden and teasing him with them; Sean always had loved the noises Holden made when he was riled, the grunts and the groans and how Holden would inevitably start to push back. How he'd grumble for more and clutch at the blankets. Two fingers turned to three and Sean pulled his hand free when Holden told him, \"Fuck me, Sean,\" and knelt up. Which was when it hit him: he might never of had this , could have lost it by being a fucking moron. He knew now that he hadn't needed to go so far as to come up on national TV just to get Holden back, but Sean didn't regret it and it had gotten Holden to come home. He sucked in a breath, pushing those thoughts away and turning his attention back to Holden who was looking back at him with questions in his eyes. Sean gave him the best half-smirk he could, grasped his cock and snubbed the head against Holden's ass; it was gentle, somewhat unlike Sean, but Holden didn't have time to think about what that meant. Sean thrust forward, one perfect slide into Holden that left him shaking as he held onto Holden's flanks. The urge to come was only just overridden by the need to hear all the noises Holden could make, feel how Holden writhed and moved under him, and he started to thrust. \" Fuck , Sean,\" Holden ground out, fingers tangling into the pillowcase. He lifted his hips when Sean tugged him up, and grunted into the next thrust; he was already close, Holden's dreams having been a mix of the night before and the things he'd read in some of the books during his impromptu vacation, and it wasn't going to take long. Then Sean pulled out and shoved at Holden until the man was on his back, and thrust in again. It earned Sean a loud moan, half-lidded eyes locked on his, and Holden wrapped his legs around Sean's back, glad for the change in position when Sean leaned in for a kiss. The headboard banged against the wall with the next thrust, which made Holden laugh; he sat up, using one hand on Sean's neck for leverage as he moved, and kissed Sean again, tongue sliding into Sean's mouth, and with a tug on his cock, Holden came. Loose-limbed, Holden let Sean settle him onto the sheets again, and let out a particularly embarrassing moan when Sean thrust into him. \"Come, baby,\" Holden told him, one hand over Sean's heart, \"Come.\" Sean did, slumping forward in the aftermath; he buried his face in Holden's neck, panting, and told Holden, \"Love you.\" \"Love you too.\" \"Don't...don't expect me to say that often.\" Holden laughed. \"No problem.\" \" Love is just a word until someone comes along and gives it meaning. \" - Anon -","LastChapter":"disclaimer.

He heard nothing, all of his attention on the words now scrolling across the screen over a freeze-framed screengrab of Sean and Kara at the podium, the talking head on ESPN asking questions of the team manager. \"Sir?\" Holden looked over at the annoyed woman, glanced at the other customers in the line now staring at him. Chuckling nervously, he gave her a somewhat deprecating half-smile, saying, \"Sorry,\" and returned to his place behind the stanchions. . two . There was a florist shop on the way that he paid the taxi driver extra to stop at, grateful that it was still open. He didn't need an arrangement or a bouquet or any of that drivel, just a couple of whatever flowers were sitting around, but the girl at the desk argued with him when he said as much. \"There a problem, Nikki?\" Reed asked as he came through the door to the storeroom, then looked to the customer and laughed. \"Oh, man, you look like hell .\" \"Where as you look like sunshine yourself,\" Holden shot back. \"Listen, I only need like a stem of something yellow. That's it. I'll pay you whatever you want for it.\" Reed eyed his cousin. \"This about Sean?\" he asked, crossing his arms. Holden sighed and nodded, replying, \"Yeah,\" and knowing he would get an earful about it – Reed had been ready to go after Sean when he'd heard of the breakup and had been quite vocal in his dislike ever since. \"You know I'm gonna punch him in the nuts the next time I see him, right?\" \"I know,\" Holden said with a laugh. He expected no less from Reed, a late-twenties florist with no upper body strength to speak of, than to try to take down Sean, a thirty-five year old quarterback who could snap Reed like a twig. Reed nodded, satisfied Holden understood and disappeared into the back room; when he returned a moment later it was with a decent sized stem of yellow flowers, soft and only just starting to wilt. He didn't reach for the paper or the cellophane, instead handing it over to Holden, saying, \"Go save your boyfriend from himself.\" \"Thanks... I owe you one.\" Holden raced back to the taxi, clutching the flower in his hand as the sedan took off and he headed for home. . three . It was so late that Holden knew Sean would be asleep, though he hadn't expected to find the man passed out in a chair in the living room – one of the chairs he'd always complained were uncomfortable, but he'd bought because Holden had liked and wanted the – and he debated waking Sean for all of a second. Then Holden grinned gently and ran the petals of the flowers over Sean's cheek. Sean started, rubbing his face over the ghostly sensation, and opened his eyes; he kept his gaze on Holden as he shifted in the chair as Holden's hand threaded through his hair, and said, \"You saw.\" \"Yeah.\" Sean relaxed finally and the tension he'd carried for weeks eased. He'd been under so much pressure for so long... he'd needed Holden, needed him to understand how much Sean loved him, and Sean had managed to get the message to him. \"You look tired,\" Holden remarked. His mouth was so close, Sean could feel Holden's breath on his lips. He'd missed that mouth, missed the feel of Holden under him and around him, and missed the scent of him. Sean had slept in their bed most nights (he wasn't some simpering codependent reject), but once the sheets had been changed and Holden's smell had gone, Sean hadn't slept as well. So there was no soul on earth who could have blamed him for leaning in, pulling Holden close, kissing him, happy beyond words that Holden was there. \"Sean,\" Holden whispered when they parted, \"Come to bed.\" Sean didn't need to be told twice and he followed Holden to their bed in silence, unable to stop touching as they went – fingers brushed over shoulders, flanks, hands. Sean very nearly tripped them both as they ascended the stairs; he caught Holden as the man fell backward and flipped them, pressing Holden's back into the stairwell wall. \"Where'd you go?\" Sean asked, pushing his chest into Holden's and placing kisses to his neck. One hand lifted from its place on Holden's hip to rest on his neck; Sean was worrying Holden's throat so perfectly that Holden knew there there would be a mark there later. \"France.\" Holden tilted his head, giving Sean more skin to nip at. \"My parents' vacation house in Bordeaux... couple of days in Paris.\" For a moment, hurt bloomed in Sean's chest as he thought of the promise Holden had made him months ago – to not go off to Bordeaux without Sean the next time he decided to go – and realized how much they'd hurt each other those last few months. Holden never broke his promises, not unless he figured they wouldn't be missed. Sean sighed and traced Holden's lips. \"Got a lot of things to make up for, huh?\" Holden nodded, replying, \"We both do, but we'll figure it out.\" . four . Sean woke first, unsurprised to find Holden's face buried in the pillow, sheet pulled low over Holden's hips: it was the perfect tableau of skin. He grinned, moving until he was on hands and knees over Holden. Sean knew Holden wouldn't appreciate being woken after a fourteen hour flight, that he'd grouse about jetlag and hunger, but Sean needed this. Slowly, he settled himself onto Holden's back, cock in the cleft of Holden's ass, and nipped at the nape of his boyfriend's neck. \"Mmm, mornin',\" Holden mumbled as he came awake minutes later and jumped when Sean licked at just the right spot behind Holden's ear. \"God, Sean...\" \"Please,\" Sean whispered, grinding his hips into Holden. Holden smiled over his shoulder, and nodded, stretching out until he was comfortable with his legs wide; Holden stuffed a pillow under his hips before crossing his arms under his head and wiggling against Sean. \"Come on,\" he prodded when Sean didn't move, \"Baby, you awake?\" That got Sean's attention. \"Admiring the view,\" he growled, pushing Holden's knees farther apart with his own and reaching for the lube they'd dropped over the side of the bed the night before. Holden was still pretty slick, but Sean still took his time, sliding two fingers into Holden and teasing him with them; Sean always had loved the noises Holden made when he was riled, the grunts and the groans and how Holden would inevitably start to push back. How he'd grumble for more and clutch at the blankets. Two fingers turned to three and Sean pulled his hand free when Holden told him, \"Fuck me, Sean,\" and knelt up. Which was when it hit him: he might never of had this , could have lost it by being a fucking moron. He knew now that he hadn't needed to go so far as to come up on national TV just to get Holden back, but Sean didn't regret it and it had gotten Holden to come home. He sucked in a breath, pushing those thoughts away and turning his attention back to Holden who was looking back at him with questions in his eyes. Sean gave him the best half-smirk he could, grasped his cock and snubbed the head against Holden's ass; it was gentle, somewhat unlike Sean, but Holden didn't have time to think about what that meant. Sean thrust forward, one perfect slide into Holden that left him shaking as he held onto Holden's flanks. The urge to come was only just overridden by the need to hear all the noises Holden could make, feel how Holden writhed and moved under him, and he started to thrust. \" Fuck , Sean,\" Holden ground out, fingers tangling into the pillowcase. He lifted his hips when Sean tugged him up, and grunted into the next thrust; he was already close, Holden's dreams having been a mix of the night before and the things he'd read in some of the books during his impromptu vacation, and it wasn't going to take long. Then Sean pulled out and shoved at Holden until the man was on his back, and thrust in again. It earned Sean a loud moan, half-lidded eyes locked on his, and Holden wrapped his legs around Sean's back, glad for the change in position when Sean leaned in for a kiss. The headboard banged against the wall with the next thrust, which made Holden laugh; he sat up, using one hand on Sean's neck for leverage as he moved, and kissed Sean again, tongue sliding into Sean's mouth, and with a tug on his cock, Holden came. Loose-limbed, Holden let Sean settle him onto the sheets again, and let out a particularly embarrassing moan when Sean thrust into him. \"Come, baby,\" Holden told him, one hand over Sean's heart, \"Come.\" Sean did, slumping forward in the aftermath; he buried his face in Holden's neck, panting, and told Holden, \"Love you.\" \"Love you too.\" \"Don't...don't expect me to say that often.\" Holden laughed. \"No problem.\" \" Love is just a word until someone comes along and gives it meaning. \" - Anon -","Summary":" disclaimer.

It's very different from any of the stories on these two I've done in the past, but I hope that it is still enjoyable! PLEASE REVIEW! I NEED THEM :D Sean quickly dried off his hair as he exited the shower in the locker room, a second towel wrapped around his waist. \"Hey, Sean, we need to talk game plan!\" The coach hollered from his office. \"Sorry, I can't today. I have some place to be.\" Sean replied, slipping the towel off and replacing it with a pair of boxers and then jeans, pulling a fresh t-shirt from his locker. \"This is important, Sean. This could mean the difference between playoffs or not!\" The coach continued. \"Sorry, I'll swing by tomorrow or something. I'm already running late as it is.\" Sean replied, attempting to keep his voice steady. The coach had run practice an extra thirty minutes, which was time that he had been counting on having at his disposal. Sean yanked the shirt over his head and headed from the locker room up to the parking lot, nearly sprinting. He got into his Hummer and adjusted the rear view mirror, eyeing the picture of Holden and himself hanging from it and feeling his mood immediately lighten. Sean drove over the speed limit considerably, heading to a florist that he had once seen advertised on the news. He picked up a single rose, thorns removed, and headed back to his vehicle, heading toward his final destination. However, he was halted in gridlock, stuck beside a pizza delivery truck and behind an SUV. He turned on the radio, tapping his fingers rapidly on the steering wheel in impatience. After about ten minutes, he decided he would simply have to go around the traffic; it was far too important for him to be on time. Sean put his vehicle in reverse, thankful for once to be at the back of a long line of traffic. He drove down an alley that he was sure was illegal, going nearly eighty miles an hour once he looked at the clock. He drove along a side road and finally he reached the place he was looking for, only about a minute or two late. Sean grabbed his flower and sprinted for the door, grateful that no one was around to watch his loss of dignity. He hurried down the hallway, toward the large auditorium. There were people everywhere, crowded in seats, but he knew where he was going. Sean headed for the front row, and found Holden sitting on there with an empty seat beside him. The other man looked up at him first in surprise then with a big smile that made Sean's heart ache a little bit. Even after ten years, he still felt those same emotions he recalled on their first date. \"I was getting worried there for a little bit.\" Holden said as Sean took a seat behind him, grabbing his hand gently and holding it in his own. \"Sorry, the coach ran practice an extra thirty minutes.\" Sean replied. \"You didn't do anything illegal to get here did you?\" Holden asked, raising an eyebrow. \"Of course not.\" Sean lied, smiling at the other man. Holden just smiled and shook his head, thoroughly unconvinced. \"Excuse me, are you Sean Jackson?\" Sean and Holden turned toward a woman sitting beside Sean. She looked to be about thirty, with a kind smile and brunette hair. \"Yeah, that's me.\" Sean replied with a smile. \"My husband LOVES you. Like really, I wonder about our marriage sometimes. Every time he gets the guys together to watch football, he goes on and on about how you're a living legend, breaking barriers for all sorts of people out there. He says you just don't get enough credit.\" \"Well that's really kind of him; tell him thank you for me.\" Sean replied. \"Is this your…boyfriend?\" She asked, turning toward Holden. \"Husband, yeah.\" Sean said, flashing Holden a bright smile which he returned. At this point, Holden had become so accustomed to the publicity it didn't bother him anymore. \"Wow; all of the women in my book club said you were attractive, but they really didn't do you justice.\" She said, smiling large. Holden blushed, a deep red, and Sean had to keep from chuckling at his embarrassment. \"Thank you.\" Holden replied with a smile. \"You two are really like the model family, did you know that?\" She asked, pulling a camera out of her purse. \"Do you mind if I take a picture with you guys?\" \"Sure.\" Sean replied, turning to Holden, who shrugged. The woman got out of her seat and knelt between Sean and Holden's seats, the two men moving their heads so that all three of them were in line. The picture flashed as they each gave a big smile, and then she returned to her seat. \"Thanks; my husband is going to freak out when I show him.\" Before either of them could respond, however, the lights dimmed and the curtain on the stage swept apart, revealing twenty boys and girls, all about seven or eight years old. They began to dance to music, incredibly coordinated for such young kids. Parents were everywhere at once, flashing pictures of their kids, Holden hurrying toward the front with all of the moms. Sean remained in his seat, smiling proudly at the stage nonetheless. After about an hour, the music ended and they all bowed. After a closing announcement from the adult running the program, the kids rushed to their parents, all of whom had returned to their chairs. Holden and Sean stood, hurrying toward the center of the stage. A beautiful little girl with light brown hair to her shoulders and hazel eyes stood there in a black dress with a red ribbon in her hair and a matching little belt around her petite waist. Her face lit up when she saw the two men, both smiling brightly. \"Daddy!\" She hollered, and the sound would have filled the auditorium if there hadn't been a ton of other noise filling the room. Holden swept her off of the stage and into his arms. \"You did great, honey!\" He said, kissing her on the cheek. She hugged his neck tightly, and then turned to Sean. \"Dad!\" She squealed, seeing the other man. \"Hey, Isabelle! Look what I got you!\" He pulled the rose from behind him, and she gasped, reaching out and grabbing it. \"Thank you Dad!\" She said, and Holden allowed Sean to take her and hold their daughter in his arms. \"I love you, sweetheart.\" He said as she wound her hands around his neck just as she had to Holden. \"I love you too, Dad.\" She replied, and then turned to Holden. \"I love you, Daddy.\" \"I love you too, Isabelle.\" Holden said with a smile. Sean set her down on the ground, and she walked a foot or so ahead of them, looking around and waving at several kids she knew, rose gripped tightly in her small hands. Sean grabbed Holden's hand as they walked out to the Hummer, Holden having taken a taxi to get to the school. Holden flashed him a bright smile, and Sean felt his heart rate jump a bit. \"Do you wanna go get ice cream, Isabelle?\" Holden asked as they got into the vehicle. \"Yeah!\" Isabelle replied cheerfully, smile stretching across her face and showing her dimples. Sean smiled, putting the Hummer in reverse and basking in a form of contentment that he cherished deeply.","LastChapter":"My Love By: KellyCRocker59 This is a short little story that really warmed my heart to write.

I'm not sure how well it turned out, but I've always wanted to do an onlooker's perspective on these two. Enjoy and please review :) Now that she thought about it, Kara supposed she had always known, even before Sean had privately told her. As he stood there in front of all the press, telling them something so personal, something that they had no right to know without his consent, she was shocked that he would ever come out. She knew that Sean loved Holden. She had just underestimated the extent. She shouldn't have. From the day Sean introduced them, explaining that Holden was just a good friend, she had been able to tell that something was different about this man from Sean's other friends that she had met. The way Sean never distanced himself too far from him, the way his eyes fixated upon Holden when he spoke or told a story, it was all just a bit off. Holden started coming to nearly every lunch meeting that Kara scheduled with Sean; the explanation was that Holden was just a really supportive friend, and they had plans after the meeting. She didn't buy it, never really bought into it. Kara watched their relationship take shape right before her eyes. Months went by, and she would catch Sean's hand moving away from Holden's leg or arm as they walked somewhere. When she would stop by Sean's house to drop off paperwork that needed signing for advertisers, Holden would be there. He would be dressed, but there was something just slightly off about the tilt of his tie and the buttons on his shirt. Sean had told Kara at the point when he said that they had decided to move in together. Kara of course was worried about the paparazzi, but Sean said that they had kept it up this long, being seen in public and Holden's vehicle in Sean's driveway, that it would make no difference. And then he added that it was something for Kara to worry about, not him. That's what publicists were for, right? Once he had told Kara, she began to notice that their relationship was by no means a fling. She had never really noticed Sean with women, but she had never questioned it. It was his business, after all, and she was just his publicist. So when the three of them were together for the first time since Sean had told her, she had no idea what to expect. It was almost mesmerizing. They were drawn to each other, as though caught in one another's atmosphere. When they were walking in a crowded space, Sean's hand was at the small of Holden's back, guiding him. Protecting him. They're hands would graze when they were eating beside one another, the touch lasting just a bit too long, and if one wasn't looking for it, they wouldn't notice. If Holden tripped, which occasionally happened, Sean would catch him, either looping an arm around his waist or grabbing his arms, never too far away. Whenever the three of them would ride somewhere together, Holden would always lean in Sean's direction, whether or not he meant to. If Sean got frustrated about a loss, Holden would be there when Kara arrived to talk to him about publicity, a simple presence in public and a reassuring boyfriend in private. Now, when she dropped off paperwork, Sean would open the door in only his sweats, sometimes only his boxers. Sometimes she would glance inside the house and Holden would be there, standing or walking by, his white button-up shirt open and showing his bare chest, boxers clothing his bottom half. Sometimes he was only in his boxers, and that's when she became a bit uncomfortable, knowing exactly what had just or was about to occur once she left. But she was happy for Sean. Every time they would have a meeting, Sean couldn't stop smiling, and if the crowd was sparse enough, his hand would rest comfortably on Holden's thigh. Holden wasn't shy, but when it came to Sean's affection he was always embarrassed when a remark about him would be made. Of course, this only made Sean laugh, a sound Kara had rarely heard before Holden came into his life. He was playing better, and that meant that the paparazzi wouldn't be so relentless, making her job easier. On a personal level, she liked Sean, and thought of him as a friend. If Holden made him happy, then she was happy for them. But then, something happened. Sean never told her exactly what it was, but she could guess pretty easily. One day, they had a lunch meeting, and Holden didn't come with Sean. Sean wore a stone expression, no joy present. Kara didn't ask, getting right to business. But his mind wasn't in it. He didn't talk about it, but his behavior betrayed that Holden had left him. He wouldn't be walking around like he was dead if the roles had been reversed. His playing began to slip as well. The paparazzi attacked him, tearing the poor man apart. Kara tried as hard as she could to keep his name clean, but every tabloid and entertainment news television show was dragging Sean through the mud. Retirement was the only option, they said. She felt terrible for Sean, for what he had lost and for the ordeal that his critics were putting him through. And that had led them here. With those two words, the confession as to who he was, the pieces fit together in her mind. Holden hadn't left Sean because he didn't love him. He left him because he didn't think Sean loved him back. And he had given him a choice. Either Sean could have Holden in public, or Sean could remain alone to do as he pleased privately. Kara hurried to acknowledge a newscaster, and as Sean answered Kelvin's question about continuing to play football, she looked up at Sean and felt a joy filling her. She hated this day, hated everything that it tried to shove down a person's throat. But looking at Sean and knowing what he had done to be with the person he loved made her believe that maybe everything would be okay. Maybe she wouldn't be alone for the rest of her life. Maybe a great guy would come along and she could actually fall in love. But she would always hate Valentine's Day, and these were all things that she would never say.","LastChapter":"Things I'll Never Say By: KellyCRocker59 I was going to do their first time next, but this hit me and just wouldn't go away.

He was playing better, and that meant that the paparazzi wouldn't be so relentless, making her job easier. On a personal level, she liked Sean, and thought of him as a friend. If Holden made him happy, then she was happy for them. But then, something happened. Sean never told her exactly what it was, but she could guess pretty easily. One day, they had a lunch meeting, and Holden didn't come with Sean. Sean wore a stone expression, no joy present. Kara didn't ask, getting right to business. But his mind wasn't in it. He didn't talk about it, but his behavior betrayed that Holden had left him. He wouldn't be walking around like he was dead if the roles had been reversed. His playing began to slip as well. The paparazzi attacked him, tearing the poor man apart. Kara tried as hard as she could to keep his name clean, but every tabloid and entertainment news television show was dragging Sean through the mud. Retirement was the only option, they said. She felt terrible for Sean, for what he had lost and for the ordeal that his critics were putting him through. And that had led them here. With those two words, the confession as to who he was, the pieces fit together in her mind. Holden hadn't left Sean because he didn't love him. He left him because he didn't think Sean loved him back. And he had given him a choice. Either Sean could have Holden in public, or Sean could remain alone to do as he pleased privately. Kara hurried to acknowledge a newscaster, and as Sean answered Kelvin's question about continuing to play football, she looked up at Sean and felt a joy filling her. She hated this day, hated everything that it tried to shove down a person's throat. But looking at Sean and knowing what he had done to be with the person he loved made her believe that maybe everything would be okay. Maybe she wouldn't be alone for the rest of her life. Maybe a great guy would come along and she could actually fall in love. But she would always hate Valentine's Day, and these were all things that she would never say.","Summary":" Things I'll Never Say By: KellyCRocker59 I was going to do their first time next, but this hit me a","MetaData":"Rated: Fiction  K+ - English - Romance -  Sean J., Holden W.  - Words: 1,148 - Reviews: 10 - Favs: 45 - Follows: 5 - Published: 5 31 2010 - Status: Complete - id: 6014566 "},{"Movie":"Valentine's Day, 2010","Title":"All I Ever Wanted","Author":"Etheria27","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6079576","Passage":"[Chapter 1] All I Ever Wanted By: KellyCRocker59 I never stay up so late, but I just finished watching Brokeback Mountain for the first time and couldn't get these two off of my mind (as well as Jake Gyllenhal, but that's another story). I enjoyed what I did with the two little ficlets, so I did this, basing small snippets off of each song on Kelly Clarkson's 'All I Ever Wanted' album. I hope you enjoy! Oh, and I don't own the rights to these songs, only two copies of the cd (yes I'm obsessed with her). I need reviews to live, so please help save my life! :D My Life Would Suck Without You Holden felt a song coming on. They were just sitting in a bar, drinking casually as usual, and yet he was feeling a bit more wild then he normally did. So he walked over to the karaoke stage, grabbing the microphone. The place was nearly vacant except for a few overly drunk people. So he had the guy in charge of the karaoke machine put on a song he knew Sean would appreciate. He spent the next three and a half minutes screaming the words to 'My Life Would Suck Without You' as he moved to the music, eyes on his boyfriend, whose face was split with such a huge grin that it threatened to crack. I Do Not Hook Up Holden wasn't one for sex. Yeah, it was mind-blowing, especially when Sean did that thing and good lord if he thought about it anymore he would get a bit too turned on. But for some reason when he told a man at the gym that he didn't just hook up, the guy looked at him like he was crazy. Apparently men were supposed to be like rabbits; they were unable to control their sex drive so just let them be. The guy was so hell bent on this theory, in fact, that he attempted to corner Holden in the bathroom and get him to embrace his opinions. Well, the guy ended up having to tell the paramedic at the gym that he had slipped and fallen against the bathroom stall door and then when he tried to reach the sink, he slipped again on a water puddle and so that was why his eye and lip were swollen. It had nothing to do with a large football player coming in to pee at just the right time and getting a bit too protective. Cry Holden watched the screen as the man that he was all too familiar ran across the football field, ball in hand. Even now, as he sat alone in his motel room with a bottle of vodka in an attempt to drown out the pain, he couldn't help but hope Sean got the touchdown. Is this what happened to people when they broke up? They hated and yet still loved the other person? Because this was just too confusing, and he wasn't sure that he could handle crying himself to sleep, clutching a pillow with an empty bottle of alcohol beside him every night. Maybe tonight, but he was stronger then this. He could get over Sean Jackson. He would just have to cry, cry until the pain went away. Cry until he could manage to see himself without the other man in his life. Don't Let Me Stop You \"I can't just come out, Holden! Dammit, it will ruin my career!\" \"Well then don't let me stop you and your success, Sean! Just let me leave, there are plenty of guys out there for you to screw from the safety of the closet. I'm just not one of them.\" Then he was pinned to the wall, Sean's hands gripping his shoulders more firmly then he ever had before, looking into his eyes with vulnerability he had never seen. \"I don't want this Holden. I can't let you just walk out of my life.\" \"Then don't. Do what you have to do,\" Holden replied, shoving his way past him, \"but until then, I won't stop your career.\" All I Ever Wanted Sean never realized how many damn pictures of Holden he had. One of them together at the lake attached to his bathroom mirror. A photo strip of them looking ridiculous together held by a magnet on the refrigerator. One of just Holden, smiling that beautiful smile while sitting up in bed shirtless, in his Hummer. And one of them, laying completely adorable on the couch, on his bedside table. He threw that one across the room one night when he had rolled over to hold his lover and got nothing but mattress and pillow. He regretted it the next morning, picking it up and placing it right back where it was, broken frame and all. Already Gone Holden packed his bags, stuffing everything he had in them while he heard the front door open. He had been trying to finish this before Sean got back from practice. He felt the tears, hot and wet, slipping down his cheeks. \"Holden?\" Then Sean was there, standing behind him. And then, he was walking closer, hand resting carefully on Holden's shoulder. \"I have to go, Sean. We can't do this to each other anymore. We can't…we can't live this lie. I can't live this lie with you.\" \"What…what are you talking about?\" Sean asked, and Holden could hear his voice breaking, \"I love you.\" \"I love you too, Sean. I…I love you enough to let you go.\" Then he turned, and Sean was right there, eyes watering, biting his lip hard. \"Holden, don't…\" It came out a whisper. \"I'm sorry, Sean...it's just too hard for me to stay here with you. Everything we wanted, everything I wanted, just isn't going to happen.\" And then he walked out of the bedroom, feeling Sean's hand slip from his shoulder, too numb to do anything but walk straight for the front door. If I Can't Have You Holden grinded hard against Sean, feeling what he wanted through the minimum layers of clothing. He loved it when they went to gay bars, because no one thought anything of their behavior. Plus Holden got a bit slutty when the right song came on, and this song, right now, was definitely the right song. Sean held his hips, guiding him, and Holden felt at home. They slipped back to the booths after a while, and their hands were all over one another, neither able to wait until they got home. Sean was on top of him, holding him down and yet keeping him safe. Holden's hands were under Sean's shirt, feeling the muscle that he still wasn't tired of. This was fun, wild. Hot. They didn't do this often, and when they did, they were like wild animals, tearing at one another. After Sean, Holden wasn't sure he could ever want anyone else. Save You Sean walked into the plain white room, the sound of the heart monitor beating softly, betraying the tension in the air. He took a seat beside Holden, just being there. Holden grabbed his hand, and Sean held it firmly, feeling that if he let go Holden might slip away. The room had just three other inhabitants besides the person in the bed, an older woman whose eyes had been closed for weeks and whose breathing had remained steady throughout. But she wasn't alive, not really. \"Holden…are you ready?\" His sister asked, dried tears staining her cheeks. Holden nodded, and then the doctor pulled the plug. The heart monitor flat lined, and Holden's shoulders shook, his sister sobbing against her husband's chest. Sean was there, pulling his partner against him as he sobbed, broken. Sean could feel his own heart breaking. He didn't dare say that it was gonna be alright. It wasn't. Whyyawannabringmedown Sean had been getting some crap from a local newscaster about his sexuality since he had come out. The guy said it was all a stunt, all just for publicity. So, when Sean's team won the Super Bowl under his direction, he pulled Holden, who was standing with the football players' wives in the front rows, down onto the field with him. And when that particular newscaster came up to ask him what he would do now, the video camera zooming in on his face, which he was sure was on national television right now, he pulled his husband in and kissed him right on the lips, and for quite some time. Apparently it aired without issue, and the newscaster didn't say another word on the subject. Long Shot Sean sighed, realizing that today was his first day in which everyone in the country who cared knew he was gay. He could hear the paparazzi outside, their cameras attempting to catch a picture. Holden, who was lying in bed, looked scared to death. \"I'm afraid they are going to see me and be like 'oh, he doesn't like women because of this guy?' \" Sean rolled his eyes, knowing that they had to go outside at some point. And finally the day came, and they stood at the front door, both nervous. \"This is a bit crazy.\" Holden said, gripping Sean's hand tightly. \"I know, it's a long shot.\" Sean said, and then flashed Holden a smile and pushed the door open, the flashing lights snapping pictures of them rapidly. Impossible Holden was nervous, he wasn't going to lie. He had been shocked enough when the adoption papers had actually went through. He had been even more shocked when they found out they were officially the parents of a little two year-old from across the country. Even as they boarded Sean's private jet, Sean had to grip Holden's hand tightly to keep him from becoming too anxious. And then they were there, in the airport. And he saw that little girl, with the blonde curls and those big adorable hazel eyes. She smiled, having seen pictures of them before, and ran toward them as well as she could. And Holden cried. He cried as he swept the little girl up in his arms, and cried as he gave her to Sean, who said she was the most adorable child ever. Ready \"I have something to tell you.\" Sean said as they sat down for dinner. His parents looked at him, a bit concerned by his tone of voice. \"What is it, Sean? You didn't get a girl pregnant, did you?\" His dad asked. \"I'm not in high school, Dad.\" Sean said, and smiled despite himself. Then he realized what he had to do, and he just kind of blurted it out. \"I'm gay.\" And his mom was there hugging him when he started to tear up out of pure fear of their reaction, mostly from his dad. And his dad just stared at him for a long time before speaking. \"Do you have a boyfriend?\" He asked. Sean nodded. \"Can we meet him?\" And Sean nodded again, returning his dad's smile with more relief then he could fathom. I Want You Holden couldn't believe it was raining. Of all the days, did it have to be today? He had just spent twenty minutes attempting to call a tow truck to tow his stupid car after the tire had blown out and he realized he didn't have a spare, and after getting no one he was now walking to the nearest gas station. And it was raining. Then, a rather sexy Hummer pulled up beside him, and the window rolled down. \"Come on, beautiful.\" Sean said from the driver's seat, smile on his face. And Holden couldn't help but laugh, getting into the vehicle and wondering how the hell Sean had gotten to him so quickly from their house. If No One Will Listen Sometimes, Sean wondered if anyone heard him. He wondered if Kara heard him when he said he wanted a family. He wondered if Paula heard him when he said he didn't care whether or not he kept playing football. He wondered if his teammates heard him when he said he would rather not have a female stripper at his birthday party. He wondered if Holden heard him when he said that he loved him as he was walking out the door. But now, standing in front of this crowd of people in an uproar, he knew that everyone was listening. And they were listening to him, listening to his confession. And as he lay in bed that night holding the only man he could ever love, the only person who he had ever put his heart on the line for, Sean knew that all he really needed was for someone to listen.","LastChapter":"All I Ever Wanted By: KellyCRocker59 I never stay up so late, but I just finished watching Brokeback Mountain for the first time and couldn't get these two off of my mind (as well as Jake Gyllenhal, but that's another story).

Not all the people here are like them, he tells himself. But the room is too big & he's handled too many fuckers- fakers, to want to look for them. But this guy-- he really had no idea. Did he know him? Holden cocked his head to the side, he looks familiar but from where? There's nothing malicious about his easy grin, though, or the crinkles his eyes form from smiling. So Holden takes his hand and they strike up a conversation. iii. But that doesn't matter. Sean stands & gestures to the buffet table, saying he'll be right back & did Holden (what an interesting name) want anything? The shake of his head told him no but the lingering gaze at the table convinces Sean that he's going to get something for the both of them anyway (He hopes Holden doesn't mind sharing a plate though). He makes his way to the table, unaware of all the staring & the gossip that follow him until someone pulls him aside as an invitation into their circle. \"Sean!\" it comes out as a gasp. Disbelief, scandalous, Sean doesn't know why. \"Do you know who you were just talking to?\" (Sean tries to remember this lady's name.) \"Yeah, Holden Bristow's a professor in somewhere in New York. But he's nothing compared to a football jock,\" he kids, flexing an arm to show his muscles. He flashes the ladies a grin & a couple of them bats their eyes at him. Eugh. \"That's not the point,\" (he remembers now!) Amanda interjects, making an impatient gesture with her hand. She leans closer. Everyone else does. \"A little bird chirpped in my ear that he finds birds of the same feather... scrumptious ,\" she ends in a fit of what sounds like sinister cackling. One of the eye batters gasp and peek at Holden's direction. Sean wants to roll his eyes because she is not discreet whatsoever. \"So?\" he goes because, seriously: So? Amanda shakes her head. Sean thinks she's a reporter who interviewed him once but can't remember from what channel or magazine or newspaper. \"If you spend time with him for too long, people are going to start talking-- well, they already are.\" Something in Sean freezes because fuck, he does not need that right now. He is a rising champion & he couldn't let talk bring him down to th dirt. But he catches Holden, who is also (intert want to eye roll) doing a poor job of not watching them. Holden finishes his whisky & stands to leave the bar. At once, Sean's mind is made up. \"Ladies, let me remind you that we are not in middle school anymore,\" he says & hands his plate to a passing waiter. \"Now if you'll excuse me, I have a friend to catch up with.\" iv. We'll have time to know each other. Ah, of course. He's read about Sean millions of times. The football star. Holden finds him handsome, more so with that smile. When he stands, Holden is disappointed because he was genuinely enjoying the conversation; is relieved when Sean tells him he'll be back. If Holden hadn't been admiring Sean's body (shame on him, but he was) he wouldn't have seen Amanda talking to Sean. He can tell by the looks some of the ladies throw him, that he is the subject of their conversation. He catches Sean's eyeing him but Holden can't tell with what. He has to get out of here, doesn't want another person looking at him with judgement. Holden hides his grimace behind his glass & drowns the whisky. He leaves, without saying good bye to anyone. Outside, the air is chilly & he regrets forgetting his coat. The whisky has stopped burning his throat, stopped being a warm presence in his stomach. He rubs his hands together, trying to get some semblance of warmth. Something is draped on his shoulder. He turns. \"You forgot your coat,\" Sean tells him, his charming smile still on his face. \"Shouldn't you be inside?\" he asks, finding it hard to be irritated at Sean. To his surprise, the burnette laughs. \"Nah, I doubt anyone would miss me,\" he answers. \"But you left before I could tell you all about my horrible habits.\" Part of Holden is surprised that Sean still prefers his company but masks this. \"From what I know about you, that's a long list. I guess I'll be stuck with you all night,\" Holden states sadly, but he is smiling, his eyes shows amusement. v. Starting now. \"Yes, but first, burgers! A growing boy needs his feed,\" Sean jokes & steers Holden to a random direction, that will hopefully lead them to a Burger King, his hand on his companion's elbow, where it stays. Even when they've both declared themselves lost & end up calling Sean's chauffer to pick them up.","LastChapter":"Wrote this for a friend, posted it in LJ.

Did he know him? Holden cocked his head to the side, he looks familiar but from where? There's nothing malicious about his easy grin, though, or the crinkles his eyes form from smiling. So Holden takes his hand and they strike up a conversation. iii. But that doesn't matter. Sean stands & gestures to the buffet table, saying he'll be right back & did Holden (what an interesting name) want anything? The shake of his head told him no but the lingering gaze at the table convinces Sean that he's going to get something for the both of them anyway (He hopes Holden doesn't mind sharing a plate though). He makes his way to the table, unaware of all the staring & the gossip that follow him until someone pulls him aside as an invitation into their circle. \"Sean!\" it comes out as a gasp. Disbelief, scandalous, Sean doesn't know why. \"Do you know who you were just talking to?\" (Sean tries to remember this lady's name.) \"Yeah, Holden Bristow's a professor in somewhere in New York. But he's nothing compared to a football jock,\" he kids, flexing an arm to show his muscles. He flashes the ladies a grin & a couple of them bats their eyes at him. Eugh. \"That's not the point,\" (he remembers now!) Amanda interjects, making an impatient gesture with her hand. She leans closer. Everyone else does. \"A little bird chirpped in my ear that he finds birds of the same feather... scrumptious ,\" she ends in a fit of what sounds like sinister cackling. One of the eye batters gasp and peek at Holden's direction. Sean wants to roll his eyes because she is not discreet whatsoever. \"So?\" he goes because, seriously: So? Amanda shakes her head. Sean thinks she's a reporter who interviewed him once but can't remember from what channel or magazine or newspaper. \"If you spend time with him for too long, people are going to start talking-- well, they already are.\" Something in Sean freezes because fuck, he does not need that right now. He is a rising champion & he couldn't let talk bring him down to th dirt. But he catches Holden, who is also (intert want to eye roll) doing a poor job of not watching them. Holden finishes his whisky & stands to leave the bar. At once, Sean's mind is made up. \"Ladies, let me remind you that we are not in middle school anymore,\" he says & hands his plate to a passing waiter. \"Now if you'll excuse me, I have a friend to catch up with.\" iv. We'll have time to know each other. Ah, of course. He's read about Sean millions of times. The football star. Holden finds him handsome, more so with that smile. When he stands, Holden is disappointed because he was genuinely enjoying the conversation; is relieved when Sean tells him he'll be back. If Holden hadn't been admiring Sean's body (shame on him, but he was) he wouldn't have seen Amanda talking to Sean. He can tell by the looks some of the ladies throw him, that he is the subject of their conversation. He catches Sean's eyeing him but Holden can't tell with what. He has to get out of here, doesn't want another person looking at him with judgement. Holden hides his grimace behind his glass & drowns the whisky. He leaves, without saying good bye to anyone. Outside, the air is chilly & he regrets forgetting his coat. The whisky has stopped burning his throat, stopped being a warm presence in his stomach. He rubs his hands together, trying to get some semblance of warmth. Something is draped on his shoulder. He turns. \"You forgot your coat,\" Sean tells him, his charming smile still on his face. \"Shouldn't you be inside?\" he asks, finding it hard to be irritated at Sean. To his surprise, the burnette laughs. \"Nah, I doubt anyone would miss me,\" he answers. \"But you left before I could tell you all about my horrible habits.\" Part of Holden is surprised that Sean still prefers his company but masks this. \"From what I know about you, that's a long list. I guess I'll be stuck with you all night,\" Holden states sadly, but he is smiling, his eyes shows amusement. v. Starting now. \"Yes, but first, burgers! A growing boy needs his feed,\" Sean jokes & steers Holden to a random direction, that will hopefully lead them to a Burger King, his hand on his companion's elbow, where it stays. Even when they've both declared themselves lost & end up calling Sean's chauffer to pick them up.","Summary":" Wrote this for a friend, posted it in LJ.

It took a lot of thought, and I wanted to make it perfect, so I hope it is! Please tell me if anything is off or doesn't feel right or just isn't good; I love feedback. Please, please, PLEASE review! I'm not above begging ;) Sean and Holden had been dating for nearly a year. They spent almost every weekend together, with as many nights of the week as Sean could manage to get his manager to clear up spent on dates or just in the other's company. Holden found himself staying later and later at night over at Sean's house. They would make out for long periods, but Sean would never push him to do anything beyond that. Holden wasn't a prude; he just wanted sex to be as special as possible. He knew Sean wanted to have sex; why wouldn't he? Holden wanted to as well; Sean was the sexiest man he had probably ever seen, and that wasn't just him being biased. But Holden wasn't about to have sex just to keep Sean in his life. That just wasn't right, and Sean wouldn't leave him because he was withholding sex. Sean was perfectly aware of why Holden wanted to wait, and respected that. Holden had no idea how many sexual partners Sean had had. He only knew of one that Sean had told him about, and it was just a guy he had messed around with whenever he was first wondering whether or not he was really gay. As for Holden, he had never actually made love to someone as the older people called it. He had only ever been raped in college by a fellow student, drugged by his former boyfriend in exchange for money. Sean was still very uncomfortable with that fact, and was therefore always careful with Holden and protective when they were in public. At least that was the explanation Holden had come up with. Maybe it was just Sean's nature. He reflected on his relationship with Sean as he sat on his boyfriend's bed, contemplating the decision he was about to make. Sean had given him a key so that Holden could come over whenever he needed anything, regardless of whether or not Sean was home. That was the luxury of having an insanely rich boyfriend, Holden supposed. But as for the reason why he was sitting on Sean's bed, Holden had thrown the idea of their first time together around in his mind, and tonight seemed like as perfect a night as any. Holden didn't want to wait for a holiday or special occasion; that would put a time table on it. He had decided a while ago that he would just know when it was time to sleep with Sean. And he had woken up that morning and just known somehow. Something in his head told him it was the night for them to be together. Holden had the weekend off, and Sean would be at a charity benefit until about ten o'clock that night, with nothing to go to all weekend, giving Holden the perfect chance to plan everything. So he went about it without saying a single word to Sean. He wanted it to be a surprise; after all, Sean had at least a bit of experience. Holden had none, so he needed some sort of leverage to even the playing field. He didn't know if he could handle it if he turned out to be terrible in bed. Holden made a playlist of his favorite, most romantic songs. Nearly every single one was Mariah Carey, his favorite artist. Sean didn't love her like he did, but it was the sentiment that counted, and Sean was a sucker for these sort of things. Holden then bought a large container of rose petals; it took a bit of searching to find a business that actually sold real rose petals in a container, but he eventually found a place and made his purchase. That evening, he went over to Sean's house after texting him to make sure he was at the benefit, and began to get everything ready. He had of course made sure to take a shower and do everything necessary to looking as amazing as possible, but he was still nervous about Sean seeing him naked. He didn't have the best self esteem, and he was sure Sean, being the football player that he was, had a much more sculpted body then he did. He wasn't going to let his petty insecurities stop him, however, and positioned the stereo in Sean's bedroom just right, setting up and lighting all the right candles in all the right places so that everything looked perfectly serene, turning off the lights completely for full effect. And then, he started playing the music softly, adjusting it to the perfect volume. Then came the part of his plan that would make him a bit uncomfortable. He stripped off the suit that he had been wearing since his brief meeting earlier that day, all the way down to where he was garbed in only his boxers and button-up white shirt, which he unbuttoned all the way down and let hang open. He looked at his phone; it was nearly nine-fifty. He was right on schedule. He texted Sean, asking him if he was still at the benefit. Sean replied yes, but he was about to leave. So Holden, in the most mysterious way possible, texted him back that Sean should hurry home once it was over, because he was lonely. Immediately after he sent it, Holden realized it was a frail attempt at being sexy, and thought Sean was probably holding back a laugh as he read the message in the cordial environment. He attempted to stage a position that would be sexy enough to redeem him. Holden climbed onto the bed after scattering the rose petals and, using the remote for the stereo that was on the bedside table, put 'Touch My Body' by Mariah Carey on repeat. He then positioned his legs spread, back against the headboard, and took a small pillow, planting it between his legs. Sean would hopefully walk in and not be able to hold himself back. Minutes went by, and Holden was beginning to get nervous. He was glad he liked the song as much as he did, because it was probably playing for the tenth time. Then, finally, as he was beginning to get a bit weary of sitting in the same position, he heard the front door open and close quietly. \"Hey, I'm home!\" Sean called, not sure where his boyfriend was. Holden contemplated speaking, but thought against it. Sean would surely head to the bedroom first to change clothes from whatever suit he was in. Probably that grey one that looked so good on him. Crap, Holden didn't know if he would be able to wait much longer. \"Holden, are you here?\" Sean asked, voice getting closer. Holden refused to move, and then, finally, the bedroom door, which he had left ajar, was pushed open. There stood Sean, in all of his suited sexiness. His expression morphed immediately from curiosity as to where Holden was to surprise, and then to realization. \"I'm ready.\" Was all Holden could manage as he held his position, immediately feeling incredibly uncomfortable. \"Are you sure?\" Sean asked, that concern that he got in his eyes visible even in the dark room. \"What?\" Holden asked, not sure he was hearing him right, \"Y-Yeah, I'm sure.\" Sean walked closer to the bed, and just stood there. \"Holden, I don't need this if you aren't ready. I don't want you to feel like I'm pressuring you into anything.\" Holden got off the bed, unable to take it anymore. He began buttoning his shirt back up, reaching for his clothes on the floor. \"This was a bad idea. I'm sorry, please, just forget this ever happened.\" However, as he went to leave the room, he felt himself stopped in place by two hands on his arms. He turned toward them, Sean standing and attempting to catch his gaze. \"Holden…I love you. I want this…lord, I want this so bad. But it just surprised me. I'm sorry…\" Holden melted into that look that Sean gave him. The look that said he would never leave him, that as long as he was there, Holden had nothing to worry about. That Sean would take care of him. And he cracked. Holden leaned up, pressing his lips to Sean's. Sean was surprised, but then pushed his lips back against Holden's, one hand on his hip and the other on the small of his back. Holden's hands went to Sean's jacket, pushing it from his shoulders. Sean's hands found the buttons on Holden's shirt, unbuttoning the several that the other male had attempted to button back. \"I want this so bad, Sean…I want to show you how much I love you…\" Holden whispered as their lips parted briefly, foreheads pressing together. Then, their lips were against one another's again, this time less rushed and more passionate. Holden yanked Sean's button-up shirt from his pants, Sean undoing his tie and throwing it to the side. Holden worked the buttons down, shoving the shirt from his shoulders to reveal his toned chest. Holden immediately felt self-conscious, no matter how much he was trying not to. Sean attempted to push the shirt the rest of the way off of Holden, but Holden sort of pulled away, trying not to break their kiss. \"What's wrong?\" Sean asked, pulling away and resting his hands on Holden's shoulders. \"I just…sorry, I'm just…I'm self-conscious.\" He whispered, looking down and feeling ashamed. He didn't think it would be this debilitating. \"Of what? Your body?\" Sean asked, and then his hands were running down Holden's bare chest. Holden flinched away, but Sean moved one hand to rest underneath the shirt against his back, the other on his chin. \"You're beautiful, Holden...even if you didn't have an amazing body, which you do , I would still think that. I want to see you, to touch you. I just…I want to be able to let you feel how much I love you.\" \"But I'm all…I don't know, I have all this hair and you're so smooth and sexy and-and…\" He mentally kicked himself for stuttering over his words. \"So? You think chest hair makes you ugly? I think it's hot. And I think it's looks sexy as hell on you.\" Sean said, smiling at Holden and holding his eyes with his own. Holden smiled back, blushing. \"There we go, there's that adorable blush again. Now let's get these clothes off.\" And their lips were together again, Holden feeling at home in Sean's arms. He didn't even know what he had been worrying about now as Sean finally managed to shove his shirt off, leaving him in only his boxers. Then, Sean was lowering him slowly onto the bed, lips against his own, gentle and passionate. Sean stood back up, working his belt free and shoving his pants off. Then, he climbed back onto the bed in only his boxers, just as Holden was. They just kissed there, hands exploring one another's body. And then Sean slipped his hands into the fabric of Holden's boxers, pulling at the elastic. \"Ready for this?\" Sean asked, pulling back briefly. Holden nodded, and then Sean was pulling his boxers off, his own following quickly. They kicked the clothing away, and Holden felt their manhoods rubbing, both of the them getting into the mood quickly. Sean met his lips again and as they kissed he grabbed their erections, pumping them slowly against one another. Holden gripped Sean's back tightly as pleasure coursed through him, his hips moving against the other male's hand. \"That feel good?\" Sean asked, breathing heavy. Holden nodded, and pulled Sean's neck back down to meet his lips again. He wanted to be flooded with Sean, overwhelmed by just his presence. He wanted to be here with him and never leave. Then, Sean pulled back, stopping the ministrations with his hand. \"Are you ready for…you know...?\" He asked. Holden nodded blushing a bit, \"I've…I've never really done this before so…\" \"I know…trust me, Holden, I would never hurt you; I've never done this before either but-\" \"You haven't either?\" Holden asked, surprised. \"No; I mean I messed around with guys but I was never in a relationship long enough to where I was comfortable with doing something like this…\" Sean explained, hand absentmindedly running along Holden's stomach. Holden smiled, \"I'm…I'm really glad we get to be each other's firsts.\" And then there was that damn blush again. Sean chuckled, and kissed Holden gently again. Then, he reached over into his bedside drawer and pulled out a bottle of lubricant and a condom. \"I bought it just in case you ever decided to do it without me having time to prepare.\" He explained. \"Good thinking.\" Holden replied with a smile. Then, Sean was lifting his leg up. Holden twisted it around Sean's lower back, giving him room. Sean squeezed the lubricant out and coated his fingers in it. \"This might sting a little at first, but I'll try to be gentle.\" Sean warned, and then a finger was probing Holden's hole, pushing its way in. The ring muscles protested then gave away, Holden gasping at the feeling of having something inside of him. It felt…odd, but not bad. Sean began kissing him again, gently as he thrust the finger in and out. Then there was another finger added, and Holden arched his back a bit, gasping against Sean's mouth. \"You okay?\" Sean said, immediately stopping. \"Yeah, yeah I'm fine. Just…keep going.\" Holden replied. Sean continued after searching Holden's face to be sure he was telling the truth, the fingers scissoring apart and stretching Holden, preparing him for what was about to happen. Then, Sean pulled the digits out and sat up on his knees. \"Tell me if this hurts and I'll stop.\" Sean said, eyes focusing on Holden with that protectiveness that he loved him for. Holden nodded, \"I'm sure I can handle it. I just want you, Sean.\" Sean smiled. \"You can't say things like that. It's way too hot.\" Holden chuckled, and then Sean was lifting his legs onto his hips, pulling him toward him from where they had scooted against the headboard somehow. Sean pulled on the condom, spread on a bit more lubricant, and then Holden felt the head against his entrance. Sean was big, and Holden held the sheets in preparation. Then, Sean was pushing the head in, breeching Holden in the most personal way. It stretched Holden wide, pain spreading through him. Holden arched his back and gripped the sheets tightly, gasping. \"Holden, are you okay?\" Sean asked, stopping immediately. Holden nodded, \"Yeah, you're just…you know, big. I can handle it though.\" Sean smiled, and Holden felt him pulse inside of him. \"Man, why do you have to say stuff that's so sexy when I'm already way turned on.\" Sean said, blushing a bit. Holden smiled, and then Sean focused again. Alright, here we go.\" Holden Sean pushing in deeper; it hurt still, but it was a dull pain as his body fit around Sean's erection, the other male filling him more and more. \"Almost there…\" Sean said, body tilted over Holden. And then, just as he buried himself completely within him and pressed their chests together, Holden felt a surge of pleasure so intense his back arched completely off the bed as he gasped. \"Holden, what's wrong?\" Sean asked, concerned. \"N-Nothing, that place you hit, it…it just felt really good,\" Holden managed out, \"just start moving.\" Sean did so, elbows resting on either side of Holden's shoulders as he pulled out and pushed back in fully. Both males groaned loudly, Holden's hands clinging to Sean's back. Sean developed a steady pace, pulling out and thrusting back in. Pleasure pulsated through Holden as he went, his erection rubbing between their stomachs. \"Holden, man…feels so good…\" Sean gasped out, leaning down and kissing him as he began to speed up. Holden clung even more desperately to Sean as the pleasure built within him, pressure tightening his lower stomach inside. Sean was thrusting fast now, Holden moving his hips against the other male. Then, Sean was on his knees again, gripping Holden hips and thrusting rapidly. Holden pushed himself up, Sean falling back into a sitting position as their legs overlapped, the football player now thrusting up into the other male. Groans pulsed through them as Holden gripped Sean's back. \"S-Sean…close…\" Holden managed to warn. Sean didn't slow, continuing to thrust rapidly, relentlessly against the place that made Holden's body pulse with pleasure. Then, the pressure exploded, pleasure bursting through Holden as he tightened around Sean's erection. \"Sean!\" He moaned loudly, and came against their stomachs. One more thrust and Sean pushed deep within him. \"H-Holden…\" He groaned, and Holden could feel the other male's seed overflowing the condom, inside of him. They just stayed there for a moment, both panting heavily. Then, Sean pulled out, laying them down slowly onto the bed. He pulled the condom off and tossed it into the trash can by his bedside counter. Holden rolled over so that Sean could lay down, the football player pulling the covers up around them before lying down on his back. Holden curled into Sean's side, the other male wrapping an arm protectively around him. Sean leaned down, kissing him gently. \"I love you.\" Sean whispered to him. It was only for his ears to hear. \"I love you too.\" Holden said, burying his face into Sean's chest and feeling himself enveloped but sleep. \"Do you want to...move in together?\" Sean asked. \"That sounds really nice.\" Holden replied, looking up at the other male, who smiled down at him. \"Good...because I think we might be meant for each other, Holden.\" He replied. \"I think you're right.\" Holden said, and then felt sleep take him. He had never felt so complete in his life.","LastChapter":"First Time By: KellyCRocker59 Well, here it is! It took a lot of thought, and I wanted to make it perfect, so I hope it is!

Holden nodded blushing a bit, \"I've…I've never really done this before so…\" \"I know…trust me, Holden, I would never hurt you; I've never done this before either but-\" \"You haven't either?\" Holden asked, surprised. \"No; I mean I messed around with guys but I was never in a relationship long enough to where I was comfortable with doing something like this…\" Sean explained, hand absentmindedly running along Holden's stomach. Holden smiled, \"I'm…I'm really glad we get to be each other's firsts.\" And then there was that damn blush again. Sean chuckled, and kissed Holden gently again. Then, he reached over into his bedside drawer and pulled out a bottle of lubricant and a condom. \"I bought it just in case you ever decided to do it without me having time to prepare.\" He explained. \"Good thinking.\" Holden replied with a smile. Then, Sean was lifting his leg up. Holden twisted it around Sean's lower back, giving him room. Sean squeezed the lubricant out and coated his fingers in it. \"This might sting a little at first, but I'll try to be gentle.\" Sean warned, and then a finger was probing Holden's hole, pushing its way in. The ring muscles protested then gave away, Holden gasping at the feeling of having something inside of him. It felt…odd, but not bad. Sean began kissing him again, gently as he thrust the finger in and out. Then there was another finger added, and Holden arched his back a bit, gasping against Sean's mouth. \"You okay?\" Sean said, immediately stopping. \"Yeah, yeah I'm fine. Just…keep going.\" Holden replied. Sean continued after searching Holden's face to be sure he was telling the truth, the fingers scissoring apart and stretching Holden, preparing him for what was about to happen. Then, Sean pulled the digits out and sat up on his knees. \"Tell me if this hurts and I'll stop.\" Sean said, eyes focusing on Holden with that protectiveness that he loved him for. Holden nodded, \"I'm sure I can handle it. I just want you, Sean.\" Sean smiled. \"You can't say things like that. It's way too hot.\" Holden chuckled, and then Sean was lifting his legs onto his hips, pulling him toward him from where they had scooted against the headboard somehow. Sean pulled on the condom, spread on a bit more lubricant, and then Holden felt the head against his entrance. Sean was big, and Holden held the sheets in preparation. Then, Sean was pushing the head in, breeching Holden in the most personal way. It stretched Holden wide, pain spreading through him. Holden arched his back and gripped the sheets tightly, gasping. \"Holden, are you okay?\" Sean asked, stopping immediately. Holden nodded, \"Yeah, you're just…you know, big. I can handle it though.\" Sean smiled, and Holden felt him pulse inside of him. \"Man, why do you have to say stuff that's so sexy when I'm already way turned on.\" Sean said, blushing a bit. Holden smiled, and then Sean focused again. Alright, here we go.\" Holden Sean pushing in deeper; it hurt still, but it was a dull pain as his body fit around Sean's erection, the other male filling him more and more. \"Almost there…\" Sean said, body tilted over Holden. And then, just as he buried himself completely within him and pressed their chests together, Holden felt a surge of pleasure so intense his back arched completely off the bed as he gasped. \"Holden, what's wrong?\" Sean asked, concerned. \"N-Nothing, that place you hit, it…it just felt really good,\" Holden managed out, \"just start moving.\" Sean did so, elbows resting on either side of Holden's shoulders as he pulled out and pushed back in fully. Both males groaned loudly, Holden's hands clinging to Sean's back. Sean developed a steady pace, pulling out and thrusting back in. Pleasure pulsated through Holden as he went, his erection rubbing between their stomachs. \"Holden, man…feels so good…\" Sean gasped out, leaning down and kissing him as he began to speed up. Holden clung even more desperately to Sean as the pleasure built within him, pressure tightening his lower stomach inside. Sean was thrusting fast now, Holden moving his hips against the other male. Then, Sean was on his knees again, gripping Holden hips and thrusting rapidly. Holden pushed himself up, Sean falling back into a sitting position as their legs overlapped, the football player now thrusting up into the other male. Groans pulsed through them as Holden gripped Sean's back. \"S-Sean…close…\" Holden managed to warn. Sean didn't slow, continuing to thrust rapidly, relentlessly against the place that made Holden's body pulse with pleasure. Then, the pressure exploded, pleasure bursting through Holden as he tightened around Sean's erection. \"Sean!\" He moaned loudly, and came against their stomachs. One more thrust and Sean pushed deep within him. \"H-Holden…\" He groaned, and Holden could feel the other male's seed overflowing the condom, inside of him. They just stayed there for a moment, both panting heavily. Then, Sean pulled out, laying them down slowly onto the bed. He pulled the condom off and tossed it into the trash can by his bedside counter. Holden rolled over so that Sean could lay down, the football player pulling the covers up around them before lying down on his back. Holden curled into Sean's side, the other male wrapping an arm protectively around him. Sean leaned down, kissing him gently. \"I love you.\" Sean whispered to him. It was only for his ears to hear. \"I love you too.\" Holden said, burying his face into Sean's chest and feeling himself enveloped but sleep. \"Do you want to...move in together?\" Sean asked. \"That sounds really nice.\" Holden replied, looking up at the other male, who smiled down at him. \"Good...because I think we might be meant for each other, Holden.\" He replied. \"I think you're right.\" Holden said, and then felt sleep take him. He had never felt so complete in his life.","Summary":" First Time By: KellyCRocker59 Well, here it is!

Thanks for your time! Sean and Holden had been dating for a couple of weeks, going out every few days. Holden was in the best mood he had ever been in every day; Sean did little things, even when they weren't together, that just made him crazy. Sometimes, he would open the door to his apartment to find little gifts that he knew were from the football player. It was just the other day that Holden had found a framed, autographed picture of Mariah Carey awaiting him. He had texted Sean, who he knew was in practice, and thanked him, stating various compliments about how he was the best boyfriend (yes, they were official) ever and he couldn't believe he had done something like that for him, and various other things. But there were three words he didn't say. They were about as serious as they could be; they hadn't slept together yet, but they were together as much as possible. Their friends were getting sick of hearing them talk about each other, and yet there was this thing between them that was keeping Sean and Holden from truly committing. I love you . Holden had never said it to someone before, at least not in the sense that it would pertain to Sean. Sure, he had said it to his parents, and to his best friends, but never to a boyfriend. Not even the one he had had before Sean that had lasted for three years. Those words were precious to him; he didn't just throw them around. And he was afraid they would begin to drift apart because of it. Sean hadn't said it to him, either. They hadn't talked about it, so Holden had no idea how Sean felt about the subject. But here he was, dwelling on it prior to their third date of the week. It was Friday night, which Sean had made a habit out of making the best dates of the week. Sean was picking him up, and as was the norm, Holden had no idea what they were doing. Pulling him from his thoughts, a knock sounded on Holden's door. Holden stood and walked over, dressed in jeans and a moderately nice t shirt. Sean was there, that sexy grin on his face, dressed in similar quality of clothing. \"I'm gonna blow your mind.\" Sean said excitedly, reaching forward and grabbing Holden's hand. Holden was beyond grateful that he could easily melt into the other male's touch and eyes, able to push his distraught thoughts far, far away. Sean drove them to a still-unknown location, conversation about the week steady as it always was, their fingers intertwined on Holden's lap. The drive was long, and finally Holden had to ask. \"So…where exactly are we going?\" \"Just know that you are about to have the absolute best time of your life.\" Sean said. \"That's pretty much how it is on all of our dates.\" Holden replied. Sean smiled, a hint of red touching his cheeks. Over the past weeks, Holden had discovered those comments that, if he was bold enough and used them at just the right time, would earn him a blush from the other male. It was the most adorable thing he had ever seen, and when it happened, he cherished it. The conversation drifted away and Holden simply listening to the steady strumming of John Mayer on the stereo. Finally, they pulled into a packed area. Sean drove straight to the front, and of course there was a spot saved just for him. However, Holden was a bit nervous. \"Are you sure we should be here?\" He asked. Sean shut off the engine and turned to him, confusion on his face, \"Yeah, why?\" \"Well, there are a lot of people here, and you're not exactly out to the public.\" Sean's eyes filled with understanding, and he reached over, touching Holden's cheek, \"Don't worry about me; this is for you. People will be too focused on the main attraction to notice who I am.\" Holden smiled, Sean's callused hand feeling nice against his skin. \"What is the main attraction, exactly?\" He asked. \"You'll see.\" Sean replied, getting out of the vehicle. They entered the arena, and then Holden saw a massive poster that showed exactly why they were here. This was a Mariah Carey concert. He stopped in his tracks, turned to Sean. \"No way.\" He managed to say. Sean was grinning brightly, and Holden thought he might as well die because he knew what heaven felt like. \"We better get in there; it's going to start soon.\" Sean replied. The concert was absolutely mind blowing. Holden sang along to every word as Mariah danced along the stage and gave an amazing performance. Sean was right; everyone was too involved in the concert to notice him even being there. The football player seemed to enjoy himself, if only because he liked watching Holden go crazy. Their seats were in the very front row, so Holden could literally see the sweat dripping from her forehead. However, as the concert winded down, Mariah took a seat and began to sing her song 'We Belong Together.' As the lyrics played and everyone in the arena sang along, Holden got lost in his thoughts, which returned to the subject that they were on at the beginning of their date. He looked at Sean, who actually knew the words to the song and was singing along watching Mariah. They needed to talk about this. The concert ended and they left, taking an exit that Sean paid a guard to show them. Once outside, Holden felt rain on his head. He looked up just in time to feel the downpour hit. They were all the way on the left side of the arena, and would have to walk all the way around to get to Sean's vehicle. Sean seized Holden's hand and hurried them around; no one was around to hinder their movement, so the two males made it back to the front before hardly anyone was out of the building. Then, Holden just stopped a few feet from Sean's Hummer. \"What's wrong?\" Sean asked loudly as the rain pelted both of them. \"I have to ask you something.\" Holden replied at equal volume. \"Can you wait until we're in the vehicle?\" Sean asked. \"No.\" Holden replied. Sean stepped closer to the other male, looking down into his eyes. \"I feel like we've reached an end, Sean. Tonight was amazing, you're amazing, but…unless one of us takes that next step, then we are going to drift apart and I don't know if I can handle losing you.\" Sean gripped Holden's hands in his, \"I…I understand. I've kind of felt the same way.\" \"I…Sean, I love you.\" Holden whispered, just loud enough for the other male to hear. Sean smiled that big smile, and Holden knew that it was right to say. That it was exactly how he felt, and how he had never felt before. \"I love you too, Holden.\" Sean replied, leaning down and, in the pouring rain, pressing their lips together. Those three words sent Holden into bliss, his arms wrapping around Sean's neck as he tried to press himself as closely to the other male as he could. Sean's hands gripped his hips against him as they kissed passionately, not even caring if anyone saw. Then, finally, they pulled apart. \"I'll never let you go, Holden.\" Sean said, the back of his fingers running along the other male's cheek. Those words lingered, and Holden knew he was with the only man he could ever love.","LastChapter":"Those Three Words By: KellyCRocker59 This is a bit in the future from Second Date; thank you everyone who is showing mad support for me and my writing on these two!

I hope it is enjoyable and everything is solid; I just really wanted to do a camping story so here you go! Please review; I thrive on them. Holden was not the camping type. He didn't enjoy it, and while he wasn't hateful toward those that made it a regular hobby, simply couldn't fathom how anyone could feel differently. And yet here he was, camping with his boyfriend. Sean, of course, loved doing such a manly activity, and had practically begged Holden to go with him on their third year anniversary. Sean was currently setting up their tent, which was set deep in the forest, away from any other campers. Not that either of them cared anymore, considering that everyone on the planet knew about Sean. It was just a matter of privacy. Finally, their tent was finished, and Holden transferred their belongings into it. \"You should really wear a t-shirt and shorts more often.\" Sean commented, and Holden felt his hand run along his hip and down the side of his khaki shorts as he was leaning over his bag to remove the sleeping bags. \"It makes me feel awkward.\" Holden grumbled, blushing despite himself at the other man's affection. \"Maybe you would be more comfortable without them on?\" Sean asked, turning Holden around and toying now with the hem of his shirt, tugging gently at it. \"Not in the middle of the day; people are awake. I don't want anyone overhearing.\" Holden explained, leaning up to place a kiss on Sean's lips. \"Yeah, you do get pretty loud,\" Sean replied with a big smile, chasing Holden's lips, hands resting firmly on his boyfriend's hips, keeping him in place. Holden wrapped his arms around Sean's neck, pulling him down further, attempting to be completely enveloped by the man in front of him, the familiar smell of musk and fresh pine trees intoxicating his senses as Sean's hands pulled insistently at his shirt, but instead simply running up under the back of it and along Holden's skin. Holden tangled his fingers in Sean's hair, kissing him deeply for a moment longer before pulling back and burying his face in Sean's chest, the muscles flexing beneath his cheek. Sean rested his hands around Holden's lower back, kissing his neck. \"I don't even know why we brought two sleeping bags; it's not like we're going to be using more then one.\" Sean said against Holden's hair, resting his chin there. \"We probably need to get to gathering supplies before the sun goes down; I heard it's supposed to get really cold.\" Holden said, ignoring the comment verbally but unable to stop that blush from tinting his cheeks at what Sean had said. \"Yeah, you're right.\" Sean replied, pulling back but still holding onto Holden's hand, leading him out of the tent. Holden had volunteered to get firewood, but Sean was too worried about the risk of him getting injured dealing with heavy branches to allow that, so instead Holden was assigned the task of filling several pales with water from the nearby lake; Sean wanted the full effect of this trip. He traveled down a narrow trail that led to the lake, which was populated by various other campers. Holden bent over the water, filling the first, and then the second, with water. He stood, going to leave back for their tent, when he almost dropped the pales from his hands in surprise. There, walking alongside a young woman was his ex-boyfriend from college. The memories hit him like a wave, flooding his mind in a blur of pieces. The boyfriend whom he had thought he may love. The boyfriend who had been hard up for money. The boyfriend who had taken money from a friend in exchange for slipping drugs into Holden's drink. The boyfriend who had given an unconscious Holden to his friend so that he could be raped. The boyfriend who had helped violate him in a way he couldn't forget. And here he was, walking in his direction. Holden attempted to move, his mind was pleading to, but his body wouldn't, was instead frozen in its place. Then, the man, looking more ripped then he had back in college, looked in Holden's direction. He looked away, but then he looked back up and saw him, really saw him. And Holden felt like running as fast and far as he could. The man turned the woman, saying something that made her walk toward the rest area beside the lake, and then approached Holden. \"Well hey, Holden, what are you doing here?\" He asked, smiling with his hands in his pockets. Holden looked down, ashamed with himself as he faintly remembered those hands on him right before he had completely blacked out that night, forcing him to move ways he hadn't before. \"Look, why don't we just let what happened in college be behind us? I mean, we all do stupid things back then.\" He suggested, and Holden looked up at him, seeing a form of persuasion in his eyes but not sinking into it. He wanted to punch him, punch him as hard as he could. \"I need to get back to our tent.\" Holden said instead, hurrying past the other man. \"I'll see you around.\" He replied loudly as Holden hurried to get back to the tent, stuffing the risen memories as deeply back into his mind as he could. When he arrived back at their tent, Sean was organizing limbs of varying sizes into a pile, having pulled two large logs from somewhere for them to sit on near the fire; a nice alternative to the ground. Sean looked up at his boyfriend with a bright smile, which immediately contorted into something else less joyful. Holden looked distraught, hidden behind a smile that he had returned Sean. \"Holden, what's wrong?\" He asked, standing straight as the other man walked toward the small pile of limbs. Holden just shook his head absentmindedly, continuing his walk forward until he could grab Sean, doing so tightly, arms entangling the larger man in a tight hug. Sean returned it, not quite sure how to respond to this; Holden hardly ever showed such sporadic bursts of affection. \"You okay?\" He asked, hands running down Holden's back. Holden nodded, taking in a deep breath through his nose. Sean wasn't satisfied, but instead of questioning the behavior further, he rubbed Holden's back softly. \"I love you.\" He whispered softly against Holden's hair, cherishing the serene moment they were sharing. \"I love you too.\" Holden replied, muffled by the fabric of Sean's shirt. \"Let's go eat; it's getting late and we didn't bring any meals with us.\" Sean said, grabbing Holden's hand and heading to where meals were served on the camp grounds. They arrived at the eating area, where grilled chicken, potatoes and vegetables were being served in an outside sitting area. There were a lot of people there, but Sean navigated both of them toward the beginning of the line where everyone was being served. Holden's eyes darted around, nervous as to whether or not his ex would be there. No sign of him, so Holden let his shoulders sag in relief, letting out a breath he hadn't realized that he had been holding. Sean turned toward him at the noise, granting Holden a smile that warmed his heart. They got their food and found a seat for two on a bench at the end of a table, both sitting on the same side. Then, as they were eating, Holden heard a voice over the crowd and looked up. There he was, standing among several other men, laughing cheerfully. It made Holden's heart hurt, and he slumped down a bit, attempting to camouflage himself behind Sean. However, Sean noticed and turned toward him. \"Holden, what's wrong with you? Ever since you went to go get water you've been acting like we're at Camp Crystal Lake and Jason is lurking behind every tree. Whatever it is, just tell me.\" Holden shook his head, taking another bite. \"It's nothing.\" \"Yeah, it is. You know keeping secrets is never healthy.\" Sean persisted, hand going beneath the table to rest on Holden's thigh, gently massaging the skin beneath. Holden melted at the touch, and the words came without him willing them to. \"You know my ex from college?\" Holden asked. \"The one who…\" Sean was already tensing up, his hand now gripping Holden's leg. \"Yeah…he's here.\" Holden said softly, looking Sean directly in the eyes. There was a rage slowly filling them, the kind that Holden rarely saw. This time it was worse, though. \"Sean, don't do anything, okay? It's over now.\" Holden said quickly, reaching out to touch Sean's arm. Sean released his thigh and took a deep breath. \"Where is he?\" He asked after a while, and Holden shook his head. \"I'm not going to tell you; you're just going to do something you'll regret.\" \"Where is he?\" Sean asked again softly, his voice strained, jaw set. \"Promise me you won't do anything?\" Holden finally asked gently. \"Where is he?\" Sean asked for a third time, eyes shifting around the area now, as though he would simply be able to tell by appearance who the man in question was. Holden sighed, knowing he didn't really have a choice at that point. He reached his hand up, shaking, and pointed at him, still laughing with his friends. Sean lurched up from his seat, Holden reaching out to grab his arm but not being swift enough. \"Sean, don't…\" Holden began but then the football player was lurching forward at the man, who turned just in time to see the man upon him. Sean tackled him into the grass outside the eating area, gripping his shirt and punching him hard in the face over and over again. People were gasping, hollering for someone to stop the fight, but Holden could only stare in shock as Sean beat the man over and over in the face. Several people, the ones who had been talking to Holden's ex, attempted to pull Sean off of him, but Sean pulled away from them, punching the man square in the jaw. Then Holden felt his body finally doing what his brain was telling him, and he was darting through the crowd that had gathered. \"Sean, stop!\" He yelled, pulling at Sean's arms that continued to swing, the man attempting to simply block the blows, not strong enough to fight back. Something triggered in Sean's brain and his fists stopped, allowing himself to be pulled from the man by Holden, chest heaving. \"Hope you remember that next time you think about taking advantage of somebody!\" Sean hollered, and Holden was grabbing at Sean's arms again, forcing him through the crowd with all of his strength, the shocked individuals parting for the two. \"Someone get him an ice pack and a medic!\" Holden heard someone order, but he was busy hauling Sean away, back to their tent. Finally, after traveling down the trail in silence, they arrived back at the tent. Holden had let go of Sean on the way there, and sat down on a log, not speaking. Sean found some matches that they had brought along and started the fire, which flickered quickly to life. \"He deserved it.\" Sean said, knowing Holden didn't approve of his actions. \"You beat him within an inch of his life! Sean, what if he presses charges? Everyone knows who you are…\" Holden said, looking up with the most helpless look on his face. Sean softened immediately when their eyes locked, and sat down on the log beside Holden, turning toward him and leaning forward. \"I told you that if anyone ever laid hands on you like that I wouldn't be able to control myself. You know how I am, Holden.\" Holden nodded, resigned. He remembered the times they had gone to bars and he had been hit on by other men, aggressively sometimes by men who wouldn't take no for an answer. Sean had beaten them up badly, but nothing like today. He looked up at Sean, who was looking at him, begging for his understanding. Holden reached up, taking Sean's face in his hands, thumb caressing his cheek, feeling the stubble along his jaw. Sean smiled gently back at him. \"You're a bit over-protective, I hope you know.\" Holden finally said, and Sean chuckled, the deep sound resonating in his chest. \"I love you, Holden; I love you so much that sometimes I just…snap. I blame it on being an only child, but I get pissed when people try to take what's mine.\" \"What, now I'm your property?\" Holden asked, his smile the only thing betraying the joking nature of his question. Sean pulled him forward, off of the log and into his lap, kissing him powerfully. Holden returned it, arms going around Sean's neck tightly. They kissed like that for a long while, and then Sean pulled back. \"How about we take this into the tent?\" He proposed. Holden nodded, tongue suddenly heavy. He always got like this before they had sex. Sean stood, lifting Holden up in his arms. \"I'm not a woman, Sean; I can walk myself.\" Holden said, breaking the heavy air. Sean chuckled, \"What can I say? I'm old-fashioned.\" Holden rolled his eyes but allowed Sean to carry him into the tent before setting him down on the rolled out sleeping bag and blankets. Sean turned, fastening the tent closed, and turned back to Holden. Their hands were everywhere at once, but this wasn't rushed; this time it was slow, gentle. Holden pulled Sean's shirt up, lifting it up over his head, their lips breaking only briefly as both men, on their knees, undressed one another. Sean did the same with Holden's shirt, tossing it aside and then lowering him onto his back on the blankets. Holden's hands found Sean's shorts, undoing his belt and shoving the khaki fabric down hard and fast, the football player kicking the clothing off before working at Holden's belt and then pushing the clothing away as he had his own. They laid there and kissed for a while, hands feeling one another gently, both of them knowing the other's body like it was their own. Holden then pulled at the elastic of Sean's boxers, pushing it down off of his hip bone. Sean smiled against Holden's lips, and allowed the other man to push the final piece of clothing off of his waist and down his thighs, the football player maneuvering them the rest of the way off, releasing his aching need which began rubbing against Holden's inner thigh. Holden then rolled over, willing Sean to pull his boxers down, lifting his hips to make it easier. Finally, the last article of clothing separating the two of them was gone, and Sean ran his hands up Holden's back, feeling every contour of his body, fingers splaying along hard abdominal muscles and against his toned chest. Holden rested his face on his arms, folded on the blankets. Sean leaned completely over him, chest pressed against his back as his hands settled on his hips. He kissed Holden's cheek softly and then his neck, lips traveling along his upper back until he leaned up, on his knees. Holden gasped as Sean wet his fingers in his mouth and then slid one digit, then two, inside of him. \"Sean…\" Holden moaned as the fingers pumped in and out relentlessly, scissoring apart before leaving him. \"Ready?\" Sean asked. \"Need you, Sean.\" Holden replied softly, gripping the sheets. Sean guided his erection toward Holden's entrance with his right hand, his left resting against Holden's lower back. Holden spread his legs wider to accommodate his boyfriend, and then the head was pressing against him. He relaxed his muscles and allowed Sean to breach him in the most personal way, sliding inch by inch into the smaller man. Sean groaned as he sheathed himself completely within Holden, who pushed his hips back, willing him to move. Sean began a steady rhythm, Holden meeting his thrusts with moans. Both men were as one, moving against one another at a steady pace. Holden gripped the sheets tightly, not wanting to speed up their lovemaking, his body pulsing with pleasure. Sean leaned over him now, chest once again pressed to Holden's back, sweat now covering both of them as they continued their pace without faltering. \"Love you so much…\" Sean whispered, kissing along Holden's cheek and neck, panting as he did. \"Sean…love you…too…\" Holden gasped, turning and capturing Sean's lips in his. Then, Sean was back on his knees, thrusting deep into Holden, stomach tightening, building the intense heat that threatened to overwhelm him. Holden felt it too with each push inward, Sean diving deep inside of him and triggering every fiber of pleasure that his body held. Their orgasms hit simultaneously, Holden moaning Sean's name loudly, guttural noise filling the tent and reverberating off of the trees around them. Sean groaned loud, a softer noise but still loud as Holden's walls contracted around his erection with each thrust, pulling him in deeper. Finally, Sean felt his orgasm fading, pulling out and letting himself lye against Holden back once more, the other male collapsed completely flat on the blankets. \"You okay?\" Sean asked, hoping he hadn't hurt Holden too badly from their lack of preparation. Holden nodded sleepily, and Sean rolled off of him, lying on the blankets beside the other man. Holden turned and curled himself against Sean's side as the football player grabbed several blankets and pulled them over their bodies. Sean then turned and tangled himself into Holden, arms going under the other man's, legs intertwining, one face buried in hair, the other in chest. They both drifted to sleep quickly, their breathing practically in sink as the two men rested in one another's arms.","LastChapter":"Forgiveness and Love By: KellyCRocker59 Wow, this went in a completely different direction then I was expecting it to. I hope it is enjoyable and everything is solid; I just really wanted to do a camping story so here you go! Please review; I thrive on them. Holden was not the camping type. He didn't enjoy it, and while he wasn't hateful toward those that made it a regular hobby, simply couldn't fathom how anyone could feel differently. And yet here he was, camping with his boyfriend. Sean, of course, loved doing such a manly activity, and had practically begged Holden to go with him on their third year anniversary. Sean was currently setting up their tent, which was set deep in the forest, away from any other campers. Not that either of them cared anymore, considering that everyone on the planet knew about Sean. It was just a matter of privacy. Finally, their tent was finished, and Holden transferred their belongings into it. \"You should really wear a t-shirt and shorts more often.\" Sean commented, and Holden felt his hand run along his hip and down the side of his khaki shorts as he was leaning over his bag to remove the sleeping bags. \"It makes me feel awkward.\" Holden grumbled, blushing despite himself at the other man's affection. \"Maybe you would be more comfortable without them on?\" Sean asked, turning Holden around and toying now with the hem of his shirt, tugging gently at it. \"Not in the middle of the day; people are awake. I don't want anyone overhearing.\" Holden explained, leaning up to place a kiss on Sean's lips. \"Yeah, you do get pretty loud,\" Sean replied with a big smile, chasing Holden's lips, hands resting firmly on his boyfriend's hips, keeping him in place. Holden wrapped his arms around Sean's neck, pulling him down further, attempting to be completely enveloped by the man in front of him, the familiar smell of musk and fresh pine trees intoxicating his senses as Sean's hands pulled insistently at his shirt, but instead simply running up under the back of it and along Holden's skin. Holden tangled his fingers in Sean's hair, kissing him deeply for a moment longer before pulling back and burying his face in Sean's chest, the muscles flexing beneath his cheek. Sean rested his hands around Holden's lower back, kissing his neck. \"I don't even know why we brought two sleeping bags; it's not like we're going to be using more then one.\" Sean said against Holden's hair, resting his chin there. \"We probably need to get to gathering supplies before the sun goes down; I heard it's supposed to get really cold.\" Holden said, ignoring the comment verbally but unable to stop that blush from tinting his cheeks at what Sean had said. \"Yeah, you're right.\" Sean replied, pulling back but still holding onto Holden's hand, leading him out of the tent. Holden had volunteered to get firewood, but Sean was too worried about the risk of him getting injured dealing with heavy branches to allow that, so instead Holden was assigned the task of filling several pales with water from the nearby lake; Sean wanted the full effect of this trip. He traveled down a narrow trail that led to the lake, which was populated by various other campers. Holden bent over the water, filling the first, and then the second, with water. He stood, going to leave back for their tent, when he almost dropped the pales from his hands in surprise. There, walking alongside a young woman was his ex-boyfriend from college. The memories hit him like a wave, flooding his mind in a blur of pieces. The boyfriend whom he had thought he may love. The boyfriend who had been hard up for money. The boyfriend who had taken money from a friend in exchange for slipping drugs into Holden's drink. The boyfriend who had given an unconscious Holden to his friend so that he could be raped. The boyfriend who had helped violate him in a way he couldn't forget. And here he was, walking in his direction. Holden attempted to move, his mind was pleading to, but his body wouldn't, was instead frozen in its place. Then, the man, looking more ripped then he had back in college, looked in Holden's direction. He looked away, but then he looked back up and saw him, really saw him. And Holden felt like running as fast and far as he could. The man turned the woman, saying something that made her walk toward the rest area beside the lake, and then approached Holden. \"Well hey, Holden, what are you doing here?\" He asked, smiling with his hands in his pockets. Holden looked down, ashamed with himself as he faintly remembered those hands on him right before he had completely blacked out that night, forcing him to move ways he hadn't before. \"Look, why don't we just let what happened in college be behind us? I mean, we all do stupid things back then.\" He suggested, and Holden looked up at him, seeing a form of persuasion in his eyes but not sinking into it. He wanted to punch him, punch him as hard as he could. \"I need to get back to our tent.\" Holden said instead, hurrying past the other man. \"I'll see you around.\" He replied loudly as Holden hurried to get back to the tent, stuffing the risen memories as deeply back into his mind as he could. When he arrived back at their tent, Sean was organizing limbs of varying sizes into a pile, having pulled two large logs from somewhere for them to sit on near the fire; a nice alternative to the ground. Sean looked up at his boyfriend with a bright smile, which immediately contorted into something else less joyful. Holden looked distraught, hidden behind a smile that he had returned Sean. \"Holden, what's wrong?\" He asked, standing straight as the other man walked toward the small pile of limbs. Holden just shook his head absentmindedly, continuing his walk forward until he could grab Sean, doing so tightly, arms entangling the larger man in a tight hug. Sean returned it, not quite sure how to respond to this; Holden hardly ever showed such sporadic bursts of affection. \"You okay?\" He asked, hands running down Holden's back. Holden nodded, taking in a deep breath through his nose. Sean wasn't satisfied, but instead of questioning the behavior further, he rubbed Holden's back softly. \"I love you.\" He whispered softly against Holden's hair, cherishing the serene moment they were sharing. \"I love you too.\" Holden replied, muffled by the fabric of Sean's shirt. \"Let's go eat; it's getting late and we didn't bring any meals with us.\" Sean said, grabbing Holden's hand and heading to where meals were served on the camp grounds. They arrived at the eating area, where grilled chicken, potatoes and vegetables were being served in an outside sitting area. There were a lot of people there, but Sean navigated both of them toward the beginning of the line where everyone was being served. Holden's eyes darted around, nervous as to whether or not his ex would be there. No sign of him, so Holden let his shoulders sag in relief, letting out a breath he hadn't realized that he had been holding. Sean turned toward him at the noise, granting Holden a smile that warmed his heart. They got their food and found a seat for two on a bench at the end of a table, both sitting on the same side. Then, as they were eating, Holden heard a voice over the crowd and looked up. There he was, standing among several other men, laughing cheerfully. It made Holden's heart hurt, and he slumped down a bit, attempting to camouflage himself behind Sean. However, Sean noticed and turned toward him. \"Holden, what's wrong with you? Ever since you went to go get water you've been acting like we're at Camp Crystal Lake and Jason is lurking behind every tree. Whatever it is, just tell me.\" Holden shook his head, taking another bite. \"It's nothing.\" \"Yeah, it is. You know keeping secrets is never healthy.\" Sean persisted, hand going beneath the table to rest on Holden's thigh, gently massaging the skin beneath. Holden melted at the touch, and the words came without him willing them to. \"You know my ex from college?\" Holden asked. \"The one who…\" Sean was already tensing up, his hand now gripping Holden's leg. \"Yeah…he's here.\" Holden said softly, looking Sean directly in the eyes. There was a rage slowly filling them, the kind that Holden rarely saw. This time it was worse, though. \"Sean, don't do anything, okay? It's over now.\" Holden said quickly, reaching out to touch Sean's arm. Sean released his thigh and took a deep breath. \"Where is he?\" He asked after a while, and Holden shook his head. \"I'm not going to tell you; you're just going to do something you'll regret.\" \"Where is he?\" Sean asked again softly, his voice strained, jaw set. \"Promise me you won't do anything?\" Holden finally asked gently. \"Where is he?\" Sean asked for a third time, eyes shifting around the area now, as though he would simply be able to tell by appearance who the man in question was. Holden sighed, knowing he didn't really have a choice at that point. He reached his hand up, shaking, and pointed at him, still laughing with his friends. Sean lurched up from his seat, Holden reaching out to grab his arm but not being swift enough. \"Sean, don't…\" Holden began but then the football player was lurching forward at the man, who turned just in time to see the man upon him. Sean tackled him into the grass outside the eating area, gripping his shirt and punching him hard in the face over and over again. People were gasping, hollering for someone to stop the fight, but Holden could only stare in shock as Sean beat the man over and over in the face. Several people, the ones who had been talking to Holden's ex, attempted to pull Sean off of him, but Sean pulled away from them, punching the man square in the jaw. Then Holden felt his body finally doing what his brain was telling him, and he was darting through the crowd that had gathered. \"Sean, stop!\" He yelled, pulling at Sean's arms that continued to swing, the man attempting to simply block the blows, not strong enough to fight back. Something triggered in Sean's brain and his fists stopped, allowing himself to be pulled from the man by Holden, chest heaving. \"Hope you remember that next time you think about taking advantage of somebody!\" Sean hollered, and Holden was grabbing at Sean's arms again, forcing him through the crowd with all of his strength, the shocked individuals parting for the two. \"Someone get him an ice pack and a medic!\" Holden heard someone order, but he was busy hauling Sean away, back to their tent. Finally, after traveling down the trail in silence, they arrived back at the tent. Holden had let go of Sean on the way there, and sat down on a log, not speaking. Sean found some matches that they had brought along and started the fire, which flickered quickly to life. \"He deserved it.\" Sean said, knowing Holden didn't approve of his actions. \"You beat him within an inch of his life! Sean, what if he presses charges? Everyone knows who you are…\" Holden said, looking up with the most helpless look on his face. Sean softened immediately when their eyes locked, and sat down on the log beside Holden, turning toward him and leaning forward. \"I told you that if anyone ever laid hands on you like that I wouldn't be able to control myself. You know how I am, Holden.\" Holden nodded, resigned. He remembered the times they had gone to bars and he had been hit on by other men, aggressively sometimes by men who wouldn't take no for an answer. Sean had beaten them up badly, but nothing like today. He looked up at Sean, who was looking at him, begging for his understanding. Holden reached up, taking Sean's face in his hands, thumb caressing his cheek, feeling the stubble along his jaw. Sean smiled gently back at him. \"You're a bit over-protective, I hope you know.\" Holden finally said, and Sean chuckled, the deep sound resonating in his chest. \"I love you, Holden; I love you so much that sometimes I just…snap. I blame it on being an only child, but I get pissed when people try to take what's mine.\" \"What, now I'm your property?\" Holden asked, his smile the only thing betraying the joking nature of his question. Sean pulled him forward, off of the log and into his lap, kissing him powerfully. Holden returned it, arms going around Sean's neck tightly. They kissed like that for a long while, and then Sean pulled back. \"How about we take this into the tent?\" He proposed. Holden nodded, tongue suddenly heavy. He always got like this before they had sex. Sean stood, lifting Holden up in his arms. \"I'm not a woman, Sean; I can walk myself.\" Holden said, breaking the heavy air. Sean chuckled, \"What can I say? I'm old-fashioned.\" Holden rolled his eyes but allowed Sean to carry him into the tent before setting him down on the rolled out sleeping bag and blankets. Sean turned, fastening the tent closed, and turned back to Holden. Their hands were everywhere at once, but this wasn't rushed; this time it was slow, gentle.

Please, please, PLEASE review! I opened the oven as the timer sounded, pulling the pan of rolls, golden brown, free from the confines of the hot machine. I set them on a towel on the counter, looking around for anything else that I could assist my busy mother with. I settled on throwing away the wrappers and packages that betrayed the supposed 'home-made' trait of the food being made. \"Do you need help with anything?\" I turned to find my brother, dressed in a plain t-shirt and jeans, looking incredibly awkward. \"No I'm good; lord, Holden, could you at least fake a smile?\" He attempted one, and I chuckled, hurrying over to move the green bean casserole into the oven. \"Shouldn't you be taking care of your boyfriend?\" \"He's discussing football with Uncle Jack and Trey.\" I turned to him as I sensed the uneasiness in his tone, and walked toward him, getting close. \"What is your problem? Mom and Dad have been more then accepting ever since you told them…\" \"Yeah but…\" He looked down at the ground, turning a bit red, \"I've never brought anyone home before. Thanksgiving, that's a big deal. Like rest of our lives big deal.\" \"Well I'm sure Mom will be happy to hear that. You're supposed to be in love, Holden! Start acting like it.\" I turned before I could catch his expression, beginning the washing process on the dishes that had already been dirtied. It was then that I heard my mother's voice from the living room. \"Oh Sean, come here! You have to see these adorable pictures of Holden!\" \"Mom, come on!\" Holden exclaimed, and I heard his footsteps rapidly leaving the kitchen. I finished the dishes, and then joined everyone in the living; the oven was busy cooking the remainder of the food for dinner, so Mom and I had plenty of time to congregate with all of our relatives. I leaned against the wall and bit my lip, trying to keep from laughing as Holden scrambled to retrieve any baby pictures that he did not approve of from the coffee table before Sean could see them. I eyed Sean Jackson for the first time in the way that I would a normal person. He was tall and built, dressed in a similarly plain t-shirt as Holden as well as dark faded jeans. He looked like he had walked off the set of a romantic comedy. I found it ironic, considering that I had always been jealous of Holden for his extremely attractive features; it only made sense that he would end up with someone like Sean. Mom continued to lay out pictures at a rapid rate, handing Sean photo albums as well as the three sat on the couch. Uncle Jack seemed as amused as I was, Uncle Trey, my husband Mark, and Dad looking occasionally from the television to the trio. All of the women were gathered around the television as well, instead gossiping about various social events they had recently attended. And so was the life of a wealthy family in LA. I continued to watch the trio on the couch, who were by far the most entertaining aspect of the evening. Sean grinned brightly at one picture as Holden seemed to lecture Mom about not bringing the baby pictures out ever again . \"You look adorable in this one.\" Sean said, touching Holden's arm. Holden immediately stopped talking and turned toward him, looking at the picture in his hands. \"That was from Holden's sixth birthday party. Remember Chelsea, Holden? She was in love with you!\" Mom was pointing to someone in the picture, and I recalled the image. Holden stood with a massive smile in front of his cake, with Chelsea Wren trying to grab him in a hug. \"Really?\" Sean asked, intrigued and turning toward Mom. \"Well Holden would have no part of it, of course. He was always uncomfortable when girls got handsy with him.\" \"Mom, please…\" Holden began. \"Oh no, I was the same way. I flirted with girls for popularity's sake in school, but when they tried to get all up on me, I got nervous and flustered.\" Sean empathized. \"Uncle Holden, who is he?\" Everyone, even the men at the television, turned toward little Rose, my five year old daughter who had been sitting in front of the television listening nonchalantly to the women's conversation until she had gotten bored and decided to head in our direction. While everyone was fine with the way Holden was, the topic as to Holden and Sean had yet to be discussed during the evening. \"Rose, that's a rude question.\" I chided, walking forward to grab her. \"Well, I'm Sean; I'm Uncle Holden's boyfriend.\" Sean said, leaning down closer to Rose. \"Boyfriend? But Uncle Holden, aren't you a boy?\" Rose asked, looking curiously over at Holden. \"Yeah, I am Rose.\" Holden said, blushing dark red now. \"You see, Rose, most of the time boys like girls. But there are some boys who think girls are nasty, and they fall in love with other boys.\" Sean explained. \"Really?\" Rose asked, incredulous. \"Yeah!\" Sean replied excitedly. Rose just sort of looked at Sean, and then turned to Holden. \"Is Sean going to be my uncle too?\" \"You know, Rose, I'm pretty sure he is.\" Holden said, smiling at her. She nodded. \"Good; I like Sean. He's cute!\" \"Well thank you, Rose!\" Sean replied, grinning wide. She nodded, and then trotted over to me. \"Are we going to eat soon?\" I nodded, looking at Holden and Sean. Their hands had found one another's, intertwined as they flipped from Holden-approved photo albums with Mom. I smiled, and then looked back down at Rose, who still stood there, looking at me curiously. \"What is it, honey?\" I asked, leaning down. \"Well…I want a cousin to play with, but I don't want to ask Uncle Holden and Sean for one.\" I bit back a chuckle, running a hand through her brunette hair as I leaned down closer. \"That's probably a good idea; I'm not sure they're ready for that yet.\" Rose nodded. \"I didn't think so.\" We ate, getting compliments from everyone on the quality of the food. Then, we all prepared for the annual watching of Say Anything . It was our favorite movie as kids, and somehow became a tradition. Everyone got comfortable on a certain piece of furniture; Mark grabbed us the love seat, and I leaned against him contently with Rose cuddled against me. This gave me a perfect view of Holden and Sean, who had been left with the wide recliner, which they barely both fit in. Holden was practically in Sean's lap, and they both laughed, trying to keep it quiet but failing. Then, Holden leaned in, catching Sean's lips in his. It was quick, a simple peck, but even in the dark, as Dad prepared the film, I could see the expression in Sean's eyes shift. He chased after Holden's lips, catching them again. This time it was much more passionate as Holden's returned the kiss, and then after a lengthier, but still brief, moment, they parted, and Holden settled into Sean's arms, which wound around his stomach comfortably. I turned back to the television, leaving the two to each other. I smiled to myself, massaging Rose's head gently and placing a kiss on Mark's arm, wrapped around my shoulders. I would have never dreamed the night Holden had confessed that he was gay, that we would both be sitting at this Thanksgiving, content with our lives. I was happy for myself, but even happier for my brother. He deserved someone to lift him up, to make him happy, more then anyone.","LastChapter":"Lift Me Up By: KellyCRocker59 I just felt like doing a fluff piece out of nowhere; I hope this is good!

But Uncle Holden, aren't you a boy?\" Rose asked, looking curiously over at Holden. \"Yeah, I am Rose.\" Holden said, blushing dark red now. \"You see, Rose, most of the time boys like girls. But there are some boys who think girls are nasty, and they fall in love with other boys.\" Sean explained. \"Really?\" Rose asked, incredulous. \"Yeah!\" Sean replied excitedly. Rose just sort of looked at Sean, and then turned to Holden. \"Is Sean going to be my uncle too?\" \"You know, Rose, I'm pretty sure he is.\" Holden said, smiling at her. She nodded. \"Good; I like Sean. He's cute!\" \"Well thank you, Rose!\" Sean replied, grinning wide. She nodded, and then trotted over to me. \"Are we going to eat soon?\" I nodded, looking at Holden and Sean. Their hands had found one another's, intertwined as they flipped from Holden-approved photo albums with Mom. I smiled, and then looked back down at Rose, who still stood there, looking at me curiously. \"What is it, honey?\" I asked, leaning down. \"Well…I want a cousin to play with, but I don't want to ask Uncle Holden and Sean for one.\" I bit back a chuckle, running a hand through her brunette hair as I leaned down closer. \"That's probably a good idea; I'm not sure they're ready for that yet.\" Rose nodded. \"I didn't think so.\" We ate, getting compliments from everyone on the quality of the food. Then, we all prepared for the annual watching of Say Anything . It was our favorite movie as kids, and somehow became a tradition. Everyone got comfortable on a certain piece of furniture; Mark grabbed us the love seat, and I leaned against him contently with Rose cuddled against me. This gave me a perfect view of Holden and Sean, who had been left with the wide recliner, which they barely both fit in. Holden was practically in Sean's lap, and they both laughed, trying to keep it quiet but failing. Then, Holden leaned in, catching Sean's lips in his. It was quick, a simple peck, but even in the dark, as Dad prepared the film, I could see the expression in Sean's eyes shift. He chased after Holden's lips, catching them again. This time it was much more passionate as Holden's returned the kiss, and then after a lengthier, but still brief, moment, they parted, and Holden settled into Sean's arms, which wound around his stomach comfortably. I turned back to the television, leaving the two to each other. I smiled to myself, massaging Rose's head gently and placing a kiss on Mark's arm, wrapped around my shoulders. I would have never dreamed the night Holden had confessed that he was gay, that we would both be sitting at this Thanksgiving, content with our lives. I was happy for myself, but even happier for my brother. He deserved someone to lift him up, to make him happy, more then anyone.","Summary":" Lift Me Up By: KellyCRocker59 I just felt like doing a fluff piece out of nowhere; I hope this is g","MetaData":"Rated: Fiction  K - English - Romance Family -  Sean J., Holden W.  - Words: 1,345 - Reviews: 8 - Favs: 38 - Follows: 5 - Published: 7 30 2010 - Status: Complete - id: 6192420 "},{"Movie":"Valentine's Day, 2010","Title":"It must have been the way","Author":"letscall-l","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5799328","Passage":"[Chapter 1] Title : It must have been the way.

Felicia likes to think its deeper than that, has more meaning, more of a story to it; like the Lady she met in the elevator on Valentine's day, who used to visit Dr Coleman every week at his apartment. She didn't live there and didn't seem too impressed at Felicia's white bear, but whatever she was kinda mysterious and Felicia likes those kind of stories. And while the way she found out that Willy liked her was cute and awesome, the things she found out after just made everything seem a little more perfect. Like how they both like exercise and strawberry milkshakes, but they can never decide on a single flavour of ice cream. Or how she knows when he wants her to move closer when his knee starts to shake, and how he knows she wants to kiss him when she touches his elbow, lightly. Coincidentally they both have the same middle name, which Felicia loves- but would probably love more if it wasn't a stereotypical 'guys' name. But Willy doesn't seem to mind, and most of the time when he calls her 'Taylor' its when they're sitting close and no one can hear them. Its like they're speaking in their own secret language. Except its just a name, and anyone who reads her driving license can figure out the code. Sometimes she wonders how she got so lucky, but then she realizes she doesn't want to know. It always ruins the story. ---- Will thinks it wouldn't have started to bother him as much if Alex had lost his virginity on Valentine's day, like he'd planned, and stopped obsessing over it. He kinda hates how being surrounded by his best friend's ever present, bordering desperate, sexual frustration did nothing to quell his own rising anxiety for his own lack of experience. He didn't lie to Felicia, he's not ready. He just wishes Alex would stop reminding him about how un-ready he actually is. \"- and then her mom, I just couldn't shut up, it was like...\" Will snaps back to catch the end of Alex's explanation of how he-didn't-have-sex-with-Grace-on-V-Day story. \"I don't think I'll ever be able to go around there again. Shit.\" Will just nods in agreement. He's trying not to listen to him to carefully; one, because the last thing he needs is to imagine Alex running around naked with nothing but a guitar covering him and two; he doesn't have track for another two hours, or Felicia for three so there's nothing to take his mind off previously mentioned image until then. Sometimes Will hates what being a guy entails for conversation. \"I don't know man, she's going to Yale soon and I'm ready I know I am-\" Alex wrings is hands like its the only way he can express his annoyance. Will snaps. \"D'yeh ever stop to seriously think if Grace is? Maybe you mean more to her than just sex.\" He turns to Alex, who looks slightly shocked at his sudden turn around, and stares him down with his advice. \"Woah, chill, I was just venting. Its not like I'm mad at her or anything.\" \"Maybe you should just think about it, you love her - emphasis on her, not sex.\" Its about love for him, its all about making Felicia happy, being happy with her and not wondering about how to be more than happy. \"Its alright for you, I'm so sorry you have to listen to me talk about it yeah? But I can't exactly tell Grace this...in so many words anyway.\" Alex shrugs him off with a grimace. He pulls his bag straps up on his shoulders. \"What do you mean its alright for me?\" Will questions, not liking the tone in Alex's voice. \"You and Felicia, dude.\" \"What about us? The talking? I know its not cool or whatever but if you can talk to Grace about an-\" Sometimes Will wonders why he has to suggest almost everything to Alex, he feels like a third wheel in their relationship. \"No, no, not the talking. I meant the sex.\" Will has to actually stop. And in terms of stopping, he swiftly angles himself and Alex next to the vending machines - now empty after the last latte strike- to see if Alex actually just said what he said. \"What are you talking about?\" \"Man, you're like over at her parent's apartment every weekend and you come to school on monday with this big ass grin on your face.\" Alex, as he relays this to Will, seems grow more confused over Will's sudden defensiveness. Will listens, and with some disbelief tries not to wonder why Alex ever thought that him staying with Felicia was ever more than a date night, and why his best friend would even imagine- \"We go out on Fridays, you know this.\" Felicia is across the green. Her blonde hair waves in the light breeze and Will really wants to leave this conversation and see her. But Alex's betrayed looking expression isn't letting him escape. \"You haven't had sex with her?\" Alex states it as a question but there's a smugness that Will knows Alex interjects to place them in the same boat again. Will feels like he's lost a respect he was never aware he had. \"No.\" \"Are you serious? You've never-?\" \"No dude, we're not ready.\" Will's hands clench and teeth grit. He's not liking where this is headed. \"That, that, dude. All this freaking time- She's like so into you y'know.\" Will knows, Will knows how much Felicia loves him - he sees it in everything she does; in her eyes, her walk, everytime she smiles, and in every kiss. \"I'm into her too, I love her.\" \"Then why haven't-\" \"I'm not having this conversation with you.\" Will silences Alex to no avail. \"I'm your best friend, why not?\" \"Because if you can't understand your own problems or issues or whatever, then me explaining my feelings towards 'Liss is pointless.\" Will is really forcing himself to keep his voice down, his neck feels strained and Alex's ignorance just doesn't seem to abate. \"We don't have problems, I love her.\" \"Then talk to her about this, and maybe you'll see that she's scared that once you've 'sealed the deal' you'll be off to Stanford and that'll be the end of it, and it won't mean anything.\" \"I wouldn't do that, she knows-\" \"Does she?\" Will isn't looking at his distraught face. He's staring over his shoulder to his girl's bemused expression as she spots him. He's leaving now whether Alex works out what he's doing wrong or not. \"Just sort it out Alex.\" He manages to brush his shoulder against his friend and raise a hand to Felicia when Alex hesitantly calls out again. \"Why didn't you tell me you hadn't?\" Alex meekly asks, keeping his voice quiet and Will shrugs. \"I don't know.\" His eyes flicker to Felicia and back. \"I didn't really want to be apart of the rest of the guy's plans. Its gotta be personal, for the right reasons...\" Will stuffs his hands into his pockets and scuffs his shoe on the ground. \"...with the right person.\" Alex doesn't give much of a reply because Will has already nodded his way out and began a light jog to see his girlfriend. All the weird negativity that telling Alex had brought vanishes when he lifts Felicia off the ground, spinning her with his arms around his waist in that cliche movie way she secretly adored. When her arms are wrapped around his waist everything is just so right. ---- \"Will?\" Its the first thing she's said in a while. They're curled up in her bed. His bare feet brush against her shins because she's still a little taller than him, but she doesn't mind. \"What's wrong?\" His concerned voice almost immediately replies. She pauses to wonder if anything is actually wrong, apart from her bedside clock almost hitting 11 o'clock, the time when her parents will knock gently and offer Will the guest room, she doesn't think anything is really...wrong. \"Nothing, nothings wrong why?\" Felicia moves back slightly so she can see his face. He has worry lines, but he doesn't need to know that. \"You've never...its the first time you've called me just Will.\" He states and Felicia thinks its strange that it actually is the first time. She's always called him Willy, ever since she started turning round to yell at him for spitting spitballs at her; overemphasizing names was kind of natural to her. \"I know, I'm being serious, you don't think I can be serious?\" Felicia scrunches her nose. She's well aware that sometimes people need to be serious, and usually that person wouldn't be her but around Will, with him; sometimes she needs to be. Just so he knows that she's not constantly a crazed love-struck girl around him, all the time. Despite the fact most of L.A. thinks she is, thanks to that Reporter that came to their school on Valentine's day, when every-one knew she was bound to be insanely happy. It was an unfair perspective. \"Yeah, I know you can but...you sound pretty...\" He stops, as if he's unsure of how to phrase it. Felicia decides to jump in. \"Did it bother you?\" \"What?\" He asks. \"Did it bother you when I said I wanted to wait, before we y'know - sleep together?\" She bites her lip nervously as she says this, partly because she doesn't want her parents to walk in at the very moment she starts this conversation, and partly because Will is a boy, and maybe she was being too assuming. \"...because I know sometimes I say things without really thinking about what you might feel or think or want to say and I know I shouldn't but sometimes you don't seem to mind when I do and-\" \"I didn't mind.\" Will manages to interrupt her monologue before she can go off on another tangent. He didn't mind. \"You didn't?\" Felicia has to admit she's slightly taken aback. She's not exactly an expert in all things to do with boy's overactive sexual needs, she's not an expert with boys in general actually but she thinks she's got love locked down pretty well; but she's sure that boys are usually supposed to care about sex. \"No.\" He stutters. \"I know that you want to wait and I respect that; and I...I don't think, in all seriousness, that I'm ready either.\" Her hand is pressed against his chest as she says this and she feels a huge breath leave his chest as he admits it to her. Its a rush of his relief. \"You're not?\" Will copies her earlier motion and scrunches his nose. Felicia is entranced by the dip between his forehead and his brow. \"Its weird isn't it?\" \"No, no, I just thought that with all the obsessing with Alex and Grace being on a major sex goal that you would...I'm sorry.\" She feels bad for mentioning it. Will isn't Alex and she isn't Grace. And their not going to different colleges next year, they have time, they have more love. Felicia doesn't like accusing or demeaning Alex and Grace's love for each other, but the sex question had been hanging over their heads for too long, and some part of Felicia worries that her best friends have lost sight of what they really wanted in the first place. Each other. Will's arms pull her close again as if he's thinking the same thing and keeping her near is helping him think things a bit clearer. \"Its alright.\" He murmurs into her hair. \"Its been strange to hear them talk hasn't it?\" His jokes make things better, they always do. \"Its like they're gonna die if they don't do it or something!\" Felicia scoffs in good nature, because for all she knows Grace and Alex are dying. Dying of sexual tension. \"So much pent up energy.\" Will sighs sympathetically but she can hear his sarcasm. \"He should do sit ups.\" Felicia offers, her mind immediately wanders to Will's own exercise routines and helping him warm up for track. Subconsciously her body shifts closer to him, her long legs tangle between his knees and heat the back of his calves. The muscles there tense but slowly relax. \"Thats what I said.\" Will's voice is level and Felicia can tell that his mind is wandering away from their friends, and back to them. \"Are you still sure?\" She probes again. Her eyes meet his with a wavering love in the hope that he'll be honest, truthful with her, because its okay if he wants to; she'll be ready as soon as he is. \"Totally sure, I'm not ready.\" Will's lips hover by her own and his presence makes her breathless. His words make her happy, make her feel special. Her hands come up to thread in his short black hair, he smiles at her touch. \"...I totally love you.\" Felicia whispers, knowing he can hear her perfectly. \"And I'm crazy about you.\" Felicia kisses him because she's ready for that. fin","LastChapter":"Title : It must have been the way.

He's sitting at his desk. He rubs his temples with his thumbs, trying to alleviate the stress that he's allowed to manifest inside of him. He realizes that no amount of self-massaging is going to make any difference, so he stands and goes into the kitchen. He brews a cup of coffee beneath the modest light of the counter. It's too early in the morning for this, even for him, a self-declared morning person. He pours enough vanilla CoffeeMate in the cup to change it to the honey tinge that he enjoys, and he sits down at the dining room table now, sipping it. He looks out across the beach. It's at that time of the morning when it's technically morning, but the moon would say otherwise, glimmering in the sky. He sighs, setting his head down on the table. Normally, he's ready for training season. Usually, he jumps at the chance to be back around his teammates, the guys that really get him because they get the sport. But he doesn't feel prepared. Paula is breathing down his neck about publicity, about getting his name out there for MVP consideration. But that's not him, and he realizes it in the non-night, not-quite morning, because he'll be damned if he has an epiphany at a convenient time. He just wants to play football. But it isn't that easy, not when you go pro, and certainly not when you're actually good at it. He hates that this is his life now. He briefly considers if firing Paula would provide a solution, but he sighs and takes another sip of his coffee. It will only put her out of work and mean more hours wasted searching for an agent who would invariably be worse at their job. Paula's crazy, but necessary. So how did he go about playing football but staying out of the public spotlight? How did he just do his job and then go home? \"Hey, cutie. What are you doing awake at the Devil's Hour?\" He looks up, stunned out of his inner turmoil. Holden, the man he had been sharing his bed with for the past month and a half, is standing there at the other end of the dining room table, rubbing his eyes. He's cast in the soft glow of the kitchen light that Sean had forgotten to turn off, and he's dressed in one of Sean's old college hoodies. It wipes away every train of thought that had been bustling through Sean's mind. Holden walks closer, around the side of the dining room table until he's standing beside Sean awkwardly. \"I…couldn't sleep.\" Sean replies, focusing down on his mug, because there's something in the air, something that's filling his chest and he doesn't understand what it is. \"Well, I would ask you to come back to bed, but there's no way you're getting any sleep after downing a cup of coffee. So…\" Holden trails off, and then he pulls the chair beside Sean out from under the table and plops down. \"What are you doing?\" Sean asks, raising an eyebrow as Holden adjusts comfortably in the seat. \"We're going to talk about what's keeping you up at night. And I know it's not the sex, because that should have you so wiped out you can't wake up, not the other way around.\" \"You don't have to do this.\" Sean mumbles, fumbling with his mug, empty now. \"Do what?\" Holden asks, grabbing the mug from Sean and trying to hold his gaze. \"I don't know, listen and… care , I guess.\" He replies. Holden sighs. \"We're dating, aren't we Sean?\" \"I mean, yeah I've taken you out to dinner and I call you and we hang out here and we…well, we have sex so…\" \"So yes, by the dysfunctional way forced upon us by your occupation, we are dating. So that means I'm not sticking around for the sex. I'm sticking around for you. Because I care about you. Why are you acting like this? It's very out of character, Mr. Macho.\" Sean shrugs. \"I guess I just don't want to weigh you down with my problems.\" Holden sighs, and now he grabs Sean's hand, running his thumb over the back of it. Sean looks at him, into his eyes, and he realizes he can get lost in them, in their warmth. \"That's what you're allowed to do when you're with someone, Sean. It's what you're supposed to do.\" He nods, because of course Holden's right. He doesn't know what it is about now that has him so unfocused. He's normally perfectly fine around Holden, normally in charge of the situation, even. He eyes his hoody, hanging off of Holden's body. That may have something to do with it. He licks his lips, and Holden swallows. \"So…are we talking about this, or what?\" Holden prompts. So Sean talks about it. All of it. The stress, the frustration, the indecision: all of it that comes with his job. And Holden listens. When he's done, Holden sits there and just studies him. Finally, just as Sean is becoming unnerved, he speaks. \"You're going through an identity crisis.\" \"What do you mean?\" Sean questions. It isn't the answer he expects. \"You've always wanted to keep things private. You've always wanted to play football, or at least I'm assuming since you were old enough to care about your future. It's just that now you're starting to realize that you can't have it both ways, and that's bothering you.\" Sean nods. Yeah, that sounds about right. \"There's something that happened in your life that caused it, I'm sure…\" Sean studies Holden's hand in his, their fingers wound through one another's. He swallows the lump in his throat. \"…but it doesn't really matter what that is. What matters is that you figure out what you care about more: your privacy, or football?\" Sean shakes his head. \"I guess that's what I'm having trouble with.\" Holden nods. \"I understand. It'll take some time to figure out, but you'll figure it out, I'm sure. The good thing is that the media doesn't seem to pry too much into anyone's personal life until they think the person has something to hide.\" Holden falters as that last sentence ends, and Sean realizes why. He realizes that Holden is thinking of himself. But Sean squeezes his hand, and Holden is smiling at him again. \"Let's go back to bed.\" \"You sure? I mean, I can stay and talk for hours.\" Holden replies. It makes Sean smile. \"Yeah, I'm sure. I'm tired.\" They head back upstairs to Sean's bedroom, and Holden removes himself from Sean's hoody before they tangle together in the sheets. \"Hey, babe?\" Sean begins. \"Yeah?\" Holden asks, rolling over to face him. \"Thanks for that.\" He says. Holden smiles, and it's outlined perfectly in the moonlight, shimmering dimly into the bedroom. \"Anytime, hot stuff.\" He presses a quick kiss to Sean's lips before rolling back over. Sean feels an explosion of energy inside his chest, and then he wraps an arm back around Holden, pressing the other man's back to his chest. Flashes of years down the road in this same position dance behind Sean's eyes before he falls asleep.","LastChapter":"Lifetime By: KellyCRocker59 A/N: I'm still focusing most of my efforts on 'You Get Me Through', my 90210 Teddy/Ian story, but this hit me the other night and I had to write it. He's sitting at his desk. He rubs his temples with his thumbs, trying to alleviate the stress that he's allowed to manifest inside of him. He realizes that no amount of self-massaging is going to make any difference, so he stands and goes into the kitchen. He brews a cup of coffee beneath the modest light of the counter. It's too early in the morning for this, even for him, a self-declared morning person. He pours enough vanilla CoffeeMate in the cup to change it to the honey tinge that he enjoys, and he sits down at the dining room table now, sipping it. He looks out across the beach. It's at that time of the morning when it's technically morning, but the moon would say otherwise, glimmering in the sky. He sighs, setting his head down on the table. Normally, he's ready for training season. Usually, he jumps at the chance to be back around his teammates, the guys that really get him because they get the sport. But he doesn't feel prepared. Paula is breathing down his neck about publicity, about getting his name out there for MVP consideration. But that's not him, and he realizes it in the non-night, not-quite morning, because he'll be damned if he has an epiphany at a convenient time. He just wants to play football. But it isn't that easy, not when you go pro, and certainly not when you're actually good at it. He hates that this is his life now. He briefly considers if firing Paula would provide a solution, but he sighs and takes another sip of his coffee. It will only put her out of work and mean more hours wasted searching for an agent who would invariably be worse at their job. Paula's crazy, but necessary. So how did he go about playing football but staying out of the public spotlight? How did he just do his job and then go home? \"Hey, cutie. What are you doing awake at the Devil's Hour?\" He looks up, stunned out of his inner turmoil. Holden, the man he had been sharing his bed with for the past month and a half, is standing there at the other end of the dining room table, rubbing his eyes. He's cast in the soft glow of the kitchen light that Sean had forgotten to turn off, and he's dressed in one of Sean's old college hoodies. It wipes away every train of thought that had been bustling through Sean's mind.

I am crazy-super-busy, but doing some work with this couple again has relaxed me majorly. I hope you enjoy this. The warm water against his calves eased his muscles, his eyes fixating on the small figure frolicking in the spacious pool. Dim lights illuminated the patio, casting the young girl in an aural glow. Sean was used to the swelling in his chest now, even if the psychological response refused to dim with time. It was almost welcoming though, as he took a swig of his beer and braced himself on the stone ground. He stifled the urge to bite at the inside of his cheek, emotions too long withheld attempting to flare. The flesh was still growing back from last time. \"Papa, can I get some ice cream?\" His thoughts fled him as he took in his daughter, blue eyes gleaming as she leaned against his knees, beaming up at him. \"Ice cream? You were just having an awesome time swimming!\" He exclaimed, leaning forward. \"Yeah I know, but I just really want ice cream. It's like the best food ever.\" He chuckled, grabbing her under the arms and lifting her up out of the pool before climbing up himself. He grabbed her towel from the back of a chair and squatted down, wrapping it around her. \"Get dried off, then I'll fix your ice cream. You have to change after that, though; it's a big night, remember?\" She nodded, eager and anxious as she tried to dry herself off as quickly as possible. He wrapped the damp towel back around her and lifted her into a high seat at the outdoor bar. \"I'll be right back, baby girl.\" He said, swiping his feet on a mat before heading inside. After applying a generous amount of whipped cream to two scoops of mint chocolate chip ice cream, he headed back outside to see her swiveling on the chair, waiting with all the patience as a six year-old could muster. Sean set the bowl in front of her and grabbed his beer before taking a seat, leaning against the bar and watching the clock. It was past her bedtime, but tonight was special. There was no way she was falling asleep at this rate as it was. \"How's first grade treating you?\" He asked, turning toward her as she made short work of the bowl's contents. \"It's good. I think I'm the smartest one in my class, because every time the teacher asks a math question and no one raises their hand, she always asks me what the answer is. I always get it right.\" \"Well, you didn't get that from me; I was always bad at math.\" \"Daddy says you weren't very good at school stuff.\" She said, seizing the final bite of her ice cream. \"Oh, he did?\" Sean asked, raising an eyebrow. \"Yeah, but he said that you're the best football player in the world, so it evened out.\" Sean grinned, taking the bowl and standing. \"You should go get changed; it's about that time.\" Sean took a seat comfortably on the couch, propping his feet up as the light of the kitchen filtered into the otherwise dark room. He tilted his head back, scratching at the scruff against his cheek and just thinking, impatience threatening to overwhelm him. \"Isabelle, what's taking you so long? I already had your clothes laid out, girl.\" She came prancing in, dressed not in her pink pajamas but instead in an iCarly shirt and jeans designed by Selena Gomez. She smiled innocently, and any concern of cleaning the closet that surely now in shambles leaving his mind with it. She climbed up into his lap, and he held her against him, nuzzling her hair before she settled against his chest. \"Just a few more minutes, right?\" She asked, looking up at him. \"Yeah, it should be soon baby girl.\" He replied, running a hand through the blond curls. Time passed unbearably slowly, his pulsing slowing to an almost slumber-like rate. So when the scrape of a key turning in the lock of the front door sounded, his heart rate almost bottomed out, jumping so high so quickly as Isabelle lunged off of him and bounded toward the door. Sean stood, not wanting to run, yet feeling of equal excitement to his daughter as the door swung open. The porch light doused Holden in angelic light, his eyes shadowed as he set his bags down just in time to catch Isabelle jumping at him. His hair was slightly unkempt, his tie swung over his shoulder while his jacket lay on top of one of his suitcases. Memory didn't do him justice. \"Hey beautiful! How have you been?\" He asked, leaning down to get eye level with the girl who was clinging desperately to whatever part of her dad that she could reach. \"I missed you Daddy!\" She exclaimed into his chest, and Sean just stood there, arms crossed over his chest. Holden picked Isabelle up, and Sean walked to close the door, locking it back as the other man carried the exuberant girl to the couch. Sean moved Holden's bags out of the way of the door before walking back over toward the couch, taking a seat beside the two as Isabelle went on and on about the month that had passed since Holden had been home. He wore a bright smile more genuine than anything Sean had seen in a while, looking just like the little girl in his arms. Holden reached out with his free hand, taking Sean's hand in his as he continued to listen to tales of lunchtime gossip and recess squabbles, catching Sean's eyes briefly. A simple glance, and it was enough for him. \"Isabelle had no shortage of life experience to share. That girl's a well of knowledge these days.\" Holden said, hanging up his tie and unbuttoning his shirt. \"Yeah, it's amazing what a six year-old learns in school that isn't actually academic. I'm just waiting for her to come home and say she's in love.\" Sean said, walking into the closet in his sweats, pulling the shirt from Holden's shoulders. Holden pulled his hands free and turned to Sean, smiling wide. \"I missed you.\" He said, softer than was likely intended. Sean's heart thudded nonetheless, and he leaned forward, taking the man's lips in his. Lights jumped behind his closed lids, arms aflame where Holden's hands settled. He pulled away, only to hang up the shirt. Holden wrapped his arms around Sean's torso, head against his shoulder. \"I love you.\" He said, words weighted with courage. \"Me too, babe.\" Sean said, taking Holden's hand and leading him back to their bedroom before kissing him again. Holden's hand came to his shoulder blade as the other rested on his hip, thumb moving past the fabric, heat building in Sean's chest, a craving that he had withheld for too long. He didn't even remember lying down on the bed, but now Holden was straddling his hips, kissing down his neck as his hands held the other man's hips. \"I don't know…if I can handle you being gone so long again, babe.\" Sean muttered. Holden's hands pressed against his chest as he sat up. A smile graced his face, and Sean was overcome with urge to never let him go. \"Sean Jackson…you can just say what you're feeling for once, you know.\" Sean bit as his lip before realizing better of it. \"I missed you…that's all.\"","LastChapter":"I Miss You By: KellyCRocker59 A/N: I'm back!

As a forewarning, I'm going to be getting into some angst territory very soon, so this will probably serve as the last piece of actual joy that either feel for a bit from me. Please review! Feedback helps me survive! Sean closed the door softly behind him, kicking his shoes off with a dull thud against the hardwood floor. All of the lights were off as he hung up his jacket on the coat rack, and headed to the bedroom. He pushed the door open, heart thudding heavy for what, or who, he was about to see. No matter how many times he saw the other male in his bed, it still made his blood pump excitedly. \"Sean?\" The male in the bed sat up slowly, bare chest exposed as the sheets fell to his stomach. He smiled at the other male, face only slightly illuminated by the moon. \"Yeah,\" Sean replied simply, smiling back at him, unbuttoning his white shirt and sliding out of it. He felt the other male's eyes on him as he unbuckled his pants and slid them off, leaving him in only his socks and boxers. He pulled his socks off and gathered up the clothes, dropping them in the laundry basket across the room. Then he was walking back to the bed. The other male scooted over and pulled the sheets back for him. Sean climbed into bed, and then on top of the other male. Holden gasped beneath him excitedly as Sean straddled his hips and then ran his hands up the other male's outstretched arms, weaving their fingers together once he reached their hands, successfully pinning him to the bed. \"You're so beautiful.\" Sean whispered, leaning down so that their noses touched. Then, Holden suddenly rolled them over, Sean caught unprepared. He was the one now pinned to the bed, the back of his head pressed to a pillow, Holden smiling above him. Then he was leaning down as Sean had, but stopped a bit short. \"You're not too bad yourself.\" He replied, and then Sean leaned up, pressing their lips together. Holden released Sean's hands, the football player reaching up and clutching the other male's back, pulling him down further. Holden's hands rested gently on Sean's chest, the kiss developing into a deep, lingering moment of intimacy. It was exactly what Sean had been waiting for since he had arrived home, and he groaned happily against Holden's lips. Finally, they parted, and Holden rolled off of him, curling into Sean's side, head resting on his chest. Sean wrapped an arm around Holden, enjoying the feeling of his partner's stubble against his skin. \"How did practice go?\" Holden asked, hand running down Sean's tight stomach, feeling each muscle beneath the skin. \"Good; I think this new team is really going to be good for me.\" Sean replied. \"I knew Paula would take care of you. She really likes you.\" Holden said. \"I'm pretty sure she likes all of her clients that make her a ton of money.\" Sean answered with a smile, fingers running along Holden's arm as it settled over Sean's stomach. \"True.\" Holden replied, and they were silent for a moment, just enjoying one another's company. \"So…what do you think about maybe…adopting?\" Holden asked hesitantly, looking up at Sean. Sean lifted his head so that he could better see Holden, and then smiled at the hope that the other male had unconsciously filled his eyes with. \"I would love to start a family with you,\" Sean replied, \"whether it's through adoption or whatever other means there are, I'm happy.\" \"Do you think I'll make a good dad?\" Holden asked suddenly. \"You kidding me? You would be the best dad ever. And I'm not just being biased.\" Sean said, hand moving to brush along the side of the other male's face. \"Really?\" Holden questioned, unmoved by the romantic gesture. \"Of course! You're nurturing and kind and you've always been great with kids at the cancer benefits we've been to.\" Sean explained. Holden smiled, and then averted his eyes. \"Wait, what's wrong?\" Sean asked, moving his arms so that one lifted Holden's chin toward him and the other rested at the elastic of his boxers, thumbing brushing there gently. \"It's just…I know you'll be a great dad, Sean. You have the instincts and the nature of a protector and…and you're just a normal guy . I'm afraid that I might be, you know…too gay…\" Holden trailed his words off, not sure if he even voiced his insecurities correctly. \"Seriously, Holden?\" Sean said, incredulous, \"You're an amazing guy ! Not an amazing girl, an amazing man. No, you don't carry a beer around and make crude jokes, and you don't host a barbeque where you secretly objectify women with your guy friends. But the way you can just look into a kid's eyes and know what they need, know how to talk to them? There are so many dads that would give anything to have that sort of connection with their kids.\" Holden's eyes focused more clearly on Sean's now, reading them. And then he smiled, pushing himself up the bed and along Sean's chest until his knees were straddling the other male's sides and their faces were parallel. One hand gently on the side of Sean's face, the other in his hair, Holden leaned down, pressing their lips gently together. Sean rested his hands on Holden's hips as they kissed like that for the second time that night, softly and passionately, silence feeling light and free in the room. Holden slowly pulled back, smiling. \"I love you.\" He whispered to Sean. \"I love you too, Holden; no matter what, I will always love you.\" Sean replied, and then he was pushing himself up, pulling Holden with him in a sitting position. Sean leaned back against the headboard, Holden fitting perfectly against his chest as his arms wrapped around him. \"I'm sorry if I always seem so unsure of myself.\" Holden said softly, running his fingers along Sean's leg, playing with the hem of his boxers. \"Don't apologize; it's kind of adorable sometimes how you don't even realize that there are so many amazing things about you.\" Sean replied, arms moving along Holden and settling around his hip and across his shoulders. Holden set his chin on Sean's arm, kissing the skin gently. \"You're pretty amazing yourself.\" \"Yeah I know.\" Sean said with a smile. Holden chuckled, and then he felt his eyes growing heavy. Slowly, Sean lowered them down onto the bed, Holden resting once more against his chest, hands moving back up to his stomach. Sean drifted to sleep slowly, contently. He couldn't help but get lost in the moment of complete fulfillment.","LastChapter":"Lost In Time By: KellyCRocker59 I wasn't sure how to follow up my first M-fic on these two, so I settled with a pure piece of fluff. As a forewarning, I'm going to be getting into some angst territory very soon, so this will probably serve as the last piece of actual joy that either feel for a bit from me. Please review! Feedback helps me survive! Sean closed the door softly behind him, kicking his shoes off with a dull thud against the hardwood floor. All of the lights were off as he hung up his jacket on the coat rack, and headed to the bedroom. He pushed the door open, heart thudding heavy for what, or who, he was about to see. No matter how many times he saw the other male in his bed, it still made his blood pump excitedly. \"Sean?\" The male in the bed sat up slowly, bare chest exposed as the sheets fell to his stomach. He smiled at the other male, face only slightly illuminated by the moon. \"Yeah,\" Sean replied simply, smiling back at him, unbuttoning his white shirt and sliding out of it. He felt the other male's eyes on him as he unbuckled his pants and slid them off, leaving him in only his socks and boxers. He pulled his socks off and gathered up the clothes, dropping them in the laundry basket across the room. Then he was walking back to the bed. The other male scooted over and pulled the sheets back for him. Sean climbed into bed, and then on top of the other male. Holden gasped beneath him excitedly as Sean straddled his hips and then ran his hands up the other male's outstretched arms, weaving their fingers together once he reached their hands, successfully pinning him to the bed. \"You're so beautiful.\" Sean whispered, leaning down so that their noses touched. Then, Holden suddenly rolled them over, Sean caught unprepared. He was the one now pinned to the bed, the back of his head pressed to a pillow, Holden smiling above him. Then he was leaning down as Sean had, but stopped a bit short. \"You're not too bad yourself.\" He replied, and then Sean leaned up, pressing their lips together. Holden released Sean's hands, the football player reaching up and clutching the other male's back, pulling him down further. Holden's hands rested gently on Sean's chest, the kiss developing into a deep, lingering moment of intimacy. It was exactly what Sean had been waiting for since he had arrived home, and he groaned happily against Holden's lips. Finally, they parted, and Holden rolled off of him, curling into Sean's side, head resting on his chest. Sean wrapped an arm around Holden, enjoying the feeling of his partner's stubble against his skin. \"How did practice go?\" Holden asked, hand running down Sean's tight stomach, feeling each muscle beneath the skin. \"Good; I think this new team is really going to be good for me.\" Sean replied. \"I knew Paula would take care of you. She really likes you.\" Holden said. \"I'm pretty sure she likes all of her clients that make her a ton of money.\" Sean answered with a smile, fingers running along Holden's arm as it settled over Sean's stomach. \"True.\" Holden replied, and they were silent for a moment, just enjoying one another's company. \"So…what do you think about maybe…adopting?\" Holden asked hesitantly, looking up at Sean. Sean lifted his head so that he could better see Holden, and then smiled at the hope that the other male had unconsciously filled his eyes with. \"I would love to start a family with you,\" Sean replied, \"whether it's through adoption or whatever other means there are, I'm happy.\" \"Do you think I'll make a good dad?\" Holden asked suddenly. \"You kidding me? You would be the best dad ever. And I'm not just being biased.\" Sean said, hand moving to brush along the side of the other male's face. \"Really?\" Holden questioned, unmoved by the romantic gesture. \"Of course! You're nurturing and kind and you've always been great with kids at the cancer benefits we've been to.\" Sean explained. Holden smiled, and then averted his eyes. \"Wait, what's wrong?\" Sean asked, moving his arms so that one lifted Holden's chin toward him and the other rested at the elastic of his boxers, thumbing brushing there gently. \"It's just…I know you'll be a great dad, Sean. You have the instincts and the nature of a protector and…and you're just a normal guy . I'm afraid that I might be, you know…too gay…\" Holden trailed his words off, not sure if he even voiced his insecurities correctly. \"Seriously, Holden?\" Sean said, incredulous, \"You're an amazing guy ! Not an amazing girl, an amazing man. No, you don't carry a beer around and make crude jokes, and you don't host a barbeque where you secretly objectify women with your guy friends. But the way you can just look into a kid's eyes and know what they need, know how to talk to them? There are so many dads that would give anything to have that sort of connection with their kids.\" Holden's eyes focused more clearly on Sean's now, reading them. And then he smiled, pushing himself up the bed and along Sean's chest until his knees were straddling the other male's sides and their faces were parallel. One hand gently on the side of Sean's face, the other in his hair, Holden leaned down, pressing their lips gently together. Sean rested his hands on Holden's hips as they kissed like that for the second time that night, softly and passionately, silence feeling light and free in the room. Holden slowly pulled back, smiling. \"I love you.\" He whispered to Sean. \"I love you too, Holden; no matter what, I will always love you.\" Sean replied, and then he was pushing himself up, pulling Holden with him in a sitting position. Sean leaned back against the headboard, Holden fitting perfectly against his chest as his arms wrapped around him. \"I'm sorry if I always seem so unsure of myself.\" Holden said softly, running his fingers along Sean's leg, playing with the hem of his boxers. \"Don't apologize; it's kind of adorable sometimes how you don't even realize that there are so many amazing things about you.\" Sean replied, arms moving along Holden and settling around his hip and across his shoulders.

But back then, before he came slamming out of the closet, he could only ever think of himself. It amazed him Holden even stuck around for as long as he did. Sean was such a self-righteous, stuck-up bastard. So worried about his public image and pleasing the media, what had Holden seen in him anyway? He didn't blame him for dumping his sorry ass and walking away. When it happened, when Holden had walked away, Sean had been so angry. Not at himself, but at Holden . He blamed him for 'making' him gay. For making him hide. He blamed Holden because he didn't want to admit to himself that his entire life had been a lie. He didn't want to acknowledge the fact that when he was teenager and jacked off to images of Demi Moore and Brooke Shields, they hadn't really morphed into bigger, brawnier pictures of Scott Baio, Rob Lowe and John Stamos and forced him to come so hard he saw stars. That was just his imagination. He didn't want to admit that after Holden, even trying to think of a woman in a sexual manner had his stomach turning and him walking as fast as he could without hurting her feelings in the opposite direction.

Probably about the only good thing that came from it, he thought. His career was more than likely shot to hell and the public was going to burn him alive. He was stripped bare for everyone to see for the first time in his life, and for what? Because he was so goddamn pathetic and desperate to have Holden again that he was giving up. He was giving up . Sean had already forced himself to realize that Holden had left, and, knowing him, he wouldn't come back. That's just how the man was. He didn't stick around if he wasn't needed or wanted. He had stretched himself thin for Sean and had gotten hardly anything in return, so, no, he wasn't coming back. Sean could understand that. He didn't want to, but he could. So he was shocked and painfully hopeful when he opened his eyes from a drunken stupor four months after Holden had turned his back on him to see dancing blue eyes and a familiar warm smile curling inviting lips standing above him. And there were so many things he wanted to say, so many things he wanted Holden to know, but all he could say was, \"You saw,\" with that familiar tone of shame and embarrassment soaking each word. But not for the reasons it had always been. This time - this time it was because he didn't know how Holden would take it. Didn't, for once, know how he would react. But then he could feel Holden's hand in his hair and his voice was so warm when he answered that Sean could only stare at him. He covered Holden's hand with his own and pulled it around so he could press his lips to his palm and murmured, \"I'm sorry. For everything.\" He stood, swayed a little, and wrapped his arms around Holden's leaner form and crushed their mouths together. To be honest, neither of them were good with words. Especially Sean. Holden was only good with speaking in front of a room full of people and selling ideas and products to business corporate officials. Where Sean was closed off and tight lipped about feelings, Holden was a fumbling blind man that at least tried. They were so alike and so opposite at the same time that it blew Sean's mind. But he knew with every fiber of his being that he needed Holden. Needed him more than he'd ever admit and more than Holden would ever believe. Sean was good at expressing through action though, and he fell back on it with an overwhelming sense of relief. Despite being drunk, he pulled Holden after him to his - their room without much stumbling and pressed him down into the bed, pulling off his clothes and shedding his own and kissing him with a feverish intensity that seemed to infect Holden, too. They were rolling and tangling and gasping and stealing each others breath. Every touch was fire and every move sent a shock throughout his system. God, he had been craving this for so long. He nearly whimpered when he finally pushed inside Holden, swallowing the man's pained grunt in a hungry kiss and lifting his legs by the backs of his knees to wrap around him. He started to move in and out, shivering in excitement at the erotic noises that fell from Holden's lips when he pulled back for air, the way he threw his head back into the pillow and gripped Sean's biceps so tight, his quick pants, his liquid groans. Sean moaned and ground his hips deeper as Holden pushed back, meeting him halfway with each thrust. He felt him grab the back of his head and eagerly moved to cover his mouth again, breathing his air greedily and sucking wetly on his wicked tongue. \"S-Sean...fuck, Sean!\" Sean bucked forward, curling his toes into the sheets and pushing harder. His head felt like it was about to explode, every nerve-ending ablaze with an agonizing kind of pleasure. He was so close it hurt, aching and throbbing and making him arch his back over Holden to drive in again and again with pleads and animalistic groans bubbling from deep inside his chest. Everything was so captivating and hypnotic in the movements, and Holden's eyes were open and blazing bright blue in the dark of the bedroom, commanding and mesmerizing. Harder...deeper...faster...so close...not yet...don't stop...faster...chase it...faster... harder. .. The world turned upside down, consumed him and tore a yell from his throat. Holden convulsed, clamping around him and matching his desperate cry with one of his own. He tried to keep himself upright, tried to make sense of the things around him, but his starved lungs struggled for air and everything went black. oOo Hours later, Sean woke up draped over Holden with his softened dick still inside him. He shivered and tried not to make a pained noise when he pulled out. Holden hissed and opened his eyes. Sean blinked and smiled sheepishly, moving to lay next to him. \"Holden, I -\" To his surprise, Holden covered his mouth with his hand and chuckled. \"It's alright. You don't have to say anything right now.\" Sean relaxed and smiled against his hand. \"Save it for later when I'm not half asleep.\" Sean tilted his head into his hand, nuzzling his nose against the inside of Holden's wrist. \"I'm going to make it up to you. I swear.\" \"I know.\" He leaned over for a chaste kiss, felt drugged when Holden moved his lips with him, and deepened it. This time, he let Holden take over and it was slow and gentle and promises were pulled from his lips like prayers and he couldn't understand why he ever gave this up in the first place. Too soon he was gasping and writhing under Holden. He was pushed too easily over the edge into his second climax. But Holden didn't stop, kept moving, and Sean knew they wouldn't be leaving the bedroom at all that day. And he was perfectly fine with that.

He pinned his lover down to the bed using his whole bodyweight. It was Holden's third try to get up, but again he failed. Ok, he had to admit it, those tries had been less than half-hearted. He loved feeling Sean's warm skin on his own, the demanding hands, the lustful glint in the other man's eyes. Sean mumbled some unintelligible words into his neck while kissing it. Sounded a bit like \"we'll take … next … want ya now!\" Holden wasn't sure about the first part of that, but when Sean ran his fingers through his hair and slowly tugged his head back into the pillow to kiss his Adam's apple it was pretty clear that he got the 'want ya now' part accurately. The footballer returned to the left side of Holden's neck and started sucking in the soft skin, very gentle at first but he intensified very quickly. Holden bit his lower lip and sighed out a moan when he felt Sean's teeth capturing his flesh. He glanced at the clock - they still had almost four hours until the flight. 'Ok then, no breakfast.' Tenderly ruffling Sean's hair he guided him down. Sean followed obediently and loosened his grip now that he was sure that Holden would stay in bed. Still lying on him Sean framed his lover's sides with his arms and took his time for covering the sensitive skin of his chest with kisses. The fine line of hair along Holden's stomach directed his lips down. After making another moisty stopover, this time at his abs, the footballer finally disappeared under the sheets. \" God !\" Holden grabbed the mattress with one hand and added to the pressure on Sean's head with the other to make him take in as much of his length as possible. 'Why would I want breakfast if I can have this !' Holden brought down their bag for the weekend. Sean was still in the shower so he decided to make them at least a coffee for the drive to the airport, the taxi should arrive in 15 minutes. Holden was just switching the machine on when the telephone rang. On his way through the room he slipped into the T-shirt Sean had ironed yesterday evening. He smiled thinking about the explanation his partner had for doing so. \" Mom has ironed all of my clothes when I was a kid, and I wanna show her that I learned that for life.\" \" Sean, you haven't ironed anything as long as I know you. I'm wondering that you know where the flatiron is stowed away!\" He laughed at the face his partner made and contentedly leaned back with a wide grin on his face. \"Sean Jackson is cheating his mom, I can't believe it!\" \" I'm not cheating her! Just… starting again with good old habits!\" Holden could see that not even Sean himself believed what he was saying there. He stepped behind him and grabbed his tight waist with both hands, leaning against his back and putting his chin on his shoulder. \"So, will you iron my shirts for work from now on? I don't want you to be bored with just our T-shirts.\" Sean snorted but continued his task. \"No, I won't. I mean, I could… Ok well, you got me. You know, as long as I can remember she keeps asking if I'm doing well living on my own and stuff. And maybe she recognizes by things like this that I'm grown up and can take care of myself. It's stupid, I know.\" \" A bit yeah. But well, she won't ask anymore. She knows that you have me now. Of course she thinks you're doing well from now on.\" Holden stated seriously. \" You're a jerk.\" \" Right back at you.\" They couldn't keep straight faces any longer and shared a laugh. Sean turned around and looked at Holden with steel-blue puppy dog eyes. \"Can I be honest with you? I hate ironing. Your shirt is done. Is it ok that you will look flawless tomorrow and I won't? I can't make one more move with this thing, let alone a whole shirt.\" Holden didn't answer. With a knowing smile on his face he took the flatiron out of Sean's hand, pulled the plug and put it in a safe place to cool off. Then he took his partner's hand and drew him upstairs. \"We better go to bed, before you're too tired for another good old habit.\" The sparkle in Sean's eyes showed him that he didn't need to be any more specific. Holden had reached the phone and looked on the display. \"'Phone number withheld', okayyy.\" He accepted the call. \"Hello.\" He heard some slight noises on the other end, but got no answer. \"Helloooo…\" Nothing. \"Ok then, thanks for calling. Maybe you have something to say next time.\" He ended the call but kept looking on the display, 'that was strange, I swear I heard something.' Warm lips on his neck and two strong arms embracing his waist made him forget his thoughts. \"Who did you call? Hopefully not my mom to tell her we can't make it. You would break her heart.\" Sean chuckled. \"She loves you to death!\" Holden turned around in his arms. \"No, it was an incoming one, someone probably dialed the wrong number, he could at least have apologized. But aaanyway… I never would cancel the weekend! I can't wait to see your parents again. They were so lovely the other day. I still can't believe you were afraid telling them you're gay. I only met them once, but I feel that I could share almost everything with them. It's like I've known them forever.\" Sean smiled at him. \"Yeah. Hm… I don't know if I'm allowed to tell you, but they mentally adopted you when they saw you for the first time. At least my mom did!\" Holden giggled and blushed. Sean looked right into his eyes now. \"I love you Holden. Everything is so much easier now that it's out. I was an idiot.\" \"You were !\" Sean was about to protest, but before he could say something Holden cupped his face with his hands and kissed him. \"But not anymore.\" They just stood there arm in arm smiling at each other for a moment, then both startled by the noise of a honking car. \"Our taxi.\" \"Yeah.\" One deep breath and another smile later they finally parted and left the house. The flight from LAX to SFO would take about 1.20 h. Ten minutes after take-off Sean had dozed off. His head rested on Holden's shoulder, their entwined hands on his thigh. Holden couldn't sleep. While looking out of the window he thought about how his life had changed during the last two months. Before this year's Valentine's Day Holden practically 'didn't exist', their life as a couple was limited to the house. He never attended any public event with Sean. They didn't even drive to the supermarket together nor had a walk at the beach. When they went out for dinner, which rarely happened - only when Sean was tired of hearing Holden's begging anymore, he always was his estate agent when he was asked. He remembered one recent dinner in particular. They just had ordered their drinks when a lady of Sean's management saw them from another table and came over to say hello. It was pure torture for Holden to see the couple next to them holding hands and showing their love to the world, while Sean talked to that woman and called him 'Mr. Wilson'. He politely smiled at her despite his feelings. It was part of the game. Holden sighed. But now he was a part of Sean's life, his entire life. It was so exciting to finally get to know the team and his friends. And most of them were so cool about it and were happy for them. While being hugged and clapped on the shoulder they heard a lot of ' I knew it ' and ' I never bought that estate agent story, one look into your eyes said it all '. The minor rest wasn't that enthusiastic, but accepted it. Which was fine with Holden. Sean's fans were wonderful too. Well, most likely there were some folks that were not very happy to see their favorite football player with a guy on his side… comes with the territory, you can't please everybody. But those people thankfully kept quiet. Holden remembered when they attended this huge fundraising dinner. It was their very first official appearance as a couple. He was so nervous and almost hadn't the guts to get out of the limousine that had picked them up from home and stopped at the red carpet now. He could see that Sean felt the same. Neither their flawless black suits and ties nor the rest of their well-groomed appearance could hide the tension. But then Sean took his hand and kissed his palm. His eyes assured that everything was good and they finally got out of the car. Being the boss of about 200 people and having to deal with his clients, most of them important and / or rich, Holden wasn't a shy person. At least that's what he had thought until now. This scenario however was insane, and very intimidating. The people went nuts. They were screaming like he and Sean were some kind of rock stars. Right, they cheered for him too, ridiculous. Sean immediately flipped the switch and was right in his element, he was used to being cheered at. With a perfect grin on his face he took Holden's hand and waved at the crowd with the other. Meanwhile Holden really had to concentrate on smiling and not looking like a timid fawn in the light cone of a car. And it worked. With the help of his self-soothing - well… breathing - , Sean's closeness and the fact that they were frenetically reveled he finally calmed down and started soaking up the atmosphere. He had to admit it… it gave him quite a rush. The photographers at this event were as crazy as the fans. Holden had never been snapped that often in his whole life as in these ten minutes on the red carpet. Even half an hour later he still saw white little stars dancing in front of his eyes. Then the paparazzi. Their creativity to get ' the shot ' was both fascinating and annoying. During the first three weeks after Sean's coming out they were everywhere. He and Sean had a hard time to live a halfway normal life. Holden couldn't go to work and come back home without being photographed. But eventually everybody had calmed down. The people apparently had read enough 'Quarterback Sean Jackson's boyfriend is leaving their love nest' articles. He snorted and shook his head. Then he looked down on his partner. 'So peaceful.' He sighed and gently kissed his hair. Sean responded with a deep breath. When Holden looked back up, his eyes met the glance of a redheaded teenage boy sitting in the seat row to their right. He smiled at him. The boy startled a bit like he felt getting caught staring at them. But then he smiled back with a light flush on his cheeks which brought out his freckles even more. \"Hi.\" The flush disappeared as quickly as it came. \"I saw you on TV and in the mags. It's a pretty cool thing what he did at that press conference.\" He pointed at Sean. \"Yeah, it is.\" \"I mean… really… not many would have the balls to come out like this!\" Holden chuckled. \"Sorry, I mean… wouldn't have the courage.\" The boy frowned, obviously worried about his choice of words. \"No, 'balls' is ok – couldn't say it any better.\" Holden grinned. The flush was back. \"My name is Neil.\" \"Hey Neil, nice to meet ya.\" The seemingly same-aged girl next to Neil rolled her eyes and hit his arm. \"Ask him already!\" The boy frowned at her, but she didn't seem to care. Instead she leaned over his lap which made her wild red locks fall into her face. Puffing it out of her sight she addressed the amused Holden. \"Hi, I'm his sister. Neil is gay, he has a huge crush on you two and wants to ask if he could take a photo with you. He thinks you're hot, which is true by the way. If you do it, I want a pic with you as well.\" \"Audrey, shut the fuck up!\" He pushed her back into her seat and hung his head in shame. He was blushing crimson now. Holden tried not to wake Sean with his chuckling. \"Okaaay… I think we can do that. The photo thing. We should wait until he wakes up though, what do you think?\" The boy giggled and looked bashfully at the ground. \"Probably better, yeah. Thanks.\" Then he glanced back at Holden and shrugged his shoulders. \"Sorry for my sister… family !\" \"Yeah. No problem, it's ok.\" Holden looked down on their hands in his lap, still smiling. \"Family.\" When the flight attendants started serving drinks and snacks Sean woke up from a seemingly very healthy nap. He yawned and stretched and before Holden knew it grabbed his face and kissed him. And kissed more intense with every passing second. When he felt his partner's tongue sliding into his mouth Holden backed off. \"Sean!\" The football player grinned. \"What! You wanted me to openly show my love for you.\" \"Yeah, but not all of it… on a plane .\" Holden raised an eyebrow. But he couldn't help grinning back. \"You want a coffee, gentlemen?\" They simultaneously looked up to the stewardess and simultaneously replied with a \"No, thank you\". All three shared a smile and she moved on. Sean took Holden's hand again and slightly massaged it. \"I didn't wanna bring it up again at first, but… I've been thinking about this phone call today. You know… it wasn't the first one. He or she called twice already, at least I guess it's the same person.\" Holden frowned. \"Do you think that could be some weird fan or something? I mean, should we be worried?\" \"It could be a fan yeah, but I think we have nothing to fear from him / her. Let's wait if it stops.\" Holden slowly nodded. \"Ok.\" He wasn't sure if it was ok, but he trusted Sean. He surely could evaluate the situation. But then his face lightened up. \"Oh on a lighter note, let me introduce you to Neil and Audrey.\" The plane had landed and the two men were waiting for their luggage. While the conveyor belt offered them everything but their own bag, Holden leaned against Sean. In the corner of his eye he saw someone waving at them. Sean must have seen it too since he already raised his hand. Holden kept his right arm around his partner's waist but waved back with the left one. Those two kids were really cool. Unbelievable that twins looking alike like them could be such different personalities. Chatting with them had made the rest of the flight really enjoyable. Now they were leaving with their parents and would have a great vacation here in San Francisco. Neil and Audrey, really beautiful names. Finally their bag arrived and they could head to the waiting area where they should meet Sean's parents. On the way out Sean turned his phone back on. Two seconds later it beeped. \"It's a message from mom. 'Hey boys. Take a rental or taxi, explain later.'\" Sean seemed more surprised than worried. \"Taxi or rental, Holden?\" \"Both fine with me. Let's take a cab.\" They didn't directly drive to Sean's parents. He made the taxi driver take them to his old high school at first to show Holden around. Sean had assumed that for a Friday it was too late for any classes and they would be alone. He was wrong. They were overrunning him, asking for autographs and pictures. He was the hometown boy returning to the place where everything had started, so he couldn't refuse. Holden waited patiently, he was used to it by now. The last group of girls even wanted a pic with both men, which was pretty strange according to Holden. He was a Nobody to them. But Sean had already grabbed his hand and tugged him into the visual range of the camera. \"Cheese!\" It took them a good hour to get away from there. After that they had a little sightseeing tour, stopping by at Sean's favorite places of his neighborhood. Holden loved seeing all this and listening to Sean's stories and memories. He had visited San Francisco before, but only for work. He had seen nothing but his hotels and conference rooms. But the city was really pretty… and not just because Sean obviously loved it. When they finally arrived at his parents' house, they paid the driver and wished him luck with his third baby girl – he hadn't talked about anything else during the whole drive, very sweet and amusing. He really loved that little girl. Holden had a look around. It was a lovely, good middle-class neighborhood. Nicely trimmed hedges, green front lawns everywhere, even the trees were cut accurately. He had been here before, but that was his first meeting with Sean's parents and he didn't have an eye for it then. It had been hard enough for him to keep breathing and try to live up to their expectations. This time, being much more confident of their affection, he could take his time to take everything in. So this was the place where Sean was raised. He turned around. Even the house itself radiated nothing but kindness and love. It was a nice two-floor building, painted in a light green. Various flowers in tubs and other plants were perfectly placed to complete the picture. This was a home, a real home . Holden sighed deeply. Fragments of memories of his own childhood crawled into his mind, but he instantly shoved them away. He had promised himself not to think about it. And he wouldn't. Not today. Looking at Sean he could see the concern in the other man's eyes. But as soon as he put on a smile, his partner's features lightened up again, he leaned over and kissed him. \"You're ok?\" \"Yeah.\" The door flew open and Sean's mom rushed out with open arms and a wide grin on her face. Her skirt with a colorful flower print made her look like spring itself. \"Sean! Looks like we see you more often now that you're out of the closet. It's just been a month since our family party and you visit us again !\" She hugged and kissed him. \"Hey darling!\" \"Hey mom!\" Letting her out of his embrace, Sean saw his mother's sparkling eyes when she turned to his right. Following her look he just could smile about the cute sheepish grin Holden had put on. His concern from earlier had disappeared. This was the Holden he wanted to see. Sean slightly shook his head. 'Those two.' His mom gave Holden a long and tight cuddle. \"Hey sweetie. Look at you! You are so gorgeous!\" The young man hugged her and ran his hand over her back. Sean could feel that Holden was still insecure with handling her, but on the other hand he was more than willing to take every gesture of love he could get. Holden finally placed a gentle kiss on her cheek. \"Thanks. You look very pretty today, Christine.\" She tilted backwards and gave him a half pretended half meant angry look. \"Holden, I told you to call me mom.\" Holden wanted to answer, but Sean interfered. \"Mom, give him some time. He knows you for a month now and has just met you once! And he's not used to so much mother love.\" Both of them looked at him. Sean's mom frowned. \"What do you mean?\" Holden put a hand on Sean's chest, \"please… don't.\" He then turned back to her with a slightly afflicted smile and she could read in his eyes not to bring the missing mother love into question, at least for now. She nodded. \"Okayyyy… so boys, sorry we couldn't pick you up from the airport. The car is broken down again. And well… the money doesn't grow on trees, right?\" She nudged Holden who just smiled at her. \"What do you mean with 'again'? Mom, I told you a thousand times to call me when you have a problem. I would have paid the repair or a new car.\" \"Sean, we don't want that. Live off your money.\" \"You don't do that, come on! I love you and of course I wanna help you when you need it.\" He looked at Holden who obviously felt a bit uncomfortable witnessing the little disagreement. Sensing that his partner wanted him to say something he put a hand on Christine's back, \"Sean's right. We'd love to help you out. That's what the family is there for, right?\" \"Right!\" Sean agreed. \"See mom, your sweetie is saying it too.\" Holden made a face but then chuckled. The woman smiled too, \"ok then, let's talk it over with your dad.\" On the way in she skimmed along Holden's chest. \"You iron your T-shirts, Holden? Wow. See Sean, take your boyfriend as an example. He always looks dapper and all spruced up. Look at you! Your shirt is so crinkly, one might think you have been sleeping in it for a week now.\" Holden glanced over to Sean trying not to laugh. The footballer made a face but didn't say anything to defend himself. \"Sure mom. I'll think about it.\" He then addressed his partner with an unmistakably sarcastic undertone. \"Maybe you can show me how to do it, love.\" Holden took his hand and slightly squeezed it. \"Yeah let's see if you can learn it.\" Sean chuckled and closed the distance between them. \"Jerk.\" It was just a whisper into Holden's ear which made the other man grin. Sean's mom however was not amused, both men wondered how she could have heard it anyway. \"Sean Jackson! I don't wanna hear that kind of language!\" She turned to Holden again with a much sweeter, almost lulling voice. \"Don't listen to him sweetie, you're the best that could have happened to him. And no matter what he says, he knows it.\" She put her arm around his waist and guided him into the house. Sean stopped and gazed after them, half amused, half upset. \"Holden, tell her who ironed that shirt.\" He could see his partner whispering something into his mother's ear. They both giggled and turned around. Holden reached out his hand. \"Don't be offended, come on.\" Sean's last try to act huffy yielded to a wide grin. They took him into their midst and went in together. \"Hey Sean. Glad you're here. We haven't seen you that often over the last two years.\" Sean's dad hugged him tightly. \"Yeah dad, mom already mentioned it.\" Sean pursed his lips but instantly smiled when he saw the mischief in his dad's eyes. In that moment Holden entered the living room with Christine. \"Holden, my friend.\" The older man went over, took him into his arms and patted his back. \"How's the house selling doing?\" Holden didn't answer immediately. He took a deep breath and hugged Sean's dad back. He knew it was stupid, but he envied Sean for having parents like this. They were so lovely and kind and… in lack of a better word… wonderful. They've already been very sweet at that family party, but there had been so many people. This weekend they could fully concentrate on each other. That thought made Holden nervous again, he wanted them to like him so badly. But the next second he started chuckling. 'What are you thinking about? Look at them. They both hug you like your own parents never did. How can they not like you?' \"Hey Eric. Business is doing well, thanks.\" With that they parted. \"Dad, mom told me about your car. What do I tell you all the time? You…\" Eric cut his son off. \"Sean, you think you have to help us because we're your parents and you love us.\" Sean inhaled. \"No, let me finish. We know that. We know that you could give us the money and we appreciate that you would do it. But we get along pretty well without it. There's only one thing we want from you. Your love.\" He frowned for a second. \"Ok, maybe there are two things. We also want you to visit your old parents a bit more often than once a year.\" Sean slightly shook his head. \"The car thing isn't off the table yet. But you're right with the rest.\" A conciliating expression appeared on his face. Christine linked arms with Holden again. \"Let's not argue now. I have some freshly baked brownies and an apple pie for us. And now tell us what happened in your life since our last phone call.\" After a funny afternoon with watching tons of photos they enjoyed a delicious dinner – now Holden knew where Sean had his cooking skills from – with a great red wine. For the time after dinner Eric brought out his best scotch. Holden felt like the wine already had been enough for him, but he didn't want to be rude. At about midnight they finally decided that it was time to hit the pillow. Holden got up and instantly felt a bit dizzy. \"Whoops. I guess that was one scotch to many. I think I can't keep up with the Jackson men.\" He smiled at Sean's mom and the two other men who were obviously zero affected by the alcohol. Sean's dad patted his shoulder, \"I don't think that's a bad thing, Holden.\" His hand still on the younger man's shoulder he smiled at his son now, \"you better put him to bed, Sean. I need him fresh and not hungover tomorrow. Wanna show him my new building project.\" Curiosity fought its way through the dizziness in Holden's head. \"Project?\" Sean knew from a phone call with his mother what his dad was talking about. He rolled his eyes and dragged Holden out of the living room. \"I'll tell you later, bear. Niiiiight!\" But Holden managed to squirm himself out of Sean's grip. \"I'm tipsy, but not bad-mannered.\" He made his way over to his partner's parents and gave them both a hug. Christine got a peck on the cheek as well. \"Good night!\" On their way up they heard Sean's mom. \"Eric! Building project? You wanna 'clean up' our old shed. That's not a project. Holden is a highly renowned architect! He won't waste his time with your little idea of a guest house.\" His dad was protesting. \"How can you know, Christine. I just wanna show him… wanna hear his opinion!\" Sean smiled and shook his head while guiding Holden into his old room. \"This photo of you… I want a copy of it for my office. You know, the one with you as a 6 year old in your first football gear! It's so cute!\" Holden grinned at Sean while brushing his teeth. Sean had just rinsed his mouth and looked into the mirror. What he saw, was just adorable, Holden sitting on the edge of the bath tub with stretched out legs, just wearing pajama pants. He wasn't fond of the idea that all of Holden's staff would see the picture, but hey, it could have been worse. There were far more embarrassing shots of him, he could live with it. \"Sure. It's mom's favorite pic too. I'm sure she'll be happy to make you a copy.\" Holden was still working on his teeth, but miraculously Sean understood every word he was saying. \"Yeah, she told me she loves it. Tomorrow she wants to show me some videos too.\" \"Oh nooo…\" Sean mentally flipped through the video footage of him as a child and teenager his parents had shot over the years. \"Your dad said, they have put the stuff on DVD now, to save the quality.\" \"Yeah great! This will be so embarrassing.\" Holden grinned even more. \"Can't wait!\" Finally lying in his old queen-size bed Sean wanted to tell Holden about his father's project. But his partner obviously wasn't in a chatty mood anymore. \"I love you so so much!\" He flooded Sean's neck and face with sappy kisses until he finally found his mouth. Sean loved it when Holden was that passionate and welcomed his lover's demanding tongue with his own. Without ceasing the invasion into his mouth Holden now crawled onto him. Sean automatically put his arms around his body to hold him close. Meanwhile Holden framed Sean's head with his arms and stroked his hair. They enjoyed the mutual caressing for a while. When Holden shifted a bit for a more comfortable position, Sean felt his lover's growing erection brushing his thigh and he moaned into the kiss. Holden smiled against his lips, slowly parted Sean's legs and started massaging his crotch with his own thigh. Sean almost saw stars and the decision to stop Holden in this moment wasn't easy, but somehow his brain subdued his want. \"Holden, we're at my parents' house!\" \"They won't hear us. We'll be quiet.\" Holden breathed into his ear. \"You've never been quiet!\" \"Just because I didn't have to.\" He now rested on his elbows and winked at Sean. \"I can do this!\" His partner shook his head with a grin. \"Bear, you're soooo not used to alcohol. I think we should sleep now.\" Holden snorted \"This isn't the scotch. It's already gone. I know what I'm doing. And right now I wanna looooove you!\" He started chuckling. His sparkling light blue eyes focused on Sean's lips before he bent down and crashed their mouths together again. Holden knew exactly which buttons to push and Sean had a hard time to withstand him and his own recurring, well never really gone lust. But mentally picturing his parents, lying in their bed in the next room hearing them having sex, finally cleared up his mind. \"Holden no! I can't do this.\" Holden returned into his 'half on his elbows, half on Sean' position and looked at him with sad puppy dog eyes. \"Don't look at me like that. I love you, you know that. You're beautiful. God, you're hauntingly beautiful. But, I just can't get romantic with you… with my parents in the same house!\" Holden took a deep breath as if he was considering this argument. He smiled at the man beneath him and slightly nodded before rolling off and getting comfortable at Sean's side. With that none of them said a word for a while and Sean already damned himself for making his partner mad at him. Then Holden finally looked at him with a grin. \"Hauntingly beautiful? What kind of cheesy cheap novels are you secretly reading, honey?\" Sean sighed in relief that he had obviously misinterpreted the silence. He tugged Holden closer to his own body and fondled his hipbone through the fabric of the pants. \"It's not cheesy when it's the truth!\" \"Aww! That's so cute… Sean, I love you so much for being like that!\" Holden reached up and stroked his cheek and jawline. He then snuggled up to Sean and when they had found the perfect position they fell asleep within a few minutes. \"Eric… this is a pretty cool idea! I like the concept!\" Sean's dad looked at his wife and son with a self-satisfied smile. \"See, I told ya!\" Both sighed and rolled their eyes. Holden didn't notice it, he concentrated on the construction plan Eric had made. \"May I suggest something?\" The older man forgot his family in an instant and got all excited now. He grabbed a chair and sat down. \"Sure!\" \"I don't know if you like that kind of room concept… but you could put an open gallery in there. I think it would look fantastic. All wooden materials, very natural …\" All of them could literally see Eric's brain work. \"Ohhh. Ehm… you… you think we could have a look at it?\" Holden looked into the man's sparkling eyes and had to grin, \"Sure! Let's go.\" Sean helped his mother preparing breakfast when the two men were heading to the old shed in the backyard. He could see them through the kitchen window. By the time he started slicing the tomatoes they had arrived at the – in Sean's view – ramshackle hut. They stopped in front of it and his dad was wildly gesturing, obviously describing every detail of his dream to Holden. Sean started to feel sorry for him, but to his surprise his partner chimed in with what looked like own thoughts and suggestions. The footballer smiled widely and concentrated on the tomatoes again. His mom stepped beside him and glanced out of the window. \"You think, dad is bothering Holden with this thing?\" \"No mom, look at him – he loves it!\" \"But I don't want him to feel forced into helping your father with this. He should relax and feel at home here and not… work.\" \"Ma, relax. He feels at home, believe me. And he finally has someone to chat about houses and architecture stuff. Just look at them – they're like kids in the candy store.\" Sean looked at his mom when she responded with a short \"ya\". \"What is it, mom?\" \"Nothing dear.. I just hope they won't spend the whole weekend out there. I want to get to know Holden better too. Ehm… never mind. let's set the table.\" Sean's eyes followed her as she rushed out of the kitchen. 'Could it be that my mom is jealous of my dad for spending time with Holden? Unbelievable.' He chuckled and followed her with more dishes. Holden and Sean already sat at the breakfast table and waited for Sean's parents to join them. After a short glance into the corridor Holden leaned over to his partner. \"Is it ok to tell you that I really like your dad?\" Sean snorted and stared at him. \"Of course! I'm so happy that you get along!\" \"You know, he is sooo interested in architecture. You never told me! Did you know that he has a like new issue of 'The life-work of Frank Lloyd Wright' by H. Th. Wijeveld from 1925? You know… the architect who designed the Guggenheim museum in NYC… the guy I wrote my thesis about… It's so cool!\" Sean rummaged in his memories, but before he could respond to that his parents came in with the coffee and a pan with still sizzling scrambled eggs. Eric smiled at his son's partner. \"Holden, I can't wait to see your plan for the gallery. But as I said, take your time. Your work of course takes priority.\" \"Eric, would you stop it and let the boys eat?\" He looked at his wife. \"You're just jealous that we have the same interest, you only tell him how gorgeous he is.\" \"He is gorgeous! And just for your information, we have common interests too!\" The older man snorted, but Sean's mom continued. \"He doesn't love you more than me… not even now that he knows about your filthy old book of this Wright guy.\" The two men at the table first followed the argument like a tennis match – left, right, left, right – but with the last comment they couldn't hold back the laughter any more. Interrupting his parents' little argument Sean put an arm around Holden's shoulder. \"First of all: From the three of us Holden loves me the most! And second: Give us some eggs already, we're starving!\" Holden still giggled but looked at the couple opposite the table. Though the whole situation was almost comedic, he was really touched. \"You know… Sean is right!\" The urge to laugh welled up again, but he fought it down. \"No seriously. I really love both of you so much. You can't imagine what it means to me to have you in my life now. And I'm thankful that Sean is willing to share his parents with me.\" He now looked at his partner who just smiled at him and replied with a slight nod. Holden leaned over and put a light kiss on Sean's lips. His mom sighed with pleasure and threw her hands on her heart. She looked at her husband, \"look at them!\". He put an arm around her waist and tugged her closer to his side. \"Yep, that's all we could wish for. Our son has found someone he's really happy with.\" \"Yeah, they're such a gorgeous couple!\" Holden blushed. He looked at Sean and was astonished to see that his partner's face had changed colors too. \"Can we stop talking about that and have breakfast already?\" They all knew Sean and smiled about his acted grumpiness. He was romantic, but he obviously wasn't comfortable with his parents analyzing his partnership. \"Yeah, let's eat before the eggs get cold.\" Christine agreed. \"And let's not forget, we have a lot to chat about today and even more videos of sweet little Sean to watch. Of course just if you want, Holden.\" Holden couldn't answer, because right in that second he had shoved a great amount of eggs into his mouth. But he eagerly nodded with sparkling eyes. Christine grinned at him. Sean looked at his parents, then at Holden and finally on his plate. \"Oh my God.\" The weekend was over in a heartbeat. It was Sunday afternoon and they were on the flight home again. \"I just love your parents and I sooo can't wait for them visiting us. Is it ok that I invited them? I mean, I have to catch up on 'having parents', but I don't want you being annoyed or something.\" Sean kissed Holden on the cheek. \"How could I? Mom had tears in her eyes when she had to let you go. And dad wants to see your office and your plan for this gallery thing. Just let me warn you, you can't escape from them anymore.\" Holden grinned at him now. \"I don't want to escape. I love it!\" He felt so happy right now like he could embrace the world. And he already created a plan for Eric's guest house in his mind. He hadn't designed anything for a while now and looked forward to this welcome change from just selling property. Working on this project with Eric would be great. 'He'll be surprised what a treasure has been sleeping in his backyard over years.' Ok, Holden had to admit, he was a bit selfish too. When the guest house would be ready, he and Sean would sleep there during their visits… and… well… Sean probably could relax better when his parents weren't in the adjoining room anymore. 'God, I feel like a teenager planning the first sex experience and trying to hide it from the parents.' He chuckled and looked at the other man. When Sean became aware of it, Holden batted his long lashes for a heartbeat longer than necessary. The footballer seemed to read his mind in a split second and grinned mischievously. He bent over and whispered into Holden's ear. \"Can't wait 'til we're home. I'll make it up to you… for the last two nights.\" Holden tilted his head… almost unnoticeable, but Sean took the offer and kissed his neck. \"God Holden, this will be the longest hour of my life.\" Sean growled into the soft curls behind his ear. \"Don't forget the one hour taxi drive from LAX to our house.\" \"Dammit, that's too long. Wait, we could take a room near the airport. Just for…\" \"Eww, Sean! I won't check in at a 'God-knows-who's-been-lying-here-before' hot-sheet hotel!\" People's heads flew around and many eyes stared at him, too many. 'Oh, that was probably a bit too loud.' While his face turned crimson he glared at Sean. It was his fault after all. But the stifled grin on his partner's face made him chuckle too. \"I'm sorry folks, didn't mean to be rude.\" He slouched down in his seat and dragged Sean closer by gripping his shirt. When his ear – this delicious and lickable ear… uh oh, focus Holden! – when his ear was close enough, he whispered \"What I wanted to say before I made half the plane look at me with disgust – I won't have sex with you in a place like that. Even if the drive will take four hours, we will go home !\" He tilted his head to see the reaction on Sean's face. \"Will you stop grinning please?\" He half-heartedly pushed the other man back into his own seat and tried to stay out of focus for the rest of the flight. \"Sean, I'm home! Sorry for being late!\" Holden put his briefcase on the sideboard. While crossing the living area he loosened his tie, put off his suit jacket and dropped it on a chair. It was a hot day for April and he felt like dying of thirst. Opening the fridge he moaned because of the wonderful cold breeze greeting him. He took out a water. While greedily gulping down the cool liquid he had a look around to see any sign of Sean being at home. But then he heard him coming down the stairs. He had someone on the phone. \"Oh, he's at home now… ehm… do you wanna talk to him?\" Holden was curious now. \"Who is it, love?\" Sean looked at him. \"It's your… mom.\" Holden grinned at him, anxious to talk to the woman he was expecting to be on the other end. He kissed Sean and yanked the phone out of his hand. He frowned for a second at Sean's uneasy look, but then started chattering into the unit. „Hey Christine. Your son is teasing me. Said, it was my mom. I mean, I know you told me again to call you mom and we had a great weekend with you, but… ah you know what, to hell with it…\" He giggled. \"Hello son.\" It took him a second to realize that it wasn't Christine. The smile fell out of his face. His body froze and he had a hard time to continue breathing. \"Holden?\" He grit his teeth, couldn't say a thing. He hadn't heard this voice for over two decades. \"Holden? You're there?\" Again the memories rushed into his brain, unbidden. \"Is he there?\" asked a male voice in the background. Holden started shaking. He got chills all over his body. Tears welled up in his eyes. He didn't even have to look at Sean, his partner summed up the situation by himself. He took the phone from Holden and just ended the call. \"I wanted to explain, but you were too quick. You just… Holden?\" \"I'm having a shower.\" And he was gone. Holden sat on the sofa with his legs drawn up. He pretended reading, but Sean noticed very well that he hadn't flipped the pages for about an hour now and just stared at some undefined spot on the actual page. \"Holden, we must talk about this.\" He went over and sat down opposite the other man. \"Your mom told me that they wanna see you.\" Holden looked up. \"Good for her. How did they find me anyway? I mean…\" \"Baby, everyone in this country with the slightest bit of interest in football knows about us. And putting two and two together they will assume that you live with me. And you told me that your dad is a football fan, so…\" \"Right. But Sean, I don't think that I want that.\" Holden looked at him with pleading eyes. Sean sighed and crawled over. He put his hand on his partner's thigh and fondly squeezed it. \"It's your decision. Yours only. But maybe they're really sorry. You should give them a chance. And even if it's just for closing this case forever. Nothing happens without a reason. And you never know, maybe they surprise you.\" He could see Holden's skeptical look. \"You know that he beat the hell out of me when I was 16. They banned me. I can't forget that just because they call twenty years later and say 'Hey, we think we wanna visit you!'\" \"I know! Believe me, I do. But as I said, everyone deserves a second chance. You gave me a second chance two months ago, when I came out. After the way I treated you the years before, I wasn't sure you'd come back to me.\" \"Oh Sean, please. That is something completely different! I knew that you loved me!\" \"What tells you that your parents don't regret everything? What tells you that they haven't been thinking about the fact that you are their only son and that they love you?\" \"You can't be serious, Sean.\" \"But are you sure that they don't regret?\" Holden stared at him. He had no exact answer to that. He wasn't sure. \"I would see it in their eyes I guess.\" \"Ok. Does that mean you wanna see them?\" Holden looked surprised, either by this question or his own subconscious decision to meet his parents. \"Yeah, I guess.\" \"Ok.\" Sean got up to prepare the dinner. \"Oh, what I wanted to tell you. Those calls over the last few days, you know?\" Holden nodded. \"It was your mom. She told me. She didn't know how to start…\" Holden nodded again. \"You'll be here, right?\" Sean turned around and smiled at him. \"Of course!\" \"Good.\" It wasn't easy for Holden to fight his inner demons and see his parents, but maybe Sean was right. He wanted to hear what they had to say about their behavior towards their only child. And if they hadn't an explanation – which was the more likely option – maybe he could finally put it behind after that. He didn't know how he would endure this evening, but he knew that Sean would stand behind him. He took a deep breath. He hadn't slept the whole night and now couldn't stop fumbling with the edge of his shirt. Initially he wanted to wear a suit but then decided against it. Who was he trying to impress. And well, they wouldn't be impressed anyway. He was an office sitter, not a doer! He wasn't… God, why did the self-doubts crawl back into his head right now? The doorbell rang and his heart leapt into his throat. Sean opened the door, welcomed them and asked them in. When his mother saw him she smiled and headed up to him. She wore simple jeans and a washed out red blouse. Her ashy hair was tied up in a ponytail. Holden didn't move. 'The time hasn't done her good. She looks worn out and tired.' The stubborn child in him didn't want to feel for her but she really didn't look well. When she reached Holden, she hesitantly hugged him. He didn't hug back, just put a hand on her shoulder for a second and then stepped back from her. This felt as awkward as he had imagined it. \"Holden, you've become such a handsome young man.\" The only reaction he had for her was a forced smile. Then he looked at his father who was right behind her and he automatically gritted his teeth. \"Son.\" When the older man reached out his hand and Holden raised his own to join the handshake he had to suppress the shivering. His mind made him feel like the 16 year old boy again. It was awful. Sean obviously sensed that the atmosphere had absolutely plummeted. He made them have a seat at the dining table and started a small talk. It was tough and tedious in the beginning, but then Holden's mother started to tell how they learned where Holden lives now and that he is together with Sean. After a few minutes she came to an end. \"As I said, we saw the press conference and then the pictures of you two. We couldn't believe it. Our son and Sean Jackson. You really have a good taste Holden.\" His father had been very quiet so far but now chimed in. \"Yeah, he's one of the best quarterbacks at the moment. Sean, do you remember that game in Houston last year? You really saved it man. I didn't believe you could do it, but you did ! A real football star! The others are football players, you're a star ! I always knew that you have the potential. When you were playing in Boston in your early years, I swear I saw it back then!\" Sean uneasily shifted around on his chair. He glanced at Holden who seemed to take deeper and deeper breaths with every of his father's words. The footballer stood up, a bit too quick maybe. \"Anyone want a coffee?\" Without waiting for an answer he headed to the coffee machine. Maybe he was hoping the talk about him would stop. But Holden's father didn't seem to care that Sean had left the table. He wallowed in his memories of the great games Sean had during his time as a pro so far. Holden had listened patiently and now waited for their apology to him, it had to come. His parents didn't come here for that , right? When he raised his voice he couldn't be friendly, he didn't even try it. \"So, you're here for small talk? For worshipping Sean and football? You could have written a letter. Or just have met him at a game or when I would have been at work. Don't you think you have something to tell me ?\" He put as much disappointment as possible into his voice for the last question, which wasn't difficult because he was disappointed. His mom looked down at the table and kept quiet. His father looked at him with reproach, probably because he had interrupted his praising. Then the older man unwillingly started with what sounded like an apology. That he didn't mean it. That it had been the shock making him do what he did. That it was a different time then and gays – that was a hard word for him, everyone could see it – gays weren't as accepted as today. \"I'm sorry.\" Two other words that obviously didn't pass his lips easily. There was a certain glance in his eyes, but Holden couldn't hold the eye contact long enough to interpret it. He still was intimidated. A feeling started growing in him. Was it hope? Hope for being acknowledged? Or even loved? He swallowed. If Sean was the key to his own parents, to his father, why wouldn't he take this opportunity? Sooner or later they would see what their son had blossomed into. They would see what they've missed. He inhaled deeply. He just had remembered the last time he had seen his father before he was taken to the hospital, seen his face in the dim light on the porch, his disgust, his hate and his desperation because Holden wasn't the son he had wished for. His mother hadn't even left the house. No! They couldn't get away with a 'We're sorry, those were different times.' Not after what they did to him. Not after the twenty years of nothing. Holden mentally pushed the hope away and tried not to listen to it. Something was wrong. His dad had apologized, yes. But only because he literally had forced him to do it. And this annoyed look before. Nothing had changed. He raised his eyes. 'Mom really looks bad.' He looked back on his hands. No! No hope and no sympathy. Not even pity! He couldn't forgive them, because they didn't want to be forgiven. It became more and more obvious with every word out of his father's mouth. Was he really talking about one of the then neighbors' boys who he still had contact with? Oh right, he played basketball. That's a pretty good reason to love him. Holden swallowed again. The air was so stifling. Sweat started to shine on his forehead. He wanted to get out of here. Run, just run. It would be easy. He could stand up, go on the terrace, open the door and would be free. Free to run. Or to swim. Yes, swimming was even better. He would see nothing but the horizon. He wouldn't look back, just swim out. Would hear nothing but the water around him and some seagulls. Seagulls, that didn't lie to him about how sorry they are and justify their actions with 'different times'. Or tell him what a handsome young man he had become. Tell him that now all of a sudden he was a good boy because of the partner he had chosen. Tell him that… He breathed deeply. No, he couldn't get out of here. He was trapped in his own house. With the man he loved more than anything in this world, but also with the two people he hated the most. But didn't he want just love from them at the same time? He felt the first signals of a headache coming up. But he had to be strong. The 'talk' would return to Sean and his great accomplishments and he would just have to sit and wait. Wait for them to leave. So he could let in some fresh air. Salty air from the ocean. He wanted to be in the ocean so bad. No, we already had that, no swimming for Holden today. Not now. Be strong. He looked out of the window and saw a seagull flying past the house. And smiled. \"Holden?\" The familiar voice woke him from his daydream. He looked around. All eyes were on him now. \"What?\" Sean gently smiled at him. \"Your mom brought some photos of you as a child. You don't wanna look at them? You were such a cute boy!\" Holden stared at the pictures in front of him. A little blond boy with huge blue eyes smiled at him. But something wasn't right. And by looking at every single one he remembered. None of those were taken by his parents. All of them showed him at a friend's birthday party or in the summer camp. That's why the cute little boy was smiling. Was happy. And with showing those photos around, they could pretend having been good parents? Were they really convinced that they had done a great job at raising him? He had to get out, to hell with being strong. He got up. Didn't choose the way to his beloved ocean though, because Sean would probably follow him. He needed an option with a door. A door that he could lock behind him. Without saying another word he went upstairs. When he had passed half the way he heard a chair moving and he knew that it was Sean's. \"Don't!\" was the only thing he could bring out. And his partner stayed. After closing and locking the bedroom door, Holden instantly felt sorry for leaving Sean alone with them. But he had never been selfish, always had put everybody's needs above his own. This time it was his turn. He needed to be alone, away from them . And he was now. He got naked and stepped into the shower. It wasn't the ocean, but it was water. At least something. Holden was in the shower for over twenty minutes by now. Sitting on the bed with his back against the bedhead, waiting for him, Sean recalled the day. When he had opened the door and looked into the eyes of Holden's dad, he knew where his partner had those amazing blue eyes from. But they weren't quite the same. The thing that always struck Sean most with Holden's eyes beside their color and those irresistible sparkles in them was their warmth . No matter how mad or angry he had ever been, one look into those eyes calmed him down and made him melt. Sean knew what was missing in the older man's look – this warmth. It made the light blue glance very cold. And though the man was obviously admiring him, Sean felt kind of uncomfortable around him. Holden's mom was quite shy and unremarkable. But from what Holden had told him she was not the woman having an own opinion. Yeah, that's exactly what she looked like. Everything about this 'family reunion' had been pretty awkward. Yep, that's the perfect word to describe the evening – awkward. Poor Holden. When even Sean felt like that, what the hell must go on in his mind. Thank God they had left immediately after Holden had disappeared. Empty phrases like 'It's late anyway.' and 'We still have some miles to drive.' were shared and they were gone. Ah, the water finally had stopped. A moment later his partner came out of the bathroom just with a towel around his waist. He looked so miserable and lost. Sean reached out his hand. \"Come here.\" While making his way to him, Holden started apologizing. \"I'm so sorry for leaving you alone. But… I couldn't stay in there any longer. I just couldn't. The indifference in his voice, as if nothing had ever happened… Those photos…\" He reached Sean and crawled into his arms, embracing him as tightly as possible. \"I couldn't be strong.\" \"Holden! Don't tell me you weren't strong! You haven't seen them like forever and now you sat there face to face. That can be overwhelming. You made a big step towards them. But you're right, it was a bit too much talk about… too much…\" \"Too much talking about you? Yes. I think I have to accept the fact that you're the real reason why they wanted to meet, Sean. It's not me. Not their son. It's the football star I live with.\" Sean sighed. \"Hey. Don't say that, love. They tried, they really did. They want you to have the photos, they're in the living room. That's a gesture, right? I'd say they are really sorry and wanna make up for it.\" Sean didn't feel confident in what he was saying there. But if he'd show the slightest hint of a doubt, Holden would never agree to another meeting with them. And that would be so wrong. Sean still couldn't understand what Holden's father had done to his son, and never would. But they were his parents, for God's sake. His mom gave birth to him, they raised him. It was just impossible that there wasn't any love left. This first get-together was a flop, yes. But he wanted Holden to be happy – and this has been everything but that. They needed to give it another try. He looked down on Holden who had already fallen asleep. Sean carefully removed the half-wet towel from him and covered his naked body with the light sheets. Then he tiptoed into the bathroom and returned after a quick wash. He didn't want Holden to be alone now. Slipping under the sheets he took his partner in his arms. \"You're safe baby, safe. No matter what.\" Holden didn't wake up, but snuggled up to Sean in a natural movement. Sean ran his fingertips over his forearm, enjoying the slight tingling of the hair on it. But with the feeling of his lover's even breath against his neck he finally dozed off too. Holden had no idea why he was here. The first meeting, or better the fiasco with his parents was just a week ago. And now he was sitting here with Sean next to him in a quiet little restaurant, waiting for them. He didn't even know how Sean had managed to persuade him to do this. Well ok, he knew it. His partner was great in talking him into things. But he also got the goddess of persuasion on board, Kathy. His secretary had been after him the whole week. Yesterday she told him how important it was to get back in the saddle again and try it just once more. In the saddle? Really? He laughed about it, but she grabbed his arm and made him sit down on the sofa in his office. When he saw her dead serious eyes he knew he had to listen to her. \"Mr. Wilson. Pease give it a try. They are your parents, the only parents you have.\" Holden wanted to bring up Sean's mom and dad, but kept silent. He knew what she was trying to say. She continued. \"You know that I love working for you. And not only because you're a great boss.\" Holden smiled at her. \"But because you are a great person. You deserve having parents that love you. And maybe they do and just couldn't show it that day. I'm sure it was strange for them too… meeting you after all those years.\" He looked into her eyes for a while and for a few seconds he tried to believe her. He couldn't however, he knew his parents better. But he was touched that she cared for him. Her care and Sean's countless attempts at persuasion resulted in him sitting here. He sighed. His left leg nervously bobbed up and down until Sean placed his hand on it and gently stroked it. Holden smiled at him and leaned against his shoulder. He closed his eyes and for a moment he wished that they wouldn't come, that it would just be Sean and him for dinner. Someone markedly cleared his throat. Opening his eyes Holden recognized his dad who now tried to look in any direction but theirs. He obviously had a hard time handling the innocent moment of affection between them. Holden shook his head. 'Yeah dad, you're right. I lean against his shoulder. Wow. I could just as well hump him on the table! Would be the same for you, wouldn't it?' Nevertheless he parted from Sean and sat straight. His parents sat down and Holden tried to fight his slightly confrontational mood down. No, he didn't feel weak today… which was good. Maybe it was due to the fresh air, they had been placed outside. Seeing his dad exclusively talking to Sean and completely ignoring him – like he used to do as long as Holden could think – and his mother hanging on his every word, made it clear. They would never be his parents, not the parents he had wished for. Being honest he already knew it since their first meeting. But that evening had completely overstrained him, because at that time his little old friend 'hope' was still living in his mind. It had made him weak. But he was sick of being weak. Somewhere along the line between then and today, sweet little 'hope' had been kicked out by his new friends, 'sense of reality' and 'fuck you'. As expected the talk was mostly about football again, but this time Holden was prepared for it. He and his new friends saw it with gallows humor. At least he had something to eat. They wanted something. Not from him, that was obvious. So the only one remaining was Sean. Holden was almost excited when his dad would come up with it. 'What is it dad? What do you want?' When his father got up and went to the restroom, his mom, who sat opposite him and again hadn't contributed much to the conversation so far, leaned over the table. \"How is your work doing, Holden?\" Holden stared at her with disbelief. \"Are you kidding me, mom? For over an hour you don't talk to me and now that he's away you come up with that?\" \"You know your dad, Holden. All he wants to talk is sport. So I just thought…\" \"Oh stop it.\" With that an awkward silence came up and remained until his dad came back. He spread an atmosphere of departure though. \"It has become late. But, Sean… I just wanted to ask you a favor.\" He nestled at the bag he had placed behind him. Holden almost felt relieved, he was right. Sean looked at him. The surprise in his eyes couldn't be overseen. \"Sure.\" Holden squinted his eyes when his dad pulled out plenty of glossy prints with Sean in his gear on them. They were followed by ten of his team's caps. \"Would you mind to sign these few things?\" Sean was apparently confused, but stayed astonishingly calm. \"Ehm, okayyy… any name on it?\" \"No it's ok, just sign it…\" The older man prepared the pen for him. Holden stared at Sean who started scribbling his name on the prints. \"What the fuck? I can't believe it.\" His partner looked somewhat helpless but Holden just shook his head. \"I'm waiting in the car.\" He glowered at his dad, took the keys out of Sean's pants pocket and left. They hadn't talked at all on the way home. When they finally arrived, Holden went straight up into the bedroom and prepared for going to sleep. Sean followed him and did the same. Pulling off his clothes he looked at his partner. \"Holden, could we please talk? What is it?\" Holden snorted. \"Come on Sean. Do me a favor and try to think with me. The stuff you signed today, what do you think, is he doing with it? Hm? Exactly! He will sell it! To the highest bidder.\" Sean looked honestly off-guard. \"No, I don't believe that.\" \"Sean. You don't know my dad. I do !\" All of a sudden his anger directed against his partner and he couldn't do anything against it. \"Anyway… where is your rage from three years ago when you first heard the story of my fucked up youth? If he had been there back then, you would have done 'God-knows-what' to him. You would have stood by my side. But today… you developed into his merchandize-signing cash cow!\" \"Holden! What…\" \"No, you know I'm right!\" Holden flopped onto his side of the bed. Sean lay down and closed the distance between them. \"I just tried to be friendly. I'm sorry if I hurt you with that. Come on love... please.\" Holden sighed and Sean continued. \"And according to the things… We both know he is a fan. Maybe the stuff is for his friends.\" Holden snorted and turned his back to him, hectically sorting his blanket. \"Friends. Yeah right. 40 close friends who all want your signed photo. And since my dad knows you, they surely don't want their name on it. You're so naïve.\" With that the conversation was over. Sean returned to his side of the bed and stared out of the window. After a while Holden thought about talking about this argument but dropped it. He was right. When Holden arrived at the office the next morning, after a night with no sleep at all, he was happy that Kathy wasn't at her desk. She would have asked about how the second meeting had been and that was the last thing he wanted to talk about right now. He had something else in his mind. He started the computer and waited for the internet connection to build up. \"Sean is too good for this world, and definitely too good for my parents!\" After flipping through some online portals and stores he found what he was looking for. The ink on the photos wasn't dry yet and his dad offered them for sale, way overpriced. \"So they're making good money. I knew it.\" They didn't want to make up for his childhood and for the way they had treated him when he came out to them. They just abused him as go-between to Sean, the great football star. Well, he wasn't even a go-between, they barely talked to him anyway. They just wanted to reap profit out of Sean. He felt tears running down his cheeks. 'Wait, what is that now? I thought, we had left that behind?' Dammit. Why could everybody he knew love him except his own parents? He buried his face in his hands and stayed like that for a while. When he looked back up the tears had dried already. That was it. They had overstepped the mark. \"You try to treat me like I don't exist and abuse Sean as source of income? No dad, not anymore.\" \"Why are we meeting your parents again? I didn't think that you would want that after last time.\" Sean looked confused and suspicious. Holden hadn't told him about what he had found out. He wanted to confront his parents with it right in front of him. \"I just wanna clarify some things. You'll see.\" The doorbell rang and Holden went to let his parents in. They took a seat on the sofa and Holden started right away. \"Dad, what were the prints and caps for the other day?\" His father seemed surprised by the direct question and started stuttering while searching for an answer. \"You sell the stuff, right?\" Holden continued shooting. Sean looked at him and then at his dad. The older man sat straight and looked at Holden with this cold gaze he knew so well. \"Yeah. Why not? He's a football star, why not make a bit money with it? What do you care?\" Holden snorted and looked at Sean, who shook his head. \"What do I care? You are so unbelievable. But you won't do that. You don't come here with your fake apology and reap profit out of us!\" Holden got up and started talking himself into a rage. \"I knew it! I so knew it when you stepped through that door for the first time! Twenty years… shit! And now that you know I'm together with a football star, you remember having a son? After fucking twenty years of nothing? You call yourself a father? Or a mother?\" His mom started crying but his father got upset, exactly the reactions he had imagined. \"Holden, watch your words. We raised you.\" \"So you're telling me I owe you something?\" The young man panted. \" Fuck you man! You didn't even talk to me when I proved to be the son with no interest in sports and all this 'man stuff'. It was like I didn't exist from the age of 5. You and her-\", he pointed at his mother, \"you gave me food and clothes. But that is not raising a child! You know what? I know Sean's parents for a month now… and they've given me more love and support than you did in those damn sixteen years I've lived with you! You gave me nothing but the feeling of being useless scum not worth the effort. Fuck!\" Tears flooded his eyes, but he had to get it out now. \"So I should honor you as parents? You remember what happened at the end of your oh so great raising, don't you? You beat the crap out of me and threw me out on the street like a rotten piece of shit. Thank you dad , thanks for that! And mom, thank you too. For doing nothing when he beat me down and broke my ribs and nose with his boots to kick the 'gay' out of me. For looking right into my eyes when he lashed me with his belt and finally knocked me out! You didn't do anything to stop him. You truly love me, I'm sure. So what do I owe you? Nothing !\" Holden finally wiped off the tears that were pouring down his face. He barely could see the two people in front of him. Expressing the rediscovered hate for them was relieving, but it also had taken all his energy. He had to leave the room, breathing the same air as them made him feel sick. He also didn't want to hear any answer – it would be a lie or bad excuse anyway. When he had passed the sofa his dad got up. \"So, what do we see here? A grown up man crying and fleeing from confrontations again. You've been weak all your life. You were as a kid and you are now. And blaming it all on us is so easy, isn't it? But it's your fault, you decided to be a disgrace for us. And now you even dragged Sean Jackson into this environment .\" Holden slowly turned around. His blue eyes were as cold as ice as he stared at his dad. He started shaking. After two more deep breaths he jumped at his father and pushed him to the ground. The pure rage made him hit the older man. Again and again. Didn't listen to his mother screaming. Didn't really notice Sean trying to get him off his father. He just couldn't stop. Soon blood started to splatter all over them and the floor. He didn't know whether it was from his father's bruised face or his own grazed knuckles. And he didn't care. This felt so good… no, it was unbelievably fucking fantastic. He heard himself laughing while his tears dropped on his dad's bloody shirt. 'Is this the feeling of going mental?' His hard punches were still not missing their target when he felt his partner's strong arms trying to interfere again. Sean tried to draw his partner off the other man as soon as he woke up from the shock. But he had underestimated Holden's strength which of course was multiplied by the hate for his father. He was like a predator not willing to let go of its prey. Sean knew he would beat his father up until he didn't move anymore. He wasn't sure that Holden would stop even then! That thought gave him chills and he once more collected all his strength. Finally he could yank his partner to the side. Once he had him he put him into a firm grip and forced him to the ground with his own weight. \" Holden calm down! He's not worth it! \" The man underneath him kicked with his feet and bucked against him to get free again. Sean had never seen Holden like that before. He felt every muscle in his partner's body tensed and ready to attack his father again. All this aggression. But he gave Holden no other choice. After a few more seconds he finally capitulated and stopped fighting against Sean, panting for air, eyes closed now. The footballer, still sitting on Holden and fixing his arms just in case, turned to see how the older man was doing. His wife now knelt by his side trying to clean his face with a tissue, but he pushed her away. He sat up, wiped the blood off his eyes with his sleeve and stared at Holden with the one eye he still could open. His face was a total mess. But he was conscious. Sean focused on Holden again. \"Can I let you out of this? You won't attack him once more, right? The old man's had enough.\" Holden seemed thinking about it. Sean could see his inner fight. But then his breath slowed down to a normal degree. \"Ok.\" Sean lifted himself up and helped Holden on his feet. He looked worn out as hell and his bloody hand was shaking. The footballer noticed that it started swelling. Some bones in it were probably broken by the sheer force of his punches. \"Still call me weak, dad?\" Holden's voice was calm, but the hate in his eyes was still there. \"Look in the mirror and tell me again that I'm weak. This seems to be the only 'language' you understand.\" His father wanted to say something, but Holden cut him off. \"Shut up! Don't say a fucking word! I have achieved so much in my life. I have a great job and an even greater man by my side. I finally know what it means to have a home and a family. And having parents that love me. I don't need you. We don't need you.\" He breathed deeply. \"And now get the fuck out of our house!\" He passed his parents without looking at them and disappeared upstairs. After Holden's speech and the fight afterwards the house now was frighteningly quiet. Sean stayed silent when Holden's parents collected themselves and where about to leave. When they were in the hallway he overheard something the man mumbled. \"He's strong… but he has no respect.\" Sean grabbed him by the shoulder and turned him around \"Wait what? What did you just say?\" He stared at the old man. \"You're talking about respect? Your teenage boy came to you and told you he is gay, because he trusted you and you beat him up and tell me something about respect ? You insinuate yourselves into our confidence to make fucking money out of me and tell me something about respect ? Then you insult your son in his own house and call our lifestyle 'environment'… and tell me something about respect ? Let me tell you something before you leave forever. You two don't deserve him as son. He is the most wonderful person I have ever met, all good and strong and endearing. Now that I know you, I think it's a miracle that he could grow into the man that he is. Thank God your environment couldn't poison his beautiful soul.\" He focused Holden's dad now. \"And the next time he decides to kick your ass I swear I won't stop him. And now… what were his words… get the fuck out of our house!\" The still bleeding man wanted to say something but decided against it. They left without another word. When he had closed the door behind them, Sean took a deep breath. All his thoughts revolved around Holden now, so he rushed up the stairs to see how he was doing. \"Ouch. Fuck.\" Holden's hand still hurt like a bitch, though it was almost a week ago now. The doctor in the hospital where Sean had brought him had put his hand in plaster and told him to keep it still for at least three weeks. He was handicapped anyway, since it was his right hand, so he didn't go to work. No, he enjoyed being at home and being cared for by his partner. Sean was really sweet, he complied with his every wish... though he didn't have many. He just asked for an extra kiss here and there. And he made Sean cook for him, every day. To his own surprise he didn't feel bad about what he had done to his dad. Ok, he didn't feel brilliant either. Beating someone up normally was under his niveau, but too much is too much. He was at peace now. He would never see those people again. He heard Sean coming home from running some errands. But who was he talking too? Holden was too lazy to get up from the sofa, he decided just to wait. But then he recognized the familiar voices beside Sean's. He jumped up – almost forgot not to support himself on his bad hand. He sneaked around the corner and a grin popped up on his face. \"Christine! Eric! What are you doing here? I thought you were coming next weekend.\" He rushed over and embraced both of them. Sean's mom inspected his hand as soon as she let him out of her hug. \"Sean called and told us that you need some cheering up. And… here we are.\" Eric patted his shoulder. \"So, what happened?\" Holden looked at Sean and put all the thankfulness he could into his smile. The other man nodded and brought his parents' luggage into the guestroom. Holden went into the kitchen to make some coffee, but Christine headed him off. \"Don't you dare to do anything for us, Holden Wilson. Get back on the couch and let me make the coffee. Eric!\" Her husband got the hint and guided Holden to the sofa. \"You have to rest, boy.\" When Sean joined them again and they had something to drink and Christine's wonderful brownies to eat, Holden looked at the Jackson family with a satisfied smile. When Sean returned the smile he sighed. \"Christine, you remember the last time we visited you and Sean told you I'm not used to so much mother love?\" She looked at him with curiosity. \"Yes. And your eyes told me not to ask you about it.\" She gave him a warm smile when he choked back the tears. Holden slightly nodded and put his cup on the table. Then he started telling his story. Christine and Eric got up at the same time and sat down on both of Holden's sides. He hadn't been crying while telling, he really was kind of proud of himself. And even when they both hugged him now, all he could do was smile. A hardly known feeling started spreading in him. 'This must be what it feels like… being loved by his parents.' Sean got up and tousled his hair to lighten up the emotional scenario. \"Welcome to the Jackson's. We're a clan of huggers.\" Holden chuckled. \"I see. I'd love to join.\" Sean's parents parted from him. Holden could see that Christine had to fight back the tears. She sighed deeply and took his hands into her own. \"You have a family now. And parents that love you for who you are – a wonderful man and our son's partner. We will always love you, no matter what.\" \"Thank you… mom.\" ~~FIN~~","LastChapter":"\"Sean come on, you want us to miss the flight?\" Sean muttered by the new interruption. He pinned his lover down to the bed using his whole bodyweight. It was Holden's third try to get up, but again he failed. Ok, he had to admit it, those tries had been less than half-hearted. He loved feeling Sean's warm skin on his own, the demanding hands, the lustful glint in the other man's eyes. Sean mumbled some unintelligible words into his neck while kissing it. Sounded a bit like \"we'll take … next … want ya now!\" Holden wasn't sure about the first part of that, but when Sean ran his fingers through his hair and slowly tugged his head back into the pillow to kiss his Adam's apple it was pretty clear that he got the 'want ya now' part accurately. The footballer returned to the left side of Holden's neck and started sucking in the soft skin, very gentle at first but he intensified very quickly. Holden bit his lower lip and sighed out a moan when he felt Sean's teeth capturing his flesh. He glanced at the clock - they still had almost four hours until the flight. 'Ok then, no breakfast.' Tenderly ruffling Sean's hair he guided him down. Sean followed obediently and loosened his grip now that he was sure that Holden would stay in bed. Still lying on him Sean framed his lover's sides with his arms and took his time for covering the sensitive skin of his chest with kisses. The fine line of hair along Holden's stomach directed his lips down. After making another moisty stopover, this time at his abs, the footballer finally disappeared under the sheets. \" God !\" Holden grabbed the mattress with one hand and added to the pressure on Sean's head with the other to make him take in as much of his length as possible. 'Why would I want breakfast if I can have this !' Holden brought down their bag for the weekend. Sean was still in the shower so he decided to make them at least a coffee for the drive to the airport, the taxi should arrive in 15 minutes. Holden was just switching the machine on when the telephone rang. On his way through the room he slipped into the T-shirt Sean had ironed yesterday evening. He smiled thinking about the explanation his partner had for doing so. \" Mom has ironed all of my clothes when I was a kid, and I wanna show her that I learned that for life.\" \" Sean, you haven't ironed anything as long as I know you. I'm wondering that you know where the flatiron is stowed away!\" He laughed at the face his partner made and contentedly leaned back with a wide grin on his face. \"Sean Jackson is cheating his mom, I can't believe it!\" \" I'm not cheating her! Just… starting again with good old habits!\" Holden could see that not even Sean himself believed what he was saying there. He stepped behind him and grabbed his tight waist with both hands, leaning against his back and putting his chin on his shoulder. \"So, will you iron my shirts for work from now on? I don't want you to be bored with just our T-shirts.\" Sean snorted but continued his task. \"No, I won't. I mean, I could… Ok well, you got me. You know, as long as I can remember she keeps asking if I'm doing well living on my own and stuff. And maybe she recognizes by things like this that I'm grown up and can take care of myself. It's stupid, I know.\" \" A bit yeah. But well, she won't ask anymore. She knows that you have me now. Of course she thinks you're doing well from now on.\" Holden stated seriously. \" You're a jerk.\" \" Right back at you.\" They couldn't keep straight faces any longer and shared a laugh. Sean turned around and looked at Holden with steel-blue puppy dog eyes. \"Can I be honest with you? I hate ironing. Your shirt is done. Is it ok that you will look flawless tomorrow and I won't? I can't make one more move with this thing, let alone a whole shirt.\" Holden didn't answer. With a knowing smile on his face he took the flatiron out of Sean's hand, pulled the plug and put it in a safe place to cool off. Then he took his partner's hand and drew him upstairs. \"We better go to bed, before you're too tired for another good old habit.\" The sparkle in Sean's eyes showed him that he didn't need to be any more specific. Holden had reached the phone and looked on the display. \"'Phone number withheld', okayyy.\" He accepted the call. \"Hello.\" He heard some slight noises on the other end, but got no answer. \"Helloooo…\" Nothing. \"Ok then, thanks for calling. Maybe you have something to say next time.\" He ended the call but kept looking on the display, 'that was strange, I swear I heard something.' Warm lips on his neck and two strong arms embracing his waist made him forget his thoughts. \"Who did you call? Hopefully not my mom to tell her we can't make it. You would break her heart.\" Sean chuckled. \"She loves you to death!\" Holden turned around in his arms. \"No, it was an incoming one, someone probably dialed the wrong number, he could at least have apologized. But aaanyway… I never would cancel the weekend! I can't wait to see your parents again. They were so lovely the other day. I still can't believe you were afraid telling them you're gay. I only met them once, but I feel that I could share almost everything with them. It's like I've known them forever.\" Sean smiled at him. \"Yeah. Hm… I don't know if I'm allowed to tell you, but they mentally adopted you when they saw you for the first time. At least my mom did!\" Holden giggled and blushed. Sean looked right into his eyes now. \"I love you Holden. Everything is so much easier now that it's out. I was an idiot.\" \"You were !\" Sean was about to protest, but before he could say something Holden cupped his face with his hands and kissed him. \"But not anymore.\" They just stood there arm in arm smiling at each other for a moment, then both startled by the noise of a honking car. \"Our taxi.\" \"Yeah.\" One deep breath and another smile later they finally parted and left the house. The flight from LAX to SFO would take about 1.20 h. Ten minutes after take-off Sean had dozed off. His head rested on Holden's shoulder, their entwined hands on his thigh. Holden couldn't sleep. While looking out of the window he thought about how his life had changed during the last two months. Before this year's Valentine's Day Holden practically 'didn't exist', their life as a couple was limited to the house. He never attended any public event with Sean. They didn't even drive to the supermarket together nor had a walk at the beach. When they went out for dinner, which rarely happened - only when Sean was tired of hearing Holden's begging anymore, he always was his estate agent when he was asked. He remembered one recent dinner in particular. They just had ordered their drinks when a lady of Sean's management saw them from another table and came over to say hello. It was pure torture for Holden to see the couple next to them holding hands and showing their love to the world, while Sean talked to that woman and called him 'Mr. Wilson'. He politely smiled at her despite his feelings. It was part of the game. Holden sighed. But now he was a part of Sean's life, his entire life. It was so exciting to finally get to know the team and his friends. And most of them were so cool about it and were happy for them. While being hugged and clapped on the shoulder they heard a lot of ' I knew it ' and ' I never bought that estate agent story, one look into your eyes said it all '. The minor rest wasn't that enthusiastic, but accepted it. Which was fine with Holden. Sean's fans were wonderful too. Well, most likely there were some folks that were not very happy to see their favorite football player with a guy on his side… comes with the territory, you can't please everybody. But those people thankfully kept quiet. Holden remembered when they attended this huge fundraising dinner. It was their very first official appearance as a couple. He was so nervous and almost hadn't the guts to get out of the limousine that had picked them up from home and stopped at the red carpet now. He could see that Sean felt the same. Neither their flawless black suits and ties nor the rest of their well-groomed appearance could hide the tension. But then Sean took his hand and kissed his palm. His eyes assured that everything was good and they finally got out of the car. Being the boss of about 200 people and having to deal with his clients, most of them important and / or rich, Holden wasn't a shy person. At least that's what he had thought until now. This scenario however was insane, and very intimidating. The people went nuts. They were screaming like he and Sean were some kind of rock stars. Right, they cheered for him too, ridiculous. Sean immediately flipped the switch and was right in his element, he was used to being cheered at. With a perfect grin on his face he took Holden's hand and waved at the crowd with the other. Meanwhile Holden really had to concentrate on smiling and not looking like a timid fawn in the light cone of a car. And it worked. With the help of his self-soothing - well… breathing - , Sean's closeness and the fact that they were frenetically reveled he finally calmed down and started soaking up the atmosphere. He had to admit it… it gave him quite a rush. The photographers at this event were as crazy as the fans. Holden had never been snapped that often in his whole life as in these ten minutes on the red carpet. Even half an hour later he still saw white little stars dancing in front of his eyes. Then the paparazzi. Their creativity to get ' the shot ' was both fascinating and annoying. During the first three weeks after Sean's coming out they were everywhere. He and Sean had a hard time to live a halfway normal life. Holden couldn't go to work and come back home without being photographed. But eventually everybody had calmed down. The people apparently had read enough 'Quarterback Sean Jackson's boyfriend is leaving their love nest' articles. He snorted and shook his head. Then he looked down on his partner. 'So peaceful.' He sighed and gently kissed his hair. Sean responded with a deep breath. When Holden looked back up, his eyes met the glance of a redheaded teenage boy sitting in the seat row to their right. He smiled at him. The boy startled a bit like he felt getting caught staring at them. But then he smiled back with a light flush on his cheeks which brought out his freckles even more. \"Hi.\" The flush disappeared as quickly as it came. \"I saw you on TV and in the mags. It's a pretty cool thing what he did at that press conference.\" He pointed at Sean. \"Yeah, it is.\" \"I mean… really… not many would have the balls to come out like this!\" Holden chuckled. \"Sorry, I mean… wouldn't have the courage.\" The boy frowned, obviously worried about his choice of words. \"No, 'balls' is ok – couldn't say it any better.\" Holden grinned. The flush was back. \"My name is Neil.\" \"Hey Neil, nice to meet ya.\" The seemingly same-aged girl next to Neil rolled her eyes and hit his arm. \"Ask him already!\" The boy frowned at her, but she didn't seem to care. Instead she leaned over his lap which made her wild red locks fall into her face. Puffing it out of her sight she addressed the amused Holden. \"Hi, I'm his sister. Neil is gay, he has a huge crush on you two and wants to ask if he could take a photo with you. He thinks you're hot, which is true by the way. If you do it, I want a pic with you as well.\" \"Audrey, shut the fuck up!\" He pushed her back into her seat and hung his head in shame. He was blushing crimson now. Holden tried not to wake Sean with his chuckling. \"Okaaay… I think we can do that. The photo thing. We should wait until he wakes up though, what do you think?\" The boy giggled and looked bashfully at the ground. \"Probably better, yeah. Thanks.\" Then he glanced back at Holden and shrugged his shoulders. \"Sorry for my sister… family !\" \"Yeah. No problem, it's ok.\" Holden looked down on their hands in his lap, still smiling. \"Family.\" When the flight attendants started serving drinks and snacks Sean woke up from a seemingly very healthy nap. He yawned and stretched and before Holden knew it grabbed his face and kissed him. And kissed more intense with every passing second. When he felt his partner's tongue sliding into his mouth Holden backed off. \"Sean!\" The football player grinned. \"What! You wanted me to openly show my love for you.\" \"Yeah, but not all of it… on a plane .\" Holden raised an eyebrow. But he couldn't help grinning back. \"You want a coffee, gentlemen?\" They simultaneously looked up to the stewardess and simultaneously replied with a \"No, thank you\". All three shared a smile and she moved on. Sean took Holden's hand again and slightly massaged it. \"I didn't wanna bring it up again at first, but… I've been thinking about this phone call today. You know… it wasn't the first one. He or she called twice already, at least I guess it's the same person.\" Holden frowned. \"Do you think that could be some weird fan or something? I mean, should we be worried?\" \"It could be a fan yeah, but I think we have nothing to fear from him / her. Let's wait if it stops.\" Holden slowly nodded. \"Ok.\" He wasn't sure if it was ok, but he trusted Sean. He surely could evaluate the situation. But then his face lightened up. \"Oh on a lighter note, let me introduce you to Neil and Audrey.\" The plane had landed and the two men were waiting for their luggage. While the conveyor belt offered them everything but their own bag, Holden leaned against Sean. In the corner of his eye he saw someone waving at them. Sean must have seen it too since he already raised his hand. Holden kept his right arm around his partner's waist but waved back with the left one. Those two kids were really cool. Unbelievable that twins looking alike like them could be such different personalities. Chatting with them had made the rest of the flight really enjoyable. Now they were leaving with their parents and would have a great vacation here in San Francisco. Neil and Audrey, really beautiful names. Finally their bag arrived and they could head to the waiting area where they should meet Sean's parents. On the way out Sean turned his phone back on. Two seconds later it beeped. \"It's a message from mom. 'Hey boys. Take a rental or taxi, explain later.'\" Sean seemed more surprised than worried. \"Taxi or rental, Holden?\" \"Both fine with me. Let's take a cab.\" They didn't directly drive to Sean's parents. He made the taxi driver take them to his old high school at first to show Holden around. Sean had assumed that for a Friday it was too late for any classes and they would be alone. He was wrong. They were overrunning him, asking for autographs and pictures. He was the hometown boy returning to the place where everything had started, so he couldn't refuse. Holden waited patiently, he was used to it by now. The last group of girls even wanted a pic with both men, which was pretty strange according to Holden. He was a Nobody to them. But Sean had already grabbed his hand and tugged him into the visual range of the camera. \"Cheese!\" It took them a good hour to get away from there. After that they had a little sightseeing tour, stopping by at Sean's favorite places of his neighborhood. Holden loved seeing all this and listening to Sean's stories and memories. He had visited San Francisco before, but only for work. He had seen nothing but his hotels and conference rooms. But the city was really pretty… and not just because Sean obviously loved it. When they finally arrived at his parents' house, they paid the driver and wished him luck with his third baby girl – he hadn't talked about anything else during the whole drive, very sweet and amusing. He really loved that little girl. Holden had a look around. It was a lovely, good middle-class neighborhood. Nicely trimmed hedges, green front lawns everywhere, even the trees were cut accurately. He had been here before, but that was his first meeting with Sean's parents and he didn't have an eye for it then. It had been hard enough for him to keep breathing and try to live up to their expectations. This time, being much more confident of their affection, he could take his time to take everything in. So this was the place where Sean was raised. He turned around. Even the house itself radiated nothing but kindness and love. It was a nice two-floor building, painted in a light green. Various flowers in tubs and other plants were perfectly placed to complete the picture. This was a home, a real home . Holden sighed deeply. Fragments of memories of his own childhood crawled into his mind, but he instantly shoved them away. He had promised himself not to think about it. And he wouldn't. Not today. Looking at Sean he could see the concern in the other man's eyes. But as soon as he put on a smile, his partner's features lightened up again, he leaned over and kissed him. \"You're ok?\" \"Yeah.\" The door flew open and Sean's mom rushed out with open arms and a wide grin on her face. Her skirt with a colorful flower print made her look like spring itself. \"Sean! Looks like we see you more often now that you're out of the closet. It's just been a month since our family party and you visit us again !\" She hugged and kissed him. \"Hey darling!\" \"Hey mom!\" Letting her out of his embrace, Sean saw his mother's sparkling eyes when she turned to his right. Following her look he just could smile about the cute sheepish grin Holden had put on. His concern from earlier had disappeared. This was the Holden he wanted to see. Sean slightly shook his head. 'Those two.' His mom gave Holden a long and tight cuddle. \"Hey sweetie. Look at you! You are so gorgeous!\" The young man hugged her and ran his hand over her back. Sean could feel that Holden was still insecure with handling her, but on the other hand he was more than willing to take every gesture of love he could get. Holden finally placed a gentle kiss on her cheek. \"Thanks. You look very pretty today, Christine.\" She tilted backwards and gave him a half pretended half meant angry look. \"Holden, I told you to call me mom.\" Holden wanted to answer, but Sean interfered. \"Mom, give him some time. He knows you for a month now and has just met you once! And he's not used to so much mother love.\" Both of them looked at him. Sean's mom frowned. \"What do you mean?\" Holden put a hand on Sean's chest, \"please… don't.\" He then turned back to her with a slightly afflicted smile and she could read in his eyes not to bring the missing mother love into question, at least for now. She nodded. \"Okayyyy… so boys, sorry we couldn't pick you up from the airport. The car is broken down again. And well… the money doesn't grow on trees, right?\" She nudged Holden who just smiled at her. \"What do you mean with 'again'? Mom, I told you a thousand times to call me when you have a problem. I would have paid the repair or a new car.\" \"Sean, we don't want that. Live off your money.\" \"You don't do that, come on! I love you and of course I wanna help you when you need it.\" He looked at Holden who obviously felt a bit uncomfortable witnessing the little disagreement. Sensing that his partner wanted him to say something he put a hand on Christine's back, \"Sean's right. We'd love to help you out. That's what the family is there for, right?\" \"Right!\" Sean agreed. \"See mom, your sweetie is saying it too.\" Holden made a face but then chuckled. The woman smiled too, \"ok then, let's talk it over with your dad.\" On the way in she skimmed along Holden's chest. \"You iron your T-shirts, Holden? Wow. See Sean, take your boyfriend as an example. He always looks dapper and all spruced up. Look at you! Your shirt is so crinkly, one might think you have been sleeping in it for a week now.\" Holden glanced over to Sean trying not to laugh. The footballer made a face but didn't say anything to defend himself. \"Sure mom. I'll think about it.\" He then addressed his partner with an unmistakably sarcastic undertone. \"Maybe you can show me how to do it, love.\" Holden took his hand and slightly squeezed it. \"Yeah let's see if you can learn it.\" Sean chuckled and closed the distance between them. \"Jerk.\" It was just a whisper into Holden's ear which made the other man grin. Sean's mom however was not amused, both men wondered how she could have heard it anyway. \"Sean Jackson! I don't wanna hear that kind of language!\" She turned to Holden again with a much sweeter, almost lulling voice. \"Don't listen to him sweetie, you're the best that could have happened to him. And no matter what he says, he knows it.\" She put her arm around his waist and guided him into the house. Sean stopped and gazed after them, half amused, half upset. \"Holden, tell her who ironed that shirt.\" He could see his partner whispering something into his mother's ear. They both giggled and turned around. Holden reached out his hand. \"Don't be offended, come on.\" Sean's last try to act huffy yielded to a wide grin. They took him into their midst and went in together. \"Hey Sean. Glad you're here. We haven't seen you that often over the last two years.\" Sean's dad hugged him tightly. \"Yeah dad, mom already mentioned it.\" Sean pursed his lips but instantly smiled when he saw the mischief in his dad's eyes. In that moment Holden entered the living room with Christine. \"Holden, my friend.\" The older man went over, took him into his arms and patted his back. \"How's the house selling doing?\" Holden didn't answer immediately. He took a deep breath and hugged Sean's dad back. He knew it was stupid, but he envied Sean for having parents like this. They were so lovely and kind and… in lack of a better word… wonderful. They've already been very sweet at that family party, but there had been so many people. This weekend they could fully concentrate on each other. That thought made Holden nervous again, he wanted them to like him so badly. But the next second he started chuckling. 'What are you thinking about? Look at them. They both hug you like your own parents never did. How can they not like you?' \"Hey Eric. Business is doing well, thanks.\" With that they parted. \"Dad, mom told me about your car. What do I tell you all the time? You…\" Eric cut his son off. \"Sean, you think you have to help us because we're your parents and you love us.\" Sean inhaled. \"No, let me finish. We know that. We know that you could give us the money and we appreciate that you would do it. But we get along pretty well without it. There's only one thing we want from you. Your love.\" He frowned for a second. \"Ok, maybe there are two things. We also want you to visit your old parents a bit more often than once a year.\" Sean slightly shook his head. \"The car thing isn't off the table yet. But you're right with the rest.\" A conciliating expression appeared on his face. Christine linked arms with Holden again. \"Let's not argue now. I have some freshly baked brownies and an apple pie for us. And now tell us what happened in your life since our last phone call.\" After a funny afternoon with watching tons of photos they enjoyed a delicious dinner – now Holden knew where Sean had his cooking skills from – with a great red wine. For the time after dinner Eric brought out his best scotch. Holden felt like the wine already had been enough for him, but he didn't want to be rude. At about midnight they finally decided that it was time to hit the pillow. Holden got up and instantly felt a bit dizzy. \"Whoops. I guess that was one scotch to many. I think I can't keep up with the Jackson men.\" He smiled at Sean's mom and the two other men who were obviously zero affected by the alcohol. Sean's dad patted his shoulder, \"I don't think that's a bad thing, Holden.\" His hand still on the younger man's shoulder he smiled at his son now, \"you better put him to bed, Sean. I need him fresh and not hungover tomorrow. Wanna show him my new building project.\" Curiosity fought its way through the dizziness in Holden's head. \"Project?\" Sean knew from a phone call with his mother what his dad was talking about. He rolled his eyes and dragged Holden out of the living room. \"I'll tell you later, bear. Niiiiight!\" But Holden managed to squirm himself out of Sean's grip. \"I'm tipsy, but not bad-mannered.\" He made his way over to his partner's parents and gave them both a hug. Christine got a peck on the cheek as well. \"Good night!\" On their way up they heard Sean's mom. \"Eric! Building project? You wanna 'clean up' our old shed. That's not a project. Holden is a highly renowned architect! He won't waste his time with your little idea of a guest house.\" His dad was protesting. \"How can you know, Christine. I just wanna show him… wanna hear his opinion!\" Sean smiled and shook his head while guiding Holden into his old room. \"This photo of you… I want a copy of it for my office. You know, the one with you as a 6 year old in your first football gear! It's so cute!\" Holden grinned at Sean while brushing his teeth. Sean had just rinsed his mouth and looked into the mirror. What he saw, was just adorable, Holden sitting on the edge of the bath tub with stretched out legs, just wearing pajama pants. He wasn't fond of the idea that all of Holden's staff would see the picture, but hey, it could have been worse. There were far more embarrassing shots of him, he could live with it. \"Sure. It's mom's favorite pic too. I'm sure she'll be happy to make you a copy.\" Holden was still working on his teeth, but miraculously Sean understood every word he was saying. \"Yeah, she told me she loves it. Tomorrow she wants to show me some videos too.\" \"Oh nooo…\" Sean mentally flipped through the video footage of him as a child and teenager his parents had shot over the years. \"Your dad said, they have put the stuff on DVD now, to save the quality.\" \"Yeah great! This will be so embarrassing.\" Holden grinned even more. \"Can't wait!\" Finally lying in his old queen-size bed Sean wanted to tell Holden about his father's project. But his partner obviously wasn't in a chatty mood anymore. \"I love you so so much!\" He flooded Sean's neck and face with sappy kisses until he finally found his mouth. Sean loved it when Holden was that passionate and welcomed his lover's demanding tongue with his own. Without ceasing the invasion into his mouth Holden now crawled onto him. Sean automatically put his arms around his body to hold him close. Meanwhile Holden framed Sean's head with his arms and stroked his hair. They enjoyed the mutual caressing for a while. When Holden shifted a bit for a more comfortable position, Sean felt his lover's growing erection brushing his thigh and he moaned into the kiss. Holden smiled against his lips, slowly parted Sean's legs and started massaging his crotch with his own thigh. Sean almost saw stars and the decision to stop Holden in this moment wasn't easy, but somehow his brain subdued his want. \"Holden, we're at my parents' house!\" \"They won't hear us. We'll be quiet.\" Holden breathed into his ear. \"You've never been quiet!\" \"Just because I didn't have to.\" He now rested on his elbows and winked at Sean. \"I can do this!\" His partner shook his head with a grin. \"Bear, you're soooo not used to alcohol. I think we should sleep now.\" Holden snorted \"This isn't the scotch. It's already gone. I know what I'm doing. And right now I wanna looooove you!\" He started chuckling. His sparkling light blue eyes focused on Sean's lips before he bent down and crashed their mouths together again. Holden knew exactly which buttons to push and Sean had a hard time to withstand him and his own recurring, well never really gone lust. But mentally picturing his parents, lying in their bed in the next room hearing them having sex, finally cleared up his mind. \"Holden no! I can't do this.\" Holden returned into his 'half on his elbows, half on Sean' position and looked at him with sad puppy dog eyes. \"Don't look at me like that. I love you, you know that. You're beautiful. God, you're hauntingly beautiful. But, I just can't get romantic with you… with my parents in the same house!\" Holden took a deep breath as if he was considering this argument. He smiled at the man beneath him and slightly nodded before rolling off and getting comfortable at Sean's side. With that none of them said a word for a while and Sean already damned himself for making his partner mad at him. Then Holden finally looked at him with a grin. \"Hauntingly beautiful? What kind of cheesy cheap novels are you secretly reading, honey?\" Sean sighed in relief that he had obviously misinterpreted the silence. He tugged Holden closer to his own body and fondled his hipbone through the fabric of the pants. \"It's not cheesy when it's the truth!\" \"Aww! That's so cute… Sean, I love you so much for being like that!\" Holden reached up and stroked his cheek and jawline. He then snuggled up to Sean and when they had found the perfect position they fell asleep within a few minutes. \"Eric… this is a pretty cool idea! I like the concept!\" Sean's dad looked at his wife and son with a self-satisfied smile. \"See, I told ya!\" Both sighed and rolled their eyes. Holden didn't notice it, he concentrated on the construction plan Eric had made. \"May I suggest something?\" The older man forgot his family in an instant and got all excited now. He grabbed a chair and sat down. \"Sure!\" \"I don't know if you like that kind of room concept… but you could put an open gallery in there. I think it would look fantastic. All wooden materials, very natural …\" All of them could literally see Eric's brain work. \"Ohhh. Ehm… you… you think we could have a look at it?\" Holden looked into the man's sparkling eyes and had to grin, \"Sure! Let's go.\" Sean helped his mother preparing breakfast when the two men were heading to the old shed in the backyard. He could see them through the kitchen window. By the time he started slicing the tomatoes they had arrived at the – in Sean's view – ramshackle hut. They stopped in front of it and his dad was wildly gesturing, obviously describing every detail of his dream to Holden. Sean started to feel sorry for him, but to his surprise his partner chimed in with what looked like own thoughts and suggestions. The footballer smiled widely and concentrated on the tomatoes again. His mom stepped beside him and glanced out of the window. \"You think, dad is bothering Holden with this thing?\" \"No mom, look at him – he loves it!\" \"But I don't want him to feel forced into helping your father with this. He should relax and feel at home here and not… work.\" \"Ma, relax. He feels at home, believe me. And he finally has someone to chat about houses and architecture stuff. Just look at them – they're like kids in the candy store.\" Sean looked at his mom when she responded with a short \"ya\". \"What is it, mom?\" \"Nothing dear.. I just hope they won't spend the whole weekend out there. I want to get to know Holden better too. Ehm… never mind. let's set the table.\" Sean's eyes followed her as she rushed out of the kitchen. 'Could it be that my mom is jealous of my dad for spending time with Holden? Unbelievable.' He chuckled and followed her with more dishes. Holden and Sean already sat at the breakfast table and waited for Sean's parents to join them. After a short glance into the corridor Holden leaned over to his partner. \"Is it ok to tell you that I really like your dad?\" Sean snorted and stared at him. \"Of course! I'm so happy that you get along!\" \"You know, he is sooo interested in architecture. You never told me! Did you know that he has a like new issue of 'The life-work of Frank Lloyd Wright' by H. Th. Wijeveld from 1925? You know… the architect who designed the Guggenheim museum in NYC… the guy I wrote my thesis about… It's so cool!\" Sean rummaged in his memories, but before he could respond to that his parents came in with the coffee and a pan with still sizzling scrambled eggs. Eric smiled at his son's partner. \"Holden, I can't wait to see your plan for the gallery. But as I said, take your time. Your work of course takes priority.\" \"Eric, would you stop it and let the boys eat?\" He looked at his wife. \"You're just jealous that we have the same interest, you only tell him how gorgeous he is.\" \"He is gorgeous! And just for your information, we have common interests too!\" The older man snorted, but Sean's mom continued. \"He doesn't love you more than me… not even now that he knows about your filthy old book of this Wright guy.\" The two men at the table first followed the argument like a tennis match – left, right, left, right – but with the last comment they couldn't hold back the laughter any more. Interrupting his parents' little argument Sean put an arm around Holden's shoulder. \"First of all: From the three of us Holden loves me the most! And second: Give us some eggs already, we're starving!\" Holden still giggled but looked at the couple opposite the table. Though the whole situation was almost comedic, he was really touched. \"You know… Sean is right!\" The urge to laugh welled up again, but he fought it down. \"No seriously. I really love both of you so much. You can't imagine what it means to me to have you in my life now. And I'm thankful that Sean is willing to share his parents with me.\" He now looked at his partner who just smiled at him and replied with a slight nod. Holden leaned over and put a light kiss on Sean's lips. His mom sighed with pleasure and threw her hands on her heart. She looked at her husband, \"look at them!\". He put an arm around her waist and tugged her closer to his side. \"Yep, that's all we could wish for. Our son has found someone he's really happy with.\" \"Yeah, they're such a gorgeous couple!\" Holden blushed. He looked at Sean and was astonished to see that his partner's face had changed colors too. \"Can we stop talking about that and have breakfast already?\" They all knew Sean and smiled about his acted grumpiness. He was romantic, but he obviously wasn't comfortable with his parents analyzing his partnership. \"Yeah, let's eat before the eggs get cold.\" Christine agreed. \"And let's not forget, we have a lot to chat about today and even more videos of sweet little Sean to watch. Of course just if you want, Holden.\" Holden couldn't answer, because right in that second he had shoved a great amount of eggs into his mouth. But he eagerly nodded with sparkling eyes. Christine grinned at him. Sean looked at his parents, then at Holden and finally on his plate. \"Oh my God.\" The weekend was over in a heartbeat. It was Sunday afternoon and they were on the flight home again. \"I just love your parents and I sooo can't wait for them visiting us. Is it ok that I invited them? I mean, I have to catch up on 'having parents', but I don't want you being annoyed or something.\" Sean kissed Holden on the cheek. \"How could I? Mom had tears in her eyes when she had to let you go. And dad wants to see your office and your plan for this gallery thing. Just let me warn you, you can't escape from them anymore.\" Holden grinned at him now. \"I don't want to escape. I love it!\" He felt so happy right now like he could embrace the world. And he already created a plan for Eric's guest house in his mind. He hadn't designed anything for a while now and looked forward to this welcome change from just selling property. Working on this project with Eric would be great. 'He'll be surprised what a treasure has been sleeping in his backyard over years.' Ok, Holden had to admit, he was a bit selfish too. When the guest house would be ready, he and Sean would sleep there during their visits… and… well… Sean probably could relax better when his parents weren't in the adjoining room anymore. 'God, I feel like a teenager planning the first sex experience and trying to hide it from the parents.' He chuckled and looked at the other man. When Sean became aware of it, Holden batted his long lashes for a heartbeat longer than necessary. The footballer seemed to read his mind in a split second and grinned mischievously. He bent over and whispered into Holden's ear. \"Can't wait 'til we're home. I'll make it up to you… for the last two nights.\" Holden tilted his head… almost unnoticeable, but Sean took the offer and kissed his neck. \"God Holden, this will be the longest hour of my life.\" Sean growled into the soft curls behind his ear. \"Don't forget the one hour taxi drive from LAX to our house.\" \"Dammit, that's too long. Wait, we could take a room near the airport. Just for…\" \"Eww, Sean! I won't check in at a 'God-knows-who's-been-lying-here-before' hot-sheet hotel!\" People's heads flew around and many eyes stared at him, too many. 'Oh, that was probably a bit too loud.' While his face turned crimson he glared at Sean. It was his fault after all. But the stifled grin on his partner's face made him chuckle too. \"I'm sorry folks, didn't mean to be rude.\" He slouched down in his seat and dragged Sean closer by gripping his shirt. When his ear – this delicious and lickable ear… uh oh, focus Holden! – when his ear was close enough, he whispered \"What I wanted to say before I made half the plane look at me with disgust – I won't have sex with you in a place like that. Even if the drive will take four hours, we will go home !\" He tilted his head to see the reaction on Sean's face. \"Will you stop grinning please?\" He half-heartedly pushed the other man back into his own seat and tried to stay out of focus for the rest of the flight. \"Sean, I'm home! Sorry for being late!\" Holden put his briefcase on the sideboard. While crossing the living area he loosened his tie, put off his suit jacket and dropped it on a chair. It was a hot day for April and he felt like dying of thirst. Opening the fridge he moaned because of the wonderful cold breeze greeting him. He took out a water. While greedily gulping down the cool liquid he had a look around to see any sign of Sean being at home. But then he heard him coming down the stairs. He had someone on the phone. \"Oh, he's at home now… ehm… do you wanna talk to him?\" Holden was curious now. \"Who is it, love?\" Sean looked at him. \"It's your… mom.\" Holden grinned at him, anxious to talk to the woman he was expecting to be on the other end. He kissed Sean and yanked the phone out of his hand. He frowned for a second at Sean's uneasy look, but then started chattering into the unit. „Hey Christine. Your son is teasing me. Said, it was my mom. I mean, I know you told me again to call you mom and we had a great weekend with you, but… ah you know what, to hell with it…\" He giggled. \"Hello son.\" It took him a second to realize that it wasn't Christine. The smile fell out of his face. His body froze and he had a hard time to continue breathing. \"Holden?\" He grit his teeth, couldn't say a thing. He hadn't heard this voice for over two decades. \"Holden? You're there?\" Again the memories rushed into his brain, unbidden. \"Is he there?\" asked a male voice in the background. Holden started shaking. He got chills all over his body. Tears welled up in his eyes. He didn't even have to look at Sean, his partner summed up the situation by himself. He took the phone from Holden and just ended the call. \"I wanted to explain, but you were too quick. You just… Holden?\" \"I'm having a shower.\" And he was gone. Holden sat on the sofa with his legs drawn up. He pretended reading, but Sean noticed very well that he hadn't flipped the pages for about an hour now and just stared at some undefined spot on the actual page. \"Holden, we must talk about this.\" He went over and sat down opposite the other man. \"Your mom told me that they wanna see you.\" Holden looked up. \"Good for her. How did they find me anyway? I mean…\" \"Baby, everyone in this country with the slightest bit of interest in football knows about us. And putting two and two together they will assume that you live with me. And you told me that your dad is a football fan, so…\" \"Right. But Sean, I don't think that I want that.\" Holden looked at him with pleading eyes. Sean sighed and crawled over. He put his hand on his partner's thigh and fondly squeezed it. \"It's your decision. Yours only. But maybe they're really sorry. You should give them a chance. And even if it's just for closing this case forever. Nothing happens without a reason. And you never know, maybe they surprise you.\" He could see Holden's skeptical look. \"You know that he beat the hell out of me when I was 16. They banned me. I can't forget that just because they call twenty years later and say 'Hey, we think we wanna visit you!'\" \"I know! Believe me, I do. But as I said, everyone deserves a second chance. You gave me a second chance two months ago, when I came out. After the way I treated you the years before, I wasn't sure you'd come back to me.\" \"Oh Sean, please. That is something completely different! I knew that you loved me!\" \"What tells you that your parents don't regret everything? What tells you that they haven't been thinking about the fact that you are their only son and that they love you?\" \"You can't be serious, Sean.\" \"But are you sure that they don't regret?\" Holden stared at him. He had no exact answer to that. He wasn't sure. \"I would see it in their eyes I guess.\" \"Ok. Does that mean you wanna see them?\" Holden looked surprised, either by this question or his own subconscious decision to meet his parents. \"Yeah, I guess.\" \"Ok.\" Sean got up to prepare the dinner. \"Oh, what I wanted to tell you. Those calls over the last few days, you know?\" Holden nodded. \"It was your mom. She told me. She didn't know how to start…\" Holden nodded again. \"You'll be here, right?\" Sean turned around and smiled at him. \"Of course!\" \"Good.\" It wasn't easy for Holden to fight his inner demons and see his parents, but maybe Sean was right. He wanted to hear what they had to say about their behavior towards their only child. And if they hadn't an explanation – which was the more likely option – maybe he could finally put it behind after that. He didn't know how he would endure this evening, but he knew that Sean would stand behind him. He took a deep breath. He hadn't slept the whole night and now couldn't stop fumbling with the edge of his shirt. Initially he wanted to wear a suit but then decided against it. Who was he trying to impress. And well, they wouldn't be impressed anyway. He was an office sitter, not a doer! He wasn't… God, why did the self-doubts crawl back into his head right now? The doorbell rang and his heart leapt into his throat. Sean opened the door, welcomed them and asked them in. When his mother saw him she smiled and headed up to him. She wore simple jeans and a washed out red blouse. Her ashy hair was tied up in a ponytail. Holden didn't move. 'The time hasn't done her good. She looks worn out and tired.' The stubborn child in him didn't want to feel for her but she really didn't look well. When she reached Holden, she hesitantly hugged him. He didn't hug back, just put a hand on her shoulder for a second and then stepped back from her. This felt as awkward as he had imagined it. \"Holden, you've become such a handsome young man.\" The only reaction he had for her was a forced smile. Then he looked at his father who was right behind her and he automatically gritted his teeth. \"Son.\" When the older man reached out his hand and Holden raised his own to join the handshake he had to suppress the shivering. His mind made him feel like the 16 year old boy again. It was awful. Sean obviously sensed that the atmosphere had absolutely plummeted. He made them have a seat at the dining table and started a small talk. It was tough and tedious in the beginning, but then Holden's mother started to tell how they learned where Holden lives now and that he is together with Sean. After a few minutes she came to an end. \"As I said, we saw the press conference and then the pictures of you two. We couldn't believe it. Our son and Sean Jackson. You really have a good taste Holden.\" His father had been very quiet so far but now chimed in. \"Yeah, he's one of the best quarterbacks at the moment. Sean, do you remember that game in Houston last year? You really saved it man. I didn't believe you could do it, but you did ! A real football star! The others are football players, you're a star ! I always knew that you have the potential. When you were playing in Boston in your early years, I swear I saw it back then!\" Sean uneasily shifted around on his chair. He glanced at Holden who seemed to take deeper and deeper breaths with every of his father's words. The footballer stood up, a bit too quick maybe. \"Anyone want a coffee?\" Without waiting for an answer he headed to the coffee machine. Maybe he was hoping the talk about him would stop. But Holden's father didn't seem to care that Sean had left the table. He wallowed in his memories of the great games Sean had during his time as a pro so far. Holden had listened patiently and now waited for their apology to him, it had to come. His parents didn't come here for that , right? When he raised his voice he couldn't be friendly, he didn't even try it. \"So, you're here for small talk? For worshipping Sean and football? You could have written a letter. Or just have met him at a game or when I would have been at work. Don't you think you have something to tell me ?\" He put as much disappointment as possible into his voice for the last question, which wasn't difficult because he was disappointed. His mom looked down at the table and kept quiet. His father looked at him with reproach, probably because he had interrupted his praising. Then the older man unwillingly started with what sounded like an apology. That he didn't mean it. That it had been the shock making him do what he did. That it was a different time then and gays – that was a hard word for him, everyone could see it – gays weren't as accepted as today. \"I'm sorry.\" Two other words that obviously didn't pass his lips easily. There was a certain glance in his eyes, but Holden couldn't hold the eye contact long enough to interpret it. He still was intimidated. A feeling started growing in him. Was it hope? Hope for being acknowledged? Or even loved? He swallowed. If Sean was the key to his own parents, to his father, why wouldn't he take this opportunity? Sooner or later they would see what their son had blossomed into. They would see what they've missed. He inhaled deeply. He just had remembered the last time he had seen his father before he was taken to the hospital, seen his face in the dim light on the porch, his disgust, his hate and his desperation because Holden wasn't the son he had wished for. His mother hadn't even left the house. No! They couldn't get away with a 'We're sorry, those were different times.' Not after what they did to him. Not after the twenty years of nothing. Holden mentally pushed the hope away and tried not to listen to it. Something was wrong. His dad had apologized, yes. But only because he literally had forced him to do it. And this annoyed look before. Nothing had changed. He raised his eyes. 'Mom really looks bad.' He looked back on his hands. No! No hope and no sympathy. Not even pity! He couldn't forgive them, because they didn't want to be forgiven. It became more and more obvious with every word out of his father's mouth. Was he really talking about one of the then neighbors' boys who he still had contact with? Oh right, he played basketball. That's a pretty good reason to love him. Holden swallowed again. The air was so stifling. Sweat started to shine on his forehead. He wanted to get out of here. Run, just run. It would be easy. He could stand up, go on the terrace, open the door and would be free. Free to run. Or to swim. Yes, swimming was even better. He would see nothing but the horizon. He wouldn't look back, just swim out. Would hear nothing but the water around him and some seagulls. Seagulls, that didn't lie to him about how sorry they are and justify their actions with 'different times'. Or tell him what a handsome young man he had become. Tell him that now all of a sudden he was a good boy because of the partner he had chosen. Tell him that… He breathed deeply. No, he couldn't get out of here. He was trapped in his own house. With the man he loved more than anything in this world, but also with the two people he hated the most. But didn't he want just love from them at the same time? He felt the first signals of a headache coming up. But he had to be strong. The 'talk' would return to Sean and his great accomplishments and he would just have to sit and wait. Wait for them to leave. So he could let in some fresh air. Salty air from the ocean. He wanted to be in the ocean so bad. No, we already had that, no swimming for Holden today. Not now. Be strong. He looked out of the window and saw a seagull flying past the house. And smiled. \"Holden?\" The familiar voice woke him from his daydream. He looked around. All eyes were on him now. \"What?\" Sean gently smiled at him. \"Your mom brought some photos of you as a child. You don't wanna look at them? You were such a cute boy!\" Holden stared at the pictures in front of him. A little blond boy with huge blue eyes smiled at him. But something wasn't right. And by looking at every single one he remembered. None of those were taken by his parents. All of them showed him at a friend's birthday party or in the summer camp. That's why the cute little boy was smiling. Was happy. And with showing those photos around, they could pretend having been good parents? Were they really convinced that they had done a great job at raising him? He had to get out, to hell with being strong. He got up. Didn't choose the way to his beloved ocean though, because Sean would probably follow him. He needed an option with a door. A door that he could lock behind him. Without saying another word he went upstairs. When he had passed half the way he heard a chair moving and he knew that it was Sean's. \"Don't!\" was the only thing he could bring out. And his partner stayed. After closing and locking the bedroom door, Holden instantly felt sorry for leaving Sean alone with them. But he had never been selfish, always had put everybody's needs above his own. This time it was his turn. He needed to be alone, away from them . And he was now. He got naked and stepped into the shower. It wasn't the ocean, but it was water. At least something. Holden was in the shower for over twenty minutes by now. Sitting on the bed with his back against the bedhead, waiting for him, Sean recalled the day. When he had opened the door and looked into the eyes of Holden's dad, he knew where his partner had those amazing blue eyes from. But they weren't quite the same. The thing that always struck Sean most with Holden's eyes beside their color and those irresistible sparkles in them was their warmth . No matter how mad or angry he had ever been, one look into those eyes calmed him down and made him melt. Sean knew what was missing in the older man's look – this warmth. It made the light blue glance very cold. And though the man was obviously admiring him, Sean felt kind of uncomfortable around him. Holden's mom was quite shy and unremarkable. But from what Holden had told him she was not the woman having an own opinion. Yeah, that's exactly what she looked like. Everything about this 'family reunion' had been pretty awkward. Yep, that's the perfect word to describe the evening – awkward. Poor Holden. When even Sean felt like that, what the hell must go on in his mind. Thank God they had left immediately after Holden had disappeared. Empty phrases like 'It's late anyway.' and 'We still have some miles to drive.' were shared and they were gone. Ah, the water finally had stopped. A moment later his partner came out of the bathroom just with a towel around his waist. He looked so miserable and lost. Sean reached out his hand. \"Come here.\" While making his way to him, Holden started apologizing. \"I'm so sorry for leaving you alone. But… I couldn't stay in there any longer. I just couldn't. The indifference in his voice, as if nothing had ever happened… Those photos…\" He reached Sean and crawled into his arms, embracing him as tightly as possible. \"I couldn't be strong.\" \"Holden! Don't tell me you weren't strong! You haven't seen them like forever and now you sat there face to face. That can be overwhelming. You made a big step towards them. But you're right, it was a bit too much talk about… too much…\" \"Too much talking about you? Yes. I think I have to accept the fact that you're the real reason why they wanted to meet, Sean. It's not me. Not their son. It's the football star I live with.\" Sean sighed. \"Hey. Don't say that, love. They tried, they really did. They want you to have the photos, they're in the living room. That's a gesture, right? I'd say they are really sorry and wanna make up for it.\" Sean didn't feel confident in what he was saying there. But if he'd show the slightest hint of a doubt, Holden would never agree to another meeting with them. And that would be so wrong. Sean still couldn't understand what Holden's father had done to his son, and never would. But they were his parents, for God's sake. His mom gave birth to him, they raised him. It was just impossible that there wasn't any love left. This first get-together was a flop, yes. But he wanted Holden to be happy – and this has been everything but that. They needed to give it another try. He looked down on Holden who had already fallen asleep. Sean carefully removed the half-wet towel from him and covered his naked body with the light sheets. Then he tiptoed into the bathroom and returned after a quick wash. He didn't want Holden to be alone now. Slipping under the sheets he took his partner in his arms. \"You're safe baby, safe. No matter what.\" Holden didn't wake up, but snuggled up to Sean in a natural movement. Sean ran his fingertips over his forearm, enjoying the slight tingling of the hair on it. But with the feeling of his lover's even breath against his neck he finally dozed off too. Holden had no idea why he was here. The first meeting, or better the fiasco with his parents was just a week ago. And now he was sitting here with Sean next to him in a quiet little restaurant, waiting for them. He didn't even know how Sean had managed to persuade him to do this. Well ok, he knew it. His partner was great in talking him into things. But he also got the goddess of persuasion on board, Kathy. His secretary had been after him the whole week. Yesterday she told him how important it was to get back in the saddle again and try it just once more. In the saddle? Really? He laughed about it, but she grabbed his arm and made him sit down on the sofa in his office. When he saw her dead serious eyes he knew he had to listen to her. \"Mr. Wilson. Pease give it a try. They are your parents, the only parents you have.\" Holden wanted to bring up Sean's mom and dad, but kept silent. He knew what she was trying to say. She continued. \"You know that I love working for you. And not only because you're a great boss.\" Holden smiled at her. \"But because you are a great person. You deserve having parents that love you. And maybe they do and just couldn't show it that day. I'm sure it was strange for them too… meeting you after all those years.\" He looked into her eyes for a while and for a few seconds he tried to believe her. He couldn't however, he knew his parents better. But he was touched that she cared for him. Her care and Sean's countless attempts at persuasion resulted in him sitting here. He sighed. His left leg nervously bobbed up and down until Sean placed his hand on it and gently stroked it. Holden smiled at him and leaned against his shoulder. He closed his eyes and for a moment he wished that they wouldn't come, that it would just be Sean and him for dinner. Someone markedly cleared his throat. Opening his eyes Holden recognized his dad who now tried to look in any direction but theirs. He obviously had a hard time handling the innocent moment of affection between them. Holden shook his head. 'Yeah dad, you're right. I lean against his shoulder. Wow. I could just as well hump him on the table! Would be the same for you, wouldn't it?' Nevertheless he parted from Sean and sat straight. His parents sat down and Holden tried to fight his slightly confrontational mood down. No, he didn't feel weak today… which was good. Maybe it was due to the fresh air, they had been placed outside. Seeing his dad exclusively talking to Sean and completely ignoring him – like he used to do as long as Holden could think – and his mother hanging on his every word, made it clear. They would never be his parents, not the parents he had wished for. Being honest he already knew it since their first meeting. But that evening had completely overstrained him, because at that time his little old friend 'hope' was still living in his mind. It had made him weak. But he was sick of being weak. Somewhere along the line between then and today, sweet little 'hope' had been kicked out by his new friends, 'sense of reality' and 'fuck you'. As expected the talk was mostly about football again, but this time Holden was prepared for it. He and his new friends saw it with gallows humor. At least he had something to eat. They wanted something. Not from him, that was obvious. So the only one remaining was Sean. Holden was almost excited when his dad would come up with it. 'What is it dad? What do you want?' When his father got up and went to the restroom, his mom, who sat opposite him and again hadn't contributed much to the conversation so far, leaned over the table. \"How is your work doing, Holden?\" Holden stared at her with disbelief. \"Are you kidding me, mom? For over an hour you don't talk to me and now that he's away you come up with that?\" \"You know your dad, Holden. All he wants to talk is sport. So I just thought…\" \"Oh stop it.\" With that an awkward silence came up and remained until his dad came back. He spread an atmosphere of departure though. \"It has become late. But, Sean… I just wanted to ask you a favor.\" He nestled at the bag he had placed behind him. Holden almost felt relieved, he was right. Sean looked at him. The surprise in his eyes couldn't be overseen. \"Sure.\" Holden squinted his eyes when his dad pulled out plenty of glossy prints with Sean in his gear on them. They were followed by ten of his team's caps. \"Would you mind to sign these few things?\" Sean was apparently confused, but stayed astonishingly calm. \"Ehm, okayyy… any name on it?\" \"No it's ok, just sign it…\" The older man prepared the pen for him. Holden stared at Sean who started scribbling his name on the prints. \"What the fuck? I can't believe it.\" His partner looked somewhat helpless but Holden just shook his head. \"I'm waiting in the car.\" He glowered at his dad, took the keys out of Sean's pants pocket and left. They hadn't talked at all on the way home. When they finally arrived, Holden went straight up into the bedroom and prepared for going to sleep. Sean followed him and did the same. Pulling off his clothes he looked at his partner. \"Holden, could we please talk? What is it?\" Holden snorted. \"Come on Sean. Do me a favor and try to think with me. The stuff you signed today, what do you think, is he doing with it? Hm? Exactly! He will sell it! To the highest bidder.\" Sean looked honestly off-guard. \"No, I don't believe that.\" \"Sean. You don't know my dad. I do !\" All of a sudden his anger directed against his partner and he couldn't do anything against it. \"Anyway… where is your rage from three years ago when you first heard the story of my fucked up youth? If he had been there back then, you would have done 'God-knows-what' to him. You would have stood by my side. But today… you developed into his merchandize-signing cash cow!\" \"Holden! What…\" \"No, you know I'm right!\" Holden flopped onto his side of the bed. Sean lay down and closed the distance between them. \"I just tried to be friendly. I'm sorry if I hurt you with that. Come on love... please.\" Holden sighed and Sean continued. \"And according to the things… We both know he is a fan. Maybe the stuff is for his friends.\" Holden snorted and turned his back to him, hectically sorting his blanket. \"Friends. Yeah right. 40 close friends who all want your signed photo. And since my dad knows you, they surely don't want their name on it. You're so naïve.\" With that the conversation was over. Sean returned to his side of the bed and stared out of the window. After a while Holden thought about talking about this argument but dropped it. He was right. When Holden arrived at the office the next morning, after a night with no sleep at all, he was happy that Kathy wasn't at her desk. She would have asked about how the second meeting had been and that was the last thing he wanted to talk about right now. He had something else in his mind. He started the computer and waited for the internet connection to build up. \"Sean is too good for this world, and definitely too good for my parents!\" After flipping through some online portals and stores he found what he was looking for. The ink on the photos wasn't dry yet and his dad offered them for sale, way overpriced. \"So they're making good money. I knew it.\" They didn't want to make up for his childhood and for the way they had treated him when he came out to them. They just abused him as go-between to Sean, the great football star. Well, he wasn't even a go-between, they barely talked to him anyway. They just wanted to reap profit out of Sean. He felt tears running down his cheeks. 'Wait, what is that now? I thought, we had left that behind?' Dammit. Why could everybody he knew love him except his own parents? He buried his face in his hands and stayed like that for a while. When he looked back up the tears had dried already. That was it. They had overstepped the mark. \"You try to treat me like I don't exist and abuse Sean as source of income? No dad, not anymore.\" \"Why are we meeting your parents again? I didn't think that you would want that after last time.\" Sean looked confused and suspicious. Holden hadn't told him about what he had found out. He wanted to confront his parents with it right in front of him. \"I just wanna clarify some things. You'll see.\" The doorbell rang and Holden went to let his parents in. They took a seat on the sofa and Holden started right away. \"Dad, what were the prints and caps for the other day?\" His father seemed surprised by the direct question and started stuttering while searching for an answer. \"You sell the stuff, right?\" Holden continued shooting. Sean looked at him and then at his dad. The older man sat straight and looked at Holden with this cold gaze he knew so well. \"Yeah. Why not? He's a football star, why not make a bit money with it? What do you care?\" Holden snorted and looked at Sean, who shook his head. \"What do I care? You are so unbelievable. But you won't do that. You don't come here with your fake apology and reap profit out of us!\" Holden got up and started talking himself into a rage. \"I knew it! I so knew it when you stepped through that door for the first time! Twenty years… shit! And now that you know I'm together with a football star, you remember having a son? After fucking twenty years of nothing? You call yourself a father? Or a mother?\" His mom started crying but his father got upset, exactly the reactions he had imagined. \"Holden, watch your words. We raised you.\" \"So you're telling me I owe you something?\" The young man panted. \" Fuck you man! You didn't even talk to me when I proved to be the son with no interest in sports and all this 'man stuff'. It was like I didn't exist from the age of 5. You and her-\", he pointed at his mother, \"you gave me food and clothes. But that is not raising a child! You know what? I know Sean's parents for a month now… and they've given me more love and support than you did in those damn sixteen years I've lived with you! You gave me nothing but the feeling of being useless scum not worth the effort. Fuck!\" Tears flooded his eyes, but he had to get it out now. \"So I should honor you as parents? You remember what happened at the end of your oh so great raising, don't you? You beat the crap out of me and threw me out on the street like a rotten piece of shit. Thank you dad , thanks for that! And mom, thank you too. For doing nothing when he beat me down and broke my ribs and nose with his boots to kick the 'gay' out of me. For looking right into my eyes when he lashed me with his belt and finally knocked me out! You didn't do anything to stop him. You truly love me, I'm sure. So what do I owe you? Nothing !\" Holden finally wiped off the tears that were pouring down his face. He barely could see the two people in front of him. Expressing the rediscovered hate for them was relieving, but it also had taken all his energy. He had to leave the room, breathing the same air as them made him feel sick. He also didn't want to hear any answer – it would be a lie or bad excuse anyway. When he had passed the sofa his dad got up. \"So, what do we see here? A grown up man crying and fleeing from confrontations again. You've been weak all your life. You were as a kid and you are now. And blaming it all on us is so easy, isn't it? But it's your fault, you decided to be a disgrace for us. And now you even dragged Sean Jackson into this environment .\" Holden slowly turned around. His blue eyes were as cold as ice as he stared at his dad. He started shaking. After two more deep breaths he jumped at his father and pushed him to the ground. The pure rage made him hit the older man. Again and again. Didn't listen to his mother screaming. Didn't really notice Sean trying to get him off his father. He just couldn't stop. Soon blood started to splatter all over them and the floor. He didn't know whether it was from his father's bruised face or his own grazed knuckles. And he didn't care. This felt so good… no, it was unbelievably fucking fantastic. He heard himself laughing while his tears dropped on his dad's bloody shirt. 'Is this the feeling of going mental?' His hard punches were still not missing their target when he felt his partner's strong arms trying to interfere again. Sean tried to draw his partner off the other man as soon as he woke up from the shock. But he had underestimated Holden's strength which of course was multiplied by the hate for his father. He was like a predator not willing to let go of its prey. Sean knew he would beat his father up until he didn't move anymore. He wasn't sure that Holden would stop even then! That thought gave him chills and he once more collected all his strength. Finally he could yank his partner to the side. Once he had him he put him into a firm grip and forced him to the ground with his own weight. \" Holden calm down! He's not worth it! \" The man underneath him kicked with his feet and bucked against him to get free again. Sean had never seen Holden like that before. He felt every muscle in his partner's body tensed and ready to attack his father again. All this aggression. But he gave Holden no other choice. After a few more seconds he finally capitulated and stopped fighting against Sean, panting for air, eyes closed now. The footballer, still sitting on Holden and fixing his arms just in case, turned to see how the older man was doing. His wife now knelt by his side trying to clean his face with a tissue, but he pushed her away. He sat up, wiped the blood off his eyes with his sleeve and stared at Holden with the one eye he still could open. His face was a total mess. But he was conscious. Sean focused on Holden again. \"Can I let you out of this? You won't attack him once more, right? The old man's had enough.\" Holden seemed thinking about it. Sean could see his inner fight. But then his breath slowed down to a normal degree. \"Ok.\" Sean lifted himself up and helped Holden on his feet. He looked worn out as hell and his bloody hand was shaking. The footballer noticed that it started swelling. Some bones in it were probably broken by the sheer force of his punches. \"Still call me weak, dad?\" Holden's voice was calm, but the hate in his eyes was still there. \"Look in the mirror and tell me again that I'm weak. This seems to be the only 'language' you understand.\" His father wanted to say something, but Holden cut him off. \"Shut up! Don't say a fucking word! I have achieved so much in my life. I have a great job and an even greater man by my side. I finally know what it means to have a home and a family. And having parents that love me. I don't need you. We don't need you.\" He breathed deeply. \"And now get the fuck out of our house!\" He passed his parents without looking at them and disappeared upstairs. After Holden's speech and the fight afterwards the house now was frighteningly quiet. Sean stayed silent when Holden's parents collected themselves and where about to leave. When they were in the hallway he overheard something the man mumbled. \"He's strong… but he has no respect.\" Sean grabbed him by the shoulder and turned him around \"Wait what? What did you just say?\" He stared at the old man. \"You're talking about respect? Your teenage boy came to you and told you he is gay, because he trusted you and you beat him up and tell me something about respect ? You insinuate yourselves into our confidence to make fucking money out of me and tell me something about respect ? Then you insult your son in his own house and call our lifestyle 'environment'… and tell me something about respect ? Let me tell you something before you leave forever. You two don't deserve him as son. He is the most wonderful person I have ever met, all good and strong and endearing. Now that I know you, I think it's a miracle that he could grow into the man that he is. Thank God your environment couldn't poison his beautiful soul.\" He focused Holden's dad now. \"And the next time he decides to kick your ass I swear I won't stop him. And now… what were his words… get the fuck out of our house!\" The still bleeding man wanted to say something but decided against it. They left without another word. When he had closed the door behind them, Sean took a deep breath. All his thoughts revolved around Holden now, so he rushed up the stairs to see how he was doing. \"Ouch. Fuck.\" Holden's hand still hurt like a bitch, though it was almost a week ago now. The doctor in the hospital where Sean had brought him had put his hand in plaster and told him to keep it still for at least three weeks. He was handicapped anyway, since it was his right hand, so he didn't go to work. No, he enjoyed being at home and being cared for by his partner. Sean was really sweet, he complied with his every wish... though he didn't have many. He just asked for an extra kiss here and there. And he made Sean cook for him, every day. To his own surprise he didn't feel bad about what he had done to his dad. Ok, he didn't feel brilliant either. Beating someone up normally was under his niveau, but too much is too much. He was at peace now. He would never see those people again. He heard Sean coming home from running some errands. But who was he talking too? Holden was too lazy to get up from the sofa, he decided just to wait. But then he recognized the familiar voices beside Sean's. He jumped up – almost forgot not to support himself on his bad hand. He sneaked around the corner and a grin popped up on his face. \"Christine! Eric! What are you doing here? I thought you were coming next weekend.\" He rushed over and embraced both of them. Sean's mom inspected his hand as soon as she let him out of her hug. \"Sean called and told us that you need some cheering up. And… here we are.\" Eric patted his shoulder. \"So, what happened?\" Holden looked at Sean and put all the thankfulness he could into his smile. The other man nodded and brought his parents' luggage into the guestroom. Holden went into the kitchen to make some coffee, but Christine headed him off. \"Don't you dare to do anything for us, Holden Wilson. Get back on the couch and let me make the coffee. Eric!\" Her husband got the hint and guided Holden to the sofa. \"You have to rest, boy.\" When Sean joined them again and they had something to drink and Christine's wonderful brownies to eat, Holden looked at the Jackson family with a satisfied smile. When Sean returned the smile he sighed. \"Christine, you remember the last time we visited you and Sean told you I'm not used to so much mother love?\" She looked at him with curiosity. \"Yes. And your eyes told me not to ask you about it.\" She gave him a warm smile when he choked back the tears. Holden slightly nodded and put his cup on the table. Then he started telling his story. Christine and Eric got up at the same time and sat down on both of Holden's sides. He hadn't been crying while telling, he really was kind of proud of himself. And even when they both hugged him now, all he could do was smile. A hardly known feeling started spreading in him. 'This must be what it feels like… being loved by his parents.' Sean got up and tousled his hair to lighten up the emotional scenario. \"Welcome to the Jackson's. We're a clan of huggers.\" Holden chuckled. \"I see. I'd love to join.\" Sean's parents parted from him. Holden could see that Christine had to fight back the tears. She sighed deeply and took his hands into her own. \"You have a family now. And parents that love you for who you are – a wonderful man and our son's partner. We will always love you, no matter what.\" \"Thank you… mom.\" ~~FIN~~","Summary":" \"Sean come on, you want us to miss the flight?\" Sean muttered by the new interruption.

It is definitely written better than 'the protectors' and it helps explain alot of stuff that is never said along with Julien[oc] and Sharkboy's relationship. but it's also a completely different story all the same, so you don't have to read 'the protectors' to understand this. [also considering it comes before that] well hope you like it No Longer Home [Told from Julien's p.o.v] Everything was dark and the only thing I could remember was my name. I heard what sounding like roaring but not that of which you would hear from an animal. It felt like I was lying on grain but I didn't remember being in a place with food. I opened my eyes to see a black haired boy with blue eyes standing over me. He smiled and extended his hand toward me. I ignored it, I didn't know if he could be trusted. I sat up and he sat at my side. I looked out to see a body of water as far as the eye could see. It didn't seem to end! How could so much water be collected in one spot. I looked down at my hands the grain I had felt, was really sand. But how, there were no beaches that I knew of, but then again I didn't really remember anything. \"Hello!\" The boy said waving his hand in front of my face. I blinked from my daze and just stared at him. \"I'm Sharkboy, since you didn't hear me.\" He rolled his eyes and seemed to be annoyed. \"I'm, Julien\" I said kina low. \"OH, so you do speak!\" He said throwing his hands in the air. \"Anyway, where are you from; you kina just popped up?\" He seemed as confused as I was but I honestly couldn't tell him where I was from. I tried to think but only got a headache as images flashed through my head. I heard Sharkboy yell and looked up. \"What?\" I asked, and then I noticed he was just pointing at me with a shaky hand. I looked down at my hands and it seemed as though electricity was dancing around them. I looked at them confused and Sharkboy only seemed scared. \"It's not electricity\" I said a little unsure. \"Yeah, well, what if you have the power to control electricity. It wouldn't hurt you\" He was still standing about two feet away from me and looked terrified. I stood up and stepped toward him but he jumped back. I knew he wasn't gonna listen to what I was about to say so I decided to just trick him. I must have been mischief where ever I came from I thought. \"Hey what's that!?\" I pointed into the distance and he turned around. I quickly rushed towards him and placed my index and middle finger on his check. He was shocked and jump and for a second I thought I had made the wrong choice. He then just looked as if I wasn't hurting him after all and I couldn't help but smile at what I had just pulled off. \"What's so funny\" He asked taking my hand from his face. \"What? Oh, nothing.\" I shook my head slightly and looked down. \"Oh, and just so you know I knew that wasn't gonna hurt me, nothing can hurt me!\" I looked up to see him taking a hero stance. \"I'm king of the ocean!\" \"Oh, yeah nothing can hurt you but, ELECTRICITY!\" I was surprised at my sudden change in attitude it was weird. Sharkboy seemed surprised too because he had his eyebrow raised. \"Didn't see that coming!\" He said. I just looked down. \"SHARKBOY! SHARKBOY!\" I turned to see a girl in a similar outfit as Sharkboy running towards us. She reached us. \"You'll never believe what, wait who's that?\" She asked looking at me. \"OH, that's Julien; she kina just popped up here.\" Sharkboy explained \"Well, I'm Sharkgirl!\" She extended her hand and again I ignored it. She seemed a little offended, but then continued her conversation. \"ANYWAY! Lavagirl said she wants to come over in a day or two she said she's got big news!\" She just talked as if I wasn't there, not even bothering to explain who this Lavagirl is! \"She's our friend.\" I turned in surprise at what Sharkboy had just said it was as if he had read my mind! \"Can you read minds?\" I asked \"No you asked me who she was, didn't you?\" I didn't remember opening my mouth I just . . . thought it! Could I really have a super power! OH that would be so cool! I was snapped out my thoughts my Sharkgirl grabbing my arm. I jerked back and tripped, falling into Sharkboy. \"WOW!\" He said catching me. \"She was just going to show you something!\" I looked at Sharkgirl and she seemed upset. I quickly stood up straight. \"Sorry I wasn't paying attention.\" \"Obviously!\" She said rolling her eyes. She gets upset easily. \"What did you want to show me?\" She calmed down, or seemed too , before grabbing my hand and heading the way she had came. \"Where are we going?\" I asked \"Wow, you really weren't paying attention. Your staying with us, till we get some answers.\" Sharkboy said from behind me. \"Oh, ok.\" What am I saying this isn't ok! I'm not some kind of prisoner! I pushed my thoughts aside as we walked in to a cave. It was completely dark until a weird blue glow light up the area around us. \"What's that light?\" I asked. \"Your hands!\" Sharkboy said and I just knew he had rolled his eyes. Sure enough when I looked down my hands where glowing. We reached the end of the cave and there was a huge burst of sunlight. \"Are you two trying to blind me?!\" \"No.\" Sharkgirl let go of my hand and I opened my eyes to see what looked like a room only mad out of rock. \"Nice? Or what?\" Sharkboy put his hand on my shoulder and then motioned to the room. \"Um, I'll go with 'or what'.\" Sharkboy let go of my shoulder and sat down on a 'bed'. Sharkgirl reached into the water and pulled out a fish; and just stuck it in her mouth. \"EW!\" I screamed. And Sharkgirl just gave me a confused look. \"Anyway, where is the last place, besides the beach you remember being. The land of milk and cookies the dream lair, the-\" \"Land of milk and cookies!? Where in the world am I!\" I said interrupting Sharkboy. \"You're on Planet Drool, of course!\" Sharkgirl said. \"PLANET DROOL!? NO! I'm FROM EARTH! I KNOW THAT MUCH!\" I shrieked. \"But no one from earth, except Max, has been on \"Drool\" before.\" Sharkboy said shaking his head. Who in the world is Max, and what, the heck, is Planet Drool! Why am I here?! How'd I get here; and how do I get back!? My head was overwhelmed with questions. And both Sharkgirl and Sharkboy looked confused. I'M DOOMED! Just then this girl made out of lava walked in the room from the other side. \"Hey, Sharkboy.\" She said with a big grin on her face. Sharkboy looked at her then back at me. \"Who's your friend?\" she asked. \"This is Julien.\" Sharkboy responded and her smile faded. Oh she's so jealous. \"I'm not jealous!\" \"No one said you were, LG.\" Sharkboy said. \"Yeah, she did.\" She pointed at me and everyone faced me. \"I didn't say anything, I, thought it.\" I responded rather mean. \"That's what you said when I told you who Lavagirl was.\" Sharkboy looked like he was deep in thought. \"You probably have Telepathy!\" Sharkgirl interrupted. Yeah, I have telepathy, what ever that is. \"You can read minds\" Sharkgirl said again. \"I think, I do, because you just answered the question I thought up.\" I sat down on the 'bed' thinking. \"Great, so she can read our thoughts.\" Lavagirl's hair became brighter with what she said. \"I think I can only let people hear my thoughts.\" She calmed down once I said that. Good now she won't find out how much I like Sharkboy. \"I can read your mind though.\" I said raising my eyebrow at Lavagirl. Her face when pink and I knew she was embarrassed. \"Hey Sharkboy!\" I glanced over at Lavagirl to see a fire ball heading me way. I quickly raised my arms and a huge blue shield surrounded me. The fire ball hit and fell straight to the ground. \"Cool! I do have super powers!\" I said doing a twirl. \"Yeah, terrific.\" Lavagirl said with an attitude. \"Well, Lavagirl, didn't you have to tell us something.\" Sharkgirl said changing the subject. \"Um, yeah, Max is coming for a visit.\" \"You, guys don't care that I have powers!?\" I said, \"Max has made a lot of people with powers lately, they never last long.\" Lavagirl said with a smirk on her face. \"What if I'm the exception?\" \"That's what the last three said, although the last one stayed 3 days, longer then all the others.\" She said it like it was a challenge to see how long I would last and I was determined to prove her wrong. \"We'll just see how long I'll stay.\" We both narrowed our eyes until Sharkgirl broke the tension. \"Well, after a long journey I don't remember taking, I'm always hungry. So let's eat!\" I was about to mention something about her hidden comment, but then decided it was better I didn't. \"Ok, what do you guys have to eat?\" \"Sushi!\" I turned to Sharkboy as he reached into the small pond and pulled out a fish. I snared my nose at it and Sharkboy just let it go into the pond. I looked around the room for anything else, but found nothing. \"So, who's Max?\" \"Well, he's basically like our creator,\" Sharkboy explained \"If he hadn't dreamt us up we wouldn't be here.\" I nodded and he continued. \"He made planet drool, and he saved it when Mr. Electric went psycho.\" \"Who's Mr. Electric?\" \"It's kinda a very long story.\" \"Well, I don't have anything better to do.\" \"OK! If Sharkboy is gonna tell his tale I'm going out.\" Sharkgirl turned and run out through the cave we had come through. \"I have to take care of some stuff.\" Lavagirl gave me a mean glare before running out of the room, or cave . \"So you ready to hear it?\" \"Uh, I changed my mind if both Lavagirl and Sharkgirl left. It might not be worth telling.\" Sharkboy rolled his eyes, and then it got real quiet. We both just sat there. He sat on the rock bed and I sat on floor. I glanced up at him and he was just staring at me. We both quickly looked away. I could fell that my body had gotten hotter. Aw crap, I'm probably blushing like a freak. I let out a fake cough tried to break the silence and Sharkboy laughed. \"What was that?\" \"It was my attempt to break the awkwardness.\" I looked up to find Sharkboy looking at my as if I was an idiot. Oh great! Did I honestly answer a rhetorical question! He must think I'm a complete idiot! \"What, too many fish make your brain go raw?\" Clever cover. His face completely changed but it changed again so fast I couldn't tell if he was embarrassed or upset. \"Maybe you should go and find Sharkgirl.\" Oh man! He IS angry! \"Yeah, sure guess I could.\" I slowly stood up watching him to see any slight change that he might want me to stay. He stayed the same and I cautiously made my way through the cave. I got to the end and was back at the beach. I toke in a deep breath feeling the sun warm my face, the breeze rustling my hair. Something about all of it seemed so familiar. I toke in another breath before turning to the ocean. I looked down at my outfit, a white jumper with a purple long sleeve shirt and purple boots. Not the best outfit to where on the beach. I quickly shed my clothes and set them into a pile on the sand. I was now in black shorts and a black, tank top like, belly shirt. I walked over to where the tide was coming in and slowly stepped in. The water was warmer then I expected, and I stepped in further. There was a big difference in levels so I fell into the water up to my chest making my hair damp. I stepped back so that I was no longer completely submerged. Then I heard a very loud snarling noise, and my body instantly froze. I slowly turned my head to see a gigantic ugly creature just a few feet away. Of course I panic! I get out of the water as fast as I can and jet through the cave. I ran as fast as I can with the snarling closely following. As soon as I saw the light I prayed that Sharkboy hadn't left. I burst into the room to find Sharkboy still there. \"Sharkboy! Help!\" He turned around and I tripped right into his bare chest. Oh my god! HE'S SHIRTLESS! I had tripped right into him. And now we stood there completely awkward. I looked up and his eyes nearly cut through my soul, I quickly looked away. And then I remembered why I had run. Actually we had both discovered it when we heard the snarling behind us. I turned just as the thing jumped at us; I closed my eyes not wanting to see anything that was to happen. To my surprise nothing happen when I looked we where surrounded by a blue shield the same one that had protected me from Lavagirl earlier. It ran right into shield making me stumble backwards, it backed up and I thought we were in the clear before it charged and jumped on top of the shield. It scratched and snapped at the shield making it harder for me to keep it up. I fell on one knee as it persisted to attack. \"Do something!\" I yelled at Sharkboy Well what do you think? Is it good? if you like it you should really tell me cuz if not im probably going to take it off. [no pressure] thanks for reading this far anyway. ^_^ plz reveiw[Chapter 2] Here it is: Sharkboy looked around hopelessly while the monster continued to beat the crap out of my shield. What something done right, you do it yourself. I stood up and the shield instantly expanded crushing the monster against the cave wall. I fell back to the ground slightly worn out. \"Well now you have food,\" I glared at Sharkboy as he sat smiling over the creature. \"No thanks to you.\" I said Standing on my knees and pushing him into the water. I waited for him to yell at me but his head never came up. I figured he was messing with me but, a minute later he still hadn't appeared. I slowly crawled to the edge of the water peering in, \"Hey Shar-\" I was interrupted by a splash of water; I assumed it was Sharkboy but I couldn't see him and neither him I. When we finally saw each other my back was on the cave floor and Sharkboy was hovering over me. Oh my god! I wasn't even sure if I was breathing as we both just sat there motionless. \"Hey Sh- OH MY GOD! What's going on? Where are your guy's clothes!\" Snapped back into reality by Sharkgirl's screaming we both jumped away embarrassed. Before either of us had a chance to explain Sharkgirl was asking tons of questions. \"Enough!\" Sharkboy interrupted, \"We were just nearly killed, and I don't feel like being attacked by you too!\" \"Hey, I have good reason to \" attack \" you. I mean, where in the world are her clothes!\" I felt like I wanted to run and hide when I saw the look on Sharkgirl's face; I couldn't even respond to her! I looked up at Sharkboy for some kind of assistance but just he handed me a shirt. \"Why does it matter Sharkgirl? You walk around like that all the time.\" \"Yes, but I'MYOURSISTER not some girl, you just met WHOISHALFNAKEDINOUR CAVE!\" Hurtful. \"OK, that's enough!\" Sharkboy started pushing Sharkgirl out of the cave, \"You need to calm down!\" Sharkboy gave her one final push before a big rock fell in between them. \"What was that?\" \"That, Max dreamed it up for times when Sharkgirl is being annoying. It'll take her a day to get to the main entrance.\" He motioned toward the opening behind me and then sat down on the rock bed. \"You know you can put that on.\" I looked down noticing the shirt he had handed me was still in my lap; I blushed when I realized it was his before slipping it over my head. \"Do you really think she'll walk all the way around to the main entrance?\" I glanced up at Sharkboy who quickly looked away and shrugged. I stared at him for a moment and I guess he noticed because he continued to stare at the entrance until a turned my attention to my lap. \"Sooo, people just call you Sharkboy?\" \"Uh, yeah, I mean it is my name.\" \"Well ha yea, but where I come from, people have normal names; not something that qualifies as superhero name.\" Sharkboy turned to me raising his eyebrow and crossing his arms. \"You sayin` you don't like my name?\" Oh crap! I didn't mean to insult him! He's gonna hate me! \"No, no! I was just- I meant-\" I stopped my foolish rant when I heard Sharkboy laughing. I looked up and saw him doubled over laughing. \"What's so funny?\" His laughing faded out and he looked up, still a smile on his face. \"You are, I was just joking with you.\" \"Ooh,\" \"Well, what did you have in mind?\" I stood up dusting the dirt of my legs and drying my hair. \"What are you talking about?\" \"You said I needed a 'normal' name, did you have something in mind?\" \"Hrm,\" I stared at Sharkboy for a moment. \"You peg me as a Taylor.\" \"What's a Taylor?\" \"Taylor's not a thing it's a name.\" I said between laughs, \"I mean, did you grow up in a cave.\" \"Yes, I did; Taylor, huh? Sounds good to me; now I officially have a normal name.\" \"Yeaah sure; Imma go back to the beach.\" \"I'll go with you!\" Sh-Taylor said jumping up from his seat. I gave him a suspicious look and he began rubbing the back of his neck nervously. \"Y-You know, cause of what happen last time.\"I stared at him for a moment but decided it wasn't such a bad idea. Taylor and I walked a bit in silence not quite sure what to do. I stared at my feet watching as my toes dug into the sand only to have the water come and wash over them. It helped me keep my mind off Sh-Taylor, I didn't know why but I felt like butterflies were having a flight in my stomach. He was walking so close to me that his hand was brushing against mine; and I couldn't help but think about what happened in the cave. \"Let's go swimming!\" Taylor pulled my shirt off before grabbing my hand and pulling me toward the water. \"Sharkboy! Wait!\" Before I could get another word in he picked me up dragging us into the ocean and under the waves. I immediately swam to the surface only to discover that my feet no longer touched the sandy bottom. The waves toke me back under the air on the surface becoming farther from my grasp with each passing second. oy, I really am beating myself up about this chapter. It just seems to short and uninteresting. I guess a cliffhanger isn't that bad though still. I plan to make the next chapter 10 times better! *determined* anywho, R&R;[Chapter 3] Not exactly the 10 times better I hoped for but, It's here: (Sorry for the wait) I tried screaming for help but that only made things worse as more air was sucked from my lungs. I began flailing my arms and legs trying to reach the surface but it seemed as though I just kept sinking. Something grabbed my waist and a second later I was coughing up water on the beach. \"I-ar-Sorry..\" I looked up to see Taylor's staring at me his eyes full of regret. \"It's not your fault. Besides,\" I turned to him smiling, \"Water's good for you, right!\" We laughed for a second before I grabbed his hand pulling us both up. \"You're it!\" I yelled before dashing down the beach. \"Tag, Really!\" I spun around to face Taylor continuing to jog backwards. \"What, don't you wanna catch me?\" He hesitated for a second before rushing down the beach in my direction. I turned around laughing as I ran down the beach. \"You'll never catch me!\" I teased \"We'll see about that!\" I glanced back for a second then next thing I knew Taylor was on my tail and tackled me to the sand laughing. \"Ok, so maybe you're quick on your feet.\" I turned to look at him our faces only inches apart. His big blue eyes staring right at me; he leaned closer and I felt his breath on my lips, \"That's not, the only thing.\" He leaned in closing the gap, our lips pressing so softly together it sent shivers down my spine. He moved closer his lips moving over mine and my back resting on the sand, things were moving a little too fast. \"Sharkboy. Sharkboy. Stop!\" I said pushing him away from me and jumping to my feet, \"Stop...\" He stood up reaching out to try and comfort me, \"I'm sorry, I didn't mean...\" Suddenly tons of images flooded my brain overwhelming me; I tried to reach for Taylor to steady myself but ended up bringing us both to the ground instead. It wasn't just images this time either all these emotions came to me all at once, it was making my head hurt. \"Stop!\" I heard a scream and looked over to find Taylor land a few feet away; I raced over crouching beside him. \"Are you ok? I'm sorry, I didn't mean to do that I-\" \"I'm fine,\" He said slowly pushing himself up, \"You pack a pretty mean punch though.\" He was holding the back of his head and I couldn't help but feel guilty. \"I'm sorry…\" I said again. \"It's O.K,\" he said taking hold of my hand, \"King of the ocean member, nothing hurts me.\" I laughed slightly, \"Except electricity.\" \"Except that.\" He smiled pulling us both to our feet, \"Come on,\" he started walking back toward the cave. \"It'll be dark soon we should head back.\" \"Wait no,\" I said pulling him back. \"I want to see the stars.\" \"You can see them from the cave.\" \"Pleeaase Taylor.\" I said batting my eyelashes; as predicted it didn't take long for him to say yes. It didn't take long for the sun to go down and we sat there in the sand staring at the stars while the waves softly brushed up against our feet. The darker it got the more stars that came out; the sky was literally filled with them. Everywhere I looked there were more stars, \"I don't think I've ever seen so many in my life.\" I said laying down next to Taylor in the sand, \"I want to put some in a bag and take some home with me,\" I trailed off for a second averting my gaze down the beach. \"Where ever home is.\" \"We'll find out,\" Taylor said squeezing my hand. \"I promise.\" I smiled moving closer to him, shielding myself from the cool breeze that had started blowing. \"Thank you, Taylor.\" I closed my eyes slowly drifting off into sleep. My eyes fluttered open as the sun crept quickly into the sky wrapping me in its warmth. Everything looked so beautiful. I stretched releasing all of my tense muscles. \"Ow,\" I looked over at Taylor who was holding his eye, \"Yesterday you throw me down the beach and now you poke me in the eye.\" \"Sorry, I forgot you were there.\" He just shook his head as he stood up he glance back down at me before running a self admiring hand over his chest. \"Soo,\" \"So what?\" \"So, what do you want to do?\" I shrugged picking up a handful of sand and letting it run through my fingers. I stood up to try and dust off the rest of the sand but it didn't want to come off. \"I'm going to a rinse.\" I said walking past him and into the ocean; but only deep enough to get my legs wet. \"Don't drown again.\" Taylor yelled from the beach. \"That was your fault!\" I shouted back to him leaning down to float in the water. Floating was just fine; for every wave that tried to carry me out into the ocean there was one to push me back into shore. \"What are you doing?\" Huh? \"Shouldn't you be looking for max!\" I sat up watching as Lavagirl ran down the beach toward Taylor. \"You did know he was here, right?\" Taylor shrugged crossing his arms, \"No, not like he hands out memos or anything.\" \"Oh I see, too busy with that bimbo to know Max is here.\" yeah, she definitely doesn't like me . I sunk into the water to avoid being seen. \"It's not like I just know when Max is here.\" \"Yeah, but if you weren't so busy cozying up to someone whose gonna disappear maybe you'd know when your friends in trouble!\" \"What are you babbling about, Lavagirl.\" \"Just go ask Max.\" \"Sure, tell me where he is. \"Why don't you go ask your girlfriend!\" Ah! She pointed right at me before storming back up the beach. \"Should we go then?\" Taylor asked. I sighed walking up the beach, \"So much for hiding, you both knew exactly where I was.\" \"You forget I watched you go into the water?\" \"No,\" I said ringing my hair out, \"but Lavagirl knew too; if she was an assassin I'd be dead.\" I laughed following Taylor back to the cave. \"Good thing she's not. Oh, and she was standing up there the whole time.\" He said pointing to the top of a volcano on the other side of the beach. \"Wha- The whole time?\" \"From what I could tell, yea.\" He said reaching the cave and going inside, \"Well at least since this morning.\" And so grows her hatred for my very being. \"Here,\" Taylor said throwing something at me, \"Put that on.\" \"What is it?\" \"It's my sisters, it should fit you. I usually run into trouble around Max so you should have some kind of armor on; and you're kinda a bad luck charm yourself.\" \"Gee thanks,\" I said rolling my eyes, \"but sharks aren't really my thing.\" I said extending the outfit back towards him. \"You seem to like me pretty well,\" He smirked \"Wha- I- SAYS WHO!\" \"Just get dressed, okay.\" Taylor said walking back out to the beach, \"and don't take too long!\" I examined the outfit in my hands, there was too much shark on it for me it needed a…adjustment. {A few minutes later} \"Ok, I'm ready.\" \"Huh? Where's the outfit I gave you?\" \"This is it; I just changed it to fit me better.\" \"It definitely worked; I mean Sharkgirl's going to be mad when she finds out that you cut up her clothes.\" \"Shouldn't we be going were is this Max anyway?\" I waited for him to answer but there was only a slight pause before he began running down the beach. \"Wait up!\" \"Why?\" Taylor said stopping, \"What's the rush, *huff* I thought *huff* you didn't even know where*huff huff* this Max person was.\" \"I knew where he was as soon as he got here, now come on.\" He waited for me to catch up to him before immediately starting to run again. \"What about *huff * your sister? Shouldn't you tell her *huff* where he is?\" \"She's already there.\" I slowed down to catch my breath but Taylor kept running. \"Hey! Wait up!\" It didn't work and Taylor kept running. What's so important that he's gotta run like a maniac. \"I said wait UP!\" Suddenly I was flying down the beach, my feet weren't even on the ground until of course I crashed into Taylor. \"Where'd you come from!\" \"You wouldn't slow down and then I dunno I was flying down the beach.\" \"Oookaay? Well, could you, fly up off me?\" \"Huh? Oh O.O,\" I jumped up pulling Taylor up too, \"Sorry.\" \"Could you fly us to Max.\" \"Yeah, sure I'll just do that. You do realize I don't know how to use any of my powers.\" \"I'm just saying it woulda been helpful, but I guess I can run a bit slowly so you don't have to crash into me again.\" \"Thanks,\" \"And you said you didn't like sharks.\" Taylor smirked jogging down the beach again. \"Hey! That's! argh, GET BACK HERE SO I CAN KICK YOUR BUTT!\" I only had to run after him for a few minutes before he stopped. \"Huh, why'd you stop?\" \"Where here.\" \"All ready? \"Why else do you think I ran at full speed?\" \"You really are a pain in the butt, and I don't see anyone here.\" \"Wait for it…\" Please review, oh and I changed the name of the story since it is in fact a prologue to a different story.[Chapter 4] Heeey, yeah I know shoot me now. Taking so long to update, almost another year.. I am terrible. But anyway! Here it is. So yes read enjoy and you can burn me for the long update if it's crap! Deal :) \"YOU TURD! Why did you lock me out of the cave; do you know how long it toke me to walk all the way around!\" Sharkgirl came running up fist flying and voiced raised. I stepped out of the way as her and Taylor fought until a voice came from down the beach. \"Hey!\" I looked over to see a blonde haired boy walking towards us. \"What's up, Max?\" Taylor said casually dodging an attack, \"I thought you wouldn't be here `til later.\" Max shrugged as he passed me, \"Things get changed.\" \"Enough with the pleasantries get to the point Max.\" Lavagirl came down from one of the volcanoes and they all stood huddled up in their little group. Why did he have to bring HER? I looked over to see Lavagirl glaring at me. I gave a small smile but it didn't work and I retreated down the beach. What they were talking about didn't involve me anyway. I slumped down relaxing against a rock. Every few minutes looking at my wrist only to remember I didn't own a watch. Then I saw something, it was too far down to see but it looked big. It was hunched over and hiding behind the cluster of rocks. \"H-hey guys.\" I looked over at them and then back at the strange figure; it was getting closer. \"Guuys!\" Still no response, whatever they were talking about it was taking all of their attention. \"Guess it's up to me,\" I mumbled rising to my feet, \"Let's see if I can pull off this \"superhero\" thing.\" I looked down at my hands but nothing happen, no electricity no glow, tingle nothing. I closed my eyes and tried concentrating after a few second I felt my hands tingle. Something started to form between them, a ball of energy. I looked up and did my best to aim at the figure, the energy shot from my hands and down the beach. It hit and a cloud of sand exploded around the area. It seemed to have worked. That's how you get it done! I thought quietly congratulating myself. However, when the sand cloud died down the creature wasn't gone; it was heading right for us! I turned around stumbling toward the rest of the group; we had to get out of here. \"HEEY!\" \"What do you want?\" Lavagirl barked; I started to answer but tripped bumping into Taylor I looked at him worried and quickly pointed down the beach. \"I think I made it angry!\" Everyone's head shot up at the sound snarling and they dove to opposite sides as it charged through us. I side stepped missing it by only a small fraction and turned watching as it prepared to charge again. Everyone started shouting, \"Julien, get out of there!\" but it was too late it was charging and I was frozen in place. Then, my instincts kicked in. I jumped at the last second flipping over beast, when I landed we were face to face. A moment past before it charged again; I spun out of the way releasing an energy blast into the beast's side. There was a howl and it fell to the ground. I waited for a second on the defense but when it didn't stand back up I relaxed and the others began to emerge from their hiding places. \"Uh, nice job,\" Max said jumping over a branch, \"by the way;\" he glanced over to the others and then nodded toward me, \"Who is she?\" Sharkgirl vaulted over her cover dusting sand from her boots. \"You mean you didn't dream her up?\" she looked at Max who simply shook his head. Lavagirl came back into view pointing an accusing finger in my direction, \"Then she's the other one!\" \"It's more likely a creation of the other one.\" Sharkgirl added/corrected \"Either way,\" She said turning to me primed for a fight; I put hands trying to calm her but it did the opposite and put her on the defense. I stepped back a few paces stumbling into someone, looking back I saw it was Taylor. \"Calm down,\" He said placing a hand on each of my shoulders, \"she hasn't even done anything to deserve such accusations.\" \"She got us attacked by one of those things.\" Lavagirl said crossing her arms angrily. \"Two actually;\" Sharkgirl interjected, \"within a day.\" \"Two?\" \"Yeah, we ran into one back at the cave.\" \"Not my fault.\" I added, \"And I tried to stop that one just now.\" \"More like lead it toward us.\" Lavagirl said stepping forward, \"No, no that's not what I was doing at all!\" \"Girls!\" Max said stepping between Lavagirl and me as a barrier, \"Calm down, everything is confusing right now so we shouldn't blame people so hastily.\" \"When did you get so level headed?\" Taylor jokingly ruffled Max's hair who causally shooed him off. \"Well apparently I have to be, everyone's gone crazy.\" There was a guilty look between Lavagirl and Sharkgirl before that both sighed \"Fiiine.\" they said crossing their arms. \"I guess we shouldn'tjump to conclusions.\" Lavagirl mumbled something else before heading back toward her volcano but pauseing briefly she leaned toward my ear and whispered, \"I'm still watching you.\" A shiver ran down my spine as she brushed by me and continued on her way. A quick glance around the group showed me that no one else had heard or seen any of that. Hey, Julien. You picking this up? You alright? I looked over at Taylor who was giving me a concerned look-those must have been his thoughts- I smiled and nodded; I had caused enough problems for one day. Therewere a few more exchanges an after that Taylor decided to toke me back to the cave. It was quiet the whole way there, which only made the distance seem even longer. I lagged back, my mind to distracted to keep up with him. I think Taylor caught on cause he kept looking back and after a while he slowed his pace a bit. \"A lot on your mind?\" I stopped at the entrance shrugging slightly, \"Hard not to think about the amount of people that hate you for no reason.\" Taylor leaned forward slipping his hand into mine. \"I don't hate you.\" he smiled. \"Thanks.\" I stood on my tip toes leaning to give him a kiss on the cheek. \"Get away from him!\" I was suddenly shoved hard and stumbled back before falling to the ground. \"I'm not taking any chances with you!\" I propped up on my elbow to see Sharkgirl scowling over me. \"Sharkgirl,\"Taylor said grabbing her arm, \"what is wrong with you!\" \"I know were not supposed to jump to conclusions or whatever but that doesn't mean we should trust her completely either. We still don't know who she is!\" \"You're over reacting Sharkgirl, Julien is not dangerous! \"You can't see it because for some reason you're all hypnotized. Seriously, where is the brother that was always focused on the mission!\" She glared at me one last time and stormed out. There was an awkward pause before Taylor grabbed my arm helping me up, \"you okay?\" I nodded slightly; he leaned closer and I shifted my head so his kiss landed on my cheek. \"I-\" I paused turning away from him, \"What if I am like they say; what if I am this other persons creation and an-\" my voice cracked taking away my words as the tears started pouring down my face. \"Hey, hey, hey.\" Taylor said side stepping back into my view, \"don't say that.\" He cupped my face forcing me to make eye contact. \"You're not any of those things.\" \"H-how can you know?\" \"Call it, instinct.\" He said wiping a stray tear away with his thumb, \"You're a good person.\" He leaned in pressing our lips together; it was a short kiss just to reassure me but I didn't' let him pull away. Our lips separated for a moment and I put a hand on his neck pulling him back towards me. He let out a moan pulling me in closer his tongue sneaking past my lips on into my mouth. It felt like electricity. There was a gush of noise before a wave of ice cold water washed over us. I gasped jumping back a step from surprise; Taylor let out a growl next to me and I followed his eye line to Sharkgirl who was standing by the pond of water. \"Jeez, I leave for a minutes an-\" she was interrupted by a string of water to the face, courtesy of Taylor. \"What was that for!\" \"Payback: You can't just come barging in and splash people.\" \"ba- barging in! I live here! Just cause you decided to get all hot and bothered doe-\" \"Whaat! You don't even know what you're talking about.\" \"ooooh I'm sorry! I must've seen it wrong! What were you doing then! Helping her swallow your face!\" You can't see it, but there's a huge question mark hovering above my head. The argument quickly blurred into words I couldn't understand and then escalated into a full blown fist fight. Something had set them off, watching them they didn't even seem human anymore. They were in some kind of frenzy. I stood there frozen and confused I didn't know if I should interject or even if I could stop them if I did. But I had to do something; I made fake guns with my fingers pointing one at each of them. Here goes nothing . I concentrated hard and pulled the \"trigger\": they both jumped. \"You zapped me!\" They both shouted, anger now intently directed toward me, \"I- I it's just y-you guys where fighting an-\" \"You want in!\" Sharkgirl said pulling a large amount of water of the pond, \"I'll let you in.\" \"Calm down,\" Taylor said rolling his eyes \"You have such an exploding temper.\" \"Oh, and you don't .\" They glared at each other for a moment before Sharkgirl dropped the water and pushed pass me \"I'm leaving,\" she said bumping my shoulder hard enough to turn me around. \"Do whatever you want.\" Lavagirl and Sharkgirl do NOT like Julien very much do they! Which is such a contrast between their relationship with her in the later stories. I gotta say though, writting them being mean to her, why challenging, is quite ..dare i saw FUN :) REVIEW PLEASE! ^_^","LastChapter":"Heeey, yeah I know shoot me now.

It was not like he would be gone forever, but she dreaded every evening when he had to return to sea, to his world. It reminded her of the gap between their worlds, their lives, them. It reminded her of how they could never be as close as they wanted to be. She sighed. It was hard when your crush was the complete opposite to you. They could barely touch each other. He had attempted to hold her hand on more than one occasion and obviously tried to ignore the burning that came with it, but either one of them always pulled away because of that. She turned around and trudged through the sand, back to her home. Maybe someday she would get over this petty crush and just move on. Yeah. Doubt it. The crisp morning air cooled her down from the inside as she calmly walked down the beach, making the lava in her clothes turn a darker orange. (Max's theory about the lava being in her skin was just an exaggeration of her body temperature). It was a beautiful day. The sun was peeking over the horizon, lalas were floating off in the distance and waves were rolling over the water, stretching themselves up against the beach and retreating. Her fear of water had eased up a lot since she had trained herself to control her temperature, and she was now even able to stand as much as ankle deep in the waves without speeding for the nearest volcano. Of course, she could only survive in water and around ice, just not in falling snow and stuff like that. The waves were nearly touching her when she stopped in her tracks, a completely strange smell reaching her. Looking down, she saw that the water was...pink? She kneeled down on the sand (the golden material she usually wore was wisely left behind whenever she went down to the beach) and felt the water in her hand. It felt different, almost softer, for lack of a better description. She stood up, careful not to shake the droplets off her fingers, and ran back to the volcanoes. She ran straight into a cave where Max had dreamed up a huge labratory-like control room with a supercomputer. She pressed a few buttons with her dry hand, and a tube sprung up from the desktop. She scraped as much water as possible from her hand into the tube and instructed the computer to analize it. Information popped up onto the screen, a huge title displaying the words \" PINK GILLFISH ESSENCE\" This particular liquid is released through the breathing of large groups of female Pink Gillfish that are ready to mate, attracting male Pink Gillfish. The pink-colored substance also has a surprising effect on male sharks, and the results are often more effective as on the intended target. Her first thought was Sharkboy. Would he be affected by the essence? Would he change? It is important that males of all species stay as far from affected sharks as possible. It would immediately consider you as a threat and go as far as to breach onto the shore to kill you. Wow. Powerful stuff. She only hoped Sharkboy was alright, and everything around him. Let's be honest, he's not the best guy to deal with when he feels threatened. Why was the irony so against her today? She shut the computer down and walked back onto the beach. She and Sharkboy had arranged to meet up at the usual spot on the beach and then go explore the tunnels they had found last week. That day, she passed time staring at the horizon, throwing small stones on the beach to see the waves take them away, and doing all sorts of small time-consuming things. He never came, and she had a horrible feeling why. It was nearly noon the next day. She was lying on the beach, chewing on lava rocks (just because everyone else hated them, didn't mean she had to. Really, they weren't that bad!) and looking up at the sky, looking for cloud-shapes. A dissapointed giraffe. A donkey with a crutch. Marshmallows being shot out of a ship's cannon. A chihuahua chewing on a horse's ear. The sun was warm and the sound of the waves calming. Soon enough, her eyes were starting to feel heavy, the sand below her comfortable. She was almost immediately awakened by a familiar scent, and sat straight up in an instant. Sharkboy was standing over her, blocking the sharp sunlight from her face, water dripping from his body. He seemed normal. She cautiously stood up, his expression never changing. He stood a head taller than her, and he had to slightly look down as his eyes never left hers. He didn't say a word, and his expression was unreadable. Something was wrong. Looking closer, she noticed something wrong with him, with his eyes. There were fine flecks of dark purple sprinkled across brown, something he had never had before. A soft, low growl from him confirmed her suspicions, but it was too late... AN: Sup guys! Thanks for reading! Just wanna clear up that I know they are supposed to be on Earth, according to the movie, but I thought it would be more fun to shoot this scene on Planet Drool (really, who likes a realistic world anyway?). Anyway, hope you dudes liked it! !Watcha![Chapter 2] Chapter 2 He was growling, that was never a good sign. She moved slowly, taking a step back to create more distance between them. His expression almost immediately turned into a full-on death glare as he mirrored her movements. What the heck was going on with him? All she could do was to continue backing up as fear gripped her heart, making her temperatures go sky high, visible heatwaves erupting from her. Her back hit a wall of cooled magma, but instead of stopping as she expected him to, he continued to advance towards her, stopping when his face was only a few centimeters away from hers, his hands against the rock on either sides of her body. This was it. He was going to kill her. The rage was building in his expression, and she was nearly dying from the fear! She closed her eyes tight, waiting for something, anything, to happen. Except for what really happened. He pressed his lips against hers, hard. His hands were on her shoulders, keeping her strictly in place. At first she was shocked that he would do that. But his brutal actions towards her frightened her, and she raised her temperature as high as she could, the magma behind her melting. But she could feel his teeth sharpening behind his lips, a vicious growl making her squeak in fear and quickly lower her temperature, in fear of a sharkfrenzy. She felt his hands leaving her shoulders and quickly snaking around her waist, pushing her tighter against him, nearly squeezing the air from her lungs. It wasn't long until one of his hands started moving from it's position. Crap. It slid back over her waist, to her stomach. Her hands formed fists where they had landed against his chest and she tried to back away from him as his hand traveled over her chest and up to her neck, bringing her impossibly closer to him, his claws nearly breaking the skin on her neck. She felt an almost literal shock travel through her as his tounge pushed up against her lips, demanding entrance as his razorsharp lower teeth lightly scraped against her mouth. She couldn't deny him, and she hesitantly let him enter her mouth, his tounge vigorously moving around, as if desperately searching for something. His hand started moving again, this time towards the front of her collar, lightly tugging on it. Her hand shot up and grabbed his in surprise and defence, her other hand pushing back against his chest. No freaking way, tunabreath! His hand rotated and grabbed her wrist, nearly cracking it as he slowly brought her hand to her side, making her squirm in pain, trying to shake him off. The pressure on her wrist only increased, making the burning tears stream down her face. She was shure her lips were bruised when he finally pulled away and she desperately gasped for bigger quantities of air inbetween trying to control herself from crying as his hand was still tightly wrapped around her wrist. He pressed his cheek to hers, whispering to her: \"I wouldn't do that again if I were you.\" She wimpered, shrinking back as he released her wrist. How the heck was he withstanding the heat like that, normally it would kill him. She remembered something she had learned from Linus, the best way to defend yourself from a guy. She really hoped this works. She silently moved her feet on the sand, slightly stepping forward and... He crumbled into a ball on the spot! Bullseye! She had no time to celebrate her escape, however, as she took her chance and ran back up the valcano, knowing that he would get over it soon. Speak of the devil. She was halfway up the valcano when he ran past her at a blinding speed and stopped right in front of her, making her nearly trip as she stopped. He jumped her, but she managed to dodge him just in time. Big mistake. He turned to her, revealing three rows of true shark teeth, and absolute fury on his face. She felt herself shrinking as he looked all the bigger. \"Meap,\" she squeaked. AN: Bat: I would like to introduce you all to some of my friends. First up, Ebony, a (trademarked) character I had designed. Ebony: Suuup! Bat: Then there's Enya, from the game Shall we date: Destiny ninja. Enya: Hey. By the way, Bat's taken! Bat: No I'm not! And don't look at me like yo mama don't feed you, I ain't yo cheesecake! Enya: Uuuuh...what? Bat: Then there's Cuid, my puppy who always has an opinion on everything! *pointedly looks at Cuid* Cuid: Woof! Bat: Aw, stuff it. Nobody wants to know that. Anyway, then, of course, there is our guests: Sharkboy and Lavagirl. Sharkboy: What the hell?! I get kicked in the nuts, how's that fair? This story's really taking a turn for the worst! Lavagirl: B-but...I like my V-card...*pouts* Sharkboy: Hey chill, woah, that's not what I meant! You won't lose it. *looks at Bat* Right? Bat : ... Lavagirl: Bat...that doesn't happen in this story, right? Both start looking scared as Bat hesitates. Bat: ...You guys are awesome, thanks for reading! Lavagirl: Bat! Bat: ...MEAP?!...[Chapter 3] Chapter 3 He turned to her, revealing three rows of true shark teeth, and absolute fury on his face. She felt herself shrinking as he looked all the bigger. \"Meap,\" she squeaked. He roared, looking ready to rip her to shreds. She was trembling, completely rooted to the spot by fear, his razorsharp fangs the only thing she could possibly see, other than the full dark purple of his eyes. She whispered a slight \"Shit.\" before he jumped her again, this time completely toppling her over. His hands pinned her down on the ground. She yelped as her injured wrist was slammed against the rock. His face was an inch from hers, his sharp teeth bared and his breaths quick, growling lowly. She started trembling, the blood draining from her face as his glare intensified. \"No more little tricks from you,\" he growled. \"Understand?\" She barely managed a quick nod before his lips were on hers once more, this time with even more force. She tasted a bit of blood in her mouth as her lip got cut, making her cringe in disgust. Without thinking, she tried to escape from under him, but he only held her tighter, quickly lowering himself sothat his entire body was resting on hers. She couldn't help the slight feeling of lust creeping up inside her. Damn teenage hormones! She pushed that thought aside and tried to concerntrate on thinking of a way out. As if reading her thoughts, Sharkboy only increased the pressure on her wrists, clearly warning her not to protest. She wimpered as his mouth started travelling away from hers, his lips moving down to her jaw, then her neck. Incredibly uncomfortable, she froze in place and simply hoped for some sort of miracle to get him off her. She gasped as his sharp teeth scratched at the skin on her neck and she instinctively tried to move away from him, making him even madder. He removed his left hand from her wrist, placing it on the other side of her neck to keep her in place. She put her free hand on his shoulder, as if it would help to keep him away, but of course it made zero difference. He had always been much stronger than her, and with this damn essence he was twice as strong as before. It was basically like a chihuahua trying to get away from an overgrown polar bear. Just when things were becoming a bit too heated for her taste (never thought she would feel that particular way), she heard the blessed sound of singing bubbles appearing above them. Sharkboy stopped immediately, sitting up and covering his ears as the colourful little bubbles sang loudly around his head. Lavagirl was still half-trapped as he was on her waist, but she took her chance and pushed him off her as hard as she could. The unexpected countermeasure and lack of balance made him topple over and off her, and she jumped up. \"Hurry, sing louder!\" she said to the bubbles before she ran off again. She hoped for her life that Sharkboy wouldn't catch her now. He would definately kill her...or worse... After what felt like forever, she reached the mouth of the valcano and jumped in without a second thought. Half off the ground, she felt something just missing her by a millimeter, and she knew it could only be Sharkboy. As she broke through the surface of the lava, she saw him standing on the egde, trying to decide if he should dive in after her. Every time he had the courage to jump, he stopped himself at the last second. Finally, he roared out of frustration, throwing his fists in the air and stomping off like a tantrum-baby. Lavagirl couldn't help but laugh in relief and victory, quietly thanking the annoying singing bubbles for saving her before diving down into the lava again. There was a cave in the valcano, right next to the flowing lava and in just the right position to not have lava flowing into it. She climbed through the tunnel that lead to it and entered the cave. On the far side of the cave, there was a small puddle of thick, gooish liquid that she has never been able to identify. She walked over to it to see her reflection in the liquid. Her lips were bruised and there was a cut in the corner of her mouth, thin lines of blood were running down her neck from the bite marks and her collar was a tad bit torn from his sharp claws. It actually wasn't as bad as she thought it would be. The same could not be said about her wrist, however. It was swollen and heavily bruised, and it hurt a lot to just move it. It wasn't broken, but definately severely injured. She sighed. The situation was hopeless. Sharkboy was in a hormone-crazy state, she was his only available target and she had no idea how to cure him. The only way to save him, was to get down to the lab and find out how. AN: Lavagirl is sitting in the corner, furious and wrist bandaged. Bat: Wooh! This one was an intense workout. Took me days to find the right stuff to say. Thanks for reading, guys! Lavagirl: *burning up* Grrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr! Bat: Uuuuh...Sharkboy? Is she okay? Sharkboy: I'm not stopping her, man. You brought what's coming on yourself when you added those annoying bubbles. Bat: Uh...huh? Lavagirl turns to Bat, her eyes glowing. Sharkboy: Oh yeah. Lavafrenzy. Bat: WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH! ... Bat: Uuuuh...huuuu *not moving from the blackened ground around her*[Chapter 4] Chapter 4 Lavagirl had been hiding in the same cave for days, and it had been driving her crazy. Sharkboy had been scratching at the rock above her on and off, showing no signs of giving up. She was concerned that he might hurt himself. He wasn't there now, however, and she had to take her chance if she ever wanted to get out of there. She swam up the valcano, breaking through the surface to find everything quiet and peaceful. Good, no sign of Sharkboy. She carefully reached for the side and pulled herself out, double-checking that he wasn't anywhere. He wasn't, but she didn't let her guard down as she cautiously walked down towards the beach. She expected him to just jump out from behind every rock, tree or structure. Sneaking around like a ninja, she dodged her way over to the beach while resisting the urge to sing the mission-impossible tune, lying down on top of where the cave was. She hung her head over the side, peeking into the cave to see if he was there. According to her upside-down vision, the coast was clear and she jumped down, walking in like Indiana Jones himself: like a BOSS! She quickly turned on the computer, aware of her unknown deadline. She typed in Pink Gillfish Essence - Shark Contamination Cure and searched. What came up made her nearly deflate in dismay. No cure has been invented for the shark contamination of Pink Gillfish Essence. However, there are various ways to stop the effect it has on male sharks. The easier way would be for the shark to find a female and mate with it. Lavagirl was sitting at the desk with her elbow on the table and her chin resting in her hand, her fingers over her mouth. She stared wide-eyed at the screen, her face feeling a tad bit hotter than usual. NOT. THE. FUCK. Another way is to wait a full season for the water to be cleared of the essence. The last option is to let the essence wear off, wich should take two weeks. The shark must be kept out of contaminated water and in a safe enviroment, since it is extremely aggressive and will very likely harm itsself. Even worse. Just a week without water would kill him, and all the water of Planet Drool's oceans were contaminated with this stuff. There was just no other way, she would have to wait three whole months for the water to clear out. Three months of hiding in the same place. Three months of not seeing Sharkboy. It just got better and better. \"Well, ain't this a surprise.\" She felt the blood drain from her face at the deep sound of the voice of the infamous Sharkboy. Oh. Crap. She quickly jumped up and looked at him, a sheepish smile on her face. She noticed he was soaking wet as she backed up against the computer. \"Hehe...hey, look who it is, Sharkboy! My...old friend...\" Sharkboy gave her a smug look, slowly walking forward. Her heart was pounding overtime, her hands shaking as she pressed herself up against a wall, him standing over her. \"Well,\" he chuckled meniacally. \"This shure as hell better not turn out like the last time.\" He glared straight into her eyes. \"For your sake.\" She started moving slowly, almost unnoticingly, to her left, her eyes never leaving him. Then, in the blink of an eye, she was gone, running out of the cave at the speed of light. There was no way she would actually get away from him, but it was definately worth the try. As she ran, she could hear him right behind her, yet he never caught her. She musthave been really fast, or he had broken his leg. She didn't know exactly how long she had been running, but she found herself in the Land of Thought, where the Train of Thought ran through. Sharkboy was nowhere to be seen, and she stopped to catch her breath. All she could hear was water running somewhere near, the train probably far away, but she had no idea where Sharkboy could be. She looked behind her, seeing nothing. As she turned her head back to the front, she was looking straight at an armoured chest. \"Boo.\" She backed away quickly, only to trip over something and land on something cold, bumpy and unstable. A slab of chocolate floating on the Stream of Contiousness. Sharkboy stepped onto the chocolate boat with her as they entered a colourful world of candy. She jumped up and frantically backed away, only able to go as far as the edge. Sharkboy calmly walked up to her, a smug look on his face. He stood against her, his face only an inch from hers, an intense glare making her feel like jumping into the milk-river would be better. He suddenly kissed her again, but not as she would expect him to. This kiss was gentle, soft and sweet. Not something she would expect from a raging guy. She willed herself not to give in to him, but she couldn't even pull away, her mind completely overwhelmed by his lips against hers. Just as she was actually starting to enjoy it, he pulled away and dissapeared. She stood still for a few seconds, then pulled herself together and looked around, finding no signs of him. She sank to her knees and put her face in her hands. She couldn't. She would NOT give in to this, to his little game. She had to stay focused and keep away from him, otherwise he would have her right where he wanted her. She stood up and took a deep breath, trying to clear her mind. She had to get back to the valcanoes, he couldn't get her there. Just as she thought this, the chocolate bumped into the bank of the river, making her fall onto the frosting-covered ground. She quickly stood up and tried figuring out how to get back. She had no idea where she was, and she wasn't very good at directions, either. She had to get out of there, though, so she ran in a random direction anyway. She wasn't shure where she was going, but the footsteps behind her willed her not to stop. She kept running until everything was different again. It was colder, and she felt her power starting to weaken bit by bit. Looking around, she saw that she was in the Arctic Land of Knowledge, the most dangerous place for her. She was in the middle of a heavy snowstorm, and her temperature was dropping. As she turned, she found Sharkboy standing behind her on the ice with a dark expression, wind blowing around him, carrying snowflakes. He was simply standing there, as if waiting for her to...do something, although she didn't know what. She hid her weakness, standing up straight and looking at him. There was no way out of this. The ice was slippery under her now that she has stopped, she was weaker than ever and he obviously had the upper hand in their situation. \"What the hell do you want?\" she angrily asked. \"What's with the whole game of tag, huh?! Why can't you just kill me and get it over with?!\" His face darkened further, a small half-smile appearing on his face. \"Oh, my dear Lavagirl.\" He sounded more like an evil emporor or something, and she tried not to show how much he was scaring her. \"That's because, as much as I have so many things planned for you, I do still enjoy our little games. Just seeing you cowering under my manipulation gives me such pleasure.\" As he said this, he walked around her, looking her up and down. She stiffened. Things? What things?! She tried ignoring the not-so-appealing images that flooded their way into her mind. His hand lightly rested on her waist as he stood right in front of her. \"Because, you see,\" his face darkened again. \"The man is the hunter.\" She immediately recognised what Max's mother had told her once, and Sharkboy musthave heard it with his sensitive ears. He suddenly pushed her over, both of them landing with him on top of her. The freezing ice against her made her strength plummet even faster, and she started shivering. He had her hands pinned down at her sides, his face only a centimeter from hers as he glared. She weakly tried getting away from him, but he only chuckled at her before his lips brutally landed on hers again. His hands left hers and started travelling up her arms, to her shoulders and down to her waist. She wanted to kick his guts flat, but she could barely move. He was on her again, his entire body the only heat she could feel. As his kisses became harder, hungrier, she felt his hands moving up her sides, then, to her horror, his claws tore through her suit, down to her hips. She tried her best to push him off her, but she had little to no strength. His gloved hands slowly found thier way through the tears and to her back. She gritted her teeth and grabbed fistfulls of his sleeves at the feel of his sharp claws against her skin. He pulled away, looking straight into her eyes, a look of victory on his face. She caught her breath, looking back at him. She didn't have much power left in her. \"Sharkboy,\" she managed between her shivers of cold. \"Look, I don't know exactly how that stuff works, but I know this isn't you.\" He didn't move or say anything, just looked at her. \"I know you're in there. And no matter what happens, just wanna say...\" Her voice was a mere whisper now, her power completely gone. \"...that...I love you.\" For a moment, she saw a sign of conflict in his eyes, a sign of someone fighting back. She might never know, however, as everything went black... AN: Bat: Ooooooh! What will happen to our little friends now? Lavagirl: ARE YOU CRAZY?! This dufus is not touching me! I. WILL. KILL. HIM! Ebony: *laughing secretly* Bat: Aw, c'mon, show a little compassion to our readers, they want a little action, too. This is the first time I actually get the dang courage to go this far. Sharkboy: You better not go any farther, chika! Bat: Chillax , I have it all figured out. Thanks for reading, dudes![Chapter 5] Bat: Last chapter, dudes! Wooh! Lavagirl: Wait...you said that...you know...would happen in this story, right? If this is the last chapter, then... Sharkboy: Oh. Crap. Bat: What? I never said that! Ebony: But you implied it! That means you have to do it! A statement is as good as a promise! You have to! Bat: Woah, no! I didn't say or imply that, and I most definately am NOT going to write that! I just didn't answer their question. Sharkboy and Lavagirl: Phew... Bat: Anyway, I hope you guys enjoy it. Chapter 5 Sharkboy shook his head, feeling the dizziness hit him like a sledgehammer. He had finally regained control over himself. He had been fighting against this stuff for two weeks, but could never even begin to gain the upper hand. Looking down, he gasped at the sight of Lavagirl, uncontious and weak, with a lot of injuries, remembering how he had gained control. \"...I love you...\" It had given him new hope, a reason to keep fighting back, and he had finally won. But now he had Lavagirl to save, so he picked her up. Looking around, he kind of remembered coming into the Arctic Land of Knowledge, and he was able to quickly calculate their way back to the valcanoes. He adjusted her in his arms, holding her closer sothat her head was resting against his shoulder, and started running in the direction of where they came from. As he entered the Land of Milk and Cookies, he nearly slipped on frosting, cursing the overly-sweet junk for slowing him down. He jumped over the Stream of Consciousness and made his way into the Land of thought, dodging brains and jumping over hills. It felt like forever, but he finally reached the beach, running up the valcano as he jumped over rivers of lava flowing down the giant magma-mountain. Just as he had done three years ago, he tossed her in the lava without a second thought. This time, however, he didn't stand there like an idiot, but ducked behind a huge boulder, just in time before the lava came exploding from the mouth of the valcano again. She could feel her power returning. The blood boiling in her veins once again as the comforting heat filled her, adrinaline making her feel momentarily invincible, like the power of the universe belonged to her. She opened her eyes to a light that would be overwhelming to any other, but to her it meant power, freedom. She felt her body mend itsself, her heart pumping strongly again as the lava around her moved. She stood up, standing on the side of the valcano, one thought reaching her. \"Sharkboy!\" It came out more as a command than a call, but he appeared from behind a rock, clearly both frightened and amazed. She didn't wonder or think, she just ran to him. The only other thought that she could manage at the moment, was to automatically try and cool herself down. The moment she reached him, she threw her arms around him. She felt him stiffen at her heat, but he eventually relaxed and put his arms around her, holding her close to him. Being in his arms allowed her to calm herself down. But it was in that moment that the lost memories of the past twenty-four hours flooded into her mind, making her pull back. He looked at her, appearing concerned that something might be wrong. \"Are you okay?\" she asked, although she could see his brown eyes revealing no signs of anyone other than himself. He nodded, a gentle smile crossing his face as he rested his hand on her cheek. He pulled her closer again, holding her as his hand left her cheek and ran through her hair. \"I'm just so glad you're fine. I thought I might lose you again,\" he whispered, and she felt him placing a single kiss on top of her head. She relaxed in his arms, cuddling deeper into his chest and just enjoying the moment. After a few minutes of silence, Sharkboy spoke up: \"Lavagirl...I'm so sorry about what happened, I...I just couldn't control it.\" She looked up and gave him a sweet smile. \"It's okay, Sharky. That wasn't you at all, I know. Besides, you probably don't remember anything, right?\" But Sharkboy only shook his head. \"No, I remember everything. I could hear and see everything that went on, I just couldn't control myself.\" Her face heated up at the memory of the last thing she had told him. \"You remember...everything?\" As if knowing exactly what she meant, he smiled at her, putting his hand on her cheek again as he held her closer. \"Everything.\" This time, when his lips landed on hers in a feather-light kiss, she accepted it. They held eachother closer, planning to never let go again. Yup, life has strange ways of bringing you to your destination. It's full of mysteries and thrills, adventure just waiting to surprise you. Sometimes things don't turn out the way you planned it from the start, but it always seems to work out. Life is full of surprises, crazy times with crazy friends, crazy laughs, crazy life, and crazy love. AN: Bat: Yaay! My first multi-chapter story finished in five years!

There have been some minor changes in this chapter to help me with the flow of the rest of the story. It is still the same for the most part. I do not own the characters, just this plot. Thanks so much for reading. Hope you all enjoy! Chapter 1~ Making up Holden walked into Sean's condo. He picked a flower they had planted themselves and went inside. Finding him asleep, he ran the flower down the side of his face, as he smiled down at the man he loved. He had been away on business, and he hoped Sean knew how important he was to him. After stepping off the plane, he wasn't in any hurry to go face the man who he had asked to make a choice. He was sick of being a secret; he wanted a commitment from the man he loved. While he waited for a taxi, the televisions in the waiting area aired the news. The big story of the day was Sean Jackson coming out of the closet and staying in the game. He couldn't wait to get home. \"Hey,\" Sean smiled up at Holden, beyond thrilled that he was there. \"Hey, yourself.\" He said dropping down to Sean's level and kissed him slowly savoring their reunion. Pulling back he couldn't keep the smile off his face, \"I saw the news.\" Was all he said before he pulled Sean up from his chair, and into his strong arms. Their lips crashed together as Sean tired to show Holden how much he meant to him without words. Their tongues tangled, and groping each other as they stumbled their way to the bedroom. Sean pulled away, needing to breath, and some answers as to where they stood. While Holden never hid that his sexuality; they never went anywhere as a couple, only as friends. He wanted to know how this was going to work. Holden had slightly more experience, and while Sean was nervous, he wanted to really be with him. \"So you're later than normal. Was there traffic?\" \"No, it just took forever to get a taxi.\" \"Taxi? What happened to the car service?\" \"Well I met this woman on the plane; she is a Captain in the Army. Her name is Kate, and she was flying 14 hours across the country, just to spend a few hours with someone she loves. Before she had to turn around and head back to her post. There was a very long line for taxi, and the shuttle was worse. I gave her the car service so she could get to him faster. I'm glad I did. I never would have caught the news otherwise. \" \"Wow. You have never let anyone use the care service.\" \"It was for love. Today love rules all.\" He said pulling Sean over to their bed, and pushing him down onto it.\" \"Yes, it does.\" Was all the response Sean could manage before Holden's lips crashed onto his. The two began slowly undressing and exploring each other. By the time they were both in their boxers there was heavy panting and an urgency to be close to one another that they hadn't felt for a long time. As if reading the other's thoughts, they each slipped a hand into the other's boxers, causing loud moans to erupt from both of them. They stayed in perfect sync as they brought each other over the edge. They managed to clean up enough to get into the shower. They meticulously cleaned each other, scrubbing every inch of exposed skin before Holden sunk down to his knees taking Sean into his mouth. Starting at the head, and licking the underside before gently sucking the tip, Sean moaned and ran his hands into Holden's hair, angling to get more of himself farther into the warm wetness of his lover's mouth. Holden greedily took more relaxing the back of his throat to fit as much of his lover's member as he could into his warm wet mouth. He hollowed out his cheeks to add suction. His hands held Sean's hips, moving them along with his mouth; he slowly moved one of his hands to stimulate the part of him that he could not fit into his mouth. Sean soon started thrusting his hips in time with Holden's stroking, all to soon Sean couldn't told it anymore and climaxed, Holden swallowed every drop that he was offered before releasing Sean from his mouth. \"You have always been amazing at that\" Sean said pulling Holden up from his knees and crashing their bodies together. \"I aim to please, babe\" Holden smiled as he turned off the water and stepped out of the shower, they took turns slowly drying each other before heading back into their bedroom and turning in for the night. Thank you so much for reading. Sorry it's taken so long to get back to it. Please Review ~Bunny[Chapter 2] I am SOOO sorry that it has taken me so long to get back to this story. Life and writer's block got in the way, but it will defiantly be updated on a regular basis from now on. I have the next chapter completed and the rest of the story outlined. I can't promise any schedule right now, as I am in school and it might not be every week. I hope you all enjoy the rest of their story and that the wait was worth it. Chapter 2. Beginnings The Couple had met completely by accident at some fund raiser that Holden had been asked to go to by a friend. Sean was at the event for a reason they never really figured out. Neither had been looking forward to that night, the fake smiles, uncomfortable come-ons from women who were out for a good time, or looking to land Mr. hotshot football player. Half way through the event, Holden's date got sick, but insisted that he stay to make their donation. Seating got messed up somehow and the two ended up at the same table. Both felt the attraction right away, and they spend the rest of the event talking and laughing, as if they had been friends since grade school. At the end of the night they exchanged numbers and made plans to have drinks to continue their brainstorming about an idea that they had come up with during dinner. Neither wanted to get their hopes up for anything more than friendship; but drinks turned into a lot more without them having to have that awkward 'where is this going' conversation. Things happened naturally for them, with only small bumps along the way. Dinners were a regular part of their relationship, usually disguised as a business or a private dinner in one of their homes. They slowly came out to their families for each other, but didn't want it to go beyond that. The only other people that knew about them were Alex and James, though they hadn't been told. The couples had met through friends on a 'getaway' vacation. Not something Sean or Holden ever would have done, except they had both been invited separately, so they took the opportunity to get away together. The group was a mix of singles and couples. It was a great time for everyone. Everyone, except for Holden. He had been struggling with their decision to continue to hide their relationship, for a while but hadn't said anything. The women in their group and ones they met on the trip kept throwing themselves at both Sean and Holden, but it seemed that Holden was the only one discouraging them. Watching his partner shamelessly flirt with women in front of him was like rubbing salt in an already raw wound. After a week of watching it happen, then having to sneak into each other's rooms so they could be together, he couldn't take it anymore. They ended up getting into a fight. Holden was sick of hiding. He told Sean that he didn't want to have to sneak around to see the man he loved. That if something didn't change, he couldn't be with him anymore. Sean just stood there, shocked at what had just happened. The silence was loaded so Holden took off to find a bar to drown his pain in, rather than face being rejected. James and Alex had a room right next to Sean's. They had overheard everything, and felt that they needed to help the couple before their stupidity drove them apart. James followed Holden, they way he hadn't followed Alex when they were in a similar position. Alex knocked on the still open door to find Sean still standing frozen, scared to admit that he had screwed up so badly. It wasn't until Alex had made him sit that he even registered the relative stranger in his hotel room. Sean was not forced to make a choice: his heart, or his 'image'. It might have taken him a little while to figure out exactly what he was going to do, but with the help of their new friends Sean to do the very thing he had been avoiding his whole life, be he was happy to make that sacrifice to keep the man he loved. He only wished he had done it before, and not wasted all that time scared. He just prayed that he wasn't too late to get a second chance. \"So James called yesterday. He wanted to know if we wanted to go to dinner with him and Alex\" Holden said he and Sean were in bed cuddled up. \"Yeah? What did you tell him?\" They hadn't really talked about going out as a couple yet, let alone double dating with some of the friends that had known about them before Sean's big announcement. \"I told them that I'd talk to you about it. I know we haven't made an decisions yet, and that you just came out, and that you want to take us slow… but I'd love to be able to go out to dinner with friends and be able to hold your hand.\"Holden said barely taking a breath, he wanted so badly to be able to show his love to others, and not have to hide it. Sean coming out was just the first step in their journey together. \"Going to dinner sounds like a good idea.\" Sean replied placing a soft kiss on Holden neck before rolling him onto his back and continuing to kiss him until they were both breathless. Switching back to his neck and continuing until he was on his knees between his lover's legs, both of them painfully hard. Holden reached over into the bed side table and retrieved the lube necessary for them to be intimate. Returning to his previous position, he came in contact with Sean's hard length, causing them both to moan at the contact. Quickly passing the lube to Sean, Holden used his current position to create friction; Sean's answering groan brought a smile to his face. Grabbing on to his hips to still him, Sean quickly applied the lube to both of them, before gently entering his lover. Moans filled the room as they moved together. Their pace slowly increasing, as their desire and need for each other grew more intense. Feeling his own release building, Sean took Holden's hardened member in his hand and stroked him in time with his thrusting. Before long they were both moaning as they reached their peak together. Sean fiddled with the collar of his shirt, which was maybe the tenth one he has tried on that night. He was nervous and he always changed a million times before deciding what to wear when he was nervous. Holden smiled and walked up behind him, looping his arms around him, placing his head on his shoulder. \"It's going to be ok. Just like before, only now we don't have to hide.\" \"I know, I'm excited about that, but I'm also nervous. I've never done this before, not when people knew anyway. I'm used to being the play boy ladies man. Being honest all this is still new to me.\" \"It's ok babe. I'm nervous to. I just hide it better than you.\" He said with a smirk and a slap on the ass before he grabbed his tie off the bed and went to answer the knock at the door. \"Hurry up. I can stall for so long.\" \"Get it together, for him.\" He mumbled to himself before grabbing the first thing he had pick out, threw it on and was headed down stairs just as James called up the stairs to him. \"So high maintenance for a jock.\" \"We can't all be naturally pretty, like you fine babes.\" He called back as he came jogging down the stairs, all put together, hair still slightly damp from his shower. \"Are we ready then?\" Holden asks winking at Sean. The four hadn't even made it out of the car before they are swarmed by half a dozen people with cameras snapping pictures of the couple stepping out for the first time. While none of them want the attention. Sean simply smiles at them and grabs Holden's hand as the make their way in to the popular dinner spot. \"Well that was fun.\" James says laughs as he pull out a chair for Alex then sat down himself. \"I've never had so much attention at once. How do you deal with it?\" Alex replied sitting across from Sean. The waiter came over and took their drink orders. 3 beers and an glass wine. \"It's never been this bad before; although I've never done anything to attract this much attention.\" Sean said. \"I've tried to keep them out of my personal life. So much for that.\" He said with a shrug. \"You still haven't,\" Holden said putting his hand on Sean's thigh under the table. \"Coming out shouldn't cause this much attention to be drawn to you. You've been gay all along, but they didn't know it. Nothing has changed except now people are aware of it.\" Sean smiled and held Holden hand under the table. As much as he hated all the attention it was drawing, he was glad he came out. Simply because he could now go out to dinner and show off the big hunk of man he had gotten himself. \"Well as much as I agree that orientation isn't worth garnering this much attention from the world, some one of your status admitting that you are gay is going to get attention. Especially when you did it on as grand a scale as you did. Calling a press conference to tell the world was pretty awesome,\" James smiled across the table. \"Well the attention is worth it, if only to let everyone know that Holden is off the market to everyone but me.\" \"Is that what this means?\" Holden asked with a knowing smile on his face. \"That's exactly what it means.\" Sean smiled and leaned over and kissed Holden. Cameras went off all around them. The couple smiled at each other, as Holden blushed hiding his face in Sean's neck. Sean laughed and shrugged it off, determined not to let the attention change how he interacted with his boyfriend. The rest of dinner went smoothly. Both couples sharing the affection they felt for each other through out. It was the most fun Sean had had in a long time. He was finally able to completely be himself, without having to worry about the backlash it would have on his career. Holden had never made his sexuality a secret, but he never really went out enough for people to know. When he did, it was usually with a woman because it was safer. Being out together was something they had been longing to do for a long time, but both were afraid to make the change. At the end of the night, they decided to make their double date a regular occurrence, and went off to their respective partners with no one around to witness their affection. Thanks again for sticking with me. I hope you enjoyed this look into their start and new beginning together. Please review and let me know what you think. ~Bunny[Chapter 3] Hope I did better on the updating this time. lol. Enjoy! Chapter 3. Moving Forward. It had been a couple of months since the couple had made their relationship known to the public. They were both incredibly happy. Holden felt that this was as important to Sean as it was to him. Sean had been offered several deals, none that would keep him in California to play, which is what he was really hoping for, so he took a Deal with the Dallas Cowboys that was a one year with an optional second year. Holden was in a position where he would be able to go and visit a lot but it wouldn't be all the time, and they would still be spending a good deal of time apart. Neither of them was looking forward to the distance that the deal caused for them. They had both gotten used to being able to spend their free time together, falling asleep together, and their weekly dinners with James and Alex. They managed to keep them, despite everyone's busy schedules. During one of their more recent dinners, the couple had mentioned that they had started the process of adopting a little girl named Julie. The future was not a subject Holden wanted bring up, he was so happy that they were together and moving forward, that he had no intention of pushing Sean into something that he wasn't ready for. Sean on the other hand didn't want to bring up the future because he knew his career was going to take him away from Holden for months and he didn't want to expect anything. If he didn't voice what he wanted to Holden, then he wouldn't get hurt if he didn't want to wait for the season to be over. The two had made a trip to Dallas a few weeks earlier and found a condo that was mostly furnished and would be close enough to everything, but far out enough to give him some peace from the city. Unlike their home, the condo had no personal touches. It was stark and bland, white walls, no pictures; nothing to make it feel like home. Sean mentioned this to Holden and how he wanted to bring some of their photos with him. To have a little piece of home in Dallas, for when they can't be together. After going through the house and selecting which pictures and things that he wants to bring with him, Sean was getting frustrated with Holden. It seemed that everything he wanted to bring with him, Holden wanted to keep there. Crossing the room, he picks up the frame that holds prominent place on their living room wall. It was a photo of the couple taken at a charity gala they had attended shortly after Sean came out. The event was their official debut as a couple. They wore matching tuxes that brought out the blue in their eyes; each wore a cream colored rose on their lapel. In the photo, they were wrapped up in a slow dance, lost in their own world. It wasn't until they had been sent a copy of the photo that they even realized one had been taken. \"No. That belongs here.\" Holden said as he looked at which photo Sean was holding \"You can print off another copy of it later\" Sean said moving to go wrap it so that the frame wouldn't get damaged when it was loaded on the truck. \"No, it has to stay here. I'll send you a copy of it to keep there.\" He moved to take it from Sean. \"No. It's coming with me. We've been over this, I want you to come with me but that is not possible. So we agreed that I would take some of our things so I'll have pieces of you with me. Why won't you let me?\" Sean said finally having enough of the back and forth about what he was going to bring with him. He didn't understand why Holden was having such a problem today. \"I know that you want me there, and I'll be there as often as possible. You also have to realize that I have a job here, and responsibilities that I can't just abandon to be with you.\" \"I know that. Do you think I wanna leave? Be away from you for longer than a day? I hate it, but it's my job. I have to do this. One more season and then I'm done. All I need is to prove to myself that I can still do this. Then I'm done, and we can settle down and start a family, we can go anywhere, do anything. I can get a job that will still keep me connected to football, but it won't be everything. Hell even this isn't everything to me anymore. You mean more to me than playing football.\" \"Really? Then why are you leaving? Running away again?\" \"I'm not running! I have to go. I did everything I could to get a closer team. This was the closest team with a half decent offer. There were better deals, some double what I'm getting, but that didn't matter. What mattered and still does is that this was a close as I could get. Hell Dallas is still too far away. If I was running, I wouldn't want to take you with me.\" \"I don't want you to go! We finally have everything going forward. I thought we were on the same page, but now you're off again.\" Hearing this, Sean put the picture down on the couch, and moved closer to Holden. \"We are on the same page. I'm doing this for us. So that I can close this chapter of my life then start the next one with you. I need to get it out of my system before we do anything else. I' know it's selfish to ask you to wait, especially after everything that's happened but I love you and I want to be with you. I want to do this together.\" He explains as best as he can, while taken Holden's hands in his own. \"Together?\" Holden couldn't hide the skepticism in is voice. Sean had never mentioned the future for them, or at all besides playing football again. \"Yeah. When I'm done we can get married, find a different house in a better neighborhood. One with lots of kids, and a huge backyard.\"Sean pulled Holden closer to him, holding him close while maintaining eye contact so he could see just how much he wanted it. \"I want all those things with you. I just have to do this for me first. Then it's all about you and us; our future. I love you and I need you to know I'm doing all of this for us. I know I don't talk about this stuff often. Just know that I want it all, but only if it's with you.\" \"I feel the same way. I was so sure you were choosing your career over me again.\" \"No, I will never make that mistake again. Losing you was the worst thing that has ever happened to me. I will do anything to avoid feeling that lost and broken ever again.\" The smile on Holden's face was breath taking. \"You have to know that. I love you Holden.\" \"I love you to. I'm sorry I freaked.\" Holden spoke pulling Sean in for an sweet kiss. \"it's ok. It's actually nice to know I'm not the only one who is unsure and going crazy over this. You've been so calm and ok with everything, I was worried you wouldn't wait for me.\" \"Of course I'll wait. I've waited this long haven't I?\" he laughed pulling him back in, only this time it was so innocent. Holden wanted to show him just how much he really cared, and how much hope he had for their future together. Sean gladly returned the love and passion. The kiss grew more heated. Soon the two were on the couch, clothing flying in all directions, until a crash and the sound of glass breaking broke them apart. \"Shit!\" Holden jumped up trying in vain to reverse the damage to their favorite picture. \"Ow\" having cut himself on the broken glass; he gave up, not wanting to get blood on the picture. Stilling Holden's bloody hand, he pulled him up and towards the bathroom. \"We can replace the picture, but I can't replace you. Let's clean this up.\" The couple exchanged a heated moment in exchange for expressing something more important to them; their love for each other. Thank you for reading. Please review.

It had been a couple of months since the couple had made their relationship known to the public. They were both incredibly happy. Holden felt that this was as important to Sean as it was to him. Sean had been offered several deals, none that would keep him in California to play, which is what he was really hoping for, so he took a Deal with the Dallas Cowboys that was a one year with an optional second year. Holden was in a position where he would be able to go and visit a lot but it wouldn't be all the time, and they would still be spending a good deal of time apart. Neither of them was looking forward to the distance that the deal caused for them. They had both gotten used to being able to spend their free time together, falling asleep together, and their weekly dinners with James and Alex. They managed to keep them, despite everyone's busy schedules. During one of their more recent dinners, the couple had mentioned that they had started the process of adopting a little girl named Julie. The future was not a subject Holden wanted bring up, he was so happy that they were together and moving forward, that he had no intention of pushing Sean into something that he wasn't ready for. Sean on the other hand didn't want to bring up the future because he knew his career was going to take him away from Holden for months and he didn't want to expect anything. If he didn't voice what he wanted to Holden, then he wouldn't get hurt if he didn't want to wait for the season to be over. The two had made a trip to Dallas a few weeks earlier and found a condo that was mostly furnished and would be close enough to everything, but far out enough to give him some peace from the city. Unlike their home, the condo had no personal touches. It was stark and bland, white walls, no pictures; nothing to make it feel like home. Sean mentioned this to Holden and how he wanted to bring some of their photos with him. To have a little piece of home in Dallas, for when they can't be together. After going through the house and selecting which pictures and things that he wants to bring with him, Sean was getting frustrated with Holden. It seemed that everything he wanted to bring with him, Holden wanted to keep there. Crossing the room, he picks up the frame that holds prominent place on their living room wall. It was a photo of the couple taken at a charity gala they had attended shortly after Sean came out. The event was their official debut as a couple. They wore matching tuxes that brought out the blue in their eyes; each wore a cream colored rose on their lapel. In the photo, they were wrapped up in a slow dance, lost in their own world. It wasn't until they had been sent a copy of the photo that they even realized one had been taken. \"No. That belongs here.\" Holden said as he looked at which photo Sean was holding \"You can print off another copy of it later\" Sean said moving to go wrap it so that the frame wouldn't get damaged when it was loaded on the truck. \"No, it has to stay here. I'll send you a copy of it to keep there.\" He moved to take it from Sean. \"No. It's coming with me. We've been over this, I want you to come with me but that is not possible. So we agreed that I would take some of our things so I'll have pieces of you with me. Why won't you let me?\" Sean said finally having enough of the back and forth about what he was going to bring with him. He didn't understand why Holden was having such a problem today. \"I know that you want me there, and I'll be there as often as possible. You also have to realize that I have a job here, and responsibilities that I can't just abandon to be with you.\" \"I know that. Do you think I wanna leave? Be away from you for longer than a day? I hate it, but it's my job. I have to do this. One more season and then I'm done. All I need is to prove to myself that I can still do this. Then I'm done, and we can settle down and start a family, we can go anywhere, do anything. I can get a job that will still keep me connected to football, but it won't be everything. Hell even this isn't everything to me anymore. You mean more to me than playing football.\" \"Really? Then why are you leaving? Running away again?\" \"I'm not running! I have to go. I did everything I could to get a closer team. This was the closest team with a half decent offer. There were better deals, some double what I'm getting, but that didn't matter. What mattered and still does is that this was a close as I could get. Hell Dallas is still too far away. If I was running, I wouldn't want to take you with me.\" \"I don't want you to go! We finally have everything going forward. I thought we were on the same page, but now you're off again.\" Hearing this, Sean put the picture down on the couch, and moved closer to Holden. \"We are on the same page. I'm doing this for us. So that I can close this chapter of my life then start the next one with you. I need to get it out of my system before we do anything else. I' know it's selfish to ask you to wait, especially after everything that's happened but I love you and I want to be with you. I want to do this together.\" He explains as best as he can, while taken Holden's hands in his own. \"Together?\" Holden couldn't hide the skepticism in is voice. Sean had never mentioned the future for them, or at all besides playing football again. \"Yeah. When I'm done we can get married, find a different house in a better neighborhood. One with lots of kids, and a huge backyard.\"Sean pulled Holden closer to him, holding him close while maintaining eye contact so he could see just how much he wanted it. \"I want all those things with you. I just have to do this for me first. Then it's all about you and us; our future. I love you and I need you to know I'm doing all of this for us. I know I don't talk about this stuff often. Just know that I want it all, but only if it's with you.\" \"I feel the same way. I was so sure you were choosing your career over me again.\" \"No, I will never make that mistake again. Losing you was the worst thing that has ever happened to me. I will do anything to avoid feeling that lost and broken ever again.\" The smile on Holden's face was breath taking. \"You have to know that. I love you Holden.\" \"I love you to.

Thought he knew who he was and what he wanted, but that was before Sean came along. Chapter 1: Clean Slate Christmas Eve, 2006 Los Angeles, CA It was Christmas Eve and Holden Wilson was still sitting at his desk typing away at his computer. He wasn't doing anything really. The reports he stared at now had been completed hours ago. Now (as he told himself) he was proof-reading, but in reality he just didn't want to go downstairs. He was avoiding the office party going on downstairs, everyone was there. He knew he was being childish and he should have just gone straight home. He didn't actually know what he was waiting for, but he waited and waited until … \"Holden! When are you going to get out of this office?\" His friend Dave had entered unannounced. He held a drink in one hand and he was smiling with a wide, lopsided grin. He was drunk, or at least very tipsy. Holden shut down his computer. \"Just finished working,\" He lied, \"I think I might go home now.\" Dave looked at Holden and gave an exasperated sigh before saying, \"You've been working non-stop for over a month. It's Christmas Eve! Come downstairs and have some fun.\" \"I'm not feeling well,\" Holden said shaking his head and gathering up his things. Dave rolled his eyes. \"You have got to let it go. Come on, let's have some fun.\" Holden had let \"it\" go. \"It\" being his most recent break-up with his boyfriend of about seven months. It had happened just after Thanksgiving. His boyfriend of seven months said that he found someone else. Holden tried not to show it, but the breakup had torn him apart. It had come completely out of left field and it stung that he hadn't seen it coming at all. His ex-boyfriend had moved on and Holden had accepted that, but he just felt sad. Or as if someone had pulled the carpet out from under his feet and no one was there to help pick him up. Slowly, but surely, he was pulling himself off the floor. Slowly but surely. Holden yawned. \"Another time,\" he said standing up and crossing the room to get his jacket off of his coat rack. He said to Dave, who was leaning on the doorframe looking at Holden all the while. \"I'm going to see my family early tomorrow, but next time, okay?\" Dave looked at him a bit concerned but nodded all the same. Holden just left. ::: New Years Eve, 2006 Holden was drunk, he decided. It was New Years Eve and he had nothing else to do, no one to see so he was at home alone with a case of expensive beer (it was New Years, he splurged) and his television was tuned in to watch the ball drop in Times Square. Except that it was only after 10 PM. That was the sad part. Only just after ten o'clock and his inhibitions were already slipping. May not be such a bad thing though. He wanted to forget the last few weeks. The phone rang. It was Dave. \"Holden! Come on! You're coming out tonight.\" He said. \"What?\" \"I'm not waiting for an answer. Are you dressed? Come outside, I'm in my car. There's a big party tonight at a friend of mine's house down by the beach. We're going. You are not staying home alone tonight.\" \"But I—\" But Dave wouldn't let Holden finish his protests. \"No! Come outside!\" Dave hung up the phone. Holden stared at it for a few seconds. He was still dressed sure in black slacks and a black shirt. Wait, he wasn't actually considering this was he? He had to admit though, he didn't want to be home alone, drunk in a quiet house counting down the last few seconds to midnight silently to himself. He could see that image of himself in a picture in his head and he didn't like it. Going out was a good idea, he thought in his drunken state. He downed the last of his beer in one gulp, stood up (too quickly, he staggered a bit as he went to put on his shoes) and went outside to join Dave in his car. \"What kind of party is this?\" Holden asked as they were on their way. \"Wild!\" Dave yelled in excitement He laughed. Holden wondered if Dave were drunk as well. Holden rubbed his eyes feeling tired already. \"I never do this,\" He groaned in a lapse back to reality. Sober, Holden would have put Dave down with some sort of lie, but intoxicated that wasn't likely. There was no turning back now. \"I know you don't man! That's the point!\" Holden looked at Dave questioningly. \"You're such a nice guy,\" Dave went on, \"Such a nice guy! You deserve to get over that jerk. Tonight you're going to go out and do something that will make you forget about him … something … naughty , just do whatever! And tomorrow, when it's 2007, you'll have a clean slate.\" Tipsy Holden smiled. Tipsy Holden liked this idea a lot. Logical, inhibited Holden had been withholding fun from him for a month. That Holden had thrown himself into his career trying desperately to forget the pain and humiliation of his breakup with … what was his name again? Tipsy Holden didn't remember, nor did he care. Things were looking up. When they go to the party, it was loud from the music and people yelling and wooing. Dave and Holden walked around the house surveying the party at first. Dave was trying to find the host and Holden was just tagging along observing all the people. Some people were talking on couches in the living room and a lot more people were dancing or making out in other rooms. Down below by the beach a number of people were diving with bottles of beer in hand into a pool. Dave gave up searching for his friend after a while and he and Holden went into the kitchen to find the alcohol. They were successful and beer in hand they made to leave the kitchen just as a bunch of girls came in. \"Dave!\" Called out one, she grabbed Dave by the shoulders and smiled up at him. She was very pretty with long light brown hair, petite build, tanned skin and outsized breasts. \"Hey!\" He said a little too enthusiastically. The two of them left together talking and laughing about something. This left Holden by himself. A few of the other girls were eying him like little kids would eye a piece of candy. Holden sighed and walked out of the kitchen. The girls didn't follow him. Good. He chuckled to himself and shook his head at how easily he had been abandoned. He decided to leave the house because the noise was so loud. He found a bit of peace on a balcony overlooking the pool. No one was out here (although he did find a bra, matching set of panties and two pairs of boxer shorts). He closed the sliding door behind him muffling the sound coming from inside. People were a bit quieter outside as they were all too busy making out in the pool to make much noise. \"Oh wow,\" He said catching a few party-goers stripping in the pool. He averted his gaze outward and looked at the sea. So vast, so dark, so pretty. \"Hi,\" came a stranger's voice from behind him. It was deep and rough. A man's voice. The owner of the voice came and leaned over the balcony looking out at the sea with Holden. Holden could smell the alcohol on him. \"Hi,\" Holden said politely not looking over at the newcomer. \"What's your name?\" The man asked slurring his words, but only a little bit. \"Holden,\" Holden said still not looking at the other man. The man started to chuckle. It was a deep, throaty sound. \"Where did you pick that out?\" He asked still chuckling. \"I didn't,\" Holden said coldly. The man took a sip of something and then said, \"Fair enough,\" Holden was annoyed now. He turned to look at the guy, to tell him off, but that was a mistake. The man was hot. He was as tall as Holden, but with more muscle. This man was rough. Raw even, he was raw man. He was the type of guy that's got to be a sports player or if not that then he must be a construction worker. Holden was immediately attracted, but that could also be drunk Holden talking. \"Who are you?\" Holden asked abruptly. The man looked at him as if he were surprised. That was weird. Should Holden know this man? \"Uh, Sean,\" The man looked at him puzzled. \"You don't know who I am?\" \"No,\" Holden said taken aback, \"Have we met before?\" \"Uh, no,\" The man, Sean, said shaking his head, \"I don't think so.\" He smiled. \"Oh,\" Holden said. Even when he was drunk he never forgot a face. He turned back to look out at the ocean drinking more of his beer. The man suddenly moved closer to Holden resting his arm on the balcony looking at Holden. Holden turned. He said, \"Do you want something?\" Logical Holden figuratively kicked Tipsy Holden. He knew what the answer would be. \"Yeah, you,\" Sean said touching Holden's arm gazing into his eyes. \"If you want it.\" Holden tried to step back, but Sean's fingers closed around his arm and pulled him in kissing him. After a few seconds, Holden pushed him off. \"You do know I'm a guy right?\" He had to ask. The smell of alcohol on this guy was strong. \"Yeah, you're a man ,\" Sean said closing the distance between them and resting his hands on Holden's hips. \"A sexy man with great hips.\" Sean kissed Holden again pressing his lips harder expressing his need, his hunger for Holden. After what seemed like too soon, Sean pulled away from Holden and whispered in his ear, \"I live right next door. Do you want to get a little privacy?\" Oh, oh no. Holden Wilson, international businessman did not do this. However, drunk Holden Wilson on vacation might consent to this. This guy was hot and he wanted Holden. How he could tell that Holden was gay, he didn't care. Holden felt a hunger and a longing welling up inside of his that he hadn't felt even when he was dating his previous boyfriend … what was his name again? Holden finally nodded. Sean kissed him again. It was a hot searing kiss that Holden returned with fervor. After a little while, Sean grunted in frustration, tearing his lips away from Holden's. He grabbed Holden's hand and led him back into the house, through the crowd and out the door. ::: When Sean got Holden inside his place, he immediately began to kiss him again. He wrapped his hands around Holden's slender hips and pulled him close. He was feeling particularly passionate with this man. Sean hadn't been able to be this close with a man in so long. When he saw Holden at his neighbor's party on the patio, he had to have him. Except of course if he wasn't gay, but he was Sean though happily. He'd lucked out twice in a row too because Holden didn't have a clue as to who he really was. Sean Jackson was a pro football player and a popular one too. People said if he kept playing he would soon end up in the hall of fame. Not to sound too cocky, but he was a big deal. As a pro football player he was not supposed to be gay, and yet he was. He spent a great deal of the past couple of seasons unleashing his pent up sexual energy on the field and it had paid off for him, but tonight was different. This man, Holden, was hot. Sean had just realized just how good it felt to wrap this man up in his arms and to think that he wasn't going to go to that party. The girls that lived next door were always trying to get Sean to come over for obvious reasons. Tonight he decided to play along and went to their party. It was New Years Eve and they had alcohol in abundance. He shouldn't be drinking because he was still in season, but he would live. Then he saw Holden and he was gay and also very submissive to Sean's advances. Even though he pretended not to be earlier, Holden was positively melting in Sean's arms. Sean wanted to savor this and at the same time take all of Holden all at once. They were kissing in Sean's foyer still. Sean applied more pressure to Holden's lips. He could feel the other man's lips grow hot as they swelled against his own. He tightened his grip on Holden's hips making his way down to cup Holden's ass. Holden moaned, a sweet musical sound emitting from his lips. Grunting, Sean backed away slowly and hesitantly, but he knew if he didn't stop now he would end up taking this man here on the floor. His body was screaming at him to go horizontal, but he wouldn't do it here. \"Let's go to my room,\" He said in a horse whisper. Holden, still dazed by the feelings of pleasure coursing through his body only managed to nod. He hadn't been touched, no wanted … no, needed like this ever, he felt. Even went he was with his ex he hadn't felt needed like this. He could feel a hunger and a longing in Sean as he clutched at him and kissed him. Heat rose from his body as if her were on fire. On fire for him. Sean grabbed Holden's hand again and led him through the house, quickly up a set of stairs and through a door. Slamming the door shut, Sean went at Holden desperately fumbling with the buttons on Holden's shirt and when he was finally done with the thing he thrust it off of Holden and threw it unceremoniously into a corner of his bedroom. At the same time Holden was working on Sean's shirt which he began to lift up as Sean lifted up Holden's under shirt and breaking apart from their kiss finally allowing themselves to be free of the constraints of clothing. When they were both shirtless, Sean pushed Holden back to his bed and fell on top of him kissing him and undoing the belt on Holden's slacks. He undid it and pulled down Holden's pants, underwear and even managed to pull off his socks. He broke the kiss as he did this and Holden moaned repeatedly and soon his straining member was free from his pants. Sean stood up and removed his own pants and soon they were both naked. Sean put his hands on either side of Holden's head and smiled down at him before he moved to kiss his lips, then his neck, then his collar bone with he spent a bit of time nibbling on which made Holden moan more. Holden placed one of his hands on the back of Sean's head and rested the other on his back pulling him closer. Sean moved now licking down the center line of Holden's chest before settling in and kissing Holden's right nipple while he teased the left one with his fingers. Holden gasped; another sweet sound to Sean. He bit down lightly on Holden's nipple and Holden gasped again. Holden was rock hard and so was Sean. He moved back to Holden's lips and this time putting his body directly on top of Holden. As he was kissing him, he moved his hips rubbing their lengths together. Holden shivered underneath him despite the high temperature emitting from his body. After a short time of this in which Sean thought he might explode he moved away from Holden again and opened his bedside drawer. He reached in the drawer and fished out lubricant and a condom. Applying the lube to his fingers he slid one inside of Holden. Holden gasped again and started panting very heavily. Sean decided as he worked to stretch Holden out to kiss his neck and lick along his jaw line. Two fingers in now. Holden panted even more heavily. By the time Sean reached three fingers Holden was moaning and panting so much that Sean knew the other man had just about reached his limit. He tore open the packaging on the condom and slipped it on. He kissed Holden on the mouth once more. Holden whimpered as if begging Sean for more. Sean obliged much to Holden's delight. Sean plunged deep inside of him rocking his hips back and forth gently and then adding speed as time went on. Holden could feel that he was reaching his climax quickly, but he really wanted to take all of Sean in. He hadn't felt this passionate in ages. It felt so good. So good … The way Sean was just plunging into him … and God, he was so hot. The contours of his body were well defined in hard muscle. He was a little beefy, but Holden liked it. Just look at the way the beads of sweat trickled down Sean's abs. Sean exuded all that a real man should be; he was so firm, but so tender with Holden as he made love to him. \"Oh!\" A little cry passed Holden's lips. He couldn't hold it in anymore. He was reaching his breaking point. Sean cried out too and then exploded as Holden also reached his climax and spewed all over his and Sean's stomachs. Eyes rolling into the back of his head Holden really didn't want to let go of this night. Not ever. To be continued …[Chapter 2] Title: Jump In Author: jillrocca Fandom: Valentine's Day, 2010 Pairings: Sean/Holden Summary: As an international businessman, Holden had been everywhere and seen everything and thought he knew it all. Thought he knew who he was and what he wanted, but that was before Sean came along. A/N: Sorry if there are mistakes, I self-beta. Chapter 2: Afterwards Sean Jackson's Apartment, Beachfront Los Angeles, CA Holden stirred. He woke up feeling hazy and with his head pounding. Sunlight was pouring in from the windows. He hated that, he always woke up at the first sign of sunlight on his eyes. He always drew the curtains before he went to bed, why was this any different? Laziness and the pain in his head got the best of him though so he decided just to turn over and try to ignore the bright light. Holden's heart skipped a beat when he turned to face the other direction. Since when had there been a man in his bed and who the hell was this? In a flash the memory of last night came back into his mind: the drunkenness, the awkwardness and the passion. Such an intense passion like had never felt before and had always dreamed of. However, it wasn't like he was really planning on seeing this man again. Like Dave said, once the magic of New Years Eve was over, he would have a clean slate. He felt good. As he stared at Sean's face deciding that it would probably be best to leave before Sean woke up, Sean woke up, or at least he seemed to. He groaned and opened his eyes halfway. Then, surprisingly he shifted and wrapped his arm around Holden and pulled him closer then shifted again and fell back into sleep. Holden was trapped, but oddly enough, being in Sean's arms made him feel at ease. Even the pounding in his head from all the alcohol seemed to ebb away slightly. Holden was damn tired. He managed to glance at a clock on Sean's nightstand and saw that it was just before eight in the morning. He sighed and found himself concentration on Sean's slow even breathing before he fell back asleep. ::: The next time Holden woke up, Sean woke up too with a start. Holden jumped in his arms (or the best jumping he could do while lying down) and looked at Sean with wide eyes. It was in that moment that Sean realized his arms were wrapped around Holden and their faces were only inches apart. Sean released Holden and sat up swinging his legs over his bed. He had an overwhelming urge to kiss Holden. That would be bad. Not to mention completely awkward. What would they do after that? It was sort of comforting, though, that they would probably never see each other ever again. The departure had been extra awkward. The moment after they woke up was followed by silence and the Holden's hasty excuses of needing to be somewhere. Sean showed him the door and that was it. ::: Holden, I just scored a couple of football tickets for tomorrow. You want in? By the way, where did you go last night? I couldn't reach you on your cell phone … did you have fun? Dave After Holden had managed to find his way home earlier, he didn't want to do anything for the rest of the day and maybe not the rest of the month. The problem now was that he was bored … so he decided to check his e-mail. Dave now wanted to drag him to a football game. When the hell did he ever watch football? He wasn't sure what Dave was trying to get at as far as appealing to Holden's personal interests, but Holden had a sneaking suspicion Dave just wanted to get him out of his house. Holden had holed himself up in his office or his house for over a month avoiding the outside world, trying to tackle his emotions by himself. He knew Dave was just trying to assert that he was there for Holden. And well, it had led to the best sex of his life. He'd probably never see Sean again, but that was okay. All right, he would go with Dave tomorrow. ::: January 2nd was a game day for Sean. He had been worried that he would feel sluggish because on the day before he was so hungover. He drunk a lot less than other people, but he still drank enough to feel bad the next morning. Although he hadn't drunk enough to not remember the night before and that was a good thing. His headache was gone and he still felt good from that night with Holden, the mystery party guest. It had been one of the best nights he had in a long time and although he would probably never see the other man again, he was still feeling good from the experience. Albeit, not good from the experience at the same time. He was frustrated with himself that he hadn't asked Holden for a way of contacting him. Oh well, he thought. Just need to take it out on the field. And that he did, or at least so he wanted to. Usually what would happen was from all the grunting, tackling and running around he would break down his frustrations and when he got home he was usually too tired to think about anything else except sleep. He would have to wake up the next day alone in his bed where the feeling would start up again. From the moment the whistle blew, Sean concentrated on the game, but his mind kept wandering back to Holden. This was bad, very, very bad. He woke up yesterday holding someone in his arms, something he had been missing for the longest time. He woke up feeling empty. He had only shared one night with the man, but already he was feeling attached. He had never found someone who didn't recognize him automatically and his fear of someone outing him to the public kept him from putting himself out there. There Holden was sexy and completely unaware of whom he was and Sean had let him go. Angry with himself he tackled two guys as he ran to towards the end zone. ::: The game was … okay. Holden wasn't really a sports guy, well, he liked to play and watch tennis, but football was new for him. To be honest, he didn't understand the appeal of two guys slamming into one another with no sex involved. He was sitting on the end of the row next to Dave and his new … girl, the same woman who dragged him out of the kitchen the other night. Dave had his arm wrapped around her and from time to time they would make out or cheer so enthusiastically their cheap beer would spill on Holden's pants (twice that happened). Holden couldn't have been happier when the game ended. Los Angeles won. Holden had to admit though that he was impressed by the quarterback. He ran so fast and took down anyone that stood in his way. Once he though he saw one player from the opposite team go up in the air when the quarterback passed him. \"Woo!\" The woman latched under Dave's arm, Cara, exclaimed when the game ended. Holden reached up to check that his ears weren't bleeding. When they reached the bottom of the stadium, Dave ran up to Holden, who had been walking ahead of him and Cara who in turn had been walking and kissing and hanging off of each other. Dave grabbed Holden's shoulder and said, \"Hey, guess what?\" \"What?\" Holden said hoping that Dave didn't have another destination he wanted to whisk Holden off to. Well, he could avoid it whatever it was because this time he took his own car. He appreciated that Dave wanted to get him out to do more things, but he was going about it in the wrong way. Dave said, \"The quarterback … guess what? He's Cara's neighbor! She's going to see if we can get his autograph!\" \"Oh, wow. Great!\" Holden said. Drunk, Dave missed the sarcasm. Dave was clearly the more excited one here. The quarterback had impressed him as it was Holden's first serious look at football (and it was either he watched the game or he watched Dave and Cara make out), but he could live without the man's autograph. Dave didn't wait for an answer, however. Instead he pulled Holden by the arm as Cara led them through the hall. The players were exiting the field through a large entry way down a ramp that led up to the field. Holden, Dave and Cara were all standing in a little door that led out to the main entrance hall to the stadium seats that was right before the locker room. A few of the football players looked over at them confused; no doubt they weren't supposed to be right there. Then Cara called out, looking at the last guy, \"Sean! Sean!\" The guy slowed down and turned to face them. He seemed to freeze. \"Sean! Great game today!\" Cara said happily. The guy looked down at her and nodded. \"Thanks,\" He said. This was so embarrassing. Holden should have made some excuse … but Dave's grip was really tight. Dave had let go by now, but it was too late. He was trapped between two drunk people and an extremely awkward situation. \"Hey! Take off your helmet silly. I bet it's gross!\" Cara exclaimed reaching for the helmet. Sean tried to block her, but she managed to avoid him and whipped it off. She looked into it and said, \"Ew, it is gross.\" Holden felt all the blood drain out of his face. Sean Jackson, professional football player, was the same Sean he had slept with only the day before. This couldn't get any worse. Or was it even a bad thing? He had had really good sex with this man and now he saw him again … but it wasn't exactly keeping within the spirit of a clean slate. Damn, this was what he got for having a one night stand. \"Can the boys have your autograph?\" Cara slurred. Sean nodded. \"Sure,\" he said quietly. Dave hurriedly handed Sean his baseball cap and a pen he had in his pocket. When he was finished Dave snatched the cap from him as Cara handed Sean back his helmet. The two of them took off, leaving Holden alone for a second time. Cara was wooing and so was Dave for that matter and both of them were also winding their way back through the entryway they came through and out of sight. What the hell? Holden, who had been staring at the pair of them in shock was rooted to the ground. He turned back towards Sean as he remembered he could leave too, but Sean was staring at him with a strange look on his face. Holden didn't know what it was about, but it looked as if he were searching for something. \"Hi,\" Holden said. \"Hello,\" Sean said. \"Um, I'm sorry,\" Holden said hurriedly, feeling more awkward by the second, \"They're really, really drunk.\" \"Uh, yeah, I can tell.\" Sean smiled a little and dipped his head down trying to hide his chuckling. He had wanted to see Holden again, but this was strange. In the next instant something beeped. Holden started fumbling in his pants pockets, his phone had gone off. When he found his phone—Sean had taken to staring at him the whole time—it was Dave texting him \"WHERE ARE YOU?\" Holden snorted. The irony. Sean looked at him questioningly. Holden looked up at him, the smile vanished from his face. \"I, um, have to go.\" And he left trying not to look as if he were in a hurry and shoving his cell phone in his pocket. Or so he thought. As Sean stared after him, he noticed that Holden had missed his pocket completely. The phone fell to the floor, but Holden took no notice of it. Sean thought that he should call out to him. He ought to. It was never fun losing anything. No, it really wasn't so he should say something. Really, he should. He should. But he wouldn't say anything. And why? Because this gave him an excuse to see Holden again. To be continued! Thank you for all your reviews![Chapter 3] Title: Jump In Author: jillrocca Fandom: Valentine's Day, 2010 Pairings: Sean/Holden Summary: As an international businessman, Holden had been everywhere and seen everything and thought he knew it all. Thought he knew who he was and what he wanted, but that was before Sean came along. A/N: Sorry if there are mistakes, I self-beta. Sorry this took so long. Chapter 3: Dessert Holden's office, Tuesday Morning Downtown Los Angeles, CA Shit, shit, shit. Was all Holden could think as he tore apart his office looking for his cell phone. He could have swore he had it yesterday, but after he almost leveled the house looking for it, he couldn't find it. He looked all over his office for the thing, but nothing. He hadn't been to the office yesterday and he distinctly remembered having it in his hands yesterday evening after the football game. The football game … oh shit. It took only an instant for the crushing realization to sink in. He fell back on his chair holding his hand over his eyes. He had lost it at the stadium. Shit. He had important clients' names and contact information in that thing. He was fucked. After a moment he sighed and remembered that he and his secretary had a file with all the clients names and contact information on their computers, but still. He had all of his personal contacts on that phone as well. He was going to have to call to have the number cancelled so that no one bought an obscene amount of games on his phone and … The phone on his desk rang. His secretary wasn't in yet so he answered it. \"Holden Wilson.\" \"Holden? Hi, it's Sean.\" Came a deep voice on the other end. In his surprise Holden just held the phone to his ear saying nothing. How did he get this number? \"Holden?\" Sean said after another moment. \"Uh, uh, yeah. Hello,\" \"Hi,\" Sean said again, \"I tried calling your house, but you weren't there. You dropped your Blackberry in front of the locker room the other day,\" \"Oh! Oh, so, so, you have it. That's great! I've been looking for that thing everywhere.\" \"Right! So, I guess you want it back. Are you free later?\" What? \"Yes, yes I am.\" He kind of needed his phone back now, why couldn't Sean just come by his office and drop it off now? He could give him the address. \"Wait, why can't you just bring it over now? I can give you directions to my office.\" Sean hesitated, \"I would but I'm at practice right now.\" He said. \"Look, meet me at The Palm Tree restaurant downtown about seven and I'll give you back your phone then.\" \"Oh, uh—\" \"Until then,\" And Sean hung up. Holden stared at the phone for a moment afterwards wondering if he should feel relieved that Sean had his phone, or worried. It felt like he was forced to go out on a date with this man. A date? No, he was just going there to get his phone back. So Sean had said meet at a restaurant around dinner time. That didn't mean that they had to go inside the restaurant. No. It didn't. ::: Sean could have given Holden his cell phone during the day, there was no way he had a practice right after a game and it was the last game of the season before the playoffs. He had a couple of days off, but then it was back to practice. He did work out today though right after he talked to Holden so he wasn't completely lying. He had really wanted to see Holden again to figure out his feelings. Seeing him after the game was really shocking. He tried not to let it show at the time, but the odds of them meeting again had been very slim. He got to the restaurant early. He adjusted his suit tie feeling nervous. This was his first date … night out with someone in a long time. He didn't usually have time for these things with his schedule and it was pretty difficult to find someone with what little time he had to go out (outside of team functions that was, and how the hell would he ever meet another gay man at his team parties? Gay men didn't usually watch football, but Holden was at his game, which had terrified him at first, but then it gave him a little hope. But, now hold on, that didn't make any sense. If Holden watched football, then he might have an idea as to who Sean was. He didn't mean to brag, but he wouldn't deny that had done a lot for the NFL and he was famous. Had Holden feigned indifference on the night that they met? They were both pretty drunk, it was true but … damn, now he was so confused. He looked up after realizing, embarrassingly, that he had been staring off into space at his plate. When he looked up he saw Holden speaking with the hostess at the front of the restaurant looking a little perplexed. Sean straightened up in his chair and smiled when Holden noticed him sitting at his table. Holden pointed to Sean and the hostess seated him with Sean. \"Hi,\" Holden said smiling politely once he had sat down. \"Hello, and here …\" Sean said reaching into the inside breast pocket of his suit jacket, \"Is your cell phone,\" he pulled out the phone and handed it to Holden. As Holden reached out to grab his phone, smiling. \"Thank you so much. I can't even imagine what my superiors would do if I lost this.\" \"Where do you work?\" Sean asked. \"Huh?\" Holden had been staring at his phone, \"Oh! Um, I work for the Kristof & Weston group.\" He said. Sean was taken aback. Kristof & Weston was one of the top companies in Los Angeles. \"I'm impressed,\" he said. \"What do you do there?\" Holden seemed like he didn't want to say. He laughed in that way people do when they are embarrassed and can't think of anything to say. However, he said, \"I'm a partner and I oversee all of the corporate development and forge relations with our international clients.\" \"Wow, so you must do a lot of traveling.\" Sean said staring intently at Holden. \"Yeah, I do.\" Holden said with a smile. At least this wasn't too awkward. Well, Holden didn't like to talk about his job with strangers, but then again he and Sean did have sex and met by chance again and now they were having dinner together. Did they qualify as strangers anymore? \"But you, you're a football player! That has to be exciting.\" Holden added. \"Yeah, it is,\" Sean said nodding and then he looked directly at Holden and said, \"I love it.\" Holden looked directly into Sean's eyes. They were brown, but right now Holden could have sworn they looked dark and smoky. As they continued to talk about Sean's life as a football player Holden couldn't think of anything else. He had meant to just get his phone and leave, but here he was staring into Sean's eyes as if this encounter could mean something. ::: Sometime later, Holden wasn't supposed to be here. Here meant at a bar downtown with Sean Jackson. They had finished their dinner, Holden didn't know how long ago and Sean had talked him into coming to this bar that Sean described as, \"Great because no one there cares who I am.\" He and Sean were sitting at a bar knocking back a couple of beers. Holden could usually hold his liquor, but he had had two glasses of wine with dinner and was moving onto his fourth beer. This couldn't be healthy as it was only Monday, but then again, it was only Monday. \"Here, try this shot!\" Sean yelled at him. The music in this place was so loud. Sean handed Holden a shot and clinked their glasses together in a toast. He threw back his head and drank it in one gulp. Holden hesitated, but threw back his head figuring what the hell? He was starting to feel really good. This night had turned out to be a lot more fun than he had expected. He never usually did this sort of thing, he wasn't sure what it was about Sean that brought out this side of him. He was keeping true to his personality, but feeling like he was having more fun. He had felt like shit after his last boyfriend had left him, but now he was feeling damn good. Was it the sex? But then again, he hadn't pushed away Sean when he advanced on him before the sex. This was different. He was drawn to Sean. He didn't want this night to end. A few more shots later that burned in Holden's throat, he was feeling a lot more … loose. Like he could do anything or say anything. \"I want to have sex with you again!\" Holden yelled at Sean, music still too loud to hear properly over. \"What?\" Sean said looking a little delirious and he had a goofy grin plastered on his face. He was a happy drunk. \"I said that I want to sleep with you again!\" That seemed to sober Sean up. He looked at Holden very seriously and said, \"Really?\" \"Yeah! I really liked it last time. Let's have sex again!\" Holden took another shot and downed it. When he looked back at Sean, he was nodding vigorously. Sean leaned over and put his mouth close to Holden's ear. \"I'd like that,\" He said, his voice low and husky. Drunk, Holden was turned on instantly. \"Then why are we still here?\" :: They had taken Sean's car to the bar since Holden had come in a company car from work and he had let the driver go home after dinner. But now that they were wasted they were taking a cab. At least they could still remember to do that much. Unfortunately for them, the cab driver recognized Sean and began to chat him up about football and while Sean happily answered all of his questions, he felt like an overeager lion trying to escape from his cage. He and Holden sat apart and Sean was getting a little more than antsy. He wanted to touch Holden, to kiss him and just go crazy. Finally after about twenty minutes they reached Holden's house. Holden hurriedly fumbled with his keys until he found the right one and pushed it through the lock. Sean stood mere centimeters away from him the entire time he was trying to open the door. Holden's body heat rose as he felt Sean's presence so close behind him. Sean started kissing his shoulder softly, which caused Holden's hands to slip from the key. He finally removed his key from the lock and opened the door. Once inside, Sean pulled Holden close and began kissing him feverishly. They stayed like that for a few minutes before Holden pushed Sean closer to the stairs. Once they reached the top and found their way into the bedroom—Holden steering Sean, who was walking backwards—Holden pushed Sean onto his bed. Straddling the other man with his knees, Holden tore off his suit jacket while Sean worked on the buttons and tie. Once those were off, Holden cupped Sean's face in his hands and began kissing him deeply using his tongue to taste every corner of Sean's mouth. Sean's hands found their way to Holden's ass and his gripped it firmly pulling the other man closer to his bulging erection. Holden moaned as Sean released his grip and started working on undoing Holden's belt. As he was kissing him, Holden fought with the buttons of Sean's shirt and pulled it off and threw it unceremoniously onto the floor. After removing Holden's belt, Sean wrapped Holden in his arms and threw his down onto the bed. He quickly removed his and Holden's shoes as well as both of their pants and soon they were both naked on top of Holden's bed. Sean began kissing Holden's neck, causing the thinner man to moan. Sean smiled and began kissing other parts of his body. Beginning with the collar bone, over to his arms, licking along the inside of his elbow and then to his abdomen. He kissed there for longer eliciting more moans from Holden, which drove Sean wild. He couldn't take it anymore. He always kept lubricant in his bedside table drawers. Who said Holden didn't do the same? He rifled through both of them until he found it in the left side table. He pushed one slick finger into Holden which made Holden gasp at the suddenness of the pain. Sean continued to kiss him on the lips, quieting him. Holden moaned loudly when Sean pushed a second finger in and even louder (if it were possible) when he managed to slip a third in. Sean was so hard he was fit to burst just listening to Holden moan. \"I love how submissive you are,\" Sean breathed into Holden's ear. Holden whimpered a little before Sean grunted and pushed his length into Holden. He thrust until his whole form slid in. Holden yelled in pain. \"Relax,\" Sean whispered again, kissing Holden on the mouth several times before finding a certain rhythm in which their joined bodies both experienced the pleasure of the act. It was rough an fast, Sean felt his body pick up speed each time Holden moaned. After a few moments of intense pleasure, they both came, Sean first and then Holden and then fell back onto the bed together in a tangle of limbs. They stayed up for a little while afterwards kissing fiercely. Holden didn't even notice it when he broke apart from Sean and fell asleep. Sean stayed up for a little while afterwards staring at Holden's sleeping form. He looked so serene, so peaceful. Sean smiled and then closed his eyes as he drifted off to sleep too. He hadn't felt this good in a long time. To be continued.","LastChapter":"Title: Jump In Author: jillrocca Fandom: Valentine's Day, 2010 Pairings: Sean/Holden Summary: As an international businessman, Holden had been everywhere and seen everything and thought he knew it all.

I was too embarrassed to look at her beautiful face. \"Yeah Sharkie.\" She answered her flamed hair seemed to be dancing around her head. There's something I have to tell you…. I said not sure if I should tell her the truth What is it? Worry filled her eyes. Are you OK? She asked me . I'm fine I said assuring her that everything is OK I just need to tell you something. Her face softened and seemed to relax. She slowly sat down on my bed careful not to set it on fire. I took a deep breath and said: I love you She gasped. I held my breath. She opened her mouth to say something but no words came back. Her lips pressed aginst mine. I felt a shiver spread through out my body that had nothing to do with her fire.[Chapter 2] Feeling lava girl's lips against mine was the best feeling ever. After a few seconds she pulled away. She turned around and sat on the bed. A wave of confusion washed over me. As she turned her hair swept by my face. It smelled of fire. The most beautiful Scent I've ever smelled better then the spray of the ocean. Sharkie? She asked. Yes? I answered back immediately. I've always loved you. I love the way you get angry when someone talks about the people you love. I love the way the water glistens on your skin. I love the way the sun reflects off your skin. I gasped. Lava Girl. I love you so much. I love the way your hair blows in the wind. I love the flames you create. They not only provide light to my heart. A wave of sadness fell over her face. Immediately I sat next to her and cupped her face in my hands. We cant be together she said on the edge of tears. Why not? I asked. I'm fire and your water. Every time I touch you I burn you. I thought it over and realized that my hands were on her face and it didn't burn me. Lava girl I'm touching you right now and you're not burning me right now. She smiled and I resumed our kiss. She sat on my lap and her arms wrapped around my neck. I laid her down on the bed and gently laid myself over her. Her warm hands caressed my back. That doesn't burn? It's the most beautiful feeling I've ever encountered in my life.[Chapter 3] That very night I made love with lava girl. I didn't feel one inch of pain. It was the best day of my life.

She kissed me passionately and we slept in each other's arms. She was my everything.[Chapter 4] Lava girl awakened when the sun came up. She couldn't help but wonder did that really happen or was it a dream? She sat up and realized this was not her bedroom. She did not have blue walls and shark boxers laying on the floor. She looked down and found herself wrapped in blue sheets. She felt the sheets move and heard the mattress creak as a figure sat up. Hey LG shark boy exclaimed. Hey sharkie she said unsteadily. Last night was….she trailed off hoping he would finish the sentence. Shark boy instantly sprang to the other side of the bed and worry washed over his f ace. Did I do something wrong? He asked his voice full of worry. NO! Lava girl quickly answered. It was perfect she said crawling over to him and sitting on his lap. Relief found shark boy and he said in that case….let's do it again. Lavagirl smiled as the covers shifted and shark boy fell on top of lava girl.[Chapter 5] A slap across the face All of a sudden the passion was rudely interrupted by the knocking on our door. I grabbed the cover off the sheet and gave lava girl a brief kiss. I said I'll be right back. I answered the door and who would be standing there but the ice princess. There was an awkward silence as she stared at my revealed scorch marks on my torso. She let herself in and brushed pass me. I shivered violently she was freezing. She turned around and faced me and said: Hello Shark boy. Before I could say anything back she practically jumped into my arms. Her arms locked around me and I grabbed onto her to prevent her from falling. To my horror Lava girl walked in wearing her nighty. Her mouth fell open at the sight of us. Here we were the ice princess's legs around my waist and my arms around her waist with shirt off. We instantly sprang apart. I could feel the heat pooling out of Lava girl's eyes. The ice princess simply jumped down and faced her. They stood inches apart. The ice princess cooly whispered to her now would be a good time to leave. I watched in what seemed to be slow motion as lava girls fist combined with her face knocking the crown off her head. She shot her a cold look gathered her crown and left without a word but not before she blew me a kiss that I did not want. As I heard the door slam I looked at lava girl. She ran to me and for a minute I thought we would share one of our passionate kiss but instead her hand collided with my face leaving a scorch mark on my cheek. I was blinded by pain. I saw her run away up to her room and heard the door lock. I felt my heart split into two as I looked for the first aid kit. I couldn't help but cry.[Chapter 6] I instantly Ran over to the first aid kit (out of habit). As I sat down and began to wash my wound. I thought about all the adventures. I thought about how I had broken her heart. Mostly I thought about how the ice princess just ruined my life. As soon as my face was bandaged I headed up to Lava girls room. I wasn't surprised the door was locked. I knocked and said: H-Hey open the door. Through the thick door I could hear her sniffling. In between sniffles she said: Go Away! Lava girl you know I can't do that. She continued crying and finally opened the door. At the sight of her I felt grass shatter on my heart. Her hair was hotter than usual, her cheeks and eyes stained red. She was inches from my face. As she attempted to speak tears streamed down her face. Without thinking I scooped her into my arms and brought her into my room. My room was still scattered with our clothes. I sat on the bed and pulled her into my lap. Lava girl I promised nothing happened. In a cold voice that pierced my heart she said: Tell me what happened. I sighed and said: I went down to get the door and it opened it and she was there she walked in and practically jumped in my arms. I didn't want her to fall so I caught her that's all. She stared into my eyes and stood up. She walked towards the door and said get dress. Confusion washed over me. Why? I asked. Were going on a trip to the ice castle.[Chapter 7] A trip to the castle I desperately tried to catch my breath as I tried to keep up with Lava Girl. Her hair burned brighter than usual and her foot prints created deep gashes and horrifying burns in the ground. I have never seen anybody so angry. Within seconds she reached the bridge to the castle. Her chest heaved with anger. Ten minutes later I stood next her. Lava girl I said slowly. I want you to calm down. But she didn't seem to hear me. Her fists clenched and it burned horribly to stand next to her. Without warning she lifted herself off the ground and flew over the bridge. My mouth stood agape and I ran as fast as I could. I honestly feared for the Ice Princess's life. When I reached the castle she didn't even bother to knock. She melted down the door and stormed in. I found her lingering towards the stairs she looked extremely pissed off. I followed her up the stairs and my jaw practically hit the ground as she burst through the door that read: THE PRINCESS'S ROOM. I held my breath for what was soon to come as she stormed in and slammed the door shut leaving scorch marks behind.","LastChapter":"A trip to the castle I desperately tried to catch my breath as I tried to keep up with Lava Girl.

It's just a great movie to me so I thought about making episodes about them. I will make as many as I possibly can. Subscribe to me so you can get the next episode when I publish it. I hope you enjoy. Now fasten your seat belts, we're about to go to Planet Drool! I do not own Shark Boy and Lava Girl , Robert Rodriguez does. :^( But I do own this plot. :^) Episode #1 The passage of time Mr. Electric was destroyed a month ago. Linus, or Mr. Positive took his place in running the planet. Lava Girl became Queen of Volcanoes and Shark Boy, who was now King of the Ocean, looked for his father. Sometimes they got together to fight crimes. They also helped Max on earth but only rarely since he mostly visited them. On one of those rare days Max called Shark Boy to help him find a lost dream in the Dream Graveyard. He was asking for his flushed away fish that maybe he could get back. Of course Shark Boy ran for the Dream Graveyard as soon as he heard about the fish. Lava Girl heard about it and went with him saying \"Once a team always a team\" When they got to the passage of time, which lead to the graveyard, they were shocked. It was all rusted and nothing was moving. The Cuckoos from the Cuckoo clocks just hung there on rusted coils. Lava Girl was the first one to break the silence \"What happened here?\" She looked down at the railway then up at the clocks. \"Everything stopped\" Shark Boy answered \"But why?\" He ran over to the entrance of the passage of time. \"This thing thing is connected to Mr. Electric's old lair and ever since Mr. Electric was defeated...\" He turned his towards Lava Girl \"Ever since Mr. Electric was defeated his lair went down with him and if his lair went down...\" She concluded his sentence and now it was his turn to finish hers \"If his lair went down... so did the passage of time.\" Shark Boy concluded \"Do you know what that means? Soon time will stop and we will not only lose or powers but we might lose all progress\" \"What do you mean?\" asked Shark Boy \"You know, time equals progress and without progress we can never get anything done. Even the beating of a heart is progress and without the heart we-\" \"Die\" Finished Shark Boy in his negative voice. \"Yeah... Sharky give me your hand\" \"Why?\" \"Just do it!\" Lava Girl said impatiently He stuck out his hand and she grabbed it. Shark Boy braced for the burn of her hand but it didn't come. \"What the-?\" \"Progress. Even heat is progress\" She confirmed sighing \"Let me hear your heart\" She pressed her head against Shark Boy's chest, which made Shark Boy smile, and waited for the slow beat. Thank goodness. It came. \"It's slowing. That's really not good. Come on we have to find Max. He'll know what to do\" \"Max this, Max that\" Shark Boy muttered \"Marry him why don't cha\" Lava Girl raced off so she didn't hear. Tobor's voice came from behind him \"Jealous Shark Boy?\" \"No!\" Shark Boy replied sharply not turning around \"She's just always thinking of Max\" \"Max is a good kid and you being angry is a sign of jealousy\" \"It wouldn't make sense to be jealous. I can't touch her without being burned, well not now but I used to, and she probably thinks I'm a grouch\" \"You are. But find your inner light then maybe she wouldn't think that\" \"She thinks I'm a grouch?\" Asked Shark Boy turning around but Tobar was already gone. \"Crazy robot\" He muttered under his breath \"Shark Boy! Come on where did you go?\" Lava Girl called from far ahead. \"Coming!\" And he ran forward to find her \"What happened?\"asked Lava Girl \"Got lost\" Shark Boy replied curtly \"But you were right behind me\" \"I just got lost, OK!\" Yelled Shark Boy walking faster to avoid seeing her and vice versa Lava Girl felt her first tear but wiped it away before Shark Boy could see. They got to the new Shark Rocket and climbed in. A voice from above mechanically said \"Lift off in three, two, one!\" but nothing happened. \"What now!\" Yelled Shark Boy, his bad mood still with him. \"Another progress failure. This isn't good. If we can't contact Max then what can we do?\" \"Maybe we don't need Max!\" Lava Girl ignored him and asked \"Can you come here?\" Shark Boy sighed and got up \"I'm not usually a lazy person but this whole 'no progress' thing is really slowing me down\" Lava Girl grabbed his hand and checked his pulse \"Your pulse is slowing again. It's really worrying me.\" \"What about you?\" Shark Boy asked She checked her own pulse and gasped \"My pulse is two times slower than yours!\" \"What do we do?\" \"It's five o' clock. Maybe Max is daydreaming\" Lava Girl mused hurriedly \"In that case let's go to Volcano Beach\" Shark Boy opened the door and they stepped out. *** Over at Volcano Beach a young blond boy was sitting on a large rock reading his new dream journal. He wondered where his friends Shark Boy and Lava Girl were. The boy's name was Max. He was the creator of Planet Drool. How he got here by sleeping. Before he fell asleep today he was studying. He knew how to wake up but he wanted to escape from math for a while. He waited for his friends on the rock and finally then they ran up to him. \"Where have you two been?\" asked Max \"Max! Thank goodness your here. Time is stopping here on Planet Drool\" Rushed Lava Girl \"The passage of time is broken and all progress is about to stop\" said Shark Boy They explained everything that happened before Max came. \"Well\" Max said trying to put everything together \"Did you think of turning Mr. Electric's lair back on?\" \"We can't his key was destroyed with him\" replied Lava Girl \"Yeah but there's another entrance\" Max said \"The puzzle key\" \"The puzzle key?\" They asked in unison \"Yes, you need a transition of hot and cold to open it. Like Ying and Yang\" Max explained \"What does that have to do with Mr. Electric?\" Shark Boy asked \"I dreamed of it recently\" \"We need the Ice Princess\" Surprisingly that came from Lava Girl. Shark Boy and Max turned there heads incredulously to her. *** In front of Mr. Electric's lair were Shark Boy, Lava Girl, Max, Linus and the Ice Princess. \"What are you doing here Linus?\" Max asked politely since they were friends now. \"I wanted to see if I could help\" Linus replied \"And what am I supposed to do?\" Asked the Ice Princess \"Try to use your powers\" Max said \"When I count to three you and Lava Girl have to try really really hard to use your powers\" They nodded there heads. \"One, two...THREE\" Lava Girl and the Ice Princess splayed there hands a pathetic wisp came out. \"The lack of progress doesn't let us use our powers\" Lava Girl complained Tobor came flying towards them. \"Problem?\" He asked \"We need to activate the key but our powers aren't working\" said the Ice Princess \"You think that they aren't working but believe that they are and they will come. If you really want it you will get it\" Tobor said and he flew away Lava Girl and Ice Princess sighed and closed their eyes putting there differences aside, believing and wanting for their powers to come back. They splayed their hands again and out came lava and ice. Before anyone could celebrate Lava Girl fainted. \"Lava Girl!\" Shark Boy yelled crouching down to her. Ice princess stopped to look at them. \"What can I do?\" She asked hoping to be of assistance. Shark Boy checked Lava Girl's pulse and went quiet. \"There's no pulse\" he said weakly \"She's dead\" his voice cracked at dead. \"Stand back. I have an idea.\" said Linus. Out of his pocket he produced two metal objects. \"One, two, three!\" he said rubbing them together and pressing them on her chest. There was a sick electric sound and Lava Girl's stomach jumped up. Linus continued the procedure a couple times until Lava Girl opened her eyes. \"What happened?\" She asked looking around. \"Your pulse stopped,\" explained Max \"Do you feel OK?\" \"Yeah. I feel better.\" She got up and stood next to the Ice Princess. \"Let's try again\" Shark Boy looked at her incredulously \"I thought you were dead! You scared me bad! You owe me a new heart cause this one had a heart attack!\" Lava Girl smiled at his concern \"Thanks for worrying about me Sharky\" Shark Boy turned around, his arms crossed, embarrassed \"Whatever\" he muttered. Lava Girl and the Ice Princess splayed their hands and again lava and ice came out. The two ingredients mixed at the large battery shaped key and it started glowing. Two large doors opened and light filled the lair. The passage of time, that was a under them, started humming and moving again. Lava Girl heated up again. She touched Shark Boy on the arm and burned him. \"Ow!\" \"Burn's back\" She confirmed Shark Boy grimaced and rubbed his arm. \"Great\" he muttered sarcastically And so time was restored on Planet Drool.

I hoped you guys liked Episode 1 and I hope you'll like this one as well. Special thanks to superstoyboi for giving me the idea, thank you so much you really helped BIG time. Thanks to Taylor 33 for being the first one to review my story. Also a special thanks to my best friend ALICEandra624 for being the first to read it. I would like to thank all of you for complimenting my story. I do not own Shark Boy and Lava Girl but I do own this little bottle of hand Sanitizer \"Ahhh cleanliness\" :^) Linus, super gum and evil magnets. Linus paced his new headquarters. In his hand was his positively charges phone. He clicked on an extra button and was transported back to earth. Linus wiped the drool from his mouth as he got up from his bed. It was the weekend and hopefully Max would be home. Once he got to the right house he knocked on the door and finally Max opened it. \"Linus? What's wrong?\" Max yawned \"Sorry to wake you, Max, but I have a problem\" Linus said stepping into the house. \"You see, I don't have a sidekick anymore. Everyone has a partner. Shark Boy and Lava Girl, you and Marissa\" Max blushed when he said that. Linus continued \"But my partner exploded!\" Linus said remembering Mr. Electric. \"Don't worry, Linus, I have an idea.\" Max said to follow him. In Max's room was a transporter that could take him to Planet Drool. He clicked the GO button and the wind rushed past them. Max's room was replaced with Planet Drool. \"OK\" said Max \"Time to get you a sidekick \" He put two fingers to his temple, closed his eyes and said \"Your partner will wear a purple suit. He will also blow super gum that traps people in many different ways. His name will be Thomas, no, Tom-Tom! Suddenly Tom-Tom appeared next to Linus. Next to Tom-Tom was a little girl. Her hair was blond and in Pigtails. Her outfit was yellow with metal chunks randomly spread out on it. \"Who's the girl?\" Linus asked \"I'm Maggie, Tom-Tom's little sister.\" She replied her voice was young yet powerful. \"She must have slipped out\" Max apologized \"You calling me a mistake?\" she asked shrilly \"No of course not!\" yelled Max \"Good. Come on Tom-Tom \" she said walking away \"No, I have to stay with my new partner, Linus\" Said Tom-Tom for the first time. Max created him with knowledge in his mind so he already knew what to do. Tom-Tom had black thin hair. His cheeks were large so he could fill them with his massive wads of gum. He had pockets all around his purple jumpsuit to hold the gum. \"Fine!\" Yelled Maggie \"I'll find my own partner! From now on call me Magnetisa!\" Suddenly the random chunks on her suit became obvious, they were magnets. She grabbed a small one from her pocket and at her command, it extended. She swirled it around like a helicopter blade, then she flew away. \"Well that can't be good\" said Max \"Don't worry\" said Tom-Tom \"She'll chill. She tends to be a bit negative but she'll be fine\" \"Then come on new partner, let's go. What do you want to do?\" Linus asked \"Ride the roller coaster?\" \"OK, come on. Thanks Max! You really helped me out.\" Linus thanked \"No problem. Can I come with you?\" \"Of course, come on\" \"I wonder what Shark Boy and Lava Girl are doing right now.\" Lava Girl was on top of a dormant volcano trying to revive it when a little girl in a yellow suit appeared in front of her. Lava Girl looked up. \"Hello. Who are you?\" \"Magnetisa. I'm new here\" she held out her hand. Lava Girl shook it accidentally forgetting that she would burn her. \"Ow! How dare you burn me?\" Magnetisa yelled She flipped Lava Girl on her back and threw her of the Volcano. Luckily she landed on the sand of Volcano Beach. She got up ready to fight. Magnetisa flew onto the sand to continue hurting Lava Girl. She swung her metal staff (the one that helped her fly) at Lava Girl. Lava Girl sidestepped and threw lava at her. Magnetisa moved but was slightly burned at the shoulder. They continued on like this until someone ran up behind Lava Girl. There weren't many things that could scare Magnetisa but there was one thing. After all, everyone has a fear of something. Magnetisa looked up at an angry face and squeeled. She was terribly afraid of sharks, or any thing that looked like one. She twirled the staff above her head and swirled it and then she flew away. Lava Girl turned to see Shark Boy. \"Are you OK?\" he asked \"I'm fine.\" said Lava Girl brushing sand of of her. \"Just a little bruised\" \"Good then let's find out what she's up to\" he said, his eyes following where Magnetisa was flying. They ran to their motorcycles and started riding. Lava Girl explained who Magnetisa was as they rode on their bikes. \"Look! She's heading towards Mr. Electrics old lair!\" she shouted over the roar of the bikes. \"She'll never get past the locked doors!\" Shark Boy yelled back \"We broke that!\" yelled Lava Girl Shark Boy was quiet for a second then he muttered \"Oh yeah\" to himself \"We have to stop doing that\" Magnetisa was in the liar when Shark Boy and Lava Girl burst through the door. Behind them were Max, Linus and Tom-Tom. \"Well, well, well. If it isn't the people who like to come into rooms dramatically. What do you want? Justice? Money? A copy of Alexa Vega in concert? Ooh, maybe a cat. You people like cats, right?\" \"Very funny Maggie. What do you think your doing in here?\" said Tom-Tom \"It's Magnetisa to you! None of you respect me. No one understands what I'm capable of! I'll show you. I'll show all of you. I finally found my new partner as well Thomas, oops I mean Tom-Tom .\" she said mockingly \"Meet my little friends the Plug Hounds!\" Magnetisa moved to one side and out of a large door came hundreds of thousands of Plug Hounds. \"Oh and my little amigos the Electron Tigers!\" Out came tigers filled with negative charge. Suddenly a fight broke out. Tom-Tom grabbed a wad of gum the size of two fists and stuffed them in his cheeks. He blew a giant bubble and trapped five Plug Hounds and three Electron Tigers. Then he stretched the remaining gum from his moth and stretched it to make a rope. He twirled it like a lasso and grabbed ten Plug Hounds and smashed them against a wall. Shark Boy used his karate to smash the Electron Tigers, he destroyed 20 in 10 minutes. He gushed water at Plug Hounds to short out their circuits. Max being the day dreamer threw all kinds of things to destroy Magnetisa's minions. Linus used his positive powers to counter act the the Electron Tigers. Lava Girl saw Magnetisa walked down some stairs and hid behind a door that was labeled Control room . So she followed her. \"Why are you doing this?\" She asked her in side the room. Magnetisa had her back turned to her. \"No one gets how powerful I am. My own brother chose to go of with some other kid instead of me . They think I'm worthless.\" \"No they don't. I think you over did it with the evil army.\" Lava Girl said walking deeper ino the room, closer to Magnetisa. \" Over did it?\" Magnetisa echoed \"Ha! They deserved it! Now they'll know who's more powerful.\" \"I think your very powerful, but why use it on evil?\" Lava Girl said Magnetisa turned to look at Lava Girl. \"The truth is, I don't like it here. I'm alone. My brother didn't stay by me so why would any one else\" Magnetisa confessed \"We would if you gave us a chance. What if I told you that you could work here, on Planet Drool with Linus and your brother and help supply power to the world? And you can come visit any one here. There are hundreds of kids and their dreams. What do you say? Will you help us in stead of hurt us?\" Lava Girl asked \"What if those kids don't like me?\" Magnetisa asked \"If your nice to them and you give them a chance, they'll like you.\" Lava Girl replied smiling Magnetisa sighed \"That sounds like a good idea. You think they'll forgive me?\" Lava Girl said \"I'm sure, if you apologize, they will\" \"Can you promise me one thing?\" \"Sure, what?\" \"Keep the shark kid away from me? He scares me\" Lava Girl laughed \"Sure\" Then she gasped \"What?\" \"Their still fighting!\" shouted Lava Girl \"Oh my gosh!\" yelled Magnestisa She ran out of the control room with Lava Girl following. She took out a remote and turned the rest of the Plug Hounds and Electron Tigers off. \"What happened?\" asked Shark Boy looking up. Magnetisa stepped down from the stairs and said \"I'm sorry for all of this. Will you forgive me?\" Max, Linus, Tom-Tom, and Shark Boy looked at Lava Girl who smiled and nodded her head. \"I promise never to do it again. I was wrong, I'm really sorry.\" Tom-Tom stepped up to Magnetisa and said \"Won't do it again?\" \"Cross my heart\" \"'K\" he said and shook her hand \"Your forgiven\" \"Just like that?\" Magnestisa asked \"Just like that\" Tom-Tom replied Max came up to her and shook her hand. \"Forgiven\" Linus came up, too. \"Forgiven\" he said shaking her hand. Shark Boy came up but Magnetisa squeaked and backed up. \"What?\" he asked \"She's afraid of sharks\" Lava Girl explained \"Oh... sorry.\" \"That's OK\" \"And ... uh I guess your forgiven\" \"Thanks\" she said shyly Soon Magnetisa and Linus became good friends and they helped to supply energy to Planet Drool. Tom-Tom owned a new candy store called Drool candy . Magnetisa was still scared of Shark Boy but she and Lava Girl stayed in touch and she always tried to conquer her fear. Though it never really worked. Things got better around Planet Drool. So far so good. Or are they? Well folks, that's all. Thank you for reading and I hope to see you next time on Shark Boy and Lava Girl: The Series. I got an idea. In the comments write the funniest word you know and if it is funny enough I will put it on my next story. Well... BYE! ~Anya365~[Chapter 3] Well thanks again to superstoyboi124 and ALICEandra624 for reviewing first. Also special thanks to RobinxStarfire67 for this funny word Gobbledygook A 20th century term used to describe nonsensical language like that used by government bureaucrats. :^D I don't own Shark Boy and Lava Girl but I do own this DVD of Shark Boy and Lava Girl. In 3D! OK, lettuce begin the story. :^) Frostbite \"Achoo!\" Max sneezed \"Bless you, Max.\" said Max's mom touching his forehead to check his temperature. \"Your very warm,\" She got up from the corner of his bed and said \"Lie down now. Maybe you can visit Shark Boy and Lava Girl in your dreams if your not sick in there, too.\" she smiled lightly and left the room. Max sighed and closed his eyes. After a while he drifted off to sleep. Shark Boy was pacing on the ice hard water. His breath was visible as he panted. Shivering he walked quickly to the sand and knocked on the door to Lava Girl's cave. \"Lava Girl? LG, can you melt ice? The ocean's as hard as rocks.\" he waited for a reply but there wasn't one. \"Lava Girl?\" He slowly opened the door and looked around the empty cave. After that he spent hours looking for her. Worried he ran every were asking people if they've seen her. No one had and he was getting worried. It wasn't until a little while that he realized the weather. It was freezing and snow was flying everywhere. In the distance a boy called \"Shark Boy, Lava girl?' Shark Boy ran to the voice and found Max. \"Have you seen Lava Girl?\" they both asked at the same time. Shark Boy felt horrible because if Max didn't know where she was it was possible that no one would know. Max realized Shark Boy's silence. \"Don't worry. We'll find her. Why is it so cold? I might get sicker\" \"Oh poor you!\" Shark Boy said sarcastically \"Lava Girl might have disappeared forever but it would be tragic if you had more snot to clean from your nose then usual!\" Max understood Shark Boy by now and knew that when he got scared he got mad. So he didn't say anything more about his cold. \"I think I know why it's so freezing here\" Max said turning his attention to the nearest volcano. \"Look over there. That volcano is dormant. And so is that one, and that one!\" \"What do you mean?\" asked Shark Boy, afraid of the answer. \"Without Lava Girl the volcanoes shut off. She is their light. You may be right, Shark Boy, Lava Girl might really be lost. Also, without volcanoes and heat the cold from Marissa's castle can take over the temperature of Planet Drool\" said Max \"We need to see the Ice Princess then\" said Shark Boy, not making his remark a question. \"Exactly. Come on.\" said Max So they raced off to Marissa's (also known as the Ice Princess') castle. The Ice Princess was an the floor in her room, bored. She had her head rested against the frame of the bed. Her cat was above her under her blanket of snow. The cat jumped down on the Ice Princesses lap. \"At least I'm not allergic to you here, Frost\" sad the Ice Princess There was a knock at the door. \"Enter\" the Ice Princess called dully. An Ice minion opened the door and bowed. \"Princess, we have visitors\" said the Ice minion \"They claim to be called Max and Shark Boy.\" The Ice Princess jumped up and smiled \"Let them in immediately!\" The cat fell down from her lap yowling but they both ignored it. The Ice minion bowed and said \"Of course your Highness, right away.\" He swiftly walked out of the room followed by the Ice Princess. They walked into the grand hall, where two kids were waiting. Suddenly the Ice minion grabbed the Princess from behind. \"Hey! What do you think your doing?\" she yelled Two more minions grabbed Shark Boy and Max from behind. \"Stop!\" \"Hey!\" There was a rumble of evil laughter and then darkness. \"Marissa?\" \"Max?\" \"Shark Boy?\" \"Max?\" \"Marissa?\" \"Ow that's my leg, Max!\" yelled Shark Boy \"Sorry\" \"Ow! OK who burned me?\" said Shark Boy angrily \"Shark Boy?\" \"Lava Girl?\" \"Shark Boy!\" \"Lava Girl!\" Lava Girl lit up a torch with her hand and she smiled ecstatically. \"I would hug you if it wouldn't burn you!\" \"What happened to you?\" asked Max \"I came to thank the Ice Princess for helping us open Mr. Electric's lair when it was locked but the minute I walked through the door I was trapped in here!\" explained Lava Girl \"Why would my guards do this to us?\" asked the Ice Princess. \"Maybe it wasn't just your guards\" said Shark Boy \"What do you mean?\" asked the Ice Princess \"Someone might be leading them into all this\" said Shark Boy \"My Lord\" knelt the Ice minion \"Yes?\" said a deep voice \"I have captured the princess and her friends\" \"Wonderful\" \"Now what, Lord Frost\" The man turned, his head was that of a white cat the rest was that of a human. \"Bring them to me.\" \"Yes Lord Frost\" After a while of waiting The Ice minion threw Max, Shark Boy, Lava Girl, and the Ice Princess on the floor in front of Lord Frost. \"Frost?\" asked the Ice Princess \"Are you the cause of all this?\" \"Yes\" \"Why?\" \"Did you know that every time you woke up I was left in the cold? Because you had allergies in the real world. Well now I will rule Planet Drool and none of you will ever have a chance to wake up!\" \"Frost, please I'm sorry\" tried the Ice Princess \"Apologies wont work now princess . You can't turn me around.\" Lord Frost got up and strode up to Shark Boy. \"I love a good fish. How would you like to be cooked? Fried, boiled, barbecued? Oh, so many possibilities!\" Shark Boy bared his teeth. \"Very well, I'll freeze you and save you for later.\" he extended his hands and he froze Shark Boy. \"No!\" yelled Lava Girl \"Don't worry about your little friend. He wont feel a thing\" \"Lava Girl\" whispered the Ice Princess \"Give me your hand\" \"Why?\" asked Lava Girl in a hushed hurt voice. \"I have a plan. If I let out a light mist from my hands and you let out only heat. Frost is powered by cold. If your heat and my cool mist mix they will make a humid fog. The fog will either melt him or shrink him.\" \"Good idea\" nodded Lava Girl \"On three. One, two, three!\" They extended there hands and out came the fog. It encircled Frost. \"What is this? Do you think some fog will destroy me? Ha! Think again!\" Frost cackled Shark Boy's body was frozen but his mind wasn't. He bit lightly at a piece of ice and breathed the water in the air. He gushed water everywhere and the ice broke. Frost didn't notice. Shark Boy snuck behind him and jumped on his back. \"What? Get away from me you salt water demon! Stop! Stop!\" Frost fell to the ground and the cat attached to the body fell off and ran away crying \"No!\" As Frost fell out a green ray zapped out of his paw hitting Lava Girl. It didn't seem to hurt her though. So they all ignored it. The master of the body stood up and took off the hat that was covering his head. He looked around awkwardly and walked away. The Ice minion shook his head and said \"What happened\" \"Nothing. Go home and get some rest.\" said the Ice Princess. \"That won't be the last time we see him\" said Shark Boy \"Yes but next time we'll be ready for him\" said the Ice Princess Later that evening Lava Girl was in her cave. She shivered. She looked at her mirror and her eyes turned red. She growled. Her hair turned black as night and her nails extended. Perhaps she shouldn't have ignored the green ray that hit her. She crouched down on the floor and felt the evil that she wished would never arrive encircle her. Oh no! Was the last thing the good part of her thought. Oh yes! was the first thing the evil part of her thought. To be continued... So... what did you think? What will happen to Lava Girl? What about Frost?

I do not own Shark Boy and Lava Girl. Dumb lawyer... ... Continued from episode #3 When we last saw Lava Girl she was in her cave. She shivered. She looked at her mirror and her eyes turned red. She growled. Her hair turned black as night and her nails extended. Perhaps she shouldn't have ignored the green ray that hit her. She crouched down on the floor and felt the evil that she wished would never arrive encircle her. Oh no! Was the last thing the good part of her thought. Oh yes! was the first thing the evil part of her thought. The Darkness in Lava Girl Lava Girl thrashed as her insides durned dark. The light was somewhere deep in her now but it would seem almost impossible to find it. She smiled, no longer remembering the good in her. Completely taken over by blackness. Rest now she thought to her self We have much to do tomorrow. Lava Girl lay down on her bed of rock and fell asleep. When she awoke she looked at her reflection which now looked normal. But inside it wasn't her. It was a disguise. She was still evil. There was a knock at her door. She walked over and opened it. \"LG?\" Shark Boy asked \"You don't look to good...\" Lava Girl's face was fixed in a grimace, making her features sunken. \"I'm fine\" her voice was a bit deeper than usual, like an adult's. \"'K then...\" \"Why did you come?\" she asked \"Just wanted to see if you were okay. Yesterday when Lord Frost attacked us I saw a green beam hit you. I just wanted to make sure you weren't poisoned with radiation.\" he smiled \"As you can see I'm fine. Now if you excuse me.\" and she shut the door, leaving Shark Boy shocked as if she had slapped him. Lava Girl stepped into a lava elevator and shot upward towards the sky. She flew off towards the new forest Max had dreamed up a while back. She walked into a clearing where Frost the cat was. Lord Frost used to be the Ice Princess' cat but when he felt unloved and neglected he became evil. Only yesterday did it happen. He was on a small mobile phone that said Frost loves Fluffy in sparkly letters. \"Yes, Fluffy, I promise I'll be safe. I love you too Fluffykins. Ok I have to go now. No you hang up. No you hang up.\" Lava Girl cleared her throat, her disguise faded and her costume became black again and her nails extended. \"How sweet. Kitty has a girlfriend.\" \"Fluffy, I'll call you later.\" Frost hung up the phone. \"What do you want.\" \"Help. There is a mountain that holds a devise called the Transmooker. Perhaps you've herd of it.\" Lava Girl explained \"Isn't that from a Spy Kids movie?\" Frost asked \"Yes. Max had a dream after watching the movie but this Transmooker is different. The holder gets untold riches and power. It's under very special guarding but I'm one of the guards.\" she smiled \"Why do you need me?\" Frost said \"Well, if I touch the Transmooker it will go up in flames. But if you use it we will share the riches.\" she explained Lord Frost nodded his head and smiled showing his pointy little teeth. \"You have a deal!\" Linus was in Tom-Tom's candy shop. Tom-Tom was a super hero with bubble gum powers. Nowadays he owned Drool Candy, a.k.a his candy store. A candy apple behind Tom-Tom started beeping. \"What's that?\" asked Linus asked, standing up. \"An alarm\" Tom-Tom turned to the apple. He picked it up and took a bite. \"Someone's about to steal the Transmooker!\" he yelled his mouth filled with gooey bits of carmel covered apple. \"You can tell that from eating a candy apple?\" Linus asked He swallowed \"Can't you?\" asked Tom-Tom \"No, but that doesn't matter right now. We have to get to the Transmooker! Call your sister!\" Linus said, running out of the store. \"Tom-Tom to Magnetisa, over.\" Tom-Tom said into his gummy- talkie. \"I read, over.\" Magnetisa was Tom-Tom's little sister. She had the power to control magnets. \"Emergency get to Transmooker mountain, over\" Tom-Tom replied \"Got it, over\" said Magnetisa. Linus had called Max and Max had called the Ice Princess. Max had called Shark Boy who tried to call Lava Girl but she wouldn't respond. \"Maybe she already knows where to go.\" tried Max \"Maybe... come on\" said Shark Boy Lord Frost was on the mountain. His body was attached to a new artificial body, so he would look taller. Lava Girl was behind a pillar. She knew her friends would be coming and she wanted to surprise them. \"Ah, finally. Here they come.\" smiled Lord Frost. \"Hello!\" \"Great it's the pussy cat\" said Shark Boy \"That's Mr. Pussy Cat to you!\" Lord Frost snapped The Ice Princess stepped up to him. \"Frost. How can you still be at it, trying to destroy us.\" \"I'm the bad guy, darling. It's what I do.\" Lord Frost said \"I should have known when I bought you that you were evil. The pet store owner said \"Beware, for this is a bad one\" but I just wouldn't listen\" said the Ice Princess Lord Frost smirked and walked back up to the pillar. \"But, I didn't do this on my own,\" he said then chuckled \"Introducing, Lava Girl\" Every one gasped but it was clear that Shark Boy's gasp was the loudest. Lava Girl strode down the stairs, right next to Lord Frost. Her suit was black as coal and the lava running through it was ruby red. Matching her eyes. She smiled \"Surprised?\" \"What happened to you? asked Max \"I turned evil, duh.\" Lava Girl said \"Why?\" Lava Girl opened her mouth and then closed it. She realized that she couldn't answer the question because she didn't know. \"Well,\" interrupted Lord Frost \"This has been fun but I think now is the time to take the Transmooker.\" \"Get him!\" yelled Linus Everyone shot forward to fight Lord Frost and the minions that appeared behind the pillar. Everyone but Shark Boy. He stayed back and stared in shock at who Lava Girl had become. There were only five minions so it was easy for all of them to fight. \"Lava Girl!\" Magnetisa called \"Snap out of it!\" Shark Boy got an idea. He ran back, away from the battle. \"Go ahead and run!\" yelled Lava Girl \"You were always a coward!\" That made Shark Boy breath deeply but he shook the insult off and ran. Shark Boy entered a garage \"Tobor, awake!\" he yelled \"Yes?\" said Tobor opening his eyes. Back on Transmooker Mountain there was a battle going on. Everyone was fighting tooth and nail. The fight wasn't easy anymore. The minions doubled in size and in armor. \"Were losing!\" yelled Max \"Should we retreat?\" Suddenly from behind Tobor came flying in with Shark Boy on his eye ball. Shark Boy whispered to Tobor \"Are you sure I should say that?\" \"Positive.\" said Tobor \"But it's so not me.\" Shark Boy said \"Do you mean what your about to say?\" asked Tobor \"Yes but...\" \"Trust me. You'll know what to do.\" said Tobor Tobor landed and Shark Boy did a summersault and jumped to the floor. He ran up to Lord Frost and said \"Let me speak to Lava Girl, to say goodbye.\" Lord Frost sighed and said \"Make it quick.\" Shark Boy went up to Lava Girl. \"Lava Girl?\" She looked at him with sharp eyes. \"What?\" \"Lava Girl, I need to tell you something.\" \"Hurry then. I have plans to rule the world.\" she said \"Don't you see this isn't you? Open your eyes, LG!\" Shark Boy said \"Don't call me that! I am not, LG. Your so lame. Why don't you fight me instead of talk.\" said Lava Girl \"I won't fight you.\" said Shark Boy \"Oh, what Mr. Fish Stick is scared?\" Lava Girl insulted That got him mad \"Do you even know why your evil! Why do you want to rule this place when you already did!\" he yelled \"We ruled it together... can't you remember?\" And Lava Girl did remember. That opened her eyes but she just needed to open her heart. \"Lava Girl, I thought you were my friend. It's hard to say this but... I uh l-lo... LG?\" Shark Boy looked up. Lava Girl started to transform. Light exited all the cracks in her dark suit. Slowly the darkness melted away and the real Lava Girl showed up. \"Shark Boy, you did it!\" Lava Girl yelled excited. She hugged him then backed up realizing she was burning him. \"Sorry.\" Shark Boy smiled \"That's okay\" It still burned but he was just happy Lava Girl was back. \"What is this?\" asked Frost (ah who am I kidding this cat's to lame to be called 'lord'.) \"Frost\" said Lava Girl \"Say goodbye to your powers.\" she extended her hands and shot out a ray of lava. He ducked and started to run. \"You haven't see the last of me!\" he yelled, running down the hill and into the forest. The minions dissolved into sand. \"Great\" said Shark Boy \"What? We won this round. We did it.\" said Lava Girl \"Yeah but now we have to see him again\" he replied (Not to mention that I have to write another story with Frost in it.) \"So...\" said Lava Girl \"What were you going to say before I turned into a ball of blinding sunshine? It started with I l-lo...?\" \"I uh... well you see. Uh... what were we talking about?\" Shark Boy asked then looked down at his watch. \"Well, would you look at the time? I have to go home and feed my killer shark, BYE!\" and he ran off. \"Shark Boy!\" yelled Lava Girl chasing him \"You haven't seen the last of me either!\" she laughed and stopped. \"He doesn't have a pet killer shark. Or does he?\" and she started chasing him again. Well... how about them apples? Thanks for reading. Reviews are like my fuel. The more I have the more I write so please review! Thanks!

Congrats you win... uh you win...a-a brand new imaginary pen! I bet your just jumping with excitement! No need to thank me. Let the show begin! I do not own Shark Boy and Lava Girl but I do own this bubble gum, POP! (Oh no it's stuck in my hair!) :^0 The Return of Mr. Elecricidadadadadad. Somewhere near Mr. Electric's old lair something evil was stirring. Electricity lit the sky and something was formed from the metal floor. Mr. Electric stood there and started laughing. He stopped and turned around and said, \"I'm back!\" Lava Girl was coming out from cave when she saw the flash of lightning. \"Shark Boy!\" she called across the beach. \"Get out of the water! There's lightning!\" Shark Boy swam up to the beach. He spit out a chunk of seaweed that had gotten stuck in his mouth. \"C'mon, Lava Girl. It's just lightning.\" Lava Girl looked up at the sky warily. \"It just reminds me of electric eels.\" \"Oh,\" said Shark Boy. \"Well... I'll be fine.\" Shark Boy wasn't very used to being worried about. Sometimes when Lava Girl did, he didn't know what to say. Or feel... Thunder and lightning shook the sky again. \"Looks like a storms brewing,\" Lava Girl confirmed. \"Wanna come inside?\" Again, Shark Boy didn't know what to say so he nodded his head and they walked inside the cave. Shark Boy suddenly took notice in Lava Girl as hey entered her cave. The reason for that is because Lava Girl's cave was really dark. She was the only lighting. \"LG, can you light a lamp or something?\" Shark Boy said , crashing into a wall. Lava Girl turned around and laughed. \"Okay.\" So she gathered some loose rock from her cave and some wood from fallen palm trees. She threw them into a pile and placed some inflammable rocks around it. Then she lit the fire and the cave lightened. \"Lava Girl,\" said Shark Boy. \"I need to tell you something.\" \"Sure,\" she said, sitting next to him. \"What is it?\" \"I can only tell you because your my best friend, so don't tell anyone.\" He took a deep breath and said, \"I've been having these weird nightmares.\" Lava Girl turned her head to looked at him. \"Like what?\" \"I've had nightmares about...\" he looked at Lava Girl then said, \"You. About when you became evil...\" Lava Girl became quiet. \"I couldn't control it... I swear . \" Her voice broke at swear. \"I believe you,\" said Shark Boy. \"But I've had other nightmares too. I keep dreaming that something's coming...\" \"What could be coming,\" Lava Girl said \"What could possibly beat you- I mean us?\" Shark Boy smiled and looked at Lava Girl. \"Um...\" \"Yeah...\" \"LG- uh, Lava Girl?\" Shark Boy stuttered. \"Yeah?\" \"About when you turned evil. When I helped your snap out of it, I tried to tell you something but I was to... Well I was trying to say-\" Right before he could finish the door to the cave was burst open and the wind blew the fire out. \"Miss me?\" said a too familiar voice \"Oh no...\" said Shark Boy. \"It's...\" continued Lava Girl \"Mr. Electric,\" Mr. Electric finished for them, stepping into the light. \"Surprised?\" Lava Girl stood up. \"Your not supposed to be alive!\" Lava Girl yelled. \"We destroyed you back on Earth!\" \"Well I guess you were wrong!\" Mr. Electric said. \"Besides, I had a little help from an evil mastermind.\" \"Please don't tell me that your talking about that wuss puss Lord Frost.\" Shark Boy said \"Who? No. Someone better! You don't know him yet but, oh you will,\" he smiled evilly. Shark Boy slid baseball player style under Mr. Electric and started running. Lava Girl followed the same way and together they ran to edge of the beach. Lava Girl stopped dead at the water but Shark Boy allowed it to surround his feet. \"Okay,\" rushed Shark Boy, \"You go get reinforcements. Magnetisa, Tom-Tom, Linus, The Ice Princess and any one else you can find. I'll go get Max and summon every fish or marine animal known to man.\" Lava Girl nodded and they ran in opposite directions. \"MAX, MAX, MAX, MAX, MAX MAX! WAAAAAAAAAAKE UUUUUUUUUUUP!\" Shark Boy yelled obnoxiously at the top of his lungs. Max woke up by the third 'MAX!'. He jumped up and yelled \"What!\" Max wondered how his parents hadn't heard anything... What are you waiting for an explanation? I don't have one so go back to reading the story. Shark Boy explained everything to Max. He described that Mr. Electric was back. Max took a moment to take it all in. \"Lets go then!\" And they all rushed for the door. Max ran madly down the stairs while Shark Boy slid down the stair rail on his heels. Max used his powers and opened a portal just as Shark Boy was about to jump off the rail. They plunged into the spinning vortex. The portal spit them out at someone's feet. \"You two are always so dramatic,\" said Magnetisa. She was a super hero with the power of magnets. Shark Boy and Max looked up at her and she rolled her eyes and smiled. \"Get up, you guys.\" She bent down and lifted them up. \"I just got the call from Lava Girl.\" Magnetisa held up her yellow Picachu iphone. \"So, there's a baddy named Mr. Electric, huh?\" She shrugged, \"We'll beat him. No problem.\" Max shook his head. \"It's not that simple. Besides Mr. Electric mentioned that he was brought back by some sort of evil mastermind.\" \"Shoot. What are we going to do now then?\" Magnetisa asked \"Fight of course,\" said Shark Boy. \"Then we'll fight,\" confirmed Magnetisa \"To the bitter end?\" asked Max \"Sounds like fun,\" nodded Magnetisa. Lava Girl got just about everyone on Planet Drool to assemble in front of Mr. Electric's lair. Shark Boy ran up to join Lava Girl in front of the crowd. \"Nice job,\" he whispered. \"Thanks\" she smiled. Mr. Electric walked out of his lair and looked around at the crowd. \"What is this? Some sort of pep rally? Two four six eight why can't Shark Boy get a date?\" he laughed making Shark Boy growl. \"You know why we're here, cretin!\" yelled Shark Boy. \" We are going to destroy you !\" \"Yeah sure,\" said Mr. Electric. He spread out his wiry arms and electrified half the group of children. Lava Girl looked back at them in panic. She turned back to Mr. Electric. \"You'll pay for that!\" she yelled and before he could say anything she jumped in the air and blasted his face with lava. \"Get it off of me!\" Mr. Electric yelled. \"Gladly!\" Shark Boy shouted and he sprayed a burst of water at him sending him back a few feet. He slammed against his lair and slowly got back up. Mr. Electric rubbed his face and scowled. \"Plug hounds, to your masters aid!\" he shouted. Max pushed his way to the front of the crowd. \"GET THOSE PLUG HOUNDS!\" Max commanded. Suddenly there was a huge fight. The kids that hadn't been electrified let out a menacing battle cry. They all charged the oncoming plug hounds. Tom-Tom chewed a huge wad of gum and blew a bubble the size of a building. It captured at least a dozen plug hounds before bursting. Magnetisa flew into the sky and thunder rumbled. Suddenly lightning hit the ground electrifying plug hounds and avoiding all the kids. She free fell back to the ground. She cracked her fingers. \"Nothing like biased lightning to start a fight,\" she said jumping on a plug hound. \"Giddy up, doggy!\" The plug hound obeyed her for she was radiating electricity just like his master. She rode him like a horse around the fight. Tom-Tom looked over and smiled giving her a thumbs up. \"Nice one sis!\" The plug hounds crowded him and he erupted in hot fudge. \"I have got to get better minions,\" Mr. Electric muttered. Suddenly he burst with electricity and lightning. Everyone fell to the ground. Everyone but Magnetisa. She stood there, her arms crossed and her blond pigtails blowing in the wind. She watched Mr. Electric take to the sky. Magnetisa walked up to Shark Boy, who was slowly getting up. \"Ow,\" he said rubbing his arm. \"Are you ok? Never mind. No time for questions. Take everyone to refuge and help them recover. I 'll call you when I need you. Be ready to spring into action.\" Lava Girl walked up to them. \"Sounds good but where are you going?\" \"I'm going to have a little talk with Mr. Electric,\" Magnetisa said darkly. Mr. Electric was typing on an over-sized computer in his lair. He was completely unaware of the young blond girl leaning against a wall behind him. \"What are you typing?\" she asked casualy and he tensed. \"Twitter? Facebook? Fan Fiction? Maybe Runescape. I bet you'd play that. I heard it's fun.\" Slowly Mr. Electric turned around. \"And who are you? Some sort of cheerleeder?\" \"What is with you and cheerleeders? When you were destroyed you must have hit your head first.\" Magnetisa pushed her self off the wall and walked up to him without fear. \"What's your deal, Mr. Electric? Why do you try to be bad all the time?\" Magnetisa asked. \"Try? I am bad!\" Mr. Electric yelled. \"Yeah, sure. So why exactly do you do all this? There's a better life than just being evil. Trust me, I know.\" Magnetisa said \"I see what your trying to do!\" Mr. Electric yelled. \"Your trying to make me good! You may have given in to all this heroic kindness junk but not me.\" He spread out his arm and electriciy shot out. It zigzaged up Magnetisa's body but she didn't even flinch. She just stood there with a bored expression on her face. \"Wanna try again?\" she asked Mr. Electric stood there with a confused expression. Magnetisa simply chuckled and shook her head. \"That was a nice try,\" she said as if Mr. Electric were a kindergardener. \"What? To afraid to do it again?\" Mr. Electric put his hands together and slowly spread them out creating a web of electricity. He pushed it out in front of him and it hit Magnetisa. She sighed and said, \"Pitiful, just pitiful.\" Mr. Electric growled and zapped the roof just above Magnetisa's head. She jumped out of the way as giant rocks pummeled to the ground exactly where she had been standing. \"Not so cocky now, huh little girl?\" yelled Mr. Electric. Magnetisa gasped for air. A little string of her hair was floating in front of her face and she blew it away. \"I bet you can't do that again!\" Magnetisa taunted. A plan just formed in her head. \"Oh yeah?\" yelled Mr. Electric with glee. He raised his arms and electricity shook the roof. The entire thing shook and then started to crumble. Magnetisa ducked and produced a shield out of the magnetic pieces of metal around her. She heard Mr. Electric scream. The entire lair crumbled on top of him. Now Mr. Electric is a strong man and every piece of debris that hit him was nothing compared to what hit him next. A enormous twenty- foot long lightning bolt struck him right where his heart should have been. Mr. Electric fell to the ground and his last words were, \"I should have stuck with late night t.v. comedy.\" Then an eerie silence spread through the large pile of rubbish that used to be Mr. Electrics lair. Tom- Tom came flying in on a large flying chocolate bar. \"Maggie?\" he called. \"MAGGIE!\" he shouted. Tom- Tom grabbed his walkie-talkie and talked through it. \"I need back up. There's a huge pile of wood, bricks, and metal over here and I can't find Magnetisa. Can someone please come?\" \"Don't worry Tom- Tom,\" said Lava Girl's voice. \"We're on our way.\" Everyone spent hours looking. All they found where the remains of the lair. No one found Magnetisa and no one found Mr. Electric. \"Maybe they were teleported somewhere else,\" Shark Boy told Tom- Tom who was horrorstruck. \"I was too late,\" said Tom-Tom. \"If I just got here earlier...\" and he put his head into his hands. \"Come on, Tom- Tom,\" Shark Boy said trying to comfort him. \"It could be worse. We might have found her eaten alive by vultures or frozen by ice giants or crushed by the house. But we didn't find her at all so there's still a chance.\" Tom- Tom looked up, raising an eyebrow. \"Some how, Shark Boy that doesn't make me feel better.\" and he walked away. Lava Girl walked up to Shark Boy and smacked his head. \"Eaten by vultures? Frozen by ice giants? Crushed by the house? Are you trying to make him feel better or terrorize him?\" \"I'm just trying to make him feel better.\" shrugged Shark Boy. Lava Girl shook her head. \"She's going to be alright though, right?\" said Lava Girl \"How is it possible that she could disappear like that?\" The Ice Princess ran up to them with Max at her side. \"We know where she is!\" They yelled in unison. \"Where?\" \"The Dream Tower\" said Max darkly, \"And we have a new bad guy on our hands.\" Dark clouds circled in the air and thunder shook everything. The strangest thing of all was the lightning. It was purple and somewhere in the distance was a loud menacing laugh. A scream came shortly after. That scream sounded too familiar. Magnetisa. Tom-Tom was the first to jump on his giant flying chocolate bar and head towards the Dream Tower. \"I'll save you, Maggie!\" he yelled over the cracking thunder clap To be continued...[Chapter 6] Chapter 1: Chapter 1 As usual thnx for all the comments! You guys rock! I do not own Shark Boy and Lava Girl or a llama. I do own Tom-Tom and Magnetisa thanks to superstoyboi124! Thanks! There is a scene where I used something from Teen Titans. I'll tell you when you get there. :^) I don't own Teen Titans either. Thanks RobinxStarfire67 for giving me the idea of Teen Titans from your story! Also, a special Be-lated Happy Birthday to my friend, ALICEandra624 Enjoy! Missing Two weeks... no one has heard or seen Magnetisa since she was captured two weeks ago. Tom-Tom had gone to where he heard her scream the night she disappeared but it was as diserted as the Dream Graveyard. Shark Boy had searched every cave under water and Lava Girl has searched everywhere light touched. Max tried to search for her on earth but he could only go so far. One day Tom-Tom sat at his Candy Shop feeling melancholy. \"I'm never going to find my little sister.\" \"Yes you will,\" Lava Girl reasured. \"She has to be somewhere.\" Tom-Tom looked up, his chin laying on his palm. \"Lava Girl, She's not on Planet Drool and Max is only a kid so he can't search the world.\" His face dropped on the counter. \"She can be anywhere by now,\" his voice muffled by the table top. Lava Girl bit her lip. \"...\" She didn't know what to say. Then her head snapped up. She stood up quickly and said, \"But we can search the world!\" Tom-Tom lifted his head. \"What are you talking about? We haven't visited earth in ages and our powers weaken over there too.\" \"But they don't entirely go away!\" Lava Girl said optimistically \"Come on!\" She grabbed his arm and dragged him across the counter smashing plates and cups as he went. Lava Girl turned and cringed. \"Oops. Sorry about that.\" Tom-Tom wobbled as he got to his feet. \"At least on earth you won't have the strength to do that to me again.\" Tom-Tom rubbed his head, his hair filled with broken glass and sprinkles. The Map A few days later... Max was waiting by the portal at his house when his friends stepped through it. The first to come out was Lava Girl, then Shark Boy who's fishy odor next to Lava Girl's heat filled the room with the smell of sea life and brine. Tom-Tom followed Shark Boy and almost bumped into him. He turned around to close the portal. Linus and The Ice Princess, who was Marissa on earth, said they'd arrive shortly. They all stood impatiently while they waited for them to arrive. Conversation seemed impossible without Magnetisa. She was a conversation starter. Ironic because right now she was the halt of conversation. Ding, dong. \"I'll get it,\" Max stood and ran out of the room and down the stairs. Marissa and Linus walked in and soon were in Max' room. Marissa crouched down and took out a piece of folded paper. \"Okay,\" she said unfolding the paper and laying down a map on the floor. \"I have a plan.\" Everyone huddled around her and she pointed to different marked spots on the map. \"I called some of my friends from around the world. Back when my dad was a traveling comedian we went all over the place,\" Marissa explained. \"Your dad was a comedian?\" Max asked, raising an eyebrow. \"You didn't notice. He's the funniest teacher in the school,\" Marissa said, a bit offended. \"Uh... yeah... of course I noticed,\" Max lied. \"If the other teachers were morticians,\" Linus muttered. Max elbowed him in the ribs. Shark Boy cleared his throat. \"Thank you Shark Boy,\" Marissa said and continued. \"Anyway, my friend Tifa said she saw a girl in black and yellow at a comic con this morning. She even took a picture. It's Magnetisa, look.\" She took out a picture from her pocket and showed it to them. \"Let's go then!\" said Tom-Tom, jumping up. \"Just one problem,\" said Magnetisa. \"It's in Japan.\" \"Oh,\" said Tom-Tom, sitting back down again. \"Hmm,\" said Shark Boy rubbing his chin. \"What are you thinking Sharky?\" Lava Girl asked tilting her head to look at him. \"Japan, huh?\" Japan \"Shark Boy, slow down!\" yelled Lava Girl as the speedboat they were on sped along at rapid speeds. Shark Boy laughed like a little boy who has been given a million dollars and the chance to own Disney World. It was a bit scary thought because those laughs usually led to craziness and they really didn't want a crazy half shark, half boy to be driving a speed boat at a hundred miles per hour. No one knew how but Shark Boy stopped the boat and yelled, \"We're here!\" about what seemed like two hours later. \"That was quicker than I thought.\" slurred Marissa. She clapped her hand over her mouth and ran to the side of the boat. The sound of retching was heard over the waves that crashed over the rocks. Shark Boy raised an eyebrow. \"It's been over 13 hours.\" Linus swayed on his feet. \"How can that be?\" \"Well you guys passed out about a half hour into the ride,\" Shark Boy shrugged. \"That explains it,\" Lava Girl held on to the railing to keep from falling over. Shark Boy smirked. \"Wait a minute!\" Max said sitting against a wall. \"We where in the middle of Texas! How did you sail from there to here at all? There's barly anything to sail from.\" Shark Boy pointed a finger at Max. \"Never underestimate my sailing skills!\" Max held up his hands. \"Okay, okay!\" \"Guys?\" Marissa said coming back from the side of the boat. \"Where's Tom-Tom?\" \"Over here!\" someone called from the sand below. \"How did he get there so fast?\" Max asked. \"What did I say about underestimating people!\" yelled Shark Boy, throwing his hands up. \"I thought you only meant you !\" Max yelled \"It applies to everyone! OW!\" someone had burned Shark Boy on the shoulder. \"LG!\" Lava Girl stood there with a hand on fire. \"Knock it off you two! We have to find Magnetisa!\" \"Sorry,\" they apologized in unison. Shark Boy rubbed his burnt shoulder. Linus squinted at something in the air. \"Uh... Is that a helicopter?\" They all looked up as a shiny, blue helicopter landed on the beach right next to Tom-Tom. Lava Girl learns Japanese Everyone got down from the boat and walked over to the helicopter. The blades still spinning so their hair swirled around their faces. \"I got us a ride!\" Marissa yelled over the noise from the propellers. \"AWESOME!\" yelled Linus. A young japanese man stepped down from the helicopter. \"What's his name?\" asked Linus. \"I don't know. I just called a travel company and they gave me this guy,\" she responded. \"Do you know Japanese?\" Max called out. \"Uh... no.\" Marissa confessed. \"Don't worry I got it!\" Lava Girl strode over to the man and before he could say anything she grabbed his face and kissed him. The propellers slowed and quieted and everyone stared at them, especially Shark Boy. His chin was practically to the floor, and his ears turned so red that they started to burn more than his shoulder. Lava Girl pulled away from the pilot and started to speak in Japanese. \"Doko ni demo komikkukon o mi ta ka?(Have you seen a comic con anywhere?)\" she asked, in a very fluent Japanese. The young man swayed on his feet a bit and stared at Lava Girl. \"E, e e. Tokyo de wa one tsu o hosuto shite iru,(Eh, yeah. In Tokyo they're hosting one.),\" he said in a distant voice. \"Arigato. (Thank You.)\" she walked swiftly away from him and boarded the helicopter. The pilot paused for a second and then ran after her. \"Uh... Shark Boy?\" Max asked as Shark Boy stared at where Lava Girl had just been. He just stood there like a statue. \"C'mon,\" said Marissa. \"Let's carry him if he won't move.\" Linus nodded and grabbed Shark Boy's arm and Tom-Tom took the other. They heaved and lifted him of his feet. Slowly they walked across the sand and towards the helicopter. The propellers were spinning again and Lava Girl was in the last seat. Finally, Shark Boy snapped out of it and ran towards Lava Girl. He sat next to her and quickly strapped on his seat belt. \"LG?\" Shark Boy said loudly. \"What was that?\" Lava Girl looked over at Shark Boy and said. \"Haven't I told you? If I kiss someone I learn the language they speak.\" ( Anya: Thats from Teen Titans.) Shark Boy shook his head. \"No, you left that part out.\" Lava Girl shrugged but she knew that Shark Boy was growing jealous. \"Can you teach me Japanese?\" asked Shark Boy slyly. \"It only works with me,\" smirked Lava Girl. \"Oh,\" Shark Boy settled in his seat and scowled at the pilot. \"Wait a minute. How come you didn't burn his lips?\" asked Shark Boy. \"Our powers weaken on earth,\" said Lava Girl. \"Remember?\" \"Oh, right.\" Shark Boy went back to scowling as the helicopter slowly rose into the air and started flying towards Tokyo. \"Do you think I'll find her?\" asked Tom-Tom looking at Max. \"Of course we will,\" Max said patting Tom-Tom's shoulder. \"Hey guys,\" said Linus looking over at them. \"Won't people look at us funny if three of us are dressed like weirdos. No offense, Tom-Tom.\" \"Non-taken,\" Tom-Tom muttered. Marissa shook her head. \"Linus, we're going to a comic con. You, me and Max are the one's who will look out of place.\" \"Okay then, what will we wear?\" Marissa shrugged. \"We could buy some costumes,\" Max mused. Tim-Tim's Taxi Everyone got out of the helicopter and started walking toward the terminal. The pilot walked over to Lava Girl and tapped her shoulder. She turned around and he scratched his head. \"Er- Call me,\" he said with a Japanese accent. \"Er... sure,\" and she walked away quickly. Shark Boy looked over at the pilot and growled. The pilot stepped back in alarm. Lava Girl turned around and grabbed Shark Boy's arm before he could run at the pilot and rip his face off. \"Cool it, Sharky,\" she said. Shark Boy ripped his arm from her. \"Your powers may be weaker but that doesn't mean you don't still burn me!\" \"Sorry,\" she smiled and they continued toward the airport. When they were finally inside Max turned around said, \"Okay, this airport has to have some maps of Tokyo somewhere so let's all split up and-\" But Lava Girl was already talking to a woman in a uniform who was nodding and pointed to a Hello Kitty shop. Lava Girl walked over to the group and interrupted Max. \"That woman said that the guy at that store is a part time taxi driver. We just have to wait until he's available.\" Tom-Tom looked at the store angrily. \"We don't have time to wait. I need to find my sister now!\" And with that Tom-Tom stalked towards the store at full speed. He entered the plush, pink store with neon signs and talking Hello Kitty dolls. The man at the counter looked extremely bored. He was completely out of place with his blue, Legend of Zelda shirt and jeans. He was lazily reading information on game cheats on his laptop. It seemed like he belonged in a video game store not a Hello Kitty shop. His name tag read: My name is: Timmy. Timmy heard Tom-Tom enter and drawled, \"Hello, Hello. Welcome to the wonderful world of Kitty. Please explore the options we have at this fantastical store.\" He read off the que cards on his desk. He was obviously American by his accent. \"Yeah, yeah!\" rushed Tom-Tom. \"I heard you own a taxi. Is this true?\" He slammed his hands on the counter making Timmy jump back a bit. \"Uh... yeah. Actually I do. Tim-Tim taxi service, at your assistance,\" said Timmy pointing to himself proudly. \"Tim-Tim?\" Tom-Tom said taken aback. \"What's wrong with the name?\" asked Timmy raising both eyebrows. \"Well... my name's Tom-Tom,\" said Tom-Tom. \"That's copyright! You stole my company name!\" Timmy yelled standing up. \"No I didn't! I didn't even choose my name! Max- I mean my mom did,\" Tom-Tom lied. He couldn't say that he was created from a boy's dream. It would sound too silly. \"But forget about that!\" yelled Tom-Tom. \"I need you to take me and five other kids to a Comic Con. I have to save my sister from whoever kidnapped her.\" There was possibility that that sounded sillier than being created from a boy's dream. \"Alright! Calm down,\" Timmy lowered his head and muttered,\"name stealer.\" He looked back up and continued like he hadn't said anything. \"My shift will be over in ten minutes. Do you know exactly where you are going?\" \"Yeah, my friend has a map,\" Tom-Tom said pointing his thumb towards the exit. \"Ok, then go and get them. I'll just put my stuff in the taxi and wait for my co-worker, Jake, to take the next shift,\" Timmy said shutting down his laptop and closing it. Tom-Tom let out a sigh of relief, trying to calm himself and ran toward his friends. While Tom-Tom was in the store Shark Boy had bought them all some sushi from a nearby Sushi Bar. Nobody was eating but Shark Boy, though. It seemed that everyone was still to seasick from the boat ride to eat anything ocean-related. \"How's the fish you guys?\" asked Shark Boy. \"Uh...\" \"Well...\" \"It's...\" \"Hey, I got us a ride!\" said Tom-Tom when he stopped in front of them. \"That's wonderful!\" Marissa jumped up smiling. \"Yeah great!\" Max said throwing the fish behind him. They tried their best to avoid Shark Boy's question by paying attention to Tom-Tom. \"Ok, here's what we're gonna do,\" said Tom-Tom. \"Once we get there we split up to find Magnetisa. Max, you go with Marissa. Linus your with me on this one.\" \"No problem, buddy,\" Linus said clapping his hand on Tom-Tom's shoulder. \"Shark Boy your with Lava Girl,\" Tom-Tom concluded. \"Any questions?\" \"Yeah,\" said Marissa raising her hand. \"What about costumes? What are we supposed to wear?\" she gestured toward Max, Linus and herself. \"We'll find something for you guys to wear,\" Tom-Tom said. \"In fact I know exactly what you guys can use.\" Tom-Tom put on a mischievous little smile and looked at the hello kitty store. Pokemon, Kingdom Hearts and a Llama Timmy looked up from from his desk and saw six kids in front of him. \"Well I guess you weren't kidding,\" Timmy said, slightly impressed. \"Jake should be here any minute. Is there anything you guys need before we go?\" Tom-Tom nodded, \"Actually, yeah. We need some costumes for my three friends.\" Timmy looked at the three kids without costumes. He cocked his head and scratched his neck. Timmy snapped his fingers and smiled, \"I got just the thing. Come with me.\" They followed him into the back room and he flicked the light switch. The smell of coffee and popcorn reached their noses. Inside the little back office was a huge pile of video game consoles and even more video games, a small t.v., a computer, a popcorn machine and a whole bunch of empty Starbucks coffee cups. All the way in the far left corner was a small metal closet. Timmy stepped over the mess as he walked over to it. Tom-Tom picked up a box for one of the video games. \"Kingdom Hearts?\" Timmy turned his head to see it. He turned back around and waved his hand dismissively. \"Yeah, I used to love that game. Really awesome, too.\" Tom-Tom looked at the box sadly, \"Do you still play it?\" \"Naw, I finished it years ago. I've played it a couple times more after I won the game and beat my score. I don't think I can beat it anymore, though,\" Timmy opened the closet and took out a green sock. He sniffed it and winced. \"My score is higher that most video game champions out there.\" Timmy looked the sock over once more then threw it back into the closet. \"Why do you ask?\" \"My sister, Magnetisa wanted to play this game really badly. I was going to get it for her birthday,\" said Tom-Tom forlornly. Timmy turned around and eyed Tom-Tom pitifully. He scratched the back of his neck and looked over at the video game in his hands. \"Er... well, I haven't played it in, like, forever so-\" Timmy moved his hand from his neck to his stubby beard. \"You can have it you want.\" Tom-Tom looked up and gave a half-smile. \"Really?\" Timmy turned back to shuffling things around in the closet and shrugged. \"Sure, no problem.\" Tom-Tom removed a large gum-ball from one of his over sized pockets and stuffed the game case inside. Tom-Tom placed the gum on the cluttered desk. \"Alright! I found them!\" Timmy stepped back from the closet holding two colorful outfits and one plain tan one. \"These are from my old jobs. My bosses let me keep them 'cause... well... I wasn't exactly the cleanest employee.\" Timmy stepped over the mess on the floor once more to get to them. \"Please ignore the food stains and the smell of road kill. Oh, and the frequent scent of baby poop.\" Marissa sneezed into her shirt. There was a mumbling of \"Bless yous,\" all over the room. Timmy handed her a pink and white outfit and said, \"I guess you should get the cleanest one. I haven't worn it because it's for my current job. My bosses realized that I'm not a girl so they allowed me to wear regular clothes.\" Marissa looked at the costume that was handed to her. It was non-other than a Hello Kitty suit, sparkles and all. Linus looked curiously at the tan costume still in Timmy's hand. \"What's the furry one?\" \"Oh, this is kind of a random one,\" he said turning the costume around to show a Llama head attached to a furry body and hooves at the end of long sleeves. \"This is from a really old job. I used to work at Taco Llama until I got fired for eating the merchandise.\" Timmy handed it to Linus. \"You can wear it.\" Linus took it reluctantly. \"Gee, thanks.\" \"And you can have this one,\" Timmy handed the last costume to Max. It was yellow and fluffy with black lightning shaped stripes. Max twirled the hanger to get a better view of the costume. It showed a little hood with zigzag shaped ears. \"Pikachu?\" asked Max looking up curiously. \"Don't ask,\" muttered Timmy. They walked out of the back room and to the front of the counter once more. Before Max could ask for any more explanation, Marissa asked where they would get dressed. \"Uh...\" Timmy said looking around for somewhere they could change. \"There's a bathroom next to a coffee shop near here. Just past the Burger King,\" he pointed at the blue doors next to the burger joint. \"Meet me at the front of the airport. I'm going to go get my cab.\" Timmy hastily walked of the store and then back in. \"I forgot that I had to wait for Jake.\" As if on cue a man with a tan and cropped hair ran in. \"Sorry, man I got into a fight with a dog.\" \"Again Jake?\" Timmy shook his head. \"Seriously you have got to take a break from being with that pack of yours.\" \"I tried to when I moved to Japan,\" Jake said throwing his arms up. Timmy put his hands up apologetically. \"All right, all right. I gotta go,\" he turned over to the kids who were watching the conversation with puzzled faces. \"See you at the entrance,\" he waved awkwardly as he ran out. Unexpected Timmy's taxi was clean and smelled new and there was a good reason for that: No one wanted to use his taxi service. Why? Because he drove the car like Shark Boy drove the boat. Shark Boy seemed to be the only one enjoying the ride, too. He sat up front with Timmy and stuck his head out of the roof window like he was a dog. The radio was almost at the maximum volume. It was playing Traveling by Utada Hikaru, an upbeat electronic disco type of song. \"Woohooo!\" he yelled at the top of his lungs when the cab swerved around a corner. The wind rushing so quickly that you could feel the gust from the back seat of the cab. Timmy was nodding his head to the beat of the song and singing along. His fingers tapped the steering wheel despite how fast he was turning it. Everyone else held on to there seat belts and were grasping the bottom of their chairs like they were holding on for their lives. As the taxi turned to a busy street Timmy slowed down and Funky Town came up on the radio. Suddenly everyone took notice to how neon that part of Japan was. There were hundreds of stores and millions of people. Hi-tech gadget shops, clothing stores, comic book stores, restaurants and... comic cons! There at the end of the block was a huge comic con with large green glowing lettering. It was called Comic Convention Center. That had to be where Magnetisa was. Tom-Tom was aggravated by how long it took them to find a parking space. They had to go around the building and into an empty alley. \"Do you guys want me to stay in the cab or can I come with you?\" Timmy asked. \"You can come if you'd like,\" Marissa said politely. Timmy looked around and rubbed his chin. \"Well, why not? And you guys do have to pay me.\" \"Shoot, I thought he forgot about that!\" muttered Linus. Tom-Tom patted his pocket. \"I don't have any Japanese money on me.\" Timmy shrugged, \"That's okay there's a currency exchange inside.\" \"How do you know that?\" Lava Girl asked as they started to walk back to the front of the building. \"I used to work here, too,\" Timmy said sheepishly. \"That's where the Picachu outfit came from,\" he scratched the back of his neck uncomfortably. \"Are you guys okay in those costumes? They look pretty big.\" Linus pulled up one of his sleeves. \"Uh, I guess I can survive but seriously man who can work in this thing?\" \"I asked the same thing before I go fired,\" Timmy said opening the door for everyone. There was a cold gust of air and the sound of thousands of people talking and laughing hit there ears like a rolled up news paper. \"She has to be here,\" said Tom-Tom looking up at the escalators that headed upstairs. Then suddenly everyone became quiet and there was a blood curdling scream, and the floor beneath them exploded! DUN DUN DUN! What will happen next? Find out in chapter 2 of this episode![Chapter 7] Sorry! I've left you all on such a huge cliffhanger but I'm back! This is the Shark Boy and Lava Girl Season Finale! Thanks again to all my readers and reviewers. You know who you are. :) School's back :^( So I'm going to finish what I started a long time ago. Also I've created a new account called Raven Quill Dipped In Ink. It's for my longer, epic, scary and romance stories. If you want, go check out my profile and subscribe to me because I'll be writing some cool stories there... I hope. I'll still be writing as Anya365 but shorter and more adventure/ humor stories. I do not own Shark Boy and Lava Girl, just my OC's. (For those who don't know, OC means original character.) Previously; \"She has to be here,' said Tom-Tom looking up at the escalators that headed upstairs. Then suddenly everyone became quiet and there was a blood curdling scream, and the floor beneath them exploded! Lost and Found They were all thrown back by the explosion. Shark-Boy opened his eyes as he felt a simmering heat above him. He realized that Lava Girl had landed on top of him. They were nose to nose. \"Uh,\" stammered Shark Boy. \"Heh, sorry,\" she quickly scooted off of him leaving them both with racing hearts. Marissa had been hit on the head by a tile from the floor and was out cold. Max ran to her limp body and sat her up against him. He shook her by the shoulder as he called her name over and over. Shark Boy shook off what just happened to help Max wake Marissa up. Lava Girl stood up and walked over to the huge hole in the floor and looked into it. Smoke billowed from the gaping abyss. People where starting to clear out of the building and sirens were ringing. Lava Girl turned around and shouted, \"Where's Tom- Tom?\" Linus stood up, his hair singed and messy. He looked up and pointed to the ceiling. \"I have a better question...\" They all followed Linus' finger. On the roof was a whole of about the same size as the one on the floor. Tom-Tom came out of the crevice on the floor coughing. \"No one's down there,\" he said as he coughed more dust and small pieces of debris out of his mouth. Timmy was shaking behind a concession stand. \"I-I think that w-whoever t-that w-was saw u-us c-coming.\" Lava Girl nodded looking back up at the ceiling. \"And they got out as fast as they could.\" \"With Magnetisa...\" muttered Tom-Tom walking over to the front door. \"Hey, where are you going?\" Shark Boy yelled getting up. \"Home... We'll never find her now...\" Tom- Tom stopped at the entrance when he heard Lava Girl walk over to him. She stopped a couple feet away and furrowed her eyebrows. \"We can't give up now!\" she said in her heroic and stubborn voice. \"We can-\" \"Look at us!\" Tom-Tom yelled cutting her off. He whirled around as he said this, startling her. \"Look at us!\" he repeated more forcefully this time. \"We're in Japan ! You guy's are dressed like weirdos! We're just a bunch of kids dressed up in costumes with half of our powers! We've come all this way to some Comic Con just to come back to square one!\" He closed his eyes and breathed in jaggedly. \"I'm going home.\" He turned back around just to feel a rough hand on his shoulder. He looked up to see Timmy, who seemed to have a new burst of confidence. \"Oh no your not!\" he said in a strange tone that seemed rare to him. He sounded more mature, more like a parent than a part-time taxi driver who worked in a Hello Kitty store. \"I have no idea what you meant by powers but you have to help your sister! I don't know what's going on, but I'm going to help you guys.\" He smirked, \"Besides I haven't had this much fun in years.\" \"But you were cowering behind a candy stand...\" mumbled Linus but Timmy paid him no attention. Tom-Tom sighed, \"Even if you help us, how are we going to find her?\" Shark Boy cocked his head at the crater \"Let's search down there together. Maybe there's something in there that will give up a clue.\" Tom-Tom shook his head. \"I checked.\" \"You guys...\" said Max in a low haunting voice. \"Marissa's not waking up.\" Marissa's head was laying on Max' shoulder with her eyes closed. She looked even colder than she did on Planet Drool. They all looked over at her. Another complication... that was something they did not need. Timmy lost his confidence and his shoulders slumped. Finally, Lava Girl sat down on the floor and put her hands on her face. \"What do we do now...\" \"I can't believe you guys are giving up on me. Am I not loved?\" said a familiar cocky voice from the doorway leading to the food court. Tom-Tom gasped and turned his head to the girl with blond pigtails and a yellow suit with magnets attached to it. \"Magnetisa!\" her friends called out as she chuckled. \"Miss me?\" Magnetisa She smirked as she walked to them with her arms crossed. She put her hands on her hips and stuck her head forward, \"What? Your looking at me like I'm a ghost.\" Tom-Tom blinked. \"M- Maggie?\" \"No, it's the easter bunny.\" He ran up to her and gave her a hug. She smiled and hugged him back, \"I missed you too, brother.\" \"W- we've looked everywhere for you!\" stammered Tom- Tom. \"I can see that,\" she looked over his shoulder to find her friends battered and bruised. She gasped at the sight of Marrissa. Max was no longer looking at her. His head hung low and tears were falling from his face. \"Move over!\" Magnetisa said running over to Marrissa. She got on her knees as everyone stared at her. Magnetisa stuck her hands out in front of her and let out a long breath. Then she took in a sudden gulp of air and pressed her hands on Marrissa's chest. The sound of static filled the area and Marrissa started to glow. \"Holy...\" whispered Timmy, who had taken a step back in astonishment. Magnetisa's face was contorted with concentration. \"C'mon, Princess. C'mon, wake up,\" she muttered as the glow around Marrissa turned from yellow to orange to red. Then the glow dimmed. Magnetisa dropped her hands down to her sides and panted with the exhaustion. Max lifted his head up only to put it back down in disappointment. Marrissa hadn't even flinched. Then there was a voice. \"M-Max?\" Marrissa mumbled turning his head to him. Max's head shot up. His eyes were as wide as bowling balls. Magnetisa gasped in delight. Marrissa turned to her and and sat up slowly. She squinted as if she couldn't see properly. \"Magnetisa?\" Maggie smiled. \"The one and only.\" Lava Girl smiled, Shark Boy's jaw touched the floor, Timmy looked like he was about to faint, and Tom-Tom looked a combination of the three. Marrissa sighed in relief. \"We found you?\" Magnetisa laughed shakily. \"Well, I found you.\" \"Good,\" she said a bit dumbly. She leaned against Max's shoulder. He gave her a hug and she smiled sleepily. \"Okay,\" sighed Magnetisa. She stood back on her feet. \"Let's get out of here. I have a lot to tell you.\" Cats and Dragons. Magnetisa spent the whole taxi trip talking about how she was captured. \"It wasn't Mr. Electric who took me,\" she explained. \"It was some sort dragon thing.\" She moved her arms in exaggerated movements as she described the creature. She cringed slightly when she spoke of it's large reptilian head and how it's sharp wicked teeth were just inches from her face... \"And you will never believe who was with that thing,\" she said. She was starting to get more excited in telling the story. \"Who?\" asked Max. She grimaced. \"It was-.\" They all gasped. \"Frost!\" She eyed them with a puzzled expression. \"How did you all guess?\" \"No!\" shouted Shark Boy. \"Frost!\" Just as he said this a giant snowball hurled toward the taxi. Timmy swerved as quickly as he could, nearly hitting a silver Volvo in the process ( a/n: Excuse the Twilight pun ;) ). Ahead, four giant pyramids of ice shot up into the sky from the road. The cars beeped and turned jaggedly to avoid the ice. Timmy stopped altogether before a fifth one shish - kebabbed the cab. \"What the-\" but whether he ended that with a derogatory word or not was unknown for the cab let out an earsplitting screech as it curved sharply. \"Everyone out of the car!\" Timmy yelled quickly unbuckling his seat-belt with fumbling hands. They all followed suit and hopped out of the car as another snowball plowed through the cab, just where thy had been sitting five seconds ago. Timmy grabbed the still uncoordinated Marrissa and ran out somewhere behind the giant icicles sticking out of the road. Shark Boy was the first to see the feline's head sticking out of the sunroof of an SUV. Some man with a sunglasses was driving and his mouth gaped slightly as if being hypnotized. \"Ah, man,\" Linus muttered under his breath as the car swerved in front of them and cat on a hypnotized man's shoulders opened the door roughly and stepped out. He walked up to them with his hands held a bit to casually behind his back. \"So good to see all of you again,\" Frost said in a mocking tone. \"Like-wise,\" Lava Girl replied scathingly. \"What do you want Frost?\" shouted Max. \"To win. Duh.\" Frost turned around and gestured to the blue SUV behind him. \"My new master sits in that car waiting to be called out. When he does, it's not going to be pretty.\" He turned back to them and smirked with his kitty face. He turned his head from side to side. \"Where's the Ice Princess?\" Max clenched his fists. \"She's busy at the moment.\" \"Darn. I so wanted to have her watch my revenge.\" He waved his hand, dismissing the thought like a pesky fly in the air. \"Ah well, we'll just have to do without her.\" Then his eyes caught Magnetisa. \"You! So this is where you went!\" Magnetisa said nothing. She simply stuck her tongue out. Linus laughed and she smiled in his direction. Frost scowled and took a step forward. \"Ice cream,\" he muttered under his breath. Magnetisa raised an eyebrow. \"What?\" Suddenly the SUV rattled and the front door opened. A man in a black suit stepped out. \"Hi.. My name's Keith.\" Keith Linus was the first one to start laughing. Then everyone else joined the chorus of laughter. Even Magnetisa. Keith frowned and raised his eyebrows. \"What? Did I forget to wear pants?\" \"You- Your the ultimate bad guy we've been expecting?\" Shark Boy guffawed, holding on to his stomach. Keith blinked then narrowed his eyes. \"Yes.\" They continued to laugh but stopped suddenly when Keith boomed, \"SILENCE!\" He took an angry step forward and talked angrily through yellow bucked teeth. \"Once again i am underestimated! The last time I said my name a whole police department broke into laughter. It's probably not wise to say what happened to them in front of children who still watch Sesame Street.\" Linus stepped forward as well and yelled, \"Hey! I only watch Sesame Street on Tuesday mornings!\" Frost looked at him with a perplexed look and everyone else followed. Keith coughed. \"I don't even want to know...\" He shook his head and looked up angrily again. \"Fools! You think you can both distract me and underestimate me!\" \"We were sort of hoping,\" shrugged Magnetisa. Keith looked at her angrily. \"And how? Do you know what I can do?\" Before anyone could reply he have a large tremor. Something crawled up his skin like a wide snake. His skin turned to scales and he grew longer and longer until he was larger than the car. Keith turned into a giant dragon... He took in a deep breath and let it out. Fire shot out. Every one scattered except for the one person who was immune. Lava Girl. She stood her ground until he stopped blasting fire. He looked at her with confusion. That was his mistake. He shouldn't have hesitated. While he was holding still Shark Boy got behind him and bit his tail. \"Aggggghhhhh!\" he cried. Keith swiped his tail to try to shake him but to no avail. He wasn't going to let go. Lava Girl used his distraction to hurl lava at his face. He clawed at her and she fell backwards onto the icy ground. Linus and Tom-Tom hopped onto a flying candy bar and started to throw random candy at Keith. Keith batted the things away but still missed. Magnetisa was shorting out light bulbs and electrifying Keith. He was strong but he couldn't handle them all. Frost on the other hand was looking around the ice pyramids for Marrissa. After much fighting Frost came back with a broken nose and fell to the ground. Out of the ice came Marrissa and Timmy. Keith swayed dangerously and then fell, square on his jaw, to the floor. His golden eyes dimmed and closed. Everyone fell back as they noticed the wreckage they created. \"Did we just win?\" asked Linus. \"I think so...\" said Magnetisa. \"Ugh,\" Timmy fell to the floor, obviously unconcious. \"We'd better get him back,\" muttered Linus. After the fight After the fight everyone cleaned up as best they could. They took Timmy back to the airport. And finally they all went home. Lava Girl planned a campout in front of her home and they all went just as the sun was setting. \"Well, this was fun,\" laughed Marrissa, who was feeling better now. \"Yeah,\" smiled Max. \"Ugh, will you two just kiss already. It's not even funny how obvious it is that you guys like each other,\" Linus rolled his eyes. Max and Marrissa blushed but looking at each other, they finally kissed. \"Ha ha ha, I knew it,\" chuckled Shark Boy. \"You guys, too,\" Linus said raising his eyebrows. \"I'm surprised that you guys aren't going out yet.\" Shark Boy looked dumbstruck but Lava Girl smiled grabbing his colar and pulling him toward her. Linus smirked then frowned slowly as he realized Magnetisa staring at him. He turned around and his eyes widened as she grabbed his face and pulled him to her as well. Tom- Tom sighed. \"I gotta get a girlfriend.\" They all laughed at his statement and went on with conversation until late into the night. Everything was right again. THE END. YES! I'm done! WHOOOHOOOO! Ahem... sorry. I was all happy and stuff... well I hope you liked the season finale. Special thanks to all my reviewers! You guys rock! Everyone who gave me ideas (you know who you are) thanks! And as they say... FIN.","LastChapter":"Sorry! I've left you all on such a huge cliffhanger but I'm back!

Tom-Tom sighed, \"Even if you help us, how are we going to find her?\" Shark Boy cocked his head at the crater \"Let's search down there together. Maybe there's something in there that will give up a clue.\" Tom-Tom shook his head. \"I checked.\" \"You guys...\" said Max in a low haunting voice. \"Marissa's not waking up.\" Marissa's head was laying on Max' shoulder with her eyes closed. She looked even colder than she did on Planet Drool. They all looked over at her. Another complication... that was something they did not need. Timmy lost his confidence and his shoulders slumped. Finally, Lava Girl sat down on the floor and put her hands on her face. \"What do we do now...\" \"I can't believe you guys are giving up on me. Am I not loved?\" said a familiar cocky voice from the doorway leading to the food court. Tom-Tom gasped and turned his head to the girl with blond pigtails and a yellow suit with magnets attached to it. \"Magnetisa!\" her friends called out as she chuckled. \"Miss me?\" Magnetisa She smirked as she walked to them with her arms crossed. She put her hands on her hips and stuck her head forward, \"What? Your looking at me like I'm a ghost.\" Tom-Tom blinked. \"M- Maggie?\" \"No, it's the easter bunny.\" He ran up to her and gave her a hug. She smiled and hugged him back, \"I missed you too, brother.\" \"W- we've looked everywhere for you!\" stammered Tom- Tom. \"I can see that,\" she looked over his shoulder to find her friends battered and bruised. She gasped at the sight of Marrissa. Max was no longer looking at her. His head hung low and tears were falling from his face. \"Move over!\" Magnetisa said running over to Marrissa. She got on her knees as everyone stared at her. Magnetisa stuck her hands out in front of her and let out a long breath. Then she took in a sudden gulp of air and pressed her hands on Marrissa's chest. The sound of static filled the area and Marrissa started to glow. \"Holy...\" whispered Timmy, who had taken a step back in astonishment. Magnetisa's face was contorted with concentration. \"C'mon, Princess. C'mon, wake up,\" she muttered as the glow around Marrissa turned from yellow to orange to red. Then the glow dimmed. Magnetisa dropped her hands down to her sides and panted with the exhaustion. Max lifted his head up only to put it back down in disappointment. Marrissa hadn't even flinched. Then there was a voice. \"M-Max?\" Marrissa mumbled turning his head to him. Max's head shot up. His eyes were as wide as bowling balls. Magnetisa gasped in delight. Marrissa turned to her and and sat up slowly. She squinted as if she couldn't see properly. \"Magnetisa?\" Maggie smiled. \"The one and only.\" Lava Girl smiled, Shark Boy's jaw touched the floor, Timmy looked like he was about to faint, and Tom-Tom looked a combination of the three. Marrissa sighed in relief. \"We found you?\" Magnetisa laughed shakily. \"Well, I found you.\" \"Good,\" she said a bit dumbly. She leaned against Max's shoulder. He gave her a hug and she smiled sleepily. \"Okay,\" sighed Magnetisa. She stood back on her feet. \"Let's get out of here. I have a lot to tell you.\" Cats and Dragons. Magnetisa spent the whole taxi trip talking about how she was captured. \"It wasn't Mr. Electric who took me,\" she explained. \"It was some sort dragon thing.\" She moved her arms in exaggerated movements as she described the creature. She cringed slightly when she spoke of it's large reptilian head and how it's sharp wicked teeth were just inches from her face... \"And you will never believe who was with that thing,\" she said. She was starting to get more excited in telling the story. \"Who?\" asked Max. She grimaced. \"It was-.\" They all gasped. \"Frost!\" She eyed them with a puzzled expression. \"How did you all guess?\" \"No!\" shouted Shark Boy. \"Frost!\" Just as he said this a giant snowball hurled toward the taxi. Timmy swerved as quickly as he could, nearly hitting a silver Volvo in the process ( a/n: Excuse the Twilight pun ;) ). Ahead, four giant pyramids of ice shot up into the sky from the road. The cars beeped and turned jaggedly to avoid the ice. Timmy stopped altogether before a fifth one shish - kebabbed the cab. \"What the-\" but whether he ended that with a derogatory word or not was unknown for the cab let out an earsplitting screech as it curved sharply. \"Everyone out of the car!\" Timmy yelled quickly unbuckling his seat-belt with fumbling hands. They all followed suit and hopped out of the car as another snowball plowed through the cab, just where thy had been sitting five seconds ago. Timmy grabbed the still uncoordinated Marrissa and ran out somewhere behind the giant icicles sticking out of the road. Shark Boy was the first to see the feline's head sticking out of the sunroof of an SUV. Some man with a sunglasses was driving and his mouth gaped slightly as if being hypnotized. \"Ah, man,\" Linus muttered under his breath as the car swerved in front of them and cat on a hypnotized man's shoulders opened the door roughly and stepped out. He walked up to them with his hands held a bit to casually behind his back. \"So good to see all of you again,\" Frost said in a mocking tone. \"Like-wise,\" Lava Girl replied scathingly. \"What do you want Frost?\" shouted Max. \"To win. Duh.\" Frost turned around and gestured to the blue SUV behind him. \"My new master sits in that car waiting to be called out. When he does, it's not going to be pretty.\" He turned back to them and smirked with his kitty face. He turned his head from side to side. \"Where's the Ice Princess?\" Max clenched his fists. \"She's busy at the moment.\" \"Darn. I so wanted to have her watch my revenge.\" He waved his hand, dismissing the thought like a pesky fly in the air. \"Ah well, we'll just have to do without her.\" Then his eyes caught Magnetisa. \"You! So this is where you went!\" Magnetisa said nothing. She simply stuck her tongue out. Linus laughed and she smiled in his direction. Frost scowled and took a step forward. \"Ice cream,\" he muttered under his breath. Magnetisa raised an eyebrow. \"What?\" Suddenly the SUV rattled and the front door opened. A man in a black suit stepped out. \"Hi.. My name's Keith.\" Keith Linus was the first one to start laughing. Then everyone else joined the chorus of laughter. Even Magnetisa. Keith frowned and raised his eyebrows. \"What? Did I forget to wear pants?\" \"You- Your the ultimate bad guy we've been expecting?\" Shark Boy guffawed, holding on to his stomach. Keith blinked then narrowed his eyes. \"Yes.\" They continued to laugh but stopped suddenly when Keith boomed, \"SILENCE!\" He took an angry step forward and talked angrily through yellow bucked teeth. \"Once again i am underestimated! The last time I said my name a whole police department broke into laughter. It's probably not wise to say what happened to them in front of children who still watch Sesame Street.\" Linus stepped forward as well and yelled, \"Hey! I only watch Sesame Street on Tuesday mornings!\" Frost looked at him with a perplexed look and everyone else followed. Keith coughed. \"I don't even want to know...\" He shook his head and looked up angrily again. \"Fools! You think you can both distract me and underestimate me!\" \"We were sort of hoping,\" shrugged Magnetisa. Keith looked at her angrily. \"And how? Do you know what I can do?\" Before anyone could reply he have a large tremor. Something crawled up his skin like a wide snake. His skin turned to scales and he grew longer and longer until he was larger than the car. Keith turned into a giant dragon... He took in a deep breath and let it out. Fire shot out. Every one scattered except for the one person who was immune. Lava Girl. She stood her ground until he stopped blasting fire. He looked at her with confusion. That was his mistake. He shouldn't have hesitated. While he was holding still Shark Boy got behind him and bit his tail. \"Aggggghhhhh!\" he cried. Keith swiped his tail to try to shake him but to no avail. He wasn't going to let go. Lava Girl used his distraction to hurl lava at his face. He clawed at her and she fell backwards onto the icy ground. Linus and Tom-Tom hopped onto a flying candy bar and started to throw random candy at Keith. Keith batted the things away but still missed. Magnetisa was shorting out light bulbs and electrifying Keith. He was strong but he couldn't handle them all. Frost on the other hand was looking around the ice pyramids for Marrissa. After much fighting Frost came back with a broken nose and fell to the ground. Out of the ice came Marrissa and Timmy. Keith swayed dangerously and then fell, square on his jaw, to the floor. His golden eyes dimmed and closed. Everyone fell back as they noticed the wreckage they created. \"Did we just win?\" asked Linus. \"I think so...\" said Magnetisa. \"Ugh,\" Timmy fell to the floor, obviously unconcious. \"We'd better get him back,\" muttered Linus. After the fight After the fight everyone cleaned up as best they could. They took Timmy back to the airport. And finally they all went home. Lava Girl planned a campout in front of her home and they all went just as the sun was setting. \"Well, this was fun,\" laughed Marrissa, who was feeling better now. \"Yeah,\" smiled Max. \"Ugh, will you two just kiss already. It's not even funny how obvious it is that you guys like each other,\" Linus rolled his eyes. Max and Marrissa blushed but looking at each other, they finally kissed. \"Ha ha ha, I knew it,\" chuckled Shark Boy. \"You guys, too,\" Linus said raising his eyebrows. \"I'm surprised that you guys aren't going out yet.\" Shark Boy looked dumbstruck but Lava Girl smiled grabbing his colar and pulling him toward her. Linus smirked then frowned slowly as he realized Magnetisa staring at him. He turned around and his eyes widened as she grabbed his face and pulled him to her as well. Tom- Tom sighed. \"I gotta get a girlfriend.\" They all laughed at his statement and went on with conversation until late into the night. Everything was right again. THE END. YES! I'm done! WHOOOHOOOO! Ahem... sorry. I was all happy and stuff... well I hope you liked the season finale. Special thanks to all my reviewers! You guys rock! Everyone who gave me ideas (you know who you are) thanks! And as they say... FIN.","Summary":" I loved the movie Shark Boy and Lava Girl from the first time I saw it.

The side of Planet drool she was on was always in darkness, probably because this was the side where it was kept until time to let it out. But it must always be balanced not too much light not too much darkness a perfect medium She let the darkness out when it was needed; all living things had to rest and under a strong light would never bring peaceful sleep and sweet dreams to the inhabitants of Drool. She sighed placing her head in her hands, she longed to go into the side of Drool where there was light but if she left her post that would give the darkness a chance to get free and then it would slowly kill the planet if it wasn't put back in its place quickly. She lay back looking at the sky, she wasn't always a guardian of the darkness she shuddered lightly when she thought of how she came to be. She was not dreamt up like the heroic duo of Sharkboy and Lavagirl when she was thought of..she was a nightmare. Yes Max dreamt her up but she was a nightmare that is why she has such a dark appearance, red eyes, black hair, a long sword-the things of nightmares. She sat up quickly as she felt a movement behind her, she jumped up and turned holding her sword in a defensive position \"W-Who is it?\" she called into the darkness. No one answered her as she crept forward she suddenly felt a sharp pain in her upper back and shoulder area and that was the last thing she felt as she passed out on the ground sword still clutched tightly in her hands. Mr. Electric stood behind her laughing darkly \"Step one is complete\" he said to the holographic face that suddenly appeared to him as he picked the Shadow up with one of his claws. \"Good now get her locked up and get to work on part two\" the face said before it disappeared. After making it back to his lair Mr. Electric slung Shadow into a cage and she woke up instantly as she hit the cold metal bars \"W-whats going on\" she said disoriented and rubbing her head. \"Don't worry about it princess\" Mr. Electric smirked and Shadow suddenly realized she wasn't at her post \"no..\" she said quietly quickly moving to the bars closest to Mr. Electric's computer \"NO\" she yelled once she realized what was happening, it was starting already the darkness was spreading already she stared wide-eyed as it all unfolded in front of her. \"Haha darkness now that's what I like to see darkness all this light was starting to annoy me\" he sighed contentedly. \"No you don't know what y-y-you're doing your going to k-k-kill this planet, you're g-g-going to destroy our home\" Shadow sighed closing her eyes, she always stuttered when she was nervous or anxious. \"What you should do is work on that little stuttering problem and then you can think of how you're going to spend your last days on Drool\" he smiled evilly. Shadow sighed and slumped against the bars on the cage glaring at Mr. Electric all of a sudden she jumped as she heard him growl angrily \"Not those two again\" she looked at his screen and saw he was talking about Sharkboy and Lavagirl, she had always heard about them but she never saw them before all she knew is that they were Max's dream after her and they were superheroes. He growled as he yelled thru the loudspeaker \" GET BACK IN YOUR SEATS EVERYONE GET BACK IN YOUR SEATS \" but the children paid no mind and ran as far away from the fun coaster as they could possibly go. \" FUN HAS BEGUN \" he yelled again watching them bored the coaster now she saw one of them onboard was her creator. She sighed he'll be able to stop this madness she thought happy about the prospect of this being over. Shadow watched as they stopped Sharkboy and Lavagirl jumped off well flipped off in Sharkboy's case and Max climbed all walked up to Mr. Electric maybe max will recognize me she thought hopeful he would. Mr. Electric looked at them all \"Sharkboy and Lavagirl what do you think you're doing halting my endless fun coasters and infiltrating my lair\" She saw Max's eyes flicker to her and she held his gaze hoping he would say something to her but instead she was hurt to see when he had to try to suppress a shiver when he looked into her blood red eyes. She sank back against the bars holding her head down avoiding any attempts to look at them again.[Chapter 2] Shadow was too consumed in her own grief to hear the conversation between Mr. Electric and the others only when she heard the crackle of the plugs she looked up and by chance the first person she laid eyes on was Sharkboy. She was impressed with his fighting style unlike Lavagirl as she observed he was more of a hands-on person. Only soon enough all the plugs were gone and they landed in front of Mr. Electric. Shadow saw them try to get Max to fight why isn't he doing anything…he knows what to do…doesn't he? She thought anticipating her creator would defeat Mr. Electric and let her out of this cage so she could go back to her somewhat miserable life out of everyone's way. Unfortunately he just whispered to Lavagirl asking what he was supposed to do. Shadow saw Sharkboy give an exasperated sigh \"I told you this would happen\" \"I thought he would just remember\" \"Remember what?\" she gasped How did he forget…would that mean … He doesn't remember me she thought despairingly looking up when Mr. Electric addressed her \"Well it looks as if y-y-you're going to have company in the dream graveyard\" he smirked mocking Shadow once again. She growled at him before the bottom of her cage disappeared and she dropped down and fell out on the passage of time just like the rest heated floors? She thought when she landed on something warm or rather somebody \".me\" whoever she landed on growled. Shadow jumped up quickly \"Oh I'm sorry\" she said quietly, he just got up and brushed himself off. Lavagirl looked at her \"So what's your name?\" she smiled \"S-Shadow\" she said silently cursing herself for stuttering, she looked at her thru kind eyes though \"That's a nice name, well I'm Lavagirl, this is Max and that's Sharkboy\" she smiled wider(if that was possible) pointing to herself, Max and Sharkboy. Max just looked at her and waved and she noticed Sharkboy and Max were both focused on the same thing, your sword. She looked at them and then back down at her sword in its holster by her side \"Oh…I'm a guardian of sorts\" she said not wanting them to blame her for the darkness spreading. \"What type of guardian?\" Sharkboy said with his eyes narrowed, she looked down at her feet \"I…\" right then Sharkboy grabbed her arm pulling her down do the floor along with the others \"Cuckoo!\" yelled the bird that appeared above them. \"You were saying?\" he was looking at you he was the only one talking to you as Lavagirl was trying to figure a way for them all to stop the dreams from being destroyed or at least get to the dream lair and stop the darkness \"I was put in charge of the darkness…but as you can see I'm pretty much failing at that\" she said quietly he looked like he was about to say something but in a flash Shadow had drawn her sword and cut down another bird from one of the clocks that was about to hit him. He looked at her surprised \"I was told to look out for others It's in my nature\" she said simply, \"You just don't seem like the type\" he said skeptically \"Well...\" she started and just then the platform they were on rolled over the edge and they all landed in the dirt and dust of the dream graveyard. Shadow tried sitting up but felt a weight on her chest and opened her eyes only to find herself nose to nose with Sharkboy he looked at her a slight blush spreading across his face \"sorry\" he muttered embarrassed, she blushed trying to wiggle out from under him when she felt yet another weight added to the pile \"Ow! I think you broke my fin\" he said like he was in pain Max jumped up quickly \"sorry\" Sharkboy turned his head slowly growling at Max \"Umm…Sharky I'm sure Shadow doesn't want you laying on her\" Lavagirl giggled when she saw her friend blush noticeably and spring up \"Sorry\" he muttered again. \"It's ok\" she said getting up and dusting herself off. As they all set off across the dreary landscape Shadow looked around at all the things there if I didn't have a purpose the I would be just like these poor souls she thought looking at some of the dust covered objects, \"We'll never find our way out of this graveyard\" Lavagirl said looking around \"Darkness! Headed this way\" Sharkboy said pointing in the direction of the thunder.[Chapter 3] ^-^ Thank you for the reviews on this story, and yes I am going to be adding a new chapter soon. Lol I hadn't finished it because I thought nobody was reading it. Sharkboy: o.o hey wait you we're going to leave us hanging like that? Me: Well…..kinda..sorta…maybe Lavagirl: ^-^ cheer up sharky she said she's updating that's better than nothing Me: exactly listen to the smart girl Sharkboy: -_- But yup I shall be updating ^-^ and I wanna thank DarkFireAngel00 own-girl-own-world for commenting it was very much appreciated ^-^[Chapter 4] \"Hey! I see you hiding! Come back here!\" Mr. Electric laughed keeping the boy on his screen from lying down a getting a peaceful nap. \"I WAS AWAKENED\" barked the holographic face that appeared behind Mr. Electric. \"Sorry\" Mr. Electric said nervously \"Did all the children from Mt. Never-rest escape?\" the voice demanded \"It was Sharkboy and Lavagirl but I took care of it see?\" Mr. Electric replied carefully \"Someone was with them?\" the voice all but shouted at the plug-man Just another child afraid of his own shadow no threat to us, I banished them to the dream graveyard\" Mr. Electric said, pleased with himself. \"WHERE OLD DREAMS LIE, HE COULD FIND AN ALLY AND WHERE IS THAT GIRL I HAD YOU CAPTURE EARLIER?\" the voice yelled \"I TOLD YOU EVERY DREAM MUST BE SMASHED AND EVERY CHILD CAPTURED!\" \"If you want him back I'll just track him when he falls asleep, and as for her I-I-I don't think it'll be hard to catch her again\" Mr. Electric smirked. \"Fool! He's the day-dreamer the moment he realizes his powers will be the moment of our doom.\" the voice roared. \"Well what do you want me to do?\" Mr. Electric said slightly crestfallen \"Find the boy and bring him to me before he tears my new kingdom apart!\" the voice said before it disappeared. \"Plugs redirects the darkness….and bring me the plug hounds\" Mr. Electric called grinning. Lavagirl led Max over to a rock \"Sit down Max\" \"What for?\" he said confused \"Close your eyes and dream\" she said gently \"If Max can't remember his dreams maybe he can redream them\" Lavagirl said explaining her plan to Sharkboy who looked at her skeptically. \"Dream Max\" she said smiling at the boy. Shadow watched them not exactly having the same hope her traveling companion had 'For some reason I just don't think it'll be that easy' she pondered getting lost in her thoughts She refocused her attention on Max when she heard him cough and saw bits of lava rock fly out of his mouth. \"What is that?\" Max gasped, his voice hoarse \"Lavarocks\" Lavagirl said simply \"Here have some real food, fresh sushi it'll knock you right out\" Sharkboy said whipping out a piece of fish that looked like it had been in his pocket for god knows how long. Max turned his head at the stench and Shadow found that she had to place a hand over her own nose and she wasn't even near it. \"That's not fresh, I'm not even sure that's sushi anymore\" Max coughed, Shadow couldn't help but giggle a little and Sharkboy sent a slight glare in her direction. \"There's nothing wrong with my fish, it's only a few weeks old\" Sharkboy said defensively. \"I'll cook it for you\" Lavagirl said grabbing the filet. Max jumped a little; it had gone from really bad to no-way-in-hell-anybody-would-eat-that bad. Sharkboy looked at his, now burned beyond recognition, piece of fish incredulously and then back at Lavagirl who just smiled apologetically \"Sorry\" Max sat back down \"It's ok I'm not that hungry anymore let me just rest a moment\", maybe I can sleep\" he said closing his eyes. Shadow automatically put her hand on the hilt of her sword and glared at the looming form in the distance \"It's getting closer…\" she muttered quietly to Sharkboy who had ventured over next to her. Before he could respond there was this light sound, almost like singing, Shadow smiled a little, she had no idea why La-La's loved hanging around darkness but she thought the little things were adorable. \"La-La-Laaaaa La-La-La-Laaaaaa Laaaaa La-La-La L-La-La-La..\" they sang floating by Sharkboy's and her face. Shadow reached out to touch one and Sharkboy hit them away \"Get out of here\" he said annoyed. Shadow giggled as he almost fell over swatting at one \"What's so funny?\" he grumbled \"Those things are annoying\" he huffed. Shadow smiled \"aw t-t-they're not so bad, once you get used to them that is\" she commented ,inwardly upset she couldn't seem to manage a simple sentence without stuttering, watching a La-La bounce on her hand and float away. Shadow heard a low growling sound and looked at Sharkboy who was looking back at Lavagirl who was talking to Max who was SUPPOSED to be dreaming a way out of here. Shadow looked at Sharkboy in surprise as he dashed over to Max and Lavagirl faster than she'd seen anyone run. Shadow turned back to the La-La's who were floating off into the distance she watched until the rest of the creatures had left before she turned back to the group. She saw Lavagirl holding back Sharkboy who was going after Max, who was backing away from Sharkboy 'What in the world?' Shadow thought heading after them. They all came to a halt \"I know what this is, It's It's It's a hand!\" they all looked up \"huh?\" \"It is a hand\" Max said surprised. \"Another hand!\" Max shouted \"It's Tobor!\" \"Who?\" Lavagirl asked as they all walked up \"Tobor! I dreamt him up when I was a kid, a robot that could help me with my homework, I tried to build him once, everyone kept telling me he wouldn't work\" Max said as the approached the seemingly sleeping robot. \"And here he is a forgotten dream in the dream graveyard\" Sharkboy said. \"He' supposed to be very smart\" Max said \"TOBOR AWAKE!\" The robot slowly opened his eyes, \"Yeeees?\" he said. \"He works, we can ask him anything now\" Max said excitedly \"Oo, Oo let me let me\" said Lavagirl jumping up front \"Tell me about me I'm clueless\" she asked \"Actually you are very very bright\" the robot explained, then Sharkboy pushed himself to the front \"Am I King of the ocean or what?\" Sharkboy demanded \"No Sorry\" the robot said \"How do I save planet drool?\" Max asked \"The answer is in your dreams\" the robot said \"You mean if I put him to sleep , he can dream us out of this mess\" Sharkboy said holding up a heavy metal bar Shadow just looked at him and Lavagirl glared at him \"No\" Tobor said hurriedly \"At least not here, darkness is falling any dream of his would become a nightmare and we don't want those becoming a reality\" Shadow gasped and looked down at the ground, she hated her life sometimes 'It's not fair!' she thought holding back tears, what Tobor had said of course was true, and that's why it hurt, in actuality she probably shouldn't exist either. \"Can you take us there?\" Shadow heard Max ask, pulling her out of her thoughts once again. \"I have no body I can't move\" Tobor replied \"You can move your eyes and your mouth\" Sharkboy suggested.[Chapter 5] I'm sorry for the 6 month? I think it was 6 months Hiatus on this story, I've been kinda been getting into other series and things but I'm back to complete the adventures of Shadow and Sharkboy. Thank you to all of those who have reviewed. I'm glad you all like Shadow I worked really hard to not make her a Mary-sue and I hope to keep her that way. Due to lack of room on the mouth , where Max had found a little platform to stand on, Shadow was forced to either ride behind Lavagirl ,which would have only ended up in some very painful burns, or ride behind sharkboy, and that was an awkward situation in itself. Shadow kept her eyes on the flying detached eyeball under her feet instead of the young boy she was clinging to at the moment. Sharkboy kept his eyes in front of him instead of looking at the black-haired girl attached to his chest. Shadow would have preferred riding behind the boy but his shark fin made that impossible. Her focus was pulled away from her current situation when she heard Max talking to Tobor. \"…Some dreams become are so powerful they become real, like Sharkboy and Lavagirl, but I am still only a dream.\" Was all she caught, a sharp feeling sparked through her 'At least you had the privilege of being a dream' her train of thought was lost as she felt Sharkboy flinch, Shadow hadn't realized her grip on the boy had tightened, she immediately loosened her hold and muttered \"S-sorry Sharkboy\" She resigned herself to just watch the ground as it rushed by them, trying to ignore the remainder of the conversation. Sharkboy looked at the girl holding onto him; a few moments ago she'd been gripping his sides so tight he was sure his ribs would crack. 'What was that about?' he wondered as the train of thought began to pull into view. Shadow lept down onto the train behind Sharkboy as the group began running towards the control room. Shadow stood behind a little bit looking at the scenery 'So this is what the light side of the planet was like' she gaped at the things she was seeing for the first time, once again her attention was pulled away by the screaming of her traveling partners. Shadow turned and stared wide-eyed at the ice-cream mountain the train was speeding towards. She looked down at the door to the control room. \"JUMP YOU IDIOT!\" Sharkboy yelled at her before he jumped off the train himself. Shadow stood looking at her friends jumping off one by one, at the last minute she gathered the courage to leap off the train. She landed on something soft and somewhat warm. Shadow looked down in wonder at the giant cookie they were standing on, \"EW STICK TO ROTTEN FISH PLEASE\" Shadow barely missed being hit with chocolate as Sharkboy turned his head in her general direction spitting out the sweet substance in disgust. She watched as Sharkboy and Lavagirl were trying to get Max to dream them something useful or at least somewhere useful. Shadow's eyes narrowed as she thought she saw movement in the distance, her hand instinctively going to her katana that was stuck to her hip. Sharkboy looked at her and opened his mouth to say something but stopped when his senses picked up a thumping sound. \"I can't sleep..the ground is thumping too much\" Max said sitting up, \"My highly trained ears hear it too..boom…boom…boom\" Sharkboy added \"Lemme hear it\" Lavagirl said going to lay her head on a marshmallow only managing to burn it to a crisp. Shadow was on the defense, her red eyes scanning the horizon for any sign of danger. Sharkboy snuck a glance at the dangerous expression on her face 'How does she go from shy to deadly so quickly?' he wondered looking at the usually silent girl. Her eyes widened as her hand left her sword \"COOKIE GIANTS!\" Cookie giants were pretty harmless, but known to be oblivious to anything when there was a cookie in sight. They all ran around the cookie in a panicked state trying to find a way off the treat before they were consumed by the giants. They all leapt off the cookie just in time and fell onto a slice of cake. Shadow landed on her back and let out a sigh of relief, only to look up and see a figure falling right over her. \"LOOK OUT!\" came a yell from the figure a little too late, Shadow let out a loud 'Oof' as she felt Sharkboy crash on top of her. Sharkboy sat up rubbing his head \"Ow..\" Shadow looked up at the boy trying to regain her regular breathing pattern. The position in which they were in appeared very awkward to anyone looking, which Lavagirl and Max were doing and laughing very hard at their friends expense. Shadow looked at them and blushed trying to hide her face in her hands as Sharkboy seemed to realize for the first time that he was basically sitting on the girl's chest. He jumped up quickly muttering an apology and holding a hand out to help her up. Shadow looked at him and took his hand giving him the smallest ghost of a smile. \"T-Thank you\" she said quietly silently kicking herself for not being able to get a sentence out without stuttering. \"It's the least I can do…you know after sitting on you and falling on you\" He said directing his gaze anywhere other than her. Shadow looked over at Lavagirl and Max who were staring after the cookie giants. Max looked sad she noted. \"Come on we have to go find somewhere Max can dream and somewhere AWAY from anything else that could potentially kill us\" Sharkboy muttered grabbing Shadow's wrist and pulling her behind them as they went to catch up to Lavagirl and Max.[Chapter 6] Sorry for the long wait My internet has been out and I had to go to the public library to type this chapter so there may be some errors along the way Theres a time limit on the computers where I am. Hopefully my internet will be back on pretty soon and chapter 7 will be much longer I promise. Our group of heroes quickly moved across the Land of Milk and Cookies to a quieter section well away from anymore cookie-eating giants. \"Alright Max you've had your cookies and milk now go to sleep\" Sharkboy said very sternly kneeling over Max who yawned and strecthed trying to sneak a bit of leftover frosting off his cheek. \"I said go to sleep\" Sharkboy growled, Max quickly rolled onto his side and shut his eyes tight. Lavagirl shook her head at her partner, \"Not like that...sing him a lullaby\" She said before smiling down at Max. Shadow watched them curiously from her spot where she sat cross-legged before going back to casually examining the designs on the hilt of her sword. She ran a slender finger up the handle tracing the patterns, they had always seemed so random before but now she felt like there was something there, something that had been hidden. If only she knew how to decipher what. Shadow was pulled from her current activity by the sound of singing. She looked up quite confused but wearing an amused expression on her face as she saw Sharkboy flipping around and singing his impromptu lullaby. She laughed softly as she watched the flowers begin sprouting around. She reached out and touched one of the blossoming plants, almost instantly the plants started wilting. Shadow pulled her hand back immediately and gasped looking at the dying plants in the clearing. Almost instantly a strange feeling came over her, a dark aura you could call it. She shook her head trying to clear her thoughts as she heard Lavagirl yell something about Max having nightmares. Sharkboy stopped his singing, he just happened to look at Shadow. Something wasn't right with her, he couldn't quite place it. She was staring off into space, almost like she was thinking about eyes picked up movement as he looked behind her towards the ice cream hills overlooking the clearing they were in only to see a pack of plug-hounds charging down the hill towards them all. \"Plug-Hounds!\" he yelled warning his friends before jumping on the Shark-bike Max had dreamed up. Once Everybody had jumped on Sharkboy went to start it but the only thing that occured was fudge gushing from the tailpipe. \"I forgot to dream of gas\" Max said nervously \"Max!\" Sharkboy growled thoroughly annoyed. Max and Lavagirl jumpef off the back of the bike and got into fighting stances. Shadow jumped off and joined them, Sharkboy tried the bike a few more times before accelting that it was useless. Shadow didnt have time to think as plug-hounds launched themselves at her. Shadow was surrounded and she couldn't see Sharkboy or Lavagirl or Max. Suddenly a cord snaked its way around her legs yanking her feet from underneath her. She yelled in surprise at the sudden attack as she was dragged backwards. Cords coiled around her tighter as she struggled against them, soon she was being held face to face with Mr. Electric...talk about Deja Vu. \"Well well well lookie what I caught\" He snickered looking at his prisoner. Shadow glared at the evil electrician, he only smirked at her infuriated look \"Yes the boss has great p-p-plans for little ol' you\" He laughed as she was slung into a cage. Sharkboy looked around a little worried as the trio boarded the banana split boat \"Where's Shadow?\" Lavagirl looked at him before looking down \"Last time I saw her she was wrapped in a giant plug. I couldn't get to her in time to help.\" Sharkboy glared at the figures on the hill before they faded into the horizon as the boat floated further away from the shore, the claws on his gloves were digging into the cherry stalk he was using to steer the banana split boat. Lavagirl looked at her best friend sadly, he only avoided her sympathetic gaze but that didn't suprise her, Sharkboy had always been a difficult one when it came to his feelings. She turned to Max \"What was it you saw in your dream Max?\" she asked remembering her conversation with him earlier before the plugs attacked. He thought for a moment before standing up \"Umm well it looked like...here give me something to draw it\" Lavagirl held out her finger and Max used her lava to sketch out a drawing of a heart shaped object. \"The crystal heart!\" Sharkboy said excitedly letting go of the cherry stem he was using for steering causing the boat to shift wildly before Lavagirl grabbed it steadying it again. Shadow stood on the soft surface of the dream lair glaring at the boy that stood before her \"Allow me to introduce myself I am Minus\" He grinned at her irritated expression. \"You don't seem to be too pleased to be in my presence but that shall change all in due time. The darkness will take over and then we'll see who you really are.\" He smirked turning and walking to his chair. Shadow looked at him questioningly \"What do you mean?\" Minus laughed harshly \"Surely you haven't fooled yourself with thinking you're on the good side now.\" He went back over to her and stood inches from her face. \"From the day you were made you were destined to be on my side, don't think running with Sharkboy and Lavagirl changes anything! You are STILL and will ALWAYS be a NIGHTMARE!\" Minus laughed cruelly \"You're something to be feared not loved!\" He smirked in triumph seeing Shadow's head drop. She closed her eyes shaking her head slowly \"I-It's not true\" she said quietly Minus laughed in her face more \"But it is!\" A surge of anger shot through her as she snapped her head up to glare into the eyes of the boy before her, red eyes shining \"STOP LAUGHING AT ME! I'M NOT A PAWN IN YOUR GAME! I'M NOT JUST A NIGHTMARE!\" her words came out almost as a snarl as a sharp bolt of lightning cracked through the darkness snapping Shadow out of whatever had taken ahold of her. Minus only smirked \"Its only a matter of time, now I want you out of my sight\" he murmured as she fell through a hole in the floor and into a steel cage suspended in the air. Shadow pulled her knees to her chest as she thought about everything that Minus said. \"I-Its not true...I can be good. I-I know I can\" she whispered to herself softly burying her face in her arms.[Chapter 7] Updates coming soon. My laptop's out of commission at the moment because the screen is cracked and bleeding. My desktop is out of commission because the hard drive burned out or whatever it is they call it when they stop working. I should be getting a laptop in the next 2 weeks so then I'll be updating Embrace the Darkness, APH: Musical Drabbles, Afraid to Get Wet, and I will be doing a rewrite of Miami Heat. So all that should be up in 4 weeks at the longest, Thanks to all of you who've faved or commented on my stories.

Love you all bye 3[Chapter 8] **This is just a preview of the next chapter** I've been battling with the worst diseases ever, Laziness and Writer's block so sorry you guys have been waiting forever for this chapter it's almost done and I'm gonna make it a long one so I thought I'd give you guys a little sneak peek. Minor movie plot change. I'm changing the whole Ice princess scene, I didn't really like how that section went and it didn't really make sense to me so I'll be rewriting that whole scene and adding a little scene of my own in. **when the actual chapter gets posted some things may be changed, just minor editing to make this chapter run smoother because i'm not too fond of it right now** Lavagirl rolled her eyes as Max and Sharkboy stared at the Ice princess like the she was the prettiest girl they had ever seen. \"Umm guys remember we still have to save the planet and Shadow from Minus\" Lavagirl smirked that seemed to snap Sharkboy back into shape, however she couldn't say the same for Max who seemed quite smitten with talking to the girl. Lavagirl moved over beside her life long friend \"You know I'm sure she's okay Sharkie\" she said sympathetically. He only muttered something underneath his breath. Lavagirl found it a bit frustrating that Sharkboy still wasn't allowing himself to admit he at least thought of the Shadow as a friend but that's just not how he worked and she knew it. Although if anybody could see inside Sharkboy's head they would have seen that even he didn't know exactly how he felt about the girl in question. Both of them looked up as Max called their names signalling them to over to him. As they approached him he held up the crystal heart. \"I've got it lets go!\" he said as they all went running out of the Ice castle. Lavagirl looked a bit skeptical \"I thought only the Ice Princess could use the crystal heart\" she questioned as the made their way through the ice field, Lavagirl was having a bit of difficulty doing this because she was melting the ice making it thin and slippery. Max only shrugged \"It'll work just trust me\" Lavagirl sighed shuffling across the ice faster, all of them were having some difficulty moving across at a fast pace. Lavagirl stopped when she heard a very loud cracking sound \"Did you guys feel that?\" she called to her companions. Sharkboy and Max stopped looking at her in thought for a moment until they felt the ice beginning to give under all of them. \"Run!\" Sharkboy yelled, Max and Lavagirl moved across the ice as fast as they could trying to get away from the growing hole in the ice forming behind them and failing miserably. They all slid through the ice, falling into a large ice cavern. Icicles hung precariously from the ceiling looking as if they were reade to fall, the ice had formed corridors and maze-like hallways. A person could become lost for days in here. The group looked up at the way they came in, it would be impossible to climb back up the slide made entirely of ice. \"Just great\" Sharkboy said to no one in particular \"sorry you guys\" Lavagirl said apologeticallly. \"It's ok Lavagirl not your fault.\" Max said going to pat her on her back and jerking his hand away in pain. The group slowly made their way through the ice cavern looking for any possible way out. \"Hey guys come look at this\" Lavagirl said holding her glowing hand closer to an engraving in wall of the ice cavern, \"Hey isn't that...\" The group stared at the engraving with wide eyes, it was almost unbelievable. \"We gotta go!\" Sharkboy exclaimed taking off with Lavagirl and Max trailing behind him. Shadow hit her head against the bars of her cage all the while mentally cursing herself. 'This is all because of me' she thought. 'I let this happen' she held her head against the bars gazing at the ground below her as a breeze swung the cage back and forth gently.","LastChapter":"**This is just a preview of the next chapter** I've been battling with the worst diseases ever, Laziness and Writer's block so sorry you guys have been waiting forever for this chapter it's almost done and I'm gonna make it a long one so I thought I'd give you guys a little sneak peek.

Sharky's Dream Sharkboy awoke with a start. He blinked as bright sunlight streamed in through the window and slowly opened his eyes. He rubbed his eye and moved his other arm to stretch, but it wouldn't budge. He screamed and fell backwards out of bed when he saw a human form in his bed. He heard a giggle and a voice saying \"Oh Sharky, not again! I thought you were over the surprise. I get it that you are disorientated in the morning, but I think you would remember something that happened every morning.\" Sharkboy's eyes widened in surprise. \"Lavagirl? What are you doing in my room and in my bed? Did you have a nightmare or something?\" By now he was on his feet again. \"No silly. Don't you remember?\" she said as she got out of bed. She was only wearing his pajama shirt, and for the first time he realized he was shirtless. \"Uh I-I-n-no?\" he stammered, as a blush rose to his cheeks. Hurt flashed in her eyes and he regretted saying that until she walked up to him, hips swaying. \"Then I'll just have to show you\" she said before she wrapped her arms around his neck and started leaning forward. Alarms were going off in his head, but his instinct took over. He closed the space in between them and molded his lips to hers. As the kiss deepened he wrapped his arms around her and carried her to his bed. As they came up for air she said \"Remember now?\" \"Hell yes!\" he said. As they leaned in once more she whispered \"I love you.\" \"Ditto\" he whispered back before their lips touched again. Sharkboy shot up like a rocket. \" What was that? \" he muttered as he sat up rubbing his eyes. \"Oh, it was just a dream.\" He slipped out of bed and stretched. \"Why would I have a weird dream like that?\" he suddenly smelled pancakes. He shot down stairs still perplexed about the dream. As he walked into the kitchen Lavagirl was standing at the stove cooking their pancakes. \"Morning Sharky!\" she called over her shoulder. When he didn't respond she looked up only to find him lost in thought. As he snapped out of it he looked at her and she noticed a faint blush tinge his cheeks. 'weird' she thought. Sharkboy was thinking about his dream. Max said dreams are the gateway to the subconscious so what did his dream mean to him? Surely there had to be something more to the dream then the obvious. He realized Lavagirl had turned around to look at him. 'Man, she sure did look hot in my shirt.' he thought. He felt the heat rise to his cheeks in realisation of what he had just thought and he looked away. ' I have to talk to someone about this!' he thought. 'MAX! he's the dream guy, so I'll ask him!' \"I-Uhh l-lava girl?\" he stuttered making sure not to look directly at her. \"Yea Sharky? \"I'm going to go see max for a few days! I'll be back in a week!\" he yelled as he got up and ran up the stairs. He came down with a suitcase a few minutes later and bolts out the door. Lavagirl was too stunned to say anything. He came busting back through the door muttering unintelligible words and he grabbed his plate and mumble a bye before heading out the door again. \"Sh-sharky? Wait, why-who-WHAT JUST HAPPENED?\" MALLORY:If anybody at all is reding this I hoped you liked it! SOREN: she means 'reading this' not 'reding' and PLEASE REVIEW! l l l PRESS IT! l l I KNOW YOU WANNA! l l l V V V[Chapter 2] !REVIEW! Sharkboy was lost in thought as he flew towards earth. ' I hope Max can help me figure out my dream!' he thought. And then his thoughts drifted back to Lavagirl kissing him, and the feel of her arms wrapping around his neck and her lips on his- \"Ahhh!\" he shouted aloud. \"Why can't I get her out of my mind? It's driving me crazy!\" His thoughts drifted back to Lavagirl once again. Her dressed in his shirt. Her kissing him. Him kissing her back. Suddenly an alarm went off signaling the approach to earth. Sharkboy strapped himself back in to his seat and prepared for the landing. He was very very glad Max had dreamed up landing gear or he would be in some serious trouble. He pressed the buttons and pulled the levers and flipped the switches, just like Max taught him to. As he landed he was grumbling about how for some reason him dreaming about Lavagirl was all max's fault. He was the dream man. He had to have something to do with this. A thought suddenly hit him. Lavagirl! He didn't even tell he why he was leaving. He could have at least made something up. 'she's probably off crying, thinking I left because I didn't like her anymore.' this thought saddened him greatly. He hated it when Lavagirl cried. His mood instantly changed to one of melancholy. He slowly walked off the shark rocket with his shoulder slumped and his head down. Max's mother came out the door and saw him. \"Sharkboy? What are you doing here?\" she asked. He looked up, still resembling a kicked puppy and opened his mouth to reply, when Max's mom gasped and said, \"Oh no! Is Lavagirl hurt?\" \"No!\" he yelled offended. Like he would let anything happen to her. Then he realized she might be hurt. \"Well maybe. I think I hurt her feelings.\" he said. \"Well come inside and you can talk to me until Max gets home from school\" she said ushering him inside. Lavagirl \"Sh-Sharky? Why- who-WHAT JUST HAPPENED?\" she yelled, but it was too late, he couldn't hear her over the sound of his shark cycle. ' Why did he leave? He looked angry and confused' she thought. . \"Maybe he missed Max?\" she said more as a question than anything else. Inside she knew this wasn't true. \"Or maybe he is tired of me\" she said. \"that's probably what it really is. He is asking Max to make him a more compatible best friend. Someone who he can actually love back, and not have to worry about getting burned, literally and figuratively. She kept thinking of a Sharkgirl and tears flooded her eyes. She ran to her room and flopped down on her bed and just sobbed. \"I don't want to be replaced.\" she sobbed \"I love him\" At this she jolted up and her eyes widened. She covered her mouth as if someone could hear her. She whispered again. \"I love Sharkboy\" she then said it in a normal volume \"I love Sharkboy\" next she threw open her door and shouted at the top of her lungs \"I, LAVAGIRL AM IN LOVE WITH THE MOST HANDSOME, COURAGEOUS, SMART, well not too smart, SWEETEST, MOST CARING BOY IN THE UNIVERSE; SHARKBOY!\" she then noticed someone standing in the doorway. 'CRAP!' she though, until she realized it was Linus, not Sharkboy. \"Huh, I would have never guessed.\" he said. \"Hey Linus!\" she called as she walked over to him. \"So, when did this realization come about…and where is Sharkboy?\" After he said this, her smile turned upside down and he eyes took on a strange orangey-reddish tint. \"He left.\" she said. \" I think he went to ask Max to dream him up a new best friend.\" she sniffled. He put a hand on her shoulder as the tears of lava started falling down her cheeks, but quickly pulled it away. \"sorry\" she said, but those simple words burst the dam and she started to sob. \"It'll be ok\" he said. !REVIEW! l l l l PRESS IT! l l l l l l YOU KNOW YOU WANNA! l l l l l l GIVE IN TO THE TEMPTATION! l l l l l l l l l V V V V V V[Chapter 3] Soren: It's a wonderful day: the birds are singing the sun is shining and here we are; another chapter after the long anticipated wait!

Soren: *sigh…again* she doesn't own any thing that isn't hers Chapter 3: WTF Sharky's P.O.V. \"Okay Sharkboy, what happened?\" Max's mom asked me as she led me to the couch and sat beside me. \"Well…ummmm\" I debated on telling her my dream. \"I had a dream that I needed to talk to Max about. I guess I can tell you, just don't laugh.\" She sighed. \"Sharkboy I won't laugh.\" \"Promise?\" I said \"I promise. Now what was this dream about?\" \"Well you see, in my dream I woke up-\" I paused and she nodded for me to continue \"and someone else was there…in my bed.\" I dropped my head to look at the floor. \"Who was it?\" she asked. \"It was…ummm…Lavagirl.\" I said in a whisper. I looked up to find her giving me a look I couldn't place. \"What?\" \"Was that the end or is there more?\" she asked. \"Well…ummmm…it's not the end\" I looked back down at the floor. \"You need to tell me all of it Sharkboy\" she said as she patted my shoulder. \"Well I was surprised so I fell out of bed and when I stood up Lavagirl was-\"I felt heat rising to my cheeks \"I didn't have a shirt on and she was wearing it.\" She raised an eyebrow but kept quiet. \"She asked me if I remembered something and I said no. She looked sad and then she looked mischievous.\" \"What happened next\" she asked. I could tell she was getting impatient. \"She…ummm…she kind of, maybe, kissed me, and I kind of, sort of, kissed her back.\" I stopped. \"Is that it?\" she asked like she knew what I had left out. \"She might have said she loved me and I said it back.\" I said. My face was probably beet red by now. \"What do you think this means?\" I looked up to find her biting her lip trying not to laugh. I growled. \"SEE! I KNEW YOU WOULD LAUGH AT ME!\" I shouted as I stood up to leave. \"Sharkboy! I'm not laughing at you having the dream; I'm laughing because you are so clueless!\" she said as she made a grab to stop me. \"What do you mean?\" Was this lady crazy or what? \"You are in love with Lavagirl.\" I just stared at her in shock as I processed her words. I thought of Lavagirl and the realization hit me like a ton of bricks. I was in love with Lavagirl. \"What? I can't be we've known each other forever and we are best friends. This could ruin our friendship! But what if she loved me back? Then we could-NO! What am I thinking? I'm so reckless and stupid and rude and so just ugh! She would never like-\" \"SHARBOY! CALM DOWN!\" Max's mom yelled. \"What should I do?\" I asked. Max's mom looked me straight in the eyes and said only two more words before I left for planet Drool, \"Tell her\" LAVGIRL'S P.O.V. \"No It won't!\" I said. He had been trying to comfort me for hours. \"It will never be okay again! Sharkboy's going to replace me with a more compatible best friend and I will be forgotten.\" She started to sob again. \"Perhaps it is him who should be forgotten.\" Linus said. \"Huh? Forget Sharkboy? I-I couldn't. Didn't you hear me I love him.\" I tried to explain. \"Maybe you would forget him easier if you had someone to take your mind off of him.\" Lavagirl noticed he had gotten uncomfortably close. \"W-what do you mean. What are you getting a-\" I was cut off as he kissed me. He pulled away nearly instantly, to avoid getting burned. There was a noise at the doorway and me and Linus turned to look. Standing in the doorway stood a very pissed off Sharkboy. SHARKBOY'S P.O.V. When my ship landed I jumped on my shark-cycle and drove as fast as I could to Lavagirl. When I parked it in front I nearly ran to the doorway. As I got there I heard someone talking to Lavagirl and I went in just in time to see Linus lean forward and cut off Lavagirl's next sentence with a kiss. My smile slipped off my face and was replaced with a glare. I growled loudly and both of them turned to look at me. I turned on my heel and stalked back to my motorcycle, despite the cries of Lavagirl. Mallory : So? Do you like? Soren: Of course they didn't like it! Your writing is all crap!

Mallory: I-*sigh* Just so you know I dont own anything but the story. Take that and I'll shoot- Soren: Wait. You actually did the disclaimer! I. WILL. KILL. YOU! Mallory: nonsense. SHARKBOY His bike raced down the road. Hot tears of anger and grief fell from the corners of his eyes and were swept away by the wind. He kept replaying the scene in his head. Each time he saw it he felt his anger and greief multiply. ' How could she betray me like that?' he thought. He took an angry swipe at his eyes and pulled his bike over in the middle of the street. Kids gave him funny looks but he just stalked past them. He felt the tears on his cheek now and was surprised. He hadn't realized how much loving Lavagirl would change him. As he stalked along the road he heard a familiar voice calling his name. He ignored it and kept walking until he recognized the voice. He stiffened, then growled. He turned and with a speed that surprised even himself and sprang upon the person and pinned them to the ground by their neck. \"Linus!\" he snarled. \"You! You took her from me! How could you!\" Linus looked taken aback. \"What did I-\" \"Don't you deny it! I saw you two kissing!\" Sharkboy yelled. \"Kissing? I've been in town all day!\" said Linus. Confusion was written on his face. \"Don't lie to me!\" Sharkboy said as he picked Linus up and held him in the air by his neck. Sharkboy pulled back his fist while Linus squeezed his eyes shut, waiting for the punch. \"STOP!\" shouted a voice. Sharkboy growled in annoyance but dropped Linus coughing onto the ground. \"I'm kind of busy here Max!\" yelled Sharkboy. \"What is going on here?\" he asked glancing at Linus. Sharkboy mumbled something unintelligible and glared at Linus. \"Wha- never mind! Look Sharkboy, you and Lavagirl are in serious danger!\" Max said. Sharkboy's furious expression dropped. \"Lavagirl? What's going on Max.\" Max's face soon had a look of dread on it. \"Why were you trying to kill Linus? Hurry!\" Sharkboy looked confused but recounted the story to him, blushing all the while. When he told about Linus kissing Lavagirl he sent a glare at Linus. \"But I've already told you! I have been in town all day long!\" Linus shouted in exasperation. Max's look of dread turned into one of horror. \"Sharkboy, that wasn't Linus! We need to go now! I'll explain on the way! LAVAGIRL \"LINUS! WHY'D YOU DO THAT!\" shouted Lavagirl as she pushed him away and ran towards the door. She heard him start laughing an evil laugh and looked back at him just in time to see his skin start moving and his face change into a faceless figure. \"My dear, I'm not that puny weakling Linus. I'm Metamorpheo, and now that you're away from your little boyfriend, I can destroy you.\" He said as he walked closer to her. Lavagirl's eyes widened and she shot Lava at him, but to no avail. He kept approaching with an evil smile. She turned and ran but he grabbed her arm before she could go anywhere. She opened her mouth and screamed to the top of her lungs. \"SHARKBOY!\" Sharkboy \"So this new bad guy can change shapes?\" asked Sharkboy. \"Yes. That's why it looked like Linus. He is also heat resistant so LG's powers won't do her any good. You probably can taken him out with your strength or something. That's the reason he needed to get you away from her. He knows you two care about each other and so he used that to get her away from her so he could take her out first.\" Max explained, as they raced along the road. \"We're almost there.\" said Sharkboy as the cave came into view. \"SHARKBOY!\" they heard Lavagirl scream. \"NO!\" Sharkboy shouted. He slid the bike to a stop and jumped off. \"Hey!\" shouted Max as the bike fell on top of him. Sharkboy ignored him, he just ran full steam to the doorway. What he saw enraged him even more than before. Lavagirl was unconscious and caught by the wrists in a faceless man's grip that he assumed was Metamorpheo. \"LEAVE HER ALONE! Sharkboy shouted. \"SHE'S MINE!\" he blushed when he realized he said the last part but brushed it off and ran at Metamorpheo. \"I don't think you should do that.\" the faceless man stated. \"It could be hazardous to your girlfriend's life.\" \"What do you mean how could it be-\" He was cut off by the sound of the cave roof cracking. \"I guess it won't matter if it is hazardous for her life because you two will soon be dead anyway.\" He took Lavagirl's limp form and tossed it right below the large cracks still forming in the roof. \"I bid you a hearty farewell!\" shouted Metamorpheo as he ran through the doorway. Sharkboy paid him no mind as he saw the roof of the cave start to fall down in large chunks. \"LAVAGIRL!\"He shouted as one landed near her still limp form. He rushed over to her side and picked her up bridal style. \"Ugnnnh\" she groaned and lifted a hand to her head. \"Sh-Sharky? Who did I-Wha-What happened? I-Linus was and he changed and-\" \"Lavagirl please shut up. You're making it really hard to concentrate.\" Sharkboy said as he made his way through the falling rubble. He made it through the doorway and out into the sun and mumbled under his breath \"That was anti-climactic.\" He set Lavagirl on her feet and seconds later the whole cave collapsed in on itself. He turned to make sure Lavagirl was okay. He gasped as he felt a sharp pain at his side. He looked down and saw a small arrow the size of his index finger sticking out of his side. It was filled with a glowing purple liquid that was quickly being injected inside him. He pulled it out, but a second later felt a pain shoot through him. He doubled over and dropped to his knees in pain. He numbly heard Lavagirl scream his name as the world slowly turned black. Soren: the pitiful end to a boring chapter. Mallory: SHUT UP PLEASE! Soren: Whatever... l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l Please review! l l l l l l l l l l l it makes me update faster! l l l l l l l l l yea I know, bribes are petty l l l l l l l l but bribes are all I have l l l V V V V V V V V V[Chapter 5] Mallory: I know all of you out there are probably ready to come at me with pitchforks and torches for not updating, but I have a very valid excuse. Soren: I hate to break it to you but you've had plenty of time to write, you're just exceedingly lazy. Mallory: Shut your face! I...ughh...okay you're a little bit right. Soren: And you're surprised? I laugh at you're obvious lack of intelligence. Haha. I do not regret in the least to inform you that I am always right. Mallory: What about that time you- Soren: GAH! How dare you bring that up? I...uhh...that wasn't even me! It was my evil cousin-I mean my...uhh evil twin clone robot? Yea that sounds right! Mallory: *gasp* you're right! We've got to capture them before they do any more damage! Soren: Even while she does that, she disclaims all rights and privilages associated with The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl The Screams \"Ughhh.\" Sharkboy let out a groan as his eyes fluttered open. He tried to think about what happened but he couldn't remember the whole thing. Pictures were coming back to him slowly and he closed his eyes and concentrated on them. He remembered Metamorpheo, making it out of the cave before it collapsed, the dart, and his dream. Soon he pieced it all back together and remembered. He opened his eyes and tried to gain his bearings. The first thing he noticed was that his arms were chained above his head, and he tried tugging on the chains t no avail, they remained locked tight. He soon gave up on his arms and started looking around. He din't recognize the damp stone walls or the large wooden door, but he did recognize a lone figure slumped to against a wall. \"Max!\" He whisper-yelled. \"Max are youawake?\" \"Ah.\" Sharkboy jumped at the voice as the faceless form of Metamorpheo emerged form the shadows.\"I see you're awake.\" Metamorpheo grinned. \"I regret to inform you that you're little dream boy is down for the count. He was easy enough to take down as was you're precious little flame girl.\" Sharkboy growled at the faceless man while he struggled at his chains. \"Tsk. Tsk. You shouldn't struggle so. You'll rub your wrists to the bone.\" He gave a small laugh and continued. \"You, dear boy, to put it simply, baffle me. I gave you enough tranquilizer to knock out a Tyrannosaurus and yet you wake up in mere hours.\" He walked a little closer to Sharkboy. \"I'd expect your girlfriend, with he high body temperature, to burn it off quickly, but why doesn't it keep you down?\" \"Where's Lavagirl?\" Sharkboy snarled. \"You're girlfriend, as I expected, did burn off the sleep syrum quickly; even more quickly than you. She's awaiting me in the interrigation room as we speak.\" Metamorpheo leaned in close next to Sharkboy's ear and whispered \"She and I are about to have some fun.\" With that he strode out of the room with a slam of the large door. Sharkboy started struggling with renewed vigor. His chains were clashing against each other loudly and blood started seeping out of the edges of the manacles. He took no heed of this and kept on. He yanked and tore at the restrtaints until he slumped over in exhaustion. He scrunched his eyes up and tried to think of a way out, but they shot back open when he heard the most chilling sound that he had ever heard. The screams echoed through the dank room and Sharkboy wished he could cover his ears with his hands. As the screams continued on, Sharkboy could feel one of his frenzies coming on. He ran his tongue over his second layer of razor sharp teeth and tried to keep his rage controlled. He knew if he were to have a frenzie now he would injure himself. He closed his eyes again and tried to think of anything he could to keep his mind off of the terrifying screams, but his thoughts kept returning to Lavagirl. Whatever they were doing to her to make her make those chilling sounds, they would pay. Eventually the screams stopped, Sharkboy didn't know how long they lasted-it felt like hours-but they died down slowly. He felt his teeth return to normal, but he still felt the rage running through his veins. He started as the wooden door opened. This time standing in the doorway wasn't The overbearing form of Metamorpheo, but the petite frame of a woman. As she stepped into the dim lights of the room, Sharkboy gasped. There stood Lavagirl, with scrapes and cuts and newly forming bruises covering her skin. The front of her suit was torn, and showed her stomach, covered in blood. She limped toward Sharkboy and stood shakily next to him, supporting herself on the wall. She let out a small whimper of pain before sayin in a soft voice, \"Sharky, it hurts .\" Before Sharkboy could reply, her legs gave out and she collapsed on the ground. \"LG?\" Sharkboy said, \"Lavagirl can you hear me? Wake up please. It's probably not good for you to sleep.\" \"I'm not sleeping, I just can't stand up.\" She said as another whimper escaped her lips. \"Just keep talking so I know you're awake okay.\" He said. \"I don't want to lose you.\" Just at that moments Lavagirl started laughing as she rose from the floor slowly. By the time she stood fully erect again she was no longer in the shape of Lavagirl, but of Moetamorpheo. \"You are so easy to fool. Just a little change and a little doe eyes and you are done for.\" He went back to the door and opened it. A figure stepped in and dropped a limp, bloody Lavagirl onto the ground before closing the door back. Mallory: There you have it! Soren: You've now read the worst chapter yet! l l l l l l l l l l l l l l REVIEW! l l l l l l l l l l V V V V V[Chapter 6] Soren: I'm surprised...she updated. Mallory: Soren, you know I've been busy! Soren: You only spent a week on vacation...all the other time you could have updated. Funny Fact about miss RoRo here...she taught her grandmother how to crochet (pronounced kroshay) that's sortof like knitting... Mallory: IT IS NOT LIKE KNITTING! Soren: Yea it is you have yarn and you make stuff with stick(s) Mallory: Besides Shorty can crochet too and he's a guy! Well he can also play the Ukulele. Soren: I still don't understand why you call him shorty. He's 6'0\" and You're 5'0\"...that's a foot of difference. Mallory: It's called irony Soren: This is called a disclaimer...SHE DISCLAIMS! Mallory: I don't even care! Dream Magic Sharkboy didn't know how long he stayed there just whisper/screaming Lavagirl's name. He was trying to make her eyes open by sheer force of will. Hoping that just maybe her breathing would even out and the bleeding would stop. He was so caught up in trying to get her attention that he didn't notice Max start stirring. It started with a small groan that sent a fluttering to his eyelids before they finally opened. \"Sh-Sharkboy?\" he askeed as he sat up against the wall. Sharkboy felt his heart jump. \"LG!\" he yelled excitedly. Max groaned again. \"No it's me.\" Max replied, putting hgis hand against his throbbing head. \"Where are we?\" A dissapointed sigh escaped Sharkboy's lips, and he explained all that had happened. By the time he was done explaining, Max was leaned up against the wall, inching himself toward Lavagirl. Once he reached her, he knelt down and tried to assess the damage. She was covered in bruises and small cuts, and had a few burns and a broken arm. The only major injury looked to be the six inch gash across her stomach. Sharkboy, who was nervously clenchinhg and unclenching his fists, asked, \"How is she?\" \"It looks worse than it actually is. I just need something to stop the bleeding.\" The only thing laying around loose in the room was a chain, so Max gave a defeated sigh and reached for the hem of his shirt. \"Uhhh...what are you doing Max?\" Sharkboy asked with a cocked eyebrow. \"I have to stop the bleeding with something, \"Max said with the roll of his eyes, \"and there is no way to get your shirt off, and I don't have a death wish, so I'm not taking Lavagirl's shirt off. Mine is the only one left...obviously.\" \"Oh. I guess that makes sense.\" Sharboy leaned his head back against the cold stone of the wall while Max finished taking off his shirt, and closed his eyes. He didn't open them again until Max's voice broke the silence of the room. \"Why do you think you're the only one chained?\" he asked. Sharkboy tried and failed to shrug. \"Lavagirl's obviously out of comission and you aren't really a threat except for your drea-WAIT! Can you do your dream magic?\" Max got a far-away look for a few seconds then shook his head. \"No. My mind is still kind-of foggy from being knocked out. I can't concentrate on any-\" His sentence was interrupted by a small whimper from Lavagirl. She shot up the next second only to give a small scream as her arms flew to Max's shirt covering her wound. \"Huh? I-I-whe-what-\" she stammered. Two expressions broke out on Sharkboy's face at once. One of worry and one of a nervous hope. \"Lavagirl!\" He shouted. Her neck whipped around at the sound of his voice, and when her eyes found him she flashed him a watery grin. \"Sharky! I-AH!\" Another cry of pain escaped her lips. \"Why don't you lay back down\" Max advised, urging her to use his legs as a pillow. She layed down with another whimper of pain. She closed her eyes, but didn't go to sleep. Instead she listened to Sharkboy and Max's conversation. \"Max, can you do your magic dream thing now?\" Sharkboy asked. \"I'll try.\" There was a small silence, and she felt Max tense up under her, then the rustle of chains. \"Almost.\" Another silence followed, before another rattle of the chains. Sharkboy sighed. \"How about you do your dream magic, and I pull?\" \"Okay.\" This time the silence lasted only a second before the chains sounded. This time they were alot louder. A moment later the sound of a pop, then the chains dropping to the ground, and a gleeful shout from Sharkboy. Lavagirl opened her eyes and lifted her head to see Sharkboy running over to her and Max. She tried to speak when all the sudden another pain shot up her body and she cried out. Sharkboy gently switched her head over to his lap and started stroking her hair. \"It'll be okay\" he said. No sooner had he spoke than The door was shoved open and Metamorpheo strolled in. He looked to where they were sitting and frowned. \"Get the girl and the blonde boy and bring them. Leave the fishboy.\" Sharkboy growled, but let out a cry of surprise as he was lifted from the ground and slammed to the wall. \"Why are you doing this?\" He snarled. \"Simple. Revenge.\" \"Wha-\" Metamorpheo held his hand up, to stop what he was going to say. \"I had all this power, all these abilities, but my brother was the special one.\" His fists clenched. \"Just because he was the oldest he got all the praise, all the love; while I got labled a freak.\" \"What does this have to do with us?\" Sharkboy demanded. \"Because,\" He started, \"My brother was your dear father.\" The door slammed with a thud as Max and lavagirl were dragged down the hall, and Sharkboy was dropped to the floor stunned.

I have so much stuff to read! Beowulf and St. Augustine and Aristotle. I've got Chem tests I'm barely passing...not to mention Humanities and Rhetoric(Which I have to write a pursuasive speech on legalizing Marijuana) My Chem teacher likes to yell at me as does my Geometry teacher. I had to memorize the entire periodic table in four days and I'm failing Latin. That just about covers it. Soren: You forgot to mention the horrible flabbiness you've gained since you summer hybernation. Your P.E. teacher yells at you for slacking. Mallory: Hey, No fair! I don't try on purpose!

I think it has more to do with my awesome skills and amazing talent at tackling people than luck. Soren: Hah! You're right! You have the luck of a man who was deformed at birth had a mental disability, was paralized and hit by a bus...Plus...I get to do the disclaimer! She dis- Mallory: Idisclaimeeverything! Hahahahahahaha! Dread Sharkboy stared at his bloody hands as he paced back and forth. He had tried to beat his way out of the thick metal walls to no avail. He hadn't even dented them. His thoughts weren't on his hands though. He was waiting for the screams he knew were inevitable. Waiting to hear the anguished cries of the friends he could not reach. As if summoned by his thoughts, he heard a sound so faint, that he doubted he even heard it until another followed. So they had started on Max. He felt guilty at being glad they weren't the screams of Lavagirl for only a second before another voice joined Max's. One that he dreaded hearing. The screams echoed through the dank room as he paced faster and faster until he was nearly running around the room. He pushed his hands against his ears so hard, his claws dug into his scalp, but the screams seemed to get louder. A jolt of fear shot through him as one of the screams abruply stopped while the other continued. He strained his ears to hear anything, failing to realize his hands were still tightly clamped against the sides of his head. He heard the muffled sounds of the door opening and the distinctly feminine screams drifted through the door as it was quickly opened and shut again after something was thrown in. It took him a moment to register that the lump on the floor was Max, before he rushed to his side. He lossened his hands from his ears and lowered shaking hands to the worse looking part of Max. From where his neck met his shoulders to the left side of his chest was a gash that was gushing blood so thick, it looked black. Sharkboy pressed his hands against the gash and tried to stop the blood, but it was coming fast. He knew if Max didn't get help soon, he wouldn't last long. As he attempted to stop the bleeding of Max's chest, he failed to notice the screams stop until the door of the cell opened and a concious but severely hurt Lavagirl was draped across the arms of Metamorpheo. Sharkboy growled as he ran his tongue along his second layer of teeth, something he did out of habbit, as he felt a frenzie coming on, but didn't want to move his hands from Max's chest, lest he bleed out. \"Why are you doing this?\" He asked the faceless man. \"I don't have any secrets to give you. They don't deserve to suffer.\" Metamorpheo just gave a chuckle as he gently layed Lavagirl on the floor. He turned his back to walk out the door before pausing, \"My dear boy, torture isn't just for interrogation. Maybe I just like watching you squirm.\" \"You're a sick, insane, lonely old man!\" Spat Sharkboy. \"Perhaps.\" said the man with a light smirk. \"Or perhaps you are the one who is sick and insane for placing me here.\" He said as he walked out. \"I'll see you in your dreams.\" Sharkboy furrowed his brow as he tried to decifer the meaning behind the man's words, but his attention was drawn by the slight wimper from Lavagirl's direction. He wanted to go see if her condition was as bad as Max's but didn't want to leave Max to bleed. He lifted his hands from Max's chest and was shocked to find them clean and clear of blood. He looked down at Max's chest to find the blood on his shirt dried and his chest bleeding no more. He checked Max's pulse to find it strong and was surprised to hear his breathing level out. \"Weird.\" he breathed before scooting closer to Lavagirl. With one glance, he knew she didn't have long. Just being on the floor for as long as she had been, she was already in a pool of her own blood. \"Sh-sharky?\" She asked in a small voice as he lifted her head to place on his lap. \"I don't feel very well.\" \"It'll be okay.\" He whispered to her, brushing the strands of her hair painted red with her blood out of her face. \"No I mean I can't feel it.\" she said. \"All there is is numb. Like my mind is awake and my body is asleep.\" He could feel her shallow breaths and knew he didn't have very much time. \"I need to tell you-\" They started at the same time. \"You first\" said Sharkboy. She took a slow shaky breath before coughing a little. \"Sharky, I know you may not be iclined to feel the same way about me, but I need to tell you so-something.\" She let out a few more coughs and Sharkboy didn't fail to notice that her hands came back tinted red. She blinked slowly, her eyes staying closed for a long enough time to scare Sharkboy before they slowly opened back, half lidded. \"I needed to tell you that I-\" she paused and took a shallow breath. \"I love you Sharky. I think I al-always have.\" His eyes grew wide as a smile grew on his face that dropped as Lavagirl closed her eyes again, this time, not opening again. \"LG...Lavagirl? Hey Lavagirl, wake up.\" he said, shaking her. He started to grow more frantic. \"Lavagirl, wake up. I need you! Lavagirl, open your eyes.\" He started breathing hard as he grabbed her wrist and felt for a pulse. There was none. He pressed his fingers to her neck, with the same outcome. He layed his ear on her chest to listen for a breath or a heartbeat. Neither came. He lifted his head from her chest and looked at her lifeless face. He felt his bottom lip tremble as his eyes grew wet. \"I love you too.\" He whispered as a tear fell from his eye and landed on her nose before dripping down her face. He lowered his head, and placed a soft kiss on her lips before pulling away and letting the sobs that were threatening to come loose, tear from his chest.

He looked around, expecting to see the dark cell around him, but found the deep blue of his bedroom wall. He took a few deep breaths before lifting his hand to wipe his face, surprised when it came back, wet with tears. \"It was all a dream.\" He whispered before a quiet voice from beside him ansewed. \"What was?\" Sharboy jumped at the soft sound of the voice and looked over to see the sleepy face of Lavagirl sitting up in the bed beside him. \"Lavagirl!\" He shouted before grabbing her in a hug. He felt her hug back and he breathed in her scent. \"I thought I'd lost you.\" She pulled away to look him in the eyes. \"Do you want to talk about it?\" He shook his head. \"Not really.\" He looked up nervously at her. \"What?\" She asked. He gulped before replying. \"There's something I need to do.\" She gave him a weird look. \"Go ahead, what is it.\" \"It's something that I should have done a while ago, and I realized that I should do it before it's too late.\" He took a deep breath. \"Go ahead and do it. I'll wait on you.\" She said as she slung her legs over the side of the bed. \"Wait.\" Sharkboy said as he grabbed her arm. \"Close your eyes for a second.\" He moved to dit beside her. Lavagirl raised her eyebrow before closing her eyes. She cracked one open. \"Why do I have to close my eyes?\" Sharkboy sighed, he was slowly losing his nerve. \"Just do it.\" She huffed but complied. \"Now what?\" \"Don't move.\" He said as he licked his lips. He leaned in slowly and let his eyes flutter shut. He didn't notice Lavagirl crack her eye open to see what he was doing. She gasped softly as she felt the buterfies flutter through her stomach, before closing her eyes again. Sharkboy paused as he felt her breath on his lips. He opened an eye to see what her reaction was. He waited for a few more seconds, just in case she wanted to pull away. \"Are you going to kiss me or are we just going to sit here all day like a couple idiots?\" She said, a pink blush spreading across her face. Sharkboy smiled before pressing his lips gently to her soft warm ones. He felt her melt into the kiss as he wrapped his arms around her waist and felt her arms snake around his neck. After what felt like no time at all in his opinion, the kiss ended. They looked into each other's eyes as they cought their breath. \"What took you so long?\" Lavagirl asked with a smile. \"I have no idea.\" Sharkboy replied before closing in for another soft kiss. When they pulled apart Sharkboy realized something. \"What were you doing in my bed?\" He asked. Lavagirl shrugged. \"The usual, Nightmares.

What's in a Name? I woke up to the sound sound ofnroaring, a large streak of light burst in the sky. I pushed myself tonmy feet and looked at the bursts of colors. A chorus of screamsnechoed through the night air. I gasped, looking around, wonderingnwhere I was, what was going on, but most importantly...who I was. Inlooked down, my body not fully visible yet. I pushed my long, creamncolored hair back over my shoulders and looked down at the tatteredndress I was in. More screams echoed through the air, I jumped. Myneyes skitted across the terrain, searching for a sign. Off to my right, was exactly the signnI was looking for. Well, half of it. One a white picket sign, writtennin messing writing were the words. Welcome to Planet Drool . Inthink. I stepped forward, looking at the sign. Beside it was thenocean, and off in the middle of the ocean was a large volcano. Thisnplace was weird. \"Excuse me, are you looking fornsomething?\" A friendly voice questioned behind me. I turnednaround and looked. A girl with fiery hair was standing there, a smilenon her face. I didn't answer. \"She asked you a question!\"nThe boy next to her growled. She nudged him. My lips parted just anlittle as I stared at them. \"I don't know where I am, ornwhat's going on.\" I replied, the first time I had ever heard mynown voice. The boy and the girl shared a look with each other. \"What's your name?\" The girlnasked. I looked down at the ground. \"Probably something like CatnWoman or Flee Bag ,\" The boy snorted. I shook my head. \"Cat Girl?\" His friendnopted. I shook my head again. \"Just tell us your name!\" \"Sharkboy! Be a little nicer,\"nshe told him. He crossed his arms. Turning back to me she smiled.n\"I'll tell you our names first. I'm Lavagirl, and this is mynfriend Sharkboy.\" She smiled. I nodded my head in sort of a bownand looked at her. \"I'd like to tell you my name,nbut I don't think I have one.\" I whispered, feeling embarassed.nShe looked at Sharkboy curious, then back at me. \"Well, you have this collarnaround your neck.\" She stepped forward and reached out to touchnmy collar. \"No! LG stop!\" Sharkboynhollered, but it was too late. Touching my collar, it burst intonflames. Screaming I pulled away. Hitting the edge of the water by thenocean, I fell in. I slashed around in the water, my skin crawlingnwith the wetness. I opened my mouth to hiss, but the bubbles thatnescaped so suddenly stopped me. I thrashed around, trying to go up,nbut the only place I managed to go was down. A hand broke through thensurface of the water and grabbed me, hauling me back up to thensurface. I coughed, my hair weighed down by water. Sharkboy looked atnLavagirl through narrow eyes as she shrugged her shoulders, gigglingnnervously. \"Oops.\" Reaching up I pushednthe hair out of my eyes, the water holding my ears down, my tailnfeeling heavy. Reaching to the side, Sharkboy picked up a littlensilver metal in the shape of a cat paw and looked at it carefully.nLavagirl stepped up behind him and bent over, looking at the namenover his shoulder. \"What does it say? Is it Cat Girl?\" Shenquestioned. He shook his head and looked at me, one of his eyebrowsncocked. \"No, it's Miu \" Henreplied. She looked at him. \"Pronounced like mew? Like whatncat's do?\" He shrugged his shoulders. \"I don't know, I'm not the namengenious here.\" He handed the tag out to me. I took it and lookednat it. \"We should ask Max.\"nLavagirl opted, looking at him. He nodded his head. \"He'll know, after all, he was the one who dreamt her up.\"[Chapter 2] Chapter 2: Swept Away. I followed after the two, a good fournor five steps behind, eavesdroppong on their conversation. Theynsounded like lovers, the way they picked on each other -or rather thenway she picked on him . Slowly, he brought his arm up behindnher and draped it around her shoulders, but it didn't stay there verynlong. A loud sizzling noise came from the impact, smoke rising fromnhis arm. He jumped away, looking at it. She laughed. \"It teaches you doesn't it?\"nShe questioned with a large grin. Sharkboy rubbed at it and scowlednas he continued to walk. \"Apparently it doesn't teach menenough.\" he grumbled. He looked back over his shoulder at me. Inlooked away, my face hidden in my hair. \"You know, you can talk.\" He told me. Lavagirl looked over her shoulder as well. Injust nodded. He stopped. I stopped, almost running into him. Theynboth stared at me, making me feel unomfortable. \"Talk.\" Hendemanded. Lavagirl nudged him. \"Sharkboy! Why can't you be nicento her?\" She questioned. He glared at her. \"I'm not sure if you've noticednthe cat ears, eyes or tail, but I have, and what they're telling menis she's a cat.\" He explained, pointing at me. She looked at me,nthen back at him and shrugged her shoulders. \"So, cats aren't nasty creatures,nunless she's Siamese.\" She smiled. Didn't she ever stop smiling?nI wanted to tell her I wasn't siamese, but when I opened my mouth,nthe dumbest thing ame out. \"You smell good.\" I said,nlooking at Sharkboy. He gasped and jumped backwards. Lavagirl lookednat him confused. I took a step forward, causing him to back away. Shensmiled. \"Oh! I get it!\" She noddednher head. We both stopped moving and looked at her. \"You're ancat and Sharkboy's a fish! And cats eat fish!\" I looked at hernhorrified then jumped away from him, my hands over my mouth. \"I'm Sorry!\" I squealed. Henremained in his defensive stance, crouched over. \"Don't get any ideas or I'll wompnyou!\" He shook a fist at me. I swallowed hard. Lavagirl rollednher eyes and shook her head. \"Sharky, I know you wouldn't hitna girl, no matter how threatened you felt.\" He flashed her anlooked as she started walking again. \"I would if I was a girl.\"nHe mumbled, following after her. I counted out exactly five stepsnbetween them and me before I started following again. It was quietnfor a while, until I could bear it no more. \"Who is this Max? And will henknow who I am?\" I ran up in between them. Sharkboy jumped awaynfrom me, obviously out of distrust. Lavagirl nodded, smiling at hernfriend's behavior. \"Max dreamt up both Sharkboy andnmyself. Everything you see,\" She looked around, a proudnexpression on her face. \"Everything was dreamt up by Max.\"nI looked around, my lips pressed in a hard line. \"He must have a pretty goodnimagination.\" I muttered, looking at an amusement park off to mynright. Sharkboy clenched his fists and stepped forward. I backed awaynfrom him, my eyes wide as he shook a fist at me. \"You have a lot of nerve to sitnthere and insult the person who made you!\" He growled. Lavagirlnjumped in front of him and tried to push him back, but he managed tonpush through, shoving her back with him. I backed up, my feet hittingna sheer drop. \"Sharkboy! Stop she wasn'tninsulting Max!\" Lavagirl hollered. Losing my footing I fellnbackwards, being engulfed in water. Was this entire planet covered innwater? I thrashed around, the current sucking me under. The water wasncold as panic sunk in. I tried my hardest to swim, but it was no use.nI didn't know how to, and I hated the water. I felt the air leave mynlungs as my ribs began to hurt. I watched as the light began tondisappear as I was being dragged under. A figure interupted mynshimmering death, his eyes on me. I reached out to him as he swamntowards me, a serious look on his face. I let the last bit of airnbubbles go. Closing my eyes I agreed to let darkness take me. Grabbing my hand Sharkboy turned andnstarted to swim me back towards the surface, the water freezing theninside of my ears. We hit something hard, then his warm hand let go.nThe sound of pounding could be heard, but it got softer as thencurrent sped up, before I knew it, I was no where near the two ofnthem, surrounded in ice chunks, awaiting certain death in my new icynprison.[Chapter 3] Chapter 3: Land of Milk and Cookies I woke up to a sweet smell, my sensesnbeing tickled by one element that made my stomach growl from hunger.nGroggily -and still soaking wet, practically frozen- I sat up andnlooked around. I was sitting in a valley -or what it looked to be- ofncookies. In front of me was a river of white. Slowly I pulled myselfnforward, crawling on hands and knees until I reached the edge of thenriver. I sniffed at it confused for a moment, then dunked my hand innit. It was warm. Carefully I turned around and slid mynbody into it -seeing how I knew I wasn't going to get any dryernanytime soon. I gasped from the warmth, my body begging for it. Inclosed my eyes as I held onto the bank and relaxed in it. My stomachngrowled again. Off in the distance loud thudding noises could benheard. Looking up, I saw two giants coming up and over one of thenmountains. Giants! Gasping as they came into the valley, I pushednmyself under the surface of the water and held my breath, feelingnirritated that I had to get my ears wet again. I waited, holding my breath for whatnmust have been an hour at least until they passed through.nPushing myself back up to the top of the surface I gasped, pushing mynhair from my eyes and wiping the hot liquids from my face. I lickednmy lips. A sensational flavor passed through my throat, causing mynstomach to growl wildly. I looked down at the white liquid shocked. \"Milk?\" Leaning forward, Incupped a large handful of the milk and brought it to my lips. Insucked at it, the delicious liquid warming my throat, the heatnseaping through the rest of my body. Putting my hands down, I stucknmy lips to the surface and began to lap at it greedily. Behind me thensound of footsteps grew closer, but no matter how hard I tried, Incouldn't stop drinking. \"Miu!\" A girl called. Mynears perked up. \"Miu!\" A boy called. I stoodnup and climbed out. I took a couple steps away from the river, thennstopped. Looking back, I ran back to its edge and started to lap atnthe milk again. \"Miu! Where are you!\"nLavagirl hollered again. They rounded the corner into my valley andnstopped. \"Wow, now if that isn't thenweirdest thing I've ever seen.\" Sharkboy snorted. Lavagirlnstepped forward and laid a hand on my shoulder. A loud sizzling noisensounded right by my ear as fire burnt away at my shoulder. Hissing Injumped away from her. She looked at me apologetically as I rubbed mynshoulder. \"Why didn't you answer us when we were hollering yournname!\" Sharkboy growled, his fists clenched. I glared at him.nStanding I shoved myself forward and shook my fist in his face,ncausing him to back off a little. \"Why did you let me go jerk! Inhope you realize I don't have gills!\" I snarled. He hit my handnout of his face. \"I had you but then when I wasntrying to get back to the surface the water froze over and Inaccidentally let go! I'm sorry!\" I stuck my nose up and turnednaway, crossing my arms. \"how does the water magically freeze over?\" I snorted. He crossed his arms and scowled at me. \"I don't know, but you'renforgetting that I was stuck down there too.\" I whirlednaround and glared at him. \"Oh, a little to wet fornyou Sharky !\" I hissed. He stepped forward, his teethnbared. Lavagirl stepped forward and put her hands up, making sure wendidn't get to close to eachother. \"Come on you two, it was annaccident alright? No need to tear each other's throats out.\" Insnorted and pulled away. He just crossed his arms and glared at me. \"So what do we do now?\" Ingrumbled, looking at her over my shoulder. She sighed and shook hernhead. \"I don't know, we have to find antime when we can go visit Max.\" She looked at Sharkboy. Hennodded. \"It wouldn't be a good idea tondrop in on him during school too much, might give Mr. Electricidad a heart attack.\" Lavagirl walked by him followed by me.n\"Maybe we should drop in on him during school?\" He smiled.nTurning he followed us. \"What time is it on earthnSharky?\" She questioned, taking a seat on a giant cookie chunk.nCatching on fire, it burnt to a crisp. She looked at it shocked, thennsighed and just shook her head. Sharkboy pulled out this weirdnlooking device and looked at it. \"One thirty, he should be gettingnout of school in about an hour and half.\" He looked at her. Shenjust nodded. \"Alright, so what do we do whilenwe're waiting?\" I questioned, looking at them with my armsncrossed. Clasping her hands together, she smiled. \"How about we sing songs?\" Inshared a look with Sharkboy, then shook our heads at the same time.nFor being made of lava she sure was a peppy person. \"How about we talk about what wenlike so that I don't push you guys over board and get my head bit -ornburned- off?\" I opted. Sharkboy nodded. \"That sounds good.\" Lavagirlnsmiled and shifted so that she was sitting differently, her eyesnsparkling. \"That sounds fun, we get to tellnyou about ourselves and in turn we can learn about you.\"nSharkboy found a spot on a marshmallow and muttered. \"Not like we'd find out much, shendidn't even know her own name.\" I glared at him. \"Alright, I'll start off first.\"nShe smiled. \"As you know, my name is Lavagirl and I was dreamtnup by Max. I didn't know who I was rightfully at first either, and Inwasn't to confident in my abilities seeing how I was alwaysndestroying everything, but when we were on a quest to save thisnplanet\" \"Planet drool\" \"From Mr. Electric\" \"The person incharge ofnmaintenence on planet drool\" \"I found out that I was more thanndestruction, I was really light.\" She smiled proudly. I nodded.nShe looked at Sharkboy, her grin stretching. \"Your turn Sharky.\"nClearing his throat he smiled. \"I was dreamt up by Max as wellnalong with Lavagirl, and after my father's ocean lab was destroyed Inwas raised by sharks. I helped save this world and became\" Henbrought his hand up through his hair, making himself look important.nI cocked an eyebrow. \"A dweeb?\" I opted. Henglared at me as Lavagirl giggled. \"King of the Ocean.\" henfinished. I smiled. \"So your highness , hownmany shrimp farms do you rule over?\" I teased. Lavagirl laughednharder. He crossed his arms and started sulking. \"Shut up.\" He grumbled. \"Aww, Sharky it's ok, she's justnkidding.\" Lavagirl leaned over, looking into his eyes. ShiftingnI looked around, my lips pressed in a hard line. Sharkboy looked atnme, same as Lavagirl. \"So are you going to tell us aboutnyourself?\" Lavagirl asked, curiously. \"Or at least what younremember?\" She questioned. I shrugged my shoulders and shook mynhead a bit. \"I don't remember a lot. Inremember being in darkness with someone screaming my name over andnover again, then I remember someone saying I was never going tonamount to anything. Two men were speaking. Saying I was a mistake.nUseless.\" I fell silent and looked out over the river. \"ThatnI was weak.\" Lavagirl looked at Sharkboy with a sympathetic looknon her face and shook her head. \"Well we don't think that.\"nI looked away at the floating rafts of cookies, drifting slowlyndownstream. \"Can we go somewhere else? Thensweetness here is making my stomach swoon.\" I muttered. Noddingnshe pushed herself up and started towards the river. Sharkboynfollowed her towards a docked cookie and jumped on. Turning he heldnhis hand out to me. I hesitated, then grabbed his hand and climbed onnas Lavagirl found a seat on another marshmallow. Sticking his footnout, Sharkboy kicked the cookie towards the center of the river andnallowed the current to take us. \"You might want to sit down.\"nSharkboy told me, walking up behind me. I looked back over mynshoulder at him. \"Why?\" I questioned.nSuddenly the cookie smashed into the bank, knocking me from my feetnand into him, knocking him to the ground. I rubbed my head, shifting.nGrunting I looked up, my face turning red as I realized that I wasnlaying on top of him. I couldn't help but notice the scent, butnrealized that there was something more. He was completely attractive.nI couldn't help but stare at him as he grunted, trying to pushnhimself up. \"I-I'm sorry.\" I squeaked, pushing myself offnof him. \"I told you to sit down.\" Henmuttered, rubbing his head. I went to shift so that I was no longernhovering over him, but my hand slipped aross a chocolate chip.nSquealing, I fell forward, my lips pressing against his. Gasping henpushed me away and rubbed his arm across his mouth. \"Ugh! Younkissed me!\" He hollered, pushing himself to his feet, slamming anfinger in my direction. My fists clenched, my eyebrows furrowing. \"It's not like I meant to younjerk!\" I growled, sitting up straight. He snorted and crossednhis arms. \"Yeah right. I know you likednkissing the king.\" He brought his hand through his hair.nGrowling I grabbed a handful of melted chocolate chip and chucked itnat him when he wasn't looking, the melted brown liquid smashing himnin the face. He fell over, his butt landing in another chocolate chipnpit. Lavagirl laughed as I turned my back on him and stared out overnthe river with my arms crossed as we passed a signed etched in thenicy siding that said The Sea of Conscienceness .[Chapter 4] Chaptern3: Mew? Wenreached our destination, a world covered in…stuff. I didn't knownwhat it was. Where it was. What was going on. We stepped off of thenfloating cookie and into a powdery wonderland. There were what lookednto be Twinkies with wings. Weird. I looked at Sharkboy and Lavagirlnas they stepped forward, looking around in curiosity. \"Did Maxndream up a new place?\" Lavagirl questioned, looking at Sharkboy. Henshrugged his shoulders. \"I don't think I've seen this part ofnPlanet Drool before, I wonder what it's called.\" Just as thenwords escaped his lips, the ground started to shake. My legs wobblednbeneath me, my head whipping around trying to see what it was thatnwas approaching. Squealing I fell to the ground, a large cloud of thenpowder poofing up around me. A dot formed in the sky along with anloud whistle. I gasped and pointed up at it, my eyes wide. \"Watchnout!\" I screamed. Both of their heads snapped up as the dot gotnbigger. They both backed up as the object came hurdling towards thenground. In attempts to evade it, Sharkboy stepped back a little toonfar, his heel catching my side, sending him flying over me and ontonhis back. The ground stopped rumbling as a giant sign fell to thenground, sticking into the powder. I wheezed as he sat up, his finndigging into my stomach. \"You ok?\" Lavagirl questioned, walkingnover to us as Sharkboy pushed himself up. \"Yeah I'm fine, bent mynfin a bit but I'm ok.\" He replied, wiping the powder off of hisnback and butt. \"I was asking Miu.\" She informed him. He glarednback at her like it was an insult or something. She bent over, thensmile on her face seeming concerned. I pushed myself up so that I wasnsitting and nodded. \"I'm fine, just…a little powdery.\" Ingiggled lightly. I looked at Sharkboy and heard him muttering aboutnhow it was always strangers before him with Lavagirl. \"are younalright?\" I questioned aiming it at Sharkboy. He nodded. \"Yeah,nif you hadn't been laying on the ground I wouldn't have tripped.\"nHe shot back at me. I glared at him and pushed myself to my feet.n\"Well excuse me your highness .\"nI snarled, my fists clenched at my sides. \"Am I supposed to be ablento stand when the ground is shaking everywhere?\" I was almostnhollering. \"Lavagirlnand I were!\" He hollered back. \"Wellnyou guys are heroes! I'm nothing ok!\" I screamed and walked bynhim and up to the sign. I didn't want to look at him, but with mynears I could hear what he was saying. \"That'snno excuse, you're just a klutz.\" he grumbled. \"Stop.\"nLavagirl whispered. \"Inthought cats were supposed to land on their feet ?nNot their backs ?\"nHe snorted. \"Sharkboy,nstop!\" She whispered again, harshly. \"Why?nShe has such a bad attitude!\" He hissed back roughly. \"Shenonly has a bad attitude because you are being so mean to her!\"nLavagirl informed him. \"whynis it always my fault?\" He muttered. \"Becausen99.8 percent of the time it is.\" She replied and started to walknafter me. I stopped in front of the sign and looked up. \"Doughnutnland?\" I questioned with a cocked eyebrow. \"Does that explain thenTwinkies?\" I looked back over my shoulder as Lavagirl walked upnnext to me. She shrugged. \"Inguess so.\" I looked down and started to push my heel into thenground. A hole opened up and a large puddle of thick, red goop camenout. \"Eww!\"nI squealed, jumping back. Lavagirl looked at it backing up. \"Whatnis it?\" Sharkboy questioned running up next to me. I backed awaynfrom him, glaring at him. \"Indon't know.\" Lavagirl replied honestly, bending down to observenit better. \"Catsneat things they aren't supposed to, why don't you see what itnis?\" He looked up at me. I felt my eyes narrow as I hissed at him. \"Inwouldn't eat you ifnyou were ground up, grilled and cut to look like a trout!\" Henrolled his eyes and stuck his fingers in it, holding it out to me. \"Justneat it.\" I felt my bottom lip tremble as I looked at his completelyncovered first two fingers. I grunted and stepped forward, dropping tonmy knees in front of him. I was curious was it was, but Lavagirlncouldn't eat it and Sharkboy didn't seem like he was going tonleap off a bridge to see what it was, so it was up to the catnwho eats what she shouldn't . Ingrabbed his wrist lightly and dragged my tongue across the tip of hisnfingers, licking off some of the goop. He grunted. \"Getnit all off please!\" I snorted and cursed him under my breath. Inswallowed and leaned forward, sticking the jelly covered fingers innmy mouth all the way to the last knuckles and sucked on them. My facenwent hot as I sucked, my eyes closed. I could feel their eyes on me.nThe sweetness of it stung my teeth as it went straight to my head,nmaking my eyes water a bit, but it wasn't awful tasting. It wasnvery good, and it made my stomach flutter. Or maybe the flutteringnwas something else? \"Alright! You're not making out with my hand!nJust get the stuff off and back away!\" he snapped. My eyes snappednopen and I pulled away, a string of saliva stringing from the tip ofnhis fingers to my tongue. He looked at it in disgust as it snapped.n\"Ew,\" He grunted, wiping it off of on his leg. \"You'renthe one who wanted me to suck on it!\" I grumbled. He shot me andirty look and grunted. \"Sonwhat did it taste like?\" Lavagirl questioned leaning forward. \"Itnwas sweet, it didn't taste that bad.\" I replied, a smile on mynface. Reaching down I stuck my fingers in it and held it out to her.nI knew it was bad if she touched it, hopefully her mouth wasn'tnlike lava as well. She smiled and leaned forward putting her mouthnaround my fingers. I smiled as her tongue tickled my knuckles.nSharkboy leaned in a little, staring contently at my hand andnLavagirls face. \"Is something wrong?\" I looked at him. He lookednup at me, his cheeks flushing a bit. \"no,nI was just wondering if it was hurting?\" I looked down and waited.nIt was hot, but it wasn't burning me terribly. I shook my head.nWhen Lavagirl moved away I saw that there was a small, burnt coatingnof the goop stuck around my fingers. My eyes opened wide. That'snwhy it wasn't hurting. The goo melted and created like…a shieldnlike thing. \"Innow know why it wasn't hurting.\" I replied, pulling my hand up.nReaching forward, I wrapped my fingers around the now black casingnand pulled it off of my fingers. I looked back up at Lavagirl,nblinking a couple times, wondering why it didn't hurt when she keptnlicking my knuckles. \"Sonwhat is it LG?\" Sharkboy questioned. She smiled and licked hernlips. \"Inthink it's Jelly.\" he grunted in a displeased tone and lookednaway. \"Figures,nwe're in Doughnut Land and we're sitting on a giant jelly filledndoughnut.\" He muttered. \"Nextnto a river of milk.\" I smiled at him. Reaching forward I stuck mynfingers in the jelly and handed it out to him. \"you want some?\" Inlooked at him, feeling guilty that I offered it to Lavagirl and notnhim. \"I'llnpass, I don't suck sweet things off of peoples fingers.\" Henmuttered, getting up, starting to walk away. Lavagirl got up andnchased after him. I looked down at the jelly on my fingers and put itnin my mouth. \"WellnMe-ew,\" I muttered, pushing myself to my feet, following afternthem, yet again feeling as if I got slapped in the face. I sure hopenthey don't treat everyone theynmeet like this.[Chapter 5] Chaptern4: Secret Love Max sat at hisndesk drawing sketches of Planet Drool, the clock ticking over head asnhe waited for the class to begin. The start of a new grade, the startnof swapping classes, the start of a whole new year. His third periodnclass was buzzing about three new students which caused him t o feelnslightly excited.[Chapter 6] Chapter 5: \"ThesenDreams aren't Max's\" I followed behindnSharkboy and Lavagirl. They didn't talk at all. Usually they werenchatting, but not right now. I nibbled on my lip, going nuts fromnhearing nothing but the light crunching of the powder under our feet,nand maybe even the occasional screaming from the children on thenrollercoaster far away. I wanted to talk. I wanted to talk my headnoff! I needed to get distracted! I stopped and looked down. Sharkboy was behindnLavagirl by an inch or two and I couldn't help but notice it,ntrying so hard to give myself something to do; now I wish that Inhadn't found this to do. I stared as it swung. My lips partednslightly. All though he was very thin, it was round, very wellnshaped. I sped up a little to get closer so that I could watch itnmore closely. My fingers twinged with the urge to reach forward andngrab it, to lay my fingers on it, to caress it with my palm…WHY! Mynears twitched irritably. I needed to give myself an excuse. Lookingndown I picked up a handful of powder and strolled up. Cranking mynhand back I let it go and threw the powder on his rump and thennreached forward, laying my hand across his right cheek. He stopped,nmy head slamming into his back, my fingers slightly tightening aroundnthe firm cushion. \"Excuse me!\" Henbarked, looking at me. He backed away from me and glared at me. \"Whatnare you doing?\" He snapped. I forgot. What had my plan been? \"Um…\" I looked around. I had to think of my plan! What wasnit! \"Oh ugh…\" I itched my chin, then remembered the powder.n\"You have powder on your butt, it's annoying me.\" I repliednwith a straight face. Wow, even I believed it. He looked at menkind of shocked. \"Really?\" Henlooked back as if he were trying to look at his own butt. I nodded. \"Why would I lienabout something like that?\" I replied with fake acid. He looked atnLavagirl and turned around. \"How bad is it?\"nHe questioned. She leaned over a bit and laughed. \"Wow, did you leave any on the ground?\" She teased. He glared at her. \"Just shut up andnget it off.\" He grumbled. I stepped forward and started to wipe mynhand down his cheeks, happy that he was actually giving me permissionnthis time. \"No seriously, didnyou leave any on the ground?\" I questioned, repeating Lavagirl'snquestion. He snorted. \"It was probably antrick so you could touch my butt.\" He muttered a snicker on hisnface. I rolled my eyes, continuing to wipe off all of the powder. Itnwas coming off harder than I thought it would be. \"Why would I want tondo that?\" I replied, my voice monotone. He brought his hand throughnhis hair. \"Because I'm thenking.\" He replied proudly. I rolled my eyes and pinched his rightncheek with my fingernails. He screamed and jumped away, his handnrubbing his cheek furiously. He glared at me. \"Ouch!\" I stood upnstraight and walked by him. \"Shush and follownLord of the Shrimp.\" Lavagirl laughed and followed me as I walkednaway from him. \"That hurt more thannLavagirl.\" I heard him mutter behind me which brought a smile to mynface. I continued walking until the powder stopped. I stopped andnlooked down at the straight drop off between dirt and powder. \"Wow, I think your Max needs to know how to blend better.\" I muttered. A glassncup flew by my face. I looked after it. There was a golden likenliquid inside of it, little golden wings on it fluttering. \"Whatnthe?\" I stopped and looked at it closer. Another one flew by ournfaces, then another. \"What is thisnplace?\" Lavagirl questioned, looking at the now hundreds of flyingnglasses. \"Beats me, but itndoesn't smell to pretty here.\" Sharkboy replied, his nosenscrunched up. I looked around and caught a large Neon sign that said Martini Vill . I gasped. Martini Vill ? I looked back atnLavagirl and Sharkboy questioningly. \"Your Max dreams ofnAlcohol?\" I felt my heart throb as I asked it, my eyebrowsnfurrowed. They looked at each other with wide eyes then both lookednback at me and shouted. \"No!\" Sharkboynstepped forward. \"Max isn't oldnenough to drink!\" He snarled. \"On top of that Maxnis a good boy! He'd never dream of something this disgusting!\"nLavagirl cried out. I shook my head. \"Then why is thisnhere!\" I squealed back, my heart seeming heavy. \"These Dreams aren'tnMax's\" She replied, shaking her head. Sharkboy took a deepnbreath. \"Whose dreams arenthey?\" I whispered. Behind me the sound of shouting could be heard.nI whirled around in time to catch a girl run out of the building thenNeon sign was hanging on with a glass bottle. A tall woman with blacknhair ran after her, her back twisted, her arms long, scraggilynlooking, her nails long and chipped. The girl screamed as the femalendemon caught up to her. Grabbing the girls hair with her long rakenlike fingernails, the woman pulled her back and whirled her around. \"Sharkboy!\"nLavagirl whimpered, stepping forward to help the girl. He put his armnout, just staring in horror. The woman pulled her hand back andnsnapped it against the girls face repeatedly. I gasped, Lavagirlnturned away, Sharkboy's eyes shutting tightly, I was left to starenat it. She slapped the young girl repeatedly until the girls grip onnthe bottle was too great. The bottle shattered, sending shards ofnglittering bottle to the dark ground. The woman let the girlngo, letting her fall to the ground. Turning the woman trudged away,nher long nails scraping across the ground. I waited until the door tonthe building was shut again. Before I knew it, my feet were carryingnme full speed towards the girl laying on the ground. \"Miu!\" Sharkboynscreamed, chasing after me. I reached the girls side and dropped tonmy knees, rolling her over. Grabbing her creamy, blonde hair I movednit out of her face. My heart stopped as I gazed at the face, a gaspnescaping, my breathing caught in my throat. Sharkboy and Lavagirl rannup next to me. They both gasped as they stopped. \"Miu.\" Sharkboynwhispered, his voice quivering. I held my hand out, my fingersnquivering wildly as I dragged my fingertips down the soft face, hernblue eyes staring up at the dark, cloud covered sky. \"Miu, what isnthis?\" Sharkboy questioned, but I didn't hear him, instead Inclosed my eyes and continued to drag my hand over the face, hernface…my face.[Chapter 7] Chapter 6: Emotion I ran through the trees to the nearestnriver. I had to escape this. I had to get away from it, I had to getnaway from her…I had to get away from me. I panted as I dodged thentrees, jumping over giant pop rocks through ankle high meltednchocolate and even through the pixie stick pits. \"Miu!\" Sharkboy called behind me.nHe was following me, trying to get me to stop. Lavagirl had stayednbehind, behind in the sugar lands trying to get the image of the deadngirl out of her head. I didn't listen, I just kept running.nReaching the edge of the ocean I ran out. My skin burned as I wadednin to my waist. I wanted to get out. I didn't want to be herenanymore. Sharkboy grabbed my wrist and yanked me back. I screamed andnfell backwards, being engulfed by shallow water. I just laid there. Indidn't want to get back up. I clenched my eyes together tightly,nletting go of all of my air bubbles. The feeling of cloves on mynwrists forced me to the bottom all together. My eyes snapped open.nSharkboy was right above me, his eyes staring at me seriously, hisnhands wrapped around my wrists tightly. I squeaked and brought my legs back tonkick him, but I was too slow under the water. He moved easily andncontinued to pin me there. I brought my other foot back to kick himnaway from me as the water suddenly swept back away from land. Inopened my mouth to scream as we were ripped out towards the middle bynthe tide, a sharp rock dug at my back, catching the bottom of myntattered dress. Sharkboy let go. Suddenly in a huge wave we werencarried up and deposited on land. I gasped, my hair sticking to mynbody. I pushed myself to my hands and knees and coughed. Sharkboy rannto my side and started to pat my back. \"Why can't you leave me alone!\"nI screamed, pushing him away from me. He looked at me with wide eyesnas I stood in front of him. He closed his eyes, his lips puckered asnif he had just eaten a lemon. I looked at him confused, then lookedndown. My dress was gone! And the only thing covering me was my wetnhair! I screamed and threw myself to the ground, covering myself withnmy arms. \"Where's my dress!\" I screamed at him. He shook hisnhead. \"How am I supposed to know! It'snnot like I stripped you naked!\" He hollered, keeping hisneyes shut. \"Well you're the King of thenOcean ! You're supposed to know what's in your waters, andnright now, that's where my dress it!\" I snarled. He stood up andnwalked over to the water's edge. Putting his fingers in his mouthnhe whistled. A few moments later, two large fins showed up. Two hugenshark heads popped up. \"Yes my king?\" The larger onenquestioned. \"did you guys happen to find andress?\" Sharkboy asked, looking at them desperately. The sharksnlooked at each other then back at their king. \"No your highness, why?\" The sharknasked again. Sharkboy looked back at me. \"She lost it just now.\" He justnstared at me. Too long. I grabbed a rock and threw it at him, hittingnhim in the head. \"Ouch!\" He screamed, rubbing his head. \"Turn your head you perv!\" Inhissed. He looked away from me. The sharks looked at each other thennback at their king. \"She is a handful; we'll searchnfor it my lord.\" They said. Sharkboy nodded. \"Please hurry before I getnthe urge to drown myself.\" He muttered. I chucked another rock atnhis head. He inhaled through his teeth, rubbing the back of his head.nThe sharks turned and went back out into the ocean. Turning he camenback up on land and sat next to me, looking out over the water. I satnthere with my arms crossed, my wet hair covering everything that wasnimportant. I hugged my knees to my chest and stared out over thenwater. I didn't want to be here like this. Not right now. I felt sonhelpless. I felt so…weak. I looked away from the ocean andnshivered. A cold wind blew in from the middle of the ocean, chillingnme to the bone. My teeth chattered. Next to me Sharkboy let off ansigh and scotched over, wrapping his arm around me. I screamed andnshoved him away, my face turning red. \"What are you doing!\" I squealed,nmy heart racing. \"I'm trying to stop your teethnfrom chattering and driving me crazy!\" He barked. I looked at him.nHe was trying to help me. I felt my face soften as I pushed myselfnback up and close to him. He held his breath slightly and wrapped hisnarm around my shoulders again. The heat went straight though hisnclothes, warming up all flesh that touched his. I let off a soft moannand pushed myself against his chest, knocking him over backwards, mynurgent desire for heat keeping me from thinking things through. Henwrapped his arms around me and grunted underneath me. I laid my headnon his chest, listening to the fast pace of his heart. I looked up atnhim confused. \"Sharkboy? Are you ok?\" Inquestioned. He nodded. \"Yeah you're…heavy.\" Henmuttered. I shifted so that I wasn't laying on him all the way andnclosed my eyes, listening to his heart pound. \"Sharkboy?\" Inwhispered after minute or so of silence. \"Yeah?\" He questioned back,nlooking down at me. \"I'm sorry.\" He didn't saynanything. \"For what?\" He asked finally. \"For everything. For running fromnyou, for throwing the rocks at you…for touching your butt and lyingnabout it. I did want to touch it.\" I whispered, hiding my face innmy hands on his chest. \"I knew it.\" He muttered. I glarednat him. I was expecting something else, something a little more heartnfelt like…it's ok. He sat up, keeping me in his arms. I pullednaway from him, my arms still wrapped around me. The sun was goingndown. \"I should find some fire wood to make a fire.\" He replied,nnot looking at me. He stood up and turned around, heading for thenwoods. I sat there and looked out over the ocean, out towards thenhorizon where the sky was turning pink, and orange with the settingnsun. \"How do I tell him?\" I whisperednto myself. Standing I walked out into the water and started to washnall of the sand off of me from the beach. I looked down and spotted anlarge crab with two large clam shells on it, a blanket of seaweednbeing dragged behind it. \"excuse me.\" I crouched down. The crabnturned around and looked at me. \"You don't mind if I use those donyou?\" I pointed at the seaweed. It moved one of it's eyes back. \"Oh not at all miss.\" She replied.nI smiled and nodded. Grabbing the seaweed she started to move hernclaws through it. \"I take it you need a dress to cover up with fornthat Young man?\" She chuckled. I nodded. Ingrabbed the shells. \"Would you happen to know wherenthere is string do you?\" I looked at her. She disappeared thennpopped back out and in her claw was a glittery ribbon, tied with anstring. I smiled and took it, unknotting it. \"Thank you.\" Inreplied. She started to run her claws through the seaweed again. \"Inknow I shouldn't ask strangers of this, but I need advice.\" Inwhispered, tying my hair back with a ribbon. She looked at me. \"Anything dear.\" I stopped andnlooked back at the woods to make sure he wasn't coming back out. \"I…I think I…like him.\" Inreplied. She laughed. \"Oh, you have developed feelings fornour king? How wonderful! He's never had a normal girl lovenhim before. It's a wonder he still tolerates girls. It must feel sonstrange for him to be able to touch a woman without being burned.\"nShe explained. She handed me the seaweed. Standing I held it up andnsaw that it was knitted into a mid thigh length, silky lookingnstrapless dress. \"He does love Lavagirl though. Infeel like scum for liking him, especially when we're so different,nand how they can't touch.\" I whispered, sliding it on over mynhead. \"It is fair game sweetie. That girlncannot have him for every time they touch she hurts him, plus, you'rena sweetie, he'll really like you.\" She continued. I pulled thendress into place and adjusted it. \"But Lavagirl is so kind.\" Inreplied, pulling my hair out of the dress. \"But she'll only hurt him. Justntell him how you feel and go from there.\" She turned and darted outninto the ocean. I stood there and watched after her, two shells and anstring in my hand. I looked down at them. Reaching back I grabbed thenribbon and looked at it. It was beautiful. Red. Taking the string Intied my hair back with it. Using the ribbon, I started to weave itnabout the shells. \"Miu, I'm back!\" Sharkboynhollered. I turned around and looked at him shocked. He was carryingna large log while carting behind him and old sack of sticks. \"Welcome back!\" I hollered back,nmy cheeks turning hot. How could I feel this way for him? We'd onlynknown each other for a few short hours. I turned back towards mynshell until the pearl white sands were lit up by the warm glow of anfire. I turned around and made my way up. He was sitting on the lognthat he placed down as a bench on one side of the fire. I walkednaround and sat in the sand across from him. I sat in silence as Incontinued to fiddle with the shells. \"You know,\" Sharkboy started. \"Youncan sit next to me.\" He informed me. I looked up at him. He wasnstaring at me seriously, his eyes glistening from the fire. My heartnstarted to dance in my chest. How could I not love him? I pushednmyself to my feet and walked around sitting next to him on the log. Incontinued to fiddle with the shells, not saying at word or looking atnhim. \"You found a dress?\" He questioned, breaking the silence,nadding more sound into the night air than the crackling of the firenand the sound of chirping cricket like creatures. \"Huh?\" I looked up at him. \"Ohnyeah!\" I looked back down and leaned back. He nodded. \"Looks good, where did you find it?\"nHe asked. I shrugged my shoulders, looking down at my toy. \"A crab miss made it for me.\" Inreplied, looking up at him, squinting slightly. He nodded. \"Looks good.\" He trailed off. Indidn't say anything. I felt my flesh jump as I sat next to him. Incouldn't be so close to him, but I didn't want to move away. Inwanted to wrap my arms around him; yet, I wanted to be the onenembraced. \"What's that?\" He asked, pointing at my shells. Inlooked down and opened my hands, letting the shells fall down. \"A charm.\" I replied simply. \"Inbelieve that two very nice clams who loved each other left thesenshells behind.\" I replied. He looked at me confused, interested innwhat I was saying. \"Why do you say that?\" Henquestioned. I flipped the shells and looked at them carefully. \"They're shaped like hearts, andnthey were found so close together. People who love each other arenalways close.\" I looked up at him, my words sticking. He looked atnme, his eyes connecting with mine. I looked away from him, mynbreathing speeding up. Taking the ribbon I untied it and lifted itnup. He looked at it and raised his left arm, putting it forward. Inreached forward and tied it around his wrist. He looked at thenshells, his eyes glistening. \"Hopefully you'll find someone younlove, and you'll never be separated from her.\" I whispered,nwatching as he looked at them. He smiled and looked at me. \"Thanks.\" He replied. I nodded andnlooked into the fire once more. \"But, I think I already foundnsomeone I love.\" He replied. Here we go, the ultimate heart break,nwhere he'd admit his love fore Lavagirl. Reaching over he laid hisnhand on mine. I looked down at it, then at him. \"It's weird…Inthought it was fear I felt for you that made me jumpy around you.\"nHe explained. I held my breath. He nibbled on his bottom lip. Henclosed his eyes and leaned forward. My heart raced, but I didn'tnhesitate. Closing my eyes I leaned forward and pressed my lipsnagainst his. He grabbed my arm and pulled me into his arms. Grabbingnthe bottom of his shirt, he pulled it up over his head, his eyesnintense on mine. I gasped as he kissed me again. \"I want to shownyou exactly how I feel for you.\" He whispered. Closing myneyes, he lowered me back into the shadows. This was more than andream. This was paradise.[Chapter 8] Chaptern7: Oh no Inwoke up, my eyes fluttered open, my head resting on Sharkboy's barenchest. I reached down and laid my hand on his which was placed on mynbare waist. I felt good. I felt great. I closed my eyes until I heardna snarl. I jumped and sat up, turning around in time to see glowingncrimson flames enter the woods. \"Uhnoh.\" I squeaked. Pushing myself to my knees I grabbed Sharkboy andnstarted to shake him back and forth. \"Sharkboy wake up!\" Insquealed. He pushed me away sleepily and rolled over. \"Fivenmore minutes.\" He muttered lazily, burring his face into the sand.nI extended my fingers, my nails growing, I stuck them into his rump.nHe screamed and jumped up, his hands over his butt. He looked at me,nhis eyebrows furrowed. \"What did you do that for!\" He yelled atnme. I stood up and grabbed his clothes, slamming them into his chest. \"Nontime for that, we're in deep trouble.\" I replied, panicking. \"Why?\"nI cocked an eyebrow, watching as I scrambled to put my dress on. \"Lavagirlnsaw us naked.\" I replied. He gasped. \"Arenyou serious!\" He whimpered. I nodded and pulled my hair out of thenback of my dress. Scrambling he threw his clothes on and headedntowards the woods, following the glass footsteps from the meltednsand. We caught up to her where we had left her. She was sitting on anrock, her arms crossed. Her face was red. She looked so angry.n\"Lavagirl.\" Sharkboy hollered, breaking through the opening. Shenstood up and whirled around. She stomped towards us. Both of usnstopped and started to back away, but she was only after one of us. \"Whatnare you thinking! You…\" She puffed her cheeks out, trying to findnsomething to say. I didn't know who she was talking to until shencranked her hand back and slammed it across my face. A loud hissnscreamed from her touch, deafening me. The heat seared my skin as Inspun away. \"Who do you think you are barging in on our life! On ournrelationship! How dare you steal him from me!\" She screamed, herneyes turning red. I pushed myself to my feet and started to back awaynfrom her as her hands caught on fire. I gasped. I shook my head. \"b-but…Inlove him.\" I whimpered. Her face warped. Screaming she threwnfireballs at me. Screaming I dodged it, the ground where I wasnstanding turning black. \"You'rennot allowed to love him!\" She screamed, throwing another one at me.nShe had gone nuts! She was insane! I spun out of the way and chargednat her. I had to get her to stop. Just before I got to her, thenground opened up beneath us. I stopped and looked down. Screaming, wenslid down this long, ice covered tunnel, Lavagirl melting the icenbehind us. Reaching the end of the tunnel, we went straight up thisnlarge chute and flew across a bottomless pit and landed on the othernside. Inscreamed as I hit, trying my hardest to keep myself on the path.nSliding off of it would not keep me alive. I screamed and sunk mynnails into the ice, the friction sending sparks into the air as we nonlonger slid over ice, but instead over rock. Suddenly, we werenairborne again. I gasped as I saw a large black hole coming up on us.nWhat was in there? Was it big enough? Sharkboy disappeared first,nthen the much heavier Lavagirl who had managed to end up in front ofnme in the long twisting slide of ice -which was probably why itnturned to rock. \"Ohnhell no!\" I screamed. Snapping my arms out. My nails caught thensides, my ribs smashing against the wall of the hole. I wheezed asnall of the air was knocked out of my lungs from the collision. Inlooked down behind me, my arms clutching at the at the sides of thenwall. There was a bright light below me. I swallowed hard and sunk mynnails into the ice hole in attempts to keep myself from falling to myndeath. A loud crackling reached my ears. I gasped and looked forward.nThe ice was breaking away! Pulling away from the rest of the wall,nthe large chunk that I was so helplessly clinging to fell away andnhurdled down into the dark hole of nothingness, taking me with it. Inscreamed as I came up on the light quickly, the passed through itsnbarrier. I landed in a large bath full of ice cubes, being submergednin water. I hissed, the cold water gushing down my throat, freezingnmy lungs and stomach. My bottom hit the bottom. Closing my mouth andneyes, I forced my feet down and pushed my half frozen body to thensurface. \"Well,nwell, well, what have we here?\" A deep voice questioned. I clung tonthe side and looked up, shivering so hard the chattering of my teethnsounded like the clicking of those clam things that those Spanishndancers use…flamenco dancers? There was a boy sitting on a large,nicy throne. He had long, shoulder length ice blue hair, his bangsnpushed over to cover one eye. He wore a long, ice gemmed light bluencloak, his lips light purple. A beaded head dress was dangling downnaround his forehead, but his eyes were contrasting with the rest ofnhis beautiful, icy appearance. Bright red like fire, so hot theynseemed as if they could melt the ice around us. Pushingnhimself to his feet, large balls of spinning ice beads and liquidnhydrogen balls rotated around him. He stepped forward, walking closernto us, but stopped halfway as another voice intruded in on thensilence. \"Oh!nHow unfair you do this to them my brother!\" Behind him a red, fierynfigure emerged, melting away the ice as he stepped forward. He lookednjust like his \"brother\". His hair was slightly shorter, spikier,nwild red flames on his head as his wild red lips curled into a smile.nA red beaded headdress occupied the same place his brothers did, butnhis clothes were significantly different. Instead of the tie aroundnice blue shawl that was wrapped around his flawless, beaded barenlegs, his was a red, fiery shall wrapped around his waist, belownencasing the upper part of his thighs were a pair of tight, blacknshorts. His brother turned to stare at his \"hot\" brother with hisnfiery eyes, the upper part of his body becoming visible to my eyes.nHe didn't wear a shirt, instead his body was covered in littlenglistening frozen gems. \"Youndon't care.\" The ice prince replied. His fiery laughed in replynand stopped next to him, his long flaming cloak flowing to a stop,nhis chest as well being exposed. The same, little red, ruby gems onnhis flesh. \"True,nI don't.\" He chortled. Snapping his arm out, fire flew from hisnfingerless, ruby encrusted, red, elbow length gloved arm towards us.nI gasped as I was engulfed in flame. The blast knocked me back intonthe water which is what I was truly thankful for -wow, I nevernthought I could ever say that about water! The shifting of the water caused my heart tonstop. Suddenly all of it disappeared and I fell to the ground,nlanding in a pile of ice cubes and wet snow. The boy laughed, pullingnhis hand back to his side. Sharkboy rushed to my side as I sputtered.nHow long had he been there? Where had he been. \"Hey!nDon't you think it's kind of rude to single out a cat ?nI mean first with water, now fire?\" Sharkboy hollered, helping mensit up. The flaming boy smiled, his eyes piercing blue like icencrystals. How odd. \"Andnwhat about you? Can we single you out?\" He snickered, starting to make his way forward. \"Inhave a better chance of defending myself then she does.\" Sharkboynadmitted. The boy laughed. \"Indon't chose my opponents on skills, just so you know.\" Hensnickered. \"I burn everything in my way!\" he slammed his handsntogether, a large gust of flames shooting out at us. I screamed asnSharkboy pushed himself in front of me. This was going to kill usnboth! \"Don'tnyou dare hurt Sharky!\" Lavagirl stepped in the way, pushing hisnbeam of flames back with a blast of her own. \"Lavagirl!\"nSharkboy hollered, looking back over his shoulder. The boy stopped,nthe flames dieing down, a shocked look on his face. His icy brothernlooked at his expression and then at Lavagirl. \"Honestly,nmust you two destroy everything ?\"nHe snorted. Sticking his hand out, he started to mend the meltednpathway between them. \"Unbelievable.\"nHis the flame king whispered, completely baffled. He walked forward,nswiftly until he was standing right in front of Lavagirl. He held hisnhand up, just inches from her face. She pulled away a half a step,nglowering at him and stared at his hand as he brought it closer tonher. He brushed his fingertips across her cheek. She closed her eyes,nwaiting for him to pull away but he progressed and pressed his palmnagainst her cheek. \"Unbelievable,\" He whispered again, his eyesnnarrowing. Infelt Sharkboy's muscles jump below me. My eyes shot up to him. Henwas glaring at them, his sharp teeth visible, his eyes pure black.nWith a snarl he dropped me, my head hitting the rock down below menwith a crack. I grunted and rubbed the back of my skull as I watchednas he stood up and stomped over to him. I whimpered. \"Don'tntouch her!\" Sharkboy demanded, shoving him away. Smoke rose fromnhis hand, but he gritted his teeth and pretended like it didn'tnphase him. Lavagirl shoved Sharkboy away, leaving slightly charrednhand marks on the boy's back. \"Sharkboy!nStop it!\" She growled. She stepped forward, a smile on her face asnshe looked up into the boys ice blue eyes. \"Touch me again.\" Shensmiled. He chuckled lightly and laid his hand on her cheek again.nSharkboy huffed and crossed his arms. I felt anger roll through me.nWhat was I to him anyway! Grunting I stood up and walked up behindnhim, my lips pushed into a hard line. Clenching my right fist Intapped his left shoulder. He turned around and looked at me but justnas he was turning I hauled off and punched him in the face, knockingnhim to the ground. He looked at me shocked. \"Cod!\"nI hissed and stepped over him, feeling that it was better to standnnext to someone who would keep my flaming anger cool. Lavagirlncontinued to look into the males eyes, her hand soon finding it'snway to his face where she dragged her fingertips down the softnlooking flesh and through his flaming locks. \"Sonyour name is Lavagirl?\" He whispered, a loving, obsessed smile onnhis face. She smiled at him, her eyes narrow with love as well. \"Yes.\"nShe whispered, sounding almost breathless. \"What is your name?\"nShe asked, her eyes almost closed. With a gentle tone he whisperednhis name so that it almost sounded like the crackling of a camp fire. \"Phoenix.\"nShe smiled, almost seeming week at the knees. He pulled away butngrabbed her hand, looking back at his brother. \"That is my brothernShiva\" He replied. She nodded and proceeded to tell him of us. \"That'snSharkboy, and that's Miu.\" She pointed at me. I bowed my headnslightly, still ticked off that Sharkboy was acting like a jerk. Hensmiled. \"Inthink the kitten will be in need of a new…dress.\" He raise anneyebrow, looking at me, his smile cemented on his face. He was justnlike her, always smiling. I looked back and saw that my dress wasnripped all up the back and part of the front. I whimpered as my tailnhung down in between my legs. \"ShallnI…find something to make her dress with?\" Shiva questioned, hisnface in a permanent frown. He was the opposite of his brother.nPhoenix nodded, his white teeth glittering in the pale blue light.nLavagirl looked at me and shrugged. \"Inguess it would be a good thing, I don't think she feels comfortablenwith her bottom hanging out.\" He nodded and turned to me. \"follownme.\" He replied. I looked back at the staring lovebirds and thensulking Sharkboy who was still sitting on the ground, his headnpractically in between his knees as he held his hand on his cheek,nshaking his head. I nodded and turned around, following the icenprince to the back of the room where Phoenix had come out of. Passingnthrough a doorway, we came out into this huge, bedroom looking area,na door on the opposite side of the room was made of ice, and behindnit, was a red glow. It must have been Phoenix's room. \"Staynhere.\" He demanded. I stood still as he disappeared behind a largencurtain of beaded ice. I looked around. That's all his room was, anlarge group of floating ice crystals and off towards the center was anlarge dip of ice with ice blue blankets. His bed I was guessing. Offnto the left of the large room was a huge vanity, and on the exactnopposite side of the room was a fire place. I looked at itnincredulously, but what was burning inside of it wasn't fire, itnwas a blue flame that gave off the little ice beads. He returned ancouple seconds later with folded cloth in his arms. \"What'snbehind that door?\" I asked, pointing off across the room at the icendoor with the red behind it. He stopped and looked, handing out thencloth to me. \"that is my brother's room.\" He replied. I tooknthe cloth from him and unfolded it. There was a long, beautiful lightnblue cloth. He turned around and took a couple steps away. I openednmy mouth to say that I didn't feel comfortable to get undressed andndressed in the same room with him when a large wall of thick ice slidnaround me. I squeaked. There were clothing hooks -or what looked tonbe clothing hooks- on the walls. I looked down at the dress andnsighed. Reaching up I hung the dress up on the hook and progressednforward to take my torn dress off. \"I must apologize.\" Henreplied. I stopped, looking up at the wall where he had been before. \"Why?\"nI questioned, my eyebrows furrowing in the middle. \"Inshouldn't have been so rude to you, it's not what someone of mynstature should have been doing.\" He replied. I could hear thenpatting of his bare feet as he slowly walked across his bedroomnfloor. I looked down at my feet as I let my dress fall to my ankles. \"Whatnstature is that?\" I asked, quietly. \"Inam a prince of the ice,\" He replied. \"But I have become bitternover the years.\" He replied. I grabbed the icy dress and slid itnon. It was an off-the-shoulder strapped dress with long sleeves thatnhad an icy ring at the tips. I put the rings on and smoothed out thenstomach of the dress. It showed off the belly but it had the sides,nand for the back, it was held together with black ribbon, like ancorset. The skirt on the right was cut above my hip but once itnreached the inside of my right hip it dropped down into the skirt andnwas tied with the same black ribbon as on the back. The walls fellnaway, causing me to jump. He was staring at me, his icy blue lipsnpulled into a straight line. \"Here,\" He held out a couple boxes.nI took them and opened the largest one. I pulled out a couple of thencrystal beads and looked at them confused. \"Whatnare they?\" I asked, looking at him confused, suddenly they all shotnfrom the box and rushed to my legs. I screamed and jumped back, butnit didn't stop them until they were all in place. They sent out anvery thin line and connected themselves together around my legs. Inlooked at them questioningly, then realized they were the samenleggings he had. \"Opennthe other box.\" He replied monotonously. Looking down at the othernone, I held it tightly in my hands, hesitating to open it. Taking andeep breath I laid my hand on top of it and pulled the cover off.nAgain more crystals fluttered from the box only this time to my face.nI held my breath and closed my eyes tightly, waiting for the pain ofnthem, but I felt nothing. \"You can open your eyes.\" he replied. Indid. He smiled. Pulling away he brought up a large ice wall, in itnwas my reflection. I stared at it, my curly, cream colored hair wasnperfectly straight now -probably from all of the abuse it's taken-nand upon my head was a beautiful beaded headdress that made me looknlike a queen. Wait! A Queen![Chapter 9] Note: I'm so sorry this is taking me so long to update. I want to get all of the stories I started finished. I just...lost interest in writing this one after my father died in 2009 but he always told me to finish what I started. So I'm finishing this story for him. RIP Daddy I love you always Chapter 8: If I said no… I sat at the table, my eyes on the frozen foods in front of me. Ice fist swam in little glass bowls. By my side was the ice prince with a satisfied half grin on his face. Lavagirl and Phoenix were still looking into each other's eyes lovey dovey like as they ate, running their hands across each other's faces. It was shocking how fast she moved on. I dared steal a glance at Sharkboy, my heart throbbing in my chest as the anger started to boil again. He didn't even look at me as he bent his fork with his right hand. He didn't even notice I was there. \"I would like to give a new toast to our company, for I have finally found a bride.\" Shiva smiled tapping his spoon against the crystal glass at his side. \"What? So soon brother?\" This announcement was enough to cause both Lavagirl and Phoenix to break eye contact, looking up at the ice prince. \"Yes, I feel that after looking long and hard for a bride, finally one has come into my midst with promising qualities.\" I looked down at the table, my heart racing. What was I going to say? I wasn't ready to become a bride let alone become a queen. I didn't even know what to do about Sharkboy at the moment let alone agree to a marriage! \"Then who is the woman?\" Phoenix sounded skeptical about it as if he was hoping it wasn't me. \"Miu.\" The prince looked down at me, his hand on my shoulder. His flesh was cold to the touch, causing my eyes to close. I knew that that was going to happen, and I wished liked never before that he hadn't meant me. \"This cat ?\" Phoenix pointed in my direction. I looked up at him hurt. It seemed as if it was turning into a running habit of being called a cat and nothing else. \"Yes. A creature of beauty, cats are. Strong, instinctual, and able to survive harsh weathers. How else would I be able to touch her? She is indeed a creature of great standings.\" He sat back down, going back to eating. \"I supposed cats are strong.\" \"Not to mention but they're great pets.\" Lavagirl smiled at Phoenix. He smiled back nodding. \"Yes they are, they are wonderful pets.\" I couldn't stand it. \"Excuse me.\" I stood up, pushing the chair away. \"Where are you going?\" Shiva looked at me, his forehead crinkled. \"It's…a bit stuffy in here. I need some air\" I lied. Nodding he turned and clapped his hands. A pink ribbon like path led the way from the table do the doorway and down the hall. \"You may follow that path to the Atrium if you desire, I find that that is a good area to sit and breathe.\" His smile stretched across his face in a warm way. I stared at the smile for a moment. Though it seemed sincere, I felt in my heart that it was fake. Fake and easy to shatter like the ice around me. Turning I made my way from the room. The moment the doors behind me closed I ran. I didn't know where I was going, but I needed to escape. The fear and some other emotions inside of me pushed me on. I was running from something unknown. Something I didn't understand. Fear? No, I don't think it was fully fear that caused me to flee from the room. Sadness? No, though I was over flowing with sadness, I don't think it was fully that. It's betrayal my dear. An echoing voice rang off the walls. Gasping I pulled to a stop and looked around. Nothing. There was nothing in that hall with me. I panted my heart racing. Perhaps there was something in there? Perhaps there was someone in there, hidden in the ice and fire? No no darling , it spoke again. Not among the ice or fire. Not among the light or dark. \"Who are you!\" I screeched, that unknown emotion taking over again. Who am I? Suddenly the lights flickered. Darkness filled the room. The air in front of me shuttered like heat rising in the cold. A dark cloud filled the space, a pair of piercing red eyes staring into my eyes. It took a solid form. A girl with black curled hair, cat ears, a fluffy tail and grey skin with a black tattered dress. Around her neck was a collar that said upon the tag 'Malis.' Who am I? I am you. She spoke her voice haunting, black veins crawling across her grey skin. I gasped, taking a step back. She followed me, taking a step forward to close the gap. \"What do you want with me?\" I whimpered. Me? I wish to be happy. The only way for me to be happy, is to make you happy and I doubt you know how troublesome that is. She crossed her arms, letting her head fall to the side, her neck crackling like the sound of rocks tumbling across each other. \"Well…\" I stopped, shaking. Her presence was intimidating. \"I… guess it would be…very troublesome.\" I looked down. You think? She sniveled at me. As she spoke her lips never moved. It seemed as if she didn't need to open her mouth, speaking with me through her thoughts. Her eyes were large, almost lidless as she looked around the room. \"What kinds of things do you like?\" I questioned, feeling slightly sorry for her. She wasn't allowed to be happy because I wasn't. Stopping she looked at me, her lips pulling into a grin. I like money, and attention, and boys. She sneered, her teeth baring, red fangs under her grey lips. I like fire, and Ice, and heaven and hell. I love it all, happiness, and sadness, death and life, darkness and light! I want it all, but you! She slammed a finger in my direction. I stared at her. You like nothing! You don't like boys, you don't like fire, or ice, you fear the dark! You hate the light! You are abstinent from happiness and avoid sadness! You feel Heaven is beyond your reach and you fear hell! You couldn't care less about money, but there's one thing you and I share . She stopped, her grin switching to one of cruel hatred. \"Wh-what's that?\" I squeaked, backing away from her again. She followed me. Attention, so, what do you say we give you what you want! She shrieked, vanishing into a black cloud. Screaming I whirled around and made my way down the hall, running as fast as I could, fear engulfing me but it was too late. The shadow enveloped me, black tendrils wrapping around my arms, waist, neck and legs pulling me to a stop. I shrieked, thrashing, trying to get away from her. A sickening crackling noise filled the room as the tendrils forced themselves into my nostrils and down my throat. My vision flared red as I choked, my lungs heaving. I tried to scream but failed. Agony flowed through me like a stick through water. Hitting the floor I thrashed, my eyes rolling back in my skull. Everything flashed white, then faded to black as the air about me became cold. The pain dissipated, leaving me in silence and darkness.","LastChapter":"Note: I'm so sorry this is taking me so long to update. I want to get all of the stories I started finished. I just...lost interest in writing this one after my father died in 2009 but he always told me to finish what I started. So I'm finishing this story for him. RIP Daddy I love you always Chapter 8: If I said no… I sat at the table, my eyes on the frozen foods in front of me. Ice fist swam in little glass bowls. By my side was the ice prince with a satisfied half grin on his face. Lavagirl and Phoenix were still looking into each other's eyes lovey dovey like as they ate, running their hands across each other's faces. It was shocking how fast she moved on. I dared steal a glance at Sharkboy, my heart throbbing in my chest as the anger started to boil again. He didn't even look at me as he bent his fork with his right hand. He didn't even notice I was there. \"I would like to give a new toast to our company, for I have finally found a bride.\" Shiva smiled tapping his spoon against the crystal glass at his side. \"What? So soon brother?\" This announcement was enough to cause both Lavagirl and Phoenix to break eye contact, looking up at the ice prince. \"Yes, I feel that after looking long and hard for a bride, finally one has come into my midst with promising qualities.\" I looked down at the table, my heart racing. What was I going to say? I wasn't ready to become a bride let alone become a queen. I didn't even know what to do about Sharkboy at the moment let alone agree to a marriage! \"Then who is the woman?\" Phoenix sounded skeptical about it as if he was hoping it wasn't me. \"Miu.\" The prince looked down at me, his hand on my shoulder. His flesh was cold to the touch, causing my eyes to close. I knew that that was going to happen, and I wished liked never before that he hadn't meant me. \"This cat ?\" Phoenix pointed in my direction. I looked up at him hurt. It seemed as if it was turning into a running habit of being called a cat and nothing else. \"Yes. A creature of beauty, cats are. Strong, instinctual, and able to survive harsh weathers. How else would I be able to touch her? She is indeed a creature of great standings.\" He sat back down, going back to eating. \"I supposed cats are strong.\" \"Not to mention but they're great pets.\" Lavagirl smiled at Phoenix. He smiled back nodding. \"Yes they are, they are wonderful pets.\" I couldn't stand it. \"Excuse me.\" I stood up, pushing the chair away. \"Where are you going?\" Shiva looked at me, his forehead crinkled. \"It's…a bit stuffy in here. I need some air\" I lied. Nodding he turned and clapped his hands. A pink ribbon like path led the way from the table do the doorway and down the hall. \"You may follow that path to the Atrium if you desire, I find that that is a good area to sit and breathe.\" His smile stretched across his face in a warm way. I stared at the smile for a moment. Though it seemed sincere, I felt in my heart that it was fake. Fake and easy to shatter like the ice around me. Turning I made my way from the room. The moment the doors behind me closed I ran. I didn't know where I was going, but I needed to escape. The fear and some other emotions inside of me pushed me on. I was running from something unknown. Something I didn't understand. Fear? No, I don't think it was fully fear that caused me to flee from the room. Sadness? No, though I was over flowing with sadness, I don't think it was fully that. It's betrayal my dear. An echoing voice rang off the walls. Gasping I pulled to a stop and looked around. Nothing. There was nothing in that hall with me. I panted my heart racing. Perhaps there was something in there? Perhaps there was someone in there, hidden in the ice and fire? No no darling , it spoke again. Not among the ice or fire. Not among the light or dark. \"Who are you!\" I screeched, that unknown emotion taking over again. Who am I? Suddenly the lights flickered. Darkness filled the room. The air in front of me shuttered like heat rising in the cold. A dark cloud filled the space, a pair of piercing red eyes staring into my eyes. It took a solid form. A girl with black curled hair, cat ears, a fluffy tail and grey skin with a black tattered dress. Around her neck was a collar that said upon the tag 'Malis.' Who am I? I am you. She spoke her voice haunting, black veins crawling across her grey skin. I gasped, taking a step back. She followed me, taking a step forward to close the gap. \"What do you want with me?\" I whimpered. Me? I wish to be happy. The only way for me to be happy, is to make you happy and I doubt you know how troublesome that is. She crossed her arms, letting her head fall to the side, her neck crackling like the sound of rocks tumbling across each other. \"Well…\" I stopped, shaking. Her presence was intimidating. \"I… guess it would be…very troublesome.\" I looked down. You think? She sniveled at me. As she spoke her lips never moved. It seemed as if she didn't need to open her mouth, speaking with me through her thoughts. Her eyes were large, almost lidless as she looked around the room. \"What kinds of things do you like?\" I questioned, feeling slightly sorry for her. She wasn't allowed to be happy because I wasn't. Stopping she looked at me, her lips pulling into a grin. I like money, and attention, and boys. She sneered, her teeth baring, red fangs under her grey lips. I like fire, and Ice, and heaven and hell. I love it all, happiness, and sadness, death and life, darkness and light! I want it all, but you! She slammed a finger in my direction. I stared at her. You like nothing! You don't like boys, you don't like fire, or ice, you fear the dark! You hate the light! You are abstinent from happiness and avoid sadness! You feel Heaven is beyond your reach and you fear hell! You couldn't care less about money, but there's one thing you and I share . She stopped, her grin switching to one of cruel hatred. \"Wh-what's that?\" I squeaked, backing away from her again. She followed me. Attention, so, what do you say we give you what you want! She shrieked, vanishing into a black cloud. Screaming I whirled around and made my way down the hall, running as fast as I could, fear engulfing me but it was too late. The shadow enveloped me, black tendrils wrapping around my arms, waist, neck and legs pulling me to a stop. I shrieked, thrashing, trying to get away from her. A sickening crackling noise filled the room as the tendrils forced themselves into my nostrils and down my throat. My vision flared red as I choked, my lungs heaving. I tried to scream but failed. Agony flowed through me like a stick through water. Hitting the floor I thrashed, my eyes rolling back in my skull. Everything flashed white, then faded to black as the air about me became cold. The pain dissipated, leaving me in silence and darkness.","Summary":" A Mistake. What's in a Name?

I watched this film with my little sis and lovednthe double play they did on phrases and the two meaning gig. None ofnthese characters are mine; I do not own them, blah, blah, blah. Sharkboy andnLavagirl, their last scene of the movie, walking down the beach Sharkboy snaked hisnarm around behind Lavagirl's back and rested his hand on hernshoulder. To his dismay he felt his hand scorch and flinched away. nLavagirl smiled and offered him her finger. He took it and theyncontinued to walk down the beach. He glanced over at her and sighed.n He knew at least the way he felt about her, he wished he could knownthe way she felt about him. He had been soooo jealous when she hadnbeen motherly to Max. He wanted more thannfriendship but didn't know how to ask, or what her answer would be.n She was to unpredictable; she could have an eruption at anytime. Itnwas one of the many qualities that he liked about her. Again hensighed, it was hopeless to make her something that she was not. nLavagirl had labeled his first sigh as a 'deep on thought' kindnof sigh, but the second time she knew something was wrong. He wasnher best friend she knew his signals and right now they were pointingnto troubled. \"What's the matter Sharkie?\" He smiled inwardly;nhe loved her nickname for him. He didn't want his face to betraynhis thoughts so he put on his best frown and looked at her,n\"Nothing.\" He growled. Lavagirl's mouth twitched, she knew henwas lying; he couldn't hide that from her. \"Then what's withnall the sighing?\" She asked, stopping on their trek to turn andnlook him in the eyes. Sharkboy glowered, \"I told you nothing, ok! nSo back off!\" He turned on his heel and stormed off down the beach.nIt was her turn to sigh, she knew he was hiding something but decidednto let it be. She knew he needed time alone so she walked back tontheir cave. When she was at the mouth of the cave she turned andnlooked back. He was in the ocean floating on his back in the waves. nShe felt tears coming in her eyes, which only increased her sadnessnas they sizzled and evaporated off her cheeks. She could never benwith him or a part of the world that he belonged to. If only shencould, then her feelings for him wouldn't be so dangerous. Sharkboy closed hisneyes and immediately saw her face. \"Lavagirl…\"\" he murmured.n He saw her hot pink hair and glowing skin. He wanted to touch itnbut found he could only gaze at her. \" Always just out of mynreach! \" He thought angrily. \" I've always gotten what Inwanted! If I wanted I worked for it, and I got it! \" He thoughtntriumphantly, but then it occurred to him as is grin turned to anfrown. \" Well, not everything. Not your father. \" Said anlittle voice in the back of his head. \" But Lavagirl will bendifferent! \" He thought desperately. The other voice sneered,n\" What makes you think so? She'll always be just like yournfather. Like you said, always just out of your reach! \" Hisneyes snapped open. The dream had been so much like the others, anconstant battle within him. He had been asleep for a while; dusk hadnturned into night as the light of a half moon shined down. He couldnsee a red flame off in the distance on a black blob on the horizon,nthe island form where he had drifted. He smiled, no matter how muchnhe insisted he could find his way back with his shark radar, shenalways stood out on the beach as a beacon. He started swimming innher direction, \" I'll just have to make it up as I go along. \"nHe thought as he focused on trying to get back to shore. Lavagirl searched thenwaves for her friend. She knew he would be able to find his way backnon his own, but she was worried. He had never stayed out that longnbefore. For one fleeting second she thought that maybe he had leftnher. Tears came to her eyes as she though to herself, \" Inwouldn't blame him \" She swallowed her tears and focused onntrying to find him. Finally she saw his dorsal fin streaking throughnthe waves. She let out the breath she had been holding. She waitednpatiently for him to surface, when he did she admired how the oceannwould roll off his neck and drip from his hair. Sometimes she enviednthe ocean and his closeness to him. He walked up to hernand grinned, \"Worried?\" he asked seeing her expression of relief. \"Yes!\" she saidnputting her hands on her hips. Then smiled, \"Are you better now?\"nshe asked. He looked down at the sand, hoping she hadn't seen thenlook in his eyes, \"Yes. I'm sorry I stayed out so long.\" Hentook a chance and glanced back up, he saw tears in her eyes. \"Whatnis it?\" he asked stepping forwards, concern spreading over hisnface. \"I-I thought you might of… might of left me.\" Shenmanaged, she was angry with herself for crying. Sharkboy felt guiltnstab every inch of him, \"No…no I couldn't ever leave you! Indon't want you to ever think that again!\" he said desperately. nHe stepped forward and took her face in his hands, and ignoring thenburning brushed away her tears with his thumbs. \"I am so sorrynLavagirl. Please don't cry!\" he now pulled away his hands, whichnshe took gently in her own. She gaped at the burns on his hands; thenburns he had took to comfort her. \"Oh Sharkie…come on, lets gontake care of these.\" She led him inside; oblivious to what wasngoing on inside Sharkboy's head.[Chapter 2] Okay next chapter,nthanks for your reviews. Again I do not own these characters. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ That night, afternLavagirl had bandaged his hands and they had eaten; she saidngoodnight and went off to her half of the cave. Sharboy stayed upnand looked at his hands. There was no way he could go in the waternlike this. He needed to be healed by tomorrow so he could continuento search for his father. He looked over at Lavagirl's end of thencave. Why did everything have to be so complicated! He stretchednand stood up. He didn't know what he was going to do all dayntomorrow. He had always gone out early in the morning and come backnlate at night. The cave had never really felt like a home, just anplace to come back to, to come back to Lavagirl. He walked over to hisnend of the cave and lay down on his bed of seaweed. He tossed andnturned for a while but couldn't sleep. He groaned as his handsnstarted throbbing again. He sat up and starred at them. He was justnwondering where Lavagirl had put the ointment she used on his burnsnwhen he saw her cross the cave quietly and walk out onto the beach. nHe stood up quickly and stalked out, not making a sound. When he gotnto the edge of the cave he peered out. There stood Lavagirl,nbrilliant in the moonlight. Her eyes were squinted shut, her nosenscrunched and fists clenched. She was obviously concentrating verynhard on something that he couldn't see. He would of laughed at thenface she was making had he not been sneaking. He was just about to gonout and ask her what she was doing when he heard her hold her breathnand walk towards the ocean. He stood their dumbstruck ash she dippednher toe in and then her foot. She bit her lip and then took two morensteps; she was up to her shins before Sharkboy snapped out of it.n\"LAVAGIRL! NO!\" he rushed out screaming as she spun around, shockndisplayed all over her face. \"Sharkiee?\" she said bewildered asnhe knocked into her and pushed her backwards onto the sand. She fellnbackwards and he fell on top of her. She lay there trying toncatch her breath while he pushed himself up. \"Lavagirl! What werenyou thinking? You could've killed yourself and then the ocean wouldnhave taken you and I would have never known where you went! Why werenyou…\"He stopped and looked down into her annoyed face. It wasnthen that he realized she wasn't burning him. \"What the?\" he saidnbewildered. She looked up at him with as much confusion on her facenas there was on his. I'm not burning you?\" she asked. \"No…\"nSharkboy said looking into her eyes. \"What were you doing?\" henasked moving his hand to sweep her hair out of her face. She blushed and lookednover his shoulder, not wanting to meet his eyes. \"I…I've beennsneaking out every night after you fell asleep. I've been forcingnmyself to cool enough to walk into the ocean. I used to only be ablento put in my toe…now I can go up to my waist! But if I'm notnburning you… maybe I can go all the way under!\" He just lookednat her and smiled. This was the closest he had ever been to hernbefore. \"You did this… for me?\" He asked unsure. She blushedneven deeper, he could feel her temperature rising in her face. So henpushed himself up and helped her to her feet. She looked him in theneyes, \"I did this for…us.\" She said nervously. He looked tooknher hand and then jumped back. \"Ow!\" he exclaimed. She was backnto normal. \"I'm sorry! I can't control it for long!\" shenlooked at the burnt bandages on his hands and regret flooded herneyes. He sighed and nodded to the cave. \"Lets go re-bandage them.\"nHe suggested. She smiled and nodded as they walked back into thencave. Okay, I know thisngoes against the movie with her only being able to col when shensleeps but screw the movie! So what did you think? Review!!!![Chapter 3] Okay next chapter!!! About my updates, I'll try to make them dailynbut not on weekends. Keep Reviewing!!!! Weeks later…. Sharkboy dove beneathnthe waves and swam out then looked back at the beach. Lavagirl wasnwalking in, slowly submersing herself beneath the waves. It hadntaken her a month just to get her head under the water. Sharkboynsmiled, she had come a long way. Lavagirl held hernbreath and went under. It felt so strange to feel the water rushingnover her, enveloping her. She resurfaced and grinned at Sharkboy whonhad swam over to help her. \"You look different with your hairnwet.\" He stated, smirking. She sat their treading water with ansmug look on her face. \"Funny, you look just as grumpy wet as youndo dry.\" She grinned splashing him and kicking off into the water. nShe had finally learned how to swim, thanks to Sharkie. Of course henwas still much faster than she was. He swam up underneath her andnsurfaced to face her, grinning. He splashed her backnas she giggled as she lay back to float on her back. Sharkboy justnshook his head. He was always taught to keep moving, but she seemedncontent to just lay still and let the ocean have her. \"Enjoyingnyourself?\" he asked sarcastically. As usual Lavagirl ignored hisnattitude. \"More than you know. I can see now why you love thenocean so much! But I have to get out soon.\" She mumbled. nSharkboy nodded, \"Okay. Hey,\" he grinned challengingly as shenlooked over at him. \"Wanna race?\" he asked. She just shook hernhead sadly. \"You'll win anyway. Besides…I'm um…I'mntired. Yeah, so I'll just make it their in my own time.\" Shenbegan to slowly swim away and Sharkboy watched her with suspiciousneyes. He knew something was wrong. She always agreed tonrace, always. She had been lying about being tired, he could tell bynher tone of voice. He started to wonder if she was sick. Once on shore Lavagirlnwalked straight to the cave. She only turned around when she wasnhalfway inside and couldn't feel Sharkboy's eyes on her anymore. nWhen she looked out at the beach she saw him, the boy she wanted morenthan anything to love. For him to love her back. She heated herselfnup to dry off. She watched him swim parallel to the beach, back andnforth, going out farther and farther. \" Always keep moving! nThat is the way of the sharks! \" He had told her once. Shencould feel him keep moving farther and farther away from her. Shenfelt the tears build in her eyes and forced her self to cool so thatnthey could fall. Maybe, just maybe if they did…she could cry awaynthe love she felt that he couldn't or wouldn't return. When Sharkboy was outnon the waves was when his mind was clearest. He thought of the onenthing he couldn't get off his mind…Lavagirl. She had been actingnstrange over the past few weeks that was for sure. But he didn'tnknow why, and he hated not knowing. He slapped his hand on thensurface of the water in frustration. He knew that he would have tonask Lavagirl to find out what was going on. So he struck out fornthe beach in determination. When he reached it he stomped to thencave and was bout to yell out her name when he heard it…the soundnof someone crying. And not justnsniffling, gasping, and sobbing. He walked towards Lavagirl's endnof the cave but found that his previous determination and confidencenhad left him. He backed off in confusion. There was only one personnwho could explain this. He jumped clawed a message on the cave wallnand then jumped on his bike and set out.[Chapter 4] Sorry about the story going whacko with typos. As you expressed,nyou're dying to know what's up with Lavagirl and where Sharkboynis going. You'll just have to read to see how many questions Inanswer! Sharkboy rode his bikento the dock where he had met Max. His friend would normally come tonthe dock on his free afternoons and he hoped this was one of them. nAs luck would have it, it was. Max was walking down the dock, whennhe saw Sharkboy he sprinted towards him. \"Sharkboy what are youndoing here?\" he said out of breath when he reached him. Sharkboy studied thenhorizon, not wanting Max to see the worry in his eyes. He set hisnjaw and then turned back to face Max. \"Something…something'snwrong with Lavagirl.\" He gulped, not expecting it to affect himnthat much. Max shook his head in disbelief, \"She's…she'sndead?\" he asked in a croaky voice. Sharkboy looked at him like henwas the dumbest thing he'd ever saw. \"No stupid! If she wasndead I would have taken her to the volcano!\" he growled innexasperation and faced the ocean with his back to Max. \" How darenhe! Thinking I would let her die! I would never let that happen!nNever!\" Max took a tentativenstep towards Sharkboy. \"Then…what's wrong?\" Sharkboyncouldn't take it anymore. He spun around and collapsed on thenpier, gripping his hair and gushed out everything. \"About a month agonLavagirl taught herself to cool and then I taught her how to swim!nShe was great for about a week, always happy and smiling. Now shenalways looks so sad and… wilting ! Like she's sick, onlynshe doesn't say anything about it to me! She'll just plaster anfake smile on her face and pretend like she's fine! Then, todaynwhen we went swimming, it was worse than usual. She made up some liento go back to the cave. I stayed out and swam for a while, thenndecided to make her tell me what was going on. But when I got to thencave she was…crying! Bawling her eyes out! Then I came herenbecause…well…\" He felt his face burn when he realized that Maxnprobably didn't know anymore than he did. Max smiled, relievednthat Lavagirl was all right. He was also kind of amused thatnSharkboy thought that he could solve the labyrinth of a girl'snemotions. He shrugged, \"I don't know, sounds like she's hidingnsomething from you.\" He sat down in front of Sharkboy who sighed.n\"I knew that already. But WHAT is she hiding from me!\" He saidnas he jumped up. He started to pace back and forth. \"I mean, shentold me that she had learned to cool herself for us ! So thatnI wouldn't have to burn every time I wanted to touch her! So Intaught her how to swim and we were having a great time and now…\"nMax cut him off. \"Wait… she said she did for 'us' as in yountwo as a…a…\" He didn't want to say it, afraid that Sharkboynmight be angry if he did. But to his surprise, Sharkboy stoppednpacing and looked at him, something dawning all across his face. \"She wanted us to bentogether…\" Sharkboy said quietly. \"Like…more than friendsntogether!\" Excitement lit up his face. \"She really does lovenme!!!\" He was practically skipping towards his bike when somethingnstopped him. \"Wait! That's why she's crying! She thinks Indon't love her back! He hit himself in thenhead. \"Oh you moron! I'm what is wrong. I'm what's hurtingnher.\" Max watched as hisneyes grew wide, \"I have to get back!\" He hopped on his bike andnturned around. \"Thanks Max!\" With that he rocketed off back home. --------------------------------------------------------------- Lavagirl pushednherself up and stared at her hands. She had learned to cool for him,nso she could touch him and he could touch her. But he still didn'tnwant to after that. So she learned to swim, so she could also be anpart of the ocean. But he still didn't care, he never showed anynsigns of loving her since that first night he'd discovered hernsecret. She sighed andnstumbled to the front of the cave and noticed he was gone, but notnthe note that he had gone to Max's. \" He did it. He said henwouldn't…but he left me. \" Fresh tears sizzled off her face.n She'd heated back up. She looked out at the ocean. The one thingnhe seemed to love other than his father. The ocean, that was hisnanswer for everything. Where he went forncomfort, where he went to think. She hated it and loved it. Loved itnfor accepting her when she wanted it to. Hated it when it took thenone she loved away from her. If the ocean was thenanswer for Sharkie, maybe it could be the answer for her too. She walked out ontonthe beach and stared at its crashing waves and couldn't help butnsmile. \" Always moving, like Sharkie .\" She thought of itsndeep depths, of it's cold waters washing over her and acceptingnher. \" That's it! \" she thought. \" That's how I cannbe with Sharkie! I just have to become part of the thing he loves thenmost! Then he'll love me. \" Lavagirl took a deepnbreath and closed her eyes. She knew dying didn't hurt; afternall…she'd done it before. She took her first step into the darknwater as her normal scorching self. --------------------------------------------------------------------- Sharkboy was pushingnhis bike to its limit. He was happy that he finally knew hownLavagirl felt about him, but something kept nagging at him. Hencouldn't help feeling like something was terribly wrong. Sooooo, what do you think? Will Sharkboy makenit in time? (dun-dun-dun) You'll just have to wait til' Mondaynbecause I have weekends off! (Grin) But please REVIEW!!!!![Chapter 5] Okay, this is my only update for a while, so enjoy!!! Sharkboy was racing atnbreak neck speed back to the beach. He couldn't shake the feelingnthat something was wrong…something to do with Lavagirl. When henthought of something happening to her he felt an emptiness open innthe pit of his stomach. It acted like a black hole, draining allnfeeling and warmth from him. He shivered and smiled. Everything wasnjust fine! He probably just felt worried because of his nerves thatncame every time he thought of telling Lavagirl the truth. He was just about tonslow down for the last stretch of beach when he saw her. Walkingninto the ocean as steam rose all around her. His heart stopped,nseemingly turning ice cold. \"NOOOOOOO!!!!!!!\" he screamed at thentop of his lungs, flooring the gas petal. He slammed the breaks whennhe reached her and sprinted towards the ocean. She was already up tonher chest. \" No! Don't do this to me! Please no!!!! \" hisnmind screamed as he dove in. -------------------------------------------------- Lavagirl was already upnto her waist when she heard him, a scream she had never used him use.n She glanced his way but found that her heart was in too much pain tontake his into account. \" No! \" she thought. \" He won'tnunderstand! This is the only way we can be together! The only waynhe'll love me! \" She began to plunge herself deeper as shenbegan loosing consciousness. The last thing she heard before shenblacked out was the screech of his breaks. \" I love you Sharkie! \"nWas her last desperate thought as she let the waves consume her. ---------------------------------------------------- Sharkboy ignored the heat of the water as he grabbed Lavagirl undernthe arms and hoisted her up onto the beach. She lay there, no breathnescaping her lips, no heat to her skin. Still her beauty remained, ancold reminder of how happy she had been. He stroked her cheek as henrealized something hotter than the ocean was rolling down his cheeks.n He made no effort to brush them away as he leaned over her face…. What will happennnext!? Hmmm…short I know, but still catchy review!!!![Chapter 6] Hello my faithful reviewers!!! I am so happy your enjoying the story!nStarting Monday I will try to update more. Possibly 2-3 times a day,nso keep an eye out! Sorry I haven't updated for a while, I'venbeen sick. Anyway, here's the next chapter! ENJOY!!!!! Sharkboy brushed hisnhand over Lavagirl's cheek and leaned down next to her ear, hisntears splashing onto her face. He gulped and whispered, \"Pleasendon't die! I can't…you can't…\" He took a big breath andnleaned in closer, taking her hands in his. \"I…I love you!\" hencried out hoping she would wake up. But she didn't stir. She justnlay there looking like the perfect beautiful angel she was. He couldn't controlnhis anger and sadness; he threw himself onto her stomach and sobbed.n\"It's all my fault, I should have known! You loved me! Howncould I not…not…\" he looked at her face, the picture of peacenand grace. Lavagirl was the only one for him and would always be thenonly one. He gently lifted her up to him and held her against hisnchest, breathing in her scent. \"Please…I can't loose you too!nI need you! I LOVE YOU!!!!\" he screamed as he lifted her up andndashed for the volcano that was her life source. ------------------------------- Lavagirl was in a fog,nat least that was what it looked and felt like to her. \" Is thisnthe ocean? Is this what it feels like to be part of it? Part of him? \"nShe looked around and shivered, she felt so cold, so lifeless! Isnthis how Sharkie felt? She didn't like it but knew that now atnleast she could be with him. She craned her neckntrying to see if Sharkie was there. With his boyish grin andnmuscular arms, that's all she wanted to see but no matter how hardnshe looked all she could see was fog, emptiness. Then she heard anvoice. Her ears pricked as she searched around, but she fond thatnthe voice came from within her. It was Sharkie! Shenstrained her ears to listen, \"I can't loose you too! I need you InLOVE YOU!\" She heard it loud and clear as her heart skipped, butnfound she could not believe it. She felt the rush of cool air on hernface as if she were running. She turned to face the wind just as thenfog all vanished and extreme heat flooded her body. -------------------------------- Sharkboy threw herninto the volcano and ran the opposite direction as fast as he could.n\" Please don't let it be too late! \" So what do you think? Will she make it?nREVIEW!!!!!![Chapter 7] To bad that the site was being repaired. Ah well, now you have two new chapters to read! As always, REVIEW!!!! Lavagirl smiled slightly as she curled up in what she knew was lava. Hot and inviting like a warm bed to the rest of us. She felt herself melt in with the molten mixture. She let herself relax and was about to fall asleep when she remembered. \" Sharkboy !\" she thought desperately. She kicked upwards towards the surface and her hand found the edge of the volcano. She pulled herself up and out of the red-hot pool that she had longed for. Looking around, straining her eyes for the only one she wanted…needed to see. It didn't take long for her eyes to rest on the grinning figure speeding towards her. Grinning back she forced herself to cool and run down to meet him. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ Sharkboy threw himself to the ground and covered his head in his arms. A few seconds later he heard the volcano explode behind him. He flipped onto is back and jumped up looking for Lavagirl to emerge. His breathing grew more ragged as the seconds turned into minutes. Fresh tears started to brim inn his eyes as he fell to his knees. \"WHY!!!\" he screamed. His head dropped to his hands as his eyes overflowed and he felt his heart shatter. Then he heard something from the volcano. His breathing sped up as he raised his eyes to look. Standing there in all her radiant glory was Lavagirl. She was squinting around trying to find him. He grinned and raced up towards her. Once she saw him she ran down to meet him halfway on the volcano. When she reached him she jumped into his arms, he clung to her and pulled her tear-streaked face to his chest. \"It's alright now…its' alright.\" He soothed her. Then pulled her back, concern filling his eyes. \"Why did you do it? Why did you kill yourself?\" She evaded his eyes in shame. \"You couldn't love me the way I was! So I thought if I became one with the ocean then…\" she faltered then looked up into his face, wearing a look of betrayal. \"You left me…\" Sharkboy shook his head, \"No, I went to see Max, didn't you see my note?\" She shook her head, \"I'm so sorry. I hurt you even more.\" She tried to pull away but Sharkboy just held her tighter. \"No, I should have realized…I…\" he took her chin in his hand and tilted her face up to look her in the eyes. \"I love you Lavagirl.\" She stood there with a mix of shock and love in her eyes, her mind blank on what to say. So, what will happen next? Find out next chapter, tomorrow![Chapter 8] Ok, continuing…. Sharkboy searched herneyes desperately for some kind of answer. His heart was hammering innhis chest as regret hot threw his mind. He was just about to backndown when Lavagirl captured him in a kiss. At first she caught himnoff guard and he almost fell backwards. But he quickly recovered andnwrapped his arms around her to pull her closer. Lavagirl could feel anfireworks display going ff in her head. Sharkboy's kiss was betternthan she had ever imagined it to be. He was gentle, but the emotionsnhe sent through her were fierce. Finally she broke away and openednher eyes to gaze into his. \"I love you too.\"nShe said smiling. Sharkboy grinned out right and carried her down tonhis bike. He set her in front of him and reached around her to thencontrols. They set off for home just as the sun began to rise. Sharkboy nuzzlednLavagirl's neck and whispered in her ear. \"You look so beautifulnin the dawn light.\" Lavagirl leaned back into him and giggled. \"Youndon't look so bad yourself!\" she stated. He breathed in her sweetnsent, so beautiful. To him the ride back tonthe cave was too short. When he parked out front of the cave henreluctantly got off and then helped her step down. Lavagirl's bootngot caught on the step and she slipped and fell into his arms. Shenblushed as he grinned down at her. \"All you had to do was ask!\"nhe said mockingly. She playfully punchednhim in the shoulder. \"Well aren't we cocky!\" he grinned evennwider and silenced her smirk with his kiss. Lavagirl subconsciouslynlaced her arms around his neck and pulled herself further into thenkiss. Sharkboy tangled his hands into her hair. It was then that hisncell phone rang. Lavagirl gently brokenaway, a look of disappointment on her face. Sharkboy growled angrily,n\"Max had better be dying or I am gonna kill him!\" Lavagirlngrinned in spite of herself. Sharkboy flipped open his phone, \"Whatnis it Max!\" he said harshly. Max's indignant voice was heard onnthe other end. \" Well hello to you to! Is Lavagirl okay? \" henasked worried. \"Better than fine!\" called Lavagirl from behindnSharkboy. Sharkboy blushed and motioned for her to be quiet. But Maxnhad already taken her hint. \" Oh, I see. \" He said knowingly. Sharkboy rolled his eyes.n\"Is that all you were calling about or is there more?\" he askednimpatiently. He heard Max clear his throat on the other end. \"I hadna dream last night…\" he stated warily. Sharkboy didn't try tonhide his frustration. \"So! You always have dreams Max!\"nThere was a pause on the other end. \" This one was about yournfather…I know where he is. \" I haven't hadnalmost any reviews lately! (pout) Please review this chapter!!!!! Sorry I haven'tnbeen able to update as much as I said. It's been too hectic.[Chapter 9] Okay…moving on to the next chapter!!! Thanks for the reviews! ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Sharkboy gulped as he heard Lavagirl gasp behind him. She had obviously had been listening over his shoulder, which she was now giving a tight squeeze. Sharkboy cleared his throat but found his voice still cracked when he spoke. \"Wh-where?\" he was afraid that Max might have seen his father's ship broken down somewhere with him dead inside. \" Somewhere along the tip of Africa. You know, the Cape of Good Hope ?\" Max replied on the other end. Sharkboy wanted to kick himself a thousand times. \"Of course, he's searching around heavy populations of sharks! I am such an idiot!\" He stomped a foot into the sand. Lavagirl walked around to face him and put both hands on his shoulders. Sharkboy nearly dropped the phone as he gazed into her eyes. She pulled him into a hug. \"You're not an idiot Sharkie.\" She whispered quietly. He could feel the hot tears roll down his face as he thought about how much she really cared about him. \"Yes I am!\" he said as he buried his face in her hair; comfort spreading through him at her scent. She pushed him back and grinned at him. \"Well, sometimes yes…but you're my idiot!\" He grinned right back at her. They starred at each other lovingly until Max interrupted by clearing his throat. Sharkboy picked back up the pone. \"Sorry Max. Is he alright!\" Max sighed. \" I don't know! I just saw his ship and the location. I have no clue about him. \" Sharkboy glanced at Lavagirl who was biting her lip but she nodded in understanding. Sharkboy nodded back. \"Right, Lava and I are going after him.\" After saying goodbye and hanging up he turned to Lavagirl. \"Ready?\" he asked. She walked over and softly kissed him on the lips. \"I'd follow you anywhere!\" she assured him after they broke apart. He smiled as he took her hand and led her to the submarine. --------------------------------------------- As they approached the Cape of Good Hope Sharkboy's radar picked up on a signal from about three miles off the shore. \"This is it.\" He said as he steered towards it. Lavagirl put her hand on his shoulder and rested her head against it, praying he was right. ----------------------------------------------- Sharkboy's heart skipped a beat as he set the sub to hover over the wrecked sub bellow. He could still see that it was working for the lights in front were still running as was the signal. He turned to Lavagirl, \"I have to swim down from here.\" He told her. She wanted to join him but knew the risk was too great. She just nodded and let her head drop as the tears began to fall. Sharkboy stepped forward and kissed her passionately, she held on for dear life. Once they broke away she took his hands in hers and brushed her lips over them. \"Please be careful! I can't lose you!\" He lifted her chin up with his hand and starred earnestly into her watery eyes. \"You won't.\" he assured her. He gave her one more, quick kiss and then went to the diving room. He closed the doors to seal off the rest of the ship and opened the hatch to the outside. Lavagirl prayed as she watched him through the small window in the sealed off door. Sharkboy turned to her one last time before diving into the dark depths. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- So, what do you think? Aren't they adorable! REVIEW!!!!!![Chapter 10] This is the FINAL CHAPTER!!!!!!!! Enjoy!!!! --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Sharkboy dove deeper and deeper into the water until he came up in front of the wrecked sub. He peered in through the glass, squinting through the dim light. He could barely make out the form of a very gray, very worn down looking man sleeping in one of the seats of the sub. Sharkboy's heart skipped as he recognized an aged version of the man that had drifted away from the destruction of his marine biology lab, and his son so long ago. Sharkboy shook his head to clear it of the painful past memories. He tapped lightly on the glass to get his father's attention. His dad woke with a start and stared in horror at the thing outside his sub. Sharkboy shook his head desperately to show him he was not going to hurt him. His dad seemed to understand and mouthed the words 'HELP'. Sharkboy nodded and pointed to the escape hatch at the top of the sub. Sharkboy's dad nodded and he grabbed a few things and headed out of site to the back of the sub. Sharkboy turned around and held thumbs up to Lavagirl who he knew was watching from their own sub. He then swam to the escape hatch and waited until it was opened and out came his father carrying a waterproof sack and an oxygen tank attached to his back. Sharkboy led his father up to their sub and once he reached the hatch, opened it. They climbed into the sealed off room and waited for the water to drain. Once it did the door to the rest of the sub was flung open and Sharkboy got a face full of hot pink hair. \"You did it!\" Lavagirl shrieked into his neck. \"No we did it!\" he said regaining his balance since she had nearly knocked him over leaping into his arms. She planted a kiss on his lips and then turned to a very dumbfounded Sharkboy's dad. \"What's going on? Who are you? What are you?\" he stepped back a little in fear. Sharkboy stepped cautiously towards him. \"Dad…it's me…Sharkboy! I'm your son; after the lab sank the sharks took me in and raised me. Dad I've waited so long to find you!\" With that Sharkboy flung himself into his dad's arms. \"Ter-Terrance? My Sharkboy!?\" he returned his son's embrace as tears ran down both their cheeks. Lavagirl felt her eyes grow hot as well. Sharkboy pulled away from his father and walked over to Lavagirl. \"Dad, this is Lavagirl. She's my best friend, as well as the girl that has my heart.\" Lavagirl smiled lovingly at him. \"And you have mine Sharkie! She exclaimed as he kissed her and took her hand in his. Lavagirl gasped as he got down on one knee and starred into her eyes. (Just so you know, in my story they are like 17 or 18 at his point.) \"Lavagirl…will you marry me?\" Lavagirl's jaw dropped in shock. But her surprise soon turned to a grin. \"Oh…YES!!!\" she cried as she flung herself into his arms. They looked up from the floor to the grinning face of Sharkboy's father. \"That's exactly how your mother reacted when I proposed!\" They all laughed and then Sharkboy helped Lavagirl and himself up. Sharkboy's father walked over to Lavagirl and kissed her hand. \"I'm so pleased to have you as my future daughter-in-law!\" he said happily. Sharkboy beamed as he starred at the happy scene. His father and Lavagirl, his only love…his family! --------------------------------------------------- (A few years later) Sharkboy stood over Lavagirl and smiled down at the little boy and girl she held in her arms. \"Twins!\" Ice exclaimed from the other side of the table. \"I know! I can't believe I'm a grandfather!\" exclaimed Sharkboy's dad who was sitting next to Ice. \"You know, Sharkboy…I mean Terrance has a name. Now Lavagirl we need one for you!\" 'Ice had a point.' Lavagirl silently agreed. \"Well…how about…\" Sharkboy thought. \"Victoria?\" he suggested. Lavagirl ran it over in her head, then said it out loud. \"Victoria….hmmm…I like it! Victoria it is!\" she then turned down to her little ones and whispered, \"Did you hear that Amelia, Danny? I'm Victoria, your momma! And this is your daddy Terrance!\" the two little babies squirmed and giggled. \"Perfect.\" Said Sharkboy as he leaned down and kissed her softly. They all sat there watching the sunset, knowing that many happy years were to come. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- I think this was a cute ending!

It was only when it came to Holden that it got complicated. It got complicated because Holden was a guy and Sean wasn't supposed to want to be with him. It got complicated because of the fear and the secrets and the hiding so Holden had simplified things; he had left. Except apparently it hadn't simplified things because here he was standing outside the door to the place he had considered home for the last two years. Inside Sean was no doubt asleep, maybe even dreaming of him and the moment to come. Holden took a deep breath as he thought about what he was about to do. Only a couple hours ago he was resigned to the fact that it was over but that was before he had caught Kelvin Moore's news report and had seen the press conference from earlier in the day. \"I'm gay.\" Sean had said it so easily, so simply. And just like that everything had changed. Quietly he let himself into the beachside condo - he still had a key - and shut the door behind him. The lights were off and he made his way through the house easily. Finally he saw the footballer lounging in a chair his eyes closed and tilted to the side. A soft smile ghosted across Holden's face as he made his way over, his steps practically silent in the night air. Lifting the flower he grazed it along Sean's turned face, watching as the petals caught lightly of the stubble covering his cheek. Sean's mouth twitched and he clumsily lifted a large hand to bat away the offensive flower. Holden continued to move the flower against the tanned skin and slowly Sean opened his eyes. He blinked slowly as Holden came into focus and all Holden could do was smile and run his fingers through sleep tousled hair. A shadow of a smile flitted to the surface. \"You saw.\" Sean said, simple as always. \"Yeah.\" Holden replied. With a smile he closed the distance between them because maybe things were simple after all.[Chapter 2] Dreaming Light streamed through the partially closed curtains in Sean's room and he grumbled wordlessly and squeezed his eyes shut against the intrusion. He had been having good dreams and he wanted to go back to them. He had dreamed that Holden had come back, had come home. Sean wanted to stay in the dream world where Holden was in his arms instead of emerging into reality where he had possibly destroyed his career and was still left alone. With a sigh he went to flip onto his stomach with the intent of burying his face in the pillows and fighting off reality a bit longer. However when he went to move he realized his left side was pinned to the bed, pinned by another body. Sean's eyes flew open and his senses kicked back in as he took in the sight before him. He saw golden, perfectly smooth skin stretched over sinuous muscle. He could feel the soft chest hairs pressed into his own chest and the steady thump of someone else's heartbeat against his side. His eyes travelled down the body up till the soft curve of his backside where golden skin met crisp white sheets. Travelling upwards again he took in the mess of slightly shaggy hair buried into his shoulder. Maybe it hadn't been a dream after all. \"Ngh, tired go back to sleep.\" The body mumbled into his skin. It was muffled and clogged with sleep but there was no doubt that the voice belonged to Holden. A grin spread across Sean's face and he let out a chuckle as he leaned down to kiss the deceptively soft hair. \"It wasn't a dream. You really came back.\" He murmured amazed. \"I'll leave if you don't let me sleep\" Holden grumbled. Sean laughed heartily because Holden's morning grumpiness was just so familiar to him. He never thought he'd miss the other man's complaints and half-awake grumbles but after a week of waking up alone to the silence of his too big condo Holden's threat was like music. Pulling him closer he closed his eyes and focusing on the even rhythm of Holden's breathing he let himself be lulled back to sleep.[Chapter 3] Apologies It was nearly noon by the time Sean and Holden fully woke but both men had needed the sleep. Sleep had been illusive and restless for the past week. Holden stretched languidly before leaning in closer and pressing a kiss to the skin that covered Sean's heart. He smiled at the action and threaded his fingers into the back of the dark blonde hair and tilted his head back. Holden moved his head easily allowing Sean to dip his own head down and capture Holden's lips. Sean groaned as they pressed together and Holden's tongue, and with it his taste, slipped into his mouth. Sean ran his free hand down the expanse of Holden's back slipping under the cover to palm his ass. Holden moaned in response and pushed his hips down in a manner that had Sean's cock coming to life. They broke the kiss to breathe and Sean took the opportunity to get some oxygen and blood to his head. He wanted Holden, he always wanted Holden, but he also didn't want to rush right back into the physical with him. \"Holden, wait.\" Sean said, softly pushing Holden back. Sean almost regretted it when sadness and hesitation filled his clear blue eyes. Rejection was written on his stubbly face making him look young and vulnerable and Sean was hit with the damage he had caused. Quickly he reached out and caressed Holden's cheek leaning down to place a quick kiss against his lips in a manner that he hoped reassured the other man. \"I just wanted to say how sorry I am for putting you through all this. If I had just came out like you'd asked we wouldn't have had to go through all this. I'm sorry, Holden.\" Holden pushed himself up so that he was in a sitting position and ran a hand through his hair in a manner that Sean knew meant he was trying to figure out how to do something. Slowly he lifted himself up and turned to face Holden straight on. He truly was sorry and he just hoped that Holden believed him. \"I'll accept your apology, Sean Jackson, on two conditions.\" Holden said seriously. \"Anything, Holden.\" He replied honestly. \"First condition is if you accept my apology for trying to push you into doing this.\" \"You don't need to apologize; you had the right to demand it.\" \"This is my condition, Sean.\" Holden interrupted him with a small chuckle. \"Fine, apology accepted. Now what's this second condition?\" \"You need to make love to me now because I've missed you so much.\" Holden's words were barely a whisper but his eyes sparked with an intensity that Sean had missed. Without thinking about it he leaned forward and captured Holden's lips in a passionate kiss filled with pent-up desire and frustration that their time apart had fostered. As he pushed Holden back onto the bed Sean knew that this time things were going to be different. AN: Thank you for reading. I would truly appreciate any comments or feedback you have. I'm not going to withhold updates if I don't get any but just know that they mean a lot to writers. Thanks.[Chapter 4] The (Second) First Date It had been two days since The Announcement (in Holden's mind it was always capitalized) and the two men had spent the majority of those two days in the condo. Sean had gone out for another lunch with Kara and Paula so Holden had taken the opportunity to check in at the office. Armed with a briefcase full of papers to look over Holden took a cab back to Sean's condo. His boyfriend's SUV was still missing and he hoped the lunch meeting was going well because Holden knew how much the game meant to him – after all it had almost destroyed their future together. Holden let himself into the condo and tried to push thoughts of that final fight out of his head. He was just getting inside when his phone rang in the pocket of his charcoal slacks, pulling it out he smiled as Sean's name flashed across the screen. \"Hey, everything ok with lunch?\" Holden answered with a smile. \"Yeah, I'll tell you about it later. I was just wondering... I mean if you'd like to that is... go out tonight?\" Sean stammered uncharacteristically. \"Sean Jackson, are you asking me out on a date?\" Holden replied with a chuckle. \"Yeah, I guess I am.\" \"I'd love to.\" \"Great, I'll be home in about half an hour.\" \"See you soon.\" \"Bye.\" Holden was grinning as he slipped the phone back into his pocket. The conversation reminded him of another similar conversation he had with Sean almost three years ago. Holden flipped through his phone trying to find the e-mail Kara Monoghan had sent him the week before. He was currently waiting outside the young publicist's office waiting to talk to her about a property she was looking into. Finding the e-mail he scanned it and mentally went over his presentation, he was pretty confident in Kara's interest and today's meeting was about the details of the deal. Holden looked up when he heard Kara's voice and saw her escorting a tall, broad-shouldered man out of her office. Holden's first thought was 'fuck me' because the male was breathtaking. He was ruggedly handsome with a five o'clock shadow dusting his strong jaw. His eyes were sparkling with mischief and Holden couldn't help but picture being pushed against a wall, that hard, strong body the only thing keeping him from sliding to the floor. \" Mr Wilson?\" The slight concern in Kara's voice made him realize that he had zoned out and now both Hot Stranger and Kara were staring at him. \" Sorry, I'm a little tired today.\" He explained feeling his ears warm up. \" Sorry to have kept you waiting.\" The stranger spoke with a deep, rumbling voice that encompassed Holden and made his blood hum. The corner of his mouth pulled up in a lazy smile and Holden had to shove his hands into his pockets to keep from reaching out. \" Not a problem\" he managed to get out. \" See ya, Kara. I'll tell Paula I've agreed to this.\" \" This is a good idea, Sean.\" Kara replied shaking his hand. Sean nodded to Holden and then he was gone. The meeting was short and less than twenty minutes later Holden was waiting for the elevator to head down to the parking garage. A soft ding announced its arrival and stepping in he hit the P button indicating the garage level. The doors were about to slide shut when a gravelly voice asked to hold it, automatically his arm went out to keep the doors from shutting. Looking up he saw the man – Sean – from Kara's office. \" Thanks, Mr Wilson right?\" Sean said as he slipped in and the door whisked close. \" You can just call me Holden though.\" Holden answered with a nod. He couldn't help but be impressed that Sean had remembered his name, sure he remembered Sean's but then again Sean was drop dead gorgeous. \" Sean Jackson.\" He said holding out his hand. \" Nice to meet you, Sean.\" Sean's grip was firm, his calloused hands pleasantly rough against Holden's softer ones. Sean held on a bit longer than necessary but instead of pulling away Holden just smiled letting his eyes do a quick once over. \" Are you a client of Kara's?\" Sean asked, eventually letting Holden's hand drop. \" More like the other way around. I'm a property consultant.\" Holden explained. Sean nodded but Holden could tell he wasn't really sure what that meant. He was used to that and just shrugged it off, no need to get into details with someone he had never seen before and probably never would again. Eventually they reached the underground garage and Holden almost reluctantly left the elevator. \" Well, it was nice meeting you Sean. See ya.\" Holden said and the other man nodded in agreement. He turned to walk away to where he was parked feeling Sean's eyes on his retreating back. \" Holden, wait!\" Sean called out. Holden was startled but turned around easily and lifted an eyebrow in question. \" I was wondering, that is I don't know if you're even... I mean, we just met but if you wouldn't hate it...\" Sean stammered. \" Are you trying to ask me out on a date, Sean Jackson?\" Holden asked with a grin. The other man's face flushed pink and he nodded sheepishly. Holden couldn't help but find the slight blush incredibly arousing and he heard himself agreeing. Sean looked extremely relieved and they exchanged numbers with Sean promising to call that night to make plans. Holden found himself waiting eagerly for the call to come. Holden hadn't realized just who Sean was until he had got home and googled it knowing that is name was familiar. The thought that a professional footballer had asked him out on a date made his knees weak and he had only hoped that Sean wouldn't mind that he knew almost nothing about the sport. \"Holden, you home babe?\" \"Back here\" Holden replied. When Sean walked into the room Holden was applying a bit of gel to his slightly damp hair. He smiled at him through the mirror and watched as the footballer walked up behind him and slid strong arms around his waist. Sean nuzzled his neck and placed a wet kiss to his jaw. \"Mmm you smell great.\" Holden hummed contentedly and turned in the embrace so that he could press their lips together in a soft kiss. Sean's hands slipped down to palm his ass through the fresh slacks he had put on after his shower. \"So where are you taking me?\" Holden asked pulling back slightly. \"Bistro Garden.\" Sean replied naming one of Holden's favourite restaurants. It had also been where they had gone for their first date. Though this time instead of a back corner to hide that they were together they sat in the back to have some privacy. As they sat and talked Sean kept Holden's hand in his and while there were a few stares Holden couldn't care less. It was a fresh start for them and Holden couldn't help thinking that the future looked bright.[Chapter 5] You, Me and the In-laws Sean locked the SUV with a beep and walked to his front door. He was glad to have a team to play for again even if they weren't a top team and he couldn't help but smile softly as he dug out his house key. Letting himself in he disabled the alarm noting that Holden was still at work. The weekend before he had moved back in fully; giving up the apartment he had rented when they split. Sean loved having him back in the condo; Holden was what made it a home again. With his sports bag still slung over his shoulder he walked to the laundry room kicked off his shoes and dropped off the bag. He had showered after practice so he headed for the kitchen and a snack, once there he spotted the flashing red light of the answering machine. He hit the play button and waited for the message to be played back for him. The first was some bogus claim that he had won a trip from a contest he definitely hadn't entered. The second was from his father. \"Sean, it's your father. We've given you time but your mother is worried. Please call her.\" Even through the recorded message Sean could hear the soft command in it. This was the third message from his parents since he outed himself on National Television. The day after the press conference there had been a message from his mom – Sean and Holden had been ignoring all calls that day – and she left a short and sweet message. It was still on the machine and he pushed a few buttons until it was playing in the quiet of the room. \"Sean, it's Mom. We saw the conference and just know we love you.\" The message evoked feelings of warmth inside him and he remembered his mom kissing scraped knees and bandaging cut arms. About a week later there had been a second message. \"Sean, I know you're busy and need time but please call us. I love you.\" This message had left Sean feeling guilty. Sure the first few days were busy and he and Holden had a lot of catching up and making up to do but he really should've called his parents. His mom was probably hurt that she had found out her only son was gay along with the rest of the world. He was too scared to think of what his dad was thinking and feeling. However scared or not his mom did deserve to hear from him and he picked up the phone and dialled the familiar number. It rang once, twice before the line was picked up and he heard his mom's voice. \"Hello?\" \"Hey mom\" Sean said with a smile. \"Sean? Sean, honey is that you?\" Sean fought the urge to roll his eyes; he was an only child who else would be calling her mom? \"Yes mom, it's me. Sorry I haven't called.\" \"It's ok, dear. How are you? Are you eating properly? When will you be visiting next? It better be before the summer?\" \"Whoa mom, one thing at a time.\" \"Sorry, I just miss you son.\" \"I know mom, I miss you too. I'm fine, I'm pretty great actually and yes I am eating properly.\" \"Good, you need your fruits and vegetables, not just all that protein and carbs you like.\" \"I'm about to grab an apple right now actually.\" \"That's my boy.\" His mom responded making him feel all of eight again. \"How are you and dad?\" \"We're good. Dad's been fiddling in his workshop a lot.\" \"What's he got planned this time?\" \"Oh Heaven knows. I'm not allowed in.\" \"Sounds like dad.\" His mom continued on about the book club she was a part of and Sean listened like the dutiful son he was. She was talking about what she was going to bake for the next get together when he heard the door open. A few minutes later Holden walked in wearing his suit and tie. Sean smiled at his boyfriend and murmured in agreement to something his mom had said. Holden pressed a kiss to his cheek before moving to rummage in the fridge. \"Sorry mom, I've got to go.\" \"Oh of course, I didn't mean to ramble on.\" \"Don't worry about it. I'm going to check my calendar later and figure out when I can get down, alright?\" \"Really? That would be great. And Sean, bring your young man.\" Sean was speechless, he had never mentioned having a boyfriend and he was pretty sure anything about Holden had miraculously escaped the press so far. \"No need to be so shocked I can tell when my own son is in love. We'll talk to you soon, I love you son.\" \"I love you too mom.\" Sean replied before hanging up the phone. When he turned around Holden tossed him an apple which he caught expertly with one hand. Polishing it lightly on his shirt he took a bite, savouring the juicy sharpness before swallowing. \"How'd you know I wanted an apple?\" he questioned Holden. \"You always have an apple after training.\" He replied simply. Sean smiled; it was nice having someone who knew you that well. And Holden knew the real Sean Jackson. Not the one that was the persona of big football star but who he was beyond that. He crossed the room and wrapped his free arm around Holden's waist his hand resting on the small of his back. \"Have I told you how much I love you?\" Sean said with a grin. \"Yes, but I'll never tire of hearing it.\" \"Well I love you, Holden Wilson. I love y more than anything in this world.\" \"And I love you, Sean Jackson.\" Holden replied. Holden tilted his head up for a kiss and Sean happily obliged letting his tongue slip out to lick across Holden's lips before pulling back. \"So you're taking a trip home?\" \"No, we're taking a trip home.\" Holden's eyes widened and Sean laughed before ducking down to kiss him again.[Chapter 6] Home For A Rest Holden's heart was pounding wildly in his chest and even he could see the blatant fear in his eyes. He blinked and straightened his tie, adjusting his suit for the tenth time in as many minutes. Gripping the edge of the counter he ducked his head and concentrated on breathing. Deep breath in through the nose slowly let it out through the mouth. Keep repeating and he just might not pass out. A soft chuckle alerted him to Sean's presence and he glanced up to see him through the mirror. Sean grinned and put the bag he was holding down before walking into the bathroom. Strong hands turned him around, resting on his shoulders. \"It's going to be ok.\" Sean said calmly. \"What if your mom doesn't think I'm good enough? What if your dad thinks it's my fault you're gay? What if-\" Holden was cut off by Sean's lips on his. Slowly he kissed him back trying to concentrate on his solidness and warmth instead of the thousands of worries floating through his head. \"What if it wasn't enough? What if it was too late? What if you didn't come back? Worrying about it didn't do anything. Please don't worry. My parents will love you if for no other reason than because I love you. And my dad's not stupid he won't blame you.\" Sean's thumb brushed tenderly along his cheekbone and Holden took a deep breath. \"Are you sure?\" \"Positive.\" \"OK. Should I change? Is this too formal?\" \"Relax Holden. You look great and the suit is fine. I might not recognise you in something else.\" Sean replied with a laugh. \"Alright, let's go before we miss our flight.\" \"Good idea, we should leave now or I'll be forced to make us very late.\" Holden laughed as Sean waggled his eyebrows comically. Together they left the house, Holden feeling a bit calmer. A couple of hours later they were on the plane having just taken off. Being on the plane Holden couldn't help but think about his last trip and his seat mate. He had received a card from Kate a few days after the flight thanking him for the use of Redman and the car. She had also hoped that things had looked up for him since the flight. The card still sat on his desk at the office; a reminder of a good flight and new friend. Thinking of Kate and the sacrifices she had made for love made Holden realise that meeting Sean's parents wasn't so bad. The Jackson's lived in Texas and so it was a short flight compared to the previous trip. About halfway through the two and a half hour flight Sean decided they could use a drink. He reached up to press the little red call button before settling back in his seat. When the flight attendant approached Holden nearly choked as he recognised her as the same blonde from his previous flight. She smiled widely and Holden hoped she didn't recognise him. No such luck. \"Good afternoon, sir. It's great to have you flying with us again. Holden smiled tightly and Sean raised an eyebrow but Holden shook his head minutely. \"Could we get two rum and cokes, please?\" \"Of course, sir.\" It wasn't long before they had their drinks in front of them and with another large smile the flight attendant walked away. Holden took a sip of his drink and turned to see Sean watching him. \"What was that about?\" \"Do you remember the flight I was on with Captain Kate Hazeltine?\" \"Yeah, it was on Valentine's Day right?\" \"Yeah, well I don't know if it was just the day but this one flight attendant was... well enamoured with me. According to the captain she looked over something like every five seconds.\" Holden felt kind of his stupid telling Sean this, as if he was trying to prove something. Sure it was something to laugh over with a friend but mentioning it to his boyfriend made him feel like the insecure partner trying to make the other jealous. Sean, however, just smiled as if to say 'and you don't know why she would' and immediately Holden felt less foolish. \"I don't think it was just the day.\" Sean said simply. \"Why, because she smiled?\" Holden asked dubiously. \"No because she's looked over at least three times during this conversation.\" \"No way!\" Holden turned his head just in time to see the blonde look his way and smile widely. Slightly horrified he turned back around to face Sean. \"She can look all she wants, I don't blame her, but you're mine.\" Sean said with a slight growl. The noise shot straight to his groin and Holden let out a silent moan before yanking Sean closer by the shirt and crashing their mouths together. He poured his desire, love and anxiety into the kiss as their teeth clashed and Sean pushed his tongue into his mouth. Holden sucked on it hungrily before pulling back, his hands still holding Sean's shirt. \"God, I love you.\" Holden breathed. Sean looked at him with dilated pupils, no mistaking the hungry look in his eyes and Holden wished they weren't stuck on the plane. \"I love you too. Though I think you might have just broken the flight attendant's heart.\" Holden glanced over to where it looked like the blonde had spilled the drink she was pouring over a disgruntled flyer. Holden turned back to Sean sheepishly and couldn't help but laugh. Holden's nerves were back by the time the plane landed and he fidgeted with his suit jacket and tie. They were standing waiting to get through customs and Sean grabbed his hands stilling them. Then he straightened out Holden's tie and jacket and offered a reassuring smile. \"Relax, Holden or they'll think you're smuggling something.\" Holden forced a light laugh and worked on taking calming breaths. Sean's parents had raised him and Sean was great so they couldn't be horrible. Soon they were walking into the arrivals wing of the Dallas airport and Holden scanned the crowd looking for the couple he had seen in photos at the condo. \"Sean! Sean, honey.\" A feminine voice called out. Holden turned at the sound and saw a short, slightly plump woman with a big smile. A grin broke out on Sean's face and he led them over to where his mom was waiting. Sean loomed over her by a good foot and a half and he immediately enveloped her in a big hug lifting her off the ground. Sean's mom let out an almost girlish giggle. The youthful sound made Holden smile and he knew that he was going to like her. Sean put her down and after pressing a kiss to her cheek stepped back and held his arm out to Holden. \"Mom, this is Holden Wilson. Holden, this is my mom Leigh-Ann.\" \"It's nice to meet you Mrs Jackson.\" Holden said bending to place a light kiss on her cheek. Mrs Jackson pulled her to him in a motherly hug that Holden hadn't experienced in years. He felt his throat tighten with emotion as he hugged her back. \"Now you call me Leigh-Ann or Mom. None of this Mrs Jackson stuff. That's my mother-in-law and the name still gives me shudders.\" \"Mom, Nan is not that bad.\" \"Of course not if you're her handsome grandson but if you're stealing her precious first born...\" \"Hush mom, you're going to scare Holden.\" Holden watched the affectionate exchange between mother and son with a sense of envy. \"Alright boys, let's head back.\" Leigh-Ann said with a warm smile. \"Is dad at the car?\" Sean asked and Holden could hear the slight hope in it. \"Your dad's at home and before you read into this he's starting on the steaks. We figured you'd be hungry.\" \"Starved.\" Sean replied, accepting the explanation. \"Now Holden dear, you're not one of those strange LA folk on one of them special diets or anything, are you?\" \"No Leigh-Ann. Steak sounds great.\" He caught Sean's eye and the footballer rolled his eyes but he was grinning. Holden smiled back Leigh-Ann's easy attitude going a long way to making him feel at ease. Leigh-Ann kept up a steady chatter on the ride to the Jackson house, filling them in on some changes to the house and what their neighbours were up to. For the most part Holden just sat there letting the everyday news and sense of community wash over him. When they pulled into the driveway Holden got out of the car and Leigh-Ann was immediately by his side slipping her hand through his. \"Now Frank's out back at the grill no doubt. How about we go have a tour while Sean catches up with his dad.\" Holden nodded understanding that the Jackson men needed some privacy for their first reunion post-coming out.[Chapter 7] Happy Holidays to everyone. Thanks for all the reviews. No Place Like Home Sean stood at the back door watching his father at the grill. He looked the same as he had every time Sean had seen him in the past few years. Dark brown hair faded and tinged with gray, laugh lines now permanent creases but shoulders still broad and straight. Frank Jackson might be getting older but time couldn't make him any less proud and dignified. Sean had a good relationship with his father; they had gone on camping trips and played ball in the yard. Sure when Sean was a teen he had rebelled but never enough to truly strain they relationship. Now for the first time in his life Sean was truly afraid to see Frank Jackson. Steeling his nerves he opened the door and stepped out on to the back deck. His dad looked over at him and put down the brush he was using to add BBQ sauce to the sizzling steaks. He closed the lid and turned around to face Sean. Sean swallowed thickly. \"Hey dad.\" \"Sean\" his dad said nodding. He took a step closer shutting the door behind him and shoving his hands into his jeans. \"Sean, do you love football?\" Sean was surprised by the question; it hadn't been what he was expecting at all. Slowly he nodded because he really did love the sport. \"Do you love your mom and me?\" Again not the question he was expecting. Was his father going to tell him that if he loves the sport and them he couldn't be gay? Still he nodded, words failing him. \"Then as far as I can see you're the same boy you've always been, Sean.\" \"Dad?\" Sean said softly, not fully understanding. \"We love you, Sean. That doesn't depend on who you love. I'm only sorry that you thought you had to hide it for so long.\" Sean felt a crushing wave of love for his parents and he wrapped his arms around his dad in a fierce hug. Emotion threatened to overwhelm him and he hid his face in his dad's neck for a moment before stepping back. \"Now go grab a plate for these, will you and tell your mom she can stop hiding inside with that man of yours.\" Sean laughed and made his way back inside. He took a moment to breathe and come to terms with the easy acceptance of his parents. He had built up years of worries about this moment and it was cathartic to finally have it over. \"Mom! Dad says to stop hiding Holden.\" He called into the house. From upstairs he heard his mom laugh and he hoped she wasn't overwhelming Holden as only moms could do. He went back outside and handed his dad the plate along with a beer. He took a swig of his own beer as his dad started piling the steaks onto the plate. He was just turning the grill off when Holden appeared with Sean's mom right behind him. Holden was slightly hesitant so Sean smiled warmly and held his arm out for him. Like at the airport Holden moved easily into his embrace. Sean pressed a quick kiss to his cheek before turning to his father. \"Dad this is my boyfriend Holden. Holden, my dad Frank.\" Sean watched as the two most important men in his life shook hands, even if Holden had rolled his eyes at the term boyfriend. \"Well I'm sure we'll have lots to talk about but that can be done over dinner.\" The four of them headed inside where his mom had the table set up. Sean grabbed another beer from the fridge for Holden before sitting down across from him. As soon as everyone's plates were filled the questions started. \"How long have you two been seeing each other?\" Sean's mom asked. This was the question that Sean was dreading the most; the one that would show just how long he'd been lying to her. Keeping something so important from her for so long was bound to hurt. \"About three years now.\" Sean answered quietly. \"Oh\" his mom said eyes sad. Sean reached out and squeezed her hand. \"I'm really sorry that I didn't tell you. That I didn't allow myself to trust you.\" \"It's ok, Sean. I guess that explains why you never would go out with those nice ladies I introduced you to.\" She answered with forced lightness. Sean felt her sadness like a knife in his heart and he squeezed tighter trying to convey just how much he regretted it. \"Alright LeighAnn, the boy's sorry let's not waste more time regretting the past.\" Frank Jackson said firmly. \"Holden, I understand you work in real estate?\" \"Yes, sir. I acquire properties for clients. My company goes out and finds the properties that suit the client and bring the options back. We then aid in finalizing the transaction. We deal with a higher clientele than the average agency and aren't limited to the one area, we work worldwide.\" \"I guess that means a lot of travel.\" LeighAnn commented. \"A fair bit but as I am one of the senior agents I have a bit of freedom in choosing which cases to work on.\" \"Have you ever worked with celebrities?\" she continued her tone taking on the slightly whispered awe of gossip. Sean chewed his steak as he watched Holden laugh before answering. The other man's face lit up when he talked about work, about the different houses and styles and finding the right fir for the client. \"There was this one athlete I had to find a place for a few years ago. Some hotshot who did everything through his manager. This included demands for a beach front condo three of which were turned down because they didn't feel right. Of course I didn't know who this athlete was so finding a match was hard. In fact I only ever discovered this athlete's identity by accident a year later.\" Sean's mom was leaning towards Holden her steak all but forgotten. Even his dad was riveted by the tale only Sean wasn't dying to know who the mysterious athlete was. \"How'd you find out?\" Sean's dad asked. \"Who was it?\" Sean's mom asked at the same time. Sean had the uncomfortable idea that he knew the answer to both questions. \"Well this publicist often used my company and a year later I was at her office and ran into this athlete. He asked me out and we've been dating ever since.\" Holden finished with a flourish turning to smile at Sean. His parents burst into a fit of laughter and Sean just mock scowled at Holden. \"Traitor.\" He grumbled. \"It's not my fault you make for an interesting story.\" Holden answered cheekily. \"Glad to see you've gotten over your nerves at meeting my folks.\" Holden just flashed him a charming smile; the one that had ladies pulling out their cheque books to purchase whatever house Holden was offering. Sean might not be one of those women but he wasn't immune to its charm and he found himself smiling back. After all he'd rather be the butt of a joke or two than have Holden feel uncomfortable and out of place. That evening after saying goodnight to the elder Jacksons Sean and Holden were lying in bed talking softly. \"How was the talk with your dad?\" Holden asked lifting his head off Sean's chest slightly. \"It was terrifying at first but he said I was the same person still and they loved me.\" \"Your parents are amazing, Sean. So open-hearted and accepting. It's a shame more people aren't like them.\" \"By more people do you mean your parents?\" \"No, well... maybe, I mean I've accepted that the Wilsons are not accepting people.\" \"It's their loss, Holden. They are missing out on knowing an incredible, brave and intelligent man.\" \"I guess...\" Holden trailed off and Sean could tell he was thinking of the past, of damages done before they'd even met. Holden barely spoke all dinner, not that Wilson family dinners were usually boisterous affairs. He had gotten home that afternoon; home from college for Thanksgiving weekend. He pushed at the food on his plate as he thought of his self-imposed deadline. \" Holden, are you alright honey?\" his mom asked, fork paused mid-air. Now was his chance, his sister and the other relatives would be arriving tomorrow and he wanted – needed – to do this before then. Taking a deep breath he put his fork down. He had known he was gay since his sophomore year at high school but kept it a secret. It wasn't until he was away at college that he had felt comfortable being who he was. Holden had started seeing someone this year and it was this relationship that had prompted him to set this deadline for telling for telling his parents. When his mom asked if he was seeing anyone he wanted to be able to say yes and tell her all about Nathan instead of lying. \" I'm ok, but there's something I need to tell you and dad.\" \" Have you gotten a girl pregnant, Holden?\" his father asked sternly. \" No, it's got nothing to do with a girl.\" \" What is it Holden? You're making me anxious,\" his mom said reaching for her drink. \" It's something I probably should've told you sooner but I was scared so I didn't. Mom, dad, I'm gay.\" His announcement was met with silence and for a moment Holden thought that they hadn't heard him but then the hysterics began. His mom burst into tears and Holden immediately reached forward to comfort her but she jerked away from his touch and picked up her drink. She drained her martini in one long swallow and threw the empty glass across the room. Holden flinched as it broke against the wall. \" Meredith, calm down.\" Holden's father spoke with disdain but it only increased the hysterics. \"Holden, go to your room.\" Holden nodded meekly and went upstairs closing his door and sitting on his bed. Even with the door closed he could hear the fight that was starting. His mom's hysterical shrieks as she blamed all this on her husband. Holden noticed that she couldn't bring herself to say the word 'gay' and instead kept insisting that he was sick. There was silence and Holden thought that maybe that was worse than the screaming. He was staring at his hands when he heard the footsteps; heavy but sure. His dad was coming up; he stood but stayed by his bed. When the door opened he noticed that his dad was wearing his jacket and for a moment he feared his mom had suffered a heart attack. She hadn't she was at the bottom of the stairs a fresh martini in hand. \" Get your bag.\" Three words spoken in a command and then he was out of the room again. Nothing was quite registering with him and he grabbed his duffel bag in a haze. He hadn't even unpacked yet. His parents were at the bottom of the stairs speaking quietly and he stopped in front of them. \" Go to the car.\" Another order just as cold as the first. Holden turned to his mom trying to find some compassion, some love in her expression but she was blank. \" Mom...\" he please moving closer. The slap came out of nowhere, Holden hadn't even registered that she had moved her hand before it came across his face. He stumbled back raising a hand to his now stinging cheek. \" Get out of my house.\" Her words were icy cold as they washed over him; no trace of love. He turned and headed to the car and it wasn't long before his dad joined him. The ride back to his dorm was silent. No music, no conversation, certainly nothing to be thankful for. His dad didn't even bother to turn the car off just stopped and waited. Holden climbed out of the car and before he could even say goodbye his dad was gone. That was the last he had spoken to either of his parents the only other communication being a note suggesting he stay at school for Christmas. When Holden graduated the following year he convinced himself that he didn't care that his family wasn't there and moved out West. \"Hey, still with me babe?\" Sean said softly. \"Yeah, sorry just memories.\" Holden answered. \"I know it's not the same but you have a family now. You've got yourself a mom whether you want it or not. I think she might even like you more than me.\" Holden smiled before leaning up to kiss Sean softly. Sean was right he did have a family now and tonight it felt like he had finally come home.[Chapter 8] AN: This chapter is dedicated to KellyCRocker59 for always taking the time to review. Sorry for the delay in getting it up Home is Where the Heart is Holden laughed and oohed and ahhed at all the right places as LeighAnn Jackson flipped through page after page of photo albums. He saw before him Sean as a baby and watched as the pages turned and he grew into a boy and finally a young man. Sean was sprawled on a lazy boy chair in the corner of the room bemoaning the whole ordeal and pleading uselessly for his mom to put the albums away. His cheeks were tinged pink with embarrassment and every now and then he would hide his face with a pained groan. Holden looked up as LeighAnn described a particular trip they had gone on the summer before Sean started high school. He caught Sean's eyes and smiled and was relieved to see Sean grin back in return, warmth and love emanating from his eyes reassuring Holden that this was all partly an act and he didn't truly mind Holden seeing the photos. \"Sean slept the whole way out even though we were driving through beautiful scenery. We tried waking him up once and he just growled.\" LeighAnn said with a laugh. \"He's much better in the morning now.\" Holden returned. \"Me? You're the one that's nearly homicidal in the morning.\" Sean inputted with the slightest hint of a whine. \"Don't try to make Holden look bad to me, honey.\" LeighAnn scolded. Holden laughed and when LeighAnn wasn't looking stuck his tongue out in a childish gesture that had Sean's mouth dropping open. He made a gasping protesting noise but LeighAnn just assumed it was in protest to her scolding and shushed him before flipping the album page. \"Here's Sean's graduation. He had a full football scholarship to multiple schools.\" LeighAnn claimed proudly. \"Ma, he knows this. We do talk you know.\" Sean teased with a roll of his eyes. \"What was your graduation like, Holden? I bet a smart boy like you graduated with honours. Your parents must be proud.\" Holden knew she was referring to his high school graduation but an image of himself standing up to collect his college diploma and looking out to the empty seats reserved for his parents crossed his mind. He vaguely registered Sean's deep voice telling him mom it would be ok and to leave it alone. He felt a comforting hand on his leg and fought his way back to the present leaving the betrayal of his parents behind him. He blinked and offered a rueful grin that was meant to be reassuring. \"I'm sorry, love. I didn't mean to bring up painful memories.\" LeighAnn said softly. \"It's alright, you didn't know. My parents were proud I guess, in their own way but they expected me to graduate with honours so it wasn't an achievement in their eyes. When I was in college I came out to them and well that was the last I spoke to them. A gay son did not fit their lifestyle so they decided no son would be better.\" Holden could see the compassion in LeighAnn's eyes and was grateful that it was only compassion and love he saw their and not pity. He didn't want or need pity and he knew that seeing that emotion would hurt him. \"I'm not one to speak ill of people but your so-called parents are complete idiots if they threw away the chance to be in your life over something as trivial as which gender you like. You are an amazing man, Holden Wilson. All the more so for having risen above this and strived on your own. As far as I'm concerned those people were fools and I'd be honoured if you would consider me your surrogate mom.\" \"Thanks, LeighAnn. I'd like that.\" Holden managed to say softly, his throat clogged with emotion. LeighAnn just smiled and wrapped her arms around him in a tight hug that made it slightly difficult for Holden to breathe. He held on tight even as he needed oxygen because he felt safe in her embrace and that safety was worth a bit of discomfort. \"Ease up, ma. You're going to strangle my boyfriend.\" LeighAnn laughed and released Holden, stopping to pet his cheek softly before turning back to the photo album. Holden looked up to see Sean looking at them with a peculiar expression and his insecurities rushed back. He recalled Sean's comment from the night before about LeighAnn perhaps liking Holden more than Sean and he wondered if Sean felt threatened. He didn't want to make Sean upset and he didn't want him thinking he was stealing his mom away. His thoughts were jumbled and angst-ridden as he continued to look at the photos, glancing up at Sean every few minutes. It wasn't until later in the afternoon that the two of them had a chance to be alone and Holden found himself uncharacteristically nervous when Sean settled onto the couch beside him. He fidgeted with his collar since he had left the tie off that morning and wasn't surprised to find Sean's large hands enclose around his own and forcing him to release the shirt. \"You ok, Holden?\" Sean asked, his thumb rubbing circles into Holden's hand. \"Yes, just... Sean? Your mom has been really great but I don't want you to think I'm stealing her.\" \"Holden, relax. I'm secure in my relationship with my mom. I'm just glad that you two have taken so well to each other.\" \"Are you sure? You were looking at me weird before and I thought maybe...\" \"I was just surprised that you opened up to my mom that's all. Like her, I'm proud of you. You're an amazing man, Holden Wilson and I love you.\" Holden let a deep breath out as relief surged through him washing away his insecurities. He wrapped his arms around Holden's neck and pressed their lips together in a long kiss. \"I love you too, Sean Jackson.\"[Chapter 9] The Fight Holden knew he shouldn't have but he was tired and it had been a long day and well he snapped. It wasn't often that he got angry enough to yell in fact the last time he shouted at Sean he had followed it up with stalking out of the house and slamming the door on their relationship. He felt bad about yelling because if it reminded him of that last, all important fight than no doubt Sean was thinking about it too. Holden didn't want Sean to think he had any intention of leaving again but he was still mad. Frustrated really and he wasn't ready to apologize and make up just yet. It had started on the plane back to LA the day before. Sean had been concerned that having talked about his parents Holden might be upset. Holden knew it was only because he cared but all the questions making sure he was ok were a little ingratiating. He spent most of the trip dozing as Sean no doubt kept an eye on him ready to shake him awake from any nightmare he might have. Things had been tense that night but they had both explained it away as exhaustion from the trip to Texas. The following morning had started out fine and they had shared a quick breakfast before Sean drove Holden to work. Having been gone for a few days work had piled up and Holden barely had time to drink the cup of coffee his assistant had brought him. He was still deep in papers when Sean had shown up unexpectedly around noon hoping for a lunch date. Holden had been too busy but when he told Sean that the footballer had looked so upset that Holden had ignored the stack of files on his desk and gone out as long as Sean promised it would be quick. Almost an hour later Holden was back in his office and while he had enjoyed lunch he was now going to have to work late to be ready for his meeting the next morning. One of the company's top clients was looking for a new office space and Holden had a stack of properties to research further before presenting her with a pared down list. He called Sean to let him know that he'd be late and that he'd have Redmond drive him home. The conversation was short since Holden didn't want to ignore his work for much longer or he wouldn't be making it back at all that night. So when Redmond dropped him off at the condo he was tired and wanted nothing more than to relax with a glass of wine before going to bed so he'd be refreshed for the morning meeting. He wasn't expecting the young girl standing just outside the gates, her gaze fixed on the condo up the drive. Waving goodbye to his driver he slung his jacket over his arm and adjusted the grip on his briefcase. The girl turned around expectantly and Holden saw that she was gripping a jersey in her hand. Looking closer he saw it was one of Sean's old ones from a few years back. Her grin faltered when she saw that it was only Holden and not Sean. Then the grin was back and she took a step closer to Holden before speaking. \"OMG! You're the reason he did it, aren't you? You're Sean Jackson's boyfriend.\" The girl was smiling widely and her comment took Holden off guard. \"I'm sorry I don't mean to be stalkerish it's just well when Sean Jackson came out like that – to the whole world – well he gave me the courage to tell my parents.\" The girl's grin turned almost shy and Holden found himself smiling at her. \"I'm glad you were able to do that, it takes courage to come out.\" Holden told the girl. He was distracted by the sound of the gate opening and Sean coming out in sweats and a threadbare t-shirt. He wore a scowl and Holden knew this was not going to end well. He watched in horror as Sean practically ripped the jersey out of the awed girl's hands. He scrawled his name over the silk of the jersey before tossing it back to her. \"There's your autograph now kindly remove yourself from my property.\" Sean said tightly. The girl's eyes widened in shock and Holden felt both bad for her and embarrassed for Sean. \"Sean!\" he reprimanded. Holden turned to apologise to the girl only to find that she was already taking off down the darkened driveway. When he turned back around Sean looked apologetic as he well should. \"I'm sorry, Holden. I don't want you to have to deal with these things. The crazy fans...\" \"What?\" Holden asked shocked. \"The girl. I'm sorry she bothered you.\" Sean explained. \"You think that's what is bothering me? She was polite and kind. All she wanted was to thank you for giving her courage and you acted like a complete asshole. She wasn't bothering anybody and then you stomp out here like Mr Big Shot too good for the likes of us.\" Holden snapped. Anger buzzing through his veins thoughts of a glass of wine turned to a desire for something stronger and he stalked up to the condo leaving Sean at the gate. By the time Sean made it back to the house Holden had drunk down a finger of scotch neat and stepped into the shower. He let the hot water pound into him as his anger and frustration calmed. He knew Sean was only trying to be protective but Holden was a grown man and didn't need a protector. Climbing out of the shower he towelled off and wrapping it around his waist walked into the bedroom. Sean was sitting on the chair in the corner of the room with a haunted look on his face. With a sigh Holden crossed to sit on the bed facing Sean. \"Sean, I'm sorry for yelling but you were incredibly rude out there.\" \"I know, I just...\" \"I'm not finished. I know you just want to protect me but I need you to treat me like an equal. I knew from day one that I was going to need to deal with fans and press and I've accepted that.\" \"I'm sorry, Holden. I guess I just wanted to make sure that it wasn't too much. I don't want to lose you again.\" Sean said quietly. Holden nodded his head in understanding and crossed over to where he sat in the chair. He leaned down and pressed a quick kiss to his lips before pulling back. \"I love you, Sean, but I'm going to bed now. I have an important meeting in the morning and I don't want to stress over this anymore.\" Sean nodded and Holden felt his eyes on him as he moved around the room getting ready for bed. Sean stayed in the chair even as Holden climbed into bed. Feeling bad Holden shoved all lingering frustrations aside and smiled over at Sean. \"Are you coming to bed? I'm lonely in here all by myself.\" Sean smiled gratefully and lifted himself out of the chair. \"I guess I could help with that.\" The footballer slid under the sheets and immediately collected Holden in his arms. Holden sighed and leaned into his touch. \"I'm sorry, Holden.\" Sean whispered against his hair. \"I know.\"[Chapter 10] Title: Simple Determination Pairing: Sean Jackson and Holden Wilson Rating: PG13 Words: Disclaimer: Fiction as in made up. AN: Final chapter. Thank you for sticking with it. I thought this was an ideal day to post the final chapter. Sean Jackson was a man with determination. When he knew what he wanted he almost always got it simply because he was determined to do everything in his power to get it. As his calved burned from pounding along the sand at a punishing pace Sean was determined to make it up to Holden. He knew the first thing he had to do was put the fear aside. If he kept thinking that Holden was going to get overwhelmed or change his mind it was going to become a self-fulfilling prophecy. Sean did not want that so as he slowed to a jog when condo came in to sight he let go. He loved Holden and Holden loved him. He had to trust that it would be enough. Of course there was still last night's fiasco with the girl to deal with but Sean had an idea of how to make amends with Holden on that front. In hindsight he could see that the girl had been harmless and Sean wasn't exactly proud of his behaviour. Some days the stress of being pro made him act like he was indeed above it all which why he was so happy with Holden. Holden kept his feet on the ground and even when he was at the top of the game Holden hadn't let it go to his head. Usually he was better at controlling it and he could avoid outbursts like the night before. He had been lucky it was only the girl there and not some paparazzi or reporter. He could just imagine the tabloid headlines. Gay Footballer Verbally Abuses Young Girl Yes, Sean had definitely been lucky. Holden let his head drop back against the headrest with a tired sigh his eyes falling closed in an attempt to stifle an oncoming headache. On the front seat Redmond, attuned as ever to his needs, turned the music down to a soft hum. \"To the condo, sir?\" he asked and Holden nodded agreeing with a soft yes. Redmond often drove him home especially on days Sean had training. The elder gentleman was a god-send with a sympathetic ear and discreet mouth. Holden and Sean had trusted the man with their secret and he had never once regretted that. It had been another long day with the meeting taking up all of his morning. He had worked through lunch so that he'd make it home for dinner. Sean had called in the afternoon to see how his meeting had gone and tell him to try and make it home for dinner because he had a surprise for him. The phone call had left him surprised and intrigued. He had almost expected Sean to be pouting from their fight instead of so accepting. He felt bad about underestimating the man and pushed those though aside. Once he arrived at the condo he thanked Redmond and opened the gate. Holden noticed that Sean's SUV was out front and wondered if it the surprise involved going out. Sean usually parked the vehicle around the side only leaving it out front when it was going to used again soon. He didn't want to spoil Sean's plans but Holden wasn't really up to going out that night and he hoped that wasn't the case. \"Sean? I'm home.\" He called out as he entered the house. He heard Sean speaking to someone before he appeared in the hallway in jeans and a t-shirt with a smile on his face. Sean greeted him with a kiss and took his briefcase away putting it on the side table in the foyer. \"Come, there's someone I want you to meet.\" Sean grinned like a little boy as he tugged on his arm making Holden laugh. In the living room seated on the large leather couch with a can of Sprite was a young girl. Holden was embarrassed to admit that his first thought was 'oh shit, Sean had an illegitimate daughter; but then the shock of finding a teenager in the house wore off and he recognised her as the girl from the night before. \"Holden, I'd like you to meet Annabelle. Annabelle, this is Holden.\" The girl – Annabelle – stood up and awkwardly struck her hand out which Holden automatically reached forward and shook even as he was a bit confused. Had Annabelle stopped by the condo again? \"I'm sorry to intrude. I told Sean it wasn't necessary for me to stay.\" \"Don't worry, Annabelle. You're not intruding at all.\" Holden reassured Annabelle not wanting her to feel intrusive even if he was still a bit confused. \"I apologised to Annabelle for being so rude last night and offered her a tour of the condo in apology. She was just telling me about coming out to her parents.\" Sean explain somewhat. Holden nodded accepting that for the time being knowing that after she left Sean would explain the rest. They all sat back down and chatted a bit more before Annabelle announced she needed to be getting home. Sean took her home and while he was gone Holden cleared away their drink and got himself a glass of wine. It wasn't long before the door was opening and Sean had returned. The footballer walked back into the living room and flopped himself onto the couch beside Holden. \"Hey babe, how was work?\" \"Don't you 'how's work' me. What was all that?\" Holden said with a laugh. \"I realised you were right and I felt bad about being such an as so I found her and apologised and well you know the rest.\" \"How'd you even find her? She never even mentioned her name.\" \"Well it was hard but I knew she couldn't live far since she walked and I knew most houses were not families so I just went to the others and tried them all. It took awhile.\" Holden just stared at Sean in compete shock before bursting out in laughter. \"You're crazy, Sean Jackson.\" He said between laughs. \"I was an ass, I needed to apologise.\" Sean said with a shrug. Holden smiled and leaned forward to capture Sean's lips with his own. He couldn't help thinking that it had been done in true Sean Jackson fashion; extreme in its methods but quite simple.

Tucker, Danny, and others are mine, you will know them, but the rest belong solely to Robert Rodriguez and his son, Racer Max. Prologue[Chapter 2] Chapter One \"Marissa, the beautiful Ice Princess, glided over to the two young rogues. 'Young men?' She asked, 'Why were you trespassing on my palace grounds?' The two young rogues looked up into her gorgeous face and one said--\" \"I'm tired of this game. I want to be a king.\" Linus scowled up at Marissa from where he knelt. Max looked at his two new friends sighed as they started bickering. He liked both of his friends but Linus and Marissa had trouble getting along together. Suddenly, out of no where, Lavagirl appeared. The two stopped fighting and stared at the beautiful flaming girl before them. But something was different about her, Max noticed. Her hot pink hair hung limp and her eyes were full of tears. Some spilled over onto her cheeks, however they sizzled and evaporated. \"Max, you've got to help me.\" She said as more tears fell. Max walked up to her, Marissa and Linus close behind. \"What's wrong, Lavagirl?\" Max asked, concerned. \"It's Sharkboy. Something's happened to him. He's disappeared.\" \"What? What happened?\" Max sounded anxious. \"I was talking to him on the phone and the line got all fuzzy and I heard something in the background that sounded like a crash and we lost contact. I need your help to find him. Please?\" Marissa and Linus stepped up. Marissa spoke, \"Can we come too?\" \"Yes, yes, of course. Just please say you'll come and help me.\" Max smiled at her. \"Of course we'll come.\" 000000 Sharkboy awoke at the bottom of the ocean. He had put on his breather right before his sub went down so he took a deep breath and shook his head groggily. Suddenly he jerked up. Lavagirl! She's was going to be so worried. She would probably cry. Sharkboy smiled. He would like to see Lavagirl cry for him. He stood and surveyed his surrounding. He knew that he was far from Australia. If he could just get up there . . . he started swimming. Living with sharks had its advantages. He popped up out of the water and looked around. He saw land and struck out for it. When he was three-quarters of the way there he spotted a boat coming towards him. He rolled his eyes. That's just what I need , he thought. Someone to think I'm crazy and put me in a loony bin. As the person in the boat got closer, Sharkboy could see that it was a kid not much older than himself. \"Hey,\" the kid called. The boat came alongside Sharkboy. \"Are you all right?\" Sharkboy grunted. The boy sounded funny, like he had a weird accent. He wondered if the boy was from Australia. \"You're pretty far away from land.\" The boy tried again. Sharkboy grunted again. \"Get in, I'll take you to shore.\" Sharkboy sighed and hoisted himself up into the boat. The boy gasped when he saw Sharkboy's fin sticking out from the middle of his back. \"Yes it's real and no I'm not a monster.\" Sharkboy said then muttered under his breath, \"'though some would argue that last fact.\" \"Cool!\" The boy smiled. He had an interesting smile. His brown eyes lit up and his freckled cheeks widened showing slightly crooked white teeth. He was kind of good looking with a thick head of brown hair and wire-rimmed glasses on a slightly turned up nose. The fear of the strange boy in front of him seemed to be wearing off. \"So, are you half-boy half-shark?\" \"Yeah.\" \"Awesome! You have to meet my brother. He doesn't believe in things like this. My name is Danny, by the way. My brother's name is Tucker but I call him Tuck. What are you called?\" \"Sharkboy, obviously.\" \"Of course.\" The boy started the engine and the boat started towards the line of sand in the distance. \"What is this place called anyway?\" Sharkboy asked. \"North Island, New Zealand.\"[Chapter 3] Chapter Two They were in a submarine. Lavagirl was at the \"helm,\" Marissa was helping Max figure out their coordinates, and Linus was going in between the three helping out where he could. Lavagirl was heading them towards Australia. She knew she had to find Sharkboy and he had to be alive. She would kill herself if he was dead. \"We're nearing the place where Sharkboy disappeared.\" Max said. \"His sub should be right . . . here!\" Suddenly a loud tearing sound ripped through the submarine. The machine groaned to a stop. The lights flickered and went out. Everything was dead. A soft trickling was heard near the back of the sub. Marissa shivered. \"Um, guys? What's that noise?\" They all listened carefully. Lavagirl stiffened. \"The sub is leaking.\" She stated. Max gasped in horror. Linus looked sideways at him. \"What? Why is that so bad? We can just get life-jackets and float to the top. With breathers of course.\" Max turned to Linus, his eyes still on Lavagirl. \"Lavagirl can't survive in water.\" He said sadly. \"She'll die.\" There was a long silence. Lavagirl sighed. \"I can't do you any good. You go on. If I go out there I'll die. If I stay in here I will die as well but I might be able to fix the sub before the water fills it. You go on.\" Marissa and Linus started putting on life-jackets. Max looked sadly at Lavagirl. He reached out his hand and she took it. \"When you find Sharkboy,\" she said softly, \"tell him I-I . . . tell him I had hoped that we could have been more than just friends but I hope he finds a nice girl who won't burn him every time they touch. Will you give him that message for me, Max?\" \"I will.\" Lavagirl let go of his hand and turned away. A tear ran down her cheek and fell onto the control panel. When she looked over her shoulder, the kids were gone. She sighed. \"Oh Sharky, I'm going to miss you.\" 000000 Sharkboy and Danny reached the boy's house some thirty minutes later. There were sheep everywhere and Sharkboy had to sidestep several heaps of poo just walking to the house. Danny brought Sharkboy inside and called for his little brother. \"Tucker? Hey Tuck! I want you to meet someone!\" A strange whirring sound emitted from the next room over. A little boy about nine-years-old came into the room. He was in a motorized wheelchair. He brown hair like his brother but no freckles dotted his face. His cool gray eyes surveyed Sharkboy suspiciously. \"Who're you?\" He asked. \"This is Sharkboy.\" Danny answered before Sharkboy could speak. \"He's half-boy half-shark.\" \"No, duh. With a name like Shark boy what would you think he'd be? Half-dog?\" \"Well, no . . .\" \"Just tell your friend 'Steve,' or whatever his real name is, to take off the costume and get lost.\" \"His name really is Sharkboy.\" Danny turned to Sharkboy. \"Isn't it?\" Sharkboy shrugged. \"It didn't used to be. It's been so long, I don't remember my real name.\" \"Whatever.\" Tucker turned to Danny. \"Where's Mom and Dad? I came home from school and nobody was here.\" \"I'm sorry,\" Danny said. \"Mom went to work and Dad left for America. I went fishing for dinner.\" \"Did you catch anything?\" \"Yeah,\" Danny looked into his fishing bucket he had brought from the boat. \"I've got a few fish. Let me heat up the stove.\" He left the room and went into the kitchen. Tucker turned to Sharkboy. \"Who are you really?\" He asked, his eyes narrowing. \"Sharkboy.\" \"Uh, huh. Where do you live?\" \"Right now, nowhere. I'm looking for my father. He's been looking for me for nine years; ever since we were separated at sea when I was five. I was raised by sharks and became like them. Then, just recently I found out that he was looking for me and now I'm looking for him too. My sub broke though, right off the coast. Your brother found me.\" Sharkboy took a deep breath. That little story right there was the most he had ever spoken to anybody since his father disappeared. The boy looked down at Tucker to see how he would respond. Tucker just blinked at him. \"If you really are 'half-shark,' eat one of those fish. Raw.\" \"I eat them like that all the time.\" Sharkboy said and proceeded to do so with gusto. When he was finished he looked at Tucker expectantly. Tucker just stared at him expressionless. \"That's disgusting.\" He stated. Danny came back into the room to find Sharkboy with half of a fish's bone in his hand. \"What's going on?\" Tucker turned his wheelchair around and rolled away, calling over his shoulder, \"Your mate just ate a raw fish. Send him back to the circus or wherever you found him.\" Danny turned to Sharkboy. \"What was that all about?\" \"Your brother's temperamental.\" \"I know. He's been like that ever since the accident.\" \"What happened?\" \"Uh, um . . . swimming accident. Yeah, he was swimming and then he had an accident.\" Sharkboy raised his eyebrows skeptically. \"Uh, huh.\" \"Let me show you where you can stay for the night.\"[Chapter 4] Chapter Three Max and the others quietly stood at the water's edge. Max picked up a handful of sand and let it run through his fingers. After a while Marissa spoke, \"Maybe we should say a few words.\" \"She was my best friend,\" Max said softly, \"I'm really going to miss her.\" There was silence. Suddenly, Marissa gasped. \"Oh no!\" \"What?\" Linus asked. \"Sharkboy! What are we going to tell him?\" \"We're not even sure we can find him.\" \"I know, but what'll he do when he finds out his girlfriend's dead?\" Max smiled grimly through his tears. \"Probably a shark-frenzy.\" \"What's that?\" \"You don't want to know.\" 00000 Sharkboy awoke to the clicking of computer keys. His highly trained ears twitched towards the sound and he got up slowly to follow it. No one in the house stirred. He followed the clicking keys across the house and right to Tucker's door. Sharkboy hesitated then knocked softly. \"Come in.\" Came Tucker's irritated voice. Sharkboy pushed open the door and saw Tucker, looking small in his wheelchair, at a computer. On the screen was a map of New Zealand and its surrounding waters in neon green lines. Little moving dots blinked all over the portion that was water. Sharkboy stepped closer for a better look. \"Whatcha doing?\" Sharkboy asked. Suddenly the screen went blank. Tucker slowly turned his wheelchair around. Sharkboy started in shock. Tucker's right leg ended at the knee. \"Not pretty is it?\" Tucker stated. \"That's why I wear these.\" He reached over and lifted a plastic leg from his bed. He put it on carefully over his knee. He stood shakily and walked very slowly to his desk to pick up his school books. He walked unsteadily back to his wheelchair and collapsed heavily into it. \"It happened recently so I'm not used to it.\" Tucker moved his chair forward. \"It's easier just to use the wheelchair.\" Sharkboy was surprised. Tucker was talking to him civilly. He was about to speak when Tucker interrupted. \"You gonna stand there all day? I've got to get to school.\" Sharkboy stepped aside mumbling an apology but the boy was gone. He was about to leave when a breeze came through an open window and papers from Tucker's open desk drawers fluttered to the ground. Sharkboy quickly ran over and closed the window. He glanced at all the papers around his feet and stifled a groan. He knelt to pick them up. Suddenly he stopped. The pictures were of sharks, hundreds of sharks. Some were photos; some were drawings or clippings from magazines. Then there was the picture. It was of Tucker feeding a great white shark with a man standing beside him. The man's face was blurred from a fingerprint but something seemed familiar about him. Sharkboy was leaning in for a closer look when he heard something behind him. He turned sharply and there stood Danny in the doorway. Sharkboy stood quickly. \"The, I was just, uh . . .\" Danny did not seem to hear him. \"He used to love sharks.\" He said sadly. \"That was before the accident.\" He knelt on the floor and started to replace the pictures. \"What really happened to Tucker?\" asked Sharkboy. Danny sighed and sat back on his heels. Sharkboy sat also. \"It was about a year ago,\" Danny began. \"It was summer and Tuck and I were out swimming in the oceans. We were both really good swimmers so my mother and father were not worried that we might be in danger. We were daring each other to see who could go out the farthest. Stupid idea. Anyhow, one moment Tuck's laughing and bragging, the next he's flaying about and screaming. I pulled him back to shore and it was only then that I noticed his leg were gone. \"Mom was mad at Dad for awhile saying he shouldn't have made us love water so much. She got over it. Tuck didn't. It ruined him, he said. He wanted to be a professional football player; you American's know it as soccer. But now he can't. He was pretty upset.\" \"So is that why he's so mad all the time?\" \"Yeah,\" Danny sighed. \"Dad went to America to get some kind of mechanical leg doohickeys to see if it'll help him. You'd like our dad. He loves sharks. You know, you look a lot like him.\" \"I do?\" Sharkboy asked, surprised. \"Yeah, he—\" Suddenly a loud bleating noise sounded from outside. Danny stood quickly. \"Oh! I forgot the sheep!\" He ran through the house and out the door. Sharkboy followed him. The sheep were upset about something. As Danny calmed them down, Sharkboy noticed what was bothering them. Three kids were making their way towards them. Sharkboy recognized one of them as Max but could not quite place the other two. As they got closer he saw they were Marissa and Linus. They reached him and Max cried happily, \"You're alright!\" \"Why wouldn't I be?\" Sharkboy asked. \"Lavagirl told us that your sub crashed and we came to look for you.\" \"Where is Lavagirl?\" Sharkboy asked warily. The three kids looked at each other. \"We've got some bad news.\" Max said. No, don't say what I think you're going to say, Sharkboy thought. \"Lavagirl is . . . dead.\" NOOOOO!!!!! Sharkboy's mind screamed. \"How? When?\" Sharkboy's voice was monotone, not betraying his thoughts. \"Our sub broke down right where yours did—\" Sharkboy did not wait for him to finish. He darted off to the shore and dove into the large waves. \"Where does he think he's going?\" Danny asked. \"I found him farther than any man could swim. And what is a 'Lavagirl'?\"[Chapter 5] Chapter Four Sharkboy reached the sub in a matter of minutes. It was on top of his old one. He forced open the door. There was Lavagirl, limp over a control panel. Sharkboy gently picked her up and swam to shore. Max and the others took Lavagirl from him as he got out of the water. They laid her down on the ground. Sharkboy knelt over her. The kids backed up to give him some room. \"Why don't we go inside and you'll join us when you're ready?\" Danny suggested. Sharkboy nodded mutely and they left. Sharkboy reached out a hand and tenderly stroked the hot pink hair off the girl's face. Tears fell down his cheeks as he leaned forward and kissed her forehead. He sat back on his heels and stared at her for a long time. He heard a whirring sound and looked up. It was Tucker. Sharkboy was about to say something when he noticed the younger boy was not looking at him but at Lavagirl. \"Who's she?\" Tucker asked. \"She was my best friend.\" Sharkboy answered forlornly. Tucker struggled out of his wheelchair and knelt, with some difficultly, beside Sharkboy. \"What happened?\" He asked. \"She's dead.\" \"Why?\" \"She's made of lava. If she get's in water, she fizzles out. She got in water.\" \"Normally I wouldn't believe you. No one can be made from lava. But for some reason I do believe you.\" \"It's true.\" Tucker hesitantly reached out a hand and touched Lavagirl's limp one. \"She's very pretty,\" he said softly. \"I know it.\" They were silent for a while. \"You know,\" Tucker said, \"there's a volcano not far from here.\" \"Really?\" There was no mistaking the hope in Sharkboy's voice. \"Yeah, right over there, see it?\" He pointed to a far off mountain. \"No on lives near it because it's still active.\" Sharkboy helped Tucker to his feet then picked up Lavagirl. He took a deep breath then took off, leaving Tucker standing in a cloud of dust. Sharkboy soon came to the volcano. Giving Lavagirl one last peck on the cheek, he threw her in. Lava spurted out everywhere, and Sharkboy scrambled to get out of the way. A hand appeared on the rim of the volcano as Lavagirl pulled herself up. She stood there smiling brightly, and Sharkboy fought back tears of relief. Lavagirl jumped down and threw her arms around him. Sharkboy jerked away from her hot skin. She giggled. \"Oh Sharkboy! Thank you, I'm so glad you're all right.\" She took a few deep breaths then, very carefully, pressed her lips to Sharkboy's cheek. Sharkboy did not pull away. It was not burning him, it felt warm and wonderful. Lavagirl finished the kiss, and Sharkboy took her hand. \"Come on L.G.,\" he said, leading her down the volcano. \"There's someone I'd like you to meet.\" 000000 Tucker was waiting for them, having not moved since Sharkboy left. He was in his wheelchair again, and he clapped his hands joyfully as they came near. \"She's all right! I knew she would be.\" Sharkboy turned to Lavagirl. \"Lavagirl, this Tucker.\" He turned to Tucker. \"Tucker, this is Lavagirl.\" \"Hello Tucker,\" Lavagirl said, holding out her hand. \"It's very nice to meet you.\" Tucker shook her hand, blushing slightly and adverting his eyes from the pretty girl's face. \"The others are inside, waiting for you.\" Tucker said to Sharkboy. \"They don't know about her yet.\" Sharkboy let the way up to the house. He pushed open the door and walked inside with Lavagirl on one side and Tucker on the other. They were greeted with shouts of joy and laughter. Sharkboy was happy. Surrounded by his friends, he no longer felt an urgency to find his father. Right now, this was where he belonged.[Chapter 6] Chapter Five The next two weeks were wonderful. Danny and Tucker's mom was overjoyed that her sons had finally made friends and she told the kids to stay as long as they wanted. They had fun times and Sharkboy was glad to see Tucker laughing and smiling. Sometimes he would lapse into his usual surliness and would become distant. But Lavagirl would speak to him and he would brighten. Lavagirl had that effect on him. All she had to do was smile in his direction and he would beam. There was one thing about Tucker that made Sharkboy frown in thought and that was the younger boy's refusal to call him \"Sharkboy.\" He would call him Steve, Joe, Jack, any name but \"Sharkboy.\" It was a new name every day. The others found it amusing so Sharkboy decided to grin and bear it. One day they went to the beach. Tucker did not know they were going. They all went for a walk and ended up at the seashore. As soon as Sharkboy saw the water, he gave a big whoop and flipped in. The others followed suit until only Lavagirl and Tucker were on shore. Danny beckoned to Tucker. \"Come in Tuck, the plastic is waterproof. Maybe it's easier to swim than to walk.\" Tucker's face suddenly grew hard. \"No thank you.\" He said icily. \"I prefer to stay right here.\" \"Aw, come on Tucker,\" Sharkboy coaxed, \"you know you want to.\" \"How do you know what I want Kevin? You don't even know me. Now leave me alone!\" With that he wheeled himself away from the now silent kids and up to the sidewalk that led to the house. Lavagirl followed him. \"Wait, Tucker. Wait!\" Tucker stopped. \"What do you want?\" \"I want to talk. What's bothering you?\" She put a hand on the wheelchair's armrest. Tucker looked down at it. \"That you're burning my chair.\" Lavagirl quickly pulled her hand away and glanced apologetically at the blackened armrest. \"Sorry.\" She said. \"I can't help it. I guess I'm what you'd call a freak.\" \"No more than Kevin or me.\" \"How are you a freak?\" Lavagirl asked, tilting her head to the side slightly. He gestured towards his fake leg. \"For your information, it's called a freak accident. Because that's what you become afterwards . . . a freak.\" \"What happened?\" Lavagirl asked. Tucker smiled grimly. \"Shark attack,\" he said quietly. \"Oh.\" She said softly. \"I'm sorry, I didn't know.\" \"I never told you.\" Lavagirl was silent for a moment. \"Is that why you hate Sharkboy?\" Tucker shot her a look. \"I don't hate him.\" \"Then why do you call him Kevin and Steve and names like that? And you don't look him in the eye and whenever he talks about his shark family you change the subject.\" \"So?\" \"So . . . don't you think you're being a little harsh?\" \"No.\" They were silent for a while. They heard someone run up behind them. They turned and saw Sharkboy coming up to them. \"Listen, Tucker,\" he said. \"I didn't mean to hurt your feelings.\" \"You didn't.\" \"Yeah, well, I'm sorry anyway.\" \"Whatever.\" Lavagirl gave Sharkboy a worried look. Tucker did not notice and he rolled himself up to the house. Sharkboy sighed and Lavagirl took his hand. Together they watched Tucker enter the house. 00000 Tucker was back to his morose attitude. He mostly ignored everyone. Lavagirl was the only one he would talk to, and even then he got mad at her too when he was in an especially bad mood. One day Lavagirl approached him with it. The others had all gone to the beach and Lavagirl volunteered to watch Tucker. She noticed he was in a tolerable mood so she ventured a question. \"Is there something wrong, Tucker?\" He did not answer for a while. She was just about to change the subject when he spoke. \"You want to know the real reason I'm upset?\" She nodded. He fell quiet again. Lavagirl waited patiently. Finally he began to talk, his voice remained without emotion and his face became impassive as he told his story. \"Danny isn't really my brother. He's my half-brother. Mom had already had him when she divorced her husband. Then she met Dad. I guess she felt sorry for him. He had just lost a son and was very sad. They married and had me shortly after. He was elated when I started loving sharks. He was a Marine Biologist and adored sharks. \"One day when I was six, I was playing sharks and I ran up to him shouting, 'Look Dad, I'm Sharkboy!' As soon as I said it, a sad look came in his eyes and I heard him whisper, 'Oh, Taylor.' I figured that this 'Taylor' was his son. After that I always felt that Dad loved Taylor more than me. \"After the shark attack, he left for America saying he was going for a new leg, but I knew he really went to find out what happened to his kid whom he's convinced is still alive someplace. So that's why I don't like Sharkboy. He reminds me too much of Dad, who hates me because I stopped liking sharks.\" Tears sizzled on Lavagirl's cheeks. Tucker smiled wanly. \"I'm sure your Dad loves you, Tucker.\" Lavagirl said. \"He just—\" \"No.\" Tucker shook his head adamantly. \"He just cares about Taylor whom I'm sure was his own little Sharkboy.\" His voice was bitter. Lavagirl was surprised to see tears gather in Tucker's eyes. He quickly blinked them back. Lavagirl tenderly (and carefully) laid her hand on his shoulder. \"Hey,\" she said, \"it's okay to cry sometimes.\" Tucker stuck his chin out proudly; a glint entered his cool gray eyes. \"I never cry.\" Lavagirl was about to speak but held back as the kids entered the door. Tucker narrowed his eyes at Sharkboy, swiftly turned his wheelchair around, and left the room. Everyone watched him go. Sharkboy looked questioningly at Lavagirl who shook her head as if to say Not yet, I'll tell you later. Sharkboy nodded and turned back to his friends. Lavagirl sighed. She wished there was something she could do for Tucker.[Chapter 7] A/N: There has been some confusion as to why Sharkboy wouldn't know that Tucker's dad and Danny's stepdad is his father and this is why: Sharkboy hasn't yet seen Tucker's dad. They haven't met yet. Tucker's dad is in America. I hope that answered any other questions.[Chapter 8] Chapter Seven \"What are we going to do?\" Marissa asked. \"We have to get her to a volcano.\" Max replied. \"How?\" Danny asked, pushing his glasses up the ridge of his nose. \"The nearest volcano is miles away.\" \"Maybe we should call an ambulance.\" Linus ventured. \"And tell them what?\" Max countered. \"'This girl needs to be thrown in that volcano'? They wouldn't believe us.\" \"We have to get her there somehow.\" Marissa insisted. \"I could take her in the tractor.\" Danny said. \"I've been driving it since I was four.\" Max nodded. \"Let's do that then.\" They loaded Lavagirl into an old tractor jeep and were just about to take off when Danny noticed Tucker was not with them. He looked around but could not see him. He figured he was still inside the house and asked Max to go look for him. Max acquiesced and found Tucker in the parents' bedroom talking on the phone. \"No, we've got to stop this now.\" Pause. \"I don't care, one of my friends got hurt really bad.\" Pause. \"Goodbye!\" Tucker slammed the receiver down so hard the desk rattled. He turned sharply to the door and started when he saw Max. \"What're you staring at?\" Tucker snapped, narrowing his eyes. Max shifted uncomfortably. \"Do you want to come to the volcano with us?\" Tucker shook his head incredulously. \"You think my wheelchair would fit in there? Are you dumb or something?\" Max shrugged. \"You don't have to bring your wheelchair.\" Tucker looked away. \"I'm going to wait for Charlie.\" Max nodded. \"Well, okay. We'll see you.\" Tucker's voice was almost inaudible. \"Yeah, see you.\" 000000 When Sharkboy opened his eyes, something was wrong. He was lying on a floating laboratory. He sat up slowly. It looked very familiar. He realized with a shock that it was his father's laboratory. He stood up quickly. \"Dad?\" He called out. \"Dad!\" He heard something behind him. He turned excitedly, expecting his father. What he saw instead shocked him. It was another Sharkboy! Sharkboy was confused. How could there be two of him? He was even more confused when Sharkboy #2 lifted his fist and socked Sharkboy in the jaw. Sharkboy fell to the ground. He sprang up, rubbing his jaw. \"What was that for?\" He asked his double angrily, still bewildered over the incredulousness of the situation. \"That's for being such a wimp.\" Sharkboy #2 sneered. \"Crying over nothing. It's pathetic.\" \"What do you mean nothing?\" Sharkboy asked, a bit uncertain about talking to himself. \"She's my best friend. I loved her!\" \"She doesn't love you.\" \"How do you know?\" \"She's a girl . They hold the worst grudges. Do you think she'll love you after you killed her? Please.\" \"You don't know what you're talking about.\" Sharkboy said sullenly. \"Don't I? We're sharks. Sharks can't fight their instincts. It wasn't your fault you got angry. She was bugging you. She always bugs you. She hates you.\" Sharkboy's jaw ground back and forth. He drew back his arm and threw a punch as his double. Sharkboy #2 just stepped aside and grabbed Sharkboy's hand. Twisting it sharply, the double grabbed Sharkboy's leg and twist that two so Sharkboy flipped and landed hard on his back. Sharkboy #2 jumped on him and started pummeling Sharkboy's body with iron-like fists. Sharkboy felt himself slipping into unconsciousness. Suddenly he seemed to hear Lavagirl's voice calling to him from the darkness. She was telling him to get up, to fight back, to win. Sharkboy struggled to stay conscious. Sharkboy #2 was relentless. \"I believe in you, Sharky. You can beat this. I know you can.\" Sharkboy gathered all his strength and felt his fist hit the mouth of his assailant with such force that the attacker flew off him and hit the deck of the lab. Sharkboy jumped on him and suddenly the tables were turned in Sharkboy's favor. \"You lying scum,\" he growled through gritted teeth, \"she believes in me and I will always be her best friend.\" The second Sharkboy began to shimmer and slowly disappear. Soon Sharkboy was just punching air. He fell to the ground, sore and breathing heavily. Through half-swollen shut eyes, he saw the shape of Lavagirl walking towards him. She knelt down next to him and took his head in her lap. He noticed foggily that she wasn't in her usual attire. She was dressed in a short hot pink dress and her skin was normal, and although her hair was still fiery pink, it hung straight down on her shoulders. All this went by him in seconds. He closed his eyes as she ran her fingers through his hair. \"You did it, Sharky.\" She whispered in his ear. \"You defeated the evil and held on to the truth.\" She gently pressed her lips to his forehead. He breathed in her sweet scent and smiled. \"I love you.\" She whispered against his skin. \"I'm not angry with you for what you did. I never want you to change.\" \"I love you, Lavagirl.\" Sharkboy murmured. He felt a cold wind and grass under his head. He opened his eyes and found himself staring up into a blue sky, solid ground beneath him. A strange sound reached his ears and when he sat up he found he was surrounded by bleating sheep. He saw he had fallen asleep where he had fallen, miles away from Danny's house and Lavagirl. Sharkboy ran to the water and had fish for breakfast and thought about his dream. Lavagirl loved him. He felt warm all over. She loved him for who he was and she did not want him any different. When he was finished eating, he jumped into the water and started out for Danny's house . . . and Lavagirl.[Chapter 9] Chapter Eight It was a long, hot journey up to the volcano. When they finally got there the question was \"who is going to the top to throw her in?\" In the end, Max decided to go. He picked up Lavagirl's limp form and half-carried, half dragged her to the top of the volcano. He dropped her into the cavernous hole, and then scurried back down as fast as he could. The kids waited with baited breath. After a few long seconds, she appeared. Slowly she walked towards them, Max ran to meet her. As he got closer he noticed she looked sad. \"Are you okay?\" He asked. She nodded, then shook her head, then sighed. \"Max, can you do something for me?\" Max nodded. \"Anything.\" \"Max. Make me normal. Sharkboy and I are not compatible like this. His powers and mine can't mix. Please make me normal. I'll do anything. I just want to be with Sharkboy. Please.\" Tears gathered in her eyes. Max sighed. \"If it's what you really want.\" \"It is.\" Max his eyes and daydreamed. He dreamed of a beautiful girl with pink hair. Her skin was creamy and soft, her outfit was a plain short dress that brushed her knees. Pink sandals covered her feet. Max opened his eyes and there she stood, completely transformed. She held out her hand strained as if pushing something. Nothing happened. She smiled happily. \"Thank you, Max! Now I can be with Sharkboy! You won't regret this.\" \"Let's hope I don't.\" Max muttered under his breath. 00000 Sharkboy reached Danny's house around midday. The house was dark and it did not look like anyone was home. Sharkboy walked up to the door and slowly pushed it open. He stuck his head in. Nobody was there. \"Hello?\" He called. \"Anybody home?\" He heard the familiar whirring sound of Tucker's wheelchair. A few seconds later Tucker himself entered the room. \"Hey Napoleon,\" he said sourly. \"So I'm Napoleon now?\" Sharkboy asked happily. \"Yeah.\" \"Where is everyone?\" \"Where do you think? They took her to the volcano.\" \"Oh good. Do you have anything to eat? I'm starving.\" Tucker looked at him disdainfully. \"You really don't care do you?\" \"Care about what?\" \"About Lavagirl? That she died? That you killed her.\" \"Oh, I care. She forgave me.\" \"You saw her?\" \"Well, not exactly. But I have a feeling that she has.\" \"If it were me I wouldn't.\" \"If it were you I probably wouldn't want your forgiveness.\" Tucker's face grew hard. Sharkboy grimaced. \"Listen, Tucker, I didn't mean—\" But Tucker had left. Sharkboy slammed his fist on the wall, shaking the pictures hanging there. \"Great Sharkboy. Real smooth.\" He muttered to himself. Later that evening Sharkboy was sitting at the kitchen table with his head in his hands, staring at the burn marks that littered the floor which he could see through the hole in the table. Just then the front door swung open. Sharkboy quickly stood and ran over to greet the kids coming in. Max, Marissa, Linus, and Danny were standing in the doorway. \"Hey guys, where's Lavagirl?\" Sharkboy asked, not wasting time with salutations. \"I think you're going to need to come up with a different name for her.\" Marissa said with a sly smile on her face. \"Why?\" Sharkboy asked, puzzled. They parted revealing the pink adorned girl behind them. Sharkboy stared at her in shock. She looked exactly as she had in his dream. She smiled and ran to him. \"Sharkboy!\" She cried, throwing herself into his arms. He stumbled back as she collided with him, his arms out in surprise. Suddenly he realized this was the first time they had ever hugged. He wrapped his arms around her and held her tightly. She felt so good in his arms. She pulled away slightly so she could look him in the face. He swallowed hard. \"How—why are you—how are you—\" he stammered. \"I wanted to be with you, Sharkboy.\" She whispered. Her hand went up to stroke his cheek. \"I love you.\" Tears glistened in Sharkboy's eyes and he struggled to keep them back. He pulled her into him and placed his mouth on her hair. \"You know I would never, ever hurt you.\" He whispered. \"I'm so sorry.\" \"I forgive you. With all of my heart.\" He took her face in his hands and kissed her gently. It was a short kiss but a meaningful one. They hugged once more and as they did they heard applause. They drew apart, blushing. Marissa was crying and Linus started whistling. Sharkboy laughed. Soon they were all laughing and crying. A whirring sound near the door made Sharkboy look up. There sat Tucker, observing the spectacle in front of him. The two boys' eyes met. Something clicked in Sharkboy's heart and he felt like he had seen those eyes before. Suddenly eyes hardened and the moment was broken as two gray fireballs bore into Sharkboy's head. If looks could kill Sharkboy was a dead man. He was taken aback by the measure and force of hatred that was emanating from this small nine-year-old boy. Sharkboy turned away but he could still feel the heat of the stare in his back, and he could not shake the feeling that he had seen those cool, gray eyes before. A long time ago. A/N: Thanks for reviewing everyone! I really appreciate it and I'm glad ya'll are enjoying it. :-D[Chapter 10] Chapter Nine The next week was Heaven for Sharkboy and Lavagirl. They did everything together. Lavagirl was overjoyed that she could swim with her friends and not fizzle out. Sharkboy was ecstatic that he could embrace Lavagirl without getting burnt for his trouble. Max, Marissa, Linus, and Danny were happy that their friends were happy. Danny's mom was not very happy with the house's desperate condition, but with six kids fixing everything, she got over it. Tucker stayed in his room mostly. He would not come out and would yell if anyone tried to come in. Sharkboy felt that any chance of becoming friends with the handicapped boy had been destroyed that day of the Shark Frenzy. Sharkboy spoke to Lavagirl about it and she sympathized with him, but there was nothing she could do. Tucker had even stopped talking to her. The kids did not know what was wrong with him. They finally agreed, by unanimous decision, to leave him alone. 00000 One day Tucker came out of his room. No one spoke to him and all were amazed when he was the one who started speaking first. \"John,\" he said to Sharkboy, \"can you please go down to the beach with me?\" Sharkboy started in surprise and turned to Lavagirl. \"Do you mind?\" \"Of course not,\" she replied, kissing his cheek. Sharkboy followed Tucker outside. His eyes widened when Tucker stood slowly and started walking, albeit unsteadily, beside him. He stumbled a few times and Sharkboy put his hand on Tucker's shoulder to steady him. Surprisingly the small boy let him. After a while he spoke. \"What was your dad like?\" Sharkboy, startled by the abrupt question, answered carefully, warily. \"Well, he is a marine biologist. He loves sharks and—\" \"What does he look like?\" Tucker interrupted. \"He's got dark hair like me and gray eyes . . . kinda like yours.\" Sharkboy paused. \"Very much like yours.\" Tucker inhaled sharply and stopped walking. Sharkboy turned to him. \"What did you say your real name was?\" Tucker asked. Suddenly the boy seemed frightened to Sharkboy. His voice was apprehensive and reminded Sharkboy of a clam, reading to close up any second. \"I never told you. I don't remember.\" Sharkboy said. \"Is it . . .\" Tucker swallowed nervously, \". . . Taylor?\" Something leaped inside Sharkboy's heart. That name . . . he had heard it before. Where had he heard that name before? Was it his name? Tucker was still waiting for an answer. Sharkboy shook off the strange sensation he was feeling and looked down at Tucker. \"It could be, and so could all those other names you've given me.\" Tucker looked thoughtful. \"Describe your dad in detail. Any moles? Scars? Unusual characteristics?\" Sharkboy frowned in thought, searching for the picture in his mind that was his father. It had been so long since he had seen him. . . . Sharkboy started to panic. What if he could not remember him? What if he had forgotten his own father's face? Tucker sighed, a long, shaky sigh. He pulled a small photograph from his pocket. He held it out to Sharkboy. Sharkboy stared at it hard. It was of a family. A dad, a mom, and two boys. It was Tucker's family. Tucker's dad. He looked so much like Sharkboy's dad. Sharkboy looked up into Tucker's gaze. Something clicked inside Sharkboy's head as he put the pieces together. The shark pictures, the familiar man in the blurred photo, Tucker's eyes . . . his father's eyes. Tucker saw the light dawn in Sharkboy's eyes and knew he had been correct about Sharkboy's true identity. This was Taylor, his father's favorite . . . and his half-brother. Sharkboy started to speak, to say something, anything to pacify the growing hunger to find out more about the man he had not seen in nine years. Before he could say anything however, his highly trained ears heard a slight movement behind him. He turned around to face whatever had disturbed the space behind him and was met with a hard fist. Everything went black.[Chapter 11] Chapter Ten It was getting dark and Lavagirl was worried. Sharkboy and Tucker were still out and the tide had risen. She could not see anything out the window. She turned away. The other kids were patching up the floor and she went to join them. \"Are they back yet?\" Max asked. Lavagirl shook her head. \"Don't worry,\" Danny said, pushing his glasses up the bridge of his nose. \"Tuck knows this side of the island like the back of his hand. They won't get lost.\" \"Then where are they?\" Lavagirl asked. Marissa and Linus exchanged worried glances. \"Do you want to go out and look?\" Linus asked. \"I think we should.\" The kids dusted themselves off and Danny left a note for his mom. They went outside and started walking along the water. After a while Danny stopped next to a short wooden pole. \"It's gone,\" he said incredulously. \"What's gone?\" Marissa asked. \" Aquamarie , my dad's fishing boat. I left it tied to this pole and now it's gone.\" \"Did Tucker take it?\" Max asked. \"Looks like it,\" Danny turned back to the house. \"Where are you going?\" Linus asked. \"To get Lilly , my step-dad's boat. We have to catch up to them. It's dangerous out there and Tucker can't swim in deep water.\" The rest of the kids followed him, and in a few minutes they were sailing out to sea. 00000 Sharkboy awoke upright against a wall. The calm rocking of the floor told him that he was on a ship out in deep water. He moved forward to inspect his surroundings but found he could not. Looking down he saw that his ankles and wrists were shackled to the wall he was standing against. He strained to get out but to no avail. He was trapped. Sharkboy tried to contain his growing panic and took a long, deep breath. He thought of Tucker. Was he in the same predicament? Sharkboy wondered if Max, Lavagirl, and the rest of the kids had noticed he was missing. He hoped so. Just then the door across from where he was bolted opened. Tucker, walking unsteadily on his plastic leg, came up to him. \"Hey Tucker,\" Sharkboy said, trying to sound jovial, his voice shaking slightly, \"what's going on here, man? Come on, get me down from here.\" \"Uncomfortable?\" Tucker asked, smirking. \"Yeah, come on man.\" \"Good\" came the sharp reply. Sharkboy frowned, confused. \"What's wrong?\" \"Well Taylor, it's like this—can I call you Taylor?\" \"Um, okay.\" \"It's like this Taylor, I work for a guy. He hates sharks as much as I do. His wife was killed in a shark attack you see, so he actually hates them more than me. Anyway, since you seem all 'buddy-buddy' with the sharks we're going to use you as live bait. The sharks see you in trouble; they come to help you and . . . bam! No more sharks. We'll blow them out of the water.\" \"Why are you doing this?\" Sharkboy was silently hoping that Tucker would make him angry and that by going a Shark Frenzy he could break the iron shackles that held him. He was not prepared for the words that emitted from the small boy in front of him. \"It was a shark attack. About a year ago. I lost my leg and my for sharks. Naturally when something hurts you, you don't like it. Right?\" \"Uh, I guess.\" \"So Dad wasn't very happy that I stopped liking sharks. I noticed he seemed more distant but thought he'd get over it. He didn't. That's when he started looking for you full force. He practically abandoned my family searching around the world. Well we don't need you. We were fine until you came. You ruined everything! If you hadn't shown up Dad would've gotten over you and come back to me and Danny! I hate you! Do you hear me? I hate you!\" With that Tucker, the boy who never cried, collapsed on to the floor, tears coming out it great wracking sobs. Sharkboy watched awkwardly, not knowing what to say. After a few minutes Tucker controlled himself enough to stand. He gave Sharkboy a haunted look full of hurt and anger. He turned away and walked, unsteadily, out the door, shutting it behind him, and leaving Sharkboy all alone with the hate filled words echoing through his head.[Chapter 12] [Chapter 13] Chapter Twelve Sharkboy slowly dragged Tucker's limp form onto the boat and they sped away. Lavagirl held him in her arms, tears sizzling down her cheeks as she attempted to warm his frozen body. Sharkboy gently pressed his strong hands into Tucker's chest, trying to rid water from his lungs. About ten feet from shore Tucker awoke. Water gushed from his mouth and nose like a fountain. He coughed hard several times before fainting from exhaustion. When they reached the beach, they quickly tied up the boat and carried Tucker to the house. Sharkboy laid him carefully on his bed. Everyone left the room except for Sharkboy. He sat at the computer and noticed that the neon green lines he saw from before outlined a map of the world with flashing, moving green dots that, Sharkboy assumed, were supposed to represent sharks. He heard Tucker stir but did not turn until a faint voice called out. \"Sharkboy, is that you?\" Sharkboy started in surprise and came over to where Tucker lay with his eyes still closed. \"You called me 'Sharkboy.' He said stupidly. He could not think of anything else. \"I'm sorry,\" Tucker continued. \"I'm sorry about everything. It's all my fault really. It's my fault you killed Lavagirl, it's my fault Dad left, and it's my fault he doesn't love me anymore.\" Tears started trickling down Tucker's cheeks through still closed eyelids. They mixed with the salty water already on his pale face. Sharkboy felt a sense of déjà vu. This time however, he knew what to say. He sat down on the bed and looked down at the pitiful little body lying before him. This was his brother. Granted they were only half-brothers, but brothers nonetheless. \"Hey, now you listen to me, kid,\" he said sternly. \"Your father loves you very much. Nothing you say or do is going to change that. Now your dad was upset when you lost your leg and probably didn't know what to say to you. People make mistakes when they're upset. I should know. What's going on with your dad has nothing to do with you not liking sharks anymore. You are entitled to your opinion. Your dad should respect that.\" Tucker opened his cool gray eyes and stared up at Sharkboy. \"He's your dad too,\" he said softly. \"I know,\" Sharkboy said, releasing a deep breath. \"And you're my little brother.\" \"I know.\" Tucker looked away. After a few seconds he looked back hesitantly. \"Do you—do you hate me for what I did?\" Sharkboy hesitated as well. He was about to say he had to think about it, but the hopeful and vulnerable look in Tucker's eyes stopped him. \"No. I don't hate you. You're my brother. I could never hate you.\" There was a pause. \"Do you still hate me?\" Tucker thought for a moment, turning his face away from Sharkboy. Sharkboy waited patiently. This boy had been through much these past few weeks. Finally he turned back. \"You saved my life,\" he said. \"Why?\" \"Because you're flesh and blood. That bond is not easily broken.\" Tucker sighed. \"I guess not. No, I don't hate you anymore.\" \"Good. And, uh, you don't have to call me 'Sharkboy' if you don't want to. You said my name was 'Taylor' right? Well, you can call me that.\" Tucker smiled, the first smile he had ever given Sharkboy. \"Heck yes I'm going to call you Taylor. 'Sharkboy's' such a lame name.\" \"Hey!\" Sharkboy glared, faking indignation. Tucker laughed a high, carefree laugh. \"Get me in my wheelchair,\" he said. \"I want to tell everyone.\" They went into the living room where everyone was gathered. They had been explaining to Tucker and Danny's mom what had been going on while she was gone for she had demanded them to tell her. When Tucker and Sharkboy entered the room, silence settled. Tucker's mom rushed to him and started hugging and kissing him, much to his disgust. When he convinced her that he was okay and to back off, he turned to the rest of them. \"Everybody,\" Tucker announced. \"I would like you to meet my half-brother Taylor.\" Everyone, except Lavagirl, gasped. \"Brothers!\" Danny exclaimed. \"No wonder you look so much alike!\" \"Oh my!\" Marissa gasped. \"Wow\" was all Linus managed. \"I thought you looked like brothers.\" Max said. \"Taylor?\" the mom said. \"You're Taylor?\" Lavagirl simply smiled through tears of joy. \"Finally,\" she whispered.[Chapter 14] Epilogue Tucker and Danny's dad, Robert Saunter, gazed outside the airplane window to the immense ocean below. He had gotten a call from his family saying that he should come home quickly and meet a very important person who was dying to see him. He did not know any important people so he assumed, with great joy and anticipation, that it must be his long lost son. He hopped the first plane to New Zealand and was now waiting impatiently for it to land. It finally did and he raced down the gangplank to the gate. Standing there to greet him were his wife, Danny, Tucker, some kids he did not recognize, and the boy. The boy was so tall and much older than he remembered. He was wearing a long, loose, black jacket over a red shirt and black, baggy jeans. His hair was short and spiky, but there was no doubt in this father's heart and mind that this was his son. \"Taylor.\" He said softly. Then he cried, regardless of the stares, \"Taylor! Sharkboy, my son!\" The boy's eyes lit up and he ran to him. \"Dad!\" The boy cried. Max, Lavagirl, and their friends looked on happily as the marine biologist and his \"Sharkboy\" clasped one another in a tight embrace. Even Tucker found he could smile, he knew his time with his dad would come. And boy, would he have stories to tell him. About how he had met his half-brother and how together they had waited excited to see him again. Sharkboy had started searching for his father and had ended up finding a family. What a great ending to a great adventure. The End A/N: So, that's all folks! I'm glad you all enjoyed it. It certainly came to my surprise when I realized how many reviews I had. I really didn't think this story was that good. :-P Well, \"See you in another life, eh brothah?\"","LastChapter":"Epilogue Tucker and Danny's dad, Robert Saunter, gazed outside the airplane window to the immense ocean below.

I hope you guys like the AU-ness; I really couldn't get this plot line out of my head. Maybe it's because this is pretty much exactly my predicament, except without any positive events. Oh well, I hope you like this first chapter and please review! :) Holden had no idea how to perceive the boy sitting across the room from him. The teenager was minding his own business, sitting at his lunch table with his friends, eating his sandwich, and yet Sean frigging Jackson, the star of the football team, kept looking at him. Sean was douche, totally and completely rude to anyone whose pants he wasn't looking to get into. And yet here he was, staring in this oddly intrigued way at Holden , proud president of the Future Business Leaders of America, and member of various other clubs that just weren't cool. Well, whatever; let Sean stare. He was smoking hot, after all, and Holden wasn't about to pretend that he hadn't fantasized one too many times about the other boy. He returned to the conversation at hand, however, but was constantly watching Sean from his peripheral vision. A week went by with this same behavior, and finally Holden turned to Sean and just smiled. He smiled as well as he could (which in his opinion was just a bit off-putting), looking right into the football player's eyes. Sean seemed a bit caught off-guard by this, and Holden turned back toward his friends, leaving the other boy to contemplate his reaction. \"It's just a party, Holden; it's no big deal.\" Kate said, taking a seat on Holden's bed as he dressed as nicely as he could. \"Yeah, but Sean's probably going to be there…\" \"You are too self-conscious, you're sexy, Holden. You've liked the boy for three years now, I'm pretty sure you've looked worse.\" \"What's that supposed to mean?\" Holden questioned, spinning toward her. \"It means it's time to go.\" Kate replied, standing and grabbing Holden's arm, leading him out of his room. They arrived at the party just as various masses of teenagers were getting crazy. The chaperone-free gathering was being held at the lake, which just made Holden a bit more nervous that he was going to be caught by police in an open area where minors were in possession of alcohol. This was his first party; as a high school senior, he thought it necessary that he eventually attend one before graduation. Kate immediately hurried over to where various people were dancing, socializing with some girls that Holden recognized as being on the cheerleading squad. Holden was left without a single friend, no one seeming the least bit familiar. He couldn't even spot Sean amongst the crowd. Eventually, however, he spotted a boy on the A.V. club named Kelvin; he was dancing alone to some rap song that Holden didn't know. \"Hey!\" Holden said over the loud music. \"Oh, hey Holden; having a good time?\" Kelvin asked. \"Well…not exactly. I don't really know anyone.\" \"Pshh, just start dancing; that's all anyone does at these things. Well, that's always what people start doing. I mean look at Sean Jackson! He's banging at least one of those girls tonight!\" Holden turned toward where Kelvin was now pointing, and noticed several girls grinding madly against Sean. His stomach sunk, and he immediately felt like leaving. However, Kate had driven them and was nowhere in sight, so it seemed that he was stuck in the situation. \"I'm going to go sit down.\" Holden told Kelvin absentmindedly, not really caring whether or not the other boy followed him. \"Are you sure? The party's just getting started!\" Kelvin exclaimed, swigging a beer Holden hadn't realized he was holding. Holden nodded and walked over to the where the lake found the ground, taking a seat far away from anyone else and watching the water lapping at the pebbles several inches from his feet. He sighed, and checked his phone every few moments as minutes turned into an hour, Kate nowhere in sight when he bothered to turn around. Soon, the music died down a bit and Holden knew that those who had drunk too much were beginning to regurgitate their beverages. \"Did you stake out the whole shore, or is there some space for company?\" Holden turned at the sound of the deep voice, and found Sean standing behind him, clutching a beer in his hand but nonetheless seeming completely sober as he looked down at the other boy. \"N-No, you can sit down.\" Holden replied, feeling his heart leaping to his throat and threatening to spill from his mouth. Sean nodded and took a seat comfortably. Holden noted that he sat closer then he really needed to, but not enough for them to be touching. \"So what was that at lunch the other day?\" Sean asked, as silence settled over their piece of the party. \"What do you mean?\" \"That crazy smile you gave me; what did it mean?\" Holden turned to look at Sean, who looked right back at him. Holden really wished he hadn't, because now his heart was ricocheting throughout the inside of chest, hindering any coherent thought as Holden looked into the other boy's eyes. \"You're…well, you're always staring at me.\" Holden replied. \"So I decided to respond.\" Sean chuckled, a deep sound from his chest that gave Holden chills. He took a sip of his beer, smiling. \"Look, Holden…man, I didn't think this would be so hard. Actually, I never thought I'd do anything about this.\" \"What?\" Holden asked, confusion seeming to aid the process of conversation on his part. \"Some people I've talked to, well, they think you're…you know, that you like guys.\" Holden had to take a deep breath to keep from hyperventilating, but Sean was speaking again before he could reply. \"Is that true?\" Holden was stuck in a very bad place; Kate was the only one that knew the truth about him, and here Sean was, outright asking him? \"Yeah, it's true.\" Holden said before he brain could even register what he was saying. He felt the aftereffects immediately, throat drying and eyes averting Sean's. There was silence, and then Sean spoke. \"Well…I think I do too.\" Holden looked up at him immediately, but now Sean was gazing out at the lake, not wanting to make eye contact. \"At least…well, I like you.\" Holden really couldn't believe what was happening. Sean sipped his beer, and then finally turned to look at him. \"Really?\" Holden asked, knowing how ridiculous of a reply that was, but his brain just wasn't cooperating. \"Yeah, why else would I tell you something like that?\" Sean asked, a bit incredulous. \"Well, sometimes jocks set up jokes and…I don't know, Sean, you're just…why me? I guess that's what I want to know.\" \"Why not?\" He questioned in return. \"You're hot as hell . Plus you're smart and nice and stuff. I don't know, I haven't really considered why I like you; I'm still trying to grasp the fact that I like a guy. But…I want to try this; are you in for that?\" Sean's eyes looked simply too vulnerable at that moment, and Holden couldn't take it. Without thinking, he reached out and grasped the hand that Sean didn't have on his beer, the one resting on his raised knee, and took it in his own. Sean didn't even flinch, instead holding Holden's gaze in his, seeming to know the other boy's answer. \"We can't do anything here…how about we take a drive?\" Sean asked, raising an eyebrow in question. \"That sounds good.\" Holden replied. Sean stood first and helping Holden up with his free hand, seeming to have an incredible amount of strength in just one arm. The two boys discreetly left the party, Holden texting Kate that he was okay and would be back soon. His mind was spinning, his heart still performing all forms of acrobatics within his chest as he climbed into Sean's truck. He had no idea what to expect, and he didn't really care.[Chapter 2] Decode By: KellyCRocker59 Chapter Two Man this week was busy! Sorry it took so long to update, and this will probably leave you unsatisfied, but I'm sorry! It was a great place to stop for me :). I'll try to update faster for the next chapter, and until then, I hope you enjoy this! P.S. Go see Easy A; it's amazing :D \"So…\" Holden began, speaking over the soft hum of a Top 40 song playing on the radio. They drove down a dirt road, slowly, lights as dim as Sean could make them. His truck was nice; a large black vehicle with nary a stain or scratch blemishing its surface. \"No one knows about me. I can't tell my parents, and I definitely can't tell any of the guys on the team. So if this develops into anything…\" \"We can't be public; I get it. I understand.\" Holden replied, finishing Sean's thought for him. \"I just wanted to be upfront with you. You know, so if you want out, then now would be the time.\" \"My parents don't know either; the only person that knows is Kate.\" \"I figured; you two are pretty inseparable. All the guys always talk about what it would be like to get in her pants. Are you going to tell her about us?\" \"It's a little fast to be saying us , isn't it? We haven't even been talking for half an hour.\" Holden replied, turning and attempting to catch Sean's eye, but just getting a side view of his face in the dim interior of the truck. \"Whatever, I mean me. I just don't want it getting around…\" \"I get that, but she's my best friend; she wouldn't tell.\" \"I just want to be sure.\" Sean said, turning toward Holden and stopping the truck, cutting the engine. They were parked in the middle of nowhere, and the intensity held within the football player's eyes could have set the woods ablaze. \"Okay…\" Holden whispered, but then Sean was leaning over, and Holden realized that there hadn't been hostility in the other teenager's eyes. His lips were suddenly against Sean's, the larger boy's facial hair rubbing against Holden's face in a scratchy but welcoming way. His first kiss and it was unimaginable. Sean was pushing him back now, large hands splayed across Holden's back, guiding him down onto the roomy front seat of the truck. Sean's hands toyed with the hem of Holden's button-up shirt, and Holden was clueless as to what to do, settling his hands upon Sean's chest, muscle tense beneath his fingers, through the t-shirt he wore. His mind was clouded with emotions he had yet to experience at such heights, and Sean was pulling at his shirt now, a hand finding its way along Holden's stomach. \"S-Stop…\" Holden gasped, pulling away from Sean's lips, a difficult task considering how euphoric they made him feel. Sean looked disheveled, eyes half-lidded, panting. But he had stopped, one hand resting on Holden's back and one still beneath his shirt. \"What?\" He asked, moving to recline on his elbows on the sparse cushion on either side of Holden's face. \"I…this is just moving really fast, and I just don't know how to take this.\" Holden replied, averting his gaze from Sean's eyes. \"What do you mean? I like you, I assumed you like me, especially by the way you were reciprocating just now…\" \"Yeah, I do like you; I've liked you for a really long time, actually, which is why I don't want to just be a…a sex buddy for you.\" \"What, are you some kind of prude?\" Sean questioned, raising an eyebrow. His tone was serious; he wasn't mocking him. Holden looked away, eyes focusing on a string that sprouted from the cushioned back of the seat he was lying on. \"No, but this is the first conversation I think we've ever had. I'm not ready to have sex, much less in a vehicle…\" Sean sat up abruptly, not looking at Holden. \"What? What's wrong with you?\" Holden questioned, sitting up as well. \"I just…we should just get back to the party.\" Sean replied, detached. \"What, is that all you wanted; sex?\" Sean didn't respond, turning the key in the ignition and starting the truck, driving swiftly back to the party. They didn't speak, Holden completely confused as to what had just taken place. No one was at the party when Sean reached the destination, so they both just sat there, neither sure what to say. \"Can you take me home?\" Holden asked, attempting to break the silence. \"Yeah.\" Sean answered simply. He wasted no time, driving well over the speed limit the entire way. Finally, they reached Holden's house, but he just sat there, wondering how what had begun as the night that his entire youth had craved had become the post-breakup silence he believed only existed within the realm of the Molly Ringwald and Reese Witherspoon universe, where love bound two people eternally past the end credits. He turned to Sean, not really feeling so much heartbroken as just awkward. \"I guess I'll see you at school?\" Holden proposed. Sean shrugged, arm thrown over the steering wheel in a way that would have made him look ridiculously hot if not for the circumstance. Holden sighed and opened the door, getting out of the truck. He turned to look back at Sean, but the football player was already shoving the vehicle into drive and stomping upon the gas. Holden just stood there in front of his house, the dim street lights illuminating the lonely figure on the sidewalk; had he really already been broken up with after an hour-long date?[Chapter 3] Decode By: KellyCRocker59 Chapter Three This was a rather difficult chapter for me to get right; I hope it turned out well, and I hope to get to hear what you all think! Holden sighed as he shoved the door of his car shut, heading toward the entrance of the high school as morning led the sun to a peak in the sky. He had spent much of Sunday dwelling upon the events of the previous night, and how Sean had acted. His guarded, cold behavior had come out of nowhere, and without his phone number, Holden had no way of questioning him. He wasn't even sure that he should get to question the other boy; after all, their first conversation had consisted of a short make out session followed by Sean pulling away and wanting practically nothing to do with him. Regardless, he entered the school hoping both that he would not see Sean and that Sean would in some way speak to him. \"So…where did you go during the last half of the party?\" \"It doesn't matter.\" Holden replied, pulling a textbook from the confines of his spacious locker; senior year had proven to be light on cargo. Kate stood, leaning against the locker beside his, an eyebrow raised in question, unsatisfied with his response. \"Honestly, Kate, it really doesn't matter.\" He continued, and then closed his locker, walking down the hallway. She didn't follow him; it was currently study hall, a period that lasted half an hour between the last two classes of the day. Holden's hope of ever having a conversation with Sean Jackson was fading, his heart feeling more like a weight in his chest. Then, as he passed a small storage closet, a hand tightened and his arm and he was pulled into a dark expanse in which he could barely make out anything. \"Hey.\" He recognized the voice immediately; Sean, who was gripping his forearms tightly, attempting to make out his face with as much difficulty as Holden was having. \"What do you want, Sean?\" Holden asked, the textbook gripped tightly against his chest. His heart raced now, feeling weightless. He attempted to saturate his tone in as much annoyance as possible, but feared that he was unsuccessful. \"I wanted to talk to you about the other night; look, I'm really sorry.\" \"What?\" Holden breathed, following a long pause. This wasn't what he was expecting from a boy that he was sure had enough pride to fuel a political campaign. \"I wasn't lying when I said I like you, Holden; I do. I, well, I like you a lot. And that's kind of what threw me off the other night. I had you down, was planning on doing all sorts of things with you, and then you just pushed me away. It made me think about myself, and whether I'm even ready to be with you. I've never wanted a girl as bad as I wanted you that night, and it kind of freaked me out.\" \"So, what, you're saying you can't handle being with me?\" Holden questioned, raising an eyebrow unconsciously. Sean shook his head, an action Holden barely saw in the dark. \"I'm saying that that was why I acted the way I did; I just got to thinking about you and me and how I should deal with these feelings. I don't like playing games; I'm trying to tell you that I wasn't meaning to give you mixed signals.\" Holden became hyperaware of Sean's hands now, running along his forearms in an unsure manner, concerned by Holden's immediate lack of response. \"So what does that mean for you and me?\" Holden finally managed to respond, trying his best to keep his voice steady. \"It means that I really want to…date you, I guess?\" Sean replied in question. Holden nodded. \"Yeah, I guess that is what it's called.\" He could sense Sean's smile spreading wide across his face. \"Alright; so do you want to go out with me Saturday night, Holden Wilson?\" Holden couldn't help but return the smile. \"Yeah, that sounds great.\" The rest of the week Holden spent feeling more sexual tension that he believed was possible. Every day at lunch, he felt Sean's eyes on him, and when he returned his gaze, if only briefly, Sean didn't even attempt to seem as though he hadn't been staring, which left Holden's cheeks stained red. When they passed in the hallway, Sean didn't bother to move, instead slowing so that when their shoulders collided it was a soft bump instead of a harsh crash. This didn't keep Kate from muttering about how rude people were in the hallways, but Holden ignored her, feeling that it was best to leave his closest friend in the dark. Then, Friday came. It was a game night, so all of the football players wore their jerseys proudly through the halls. Holden couldn't help but consider how hot Sean looked in his, the number '42' emblazoned upon the front and back in white, against the red fabric. Sean offered him a cocky grin, one Holden at once found insufferable and adorable at the same time. Holden decided, upon careful consideration following their encounter on Monday, that he should probably attend the game that night. It was at the high school, and he didn't have anything else especially pressing to do, so he only saw fit that he should support the other boy in some manner. He had never been to a football game, and so he stopped by Ms. Albart's room to buy a Pep Club t-shirt in support of the football team. \"You're really going to the game tonight?\" Kate questioned, and Holden could see the incredulity spread wide across her face without even turning from his locker. \"Yeah; I figure it's our senior year, and I might as well go to at least one football game before it's over. Will you go with me?\" \"Not that I would if I could, but I have to work tonight; looks like you're on your own with this one.\" She replied, turning to her own locker, beside Holden's, and grabbing a book to push into her bag. Holden couldn't help but get nervous at the thought of attending the game alone, but his mind quickly manipulated the situation; he would simply ask someone else to go. He did have other friends besides Kate, after all. \"No problem; I'll just ask Julia to go with me.\" Julia was one of Holden's close friends, president of Future Teachers of America and an advent student teacher at the elementary. In fact, the only time Holden really got to talk to her now was during lunch. Kate shrugged, \"Okay; I still think it's weird that you're going, but have fun. I'll talk to you soon.\" She walked off, and Holden spotted Julia at her locker a few feet away. He strode over to the girl, one that he was sure many of the football players considered sleeping with. \"Hey, Julia, I was just wondering if you had any plans tonight.\" She turned to him, granting him a smile that immediately lifted his mood. \"No; why do you ask?\" \"I was wondering if you would want to come to the football game with me. I've never been and Kate has to work, so I was looking for someone to join me.\" Julia shrugged, closing her locker as she pushed one final book into her oversized purse. \"Yeah, sure; I've never been before either.\" Holden smiled. \"Alright, good; I'll see you there at seven?\" She nodded, and they walked toward their cars together. P.S. Julia is Jennifer Garner in the movie. I know there were a lot of characters in the film, so it's hard to keep them all straight.[Chapter 4] Decode By: KellyCRocker59 Chapter Four Man, this is a long chapter! I wasn't really sure how to fit everything necessary into a flowing plot, so I hope I got everything right! Here is a character/actor list at the bottom if you've forgotten any of the characters from the movie (there were a TON of them). Jennifer Garner - Julia Ashton Kutcher - Reed Jamie Foxx - Kelvin Jessica Biel - Kara Jessica Alba - Morley Anway, thanks for all of your reviews, and I hope this chapter lives up to what you were hoping :) Holden was beginning to have second thoughts as he pulled into the parking lot of the school, finding no empty spots with which to park his vehicle. Julia drove a bright red sports car, one that he couldn't spot amongst the field of cars before him, so he settled on parking haphazardly in the ditch. He cut the engine and grabbed his phone from the cup holder, calling her. One ring and she answered with a bright hello. \"Hey, are you here?\" He asked, eyeing the red Pep Club shirt that was pulled nicely against the muscle on his chest and stomach. He looked pretty good if he was to allow himself an arrogant thought, thanking God that he had gone to the gym between school and the game. \"I'm pulling in right now; good lord, where did you park at, there are no free spots!\" \"I'm over in the ditch, my car probably looks like it's gonna tip over.\" Holden replied. \"Oh, I see you! I'm park on the other side of the street.\" She replied, hanging up. Sure enough, Holden saw her car pass him and the pull into the ditch across the street, beside the vacant park. Everyone in town was at this football game. Julia got out of her car and looked beautiful, dressed simply in her own Pep Club shirt, but was accented by a silver necklace, a light pair of jeans and earrings with small diamonds at their center. \"We better get in there and get a good seat!\" She said loudly from across the road, hurrying to cross over and wearing her usual smile. The girl was infectiously happy, something Holden was grateful for. \"Well then let's go.\" Holden said, returning the smile and leading the way toward the gate. The stadium was packed, all except for the student section, where there were still several open places. Teenagers were doused in body paint, every one of them garbed in a Pep Club shirt, whether in its original condition or not. Holden guided Julia toward a spot open for two on the second row, where they stood. The game had just begun, and Holden had no idea what was going on. \"Do you watch any football?\" He asked. \"No, I never have before,\" Julia replied, turning to him with a smile, \"I just thought it might be fun to go to a game.\" Holden grinned, feeling connected by their shared sentiment, despite his deeper intentions. Regardless, he kept an eye out for Sean, whose number he couldn't make out throughout the line of teenagers in front of them, leaning on the railing, obscuring his view. Half of first quarter passed, and Holden was becoming a bit frustrated by the inability to spot the entire purpose for his attendance. Then, out of nowhere, one of the girls on the front row darted down the stairs beside them and practically buried her face in the trash can, heaving up some concession stand ilk that Holden refused to touch. A boy was beside her in seconds, tearing himself away from the game the way a good boyfriend would. After a few moments, both teens left, and Holden nudged Julia, but she was already stepping over the seats in front of them and into the two newly available spots. Holden smiled and hurried to stand beside her, briefly wondering why he had not cultivated this friendship more thoroughly in the past. \"Well look at this; I would never expect to see you two at an actual football game!\" Holden turned to find Kelvin Moore standing behind them, camera in hand. \"Let me get a picture of you two for the yearbook!\" Holden sighed, turning to Julia, who shrugged. \"Why not?\" She replied, and weaved her arm around Holden's shoulders, Holden doing the same and following it with as bright a smile as he could manage considering that much of the student section was now watching them. Kelvin flashed the picture, then another, and let his camera settle on its band around his neck. \"It's nice to see you two supporting the team! I might bring Kara by to get an interview for the paper; people are going to want answers for why you guys are here.\" He replied, and then he was darting off, no doubt to take some more pictures. Holden sighed; Kara was the editor-in-chief of the school paper, and while he was friends with her, he would rather that be put on display on the front page. It was the only paper any kid in the town actually read. \"Why are you two here?\" Holden turned to the voice beside him, realizing it was Reed Bennett. They had shared several classes together, and Reed had always been friendly; he was one of the most popular guys in school, a non-sports player who made up for it socially but being president of Earth Club, Key Club, and National Honor Society. \"We both thought we should go to football game before the end of our senior year.\" Julia replied for him, and Holden nodded in agreement. The answer seemed to be sufficient for Reed, who nodded, smiled, and turned back to the game. \"Just let me know if you two need any help figuring out what's going on.\" He answered, not taking his eyes from the game but smiling in a way that let Holden know that he was joking. Holden turned to the game, finally able to actually watch it without interruption, only to find half-time beginning. He had gone the entire first half of the game without even getting to see Sean. Regardless, this allowed him a chance to talk to people he actually enjoyed talking to. \"So, are you guys…you know?\" Reed asked, turning to them and resting his elbow on the railing casually. \"What? No, just friends.\" Holden replied, not realizing that this was what many of the students might be drawing from their appearance here together. \"Oh, alright.\" Reed replied, shrugging it off. \"Holden, Julia, do have a moment?\" Sure enough, there was Kara as Holden turned to see who had been speaking. She held a large notepad against her, pen in hand. \"I wanted to speak to you two about what made you two want to show up tonight.\" \"It's pretty simple Kara; they've never been to a game before and they decided to be spontaneous and show up. And no, they aren't dating.\" Reed said roughly to the girl. \"Oh…\" Kara replied softly, a bit taken aback by the boy's tone and knowing not to get in the bad graces of someone of Reed's status. \"Alright, I guess I'll just see you guys later.\" \"See you, Kara.\" Julia replied as she walked away, seeming to attempt a bit of friendliness in her tone. \"Thanks for that.\" Holden replied to Reed, who was eyeing the marching band on the field absentmindedly. \"No problem; it drives me crazy when the people from the newspaper try and get a story from people who obviously don't want their words twisted around. If they want to make something out of nothing, they should start with the burnouts; at least they deserve to have their social lives destroyed.\" \"That's a bit dramatic, don't you think?\" Julia questioned, looking at Reed with a raised eyebrow. \"The school newspaper is nothing but a gossip rag, and the popular kids squeeze every bit of drama out of it that they can. Trust me, a few twisted words in there about you two and Julia, you would be carrying Holden's twins by Monday.\" Holden snorted despite himself, and then caught a glance at the keys that Reed twirled on his finger. \"Do you go to Grizzly gym?\" Holden asked. Reed nodded, turning to him. \"Yeah, every Monday, Wednesday and Friday; do you go too?\" \"Yeah; Sundays, Tuesdays and either Thursday or Friday.\" \"Wow, I'm surprised we haven't seen each other there before. We should go together sometime.\" Holden nodded. \"Yeah, sounds good.\" Then, the game was starting up again. Holden checked the score board; they were ahead by eight points. He spotted Sean, walking out onto the field, that '42' working as a GPS for Holden. Sean turned, one of the coaches seeming to be speaking to him, and when he nodded he absentmindedly looked up toward the student section. Then, he just stared, and Holden knew he was looking at him. Holden smiled as big as he could, and then Sean turned, hurrying toward his position on the field. Football was pretty brutal; Sean was thrown around quite a bit, especially when he had the ball. Reed explained patterns and the purpose of each player's position. Holden bit his lip as the opposing team tied the score and then scored an extra touchdown moving into fourth quarter, now winning. By mid-fourth quarter, Holden was cheering wildly with everyone else in the stadium, finally understanding what was happening on the field. The home team scored, tying the game with a few minutes left. Then, in the last minute, the home team scored, leading them to a victory amongst overwhelming cheers. It was several minutes before people began to disperse, many remaining to talk. Julia said that she was going to head home; she had gotten a text from her mom that she needed the car, because Julia's mother had apparently wrecked her's. Holden said goodbye to both her and Reed, who said that he would text him about going to the gym. Then, Holden checked his phone. He had a new message from Sean (they had exchanged numbers before leaving the janitor's closet Monday), telling himself to meet him at his truck behind the locker room. He explained that everyone would be going to the other parking lot; Morley Clarkson was having a party at her house, and all the players were carpooling. So Holden walked over to the parking lot, which was deserted of all people. He made his way to Sean's truck, leaning against it and looking for the boy. It was incredibly dark, no street lights close by to illuminate other figures. He could feel his heart pumping madly in his chest, his hands buried in the pockets of his khaki shorts as he searched for Sean despite his inability to see further then a few inches. He nearly passed out when he felt a firm hand on his shoulder, but then he heard a voice in his ear. \"I didn't think you liked football.\" Sean whispered, and Holden turned to find the larger boy dressed in a tight white shirt and red shorts, sweaty to a point that Holden had never before been. \"Well, I didn't exactly know what was going on most of the time, but Reed helped me figure it out.\" \"You aren't ditching me for someone else already are you?\" Sean asked, turning so that Holden was pressed against the side of Sean's truck, the football player's hands resting on either side of the vehicle, trapping Holden as he drew nearer. \"You obviously haven't looked in a mirror in a while…\" Holden replied, reaching out boldly and running his fingers along Sean's jaw, \"…or else you would have shaved by now.\" Sean laughed, and it warmed Holden's chest with its deep force. Then, Holden felt their noses touching, and Sean's breath was shared with him. The other boy smelled, but it was a strong musky scent that flooded Holden's brain and threatened to devour his senses. \"You look hot in red.\" Sean stated, and Holden could feel the smile on his lips. Holden's hands went to Sean's back, running up the shirt and along his back, unable to gain a hold of reality as he pulled Sean the final breadth forward, pressing their lips together. Sean's hands were gripping Holden's face immediately, then his waist and pressing their bodies as close as possible. Holden could barely stand, knowing he would collapse if he wasn't pressed so firmly between the boy and his vehicle. Then, there was a flash of light and they were torn apart immediately, Sean seeming to realize what was occurring before Holden did. Holden turned, and found Kelvin standing there with his camera up, a look split between joy and confusion spread across his face. \"Sorry guys, but when I give this to Kara, it's gonna be on the cover of the newspaper and I'm finally going to get the sports journalist spot that I've been trying to get since I was a freshman!\" \"Give me that camera.\" Holden turned to the voice just as his brain went numb from the situation. Reed tore the camera from around Kelvin's neck before the boy could object. After a few moments of pressing buttons, he handed back to Kelvin, who didn't dare try to stop him. \"There you go; the picture's gone, and if you breathe a word of this, I'll make sure you're high school life is dead and buried in less then twenty-four hours. Now get the hell out of here.\" Kelvin nodded, and then he wondered off, heading back to the game. Silence filled the space between the three boys, and then Reed spoke. \"My uncle's gay, and I have a lesbian cousin. Your people get so much crap and neither of you two deserves to be outed by the school paper.\" \"Thanks, Reed, you have no idea…\" Holden began. \"No, seriously, no big deal; you're a cool guy Holden. I'll text you about going to the gym sometime this week.\" Holden nodded, and then Reed was walking across the parking lot to his car. Holden turned to Sean, who was just looking absentmindedly forward. \"Sean…\" Holden whispered, not sure what to say, considering the gravity of the situation and what could have been the outcome. \"I need to get home; I'll talk to you tomorrow, Holden.\" Sean replied, turning to him and attempting to offer some sort of condoling expression but seeming unable to manage it. \"Are we still on for tomorrow?\" Holden asked desperately needing some sort of emotion to be expressed by the other boy. \"I'll…I'll talk to you tomorrow, Holden.\" Sean replied, getting in his truck. Holden began the walk back to his car as Sean drove out of the parking lot, the sensation of the other boy's fingers still warm against his skin.[Chapter 5] Decode By: KellyCRocker59 Chapter Five Man, sorry it took so long to update! I was planning on doing this early in the day, but time got away from me; I only had about forty minutes today that weren't occupied by stuff I had to get done! Anyway, I hope you enjoy this; I am still very pissed at Eric Dane's character after this week's Grey's Anatomy, so I tried not to let that carry over to this :) Holden awoke Saturday morning feeling a bit sick. He had been able to stifle his frustration with Sean by delving deep into a pint of Ben and Jerry's, which had been awaiting him at home. Now, he was feeling the effects, stomach turning a bit from the rush of sugar that it had received. He lay in bed for a long time, just thinking about the previous night. Even now, Sean's hands felt only momentarily gone from his body. He wasn't sure whether or not he should make the first move; recalling the expression upon Sean's face the previous night, he decided on waiting for the other boy. The day was spending in anxiety. Holden watched television, spent some time on Facebook, did his homework, returned to the television, and still was unsure of what to do about Sean. Finally, as Holden finished his dinner with his parents, he heard his phone ringing, set to the song that he had picked especially for the other boy. He rushed over to it, answering in a hurry as he stumbled over a chair. \"Hey.\" He said, winded. \"Hey; you okay? You sound kind of out of breath.\" Sean said from the other line. \"Yeah, yeah I'm fine; I should be asking you that.\" Holden replied, walking over to the laundry room and shutting the door, thankful for the machine's loud cycle. \"Look, I'm sorry I kind of freaked out last night; it just…well, I saw my whole life sort of flash before my eyes, you know?\" Holden nodded, but then verbally agreed when he realized Sean couldn't see him. \"We're just going to have to be a lot more careful from now on.\" \"Yeah, I know; I guess we can't be all over each other in public anymore, no matter how hidden we think we are.\" Holden replied, hopping up onto the dryer and taking a seat. \"I still want to do something tonight though.\" Sean added a bit hesitantly, and Holden was immediately hanging on his words. \"Yeah that sounds great! What time?\" Holden asked. \"I don't know; how about I pick you up at eight?\" Sean proposed. \"Sounds great, but do you know where I live?\" Holden asked, checking the clock on the wall, which read 6:45. \"I have a GPS in my truck, so I just need your address.\" After Holden told Sean the address, they hung up with a simple goodbye, Holden's heart beating just a bit quicker in his chest now as he headed back into the kitchen, where his parents were cleaning up. \"Man, son that must have been someone pretty important on the phone for you to leap over there like that.\" His dad said as he placed a dish on the drying rack. \"It was just a friend; is it okay if I go out tonight?\" He asked, turning to acknowledge his mom, standing over the sink. \"Yeah, that's fine honey; what time are you going to leave?\" \"Eight.\" He replied. \"Do we know this friend?\" His dad asked. \"No, just someone I started hanging out with this year. \"Oh; well I hope their not a bad influence. You better not be doing drugs.\" His mom said, turning toward him with a raised eyebrow. Holden smiled despite himself. \"You don't have anything to worry about, Mom.\" He dressed as quickly yet as diligently as he could, pulling on his favorite khaki shorts and a white shirt that hugged him in the best ways. It was 7:45 by the time he headed back stairs to wait on Sean, sitting down in the living room and looking out the window in anticipation. By 8:05, Sean's truck came driving up the hill toward Holden's house. Within seconds, Holden was on his feet, yanking his shoes on like he had just learned how to. \"Be home by one!\" His mom called from the family room, where his parents sat watching television. \"I will!\" Holden replied, pulling the door open and hurrying out, only to realize that it would be best if he could collect himself before seeing Sean. The boy in thought was sitting in his truck, which was pulled in front of the garage. Of course, Sean looked incredibly sexy, bright grin on his face as Holden rounded the side of the house and came into view. Just the way Sean looked at him made Holden's stomach turn, and as he climbed into the passenger's seat, he felt his tongue against the roof of his mouth, dry. \"Hey.\" Sean said, turning and granting him a smile from even nearer before putting his truck in reverse and pulling out of the driveway. \"Hey.\" Holden replied, not sure how else to respond as they began the drive away from his house. \"So…what are we going to do?\" Holden asked as they drove along, into the town near his house. \"I realized on the way over to your house that we don't really know anything about each other, so I figured we could just kind of sit and talk. I know this place where no one is going to interrupt us.\" Sean replied, keeping his eyes on the road. \"Sounds good.\" Holden replied a bit awkwardly, turning back toward the road, gaze having been upon the side of Sean's face. The place that Sean had been talking about was in fact a place where no one would find them. Past the town park, they drove down a narrow road and to a dead end, the road halting in front of a thick forest. Sean cut the engine, rolling the windows down a bit so that the cool air outside could circulate throughout the vehicle. \"Well, what are we gonna talk about?\" Holden asked as Sean unfastened his seat belt, turning in his seat so that they could face one another. Sean shrugged. \"I don't know; whatever you want to talk about. It's not like anyone is gonna hear us.\" Holden leaned back against the door frame, back of his head resting against the cool glass as he considered his words. \"Do any of the other football players like…you know, guys?\" Sean shrugged. \"It's not something we talk about. I mean, I'm tight with most of them, but we aren't like you and Kate; we don't really talk about what's going through our heads, unless it involves a vagina.\" \"All football players can't be like that can they?\" Holden questioned, attempting to think the better of the team. \"All guys think like that. At least all the straight ones.\" Sean replied, an almost grim smile threatening to draw his lips tight. \"I don't think so; I think there are some good straight guys out there.\" Holden replied. Sean shrugged again. \"I haven't met one, but I don't really hang out with any that might be.\" Silence ensued, and Holden felt the awkwardness sinking in. \"We aren't going to be one of those couples are we?\" Holden asked out of nowhere, desperate for conversation. \"What do you mean?\" Sean returned, eyes narrowing a bit in question. \"One that only has a physical relationship, that can't talk unless it's about how hot they both are.\" \"That's a bit arrogant, don't you think?\" Sean asked, grinning. \"Whatever, you know what I mean.\" Holden replied, unable to bite back a bit of a smile in return. \"Yeah, I get it; no, I don't think that's going to be us. I mean, we aren't even really a couple yet, are we?\" It was Holden's turn to shrug. \"I don't know; I mean, I've never had a boyfriend, so I'm not sure how this works.\" \"Well I'm sure it's just like a boy and girl. Right now, we're in the 'talking' phase.\" Sean replied. \"Okay; then let's talk.\" Holden said. \"You said that earlier, but I don't see you coming up with much.\" Sean quipped, the smile still spread across his face. \"Fine, I'll ask you a bunch of questions, and you answer.\" Holden replied. \"Alright, let's go.\" Sean answered, leaning more fully against the window as Holden leaned forward. \"Favorite movie?\" \"Fight Club.\" \"Favorite T.V. show?\" \"Supernatural.\" \"Favorite book?\" \"Harry Potter.\" \"Seriously? I am a crazy Harry Potter nerd!\" Holden exclaimed, leaning in even closer, unable to control his excitement. \"Which one's your favorite?\" \"Goblet of Fire.\" Sean replied, smiling at the ecstatic boy in front of him. \"Me too!\" Holden exclaimed, leaning even closer still, until he toppled over, landing in Sean's lap with a grunt. Sean's hands came to grip Holden's forearms, and Holden tilted his head up from where it was buried in Sean's chest, looking up into the football player's intense eyes. Sean's hands moved up to Holden's face, callused fingers burning their sensation into his skin. Sean was kissing him before he even realized it was coming, the larger boy leaning down, moving his body so that he could reach Holden's lips. Holden kicked himself up, hands going around Sean's neck so that their lips met more precisely, neither of them able to get enough of the other as they pressed themselves so firmly against one another. Finally, Holden pulled away, breathing heavy. \"If I had realized Harry Potter turned you on so much, I would have mentioned it sooner.\" Sean replied, smiling with a chuckle. \"No, no; no making out! We need to talk.\" Holden replied, pulling away and attempting to get into a sitting position. \"Hey, just because we're talking doesn't mean we can't be comfortable.\" Sean said, reaching out for Holden's hands to pull him forward. \"No; if I touch you, I'm just going to want to make out with you, Sean Jackson, and then I'm going to want to do many other things as well.\" Sean sighed, leaning back in mock frustration as Holden got comfortable at the opposite side of the truck before continuing with the questions. \"Favorite singer?\" \"John Mayer.\" \"Favorite band?\" \"Isn't that kind of the same thing?\" \"No, completely different.\" \"Ugh, fine; Coldplay.\" \"Favorite food?\" \"Macaroni and cheese.\" \"Favorite animal?\" \"I don't know, I haven't really thought about that.\" \"Come on, there's got to be one animal you like more then any others.\" \"I don't know, I guess a rhinoceros.\" \"Really?\" \"Yeah, why?\"\"I don't know, just curious.\" A dozen more questions, and then Holden was finally done, mentally evaluating all of the responses he had gotten. \"So now it's my turn.\" Sean replied. \"Yeah, I guess so.\" Holden said, a bit nervous now. \"But you can't judge.\" \"Alright, but you have to lean against me.\" Sean replied, reaching out a hand in offering. Holden sighed. \"You really test my self-control, Sean Jackson.\" \"If we have sex, you're not gonna call me that, are you?\" He asked, as Holden took his hand and allowed himself to be nestled deeply against the other boy's chest. \"Of course not.\" He replied with a deep blush, unseen by the football player. \"Alright; favorite movie?\" \"This is so embarrassing.\" \"Yeah right, if you can't tell me, who can you tell?\" \"Kate.\" \"Well why don't you just go down on her, then?\" \"Fine, Mean Girls.\" \"What?\" \"That's my favorite movie.\" \"Oh…alright, favorite T.V. show?\" \"Seriously? That question sucks.\" \"Hey, you asked me the same thing.\" \"Gossip Girl.\" \"That's no big deal; favorite singer?\" \"Kelly Clarkson.\" \"Favorite band?\" \"The Veronicas.\" \"Who?\" \"They're Australian.\" \"Oh…alright. Favorite food?\" \"Ice cream; I alternate between peanut butter and cake batter.\" \"Man that sounds good right now.\" \"I know, right?\" Sean continued pouring questions upon Holden, and when he finally stopped, Holden's fingers had begun to rub gentle circles upon Sean's arm, the hair parting for them. \"What time is it?\" Holden asked. \"I don't know; what, are you ready to go home already?\" Sean asked. \"No; I actually don't know if I ever want to leave.\" \"Good; me either.\" \"What did you tell you're parents?\" \"I told them we were going out. They assumed I meant as friends. You?\" \"I told them I was gonna hang out with a new friend. They told me not to do drugs.\" \"Sounds like good parenting.\" \"Hey, I love them, don't be mean.\" \"I was being serious.\" \"Oh…\" Holden whispered as Sean buried his face in his hair. \"Do you like girls?\" Holden asked, verbalizing the first question that had entered his mind. \"No, I don't think I ever have. I dated them because it was what was expected, but it never really felt right. I would ask you, but I think I know the answer.\" \"What, do I just ooze gayness?\" \"No; I just know you've never dated a girl, and it would be really easy for you to. You're pretty frigging hot.\" \"Thanks.\" Holden replied, cheeks flaring up again. They sat there like that for a long time, neither one of them speaking, but this time sitting in comfortable silence. \"I really want to kiss you again.\" Holden said. \"Sounds good to me.\" Sean replied, and allowed Holden to turn in his arms, pressing their lips gently together, setting fire to both their senses as Sean's hands found their way against Holden's hips.[Chapter 6] Decode By: KellyCRocker59 Chapter Six Sorry this chapter is sort of an in-between one due to an incredibly hectic week; I'll attempt to promise that the next one is more detailed and just all around better at flowing the plot! Regardless, thanks for sticking in there, and I hope that this chapter is still kind of good :) Holden wondered why Sean wouldn't look at him. Every day at lunch, he always looked at him, but today he wasn't. Sean was speaking to some other jocks about who knows what, which is what he usually did, but always with an eye turned toward Holden. Of course, it was shaping up to be an odd day; everywhere he walked, people seemed to look at him, some just glancing for a bit too long while others outright stared. Kate seemed perplexed as to why this was happening, so Holden played it off that he was having an especially good clothing day. However, this was just strange. Lunch came and passed and Sean didn't look at him once; it wasn't until the bell rang that Sean texted Holden to meet him in the janitor's closet during study hall. \"What the hell is going on?\" Holden asked as Sean's dark figure joined him in the cramped space. \"People are talking. I've heard from several people that they saw you making out with a guy after the football game. I questioned Kelvin about it during 4th hour but he swore that he didn't tell anybody, and knowing him, he was telling the truth. I don't know how it happened, but for right now we can't be seen together.\" Holden immediately felt dizzy, and Sean's hands briefly dusted against his arms before pulling away, the larger boy seeming to think better of the endearment. He didn't know what to think or do; the rumors had been going around for years that he was gay, but this was completely different. This was proof. \"What are you thinking?\" Sean asked. \"I…don't know.\" Holden replied. \"I'm gonna go; if you need anything, text me.\" Then he was gone, disappearing back into the hallway. The week passed in a blur of introspection and fear; Holden was just waiting for someone to say something. He almost wished they would, just so he could defend himself. It made him even madder that no one seemed to even doubt that he had done it; he had thought that he was at least kind of popular, but it seemed as though his reputation meant nothing. Finally, Friday came like a welcoming friend, promising a whole two days without any staring or talking behind his back. It was when he was walking out to his car that sometimes besides Kate spoke. \"Hey, Holden.\" He turned, and found Reed standing, waiting. \"Hey, Reed, sorry for not getting back to you about the gym; it's kind of been a crazy week.\" \"Yeah I understand; I mean, I was the one who started it.\" \"Started what?\" Holden asked, feeling his stomach turn, knowing what Reed was talking about but too stunned to believe it. \"I told everyone that you were making out with some guy after the game.\" \"W-Why…\" He choked on his own words, \"why would you do that?\" Reed shrugged. \"I don't know; I like you, but Sean rubs me the wrong way. You need to get with someone better then him. I figured the best way to do that would be to make you into his personal plague.\" \"But…\" \"But what, Holden? I'm the one in control here. Sean's a douche; do you know how many girls he's slept with? Do you even understand that you can do better? I'm just looking out for you, man.\" Holden felt twisted into a broken reality; was Reed his friend? If he was, then he certainly wasn't Sean's. \"I just thought I'd tell you; figured you would want to know that no one's out to get you. I'll clear it up on Monday that it was someone else that I saw, and I'll tell everyone I saw you on a date with a really hot girl over the weekend. Everyone will believe me, and Sean will be too freaked out to be with you. He'll go back to dating those slutty girls and you can move on to guys worth your time.\" This wasn't a proposal; this was a decision. Reed was telling him how he was going to live. Holden just sort of nodded, not sure if he even managed doing that much. Reed gave him a smile, one that was both taunting and welcoming at once. Holden wondered if this was even him, and if this was his life playing out before him. He wanted to punch Reed, wanted to punch him until his own fists bled. And he wanted to go to Sean and tell him everything was okay, and that they could be together. But could they really? Now, with the rumors circulating, the damage was done. Would Sean take him back? One week; they had been given one week of happiness, and now it was all over. Holden awoke to find his mom knocking on his door, questioning his current state and whether or not he needed to go to the doctor. Holden managed a fairly convincing yes, and she left. Rolling over, he checked his phone and realized that it was nearly noon. He rarely slept until eight on the weekends, much less twelve. He sat up, rubbing his eyes and recalling the half gallon of ice cream he had devoured the night before while burying himself in his sheets with several hours of scripted dramas that had occupied his DVR. The contents of his sin were left in his trash can, and he felt his stomach roll a bit in disagreement. He crawled out of bed regardless, managing to pull on a plain t-shirt and shorts, realizing that he would need to spend at least an hour in the gym today to remove a bit of the fat that had undoubtedly made its way along his abs. Holden spent the entire day exercising or driving while screaming to the lyrics of a heartbroken Christina Aguilera. During the night hours, he retreated back to his bed with his television, falling asleep a mere twelve hours after he had awoken. He didn't think of Sean, or at least tried not to fully conjure thoughts of the boy within his mind, instead settling on trying to evade the more blunt imagery his brain seemed so content upon forcing him to endure. Sunday was even worse; with church being the only activity all day, Holden was left to occupy his time with even more television (the DVR hours seemed endless) as well as a few romantic comedies that were just unfair, ripping bits of his heart apart with each final scene. Then, his phone was blasting the familiar song that he had set for his mom. His room was upstairs, so over the years they had both found it more convenient for her to call him rather then yelling up the stairs. \"There's a large truck in the driveway; I think it's that new friend of yours.\" She said. Holden didn't reply, throwing his door open and hurrying down the stairs, nearly falling as he reached the hardwood at the bottom. \"Are you going somewhere?\" His mom asked curiously, eyeing his garb of sweats and a plain t-shirt. \"Yeah, I think so; I'll be back soon.\" Holden replied, turning to her and flashing a smile while still attempting to mask the excitement of just knowing Sean was waiting in the driveway. He tried not to slam the door on his way out, and then full-out sprinted around the corner to the driveway until he came to a complete stop. That wasn't Sean's truck, and it wasn't Sean in the driver's seat. Harrison Copeland, Sean's best friend, was there, seated with a twisted sort of expression on his face, seeming torn between whether or not he should be there at that moment. Then, he spotted Holden and motioned for him to approach, not even bothering to cut the engine. Holden obliged, walking over to the driver's side window, which was rolled down. \"We need to talk,\" He said, \"about Sean.\" Holden nodded without really thinking, and was walking over to the passenger's side before his mind was fully committed to his actions. He took a seat, and Harrison put the vehicle in reverse, pulling out of Holden's driveway. P.S. Harrison is Patrick Dempsey in the film.[Chapter 7] Decode By: KellyCRocker59 Chapter Seven This chapter is really dialogue heavy, so I hope it still flows well. Trust me, there won't be so much relationship drama in the future, so I'm sorry if that's kind of off-putting right now. Anyway, I hope you like this chapter, and please let me know what you think :) They parked on the side of the road, a back road that didn't look as though it saw more then one or two vehicles a day tread down its path. Harrison hadn't spoken for the entire trip, which didn't really surprise Holden. Harrison didn't play sports, instead opting for clubs and such, known mostly as the resident man-whore of the high school; if there was a pretty girl, it was almost certain that he had slept with her. Holden rarely saw him, and when he did it always seemed a bit uncomfortable for him. \"Look, I've talked to maybe once or twice, Holden, so I don't really know what's going through your head…\" Harrison turned more in his seat, facing the other boy, \"but Sean is kind of going crazy. He's always on edge; most people might not see it, but I know him front and backwards, and you're on his mind all the time. It's kind of disgusting, and really pathetic.\" \"Well he's the one that doesn't want to talk to me; I've been going crazy too.\" Holden replied, a bit perturbed that Sean had told someone about them when he had believed they had a firm agreement against it. \"He wants to, trust me. He just doesn't know how to. I'm actually really surprised that he's been as open with you as he seems to be. Sean is usually really closed off; I suppose that it's all or nothing with him, and he was the former with you.\" \"Why doesn't he just text me or something then? I've been miserable for the past week; the least he can do is put my mind at ease.\" Holden was leaning against the side door now, finding it difficult to look directly into Harrison's deep gaze and settling instead upon the dashboard. \"He can't ; it's just the way he is, Holden. You need to make the first move, or else both of you are just going to go on being all pathetic and lonely.\" \"So what, just call him? What if he doesn't want to talk to me?\" \"Don't be a girl; just call him, it's no big deal. He wants to talk to you, trust me.\" Holden sighed, readjusting himself in his seat. \"Did you know about Sean…\" \"I've known Sean was into guys for a couple years,\" Harrison said, cutting him off, \"I come from a pretty liberal family, so I didn't think it was any big deal. Still, I don't want to see him getting hurt; he's my boy. So don't go breaking his heart.\" It was then that Harrison started the engine, and they were returning to Holden's house. He scrolled down to Sean's number nervously, becoming unsure as his finger guided the list of contacts toward the other boy's name. Then, he was there, and with a quick breath he pressed 'call'. The dial tone sounded once, then twice, and then… \"Hello?\" Holden coughed suddenly, choked by the catching of his breath, unable to reply. \"Hello?\" Sean asked again, more questioning now. \"H-Hey.\" Holden managed out, coughing more quietly a few more times before getting his lungs under control. \"Hey; what's up?\" This was what Holden had called for? \"I think we have more important things to talk about then what's up.\" Holden replied, lying down on his bed, attempting to get comfortable but unable to with the atmosphere of the conversation so heavy. \"It's just a thing to say; I know we need to talk, I just…don't know what to say.\" \"How about you wanna try having a relationship?\" Holden asked. \"Yeah, I guess that's a start. I don't know, though; I'm worried about people finding out.\" Sean's voice sounded more cautious then Holden had ever heard him. \"Well you seemed pretty eager to tell Harrison about us.\" Holden replied before he could extract the tang of bitterness from his voice. \"He talked to you? What'd he say?\" Sean was anxious now, and Holden kind of liked having a bit of control over the other boy. \"Just that you've been a mess without me.\" This wasn't completely untrue. There was a long pause on the other end of the line. \"He's won't shut up about how pathetic I'm being.\" \"Well don't feel too bad; I'm kind of in the same boat.\" Holden replied. \"So what…we're just supposed to be together or something? We haven't even been broken up for a week, and we're both a mess.\" \"Well why should we have to be apart? I mean, I know we were only really together for a week, but I feel like we just connected.\" Holden replied. \"Yeah, same here; but honestly, if this gets back to my parents…\" \"Mine would probably kick me out, so I feel the same way. We're just going to have to be really careful.\" Sean didn't speak for a while, and Holden wondered if he had lost the connection. \"How about we just go for a drive?\" He suggested. \"That sounds really good, actually.\" Holden replied, smiling to himself. \"I'll be at your house in a bit.\" Sean said, and then hung up before Holden could even get in a response. Sure enough, Holden had barely managed to pull on proper clothes before Sean was driving up to his house. A quick goodbye to his parents, both of them fairly well attached to the television, gained him a quick escape. He rounded the side of his house, this time sure of whom would be there, and it was as he expected; Sean, looking incredibly sexy with a smile plastered to his face. Holden pulled the passenger's door opened and climbed in, pulling his seat belt on. However, Sean didn't move. Holden looked over at him in curiosity, and found the other boy staring. \"I'm sorry; I should have stuck by you.\" He said, verbally what his more solemn expression now showed. \"No, don't; I don't know if I could have if I was in your position.\" Holden replied, shaking his head. \"Yes you would have. You say you care, Holden, but you don't; you're braver then I am.\" Holden sighed, \"Can we just drive? All of this sad talk is getting me down.\" \"Yeah.\" Sean replied, and he pulled out of Holden's driveway and toward the road before them. The radio hummed quietly, and Holden was unsure what to say now as Sean drove. \"We really need to start thinking of new places to hang out. Your truck hasn't always yielded the best results.\" He finally managed, and Sean chuckled. \"Yeah, we should; I guess we could hang out at my house, if you wanted. My parents wouldn't think anything of us. I just don't want anyone at school spreading anything.\" \"It was Reed, just so you know. He's the one that started the rumor.\" Holden added, feeling a tremor of anger sweep through him before dissipating. \"Why the hell would he do that? He had our backs at the last game.\" Sean questioned, brow furrowing. \"He said he doesn't think you're good for me, said he's just looking out for me and that I can do better. I don't see it, but whatever.\" \"It's not any of his damn business whether or not we're together.\" Sean mumbled, but Holden could tell there were thoughts being processed beyond what he was verbalizing. \"What are you thinking?\" He asked, attempting to obtain the workings of the other boy's mind. \"Just that I'd beat the shit out of him if he didn't have this over us.\" Sean replied, and Holden wondered if profanity was just his way of expressing his rage without getting violent. \"Calm down; he didn't really mean anything by it.\" Holden said, defending Reed despite himself. \"Whatever, Holden; if this gets out, don't expect me to go easy on him.\" Holden sighed, and silence ensued. \"I'm hungry; you hungry?\" Sean asked. \"Yeah, actually I am.\" Holden said, feeling a gnawing in his stomach. Sean drove into the town nearest Holden's house, away from the school and that town. People rarely commuted between the two, so it was unlikely for them to see anyone they knew. They stopped at a Wendy's, this one seeming to be a more prestigious restaurant from the chain. Sean ordered a burger and fries, and when Holden ordered a burger and chili, he realized he didn't have any money on him. However, Sean stepped in front of him and paid the bill, handing the cashier a twenty. \"You didn't need to do that.\" Holden mumbled as Sean grabbed their tray and headed for a table. \"Well call me old-fashioned; I'm not going to make you pay when you're my date.\" Sean replied nonchalantly. \"Oh, so this is a date?\" Holden asked as they sat down. Sean shrugged. \"I guess so.\" The larger boy unwrapped his burger and began to take a bite, but then he noticed Holden bowing his head, eyes closed. He waited for him to look up before speaking. \"What was that?\" \"I was just praying; it's kind of a habit I have before every meal.\" Holden answered, trying not to be self-conscious about his faith. Sean nodded, easing Holden's nerves of his behavior. \"That's cool.\" They ate in silence, Holden too preoccupied with the process of eating to speak. Then, when he moved on to his chili, Sean spoke up. \"Is that stuff good? I don't think I've ever had chili at a fast food place.\" Holden nodded, \"Yeah, it's amazing; you wanna try it?\" Sean shrugged, and Holden passed his the plastic cup and spoon. The football player took it, and scooped up some of the meat and beans from the liquid onto the spoon. He took it in one bite, and then sputtered painfully. Holden bit back a laugh at the incredulous expression upon the other boy's face, looking as though he had been fed lard. \"Man, that's frigging hot!\" Sean gasped, \"Not to mention it tastes like shit!\" \"Watch your mouth.\" Holden corrected, and Sean eyed him in a curious manner, seeming to both take note of his offensive remark as well as Holden's expression. Then, Holden realized that there was residue of the food on Sean's upper lip, caught in the hair that he let grow there. \"You have something on your face.\" Holden said and absentmindedly leaned forward, thumb moving over Sean's face to wipe it away. Sean's eyes caught his, and Holden immediately realized what he was doing, closed hand against the other boy's face, thumb rubbing his skin. Sean's eyes held that intensity that Holden had seen before, the first time they had driven in Sean's truck and again after the football game. Before he could move away, Sean was leaning forward and kissed him squarely on the mouth, a fast yet firm kiss that made Holden's heart constrict. Sean was back in his seat before Holden even realized they had parted, and Holden leaned back against his as well. Sean was smiling now, a big grin that made Holden's heart beat back to life. \"You look like you just got slapped in the face?\" Sean explained. \"I just…wasn't expecting that.\" Holden replied, grabbing his cup of chili from Sean's side of the table as Sean stuffed a few fries into his mouth. \"What, you didn't like it?\" He questioned. \"No, actually; it was kind of amazing.\" Sean chuckled, and Holden wondered if they could just stay here forever, in a fairly well deserted Wendy's where no one knew them, where they were free from the weight of the opinions and judgments of everyone they knew. He knew they couldn't, but it was a blissful thought nonetheless, as Sean's knees adjusted comfortably against his beneath the table.[Chapter 8] Decode By: KellyCRocker59 Chapter Eight This is a bit of a segway chapter, but I hope it's enjoyed nonetheless. Please let me know how I'm doing, or if you have any suggestions on plot development that might not be crossing my mind :) Over the weeks, Holden began to uncover new details about Sean Jackson, little features, both inward and outward, that made him drawn even closer to the other boy. He noticed that when they were in a conversation, Sean always looked directly in his eyes, or allowed his eyes to wonder along Holden's face, seeming to capture every inch of it within the length of even a brief conversation. It was always when Holden was speaking that Sean would just reach out like a curious child and brush his thumb along his jaw, seeming fascinated when Holden didn't shave a day, or across the side of his lip, catching a bit of chap stick against the callused skin and rubbing it between two fingers until it dissolved. Sean didn't seem to grasp the concept of boundaries, really. He didn't often share his feelings, instead content to display them physically. The aforementioned touches were just the part of the iceberg that Holden could see, the ten percent that anyone could recognize and be intrigued by prior to seeing the ninety percent engulfed in mystery. But Sean's actions didn't make him cold, though; they were gestures that made Holden's stomach turn at first, and eventually just warmed his cheeks a bit. The way Sean always adjusted the temperature in his truck every time Holden showed the most minuscule trait of discomfort. It was the way Sean touched him when they made out in the dark of the night, hands careful yet prying, knowing that there was a line by not afraid to dance along it. Sean Jackson didn't mind kissing Holden in public, either. If they were somewhere that no one knew them, he would lean down at will, occasionally interrupting a train of thought that the other boy was carrying. It was rude, and Holden would let him know that, but it was always from lips curved upward, cheeks tinted. Sean was arrogant, too, which was probably why he didn't mind displaying such affection amongst strangers. He realized how incredibly sexy he was, that every girl who saw him more then likely wanted to see him with his shirt off, and every boy either got off at night to the thought him on top of them or prayed to God that they could look similar. It might have been annoying, if it weren't for the fact that Sean thought Holden was even hotter, and would take every chance he had to crush the dreams of said girls and gay boys by letting them know he in fact was taken. Reed never found out that they were back together; Holden and Sean were much more careful following the evening at Wendy's, being sure to never kiss anywhere near the school unless it was from the safety of one of their vehicles, and even then the kisses were fleeting. Holden went to the gym with Reed fairly often; he was glad to have someone who he could talk to as well as being grateful for saving some gasoline. Reed was actually a nice guy, someone who Holden needed to talk about guy problems, situations Kate didn't always fully grasp. Speaking of Kate, Holden thought she might be catching onto his secret. She had been his best friend since the start of high school, after all, and he really was surprised that he had kept the secret as long as he had. He was just finding it difficult to pinpoint a time that would be best for telling her. Her curious glances when he made excuses for not returning her texts for prolonged periods of time, paired with her shaking leniency for his suddenly cramped schedule meant that the time frame was narrowing with the days. So here he was, fairly well falling in love with Sean, and he had to keep it all to himself. Well, at least for the next few minutes, considering that he was currently propped on Kate's bed, awaiting his best friend to return from the kitchen downstairs with hot chocolate. The weather had chilled quite early this year, homecoming not even having passed yet. He looked around at the pictures scattered along the walls and furniture in her room, an entire shelf dedicated to their silly misadventures, Holden looking at once more young and naïve when captured on camera. She padded along the carpet just as he began to analyze a specific image of them leaning over two mounding bowls of ice cream with bright smiles on their faces, cups of steaming liquid gripped by the handles promising warmth that the heating system couldn't provide. \"I remember that picture; what was that, freshman year?\" Kate asked, handing him a mug and taking a seat in a large lounge chair across the room from her bed. \"Yeah, I think so; we look so bright and happy there.\" \"I kind of miss those days; I wish I could be that carefree again sometimes.\" She sipped her hot chocolate, and Holden glanced toward her, not yet drinking his, too preoccupied with how he was going to tell her this crucial part of his life. Sean had already granted his consent (although it wouldn't have stopped Holden if he hadn't, considering that Harrison had been told), so there was really nothing stopping him but fear of the response he might earn. \"I need to tell you something.\" Holden blurted out without thinking, mentally kicking himself as he did. Kate's interest was perked, the young woman setting her cup on the table beside the chair before focusing her attention on the boy in front of her. \"Yeah?\" She asked, and Holden was a bit more encouraged by her calmly prodding response. \"Well, I've kind of been…well, there's some stuff you don't know about me.\" Holden replied, averting her gaze now as he felt the second thoughts closing in upon him. \"Well obviously it can't be so bad. You already got the big secret out the way a few years ago.\" She said, and he could feel her smiling soothingly toward him. \"I…well, I've kind of been seeing someone.\" Holden said, and there was no going back now. He adjusted on the bed, having trouble holding the mug while he pulled his legs up to his chest. \"Really? That's great, Holden!\" Kate said happily. \"Is he someone I know?\" \"Yeah, kind of.\" He replied, unable to resist a slight smile as she grew excited for him. \"Well, who? Surely a boy like you was able to land a pretty good catch.\" She was leaning up in her seat now, slight frame threatening to fall forward onto the carpet. Holden couldn't hold it in any longer. \"Sean.\" \"Sean….\" \"Sean Jackson?\" \"Sean Jackson?\" \"Yeah, Sean Jackson.\" \"Like, football-playing, facial hair-sporting, arrogant smile-wearing Sean Jackson?\" \"Yeah, that one.\" Holden wondered now how bright of an idea this had been. He looked up into Kate's eyes with caution, and some an indecipherable response splayed across her expression. \"He's gay?\" She asked. What type of follow-up was that? \"Yeah, yeah he is.\" \"You've been in love with him since we were freshman!\" She said, and a bit of joy seemed to flit past her eyes. \"Yeah, yeah, I kind of have.\" \"I always thought he was a major man-whore.\" She said, looking from Holden to take in the whole room, inner monologue seeming to overwhelming the capacity for verbal response. This baffled Holden; was she happy for him? Was she upset? Or did she think he couldn't have landed a guy like Sean? \"How long have you guys been together?\" She asked now, and Holden was glad to return to a conversation after the lingering silence. \"We started talking the night of that party in the woods.\" He replied, and Kate's eyes lit up with understanding, seeming to piece together every time when he had told her he was busy, or the motivation behind some of his actions. \"And you didn't tell me?\" Now her voice was saturated in doubt. \"Well, he didn't want anyone to know. And I didn't want to tell you if it didn't work out. Then I might have gotten too invested too early.\" \"Holden, you've been invested in Sean Jackson for a while.\" She replied, and the smile he had been expecting didn't come. \"Kate, I'm kind of confused right now. Are you…okay with this?\" \"I don't know, Holden; he seems kind of like bad news. I mean, he's always had this bad reputation, and it's one thing to enjoy the thought of him and admire him from afar, but an entirely different thing to start dating him.\" \"What's that supposed to mean?\" Holden questioned as Kate settled into her seat. His nerves were acting up, and he realized that maybe this hadn't been the right decision. \"You're kind of slow dancing in a burning room.\" Kate said, and Holden felt his stomach sink. Why was it that no one could seem to be happy for them? He stood then, not really sure what else to do. \"Holden, don't leave; we can talk about this.\" Kate said, not out of desperation, instead with exasperation tinting her tone. \"No, this was a bad idea. I just wanted to be able to talk to you about him, but I get it; you aren't a fan.\" \"It's not that, Holden; I don't know Sean. I always assumed the first guy you got in a relationship with would be someone we were friends with, something that developed from that and grew into a romance, not someone neither of us has ever really talked to before.\" He turned to her, stopping his trek toward the door to hear her out. She was in the process of standing, rising to her feet and ready to stop him from leaving. \"I care about you, Holden, that's all. And I feel like I can't protect you from someone I don't know.\" He nodded, realizing that they had been on different pages, possibly separate chapters on this subject. \"He's a good guy, Kate. A great guy, actually.\" She smiled warmly, and it felt better then any hot chocolate. \"I'm glad; but now you're going to have to spend the night and tell me everything I missed in those weeks where I was thrown in the closet you two so freely abandoned.\" And Holden was more then happy to embrace his best friend in that moment, welcoming the company of someone so dear to his heart.[Chapter 9] Decode By: KellyCRocker59 Chapter Nine This is where the plot starts to kind of take off, so it might be a little while before I update again; I want this to be as great as possible, which means sorting through my ideas. Anyway, I hope you enjoy this update :) Homecoming; it was the high school equivalent of Hanukkah, in a crude sort of way. Homecoming was a prolonged period of celebration, finally ending on Friday with a parade and an obscenely hyped football game that night. Holden was much for the festivities, not really buying into the theme days, which had worn their welcome his sophomore year with their ridiculously clichéd themes. As a football player, however, Sean was subject to an entirely different sort of scrutiny for school spirit. Alongside the cheerleaders, who were forced to participate in the themed days that they planned, football players were expected to show an ample amount of spirit, since Homecoming was basically their own holiday. The first day wasn't too bad; entitled 'Come as You Are,' the majority of the students could be seen walking around in their pajamas. Holden, never wanting to be seen at less then his best, didn't participate. Sean, of course, came fairly simple, dressed in a plain white short-sleeve v-neck and checkered pajama pants. He had obviously decided not to shave over the weekend either, sporting a coarser beard then usual. Other then the football player in question, Kate decided to dress in a fitted nightgown that looked a bit too nice to be actual sleep ware. The following days ran through other simple themes; Neon Day, Superhero Day, and Twin Day, which led to the grand finale of Spirit Day on Friday. \"This is kind of the lamest costume ever.\" Holden said, pulling at the tight fabric stretching along Sean's chest as they sat in his truck after school. \"You totally dig it, don't lie.\" Sean said with a grin. \"Yeah, you're right.\" Holden replied, allowing the other boy to kiss him and push him down onto the front seat, pinning him with a half-hearted struggle. \"Couldn't you have picked someone a bit more original then Superman?\" \"Well, I would've done Wolverine, but I don't think you could have contained yourself.\" Sean answered, kissing along Holden jaw. After several long moments of making out, Sean pulled away, sitting up. Holden did as well, a bit confused by the thoughtful gaze Sean was giving him. \"What?\" He questioned, voicing his thoughts. \"Well, I've been thinking and…I have an idea. But I don't know if you're going to go for it or not.\" \"Just ask me, I'm sure it's no big deal.\" Holden said, leaning against the frame of the door, fingers dancing lightly along the tight spandex covering Sean's outstretched leg. \"Well, I was wondering if you might…if you would wear my jersey Friday?\" Holden felt the air catch in his lungs, fingers immediately halting their movement on his leg. Every Homecoming, all of the cheerleaders, along with the other girls who had either boyfriends or relatives on the football team, wore the extra away-game jerseys that the football players had, while the football players wore their home-game jerseys. \"Sean, if I…\" Holden knew what Sean was asking of him, and yet he couldn't really feel anything as the other boy's deep pools of hazel drowned all coherent thought from his mind briefly. He recovered with a shake of his head, and he felt Sean leaning forward before he saw it, attempting to reach the other boy across the vehicle as though more contact would make up his mind for him. \"Everyone will know. Everyone will know about both of us. We aren't in California or some liberal state, Sean; everyone is going to hate us.\" \"I don't care,\" Sean replied, and Holden believed him, with his brow furrowed in determination. Sean, the one who was supposed to be so concerned with status and reputation; he wanted everyone to know. \"What if my parents find out? What about yours?\" Holden questioned, avoiding answering the proposal. \"How are they going to find out? Our parents don't go to the parade, and you'll be changed by the game.\" \"Yeah, but…what about the other players? Aren't they going to be pissed when they find out there's a gay guy on the team?\" Sean shrugged. \"Like I said, I don't care; a few weeks ago, maybe, but not now. I want to be with you in public. Not making out and stuff, just being able to talk to you and not worrying about what everyone thinks.\" \"Can't we do that by just being friends ?\" Holden asked, panicking a bit. \"Why are you fighting this? I just want to be with you; isn't that what you've always wanted?\" \"Y-Yeah, but…I don't know, I just don't know that I'm ready, Sean.\" The other boy sighed. \"If not now, then when? You can't keep saying someday, because someday might never happen. The football players, the cheerleaders, anyone else whose opinion we're taught to care about in high school really doesn't matter. All that matters is you and me, and being happy. I don't want to die in some freak accident having regrets, and if we don't do this, then I know I'm going to regret it. I would think you would agree.\" Holden sighed heavily, will power failing him. He looked up from where his eyes had settled on their touching legs, and he felt his heart collapse; something in Sean's eyes made him completely give in to everything. \"I guess I don't really have a choice, do I? I spent my entire high school life building up this reputation that I'm not gay, but here I am, contradicting myself.\" \"Don't even start with the guilt trip; no one is expecting this from me.\" Sean replied, but his tone was considerably lighter, his eyes catching the joy that his face didn't entirely reveal. Holden took a deep breath, realizing what he was about to do. It was Friday, and here he was, seated in his car with a white jersey just a bit too large on, a '42' emblazoned on both the front and back. The air felt just a bit too heavy inside his vehicle, his mind spinning ever so slightly. He willed himself to grab the door handle, forcing it open. Everyone was piling into the school, not too concerned by anyone other then themselves and getting to class on time. Holden took another deep breath, as though it was keeping his heart beating, and he tried to tell himself that this was his one life, and that he needed to slam the door and not be a prisoner anymore. Wait…dammit, that was a Miley Cyrus song. He had put a bunch of inspirational songs on repeat in his car, and yet their strength had abandoned him, leaving only their hooks buried deep within his memory now in the most useless way possible. He took his first step out, the cool early fall air dousing his bare arms, raising the hair as he got out of his car and stood upright, slinging his bag over his shoulders and locking his car. He walked forward toward the entrance, not looking at anyone, yet already feeling eyes on him. He walked through the cafeteria, where all the lower ranks of the social ladder were eating. He continued on, hoping that they were too preoccupied with their meal to notice him. He headed to his locker, checking his phone and noticing that there were only four minutes until first hour started. There was Kate, standing at her locker. She turned toward him, the hallway fairly well deserted besides the two of them. Her eyes took him in, and immediately she dropped her armful of books on the ground. He rushed forward, helping her pick up the textbooks and binders from the floor. \"Are you crazy ?\" She exclaimed in a hushed tone. \"It was his idea; I didn't want to, but he was so convincing with his talk of regrets and freak accidents and those stupid eyes…\" \"You're social status is dead, I hope you know.\" She replied, dialing a number on her phone while balancing her books between her other hand and shoulder. \"You almost here?\" She asked into the device. A reply came, and she spoke again. \"Holden is just pulling some crazy stunt; don't be too shocked when you see him.\" Silence. \"No, he didn't dye his hair red and white; just wait, it's worse then that. We're not going to be able to let him out of our site today.\" Kate hung up and looked back at Holden, still clutching his bag. \"That was Julia; all I'm gonna say is thank God you're working on the senior class float and Julia and I will be there with you all day. This isn't going to end well, Holden.\"[Chapter 10] Decode By: KellyCRocker59 Chapter Ten Well here's the update! I really hope it doesn't skip around too much; I know it's been a prolonged wait, but I hope it is worth it :) Feedback is much appreciated! So maybe Kate was right. Holden felt his stomach sinking even more as he stood there with her in senior hall, and wondered if it was too late to go home and change clothes. Of course it was; he lived twenty miles away, and school started in about three minutes. Three minutes until the reputation he had amassed throughout high school would be obliterated. \"We need to get outside and start working on the senior float.\" Kate replied, voice sounding as though he were underwater, thoughts obstructing his ability to think. He nodded absentmindedly, and Kate grabbed his hand, guiding him down the hall and out the double doors that led to the football field. As they walked out onto the field, Holden spotted Sean and Harrison walking into the school at the other side, backs turned to them. Now, more than ever, he wanted to have the other boy with him. Or maybe that would just make things worse. He was supposed to be proud of this; he was Hester Prynne, not Bella Swan. Lord, why did he just compare himself to two girls? They began work on the float, Kate with effort, Holden with little care. Julia arrived within the hour, as well as several other kids that weren't involved in much else on Homecoming. Julia took one look at him and her jaw went slack, body checking him once, twice, and then finally taking a few more steps forward. \"What is wrong with you ?\" She questioned in his ear, a cautious velocity to her words. \"I had no idea you were…\" \"Yeah, that was kind of what I hoped. Well, until today.\" He replied, trying to keep himself calm. \"You…you and…together?\" Julia asked, gripping his shoulders now, as though he even had the option to retreat. Holden nodded, unable to summon the words to relate his thoughts. \"How long?\" She asked now. \"Would you guys stop gossiping? We need to get this done!\" Kate hollered from the top of the float. Her motives were clear when Holden turned around; the other kids were watching them, analyzing the conversation as much as they were Holden's clothing. They were just a step above burnouts though, so Holden held them with little regard. Regardless, he turned back toward the float and began helping Kate wrap chicken wire around a few posts. Reed came outside with two boxes of pizza around noon, signaling the dwindling time left for work. So far, the group had managed to construct a tribal scene with a hut and bows and arrows around; the opposing team's mascot for the football game was the eagle, so they thought they were clever with their layout. \"Student council bought pizza for you; good job on the float, by the way. You better get the seniors first place.\" He said with a disarming smile. Holden, who had been bent over behind the float attempting to fasten chicken wire, stood at that moment, and Reed's smile flinched, if only briefly, at the sight. \"Nice jersey, Holden.\" He said, words coated in sarcasm; Holden flinched at the edge, realizing the sensation of being on the receiving end of the boy's bad side. \"Thanks.\" He replied nonetheless, attempting earnestness but settling on meekness. Reed turned casually left, headed to the student parking lot to work on the student council float. It was then that everyone sat down to enjoy the pizza; however, Holden was interrupted by the approaching figure of Sean, Harrison beside him. \"How's it going?\" Sean asked casually, Harrison walking over to take a seat beside Julia, who flashed him a smile. \"I'll just say I'm glad that I'm out here with a small group of people.\" Sean chuckled. \"Having doubts?\" \"Yeah; a lot, actually.\" He replied. Sean then began to walk over to the bleachers, not bothering to offer a reason. \"Where are you going?\" Holden called. \"Just come on; I think they can handle everything for a bit without you.\" Holden turned, grabbing a plate and two slices of pizza before hurrying after the jock. \"Are you coming to the game tonight?\" Sean asked. They had found a seat at the top of the bleachers, overlooking all of the float projects to their left. \"Yeah, I was planning on it. I don't think I'm gonna wear this, although it is really comfortable.\" Sean's hand ran along his arm then, a brief touch that raised the hair on Holden's neck. \"I feel bad for this, you know.\" \"Why? Jocks are a lot less accepting then my friends.\" Holden replied, catching Sean's eye as he took a bite of his second slice of pizza, having already devoured the first. \"So Julia and Kate are fine with this?\" \"Well, I wouldn't say fine; both of them think it was a terrible idea. Kate said as much, but I could read it in Julia's tone.\" Sean shrugged then, turning to squint at the field, pondering thoughts that Holden couldn't imagine. \"I see it as this is our one life, and dammit if I'm going to let anyone else live it for me. We deserve to be happy.\" \"Yeah, but this could be more trouble than it's worth.\" Holden replied, finishing the pizza in his hand. \"Not possible; this is priceless. I mean, you are at least.\" Sean said, as though the weight of his words were equivalent to a feather and not a dumpster load of stones. \"Why do you do that?\" Holden questioned. \"What?\" \"Why do you act all sensitive and perfect and stuff? It makes me like you way too much.\" Sean laughed and turned. Holden wondered if anyone could spot them, but resigned himself to 'screw it' and allowed the other boy to kiss him gently, hand grazing his cheek before their lips parted. \"I need to get back inside; I'll see you tonight, after the game?\" He asked. Holden nodded, words struggling to form on his lips. The time inevitably came for the parade, and that was when Holden really felt his heart beating in his ear drums. They all mounted the wheeled station, attached to a truck, and rode it toward their spot in the line-up. The town was small, so the extent of twenty spots in the parade seemed aptly epic for its people. As such, everyone was gathered along the streets, school dismissed for students to watch as well. During the period of waiting, Holden was cornered on the side of the float by both girls. \"Holden, why did you not feel the need to tell me you were gay ?\" Julia asked quietly, seating herself beside him against the sturdy tee-pee at the center of the float. \"I didn't think it really mattered.\" He replied. \"Whether or not it should matter isn't the point, Holden, because it does. \" Kate fired back, sitting on his other side. \"And how long have you guys been together?\" Julia asked. \"I don't know; a month or two I think.\" \"And you're making this public already?\" She questioned. \"Yeah, it seems really rushed to me too, Julia.\" Kate answered. \"We shouldn't have to hide our relationship.\" Holden replied. \"Again, whether or not you should doesn't matter; you don't really have a choice in Mid-West America.\" Kate said. \"Well it's too late now, regardless.\" Julia said. \"You guys are gonna have to stick together. That just sucks for him; there are some really homophobic jocks on the football team.\" Holden nodded, more afraid for Sean than he had been. Yeah, Sean was strong and everything, but one wasn't much of a match for three, four, or five others. \"We just care about you, Holden; I really wish you had talked to me before you had decided to do this.\" Kate said. She may have been attempting to ease his worries, but it hadn't helped. This damn jersey now seemed like the biggest mistake in high school history. \"Are you queer, dude?\" Holden turned, and saw one of the guys that had been working on the float with them standing over the trio. He had a piercing in both ears as well as his lip, and was dressed in a school hoody paired with too-tight jeans. \"Go away, Martin.\" Kate ordered, immediately taking on her ice queen persona that took effect around every straight boy. \"I was just curious; I mean, I was just gonna tell you to watch out at school. People thought I was queer for a long time, and I got all sorts of crap for it.\" \"Oh…alright, thanks.\" Holden replied with hesitance, unsure whether or not Martin's intentions were pure or tainted. But the boy nodded. \"Just trying to do you a solid, man.\" \"I appreciate it.\" Holden answered with a smile, and the boy returned to his seat with his two friends at the other end of the float. \"Things are really going to change, aren't they?\" Holden asked. Kate nodded, and he felt Julia grab his hand. His throat tightened as the gravity of his actions hit him with their full force. \"We'll be here, though. Don't worry, Holden.\" The parade passed without much of a hassle, and Holden found himself back at his house, changing into his pep club shirt for the game. Kate had promised to show up for moral support; Julia showing up to continue what she said was their new tradition. Holden attempted to rid his mind of the memories of the parade, the ones of the people looking at his waving figure in shock and beginning to whisper. He had to believe that they didn't matter; a few more months and high school would be over. They wouldn't matter anymore. The memories, with fears attached like grenades, came with him to the game. While he was no longer sporting the jersey, he could just see the second glances he was garnering. The three of them settled in their seats in the student section, Holden now prepared to marginally understand what was going on. The game began, and he put to rest his worries as he failed to catch any mention of him in the conversations around him. One quarter passed, the home team ahead, and Holden was on his feet with Julia and Kate, cheering. Then, half-time came. With it came a time for actual conversation, which Holden was dreading. Not from Kate and Julia, who had yet to ask him anything about his impulsive decision, but instead of anyone around him. Sure enough, Reed came walking up, a bottle of soda in hand. \"Hey, Reed.\" Julia greeted. Reed stopped, turning toward the three where they now sat. \"Hey, guys; good game, isn't it?\" They all nodded, and Reed just stood there. Holden then realized there was an open spot beside them. \"Do you wanna sit with us?\" He offered. Reed nodded, and Holden thought briefly that there was no longer any ill will held toward him. It had always been Sean though, hadn't it? \"Hey faggot!\" Holden turned, heat rising in his face as he realized that the words were headed in his direction. Heading across the bleachers toward him with purpose was David Acrum, a large boy who had been kicked off the football team due to the failing of multiple drug tests. \"Yeah, you!\" He said, and Holden stood, wondering if he could outrun the other boy to his car. \"Holden, sit down.\" Kate whispered urgently, but Holden couldn't find the will in his legs to oblige. \"What's a queer like you doing at a football game? Checking out all the dudes?\" \"I just want to watch the game, David.\" Holden replied calmly, although he knew his face was red. \"You faggots make me sick!\" And before Holden could move, he was shoved hard, falling down the bleachers and onto the pavement. His bottom half managed to receive the majority of the impact, his head avoiding injury. It still hurt like hell, and he just sat there, stunned. But David was approaching, ready for a fight. Then, Reed was between them. \"Hey douche bag, why don't you go sit down?\" He said. \"What, you his boyfriend?\" David spat. \"I'm just a guy who can't stand meatheads like you who don't know what the hell they're doing. You need to go sit down now, or I'm gonna knock you out.\" \"I could drop you in a second.\" David sneered, looking incredibly ugly in that moment. \"You wanna test me? I'll call the cops on you; let's see you try to cover up that cocaine on your hands.\" David flinched, not replying. Then, he was turning, walking back to a seat. Julia and Kate were on their feet within seconds, hurrying down the steps to Holden. He hadn't realized it, but everyone was watching him then, all of them judging in some way. \"We should probably get you out of here.\" Julia said, and Kate nodded. They lifted him up, and he brushed himself off, a sharp pain searing briefly through his lower half. \"Thanks, Reed.\" Holden said, and Reed turned toward him. \"No problem, Holden. We are friends, after all.\" Holden smiled, reciprocating the one the other boy was offering before he allowed the two girls to lead him toward the parking lot. Sean's fingers ran along Holden's arms, grazing the flesh and moving down to the hem of his shirt. \"I feel like shit, you know. I should've known something like this would happen.\" Holden shook his head, leaning back onto the soft mattress beneath him. Sean's house was abandoned except for the two of them, something that both boys were content with. \"Don't beat yourself up; I'm sure someone's going to anyway.\" \"Seriously, Holden; I can't let you out of my sight at school anymore.\" \"Well that's kind of dramatic; you're going to have to, since we don't have all the same classes. I can take care of myself too; maybe not as well as you could, but I can get the job done. No one's going to do anything too crazy at school, anyway.\" Sean sighed, and he laid down beside Holden, his arms wrapping around the boy's torso and pulling him close. \"Ouch!\" \"Shit, I'm sorry.\" Sean snapped, and Holden chuckled. \"I'm just kidding; I'm not really that sore anymore.\" Sean narrowed his eyebrows in frustration, but leaned in, kissing the other boy softly. Holden clung to the larger boy, who rolled over so that he was on top of him, pinning the other to the bed. Then, Holden's mind was wandering, and his fingers were pulling at the hem of Sean's shirt, which clung dryly to his torso from absorbed sweat. Sean allowed the shirt to be lifted along his back and over his head, their lips parting briefly so the garment could be fully shed. When Sean's lips returned, they were much more desperate, searching for something that Holden's lips couldn't deliver. So Sean's hands came to Holden's shirt, pulling with urgency. Holden arched his back as Sean's callused fingers grazed his bare skin, the shirt pulled over his head. \"You wanna…do this?\" Sean asked, lips pulling back so that he could look into Holden's eyes. They laid there, Sean's hands on Holden's bare skin and feeling welcome, Holden's finger scraping bluntly along Sean's back, attempting to memorize every muscle. And so Holden nodded, abandoning inhibitions for desires for the first time in his life. Sean's lips found his again, now more assured and no longer restrained, traveling along his body. Holden groaned, fingers burying in Sean's hair as he allowed himself to be taken under by the boy whose very being was about to become intertwined with his.[Chapter 11] Decode By: KellyCRocker59 Chapter Eleven The plot thickens! I hope this chapter is up to par; I won't be able to update next weekend, sorry :) So waking up with Sean's arm strewn across his stomach was probably the most amazing feeling that Holden had yet to experience in his life. However, it was the polar opposite of the emotion he held as he walked out to his car after school on Monday with the words 'football faggot' chalked onto the side of his car. He had to spend thirty humiliating minutes at the car wash, attempting to get the dark purple letters washed off. Sean wasn't having much better of a time. The next day he was sporting a black eye, which he said he got from tripping and falling against one of those big tires that they flipped during practice. Holden knew better, especially when it became public knowledge that Sean had been exiled from the jock table. So yeah, their one little action during homecoming had led to the implosion of their social lives. Sean swore up and down that it was worth it, but Holden didn't think so. The good news was that at least they could hang out during school. Yeah, people glared, and Holden got called some sort of slur at least once an hour, but as the days passed, it began to faze him less and less. Kate and Julia still had his back, and Harrison had migrated to their lunch table for Sean's sake. Reed even seemed to making an effort to talk to Holden more, especially in public. People stared when he did, but it kept some of the whispers at bay. This peaked Holden's curiosity as to why Reed had taken such a liking to him, but he wasn't going to complain. It was on a Thursday that Holden began to truly comprehend what his actions had done. It was late on Thursday, eight o'clock at night, to be exact, when the Holden heard his doorbell ring. He was sitting in the family room reading, which was closest to the door, so he got up and answered it with a bit of caution. No one ever showed up so late at their house; hell, no one showed up ever . So when Holden found Sean, face stone cold, standing in his doorway, he wasn't sure how to respond. \"My parents…I couldn't keep it from them. I kept trying to come up with excuses but…it just came out. I didn't know what to do, I just…I just thought maybe…could I spend the night here?\" Holden's heart broke for Sean immediately, but within seconds he was concerned with how he was going to tell his parents about this. Thank God that the entryway was large enough for Sean to stand inside while he went into the family room to ask his parents. \"Just…wait here a second.\" Holden finally answered, opening the door wider and allowing to Sean to come inside, toying with his keys anxiously. Holden rested his hand briefly upon Sean's arm and offered up a smile that he hoped was genuine before walking into the family room. \"Hey, I was just wondering if my friend Sean could spend the night. His…power went out, and he needs a place to get ready for school tomorrow.\" \"Yeah, sure.\" His dad replied, turning away the generic episode of CSI that was playing. His mom then pressed pause on the show (the blessings of DVR). \"Can we meet him before you two go off to play video games or whatever?\" Sean seemed to enter on cue, immediately flashing his brilliant white teeth and seeming more confident than Holden had seen him in a while. \"Hi Mr. and Mrs. Wilson; I'm really sorry if I'm being a trouble.\" He shook Holden's father's hand, and granting his mom an even bigger smile, one that seemed truly genuine. \"Oh it's no bother at all, Sean; do you want to spend the night in Holden's room or would you like to use the guest bedroom?\" His mom asked. \"I can just stay in Holden's room; I wouldn't want to waste space.\" \"Oh no, son, don't worry about that. If you want to use the guest bedroom that's fine; Holden gives off some loud snores.\" His dad said with a smile. \"Dad, I was six last time we slept in the same room.\" Holden replied, rolling his eyes. \"Well I don't think I've ever gotten less sleep in my life. You're like a damn freight train!\" Mr. Wilson answered with a chuckle. Sean laughed in good nature, and then Holden was walking up the stairs. \"Come on, let's get everything organized.\" He resisted the impulse to grab Sean's hand in his, the other boy turning to walk up the stairs. \"It was good meeting you both.\" Sean replied, flashing another award-winning smile for good measure. \"It was nice meeting you too; I hope we'll get to see you around more often.\" Holden's mom replied, a nod of agreement coming from his dad before they turned back to the television. \"You're parents seem really nice.\" Sean said as Holden searched for an extra pillow in his closet. \"Yeah, I love them to death.\" Holden replied absentmindedly, turning to hand Sean the pillow but instead finding a hand clasping the back of his neck and pulling him in for a kiss. His eyes fluttered closed after a brief moment of shock, taking in Sean's musk and allowing the stress to briefly dissipate. Sean pulled back, grinning. \"I just wanted to make sure everything was still worth it.\" \"I'm glad you're still so sure.\" Holden replied, pushing the pillow into Sean's free hand as he moved toward the door, locking it. \"What, you're not?\" Sean questioned, tone darkening. Holden turned back to Sean, and sighed. There Sean stood, in a moment of complete vulnerability. It had taken a lot of time to get this far, and here he was, finding reasons to complain. It wasn't fair to either one of them, and he hadn't ever had life this good. \"I'm sorry.\" He replied, and then he was pushing Sean backwards, the other boy falling onto his bed. Holden yanked his shirt over his head, and crawled on top of the football player. For this moment, they could run away from their problems. The next day, Holden once again thought that all of the crap they were both being put through was worth it, with Sean holding him against his chest. But reality came calling with the sound of his alarm, and he scrambled to shut it off. Sean groaned and stretched, looking over at Holden, who managed to wrap a blanket around his torso as he unplugged his phone from its charger. \"Guess it's time to get back to the real world.\" Sean said, voicing Holden's thoughts. They ate in relative silence, without touching as Holden's mom insisted upon preparing their breakfast. They were out the door by seven-thirty, in time to get to school with just enough extra minutes to spare. Holden pulled into his parking spot just as his phone began to ring in his cup holder. It was Julia; he pressed answer, putting the car in park and killing the engine. \"Holden…you need to get to your locker.\" It was a simple statement, but the inflection in her tone made Holden hurry out of his car, slamming the door shut and walking quickly to the entrance. \"Holden, where are you going so fast?\" He heard Sean call, but Holden speedily made his way through the cafeteria, down the junior hallway, and into senior hall. And there it was. Spray painted in massive red letters was: 'suck cock faggot'. He felt his heart pounding in his ears, and it was only once she was touching his shoulder that he realized Julia was standing beside him. His thoughts were fogged when he heard a roar issued from Sean, who seemed to have caught up with him. \"Who the hell did this? Julia, did you see anything?\" She must have shaken her head, because he just paced in his spot. Holden didn't know what to say, or what to do. There was no way this was coming off of his locker. And then the intercom issued forth an announcement: \"Holden Wilson, please report to the principal's office.\" \"So we've gotten wind of your…behavior.\" Mrs. Wright said, circling her desk and sitting on the front of it to face him. \"While we can't punish your actions, I find it incredibly difficult to comprehend why you would do this.\" \"You're blaming me ? What about who did this to my locker? What about how Sean keeps getting beat up at football practice?\" Holden questioned, temper already thin. \"I'm not blaming you or Sean, Holden. What I'm saying is that I have no idea why you would come out as gay. Can I just tell you something between the two of us?\" She was young, new at this; of course she would try to befriend him, make him feel like she was on his side. But he nodded regardless, curious as to what she would say. \"We live in the Midwest, Holden. People around here barely accept the fact that we have a black president, much less gay individuals. I understand why you would want to come out and be able to express yourself, but here is simply not the place to do it. I would support you; I do support you, and will back you up through all of this. But there's only so much I can prevent.\" Holden nodded, knowing that she was simply speaking the truth. \"Do you know who did it?\" She nodded. \"We think so; we need you to leave for the questioning though.\" \"Are you going to talk to Sean?\" He asked, more out of curiosity than worry. Sean could easily take care of himself. \"Probably; he's as much a part of this as you are.\" Holden nodded and stood. \"Holden, don't take this into your own hands.\" She warned. \"Trust me, I won't; I have my future to think about.\" She smiled. \"Now that's a model student.\" He headed for the door, but then she spoke again. \"Holden, wait.\" He turned, and her expression had softened. \"Just…don't give up who you are, okay? No matter what kind of stuff happens be true to you.\" He nodded, feeling affected by the kind words despite the threat of corniness overwhelming the moment. The day passed with whispers all around him; the janitor had managed to clean off his locker, although it had taken the entirety of first and second hours to do so. Sean stayed near Holden most of the day, flashing a menacing snarl at any guy that looked like he might touch Holden. It was both a kind gesture and a hindering one, with Holden feeling more than a little effeminate because of it. However, as the final bell rang and Holden headed for his car, Sean approached him with a smile. \"My dad called; he apologized for last night. He said wants to sit down and really discuss this all with me. He says they'll accept me no matter what.\" Holden smiled for him, the mood of the day immediately lightening. \"That's awesome! I'm crazy happy for you.\" \"You should tell your parents; it's such a nice feeling, not having to hide anything from anyone.\" Sean replied, and then he pulled Holden in for a quick kiss, despite the crowded parking lot. Holden faintly heard someone yell 'queers' across the lot, but he didn't care, kissing the other boy back. \"I'll talk to you tonight.\" Sean said, pulling away with a new grin that threatened to crack his face. Holden padded down the stairs; dinner was finished, and it was a Friday night. Being the social hermit he was, he was staying home; Sean had plans with Harrison, and he didn't really feel like hanging out with friends. So here he was, attempting to gather up all of his strength with each step. His parents sat in the living room, watching another cop procedural. He stopped at the foot of the stairs, just kind of standing there. His mom pressed pause, and they both turned to him. \"What's wrong, Holden?\" She asked. \"I…I need to talk to you guys about something.\" He replied, and walked across the hardwood, taking a seat on the coffee table, equally distant from both of them. \"What is it, son?\" His dad asked, brow furrowed by Holden's expression. He attempted to not look so torn, but it was unsuccessful. \"I just need, I need to tell you something.\" \"Whatever it is Holden, it can't be anything that will make us love you less.\" His mom replied. He thought back to the times he would watch shows on the CW with his mom, or when he would tell his parents that he really liked the new Lady Gaga song. How could they not have an inkling of suspicion? \"I…\" He felt his eyes watering, and cursed his influx of emotions when a situation got high stakes. \"What is it, Holden?\" His dad asked, now thoroughly concerned. \"I…\" \"Holden, dear, it's okay; did you get a girl pregnant? Did you get a ticket?\" \"I'm gay.\" He blurted out; his mother's guesses seemed worse to him than the truth. But silence ensued, and he couldn't look at his parents. Then, his dad spoke. \"Get out.\" He looked up, and his dad's eyes were unreadable. The glass ceiling that kept his world restrained from collapse was cracking. \"W-What?\" He asked, wondering if he heard right. \"Get out of my house.\" His father repeated, tone volatile. He turned to his mom, who just looked at him in shock. And so he stood, his legs weak, mind swimming. He walked to the kitchen, grabbed his keys, and walked into the garage. He opened the garage door, and he drove off; the glass ceiling had collapsed, and his world was broken.[Chapter 12] Decode By: KellyCRocker59 Chapter Twelve Sorry for the hiatus; this chapter isn't too long, but I think it helps to really set things up for the future. I hope you enjoy it! :) The drive to Sean's house was the longest of his life. He rolled the windows down, despite the flurries of rain, because he just couldn't seem to get air to his lungs. He couldn't manage to turn on the radio, lost in his thoughts. They weren't much, consisting simply of his father's words repeating over and over again. The look on his mom's face was tattooed upon his memory for what he believed to be eternity. This all led him here, standing on Sean's porch. There was no roof over the front door to keep the rain at bay, and he was gradually becoming drenched as he rang the doorbell. A woman answered within a minute, eyes kind and face laced in concern at the teenager before her. \"Oh dear, what's happened to you?\" Apparently he looked worse than he had realized. \"I…Is Sean…I'm…\" He couldn't manage a coherent thought, because just seeing someone who didn't despise him broke him completely. She seemed to understand despite this, opening the door wider. \"Come in before you catch pneumonia.\" He stepped inside, standing on the welcome mat and unsure of what to do now. \"Sean, there's a boy here for you!\" She called up the stairway near the front door. She turned to him then. \"What's your name, hun?\" \"Holden, ma'am.\" He replied, clutching himself as the chills set in. \"Holden!\" She added up the stairs before walking back over to him. \"We need to get you into some dry clothes. Go into the laundry room over there; I just washed a bunch of Sean's clothes. You should be able to fit into most of it.\" He nodded as she pointed in the direction of the hallway several steps away. Holden walked down the hallway and into the spacious room he believed she had meant. He closed the door and stripped, setting his clothes on the washing machine and deciding on a plain blue shirt and sweats from the hangers of clean clothing. Guilt panged him at the dependence upon this family, but then the door was opening and he turned to see Sean standing there, concern splashing his features. \"I…I told them.\" Holden said, now unable to look into the other boy's eyes. \"Holden…\" Arms encircled him, and he felt the sobs racking him again. He felt like a complete girl now, unable to control himself as he wrapped his arms around Sean and allowed himself a moment of vulnerability. \"Sean, did he find something to wear?\" His mom called from where Holden believed to be the entryway. \"Yeah!\" He called back, arms leaving Holden and immediately leaving the other boy cold. Sean's hand found his, however, and he guided him back to the entryway where his mom stood. \"How are you feeling, dear?\" She asked. \"Better; thank you, ma'am.\" Holden replied, nodding. She granted him a bright smile, and then turned to Sean. \"Are there enough blankets upstairs for him to stay upstairs?\" Following Sean's nod, she continued. \"Your dad isn't going to be home until the morning; he had some business he needed to take care of. Just be sure not to get too wild.\" \"Mom…\" Sean began, and Holden turned to find a slight blush spreading across the other boy's face. \"Oh dear, I didn't mean it like that! It's late, and I'm sure Holden is tired; you should probably get his bedding ready.\" Sean nodded, and Holden felt Sean's hand leave his as he walked up the stairs, leaving him there in the entryway alone with his boyfriend's mom. \"Are you hungry, Holden?\" She asked. He shook his head. \"Thirsty, maybe?\" He shrugged, acknowledging the dryness in his throat at that moment. \"Yeah, I guess I could use some water if that's okay.\" \"Of course! Here, it's this way.\" She replied, walking through what Holden assumed to be the family room and into the kitchen. \"I don't know exactly what happened, but I have a pretty good idea…I'm very sorry for you, dear.\" She said as she retrieved a glass and filled it with ice and water. \"Thank you; I just think I should've known not to say anything.\" \"No, this is not your fault, Holden!\" She exclaimed, setting the glass in front of him and leaning against the counter. He wasn't sure how to respond to that, instead sipping at the water in silence. \"When Sean told us, I was just so shocked. Mark, my husband, he just spoke out of confusion without thinking. He needed to clear his head, I think, which wasn't fair to leave Sean hanging like that, but it led to a better result. What I'm trying to say is that no matter how your parents feel now, I'm sure that they will understand. I love him, but I never thought that Sean's dad would accept this about him. He was raised in such a strict Catholic home that he has always been closed off to more contemporary religious views about this sort of thing.\" Holden nodded, and then she touched his hand, which was resting on the counter. \"Just know that you can stay here as long as you need to, Holden. We love Sean, and if he cares about you, then so do we.\" \"Thank you, Mrs. Jackson.\" Holden replied, not sure of what else to say. \"Do you wanna get some sleep?\" He turned and found Sean leaning against the counter behind him, watching the two of them. \"Yeah, I'm pretty tired.\" Holden replied. \"Here, I'll take that glass.\" Mrs. Jackson said, and took it from him, setting it on a towel by the sink. \"Come here, I think you need a hug.\" Holden smiled, turning a bit red as she put her arms around him. He bit his lip; her small frame felt too much like his own mother's, and the memories he had managed to sedate now flared back into the fore front of his mind. \"Goodnight, Mom.\" Sean said, as Holden pulled away and walked out of the kitchen and toward the stairs. \"Oh no, Son, you're not getting out of here without a hug too.\" She replied, and he sighed in mock exasperation, walking around the counter to give her a hug. \"I love you, Sean.\" She said. \"Love you too, Mom.\" He replied, and then pulled away and walked back toward Holden, stepping in front of the other boy and leading him up the stairs. \"Goodnight!\" His mom called. \"Night!\" Sean replied as he bound up the stairs. Holden stepped into Sean's bedroom behind him, eyeing the sheets, blankets, and pillows that had been haphazardly organized on the ground. \"It needs to at least look like you didn't sleep in my bed.\" Sean explained, closing and locking the door. Holden smiled slightly, and Sean reached out to touch him, using his shirt to pull him forward. When their lips met, Holden flinched, remembering what his father had said. \"What?\" Sean asked, concern knitting his brow as he pulled back. Holden became hyper aware of the other boy's hands on his hips, thumbs gently gliding beneath the fabric and against his hip bones. \"I just…my dad…\" Holden explained. Sean sighed, but he saw understanding in the other boy's eyes. \"Okay; we don't have to do anything tonight. It's better for us to just sleep on this anyway.\" Holden nodded, and Sean walked over to the bed, pulling his sheets back before stripping his shirt and pants off, leaving him in his boxers. Even now, with the dim light of a bedside lamp illuminating the other boy, it was difficult for Holden not to act of his instincts. Holden pulled off his own shirt but remained in his boyfriend's sweats, something that felt oddly comforting now that he considered it. \"Come here.\" Sean whispered, voice course in its sparseness. Holden did so, and Sean pulled him in. He felt every inch of muscle pressed against his skin, hard and yet soft, callused fingers running along his shoulder blades and down to his hips. \"I love you.\" Sean whispered against his hair, and Holden felt his heart leaping into his throat. \"I…I love you too.\" Holden whispered, and now he was clinging to Sean for fear of his knees giving out beneath him. Sean moved then, turning and lowering Holden onto his bed before clicking off the light. It wasn't erotic, the look he caught in the football player's eyes just before the light left the room. It was something Holden hadn't seen before. Then Sean was on top of him, rolling onto his side and pulling Holden against his chest. He buried his face in the larger boy's chest, breathing in the familiar scent of pine and musk that always exuded from the other. It was comforting, and he thought maybe if he stayed here like this forever, all the pain may cease to exist.[Chapter 13] Decode By: KellyCRocker59 Chapter Thirteen Sorry that it's been so long! I'm really happy with all of the stuff I covered in this chapter, and I hope that it's conveyed as well as I tried for it to be! Note: Jason Morris is Topher Grace in the film. Holden couldn't fathom how things had turned so ugly so fast. Standing here, looking right into her eyes, he realized that everything he thought he knew, everything he had trusted, was a lie. The weekend was amazing. Sean's dad was this really manly dude who loved football at least as much as his son, and for the most part seemed rather easy going. Of course Sean's mom remained hospitable; if Holden's brow creased in the slightest, she was upon it, asking if she could get him anything. It was the life he could picture himself having years from now, with family around him that cared for him. But he was cautious; this wasn't his family, and he shouldn't pretend any different. Sunday was when he got the call. It was Julia, asking him if he had talked to Kate. She seemed distressed, a rare occurrence for the girl. \"What's wrong?\" Holden asked, taking a seat on Sean's bed as the other boy watched him with a creased brow. \"Kate, she….she isn't who we thought she was.\" Julia said, and Holden forced back the urge to question the legitimacy of her statement. \"What do you mean?\" He settled on asking. \"Holden, she's…people knew about you a long time before you and Sean came out.\" \"What?\" He questioned. Julia had to have been misinformed; there was no way that Kate, his best friend for years, would tell anyone. \"She's said stuff about all of us. She's told people I'm this big whore, that I sext guys all the time and am this huge tease. Sean, she's told people that he's just using you, that he probably hooks up with girls on the weekends and stuff. She's been telling people that she has no idea why you two are together; she says he could do a lot better.\" \"I don't think she would say that, Kate.\" But as he replied, his phone began to beep. Harrison was calling him. \"Just a second Julia, Harrison is calling me.\" Holden informed her. \"Oh I forgot about Harrison! Just wait until he tells you what's gone down.\" Holden sighed, putting Julia on hold and answering the other call. \"Hey, Harrison, Julia's on the other line.\" \"Connect us.\" He said, practically demanding. Holden did so, eyeing Sean in the process. The other boy was sitting in a chair, watching the conversation play out. His attention had piqued when he had heard Harrison's name, but now he was toying with a string attached to the cushion beneath him. \"Do you want me to put them on speaker?\" Holden asked, covering the phone. \"No it's fine; you can just tell me later.\" Sean replied, and Holden shrugged, returning the phone to his ear. \"Holden, are you there?\" Julia asked. \"Yeah, I'm here.\" \"Alright; Harrison, do you want to start this?\" \"I guess. Okay, Holden, I know you're best friends with Kate, but she isn't who you thought she was. She isn't who any of us thought she was.\" \"Yeah, Julia already told me what she said, but surely that's all just a rumor.\" \"No, Holden, you don't understand; she told Marcus about you. She said that you have these fantasies about him, and that you always talking about wanting to have sex with him and how hot he is, and that's why he spray-painted that thing on your locker. She has been talking shit on all of us for a long time now.\" \"W-What?\" Holden asked, not comprehending what Harrison had said. He remembered the words vividly; Marcus was on the football team, and yes, he was a very attractive broad-shouldered boy that Holden wouldn't have turned down on a cold night prior to being with Sean. But he had never vocalized this to Kate, and he wasn't obsessed with him by any means as she had made him out to be. \"How did you find this out?\" \"It's a really long story; Kate's been posting stuff on Facebook about all of us, and has had little groups set up that talk about how big of sluts certain people are or whether or not a certain person is gay or is one person has slept with another. It's twisted, Holden.\" \"I don't know if I believe this.\" He replied. He thought about all of the times he had shared with Kate, all of the secrets he had entrusted to her. \"I was called into the office by Mrs. Wright on Friday; apparently things have gotten so out of hand that some guys on the football team were gonna beat me up pretty bad. Kate started a rumor that I was jealous of you, and that I was going to sleep with every guy on the football team.\" Harrison said. Holden knew that Harrison wouldn't lie. He felt his head spinning, a heated rage taking over him. \"That…bitch.\" It was all that he could manage to say, and he noticed Sean's alerted shift in position at his words. \"I told you, Holden! She needs to be stopped. I've already told multiple people what she's said about them; I was able to get one of the members of the computer geeks to hack into her Facebook account and see what she's been posting in these little groups of hers. I was going to tell you sooner, but I wanted to make sure everything was right.\" Julia said. \"It's all true, Holden. It seems straight out of a damn movie, but it's true.\" Harrison said. And with those words, Holden realized that he had lost his best friend. Sean was pissed. He was pissed at Marcus, for spray painting Holden's locker. He was kind of pissed at Harrison for not telling him sooner. But more than anything, he was pissed at Kate for everything she had said. After Holden had told him, he could see a powerful fury taking over the other boy, and he had to physically calm him down from going to Kate's house and lighting it on fire or something. Monday came around, and Sean had settled down a little bit. Holden had convinced him not to make a scene out of anything, and that they should just play it off like nothing had happened. Of course, Holden wasn't surprised when he was called to Mrs. Wright's office during second hour. \"I'm guessing you know what's been going on.\" She said. Holden nodded from the seat across the desk from her. \"I'd like you to know that it's under control, and that she has been stopped. Normally, I wouldn't be able to interfere with out of school matters like this, but everything has grown so out of control that I was forced to step in. Know that you have nothing else to worry about.\" \"How long has this been going on?\" He asked, feeling more comfortable with her since their last talk. \"For the majority of this school year; did you have any knowledge of this, Holden?\" \"No; Kate and I were best friends, and I honestly didn't think anything could change that.\" \"I have to ask you to not ostracize her, Holden.\" \"What?\" \"I know that she hurt you and all of your friends, but it's considering bullying to treat someone that way, no matter whether or not it's warranted.\" \"So you're asking me to act like nothing's wrong?\" Holden questioned, perplexed by her request. \"No; you don't have to be friends with her, but don't gang up on her is all I'm asking.\" Holden considered her words, and then nodded. He doubted that he could abide by this request, but he could try. It was impossible. He saw her as he was walking with Sean to his truck after school. She was in their path, not seeming to know that they would be forced to walk past her to leave. No one stood around her, which made him oddly glad. He knew he shouldn't take this much joy in her suffering, but she hadn't earned sympathy. \"Go ahead; I'm gonna talk to her.\" Holden told Sean, who seemed on edge upon spotting Kate. \"You sure you don't want me there?\" He asked. \"She's not a guy, Sean; I think I can take her if she tries to attack me.\" Sean snorted a laugh, and then continued past her. Holden stopped, and she turned toward him, seeming to just now realize he was there. \"Do you have anything to say?\" He asked. \"No, not really.\" She replied, and he felt his stomach turn. It really was over. \"You don't think I at least deserve an apology for what you said?\" He asked. \"No, I don't Holden, and you know why? All of our friends talk about each other. It's not like I did any different, and yet you all gang up on me? That's not fair. I hate drama, and you know that. I'm trying to avoid it, and if that means avoiding you, I'll do it.\" \"What are you even talking about? Our friends talk about each other when get in fights, yes, but who doesn't? You made up lies , Kate! You started Facebook groups about us? You really think you did nothing wrong?\" \"I'm done with this.\" She replied, and with that she turned, walking over to Jason Morris. She grabbed his hand, intertwining their fingers as he flashed a smile and they walked to his car. Holden's stomach felt sick as he realized why she was so apathetic about saving their friendship now. \"I need to talk to you about something.\" Holden turned to Sean as they rode in his truck to his house; it was a thirty minute drive, so whatever he was about to say was going to have ample time for conversation. \"What is it?\" Holden asked, absentmindedly reaching out to touch Sean's free hand on the arm rest, but the other boy flinched away. \"What's wrong, Sean?\" \"Holden, with all of this going on…I…well, I just think that there's so much drama, and everyone is mad and the whole school is kind of up in arms about what Kate did…\" \"Sean, just tell me.\" Holden interrupted, sick of the waiting. He had survived a terrible day at school, and this boy was really his remaining life line, so he would rather not have him tip toe around his thoughts. \"I don't think we should be together right now.\" If Holden's stomach had turned all day, it was now at the brink of implosion. His vision got foggy, and he pulled his hand from the armrest as though it had been burning hot. \"I still love you, Holden, but it's just that it would be best if we didn't draw attention to ourselves with everyone on edge like this. You can still stay with me and everything; nothing has to change, except I think that we just need to take a break and cool down. We've been moving really fast anyway.\" \"You're scared.\" Holden managed out. He was gnawing at the inside of his cheek, just waiting to taste warm liquid. \"What?\" Sean asked. \"You're a scared little boy who is suddenly afraid of offending people! Well guess what, Sean? It's a little late to take back being gay; you can't exactly walk back into the closet!\" \"Dammit, Holden, it's not like that. I want to be with you, it's just that I don't want you getting hurt because people are pissed at Kate and want to take out their anger on someone. It'd be really easier to make the gay kids a target.\" \"You keep giving me these excuses, but it doesn't change anything. Maybe if you had thought this before Homecoming, it would be different. But people know, and if they feel like beating up a gay kid, they're going to do it whether or not he's single or in a relationship.\" \"Holden…lord, why does this have to be so difficult with you?\" He was getting frustrated, Holden could tell. But he was too pissed to care. \"Whatever, Sean; if you want to break up with me, then it's done. I'll leave your house as soon as we get there.\" \"You don't have to do that.\" Sean's voice had lost a bit of its edge, and it made Holden's heart ache a little more. \"Yeah, I do. It's whatever, Sean. You don't want to be a couple, then we don't have to be a couple.\" Holden turned to the window, and despite Sean's gaze and lingering presence beside him, they didn't speak for the rest of the ride.[Chapter 14] Decode By: KellyCRocker59 Chapter Fourteen Wow, this chapter flew by for me! I hope you enjoy reading as much as I enjoyed writing it. Please review; I use them for survival :) P.S. I'm Introducing a new character, and since the film is bursting with famous actors, I thought I'd cast this one as well: Brian - Channing Tatum Also, Liz is Anne Hathaway in the film if anyone forgot; I hope you all like this chapter! Winter came with nearly a foot of snow, something unexpected by anyone in the area. Sean hadn't talked to Holden since the breakup, which made the lunch table conversations even more awkward. Not that lunch was at the top of his priority list: college scouts were sending him more and more letters, so he was going to have to decide soon where he was going to play college football at. Holden was always in his mind though, and he wanted to talk to him about this, about them and about whether or not he should keep the other boy in mind when choosing a school. But this snow meant that that wasn't going to happen. School had been cancelled for the week; it was an uncharacteristic decision by the superintendent, but considering that the forecast was for temperatures in the teens and flurries throughout the week, it was justified. Sean spent the week either holed up in the home gym or watching Sports Center; just because their little town was buried in snow didn't mean that the rest of the country wasn't in full swing, and that included football. His mom questioned him often about Holden, and why he was so down. He dodged her questions as well as he could; he was used to not opening up, so it wasn't all that difficult. His dad was a different story, though. While Mr. Jackson had yet to seem comfortable with his son's sexuality, Sean was vulnerable to his stern voice and demanding gaze. He usually only brought both out when his wife was concerned for the well-being of their son, but with as much as she was worrying over him, Sean prayed every day that his dad wouldn't bring up anything when he was spotting him on his bench press. Friday came faster than Sean had expected, and then it was the weekend. The snow cleared off gradually, and Sean got a call from Harrison Saturday about a party that Morley Clarkson – who else – was holding at her house with her parents stranded in Los Angeles on a business trip. Snow plows had fairly well cleared the roads, so Sean agreed to go. Apparently everyone had missed each other all week, because by the time Sean and Harrison arrived, windows had been thrown open to blast music and people were already running around outside half-naked despite the climate. \"You sure you wanna do this?\" Harrison asked with a chuckle. \"Yeah…I'm sick of thinking so much.\" Sean replied, climbing out of the car and heading inside. Within the hour, Sean had knocked out five cups of beer, and was pouring himself a sixth. He could feel his inhibitions slipping, looking around to find girls everywhere in only their bras and panties, grinding on boys more than happy with their position. Times like these made Sean want to be straight, or at least bisexual; then maybe he could just have sex with enough girls to forget Holden. God knows that his coming out had hardly dented his sex appeal in the eyes of the cheerleaders. Speaking of which, he felt an arm snaking its way around his torso, rubbing along his stomach and over his pecs. It was smaller and softer then he liked, and the voice that accompanied solidified his suspicions. \"Hey, sexy.\" Liz Curran whispered, on her tip toes in an attempt to reach his ear. Sean was too tall though, so she seemed to settle on nuzzling his shoulder blade. \"What do you want, Liz?\" Sean asked, finding the sentence more difficult to piece together than he had thought. \"I think you know. I heard you and the gay kid broke up.\" \" I'm gay, Liz.\" Sean emphasized, too drunk to be pissed at the label she had given Holden, despite the flare of rage that had caught in his chest. Liz's hands found their way to settle on his chest, smile bright but eyes scheming. \"Yeah, yeah, whatever; we all know you're just trying to get attention from those college scouts. What school wouldn't want the recognition of having one of the only out gay football players who's actually good ?\" Sean shook his head. \"That never even crossed my mind.\" Liz's hand was now rubbing his jeans. It was doing nothing for him, especially with those damn eyes looking so manipulative. But he could try this; maybe it would help to get his mind off of Holden. Maybe he would even like being with a girl. \"So do you wanna go find a room, or what?\" She asked, leaning up close to him, grinding her hips against his as she took his hand in his. He felt the ache of missing Holden's larger ones, and nodded without another thought. She smiled wide, turned, and led him through the crowd. Sean shoved drunken teenagers out of his way as they went, the alcohol shortening his fuse even more than when he was sober. They found an empty room down a hallway further into the house, the other rooms already locked with various sounds coming from within. Liz grabbed his arm with surprising force and pushed him onto the large bed, Sean falling without a fight. She climbed atop him, pulling her shirt over her head and then leaning down to kiss him. It felt weird, having a girl's lips against his. Wrong almost, not feeling the stubble against his face; he forced himself onward regardless, gripping Liz's hips and rolling them over so that he was on top now, getting onto his knees. He yanked his shirt over his head, joining their lips again while she worked at unfastening his pants. Then, Sean heard the door creak open. He got on his knees and turned; there was Holden, shoved up against the door frame with Brian Lanch's lips on his. Brian was a tennis player from a school nearby, and Sean had met him through various sporting events between their schools. The sight made Sean's blood boil; he completely forgot about Liz, stumbling off of the bed toward them. Neither boy seemed to notice the other two inhabitants of the room, and as Sean grabbed Brian's shoulder, spinning him around, shock only barely registered because the football player punched him in the face as hard as his muscles would allow. \"Sean, what the hell!\" Holden snapped, getting on his knees beside Brian, who was groaning and clutching his face. \"No, what the hell to you, Holden! We've been broken up for what, a few weeks? You're already making out with this other dude?\" Sean questioned, shaking his hand as pain began to swell within the appendage. \"Well it doesn't seem like you're wasting any time either!\" Holden retorted, eyeing Liz, who was now sitting up in the bed with a twisted sort of humorous look on her face. \"That's…it's not the same…\" Sean replied, looking down as he was caught in his hypocrisy. \"How is it not ? It looks to me like you were about to get it on if I hadn't stumbled in here.\" \"Dammit, Holden, I just wanted to feel something ! I'm so sick of thinking about you all the damn time!\" Sean yelled, and he knew he was getting too loud. \"I'm not talking to you about this right now; you're trashed. If you want to talk, I guess you can text me or something. Just don't drive home, alright?\" Holden replied, helping a completely stunned Brian to his feet. \"Whatever, Holden; nothing's going to change.\" Sean said, turning back toward Liz, not sure why but just sick of looking at Holden. \"You're right, Sean, it's not. You're the one who broke up with me; I didn't want this. I was in love with you. I still…\" \"Hey gay boy, don't you need to get your new squeeze some ice?\" Liz interrupted. Holden looked over at her, brow furrowing at her comment. He helped Brian along nonetheless, the larger boy seeming to gain his balance with each passing step. Sean was frozen in his steps as they left, and Liz climbed off the bed, walking over to the door and pushing it shut before turning the lock. \"Okay, where were we?\" Her hands moved along Sean's bare stomach, nails scraping along the muscle. \"You were leaving.\" \"What?\" She questioned, hands fleeting as quickly as they had come. Sean turned toward her, the final traces of his rage channeling toward her. \"You're a whore, Liz. Go spread your legs for someone else; I don't want it.\" \"Fine; I knew you were a faggot anyway.\" She snapped, grabbing her shirt and pulling it over her head haphazardly before storming to the door, trying to pull it open before realizing that it was still locked. \"Hey Liz,\" She turned to him as she unlocked the door. \"If you ever call Holden anything again, I'll snap your skinny little bitch body in half. Got it?\" \"Go screw yourself.\" She replied, stomping out of the room. Sean took a seat on the bed, putting his face in his hands. How the hell had he managed to screw up his life so severely? The weekend ended faster than Sean had wished, due mostly to the majority of Sunday being used as a day to recover from a severe hangover. His hand hurt like hell, too, which made working out a laborious task. So he was kind of glad to get back into school…until he saw Brian with Holden in the parking lot after school. He didn't approach them, not wanting to make a scene in front of everyone, but it made his stomach lurch and his head hurt as he watched Brian stand just a little too close to Holden and graze his arm with his fingers. Sean drove home, thinking that Christmas break couldn't get here fast enough. That was, of course, until Harrison texted him about the winter dance being held by student council. It was unlikely that Holden was going to show up; he only started going to football games once they had started dating, and Kate was in student council, so he was sure to want to avoid anything involving her. So Sean agreed to go; he definitely didn't have any other plans for Friday night. As he was heading down the stairs on Friday night to go, dressed in a plaid shirt and dark jeans, he halted at the sound of his dad's voice. \"Sean, can we talk to you for a moment?\" Sean walked into the living room where they sat, taking a seat on the couch. \"Yeah?\" \"Honey, what's going on with Holden? I certainly miss him, and while your dad hasn't gotten to meet him yet, he is concerned about you always being in such a sad mood.\" Sean sighed, looking over at his dad. He wished he hadn't, because his dad was looking at him in that way, and before he knew it, the words came pouring out. \"I ended it. A bunch of stuff went down with this girl at school, and I just didn't want him to get hurt. But I…I miss him.\" \"Then why don't you go after him, dear?\" His mom suggested. \"It's not that easy, Mom; at Morley's party the other night, he was with this other guy, a tennis player from another school.\" \"And you're going to let him stop you? Son, I raised you to go after what you want, and if you want this Holden boy, you need to go for it.\" His dad said, and Sean looked back over at him and found a strength that he could only see through the encouragement of his father. \"If I hadn't been kept with business during Holden's stay here, I'm sure I would've seen what your mom saw, and that's you happier than you've ever been. Why would you want to let that get away?\" Sean nodded, motivated now more than ever. \"I need to get to the dance.\" He said, standing. His mom nodded, and he headed toward the door. He stopped before opening it, and turned back to his parents. \"Hey…thanks for everything. You know, loving me and stuff.\" \"Of course, honey.\" The car ride to the dance was filled with thoughts about Holden set to Arcade Fire, the perfect soundtrack for Sean's introspection. He got to the dance too soon, not ready to abandon the comforting shell of his car. But then Harrison was pounding on his window with a particularly lively expression on his face, so Sean got out, prepared to have as much fun as possible at a school dance. Once inside, Sean's mind was numbed by the blasting of Top 40 songs that he was all too familiar with. The two boys paid the three dollars necessary to get in, and headed into the gym. There were a sparse number of students there, only a small group dancing. However, Sean noticed these people to be some of his friends, so he motioned for them to join the group. But of course, Sean didn't notice that the person dancing the most wild out of all of them was Holden. \"Hey, Sean!\" Julia said over the loud music, clothed in a short red dress that looked dazzling on her. She grabbed Harrison's hands instead of giving a proper greeting, and began to dance with him over the throbbing beats of the next song. Sean eyed Holden, who was still dancing but seemed a little less enthused than before. \"Come on, Sean; dance!\" Harrison said, moving with Julia in a thankfully non-grinding way. Sean hated when couples thought they could get nasty just because the lights were down, like everyone else wanted to see it. He noticed the song to be Lady Gaga, and considering that she was pretty much the queen of the gays, he figured he should at least try to dance. Of course it didn't go as well as planned, but he was thankful to be in a crowd where his actions looked less obnoxious. Julia stopped dancing after several songs and moved toward Holden, telling him something. Holden nodded and walked off toward the student council room, which was past the double doors of the gym and up a flight of stairs. Sean listened for the next song to play, and recognized it to be some stupid rap song; one that he was sure would involve plenty of grinding from the other jocks and the girls. It was an excuse enough for him to get out of the room, so he followed Holden's path to the student council room. As he entered the large room, looking more like a storage area than an actual classroom, he spotted Holden grabbing some cups from a cupboard in the back. Holden turned as he heard the door close, and Sean realized that nearly all of the music was blocked out now. It was just them, just silence. \"What are you doing in here?\" Holden asked, immediately returning to the task of getting extra cups from various boxes. \"Holden, I just walk to talk to you. I'm…I'm sorry for what happened last weekend.\" \"Brian's a nice guy, you know. He's sweet, and if he hadn't drunk a bit too much he probably wouldn't have had me pinned against that door.\" Holden said, the edge to his voice blunting slightly. Sean took another step across the wide expanse separating them. It was a damn annoying metaphor for the current moment. \"I know he is, and I'm sorry. Tell him I'm sorry too.\" Silence followed, and Sean took it as his cue to continue. \"Are you two…together?\" Holden shrugged, and then he turned, seeming to have as many cups as he needed. \"I don't know; we just got to talking and I…I needed someone to talk to and he was there.\" He began to walk forward, attempting to leave, but Sean blocked his path. \"Holden, please…I'm sorry I did this. I want us to be us again. What we had, I can't just let something like that go because of other people.\" He took another step forward, and their bodies were almost touching, the cups cradled in Holden's arms the only thing keeping them apart. \"Sean, you just dumped me. You thought things were getting too difficult, so you hit the eject button. I'm kind of a pushover, but I refuse to be the one who's here waiting no matter what. And what the hell was that with Liz at the party?\" Sean sighed, catching Holden's walls coming back into place as he fully recalled last weekend. \"It was nothing. I was just trying to get my mind off of you, and there were no guys around. She was all over me, and I was drunk and it just seemed easy. And the only reason I broke up with you is because I was concerned about you . I was worried that you were going to get hurt. But I need to be more selfish, I guess. I think we both deserve to be happy, and I think the only way that's going to happen for me is to be with you.\" He reached out, touching Holden's arm. Holden didn't flinch like Sean thought he would, which was a good sign. \"Sean…\" He began, but Sean stopped him, not wanting excuses, not wanting anything to stand between them now. He grabbed the cups from Holden's arms, setting them on the table beside them. He cupped Holden's face in his hands; it felt better than he had remembered. Holden's eyes were melting of conflict, and Sean leaned in before another word could be said, capturing the other boy's lips against his. It was flawless, everything that he wanted it to be. Holden's hands, cautious, pressed against Sean's chest, large palms feeling right against him. Sean deepened the kiss, hands moving to Holden's hips and pulling them even closer. Holden kissed back, arms moving to encircle Sean's neck and pull him down. Sean went with it, hands working their way to his shirt, unbuttoning the clothing as quickly as he could. Holden shoved it from his shoulders as soon as he could, leaving Sean in a plain white t-shirt. Sean began to unbutton Holden's flannel, but as he did, pressing their chests together, Holden pulled back. \"I-I…we can't do this, Sean. Not here and not right now.\" He hastily re-buttoned his shirt, Sean just standing there in shock. \"What are you doing? I thought…\" \"Sean, I…you know how I feel about you. But we need to take this slow. I mean when we broke up, you said we had moved too fast. I hardly think having sex in the student council room constitutes as slowing down.\" Sean sighed and pulling his shirt back on, buttoning it. \"Are you still going to see Brian?\" \"I don't know, Sean, maybe. Maybe he's going to ask me out and maybe I'm going to go on a date with him. Maybe I'll say no, or maybe he just won't ask me. Honestly, I think we both just need to wrap our heads around what we are to each other.\" \"I know what you are to me, Holden! I love you!\" Sean snapped, stepping closer to Holden, but the other boy sidestepped him this time. \"And I love you too, but maybe there's more to it. Maybe we just need to take a breather and figure everything out.\" \"And dating other people is gonna change that?\" Sean questioned, watching Holden move around him toward the exit. \"Feel free to do the same, Sean; you're the frigging star football player, I'm sure there are plenty of guys out there that would jump at the chance to go out with you. I'm sure there are plenty of girls too.\" \"I'm not bi, Holden.\" Sean said sternly. \"Whatever, Sean, it doesn't matter to me. If you like girls, then you like girls. It doesn't change anything. Date other people, go hang out with some of your guy friends, I don't know. Just don't keep trying to get back with me, at least right now.\" The door was propped open now by Holden's back, and music began to flood into the room. \"So what, you're just leaving us like this; up in the air?\" Sean asked, incredulous. \"I guess so, Sean. I love you, but we both need to let go. If we find ourselves together again, then I'm not going to fight it. But for right now, we're just two people trying to figure things out.\" And then he left Sean there, alone just the way he had begun the night. How damn ironic.[Chapter 15] Decode By: KellyCRocker59 Chapter Fifteen Well this chapter took me a while to write; my apologies, but I ended up adding a lot more than planned! I hope you enjoy it nonetheless :) Holden was grateful for Christmas break; ever since the dance, he had found it difficult to not jump right onto Sean every time he saw him. Especially with that stupid gaze he kept shooting him that made him totally want to jump his bones; stupid football players and their hotness. After deciding to leave Sean's house, Reed had found out and had welcomed Holden into his home; the kid could have taken in the whole town and still had money to spend, so Holden didn't feel too bad for imposing. He was actually hanging out a lot with Reed now; the other boy was nice and of course popular, so being around him meant a limited amount of social torment. Reed's parents were rarely home, and every weekend meant a party at least one night, so that meant Holden was drinking far more alcohol than was healthy. And that's when he met Brian. Well, sort of. The party Reed was holding had gotten more wild than usual, so Holden had settled at a seat in the kitchen, trying to get drunk enough that Sean would stop popping into his mind. That was when he had heard a voice behind him. \"You wanna dance?\" He turned, and behind him was a boy he had never seen before; built strong with short light brown hair. His figure was a bit softer than Sean's, but he was just as muscular. And so of course he was hot. \"What?\" Holden asked, alcohol slipping up his articulation. The boy got closer, placing a hand on the bar beside Holden and leaning in. \"I asked if you wanted to dance.\" The words were soft but not hostile, instead coming off as cloying; inviting, even. \"You do realize I'm a guy, right?\" Holden asked, unsure why this jock he had never met would be messing with his head. It earned a deep chuckle from the boy, who leaning back up straight. \"Whatever, I guess I had you wrong.\" He started to walk away, but Holden stood to follow him. The guy seemed to actually not be trying to screw with him. He was dizzier than he had expected, however, and he stumbled. With a grunt, he felt himself grasped by strong hands, face against a powerful chest. \"Dude, you should definitely lay off the alcohol.\" The boy said, the same boy he had been speaking to. Holden tried to stand up straight, but the room was spinning, the dance floor of the living room looking like it was at a sharp angle. \"I…I just need to move on.\" Holden grumbled, turning to reach for his cup undeterred. Apparently his hand missed the cup, because when he went to take a drink, there was nothing in his grasp. Then, a hand was on him again, one grasping his own hand so that he could be pulled against the warm side of the boy. \"We need to get you somewhere where you can lie down.\" The boy said, arm going around Holden's waist and moving them both away from the pounding music. They walked down a hallway that Holden didn't really remember; it was dim and there were loud noises coming from the bedrooms. They found an empty one, and the boy set Holden down on the bed. Holden overestimated the strength in his body, because as soon as he was forced to hold himself up on his own, he collapsed like a limp noodle on the bed. The pressure of the other boy sitting beside him was all that signaled to Holden that he wasn't alone now. \"I doubt you'll remember, but my name's Brian.\" \"Are you gay?\" Holden asked. Something triggered in his mind that told him he shouldn't really be asking that, but it diminished with the boy's chuckle, that same deep sound. \"Yeah, I like dudes. What about you?\" \"Guys are hot.\" Holden mumbled, rolling closer the boy. He felt a hand drifting along his side, but when he went to grasp it, the hand was on his face, running along his cheek before disappearing completely. \"You're cute.\" Brian said, and Holden smiled really big, because he loved it when anyone would tell him that. Someone used to tell him that a lot, but he couldn't quite remember the name. \"When you said that about needing to move on…what did you mean?\" \"I said that?\" Holden asked, looking up now at the face he realized was attached to a body sitting beside him. This guy was really hot. Brian sighed, and then grabbed something off of a table nearby. He was writing something down, and then Holden felt his hand at his side, pushing something small into his pocket. \"Call me whenever you're not drunk. I like you.\" Holden smiled wide at these words, and it earned him another laugh. \"Do you need a ride home?\" Holden shook his head. \"No, no…I live here.\" \"Oh, you live with Reed Bennett?\" Brian asked. \"Yep! It's…well it's a big long story.\" Holden replied. \"Oh…well I hope you can tell me when you're not trashed. Will you be okay in here by yourself?\" \"Yes I will!\" Holden replied happily, because just being around another guy who had an interest in him made him happy. Brian smiled, touched his face again briefly, and then he was gone. Holden was passed out within seconds. After awakening the next morning to a throbbing head and little recollection of the previous night, Holden found a note in his pocket with a phone number scribbled on it. This was a catalyst to his memories, flooding his brain with the boy from the previous night. After helping Reed clean up the demolished house, Holden dialed the number. \"Hello?\" The deep voice came over the line after a few rings. \"Hey…it's Holden.\" He said, taking a seat on his bed. \"Who?\" \"Well, I guess I didn't tell you my name. I'm the…well, I the drunken guy from last night.\" Holden replied, turning a bit red at the description he gave himself. \"Oh okay. Holden, huh? That's a nice name.\" He replied, and Holden smiled despite himself, lying back on the mattress. \"So do you remember my name?\" \"Brian, isn't it?\" Holden asked. \"I guess you weren't as drunk as I thought. Well, Holden, if you're calling me then I guess it's safe to say you're at least a bit interested?\" \"Yeah, I guess I am.\" Holden answered, trying to stifle the thoughts of Sean that came to the forefront of his mind. \"Well then I guess I should ask you out. How about we hit up Cheddar's around seven next weekend?\" Brian's words were assured, like he didn't know Holden's answer but would be fine either way. \"Yeah, sure.\" Holden replied. \"Good. I'll pick you up around 6:30. You gonna still be living at Reed's then?\" \"Yeah, I'm pretty sure. I'll call you if anything changes.\" \"Alright then. Oh, and Holden?\" \"Yeah?\" \"I can't wait.\" It was refreshing to be able to go on an actual date. Holden realized that, as he was getting dressed, he had never publicly gone on a date with Sean. Sure, they could have after both of them had come out, but the idea had never come to him. He left a button undone on his button-up plaid shirt, and shaved just enough of his face with an electric shaver to give him a good scruff. He thought he looked pretty great if he were to be honest, but was more euphoric about the opportunity to just get out of the house and go on an actual date. Brian arrived at exactly 6:30, pulling up in a sleek black Hummer. Of course he was rich. \"You look amazing.\" Brian said as he climbed into the vehicle. The other boy was dressed in a bright plaid shirt, which accommodated Holden's darker one. His muscles were prominent even beneath the clothing, and Holden found himself returning the sentiment without really registering that he was speaking. Cheddar's was packed, as to be expected for a Friday night. Luckily, Brian had scored reservations, and they were seated in a booth near the middle of the restaurant. \"So what's up with you, Holden?\" Brian asked as they sipped on their beverages. \"What do you mean?\" He still felt stiff in his seat, unable to really relax around the other boy. \"Well, what are you into? I mean, I play tennis, and when it's the off-season, I'm practicing for the season to start again. I wanna know what you spend all of your time doing.\" \"Well, I'm president of FBLA, which takes up a lot of my time. We're planning on going to this big business expo in a few weeks, and we try to get new ideas around school about local businesses. I go to the gym several days a week, and I'm in all upper level classes, so I don't really have a lot of spare time during the week. I guess there's not a whole lot that really gets me going.\" Holden replied, realizing how utterly boring he seemed. Brian seemed interested regardless, listening carefully and nodding when he was done. \"Well, you seemed like you liked talking about FBLA. I noticed you kinda leaned up and got into it.\" \"Yeah, I guess I do like talking about business and the economy and stuff. It just fascinates me how corporations and even small businesses operate.\" Brian granted him a smile, and Holden stifled a blush. \"Looks like you've found your passion. I could totally see you going places, Holden. If this whole dating stuff doesn't work out, I at least want a business card.\" \"Pshh, whatever. You're totally gonna be busy at Wimbledon in a few years.\" Their food arrived shortly, and Holden found himself less self-conscious now. They exchanged words easily, and Holden came to learn a lot about Brian. His favorite show was \"Sons of Anarchy\", he confessed to having read The Hunger Games six times each, and had spent the past summer following The Black Keys on tour. He was fascinated by Holden's obsession with \"Gossip Girl\", and was interested in him. It was nice having a guy to just talk to; even if this didn't evolve into anything, he would at least get a good friend out of it. The two boys stayed late, time passing like a cool breeze, nice but unnoticed. Brian grabbed the check coolly as it arrived on the table, not giving Holden a questioning glance as he paid for both of their meals. As they left, Holden checked his phone to find that it was almost nine; time had seemed to vanish. However, as they stepped outside into the cold air, everything froze in the moment. \"Holden?\" He turned, recognizing the voice but unable to fully believe it. His eyes didn't deceive his sight; just as they were walking out, his parents were walking in. His mother had been the one to speak, eyes nearly bulging from her head as she looked at him. \"Mom…Dad.\" Holden acknowledged, feeling Brian's presence and thankful for it more than ever in that moment. His dad had an odd presence about him; he stood with shoulders more bent forward than he used to, and he was holding his mom's hand tightly against his side, in a way Holden had never seen. \"Holden…we need to talk to you.\" His dad said, and Holden felt like stones were being dropped onto his head, cement locking him in place. \"I think…I think you said enough the last time I saw you.\" Holden whispered. He wanted those words to be filled with anger and rebellion, full of independence. Instead they sounded in his ear with nothing more than meekness. \"That's…well, that's the thing, honey. We need to talk to you about happened. It wasn't your fault.\" His mom said, beginning to reach out but seeming to think better of it. \"I'm glad you realized what I knew this whole time.\" He replied, gaining a bit of courage. He felt Brian's fingers grazing the small of his back, urging him onward. \"Son, please just sit down and talk with us.\" Holden broke at his father's words. No apologies, no promises to make amends. But the tone of his voice carried a weight like none Holden had heard, and when he looked into his father's eyes, he could a pain that he had felt that night. So he turned to Brian. \"Are you okay with me going with them?\" Brian nodded, offering a smile. \"If I'd known you were just gonna eat again, I wouldn't have paid for your meal.\" Holden smiled despite the situation, and with a light graze of their fingers, Brian was leaving. Holden turned back to his parents, who seemed to be waiting patiently. \"Are we going to go in?\" He asked. His mom nodded, and he led the way back inside the restaurant. He sipped at the water he had ordered, and waited for his parents to speak. He wasn't going to be the one to instigate this; not when they had broken him so thoroughly. \"What happened to Sean?\" His mom asked. \"That's really the first thing you ask me, after all these weeks?\" He countered, and then felt a pang of guilt at the pain in her eyes. \"We broke up. Well, he broke up with me.\" \"He's an idiot, then.\" His dad said out of nowhere, taking a swig of his Coke. Holden nearly flinched in surprise at his dad's words, but he continued before Holden could dwell on it. \"Holden, I…I'd like to say I'm sorry.\" He was leaning forward now, eyes gripping Holden's. \"You hurt me, Dad…\" Holden whispered, but he still couldn't look away. \"Honey…\" His mom practically sobbed, but his dad silenced her with a shh. \"I need to say this. Holden, I don't care who you want to be with. In that moment, I was so shocked, and your grandpa, he wasn't exactly open-minded. I reverted back to his ways, and that wasn't me speaking that night. Your mother, she didn't know what to do, because neither of us saw this coming. We love you, Holden, but my stupid pride kept me from speaking to you earlier about this. I'm so, so sorry for everything that I've put you through. We're lucky to have a son like you; you love so much, and care about others, and I just…dammit, Holden, I don't care what people try to tell me, being gay can't be wrong. Not when someone like you is.\" Holden was biting his lip hard by the end of that, and his dad had reached out to touch his hand. \"Will you forgive me?\" His dad added in a whisper. Holden lost it, tears rolling down his cheeks in the middle of the restaurant. Surely people were looking, but Holden just couldn't handle this. He nodded hard, hoping it was distinguishable. Then he felt his mom's arms around him, pulling him close. He let her, clutching her with one arm as he grabbed his dad's hand with his free one. Finally, he managed to compose himself in time for the food to arrive for his parents. His mom remained sitting beside him, and he sat close to her. She kept telling him how sorry she was as well, for not chasing after him and not trying to reach out sooner. He forgave her too, and his parents ate while he relaxed, feeling a massive burden lifted from his shoulders that he had gotten so used to holding. \"Will you move back in, Son? Everything is just as you left it.\" His dad asked, and Holden realized that he seriously didn't know what his son's answer would be. \"Of course, Dad. Can you guys drive me by Reed Bennett's house so I can get my car?\" They nodded, and he sighed, his mother grabbing his hand. \"We love you, Son.\" So Holden had kind of lied to Sean when he had said that he might go on a date with Brian. The date had happened two weekends prior to the dance, and since then, they had been texting and talking a lot. Holden had actually invited him to the dance, but Brian had early morning practice that his trainer insisted upon, so he had passed. Even now, lying in his old bed and watching his ceiling fan spin, he thought about Sean. Hopefully these two weeks of vacation would be his way of finally cutting the ripcord that seemed to tie him to the other boy. He could only hope.[Chapter 16] Decode By: KellyCRocker59 Chapter Sixteen Well, it has been a really long time! I'm sorry that I couldn't get this up sooner, but I was just suffering from major writer's block. Hopefully this chapter was worth the wait; a lot of the ideas came to me at the same time, so I hope I executed them well. As Holden stepped into the school, he felt like he had never left. Christmas vacation had flown by, and he considered briefly while walking to his locker why this had been. The snowless days had been filled with refreshing times with his parents, hours spent on the couch abusing their Netflix subscription. And then there was Brian. With his parents now fully accepting him, Brian came over often, either hanging out at his house or taking him out to a movie or dinner. It was simple, just what Holden needed. He didn't have to think when he was around Brian, comfortable because the other boy was too. He could just relax and have an easy conversation about nothing in particular, could kiss him when he felt like it and cuddle when he wanted close company. Brian was good to him, and as much as Holden tried, he couldn't fathom a flaw in the other boy. He stopped in front of his locker, unlocking it and pulling out the books he needed for first hour while shoving his bag into the small space. \"Hey, Holden.\" He turned toward the voice and found Julia leaning against the locker nearest him. She looked stunning, curled hair pulled into a ponytail, a nice dark top accessorized with necklaces and a few glimmering bracelets. \"Hey, Julia; how have you been?\" He asked, closing his locker and leaning against the closed space. \"Well obviously not as good as you, apparently.\" She replied, flashing a big smile. \"What do you mean?\" \"Oh come on, Holden, everyone is talking about you being with Brian Lanch, that super hot tennis player that has college scouts all over his back.\" Holden averted his eyes then; he really shouldn't be surprised that word traveled so fast, even without school to serve as a catalyst. The first day passed quickly; teachers didn't assign much homework as everyone was attempting to get back into the routine of school, so Holden spent the day catching up with friends. He learned all of the latest rumors, and by seventh hour he had found out Morley was dating Kelvin, Jason had broken up with Kate (oh sweet revenge), and Brian Lanch dating Holden Wilson was the biggest news of all. Crap. He didn't see Sean all day, and ignored the odd feeling in his chest that came with it. He needed to get home and go out with Brian; the break had been perfect, just them and no one else to judge or analyze it all. No one to tell him that there was anything wrong with being comfortable. He was walking to his car after school when he heard his name being called. He almost stopped, but then he realized who that voice was attached to, and continued the trek across the parking lot. He really was wishing that he had parked closer now. The voice continued, and he looked around the parking lot to find it deserted. He had stopped to talk to his English teacher about an essay, so of course it would be his luck that no one would be there to diffuse the situation. He yanked his door open, but then it was slammed shut. He turned toward the force that had blocked his escape, and there was Sean Jackson, panting because he had run across the lot to reach him. His own heart felt like he had just run a marathon as their eyes locked, Sean's filled with a desperation that Holden couldn't focus upon. \"Holden, talk to me.\" He demanded, his hands planted on either side of Holden's car, trapping the smaller boy against the vehicle. Holden moved his eyes from Sean's, only to focus on the rippling muscle that bulged from the sleeve of his t-shirt. Where was all of the strength, the defenses he had established against this boy over the break? \"Sean…I'm seeing someone. You should know that.\" He replied, cursing himself inwardly for not being able to come up with a better reply. \"Yeah, I know, Brian Lanch. What the hell is up with that? Don't you think you've tortured me enough, Holden?\" He questioned, trying to catch the other boy's gaze. Holden wouldn't have it, looking toward the ground. \"You didn't want me, Sean. You got scared, and you dumped me, so I moved on. It's not that easy to get over not being good enough.\" \"When did I ever say you weren't good enough? I love you, and dammit, that should be enough! I made a mistake, letting you go, but I only did it because I was trying to protect you. I told you at the dance it was a mistake, that I wanted you back and was sorry, but then you ran off and got with that douche bag!\" Holden jolted his head up then as anger surged through him. \"Brian's a good guy, Sean. He's a hell of a better person than you.\" Sean raised an eyebrow at this. \"And that means he's right for you? I'll admit I've made mistakes Holden, but I don't know what you want me to do about it. I don't know what you want from me at all anymore.\" \"I want you to leave me alone and let me just be happy. I was happy during Christmas break. Brian's a really awesome guy.\" Then Sean was leaning closer, and Holden could feel his warm breath on his face, his eyes intense. \"Screw him! I was miserable, Holden. I hated every day I couldn't see you, and when I found out you were with him, I wanted to bash his face in. When are you gonna get over this and just let us be together?\" Holden shrugged. \"I don't know, Sean. Maybe when I know for sure that you aren't going to pull away again. And maybe when I know that Brian isn't right for me, because right now, he seems pretty perfect.\" \"Oh really? Does he do everything that I made you do, Holden?\" Sean asked, his eyes draining of rage and replaced with something else. His hand came up, moving along Holden's chest, down to his hip. Holden could feel his heart in his throat, breathing becoming even more difficult. \"Does he make you blush when he touches you?\" Sean moved even closer now, pushing his knee between Holden's legs as their chests pressed together. Sean ground his hips forward, and Holden gasped. \"Does he make you moan his name when you guys have sex? Does he touch you so that you can't stop begging for more?\" He asked, and his hand had found its way up Holden's shirt, travelling along his stomach, thumb massaging the skin. Their foreheads were pressed together, and Sean was breathing steady, their lips brushing as he spoke, they were so close. \"Does he kiss you right between your shoulder blades right before he finishes? Does he say he loves you when you're done?\" Holden couldn't even form a coherent thought now, hips moving against Sean's without his consent as Sean's hand braced them against the vehicle. Holden had parked far away from the school; if anyone saw them… Then Sean was pushing their lips together, setting his whole world on fire. It sparked his senses alive in a way that he hadn't felt in so long, and he would have gasped if he wasn't busy urging Sean to kiss him harder. It was all too much, too overwhelming. His hands gripped Sean's t-shirt tight, the muscles moving beneath his fingers. Their hips still moved, denim rubbing hard as Sean's lips found his neck before returning to his lips. But then, it was over. \"That's what I thought.\" Sean replied, pulling away with a smirk that Holden hadn't seen in a long time. He couldn't even reply to that, thoughts unable to form from the mush that the other boy had created of his mind. \"I'll be around, Holden. Whenever you want me back, I'll be waiting.\" And then Sean Jackson was walking away, leaving Holden breathing hard against the vehicle. After that evening in the parking lot, Sean didn't so much as look at Holden. It kind of drove him crazy actually; at school, he was used to earning a glance from the other boy, at the very least. But now he was left to just meander through the days of the week without much excitement. January and half of February passed far quicker than he had wanted, which left Holden feeling the pressures of the future more than ever. Evenings were filled with college plans, and when that didn't occupy his time, Brian did. Brian was great. Supportive, fun, and willing to just sit there with him while he sifted through stacks of scholarships, something Holden probably took too lightly. Maybe that's why it came as a shock to him when Brian was refusing to come into his house, just standing there at the front door with this sort of distorted look on his face. They were supposed to be having a movie night at Holden's house, who had prepared by dressing in comfortable yet nice sweats and a t-shirt. \"What are we doing here, Holden?\" Brian asked. Holden's immediate thoughts went to when he had wondered the same about his relationship with Sean, and now he could only shake his head, unsure how to respond. \"I don't know what you mean. We're dating, Brian. You're my boyfriend.\" But Brian shook his head now, forehead creasing as he seemed to internally struggle with something. \"I mean…what am I to you? What am I in context of your future? I mean are we planning on doing this for the long haul?\" And Holden realized now that maybe he hadn't perfected the balancing act the way that he had believed he had. He had become far too preoccupied by college, and had left Brian to just be his fling on the side. He thought about Sean, and how he had always made time for him. Being worried about the future was no excuse to neglect Brian. \"I'm sorry, Brian. I just…I don't know, I'm just sorry.\" He replied, but the other boy seemed unconvinced. \"I like you a lot, Holden, and I know you like me. I'm not insecure; I know I'm an awesome guy. I've been really patient about whatever's going on in your head about Sean, and I really thought you were in a good place during your break from school. But as soon as you went back, you started acting all caught up in something, and I know I'm better than being second choice to this other guy.\" \"You're not…I…\" Why did this have to come up right now? Maybe if Holden had a chance to even think about how he felt about Sean, he could offer a better response. Now he just felt like the biggest douche ever, trying unsuccessfully to convince this guy – one that a lot of other people would kill to have – that he really cared about him. Holden didn't know what to say to convince Brian that he actually cared about him, and maybe it was because he wasn't sure how to convince himself, even though he had every reason to be madly in love with this guy. But he couldn't lose Brian; not now, when he needed the other boy to keep him from going insane about Sean. So he did the only thing he could think of. He slept with him. As if Holden wasn't busy enough, the Valentine's Day dance needed planning and decorating. After that night with Brian, Holden had felt better about being with the other boy. He had never really thought of himself as really sexual person, but maybe what he was missing wasn't so much Sean as just having a sex life. College now seemed like a distant dream, and without Sean hovering over him all that time with that smile, he could just relax and enjoy his senior year. Taking a page from Katy Perry, Student Council decided to base the dance around a Candy Land theme, covering the gym with various props of sugar-based foods as well as preparing loads of cookies and candies for refreshments. It was enough give any normal person diabetes within an hour, and being the nervous eater that Holden was, he inhaled the extras every time he became particularly frustrated with the flakier of the Student Council members. The entire task of decorating the gym took all week, which made him really wish that they hadn't undertaken such an ambitious project. It all seemed to pay off, though; the dance pulled in more students than any other dance so far during the school year. Holden had brought Brian along, although with so many people, there was much more maintenance to be done. This left Holden hurrying around, leaving Brian to hang out with Julia and Reed, both of whom were welcoming to have a new addition to the dancing group. Holden was in the Student Council room searching for the extra cookies when the door opened and closed with a thud. He turned to find Kate standing there, looking like a complete mess. Her mascara streaked down her cheeks, her hair was disheveled, and her beautiful turquoise strapless dress had a large stain in the middle of it. \"I-I'm sorry, I didn't think there was anyone up here. I'll just go…\" She heaved out, and Holden felt his heart ache for her. \"No, Kate; stay.\" He replied, closing the distance between them. She turned back toward him, sniffing hard. \"Just sit down.\" He offered, patting a chair. She took a seat, and he walked over to grab a box of Kleenexes from the teacher's desk. He took a seat beside her, handing the girl the box. After blowing her nose and wiping her eyes, Kate finally managed to get her composure a bit. \"You really don't have to be here. I've hurt you so badly, Holden. Honestly, I'm surprised you haven't punched me or something.\" He snorted. \"I don't hit girls. And yeah, I know you screwed me over pretty badly, which you still haven't apologized for, but you're still a human being, Kate.\" \"I am sorry, Holden. I just…I don't know, I guess I just got really bitter. My mom is spending all of her time with her new husband, and you got Sean, and I just felt like no one was there to listen.\" \"I would've been there for Kate, if I had known. I'm sorry that I didn't see you struggling.\" He replied, putting a hand on her knee. She covered it with her own, but couldn't look into his eyes. \"I know you would have, Holden. You were the best friend I could ever have asked for. I took that for granted all the time. Seeing you happy, I should have been happy for you, but I just felt so much anger, and I couldn't seem to get rid of it no matter what I did. And now look at me; I've completely destroyed my life.\" \"Well, in case it's any consolation, I forgive you. I've been through some crap too; not as bad as you, but I can imagine what it's been like. Do you wanna talk about it?\" She sighed, grabbing another Kleenex and wiping at her eyes, which only smeared the mascara more. \"Jason broke up with me because he said I was getting too attached to him. We slept together, so naturally I felt like we were going to be together for a long time, if not the rest of our lives. I guess that was a really naïve thing for me to think, because he didn't feel the same way. I was heartbroken, and so I started looking for someone who could be there for me. I ended up talking a lot with Eric Rogers. He was just so nice, listening to all of my issues and telling me how I deserved better and one day I'd find a great guy. We started hooking up, but he was dating Morley Clarkson, and she came after me as soon as she found out. I'm surprised you didn't hear about it.\" \"I guess I've been too preoccupied with college and everything. I'm sorry, Kate.\" \"Don't apologize; this is my entire fault. Morley told her friends, and that's why I look like this now. I just wanted to have fun at this dance, but as I was walking over to get a drink, a girl tossed her punch on me and called me a whore. They all joined in, just yelling at me and making a scene. I know I deserved it, but it's just really hard, you know?\" Holden nodded. \"Of course. I mean, I went through a lot of bullying and stuff when I came out. It was easier with Sean there, but it was never easy. I'm sorry you've had to go through this alone.\" \"But I earned every second of it, Holden. You coming out, that's who you are; you shouldn't have to hide it. But I hurt people, a lot of people, and this is where it got me.\" She said, eyes averting to the ground. Looking at Kate now, she looked like nothing more than a girl broken by the pressures of high school. She was different now than she had been months ago when Holden had confronted her in the parking lot. She had done some stupid things, but she didn't deserve this. \"We need to get you out of here.\" Holden said, standing and grabbing Kate's hand. \"I can't; Student Council members have to stay for the whole dance.\" She said weakly, not pulling away from his grasp. \"If you stay here, Morley and her friends will only make it hell for you. Come on; I'll take the blame.\" He urged, offering her a smile. Kate returned it weakly and stood. Holden guided her out of the room and back to the dance. He noticed the shift in emotions as soon as Kate made another appearance. The way people eyed her disdainfully, how they started whispering as soon as she passed. How had he not caught this? He walked back over to his group of friends, who were dancing without a care. Brian looked especially ridiculous, throwing himself around to the beat of a Rihanna song. Holden grabbed him by the shoulder, and he turned, ceasing the dancing. \"I need to take Kate home.\" Holden said over the music. \"You can't leave, Holden; we have to stay and take all of the decorations down. Mrs. Altrist already said that if anyone leaves, they're going to get half of their points taken away for the dance.\" Reed said, leaning in. He looked at Kate with a bit of hesitance, but didn't comment. \"But she needs to go home; she's going to get hurt.\" Holden replied. \"Hey, is everything okay?\" Holden turned absentmindedly, only to feel his stomach drop. Sean was there, looking at their huddle curiously. He was probably wondering why Holden wasn't dancing his face off. \"Kate needs to go home, but none of us can leave because we're in Student Council.\" Reed said before Holden could dismiss him. \"I'll take her home.\" Sean offered suddenly, walking closer. \"No, I'll take her.\" Holden said quickly, grabbing Kate's hand again. She looked rather disoriented, busy searching for Morley in the crowd. \"Come on, Holden; there's no reason for you to take a blow to your GPA when I can just take her myself. This dance kinda blows anyway without anyone to dance with.\" Holden didn't let the jab affect him, shrugging and allowing Sean to usher Kate away, toward the doors. He attempted to brush off the brief encounter with the other boy by allowing himself to be taken under by the music blasting from the speakers, but he just couldn't. Why did Sean have to make it so hard for Holden to stop loving him?[Chapter 17] Decode By: KellyCRocker59 Chapter Seventeen Sorry it has been so long! I really wanted to figure where exactly I was taking this, even though I had the end result planned out. I hope that this was worth the wait, even if not a whole ton of stuff happens. I'll try to have the next update up in less time than it took me to get this one done. Everything was beginning to come together. A few weeks after the Valentine's Day dance, Holden had gotten his acceptance letter from Berkeley, and was offered quite a large scholarship based on his academics. After this left him with peace of mind, other thoughts began to creep up upon him. They came at the most inopportune times. Brian would have him pinned down to his bed, lips traveling across his jaw, and he would wonder about how he would traverse the large campus of Berkeley next year. They would be all twisted in his sheets during the early morning, and Holden would wonder whether or not he would need a toaster in his dorm. And then there were the times when they were right in the middle of sex, his nails finding purchase along Brian's clenched back, and Sean would appear in his mind. That was the one image that was the most difficult to get rid of, and the one that Holden was haunted by most often. Even now, as mid-March settled in, he just felt like something wasn't right. It should be; Brian was the ideal boyfriend, and really he was perfect for a long term commitment. College was no longer an issue, and he was back to hanging out with Kate quite often, as well as continuing to have a strong bond with Julia and Reed. His parents had even given him access to his trust fund, now that he was old enough. While it only amounted to a few thousand dollars, it was far more than he was expecting, and plenty of money to be frivolous with. Yet there was this piece missing. It was like a tiny part of a puzzle, one that you wouldn't miss if you glanced at the full picture. But if you looked hard enough, it would become glaringly apparent. In fact, you would begin to view the whole picture as far less, because this piece now seemed so integral to its whole existence. And that's how Holden felt without Sean in his life. There wasn't really much holding him back from returning to Sean's arms, when he thought about it. Just this thing called pride, which he really had far too much of anyway, and Brian's heart kind of being in his possession and everything. But if he wanted Sean bad enough, surely he would look past all of that and just go to him. Maybe he was just oversimplifying it. Maybe he didn't belong with Sean Jackson. He was really tired of worrying about it either way, which just left him disoriented so often that he was beginning to wonder what real understanding felt like. Student Council needed to undertake a service project. Key Club had already done a blood drive, canned food drive, and highway cleanup, which left them looking like the most selfish group of students in the school. While this didn't bother any of them much, Mrs. Altrist was quite perturbed, which meant the rest of March would be spent in brainstorming. Honestly, Holden hadn't thought they would come up with anything, and Mrs. Altrist would be content to just wade through the rest of the year with only Clash of the Classes left in early May. But then, on April Fool's Day, no less, Morley Clarkson spoke up. \"What if we do a charity auction, where we put all the football players and cheerleaders from this year up for money? Everyone has to bid, and whoever wins the person gets to spend an entire day with them. Then, we can give the money we raise to a children's hospital or something!\" Of all the times in her damn life, why did she have to choose now to actually have an intelligent moment? Of course Mrs. Altrist perked up at this, and she wasn't the only one; every student in the room was now buzzing about the concept. Morley looked content with herself, which made Holden want to punch her in the face. \"That sounds like an amazing idea! I'll have to speak with the coaches about participation, but it looks like this is our service project. How does everyone feel about going with Morley's idea?\" Everyone nodded simultaneously, so Holden didn't even bother to argue. He thought about Sean standing up there on stage, subjected to the eyes of every person in the student body. It made this weird tingly thing happen in his chest, so he shoved it away and focused on what Mrs. Altrist was saying. \"…April 5?\" Everyone nodded in agreement once more, and Holden just felt like he was on the outside looking in. \"Consider this your way of finally dealing with your feelings.\" Kate said, curling her hair while sitting at her vanity. Holden crossed his legs on her bed, rubbing his leg absentmindedly. \"Well what if I don't know what my feelings are?\" He questioned. \"Do you love Brian?\" She asked, raising an eyebrow. \"Yeah, I think so.\" Holden said quietly, realizing how unsure he sounded. \"Well, do you love Sean?\" She asked now, ignoring how pathetic his tone had been. \"I don't know…\" He mumbled, throwing himself back onto the bed, sighing deeply. \"Think of it this way: which one would you save from jumping off of a cliff?\" \"How am I supposed to know? That would never happen.\" Kate sighed, not bothering to mask her exasperation. \"You have a week to find out, Holden. Then you'll have to either watch as some floozy girl or curious boy pulls Sean off to do God knows what, or you'll be spending a day reconnecting with your soul mate.\" \"Soul mate?\" He questioned, sitting back up to inquire further. \"Yeah, but that's just my opinion. Honestly, it's whatever you want to do.\" The week passed far more quickly than was fair, leaving Holden still in limbo. So he settled on the safest possible option: he would not even consider betting on Sean. Everyone else could duke it out, and he would just sit back and think about Brian. Brian, the best boyfriend ever. Brian, the guy who had spent so many months being supportive and far more selfless than he needed to be. Brian, who wasn't Sean. Dammit; thinking was not working out so well. The day arrived, and Holden helped usher all of the students toward their seats. The football players and cheerleaders were lined up on the stage, a podium for the announcer at the front. Mrs. Altrist would be announcing each student and settling any feuds about betting. The girls all sported short shorts and low cut t-shirts, while the guys wore shorts paired with tight t-shirts to expose as much of their muscle as possible. \"So, you planning on betting on anyone?\" He spun around to find Sean there, leaning a hand against the railing of the bleachers. He was dressed similar to the other guys, the muscles of his arm bulging forth from the outstretched limb. Holden fought back the urge to just stop breathing completely; it wouldn't do much to salvage his dignity, especially considering they were standing here on the floor of the gym with everyone up in the bleachers with a perfect view. \"No, I don't, so don't go expecting to hook up with me.\" Holden replied in a huff. Sean just smirked though, taking his arm from the rail and crossing them over his chest. \"I'd be fine with just talking.\" \"We are talking Sean. There's not much you seem to want to say.\" Holden replied, looking around the crowd in hopes that the other boy would take the hint. \"Because it's obviously not enough, Holden; I'm not sure what more you want me to do. One second you want space, the next…\" \"You need to get up on stage; Mrs. Altrist is giving me the stink eye.\" Holden interrupted with a lie, grabbing Sean's bicep and urging him in the direction of the stairs. He tried not to think about how the other boy had felt beneath his fingers, instead watching the football player throw him a backwards glance before swaggering up the steps and onto the stage, easily getting into conversation with a few other guys. Holden climbed up the bleachers and sat down comfortably between Kate and Reed, who had seemed to be chatting absentmindedly while they waited. Just as he sat down, Mrs. Altrist began the auction. \"The bidding will start at one dollar. Stand and raise your hand if you wish to bid; any shenanigans, and you'll be sent to detention immediately. This is for a children's hospital, so keep that in mind.\" A few girls went up for auction; Reed betted on Jessica Stalling, some blonde junior that Holden had seen a few times. He won her, and hurried down the bleachers to meet her at the chairs where the pairs were to sit. Holden watched a few football players get picked, all by girls, and then the numbers were diminishing; two more girls and three more guys. Then, Sean stepped up to the front. \"Sean Jackson; one dollar.\" Mrs. Altrist began. \"Twenty dollars.\" Morley Clarkson said, standing and raising her hand. The audacity she had to plan this whole thing then try and steal Sean! Well, technically she wasn't stealing him, but she kind of was. He wasn't really sure how to justify that, so he settled on not moving and controlling the hard roll his stomach had done. \"Thirty dollars!\" Maggie Lewin called out, darting up from her seat with an eager expression and wild eyes. She was a sophomore, and while it was slightly better if she got Sean than if Morley got him, Holden was a bit unnerved by her response. \"Forty dollars.\" Morley countered, granting Maggie a brief sneer. \"Fifty dollars!\" Maggie replied. Sean was looking bewildered, shocked that two girls seemed to be fighting over him. A few guys were chuckling at the irony of it, and Holden felt Sean's eyes catch his, only briefly. \"Sixty dollars.\" Morley said. \"One hundred dollars.\" He didn't really realize when he had stood, or why he had his hand in the air. All Holden knew was that everyone was staring at him now, Morley surely glaring while Maggie nursed a broken heart. But his eyes settled on Sean as Mrs. Altrist called the bid on the other boy to an end. Even from that distance, he could see the confusion painted on the other boy's face, and it made him want to grab his hand and take him out of the gym. He kind of forgot why he shouldn't do that for a moment, just standing there staring at the stage. He felt a nudge, and then he remembered that he was supposed to be moving down to the chairs. Time seemed to barely pass as he made his way to the gym floor, reaching the chairs as Sean waited for him. Sean tried to grab his hand, but he pulled it away when an image of Brian flashed to the forefront of his mind. \"Queers!\" Someone yelled in the crowd. \"Say that to my face and I'll kick your ass!\" Sean hollered menacingly in return, Holden fighting back the urge to just run away right now. He took his seat, Sean feeling so much larger beside him. \"What the hell was that about?\" Sean questioned in a hushed tone, leaning toward Holden as the auction continued. \"I'll tell you once I figure it out.\" Holden replied, not daring to look at him as he pondered when exactly his heart had gotten such a strong say in what his head decided. The auction came to a close, and Mrs. Altrist announced that money would be charged to each student's account for later payment if necessary. All the students were dismissed, and those who had made purchases were forced to sign a disclaimer about what exactly they weren't entitled to just because they had bought a football player or cheerleader. Sean hovered behind Holden as he signed the paper, and then Holden headed out toward the parking lot, the other boy right beside him. \"Well, what now?\" Sean questioned, as they made their way across the lot. \"You can go, if you want to.\" Holden replied, yanking his keys out of his pocket and unlocking his car. \"Why would I wanna do that, babe?\" Holden practically felt himself cringe, and he turned back toward Sean as they stood beside his car. The other boy had a playful expression, unphased by Holden's seriousness. \"I don't know why I bid on you. Call it petty jealousy or whatever you want, I don't care. But I have a boyfriend, who I have strong feelings for, so I don't need you screwing things up any more than you already have.\" Sean smirked, reaching out to touch him. Holden swatted his hand away, but Sean grabbed his hand and pulled him forward, flush against his chest. \"You bought me, so you get me. And honestly, that disclaimer doesn't mean shit, because there's nothing you could have me do for you that would be against my will.\" Holden took a deep breath, forcing his thoughts away from what those words meant. He shoved away from Sean's grasp, the other boy allowing it this time. \"Let's just go.\" He replied, climbing into his vehicle. He wasn't exactly sure where they were driving. He kind of meandered around town, wasting away all of twenty minutes as Sean fiddled with the radio dial, trying to find a good station. \"Would you just pick something?\" Holden finally snapped, and Sean twisted the dial one last time, setting it to Top 40. \"I kinda like the bite you have now. Did Brian teach you that?\" He asked, and Holden could hear the teasing in his voice. He was torn to stop the car and kick him out, or just stop it and throw himself at him. This was really not a good situation. He settled on driving to the park and parking them there. It was a Friday evening, so most kids were off getting ready for parties rather than doing drug deals. He cut the engine, leaning back against his seat and just thinking. He felt Sean's eyes on him, but when he turned to look at him, he was jarred by the vulnerability the other boy's face held. \"So I guess this is our chance to talk?\" Sean asked, and Holden turned back to staring hard at his steering wheel, sinking down into his seat. \"Yeah, I guess so.\" Holden replied, unsure what else to say. \"Well, I still love you, just in case you forgot.\" Sean began, adjusting in his own seat. \"Sean, don't. You're the one who called us off.\" Holden replied, tracing the emblem on the leather. \"Yeah, and I apologized. Honestly, Holden, I don't know what else to say to you. I didn't cheat on you or anything, and I even gave you space like I said I would. I want to work us out, and you're acting like I totally screwed you over.\" \"You kind of did, Sean! I needed you more than ever, and you just left me in limbo. I didn't know what to do, or who to go to. Thank God Reed was a good friend. I appreciate that you didn't cheat on me, and I really believe you're a good guy. I just don't know whether or not this is going to be a recurring situation, where you have me when it's convenient and then push me away when it's not.\" Sean was silent at that, and Holden didn't continue, allowing his words to sink in. Maybe he was being a bit unfair. Maybe Sean had just had a moment of weakness, and he needed to accept that. Holden certainly wasn't perfect; the last thing he wanted was to seem like a total girl about it all. Then felt a hand on his arm, and he turned. Sean was looking at him in question, his hand moving down his arm before settling on his hand, which rested against his knee. Holden didn't pull away, allowing the other boy to take his hand and hold it against the armrest. Sean settled back to looking out toward the park, and Holden felt his heart pumping loud in his ears as he followed the other boy's view. Sean's hand felt rough and callused, similar to Brian's. Sean's was a bit larger though, his fingers weaving through Holden's more assuredly. \"I signed to Vanderbilt.\" He said. \"Oh, really? That's great.\" Holden managed out, even though his stomach was churning at the words. Berkeley and Vanderbilt were nowhere near one another. \"I got accepted to Berkeley.\" \"That's great, Holden.\" Sean said softly, tilting his head back against the headrest. \"Should we go somewhere?\" Holden asked, moving his free hand along the wheel without much thought. \"Let's just stay here a while.\" Sean said, and Holden felt himself relax in his seat, not realizing he had been tense until that moment. Sean's thumb rubbed along his hand, and he licked his bottom lip before leaning back to press his knees against the dashboard, getting comfortable. \"I feel the same way.\" He said, before he even allowed himself to think about it. \"What?\" Sean asked, turning toward him. \"That thing you said earlier, about how you felt about me. I feel the same way.\" He felt Sean smile, and in that moment, Holden didn't allow himself to think about Brian. He didn't allow himself to consider the future or anything else, really, besides just sitting in his car with Sean, allowing the cool spring air to seep into the vehicle. He couldn't help but wonder if that missing piece was now in place. Or maybe he had just shattered the rest of the puzzle along the way.[Chapter 18] Decode By: KellyCRocker59 Chapter Eighteen I know I promised less time between updates, but it has been quite a wild few weeks! I wanted to get this chapter right, and now that things are settling down, it shouldn't be so long for the next chapter. Things are winding down; right now, I plan to end things at chapter twenty. I'm glad this has garnered some fans and I hope you enjoy this chapter! It was late April; it was not supposed to rain like this in late April. Holden's windshield wipers beat at the relentless downpour, seeming to make no headway as he drove far below the speed limit on a back road. The weather had set in without warning a few minutes ago; he had expected it to pass, but instead the degree of rain intensified, leaving his path of vision in his vehicle at pretty much none. He was lucky that he knew this path like his own road home at this point; enough trips to Brian's house had prompted his memory to store the directions. He had only a few more miles to go, but at this rate, it would take him at least ten more minutes. He eyed the clock, seeing that it was late evening. If this weather didn't let up, he'd be spending the night. As he became accustomed to the beating of the rain against his car, Holden allowed his mind to drift away from the present situation. There he was, sitting with Sean as the sun dipped down the horizon. Neither of them spoke the rest of their time in the car, just basking in the easiness of the moment. Holden knew as soon as either of them got out of his car, everything would get complicated. Brian was an amazing guy, one of the best, and there was no way that Holden could just break up with him when he had done nothing wrong. It wasn't right. He still held on to the hope that maybe things would ignite with Brian the way they had with Sean; maybe he was just holding on to Sean too tightly. Not that the time in the car had helped. Finally, he reached Brian's driveway. He pulled up to the garage, the overhanging limbs of a tree blocking some of the rain. He killed the engine as the garage door opened, revealing Brian standing in a hoody and sweats, offering a big grin. Holden couldn't help but return it, climbing out of his vehicle and shutting the door behind him, hurrying across the short distance so that he could reach the warmth of the garage. \"Hey.\" Brian greeted, closing the garage behind them as Holden wiped a hand through his hair, wet from just the brief route from car to garage. \"Hey.\" Holden replied, and Brian stepped forward, hand moving to rest casually on his hip. Holden allowed himself to soak in the feeling of the other boy's body nearly pressed against his own. Brian leaned down, their lips making contact. Holden sighed against him, reaching forward to grab the other boy's hoody in his hands and pull him closer. Brian chuckled as Holden kissed him with more urgency, feeling emotions sweep through him as he felt the other body against his own. Brian's other hand found Holden's hip, guiding him back toward the house. They barely made it indoors before Holden was yanking the hoody over Brian's head, thankful in equal parts to Brian's parents' couple's retreat and the boy's lack of layers beneath. His hands ran across bare skin as Brian unzipped his jacket and shoved it from his shoulders. Holden allowed him to tear the shirt over his head before he led Brian to the couch, a large piece of furniture that could substitute as a substantial bed. Thirty minutes later, Brian was collapsed on top of Holden face buried in his neck as both boys lay equally naked and exhausted. Holden ran his hands through Brian's soft hair, massaging his scalp as he stared up at the ceiling in the dim room. He heard the crackling of a fire in the background as it warmed the room. Brian kissed his neck softly, traveling along his jaw before finding his lips. They kissed lazily for a moment, all while Holden tried to fight off the sinking feeling in his stomach. This didn't usually happen right now; he should be euphoric, not dissonant. \"You okay?\" Brian asked, pulling back with a creased brow. \"Yeah, 'm fine. Just tired.\" Holden replied with a weak smile, truly feeling his eyelids getting heavy. Brian smiled, rolling off of him and standing. \"I'm hungry. You want anything?\" He asked, grabbing his boxers and pulling them on before disappearing behind the couch somewhere. \"I'm fine.\" Holden replied as a click of a light signaled the boy's location in the kitchen, and Holden just lay there, feeling a chill set in at the loss of the warm body as he attempted not to panic. \"Do you have any blankets anywhere?\" Holden asked, sitting up. He looked into the kitchen at his boyfriend, sifting through the cabinets with his back to him. \"Yeah, there's some in the armoire. Get me out one too, will ya? Do you want any hot chocolate, maybe?\" \"Sure.\" Holden said, strolling over to the large wooden set piece and opening it. A few quilts were stacked inside, and he grabbed two before returning to the couch. However, no sooner had he wrapped himself in one and got comfortable on the couch then the light in the kitchen blacked out. \"Are you kidding me?\" Brian questioned, walking back to the living room. He looked sexy, standing there in his boxers, muscled frame just barely illuminated by the fire. \"Power out?\" Holden asked from the comfort of his blanket, swallowing hard against a knot that had risen in his throat. \"Yeah; I'm just glad I got a fire going.\" Brian replied, taking a seat beside the other boy and cloaking himself in the quilt. \"Well…what now?\" Holden asked, leaning against the side arm rest and stretching his legs out on the couch. \"I guess we can just sit here and revel in one another's awesomeness.\" Brian replied with a smile. \"Sounds great.\" Holden said, returning the expression as he felt himself relaxing. \"We could always just have sex until the power comes back on.\" Brian suggested. \"Sorry, I don't think I have that much stamina.\" Holden answered, leaning his head back with a bigger grin. Silence filled the room then, leaving Holden to thoughts better left unattended. Like how he had had sex with Brian again just to see if the feelings for Sean dissipated. It hadn't worked, of course. Or how Brian looked at him, like he was his entire world. It just wasn't fair, especially not to Brian. \"I applied for Berkeley.\" Brian said suddenly. Holden's head snapped up, his eyes locking with the other boy's. He was staring back at him hard, though a bit of shyness crept in. Air suddenly seemed in short supply, and Holden could feel his palms clamming. \"What? I thought you had gotten a full ride to Brown.\" \"I did, but Berkeley's a really great school. They have a great tennis program and awesome dorms and you're there and everything…\" \"Brian…\" Holden hadn't meant to come out so weak, but he couldn't take it back now. Not with Brian looking at him like that, with his eyes all full of hope that Holden knew was founded on love that wasn't close to evenly reciprocated. Realization dawned on him then, as the soothing tone of the fire and drumming of the rain set a backdrop to the words that he couldn't run away from anymore. \"We need to break up, Brian.\" Shock was the first thing to flash across the other boy's face. Then panic, or maybe betrayal, and then some other emotions that Holden just couldn't read. All he could do was sit there and take it in. \"Why?\" Brian finally asked, once he had seemed to reign in all of the conflicting emotions. His face seemed almost impartial now, but Holden knew that wasn't the type of person Brian was. \"Because I can't love you as much as I should be able to.\" Holden replied, feeling his heart ache at his own words. \"But that's okay, Holden. Really, I can settle with that.\" Brian said, leaning closer to him. His face was just barely lit by the fire, but Holden could see the desperation written across his profile now. \"You shouldn't have to, though. You deserve so much more than I can give you. I'm sorry.\" Holden whispered, just loud enough that Brian could hear it. Brian just sort of hovered there, torso over Holden's legs as he stared long and hard into the other boy's eyes. Holden let him, no matter how much he wanted to look away. Maybe he could show him everything that he couldn't seem to say. Finally, Brian settled back against the couch, sighing. \"I guess I should have seen this coming. I just thought we were going so strong.\" \"I'm sorry.\" Holden replied. \"Don't be. You can't control your heart; I'm just glad you let me know before I invested a ton of time into Berkeley.\" Holden watched as Brian toyed with the quilt, knowing he wanted to say something else. \"It's Sean, isn't it?\" Brian asked, looking back over at him knowingly. Holden nodded, feeling suddenly too small in the large quilt. Brian's gaze just made him seem even more stupid for leading him on for so long. Now, it seemed so obvious that there was really only one choice all along. \"Of course; who else would it be? Honestly, I don't really get it. He's hot and all, but I'm just as awesome as he is.\" \"Yeah, you are. Maybe even more awesome.\" Holden replied with a weak smile. Brian turned to look at the fire, seeming to get lost in his thoughts. Holden let him; he deserved as much, after all. \"He better be good to you.\" \"I think he will be this time.\" Holden replied, feeling sure of himself, despite all the baggage that he seemed to be holding onto for all these months. Now it just seemed like he was transcending everything. \"I hope for your sake that you're right. Either way, just know I'm here for you, Holden.\" Brian said, looking back at him with a disarming sincerity. \"Thank you, Brian.\" Holden responded, really hoping that this wouldn't be the last time he would talk to Brian. \"C'mere.\" He said, stretching out his arms. \"What?\" Holden questioned, shrinking back a bit into the couch. \"I wanna cuddle. Just one last time. You dumped me on my face, so I think you deserve to at least give me this.\" Holden sighed, leaning forward and allowing Brian to pull him into his arms. Brian twisted them around in their quilts, their bodies melding together easily after various nights of practice. Holden settled his head into Brian's chest, the other boy's fingers running along his back. It was so easy, so peaceful; and yet all it did was lead him to wonder why this couldn't have ended differently.[Chapter 19] Decode By: KellyCRocker59 Chapter Nineteen Well, this is almost it! All that's left is the epilogue, which I sort of already have planned out, but want to make absolutely perfect. I hope this chapter is good; it was one of my favorites to write. Now that he had broken up with Brian, it should have been easy to jump right back in Sean's arms. The other boy had made it clear that he was waiting for him, that he wasn't going to try a relationship with anyone else until Holden took him back. All that had been holding them apart was Holden's relationship. And a little thing called pride, but he tried not to dwell upon that too much. The final weeks of school began to dwindle away, days filled with studying for finals and various other exams. Holden didn't have time to worry about Sean, really. He tried to tell himself that as he poured over review books, tapping his pencil against his desk with urgency as he tried to draw his attention from big biceps and infectious grins to cognitive dissonance and opponent processing. \"I heard you broke up with Brian.\" Holden turned to the boy standing beside his locker. Sean leaned by his shoulder against the locker adjacent to Holden's, dressed in a green t-shirt and loose ripped jeans. His eyes were more questioning than knowing, which surprised the other boy. \"Who told you?\" Holden asked, closing his locker and heading in the direction of College Algebra. \"I heard it through the rumor mill,\" Sean began, trailing after him. \"Rumor has it you cheated on him with his tennis coach.\" \"That part is not true.\" Holden said, flinching for the briefest of seconds at the fine line between truth and fiction in high school. \"That's good to hear.\" Sean said, sounding far more relieved than Holden was sure he had meant to. They continued to stroll down the hallway, underclassmen managing to move out of their way. \"Is that all you wanted to know? Because I don't think you're mentally evolved enough to handle College Algebra.\" \"Dude, I passed Trigonometry last year with a B. Totally not a sign of my low IQ just cuz I hate math,\" Sean retorted as they reached the doorway. Holden halted, leaning against the door as he turned his full attention to the other boy. Sean seemed to realize that he was waiting for him to continue, and he cleared his throat with purpose. \"I was wondering if, since you were single and all again, you may wanna, you know…\" \"I don't think I've ever seen you this flustered, Sean.\" Holden replied with a smirk. It was refreshing to be able to turn the tables for once. \"You screw with my damn head, Holden!\" Sean snapped low, brow creasing. When he spoke again, his voice was more even. \"I'm asking you out on a date. If you say no, I reserve all rights to beat the shit out of myself.\" Holden snorted. \"That's pretty weak blackmail, you know; what if I don't care whether or not you get injured?\" \"Then I guess I'll be in a wheelchair next year for Vanderbilt if things go well.\" Sean replied, smirking how Holden remembered so well. \"Pick me up at six tomorrow night. I have an AP test that day, so if I want to be a total douche bag, you have to deal with it.\" Holden replied, smiling in return. It seemed time had made him far less susceptible to Sean's charms. \"Fine by me, as long as I get to see your sexy ass outside of school.\" Sean answered, and before Holden could stop him, he planted one right on his lips. It was brief yet sparked a trigger in Holden's chest that caught his breath in his throat. Sean touched his face for a second, rough palm feeling warm against his flesh, and then he was grinning big, all pretenses gone. The bell rang and Sean was sauntering away, Holden heading into the classroom. It seemed he wasn't as immune to Sean Jackson as he had thought. Holden buttoned up his flannel, leaving the top button undone for effect. His jeans were loose, comfortable on his hips. He swiped a hand through his hair, a few strands moving into place as he did. He gazed at himself in his bathroom mirror; there was a frustrating pimple on his temple, but otherwise he was proud of his appearance. Just as he was sifting through his wallet to check how much money he had, a knock sounded downstairs. \"Holden, I believe that's for you!\" His mom called from the kitchen, busy preparing dinner. He tried not to seem too eager as he walked down the stairs and to the front door. Truth be told, he was a little bit excited; he wasn't about to let Sean know that, though. Last time, he had been a total pushover, something he wasn't proud of. That wasn't him, and he had been a bit dazed by the idea of being with the sole daydream that inhabited his teenage fantasies. Holden shoved his wallet into his back pocket before opening the front door. Sean stood there in a plaid shirt, unbuttoned just enough to expose the expanse of muscle along his chest. His jeans were ripped, revealing one of his kneecaps. His hair was tousled, and he looked like he might have a lumberjack alter ego. \"You ready to go, babe?\" Sean asked, grinning wide. \"Yeah, as long as you don't call me that.\" Holden replied with as much disdain as he could muster, closing the door behind him and leading the way to Sean's truck, parked parallel by the mailbox. \"You used to love it.\" Sean retorted, his tone playful. \"We aren't together, Sean.\" Holden said with care, waiting as the other boy walked around to the driver's side to unlock the door. \"Yet.\" Sean finished, climbing in and pressing the unlock button once inside. \"We aren't together.\" Holden repeated, taking a seat as Sean started the engine. \"You know, there's all this space beside me for you to sit.\" Sean said as he drove into the city. Holden eyed the middle seat between Sean and himself, the arm rest pushed up to make room. \"I'm not letting you get handsy with me.\" He replied, turning back to gaze out the front window. \"That's what you say now. I'll have you panting my name by midnight.\" Sean said, and Holden could just feel his smirk. \"How romantic.\" Holden groaned, not offering anything else up for conversation. Holden had started to drift off into fantasy when Sean broke the silence. \"Can you believe we're getting ready to graduate?\" \"Not really; it feels like yesterday I was a freshman, pining after the up and coming quarterback.\" Holden replied, turning to offer Sean a smile. Sean chuckled, shoulders seeming to loosen. \"I thought you were pretty cute too.\" Holden snorted. \"I had all sorts of acne problems and not an ounce of muscle; no need to lie to me.\" \"You were kind of endearing, always passing out fliers for clubs and stuff. I don't know, I had a thing for nerds I guess.\" \"I was not a nerd.\" Holden retorted, incredulous. \"If not a nerd, you sure were a diva.\" Sean said, and this time his smile didn't hold anything but joy. \"Yeah, I guess. Whatever; I might be kind of dramatic sometimes.\" Sean had made reservations at the local Thai restaurant; Holden had never been, but it seemed quite nice inside. The lighting was dim, and they were seated at a booth for two, the wood table spotless. \"So how are your parents doing?\" Sean asked, toying with the salt shaker once the waiter had left to fill their drink orders. \"They're good; my mom's stressing out a bit about me moving so far away, but I think she'll learn to cope eventually.\" Holden said, sipping at his water once the waiter set it down. They placed their orders, and Holden was a bit unsettled by the silence that filtered in. \"You're a lot sharper than you used to be.\" Sean said. Holden looked up to examine him, but the other boy's eyes were on his water as he stirred it with his straw. \"What do you mean?\" Holden asked, leaning forward with his arms crossed on the table as his brow creased in questioning. \"Before, you seemed so much more…unsure, I guess. Like maybe you didn't know whether or not we should be together, or like you didn't have a lot of confidence. You just sort of went with the flow. Now you have a lot more bite to you. I like it; it keeps me on my toes.\" Sean finished, looking up at him with a smile. Holden sighed, leaning back in his seat, trying to control the thud of his heart upon seeing the expression grace the other boy's face. \"You haven't changed at all, for the record.\" Sean snorted, taking a drink of his water, \"Gee, thanks.\" \"No, it's a good thing. You're still kind of arrogant, but not enough to make you a jerk. It's hot.\" Their food arrived before Sean could respond; steaming platters piled high with food. They ate it relative silence, but it was far easier this time. \"What are your plans for the summer, Holden?\" Sean asked, taking a break from his mound of veggies. Holden shrugged, twirling his pasta without much thought. \"I don't know. I have summer orientation, and I'm thinking about getting a job, but I kind of just want to enjoy this time before I really become an adult.\" \"I'm the same way. I just want to savor the last days of my childhood.\" Sean replied, popping a broccoli tree into his mouth. \"It's kind of scary, isn't it? We're gonna be adults, out in the real world, making our own decisions. I've spent so much time worrying about what my parents think, seeking their approval, and now I don't have to anymore. The only person I have to keep happy is myself.\" When he didn't get a response, Holden looked up at Sean. The other boy was just sitting there, brow creased as he stared hard at his plate. \"Sean, you alright?\" Holden asked, voice quieter than he had meant. Sean shook his head, looking up at Holden and offering a weak smile. \"Yeah, just…thinking about stuff. Sorry.\" \"Should I be worried?\" Holden asked, tone playful but meaning his words. \"Naw, I've been doing that lately. I just kind of get lost in my own head sometimes.\" \"I get that. I'm sort of always like that, actually.\" Holden replied, earning a chuckle from Sean. They fell back into easy conversation, casual exchanges of words with the occasional joke. Holden found himself feeling more at ease than he had in quite some time, enjoying Sean's company in a way that he hadn't since before they had let the whole school know about them. As they were driving, Holden could tell something was bothering Sean. The other boy's hands seemed too tight on the wheel, his eyes too focused forward. \"Sean, what's bothering you?\" Holden asked, leaning toward him a bit. \"It's nothing, I promise.\" Sean replied, but Holden was unconvinced. He slipped off his seat belt, sliding across the seat to the middle. He buckled himself in, and reached out, grabbing one of Sean's hands off the steering wheel and holding it in his own on his lap. It felt rough in his, warm and nice and just right . \"You can't do that to me, Holden.\" Sean muttered, not taking his eyes from the road. \"What?\" Holden asked, feeling the way Sean's frame tightened against him. The other boy seemed to consider his words with care, Holden managing to wait with as much patience as he could muster. \"I used to be able to keep it together pretty well, back when we were dating. Now, though…there's just something about you. I don't know what it is, but when you get close to me, I feel everything so much stronger. The briefest brush of the shoulder with someone feels like a punch to the gut, and the slightest sniff causes a vivid scope of images behind my eyes. Whenever I'm around you, I just sort of…lose control. It kind of freaks me out, how I feel about you. Whenever you were with Brian, it would take all my self-control to not break all of his limbs and then light him on fire, and he's not even a bad guy. I'm just not sure what I'm capable of when it comes to you.\" Holden felt Sean's grip on his hand tight now, fingers fastened through his. He pondered the other boy's words, realizing where he was coming from. The way he felt about Sean was so much different. He didn't have the territorial drive to keep him safe; he just felt this strong bond that made him want to either pass out or make Sean happy however he could. It was like Sean was counterbalancing everything Holden felt. \"Do you ever wonder if maybe you're just meant to be with someone?\" Holden asked, running his thumb over the back of Sean's hand. \"Yeah.\" Sean replied without a thought, seeming to almost act upon instinct. \"I didn't think that was true. I always thought that there were people we're more drawn to, but that if something doesn't work out, we aren't necessarily out of luck. And then I wondered if there is that one person, if it's enough to be together just because it feels right. I wondered if maybe too much can happen, too much can screw things up and that person being the right person just isn't enough. But now, I'm thinking maybe it is.\" It was like the pressure Sean was building was released. His shoulders slumped back into a comfortable position, and his hand rested on the steering wheel, rather than locked upon it. Holden smiled to himself as Sean realized what he had said, and he leaned closer to him, their shoulders pressed together. \"My parents are out of town; do you wanna go back to my place?\" Sean asked. \"That…\" Holden swallowed around the lump in his throat, \"…that sounds good.\" Sean reached his house and pulled into the driveway, killing the engine. Both boys sat there, neither knowing whether or not to move. Then, Holden was turning toward Sean, and Sean was looking at him with this look, a look that Holden hadn't seen in a long time. Sean leaned down, hand finding its way to the back of Holden's neck, and he pushed his lips against the other boy's. Holden could feel his heart in his throat, thumping heavy and threatening to burst free as he managed to get his hands free between them, grabbing handfuls of Sean's shirt as the other boy adjusted in the seat, lowering them down onto the cushion as his lips moved with more insistence upon Holden's. Holden shoved his lips harder against Sean, wanting to feel him more, to touch him more. His hands forced their way up his shirt, traveling along the shifting muscles of the other boy's back. Sean's lips trailed to his neck, kissing and biting along his jaw before finding his lips again and pressing his tongue into his mouth. Holden's nails ran blunt across Sean's skin. His legs were wound around Sean's, their bodies pressed so flush together that they were sharing body heat. Sean managed to pull his lips away, his hands resting on the cushion on either side of Holden's head. His eyes were heated, almost hostile, but Holden knew better. \"We need to take this inside; a lot more room.\" He said. Holden nodded, and they both managed to get out of the door before Sean was pinning him to the truck, kissing him with an urgency that fueled Holden's desires. \"S-Sorry…I just…\" Sean began, panting, but Holden shook his head, grabbing his hand and walking them inside. Sean shut the door behind him, Holden already moving up the stairs. It was his turn to push himself against Sean, kissing the other boy hard against the frame of his bedroom. Holden worked the buttons free on the plaid shirt, shoving it from Sean's shoulders. Sean almost ripped Holden's shirt, trying to get it off of his body. Both boys managed to get inside the room shirtless, shutting the door behind them. Holden led them back toward the bed, relying on memory rather than sight. He pushed Sean onto the bed, the other boy falling on his back. Holden was upon him in seconds, unfastening his jeans as Sean's hands traveled all over his body, never settling upon one spot. \"I love you.\" Sean whispered against his lips as they kissed with sloppiness, trying to get rid of the rest of their clothing. \"I love you too, Sean Jackson.\" Holden replied as Sean's face buried in his neck, sucking on the flesh. \"Promise you won't leave me again, Holden. Please…\" Sean begged, and Holden caught an inflection in his voice that caused his stomach to lurch. He buried his hands in Sean's hair, moving his face down so that their lips could press together again. He opened his mouth, allowing Sean's tongue to glide along his teeth. They kissed open-mouthed and desperate, chests slick against one another as the room began to feel too hot, too confining. \"I promise.\" Holden managed to reply, their foreheads pressed together as Sean's hands tugged his jeans loose and off of his hips. Sean nodded, biting at his own lip before kissing Holden again and rolling them over, taking control of the situation. Holden felt his entire world collapsing and coming into existence at the same time. This was all he wanted, and he was going to allow himself to have it.[Chapter 20] Decode By: KellyCRocker59 Epilogue Well, I poured over this for weeks, trying to make it prefect. It seems I've reached an end, and I can only hope you enjoy it as much as I enjoyed writing it. Thank you to everyone who has read and enjoyed this, and thank you for being so amazing. I hope that this is a fitting end to one of my favorite stories I've written, and that you have also liked it. It has been a long ride, but I'm glad to be able to share it with all of you! \"Holden, you just look adorable !\" Holden spun around just as he was fully embraced by a smaller blonde individual. \"Thanks…Morley.\" He replied, and she pulled back to grant him a big grin. He readjusted his cap as she stumbled back. \"Are you…drunk?\" He questioned, raising an eyebrow. She put a finger to her lips. \"Shh…I just had a shot or two. Just wanted to be a little buzzed for our big day !\" He rolled his eyes, placing a hand on either shoulder as the girl rocked back and forth. \"Just go find whoever you're walking with, and please try to keep some sense of sobriety.\" \"So many big words, you're getting me all dizzy.\" She responded with a disoriented grin. \"That's not me, that's the alcohol.\" He replied, pushing the girl slightly toward where the mobs of people were. He had just arrived, and scanned the vicinity for familiar faces. He found Julia talking with Reed, so he headed over there, curious as to where Sean was, but not worrying too much. The guy seemed to make a point of being late to school events. \"Hey; you nervous?\" Julia asked, turning toward him. \"Not too bad, but it hasn't really sunk in yet. What about you guys?\" Holden asked. Reed gave a shrug. \"High school's kind of been my life for the past four years, but I'm over it. I'll miss everybody, but it's not that big of a deal.\" \"I only spend a few hours a day in this place as it is, so it won't be that big of a transition for me. I barely recognize half these people!\" Julia replied, rubbing her hands together and betraying the slight nerves that seemed to be taking her. \"I think we'll all be fine. We're just going to need to hang out a lot this summer.\" Holden said, reaching over and grabbing one of Julia's hands in his. She offered him a kind smile, and he felt his heart soften, nerves that he didn't realize he had seeming to dissipate a bit. \"Everyone start lining up with your partner in the gym, single file!\" Mr. Halk called from the front of the Common's Area. All the students began to head into the gym, searching for their partner. \"Have you guys seen Sean anywhere?\" Holden asked. Julia and Reed shook their heads, and Holden furrowed his brow, looking toward the entrance for his walking partner. He was not about to go in there alone. He entered the gym regardless, getting in line behind Julia and Reed before striking up a conversation with Cecily Founder, known as the petite advocate for the school's branch of PETA. \"Hey, Holden?\" He turned at his name, finding Kate there. He couldn't tell whether her expression was earnest or restrained, so many emotions playing out on her profile that he couldn't pinpoint one. Either way, he could see the slight glaze of her eyes, similar to Morley's, but this was different. Without even thinking, he reached out, wrapping his arms around her. She returned it, grappling to him like she was being thrown off of a cliff and he was her only means of survival. \"I love you, Holden. I'll never forget you.\" She whispered into his shoulder, and he felt his stomach knotting. All of it was hitting him now, overtaking him and throwing him into a tsunami with nothing to cling to. What was he supposed to do now? There was no standard, nothing that was going to stay the same. In three months, he would never see another one of these people again for at least four months, in not longer. If ever again. \"I love you too, Kate.\" He muttered, not because he didn't want to say it but because he just couldn't . She pulled away, and he scrubbed at his face, getting the sleeve of his gown wet. She was crying too, far more than him. Her face was scrunched in a sort of compact way, her eyes squinted shut. \"We've just been through so much, you know?\" She continued, wiping at her eyes. He nodded, reaching in again and hugging her tight. He wished he could just pause this moment, just stay in high school forever with his friends and Sean and never have to worry about money or a job or just life. \"Hey, sorry I'm late!\" Holden pulled away and turned to find Sean attempting to get his cap adjusted, a big grin plastered to his face despite his attempts to regain his breath. Then, he caught Holden's expression, and his brow knitted in concern. \"Whoah, babe, what's wrong?\" Holden just shook his head, not really able to speak. \"It's all gonna be over, Sean! We're graduating and we're gonna be adults and it's all just gonna…it's all just gonna change and it's just, just…\" Kate stuttered, still wiping madly at her face. \"Hey, why don't you go find your boyfriend? I'm sure I spotted Harrison somewhere.\" Sean said, turning and looking at the girl a bit sternly. She nodded though, not seeming to notice as she meandered her way further back in line. \"Why'd you do that?\" Holden asked, sniffing hard. Sean gripped his shoulders. \"You two are toxic for each other right now. Any more of that crap and you'd have the whole student body in tears.\" \"I…\" Holden began, but then Sean pulled him into a tight embrace. The first thing Holden wondered was why in the world Sean would hug him if his goal was to stop the tears. Then, he just allowed himself to melt into the other boy, because this was all he really needed right now. Just someone to tell him he was going to be okay, that it was all going to be okay. Sean finally pulled back, offering Holden a soft smile before grabbing his hand in his. \"It's time to go everyone! Get ready to start walking!\" Mr. Halk roared over the bustle of talking. Everyone turned to the front, and the first couple began walking, heading through the Common's Area to stand outside of the auditorium. Being about tenth in line, Holden had a bit of time to get himself under control before everyone's eyes were on him. \"It's going to be okay, you know.\" Holden sighed, gripping Sean's hand tighter. The other boy ran his thumb along the back of his hand, trying to rein in his boyfriend's nerves, but it wasn't doing a ton of good. \"What are we going to do next year, Sean? We're going to colleges that are nowhere near each other. High school relationships, they don't…\" \"We'll back it work. I will make it work. I'm not losing you.\" Sean interrupted, leaning forward to catch a glimpse at the crowd. \"But, what if…\" Holden began, but then Sean turned to him, grabbed his face in both hands, and kissed him. Holden's eyes went wide from shock, but then he closed them, hands finding their way to Sean's arms, kissing him back. It was a deep kiss, taking every bit of Holden's heart and nuking it, all of his worries blown away so easily that he wondered what he had even been thinking. Sean pulled back, and Holden took a deep breath, looking at the other boy. His eyes were calm but strong, and his hands still held Holden's face. \"It's going to be okay. I promise you that everything is going to work out.\" Holden nodded, and he actually believed him. Sean smiled then, letting go of his face and grabbing his hand again, turning back to face forward. \"I love you.\" Holden whispered, just loud enough for him to hear. \"I love you too, Holden.\" Sean replied, not caring who heard. And that was when Holden let go. All of his thoughts and fears, he let drift away. He held Sean's hand tight, and just allowed himself to soak in this moment. This was their time, when life became real. There was no more messing around, but it was time. He was ready.","LastChapter":"Decode By: KellyCRocker59 Epilogue Well, I poured over this for weeks, trying to make it prefect. It seems I've reached an end, and I can only hope you enjoy it as much as I enjoyed writing it. Thank you to everyone who has read and enjoyed this, and thank you for being so amazing. I hope that this is a fitting end to one of my favorite stories I've written, and that you have also liked it. It has been a long ride, but I'm glad to be able to share it with all of you! \"Holden, you just look adorable !\" Holden spun around just as he was fully embraced by a smaller blonde individual. \"Thanks…Morley.\" He replied, and she pulled back to grant him a big grin. He readjusted his cap as she stumbled back. \"Are you…drunk?\" He questioned, raising an eyebrow. She put a finger to her lips. \"Shh…I just had a shot or two. Just wanted to be a little buzzed for our big day !\" He rolled his eyes, placing a hand on either shoulder as the girl rocked back and forth. \"Just go find whoever you're walking with, and please try to keep some sense of sobriety.\" \"So many big words, you're getting me all dizzy.\" She responded with a disoriented grin. \"That's not me, that's the alcohol.\" He replied, pushing the girl slightly toward where the mobs of people were. He had just arrived, and scanned the vicinity for familiar faces. He found Julia talking with Reed, so he headed over there, curious as to where Sean was, but not worrying too much. The guy seemed to make a point of being late to school events. \"Hey; you nervous?\" Julia asked, turning toward him. \"Not too bad, but it hasn't really sunk in yet. What about you guys?\" Holden asked. Reed gave a shrug. \"High school's kind of been my life for the past four years, but I'm over it. I'll miss everybody, but it's not that big of a deal.\" \"I only spend a few hours a day in this place as it is, so it won't be that big of a transition for me. I barely recognize half these people!\" Julia replied, rubbing her hands together and betraying the slight nerves that seemed to be taking her. \"I think we'll all be fine. We're just going to need to hang out a lot this summer.\" Holden said, reaching over and grabbing one of Julia's hands in his. She offered him a kind smile, and he felt his heart soften, nerves that he didn't realize he had seeming to dissipate a bit. \"Everyone start lining up with your partner in the gym, single file!\" Mr. Halk called from the front of the Common's Area. All the students began to head into the gym, searching for their partner. \"Have you guys seen Sean anywhere?\" Holden asked. Julia and Reed shook their heads, and Holden furrowed his brow, looking toward the entrance for his walking partner. He was not about to go in there alone.
